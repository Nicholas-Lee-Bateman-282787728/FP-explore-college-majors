Until I read some of the reviews for Mill Creek's Re-releasing of Highway to Heaven season 2, I was looking forward to purchasing this. But now, not so much. On the cover, it says ""Original Broadcast Edits"". But if you look closely (for anyone who hasn't bothered reading the label on the bottom left corner), unlike season 1, it doesn't say ""UNCUT"". On the aforementioned website, there's a note from Mill Creek saying they don't have a confirmation on whether these episodes are edited, that they only removed ""UNCUT"" to avoid misunderstandings. After reading these complaints, I have the unfortunate feeling that they're right. How can Mill Creek obtain rights for a series' unedited episodes of one season, and not another?

A Play all feature (A&E release did not have have this.)  3. Inspiring thought provoking stories.  4. The set comes in a standard size case, so it don't take much shelf space.  Some things wrong with this release.  1. EDITED episodes. (I compared the episode times with the A&E release from a few years ago. All of them about 45 min long instead of 48 to 49 min like the Season 1 Mill Creek set.  2. The discs are just stacked on top of each other on a spindle where discs can easily be scratched if you don't handle them very carefully.  3. No episode info to be found inside the case.  Now I love this show as much now as I did as a kid in the 80s, with the drama and humor mixed in, but if you already have the A&E dvd release, then stay away from this re-release of Highway to Heaven, season 2. GET season 1 (Mill Creek), cuz that has extra footage (3-4 min per episode). I still don't know about season 3 (Mill Creek) if the episodes are CUT or NOT. Waiting to find that out.
