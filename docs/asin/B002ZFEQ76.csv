1300138,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZFEQ76,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","""Love Happens."" I can't think of a title that better encapsulates the conventions of a Hollywood romance. In stories like this, love just sort of happens, usually between people who seem so different yet magically have a lot in common. Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) is a widowed author and self help guru who tries to deal with everyone else's problems but can't seem to deal with his own. Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) is a florist whose track record of bad relationships has hardened her heart. They eventually meet, and ... well, it doesn't take a degree in cinema to see where this is going. ""Love Happens"" isn't an especially bad movie; in all honesty, there are aspects of it I thought worked well. But on the whole, it's really no different from any of the countless love stories released year after year, the characters broadly drawn, the plot sappy and hopelessly predictable.Taking place in Seattle, which may or may not be a reference to the fairy tale romance of ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""Love Happens"" is at its best when the focus shifts from falling in love to coping with loss. The most interesting relationship is not the one between Burke and Eloise, but between Burke and Walter (John Carroll Lynch), a former contractor who lost everything after the death of his twelve-year-old son. Burke, whose wife died in car accident, understands Walter's pain. But because Burke has omitted a few details, understanding is not something he projects; for the most part, he sounds like your average self help celebrity, spouting generalizations and prefabricated messages for improving your life. What great conflict--we have two men unable to move forward, yet one behaves as if he has. Because of that, he thinks he can instruct other people on how to do it.But that's not what this movie spends most of its time on. Burke meets Eloise by accidentally bumping into her in the hallway of a hotel, where she has just written the word ""quidnunc"" on the wall behind a painting. (In case you're wondering, ""quidnunc"" is a real word. It means a busybody, or someone who interferes in the affairs of others.) She has a tendency to write out long, obscure words like that, although for the life of me, I have no idea why. This is, quite frankly, a very peculiar quirk, and yet it has virtually no bearing on the rest of the plot. So why bother bringing it up? Even if it was a vital plot point, what would it ultimately prove? That she's both pretentious and a vandal? Fortunately, she does have more redeeming qualities, such as collecting and copying sentimental Thank You and I Love You cards sent with flower arrangements.What's easy enough to understand is the fact that she has finally broken up with her rocker boyfriend after he cheated on her yet again. Her cynicism and distrust reaches a new level when Burke approaches her and asks if she would like to have a cup of coffee or something; in response, she pretends to be deaf by mimicking sign language.Needless to say, they will meet again and slowly begin the process of building a relationship. In order for it work, however, Burke will have to let go of the past. A large part of this involves working up the courage to confront his father-in-law (Martin Sheen), who sees Burke for the hypocrite he is. Is Eloise the one person who can give Burke the nudge he needs? Is Burke finally ready to let the healing begin? And what about his career? His agent, Lane (Dan Fogler), has introduced him to powerful media and marketing people who want to see him on television pitching various products. Of course, he will be paid handsomely for it. So it becomes a question of whether fame and fortune are more important than lifelong happiness.I could go on, but I think you get the idea. I do give this movie credit for telling the occasional joke without resorting to desperate comedy, which is more than I can say for recent Hollywood romances like ""The Proposal,"" ""Made of Honor,"" and ""27 Dresses.""The unfortunate tradeoff is that ""Love Happens"" is at times weepy and melodramatic, more so than necessary a story about trying to move forward. The most intense outpouring of emotion comes near the end of the film, when Burke and his father-in-law finally say what they've been meaning to say for a long time; it's a cathartic moment, no question, but at the same time, it isn't even remotely plausible. To be fair, the entire premise isn't even remotely plausible. As I said earlier, love just sort of happens in stories like this, which is probably why audiences tend to favor them. In the case of ""Love Happens,"" most will be drawn to Eckhart and Aniston, who have surprising onscreen chemistry despite completely different performances. Still, when a non-romantic relationship between two grieving men is more compelling than a blooming romance between a grieving man and a distant woman, your goal of making a classic Hollywood love story has yet to be achieved.",3,A Romance That Could Only Exist in the Movies,1253318400,"09 19, 2009",2009,4919,"['Love', 'Happens', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'title', 'better', 'conventions',

Believe me, I gave this film every chance to bug me to the point I would stop watching, but it never happened.  So again, why?  I'll try to hack out a soppy answer.Chemistry.  There is a legitimate chemistry between LOVE HAPPENS stars Jennifer Aniston and Aaron Eckhart; they're not cookie cutter one-dimensionals that populate so many other films of this genre--these characters are believable, interact believably, and harbor true anguish and pain.  Eckhart, playing self-help guru Burke (who has penned a bestseller about how to deal with pain and loss), by fate meets Eloise (Aniston), who is the florist for the Seattle hotel where Burke is conducting a seminar.  Even though Burke is helping others cope with their grief, it becomes more and more obvious he's bottling up some pain of his own.  (His wife having died in an auto accident some years before.)  Meanwhile Eloise has been in one disastrous relationship after another, but she has a heart of gold and is willing to help Burke--if Burke will first help himself.  All of this rushes headlong to a climactic scene featuring an interaction between Burke and his former father-in-law (Martin Sheen is very special); this scene was so compelling and poignant and tender I had to keep reminding myself I normally don't like movies like this.Sure, much of the film is sappy and contrived, and Eloise's habit of leaving obscure words behind paintings at the hotel struck me as more than annoying, but overall I very much enjoyed LOVE HAPPENS.  Dan Fogler and John Carroll Lynch stand out amidst a solid supporting cast.  There's pain, there's humor, there's romance, there's anguish--in short, there's life.  Why?  Because LOVE HAPPENS.--D.

And it helps to have a solid cast of popular and well-schooled actors to pull off a subject that might make a few people uneasy.Dr. Burke (Aaron Eckhart) is a seminar man who runs a business with his colleague Lane (Dan Fogler) based on helping people cope with grief - a group called 'A-Okay'.  Burke is a popular guru, more so because of his reason for ministering to grievers: his beloved wife died three years ago in a car accident so Burke can speak about grief from experience. But it seems he is running away from something, too.  Most of his followers don't notice, but one man Walter (John Carroll Lynch) is a particularly needy client and seems to pick up on something missing in Burke's seminars.  Burke is currently in Seattle  (his deceased wife's home) with his manager Lane (who is cooking up all manner of marketing tools and opportunities for the A-Okay team). Burke happens to literally bump into Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) who owns a flower business catering to the hotel in which the seminar is being staged. Eloise seems addicted to losers, and is freshly apart from her latest affair: she is comforted and supported by her sole employee,  the somewhat dingy Marty (Judy Greer in a terrific cameo), who encourages Eloise to look for some stability in her next mate.Burke is attracted to Eloise but is so out of practice in the dating game that he comes across as vulnerable - a trait that makes Eloise wary at first and attracted later.  The odd things the two do in the mating dance finally result in the uncovering of the secret problems Burke carries.  Refreshingly enough the film does not sell out with a happy-wappy ending, just a few thoughts that are particularly tender.Eckhart and Aniston are a terrific team on the screen: both are lovable without resorting to being sappy and repetitive.  Fogler and Greer are excellent as are such fine actors as Martin Sheen and Frances Conroy in memorable cameos.  There is a lot to like in this film that makes it a step above the usual 'chick flicks' that were more popular in theaters.  Perhaps audiences, sadly, have difficulty hearing about grieving, but death, as well as Love, happens!

A shockingly poor pair for a cop-buddy movie, let alone a morbidly obsessed quasi-rom-com, it makes you long for the days when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan would fallen in love... again.The Script-o-rama quality plot goes something like: a widower who finds success as a self-help guru, dates a flower shop owner and comes face to face with an inner truth he has been suppressing. If this sounds like a book, that's probably because it's a book. To spice things up, however, the story has been set in Seattle - mostly near the space needle thing, since that's the only part of Seattle that exists in the movies, unless you include Samara's well. In lieu of a plot, the writers have been kind enough to give us corny cliches every 5 minutes or so, and I'd recommend taking a shot every time one rears its head in yet another clunky scene.Here were my favorite groan-inducing, and yet potentially shot-slamming, moments:- The lead lady is a good-as-gold flower shop owner - a passion of her's to be sure - who's only customer is some crazy old lady who probably pays in coupons from the back of parking tickets.- Her only employee is a idiosyncratic poetry-slamming hipster, who fails at maintaining flowers effectively but exists to provide fortune cookie-quality advice to her.- The hero's dead wife made a last request that ""he set her parrot free"", barely realizing the irony of the metaphor for his guilt. And the irony that parrots largely like to sit still and would rather imitate a car alarm that go for the this whole freedom gig.- Eckhart's audience of self-help followers respond to his ""telling the truth"" initially with a slow clap, developing into a standing ovation, and then ""I love you, man"" rousing support. All while Martin Sheen is clamped around his shoulders like a possessed limpet, bawling his eyes out, and apparently wearing the same jacket as he had in The Departed.- There's a retail therapy scene where everyone shops at Home Depot, in a very poor and distant imitation of the Pretty Woman montage. Buying hardware apparently helps one of the main characters overcome his son's death. And that actor is the scary guy from Fincher's Zodiac Killer.There are many more, but then there's also some plain nonsense. Such as Aniston's old vintage car that reveals her old-fashioned and solid character values. Or that she graffitis barely-understood words behind pictures, presumably for one lucky man to find, thus enabling our hero to learn more about her by searching for the words (yes, really). Then there's an old lady who makes cookies out of her husband's ashes.I'm suspecting that this was originally a fairly dark script about dealing with death, then the studio injected a romantic subplot because a major star got involved. Or it was a passable romantic comedy that got toned down due to a test audience screening. Either way, what's left behind is a romantic half-plot that is completely dishonest with itself and a ""dealing with grief"" lesson that mixes random half-truths with utter phoniness. Add a bunch of underused characters, a parrot, shake and bake, and you're done.

Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) is a widower who happened to be in the car the night his wife died in a tragic crash.  He took his feelings, wrote a book and turned it into a themed talk show on the circuit of lost souls.  Who in the hell visits these talk shows anyway.  The oddity, or I should say one of the oddities in this movie is he doesn't even follow his own set of rules on how to embrace life once you have been faced with the death of a loved one.  He can't even ride in an elevator.I should state at this point for the record that I like this movie a lot.  It got terrible reviews and my guess is that people in the world today like all of their romantic comedies tied up in a neat little bow.  If anything veers from the cookie cutter template that is implanted in everyone's generic brain we label it bad and move on.  This movie in my opinion deserves better than that.  It takes a shot at real life problems and the psychological quirks that somebody might develop when the love of his life is prematurely taken.Burke Ryan makes his way through life helping people deal with death.  He holds workshops on how one might take the next step after the loss of an 8 year old son, how do you move forward after your husband dies, how do you face the next day after your mother passes away.  One elderly lade even made oatmeal cookies out of her husband's ashes because he loved them so much.  She kept the cookies in an earn and brought them to the seminar.  I might have lost my lunch if Burke would have taken a bight but lucky for us he passed.  In the midst of all this death he finds himself through a quirky flower shop girl (Jennifer Anniston) who has her own issues but maintains her positive outlook by writing obscure words behind paintings in hotels.Getting a little scared at this point.  Again, if you are looking for a romantic comedy that follows Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock down a preordained path this is not for you.  If you want to watch a movie about sadness, death and how love and hope can evolve this is worth a shot.  I am not saying that the storyline and acting was top notch.  It isn't the best movie that I have seen but I have seen far worse movies that have gotten far better reviews and ""Love Happens"" deserves its spot in the interesting movie section.  I liked it but then again I have a demented pessimistic outlook on life.  My girlfriend says if it weren't for her there might not be any positive energy in the house.  hahaSometimes I feel like a nut and sometimes death is a catalyst for life if we open a window and let at least the smallest ray of light inside.  Who knows, you might even be able to make a batch of cookies out of the damn thing.",3,Morbid but interesting.,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,2813,"['Starring', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'romantic', 'love', 'drama', 'twist', 'movie', 'set', 'bizarre', 'premise', 'Burke', 'Ryan', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'widower', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'car', 'night', 'wife', 'died', 'tragic', 'crash', 'took', 'feelings', 'wrote', 'book', 'turned', 'themed', 'talk', 'show', 'circuit', 'lost', 'souls', 'Who', 'hell', 'talk', 'anyway', 'oddity', 'should', 'say', 'one', 'oddities', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'follow', 'own', 'set', 'rules', 'how', 'embrace', 'life', 'once', 'have', 'been', 'faced', 'death', 'loved', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'ride', 'elevator.I', 'should', 'state', 'point', 'record', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'got', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'guess', 'people', 'world', 'today', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'tied', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'bow', 'anything', 'veers', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'template', 'implanted', 'everyone', 'generic', 'brain', 'label', 'bad', 'move', 'movie', 'opinion', 'better', 'shot', 'real', 'life', 'problems', 'psychological', 'quirks', 'somebody', 'might', 'develop', 'when', 'love', 'life', 'prematurely', 'taken.Burke', 'Ryan', 'way', 'life', 'helping', 'people', 'deal', 'death', 'workshops', 'how', 'one', 'might', 'take', 'next', 'step', 'loss', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'how', 'do', 'move', 'forward', 'husband', 'dies', 'how', 'do', 'face', 'next', 'day', 'mother', 'away', 'One', 'elderly', 'lade', 'even', 'made', 'oatmeal', 'cookies', 'husband', 'ashes', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'kept', 'cookies', 'earn', 'brought', 'seminar', 'might', 'have', 'lost', 'lunch', 'Burke', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'bight', 'lucky', 'passed', 'midst', 'death', 'quirky', 'flower', 'shop', 'girl', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'who', 'own', 'issues', 'positive', 'outlook', 'writing', 'obscure', 'words', 'paintings', 'hotels.Getting', 'little', 'scared', 'point', 'Again', 'are', 'looking', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'down', 'preordained', 'path', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'sadness', 'death', 'how', 'love', 'hope', 'can', 'evolve', 'shot', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'storyline', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'worse', 'movies', 'have', 'gotten', 'far', 'better', 'reviews', 'Love', 'Happens', 'spot', 'interesting', 'movie', 'section', 'liked', 'then', 'again', 'have', 'demented', 'pessimistic', 'outlook', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'were', ""n't"", 'might', 'not', 'be', 'positive', 'energy', 'house', 'hahaSometimes', 'feel', 'nut', 'sometimes', 'death', 'catalyst', 'life', 'open', 'window', 'let', 'least', 'smallest', 'ray', 'light', 'inside', 'Who', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'batch', 'cookies', 'damn', 'thing']",Love Happens

Technically it was a mess though.The story follows a self-help guru as he travels to Seattle (Vancouver subbed but the large volume of CGI shorted both of the cities). As he performs his schtick, we are made aware of his tragic back story, family issues and other assorted concerns. Aniston appears as the random love interest that wants to fix him all whilst dumping her current boyfriend.The Blu clarity is solid throughout, to such a point the CGI was almost irritating. They green screened every single outdoor shot, sometimes using horrible pictures of Seattle blown up outside hotel windows (so poorly done that the same window over two scenes had two different views of the American skyline). The DTS was uneventful with the exception of a few crowd scenes in the meeting halls. The special features were bittersweet and include:* Giving Romance a New Look, 3 minutes. Essentially an ad plug for the FX company - helps one realize how much CGI was in this story.* Deleted scenes, 6 cuts totaling 13 minutes, in HD. They cut out the majority of one character's role (Aniston's loser boyfriend) - glad they went, nothing worth watching unless you are a fan of Joe Anderson (Amelia, Across the Universe).* Commentary, these guys were so self-congratulating I called it quits at the 16 minute mark.* BD Live, only feature is to save clips and share them with your buddies, nothing else.The performances are fine, but the story just felt forced.

To me, this BD is a renter as you will get a clear pic and sound, but lame supplements with a fair amount of plot misery make for a lower rating.

Dr Ryan, is a successful self help speaker who helps people deal with grief and loss, but cannot deal with his own issues.  Eloise Chandler is a florist with several 'lost' relationships.  Through the film both main characters dodge what is happening, and when they least expect it, love truly happens.So much for the summary.Unlike man films with truly predictable outcomes and even dialogue, Love Happens, falls just outside the envelope.  It is not predictable, but more believable as far as scripting goes.

It resembles a trainwreck.The saddest thing about the whole pie is that it took two knuckleheads to actually write it.By the end, I didn't really realize that love happened, I just kept thinking that it was a really long seminar in Seattle and that nothing was resolved at all...and what kind of seminar is this, anyway?  I couldn't tell if he was a motivational speaker, a grief counselor or a lying hypocrite.  Maybe the answer is All of the Above.Aaron Eckhart plays a motivational counseling hypocrite who has lost his wife in a devastating car accident.  Don't worry if you miss the flashback the first time because it's rehashed at least eight more times throughout this masterpiece.  They just speed up the film rate (aka slow motion) of the dog on the rainy road for maximum impact...but it honestly just makes you laugh the more they show it.Anyway, Aaron sees a pretty flower girl who sure lounges around this hotel lobby an awful lot.  It seems like she should be in housekeeping as opposed to a florist.  Her name is Jennifer Anniston.  He asks her out and they fumble their way through scenes for about an hour + where nothing really happens and neither character is remotely interesting.A bad sign for a romantic comedy is when neither character has any redeeming quality.  Eckhart sits around, drinks vodka and feels sorry for himself regarding the loss of his wife....yet he runs a seminar on trying to help people how to cope with a loss.  There's a bumbling character that wants to quit the seminar, who lost his son, and the filmmakers stumble their way trying to make this some sort of subplot...thankfully, all Aaron has to do is to take him to the Home Depot and give him a shopping cart.  Huh?This movie almost lost me at the very beginning when there is a montage of artsy compositions of lemons being cut up into wedges.  The scene ends where they say something along the lines of, '...you have to make lemonade.""  The camera pans to the right and there's a bottle of Grey Goose.  Whah?It definitely lost me about four minutes later when we are introduced to who Eckhart is as he gives an introductory speech at his seminar where you're just scratching your head thinking, what the hell was that and what sense did any of it make?  ""He wins the National Championship Game, goes home, and shoots himself in the face.  OK, we're gonna have a great week, I'll see you all very soon!!""What is Martin Sheen so ticked off about?  He hates the bird, he runs to the closing ceremony to yell at his son in law about the bird, he makes up with him, he...what the hell is going on?  And who cast Eckhart's sidekick who has a perm mullet and just seems completely out of place the entire time?  I do think the best part of the movie is the dramatic confession by Eckhart at the end and they show mulletman in tears.
