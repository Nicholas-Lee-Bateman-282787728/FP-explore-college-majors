Unfortunately, her basic postures - which are all nicely and slowly done - start from the sitting cross-legged position.  Since I can't get into that position, the DVD is useless.  I may go back to using it after I find some other way to get more limber.  If you are young and flexible, this DVD should be fine.

I like to do a short yoga program before retiring to relax my body and unwind my mind. This program is perfect! I did it this morning just in case it would be too 'active' for sleep.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that savasana was a modified form of yoga nidra.  When Zyrka stated that the program was finished, I did not want to get up.  I was too relaxed...mentally and physically! If you are looking for something invigorgating, this is not the best program.  But then, Zyrka has others that fit that need.  If you want to 'lazily' stretch and flex and then feel totally relaxed, this is your program.  It starts off active and ends very passive.  It had the same impact on me as my first flight in a glider plane!

1137831,AQCAHCZGKWUZ5,B0012KK6QU,"R. A. Farver ""crabbup""","[6, 6]","There is a wealth of information on this disc.  I love that it is organized so that you can choose among 6 sequences of varying lengths.  There is, in addition, a pose guide which takes you through all the poses in great detail and much more slowly than in the sequences so that you can check your form and look for alternatives when you are having trouble.  I consider breathing to be the most important thing about yoga, and there is a special bit on that as well.  The music is non-intrusive.  My only complaint, and this may be only me, is that she doesn't hold the poses as long as I would like.  And she's a little fussy about getting out of even the most simple pose, so that it seems you are doing a lot of needless arm fluttering.  In all, I like this video very much, and I especially like it paired with the Tamal Dodge Yoga for Beginners.Update:  After a few months I have come to value this tape very much.  Now that I understand what she's doing, I understand that she is being very careful that you come in and out of a pose correctly and not hurt yourself, and while she may err on the careful side, that's okay.  I have serious back problems.  Also, a recent book by an M.D. recommends that you hold a pose for a long time to ease your back problems, and to begin very slowly at 10% of what you think you can do. I sometimes use the ""extra"" time to just stay in the pose.  MOST IMPORTANTLY--you will not get this much valuable information on any other tape.",4,A lot of bang for your buck,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1474,"['wealth', 'information', 'disc', 'love', 'organized', 'so', 'can', 'choose', '6', 'sequences', 'varying', 'lengths', 'addition', 'pose', 'guide', 'poses', 'great', 'detail', 'much', 'more', 'slowly', 'sequences', 'so', 'can', 'check', 'form', 'look', 'alternatives', 'when', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'consider', 'breathing', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'yoga', 'special', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'non-intrusive', 'only', 'complaint', 'may', 'be', 'only', ""n't"", 'hold', 'poses', 'as', 'long', 'would', 'like', 'little', 'fussy', 'getting', 'even', 'most', 'simple', 'pose', 'are', 'doing', 'lot', 'needless', 'arm', 'fluttering', 'like', 'video', 'very', 'much', 'especially', 'paired', 'Tamal', 'Dodge', 'Yoga', 'Beginners.Update', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'come', 'value', 'tape', 'very', 'much', 'Now', 'understand', 'what', 'doing', 'understand', 'being', 'very', 'careful', 'come', 'pose', 'correctly', 'not', 'hurt', 'may', 'err', 'careful', 'side', 'okay', 'have', 'serious', 'back', 'problems', 'Also', 'recent', 'book', 'M.D', 'hold', 'pose', 'long', 'time', 'ease', 'back', 'problems', 'begin', 'very', 'slowly', '10', '%', 'what', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'sometimes', 'use', 'extra', 'time', 'just', 'stay', 'pose', 'MOST', 'IMPORTANTLY', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'valuable', 'information', 'other', 'tape']",Yoga: Gentle Practice

Most of the DVD is just way too easy for me, as to be boring. But then I decided to try the two most difficult routines for a few days, and was pleasantly surprised. It turns out that the reason I've never been able to get a daily yoga routine going is because I wasn't accurately matching my fitness level for what I could do without breaks of more than 24 hours between sessions.Though only 2 out of the 6 routines on the disc are useful to me, those 2 are sooooo useful that it's worth the price of the disc just to get them. And once I outgrow this disc, I will definitely get the next one up from this yoga teacher,Yoga Flow. She is a great teacher. She cues what she does really well, so that you can follow along without watching the screen once you get the hang of proper alignment by watching her the first few times through. Her voice is soothing, and her explanations are quite clear. For the price of a single yoga class, you get routines you can do every day for weeks or even months.
