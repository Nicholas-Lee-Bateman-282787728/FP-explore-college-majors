Even though it's not the best movie of any of the genres it crosses, it certainly is not ""the worst gay movie ever"", as touted in the hyperbolic reviews which trash it.  SOCKET has a unique premise and carries it out well.  Without over-analyzing the physics or having a degree in engineering, I was able to sit back and enjoy a fun ride with likable characters and a light presentation. I was a little disappointed because, I don't know why, I expected more gore.  I guess when I learned of the concept of the movie, I thought it sounded very David Cronenberg... so I imagined there'd be more gore.  One of the positive aspects of the movie is that it is a movie with gay characters that isn't about being gay.  I think it has cross-over appeal for a hetero audience not afraid of seeing men naked as much as we see Sharon Stone naked in her ""thrillers"".  Also, the nudity isn't as gratuitous as other reviwews here would have you believe.  This isn't one of those movies that's all about sex & naked gays with a loose story hung around it.  Here, the story and characters come first.  I think the problem other reviewers had with this movie was a preconcieved notion of what they were going to see.  I was disappointed with the lack of gore when I was expecting buckets, but I realize it wasn't the movie makers' fault I expected that without knowing the movie well before seeing it.

In comparison to other gay-blenderized themes (such as gay-horror in ""Hellbent"") they succeed pretty admirably.  The shoestring budget that this film was made on is obvious, but not painfully so for a change, and the premise is really intriguing.The story goes like this: at some point before the opening credits, surgeon Bill Matthews (Derek Long) has been struck by lightning.  While recuperating in the hospital where he also happens to work, he is tended to by hottie intern Craig Murphy (gay indie favorite Matthew Montgomery), who has the hots back for the Bill.  Post-discharge (pun intended), Murphy introduces Bill to a secretive support group of lightning strike survivors, all of whom have found a physical - and sexual - attraction to electricity.  Together they have twelve-step-style meetings which lead up to the group getting ""juiced up"" in unison.  Bill quickly falls into the new lifestyle, but before too long a periodic jolt becomes insufficient; his thirst for each charge becomes more insatiable, leading him to a bizarre bit of self-mutilation... and worse.Sure, the idea is kind of silly... but this isn't the first time something like this has been tried.  In 1996, David Cronenberg tried to connect fetishism to automobile accidents in ""Crash"" (no, not the Best Picture winner of 2005.)  It didn't really work there... ""Socket"" has better luck conveying the idea.The film's biggest strength lies in the very clear allegory it creates in reference to drug abuse.  What is first an incredible release for Bill - and a means to connect with others - quickly dissolves into something controlling and destructive.  And although Derek Long's performance is obvious to the point that it's blunt, it doesn't keep this aspect of the film from succeeding nicely.So why the two stars and no more?  Because, after all the great set-up work, ""Socket"" completely fails to deliver the jolt (pun intended again) it promises.  The last quarter of the film is disappointingly lackluster, and the ending is so flat it almost makes you wonder if they inadvertently chopped off a final scene.  There was a great opportunity to take the electricity/drug analogy to a wild and transcendental ending... instead we get something bleak and boring.

While I was doing the research on that one, I happened upon Socket; so many personnel cross over between the two films that it almost seems as if this was one of those Roger Corman-esque situations where they wrapped one film early, realized they had time on their hands and extra film stock, and said &#8220;hey, who's got a script they want to film?&#8221; If I'm right on that, this was the movie they set out to make, and ...Bed and Breakfast... was the afterthought; every place that movie is silly, stupid fun, Socket is serious as an electrocution burn. The unfortunate side effect of this is that where ...Bed and Breakfast... escaped its basement budget relatively unharmed&#8212;in fact, connoisseurs of bad slasher movies almost expect movies to have zero budget going into them&#8212;Socket is a movie that could have really, really used a budget boost in order to get the most out of its ideas. None of the movie's problems on its own is a showstopper, but they do add up.Plot: Bill Matthews (Make the Yuletide Gay's Derek Long), a prominent surgeon at a metropolitan hospital, is struck by lightning, and finds himself a patient at his own workplace. Time goes by, and much of his physical trauma heals, but he still feels shaken, rootless, at a loss. A fellow doctor at the hospital, Craig Murphy (Gone, but Not Forgotten's Matthew Montgomery), takes an interest that is, perhaps, more than professional; not only do the two of them begin an intimate relationship, but Murphy introduces Matthews to what he initially bills as a support group for lightning-strike survivors. Bill soon finds that it is much, much more than that&#8212;and that the best way to combat his lingering malaise is with erotic jolts of electricity. But in Bill's world, electricity, like sex, can become dangerously all-consuming.There was a lot about Socket that I liked, in some cases despite myself. I know the best-lesbian-friends-of-the-gay-main-character trope is overdone and kind of tired, but that didn't stop me loving Allie Rivenbark (one of the many minor cast members who also showed up in ...Bed and Breakfast...) and Rasool J'Han (The Bay)'s characters here. Georgia Jean, while her role here was depressingly small, validated my initial impression in ...Bed and Breakfast... that there's a lot to like about her acting ability; unfortunately, these are her only two feature appearances to date. (Please, someone, fix that.) And man, the script is absolutely bursting with excellent ideas; I've seen reviews compare it to both David Cronenberg (the obvious parallel is Videodrome) and The Picture of Dorian Gray, and both of those comparisons are right on the money. In a sense, Socket is kind of the anti-Daydreamer (above); Socket has all the pieces that were missing from Daydreamer and vice-versa. Too bad these two kids didn't get together and have a perfect, twisted love child. I can't overlook Socket's shortcomings, its woeful special effects, its penchant for taking itself too seriously in places where it begs for camp, its ultimately unsatisfying ending. But I'm still going to conditionally recommend it because there is so much to like sitting just underneath the hood. If you're the kind of person who can appreciate awful third-generation bootleg tapes of your favorite band because you can listen to them and imagine what the music actually sounded like at that gig, then Socket should be right up your alley. **",2,Some holes should never be plugged...,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3575,"['Socket', 'Sean', 'Abley', '2007', 'while', 'back', 'reviewed', 'ridiculous', 'quite', 'amusing', 'little', 'movie', 'called', 'Gay', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'Terror', 'was', 'doing', 'research', 'one', 'happened', 'Socket', 'so', 'many', 'personnel', 'cross', 'two', 'films', 'almost', 'was', 'one', 'Roger', 'Corman-esque', 'situations', 'where', 'wrapped', 'one', 'film', 'early', 'realized', 'had', 'time', 'hands', 'extra', 'film', 'stock', 'said', '8220', 'hey', 'who', 'got', 'script', 'want', 'film', '8221', ""'m"", 'right', 'was', 'movie', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'was', 'afterthought', 'place', 'movie', 'silly', 'stupid', 'fun', 'Socket', 'serious', 'electrocution', 'burn', 'unfortunate', 'side', 'effect', 'where', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'escaped', 'basement', 'budget', 'relatively', 'unharmed', '8212', 'fact', 'connoisseurs', 'bad', 'slasher', 'movies', 'almost', 'expect', 'movies', 'have', 'zero', 'budget', 'going', '8212', 'Socket', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'really', 'used', 'budget', 'boost', 'order', 'get', 'most', 'ideas', 'None', 'movie', 'problems', 'own', 'showstopper', 'do', 'add', 'up.Plot', 'Bill', 'Matthews', 'Make', 'Yuletide', 'Gay', 'Derek', 'Long', 'prominent', 'surgeon', 'metropolitan', 'hospital', 'struck', 'lightning', 'patient', 'own', 'workplace', 'Time', 'much', 'physical', 'trauma', 'heals', 'still', 'shaken', 'rootless', 'loss', 'fellow', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'Craig', 'Murphy', 'Gone', 'Not', 'Forgotten', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'interest', 'perhaps', 'more', 'professional', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'two', 'begin', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'Murphy', 'Matthews', 'what', 'initially', 'bills', 'support', 'group', 'lightning-strike', 'survivors', 'Bill', 'soon', 'much', 'much', 'more', '8212', 'best', 'way', 'combat', 'lingering', 'malaise', 'erotic', 'jolts', 'electricity', 'Bill', 'world', 'electricity', 'sex', 'can', 'become', 'dangerously', 'all-consuming.There', 'was', 'lot', 'Socket', 'liked', 'cases', 'know', 'best-lesbian-friends-of-the-gay-main-character', 'trope', 'overdone', 'kind', 'tired', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'loving', 'Allie', 'Rivenbark', 'one', 'many', 'minor', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'also', 'showed', 'up', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'Rasool', ""J'Han"", 'Bay', 'characters', 'here', 'Georgia', 'Jean', 'role', 'here', 'was', 'depressingly', 'small', 'validated', 'initial', 'impression', 'Bed', 'Breakfast', 'lot', 'like', 'acting', 'ability', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'feature', 'appearances', 'date', 'Please', 'someone', 'fix', 'man', 'script', 'absolutely', 'bursting', 'excellent', 'ideas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'compare', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'obvious', 'parallel', 'Videodrome', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'comparisons', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'sense', 'Socket', 'kind', 'anti-Daydreamer', 'Socket', 'pieces', 'were', 'missing', 'Daydreamer', 'vice-versa', 'Too', 'bad', 'two', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'have', 'perfect', 'twisted', 'love', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'Socket', 'shortcomings', 'woeful', 'special', 'effects', 'penchant', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'places', 'where', 'camp', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'conditionally', 'recommend', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'sitting', 'just', 'hood', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'awful', 'third-generation', 'bootleg', 'tapes', 'favorite', 'band', 'can', 'listen', 'imagine', 'what', 'music', 'actually', 'sounded', 'gig', 'then', 'Socket', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', '**']",Socket

After a lightning accident, Dr. Bill Matthews (Derek Long) receives an invitation from an intern, Craig (Matthew Montgomery,Gone But Not Forgotten). Turns out that Craig, like Dr. Matthews, is a survivor of a lightning bolt and he has friends with similar stories. What they also share, in a weird reversal of 12-step support groups, is a secret addiction. After that first taste, they all want more, and group leader Mike (writer/director Sean Abbey) has the generator to provide it.Soon, Dr Matthews finds that he not only feels community with the juicers, but he needs more to function in his daily life. He brings the group new methods of more direct ""connections,"" so to speak, and falls into a relationship with his intern. But like all too many addicts, Dr Matthews soon discovers that he needs even more than the group can give him, and tragically discovers the only way he can get the full dose he needs. The spiral of addiction fuels ""Socket,"" and Dr Matthews' new double life adds to the tension.The premise is interesting and the actors do a pretty good job of conveying the confusing world of professional level addicts. Dr. Matthews battles with the reality of his addiction and the facade he needs to maintain at work, sneaking off to ""plug in"" and hoping nobody discovers how deep he's gone. Long does a good job at this split personality, and Montgomery's turn as at first the guide and then the spurned to the group is ""Socket's"" best performance. If seeing a gay film that doesn't follow a typical path piques your interest, then the suspenseful ""Socket"" will turn you on.",3,Circuit party,1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,1711,"['interesting', 'allegorical', 'film', 'addiction', 'Socket', 'sexy', 'dark', 'perversely', 'funny', 'gay', 'science', 'fiction', 'flick', 'lightning', 'accident', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'Matthews', 'Derek', 'Long', 'invitation', 'intern', 'Craig', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'Gone', 'Not', 'Forgotten', 'out', 'Craig', 'Dr.', 'Matthews', 'survivor', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'friends', 'similar', 'stories', 'What', 'also', 'share', 'weird', 'reversal', '12-step', 'support', 'groups', 'secret', 'addiction', 'first', 'taste', 'want', 'more', 'group', 'leader', 'Mike', 'writer/director', 'Sean', 'Abbey', 'generator', 'provide', 'it.Soon', 'Dr', 'Matthews', 'not', 'only', 'community', 'juicers', 'more', 'function', 'daily', 'life', 'group', 'new', 'methods', 'more', 'direct', 'connections', 'so', 'speak', 'relationship', 'intern', 'too', 'many', 'addicts', 'Dr', 'Matthews', 'soon', 'even', 'more', 'group', 'can', 'give', 'tragically', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'full', 'dose', 'spiral', 'addiction', 'fuels', 'Socket', 'Dr', 'Matthews', 'new', 'double', 'life', 'tension.The', 'premise', 'interesting', 'actors', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'confusing', 'world', 'professional', 'level', 'addicts', 'Dr.', 'Matthews', 'reality', 'addiction', 'facade', 'maintain', 'work', 'sneaking', 'off', 'plug', 'hoping', 'nobody', 'how', 'deep', 'gone', 'Long', 'good', 'job', 'split', 'personality', 'Montgomery', 'turn', 'first', 'guide', 'then', 'spurned', 'group', 'Socket', 'best', 'performance', 'seeing', 'gay', 'film', ""n't"", 'follow', 'typical', 'path', 'piques', 'interest', 'then', 'suspenseful', 'Socket', 'will', 'turn']",Socket
