1368054,A3BRSTTSIVF4ZM,B003W2XOTW,"Buyer Bob ""Online Buyer""","[2, 4]","This movie had a shocking theme.  Kidnapping a Hispanic post-teen brother and sister in Mexico, and forcing them to perform sex, while the kidnappers videotaped the act. Then the siblings are returned, unharmed, to resume their lives. They never know their kidnappers, or see them again, or the sex tape. But the experience destroys their bonded relationship.  Verrrrry titilating topic, and somewhat graphic in two short scenes, but then the movie slowly dies, having used-up its shock value in one or two 5 minute scenes.  The topic had immense potential, but it never amounted to much after the graphic scenes. We expect the siblings to snap-back to loving and caring for one another, but just the opposite happens. They avoid one another, until the sister marries, and moves away.  Not a ""Family"" movie. And don't watch it with your sister either, unless you are trying to put thoughts in her head. The end of the movie, the intention is to notify the viewer that this practice of kidnapping Females, Siblings, or Children in Mexico for enrichment in the Porno Industry, is not uncommon. Whether it is, or not, I cannot say. But the movie was adequate enough to demonstrate the issue.",4,Daniel and Anna Review,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,1188,"['movie', 'had', 'shocking', 'theme', 'Kidnapping', 'Hispanic', 'post-teen', 'brother', 'sister', 'Mexico', 'forcing', 'perform', 'sex', 'kidnappers', 'videotaped', 'act', 'Then', 'siblings', 'are', 'returned', 'unharmed', 'resume', 'lives', 'never', 'know', 'kidnappers', 'see', 'again', 'sex', 'tape', 'experience', 'bonded', 'relationship', 'Verrrrry', 'titilating', 'topic', 'somewhat', 'graphic', 'two', 'short', 'scenes', 'then', 'movie', 'slowly', 'having', 'used-up', 'shock', 'value', 'one', 'two', '5', 'minute', 'scenes', 'topic', 'had', 'immense', 'potential', 'never', 'amounted', 'much', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'expect', 'siblings', 'snap-back', 'loving', 'caring', 'one', 'just', 'opposite', 'happens', 'avoid', 'one', 'sister', 'marries', 'away', 'Not', 'Family', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'sister', 'either', 'are', 'trying', 'put', 'thoughts', 'head', 'end', 'movie', 'intention', 'notify', 'viewer', 'practice', 'kidnapping', 'Females', 'Siblings', 'Children', 'Mexico', 'enrichment', 'Porno', 'Industry', 'not', 'uncommon', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'adequate', 'enough', 'demonstrate', 'issue']",N/A

This isn't one.I saw this film without ever having heard of it or knowing what it was about, and boy do I wish I had beforehand, then maybe I would've skipped it. The basic premise is that Daniel and Ana, brother and sister, are kidnapped by a group of idiot pornographers (who are stupid enough not to wear masks to hide their faces) and force the siblings to have sex on camera. The film then follows the psychological effects of both siblings.That in itself might make for a great documentary, but this film, even if it's based on true events, sucks. It tries so very hard to be edgy and deep and shocking and it just sucks. Mulholland Drive makes more sense than this movie.First off, the kidnappers aren't threatening at all. You never get the sense they're actually going to commit murder if these kids don't do what the kidnappers command them to. Then, as I mentioned, the kidnappers don't wear masks. I thought maybe they would later be identified and arrested, but nope, that would run the risk of making this film interesting, which it goes out of its way to not do.Don't get me wrong, the psychological effect of this terrible event does play out with a kind of uncomfortable tension, but the movie is just so ridiculous at how things play out. Daniel literally spends the bulk of the film avoiding doing anything interesting, then towards the end he does something terrible that's obviously meant to shock you because it makes no sense otherwise. I don't need a happy ending, but that doesn't mean I'll let a crappy unresolved ending slide by.There are no likable characters in this film. Even the two victims, thanks to the shoddy storytelling, become very unlikable by the end (one by their actions, the other by their inactions).I can't even remember the last time a film made me feel this angry or this stupid for actually having sat through it. And it's not like the trashy Hollywood CGI films or Michael Bay movies that I can make fun of because the subject matter is so dead serious.There are so many much more meaningful foreign language films out there, don't was 95 minutes of your life on this one.",1,"Poorly made, manipulative piece of nonsense.",1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,2255,"['love', 'movies', 'love', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'original', 'subtitle', 'tracks', 'stupid', 'dubbing', 'know', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'see', ""n't"", 'one.I', 'saw', 'film', 'ever', 'having', 'heard', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'boy', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'beforehand', 'then', 'maybe', 'would', ""'ve"", 'skipped', 'basic', 'premise', 'Daniel', 'Ana', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'group', 'idiot', 'pornographers', 'who', 'are', 'stupid', 'enough', 'not', 'wear', 'masks', 'hide', 'force', 'siblings', 'have', 'sex', 'camera', 'film', 'then', 'psychological', 'effects', 'siblings.That', 'might', 'make', 'great', 'documentary', 'film', 'even', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'sucks', 'so', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'edgy', 'deep', 'shocking', 'just', 'sucks', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'more', 'sense', 'movie.First', 'off', 'kidnappers', 'are', ""n't"", 'threatening', 'never', 'get', 'sense', ""'re"", 'actually', 'going', 'commit', 'murder', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'kidnappers', 'command', 'Then', 'mentioned', 'kidnappers', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'masks', 'thought', 'maybe', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'identified', 'arrested', 'nope', 'would', 'run', 'risk', 'making', 'film', 'interesting', 'way', 'not', 'do.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'psychological', 'effect', 'terrible', 'event', 'play', 'out', 'kind', 'uncomfortable', 'tension', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'how', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'Daniel', 'literally', 'bulk', 'film', 'avoiding', 'doing', 'anything', 'interesting', 'then', 'end', 'something', 'terrible', 'obviously', 'meant', 'shock', 'sense', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'let', 'crappy', 'unresolved', 'ending', 'slide', 'are', 'likable', 'characters', 'film', 'Even', 'two', 'victims', 'thanks', 'shoddy', 'storytelling', 'become', 'very', 'unlikable', 'end', 'one', 'actions', 'other', 'inactions', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'angry', 'stupid', 'actually', 'having', 'sat', 'not', 'trashy', 'Hollywood', 'CGI', 'films', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'movies', 'can', 'make', 'fun', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'dead', 'serious.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'much', 'more', 'meaningful', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'was', '95', 'minutes', 'life', 'one']",N/A

Daniel tentatively moves forward with his girlfriend. His biggest concern is not owning a car. Ana's problem is that her fiance Rafa has been offered a job in Spain. He wants to take the job; she wants to remain in Mexico City with her family. Then three men kidnap the brother and sister and sexually assault them in a way that makes them feel especially culpable. They are released physically unharmed but in a state of complete shock.The acting is excellent, especially by Marimar Vega as the sexy and confident Ana. The scene in which she and Daniel are kidnapped is chilling and graphic. The also beautiful Dario Yazbeck Bernal successfully conveys Daniel's vulnerability. However, though their initial paralysis is portrayed with painstaking realism, the audience sees absolutely no line between the initial assault and Daniel's eventual actions. His later reaction comes across as unbelievable and sensationalistic. The clueless parents are not at fault, but they are pushed to the background and thus not particularly sympathetic.Clinically shot and scored with overplayed bits of classical music, this attempt to raise awareness about coerced victims of pornography is ostensibly a true story.
