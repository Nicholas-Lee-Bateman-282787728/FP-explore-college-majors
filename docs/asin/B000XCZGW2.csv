The writing is fantastic and really well thought out. I love dramas that have to do with the military and this series does not disappoint.  All of the actors, at some point, get a chance to shine.  Even though the series seemed to be mostly focused on Harm and Mac (David James Elliott and Catherine Bell), each character is given a chance to have a storyline.

It dealt with many issues that were at the forefront of the time, from Kosovo to the issue of gays in the military. Most all of the episodes are entertaining and thought-provoking. Yeah, it is very patriotic but I find nothing wrong with that. In this day, I find the patriotic touch refreshing.David James Elliott and Catherine Bell are at their very best, each dealing with cases, relationships and lots of changes throughout the season.

I love how it is current with the year it was made as far as what wars are going on.I think watching this also makes us remember our troops more and all they are doing for us. We can sit and enjoy watching DVD's safe in our homes because they are protecting and defending our freedom.The adventures are so varied and different in each show.
