The movie goes further than the song and tells a lot more about Grandma and her relatives. It'll cheer you up and you'll probably want to watch it every Christmas. The song always makes me feel good and it was great to hear it again.,3,Movie for kids &amp; adults,1013040000,"02 7, 2002",2002,338,"['always', 'loved', 'song', 'why', 'bought', 'video', 'cute', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'further', 'song', 'lot', 'more', 'Grandma', 'relatives', ""'ll"", 'cheer', 'up', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'song', 'always', 'feel', 'good', 'was', 'great', 'hear', 'again']",Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer VHS

It actually stays pretty loyal to the song of the same name, minus the implication that ""Grandma"" was killed when she got run over by a reindeer.  It's a sweet modern-day tale complete with a perfect happy ending.  My one question is:  did the head elf really have to sound like a British butler?  I feel like there's a stereotype in there somewhere.  Other than that, I recommend this film to any Christmas fanatic out there.

121642,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,079075181X,Stephen Verhaeren,"[3, 17]","Grandma got run over by a reindeer is this animated story of a song that was recorded in 1982, and yet this animated story has a couple of things diffrent from the song. (1) Grandma owns a store. (2) She is walking to a store when she gets run over by a reindeer. (3) There is a famiy member that hates Grandma and wants her store sold. (4) In this cartoon story the police are called and Grandma's body is not found and the scene that said she was found in the song. (5) A boy witness that all happening, and the song so doesn't sound like to me that Grandma was witnessed getting run over by a reindeer. (6) Grandma is missing and still is in September of the following year. There should be more things here that are diffrent in the song but I won't spoil it for you, if you do decide to watch this garbage. Grandma Spankenneimer (Susan Blu) owns this store. She reads stories to kids while thier parents shop. But then this young rich man that comes in and gets dressed as a troll to see Grandma to try to buy the place and her grandson Jake (Alex Doduk) tells her not to sell the store and she doesn't which angers Jake's cousin Mel (Michelle Lee). So she puts some bad stuffi  grandma' food and when she walks to a store she gets run over by a reindeer.",1,You will be disappointed,1039737600,"12 13, 2002",2002,1259,"['Grandma', 'got', 'run', 'over', 'reindeer', 'animated', 'story', 'song', 'was', 'recorded', '1982', 'yet', 'animated', 'story', 'couple', 'things', 'diffrent', 'song', '1', 'Grandma', 'store', '2', 'walking', 'store', 'when', 'run', 'over', 'reindeer', '3', 'famiy', 'member', 'Grandma', 'store', 'sold', '4', 'cartoon', 'story', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'Grandma', 'body', 'not', 'found', 'scene', 'said', 'was', 'found', 'song', '5', 'boy', 'witness', 'happening', 'song', 'so', ""n't"", 'sound', 'Grandma', 'was', 'witnessed', 'getting', 'run', 'over', 'reindeer', '6', 'Grandma', 'missing', 'still', 'September', 'following', 'year', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'things', 'here', 'are', 'diffrent', 'song', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'do', 'decide', 'watch', 'garbage', 'Grandma', 'Spankenneimer', 'Susan', 'Blu', 'store', 'stories', 'kids', 'thier', 'parents', 'shop', 'then', 'young', 'rich', 'man', 'dressed', 'troll', 'see', 'Grandma', 'try', 'buy', 'place', 'grandson', 'Jake', 'Alex', 'Doduk', 'not', 'sell', 'store', ""n't"", 'angers', 'Jake', 'cousin', 'Mel', 'Michelle', 'Lee', 'bad', 'stuffi', 'grandma', 'food', 'when', 'walks', 'store', 'run', 'over', 'reindeer']",Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer VHS
