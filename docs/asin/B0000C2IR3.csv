But he is absolutely smoldering in this movie and is definately the reason to watch it again and again. You may think I'm overstating his charisma, but wait until you see him in this film!This movie is very romantic and has only a few gunfight scenes in it.  There are even a few laughs in the story. One of the best scenes is where Tim Daly bursts into a barn with both his guns pointed....at sheep!Naomi Watts is terrific as the Amish widow who falls in love with Tim Daly's character.  She really does look ""plain"" in this movie, but she comes across very realistically.  Both actors did a great job.So, what are you waiting for?  Go buy the movie.

The box makes it look like it's gonna be one wild action western. Unfortunately, it was based on a romance novel and you can tell. There are maybe five minutes of action in the film. A cattle baron is trying to run folks off his land with a group of men. However, when the final showdown occurs, only 3 men show up to face Tim Daly. As you might expect this doesn't make for a very action-packed piece. If you're more into character-driven stories though, you will probably like it. Yes, it's nice to see Daly's character change from the killer to the father-figure. It's just hard to picture Naomi Watts as a lusty Amish woman.

I was excited but also a little worried when I saw a movie had been made based on the novel.  Movie adaptations don't always do justice to the original materials.I thought the outlaw Johnny Gault (Johnny Cain in the book) was played very well by Tim Daly - a lot of depth to a complicated character played with finesse and charisma.  I didn't like Naomi Watts as well playing Rebecca Yoder (Rachel in the book).  I know she played a Plain woman in the movie but that doesn't have to mean colorless.  Daly definitely dominated this movie.As with any adaptation, sections are going to be excluded for expediency's sake but I wish there were a few areas explored a bit more:  the romantic interest of the neighbor, the origin of Gault's wound, the interplay between Rebbecca and her family, especially her mother.But overall the movie was done very well.  The cinematography was gorgeous as well as the Australian locations.  I enjoyed seeing John Noble in the movie - quite a change from his roles as Denethor in the LOTR trilogy and Walter Bishop in the television show ""Fringe"".  The movie score was haunting and beautiful.One major drawback for me was that this movie does not have closed captioning.

Thanks to the great screenplay, excellent direction by Randa Haines, beautiful, haunting music, and stupendous scenery (filmed in Australia), not to mention an amazing cast, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.  The starring roles of Johnny Gault, Rebecca Yoder, and the boy, Benjo, were expertly cast.  Tim Daly's performance was extremely riveting.  I've always enjoyed his performances, but this one outshines anything he's ever done.  Ms. Haines' direction, with close ups on Tim's face, was ingenious.  Tim does a great physical performance as a shootist, but it's that face and those blue eyes expressing a thousand emotions that catch the breath. This hurt, bitter, and hardened man is slowly changed by the kindness, goodness, and inner beauty of a winsome young woman and her son.  Just as important, in Johnny's love Rebecca finds a freedom from the ridged religious life of the Amish that she had thought righteous. Naomi Watts gives a perfectly balanced performance, as she exudes true goodness, love, and compassion.  Rebecca is seduced by Johnny's vulnerability and sense of humor and does not, in the end, deny the reality of the love she has for the deeply hidden need to be loved, trusted, and aching longing for ""home"" in this man.  A classic story of how two people in any kind of relationship can have an amazing impact on each other.  An unusual western classic in the genre of HBO's ""The Jack Bull"".

Western stories have always been one of my favorite movies and books.  This  one (The Outsider staring Tim Daly and Naomi Watts) follows a similar theme found in other classic movies.  Two that come to mind is the John Wayne classic The Angel and the Bad Man and Witness by Harrison Ford. This is a story about a some religious settlers who keep getting harassed by four cattle men bad guys.  After they hang the husband  of one woman (Naomi Watts) and she is forced to run her sheep ranch with her young son, a strange unknown man (The Outsider) walking stumbles onto her ranch.He has been shot (we never find out the specific circumstances) and she nurses him back to health with a doctor's help played by David Carradine.  As it turns out the mysterious outsider (Johnny Gault) is a professional gunman.  As time goes by they fall in love with each other and the religious group shuns her.  The only real gun action happens once inside a saloon in town and at the end when Gault winds up killing the other three bad guys in town.In conclusion, this was an okay western which I enjoyed watching it.

However, I am a great fan of Naomi Watts so I decided to watch it figuring I could always eject.  This is two movies in one-a violent western and a charming romance-but it works really well.This movie owes its fish-out-of-water plot to the 1950s Angel and the Badman which first recounted the story as a gunslinger and a Quaker lass.  The plot reappears in the early 1980s as Witness with a big city cop and a lovely Amish widow and son.  The Outsider has a beautiful Amish widow Rebecca Yoder(Watts), whose husband is murdered by cattleman who want their land, who develops feelings for a gravely wounded ""shootist"" named Johnny Gault (Tim Daly) whom she nurses him back to health to the disapproval of almost everyone.The bearded and very sexy Daly nails his character perfectly, Watts is wonderful and their chemistry is just great!  The movie is filmed on location in New Zealand which passes nicely for Montana (ironically Australian Peter Weir came to the US to direct Witness).The movie compelled me to read the Penelope Williamson novel.  Overall the movie is better edited than the book.  However (and these are minor quibbles), there some plot omissions that in my opinion would add richness to the film.  The viewer never learns the circumstances that led up to Gault being severely wounded and stumbling up on the Yoder farm in the first place! The movie's finale has been motified somewhat and I think that the novel gives a stronger character arc to the shootist.

I have to say I love both movies for the same reasons.  Faith and love can get you through any hardship you might face.Johnny Gault is a world weary gunslinger who believes in his gun and nothing else. Rebecca Yodder belongs to a religious sect (The Plain People) who have strict rules for women and shun anything that may lead them to shame - including any kind of music.Rebecca's husband is murdered and her son and brother harassed by the local sheriff and his men for her land.  Johnny arrives out of nowhere and drops near death at her feet. She tends to him and he stays to help with the sheep and the farm.The difference between Angel and the Badman and The Outsider, is that you actually see Rebecca's family and the community shun her as she begins to question her love for Johnny and the freedom it brings. At the same time, Johnny must deal with his past and with the present issue of the sheriff and his men threatening his newly adopted family.What I really loved about this movie is the rhythm the director gave it with the hours and chores of the day, the beautiful score, and the stunning cinematography. Randa Haines (Children of a Lesser God, Hill Street Blues, The Ron Clark Story) assembled a cast that provides the emotional tension and drama that makes this movie worth watching. The chemistry between Daly and Watts is on target, and Daly will definitely make your heart beat a little faster.  Keith Carradine plays a suitor and David Carradine plays the town doctor. John Noble (Lord of the Rings) plays the sheriff.If you enjoy collecting westerns, especially romantic ones - this one is a keeper.A bit of trivia: The haunting music you hear in the background of the movie is mostly Norwegian folk songs. Two of the songs sung - Bla Tonar Fra Lom and Jenta I Sauflokken can be found on the Nordisk Sang CD featuring various artists.  There were no known Norwegian settlements in the US that were Amish, Mennonites or Quakers. Norwegian settlers were most likely Lutheran.  The beautiful music still fits the movie and the mood.

But, having both main characters emerge from critical injuries which the town doctor (David Carradine) says they cannot survive seems a bit much.  But, in this movie, love triumphs over greediness and religious fundamentalism.  It is also sad to see both David and Keith Carradine in such meaningless roles.

772950,AK61LQI92GTCH,B0000C2IR3,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[26, 30]","This sturdy rehash of a popular Hollywood plot chronicles the changes wrought when a recently widowed Quaker woman (Naomi Watts) takes in a desperately wounded shootist (Tim Daly.) Although THE OUSIDER, a 2002 Showtime production, credits Penelope Williamson as the author of the book this movie is based on, it sure looks a lot like James Edward Grant's 1947 `Angel and the Badman,' another movie about a Quaker woman nursing a bad man back to health.  Maybe to deflect comparisons the movie never refers to Watts' religion as Quaker.  Instead they are simply `the plain people.'  In any event, the set-up is simple and solid, and if `plot' can be defined as opposites in conflict seeking resolution, the plot elements here include; spiritual woman vs. physical man, sheep ranchers vs. cattle ranchers, a closed religious community vs. the free expression of individual love.Those familiar with the Gail Russell/John Wayne movie will recognize the bonding going on between this angel and bad man, albeit updated to appeal to the new century. For instance, in `Angel and the Badman' Wayne's character is bent on revenge and his story predominates, while here the movie is told primarily from Watts' point of view.  Gunplay is significantly downplayed in THE OUTSIDER, while lambing, rescuing sheep from boggy ponds, and scenes featuring a shirtless Daly writhing in a sweaty fever on the gentle widder's bed are highlighted.  THE OUTSIDER is saturated with golden, Hallmark moments of calm, punctuated by the occasional muted scene of violence when, say, a handful of ranch rowdies ride out to scare the widow's young son, or the scenes that show what happens when the two leads are overwhelmed by the savage yearnings of their unfilled passions.  Hmmm... maybe `savage yearnings' is a bit awkward, but my romance-novel patter is severely limited.I'm not a consumer of romances, but I am an omnivore when it comes to westerns.  I haven't seen many westerns, this side of Sleaze Row, that tell their story from the woman's point of view.  The danger really ought to be coming from the nasty cattle ranch owner.  Rather, the biggest threat here comes from widower Keith Carradine, buried beyond recognition under a floppy leather hat and behind a blond, Farmer John beard.  Conveniently enough, he too is a widower with a young son to raise and a pious willingness to make many more young `uns.  When it's a knockout like Naomi Watts under that linen bonnet who can blame him? If he's bland as a slab of flat bread, he's also safe and acceptable to the widow's all encompassing and all-important `plain people' community.  By the way, Keith's brother David Carradine stars in this one, too, as a rye whiskey drinking town doc with a fine touch for sliding a flattened slug off a patient's vital organ.Although I was a little thrown off by a western that dealt with some unfamiliar topics for an action genre,  with the sincere performances of Watts and Daly, and the generally realistic subject and treatment, THE OUTSIDER was surprisingly entertaining.",4,Good western told from a woman's point of view,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,3051,"['sturdy', 'rehash', 'popular', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'changes', 'wrought', 'when', 'recently', 'widowed', 'Quaker', 'woman', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'desperately', 'wounded', 'shootist', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'THE', 'OUSIDER', '2002', 'Showtime', 'production', 'credits', 'Penelope', 'Williamson', 'author', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'sure', 'lot', 'James', 'Edward', 'Grant', '1947', 'Angel', 'Badman', 'movie', 'Quaker', 'woman', 'nursing', 'bad', 'man', 'back', 'health', 'Maybe', 'deflect', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'never', 'refers', 'Watts', 'religion', 'Quaker', 'Instead', 'are', 'simply', 'plain', 'people', 'event', 'set-up', 'simple', 'solid', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'defined', 'opposites', 'conflict', 'seeking', 'resolution', 'plot', 'elements', 'here', 'include', 'spiritual', 'woman', 'vs.', 'physical', 'man', 'sheep', 'ranchers', 'vs.', 'cattle', 'ranchers', 'closed', 'religious', 'community', 'free', 'expression', 'individual', 'love.Those', 'familiar', 'Gail', 'Russell/John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'will', 'recognize', 'bonding', 'going', 'angel', 'bad', 'man', 'albeit', 'updated', 'appeal', 'new', 'century', 'instance', 'Angel', 'Badman', 'Wayne', 'character', 'bent', 'revenge', 'story', 'predominates', 'here', 'movie', 'told', 'primarily', 'Watts', 'point', 'view', 'Gunplay', 'significantly', 'downplayed', 'THE', 'OUTSIDER', 'lambing', 'rescuing', 'sheep', 'boggy', 'ponds', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'shirtless', 'Daly', 'writhing', 'sweaty', 'fever', 'gentle', 'widder', 'bed', 'are', 'highlighted', 'OUTSIDER', 'saturated', 'golden', 'Hallmark', 'moments', 'calm', 'punctuated', 'occasional', 'muted', 'scene', 'violence', 'when', 'say', 'handful', 'ranch', 'rowdies', 'ride', 'scare', 'widow', 'young', 'son', 'scenes', 'show', 'what', 'when', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'savage', 'yearnings', 'unfilled', 'passions', 'Hmmm', 'maybe', 'savage', 'yearnings', 'bit', 'awkward', 'romance-novel', 'patter', 'severely', 'limited.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'consumer', 'romances', 'am', 'omnivore', 'when', 'westerns', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'westerns', 'side', 'Sleaze', 'Row', 'tell', 'story', 'woman', 'point', 'view', 'danger', 'really', 'ought', 'be', 'coming', 'nasty', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'owner', 'Rather', 'biggest', 'threat', 'here', 'widower', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'buried', 'recognition', 'floppy', 'leather', 'hat', 'blond', 'Farmer', 'John', 'beard', 'Conveniently', 'enough', 'too', 'widower', 'young', 'son', 'raise', 'pious', 'willingness', 'make', 'many', 'more', 'young', 'uns', 'When', 'knockout', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'linen', 'bonnet', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'bland', 'slab', 'flat', 'bread', 'also', 'safe', 'acceptable', 'widow', 'encompassing', 'all-important', 'plain', 'people', 'community', 'way', 'Keith', 'brother', 'David', 'Carradine', 'one', 'too', 'rye', 'whiskey', 'drinking', 'town', 'doc', 'fine', 'touch', 'sliding', 'flattened', 'slug', 'patient', 'vital', 'was', 'little', 'thrown', 'off', 'western', 'dealt', 'unfamiliar', 'topics', 'action', 'genre', 'sincere', 'performances', 'Watts', 'Daly', 'generally', 'realistic', 'subject', 'treatment', 'THE', 'OUTSIDER', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining']",N/A

In this movie, I so loved, the pretty outdoor scenes, and Rebecca's pretty log cabin, with all those beautiful, colorful quilts, that was on the beds.This story is about a beautiful, young widow, who is a Quaker, her name is Rebecca (Naomi Watts), and her son is BenJo, they live alone, on their isolated farm, tending their sheep, and they come upon a  badly, gunshot, wounded outlaw(Johnny Gault), bleeding and hurt,  in the snow. And Rebecca helps him, and in return, Johnny ends up protecting, and  helping her, and her son, from the men who killed her husband. These men killed her husband because they wanted her husband's land. Johnny and Rebecca fall in love, and Johnny sees a side of life, that he never had a chance to belong to before. And Rebecca was afraid to love Johnny, because of her strict life as a Quaker, and because her father, and brothers, who are also Quakers, they considered Johnny a outsider.My favorite scenes in the movie was when, Johnny the tough outlaw was holding the baby lamb! And the gentle way, that he was with Rebecca's son. I loved the scene where Rebecca was shaving Johnny's beard.

772954,A1E0RPGCXS4L2G,B0000C2IR3,TheHighlander,"[40, 42]","This is the typical cattlemen versus sheep herders, Amish versus English, good versus evil type of movie, the age old battles.A vulnerable woman who just lost her husband, a curious little boy and an outlaw make of the core characters in this movie.  The outlaw is not your typically outlaw though.  Sure, he has no one to love, no one who loves him and nothing to lose, but he has a good heart.The movie kept my interest and in many ways was intriguing.  The interaction of folks from totally different view points.  The different perceptions.  The tension between men interested in the same woman.  The fact that folks are not always as they appear to be on the outside or what others perceive them to be.  How caring for someone can take you way outside your normal realm.  All these facets were presented in this movie in both subtle and not so subtle ways.I'm not sure really what it was about this movie that sucked me in.  The loner?  The protector?  The connection of two souls?  The love of a lone man for a child?  The ""us against them"" attitude?  How folks see me, sometimes, hard nosed on the outside but not the softy on the inside.  The question, can love reform or change a man?  Fighting with ones own past and inner demons?  Whatever it was it really kept my interest.The sexual tension of what is left unsaid in this movie is well portrayed.  The characters are explored deeply although the exploration is subtle.  I found myself enjoying the movie a great deal and wondering why I had never heard of it before.

The story is a classic, the casting excellent & the setting breath-taking.  Tim Daly shines as Johnny Gault, the dangerous gun-slinger with a troubled past who is taken in by an Amish widow--well-played by Naomi Watts--after being shot.  This is a good film for fans of westerns & love stories, the chemistry between the main characters is great & the rest of the cast are good as well.
