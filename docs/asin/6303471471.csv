376363,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303471471,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Gorky Park, 1983 filmThis mystery novel set in Russia was written by an American and filmed in Finland. (Is that like a mystery novel set in New York written by a Russian and filmed in Spain?) Two policemen find three bodies. Their faces were cut from their heads to hide their identities! [They can be reconstructed.] ""You don't want this case."" A professional killing (shot in head and heart). Chief Investigator Arkady Renko reports to his superior. ""You don't miss something until you want it."" They try to recreate the crime. How could it happen? The teeth identify the nationality of one victim. Renko is invited to a country house. He talks about the case. Then he returns by car. No heater? [Really?] Renko visits a Professor who can restore the features on a face. Renko visits an amusement park at night; the bank plays foreign music. [Cultural colonialism?] A suspicious man hops a train to get away. We later find out who he is. Will they make a deal?Renko meets that American businessman in a health spa. Mr. Jack Osborne imports very valuable Russian sable fur into America. Renko reads a secret file frm the KGB. A suspect is brought in for questioning; third-degree tactics make him tell all. We see his room packed with merchandise, then there is a surprise. Another murder mystery to solve. Who are those men following Irina? Will someone rescue Renko? Can Irina be saved from a ""hot shot""? Yes, but she chooses not to talk. Later Renko meets Jack Osborne in a restaurant. They talk. Renko meets the NY detective again, who found out things. Irina begins to open up. Renko recreates the crime for Irina. Does a fantasy control her thinking? Will the shock get her to talk? Yes. Will Osborne act to destroy the recreation? Yes. Will a comrade betray Renko? Yes.Renko meets his superior in that spa. He has a Luger and a miniature tape recorder. There is a struggle and a shot. What will Renko do in Stockholm? There is another surprise in that house. Renko shows some emotion now. [Believable?] Why would Osborne trade six live sables for Renko? There is a secret. [Does the film begin to drag here?] Renko considers what can happen. There is a meeting in the woods. There is talk, then shooting. More bodies fall on the ground. There is a dramatic meeting, then more shooting. Will justice be done? ""Love will get you free."" Will there be a happy ending? [What about those bodies in the woods? Littering the environment?] ""One day.""This story has a high body count, like a Mickey Spillane or Ian Fleming novel. The book and movie got a lot of publicity, but this could just be paid advertising for a movie with a message. It is just below average for a murder mystery. Was the book better than the movie? Its last hour seems overly plotted and incredible. The fact about recreating faces from skulls goes back to the 1960s. This movie claims that Lada compact sedan has no heater. Incredible! The Lada was exported to Finland and Canada, cold climates where a simple and rugged automobile is very useful on unpaved roads. Can this or any car be driven in very cold climates if it does not have a heater and defroster for the windshield? No. The Lada was based on a Fiat automobile.",2,A Murder Mystery About Smuggling,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,3199,"['Gorky', 'Park', '1983', 'filmThis', 'mystery', 'novel', 'set', 'Russia', 'was', 'written', 'American', 'filmed', 'Finland', 'mystery', 'novel', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'written', 'Russian', 'filmed', 'Spain', 'Two', 'policemen', 'find', 'three', 'bodies', 'were', 'cut', 'heads', 'hide', 'identities', 'can', 'be', 'reconstructed', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'case', 'professional', 'killing', 'shot', 'head', 'heart', 'Chief', 'Investigator', 'Arkady', 'Renko', 'reports', 'superior', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'something', 'want', 'try', 'recreate', 'crime', 'How', 'could', 'happen', 'teeth', 'identify', 'nationality', 'one', 'victim', 'Renko', 'invited', 'country', 'house', 'case', 'Then', 'car', 'heater', '[', 'Really', ']', 'Renko', 'Professor', 'who', 'can', 'restore', 'features', 'face', 'Renko', 'amusement', 'park', 'night', 'bank', 'foreign', 'music', '[', 'Cultural', 'colonialism', ']', 'suspicious', 'man', 'train', 'get', 'away', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'make', 'deal', 'Renko', 'American', 'businessman', 'health', 'spa', 'Mr.', 'Jack', 'Osborne', 'imports', 'very', 'valuable', 'Russian', 'sable', 'fur', 'America', 'Renko', 'secret', 'file', 'frm', 'KGB', 'suspect', 'brought', 'questioning', 'third-degree', 'tactics', 'make', 'tell', 'see', 'room', 'packed', 'merchandise', 'then', 'surprise', 'murder', 'mystery', 'solve', 'Who', 'are', 'men', 'following', 'Irina', 'Will', 'someone', 'rescue', 'Renko', 'Can', 'Irina', 'be', 'saved', 'hot', 'shot', 'Yes', 'not', 'talk', 'Later', 'Renko', 'Jack', 'Osborne', 'restaurant', 'talk', 'Renko', 'NY', 'detective', 'again', 'who', 'found', 'out', 'things', 'Irina', 'open', 'up', 'Renko', 'crime', 'Irina', 'fantasy', 'control', 'thinking', 'Will', 'shock', 'get', 'talk', 'Yes', 'Will', 'Osborne', 'act', 'destroy', 'recreation', 'Yes', 'Will', 'comrade', 'betray', 'Renko', 'Yes.Renko', 'superior', 'spa', 'Luger', 'miniature', 'tape', 'recorder', 'struggle', 'shot', 'What', 'will', 'Renko', 'do', 'Stockholm', 'surprise', 'house', 'Renko', 'emotion', 'now', 'Believable', ']', 'Why', 'would', 'Osborne', 'trade', 'six', 'live', 'sables', 'Renko', 'secret', '[', 'film', 'begin', 'drag', 'here', ']', 'Renko', 'considers', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'meeting', 'woods', 'talk', 'then', 'shooting', 'More', 'bodies', 'fall', 'ground', 'dramatic', 'meeting', 'then', 'more', 'shooting', 'Will', 'justice', 'be', 'done', 'Love', 'will', 'get', 'free', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', '[', 'What', 'bodies', 'woods', 'Littering', 'environment', 'One', 'day', 'story', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'Mickey', 'Spillane', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novel', 'book', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'publicity', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'paid', 'advertising', 'movie', 'message', 'just', 'below', 'average', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Was', 'book', 'better', 'movie', 'last', 'hour', 'overly', 'plotted', 'incredible', 'fact', 'recreating', 'skulls', 'back', '1960s', 'movie', 'Lada', 'compact', 'sedan', 'heater', 'Incredible', 'Lada', 'was', 'exported', 'Finland', 'Canada', 'cold', 'climates', 'where', 'simple', 'rugged', 'automobile', 'very', 'useful', 'unpaved', 'roads', 'Can', 'car', 'be', 'driven', 'very', 'cold', 'climates', 'not', 'have', 'heater', 'defroster', 'windshield', 'No', 'Lada', 'was', 'based', 'Fiat', 'automobile']",Gorky Park VHS

There are a couple of other things that make this movie stand out. First, the acting. I think this has got to be one of Lee Marvin's best performances. He absolutley commands the screen. William Hurt plays the part of a Soviet cop. When in scenes with Marvin, Hurt's character is shown to be provincial and unsophisticated. Part of the way this is shown is in Hurt's display of envy at Marvin's character's ability to say the right thing, dress the right way, and so on. Hurt is playing a part (and doing it very well), but I wonder if there wasn't some back handed paying of tribute to Marvin.The second thing that sets this movie apart is the fact that Dennis Potter has the writing credit.

376366,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,6303471471,Bert vanC Bailey,"[1, 1]","Some things Hollywood does well, and this 1983 thriller was done very well.Starting with the cast: William Hurt's a fine actor, and who can go wrong with the commanding, silver-haired Lee Marvin on board? Every menacing speech and gesture is delivered with his usual louche ease, yet his customary onscreen weight. Roger Ebert said about Marvin in this film that, although somewhat typecast, he brought a fully realized character ""...so we don't have to stand around waiting for introductions."" Brian Dennehy manages well in a good secondary role as a sort of out-leagued ex-Marine, misplaced in Moscow but curious to learn what happened to his brother. It's a plum role for Joanna Pacula too, a Polish actress who strikes the right notes with everything from grim cynicism and suspicion of the Soviet cop (Hurt), to her unusual, quite plausibly Muscovite colouring. Ian Bannen is also good in his small part, and even UK comic Alexei Sayle ('Didn't you kill my bruvah?') has a cameo as a weasely, faintly comical black-marketeer.Best of all, Michael Apted's direction never slows down the pace under the weight of detail, very little of which (see comment on Marvin) involves action scenes or shoot-'em-ups. Dennis Potter's tight script won him the 1984 Edgar Award: integral to the proceedings is a cast of absent characters with an involved back-story, but the script is to-the-point, often sharp, and never once dated or embarrassing. James Horner mercifully holds back from his later orchestral exuberance to craft one of his better scores. Also, art directors seldom win prizes for drabness, but if ever there was a candidate, look no further than Ralf G. Bode's work here. From bleak, flowery drapes to rickety Ladas, things have a Soviet, Brezhnevian flavour, before Putin and the spy services took possession of that collapsed empire. This also includes glimpses of the opulent apparatchiks' hangouts, during the times of the gulag of hellish prisons, such as luxurious baths where the coffee tasted fine and the tables were overspilling.Filmed in Helsinki and Stockholm, this is the only Hollywood film in the last half century set in the Soviet Union - along with 'Enemy at the Gates' (2001; with Jude Law and Ed Harris as rival WWII sharpshooters). Its few weak notes include a scene in a lobby where eyes don't meet, then do, and some dialogue near the close, as sentimental as at the end of 'Casablanca' yet impossible to pull off. Apted chose to keep the scene with the former, tiny gaffe; in the latter, he turned the camera away ...yet a re-write and second take might have improved it.This film is intriguing in being as much about the characters as about the plot they move through. Slowly but convincingly the distaste Pacula portrays so well transitions to a quizzical distance from Hurt, the Moscow cop who gradually shocks her, while trying to win her over, with something she cannot accept. This culminates in an extended, well-scripted scene that is one of the film's strongest. And Apted nicely scatters about a few canny hints [spoiler to come: do beware!] suggesting that this will be one of those plots where the one assigning the hero to find the killers is behind the whole caper.Fresh for its day, this trickery's been done to death since, but perhaps not as well. And, most important, Hollywood thrillers have since become producer-driven cash vehicles that zero in on plot and special effects, rather than attending to character.Recommended.",4,Apted at his most intriguing,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3475,"['things', 'Hollywood', 'well', '1983', 'thriller', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well.Starting', 'cast', 'William', 'Hurt', 'fine', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'commanding', 'silver-haired', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'board', 'Every', 'menacing', 'speech', 'gesture', 'delivered', 'usual', 'louche', 'ease', 'yet', 'customary', 'onscreen', 'weight', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'Marvin', 'film', 'somewhat', 'typecast', 'brought', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stand', 'around', 'waiting', 'introductions', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'well', 'good', 'secondary', 'role', 'sort', 'out-leagued', 'ex-Marine', 'misplaced', 'Moscow', 'curious', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'brother', 'plum', 'role', 'Joanna', 'Pacula', 'too', 'Polish', 'actress', 'who', 'right', 'notes', 'everything', 'grim', 'cynicism', 'suspicion', 'Soviet', 'cop', 'Hurt', 'unusual', 'quite', 'plausibly', 'Muscovite', 'colouring', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'also', 'good', 'small', 'part', 'even', 'UK', 'comic', 'Alexei', 'Sayle', ""'Did"", ""n't"", 'kill', 'bruvah', 'cameo', 'weasely', 'faintly', 'comical', 'black-marketeer.Best', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'direction', 'never', 'down', 'pace', 'weight', 'detail', 'very', 'little', 'see', 'comment', 'Marvin', 'action', 'scenes', ""shoot-'em-ups"", 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'tight', 'script', 'won', '1984', 'Edgar', 'Award', 'integral', 'proceedings', 'cast', 'absent', 'characters', 'involved', 'back-story', 'script', 'to-the-point', 'often', 'sharp', 'never', 'once', 'dated', 'embarrassing', 'James', 'Horner', 'mercifully', 'back', 'later', 'orchestral', 'exuberance', 'craft', 'one', 'better', 'scores', 'Also', 'art', 'directors', 'seldom', 'win', 'prizes', 'drabness', 'ever', 'was', 'candidate', 'look', 'further', 'Ralf', 'G.', 'Bode', 'work', 'here', 'bleak', 'flowery', 'drapes', 'rickety', 'Ladas', 'things', 'have', 'Soviet', 'Brezhnevian', 'flavour', 'Putin', 'spy', 'services', 'took', 'possession', 'collapsed', 'empire', 'also', 'glimpses', 'opulent', 'apparatchiks', 'hangouts', 'times', 'gulag', 'hellish', 'prisons', 'such', 'luxurious', 'baths', 'where', 'coffee', 'tasted', 'fine', 'tables', 'were', 'overspilling.Filmed', 'Helsinki', 'Stockholm', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'last', 'half', 'century', 'set', 'Soviet', 'Union', ""'Enemy"", 'Gates', '2001', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'rival', 'WWII', 'sharpshooters', 'few', 'weak', 'notes', 'include', 'scene', 'lobby', 'where', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'then', 'do', 'dialogue', 'close', 'sentimental', 'end', ""'Casablanca"", 'yet', 'impossible', 'pull', 'off', 'Apted', 'chose', 'keep', 'scene', 'former', 'tiny', 'gaffe', 'latter', 'turned', 'camera', 'away', 'yet', 're-write', 'second', 'take', 'might', 'have', 'improved', 'it.This', 'film', 'intriguing', 'being', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'plot', 'move', 'Slowly', 'convincingly', 'distaste', 'Pacula', 'so', 'well', 'transitions', 'quizzical', 'distance', 'Hurt', 'Moscow', 'cop', 'who', 'gradually', 'trying', 'win', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'extended', 'well-scripted', 'scene', 'one', 'film', 'strongest', 'Apted', 'nicely', 'few', 'canny', 'hints', '[', 'spoiler', 'come', 'do', 'beware', ']', 'suggesting', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'plots', 'where', 'one', 'assigning', 'hero', 'find', 'killers', 'whole', 'caper.Fresh', 'day', 'trickery', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'important', 'Hollywood', 'thrillers', 'have', 'become', 'producer-driven', 'cash', 'vehicles', 'zero', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'attending', 'character.Recommended']",Gorky Park VHS
376367,A2YM9ILTAX0782,6303471471,"Birt Acres ""Cinemaniac""","[0, 0]","""Gorky Park"" (1983) came out when I was in the eighth grade.  I remember being interested in the movie (which, of course, I thought I would never see, being a young boy who couldn't even conceive of watching an R-rated movie).  At the time the Soviet Union was still alive and breathing, and fears of war and nuclear war were not unknown.  The iron curtain was a dark, vague spot in my imagination.  Given my memories, the film is a disappointment.  Rather than dealing with the Soviet Union's politics, the film is little more than a murder mystery with the novelty of taking place in the USSR.  But even that novelty is unexploited:  we get little insight into Soviet life.  And even the cinematography, which should have celebrated the location, is pedestrian and boring.  Indeed, this film could have taken place anywhere.  When a filmmaker has a basic story line, such as a murder-mystery, he should set his story in a location familiar to his audience.  At the very least the audience then concentrates on the story, and there is the added benefit that the story might be more gripping given that it happens ""close to home.""  But when you set a movie in a curious location--and the Soviet Union in the Eighties was very curious--then the audience expects that this location will somehow be critical to the telling of the story.  ""Gorky Park,"" although mildly entertaining, is a disappointment in that regard.The plot revolves around a police inspector who finds three dead and mutilated bodies in Gorky Park.  The KGB is almost instantly on the scene, which raises the inspector's curiosity and fear.  He begins to uncover a plot that involves an American businessman and his attempt to smuggle live sable out of the country (Russia being the only country with sable).",3,"Not Bad, But Something of a Disappointment",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,1774,"['Gorky', 'Park', '1983', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'eighth', 'grade', 'remember', 'being', 'interested', 'movie', 'course', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'being', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'conceive', 'watching', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'time', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'breathing', 'fears', 'war', 'nuclear', 'war', 'were', 'not', 'unknown', 'iron', 'curtain', 'was', 'dark', 'vague', 'spot', 'imagination', 'Given', 'memories', 'film', 'disappointment', 'Rather', 'dealing', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'politics', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'murder', 'mystery', 'novelty', 'taking', 'place', 'USSR', 'even', 'novelty', 'unexploited', 'get', 'little', 'insight', 'Soviet', 'life', 'even', 'cinematography', 'should', 'have', 'celebrated', 'location', 'pedestrian', 'boring', 'Indeed', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'anywhere', 'When', 'filmmaker', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'such', 'murder-mystery', 'should', 'set', 'story', 'location', 'familiar', 'audience', 'very', 'least', 'audience', 'then', 'story', 'added', 'benefit', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'gripping', 'given', 'close', 'home', 'when', 'set', 'movie', 'curious', 'location', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Eighties', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'then', 'audience', 'location', 'will', 'somehow', 'be', 'critical', 'telling', 'story', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'disappointment', 'regard.The', 'plot', 'around', 'police', 'inspector', 'who', 'three', 'dead', 'mutilated', 'bodies', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'KGB', 'almost', 'instantly', 'scene', 'inspector', 'curiosity', 'fear', 'uncover', 'plot', 'American', 'businessman', 'attempt', 'smuggle', 'live', 'sable', 'country', 'Russia', 'being', 'only', 'country', 'sable']",Gorky Park VHS

Arkady Renko, an honest, slightly obsessive Russian cop, is assigned to the case. He sets out to identify the bodies by reconstructing their faces, and as he gets closer he finds obstructions in his path. He finds a girl (Joanna Pacula) who was friends of the trio, a wealthy and ruthless American (Lee Marvin), an American cop (Brian Dennehy) out for blood, and more than he probably wants to know about sable coats and the animals they're made from. It becomes clear that corrupt higher-ups are involved in something with greater stakes than solving a triple murder. Hurt and Marvin do great jobs and are well matched.This is a tight, very well constructed police procedural that is a little exotic, with the cops and functionaries being Russians. It's also a bit gloomy with a bittersweet ending, but it still works as a very watchable film. A lot of the outdoor shots were filmed in Helsinki, and the movie takes place in the winter.

376370,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,6303471471,C. Rothlind,"[3, 3]","I was determined to like this film. I love the idea of a Soviet setting in winter time; respect Michael Apted; enjoy Lee Marvin; and found Hurt intriguing in Body Heat. I wanted to like it to prove all the critics wrong who complained the film doesn't gel, and was not put off by the widely reported absence of tension as I'm not into suspense and love a good Largo. Having at long last seen the film I have to admit the critics had a point. I've learned that certain kinds of stories are sustained or defeated by the mood directors create or fail to create.The show begins intriguingly enough with the night-time discovery of corpses buried in the snow, but fails to build on the sense of mystery. Time and again Gorky Park falls flat, as if Apted was determined not to exploit the requirements of the genera (momentum and a sense of high stakes). Is there a clearer indication of a thriller's failure than not to keep the audience guessing? Keeping them confused just isn't the same thing.Gorky Park's pacing/editing is rudimentary. I'm all for minimalism in films, eshewing the frenetically paced cinema verite fare popular these days. But a stately cadence is not the same as a narration that slackens at every turn. As Melville's astounding Army of Shadows demonstrates, it's quite possible to reconcile suspense with a measured, deliberate pace. Achieving that seems to be one of the things that sets the master filmmaker apart from his epigoni and apprentices. If for nothing else, Gorky Park is worth watching for what it fails to achieve; as an object lesson in the unthrilling thriller.Jame Horner's score is a mix of the jarring and the schmaltzy. The first quality, rather than increasing the tension, is as annoying as the schmaltz is cloying. Compare Army of Shadows, where the entire film is haunted by a few chords heard only at the very beginning. Chords that remain in memory as pregnantly as the film itself and seem to distill its very essence.I place the blame squarely on the shoulders of Apted and his editor. Apted may very well simply lack the aptitude for drama, being of a more analytical, humanistic temperament. But William Hurt, inhabiting an affective void and evincing none of the easy charisma of his turn in Body Heat, also lets us down. He never seems to get inside his character in a way that draws us in. His darkened hair and blanched face make him look like a silent film star, an artificiality that compounds the sense of distance and inauthenticity. Whatever the professional relationship between the two, their artistic collaboration failed to make sparks.Lee Marvin for his part is, well--Lee Marvin. When you have a personality as over-sized as his you can afford to deliver lines without thinking too much about who you're supposed to be channeling. But the discrepancy between his personality and the slightness of Hurt's was glaring and further underscored the sense of things not melding. To meld is to add up to a magnitude that seems irreducible to the parts of the totality.A certain gratuitousness haunts the entire film. The scene where the remains of a defaced skull are being picked clean by worms and one of obligatory sex both impressed me as unnecessary concessions. Add-ons rather than integral.On the plus side, the DVD transfer is very good. I'm pretty particular about sharpness and have not complaints in that department.

Were it not ""just"" an entertainment, the film would have been Oscar material like the esteemed ""Doctor Zhivago."" William Hurt does his best work here. Something about his boyish anti-sexuality works here, as he plays the ""good"" communist, a loyal subject of a corrupt system.

Together they offer a mismatch and conflict equal to Jack Nicholson's famous conflict with John Huston in the incomparable ""Chinatown."" The author succeeded beyond reason in capturing the seediness of Communism on its last legs; the movie does the book one better, showing in stunning photography the gorgeous Russian winter, the fabulous comforts of communism's insiders and the despair and desperation of those not invited to the party.

I was always curious about it, but it took me 20+ years to get around to seeing it.  When I finally did, I felt that I may as well have waited another 20 years.Without a doubt, this has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  It seems like every minor point in the plot is dragged out more & more.  The plot is very convoluted (to say the least!) and by the end of the film I really didn't care anymore who did what (or why).  In short, this was a DVD where I looked FORWARD to the final credits.The movie basically has 2 ""selling points.""  The first is the shock-value of 3 people not only being murdered but having their faces sliced off.  And yes, for those interested, the film-makers milk this grotesque feature of the plot for all it's worth.The second selling point is Joanna Pacula.  She is beautiful and perfect as the Russian girl Irina.  I don't know if she has any Russian blood in here, but she's VERY believable portraying a woman in the former Soviet Union.  She even sounds Russian.  She also looks terrific without her shirt on, but the viewer has to sit thru 2+ hours to get to that part, and it's a very quick scene.  (((((((sigh)))))If you're a die-hard murder mystery fan, this movie might be for you.  If you go bonkers over all movies that detail the former Soviet Union, this movie might be worth a look.

Through Amazon reviews I noted that some reviewers thought the film was not up to par with the novel.  I ordered it anyway just to see what the directors, writers, etc. came up with.  Well, I guess they tried, but the problems were manifold.  The Amazon.com editorial reviewer hit the nail on the head in his/her comments.  Quite frankly, watching this film, I could barely stay awake.The actors, to give them credit, were up to par despite inferior material.  I did not care for Joanna Pakula's performance because it was just plain dull.  Wikipedia states she was recommended for the role by her at the time boyfriend, Roman Polanski.  It shows, although to give her credit, she did have some theatre training in Poland, and her career continues on in the U.S. to this day.One of the most obvious problems in this great novel downtrodden into a film is that although it takes place in Moscow (does it not?), there are no shots of the city iself.  We get a shot of some nondescript government building, and then back alleys that could be in any country.  When the film moves on to Stockholm, we get to see that lovely city (by the way,  not much of an escape for the heroine from just a next door country, when in the novel she makes a much grander escape to New York).Performances by Brian Dennehy and Lee Marvin really are outstanding.  William Hurt is a fine actor, but he was handicapped by cliches of the script.  Ian Bannen was hardly believable as a Russian government official with an English accent.Take the roller coaster ride of a novel and, in my estimation, don't get curious about the film as I did.

Up to that point, there hadn't been much in the vein of Russian thrillers, and Gorky Park was a departure from the usual Cold War James Bond stereotypical Russian treatment.  But alas, revisiting Gorky Park 25 years later reveals a movie that has dated drastically.  A handsome and refined William Hurt (presumably chosen for his European looks and air) - feels a little stilted in his performance, along with the rest of the cast.  I have to agree that there doesn't seem to be much tension in the pacing or story.  What seemed cryptic and exotic back then in the theater feel a little underwhelming at times here.  And having been to Moscow, the real place feels a lot more brutal than what this movie portrays.  The little Ladas that the cops drive make Moscow feel very much like a small town.Unfortunately as well, we have shows like CSI to thank for increasing the speed of our edits exponentially, which make shows like Gorky Park feel dreadfully 80s (along with the synth soundtrack).

Russia. The grisly murder of three young people sends our protagonist, Inspector Arkady Renko (W. Hurt), on a complex, intertwining mission to find out who and/or what was behind this dastardly crime. As the crime facts unfold, potential suspects begin to surface in the mind of the inspector, suspects that may include American collusion with KGB officials. Maybe not entirely novel on the surface, but the sequences of events and the characterizations set forth are anything but pedestrian.Perhaps the sequences of the facial reconstruction of the 3 victims ""de-skinned"" facial bones and the subsequent deductions provide the impetus for an unusual plot setting. The involvement of the American cop (B. Dennehy), the Siberian beauty and romantic interest (J. Pacula) who wants out of her homeland, the rich American (L. Marvin), the inspector's police buddies, to name a few, provide more than mere tangential plot fodder: the sum of their actions coalesces in the inspector's mind and takes him closer yet to what could be a very inconvenient truth. All this is done cinematically with good pace and little wasted motion.It is noteworthy that most of the so-called Russians are British Isles actors who maintain their native brogue while donning the usual Kossack-like apparel! Yet their histrionic adeptness suffers not and their characterizations come off well. After all, we've seen this type of casting done before, but I don't think we could pull this off in modern Russia. Instead of filming in Finland with British actors, we would be filming in Moscow or St. Pete with Russian actors.Any additional reviewing will get me into the ""spoiler"" category, so I'll just sign off by saying see the movie.

376386,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6303471471,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[23, 27]","&quot;Gorky Park&quot; is based on the novel of the same name by Martin Cruz Smith.  It's a flawed attempt, but otherwise excellent film.  William Hurt plays the hero, Arkady &quot;Arkasha&quot; Renko, a righteous detective with the Moscow Militia, the Soviet capitol's local police force.  His latest case involves three mutilated corpses discovered under a blanket of fresh snow in the woods of Gorky Park.  Renko is barely on the scene when he's joined by KGB Col. Pribluda.  &quot;That could be you one day&quot;, the smiling killer tells Renko.  With little doubt that the case &quot;reeks of KGB&quot; involvement, Renko at first seeks a way to dump the case, thinking it a trap laid against him by the KGB as revenge for Renko's earlier attempts to implicate the grinning KGB colonel in a multiple homicide.  A dogged persistance won't let him drop the case, and he pursues leads that have nothing to do with the KGB - including a one-time student dissident (Joanna Pacula) whose name is scratched into the skates worn by one of the corpses, and Jack Osborne (Lee Marvin), a wealthy American tycoon with an interest in genuine Russian Sables.  Soon, however, Renko finds himself the prey, when a mysterious American, who turns out to be a NYPD Detective (Brian Dennehy), arrives on the scene, convinced that his younger brother may be one of the victims and Renko one of his executioners.  Unclear who he has to fear, especially when his men and his witnesses begin dying, and unsure who to trust, Renko goes practically underground, the American Detective his only real ally.Flawed by a script that ambitiously tries to comprise all of Smith's multi-layered plot, &quot;Park&quot; makes a great go of it.  With the help of the late and great Dennis Potter (&quot;the Singing Detective&quot;, &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;), Michael Apted's superb cast goes a long way to realizing author Smith's vision.  There is the amiably amoral Pribluda and Dennehy as the brutish Detective Kerwill.  Joanna Paculla will break your heart while Lee Marvin is cheery as the rich American who smoothly reaffirms the Soviets' faith in the evil that is the United States.  Hurt's duel of wits with Marvin (Renko wastes little time making the rich American a prime suspect) provides the most tension of the film.  Renko tries to elicit Osbourne's response by comparing the murder of the faceless trio with the American's favorite hobby - a hunt for Sable.  Their exchanges are key because they highlight Osbourne's amorality and his mastery over Renko and the systemic rot of the Soviet hierarchy.  Even minor charachters like Alexi Sayle as Fedor Golodkin and Ian Mcdiarmid as Prof. Andreev are hard to forget.  Golodkin is the cheerily slimy smuggler who informs on Pacula's charachter for the KGB while Andreev, a dry academician with no time for police forensics, reluctantly agrees to reconstruct identities of mutilitated corpses.  Mcdarmid, for his screen time is also fun, especially when meeting Renko and the detective's high-mindedness for the first time.  &quot;I fear that you are not long for this world, my friend&quot;, the dry academician tells Renko, evoking the same foreboding Macdarmid displayed as Darth Vader's boss in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.  I caught a TV cut of the film and the editing was horrible.

376388,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6303471471,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 3]","The movie ""Gorky Park,"" released in 1983, was based on Martin Cruz Smith's phenomenally successful novel of the same name.  It was made well before ""glasnost,"" the Russian willingness to open up; therefore, although set in Russia, it was actually filmed in Finland.  Never mind: Finland looks every bit as cold and snowy to most of us.  ""Gorky Park"" was written by the highly-acclaimed British screenwriter Dennis Potter(""Singing Detective,"" ""Pennies from Heaven""), and its director, well-thought-of Briton Michael Apted (the ""Seven-Up"" series).  The film stars the Americans William Hurt, Brian Dennehy, and Lee Marvin; the usual suspects among able British supporting players (including Richard Griffiths, who just recently, suddenly, achieved stardom in late middle age with ""The History Boys,"" play and movie).  It introduces the former model Joanne Pacula.Cruz Smith's novel, a police procedural, was quite an achievement: in those days before glasnost, and before the Internet, he had to research it in various hard-copy libraries without ever going to the U.S.S.R.; yet it read as if he knew the country, its police procedures, and its internal politics well.  (Nor has he ever written anything else, before or since, that sold as strongly.)The plot concerns three bodies found in the snow, in central Moscow's Gorky Park, near the skating rink.  The faces and fingertips of the bodies have been skinned, making them difficult to identify.  The case falls to Moscow police detective Arkady Renko, who'd rather not have it: its got fingerprints of the KGB, reputedly brutal Russian secret service, all over it.  And though he is lauded as the most successful of Moscow detectives, his independent ways, particularly in regard to the skirt-the-law murderous KGB, have gotten him into trouble before.  It's likely that, if he weren't the son of a celebrated general, his troubles might have been deeper: they might yet, still, be.Hurt plays Renko with a noticeable degree of formality; he's not the all-American boy next door here.  The case brings him into contact with the lucrative trade in sable furs, a profitable Russian monopoly.  He also meets Brian Dennehy, playing an American policeman with a much harder edge than we're accustomed to seeing on him.  And Lee Marvin, handsomely tanned and grey-haired, looking every inch the successful American businessman, giving one of his typical highly-mannered performances; that actor never walked when he could strut.  Hurt/Renko also finds Pacula, playing a beautiful young script girl willing to die to get out of Russia.  She looks Slavic.  Also sexier, all bundled up for the cold, than she has any right to, and is adequate to the demands of her part. (Still, her acting career never went much further.)  The Brits, Griffiths, Ian Bannen, Rikki Fulton, Alexander Knox, Michael Elphick, play all the Russian parts without a hint of a Russian accent.  Go figure.The movie is strong on the ambiance of life in a cold climate.  Also life as it had to be lived for the masses in Russia then, and perhaps now.  Plenty of vodka. A scene of an open-air do-it-yourself used auto mart.  Scenes of people standing on long lines for whatever meat or fresh produce was available, then sitting down to eat, inside a restaurant, in hat and coat.

It moves fast, and maintains suspense to the end.  Its underlying theme, the desire for freedom inborn in every living creature, has emotional resonance.

376389,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,6303471471,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 0]","Back before William Hurt became a caricature of himself - back when I was too young to realize how talented he was and thought him so oddly pale that he was difficult to look at - he made a string of critically-acclaimed films that he has not equaled since.  Among the earliest was ""Gorky Park,"" the Michael Apted iteration of the best-selling novel by Martin Cruz Smith.  This was the early 1980s, when tensions between the United States and the former Soviet Union, what the ruddy-jowled Ronald Reagan so famously called the ""Evil Empire,"" were still strong.  For most Americans at the time, the USSR might as well have been Mars; it was an alien country, full of strange-looking people with even stranger customs, a virtual mystery to us except for being the sworn enemy of democracy.  So, a film purporting to show the Soviet Union as something other than a bleak place where you could get your throat cut for a roll of toilet paper was a marvel indeed.  There is plenty of bleakness in ""Gorky Park,"" of course, from the dour expressions of just about everyone involved to the utilitarian architecture of buildings to the squat patrol cars without heat in the dead of a cold, unforgiving winter.  Hurt plays Arkady Renko, the tight-lipped but by contrast almost genial detective assigned to investigate the brutal murder of three unknowns at an outoor ice rink in Gorky Park.  I say unknown because the killer has taken the extra precaution of slicing off fingers and faces to conceal their identities.  Renko is immediately suspicious that the KGB, under whose scornful eye he operates, is behind the killings until he meets a well-connected American businessman (played by the late, great Lee Marvin) with a demeanor that has ""guilty"" written all over it.  As you might guess, the actual mystery isn't quite as compelling as the way it is told, as Renko, joined later by a vengeful Brian Dennehy, must navigate the maelstrom of political and criminal forces conspiring to thwart him.  Hurt is in a word compelling as Renko, with a performance that is mostly about what he doesn't do.  He eschews scene-stealing for a minimalist confidence that would be cypher-like from a lesser actor.  The rest of the cast is equally gifted, including the feline Joanna Pacula as a sexual confidant who may know more than she's letting on.  Her role seems inspired by that of Ingrid Bergman in ""Notorious,"" as does her relationship with Renko.  Michael Apted's direction is suitably straightforward (he can drift from greatness, as in ""Gorillas in the Mist"" to mediocrity, as in ""The World is Not Enough"") while James Horner's clangy soundtrack, though remisicent of ""48 Hours"" and ""Red Heat"" and with more than a few strains of David Bowie and Georgio Moroder, is wonderfully engaging.  Look closely and you'll see the Evil Emperor himself, Ian McDiarmid, playing a kooky professor who unveils the identities of the victims.",5,Solid Grown-Up Thriller,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2916,"['Back', 'William', 'Hurt', 'became', 'caricature', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'realize', 'how', 'talented', 'was', 'thought', 'so', 'oddly', 'pale', 'was', 'difficult', 'look', 'made', 'string', 'critically-acclaimed', 'films', 'not', 'equaled', 'earliest', 'was', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'iteration', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Martin', 'Cruz', 'Smith', 'was', 'early', '1980s', 'when', 'tensions', 'United', 'States', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'what', 'ruddy-jowled', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'so', 'famously', 'called', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'were', 'still', 'strong', 'most', 'Americans', 'time', 'USSR', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Mars', 'was', 'alien', 'country', 'full', 'strange-looking', 'people', 'even', 'stranger', 'customs', 'virtual', 'mystery', 'being', 'sworn', 'enemy', 'democracy', 'So', 'film', 'purporting', 'show', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'something', 'other', 'bleak', 'place', 'where', 'could', 'get', 'throat', 'cut', 'roll', 'toilet', 'paper', 'was', 'marvel', 'indeed', 'plenty', 'bleakness', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'course', 'dour', 'expressions', 'just', 'everyone', 'involved', 'utilitarian', 'architecture', 'buildings', 'squat', 'patrol', 'cars', 'heat', 'dead', 'cold', 'unforgiving', 'winter', 'Hurt', 'Arkady', 'Renko', 'tight-lipped', 'contrast', 'almost', 'genial', 'detective', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'brutal', 'murder', 'three', 'unknowns', 'outoor', 'ice', 'rink', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'say', 'unknown', 'killer', 'taken', 'extra', 'precaution', 'slicing', 'off', 'fingers', 'conceal', 'identities', 'Renko', 'immediately', 'suspicious', 'KGB', 'scornful', 'eye', 'killings', 'well-connected', 'American', 'businessman', 'played', 'late', 'great', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'demeanor', 'guilty', 'written', 'might', 'guess', 'actual', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'compelling', 'way', 'told', 'Renko', 'joined', 'later', 'vengeful', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'must', 'navigate', 'maelstrom', 'political', 'criminal', 'forces', 'conspiring', 'thwart', 'Hurt', 'word', 'compelling', 'Renko', 'performance', 'mostly', 'what', ""n't"", 'do', 'scene-stealing', 'minimalist', 'confidence', 'would', 'be', 'cypher-like', 'lesser', 'actor', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'gifted', 'including', 'feline', 'Joanna', 'Pacula', 'sexual', 'confidant', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'more', 'letting', 'role', 'inspired', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Notorious', 'relationship', 'Renko', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'direction', 'suitably', 'straightforward', 'can', 'drift', 'greatness', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', 'mediocrity', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'James', 'Horner', 'clangy', 'soundtrack', 'remisicent', '48', 'Hours', 'Red', 'Heat', 'more', 'few', 'strains', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Georgio', 'Moroder', 'wonderfully', 'engaging', 'Look', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Evil', 'Emperor', 'Ian', 'McDiarmid', 'playing', 'kooky', 'professor', 'who', 'identities', 'victims']",Gorky Park VHS

Arkady is truthful to himself and even at the risk of loosing his life he is determined not to give in to the very corrupt system.  He is tough and bruised.  Not a hero, but also not willing to lie down. William Hurt seems lethargic in the role.  He does not have any depth.  He is not a man of passion.  He just exists.  He is not easy to identify with.
