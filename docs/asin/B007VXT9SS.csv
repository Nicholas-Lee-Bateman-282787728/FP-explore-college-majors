1538880,A2582KMXLK2P06,B007VXT9SS,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Being Flynn is a pretty realistic portrayal of the homeless, which is probably not supposed to be the main drawing point of the movie but nonetheless, it's the aspect that stuck with me the most after the movie was over.  It's about Robert De Niro not only insisting he's a talented writer, but also praising himself to the moon like he's comparable to God and that he's in the process of creating his most important work despite nobody -especially his son- not believing him.  In addition to that, in the beginning Robert's character is quite unusual in the way he's borderline psychotic and gives me the impression that he's lost his mind, which is strange because he shouldn't feel this way until *after* he's been living in the streets for a while.  Seems sort of backwards there.  However such an unpredicable personality also produces pretty surprising, funny and interesting bits of storytelling.Meanwhile Robert hasn't seen his son in over 18 years, and when the two eventually reconnect, well for a while we go down memory lane as we see how the mother/wife (played by the always talented and beautiful Julianne Moore) lost her life as a result of a suicide.  Rather oddly however, the tone here usually feels positive and optimistic, instead of dreadful and hopeless.  This is probably unintentional and can be pretty much be explained by the actors starring in the movie.  I mean, I know Robert De Niro like millions of others since he's starred in so many films over the years, so I can sense the direction the movie is going.  His character isn't going to just die and the movie will be over.  That's not how Robert functions!  That probably explains the mostly positive tone even during the worst of circumstances.Some things didn't really make sense to me, such as the son suddenly participating in drugs for no clear reason (unless I missed a crucial moment in the storytelling).  He didn't really have any reason to suddenly do drugs, especially after Robert basically praises him over and over insisting that he has the same writing talent because he's Robert's son, so he's a part of Robert.  You'd think if anything giving such praise would encourage his son to be a mentally happier and motivated person.  Strange how the opposite occurs.  I can only guess that the son losing his mother to suicide may be a factor in his use of drugs, which soon affects his relationship with a girl that isn't necessarily interested in a relationship but doesn't mind sleeping with men (and I KNOW what you're thinking but eh, I don't think she's trashy at all- you'll have to see her character to know what I mean.  She's actually very smart and has her priorities straight).But yeah, seeing Robert De Niro sleeping on heating vents in the city streets just to keep warm while the snow is falling and the temperatures are falling as the winter rolls along as it gets colder and colder... you really feel for his character.  You want him to succeed.  You want him to aspire to be the great writer that he insists he is.  You want him to get out of the rut he dug himself in.  &#34;Memoirs of a Moron&#34; Robert was calling it?  haha!  Why the son never asked his own father to live with him is a huge question mark, however. Why not?  Just because he's a little bonkers?  Nah, I'd let him in my apartment room if he was MY dad.  I'd never let his life deteriorate to such an extent.Anyway, small inconsistencies aside, and perhaps the overall tone not being as affectionate as it could have been since you don't really feel a close connection between Robert De Niro and his son like the movie writers were going for, Being Flynn is still most definitely a good movie.  I highly recommend it.  It has a good meaningful message behind it, and unfortunately the homeless parts are all too realistic.  Solid drama just short of brilliant.",4,being homeless and freezing,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,3841,"['Being', 'Flynn', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'homeless', 'probably', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'drawing', 'point', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'aspect', 'stuck', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'not', 'only', 'insisting', 'talented', 'writer', 'also', 'praising', 'moon', 'comparable', 'God', 'process', 'creating', 'most', 'important', 'work', 'nobody', '-especially', 'son-', 'not', 'believing', 'addition', 'beginning', 'Robert', 'character', 'quite', 'unusual', 'way', 'borderline', 'psychotic', 'impression', 'lost', 'mind', 'strange', 'should', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', '*after*', 'been', 'living', 'streets', 'while', 'sort', 'backwards', 'there', 'However', 'such', 'unpredicable', 'personality', 'also', 'pretty', 'surprising', 'funny', 'interesting', 'bits', 'storytelling.Meanwhile', 'Robert', ""n't"", 'seen', 'son', '18', 'years', 'when', 'two', 'eventually', 'reconnect', 'well', 'while', 'go', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'see', 'how', 'mother/wife', 'played', 'always', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'lost', 'life', 'result', 'suicide', 'oddly', 'however', 'tone', 'here', 'usually', 'feels', 'positive', 'optimistic', 'instead', 'dreadful', 'hopeless', 'probably', 'unintentional', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'be', 'explained', 'actors', 'starring', 'movie', 'mean', 'know', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'millions', 'others', 'starred', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'years', 'can', 'sense', 'direction', 'movie', 'going', 'character', ""n't"", 'going', 'just', 'die', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'not', 'how', 'Robert', 'probably', 'mostly', 'positive', 'tone', 'even', 'worst', 'circumstances.Some', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'such', 'son', 'suddenly', 'participating', 'drugs', 'clear', 'reason', 'missed', 'crucial', 'moment', 'storytelling', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'suddenly', 'do', 'drugs', 'especially', 'Robert', 'basically', 'insisting', 'same', 'writing', 'talent', 'Robert', 'son', 'part', 'Robert', ""'d"", 'think', 'anything', 'giving', 'such', 'praise', 'would', 'encourage', 'son', 'be', 'mentally', 'happier', 'motivated', 'person', 'Strange', 'how', 'opposite', 'occurs', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'son', 'losing', 'mother', 'suicide', 'may', 'be', 'factor', 'use', 'drugs', 'soon', 'relationship', 'girl', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'interested', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sleeping', 'men', 'KNOW', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'eh', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'trashy', 'all-', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'character', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'actually', 'very', 'smart', 'priorities', 'straight', '.But', 'yeah', 'seeing', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'sleeping', 'heating', 'vents', 'city', 'just', 'keep', 'warm', 'snow', 'falling', 'temperatures', 'are', 'falling', 'winter', 'rolls', 'colder', 'colder', 'really', 'feel', 'character', 'want', 'succeed', 'want', 'aspire', 'be', 'great', 'writer', 'want', 'get', 'rut', 'dug', '34', 'Memoirs', 'Moron', '34', 'Robert', 'was', 'calling', 'haha', 'Why', 'son', 'never', 'asked', 'own', 'father', 'live', 'huge', 'question', 'mark', 'however', 'Why', 'not', 'Just', 'little', 'bonkers', 'Nah', ""'d"", 'let', 'apartment', 'room', 'was', 'MY', 'dad', ""'d"", 'never', 'let', 'life', 'deteriorate', 'extent.Anyway', 'small', 'inconsistencies', 'aside', 'perhaps', 'overall', 'tone', 'not', 'being', 'as', 'affectionate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'close', 'connection', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'son', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'Being', 'Flynn', 'still', 'most', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'good', 'meaningful', 'message', 'unfortunately', 'homeless', 'parts', 'are', 'too', 'realistic', 'Solid', 'drama', 'just', 'short', 'brilliant']",Being Flynn

1538883,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B007VXT9SS,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","Jonathan Flynn(Robert DeNiro) announces himself to audience as a writer on the level of Mark Twain.  Conveniently he omits to mention that he did a stretch for passing bad checks, abandoned his family, and is an unrepentant bigot.  Nicholas Flynn(Paul Dano) is an aspiring poet who engages in casual affairs, drinks, and takes recreational drugs to ease the pain of his father leaving and his mother's suicide.  Nicholas takes a job at the local men's shelter so he wouldn't hate himself so much and to help the downtrodden.  One night Jonathan comes into the shelter looking for a bed for the night.  The lives of these two disconnected men will change in ways that are unimaginable.  DeNiro's turn here is note perfect despite being buoyant.  In lesser hands you could say it was over-the-top but DeNiro plays it to perfection.  Dano's more subdued turn is appropriate for his character who is quietly simmering inside and it compliments DeNiro's largesse.  Good supporting work is offered by Julianne Moore seen in flashback as Nicholas' mother and Wes Studi as the shelter supervisor.

Paul Weitz directs and adapted the 2004 memoir by Nick Flynn ""Another Bulls__t Night in Suck City: A Memoir"" and brought together a superlative cast that just may be Robert De Niro's finest hour.  Nick Flynn deserves the credit for this articulate tale of his own life:  he was born and grew up in Scituate, Massachusetts, south of Boston. His parents divorced when he was young and his mother committed suicide when he was 22. He drifted through several jobs before starting work at a homeless shelter in Boston, where at age twenty-seven, he met his estranged, homeless father for the first time. That is the core of the film.The nature of the film works very well: we simultaneously meet Jonathan Flynn (Robert DeNiro), a man who believes he is `America's greatest writer along side Mark Twain and JD Salinger, who lives life day to day in a drunken stupor, driving taxis, acting out con games etc until he becomes homeless, and after seeking shelter from old friends he has neglected, he ends up in a homeless shelter. We also meet his estranged son Nick Flynn (Paul Dano, in a breakout performance) who is striving to discover who he is, perceiving himself as a writer but unsuccessful with relationships: Nick's mother Jody (Julianne Moore) we see only in flashbacks because she committed suicide, and his only communication with his absent father has been through letters. Also homeless, Nick moves with with two characters (Eddie Rouse and Steve Cirbus) who manage to help Nick find a job in a homeless shelter. As Nick adjusts to working at the shelter he comes into connect with a potential girlfriend Denise (Olivia Thirlby) and begins to feel as though his life has some degree of meaning.  The jolt comes when Jonathan seeks shelter in the homeless shelter where Nick works and it is this coming together of two bruised and pained people who happen to be father and son that sets in motion the resolution of the story. Both men are pitiful but both have redeeming characteristics and it is this struggling coming together that makes the film breathe.  In addition to the brilliant acting of the main characters, there are also exceptionally memorable roles by Lili Taylor, Victor Rasuk, Thomas Middleditch, Wes Studi, Chris Chalk and others.Not only is the film pitch perfect in nearly every detail, but it also gives the viewer the opportunity to consider the plight of the homeless around us.  How many tragic stories like this are untold or never will be known? When a film can produce that degree of involvement with the audience it goes beyond simply being a film and becomes art - art makes us consider, think, and change.

The way a functioning person can fall into homelessness very easily is depicted here in a real way.  Riveting DeNiro & especially Paul Dano.One reviewer said this was a severely depressing film, while that is true, it's also as uplifting as it is downy.2 teeny things that bother me which have nothing to do with the merit of this great, Oscar-caliber film::1)  Had a tough time buying the regal, elegant Julianne Moore as a blue-collar struggling, downtrodden waitress-bank teller.  Love her, love the film, but she will never be believable as a Boston blue-collar mom with a sad life.  Never.  She physically looks too patrician and classy to be believable in this role even though she's a wonderful actress who played the part well.2) to reviewer Grady Harp:  memorable part by Lili Taylor?

1538895,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B007VXT9SS,J from NY,"[1, 2]","""Being Flynn"" with Paul Dano and Robert DeNiro is a film devastating in it's subtlety.  Considering the dramatic nature of Flynn's life and the unusual cast of characters that pop in and out of his memoirs (""Another Bulls*** Night In Suck City"", ""The Ticking is the Bomb"") director Paul Weitz could have gone for another music video, ""Basketball Diaries"" MTV spot on this one, but he didn't.  It is mostly believable and heart wrenching.  While I could have done without so much of the self aware ""Gen X"" 90's culture present in the film, that is part of the time period Flynn was writing in, I guess.When Nick Flynn was a young man his mother shot herself as a result of drug use, being overworked, and also as a reaction to the abandonment of her husband, Jonathan Flynn.  His father Jonathan was (is) a grandiose, megalomaniacal liar who despite his absence continuously sent him letters about what a great writer he was, and how ""Nicholas"" must have the same gene and be destined for the same greatness.I remember when his first collection of poems (""Some Ether"") emerged, still a standout in the vast and tiring world of Ivy League ""confessional"" poetry.  A life can be unusual and devastating and still be uninteresting if the writer isn't talented.  Though I enjoyed his poems more than memoirs, Nick Flynn is definitely talented.Without giving away the story entirely, Nick searches for some sense of self definition by working with the homeless and thereby seeking to become less self absorbed.  One day, his father shows up.  Things go from bad to worse to bad again with a hint of redemption at the end; Nick is a real writer, his father a narcissistic jerk with just a few bricks short of a load.  Robert De Niro does some of the best acting he's done in quite awhile.  For anyone interested in Nick Flynn or those rare movies that concern writers and actually tell their story, this is a must see.",5,"""I bequeath you the final word""",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1910,"['Being', 'Flynn', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'film', 'devastating', 'subtlety', 'Considering', 'dramatic', 'nature', 'Flynn', 'life', 'unusual', 'cast', 'characters', 'pop', 'memoirs', 'Bulls***', 'Night', 'Suck', 'City', 'Ticking', 'Bomb', 'director', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'music', 'video', 'Basketball', 'Diaries', 'MTV', 'spot', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'mostly', 'believable', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'self', 'aware', 'Gen', 'X', '90', 'culture', 'present', 'film', 'part', 'time', 'period', 'Flynn', 'was', 'writing', 'guess.When', 'Nick', 'Flynn', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'shot', 'result', 'drug', 'use', 'being', 'overworked', 'also', 'reaction', 'abandonment', 'husband', 'Jonathan', 'Flynn', 'father', 'Jonathan', 'was', 'grandiose', 'megalomaniacal', 'liar', 'who', 'absence', 'continuously', 'sent', 'letters', 'what', 'great', 'writer', 'was', 'how', 'Nicholas', 'must', 'have', 'same', 'gene', 'be', 'destined', 'same', 'greatness.I', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'collection', 'poems', 'Ether', 'emerged', 'still', 'standout', 'vast', 'tiring', 'world', 'Ivy', 'League', 'confessional', 'poetry', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'unusual', 'devastating', 'still', 'be', 'uninteresting', 'writer', ""n't"", 'talented', 'enjoyed', 'poems', 'more', 'memoirs', 'Nick', 'Flynn', 'definitely', 'talented.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'story', 'entirely', 'Nick', 'sense', 'self', 'definition', 'working', 'homeless', 'thereby', 'seeking', 'become', 'less', 'self', 'absorbed', 'One', 'day', 'father', 'up', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'bad', 'again', 'hint', 'redemption', 'end', 'Nick', 'real', 'writer', 'father', 'narcissistic', 'jerk', 'just', 'few', 'bricks', 'short', 'load', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'best', 'acting', 'done', 'quite', 'awhile', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Nick', 'Flynn', 'rare', 'movies', 'concern', 'writers', 'actually', 'tell', 'story', 'must', 'see']",Being Flynn

This 'double narrative' perspective seems to have been done in order to drive home the film's message, which is ""like father, like son"".  That's a bit heavyhanded, in comparison to the book, and it only succeeds in jumbling the storyline and making it more confusing.When I read the book, I never envisioned Nick Flynn as a ""slacker hero"", and Paul Dano's portrayal makes Flynn seem pretty sallow and weak.  Opposite that, you have Robert DeNiro barely refraining from scene-stealing with a blustery and largely empty performance.I did find some solace in the recessed role of Julianne Moore as Flynn's suicidal mother... Moore delivered a very effective, measured performance.  But, overall this movie was a very underwhelming, faulty translation of a fine memoir in book form.

Smartly directed by Paul Weitz and richly adapted from Nick Flynn's own memoir of ""Another Bulls*** Night in Suck City"".  The film gives a darkly atmospheric account of the homeless in the city and an apprehensive opportunity to view this painful and excruciatingly real part of life.Nick Flynn (Paul Dano) has been raised by his young mother, Jody (Julianne Moore), who committed suicide when Nick was 22 years old.  Any scenes with Moore are seen while Nick is returning back to his memories of her.  His father, Jonathan (Robert De Niro), had left his family much earlier and was divorced by Jody.  Nick grew up never knowing a father; a stockpile of letters has kept him in touch, in any regard, with Jonathan .Jonathan Flynn is a caustically volatile, alcohol-dependent, and, during many intervals, arguably delusional man.  Marked throughout with problematic behavior, he becomes severely and physically abusive towards his downstairs neighbors.  His landlord at the time must evict him.  There may be a pervasive mental illness afflicting him which goes unexplored.  With this being said, his father is also a witty man adding a comedic side to him which adds to an otherwise high-pressure life for Nick.Jonathan has a flight of topics running in revolutions in his mind and constantly shouts these same statements; ""I am one of the three great American writers"" (equating himself to J.D. Salinger and also Mark Twain), ""Life is gathering information"", and ""Soon I shall be known"" as he speaks of the masterpiece he is writing and it's obvious importance.These two go through a lot on a separate basis in their lives until they finally meet again (they have briefly met one other time before and then nothing).  While Nick is working for a homeless shelter, his father steps up to the window and orders a room for the night as if it is a hotel.  Totally shocked, Nick has a hard time responding to the fact that his ever-absent father is right in front of him and will be staying at the place he works.Working at the shelter beckons so much of what goes on with the plight of the homeless in our country.  During the coldest night's weather, the shelter's workers go out and search the streets for the literally freezing people and for the hungry who need their help which Nick does often. At one point, after his father had been thrown-out of the shelter due to his behavior, Nick finds Jonathan freezing in the cold. He brings him to his own apartment and hopefully an issue is looked into in-depth.  This major issue on the table is his mother's suicide.The movie is really all about Nick's journey through the horrendous lifetime of surviving without a present father or mother. Then he must carry-on in life with the inclusion of Jonathan, whose manner is virtually impossible to understand or navigate through.The cinematography (Declan Quinn) paints a portrait of despair and hopelessness.  The scenes are very dark with little light on the subject.  The eclectic soundtrack (Steven McLaughlin) is mournful and tellingly moody including featured songs by 'Badly Drawn Boy'. Original music which I found simply amazing and positively worth the listen.  I found this movie a study of familial dysfunction, a horrendous account of a son trying to survive a lifetime alone without anyone to fully count on.",5,"""Writers,  Especially Poets,  Are Especially Prone To Madness"" - Jonathan Flynn",1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,3542,"['highly', 'combustible', 'relationship', 'movie', 'belligerent', 'grandiose', 'thinking', 'extremely', 'angry', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'there', 'neglected', 'son', 'who', 'trying', 'care', 'totally', 'giving', 'up', 'Smartly', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'richly', 'adapted', 'Nick', 'Flynn', 'own', 'memoir', 'Bulls***', 'Night', 'Suck', 'City', 'film', 'darkly', 'atmospheric', 'account', 'homeless', 'city', 'apprehensive', 'opportunity', 'view', 'painful', 'excruciatingly', 'real', 'part', 'life.Nick', 'Flynn', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'been', 'raised', 'young', 'mother', 'Jody', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'when', 'Nick', 'was', '22', 'years', 'old', 'scenes', 'Moore', 'are', 'seen', 'Nick', 'returning', 'back', 'memories', 'father', 'Jonathan', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'had', 'left', 'family', 'much', 'earlier', 'was', 'divorced', 'Jody', 'Nick', 'grew', 'up', 'never', 'knowing', 'father', 'stockpile', 'letters', 'kept', 'touch', 'regard', 'Jonathan', '.Jonathan', 'Flynn', 'caustically', 'volatile', 'alcohol-dependent', 'many', 'intervals', 'arguably', 'delusional', 'man', 'Marked', 'problematic', 'behavior', 'severely', 'physically', 'abusive', 'towards', 'downstairs', 'neighbors', 'landlord', 'time', 'must', 'evict', 'may', 'be', 'pervasive', 'mental', 'illness', 'afflicting', 'unexplored', 'being', 'said', 'father', 'also', 'witty', 'man', 'adding', 'comedic', 'side', 'otherwise', 'high-pressure', 'life', 'Nick.Jonathan', 'flight', 'topics', 'running', 'revolutions', 'mind', 'constantly', 'same', 'statements', 'am', 'one', 'three', 'great', 'American', 'writers', 'equating', 'J.D', 'Salinger', 'also', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Life', 'gathering', 'information', 'Soon', 'shall', 'be', 'known', 'masterpiece', 'writing', 'obvious', 'importance.These', 'two', 'go', 'lot', 'separate', 'basis', 'lives', 'finally', 'meet', 'again', 'have', 'briefly', 'met', 'one', 'other', 'time', 'then', 'nothing', 'Nick', 'working', 'homeless', 'shelter', 'father', 'up', 'window', 'orders', 'room', 'night', 'hotel', 'Totally', 'shocked', 'Nick', 'hard', 'time', 'responding', 'fact', 'ever-absent', 'father', 'right', 'front', 'will', 'be', 'staying', 'place', 'works.Working', 'shelter', 'beckons', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'plight', 'homeless', 'country', 'coldest', 'night', 'weather', 'shelter', 'workers', 'go', 'out', 'search', 'streets', 'literally', 'freezing', 'people', 'hungry', 'who', 'need', 'help', 'Nick', 'often', 'one', 'point', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'thrown-out', 'shelter', 'due', 'behavior', 'Nick', 'Jonathan', 'freezing', 'cold', 'own', 'apartment', 'hopefully', 'issue', 'looked', 'in-depth', 'major', 'issue', 'table', 'mother', 'suicide.The', 'movie', 'really', 'Nick', 'journey', 'horrendous', 'lifetime', 'surviving', 'present', 'father', 'mother', 'Then', 'must', 'carry-on', 'life', 'inclusion', 'Jonathan', 'manner', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'understand', 'navigate', 'through.The', 'cinematography', 'Declan', 'Quinn', 'portrait', 'despair', 'hopelessness', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'little', 'light', 'subject', 'eclectic', 'soundtrack', 'Steven', 'McLaughlin', 'mournful', 'tellingly', 'moody', 'including', 'featured', 'songs', ""'Badly"", 'Drawn', 'Boy', 'Original', 'music', 'found', 'simply', 'amazing', 'positively', 'listen', 'found', 'movie', 'study', 'familial', 'dysfunction', 'horrendous', 'account', 'son', 'trying', 'survive', 'lifetime', 'alone', 'anyone', 'fully', 'count']",Being Flynn

Jonathan Flynn (Robert De Niro), cab driver, ex-con fancies himself a writer. He carries with pride a rejection letter that praise his work. He has a drinking and reality problem as he proclaims his situation is to &#34;gather excellent material.&#34; Everything he writes is a masterpiece or so he constantly reminds us.His son Nick (Paul Dano) lives in the same city of Boston. He writes poetry, the type of tripe you hear at some poetry house that you think is dark and meaningful. He finds himself working at a homeless shelter, &#34;the last step before the morgue&#34; and it doesn't take much to figure out how these subplots come together. Nick is constantly re-examining his life and childhood he spent being raised by his mother (Julianne Moore), without a father.The film was well acted. However, the message was all over the place. &#34;It is a long climb up and a quick step down.&#34; was one message I got. Whatever father/son relationship message there should have been was lost with quick transitions.

So believeable and heartbreaking.  Paul Dano was great as the frustrated and tortured son.

One day, his long-estranged father Jonathan (Robert De Niro), who considers himself as one of the three greatest American writers, contacts Nick, asking for a help, as he is being evicted.While the autobiographical story follows the conflict between the father and son, the film&#8217;s flashback section tells us about Nick&#8217;s loving mother Jody (Julianne Moore).The best part of the 2012 American drama &#8220;Being Flynn&#8221; is Robert De Niro's strong performance. Another memorable thing is the film&#8217;s realistic descriptions of the shelter. Unfortunately, directed by Paul Weitz (&#8220;American Pie&#8221; &#8220;About a Boy&#8221;), the film doesn't give us much insight into the father-son relationship. Their complicated relationship could have been much more emotionally involving.Also, despite the interesting supports including Olivia Thirlby, Wes Studi and Lili Taylor (wife of real-life Nick Flynn), supporting characters are not fully developed.
