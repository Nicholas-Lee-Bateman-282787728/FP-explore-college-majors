282602,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,6301971736,A Customer,"[3, 5]","Jane Wyman one the Best Actress Oscar - and rightly so too - for her sensitive and touching portrayal of a deaf mute who blossoms under the attentions of a compassionate young doctor on a Nova Scotian farm. Dealing with the themes of rape, teenage pregnancy, single-motherhood and small town intolerance, Johnny Belinda was probably quite sensational for the late 1940's, the period in which it was made.The film begins as the gentle Dr. Robert Richardson (Lew Ayres) moves to a windswept coastal Nova Scotia town to escape from a spoiled relationship. One night, he is asked to deliver a calf and upon visiting the farm Black McDonald (Charles Bickford), she meets Belinda (Jane Wyman) a young deaf girl, whose unofficial name is ""dummy"" and is treated like some kind of serving wench.Apparently her mother died giving birth to her and since then her Aunt Aggie (the great Agnes Moorehead), has been holding it against her. Neither her father nor her aunt ever actually believes that there's a sharp mind and deep emotional intuition behind Belinda's innocent faade. But Robert sees something quite magical in the girl and he takes the time to teach her sign language and how to read lips when no one else will.Her progress is astonishing, and soon she's altered from a dirty and overworked rapscallion into an attractive and spirited young woman. In fact, she's so pretty that she even attracts the attentions of the town's local bad boy Locky McCormick who gets rotten drunk one night and brutishly rapes her in the McDonald's barn. Belinda internalizes the experience, keeping it a secret.When Robert takes Belinda to see a specialist in the city, he discovers that she is pregnant Unfortunately Belinda ends up pregnant, a fact that Robert discovers when he takes her to a hearing specialist in the big city. Because Belinda won't name the man who attacked her, the townspeople - who are mostly a bunch of god-fearing, intolerant old biddies - quickly assume that Robert is the father.Everything comes to a head when Locky realizes he is the father of the baby now named Johnny Belinda and tries to talk his fianc&eacute; Stella (Jan Stirling) into obtaining custody. What could have been an unadulterated, over-the-top weepy is actually played out in an understated and minimalist way.Wyman avoids going for the grand gestures, playing Belinda with a mixture of quiet sensitivity and respect, and her supporting cast are equally as strong, especially the wonderful Agnes Moorehead who steadily warms to her vulnerable young niece as the story progresses.Of course, due to the censorship restrictions of the time, the handling of the darker themes are a rather whitewashed - we never actually see Belinda when she is pregnant and her delivery of Johnny is so shrouded in mystery it merely looks like she is laying in bed with a severe case of the flu. But the issues of the rape and its consequences are shockingly audacious. Also, the actions taken by the townspeople ""on behalf of"" Belinda, whom they see as some kind of feral animal, are especially bleak.Johnny Belinda definitely belongs to the stunning Ms. Wyman. She really manages to capture the sensitive heart and soul of Belinda. But the picture is also notable for its stunning exterior shots, the landscapes which run down to the sea's edge, village streets, fishing boats and weathered barns look as though they might be indigenous to Cape Breton Island and they really give you the feel that you are actually struggling to live a hand-to-mouth existence along with these people.

282610,A2WLZD9BY669HY,6301971736,Candace Scott,"[14, 15]","I hadn't seen this film in 30 years, but watched it again last evening. I was mesmerized by several aspects of this classic (and ahead of its time) 1948 movie. Jane Wyman won the Oscar in this role where she makes not a single sound, not even in the throes of pregnancy. She is a deaf mute and never speaks, but imbues her character with a poignant tenderness and yearning which is extremely moving. There is no doubt that Wyman is an extremely underrated actress, because the pathos in this performance is moving indeed.Lew Ayres gives possibly his best performance here. For other reviewers who say he's the weakest part of the movie, I don't agree; perhaps they need to see him in the classic 1930 offering, &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front.&quot; In that film, Lew was gorgeous to look at it, but couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Here, he's vastly improved and deliberately underplays a character who is caring, decent, but essentially stoic and very still. I admit there isn't a lot of chemistry between Wyman and Ayres, but he projects a dignity and decency which shines through.Agnes Moorehead and Charles Bickford deliver outstanding supporting performances. Their interplay and dialogue is interesting and they contribute to the flowing plot.Aside from Wyman's stellar performance, the most interesting aspect of the film is that it is not dated in the least. The subjects of rape, an illegitimate baby and pre-marital sex were hardly common themes in movies of that era, and this film handles it with aplomb and class. The weakness of the film is that Belinda is assailed from all sides constantly; her lot in life is hard enough to begin with, but she is thrown one vicious curve after another. But not to worry, all comes out all right in the end.This movie is worth watching solely for Wyman's outstanding performance. Watch her eyes and how she conveys such beautiful emotion in them.

282615,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6301971736,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","This is a great storytelling and movie-making rolled into one and I can see why it was up for so many Academy Awards in its day (when they rewarded the best movies.)Jane Wyman seems to get the most attention here but I was totally impressed not only with her but all the actors, the director and the photographer. All excelled in this film, I thought - a great effort all-around.Wyman and Lew Ayers were terrific in the leads, playing endearing characters who were easy to become involved with and root for in this story. Wyman, like Dorothy McGuire in ""The Spiral Staircase"" (1945) and Alan Arkin in ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter"" (1968), plays a deaf mute effectively with haunting, expressive facial features. I hope people don't overlook Ayers' extremely warm performance as the doctor who truly cares for this woman. Ayers plays a very decent man and does it with a lot of dignity.Charles Bickford was powerful, too, as Belinda's father and ditto for the always-entertaining Agnes Moorhead, playing Belinda's sister. I can't leave out the ""villains,"" either: Stephen McNally, who really looks his part, and his reluctant bride Jan Sterling, an underrated classic-era actress.Jean Negulesco's direction provided numerous interesting low and high-angle camera shots and cinematographer Ted McCord made the most of it, including some great facial closeups. To be honest, I am not familiar with either of these two names but I was very impressed with their work here.

282617,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301971736,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Jane Wyman's poignant, justly acclaimed performance as an isolated deaf-mute girl is the best thing about this old-fashioned 1948 Warner Brothers melodrama. Generally undervalued as an actress even though she bounced easily from sassy musical comedy chorines to long-suffering Douglas Sirk matrons, Wyman brings a touching authenticity to a character who through the kindness of a country doctor, finds liberation in her newly found ability to communicate. In what is probably his best film, director Jean Negulesco should be given credit for coaxing such a fine performance even though the actress at 34, is a mite mature for the role.The plot centers on kindly Dr. Richardson, who pays a house call to help deliver a calf for the irascible Black McDonald. There he notices Black's daughter Belinda, who is unable to hear or speak. Treated more like a mule by her family, she engenders the ridicule of the small town that refers to her dismissively as ""The Dummy"". The good doctor takes a platonic interest in Belinda and teaches her sign language and lip reading, and through the magic of Hollywood, she not only becomes adept but transforms into an attractive young woman curious about the world around her. There is a lovely scene where she watches the locals dancing, feels the resonance of a fiddle being played, and starts to dance as well. Unfortunately, she attracts the attention of Locky McCormick, a local ne'er-do-well who rapes and impregnates her. Scientologists will likely rejoice at the implied silent birthing scene. The film ends on a far-fetched, heavy-handed note, but the turn of events is not enough to ruin the movie.Longtime character actor Lew Ayres is a bit too passive and overly sincere as the well-meaning doctor, but one has to put some of the blame on the rather simplistic screenplay by Allen Vincent and Irma von Cube. Unsurprisingly, veterans Charles Bickford as Black and especially Agnes Moorehead as his taciturn sister Aggie are expert in their roles. Jan Sterling overplays the role of the doctor's smitten secretary, though Stephen McNally is appropriately despicable as Locky. Set in rural Nova Scotia, the townsfolk are portrayed in unfortunate broad strokes to reflect their small-mindedness, especially as they try to take the baby away from Belinda. The Mendocino coast provides a scenic replacement for Nova Scotia, and it's captured well in Ted McCord's crisp black-and-white cinematography. But see the movie for Wyman's masterful turn - that's really what keeps it from being dated hokum.

I shed allot of tears during this great and powerful film... the acting was superior, along with the direction and cinematography. Jane Wyman's performance as the deaf girl was quite heavy, to watch her transform from a sad soul, to a happy and caring woman, (with the help of Lew Ayers, the doctor) was uplifting. The fathers performance was top notch as well... all the cast was superb. This is an example of film making done solely for the viewer, for the love of the art form itself, and for the desire to make powerful movies which resonate within us for decades...I am only 41, so i didnt grow up watching most of the early films like this, my memories are of ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""The longest yard"", etc, etc.. but i do remember being engrossed by many old black and whites when they came on TV.

Three aspects of the story impressed me.  For one thing, the movie clearly  demonstrates the way that a deaf-mute person can communicate and that they  are not stupid (a &quot;dummy&quot;), as people used to assume.  The viewer  can learn a lot about sign language, and this must have been new to  audiences of the forties.  Another fascinating thing is the fairly  straightforward handling of the rape and its after effects.  There's  nothing graphic about it, but the movie doesn't attempt to really skirt  around the sensitive subject matter the way older movies used to due to  censorship and moral codes.  I was also impressed by the realistic  depiction of the small town where Belinda lives.  Their attitudes and  feelings of superiority ring very true.  As the central character, Jane  Wyman gives a very good performance, communicating Belinda's confusion,  fears, and growing maturity without the benefit of words.

Films like Magnolia, The Passion of the Christ, and now Johnny Belinda.It is the story of a deaf and dumb young woman named Belinda. Treated as an unintelligent workhorse all her years, Belinda's life changes forever when a lonely new doctor moves into her small coastal Nova Scotian port town. He takes an immediate liking to her and, proving to her family that she is not the ""dummy"" they think, he teaches her to read lips. But after a drunken sexual assault leaves her pregnant, rumors begin to fly throughout the small town, and both Belinda and her loved ones must fight for what's right.The performances are wonderful. Of course, Jane Wyman simply steals the show in her Oscar-winning performance. She brings an incredible heart, warmth, and emotional resonance to the character of Belinda, and she does it without ever saying a word. The rest of the cast is marvelous as well, especially Charles Bickford, who lovingly portrays Belinda's father, and Stephen McNally, who turns Belinda's attacker into one of the most easy to loathe characters ever put on celluloid - yet the film still brilliantly keeps him at the level of a realistic personality - no one is a caricature.Director Jean Negulesco brings an understated visual beauty to the film reminiscent of the silent ages, when one had to use aesthetics to make up for the lack of aural stimulus. Every shot is a perfectly composed work of art, turning every moment of Belinda into a masterwork of lighting and raw, majestic nature. The seaside settings are utilized so well that they put Johnny Belinda in league with such legendary jaw-droppers as L'Avventura and Black Narcissus.But this film is much more than just visual appeal. It is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, often simultaneously. There are so many thought-provoking themes to gnaw on in Johnny Belinda - the way people view the handicapped, the bonds of parenthood, the power of rumors, the justification of violence as self-defense, and overall morality and humanity. Even the film's setting could be considered an allegory on Belinda - the brutal waves of the ocean constantly pounding against the serene shores.The film is also, as I mentioned before, emotionally overwhelming. While it certainly has a focused narrative, Belinda is foremost a progression of feelings, and they are so well conveyed that I was simply overcome with joy, pain, heartbreak, and hope. While the film is often described as a melodrama, it is far from a soap opera. There are no miraculous moments of sudden verbal triumph for Belinda, no ridiculously overacted moments of teary-eyed abandon - Johnny Belinda is a terribly real experience. There are aspects of the story that remain unresolved - not loose ends, but difficult problems that would most likely also remain unresolved in reality.However, I don't want to give the impression that Johnny Belinda is depressing. I felt uplifted and rapturous just as often as I felt overcome by grief and fear. I felt so much for these characters and I wanted so sorely for things to turn out a certain way - but I won't reveal whether they do or not. I will say that the film ends on a note of nearly unbearable poignancy, and this is the moment that massaged my tear ducts.My only complaint concerning the film is Max Steiner's score. He is perfectly suited for epic films like King Kong and Gone With The Wind, but here it feels somewhat overdramatic and occasionally awkward. He tends to play up the melodramatic angle and spot score in a ubiquitous manner, which simply doesn't fit with a film like Johnny Belinda. Still, it tends to work more often than not, and it is not a major enough problem to work seriously to the film's detriment.This picture is a true gem. It has been unavailable for years, but thanks to Warner Brothers, it finally has a DVD release, and the restoration is simply glorious - it more than does justice to this cinematic treasure.

What a shame I waited so long! Jane Wyman turns in an incredibly appealing performance as the deaf-mute Belinda, daughter of a Cape Breton miller (Charles Bickford) who resents the daughter as his wife died in childbirth. Also on hand is his gruff sister, played by Agnes Moorehead in what I honestly think is the best acting job I've ever seen her do, and I've seen her a lot. Belinda has been long neglected--not even called by her name, but just &quot;dummy&quot;--until the new town doctor happens on the scene and takes an interest in teaching her sign language and how to read lips. The doctor is played by Lew Ayres, and I must admit, he's the weakest part of the picture. I thought he was passionless--he reminded me of Alex Trebek! Well, almost as soon as Belinda blossoms as a result of her newfound ability to communicate her ideas, she is raped by a townsperson and bears the illegitimate namesake of the movie, Johnny. The rest of the movie concerns the stigma her family and she endure as a result of the rape and birth, and some shocking tragedies before Belinda finally is acknowleged to be a person of intelligence and feeling by her whole community.Jane Wyman does a wonderful job portraying Belinda and imbuing her character with a quiet dignity. Seeing her here makes me curious to see other movies starring her.

Johnny Belinda seems to me that it is definitely worthy of the term classic, largely because of Jane Wyman but also because of its outstanding camera work. Wyman demonstrates a great sensitivity with a performance good enough to suggest that she was under utilized all those years. Given the subject matter, and the time it was produced, there has to be certain leeway given. It is not a film made for children and an intelligent adult viewing it now would pick up on its many subtleties. Belinda is not a backward dummy, as is implied by the majority of the townspeople. Rather it is they who are backward ''blessed'' as they are with all senses, but blocked minds, hearts and souls aplenty. Now, if I have a minor quibble with this film it would be that the  great good fortune of motherhood for its own sake seems to be a whitewash for the crime perpetrated against Belinda. Are we to imply that having a baby, by any means, is the great absolver of sins? There is never any question of abortion, for instance. There is never any real examination about how Belinda feels about things, not until she is deep into the light of radiant motherhood. Still.

Belinda is a deaf mute young woman who is thought of as ""the dummy"" by her family and the local townspeople in the Canadian fishing village in which she was born and raised.  A young doctor (Lew Ayres) believes Belinda isn't dumb at all and thinks he can help improve her life by teaching her sign language.  Belinda proves to be a good student, surprising even her own father (Charles Bickford).  As the doctor continues to open up new worlds to Belinda a bond forms between them.  All of Belinda's new-found joy and discovery is shattered by the dispicable act of a local fisherman and town bully (Stephen McNally).  For a film from this time period, Johnny Belinda tackles some pretty tough territory.  Artistically, it holds up rather well, with many of its scenes filmed on location.  Apart from Wyman's tour de force performance, the cast also includes great performances from Bickford, Agnes Morehead as Belinda's aunt, and Jan Sterling as Lew Ayres's maid and the object of her unrequited love.

Jane Wyman won an Oscar for this performance, where she utters not a word.  The story was based on actual events, and was adapted for the stage, before becoming a film.  Some spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.Black MacDonald (Charles Bickford) is a farmer on Cape Breton Island, in Nova Scotia, who also runs a small flour mill.  Helping him are his daughter Belinda (Wyman), who can't hear or speak, and his sister Aggie (Agnes Moorhead).  A newcomer to the area, Dr. Robert Richardson (Lew Ayers), takes an interest in Belinda, and begins to teach her sign language.  Although her father believes her to be incapable of learning, Belinda proves to be quite intelligent, and makes good progress learning how to sign.Unfortunately, just when things are looking brighter, while alone on the farm, Belinda is attacked and raped by Locky McCormick (Stephen McNally), one of her customers.  The traumatized woman doesn't tell anyone, but it is soon discovered that she is pregnant.  Belinda becomes the mother of a son she names Johnny, as the people of the nearby village speculate that Dr. Richardson is the father.Belinda comes alive as a new mother, and although times are tough, there is great joy on the McDonald farm.  Tragedy soon strikes, as Black MacDonald meets an unfortunate end.  Meanwhile, Locky McCormick has married a woman named Stella (Jan Sterling), who was Richardson's secretary.  Shunned by the villagers, Richardson's practice dries up, and he is forced to take a new position at a hospital in Toronto, although the doctor has plans to marry Belinda.  Later, the closed-minded moralistic people of the village plot to try and take Belinda's son away from her, tragically resulting in the woman being put on trial for murder.While the film's finish is a bit overdramatic, the basic story is one filled with compassion, that takes a look at societal attitudes at the time.  The film also deals with the sensitive subjects of rape, and unwed motherhood, which were not common at the time.  Jane Wyman won an Academy Award for Best Actress, for her sensitive performance that is without any spoken words.  For their strong performances, Lew Ayers, Charles Bickford, and the marvelous Agnes Moorhead, were also nominated for Oscars in their respective categories.  And Stephen McNally and Jan Sterling are also very solid.  Johnny Belinda is a touching drama from the past, that can very easily be appreciated today.",4,Johnny Belinda features a moving Oscar winning performance from Jane Wyman...,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,2675,"['many', 'older', 'films', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', '1948', 'may', 'seem', 'rather', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'give', 'watch', 'may', 'find', 'drama', 'warm', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'deaf-mute', 'woman', 'tries', 'cope', 'life', 'hardships', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'where', 'not', 'word', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', 'becoming', 'film', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk.Black', 'MacDonald', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'farmer', 'Cape', 'Breton', 'Island', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'who', 'also', 'small', 'flour', 'mill', 'Helping', 'are', 'daughter', 'Belinda', 'Wyman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'speak', 'sister', 'Aggie', 'Agnes', 'Moorhead', 'newcomer', 'area', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'Lew', 'Ayers', 'interest', 'Belinda', 'teach', 'sign', 'language', 'father', 'be', 'incapable', 'learning', 'Belinda', 'be', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'good', 'progress', 'learning', 'how', 'sign.Unfortunately', 'just', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'brighter', 'alone', 'farm', 'Belinda', 'attacked', 'raped', 'Locky', 'McCormick', 'Stephen', 'McNally', 'one', 'customers', 'traumatized', 'woman', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'soon', 'discovered', 'pregnant', 'Belinda', 'mother', 'son', 'Johnny', 'people', 'nearby', 'village', 'speculate', 'Dr.', 'Richardson', 'father.Belinda', 'alive', 'new', 'mother', 'times', 'are', 'tough', 'great', 'joy', 'McDonald', 'farm', 'Tragedy', 'soon', 'strikes', 'Black', 'MacDonald', 'unfortunate', 'end', 'Meanwhile', 'Locky', 'McCormick', 'married', 'woman', 'named', 'Stella', 'Jan', 'Sterling', 'who', 'was', 'Richardson', 'secretary', 'Shunned', 'villagers', 'Richardson', 'practice', 'up', 'forced', 'take', 'new', 'position', 'hospital', 'Toronto', 'doctor', 'plans', 'marry', 'Belinda', 'Later', 'closed-minded', 'moralistic', 'people', 'village', 'plot', 'try', 'take', 'Belinda', 'son', 'away', 'tragically', 'resulting', 'woman', 'being', 'put', 'trial', 'murder.While', 'film', 'finish', 'bit', 'overdramatic', 'basic', 'story', 'one', 'filled', 'compassion', 'look', 'societal', 'attitudes', 'time', 'film', 'also', 'sensitive', 'subjects', 'rape', 'unwed', 'motherhood', 'were', 'not', 'common', 'time', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'spoken', 'words', 'strong', 'performances', 'Lew', 'Ayers', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'marvelous', 'Agnes', 'Moorhead', 'were', 'also', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'respective', 'categories', 'Stephen', 'McNally', 'Jan', 'Sterling', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'solid', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'touching', 'drama', 'past', 'can', 'very', 'easily', 'be', 'appreciated', 'today']",N/A

The Academy is known for succumbing to characters with mental or physical afflictions (""The Snake Pit,"" ""Rain Man,"" etc.) When she kneels beside the body of her father (Charles Bickford) and signs The Lord's Prayer, her Oscar was a secret even Price-Waterhouse couldn't keep. The temptation to cynicism, however, is unwise.The picture turns out to be quite affecting. Wyman and Lew Ayres, as the doctor who teaches her to communicate, do some of their best work in ""Johnny Belinda."" After the town bully (Stephen McNally) rapes Belinda, he and his wife (Jan Sterling) attempt to adopt the son (named Johnny) Belinda has by him. Director Jean Negulesco ignores the soap operatics and creates a rugged sense of place, an insular Nova Scotia seaside farming village. The black-and-white cinematography is invaluable here.The supporting cast is fine, and there are memorable touches everywhere. In addition to Wyman's prayer for her father, there's Bickford's pride in his blossoming daughter, and her responses to life's vicissitudes. Agnes Moorehead is the tart-tongued but quietly sympathetic aunt. And Sterling, in her first major role, does not disappoint. What does disappoint is the perfunctory DVD release Warner Bros. has given the studio's own movie, a big hit with audiences in 1948.",4,Sign Language,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1449,"['easy', 'see', 'why', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'limpid', 'eyes', 'winsome', 'smile', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'deaf-mute', 'adaptation', 'play', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'Academy', 'known', 'succumbing', 'characters', 'mental', 'physical', 'afflictions', 'Snake', 'Pit', 'Rain', 'Man', 'etc', 'When', 'kneels', 'body', 'father', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'signs', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'Oscar', 'was', 'secret', 'even', 'Price-Waterhouse', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'temptation', 'cynicism', 'however', 'unwise.The', 'picture', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'affecting', 'Wyman', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'doctor', 'who', 'communicate', 'do', 'best', 'work', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'town', 'bully', 'Stephen', 'McNally', 'Belinda', 'wife', 'Jan', 'Sterling', 'attempt', 'adopt', 'son', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'Director', 'Jean', 'Negulesco', 'soap', 'operatics', 'rugged', 'sense', 'place', 'insular', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'seaside', 'farming', 'village', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'invaluable', 'here.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fine', 'are', 'memorable', 'touches', 'everywhere', 'addition', 'Wyman', 'prayer', 'father', 'Bickford', 'pride', 'blossoming', 'daughter', 'responses', 'life', 'vicissitudes', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'tart-tongued', 'quietly', 'sympathetic', 'aunt', 'Sterling', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'not', 'disappoint', 'What', 'disappoint', 'perfunctory', 'DVD', 'release', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'given', 'studio', 'own', 'movie', 'big', 'hit', 'audiences', '1948']",N/A
