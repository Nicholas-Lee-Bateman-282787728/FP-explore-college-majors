1419890,A1GDVEPEQ9APM,B004MCGNVM,CNS,"[9, 9]","Excellent recap of the entire revolutionary war from start to finish.  While not on par with a Ken Burns epic like ""the civil war"", this breaks down the revolution and shows all the key aspects of both sides, as well as the most important historical figures.  It deals with the struggles and brutal conditions of both sides, and is not afraid to show the darker aspects of our founding fathers.  For example, while praising George Washington for his great leadership and iron will, it notes that Washington was a slave owner who banned negro recruits from joining the army early in the revolution, even though his army was desperately short of manpower.  He also resorted to capitol punishment in the army on multiple occasions when it was on the brink of collapse.The re-enactments and done with superb quality, and match the narration quite effectively.  It's nice to see what the narrator is saying play out right before your eyes.  The actors are also dead ringers for the people they portray.  I was particularly impressed with who they chose for Washington and Ben Franklin.The only major complaint I have is the final two episodes.  They start with Washington's 8-day journey to take up his office as the first President, but end up just being recaps of everything that happened since episode 1.  While it was quite immersive to see Washington reflect on everything he had been through, there is still no getting around the fact that it's just two episodes telling us what we already know from the previous ones.  I would have preferred they have used two episodes to tell us what he did as president, or gone into more detail on what happened from after the revolution to the time he became president.  That wasn't a requirement for the series, as it only says it's about the revolution, but it still would have been a much better use of the final episodes then simple recaps.But overall this is an excellent documentary at a reasonable price.  If you want to learn more about the revolution, this is a pick you can't go wrong with.",4,Great historical documentary,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,2040,"['Excellent', 'recap', 'entire', 'revolutionary', 'war', 'start', 'finish', 'not', 'par', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'civil', 'war', 'down', 'revolution', 'key', 'aspects', 'sides', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'important', 'historical', 'figures', 'struggles', 'brutal', 'conditions', 'sides', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'darker', 'aspects', 'founding', 'fathers', 'example', 'praising', 'George', 'Washington', 'great', 'leadership', 'iron', 'will', 'Washington', 'was', 'slave', 'owner', 'who', 'banned', 'recruits', 'joining', 'army', 'early', 'revolution', 'even', 'army', 'was', 'desperately', 'short', 'manpower', 'also', 'resorted', 'capitol', 'punishment', 'army', 'multiple', 'occasions', 'when', 'was', 'brink', 'collapse.The', 're-enactments', 'done', 'superb', 'quality', 'match', 'narration', 'quite', 'effectively', 'nice', 'see', 'what', 'narrator', 'saying', 'play', 'out', 'right', 'eyes', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'dead', 'ringers', 'people', 'portray', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'who', 'chose', 'Washington', 'Ben', 'Franklin.The', 'only', 'major', 'complaint', 'have', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'start', 'Washington', '8-day', 'journey', 'take', 'up', 'office', 'first', 'President', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'recaps', 'everything', 'happened', 'episode', '1', 'was', 'quite', 'immersive', 'see', 'Washington', 'reflect', 'everything', 'had', 'been', 'still', 'getting', 'fact', 'just', 'two', 'episodes', 'telling', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'previous', 'ones', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'have', 'used', 'two', 'episodes', 'tell', 'what', 'did', 'president', 'gone', 'more', 'detail', 'what', 'happened', 'revolution', 'time', 'became', 'president', 'was', ""n't"", 'requirement', 'series', 'only', 'revolution', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'use', 'final', 'episodes', 'then', 'simple', 'recaps.But', 'overall', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'reasonable', 'price', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'revolution', 'pick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",N/A

It was how it was being told.  The narrator is good but not great.  His enunciation is excellent and is easy to understand but doesn't have a flair which is partly what makes me sit with rapt attention.  By the 2nd DVD, I had become more involved and things started to get interesting.  I found the story behind Benedict Arnold completely facinating since I never knew the whole truth.  Our teachers obviously edited the story when I was growing up and sadly they probably still do.  To me, the price alone was worth that.  What annoyed me were small things like repeating a frame over and over for a different story line.  Then, they did not tell all things chronoligically.  Aside from this, I rank it a 3.5 which is still a very good review rating.

1419897,A1ZSDUCOVDDT0A,B004MCGNVM,Robert e. Lee jr.,"[0, 0]","If you are looking for a ""gung-ho""/winners version of the War of Revolution, look elsewhere. Though a bit 'dry' at times, this 4-disk set attempts to give as close a narrative as could be hoped for about the entire war effort. In so doing, such ambition is bound for shortcomings in the eyes of the purists! We did not gallop to victory on our loyal steads. Rather, we had a lot of help, luck-including the weather (or God, if you prefer?), and some salaciously brave soldiers fighting gorilla tactics in the deep South! The British were a tight, disciplined group fighting for King and Country. They had superior numbers, finances, factory output (if you will) and loyalty. Our fledgling nation was rag-tag, desperate and separated by money, power and [the rest of us]/those only wishing to have their rights to weaponry, religion and a chance to raise and support their families.With such a backdrop, this set of DVDs tries to capture a bit of the emotion, motivations and shortcomings both sides worked with in this truly horrid war. Some grim realities are brought out, but not nearly so bad as can be found in more lurid accounts taken from the diaries of foot soldiers in the fields. Meanwhile, you will find some of the stories we read while going through our own schooling including the one about Francis Scott Keys-still a personal favorite. Add to that the role diplomacy played and find a true hero in Benjamin Franklin-though some might have other thoughts after viewing this?I heartily recommend this History Channel creation to those who cannot rid themselves of a love for studying and viewing the past.
