1113639,A36N93O6F0WJ6E,B000X9NQFY,C.C.N.,"[8, 8]","Bellydance Basics is a great dance companion for a beginning bellydance student. Not only, do you learn a nice choreography, but the methods used in this DVD help to build strength, endurance, and coordination.It includes a warm up & cool down, hip bumps, 5 combination sections that combine several movements, the choreography, and two performances.There is plenty of repetition. Once the combo is broken down, then each combination section is practiced--first slow and then at a faster tempo.  Her break downs and visuals are very clear and straightforward. Some of the best explanations, I have seen, on vertical figure eights, snake arms, and omis. She also teaches a few strength and coordination drills that help the dancer incorporate the movement into ""muscle memory"".Though this dvd covers some of basic technique, know it is not a complete instruction on all the basic bellydance movements. I would definitely recommend this dvd.",5,Excellent!

The woman in this video seems to know what she is doing and is pleasant, she's just fine, but the moves and boring, lengthy repetition were quite disappointing.  I was so excited to use this video, but I decided to pay for another class at the YMCA and won't be using this DVD.The very worst thing, that I find quite deceptive, is that a great deal of the footage on this DVD and the one titled ""Perfect Hips Belly Dance Workout"" are exactly the same - they are the same footage.

If you have to choose between the two pick that one for a workout and this one for a serious dancer's introduction to the dance.  This one has a choreography and the drills are focused on the choreography, where as the other one has extended practice sessions that don't create a choreography (rather, create a great workout instead).",5,Good Introduction to the Dance,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,457,"['DVD', 'similar', 'Michelle', 'Perfect', 'Hips', 'DVD', 'geared', 'wanting', 'belly', 'dance', 'workout', 'have', 'choose', 'two', 'pick', 'one', 'workout', 'one', 'serious', 'dancer', 'introduction', 'dance', 'one', 'choreography', 'drills', 'are', 'focused', 'choreography', 'where', 'other', 'one', 'extended', 'practice', 'sessions', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'choreography', 'rather', 'create', 'great', 'workout', 'instead']",Belly Dance Basics: A Complete Lesson with Choreography for Beginners
