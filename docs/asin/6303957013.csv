Don Ameche's portrayal of Alexander Graham Bell is very nice and sympathetic and one feels his glee when he is happy.  One also sympathizes with him when he gives his heroic speech for the lone inventor in court.  Loretta's portrayal of his wife is very nice as well, a little on the melodramatic side which is typical for the time period.  But still very admirable and enjoyable.  One of the cute vignettes throughout the movie are the comments of Henry Fonda as Bell's assistant Watson.  I laughed at nearly everything he said.

Long a favorite of mine in musical entertainers, Don Ameche proves his mettle in a serious bio of one of America's premiere inventors.  The supporting cast includes Henry Fonda in a secondary role as Bell's assistant, Mr. Watson, and he does a fine job of it. Of course, there is always the reliable and inimitable talents of Charles Coburn to add just enough character to the story and his is a plum role as well.

The tale begins in 1875.  Young Alex Bell is shown eating cheese and apples while trying to send speech over copper wires.  No one thinks much of this idea except the deaf daughter of one of his grudging sponsors (the deaf girl is Loretta Young). Folks were inclined to call it a toy and they kept away from it; Bell himself tended to distust it.  When Bell wants an ambulance, he sends a friend out to call one.  &quot;This thing will never work&quot; he lamented.  But it did of course, and soon the Western Union was trying to claim the patent...Don Ameche does rather well here, playing Bell with surprising conviction.  Henry Fonda is fine as the sensible Mr. Watson as is Charles Coburn as the methodical Mr. Hubbard. The most moving scene in the entire film is when a mute boy, who had never spoken before, enunciates the word &quot;father&quot; (sob!).
