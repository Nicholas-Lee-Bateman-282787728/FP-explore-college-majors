738872,A282A0P69UT137,B00008DDSK,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[25, 25]","This DVD set will bring you the first four episodes of Farscape's third season.  In season's one and two, Farscape's first few episodes were a mixed bag of good to mediocre installments.  That trend ends with the first four episodes of the third season.  The following is a brief summary and review of each:Season of Death-The season premiere sees Crichton left incapacitated, while the rest of the crew attempt to save him. That becomes difficult when a Scarren arrives on the scene looking for Crichton, while at the same time, Scorpius manipulates the situation behind the scenes. This episode also sees Crichton confront and win a victory of the neural clone in his head, and the return of a friend thought to be dead by the crew (though we the fans knew she couldn't be really dead).  This is an action packed adventure episode with compelling emotional drama, and one of Farscape's best installments.Suns and Lovers-D'Argo intends to ask Chiana to marry him, but finds out she has been sleeping with D'Argo's son, Jothee, sending D'Argo and his crewmates on an emotional roller coaster.  In the meantime, Crichton and crew attempt to stop a religious fanatic from destroying a station full of people, and on the way, Aeryn and Crichton have a discussion about relieving some tensions.  All in all, a bit of a soap opera like episode, but still an excellent episode.Self Inflicted Wounds, Parts 1&2-This two part adventure sees Moya collide and become entangled with an alien ship that travels through wormholes.  Crichton attempts to use the opportunity to learn about wormholes, but things get tense when a monster appears on the scene and Moya is sabotaged by an apparently invisible opponent.  In order for the crew to escape, on the crew must sacrifice his or her life to save everyone else.  This story was a little difficult to follow at times, but was an incredibly compelling drama with plenty of action along the way.  The end of the story will leave you reeling from the emotional impact.All of these episodes are definitely representatives of some of Farscape's trully excellent work, with Season of Death being an example of Farscape at its best.

There will be some major shake-ups in the supporting cast and some important story arcs will gain momentum.  We get the resolution of the second season cliffhanger, in which Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) was killed and Crichton (Ben Browder)was left lying on an operating table with the top of his head removed.  The dalliance between Chiana (Gigi Edgely) and Jothee (Matthew Newton), son of D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), is resolved as well.  The first of the big changes comes in the two-part ""Would'A, Could'A, Should'A,"" which has an overly complex plot but some powerful character dynamics and an effective farewell for a beloved cast member.",4,Season 3 starts strong,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,703,"['four', 'episodes', 'get', 'third', 'season', 'strong', 'start', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'shake-ups', 'supporting', 'cast', 'important', 'story', 'arcs', 'will', 'gain', 'momentum', 'get', 'resolution', 'second', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'was', 'killed', 'Crichton', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'was', 'left', 'lying', 'operating', 'table', 'top', 'head', 'removed', 'dalliance', 'Chiana', 'Gigi', 'Edgely', 'Jothee', 'Matthew', 'Newton', 'son', ""D'Argo"", 'Anthony', 'Simcoe', 'resolved', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'big', 'changes', 'two-part', 'Would', 'A', 'Could', 'A', 'Should', 'A', 'overly', 'complex', 'plot', 'powerful', 'character', 'dynamics', 'effective', 'farewell', 'beloved', 'cast', 'member']","Farscape Season 3, Collection 1"

Bernabo,"[19, 19]","At the end of the second season of &quot;Farscape&quot; John Crichton (Ben Browder) was on an operating table with the top of his skull off as Scorpius (Wayne Pygram) has interrupted the surgery to remove the neural chip from his brain and Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) was killed when she was trapped in her ejector chair that crashed into the freezing water on the planet below. Little did we know that the themes of death and seaparation were going to be so powerfully strong during the third season, the first four episodes of which are to be found on these two DVDs:Episode 301, &quot;Season of Death&quot; (Written by Richard Manning, Aired March 16, 2001) has the good news that Scorpius' neural chip has finally been removed from Chrichton outweighed by the fact he can not speak, a &quot;clone&quot; of the personality of Scorpius remains in his mind, and Aeryn is dead awaiting a Peacekeeper's funeral. Although Moya's crew makes a series of touching farewells to Officer Sun, Zhaan (Virginia Hey) has an idea. On the one hand bringing back the leading lady of the series from the dead was a bit too easy, but on the other it is clear in retrospect that we are being set up for a series of much more permanent demises by the end of the season (Four Wormholes).Episode 302, &quot;Suns and Lovers&quot; (Written by Justin Monjo, Aired March 23, 2001), as the title indicates, is a pun on the infamous D.H. Lawrence novel and on target because the lovers end up being Chiana (Gigi Edgley) and Jothee, son of D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe). The main plot has to do with Moya's crew heading to a Commerce Station to spend their spoils, but a violent storm of unnatural origin hits the station. This episode strikes me as more clearing of the decks in terms of stamping out D'Argo's brief period of happiness, which does not strike me as being particularly necessary, although Chiana's motivations for the betrayal are a nice character touch (3 Wormholes).Episode 303, &quot;Self Inflicted Wounds, Part 1: Could'a, Would'a, Should'a&quot; (Written by David Kemper, Aired March 30, 2001) sets up a new problem for the crew when an alien vessel collides with Moya and the two ships sort of merge with each other. However, the more important concern is for Zhaan: it seems that bringing back Aeryn from the dead by performing Unity is costing the priestess her own life. Her only hope is to buried in special soil, which means finding the right sort of planet. Meanwhile, Crichton's hopes are raised by the &quot;appearance&quot; of the Three Stooges (4 Wormholes).Episode 304, &quot;Self Inflicted Wounds, Part 2: Wait for the Wheel&quot; (Written by David Kemper, Aired April 6, 2001), picks up with Zhaan dying, Moya dying, and Pilot in a coma. Breaking away from the wormhole has not solved all of their problems. This becomes a pivotal episode in the &quot;Farscape&quot; series, which no doubt caught many viewers by surprise since it was only the fourth episode of the season and we have a major shake up in the cast of the series. I have to admit, I did not think this was a permanent event until I was about halfway through the third season. A memorable episode in a season that will be providing even bigger changes (5 wormholes).These early episodes from Season 3 are transitional stories that resolve or reset many of the elements from the previous season. But they also set the stage for the two dominant themes of this third season, both of which will be brought home with some of the show's most powerful episodes.",4,The dead and the living trade places as Season 3 starts,1067385600,"10 29, 2003",2003,3519,"['end', 'second', 'season', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'John', 'Crichton', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'was', 'operating', 'table', 'top', 'skull', 'off', 'Scorpius', 'Wayne', 'Pygram', 'interrupted', 'surgery', 'remove', 'neural', 'chip', 'brain', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'was', 'killed', 'when', 'was', 'trapped', 'ejector', 'chair', 'crashed', 'freezing', 'water', 'planet', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'themes', 'death', 'seaparation', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'powerfully', 'strong', 'third', 'season', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'two', 'DVDs', 'Episode', '301', 'quot', 'Season', 'Death', 'quot', 'Written', 'Richard', 'Manning', 'Aired', 'March', '16', '2001', 'good', 'news', 'Scorpius', 'neural', 'chip', 'finally', 'been', 'removed', 'Chrichton', 'outweighed', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'quot', 'clone', 'quot', 'personality', 'Scorpius', 'mind', 'Aeryn', 'dead', 'awaiting', 'Peacekeeper', 'funeral', 'Moya', 'crew', 'series', 'touching', 'farewells', 'Officer', 'Sun', 'Zhaan', 'Virginia', 'Hey', 'idea', 'one', 'hand', 'bringing', 'back', 'leading', 'lady', 'series', 'dead', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'easy', 'other', 'clear', 'retrospect', 'are', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'permanent', 'demises', 'end', 'season', 'Four', 'Wormholes', '.Episode', '302', 'quot', 'Suns', 'Lovers', 'quot', 'Written', 'Justin', 'Monjo', 'Aired', 'March', '23', '2001', 'title', 'pun', 'infamous', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'novel', 'target', 'lovers', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'Chiana', 'Gigi', 'Edgley', 'Jothee', 'son', ""D'Argo"", 'Anthony', 'Simcoe', 'main', 'plot', 'do', 'Moya', 'crew', 'heading', 'Commerce', 'Station', 'spend', 'spoils', 'violent', 'storm', 'unnatural', 'origin', 'station', 'episode', 'more', 'clearing', 'decks', 'terms', 'stamping', 'out', ""D'Argo"", 'brief', 'period', 'happiness', 'not', 'strike', 'being', 'particularly', 'necessary', 'Chiana', 'motivations', 'betrayal', 'are', 'nice', 'character', 'touch', '3', 'Wormholes', '.Episode', '303', 'quot', 'Self', 'Inflicted', 'Wounds', 'Part', '1', 'Could', 'Would', 'Should', 'quot', 'Written', 'David', 'Kemper', 'Aired', 'March', '30', '2001', 'up', 'new', 'problem', 'crew', 'when', 'alien', 'vessel', 'collides', 'Moya', 'two', 'ships', 'sort', 'merge', 'other', 'However', 'more', 'important', 'concern', 'Zhaan', 'bringing', 'back', 'Aeryn', 'dead', 'performing', 'Unity', 'costing', 'priestess', 'own', 'life', 'only', 'hope', 'buried', 'special', 'soil', 'finding', 'right', 'sort', 'planet', 'Meanwhile', 'Crichton', 'hopes', 'are', 'raised', 'quot', 'appearance', 'quot', 'Three', 'Stooges', '4', 'Wormholes', '.Episode', '304', 'quot', 'Self', 'Inflicted', 'Wounds', 'Part', '2', 'Wait', 'Wheel', 'quot', 'Written', 'David', 'Kemper', 'Aired', 'April', '6', '2001', 'up', 'Zhaan', 'dying', 'Moya', 'dying', 'Pilot', 'coma', 'Breaking', 'away', 'wormhole', 'not', 'solved', 'problems', 'pivotal', 'episode', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'series', 'doubt', 'caught', 'many', 'viewers', 'surprise', 'was', 'only', 'fourth', 'episode', 'season', 'have', 'major', 'shake', 'up', 'cast', 'series', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'permanent', 'event', 'was', 'about', 'halfway', 'third', 'season', 'memorable', 'episode', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'providing', 'even', 'bigger', 'changes', '5', 'wormholes', '.These', 'early', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'are', 'transitional', 'stories', 'resolve', 'reset', 'many', 'elements', 'previous', 'season', 'also', 'set', 'stage', 'two', 'dominant', 'themes', 'third', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'home', 'show', 'most', 'powerful', 'episodes']","Farscape Season 3, Collection 1"

To me, this is one of the most entertaining and well made science fiction series ever produced. It was extremely disappointing to find that it was cancelled.  However, the DVD collections of all the seasons is something that every fan will want. Admittedly, some episodes are more interesting than others, but each tells a small part of the Farscape saga and is well worth watching. The interpersonal relationships continue to develop and we see some of the strangest aliens ever seen on a tv screen.

738876,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00008DDSK,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[14, 16]","With season 3 we witness the collison of the bulk of the conflicts at the end of two: Crichton fights and wins a Pyretic victory over ""Harvey"" the neural clone of Scorpi flitting about in his head; Someone close to the crew dies and there are some unexpected departures.I'd have to agree that Season of Death is one of the show's strongest opening episodes. It manages to build on the established story arcs of both seasons 1 and 2. The writing became more consistent as the character's backstories finally stablized. That also gave the actor's considerably more confidence in their roles as well. The visuals are, as always stunning.The arrival on the production staff of a number of Next Generation and DS9 vets (including Richard Manning and Naren Shanker) also brought considerable depth and experience to the production side. While staff writers like Andrew Prowse have done a terrific job with the series, the Next Gen folks provided a different perspective that allowed the conflicts and emotional attachments of the characters additional depth.The DVD's have been improving since the season one batch. Season two still had a number of great extras and the main issue--the DVD menu--has been improved somewhat as well. My only complaint is the focus on a bit too many bottle shows during season three. I realize it's a way to save money and budget out for the bigger episodes but, well, Moya's confined space makes it a bit difficult to continue to come up with strong story ideas. Still, to their credit, the Farscape production crew, staff and actors manage to pull it off.If you're checking out the series for the first time, I'd suggest going back to the highlight set for season one (or better yet pick up the entire boxed set) and then move forward.
