776869,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0000D0YXQ,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[8, 8]","At 84 minutes total, the fourth compilation in the series, ""Boys Life 4 - Four Play"" seems to be the shortest, but the four short features included are better than average for such works.  I'll rate the separately:""l.t.r"" (2003) is a ""mockumentary"" (acted film which claims to be a documentary) about a filmmaker's study of a young twinkish couple, Michael and Riley, who are together several months (Golly!) and are sure they will be ""forever.""  As you can likely guess, the relationship unravels as soon as the cameras start rolling, and the filmmaker drives the final nail in its coffin by supposedly sleeping with the younger of the two.  Interesting in that the dynamics of the couple are rather realistic, and I'm sure you'll see others you know in what is said. (2 stars out of 5)""O Beautiful"" (2002) opens with a high school student coming to the rescue of a schoolmate who had been brutally gaybashed by a group of athletes from their school, and left without his pants in a corn field.  As the plot plays out, it becomes apparent that the rescuer could and should have acted sooner, as he was with the young man's attackers.  It soon becomes apparent that his belated efforts, as well as his suggestions that the attacked boy ""stop this gay stuff"", may mask his own insecurity about his sexuality.  Very eloquent and powerful in its message, though I could have done without the ""split screen"" gimmick used throughout.  The ending is also a bit ridiculous.  (4 stars out of 5)""Bumping Heads"" (2002) is the most professionally shot of the compilation, and features indy (and openly gay) actor Craig Chester as a 35 year old who has a crush on a 24 year old friend, Gary, who wants to remain ""just friends"" (which becomes more emphatic when Craig - the name of his character as well - meets his boyfriend who just moved there to NY.)  The story is told in flashbacks, with most of the humor coming from the differences between the pragmatic Craig and the ""cool dude / himbo"" Gary, to the point where you realize Craig is after someone who really isn't good enough for him, although not being able to have him still hurts.  (3 out of 5)""This Car Up"" (2003) starts with an chance encounter between a businessman and a punkish bicycle messenger, who eventually realize they are infatuated with each other.  I usually don't like cinema ""gimmicks"" in film, but this one is uniquely suited to the story:  We follow the business man on the bottom left of the screen, and the messenger on the bottom right.  Above them is a reflection of their individual thoughts (which often coincide), shown as a slot machine ""reel"" spinning and registering.  Would probably drive one nuts in a full-length film, but it's cutesy for 16 minutes.  (4 stars out of 5)Incidentally, each film has a separate site on IMDB.com, so you might check that out for additional feedback on each title.If you average my reviews for the four shorts, you get (just over) the 3 rating I gave the compilation.  Since most compilations tend to contain at least one or two ""stinkers"" (except for Boys Life 1, which I thought was unusually good) this is as good as most you'll find.",3,Interesting compilation of rather unique shorts,1071705600,"12 18, 2003",2003,3146,"['84', 'minutes', 'total', 'fourth', 'compilation', 'series', 'Boys', 'Life', '4', 'Four', 'Play', 'be', 'shortest', 'four', 'short', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'better', 'average', 'such', 'works', ""'ll"", 'rate', 'separately', 'l.t.r', '2003', 'mockumentary', 'acted', 'film', 'be', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'study', 'young', 'twinkish', 'couple', 'Michael', 'Riley', 'who', 'are', 'together', 'several', 'months', 'Golly', 'are', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'can', 'likely', 'guess', 'relationship', 'unravels', 'as', 'soon', 'cameras', 'start', 'rolling', 'filmmaker', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'supposedly', 'sleeping', 'younger', 'two', 'Interesting', 'dynamics', 'couple', 'are', 'rather', 'realistic', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'others', 'know', 'what', 'said', '2', 'stars', '5', 'O', 'Beautiful', '2002', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'coming', 'rescue', 'schoolmate', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'brutally', 'gaybashed', 'group', 'athletes', 'school', 'left', 'pants', 'corn', 'field', 'plot', 'out', 'apparent', 'rescuer', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'acted', 'sooner', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'attackers', 'soon', 'apparent', 'belated', 'efforts', 'as', 'well', 'suggestions', 'attacked', 'boy', 'stop', 'gay', 'stuff', 'may', 'mask', 'own', 'insecurity', 'sexuality', 'Very', 'eloquent', 'powerful', 'message', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'split', 'screen', 'gimmick', 'used', 'ending', 'also', 'bit', 'ridiculous', '4', 'stars', '5', 'Bumping', 'Heads', '2002', 'most', 'professionally', 'shot', 'compilation', 'features', 'indy', 'openly', 'gay', 'actor', 'Craig', 'Chester', '35', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'crush', '24', 'year', 'old', 'friend', 'Gary', 'who', 'remain', 'just', 'friends', 'more', 'emphatic', 'when', 'Craig', 'name', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'there', 'NY', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'most', 'humor', 'coming', 'differences', 'pragmatic', 'Craig', 'cool', 'dude', '/', 'himbo', 'Gary', 'point', 'where', 'realize', 'Craig', 'someone', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'have', 'still', '3', '5', 'Car', 'Up', '2003', 'chance', 'encounter', 'businessman', 'punkish', 'bicycle', 'messenger', 'who', 'eventually', 'realize', 'are', 'infatuated', 'other', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cinema', 'gimmicks', 'film', 'one', 'uniquely', 'suited', 'story', 'follow', 'business', 'man', 'bottom', 'left', 'screen', 'messenger', 'bottom', 'right', 'reflection', 'individual', 'thoughts', 'often', 'coincide', 'shown', 'slot', 'machine', 'reel', 'spinning', 'registering', 'Would', 'probably', 'drive', 'one', 'nuts', 'full-length', 'film', 'cutesy', '16', 'minutes', '4', 'stars', '5', 'Incidentally', 'film', 'separate', 'site', 'IMDB.com', 'might', 'check', 'out', 'additional', 'feedback', 'title.If', 'average', 'reviews', 'four', 'shorts', 'get', 'just', '3', 'rating', 'gave', 'compilation', 'most', 'compilations', 'tend', 'contain', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'stinkers', 'Boys', 'Life', '1', 'thought', 'was', 'unusually', 'good', 'as', 'good', 'most', ""'ll"", 'find']",Boys Life 4
776870,AI54XO5Z755FH,B0000D0YXQ,"Drake-by-the-Lake ""movie critic""","[3, 3]","Boys Life 3 was dampened by a French dud. Boys Life 4 is all-American, and rocks!Now, granted, we're not talking high art, or anything. What you're looking for here is entertainment a gay man can relate with, that doesn't insult your intelligence, and makes you think.Boys Life 4 fits the bill. I don't understand why other reviewers are dissing this product. My hunch is, they see the first story, about gays on drugs, and it offends their political sensibilities (""What! we're being portrayed smoking pot!"" & etc.)So let me tackle the first story head-on. It's a mock-documentary about a ""long-term relationship"" of a STUNNING two weeks' duration between two twinks. Now if you don't see the humor, sorry for you. I remember back in the day, a week was SERIOUS. This show is supposed to be funny and sad at the time. Anyway, obviously twink #2 is hitting the pipe too much and twink #1 (almost unbelievably cute, cuter than DiCaprio ever was, though both are cute) is dismayed by it all. The worst blow comes when twink #2 boffs the camera guy! This seems like a satire on these silly ""reality"" shows that are all the rage these days.Story #2 takes place at a hospital bed, where an older guy is recuperating from a fight last night. Turns out he was ""protecting"" his younger buddy who actually, maybe, could become his boyfriend. An interesting skit that really is unusual. But once again there is a reference to drug-use, which again, will appall some people. But drugz happens to be an unfortunate reality in the club/single/young gay scene.Story #3 covers the aftermath (thankfully, not the instance) of a gay-bashing from an angle we've never seen before. It is a rather perceptive, painful, but unpredictable drama. I like the exploration of the many moods, feelings and thoughts of the characters. The characters are intelligent, straight-up, real, breathing, red-blooded, and types you've never seen before.Story #4 was also a very unusual short story about a courier and the business guy customer who meet during a package delivery--a perfectly ordinary, humdrum daily business transaction. They can't forget each other. It is lust at first sight. What's so unusual is, the film is shot with four frames, shown at all times. One frame shows the business guy, one frame the courier, and the two frames above display their thoughts. I've never seen anything like this and thought it was very original.All in all, well-deserving of four stars. Whether this is worth twenty-plus dollars though, I can't say, as I rented it out, a recommended practice, besides buying used copies... Probably, they need to include a couple additional stories, to make a total of eight, before marketing this thing. Four is indeed stingy. Times have changed and we can get gay shows from TV nowadays.",4,This was even better than Boys Life 3,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,2788,"['Boys', 'Life', '3', 'was', 'dampened', 'French', 'dud', 'Boys', 'Life', '4', 'all-American', 'rocks', 'Now', 'granted', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'high', 'art', 'anything', 'What', ""'re"", 'looking', 'here', 'entertainment', 'gay', 'man', 'can', 'relate', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'think.Boys', 'Life', '4', 'bill', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'dissing', 'product', 'hunch', 'see', 'first', 'story', 'about', 'gays', 'drugs', 'political', 'sensibilities', 'What', ""'re"", 'being', 'portrayed', 'smoking', 'pot', 'etc', 'So', 'let', 'tackle', 'first', 'story', 'head-on', 'mock-documentary', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'STUNNING', 'two', 'weeks', 'duration', 'two', 'twinks', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'humor', 'sorry', 'remember', 'back', 'day', 'week', 'was', 'SERIOUS', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'sad', 'time', 'Anyway', 'obviously', 'twink', '2', 'hitting', 'pipe', 'too', 'much', 'twink', '1', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'cute', 'cuter', 'DiCaprio', 'ever', 'was', 'are', 'cute', 'dismayed', 'worst', 'blow', 'when', 'twink', '2', 'boffs', 'camera', 'guy', 'satire', 'silly', 'reality', 'shows', 'are', 'rage', 'days.Story', '2', 'place', 'hospital', 'bed', 'where', 'older', 'guy', 'recuperating', 'fight', 'last', 'night', 'out', 'was', 'protecting', 'younger', 'buddy', 'who', 'actually', 'maybe', 'could', 'become', 'boyfriend', 'interesting', 'skit', 'really', 'unusual', 'once', 'again', 'reference', 'drug-use', 'again', 'will', 'appall', 'people', 'drugz', 'happens', 'be', 'unfortunate', 'reality', 'club/single/young', 'gay', 'scene.Story', '3', 'covers', 'aftermath', 'thankfully', 'not', 'instance', 'gay-bashing', 'angle', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'rather', 'perceptive', 'painful', 'unpredictable', 'drama', 'exploration', 'many', 'moods', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'intelligent', 'straight-up', 'real', 'breathing', 'red-blooded', 'types', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.Story', '4', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'unusual', 'short', 'story', 'courier', 'business', 'guy', 'customer', 'who', 'package', 'delivery', 'perfectly', 'ordinary', 'humdrum', 'daily', 'business', 'transaction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'other', 'lust', 'first', 'sight', 'What', 'so', 'unusual', 'film', 'shot', 'four', 'frames', 'shown', 'times', 'One', 'frame', 'business', 'guy', 'one', 'frame', 'courier', 'two', 'frames', 'display', 'thoughts', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'original.All', 'well-deserving', 'four', 'stars', 'worth', 'twenty-plus', 'dollars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'rented', 'out', 'recommended', 'practice', 'buying', 'used', 'copies', 'Probably', 'need', 'include', 'couple', 'additional', 'stories', 'make', 'total', 'eight', 'marketing', 'thing', 'Four', 'indeed', 'stingy', 'Times', 'have', 'changed', 'can', 'get', 'gay', 'shows', 'TV', 'nowadays']",Boys Life 4
