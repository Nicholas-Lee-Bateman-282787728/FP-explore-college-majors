While it has a nice story line, minimal blut &amp; guts, I do not think this is what true Wes Craven fans were thinking when they happened upon this.  I saw the blood on the front cover &amp; read the back and thought it would be a &quot;normal&quot; Wes Craven film, such as others with blood &amp; gore, a decent plot, but all the horror I look for in a Wes Craven film.  I was greatly let down &amp; would like to let people know if you are looking for a horror filled flick, this is NOT the film for you.  This has minimal gore, minimal violence and a high ability to bore you if you are seeking horror.  However, if horror is not your thing and a good plot with some mild depressing losses (the loss of a sister) is what you are looking for, then here is your film!",3,Doesn't fit in with Wes Craven films,1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,832,"['film', 'just', ""n't"", 'blend', 'other', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'films', 'nice', 'story', 'line', 'minimal', 'blut', 'amp', 'guts', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'what', 'true', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'fans', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'happened', 'saw', 'blood', 'front', 'cover', 'amp', 'read', 'back', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'such', 'others', 'blood', 'amp', 'gore', 'decent', 'plot', 'horror', 'look', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'was', 'greatly', 'let', 'down', 'amp', 'would', 'like', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'are', 'looking', 'horror', 'filled', 'flick', 'NOT', 'film', 'minimal', 'gore', 'minimal', 'violence', 'high', 'ability', 'bore', 'are', 'seeking', 'horror', 'However', 'horror', 'not', 'thing', 'good', 'plot', 'mild', 'depressing', 'losses', 'loss', 'sister', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'then', 'here', 'film']",N/A

While posing and taking pictures by a ledge, a girl falls over but Ward catches her and then the girl suddenly cant hold on any longer, so the girl slips falling to her cheesily constructed death scene. Soon after, Ward starts to suffer from fears of heights. Looks like one of those afterschool teen movies kinda with the sploppy camera work and acting as if rubbing two pieces of sand paper together by ones ears. Not much here really and the very disappointing thing is that Wesley Craven put his name on the title.

717051,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00006IUFY,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","Poor Wes Craven...since his main claim to fame is the Freddy Kruger series, you'd think he'd try and do more on his own, instead of adding his name to films to obviously attract his fans.  Fans of Craven certainly won't enjoy this &quot;suspense thrilelr&quot;, as there is hardly any gore, no demons in the night.  However, if Craven had taken this on himself and had a higher budget, and a more fitting cast, DON'T LOOK DOWN could have really been an effective shocker.As it stands, Billy Burke steals the show as Megan Ward's sympathetic husband, who is trying to help his wife through a devastating fear of heights, caused by the untimely death of her younger sister.  Megan Ward is reminiscent of a high school thespian, using overblown theatrical gestures and speeches to play Burke's wife.
