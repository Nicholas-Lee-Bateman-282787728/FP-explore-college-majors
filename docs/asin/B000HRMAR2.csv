(That didn't interest me. )What I did appreciate with workout 2, was that it just flowed better, nothing was chopped up, all the exercises were put together in one segment, where as workout 1 stopped after each &#34;segment&#34; with a title and number, so I did find myself counting the numbers and wondering when I would get to the best part,- the &#34;reverance&#34; lol, or the cool down.So in workout 2 the time just flew by.In workout 1, I really felt the burn in my arms, and preferred some of the exercises a bit better. I actually liked the dancers better, perhaps because they profile the dancers in workout 1 dvd so the personalities come through a little more.Nice to have both in one set so you can switch it up and have the choice!Fabulous music also, and Im not a great classical music fan, but it really is a must for ballet !Enjoy!",5,Workout 2 needs more floor space to do than Workout 1,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,1410,"['Fabulous', 'Cd', 'get', 'bored', 'easily', 'workout', 'videos', 'Ive', 'been', 'doing', 'workout', '1', '2', 'weeks', 'day', 'still', 'not', '2', 'was', 'wonderful', 'also', 'prefer', '1', 'felt', 'had', 'better', 'exercise', 'workout', 'vs', '34', 'Ballet', 'Moves', '34', '2Also', 'kept', 'bumping', 'things', '34', 'dance', 'space', '34', '2-', 'have', 'limited', 'space', 'work', 'out', 'so', '1', 'better', 'fit', 'bill.If', 'want', 'feel', 'ballerina', 'perhaps', '2', 'would', 'better', 'suit', 'ballet', 'dance', 'can', 'learn', 'step', 'step', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'What', 'did', 'appreciate', 'workout', '2', 'was', 'just', 'flowed', 'better', 'nothing', 'was', 'chopped', 'up', 'exercises', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'one', 'segment', 'where', 'workout', '1', 'stopped', '34', 'segment', '34', 'title', 'number', 'did', 'find', 'counting', 'numbers', 'wondering', 'when', 'would', 'get', 'best', 'part', '34', 'reverance', '34', 'lol', 'cool', 'down.So', 'workout', '2', 'time', 'just', 'flew', 'by.In', 'workout', '1', 'really', 'felt', 'burn', 'arms', 'preferred', 'exercises', 'bit', 'better', 'actually', 'liked', 'dancers', 'better', 'perhaps', 'profile', 'dancers', 'workout', '1', 'dvd', 'personalities', 'come', 'little', 'more.Nice', 'have', 'one', 'set', 'can', 'switch', 'up', 'have', 'choice', 'Fabulous', 'music', 'also', 'Im', 'not', 'great', 'classical', 'music', 'fan', 'really', 'must', 'ballet', 'Enjoy']",N/A

I actually enjoy working out and am a bit of a health and fitness freak.  I have done yoga, pilates, stairclimbing (real stairs not a machine), rebounding, kettlebells, weight training, etc.  I have to say I LOVE this ballet workout.  It works!

Now I'm back into it again and I can't believe I ever left it behind.  I feel healthy.  I mean truly healthy.  I have felt fit and strong with the other workouts but with ballet there's just a feeling of well being as well.  For some reason, I feel like I'm really in good shape now than I've ever been with anything else.  It feels like true health not just being fit but truly healthy because I feel flexible as well as strong and that is extremely important.  Anyway, that's my two cents worth.  I know that other reviewers have criticized it for being slow or not having enough reps, or whatever.  First of all, it's ballet, it's not fast, it's controlled and slow.

1015528,A3NUTEF2PQEDN6,B000HRMAR2,"Obama-Mama ""Ballroom Dancer""","[4, 4]","I did both workouts in this set, and found them to be a bit too easy and low-impact. This would be a good workout for a day when one is in ""active recovery"" from a previous days' hard workout; however, I felt I needed more of a challenge. There is also not enough of a cardio section, and the sections in general were quite short, not enough to feel I had really accomplished much in each particular section. I actually enjoyed Elise Gulan's ""Ballet Conditioning"" more as a true workout where I was getting sweatier by the end and was really feeling the burn in my thighs and calves (regardless of the non-traditional setting outdoors and the ""smooth jazz"" type soundtrack in the background). However, the artistry, poise of the dancers, and musical selection of this NYC Ballet Workout set is much more authentic to ballet. I am exploring trying some true ballet classes on DVD by ordering Dmitri Roudnev's ballet DVDs, to see if they offer more of a challenge along with the classical elements of ballet. I have taken basic ballet classes and have danced pretty much all my life, so I think I would be up to the challenge. This DVD set was a good intro, though I can't imagine myself using it that often in the future if I'm presented with more advanced ballet conditioning practices. It would be better for a novice who has had little dance training or someone who wants a low-impact, easily ""do-able"" workout for a first-time exposure to basic ballet dance technique. Each workout is about an hour in length, which is a good length for a workout, but it's true that too much time is spent in transitions between sections and it's difficult to skip tracks (there are ways around this, however, with the fast-forward feature of your DVD player or computer).

1015531,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000HRMAR2,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[338, 352]","Workout 1Ballet improves your posture and gives you a sense of grace even when you are not working out. The New York City Ballet workout presents exercises in a formal ballet style setting. Your body becomes a paintbrush, sweeping along walls and floors in beautiful choreography like an artist painting on black art paper.For minutes at a time you forget you are not a ballerina as you work through the warm-up with first and second position. Fluid movements follow as you move from side to side and then put a spring in your step. A floor routine follows with leg stretches and then you work your abs in every possible way, although each movement is so precise you are getting double the workout in half the time.The unique and challenging postures and dance steps are explained as you are doing them, although at times the choreography takes center stage as the narration lessens and you focus more on the dancers instead of following the cueing.This is a well structured, intermediate to advanced workout that requires a sense of determination, some experience with Pilates and possibly Yoga. The jumps are the most challenging and the entire workout fine tunes your balance. There are 17 exercise sessions and bonus programs including video diaries, behind the scenes footage and interviews.Back exercises appear during the floor workout, but you are using your entire body at all times because most of the workout requires you to be super focused and keep your balance so you may feel this the most in your back after the workout. Throughout the exercises classical music guides you into a peaceful space where you feel relaxed even though you are working out at a fairly high level that requires patience and endurance.Workout 2With frequent pacing changes, you are working out slow one minute and fast the next. The rapid movements get your heart beating faster, but the graceful flowing movements make you feel more relaxed.The narration made me feel very relaxed, so the entire first two-thirds of the second workout seemed more relaxing and centering than invigorating. The exercises begin with a warm-up and progress to dance steps, floor exercises for the abs, legs and arms. During the exercises you do have to count for yourself and there are bonus exercises later in the program that you can add in to your own routine.While I found it much easier to follow the first DVD, the second DVD has much more complex moves and you need a much higher degree of intense concentration and precise balance to enjoy the exercises. Having some split-sole sneakers might help with the jumping, but you can do most of the workout in bare feet or with ballet slippers.The booklet in the second DVD shows more of the exercises and has a glossary for Turnout, Demi Pli&eacute;, Grand Pli&eacute;, Releve, Tendu, D&eacute;gag&eacute;, Pass&eacute;, Fondu, Grand Battement, Changement de pieds, Pas de Basque and Piqu&eacute; Arabesque. On the DVD, all of these are shown in detail in a section in the special features.After trying the workout a few times, you may also want to personalize it and there is a way to select specific exercises and then play them all at once for your own personalized routine. The sections you can choose from include:Upper BodyLower BodyComgined MovementStretchesAbdominal StrengtheningFloor Barre SupineFloor Barre Side LyingFloor Barre PronePli&eacute; & TenduD&eacute;gag&eacute;Pass&eacute; & FonduGrand Battement & Little JumpsReverenceAn inspirational ""Born to Dance"" segment features all the dancers in their daily life and there is also a behind-the-scenes bonus feature as well as a number of promos for fitness studios in New York. What do dancers do after exercising? The first DVD gives a more detailed look into the dancers' lives, but this DVD has a combined section that briefly explores the dancers' interests when not dancing. Overall, the second workout is more complex and progresses into real dance steps so you can feel like a real dancer.~ The Rebecca Review",5,Ballet from the Viewpoint of a Dancer,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,4007,"['1Ballet', 'improves', 'posture', 'sense', 'grace', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'working', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'presents', 'exercises', 'formal', 'ballet', 'style', 'setting', 'body', 'paintbrush', 'sweeping', 'along', 'walls', 'floors', 'beautiful', 'choreography', 'artist', 'painting', 'black', 'art', 'paper.For', 'minutes', 'time', 'forget', 'are', 'not', 'ballerina', 'work', 'warm-up', 'first', 'second', 'position', 'Fluid', 'movements', 'follow', 'move', 'side', 'side', 'then', 'put', 'spring', 'step', 'floor', 'routine', 'leg', 'stretches', 'then', 'work', 'abs', 'possible', 'way', 'movement', 'so', 'precise', 'are', 'getting', 'double', 'workout', 'time.The', 'unique', 'challenging', 'postures', 'dance', 'steps', 'are', 'explained', 'are', 'doing', 'times', 'choreography', 'center', 'stage', 'narration', 'focus', 'more', 'dancers', 'instead', 'following', 'cueing.This', 'well', 'structured', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'sense', 'determination', 'experience', 'Pilates', 'possibly', 'Yoga', 'jumps', 'are', 'most', 'challenging', 'entire', 'workout', 'fine', 'tunes', 'balance', 'are', '17', 'exercise', 'sessions', 'bonus', 'programs', 'including', 'video', 'diaries', 'scenes', 'footage', 'interviews.Back', 'exercises', 'appear', 'floor', 'workout', 'are', 'using', 'entire', 'body', 'times', 'most', 'workout', 'be', 'super', 'focused', 'keep', 'balance', 'may', 'feel', 'most', 'back', 'workout', 'exercises', 'classical', 'music', 'guides', 'peaceful', 'space', 'where', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'even', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'fairly', 'high', 'level', 'patience', '2With', 'frequent', 'pacing', 'changes', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'slow', 'one', 'minute', 'fast', 'next', 'rapid', 'movements', 'get', 'heart', 'beating', 'faster', 'graceful', 'flowing', 'movements', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'relaxed.The', 'narration', 'made', 'feel', 'very', 'relaxed', 'entire', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'second', 'workout', 'seemed', 'more', 'relaxing', 'centering', 'invigorating', 'exercises', 'begin', 'warm-up', 'progress', 'dance', 'steps', 'floor', 'exercises', 'abs', 'legs', 'arms', 'exercises', 'do', 'have', 'count', 'are', 'bonus', 'exercises', 'later', 'program', 'can', 'add', 'own', 'routine.While', 'found', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'first', 'DVD', 'second', 'DVD', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'moves', 'need', 'much', 'higher', 'degree', 'intense', 'concentration', 'precise', 'balance', 'enjoy', 'exercises', 'Having', 'split-sole', 'sneakers', 'might', 'help', 'jumping', 'can', 'do', 'most', 'workout', 'bare', 'feet', 'ballet', 'slippers.The', 'booklet', 'second', 'DVD', 'more', 'exercises', 'glossary', 'Turnout', 'Demi', 'Pli', 'eacute', 'Grand', 'Pli', 'eacute', 'Releve', 'Tendu', 'D', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Pass', 'eacute', 'Fondu', 'Grand', 'Battement', 'Changement', 'de', 'pieds', 'Pas', 'de', 'Basque', 'Piqu', 'eacute', 'Arabesque', 'DVD', 'are', 'shown', 'detail', 'section', 'special', 'features.After', 'trying', 'workout', 'few', 'times', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'personalize', 'way', 'select', 'specific', 'exercises', 'then', 'play', 'once', 'own', 'personalized', 'routine', 'sections', 'can', 'choose', 'include', 'Upper', 'BodyLower', 'BodyComgined', 'MovementStretchesAbdominal', 'StrengtheningFloor', 'Barre', 'SupineFloor', 'Barre', 'Side', 'LyingFloor', 'Barre', 'PronePli', 'eacute', 'TenduD', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Pass', 'eacute', 'FonduGrand', 'Battement', 'Little', 'JumpsReverenceAn', 'inspirational', 'Born', 'Dance', 'segment', 'dancers', 'daily', 'life', 'also', 'behind-the-scenes', 'bonus', 'feature', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'promos', 'fitness', 'studios', 'New', 'York', 'What', 'do', 'dancers', 'do', 'exercising', 'first', 'DVD', 'more', 'detailed', 'look', 'dancers', 'lives', 'DVD', 'combined', 'section', 'briefly', 'dancers', 'interests', 'when', 'not', 'dancing', 'Overall', 'second', 'workout', 'more', 'complex', 'real', 'dance', 'steps', 'can', 'feel', 'real', 'dancer.~', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
