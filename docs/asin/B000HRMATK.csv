I was hoping that it would be cozy and fun and it certainly is!  Our kids were glued to the tv.  The colors are bright and cheery, the story is so nice, and it just has a warm feeling to it.  You have to add this to your Christmas dvd collection!",5,Could be a tradition,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,375,"['Toot', 'Puddle', 'what', 'cute', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'books', 'when', 'saw', 'last', 'year', 'dvd', 'well', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'cozy', 'fun', 'certainly', 'kids', 'were', 'glued', 'tv', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'cheery', 'story', 'so', 'nice', 'just', 'warm', 'feeling', 'have', 'add', 'Christmas', 'dvd', 'collection']",Toot & Puddle: I'll Be Home for Christmas
1015557,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000HRMATK,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[12, 12]","This special aired recently on Noggin and now it's available for all to own on DVD. The DVD comes with a bonus music feature.This special finds Toot headed to Scotland to celebrate his Grandma's one-hundredth birthday. Puddle stays home and gets ready for Christmas with the cute little pig Opal, but Toot promises to be home for Christmas.Once in Scotland, Toot gets a big dose of Scottish culture. He learns traditional Scottish songs, wears a kilt and participates in Scottish Christmas-caroling (though he only hums along.) When it comes time to go home, Toot is hampered by flight delays and such, and worries that he won't make it home. But he discovers new friends, helps out a timid elephant who's afraid of mice (""What can I say? It's genetic."") and celebrates even more international culture.This special has cute animation, winning vocal and instrumental music and a nice plot. My only small nitpick was an excess of scene changes that seemed somewhat unnecessary. Otherwise, excellent special. Hopefully will become a classic.",5,Fantastic Scottish Christmas Special,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1038,"['special', 'aired', 'recently', 'Noggin', 'now', 'available', 'own', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'music', 'special', 'finds', 'Toot', 'headed', 'Scotland', 'celebrate', 'Grandma', 'one-hundredth', 'birthday', 'Puddle', 'home', 'ready', 'Christmas', 'cute', 'little', 'pig', 'Opal', 'Toot', 'be', 'home', 'Christmas.Once', 'Scotland', 'Toot', 'big', 'dose', 'Scottish', 'culture', 'traditional', 'Scottish', 'songs', 'kilt', 'participates', 'Scottish', 'Christmas-caroling', 'only', 'along', 'When', 'time', 'go', 'home', 'Toot', 'hampered', 'flight', 'delays', 'such', 'worries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'home', 'new', 'friends', 'out', 'timid', 'elephant', 'who', 'afraid', 'mice', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'genetic', 'even', 'more', 'international', 'culture.This', 'special', 'cute', 'animation', 'winning', 'vocal', 'instrumental', 'music', 'nice', 'plot', 'only', 'small', 'nitpick', 'was', 'excess', 'scene', 'changes', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'unnecessary', 'Otherwise', 'excellent', 'special', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'become', 'classic']",Toot & Puddle: I'll Be Home for Christmas

1015560,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000HRMATK,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","My 6.5-year-old has loved watching the Toot and Puddle cartoons on Nick,J.R. and she loved reading the stories when she was younger. When she spied this title at our local library, she asked if we could check it out. At first I wondered if it would be too 'young' for her, but after watching it with her this afternoon, I have to say this production can be enjoyed by children of varying ages, and I myself found it enchanting!Though it's a holiday-themed movie, we both enjoyed watching it together. Best friends Toot and Puddle are the stars of the show, and the story revolves around Toot trying his best to get back home to Woodcock Pocket in time for Christmas. Toot has made a promise to Puddle and knows that he must do all he can to keep his promise. Luckily for Toot, luck is on his side, and there is some extra bit of help from another.Aside from the movie, there are special features, i.e. a sing a-long, and also Toot's Trip to Scotland which is a sort of brief guided tour through various locations that Toot visits on his trip such as Edinburgh Castle, Old Stirling Bridge, Scottish Highlands, Loch Lomond, and The Trossachs.",5,The lovable Toot and Puddle in a holiday special,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,1140,"['6.5-year-old', 'loved', 'watching', 'Toot', 'Puddle', 'cartoons', 'Nick', 'J.R', 'loved', 'reading', 'stories', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'When', 'spied', 'title', 'local', 'library', 'asked', 'could', 'check', 'out', 'first', 'wondered', 'would', 'be', 'too', ""'young"", 'watching', 'afternoon', 'have', 'say', 'production', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'children', 'varying', 'ages', 'found', 'enchanting', 'holiday-themed', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'together', 'Best', 'friends', 'Toot', 'Puddle', 'are', 'stars', 'show', 'story', 'around', 'Toot', 'trying', 'best', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'Woodcock', 'Pocket', 'time', 'Christmas', 'Toot', 'made', 'promise', 'Puddle', 'must', 'do', 'can', 'keep', 'promise', 'Luckily', 'Toot', 'luck', 'side', 'extra', 'bit', 'help', 'another.Aside', 'movie', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'i.e', 'sing', 'a-long', 'also', 'Toot', 'Trip', 'Scotland', 'sort', 'brief', 'guided', 'tour', 'various', 'locations', 'Toot', 'visits', 'trip', 'such', 'Edinburgh', 'Castle', 'Old', 'Stirling', 'Bridge', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'Loch', 'Lomond', 'Trossachs']",Toot & Puddle: I'll Be Home for Christmas
