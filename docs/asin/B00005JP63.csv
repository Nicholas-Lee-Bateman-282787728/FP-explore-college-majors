645741,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JP63,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 1]","`Notes on a Scandal' at first glance may be off putting for its subject matter.  Taking taboo content, the movie walks a tightrope, yet provides plenty of wit and intelligence.  Elderly teacher, Barbara (Judi Dench) narrates her journal as she reflects, ""People have always trusted me with their secrets, but whom can I trust with mine...You...,"" she confides.  You becomes Sheba Hart, (Kate Blanchet), a new art teacher at their London St. George's School.  With sarcastic wit, Barbara reflects upon her disdain of Sheba, which comes off as ""fox and grapes"" jealousy.  Describing herself as a ""battle-axe"" and ruling with ""cattle prod and prey,"" Barbara, despite her credentials, has an incomplete existence.  Breaking up a key fight involving two students that Sheba could not contain, Barbara makes her young beneficiary feel beholden.  Naturally, the two start to bond with dinners at Sheba's house.  Here the husband (Bill Nighy) is noticeably older than Sheba, and she is burdened with a daughter who has a demandingly perky adolescence and a son who has Down's Syndrome.  Stretched resources to the fullest, she feels a group of needs being unmet.  Sheba starts to unbosom to her sage older friend.  Mutually, they serve each other well--especially, later when Barbara glimpses her having sexual relations with one of her students.  With professional and legal considerations, Barbara offers some advice that may be beneficial to them both.Suspicious, I thought 'Notes on a Scandal' would be an enabling event that tried to soft-pedal or exploit a taboo not meant to be broken.  The news headlines have already broken through, and 'Notes on a Scandal' is good at unraveling the abusive depravity while offering a revealing cross-section of human nature.  The performances are so excellent that all previous assessments almost seem rash or overdone.  Director, Richard Eyre and screenwriter Patrick Marber have assembled a singular achievement.  Furthermore, Philip Glass provides an effective score with both traditional and innovative elements--just as brilliant as the movie.  With witty dialogue and a scintillating story, 'Notes on a Scandal' is a film to bookmark.

645747,AULVPU9J2YQJL,B00005JP63,Amazon Customer,"[10, 25]","""Notes on a Scandal"":  Dark and trashy.  That's what I would call this film.  If you want a film that ends with depression in the same way that ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" did, this one's for you.  I'm really surprised that Judi Dench would do a film of this sort after seeing her in the pleasant ""As Time Goes By"" BBC series.  In America, we don't know all of Dame Judi's exploits in various films - but if you base your opinion of her acting on her PBS show, ""As Time Goes By"", then you will be disappointed.  She plays a school marm (Barbara) in her sixties in a school in England in which no one really likes her.  At first you don't really know why.  The next character is a young, beautiful, blonde teacher (Cate Blanchett) named Sheba, who is befriended by the school marm and they embark on a strange friendship of convenience.  You realize later that Barbara is manipulative.  You realize this by her thoughts being dubbed-over her contemplative gazes.  She is scheming against Sheba - to force her to be her friend (or more).  Sheba simultaneously is being manipulated by a supposedly sweet young student (15 years old) into a sexual affair.  Since her marriage (to a man approximately 25 years her senior) is dominated by her husband's preoccupation with his Downs Syndrome child of 10 and 14 year old daughter, she seems sexually neglected and one day decides against her better judgment to take the boy up on his proposals.  The boy is from the rough side of town, knows the ropes, and takes advantage of her recent addiction to his sexual prowess. She states to him, ""You done my brain in"" after their first encounter.  When Barbara chances upon their rendezous in one of the school rooms (during a play to which everyone else in the school is in attendance), she decides not to tell the faculty after she confronts Sheba about it and uses this secret to attempt to form a relationship of dependence between her and Sheba.  She tells Sheba that she will not tell anyone but she must not see the boy privately ever again, but she soon gives in to the boy's persistant telephone text messages mentioning what he was planning to do to her again and they resume activities.  A certain man of the school faculty comes to Barbara hoping she will talk to Sheba and be their matchmaker but Barbara rather uses this opportunity to bring this scandal out into the open as revenge for being jilted by Sheba.  The young woman seeks comfort and pity from the boy when the story breaks and the News Hounds surround her house but she gets none.  He's as street-wise as a pimp, chides her for bringing problems and says, ""It's supposed to fun.""  She goes to jail for 10 months for her affair with the young man and returns home to her husband who hesitantly receives her back home - in a strange silence.  The movie ends with Barbara trying to befriend yet another young woman on a park bench.  The End.After viewing, I realized that my wife and I wasted $20.  Robin is a Dame Judi Dench fan but was also disappointed in its dark content.  Judi Dench's character in ""As Time Goes By"" is great.  This film, ""Notes on a Scandal"", is terrible and the writers and producers should hang their heads in shame.

The teacher (Sheba Harte) is played by Cate Blanchett.  Her little secret, however, is discovered by the school's ""battle-axe"", Barbara Covett, as played by Judi Dench who proposes to blackmail her.  The rationale for the blackmail is that Covett has a sexual interest in Sheba.  Inevitably, the charade falls to pieces and the consequences are terrible.

There is something that I just can't put my finger on that seems absent.  I am sure my view will be in a minority.  I suspect this film will receive much praise; indeed, adulation.  This will largely be warranted.  But there is a piece missing that prevents me from recommending it without exception.For all my doubts, I can still suggest that the film is worth seeing.  It will attract a largely art house following which is unfortunate.  The film has true merit and deserves a wider audience.  Any film that pits Judi Dench against Cate Blanchett with a great supporting role for Bill Nighy should be seen.  I am sure that higher accolades await the players.  Yet, as I have already said, there remains an emptiness when the film finishes.  Perhaps a more stunning denouement and less time spent on building the characters would have helped.

645750,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JP63,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","The subject matter of `Notes on a Scandal' may shock and offend some.  The storyline follows a torrid affair between a middle-aged teacher and her fifteen-year-old student.  That is not all though.  The story is told from the perspective of an older teacher who has lusty feelings for the guilty teacher and thus uses the affair as blackmail to gain control of her life.Sheba Hart is a young teacher, in her mid-thirties I would guess; married to an older man, mother to a teenage daughter and a special needs son.  Barbara Covett is an older teacher who lives alone with her cats and has a hard time keeping close friends.  This is most likely due to her chilly demeanor and controlling and manipulative gestures; but who am I to judge.  Sheba is beautiful in appearance and draws the attention of one young boy in the school, Steven Connolly.  She also draws the attention of Barbara, an infatuation that proves disastrous.  Barbara, determined to form a relationship with Sheba, pursues her and ultimately catches her in a compromising position with Steven, a position she uses in order to get control of her life.  Instead of turning Sheba in, Barbara takes advantage of the opportunity to prove friendship and loyalty to Sheba; all she asks of in return is Sheba's unfailing devotion.`Notes on a Scandal' does a masterful job of fleshing out Barbara's malicious and domineering qualities, thanks in large part to Dame Judi Dench's masterful performance.  What it fails to really do is flesh out Sheba.  We understand that Sheba is not fully satisfied with her marriage, but it's never made clear as to why.  Whenever she is shown with her family she seems to be having a wonderful time.  We understand also that she has had a hard time raising her son, but she never shows any signs of resentment or irritation towards him or her situation.  She mentions that Steven's advancements made her feel wanted and special and that she felt as though she deserved this one bad act because she had been good all her life.  This makes the most sense, I just wish that the film had expounded on that.That is my one main issue with `Notes on a Scandal'.  A film of this nature requires a running time of at least two hours in order to truly be effective.  The ninety minutes allow for `Notes...' to become a decent thriller but fails to allow it to become the intricate character study it's longing to be.  We get to see and feel Barbara's indecent longings but never truly get inside Sheba and thus Barbara's longings become unwarranted, for we as the audience can't understand Sheba's draw.  Yes, she is attractive and flirtatious and impish in a way, but is there any depth to Barbara's passions for her.  Is there something under the surface that makes Barbara confess ""this is the one I've been waiting for""?As a result of the short running time we are forced to side with Sheba even though her actions are repulsive.  By never really allowing us to know her we in effect feel sorry for her for she is painted as the victim of a sick and twisted game.  Barbara, who is obviously the super villain here, takes the place of Sheba's horrific act and Sheba thus demands our sympathies.  Had the fill stretched out another thirty to forty minutes we may have been able to truly separate the two instances and found the evil in both characters.Still, much must be said for the impressive acting on the part of everyone in the cast.  Dame Judi Dench is marvelous as Barbara.  She really got under her characters skin and in effect got under mine as well.  I get the feeling that Judi is always playing Judi though.  In almost every film role she does you get that same arrogance that permeates her last performance.  It never seems like a stretch for her.  That said; this is her finest performance to date for that arrogance pays off beautifully.  Cate Blanchett is a beautiful and talented actress who commands the screen as Sheba.  Despite the fact that the script barely allows her to become real to us Cate still masterfully weaves through Sheba's actions and motives.  Bill Nighy also amazed me as Sheba's betrayed husband Richard.  His final explosion on Sheba is heartbreaking and real.In the end `Notes on a Scandal' is a fine film, a tightly woven thriller, and when taken as such it proves to be quite satisfying.  It fleshes out well the consequences of obsession and the follies of lust, at least on the part of Barbara's character.

Although not as physical as Fatal Attraction, Notes on a Scandal certainly has enough tension and superb acting to keep one glued to the screen.The story is that of an exceptionally lonely old school teacher named Barbara played by Dame Judi Dench (Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)). When a beautiful butterfly wafts into her school, she sees an opportunity for a friend ...and perhaps more. This pretty specter comes in the form of Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett,Babel). She's a woman married to a much older man (Bill Nighy,Shaun of the Dead) which creates an interesting problem. Wanting much more attraction than her husband can obviously give, Sheba does a 180 and finds herself attracted to -- and eventually sexually involved with -- one of her fifteen-year-old students named Steven (Andrew Simpson).Barbara is obviously jealous of the attention heaped upon Sheba, and when she learns of Sheba's involvement with a student, Barbara sees an opportunity to rid herself of her loneliness. Writing candidly in her journal, Barbara explains her own sudden increased infatuation with Sheba, both psychologically and physically. We also begin learning about a previous failed relationship (or was it?) Barbara had with another young teacher (female) at the school. This other person supposedly left for unknown reasons, but Barbara knows the truth. Did she drive her away? When we learn that there's a restraining order against Barbara from this other woman, the audience sees more and more cracks in her mind.When Sheba's involvement with her student hits the headlines, her home and professional life come tumbling down. And who's there to catch her? Yep. Barbara. But when Sheba gets ahold of Barbara's diary, she understands that this damaged woman has been the catalyst behind every bad thing that's happened to her since her arrival at the school.The great thing about this flick is the continual upping of tension that builds to a crescendo as the storylines culminate. Bill Nighy does a fine job in a serious role as the elder husband of Sheba. He's both compassionate and dramatic in his representation. Cate Blanchett also pulls in a fine performance as the damaged Sheba. Her battles with Barbara (Dench) are some of the most taught sections of the entire production.

645761,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B00005JP63,Bookphile,"[14, 15]","This is yet another example of fine British cinema.  What makes it so singular for an American like me is this is a movie that centers around two women, where said two women have most of the screen time, and where the male characters are secondary.  It proves in a most masterful way that movies about women can be complex, interesting, and every bit as compelling as movies that center around male characters.  And with two such stellar actresses as Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett, how could the moviegoer go wrong?This movie is a really wonderful and intricate character study.  Though Blanchett's character sounds like she should be the villain, having violated one of the most sacred trusts the public places in its schools, Dench's character is no less menacing.  What is truly astonishing about this film is how Blanchett's character comes out as more sympathetic in the end.  What Sheba does is abhorrent but it is also horrifying to watch how Barbara tries her best to catch Sheba in her net.  Though Sheba's actions are morally repugnant, she is not without a conscience and she knows that what she has done is wrong and that it will tear her family, her school, and her young lover's life apart.  Barbara, on the other hand, is a textbook sociopath.  Though initially enraged over discovering Sheba's affair, she decides to use it to her advantage so that she can back Sheba into a corner.  Barbara doesn't care about the student and she doesn't really care about Sheba either.  All she cares about is winning her prize.  She is a ruthless predator.Blanchett is fantastic as Sheba.  She makes the character three dimensional so that the viewer can understand what has driven her to commit such a heinous act, though her reasons for it do not in any way excuse her actions.  Still, it is really an experience to watch a film and see a villain who is multi-faceted and who reminds the viewer that all humans are fallible.  She is a woman with a sickness, a woman who is deeply disturbed and who sets into motion a chain of events that she hasn't the least idea how to stop.  Watching her life unravel is visceral and though she deserves to be punished it is still alarming to watch her walk right into the trap Barbara has set for her.As for Dench, she is simply incomparable.  Barbara is completely without feelings for anyone other than herself and she is incapable of understanding the pain of others.  She is like a spider, slowly spinning her web and waiting patiently for her victims to become entrapped within her threads.  Every scene that she is in is filled with such creepiness that it sends a shiver down the spine of the viewer.  What is worse, she has established a pattern of behavior and suffers no consequences because of it.  In this way, the film poses another interesting moral question.  That people like Barbara exist is undeniable and that they get away with their actions goes without saying.  While society certainly needs to protect itself from those whose crimes are transparent, what about those of someone like Barbara, who quietly set about destroying the lives of others.Hollywood needs to take a hint from British cinema.  If you take a strong story with interesting characters and cast formidable actors in the lead roles, people will not only see the movie, they will absorb it.  Since this film is entirely devoid of explosions and high-speed chases, however, I will assume that Hollywood won't be emulating it any time soon.  In that case, I will continue to look to the British filmmakers.",5,Chilling,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3533,"['yet', 'example', 'fine', 'British', 'cinema', 'What', 'so', 'singular', 'American', 'movie', 'centers', 'two', 'women', 'where', 'said', 'two', 'women', 'have', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'where', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'secondary', 'most', 'masterful', 'way', 'movies', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'complex', 'interesting', 'bit', 'as', 'compelling', 'movies', 'center', 'male', 'characters', 'two', 'such', 'stellar', 'actresses', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'how', 'could', 'moviegoer', 'go', 'wrong', 'movie', 'really', 'wonderful', 'intricate', 'character', 'study', 'Though', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'villain', 'having', 'violated', 'one', 'most', 'sacred', 'trusts', 'public', 'places', 'schools', 'Dench', 'character', 'less', 'menacing', 'What', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'film', 'how', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'out', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'end', 'What', 'Sheba', 'abhorrent', 'also', 'horrifying', 'watch', 'how', 'Barbara', 'best', 'catch', 'Sheba', 'net', 'Sheba', 'actions', 'are', 'morally', 'repugnant', 'not', 'conscience', 'what', 'done', 'wrong', 'will', 'tear', 'family', 'school', 'young', 'lover', 'life', 'apart', 'Barbara', 'other', 'hand', 'textbook', 'sociopath', 'initially', 'enraged', 'discovering', 'Sheba', 'affair', 'use', 'advantage', 'can', 'back', 'Sheba', 'corner', 'Barbara', ""n't"", 'care', 'student', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Sheba', 'about', 'winning', 'prize', 'ruthless', 'predator.Blanchett', 'fantastic', 'Sheba', 'character', 'three', 'dimensional', 'viewer', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'driven', 'commit', 'heinous', 'act', 'reasons', 'do', 'not', 'way', 'actions', 'Still', 'really', 'experience', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'villain', 'who', 'multi-faceted', 'who', 'viewer', 'humans', 'are', 'fallible', 'woman', 'sickness', 'woman', 'who', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'who', 'motion', 'chain', 'events', ""n't"", 'least', 'idea', 'how', 'stop', 'Watching', 'life', 'unravel', 'visceral', 'be', 'punished', 'still', 'alarming', 'watch', 'walk', 'right', 'trap', 'Barbara', 'set', 'her.As', 'Dench', 'simply', 'incomparable', 'Barbara', 'completely', 'feelings', 'anyone', 'other', 'incapable', 'understanding', 'pain', 'others', 'spider', 'slowly', 'spinning', 'web', 'waiting', 'patiently', 'victims', 'become', 'entrapped', 'threads', 'scene', 'filled', 'such', 'creepiness', 'shiver', 'down', 'spine', 'viewer', 'What', 'worse', 'established', 'pattern', 'behavior', 'consequences', 'way', 'film', 'interesting', 'moral', 'question', 'people', 'Barbara', 'exist', 'undeniable', 'get', 'away', 'actions', 'saying', 'society', 'certainly', 'protect', 'crimes', 'are', 'transparent', 'what', 'someone', 'Barbara', 'who', 'quietly', 'set', 'destroying', 'lives', 'others.Hollywood', 'needs', 'take', 'hint', 'British', 'cinema', 'take', 'strong', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'cast', 'formidable', 'actors', 'lead', 'roles', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'absorb', 'film', 'entirely', 'devoid', 'explosions', 'high-speed', 'chases', 'however', 'will', 'assume', 'Hollywood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'emulating', 'time', 'soon', 'case', 'will', 'continue', 'look', 'British', 'filmmakers']",Notes on a Scandal

Barbara (Judi Dench) is a hardened, long-term instructor who rules her classroom with an iron fist.  Sheba (Cate Blanchett) is a newly hired art teacher who finds herself overwhelmed when a couple of her gangly, adult-sized male students get in a fistfight in her class.Barbara breaks it up and Sheba, feeling grateful for the intervention, initiates a friendship.  But Barbara is more than she seems:  flinty and abrasive, she lives alone with her beloved cat and keeps obsessive journals filled with caustic observations of her coworkers.  Soon her journals take on the distinctly desperate tone of pent-up desire and unrequited love as she writes on and on about Sheba.Poor Sheba has no idea.  She welcomes Barbara into her unconventional household where she and her much older husband are attempting to raise their very dependent Down's Syndrome son.  If Barbara is flinty and calculating, then Sheba seems on the verge of flying to pieces.  Cate Blanchett, in an equally good performance, keeps Sheba breathless, overwhelmed, and distracted much of the time.But then Sheba stumbles impulsively into a compromising situation with a beautiful, but underage, male student.  Barbara finds out about it and realizes that she has all the leverage she needs to blackmail Sheba:  not that she wants to do it because she'd rather have power over Sheba to keep the attractive art teacher under her thumb.This is not a masterpiece; it is good, however.  Very British, gritty, and psychological.

In the saucy new thriller ""Notes On a Scandal,"" we're let in on the prickly diary entries of Barbara Covett (played with relish by Judi Dench), the grumpy, frumpy schoolteacher who takes an immediate shine to Blanchett's Sheba Hart. (The characters' names in ""Scandal"" have nothing on symbolic subtlety.)These narrated journal entries however read more like a devious, escalating plan than one's detail of daily events.

When new art teacher Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) arrives on the scene, Barbara writes about her obvious ""fey"" attitudes and appearance, but later rushes to her defense when the young woman becomes overwhelmed in trying to stop a playground fight.  Striking up a friendship, Barbara is invited into Sheba's family home, and begins to develop a strong attachment.But when Barbara catches Sheba in a compromising position with one of her 15-year-old students (Andrew Simpson), the friendship shatters.  Barbara decides this is the perfect way to keep a firm hold on Sheba's loyalty: ""There was a magnificent opportunity here. With stealth, I might secure the prize long-term, forever in my debt. I could gain everything by doing nothing"".  But it's not long until Barbara leaks the information to a fellow teacher and Sheba is arrested by the authorities.  With nowhere else to go, Sheba is invited to stay with Barbara, but when she accidentally uncovers Barbara's poison-fuelled diaries, the situation becomes explosive...NOTES ON A SCANDAL is a riveting movie experience, capped off by the virtuoso performances of Blanchett and Dench, who both invest their characters with untold pathos and depth.  Judi Dench in particular impresses in one of her rare turns as the villain.  The character of Barbara, a closeted lesbian with shrewd opinions of all and sundry, is a marvel to watch, yet there is still something endearing and sympathetic to make her appealing to an audience.

They played off each other quite well-especially Dench who is usually such a scene-stealer. Dench plays Barbara, a rather callous loner and a teacher at the same school where Blanchett (Sheba Hart) meets her 15yr old, secret love-interest. Barbara learns her secret but keeps it to herself. Her interest in Sheba goes beyond a friendly protectiveness; she becomes possessive. I liked the basic plotline as it's not a typical story of blackmail like Fatal Attraction. Fatal Attraction worked well because of the fear element-we know Glen Close's character is ruthless and smart-but Barbara's character in this film doesn't come close. She's rather a loose cannon, actually. She doesn't appear to be very good at blackmail so are we supposed to feel sorry for her? She's incapable of having any sort of relationship, and she doesn't appear to have the character confidence, or heartlessness, to inflict harm. The was so much opportunity for this story to be more compelling, but it was incredibly tame. For it to work, Barbara would have to gradually become better at her game and demand more of Sheba. There were already sexual undertones about that relationship and that's where this film could've been more powerful. As it was, I think the film hit a plateau early on and there was no real escalation, not even in the confrontation scene. I would recommend this film for the performances-they were wonderful considering the story didn't give them more opportunities.",3,Not What It Could Have Been,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,1574,"['wanted', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'enthralled', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'Blanchett', 'Denchs', 'performances', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'quite', 'well-especially', 'Dench', 'who', 'usually', 'such', 'scene-stealer', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'rather', 'callous', 'loner', 'teacher', 'same', 'school', 'where', 'Blanchett', 'Sheba', 'Hart', '15yr', 'old', 'secret', 'love-interest', 'Barbara', 'secret', 'herself', 'interest', 'Sheba', 'friendly', 'protectiveness', 'possessive', 'liked', 'basic', 'plotline', 'not', 'typical', 'story', 'blackmail', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'worked', 'well', 'fear', 'element-we', 'know', 'Glen', 'Close', 'character', 'ruthless', 'smart-but', 'Barbara', 'character', 'film', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'rather', 'loose', 'cannon', 'actually', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'blackmail', 'so', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'incapable', 'having', 'sort', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'character', 'confidence', 'heartlessness', 'inflict', 'harm', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'opportunity', 'story', 'be', 'more', 'compelling', 'was', 'incredibly', 'tame', 'work', 'Barbara', 'would', 'have', 'gradually', 'become', 'better', 'game', 'demand', 'more', 'Sheba', 'were', 'already', 'sexual', 'undertones', 'relationship', 'where', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'was', 'think', 'film', 'hit', 'plateau', 'early', 'was', 'real', 'escalation', 'not', 'even', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'performances-they', 'were', 'wonderful', 'considering', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'opportunities']",Notes on a Scandal
645771,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JP63,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","I was not prepared to see such a powerful film and I must attribute my reaction to the incredible acting of Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. It is a film about a young woman who makes some poor decisions that spin out of control and destroys her life and her family. However, there is an added twist in that a very lonely, unhappy, and devious colleague uses the situation to meet some long festering unmet needs. Sheba, played by Cate Blanchett, is an art teacher, newly hired into a high school. She makes the tragic mistake of beginning a sexual affair with a 15 year old boy, a totally losing proposition that can only end in disaster. Sheba's husband is older than she, possibly by the same age spread as between her and the young fellow with whom she becomes lovers. All of the motives behind Sheba's mistaken choices are never fully revealed, but I found this to be highly realistic for we all have loved ones and family and friends who make terrible choices and we never fully understand how in the world they would make such terrible choices. The affair becomes known to Barbara, a history teacher, played to absolute perfection by Judi Dench. Barbara is one of the most complex and interesting characters to show up in a film in years and Dench is incredible in her portrayal of this warped and lost soul. Barbara is a desperate and lonely woman, living in a semi-fantasy world, who uses this knowledge to gain intimacy with Sheba, on whom she has a sexual obsession. Thus the brilliance of the film is that Sheba is somewhat of a sympathetic figure because we gradually learn that the boy is highly manipulative and that Sheba has become a wounded butterfly that is gradually falling into Barbara's web.  It is also a strength of the film that Barbara is not played as crazy or as a 2-dimensional villain but rather as a pathetic lonely woman living in a world of imagined romance and intimacy. She mistakenly thinks that power over another woman would be the key to bring someone into her lonely life as her partner. Judi Dench portrays Barbara as a complex lonely human being who mistakenly thinks she can capture and control intimacy. The characters in this film feel fully human. Of course it is the screenplay as well as the actors who create this illusion of entering into the painful world of others and the script is haunting. Needless to say the film is for adults only due to its complex and controversial subject matter and such a tragic situation can only end badly for everyone involved.",5,Dench and Blanchett are overwhelmingly powerful in this film,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,2509,"['was', 'not', 'prepared', 'see', 'such', 'powerful', 'film', 'must', 'attribute', 'reaction', 'incredible', 'acting', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'poor', 'decisions', 'spin', 'control', 'life', 'family', 'However', 'added', 'twist', 'very', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'devious', 'colleague', 'situation', 'meet', 'long', 'festering', 'unmet', 'needs', 'Sheba', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'art', 'teacher', 'newly', 'hired', 'high', 'school', 'tragic', 'mistake', 'beginning', 'sexual', 'affair', '15', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'totally', 'losing', 'proposition', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'disaster', 'Sheba', 'husband', 'older', 'possibly', 'same', 'age', 'spread', 'young', 'fellow', 'whom', 'lovers', 'motives', 'Sheba', 'mistaken', 'choices', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'revealed', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'realistic', 'have', 'loved', 'ones', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'make', 'terrible', 'choices', 'never', 'fully', 'understand', 'how', 'world', 'would', 'make', 'such', 'terrible', 'choices', 'affair', 'known', 'Barbara', 'history', 'teacher', 'played', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'interesting', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'film', 'years', 'Dench', 'incredible', 'portrayal', 'warped', 'lost', 'soul', 'Barbara', 'desperate', 'lonely', 'woman', 'living', 'semi-fantasy', 'world', 'who', 'knowledge', 'gain', 'intimacy', 'Sheba', 'whom', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'Thus', 'brilliance', 'film', 'Sheba', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'gradually', 'learn', 'boy', 'highly', 'manipulative', 'Sheba', 'become', 'wounded', 'butterfly', 'gradually', 'falling', 'Barbara', 'web', 'also', 'strength', 'film', 'Barbara', 'not', 'played', 'crazy', '2-dimensional', 'villain', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'lonely', 'woman', 'living', 'world', 'imagined', 'romance', 'intimacy', 'mistakenly', 'power', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'key', 'bring', 'someone', 'lonely', 'life', 'partner', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'complex', 'lonely', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'can', 'capture', 'control', 'intimacy', 'characters', 'film', 'feel', 'fully', 'human', 'course', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'who', 'create', 'illusion', 'entering', 'painful', 'world', 'others', 'script', 'haunting', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'adults', 'only', 'due', 'complex', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'tragic', 'situation', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'badly', 'everyone', 'involved']",Notes on a Scandal

Somehow Sheba still continues to believe that Barbara is her ""friend"" and even goes to live with her after being kicked out of the house by her husband. Finally Sheba finds out Barbara's true intentions by reading her diary and all hell breaks loose before they part on bitter terms.As many have already noted, the acting is excellent. But what I like most about this film is Patrick Marber's script. It's full of literary references and subtle humor, intelligent and artistic without unnecessary pretension. The truth is that Barbara and Sheba are actually more alike than they first appear, two self-centered woman driven by loneliness and lust into a series of foolish decisions that create pain for others.

645775,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JP63,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 5]","A movie like Notes on a Scandal is basically a movie for people who like more actor-driven films. It stars 2 accomplished actresses and it has a pretty heavy premise but like many of these kind of films, once you've seen it the first time, it's hard to get into it the second. There's a lot to recommend here but at the same time you get the feeling you've watched one of those good films that almost escapes your brain a little a couple days later and upon seeing it again at the store, you go ""oh yeah, this one, I kinda liked this"".Sheba (Cate Blanchett) and Barbara (Judi Dench) are 2 schoolteachers in England; the former is a likable but sort of lost and unhappy wife to 2 kids while Barbara has the reputation of a brutally honest ice queen. The 2 strike a friendship at the strong insistence of Barbara who's lonely and just wants a friend. An intriguing opportunity happens as Sheba gets involved with a 15 year old student of hers and while aware the relationship is immoral, there's an emptyness that's being fulfilled that Sheba likes. Barbara decides to use this against Sheba and basically fight for Sheba and her to remain good friends but when friends don't see things they way you do, things can get rough, especially if Barbara's your friend.The acting is all-around excellent. Cate has always been consistent and here she kind of nails that feeling most people have of letting the few good emotions outweigh a bad situation and despite the immoral actions, it just feels right. But of course the big draw is Dench who usually is seen as that icy, harsh ogre of a woman (most popularly seen in the Brosnan/Craig Bond movies) and she's not above calling Sheba's son, suffering from Down syndrome, a ""court jester"". The other notable actor is Bill Nighy, well-known probably as Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels and despite one scene of slight overacting, complete with flying saliva, is quite good as the unknowing but loving husband.As for the film itself, the pacing's right, the acting is of course great but something feels slightly off about the film. There's almost a feeling that the film just ""is"": a film that doesn't really do anything new, say anything different, it's just handled well. Ever see a movie that probably got more praise and admiration than the film felt like it got? That's kind of what this film is in a way. It's like it knows it's meant to be a serious Oscar contender and that's what you get. At least the acting and the writing (that court jester remark is a great insult should one be inclined to use it) but other than that it's just a good film but not really an amazing film. The commentary is likewise. Director Richard Eyre has a persona like that of a college professor: knows his stuff but he cures insomnia.Should you watch Notes on a Scandal? Sure, there's quite a lot to recommend but whether it's purchasable is entirely up to you.

645777,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B00005JP63,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[5, 6]","So says Judi Dench's character at one point in this sometimes overcooked but thoroughly tasty psychological thriller, and it's kind of an overt ""meta"" moment in which she's also describing the film as well.  It also seems like a bit of a playful nod to this movie's cinematic sibling-of-sorts, ""Fatal Attraction.""  And while Dench is not quite the ""bunny boiler"" that Glenn Close so (in)famously was in that film, she comes darn close in a blistering performance of her own as a psycho-spinstress who weaves a web of delusional and devotional entanglement for the unwitting women who stumble into her lair.The film begins with Dench's character, Barbara Covett (as in ""thou shalt not"") sitting on a hillside bench overlooking Islington, an inner-city district of north London.  The angle of the camera and the view suggest that she's presiding over the city, contemptuously contemplating its denizens - all of whom she deems beneath her.  Her vantagepoint is also suggestive of a bird of prey, searching for its next victim.Then, when we hear her venomous voiceover, reading scathing appraisals and creepy suppositions from her compulsively-kept diary (a narrative device that works wonderfully throughout the film), we realize this is not merely a suggestion at all.  The words that gush from her poisonous pen are so acidic it's a wonder they don't burn right through the page.Later, when we first see her in the school in which she teaches, she is again looking down - this time at the students as they arrive for school.  ""Pubescent proles,"" she calls them, eerily invoking the Orwellian-invented term for the poor, uneducated and downtrodden.  Clearly this ain't no kindly old lady!Unfortunately (for her), new teacher Sheba Hart (skillfully and sympathetically played by Cate Blanchett) somehow does fall under the impression that Covett is indeed just that.  Later, when she falls under the spell of a 15 year old student, she reveals once and for all just how bad she is at reading people (with no access to their diaries or their internal monologs).Hart (as in ""don't go breakin' my"") is desperate to reconnect with something or someone after spending many years struggling to raise her two children (one with Down's Syndrome) and opens up way too quickly to the old bird - Dench's voiceover quite accurately refers to the naive Hart's ""immediate, incautious intimacy"" - laying herself bare for all kinds of manipulation.Meanwhile, freckly and cocksure student Steven Connolly (solidly played by newcomer Andrew Sullivan) lays her bare while referring to her as ""miss"" - driving home the disparity in their ages and also the lack of clarity in her judgment.  With his northern Irish accent, the boy also sounds like he's calling her ""mess"" (to my American ears, anyway), and he's not too far from the truth.And once that kettle's a-boiling, things heat up quickly from there.  Though it's completely over the top at times and in places (especially the very forwardly-mixed and unsubtle score by Phillip Glass), it's also very well done for what it is.  There are no great truths to be found here (at least none that I can find), but there is a swiftly-paced, tight and sometimes tawdry thriller.The performances are superb (one person who might be sadly overlooked is Bill Nighy as Sheba's older husband Richard, who gives a terrific performance that could get lost amidst the ma-dames and the melodrama), and the writing is delightful.  In fact, Dench's delicious voiceover at one point speaks of a ""marvelous intensity"" in her relationship with Blanchett, once again doing well to describe the film itself.",4,"""I Believe The Kettle's Boiled""",1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,3617,"['So', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'character', 'one', 'point', 'sometimes', 'overcooked', 'thoroughly', 'tasty', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'kind', 'overt', 'meta', 'moment', 'also', 'describing', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'bit', 'playful', 'nod', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'sibling-of-sorts', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Dench', 'not', 'quite', 'bunny', 'boiler', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'famously', 'was', 'film', 'darn', 'close', 'blistering', 'performance', 'own', 'psycho-spinstress', 'who', 'web', 'delusional', 'devotional', 'entanglement', 'unwitting', 'women', 'who', 'stumble', 'lair.The', 'film', 'Dench', 'character', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'thou', 'shalt', 'not', 'sitting', 'hillside', 'bench', 'overlooking', 'Islington', 'inner-city', 'district', 'north', 'London', 'angle', 'camera', 'view', 'suggest', 'presiding', 'city', 'contemptuously', 'contemplating', 'denizens', 'whom', 'vantagepoint', 'also', 'suggestive', 'bird', 'prey', 'searching', 'next', 'victim.Then', 'when', 'hear', 'venomous', 'voiceover', 'reading', 'scathing', 'appraisals', 'creepy', 'suppositions', 'compulsively-kept', 'diary', 'narrative', 'device', 'wonderfully', 'film', 'realize', 'not', 'merely', 'suggestion', 'words', 'gush', 'poisonous', 'pen', 'are', 'so', 'acidic', 'wonder', 'do', ""n't"", 'burn', 'right', 'page.Later', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'school', 'again', 'looking', 'down', 'time', 'students', 'arrive', 'school', 'Pubescent', 'proles', 'eerily', 'invoking', 'Orwellian-invented', 'term', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'downtrodden', 'Clearly', 'ai', ""n't"", 'no', 'kindly', 'old', 'lady', 'Unfortunately', 'new', 'teacher', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'skillfully', 'sympathetically', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'somehow', 'fall', 'impression', 'Covett', 'indeed', 'just', 'Later', 'when', 'spell', '15', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'once', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'reading', 'people', 'access', 'diaries', 'internal', 'monologs', '.Hart', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'breakin', 'desperate', 'reconnect', 'something', 'someone', 'spending', 'many', 'years', 'struggling', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'one', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'old', 'bird', 'Dench', 'voiceover', 'quite', 'accurately', 'refers', 'naive', 'Hart', 'immediate', 'incautious', 'intimacy', 'laying', 'bare', 'kinds', 'manipulation.Meanwhile', 'freckly', 'cocksure', 'student', 'Steven', 'Connolly', 'solidly', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Andrew', 'Sullivan', 'bare', 'referring', 'miss', 'driving', 'home', 'disparity', 'ages', 'also', 'lack', 'clarity', 'judgment', 'northern', 'Irish', 'accent', 'boy', 'also', 'calling', 'mess', 'American', 'ears', 'anyway', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'truth.And', 'once', 'kettle', 'a-boiling', 'things', 'heat', 'up', 'quickly', 'there', 'completely', 'top', 'times', 'places', 'especially', 'very', 'forwardly-mixed', 'unsubtle', 'score', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'what', 'are', 'great', 'truths', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'least', 'none', 'can', 'find', 'swiftly-paced', 'tight', 'sometimes', 'tawdry', 'thriller.The', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Sheba', 'older', 'husband', 'Richard', 'who', 'terrific', 'performance', 'could', 'get', 'lost', 'ma-dames', 'melodrama', 'writing', 'delightful', 'fact', 'Dench', 'delicious', 'voiceover', 'one', 'point', 'speaks', 'marvelous', 'intensity', 'relationship', 'Blanchett', 'once', 'again', 'doing', 'well', 'describe', 'film']",Notes on a Scandal

These two incredible leading ladies are well worth the price of rental or adding this to your dvd collection!!The amazingly talented Dame Jude Dench stars as Barbara, a spinster who teaches high school by day and retreats to her notebooks to record her bitter observances of co-workers, spending her lonely and friendless nights with her cat.  Enter the beautiful new art teacher, Sheba (equally wonderful Cate Blanchett), and the tension begins as Barbara starts to imagine a relationship with the married woman, who she eventually befriends.  However, once she catches Sheba having an affair with a fifteen year old student, Barbara decides to use the information as emotional blackmail, forcing Sheba into her deceitful arms in an attempt to push Sheba into a more intimate relationship.  With Sheba's marriage on rocky ground and her need for something outside the constant needs of her family, Barbara recognizes a woman on the verge and forms her own agenda to create a dependency on her by the object of her desire, Sheba.With plenty of twists and turns, this psychological thriller delivers on all levels.  Judi Dench is completely chilling as a love starved woman, desperate to find a partner to grow old with and determined to obtain that relationship by whatever means.  Cate Blanchett also gives a great performance as a young woman who is also lonely and makes the bad choice of giving in to an underage paramour.  Both women are broken and lonely and follow different paths; both paths leading to immoral life changing choices.If you are a fan of either of these ladies or love a good movie with great acting, then this is the film for you!

645785,AMS3ONV4S5FBI,B00005JP63,David Baime,"[0, 0]","Perhaps this movie deserves five stars.  Certainly the performances of the two main stars (particularly that of Judi Dench) were magnificent.  Still, there were a few places where I found myself being steered unintentionally down a wrong path.One thing I felt was a mistake was the sequence in which we are told of Sheba's affair with Steven.  This was done entirely through Sheba's flashback, in which the boy pursues Sheba with an aggression I found incompatible with a fifteen year old boy's level of maturity.  Consequently, I was unsure whether Sheba was slanting the story to reduce her own complicity in the crime.  If that were true, it would change the complexion of the crime and the complexity of her character and it would have driven the story in a different direction.  Eventually, I realized that we were to believe implicitly Sheba's flashback and then I understood where the story was going.  But for a short time, I was considering both storylines and I felt distracted by this.Toward the end of the film, there was a scene in which Sheba was made up in what seemed to me to be `drag', with heavy eye make up and comical lipstick.  At first, I didn't realize that it was Sheba.  I found by listening to the director's commentary that this was supposed to be Sheba reverting back to the carefree happy days of her youth that we had seen earlier in a photograph.  However, at the time I was unsure why she was made up like that and I felt it undermined the fierce emotions that were brilliantly depicted in the blow-up that ensued.Occurring immediately after this we found the two women in a quiet and touching scene in which they conclusively agreed to end their friendship/relationship.  The problem was that after the blow-up that previously occurred, I couldn't imagine that Sheba would have anything more to do with Barbara; certainly she never would have turned around and gone back into Barbara's home.  I was so taken aback by this non sequitur that at first I thought I must have missed something.I thought the movie should have ended sooner - when Barbara spotted her next victim on her favorite bench on Parliament Hill reading a newspaper article about Sheba and said, ""I knew her.""  A chill ran down my spine at this point, but was dispelled by the dialog that followed.  The bit with the milk on Annabelle's nose, reminiscent of a similar bit with Sheba, was cute but at best wholly unnecessary; the denouement had already been achieved quite effectively.I felt that other than these missteps, this movie was moving and powerful.

Add to this an older lesbian teacher played by Dench who fancies Blanchett's character. The sparks start to fly when Dench becomes aware of Blanchett's affair with a 15 year old pupil at the school and becomes confidente and manipulator of Blanchett to achieve her own ends. Blanchett is married to a much older man and has a handicapped child as well to add to the complexity.The screenplay to this film is stunning. It was written by Patrick Marber who is more well known for acting and co-writing the script of the Alan Partridge character on BBC television.Anyway, this film belongs to Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench. They are both wonderful actresses. Dench just shades it for her ability to convey sympathy in the audience for her character. We realise that loneliness is a terrible thing and that it is a human need to have companionship regardless of the extreme lengths that people will go to achieve it.I think the Battle Of The Brits for Best Actress at this years Oscars was an unfair contest.

I'll never understand why the adult blatantly crossed the line but sadly this scenario continues.And whether an office acquaintance stops speaking because you spoke to their adversary or you appeared to stray from the usual lunch crowd and have the nerve to lunch with someone new, I could certainly identify with the manipulation element of this film enough to give me the creeps.Aspects from these scenarios are some of the topics in ""Notes on a Scandal"", a psychological drama.Judi Dench's character (Barbara Covett) is a single, aging, lonely, manipulative and controlling veteran school teacher who apparently doesn't believe in her own self-worth to befriend another in the normal way but uses sensitive information to control and reign in a friend.Cate Blanchett's character (Sheba Hart) is a married, artsy, attractive newly hired art teacher with a house full of people and rarely alone but still lonely and needy.Barbara's hatred and superiority to others is palpable.  But her constant condemnation of everyone doesn't cease her abhorrence of being lonely and alone.Sheba's carefree, first day to school, I don't know what I'm doing here attitude creates a vulnerability that some colleagues find attractive in addition to her good looks.These qualities are initially what interests Barbara although she inwardly thinks of Sheba as a passive dizzy individual.The women become friends sort of.  They both seem to have different agendas associated with there friendship.  And it becomes more and more volatile to the films end.Judi Dench gives a riveting performance as a hateful, exploitive and calculating woman who rates a friends problems by how much she can gain from them.She's truly scary and will stop at nothing in demanding more and more of Sheba's time like a stalker.Cate Blanchett is also commendable in portraying the seemingly weak minded, pitifully lonely wife who has everything but can't see it.  She makes the mistake of her life, claims she's trying to correct it only to be more in demand by Barbara.I suppose depending on our experiences in life we may dismiss this film as being morally beneath our standards, or we may look past the ethical issues and see the deeper problemsof the two lonely and pathetic characters.

645790,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JP63,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 3]","I watched this transfixed.  I've never had any doubt about the acting ability of Judi Dench, or Cate Blanchett for that matter.  They are both at the very top of their profession.  But their work here just blew me away.However it was not just their superlative acting that carried this film well beyond anything one might expect.  It was the superb direction by Richard Eyre who spun out a riveting and emotionally moving experience from something that could have been ordinary: An unfulfilled wife of an older man is seduced by one of her 15-year-old students--or, properly speaking, we should say that she allowed herself to be seduced by one of her students.  If it ever comes out, it will be a scandal to be sure since not only is she a teacher but she is a wife and mother.  But the boy (Andrew Simpson) is mature for his age and rather clever and very persistent.  And so she gives in and finds that she likes it very much, very much indeed.Such banality, really, this might be.  But all along this tale is being narrated by another teacher, a woman in her sixties, an old battle ax, as she calls herself.  Judi Dench as Barbara Covett, spinster.  Like the others she is interested in this new art teacher (Cate Blanchett as Sheba Hart), who is deeper than anyone realizes.  From a distance Barbara watches her and takes notes for her diary.  She is sharp and candid in her expression with a Shakespearean eye for the foibles of the people around her, whom she watches with consummate cynicism.We are surprised at what happens next.  There is a row in Sheba's classroom.  Barbara appears and stills the row, and puts the boys in their place.  One of the boys is THE boy.  But we don't know that yet.  Neither does Barbara.  Now Sheba is thankful and now a friendship may develop between the mentor teacher, Barbara, and the ingenue, Sheba.  And something to that effect is written in Barbara's diary, and it is here that we realize that she too has eyes for the new teacher.And now comes the revelation of the affair between the boy and the woman, and it is Barbara who by chance spies them.  Now the interesting dynamics of the personalities of the two women begin to show themselves.  Barbara immediately calls Sheba upon the carpet, so to speak, and dresses her down.  How dare you!  I mean he is 15-years-old!  Etc.  Sheba who needs a confessor tells all, and begs Barbara to keep it a secret until after Christmas for the sake of her family.  And now we find out that of course Barbara is certainly going to keep it a secret.  This is in fact a wonderful development because now Sheba will be indebted to her.  I will not tell, she says.  Instead I will help you.  But you must end it now.  Yes, yes, thank you, thank you, Sheba says.  And she does mean to end it, but...well the boy is persistent and she wants him.The next development is very interesting, but I am afraid that I may have revealed too much already...The denouement and then the finish are just so very well spun out.  The scenes and the revelations come flying out in lickety split fashion, and everything is just so dramatically perfect.  I have to hand it to not only the director but the writers--Zoe Heller, who wrote the novel, and Patrick Marber, who wrote the screenplay.  The story, the splendid characterizations, and the sharp dialogue enthrall us.  How delectable it must of been for Judi Dench to pronounce some of the lines.  One is reminded of Nabokov's first person narrator in Lolita in the way that Barbara reveals her flawed and ultimately pathetic character through her own words.  This is one of those scripts that make scriptwriters say spontaneously, ""I could never, but never, have written it as well.""  Everything is set up so perfectly, and it comes spinning out in a most delicious way.  Well, delicious for the audience.  Not so for the protagonists.Judi Dench has never been better and Cate Blanchett is as good as she was in Elizabeth (1998), which is very good indeed.",5,Enthralling clash of hidden desires,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,3977,"['watched', 'transfixed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'doubt', 'acting', 'ability', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'matter', 'are', 'very', 'top', 'profession', 'work', 'here', 'just', 'blew', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'superlative', 'acting', 'carried', 'film', 'well', 'anything', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'was', 'superb', 'direction', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'who', 'spun', 'out', 'riveting', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'experience', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ordinary', 'unfulfilled', 'wife', 'older', 'man', 'seduced', 'one', '15-year-old', 'students', 'properly', 'speaking', 'should', 'say', 'allowed', 'be', 'seduced', 'one', 'students', 'ever', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'scandal', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'only', 'teacher', 'wife', 'mother', 'boy', 'Andrew', 'Simpson', 'mature', 'age', 'rather', 'clever', 'very', 'persistent', 'so', 'finds', 'very', 'much', 'very', 'much', 'indeed.Such', 'banality', 'really', 'might', 'be', 'tale', 'being', 'narrated', 'teacher', 'woman', 'sixties', 'old', 'battle', 'ax', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'spinster', 'others', 'interested', 'new', 'art', 'teacher', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'who', 'deeper', 'anyone', 'realizes', 'distance', 'Barbara', 'notes', 'diary', 'sharp', 'candid', 'expression', 'Shakespearean', 'eye', 'foibles', 'people', 'whom', 'consummate', 'cynicism.We', 'are', 'surprised', 'what', 'next', 'row', 'Sheba', 'classroom', 'Barbara', 'row', 'boys', 'place', 'One', 'boys', 'boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'Barbara', 'Now', 'Sheba', 'thankful', 'now', 'friendship', 'may', 'develop', 'mentor', 'teacher', 'Barbara', 'ingenue', 'Sheba', 'something', 'effect', 'written', 'Barbara', 'diary', 'here', 'realize', 'too', 'eyes', 'new', 'teacher.And', 'now', 'revelation', 'affair', 'boy', 'woman', 'Barbara', 'who', 'chance', 'spies', 'Now', 'interesting', 'dynamics', 'personalities', 'two', 'women', 'begin', 'show', 'Barbara', 'immediately', 'Sheba', 'carpet', 'so', 'speak', 'down', 'How', 'dare', 'mean', '15-years-old', 'Etc', 'Sheba', 'who', 'confessor', 'Barbara', 'keep', 'secret', 'Christmas', 'sake', 'family', 'now', 'find', 'out', 'course', 'Barbara', 'certainly', 'going', 'keep', 'secret', 'fact', 'wonderful', 'development', 'now', 'Sheba', 'will', 'be', 'indebted', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'Instead', 'will', 'help', 'must', 'end', 'now', 'Yes', 'yes', 'thank', 'thank', 'Sheba', 'mean', 'end', 'well', 'boy', 'persistent', 'him.The', 'next', 'development', 'very', 'interesting', 'am', 'afraid', 'may', 'have', 'revealed', 'too', 'much', 'already', 'denouement', 'then', 'finish', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'spun', 'out', 'scenes', 'revelations', 'come', 'flying', 'out', 'lickety', 'split', 'fashion', 'everything', 'just', 'so', 'dramatically', 'perfect', 'have', 'hand', 'not', 'only', 'director', 'writers', 'Zoe', 'Heller', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'story', 'splendid', 'characterizations', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'How', 'delectable', 'must', 'been', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'pronounce', 'lines', 'One', 'reminded', 'Nabokov', 'first', 'person', 'narrator', 'Lolita', 'way', 'Barbara', 'flawed', 'ultimately', 'pathetic', 'character', 'own', 'words', 'one', 'scripts', 'make', 'scriptwriters', 'say', 'spontaneously', 'could', 'never', 'never', 'have', 'written', 'as', 'well', 'Everything', 'set', 'up', 'so', 'perfectly', 'spinning', 'out', 'most', 'delicious', 'way', 'Well', 'delicious', 'audience', 'Not', 'so', 'protagonists.Judi', 'Dench', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'Elizabeth', '1998', 'very', 'good', 'indeed']",Notes on a Scandal

Not because of her performance, because there wasn't anything bad about it--at all. I feel badly because Notes on a Scandal came out the same year as The Queen. Neither are up for best Picture, but both have best Actress heavyweights. (To see my review on The Queen, scroll down.) This one is all about Dench. She's such an elegant, talented woman that she can mesh herself into any role from Proulx's ancient matriarch to the Queen of the free world to a lesbian psycho-spinster who lives vicariously through younger, beautiful, successful women. Barbara Covett (Dench) is the history department chair at a British school whose former art teacher has left for reasons unknown when the movie begins. Cate Blanchett dances into the role of the new art teacher with aplomb and blonde hair that glistens like a beacon in a dreary school yard where she becomes the focus of a 15-year-old paramour. A paramour who Blanchett permits to seduce her, since she's in a drole life as Bill Nighy's younger wife whose children are a young boy with Down Syndrome and a teenage girl the same age as her lover.Notes on a Scandal is just that. A refreshingly original plot narrated in voice over by Dench who interprets the actions of the film in her off-kiltered, soul-searching way. She inhibits every scene seamlessly weaving intrigue, lust, envy, and blackmail into a tail that comes down to lost love, obsession, and pure loneliness. Blanchett shines as Sheba who struggles against herself, but she fails to convince me of how bad her life really is. She has inherited a lovely old row house outside of London, her writer husband adores her, her daughter seems as dysfunctional as the rest of us, and her son is the love of her life. What more can she want? I suppose Dench just wants to replace her former obsession with a new one, and cares more about her cat than the people around her.I will continue to see Blanchett movies, but Hudson needs to prove herself to me.The cyclic ending to Notes on a Scandal is bittersweet, pleasing to the palette while still keeping true to the travesties of life. The movie is exactly what I thought it would be. A wonderfully delicious romp somewhere in the bowels of clandestine subterfuge between two talented, deserving Oscar nominated actresses.",4,"Pretty cool film, if you like that kind of stuff",1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2305,"['feel', 'badly', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Not', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'bad', 'feel', 'badly', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'Queen', 'are', 'up', 'best', 'Picture', 'have', 'best', 'Actress', 'heavyweights', 'see', 'review', 'Queen', 'scroll', 'down', 'one', 'Dench', 'such', 'elegant', 'talented', 'woman', 'can', 'mesh', 'role', 'Proulx', 'ancient', 'matriarch', 'Queen', 'free', 'world', 'lesbian', 'psycho-spinster', 'who', 'vicariously', 'younger', 'beautiful', 'successful', 'women', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'Dench', 'history', 'department', 'chair', 'British', 'school', 'former', 'art', 'teacher', 'left', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'when', 'movie', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'role', 'new', 'art', 'teacher', 'aplomb', 'blonde', 'hair', 'beacon', 'dreary', 'school', 'yard', 'where', 'focus', '15-year-old', 'paramour', 'paramour', 'who', 'Blanchett', 'seduce', 'drole', 'life', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'younger', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'young', 'boy', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'teenage', 'girl', 'same', 'age', 'lover.Notes', 'Scandal', 'just', 'refreshingly', 'original', 'plot', 'narrated', 'voice', 'Dench', 'who', 'actions', 'film', 'off-kiltered', 'soul-searching', 'way', 'scene', 'seamlessly', 'weaving', 'intrigue', 'lust', 'envy', 'blackmail', 'tail', 'down', 'lost', 'love', 'obsession', 'pure', 'loneliness', 'Blanchett', 'shines', 'Sheba', 'who', 'convince', 'how', 'bad', 'life', 'really', 'inherited', 'lovely', 'old', 'row', 'house', 'London', 'writer', 'husband', 'daughter', 'as', 'dysfunctional', 'rest', 'son', 'love', 'life', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'want', 'suppose', 'Dench', 'just', 'replace', 'former', 'obsession', 'new', 'one', 'more', 'cat', 'people', 'her.I', 'will', 'continue', 'see', 'Blanchett', 'movies', 'Hudson', 'prove', 'me.The', 'cyclic', 'ending', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'bittersweet', 'pleasing', 'palette', 'still', 'keeping', 'true', 'travesties', 'life', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'delicious', 'romp', 'somewhere', 'bowels', 'clandestine', 'subterfuge', 'two', 'talented', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'actresses']",Notes on a Scandal
645793,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B00005JP63,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[2, 2]","The ""Notes"" refer to diary  logs made by Barbara, (Dame Judi Dench), a bitter, lonely, often malignant history teacher. She writes caustic, extremely judgemental comments about everybody. She seems to despise her colleagues and her students--and they don't seem to have any love for her. The viewer might not realize this at first, but Barbra's bitterness is really her own self-hatred turned outward; a tragic reaction to her own unbearable lonliness. When Barbara meets the new, young art teacher Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett), she is annoyed by her, of course. But soon, Barbara becomes obsessed with Sheba. Later, she becomes Sheba's dangerously delusional stalker.For her part, Sheba is no saint, either.  37 year old Sheba indulges in a reckless affair with a 15 year old student, impressively portrayed by Andrew Simmons; despite the fact that she has a good, comfortable life with her husband and children. In a DVD featurette, Blancett says she views ""Notes"" as ""portraits of lonliness,"" and says of her character Sheba, ""When people are that cut off from themselves, they create circumstances where they will be caught."" Barbara discovers the affair; but rather than ""tell"" on Sheba, she decides to keep her ""secret""; seeing this as the perfect ""opportunity"" to keep Sheba in her ""debt"" forever. In Barbara's mind, their ""secret"" will bond and bind them together and eventually she and Sheba will embark on a ""life together."" Sheba  trusts Barbara at first, making the mistake of ""immediate, incautious intimacy.""On several levels, ""Notes"" plays like ""Fatal Attraction"" with a lesbian twist. It's quite obvious to the viewer that Barbara, in addition to being bitter and unbearably lonely, is  also an unfullfilled lesbian, although psychologically/emotionally, she would never identify herself as such. We later learn that Barbara was previously obsessed with Jennifer Dodd, another young teacher who filed a restraining order against her and left the school, presumably on the verge of a nervous breakdown.Family obligations prevent Sheba from helping Barbara in a crisis. Viewing this as a betrayal she will not tolerate, Barbara finally lets the ""secret"" out and all hell breaks loose, The film's final act is a series of emotional and often violent confrontations. In the smaller but important role of Sheba's husband Richard, Bill Nighy is outstanding in the scene where he explodes with rage over Sheba's affair. Barbara watches this scene from the top of a staircase, a small smile of satisfaction flashing briefly across her face. However, Barbara does not get off scot-free. She is forced to retire one year early. And, in the film's most memorable scene, Sheba discovers Barbara's diary, and Barbara's lengthy, calculated role in her undoing, and she lets Barbara HAVE IT, BUT GOOD, in a NO HOLDS BARRED  confrontation!With so much dramatic fireworks, it is somewhat surprising that director Richard Eyre offers such a lifeless and technical DVD commentary. He is, quite correctly, enamoured with his two leading ladies; both of whom give virtuoso performances. Cate Blancett is excellent. Dame Judi Dench is riveiting and phenominal.

And it's no different with new teacher colleague, Sheba Hart, played by Blancett. There begins Barbra's intense feelings toward Sheba until she discovers Sheba's infidelity towards her husband by having an affair with a 15-year-old teenage student. Dench's character then works to keep the friendship with Sheba by emotionally blackmailing her. Dench's performance is every bit riveting and powerful as her expressions fully convey her strong will to make Sheba hers by going all the way out. Barbra must be the one of the most repulsive lesbian stalker on screen.Cate Blancett is very competent as the weak-willed Sheba who gets herself into a dilemma that threatens to destroy both her career and family. While she juggles to keep her secret, prevent her family from falling apart and placating the elderly Barbra, her character finds no place to head to except to relent to Barbra's demands.While the film contains not even an onscreen kiss between the both, the scene where Barbra tries to seduce the helpless Sheba by feeling down her hands is enough to invoke lust and sensuality.This is truly a masterful film with solid acting performances.

BROWN), it's nice to see her playing a thoroughly unsavory person in her best role as a villain since MACBETH on television in the mid-Seventies.  She plays an experienced teacher at an Islington school who befriends married art teacher Sheba (Cate Blanchett) and ostensibly tries to help Sheba through difficult times, as the younger woman embarks on an affair with student Steven (Tom Georgeson).  However it transpires that Barbara's motives are very different, as she turns out to be an obsessive, concerned solely with herself and blaming others if they should reject her.  Her narcissism is revealed in two ways - through her incessant writing down of her thoughts in diaries, and in her attempts to woo the viewers' favor through voice-over narration.  Neither strategy actually succeeds, but Barbara still manages to emerge from her friendship with Sheba unscathed, which is more than can be said for Sheba herself, who has to try and pick up the pieces of her marriage to Richard (Bill Nighy) and re-establish her relationship with daughter Polly (Juno Temple).  Shot in drab colors by director Richard Eyre, NOTES ON A SCANDAL shows how a fundamentally lonely person tries her best to compensate for a drab lifestyle, yet only succeeds in destroying others.  We would like to feel sympathetic towards her - it is Dench, after all - but she is so vindictive in her attitudes that she disqualifies herself immediately.  Dench is particularly good at registering anger through a single expression - a pursing of the lips, a flash of the eyes.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[2, 3]","Dame Judi Dench seamlessly inhabits the role of Barbara Covett, a pathologically needy high school history teacher in ""Notes on a Scandal,"" based on the brilliant psychological novel by Zoe Heller.  A new faculty member has come to St. George's School:  thirty-seven year old Sheba Hart, an insecure art instructor who fails to control her unruly students.  Barbara conveniently steps in to rescue Sheba, and quickly becomes her mentor and confidante.  Little does Sheba know that Barbara longs for a relationship far deeper than mere friendship.Sheba gives Barbara the opening that she has longed for when the art teacher impulsively takes one of her students as her lover.  Only Barbara knows about the affair, and she urges Sheba to break off with the boy while swearing that she will keep Sheba's secret.  For reasons that are hinted at but never fully explained, Sheba seems bent on self-destruction.  She feels compelled to risk everything:  her marriage to Richard, the happiness of her two children, her career, and even her freedom, for a few stolen hours with a passably good looking fifteen-year-old boy.Cate Blanchett is both gorgeous and vulnerable as the self-destructive Sheba.  Bill Nighy is effective as Sheba's caring but clueless husband.  Andrew Simpson is a bit too callow as Steven Connolly, the young man whom Sheba finds so irresistible.  However, the movie belongs to Judi Dench, much as ""The Queen"" belongs to Helen Mirren.  Dench is incapable of striking a false note.  She captures Barbara's bitter loneliness, her inability to relate to others openly and honestly, and her need to possess the one she loves.  Dench delivers her lines flawlessly, with biting sarcasm, dry wit, and aching poignancy, but she also speaks volumes with her eyes, mouth, and posture.  When she listlessly languishes in the bathtub while smoking a cigarette, she resentfully thinks that Sheba could never understand the emotional pain that Barbara experiences every day of her life.  With only a dying cat for company and a job she loathes, Barbara's entire existence is devoid of meaning.Although the film does not completely adhere to the novel's storyline, ""Notes on a Scandal"" captures the spirit of Heller's work.  Richard Eyre explores the lack of communication between the characters, the class differences that helps fuel the animosity between Barbara and Sheba, and the subconscious needs that drive people to wreak havoc with their own and other people's lives.",4,"""We are bound by the secrets we share.""",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2476,"['Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'seamlessly', 'role', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'pathologically', 'needy', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'teacher', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'based', 'brilliant', 'psychological', 'novel', 'Zoe', 'Heller', 'new', 'faculty', 'member', 'come', 'St.', 'George', 'School', 'thirty-seven', 'year', 'old', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'insecure', 'art', 'instructor', 'who', 'control', 'unruly', 'students', 'Barbara', 'conveniently', 'rescue', 'Sheba', 'quickly', 'mentor', 'confidante', 'Little', 'Sheba', 'know', 'Barbara', 'longs', 'relationship', 'far', 'deeper', 'mere', 'friendship.Sheba', 'Barbara', 'opening', 'longed', 'when', 'art', 'teacher', 'impulsively', 'one', 'students', 'lover', 'Only', 'Barbara', 'affair', 'Sheba', 'break', 'off', 'boy', 'swearing', 'will', 'keep', 'Sheba', 'secret', 'reasons', 'are', 'hinted', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'Sheba', 'bent', 'self-destruction', 'compelled', 'risk', 'everything', 'marriage', 'Richard', 'happiness', 'two', 'children', 'career', 'even', 'freedom', 'few', 'stolen', 'hours', 'passably', 'good', 'looking', 'fifteen-year-old', 'boy.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'gorgeous', 'vulnerable', 'self-destructive', 'Sheba', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'effective', 'Sheba', 'caring', 'clueless', 'husband', 'Andrew', 'Simpson', 'bit', 'too', 'callow', 'Steven', 'Connolly', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'Sheba', 'so', 'irresistible', 'However', 'movie', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'much', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Dench', 'incapable', 'striking', 'false', 'note', 'Barbara', 'bitter', 'loneliness', 'inability', 'relate', 'others', 'openly', 'honestly', 'need', 'possess', 'one', 'Dench', 'delivers', 'lines', 'flawlessly', 'biting', 'sarcasm', 'dry', 'wit', 'aching', 'poignancy', 'also', 'volumes', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'posture', 'When', 'listlessly', 'bathtub', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'resentfully', 'Sheba', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'emotional', 'pain', 'Barbara', 'experiences', 'day', 'life', 'only', 'dying', 'cat', 'company', 'job', 'Barbara', 'entire', 'existence', 'devoid', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'adhere', 'novel', 'storyline', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'spirit', 'Heller', 'work', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'lack', 'communication', 'characters', 'class', 'differences', 'fuel', 'animosity', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'subconscious', 'needs', 'drive', 'people', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'own', 'other', 'people', 'lives']",Notes on a Scandal
645803,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JP63,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","There is genuine joy in watching two masterful actresses invest themselves so fully into complex roles of uncommon depth, and Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett do not disappoint as predator and prey in this juicy, emotionally resonant mix of melodrama and black comedy based on a 2003 novel by Zoe Heller. Directed with surprising relish by Richard Eyre and written by Patrick Marber with the same misogynistic vitriol he displayed in 2004's ""Closer"", the 2006 movie initially feels like a throwback to the austere, low-key British social dramas of the 1960's but quickly evolves into something far more vital as the story twists and turns.It begins with Barbara Covett, an aptly named spinster schoolteacher whose stern, intimidating behavior in the classroom hides a pathologically lonely woman at home. Her only outlets are her aging cat and a meticulously maintained series of daily journals in which she freely expresses her bitter resentments with an acidic pen. Enter Sheba Hart, the new art teacher at Barbara's school. On one hand, Sheba is a young and beautiful free spirit, happily married to an older man, and the mother of two children, one with Down's syndrome. On the other, she has a yearning insecurity and a complicated psyche, which draws her not only to Barbara for emotional support but into an illicit affair with Steven Connolly, a fifteen-year old student. When Barbara finds out about the relationship, a spiraling game of emotional blackmail erupts into consequences neither woman expects. For its serious overtones, the film displays a devilish sense of humor when it comes to all the cat-and-mouse games, especially as Barbara recites the passages from her journals with piercing wit and devastating candor. It does flail a bit in the last third with a heavy emphasis on the melodrama, but the unabated anticipation of a showdown between Barbara and Sheba makes the gaps more than tolerable.Dench's formidable manner has never been put to better use than in the small, precise ways she defines Barbara's nasty, needy character. It's gratifying to see her take charge of such an unsympathetic role without resorting to unnecessary scenery chewing. Blanchett has the comparatively tougher role as Sheba since we view her mainly from Barbara's singular perspective, but she proves once again to be one of the screen's most vital actresses. She makes Sheba's messiness palpable and more importantly, her attraction to Steven understandable and pitiable. Even with two such dynamos, Bill Nighy manages to hold his own with escalating fury as Sheba's rightfully confused husband Richard, while solid work is provided by Andrew Simpson as the precocious Steven and Phil Davis as a smitten schoolteacher.

I read the book a few years ago, yet a lot of it has stayed with me.  ""Notes..."" is a story of adultery, manipulation, and desperation.  While desperation is not usually all that appealing, on both Cate Blanchette(as adulterous Sheba Hart) and Barbara Covet(A mentally ill Judi Dench) it looks amazingly good.  I personally like both of these actresses, and after reading the book and seeing that they were playing the 2 most important roles in the story, I felt compelled to rush out and see this film.Sheba is the artfully dissheveled new Art teacher at an English school, and Barbara is the old maid history teacher.  Barbara helps her in a pinch when a few students give Sheba a hard time in class and after the rift, the two instructors become fast friends.  Both lonely and sort of desperate for affection, they are similar. Once Barbara finds out about an affair between Sheba and her pupil, Steven Connolly, she uses it to become closer to Sheba instead of turning her and the student in.  It's quite a web that Barbara weaves, and Sheba is like a fly in it.  While the story could be a bit much for some people, especially if you have a 15 yr. old son, it's so amazing to watch these actresses.  They are both perfect in these roles and I had chills watching them and the film progress.  It's high drama and will literally have you gripping the arm of chair in some parts. It's Chilling, and Dench makes this movie that much more interesting as she truly becomes the character.  You really believe she is truly psychotic.I recommend this movie to those who appreciate the works of the actresses as they are in top form here.  A mezmerizing story and two of the best actresses of all time, what more do you really need at the movies aside from maybe popcorn, candy, and soda?",5,Astounding!!! Amazing!!!

645806,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B00005JP63,elena maria vidal,"[4, 5]","My husband brought the DVD home with the warning that ""Notes on a Scandal"" was supposed to be an intense and disturbing film. Disturbing it was indeed, but not in the way I thought it would be. I assumed that a plot involving a teacher's ""affair"" with a teenage pupil would be overwhelmed by the unsavory aspect of that dangerous liaison. While events do turn upon the sordid, ill-fated dalliance, it is shown to be the unappealing result of mental aberration on the part of Cate Blanchett's character ""Sheba."" Sheba is drawn into the affair because she is basically undisciplined and used to living a free life, although she has tried to be a devoted mother to the best of her ability. But when boredom and unhappiness overwhelm her, she is bereft of resources.The other dangerous relationship in the film is the emotional obsession that an older teacher, Babara Covett, magnificently played by Judi Dench, develops over Sheba. It reminded me of a saying of St Francis de Sales: ""There are many virgins in hell, but there are no humble people in hell."" With all the overemphasis on the physical, we forget that there are other sins besides those of the flesh, and that pride and covetousness can also lead a soul down the primrose path. Barbara's determination to monopolize Sheba's affections is in many ways as insidious and dangerous as any carnal misbehavior.Barbara (Dench) is a dedicated teacher who with one word can restore order in a classroom. Her amazing competence and intellectual superiority lead her to despise the world. She is a misanthrope worthy of Scrooge, yet the witty and brilliant reflections as recorded in her secret diary are chillingly amusing. Unfortunately, she has a habit of forming inordinate attachments to other, younger women, attachments which she erroneously idealizes as being spiritual friendships. True friendship has little to do with it, however. Barbara resents Sheba's family and when Sheba puts her children first, only then does Barbara report Sheba's criminal actions.""Notes on a Scandal"" is a revealing glimpse into the souls of two women, each narcissistic and possessed by different brands of lust.

645812,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005JP63,Galina,"[1, 1]","Judging by its plot ouline, the movie may and does sound like something that comes directly from the tabloids, belongs to a TV of the week and should stay on the lifetime channel (it is a fun channel, though). My true belief is that there is no low subject for art - any topic however controversial, unpleasant, or sensational can be transformed in a work of Art. ""Notes on a Scandal"" is a perfect example. It is a work of art and what elevates it from the myriads of inferior movies on the subject is the fact that it is based on a brilliant screenplay that devilishly clever mixes two stories of forbidden longings and desires and has two best modern actresses to work with it. I thought that I knew what Cate Blanchett and Judy Dench were capable of - I am happy to admit that I was wrong. I could not literally take my eyes off them. They work together in such harmony and perfect understanding that the movie should be studied in schools as the master class of acting, especially considering that both actresses played against their types, against everything I've seen them before.Funny, both Dench and Blanchett played Elizabeth I, the wise monarch the lonely woman, in the same year and both were nominated for the Oscar with Dench taking the award. If she was awarded for 10 minutes of screening time then, she must be awarded now for the incredible finesse, bravery, and depth of her performance. Her Barbara seems more than unlikable person, vindictive, intriguing but there is so much more to her, there is eternal pain, the silence of loneliness that screams from the screen and touches you against your will.I've been a huge fan of Cate Blanchett since I saw her even before ""Elizabeth"", in a rarely mentioned and little seen Gillian Armstrong's film ""Oscar and Lucinda"" (1997). In her early performance she proved to be a natural and talented actress and because of it, she was offered the title role in Elizabeth - the rest is history. I think of Blanchett not only as one of the (or even THE) most talented actresses of her generation but as the most beautiful woman I've seen. One of my friends said several years ago, ""whoever created Cate Blanchett's face, knew what true beauty was"". Her beauty is timeless, rare, and meaningful. Watching her face brings the feelings that seem not to exist anymore in this world. Hers is the face of Botticelli's Flora - even hundreds years ago, the face like hers would inspire the most talented Artists to create their masterpieces. In ""Notes on a Scandal"", with her cool and sophisticated beauty, Blanchett plays Sheba, the young free-spirited high-school Art teacher, the embodiment of sensuality and sexual desire so strong that no man or woman can or will resist. The most memorable Blanchett' scene though is the one where she faces the press crowd with the rage of such power that gives her performance and her character new, unknown, and terrifying depth.Judy Dench and Cate Blanchett are two priceless assets of the movie but not the only ones. Bill Nighy gave a great performance as Sheba's husband. Phillip Glass wrote a very appropriate music score, and Richard Eyre directed the brave, dark, complicated, and powerful movie.4.5/5",4,Notes on a Masterwork,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,3197,"['Judging', 'plot', 'ouline', 'movie', 'may', 'sound', 'something', 'directly', 'tabloids', 'TV', 'week', 'should', 'stay', 'lifetime', 'channel', 'fun', 'channel', 'though', 'true', 'belief', 'low', 'subject', 'art', 'topic', 'however', 'controversial', 'unpleasant', 'sensational', 'can', 'be', 'transformed', 'work', 'Art', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'perfect', 'example', 'work', 'art', 'what', 'myriads', 'inferior', 'movies', 'subject', 'fact', 'based', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'devilishly', 'clever', 'mixes', 'two', 'stories', 'forbidden', 'longings', 'desires', 'two', 'best', 'modern', 'actresses', 'work', 'thought', 'knew', 'what', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'were', 'capable', 'am', 'happy', 'admit', 'was', 'wrong', 'could', 'not', 'literally', 'take', 'eyes', 'work', 'together', 'such', 'harmony', 'perfect', 'understanding', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'schools', 'master', 'class', 'acting', 'especially', 'considering', 'actresses', 'played', 'types', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Funny', 'Dench', 'Blanchett', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'wise', 'lonely', 'woman', 'same', 'year', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Dench', 'taking', 'award', 'was', 'awarded', '10', 'minutes', 'screening', 'time', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'awarded', 'now', 'incredible', 'finesse', 'bravery', 'depth', 'performance', 'Barbara', 'more', 'unlikable', 'person', 'vindictive', 'intriguing', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'eternal', 'pain', 'silence', 'loneliness', 'screen', 'touches', 'will.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'saw', 'even', 'Elizabeth', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'little', 'seen', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'film', 'Oscar', 'Lucinda', '1997', 'early', 'performance', 'proved', 'be', 'natural', 'talented', 'actress', 'was', 'offered', 'title', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'rest', 'history', 'think', 'Blanchett', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'even', 'most', 'talented', 'actresses', 'generation', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'One', 'friends', 'said', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'whoever', 'created', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'face', 'knew', 'what', 'true', 'beauty', 'was', 'beauty', 'timeless', 'rare', 'meaningful', 'Watching', 'face', 'feelings', 'seem', 'not', 'exist', 'anymore', 'world', 'Hers', 'face', 'Botticelli', 'Flora', 'even', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ago', 'face', 'hers', 'would', 'inspire', 'most', 'talented', 'Artists', 'create', 'masterpieces', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'cool', 'sophisticated', 'beauty', 'Blanchett', 'Sheba', 'young', 'free-spirited', 'high-school', 'Art', 'teacher', 'embodiment', 'sensuality', 'sexual', 'desire', 'so', 'strong', 'man', 'woman', 'can', 'will', 'resist', 'most', 'memorable', 'Blanchett', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'press', 'crowd', 'rage', 'such', 'power', 'performance', 'character', 'new', 'unknown', 'terrifying', 'depth.Judy', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'two', 'priceless', 'assets', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'Sheba', 'husband', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'wrote', 'very', 'appropriate', 'music', 'score', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'directed', 'brave', 'dark', 'complicated', 'powerful', 'movie.4.5/5']",Notes on a Scandal

It is a success on every level - story, direction, cinematography, and especially acting.Barbara Covett (Dench) is a fierce disciplinarian in a school populated by children who are more interested in drugs and misbehavior than in learning. She has no life except with her aging cat Portia, spending her lonely hours away from the classroom making entries into a journal.  Into this icy atmosphere comes a new art teacher, the luminously beautiful free-spirited Sheba (very significantly short for Bathsheba!) Hart (Cate Blanchett).  Barbara notices Sheba's presence at first with critical disdain then with fascination: Sheba is new to teaching, having 'wasted' her life as a potential artist by marrying too early her senior teacher  Richard (Bill Nighy) and mothering two children, teenage Polly (Juno Temple) and Down's Syndrome Ben (Max Lewis), and now wanting to make something interesting of her life.  Sheba enters into an affair with 15-year-old Steven Connolly (Andrew Simpson), a lad who wins her attention first through sympathy ploy for his 'bad home life' and eventually conquers her better judgment by paying physical attention and gratification to her.  Barbara secretly observes the couple en flagrant and lets her new friend know of her discovery of an act that is criminal.The manner in which Barbara gains Sheba's attention by keeping Sheba's explosively dangerous behavior a shared secret leads to a fulfillment of Barbara's wish to not spend her life alone: she is in love with Sheba and will stop at nothing to have Sheba to herself.  But when Sheba is unable to stop her sensual dalliance with Steven, Barbara begins a course of events that leads to destruction of all kinds. The journal entries tell it all in scrupulous detail.The entire cast is superb, much to the credit of director Richard Eyre (Stage Beauty, Iris, The Ploughman's Lunch, and multiple television adaptations of classics).  His sense of pacing the action is overwhelmingly fine. For this viewer the musical score by the gifted Philip Glass is successful in maintaining tension, but is far more mundane than his other scores and composing - and the music drowns the dialog far too often.  But this is a minor flaw when compared to the intelligent, sensitive, subtle, completely credible performances by both Dench and Blanchett. They are the epitome of fine actors and watching them work is an awe-inspiring pleasure.  The film deals with difficult subject matter but succeeds in steering clear of sensationalism to present the sad inner lives of two disparate yet similar women. Highly Recommended.

645818,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B00005JP63,"Greg C. Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[1, 1]","Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench give the best performances of their respective careers (the subject matter is teacher/student sexual relationship) portraying these complex characters. These roles must have been difficult for Blanchett and Dench--in essence they were both sexual predators. Today, there is an ongoing crisis involving female teachers who are being accused, or convicted, of assaulting students. We have witnessed probably the best performance of a leading woman (Dench), and a supporting actress (Blanchett) in any movie that we have seen for 2006.Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) is a new art teacher that has joined the faculty at a British High school. Barbara (Judi Dench) meets Sheba unexpectedly while she is trying to separate two students who are fighting--Barbara quickly resolves the problem. Shortly afterwards, they develop a friendship and Sheba invites her for dinner to meet her family--her much older husband, estranged daughter, and son who suffers from Down syndrome. Barbara soon learns that they are quite different from each other--not only age but socially as well.Sheba invites her this time to a school concert where her son is performing but later that evening when Barbara is in the audience; she notices that Sheba is not there. Barbara goes to another location in the school building and discovers--by looking at a window--that she is having sexual intercourse with a student Steven Connolly (Andrew Simpson.)When director Richard Eyre made this film--in late 2005--he knew that, the subject matter (a teacher/student sexual relationship) would be quite controversial. He takes this contentious topic and gives us a very BBC theatrical presentation for the big screen and does it in such a masterful approach with the cinematography (Chris Menges), the wonderfully composed musical score (Philip Glass), and most importantly the acting. Therefore, these attributes lead to great directionWhen combining these three talented people one would expect a first class film--English theater at its best--with English dry humor, mixed in with situational circumstances. Eyre wants the audience to feel at ease that what we are viewing is just everyday life and this sort of affair happens all the time--especially in the minds of Sheba and Barbara. However, his direction goes much deeper. He wants the viewer to see--the underlining theme--both teachers as predators: for example, the boy is the prey of Sheba (she takes advantage of his innocence), and she is the prey of Barbara who takes advantage of her friendship and current situation--through control and manipulation. Therefore, Barbara preys on the guilt that Sheba is experiencing with the boy and her family.The cinematography creates a wonderful mood of theater: from very charming houses to dark and tainted city streets-- especially the train yard and the places where Sheba and the boy have intercourse.The Oscar nominated composer gives us a very minimalist style (emphasis on consonant harmony, if not functional tonality; and simple repetition) and this in return gives us a very theatrical sound--which adds tension and suspense to each new scene of the movie. The acting from the cast is fantastic and it is very understandable why they were both Oscar nominated. Both actresses are totally immersed in their characters, in which their families and their peers can not compete with the addiction they have.This is a well-acted film that deals with a very controversial subject matter--teacher /student sexual relationship--the director explores the predator theme as well as the addiction of control and manipulation very effectively. We recommend this movie for the following reasons: acting, musical score, cinematography, and the direction of this film. This is a must see film before Oscar night.",5,"Notes on  a Scanda, is a very BBC theatrical presentation for the big screen.",1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,3800,"['Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'respective', 'careers', 'subject', 'matter', 'teacher/student', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'portraying', 'complex', 'characters', 'roles', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'Blanchett', 'Dench', 'essence', 'were', 'sexual', 'predators', 'Today', 'ongoing', 'crisis', 'involving', 'female', 'teachers', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'accused', 'convicted', 'assaulting', 'students', 'have', 'witnessed', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'leading', 'woman', 'Dench', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Blanchett', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', '2006.Sheba', 'Hart', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'new', 'art', 'teacher', 'joined', 'faculty', 'British', 'High', 'school', 'Barbara', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Sheba', 'unexpectedly', 'trying', 'separate', 'two', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'Barbara', 'quickly', 'problem', 'Shortly', 'afterwards', 'develop', 'friendship', 'Sheba', 'dinner', 'meet', 'family', 'much', 'older', 'husband', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'son', 'who', 'Down', 'syndrome', 'Barbara', 'soon', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'not', 'only', 'age', 'socially', 'well.Sheba', 'time', 'school', 'concert', 'where', 'son', 'performing', 'later', 'evening', 'when', 'Barbara', 'audience', 'Sheba', 'not', 'there', 'Barbara', 'location', 'school', 'building', 'discovers', 'looking', 'window', 'having', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'student', 'Steven', 'Connolly', 'Andrew', 'Simpson', 'When', 'director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'made', 'film', 'late', '2005', 'knew', 'subject', 'matter', 'teacher/student', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'controversial', 'contentious', 'topic', 'very', 'BBC', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'big', 'screen', 'masterful', 'approach', 'cinematography', 'Chris', 'Menges', 'wonderfully', 'composed', 'musical', 'score', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'most', 'importantly', 'acting', 'Therefore', 'attributes', 'lead', 'great', 'directionWhen', 'combining', 'three', 'talented', 'people', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'first', 'class', 'film', 'English', 'theater', 'best', 'English', 'dry', 'humor', 'mixed', 'situational', 'circumstances', 'Eyre', 'audience', 'feel', 'ease', 'what', 'are', 'viewing', 'just', 'everyday', 'life', 'sort', 'affair', 'time', 'especially', 'minds', 'Sheba', 'Barbara', 'However', 'direction', 'much', 'deeper', 'viewer', 'see', 'underlining', 'theme', 'teachers', 'predators', 'example', 'boy', 'prey', 'Sheba', 'advantage', 'innocence', 'prey', 'Barbara', 'who', 'advantage', 'friendship', 'current', 'situation', 'control', 'manipulation', 'Therefore', 'Barbara', 'preys', 'guilt', 'Sheba', 'experiencing', 'boy', 'family.The', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'mood', 'theater', 'very', 'charming', 'houses', 'dark', 'tainted', 'city', 'streets', 'especially', 'train', 'yard', 'places', 'where', 'Sheba', 'boy', 'have', 'intercourse.The', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'composer', 'very', 'minimalist', 'style', 'emphasis', 'consonant', 'harmony', 'not', 'functional', 'tonality', 'simple', 'repetition', 'return', 'very', 'theatrical', 'sound', 'tension', 'suspense', 'new', 'scene', 'movie', 'acting', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'very', 'understandable', 'why', 'were', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'actresses', 'are', 'totally', 'immersed', 'characters', 'families', 'peers', 'can', 'not', 'compete', 'addiction', 'have.This', 'well-acted', 'film', 'deals', 'very', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', '/student', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'director', 'predator', 'theme', 'as', 'well', 'addiction', 'control', 'manipulation', 'very', 'effectively', 'recommend', 'movie', 'following', 'reasons', 'acting', 'musical', 'score', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'Oscar', 'night']",Notes on a Scandal

One woman is a veteran school teacher who commands respect from both the staff at the school and the students.  The other is a new school teacher who is extremely attractive, but her looks are a contrast to how things are going in her personal/home life.  The former of the two is single, approaching retirment and the only friend she had in her life before meeting the new teacher was her cat.  The latter of the two is married to a man old enough to be her father and has two children.  One of her kids has Down's Syndrome and the other is a rebellious teen.The older teacher finds more than she bargained for in the new teacher... she is not only a friend to her, but someone who knows a deep dark secret about her.  This secret is the scandel referred to in the title.  The story is not just about the scandel, but about how two emotionally needy women deal with things.  The older teacher keeps a diary wrtiting about others and tends to be very critical of the people she writes about.  She seems to be a person who loves to observe the drama in others lives as if it's an exciting movie or novel.  It became clear that all she wants is to be in love and loved by someone.  The younger teacher wanted to be loved in a way she was not getting from her husband and family.  Therefore, it was very easy for her to bond to a pubescent boy.

645821,A2RNUPVSNW1ZXX,B00005JP63,Heather Walton,"[5, 9]","I bought this movie hoping to see a real bond between the female characters knowing what amazing actresses they both are, but there was no friendship at all really. The character Barbara talked of a spiritual connection and of love between them. I felt nothing at all between them, which made the story unbelievable and shallow. The story of the boy was just a means to show that Sheba was just as lonely as Barbara, but the real story was between the two women, and that story was simply of two teachers having lunch together. I felt the same way about the book and was hoping for much more emotional connection in the movie. With Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett as the actresses in this film it should have been powerful and spellbinding but it was not. Barbara talks of her loneliness, but I did not see that in the way she lived or feel it either. I was hoping for so much more depth and substance between these women and it never happened.For instance the pinnacle moment on the bench when Barbara says their relationship is in a new phase and asks Sheba if she will be alone when she dies, Sheba is clueless of Barbara's intentions and love for her and simply says, of course not. I felt no emotional bond between them and nothing substantial in the way of their relationship which I was hoping for. The writers tried to make Barbara out as sinister, when if fact she was very sweet and a wonderful friend. I would give anything to have a friend like her and I fully understand her lonliness.Sheba tries to justify her right to an affair with the boy when she tells Barbara that she has been coping with her son Ben for 10 years now, who has Down's syndrome. She then goes on to say how the gap between life that she envisioned it and life as it is, is huge and she feels letdown and that having children and being a mother is not meaningful. As a mother of a special needs child myself, I can honestly say that a mother does not see her child as something to cope with. A mother loves her child unconditionally with all her heart and soul regardless of what disability they may have. There is another scene with Sheba, waiting for the boy to call her and watching her husband and children enjoying themselves, as if she is a complete outside observer to her own family. So when Barbara sees Sheba as her friend and envisions them together without the children, I can understand where she got that impression. Sheba also tells Barbara that she feels entitled to an affair with the boy since she has put up with so much from her family and worked so hard in her life.

From her walk, to her died burnt sienna toned hair with just a bit of the white roots showing to her pull-over blue sweater, she manages to pull off a performance that is quite wonderful. Yes, she can play frumpy. Blanchett also gives a nuanced performance as the troubled Sheba who has an affair with a fifteen-year-old student. As the cliche goes, these women, along with Bill Nighy, who plays Sheba's husband Richard, literally tear up the furniture. The score is by Philip Glass, someone whose music I usually don't care much for. In this film, however, as well as ""The Hours,"" it is perfect.I have no idea how often older women seduce children in Great Britain but this phenomenon-- the movie is based on a novel by Zoe Heller-- is quite prevalent in these United States.

The first one was a cute children's movie callec Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web (Widescreen Edition). The second one was less endearing, but altogther more intense and real, Notes on a Scandal.Starring two of Hollywood's most impressive actresses, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchette, Notes on a Scandal is a purely delicious movie that is almost impossible to predict the events. Judi stars as Barbara Covett, a near-retirement history teacher with only a pinkie full of humanity in a hand full of disdain for everything around her. Coming into her school as a newbie teacher, Cate's Sheba Hart is in way over her head as the school's art teacher. Barbara, throwing her bitterness at the new girl without much thought, soon becomes entranced by her, and quickly forces herself into a ""friendship"" with the girl. Soon, Sheba reveals in confidence a clandestine affair that she's having with one of her young charges. Initially horrified, manipulative Barbara soon sees the wealth in such an event, and begins to try to manipulate her way into Sheba's life even more.The events of the story are ""narrated"" by Barbara in an ingenious way; by having her keep a journal, she is able to offer commentary on the scenes that is both funny and character enlightening. We soon pick up on Barb's machinations, knowing the vile she writes in her books, and unfortunately, by the time Sheba picks up on it, the events have spiralled out of control.Wisely, the filmmakes never allow the film to wander into uncomfortable areas that couldn't possibly be addressed: such as why Sheba allows herself to get involved with a 15 year old boy, or why Barbara can't just go online to find herself a partner. This film could have so easily become an ""issue of the week"" film by getting preachy, but tight control of the script allows for that line never to be crossed. And certianly Sheba's desparation is palable, as well as Dench's cunningness. Together, it almost seems to not matter that Sheba's made an unfortunate mistake. All that matters is knowing, soon, there will be a yummy scene where the two ""friends"" confront each other.Notes on a Scandal is short, sweet, beautifull acted.

When Dench develops an obsession with Blanchett, and discovers the affair, the sparks really fly, and the movie builds at an even more breathtaking pace. There's not much point to the film (other than that all single people in the film seem determine to wreck Blanchett's marriage), but who cares when you can see two actresses as fine as Dench and Blanchett work so splendidly. Dench has a role here perfectly within her range as the rebarbarative and covetous Barbara Covett; Blanchett (as always) seems like you've never seen her before, this time as Bathsheba Hart, Covett's beautiful prey. The overdramatic score by Philip Glass is less obstrusive than it might have been given the tremendous scale of these two actresses' performances.",4,The Top of Their Game,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,1470,"['entry', 'girlfriend/', 'temp/', 'babysitter/', 'boyfriend/', 'roommate/', 'etc', 'hell', 'films', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'such', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'THE', 'TEMP', 'SINGLE', 'WHITE', 'FEMALE', 'FEAR', 'NOTES', 'ON', 'A', 'SCANDAL', 'still', 'terrific', 'excitingly', 'paced', 'melodrama', 'showing', 'two', 'splendid', 'actresses', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'absolute', 'best', 'Dench', 'fire-breathing', 'older', 'woman', 'teaching', 'history', 'London', 'public', 'school', 'who', 'hidden', 'history', 'stalking', 'erotomania', 'Blanchett', 'new', 'art', 'teacher', 'unable', 'handle', 'classroom', 'escaping', 'incredible', 'family', 'demands', 'incluiding', 'son', 'Down', 'syndrome', 'who', 'Dench', 'having', 'affair', 'manipulative', '15', 'year-old', 'student', 'When', 'Dench', 'obsession', 'Blanchett', 'affair', 'sparks', 'really', 'fly', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'pace', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'film', 'other', 'single', 'people', 'film', 'seem', 'determine', 'wreck', 'Blanchett', 'marriage', 'who', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'actresses', 'as', 'fine', 'Dench', 'Blanchett', 'work', 'so', 'splendidly', 'Dench', 'role', 'here', 'perfectly', 'range', 'rebarbarative', 'covetous', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'Blanchett', 'always', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'time', 'Bathsheba', 'Hart', 'Covett', 'beautiful', 'prey', 'overdramatic', 'score', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'less', 'obstrusive', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'tremendous', 'scale', 'two', 'actresses', 'performances']",Notes on a Scandal

Unfortunately, this wasn't a good thriller and I wanted my money back after I left the theatre.  This movie is about obsession.  As a moral tale it probably has merit, but as entertainment it is lacking.  None of the main characters in Notes on a Scandal have any redeeming qualities, or are even likeable.  I'm not saying movies with somber topics can't be entertaining.  The Color Purple is fantastic movie.  Even Schindler's List, which I can only describe as horrifying, was a great movie.  I should be horrified by what happened during the Holocaust.  I should have been horrified by Sheba's action in Notes on a Scandal, but that didn't appear to be the intent of the film.Sheba's a new teacher.  She becomes friends with another teacher, Barbara who in turn becomes infatuated/obsessed with Sheba.  When Barbara discovers Sheba is having an affair with a student, she's jealous.  She wants Sheba to be hers.  So, she insists the affair stop and then tacitly blackmails (not for money) Sheba the rest of the film until finally betraying her.  Sheba goes to jail, Barbara moves onto a new target - the end.  Yup, that's it.  Sheba's affair with the student is racy, but her disturbing actions are never truly condemned.  Only Sheba's thirteen year old daughter actually denounces her, ""You're boyfriend is younger than mine!""  But, it comes off laughable instead of the tragedy it is.  Barbara is supposed to be the villain, but shouldn't Sheba be too?  And that's what we have, a movie with two villains.Obviously, others enjoyed the film.  Dench and Blanchett do give excellent performances, and Nighy's supporting turn as Sheba's husband is also commendable.

But our highly evolved brains require something else as well: connection.  We seek it through friends, lovers, music, pets, soap opera characters and in certain desperate situations probably soccer balls.  Without it, we will surely go mad.  Mad like the aptly named Barbara Covett (Judi Dench), who, in turns her attention to a new co-worker in her desperate, endless quest to... connect.Both Barbara and newly hired Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) are teachers at a British high school.  Embittered Barbara has retreated into a position of being feared enough to baby-sit her students without incident.  Told through the icy, disturbing prose of Barbara narrating from her diary, ""Notes on a Scandal"" is a brilliant, unflinching look into the dark heart of loneliness.  Dench is amazing:  It would be easy enough for the story to view Barbara as a diabolical spinster fiend looking to ruin the happiness of the poor, nice people around her.  After all, Hollywood made that movie a couple dozen times in the years following Fatal Attraction.  Both of the film's lead characters are morally corrupt, though it is hard not to feel sympathy for the pair of them. Playing against type effectively, Dench's Barbara ranges from such monstrous and reprehensible selfish acts of manipulation, but then the fragility and loneliness with which Dench endows her forbids us from condemning her completely. Meanwhile, Blanchett makes us sympathise with the well-painted Sheba, trying to escape her everyday life with her Down's Syndrome son and older husband (the wonderful Bill Nighy).Sheba's relationship, or at least affair, with her pupil ( now 18-year-old Andrew Simpson) never in any sense comes across as acceptable in any way, and Simpson straddles the adolescent schoolchild/adult boundary very well. We're made to understand the characters' situation without ever being made to accept it.Director Richard Eyre stages all this with a perfect eye toward detail and human behavior, keeping the fires of a thriller burning at all times through the characters' fear of having both their crimes and their feelings discovered.  Having never read Zoe Hiller's novel What Was She Thinking?:  Notes on a Scandal, I can't say with certainty how much of the sensational dialog comes from her and how much from Marber, but either way, his screenplay adaptation is outstanding as well as the over-the-top soundtrack from Philip Glass who helped kept up the tension levels throug out this film.",4,There's too many lonely people in this world,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,2563,"['Food', 'water', 'clothing', 'shelter', 'are', 'things', 'human', 'beings', 'need', 'physically', 'survive', 'highly', 'evolved', 'brains', 'require', 'something', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'connection', 'seek', 'friends', 'lovers', 'music', 'pets', 'soap', 'opera', 'characters', 'certain', 'desperate', 'situations', 'probably', 'soccer', 'balls', 'will', 'surely', 'go', 'mad', 'Mad', 'aptly', 'named', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'attention', 'new', 'co-worker', 'desperate', 'endless', 'quest', 'connect.Both', 'Barbara', 'newly', 'hired', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'teachers', 'British', 'high', 'school', 'Embittered', 'Barbara', 'retreated', 'position', 'being', 'feared', 'enough', 'baby-sit', 'students', 'incident', 'Told', 'icy', 'disturbing', 'prose', 'Barbara', 'narrating', 'diary', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'brilliant', 'unflinching', 'look', 'dark', 'heart', 'loneliness', 'Dench', 'amazing', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'enough', 'story', 'view', 'Barbara', 'diabolical', 'spinster', 'fiend', 'looking', 'ruin', 'happiness', 'poor', 'nice', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'movie', 'couple', 'dozen', 'times', 'years', 'following', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'film', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'pair', 'Playing', 'type', 'effectively', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'such', 'monstrous', 'reprehensible', 'selfish', 'acts', 'manipulation', 'then', 'fragility', 'loneliness', 'Dench', 'forbids', 'condemning', 'completely', 'Meanwhile', 'Blanchett', 'sympathise', 'well-painted', 'Sheba', 'trying', 'escape', 'everyday', 'life', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'son', 'older', 'husband', 'wonderful', 'Bill', 'Nighy', '.Sheba', 'relationship', 'least', 'affair', 'pupil', 'now', '18-year-old', 'Andrew', 'Simpson', 'never', 'sense', 'acceptable', 'way', 'Simpson', 'adolescent', 'schoolchild/adult', 'boundary', 'very', 'well', ""'re"", 'made', 'understand', 'characters', 'situation', 'ever', 'being', 'made', 'accept', 'it.Director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'perfect', 'eye', 'detail', 'human', 'behavior', 'keeping', 'fires', 'thriller', 'burning', 'times', 'characters', 'fear', 'having', 'crimes', 'feelings', 'discovered', 'Having', 'never', 'read', 'Zoe', 'Hiller', 'novel', 'What', 'Was', 'Thinking', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'certainty', 'how', 'much', 'sensational', 'dialog', 'how', 'much', 'Marber', 'way', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'over-the-top', 'soundtrack', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'who', 'helped', 'kept', 'up', 'tension', 'levels', 'throug', 'out', 'film']",Notes on a Scandal

645842,A20Z1PKIH0PFUF,B00005JP63,JoeyD,"[4, 4]","I wish to preface this review by saying - WHAT A WORLD WE LIVE IN!!!As most of you already know, this film is about a desolate, disgruntled, disagreeable old dame (Barbara Covett played by Judy Dench) who is a burnt out teacher nearing retirement.  She's about as cynical as they come, and when she isn't teaching she spends the rest of her lonely existence taking care of her cat and writing in her journals (which consists mainly of tearing apart her colleagues).  Talk about a sad, pathetic life.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, she is also a lesbian ailing from a broken heart.  Anyway, one day Barb's wretched life seems to finally take a turn for the better when a young, attractive woman (Sheba Hart played by Cate Blanchett) joins the faculty as an art teacher.  At first, Barbara disdains the new teacher - ripping on her in her diary about the way she dresses and of her happy-go-lucky demeanor.  However, in time, the likeable, sweet Sheba wins her over and soon the two become friends (of course, Barbara begins to hope that it leads to more).  I will refrain on disclosing any more info about this film in order to not give anything away.  But let's just say that right after the two become friends, the you-know-what really hits the fan.This film is very dark, depressing, disturbing and even down-right detestable at times.  It's one of those films that leaves you almost embarrased to be a member of the human race.  I guess things like this are happening everyday in our schools now.  It makes a great advertisement for home schooling (of which I am not an advocate of, but I understand why people do).  I will say this though, the writing is absolutely sensational.  Kudos to Patrick Marbler's excellent work on his adapted screenplay from the novel by Zoe Heller (he deserved being nominated for the Oscar).  All that being said, even with the writing as good as it is, it isn't what made this film.  The actors made this film, plain and simple, case closed.  Actually I'm really only referring to two in particular (although Bill Nighy as Richard Hart is quiet excellent, and I'm suprised he didn't get more award nominations) - Dame Judy Dench and future Dame Cate Blancett (how many more years until the Brits knight her?).I have seen a lot of great films in my time, with a lot of great acting.  However, I can't recall seeing a film which had two actresses dominate the screen like these two do.  The crazy thing is that before I saw the film I had really high expectations about how good they would be.  Well, they eclipsed my great expectations and then some.  I have never seen Dame Dench so vulnerable and brave.  She lets us see a side of her that we have never seen before - weak, frumpy, odious, deprived and undignified.  She also lets us see her sans make-up, many times close-up.  There are not many actors like that anymore.  The last time I can recall a big name star showing so much vulnerability was Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"".  Blanchett also isn't afraid of taking on a role which is far from pleasant and appealing.  Her range of emotions in this film run the full gamut, and never once are you not enraptured.  The woman is so damn bewitching and human, that even when she's repulsive we still can't help but love her.  And when she is in a scene with Dench, it's like watching a film about how to be an actress.  In other words, it's an acting clinic!Again, I can not say enough about these two.  They are two of the greatest actresses we have living at this time.  I can see Blanchett going down in history as one of the greatest ever.  And Dench, she just seems to get better and better with age.  They both make this movie, if not terribly enjoyable, extremely interesting to watch.  That is why I recommend it and give it four stars.  If it weren't for them, I might have walked out of the film because of it's disturbing subject matter.",4,Acting Lessons,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3886,"['wish', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'WHAT', 'WORLD', 'WE', 'LIVE', 'IN', 'most', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'desolate', 'disgruntled', 'disagreeable', 'old', 'dame', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'played', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'who', 'burnt', 'out', 'teacher', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'about', 'as', 'cynical', 'come', 'when', ""n't"", 'teaching', 'rest', 'lonely', 'existence', 'taking', 'care', 'cat', 'writing', 'journals', 'mainly', 'tearing', 'apart', 'colleagues', 'Talk', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'life', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'almost', 'forgot', 'also', 'lesbian', 'ailing', 'broken', 'heart', 'Anyway', 'one', 'day', 'Barb', 'wretched', 'life', 'finally', 'take', 'turn', 'better', 'when', 'young', 'attractive', 'woman', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'faculty', 'art', 'teacher', 'first', 'Barbara', 'new', 'teacher', 'ripping', 'diary', 'way', 'happy-go-lucky', 'demeanor', 'However', 'time', 'likeable', 'sweet', 'Sheba', 'over', 'soon', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'course', 'Barbara', 'hope', 'more', 'will', 'refrain', 'disclosing', 'more', 'info', 'film', 'order', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'right', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'you-know-what', 'really', 'fan.This', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'depressing', 'disturbing', 'even', 'down-right', 'detestable', 'times', 'one', 'films', 'almost', 'embarrased', 'be', 'member', 'human', 'race', 'guess', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'everyday', 'schools', 'now', 'great', 'advertisement', 'home', 'schooling', 'am', 'not', 'advocate', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'writing', 'absolutely', 'sensational', 'Kudos', 'Patrick', 'Marbler', 'excellent', 'work', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'Zoe', 'Heller', 'deserved', 'being', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'being', 'said', 'even', 'writing', 'as', 'good', ""n't"", 'what', 'made', 'film', 'actors', 'made', 'film', 'plain', 'simple', 'case', 'closed', 'Actually', ""'m"", 'really', 'only', 'referring', 'two', 'particular', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Richard', 'Hart', 'quiet', 'excellent', ""'m"", 'suprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'award', 'nominations', 'Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'future', 'Dame', 'Cate', 'Blancett', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'Brits', 'knight', '.I', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'great', 'films', 'time', 'lot', 'great', 'acting', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'actresses', 'dominate', 'screen', 'two', 'do', 'crazy', 'thing', 'saw', 'film', 'had', 'really', 'high', 'expectations', 'how', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'Well', 'eclipsed', 'great', 'expectations', 'then', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Dame', 'Dench', 'so', 'vulnerable', 'brave', 'see', 'side', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'weak', 'frumpy', 'odious', 'deprived', 'undignified', 'also', 'see', 'sans', 'make-up', 'many', 'times', 'close-up', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'actors', 'anymore', 'last', 'time', 'can', 'recall', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'showing', 'so', 'much', 'vulnerability', 'was', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Schmidt', 'Blanchett', 'also', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'taking', 'role', 'far', 'pleasant', 'appealing', 'range', 'emotions', 'film', 'run', 'full', 'gamut', 'never', 'once', 'are', 'not', 'enraptured', 'woman', 'so', 'damn', 'bewitching', 'human', 'even', 'when', 'repulsive', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'when', 'scene', 'Dench', 'watching', 'film', 'how', 'be', 'actress', 'other', 'words', 'acting', 'clinic', 'Again', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'two', 'are', 'two', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'have', 'living', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'Blanchett', 'going', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'Dench', 'just', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'age', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'terribly', 'enjoyable', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'watch', 'why', 'recommend', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'might', 'have', 'walked', 'film', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'matter']",Notes on a Scandal

Rooney,"[2, 2]","Barbara (Judi Dench), a strict, prissy, judgmental, lonely  middle-aged teacher in a London high school, is a wicked spider spinning her web to ensnare the very sensuous Sheba (Cate Blanchett), a new young teacher at the school. Sheba is married to an older man, played by Bill Nighy, but she lets her passions get the best of her, falls for and has intimate relations with a fifteen-year-old student, well-played by Andrew Simpson. Termagant Barbara keeps a diary in which she posts gold stars for her best days. It's a thriller with lots of suspense as we follow Barbara on her pursuit of the younger woman. When she finds out about the clandestine taboo affair, the cradle robbing, she doesn't mind a little blackmail to get her prize.The acting is superb, the story gripping. In voice overs Barbara describes her machinations and her all-consuming obsession with Sheba. She gets invited to Sheba's home, a noisy household, where the father maintains a bohemian lifestyle with his kids, one a prickly teenage daughter and a boy suffering from Down Syndrome. Barbara is seeking an intimacy with her prey, Sheba. She talks about ""life as you dream it and life as you live it.""""Barbara says of Sheba, ""She's the one I've waited for."" and ""We are bound by the secrets we share."" Barbara's previous friendship with a woman had unraveled, and the woman left London to get away from possessive, controlling Barbara who says, ""They always let you down in the end."" Barbara is a devil, a witch, rhymes with b----.Barbara's beloved cat dies, and Barbara wants Sheba to give up family obligations to mourn for the cat which she refuses to do.The soundtrack heightens the melodramatic mood. The movie has a dramatic supercharged ending. The dialogue is clever and literate. When Sheba gets caught, Barbara gets in deep trouble too. Sheba's finding of gold stars on the floor of Barbara's apartment leads to the climactic scenes. At the end Barbara, the undeterred predator, is searching out new prey.Dench is superb, spot-on in the flick, playing a harridan, a woman who deserves pity rather than compassion.",5,Judy Dench Gets A Gold Star,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,2099,"['Barbara', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'strict', 'prissy', 'judgmental', 'lonely', 'middle-aged', 'teacher', 'London', 'high', 'school', 'wicked', 'spider', 'spinning', 'web', 'ensnare', 'very', 'sensuous', 'Sheba', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'new', 'young', 'teacher', 'school', 'Sheba', 'married', 'older', 'man', 'played', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'passions', 'get', 'best', 'intimate', 'relations', 'fifteen-year-old', 'student', 'well-played', 'Andrew', 'Simpson', 'Termagant', 'Barbara', 'diary', 'gold', 'stars', 'best', 'days', 'thriller', 'lots', 'suspense', 'follow', 'Barbara', 'pursuit', 'younger', 'woman', 'When', 'out', 'clandestine', 'taboo', 'affair', 'cradle', 'robbing', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'blackmail', 'get', 'prize.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'gripping', 'voice', 'overs', 'Barbara', 'machinations', 'all-consuming', 'obsession', 'Sheba', 'invited', 'Sheba', 'home', 'noisy', 'household', 'where', 'father', 'bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'kids', 'one', 'prickly', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'boy', 'suffering', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'Barbara', 'seeking', 'intimacy', 'prey', 'Sheba', 'life', 'dream', 'life', 'live', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'one', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'are', 'bound', 'secrets', 'share', 'Barbara', 'previous', 'friendship', 'woman', 'had', 'unraveled', 'woman', 'left', 'London', 'get', 'away', 'possessive', 'controlling', 'Barbara', 'who', 'always', 'let', 'down', 'end', 'Barbara', 'devil', 'witch', 'b', '.Barbara', 'beloved', 'cat', 'dies', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'give', 'up', 'family', 'obligations', 'mourn', 'cat', 'do.The', 'soundtrack', 'melodramatic', 'mood', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'supercharged', 'ending', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'literate', 'When', 'Sheba', 'caught', 'Barbara', 'deep', 'trouble', 'too', 'Sheba', 'finding', 'gold', 'stars', 'floor', 'Barbara', 'apartment', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'end', 'Barbara', 'undeterred', 'predator', 'searching', 'out', 'new', 'prey.Dench', 'superb', 'spot-on', 'flick', 'playing', 'harridan', 'woman', 'who', 'pity', 'rather', 'compassion']",Notes on a Scandal
645844,A311626XD2C4T2,B00005JP63,JordanJasper,"[0, 0]","File this one under: A Must-Watch/Must-Own for Fans of Top-Notch ActressesFor everyone else (or for the more casual film fan) 'Notes On a Scandal' will likely prove to be disconcerting and difficult to simply curl-up and appreciate as a rainy day distraction. This is not to say that the film isn't good: it is. Both Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett give riveting performances and, in that sense, serious fans of delicious scenery-chewing dialogue and world-class acting on-display will want to own and savor the juicy work of these noted women.The plot centers around two teachers at a working-class English high school. Barbara (Dench) is a prickly old spinster with a jaded view of her world, her job and certainly her students. Her chief comforts in life appear to be chain-smoking, obsessive journal-keeping and her cat, Portia. Bathsheba (Blanchett) is a dreamy bourgeoise wife and mother with an art degree. The daughter of a famous economist, &#34;Sheba&#34; is bored and frustrated in her upper middle-class comfort-zone, detached from her much older husband, and is exhausted from years of raising a Downs Syndrome child. To alleviate her tedium, she ventures into a teaching position at Barb's school and proves herself immediately ill-equipped for the task in a multitude of ways, not least of which is her shocking weakness for the aggressive affections of a 15 year-old student.Sheba is not alone in her twisted existence, however, for old Barbara (having stumbled upon Sheba's dark secret) uses the pretense of a &#34;normal friendship&#34;  to spin a web of manipulation and psychological blackmail as intense as any I have ever seen depicted on film. Her goal, which becomes apparent at a properly unnerving pace as the narrative progresses, is creepy to the Nth Degree, and fuels the aforementioned intensity that will make for a genuinely unforgettable viewing experience. Primary themes of obsession, stalking, homosexuality, pedophilia and adultery do not, of course, constitute automatic deficiencies regarding 'Notes On a Scandal,' but these subjects do demand careful treatment in order to keep an effective dramatic portrayal of the depths of human deceit amid &#34;ordinary folk&#34; from careening into a buffet of disconnected vignettes of depravity sandwiched between slices of ennui. The great performances and solid writing keep the whole thing anchored, fortunately. For anyone who has ever been stalked or blackmailed, Dench --wizened, wrinkled and warped-- will give you the heebie-jeebies in a big way. For anyone with kids in high school, this film could drive you swiftly to the bottle with displaced anxiety. Obvious kudos go to the two leads, but Bill Nighy also deserves special mention in a superb supporting role as the dazed and confused husband of Blanchett's character. A couple of stars are detracted due to Sheba's under-explored characterization (we get hints, but not a lot to go on, aside from Blanchett's perfect reading of the somewhat cardboard underlying persona), a few spots of stilted pacing, and one or two ham-handed segues.Otherwise, this daring &#34;human drama&#34; really plays like a hard-core psycho-thriller in disguise and, I kid you not, is more of an ideal Halloween-time film than something with which you'll want to relax on a typical evening. It may look at first glance like a &#34;chick flick,&#34; but it AIN'T. Peculiar and good enough to make your skin crawl, 'Notes On a Scandal' is more than anything a showcase for two of the world's most gifted actresses plying their trade up at the sharp end. Film fans who love that sort of razzle-dazzle will want to add this to their collections, no matter how they feel about the admittedly difficult subject-matter.",3,Disturbing Melodramatic Showcase for Powerhouse Actresses,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,3733,"['one', 'Must-Watch/Must-Own', 'Fans', 'Top-Notch', 'ActressesFor', 'everyone', 'else', 'more', 'casual', 'film', 'fan', 'Scandal', 'will', 'likely', 'prove', 'be', 'disconcerting', 'difficult', 'simply', 'curl-up', 'appreciate', 'rainy', 'day', 'distraction', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'good', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'give', 'riveting', 'performances', 'sense', 'serious', 'fans', 'delicious', 'scenery-chewing', 'dialogue', 'world-class', 'acting', 'on-display', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'savor', 'juicy', 'work', 'noted', 'women.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'two', 'teachers', 'working-class', 'English', 'high', 'school', 'Barbara', 'Dench', 'prickly', 'old', 'spinster', 'jaded', 'view', 'world', 'job', 'certainly', 'students', 'chief', 'comforts', 'life', 'appear', 'be', 'chain-smoking', 'obsessive', 'journal-keeping', 'cat', 'Portia', 'Bathsheba', 'Blanchett', 'dreamy', 'bourgeoise', 'wife', 'mother', 'art', 'degree', 'daughter', 'famous', 'economist', '34', 'Sheba', '34', 'bored', 'frustrated', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'comfort-zone', 'detached', 'much', 'older', 'husband', 'exhausted', 'years', 'raising', 'Downs', 'Syndrome', 'child', 'alleviate', 'tedium', 'ventures', 'teaching', 'position', 'Barb', 'school', 'immediately', 'ill-equipped', 'task', 'multitude', 'ways', 'not', 'least', 'shocking', 'weakness', 'aggressive', 'affections', '15', 'year-old', 'student.Sheba', 'not', 'alone', 'twisted', 'existence', 'however', 'old', 'Barbara', 'having', 'stumbled', 'Sheba', 'dark', 'secret', 'pretense', '34', 'normal', 'friendship', '34', 'spin', 'web', 'manipulation', 'psychological', 'blackmail', 'as', 'intense', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'depicted', 'film', 'goal', 'apparent', 'properly', 'unnerving', 'pace', 'narrative', 'progresses', 'creepy', 'Nth', 'Degree', 'aforementioned', 'intensity', 'will', 'make', 'genuinely', 'unforgettable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Primary', 'themes', 'obsession', 'stalking', 'homosexuality', 'pedophilia', 'adultery', 'do', 'not', 'course', 'constitute', 'automatic', 'deficiencies', 'regarding', ""'Notes"", 'Scandal', 'subjects', 'do', 'demand', 'careful', 'treatment', 'order', 'keep', 'effective', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'depths', 'human', 'deceit', '34', 'ordinary', 'folk', '34', 'careening', 'buffet', 'disconnected', 'vignettes', 'depravity', 'sandwiched', 'slices', 'ennui', 'great', 'performances', 'solid', 'writing', 'keep', 'whole', 'thing', 'anchored', 'fortunately', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'stalked', 'blackmailed', 'Dench', 'wizened', 'wrinkled', 'warped', 'will', 'give', 'heebie-jeebies', 'big', 'way', 'anyone', 'kids', 'high', 'school', 'film', 'could', 'drive', 'swiftly', 'bottle', 'displaced', 'anxiety', 'Obvious', 'kudos', 'go', 'two', 'leads', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'also', 'special', 'mention', 'superb', 'supporting', 'role', 'dazed', 'confused', 'husband', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'couple', 'stars', 'are', 'detracted', 'due', 'Sheba', 'under-explored', 'characterization', 'get', 'hints', 'not', 'lot', 'go', 'aside', 'Blanchett', 'perfect', 'reading', 'somewhat', 'cardboard', 'underlying', 'persona', 'few', 'spots', 'stilted', 'pacing', 'one', 'two', 'ham-handed', 'segues.Otherwise', 'daring', '34', 'human', 'drama', '34', 'really', 'hard-core', 'psycho-thriller', 'disguise', 'kid', 'not', 'more', 'ideal', 'Halloween-time', 'film', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'relax', 'typical', 'evening', 'may', 'look', 'first', 'glance', '34', 'chick', 'flick', '34', 'AI', ""N'T"", 'Peculiar', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'skin', 'crawl', 'Scandal', 'more', 'anything', 'showcase', 'two', 'world', 'most', 'gifted', 'actresses', 'plying', 'trade', 'up', 'sharp', 'end', 'Film', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'sort', 'razzle-dazzle', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'collections', 'matter', 'how', 'feel', 'admittedly', 'difficult', 'subject-matter']",Notes on a Scandal
645845,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JP63,Joseph Haschka,"[11, 13]","Having the seductive beauty of Cate Blanchett must be a nuisance; everyone wants to possess you.Here, in NOTES ON A SCANDAL, the looks belong to Sheba Hart, the novice art teacher who's just joined the faculty of St. George's, an urban secondary school in the UK (perhaps in Eastbourne, where much of it was filmed). The narrator of the piece is Barbara Covett (Judi Dench), the frumpy, disliked, feared, old battleaxe of a history teacher, who despises her students and has, at first, only a condescending contempt for Sheba, her proletarian manner of dress, and her sexual attractiveness to the male teachers. Yet, after Barbara helps break up a fight between two of Hart's students, Sheba invites Covett over for dinner with the family, and the two become casual friends.Hart's family is unexpectedly unusual. Sheba, at 37, is married to Richard (Bill Nighy), a man some 15-20 years her senior. The two have had two children together, ""pocket princess"" Saskia (Alice Bird) and Ben (Max Lewis), the latter afflicted with Down's Syndrome. But the excitement has gone out of the Hart marriage, and Sheba embarks on a professionally perilous sexual liaison, in this case with one of her 15-year old pupils, Steven (Andrew Simpson). Barbara discovers the affair and confronts Hart. However, professing solicitous friendship for Hart and a wish to protect the school's reputation, Covett vows to keep mum about the tawdry affair on the condition that Sheba end it immediately.At first, the audience may take the plot at face value - the story of a female mentor taking sexual advantage of an underage student a la Mary Kay Letourneau and Debra LaFave. But, hang on a minute, the identity of a sexually and emotionally rapacious predator can be more insidious and less obvious. Soon, we see the darker side of Barbara, a bitter, lonely spinster physically unloved for so long that, as she puts it, Saturday nights are built around a visit to the launderette and the casual touch of a bus conductor sends a jolt of longing to her groin.NOTES ON A SCANDAL can be seen as a bruising essay on the corrosiveness of isolation from the otherwise nurturing effects of human emotional and physical contact. This film is a two-woman show - Dench and Blanchett - and it would be inaccurate to state that either one supports the other. Both could get an Oscar nod for best performance in a leading role. (It could be a bountiful harvest of award nominations for Commonwealth actresses this year; besides Judi and Cate, Helen Mirren is superb as THE QUEEN.)Perhaps the most chilling scene is the last involving two women sitting on a park bench. It's here that one may perceive Barbara as a sort of starving spider weaving her web to snare unsuspecting prey.

It was suggested to me by a friend whose advice on film I respect so I picked up the film. I continue to respect that friend's film advice.Never has a movie made me feel gritty, dirty, happy, angry, bitter, and more in a matter of five minutes. The story being told is one of the humans need to do whatever possible to obtain their utmost desire. We have Judi Dench as the nearly-retired school teacher whose obsession with younger teachers brings her into Cate Blanchett's character's new lease on life as she begins teaching again after caring for a family for years. Fortunate for Dench's obsession, Blanchett's character has a secret that will keep her in the hands of Dench's pitiful game.The film's pace is very steady for a drama. We're also given subtly quirky side characters to please our front runners. And as for the front runners? Judi Dench captivated me with her performance. Most of the feelings I mentioned up top sprung from her decisions with her character, Barbara. She was obviously the antagonist, but in ways, I wanted to view her as the protagonist. And Blanchett's Sheba was portrayed with just the right amount of humanity.

It's a powerful film, with powerful performances that made several top 10 lists and received a couple Academy Award nominations...Two, deservedly, for Best Actress (Judi Dench) and Best Supporting Actress (Cate Blanchett). The film made a couple top 10 lists, but I think it deserved to make many more as I believe that it's easily one of the top 10 best films I saw from 2006. Actors often remark that it's more fun to play a bad guy than a good one and realistic characters don't get much more evil than Barbara (Dench), a teacher at a private school. She's feared, disliked, but respected by all the students and staff...She also serves as the narrator of the film, as Barbara enjoys filling in her opinions and views into a diary. Barbara is a lonely woman, unable to connect with people. She's probably a repressed lesbian and could easily be deemed psychotic. Pretty soon, a new teacher arrives at the school that captures Barbara's attention. The woman is Sheba Hart (Blanchett), a young and beautiful art teacher who not only captures Barbara's attention but the attention of all the staff and students. After Barbara and Sheba become friends, Barbara catches Sheba doing something unthinkable. Having sex with a 15-year-old sophomore. Barbara suddenly sees a way to play the event to her advantage and begins blackmailing Sheba in exchange for some companionship. Fearing the loss of her family and jailtime, Sheba complies but doesn't quite realize that the companionship Barbara is looking for goes beyond hanging out and having dinner occasionally. Cate Blanchett, already an Oscar winner for ""The Aviator,"" gave the best performance out of Supporting Actress nominees. She didn't win for three reasons; One is that Jennifer Hudson presented the ultimate ""dreams come true!"" story and was a favorite from the beginning. Two is that Hudson's performance was extremely hyped and ""Notes on a Scandal"" wasn't. And the third is because Blanchett already has an Oscar and the Academy does pay attention to that. Even though Dench is incredible, it was Blanchett and Bill Nighy (as her much-older husband) that stole the show for me. Blanchett is quite simply fascinating to watch in this role. There's a lot of great performances out there, but then there's the ones that hold your eyes to the screen (for me Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"" and John Malkovich in ""Dangerous Liaisons"" would be a couple examples)...Blanchett gives one of those performances. Bill Nighy is an incredible, very underrated actor who is very good at stealing the show (Love, Actually anybody?) but here he shows incredible dramatic range. ""Notes on a Scandal"" is a great film, powerful and well acted. It shouldn't be missed.GRADE: A",5,One of the Best Films of 2006,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,2832,"['recent', 'surge', 'teacher-student', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'was', 'released', 'perfect', 'time', 'powerful', 'film', 'powerful', 'performances', 'made', 'several', 'top', '10', 'lists', 'received', 'couple', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Two', 'deservedly', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'film', 'made', 'couple', 'top', '10', 'lists', 'think', 'deserved', 'make', 'many', 'more', 'believe', 'easily', 'one', 'top', '10', 'best', 'films', 'saw', '2006', 'Actors', 'often', 'remark', 'more', 'fun', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'one', 'realistic', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'more', 'evil', 'Barbara', 'Dench', 'teacher', 'private', 'school', 'feared', 'disliked', 'respected', 'students', 'staff', 'also', 'narrator', 'film', 'Barbara', 'filling', 'opinions', 'views', 'diary', 'Barbara', 'lonely', 'woman', 'unable', 'connect', 'people', 'probably', 'repressed', 'lesbian', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'deemed', 'psychotic', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'new', 'teacher', 'school', 'Barbara', 'attention', 'woman', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'Blanchett', 'young', 'beautiful', 'art', 'teacher', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'Barbara', 'attention', 'attention', 'staff', 'students', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'become', 'friends', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'doing', 'something', 'unthinkable', 'Having', 'sex', '15-year-old', 'sophomore', 'Barbara', 'suddenly', 'way', 'play', 'event', 'advantage', 'blackmailing', 'Sheba', 'exchange', 'companionship', 'Fearing', 'loss', 'family', 'jailtime', 'Sheba', 'complies', ""n't"", 'quite', 'realize', 'companionship', 'Barbara', 'looking', 'hanging', 'out', 'having', 'dinner', 'occasionally', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'already', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Aviator', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'nominees', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'three', 'reasons', 'One', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'presented', 'ultimate', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'favorite', 'beginning', 'Two', 'Hudson', 'performance', 'was', 'extremely', 'hyped', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'was', ""n't"", 'third', 'Blanchett', 'already', 'Oscar', 'Academy', 'pay', 'attention', 'Even', 'Dench', 'incredible', 'was', 'Blanchett', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'much-older', 'husband', 'stole', 'show', 'Blanchett', 'quite', 'simply', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'role', 'lot', 'great', 'performances', 'out', 'there', 'then', 'ones', 'hold', 'eyes', 'screen', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'would', 'be', 'couple', 'examples', 'Blanchett', 'one', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'incredible', 'very', 'underrated', 'actor', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'stealing', 'show', 'Love', 'Actually', 'anybody', 'here', 'incredible', 'dramatic', 'range', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'great', 'film', 'powerful', 'well', 'acted', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed.GRADE']",Notes on a Scandal

Ms. Dench is very creepy, very convincing as a chronically lonely, manipulative lesbian.  I've seen better acting from Cate Blanchett but even her worst acting is better than what you can expect from most actresses.  Bill Nighy also turns in a convincing performance as the cuckholded husband.I did not find this movie shocking in its content or disturbing, although I cannot understand how a grown woman can find a spindly, scrawny boy sexually appealing.  Ms. Dench's acting is what disturbed me.  She reminds me of a spider in a web, patiently waiting to ensnare her prey.  As a lonely, bitter spinster she successfully runs off every person she befriends with her ""intensity"".  She is obsessive, possessive, grabbing, clawing, but her prey doesn't see it coming.  If you appreciate great performances by great actresses, I highly recommend this movie.  Dame Dench's performance is one you will not soon forget.The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because I reserve five stars for movies that move me on an emotional and intellectual level, which this movie did not.

645849,A24CASOMWGS87I,B00005JP63,"Juan Camaney ""Book Hunter""","[7, 8]","Despite its pedigree, its superlative cast, a suspenseful screenplay and intense directing, ""Notes on a Scandal"" settles for becoming a sort of ""Misery"" for the art house crowd,with Dame Judi in the Kathy Bates role.It's a very entertaining film while it lasts though. And yet... the story feels so forty years ago with its portrayal of an old, ugly, repressed predatory lesbian character (Dench) with the hots for a beautiful, flirtatious, lost soul (Blanchett). The novel in which this movie is based is said to have some comedy in it, all of which has been unfortunately excised in its transition to the screen.Judi Dench's performance is a powerhouse though. She shows the humanity behind the monstrous Barbara Covett. It's a devastating portrayal of loneliness.But the film indulges once again the cliched obsession with the perils lurking behind those lonely, usually ugly, single souls (teachers, janitors, one hour photographers, it's always the low paid professions which breed the psychos). If these people are not already crazy, these kind of movies will help do the trick, and scare any of their potential friends away, setting off alarms when such a person approaches.On the other hand, the film shies away from fully exploring Cate Blanchet's tormented character and her relationship with an under age student. This throws the film off balance, though there are hints of greatness in Blanchett's performance, revealing a beautiful, smart, but not quite brilliant woman who is still waiting for  life to show its beauty, while trapped in a boring marriage. Had the film delved more in depth in her problems, and focused on her own predatory, manipulatory traits, it would have carried more of a punch.Richard Eyre is a laureate British theater director and has directed some good films (""Iris"", ""Stage Beauty""). And yet the, sometimes treacherous, fascination of a theater director (and of the actors) for larger than life characters, and powerhouse performances, over an actually good, profound story, is in evidence here.All that taken into account, and knowing that this is not really as serious a film as it would like to be, it's a great entertainment, with Dench and Blanchett delivering the goods and creating fireworks on screen. The story is enjoyably, predictably suspenseful and indeed moving in several scenes.The voice over narration of Dame Judi, writing in her girlish, adoring, diary is something you won't soon forget.

645854,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JP63,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[73, 89]","One of the more critically lauded pictures of 2006, I was primarily interested in ""Notes on a Scandal"" for its Oscar nominated screenplay by Patrick Marber.  Previously having brought ""Closer"" to the screen, I was eager to see his follow up.  I know ""Closer"" had its detractors--but for me the writing was scathingly funny and refreshingly adult.  And the concept behind ""Notes"" also sounded intriguingly grown-up.  Let's be honest--who wouldn't want to see Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench square off?  Emotionally and physically, this could be a battle of two of our most respected actresses.  And while I did admire much of the film, the thing that ultimately disappointed me was the screenplay--and the aspects of character motivation that it doesn't bother to address.""Scandal"" introduces us to Blanchett, a new art teacher at the local high school.  Awkward to her new position, she is something of a joke to a more experienced faculty member (played by Dench).  Dench is a stern disciplinarian, and one day assists Blanchett with a confrontation.  Captivated by the naivete of the new teacher, Dench takes her under her wing.  Forming a personal friendship, Dench even visits Blanchett's home and spends time with her family.  Clearly yearning for an even closer friendship, Dench is startled to discover Blanchett is carrying on a sexual liaison with one of her students.  Instead of turning her in, though, she uses the knowledge to gain psychological control over Blanchett.  What follows is a battle of wills as the truth begins to emerge--both about the scandal and about Dench's ulterior motives.I certainly think that ""Notes On a Scandal"" is a good movie bolstered by strong performances.  I don't think, however, that it's quite as perfect as some people would make out.  Blanchett's Sheba is such a superficial character--right down to the artificiality, the staginess, of her name.  Blanchett does what she can to make the character appealing, but in no way do we ever really understand her motivations.  Her casual indifference to putting her family and livelihood on the line is never explained, and we aren't invited to see anything deeper than what the character puts out for the rest of the world.  Why is she married to a man old enough to be her father?  What keeps her involved in teaching when it seems an uncomfortable fit?  Why would this seemingly lovely woman, with a happy (by all appearances) home life, sacrifice everything to commit a crime?  Why does she willfully engage in an act society would judge as morally reprehensible?  Keeping Sheba an enigma didn't ruin the film for me, but it did keep me at arm's length.  Lacking a basic understanding of the ""scandal"" referenced in the title definitely kept this entertaining film from being ""great"" and insightful--at least to me.Judi Dench does have a field day, however.  Rarely cast in a villainous light, Dench really sinks her teeth into this meaty role.  Without make-up and looking every bit her age, it's a vanity free performance.  At first, dismissive and condescending to her new colleague, she lights up at a potential friendship with Sheba.  Then when the scandal breaks, she takes it as a great opportunity to insinuate herself even further into Sheba's life.  The undertones of attraction and loathing are well played, and her menace increases as her desire to control Sheba becomes more apparent.  I recommend ""Notes"" not as high art--but as a study in conflicting acting styles, and to see two great actresses go head to head.

645855,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B00005JP63,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[55, 56]","Notes on a Scandal is a gripping, captivating story of two lonely women and the ragged way they fall in and out of love. Sheba, a young art teacher, who falls into a torrid affair with a 15-year-old student, ostensibly because of the disappointment and difficulties in her family life. Then Barbara, an older history teacher, who takes Sheba under her wing--or so she thinks--and is the first to know her secret. The way this story unravels is enthralling and hard to watch, but at the same time I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. I found myself sympathizing with Sheba, though I knew her actions were wrong, because I could understand the ache of loneliness one must feel when you begin to wonder if you've made the wrong choices in your life. Similarly, though the seemingly benevolent Barbara eventually turns out to have a cruel streak, I found myself empathizing for her lack of companionship and the fact that she seemed so completely alone. Notes on a Scandal is a story about loneliness, the banality of cruelty, and the harsh reality of living and accepting the choices you've made.

645859,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JP63,Larry VanDeSande,"[5, 6]","While this film could easily have crossed the boundaries of good taste, it is the electricity of the two female leads that sets this film about real life illicit romance, secrets, subterfuge and lies apart from exploitation. Based loosely on someone's book, and with a great deal of the real-life Mary Kay Letourneau story thrown in, ""Notes On A Scandal"" are literally the notes one of the female leads keeps in her diary about the schoolboy-school teacher romance the other one is conducting.Kate Blanchett plays the wayward teacher in the mold of Letourneau, the real-life schoolteacher whose love affair with an underaged schoolboy led to her birthing two children by him, being convicted of statutory rape and doing a stini in prison for it,and later marrying him. While many of the seemingly all blond, young and nice looking teachers that have made the papers the last few years appear similar to Letourneau -- including Blanchett's sympathetic performance as her clone -- they were in fact mostly quite different. Letourneau actually loved the boy; most of these teachers just wanted something frilly and exciting in their lives and chose the outlet closest to them to achieve that. Many of them already has bikini or other leering photos posted on their MySpace sites before they engaged in the illegal activity.While Blanchett demonstrates Oscar-worthy acting in the role as a British teacher in a school of lowlife students, Judi Densch is equally adept (perhaps even better) in her role as Blanchett's confidant, the coworker that keeps her secret life in exchange for their budding friendship. It seems Densch's character has specialized in certain forms of friendship throughout her life, as a scene with a school administrator makes clear late in the film. It helps you understand -- if you hadn't guessed it already -- that Densch's grip on Blanchett is far beyond friendship and forms another boundary of exploitation in this film that looks perversely into our sexual underground far more than anything we saw in the ultra-sexed ""Kinsey"" biopic from a few years back.So four stars for this interesting and exquisitely well-acted (by some of the supporting players, too) film about modern day problems given a twist by Londonwood (it's a British film, after all.)

645860,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JP63,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","The moment I best remember from Judy Dench's Oscar-winning performance in ""Shakespeare in Love"" comes when Queen Elizabeth has made her presence known at the premier performance of ""Romeo & Juliet.""  Gwyneth Paltrow, who is playing Viola De Lesseps pretending to be Thomas Kent playing Juliet, is called forth by the Queen and is about to make the mistake of curtseying (as a woman) instead of bowing (as a man).  We cut to a shot of the Queen, and I swear that Dame Judy's right eye dilates an eighth of an inch and that is all.  Maybe I am just imagining it and the moment is a total projection on my part.  But it is because of that scene that I think of her acting skill as being honed to the degree that such small things have such big impacts.  I also think that she can do more with a look and a moment of silence than most of the practitioners of her craft.  These abilities are more than amply displayed in ""Notes on a Scandal.""Dench plays Barbara Covett, who has been teaching for several decades at a British prep school.  She has been living alone with just a cat for company, but she wants something more in her life and the opportunity affords itself when Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) shows up as the school's new art teacher.  Barbara, who clearly has no friends at the school, cultivates a friendship with the younger woman, who as a neophyte teacher thinks that the older woman can be something of a mentor.  An actual friendship appears to be budding, but then one night at school Barbara spies Sheba with a 15-year old student, Steven Connelly (Andrew Simpson).  Once her initial fury over the discovery subsides, Barbara realizes: ""There was a magnificent opportunity here. With stealth, I might secure the prize long-term, forever in my debt. I could gain everything by doing nothing.""  The rest of this 2006 film is about how Barbara tries to take advantage of Sheba's mistake and the lives ruined in the process.I know that ""Notes on a Scandal"" is seen by some as a variation on the ""Fatal Attraction"" theme, but the movie I kept thinking about was ""The Silence of the Lambs"" because it is Dench's delicious portrayal of the villain that is the most captivating aspect.  But Sheba Hart is no Clarice Starling.  Blanchett is undeniably a first-rate actress, but I am inclined to think this may well have been a stronger film with a lesser actress in the role, because Sheba is not a formidable foe for Barbara.  This is not a strong woman being brought down by a lesser one, so I was tempted to invest Sheba with more strength and character than she deserves as written.  Ironically, the same argument can be made for Dench's Barbara, as it takes us a while to stop giving the character the benefit of the doubt because of her is playing her.  But then at the heart of this story is the revelation that Barbara is the spider, overjoyed to discover the fly in her net, especially since it seems to be a wanna-be spider when it comes to being a predator.The flaw here is that Barbara ends up being her own worst enemy in trying to be Sheba's best friend.  Again, I was reminded of Hannibal Lecter, because my biggest complaint with the recent ""Hannibal Rising"" was that the younger version of the character was more lucky than smart.  Once you decide to enjoy the ride from the perspective of the villain, whether you are talking Richard III or Barbara Covett, you expect them to be brought down by their tragic flaw instead of by a stupid mistake, even if Barbara's anger is clearly the chink in her armor.  I am told this particular end game is the responsibility of the screenplay by Patrick Marber rather than the original novel by Zoe Heller, which would be an additional reason to read the book if you find the character and the situation compelling.  I did and so I will, in no small part because of the mesmerizing performance by Dench.

They're in their 60s and 70s. They sat in the theater afterwards and tried to analyze the movie and find its faults.  They were sure the faults were there but they were dumbfounded.  Judi Dench as Barbara looked and behaved like the epitome of what every older woman does not want to be.  My aunts rented the video and started a club talking about NOTES ON A SCANDAL specifically Judi Dench's performance. Then they found the ""special features"" on the video and started in on that based on what the director and actors had to say.  They said and I quote, ""Just because an older woman sits on a bench at one of the highest points in the city, no less, does not mean she is sad and lonely. She may be sitting there taking a rest, recuperating and milling over her three dead husbands, six children (and grands), missed child-support checks, lost loves and lost youth and arthritis.  She may have lots of ghosts sitting there beside her from the past talking and laughing about old times. She is not lonely and she is not looking for another affair or relationship. I just hate it when people stereotype older women assuming they have to have a man or some children constantly around them or they are assumed to be lonely. If a woman has done all that well-enough she is not looking to do it again.  She is not lonely.""They were going on and on about NOTES for a while.  Then one of the grandchildren said, ""The character was a old spinster. If she had ghosts sitting with her they would have been students.""  Everybody laughed. That was it.  My aunts felt super-good after that.  They felt they had given to their large families and many loves so they had a right to be tired but never lonely.  There is too much in their memory banks for that.  And, one of the aunts added,""I never thought that the high variety I've had in my life, you know--the stuff some people call promiscuity...would ever come to good use in my life but it has.  I am not Barbara, thank the Lord.""  That character really threw them for a loop.Then they got on the issue of sex, lesbianism and loneliness. They liked this movie and will likely look at it again and again over the years.  Judi got them good.  They can't get over it.  They each said they have felt lonely lying next to the man they loved.  They've felt lonely holding their own child. They said loneliness will visit at anytime including when one is alone.  And, they said it is definitely a good life skill to learn how to enjoy one's self with one's self, all by one's self.  It is good to learn how to have a good time no matter what.That left lesbianism. My aunts are not against gays but they think even gay people would agree that they don't like the stereotype that when one is alone one is desperate and obsessive.My aunts concluded that the script was missing something. The script didn't tell us about Barbara's past.  Was she a gay lover when she was young?  Had she ever had a gay life or was she simply looking for a young woman to be her friend or was she trying to replace her cat or was she trying to do some mothering.  (Mothers can be obsessive too you know.)  Or, she could have been off-the-track and obsessive.Both my aunts like to journal.  That freaked them out too.

Both of the lead characters are the kind of pitiful souls whose lives are mistaken for ""entertainment"" by the producers of the kinds of shows where people cuss and hit one another with chairs while subtitles inform the viewer ""Her Boyfriend Slept With Every Female In Her Family"".  The appearance of two of the most talented English actresses on earth in these two roles lends enough respectability to make the result watchable for folks like me who keep the channel-changer flipping when we go past Jerry Springer.Dame Judi Dench plays Barbara, the kind of crusty old high school teacher who can quiet a brewing teenage mob with the raise of an eyebrow.  The students think she's a tough old battle-axe of a biddy, and her colleagues do too, but she thinks she enjoys a certain amount of respect because she demonstrates repeatedly that she's just plain smarter than everyone else.  She began teaching years ago with idealism, but now she thinks her job is ""crowd control"".Cate Blanchett plays Sheba, the new art teacher who took some time off to find herself before joining the working force.  She is new at the school and the students take advantage of her when they sense her fear.  Sheba has long been married to Bill Nighy, another free spirit.  Together they share a Downs syndrome son and a typical teenaged daughter.Barb finds herself inexplicably drawn to Sheba, who is one of the only colleagues in years to express anything approaching friendship towards her.  Barb breaks up a fight that Sheba has let get out of hand, then Barb begins a vivid fantasy life where she begins to imagine herself and Sheba as companions.Barb's fantasy is rocked when she spies Sheba in a sexual encounter with one of the fifteen year old students.The rest of the movie could have been sub-standard made-for-television fare, but Dench and Blanchett elevate the material from tabloid fodder to compelling Shakespearean-level tragedy.Both of the characters are more than a little unhinged.

Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Notes On A Scandal packs action, intrigue, secrets and outstanding acting into a dramatic thriller to keep you keenly interested, to say the least. It's an excellent film; the script and acting combine to draw you into the plot, making you care about the characters to a degree that you normally don't. The choreography shines bright in crowd scenes and the scenes filmed inside the school; and the cinematography lacks nothing whatsoever. Notes On A Scandal is powerful; and it's not for the faint of heart nor is it a ""family"" film.When the action begins, we quickly meet both Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) and Barbara Covett (Dame Judi Dench) who work at Saint George's School somewhere in England. Sheba is a new art teacher; and her youth and inexperience show through pretty clearly when the rather astute Barbara easily sizes her up. We also come to see that Barbara is a pretty tough cookie at the school who teaches no nonsense history classes. Barbara leads a rather lonely life since her last relationship with a woman named Jennifer ended; she lives with her old cat in an apartment and keeps a diary with lengthy entries and gold stars pasted into the diary as well. In addition, Barbara has her eyes on Sheba as a possible romantic interest although no one in the school is aware of this.Sheba, trying to be friendly and fit in with her new colleagues, invites Barbara over to her home for lunch one Sunday afternoon. Barbara meets Sheba's family: her older husband Richard (Bill Nighy), her daughter Polly (Juno Temple) and Sheba's son Ben (Max Lewis) who has Down's Syndrome. At first Barbara isn't completely sure how to approach Sheba to trap her for her own; but one night Barbara accidentally witnesses Sheba and a student named Steven Connolly (Andrew Simpson) sharing romantic time together. Barbara gets Sheba to confess all to her; Barbara now has all the information she needs to be able to bully, manipulate and possibly even blackmail Sheba into a more romantic relationship with her instead of Steven or her husband Richard.The plot thickens. Although Sheba tries hard to end it with Steven; Steven won't take no for an answer and Barbara feels threatened and angry with Sheba for ""betraying"" her. Moreover, when Sheba goes to her son Ben's play instead of the vet where Barbara's cat is dying, Barbara looses her cool and finds a way to let another person from the school know that Sheba and Steven are a pair.What will this all bring? So far, Sheba's husband, Barbara, Steven and even the man from the school all want a romantic relationship with Sheba. Who will Sheba choose--and what price will Sheba pay for having relations with an underage student? What about Barbara--does she find a way to force Sheba to give in and experience a romance with her? Will Sheba ever be able to tell Barbara off or get even with her? Watch and find out!The DVD boasts some excellent extras. I particularly liked the ""behind the scenes"" featurette; and we get an optional running commentary by director Richard Eyre. There is another bonus entitled In Character with Cate Blanchett.Notes On A Scandal reaches out to grab your attention from the word go and it never lets you go until the end.

A friendship is formed between the two women, but Barbara ends up saying unkind things about Sheba in the back of her mind. Sheba then ends up having a forbidden sexual affair with a 15-year old student named Steven Connolly (played by Andrew Simpson). After a while, the affair gets out of hand to where the boy's mother finds out about it, and then Sheba gets heat from her husband and daughter, and Barbara gets heat from the school headmaster for not doing anything to stop the affair. As the story unfolds, we learn that Barbara is not a good friend for Sheba. We also find out that Barbara had a failed friendship with a woman who left the school because of her.

645868,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JP63,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[2, 2]","To say how good this movie actually is, the following morning I was stood outside a bookshop, before it even opened at 9am, so I could go inside and get the book that this was based on. What shocked me as well, is that I'd picked up the book before, when it had a different cover and thought it sounded interesting, but put it down as I didn't have enough money at the time.I knew nothing previously about this film (apart from having a brief glance at the book months ago), so was quite surprised when Judi Dench's character, Barbara, started playing with a strand of Sheba's hair (Cate Blanchett), and I rightly guessed men didn't do it for her. The wonderful thing about this movie is that Judi Dench gets a bigger role than anything else that I've seen her in, and it's a totally different character than what she normally plays. She's a bitter, jaded, twisted, manipulative, lonely old woman, and my heart actually went out to the character. The rest of the teaching staff shuns her, until a pretty young teacher comes along, and actually speaks to Barbara.This is Sheba, the young teacher, with a teenage daughter, a Down's Syndrome son, and an older husband, played by Bill Nighy. Barbara ends up attaching herself to Sheba, in an almost obsessive way, until the family is fed up of her, except Sheba, who puts up with her.Sheba ends up having a fling with one of the students, and Barbara catches them, which makes her blackmail Sheba, so she can get it for herself, and wrestle her away from her family. Sheba's life falls in tatters around her feet, secretly abetted by Barbara. Some friend huh?All the actors throw themselves into the roles, although I do think Bill Nighy really didn't come into his own until towards the end of the movie, including a shocking revelation that a similar thing happened with him & Sheba. The film also revolves around every teenage boy's fantasy, to possibly have an older woman interested in him. Even more so a teacher. (I didn't have any hot male teachers when I was at school, in fact they were all old!)I think Judi Dench deserves some major recognition for doing this role so well. You do actually forget you're watching Judi Dench, as she makes her advances towards Sheba, and continuously writes in her diary. She could have delivered this role as a mad spinster (she does have a cat), but instead, I found myself feeling sorry for her. Her diary writings are told in voiceover, with one great line being: ""The opera has begun and I have a front-row seat."" The scene in the bathtub, where she sits quietly and smokes one of many cigarettes conveys the desperate loneliness of Barbara's life, and what it has become.This is a powerful story, ready to shock, and deliver the goods, without missing a beat along the way.

Sheba turns to a randy fifteen year old student and Barbara turns her attentions to Sheba.Writer Patrick Marber (""Closer""), adapting a Zo Heller novel, has set up a scenario in which Barbara is the hunter and Sheba is the prey and what makes this situation particularly interesting is that Barbara's intention are not wholly, if at all, homosexual in intention.

And so the hunter snags her prey...or so she thinks.Though Sheba's motivations are murky, Barbara's are not: she wants to control, ensnare and covet Sheba and Dench's performance is spot on: she's full of rage, she's smart, she's conniving and she is a lot crazy.""Notes on a Scandal"" is good melodrama performed to the hilt by two of our finest actresses and written and directed with wit and perception.

Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) is the new art teacher at a London high school, an attractive, reserved woman eager for life after caring for her handicapped son for a decade. Barbara Covett (Judi Dench) is a sharp-tongued veteran history teacher, liked by no one but formidable to all. When Barbara discovers Sheba's affair with a 15-year-old student (Andrew Simpson), the older teacher promises to keep Sheba's secret. At the price of Sheba's devoted friendship. Relieved, Sheba obliges but fatally underestimates Barbara's cunning and possessiveness.""Notes on a Scandal""'s greatest allure is Barbara's wicked narration as she commits her secrets to the pages of her diary. It begins as sharp, startlingly frank observations of the people around her and becomes a testament to her delusion and cruelty. The wooden quality that has its share of critics is wholly absent from Judi Dench's performance here. Barbara is desperately lonely and intensely passionate in her own warped way. Dench is a powerhouse of manipulative menace. Cate Blanchett's ethereal grace is perfectly suited to the frustrated ""bourgeois bohemian"" Sheba. The first hour of ""Notes on a Scandal"" is a masterpiece of character drama. The last third veers toward melodrama, which broke the spell for me. Philip Glass' Oscar-nominated score may stand well on its own, but it does little more than punctuate the drama in the film. I found the score, like the story, overwrought in the last half hour.

As for the film, I was laughing a lot throughout it.  The character Barbara's lines are so over-the-top in their ridiculousness that I don't see how anyone could take this film seriously.  About a half-hour into the film I found myself thinking how this is a future camp classic, something that catty drag queens will be quoting to their friends for the next few generations.As for the score by Phillip Glass, I must confess that before I started to appreciate this film because of its humor I was annoyed by the score.  Not only is it typical, repetitive Phillip Glass music but it also seemed at odds with the story during some scenes.  Then the dinner party scene occurred:  During what is a basically restrained conversation, the music is extremely loud and urgent.  My annoyance at the score turned into admiration for the director for his brilliant decision to hire Glass to do the score.  Surely he was in on the joke I was perceiving, too, and was trying to create a more mainstream version of an early John Waters film.  If not, how else to explain all of this film's excesses?Who knew that a film about a pedophile teacher and a dangerously crazy, lonely, old woman could bring so much laughter?As a comedy I would give this 4.5 stars.  As a drama I would give it 2 stars.

She is not liked by the other faculty members, but she has been at the school for a long time (she's on the cusp of retirement) and the kids fear/respect her. Enter Sheba (Blanchette), the young, beautiful, wispy new art teacher. Barbara, who's looking for a way to end her solitude, strikes up a friendship with Sheba.As the story unfolds, we begin to suspect that Barbara is angling for much more than friendship with the pretty new instructor. And when Barbara discovers that Sheba is engaging in a love affair with a 15-year-old student, she is at first angry, and then devilishly delighted, as she can use the secret to further enmesh herself in the life of her new ""friend.""Barbara is one of the best characters I've seen on the screen in a while. First of all, she's our narrator, so we are privy to her innermost thoughts (which can be arresting, abhorrent, understandable, etc., at different points in the film). She's cunning. She's deperately lonely. She's almost parasitic in her need for ""companionship."" She is a woman of action. And Dench plays her fully, with a truth, a roundness, and a believability that one rarely sees in anti-heros.And, not incidentally, Barbara is a woman of a certain age. It is refreshing and wonderful to see such a vibrant character written for a woman old enough to retire. There aren't enough parts like this out there for older, more accomplished actresses. Blanchette is amazing to watch in this, but Dench truly steals the show.As the viewer, you begin to sense what is coming. And yet, it is fascinating to see all the strands of the web come together as the end of the film nears. The score is also very cleverly used to heighten this effect.

The way the suspense was building, I thought we were going to see Judi Dench get all ""Fatal Attraction"" on us...But that didn't really happen.  Judi did a great job in portraying Barbara's visceral loneliness.  but c'mon, other than trying to force the woman to sit with her and dying cat-what did she do that was so terrible?  She didn't encourage Sheba to keep seeing the young boy so she could have something over her head.  She kept insisting the woman end the affair.  So she snitched on a CRIMINAL act.  Big deal!  She should have.  Her mistake was not hiding the diaries once the woman was living in her house.  I suspect that novel went a little deeper on Barbara's obsession and maybe I'll check it out.

645879,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00005JP63,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[13, 16]","Notes on a Scandal is a decently scripted, nicely filmed melodrama, lifted by a great performance from Judi Dench, who manages her character's gentle arc from lonely old battleaxe to psychotic nutcase well - though it remained, over the whole course of the film, too easy to empathise with Barbara: when she should have been approaching skin-crawling territory: the literate and dryly delivered bon mots of Barbara's diary, and her gentle allusions to Virginia Woolf, didn't wane and she remained the hero rather than the anti-hero. Perhaps she was intended to be, and I missed the point. But someone certainly did - when it should have been chiming, too frequently Notes on a Scandal clanged.Chief culprit was the screenplay. I've not read Zoe Heller's book, but I found Cate Blanchett's character, Bathsheba, was altogether troublesome. For one thing, the traditional archetype requires some personal imbalance that sets a character off on the plot revealed by the story. Something needs to be missing, or off-key, in the character's day-to-day life. But with Bathsheba, nothing is: She has a loving (older) husband with whom she seems to share a great relationship with her children, including an apparently happy, affectionate and non-demanding boy with Down's syndrome. As if to demonstrate this (and what other point would such a contrivance have?) the whole family dances cheerily and un-self-consciously after a first Sunday lunch with Barbara.Therefore there is no obvious reason for Bathsheba to embark on her fateful voyage - a well-adjusted, happy wife and mother just spontaneously implodes.Later, Sheba complains of the pressures of having raised a handicapped son for a decade, but we never *see* any such difficulty (indeed, Sheba's husband seems to be his primary care-giver), and it does not credibly explain why she would suddenly take a job as an inner-city comprehensive art teacher (not exactly a palliative for difficult child-rearing!) nor how adultery by means of statutory rape, apparently within weeks of commencing the job, would make things any better.If it is difficult to credit her motivation for that, it's difficult to buy anything else about her character, and as the movie rolled on the less I was engaged by Cate Blanchett's striking looks and uncanny ability to look vulnerable but alluring at the same time, and the more I felt Bathsheba was just an irrational bimbo who got what was coming to her.But then the problem becomes: what is this film trying to achieve? What is it trying to say? Barbara battles on: she grows ever more spooky the more we learn about her, but ultimately she undergoes no permanent change: she has learned nothing, suffered nothing, and we leave her exactly as we found her, sitting on her park bench, Hannibal Lecter-like, as if she were sitting down to have her next old friend for dinner.Once again, Bill Nighy (who appears to have secured some sort of monopoly on playing irascible old buzzards in British Cinema) holds the fort but despite a good effort fails to persuade in a straight role, not helped by the lack of coherence in his part's characterisation. Being confused as to why Bathsheba stuffed everything up in the first place, he becomes confused as to what to do with her afterwards, and pretty much capitulates and lets her do what she likes.Certainly an intriguing night out, but I found Notes on a Scandal failed to clear any of my credibility hurdles.Olly Buxton",3,Nice performances from a drama that doesn't ring true,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,3448,"['Notes', 'Scandal', 'decently', 'scripted', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'melodrama', 'lifted', 'great', 'performance', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'character', 'gentle', 'arc', 'lonely', 'old', 'battleaxe', 'psychotic', 'nutcase', 'well', 'remained', 'whole', 'course', 'film', 'too', 'easy', 'empathise', 'Barbara', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'approaching', 'skin-crawling', 'territory', 'literate', 'dryly', 'delivered', 'bon', 'mots', 'Barbara', 'diary', 'gentle', 'allusions', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'did', ""n't"", 'wane', 'remained', 'hero', 'rather', 'anti-hero', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'missed', 'point', 'someone', 'certainly', 'did', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'chiming', 'too', 'frequently', 'Scandal', 'clanged.Chief', 'culprit', 'was', 'screenplay', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'Zoe', 'Heller', 'book', 'found', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'Bathsheba', 'was', 'altogether', 'troublesome', 'one', 'thing', 'traditional', 'archetype', 'personal', 'imbalance', 'character', 'off', 'plot', 'revealed', 'story', 'Something', 'needs', 'be', 'missing', 'off-key', 'character', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'Bathsheba', 'nothing', 'loving', 'older', 'husband', 'whom', 'share', 'great', 'relationship', 'children', 'including', 'apparently', 'happy', 'affectionate', 'non-demanding', 'boy', 'Down', 'syndrome', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'other', 'point', 'would', 'such', 'contrivance', 'have', 'whole', 'family', 'dances', 'cheerily', 'un-self-consciously', 'first', 'Sunday', 'lunch', 'Barbara.Therefore', 'obvious', 'reason', 'Bathsheba', 'embark', 'fateful', 'voyage', 'well-adjusted', 'happy', 'wife', 'mother', 'just', 'spontaneously', 'implodes.Later', 'Sheba', 'pressures', 'having', 'raised', 'handicapped', 'son', 'decade', 'never', '*see*', 'such', 'difficulty', 'indeed', 'Sheba', 'husband', 'be', 'primary', 'care-giver', 'not', 'credibly', 'explain', 'why', 'would', 'suddenly', 'take', 'job', 'inner-city', 'comprehensive', 'art', 'teacher', 'not', 'exactly', 'palliative', 'difficult', 'child-rearing', 'how', 'adultery', 'means', 'statutory', 'rape', 'apparently', 'weeks', 'commencing', 'job', 'would', 'make', 'things', 'better.If', 'difficult', 'credit', 'motivation', 'difficult', 'buy', 'anything', 'else', 'character', 'movie', 'rolled', 'less', 'was', 'engaged', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'striking', 'looks', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'look', 'vulnerable', 'alluring', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'felt', 'Bathsheba', 'was', 'just', 'irrational', 'bimbo', 'who', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'her.But', 'then', 'problem', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'achieve', 'What', 'trying', 'say', 'Barbara', 'ever', 'more', 'spooky', 'more', 'learn', 'ultimately', 'permanent', 'change', 'learned', 'nothing', 'suffered', 'nothing', 'leave', 'exactly', 'found', 'sitting', 'park', 'bench', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter-like', 'were', 'sitting', 'down', 'have', 'next', 'old', 'friend', 'dinner.Once', 'again', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'have', 'secured', 'sort', 'monopoly', 'playing', 'irascible', 'old', 'buzzards', 'British', 'Cinema', 'fort', 'good', 'effort', 'fails', 'persuade', 'straight', 'role', 'not', 'helped', 'lack', 'coherence', 'part', 'characterisation', 'Being', 'confused', 'why', 'Bathsheba', 'stuffed', 'everything', 'up', 'first', 'place', 'confused', 'what', 'do', 'afterwards', 'pretty', 'much', 'capitulates', 'do', 'what', 'likes.Certainly', 'intriguing', 'night', 'out', 'found', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'failed', 'clear', 'credibility', 'hurdles.Olly', 'Buxton']",Notes on a Scandal

There has to be something to make the risk that she takes worthwhile.  Whatever it could be I didn't see it.

Lou LumenickJudi Dench gives a wonderful performance, without make-up, too tightly curled short hair and wrinkles a'plenty. She plays Barbara, a lesbian schoolteacher. She is both the villain and the narrator of this film.  She had a relationship with another teacher the year before which ended badly. Lonely and lonesome except for her cat- she is looking for someone to love.When Sheba, a new art teacher comes to school, Barbara sets her sights on her. Sheba, played by Cate Blanchett, is married to a man twently years her senior and has a 16 year old daughter and a 12 year old son with Downs' Syndrome. This is Sheba's first year as a teacher, and Barbara makes her a friend.  Barbara unexpectedly finds Sheba giving oral sex to a young student, and now Barabara understands she has Sheba right where she wants her. She encourages Sheba to gove up this young man, and she will say nothing. Sheba and Barbara become friends of a sort.Sheba's young man will not end the affair and Sheba has no willpower. Barbara learns of this  just before her beloved cat becomes terminally ill. Sheba makes a decision to attend her son's play rather than accompany Barbara to see her dead cat.  This mistake has consequences.The performances are powerful and this is what makes this film so grand. Bill Nighy as Sheba's husband is superb, as always.  However, it is Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett who make the world go round.  Cate Blanchett is marvelous as the young woman with desires and love of family and dark secrets.""If you want to see explosive acting, just watch Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett ignite in this film version of Zoe Heller's 2003 novel.

They absolutely complemented each other - neither one taking anything away from the other's performance.The story revolves around two female school teachers, one, hopelessly involved with one of her students, the other, hopelessly involved with the other teacher.  It is also a rather scathing look at the dark side of love.An even more interesting observation is that quite frankly, neither character was a sympathetic one.  Cate's character, Sheba, was less so simply because she knew better - to become sexually involved with one of your students is simply exercising very poor judgement.  Moreover, there was no real indication why she allowed/needed this to happen - there was no real issue in her marriage to support her having an affair. Somehow her revelation that the marriage was ""somewhat boring"" is, unfortunately not even remotely sufficient enough to understand/explain her behavior...(her son had Downs Syndrome, for godsakes....)Judi's character, Barbara,  began as somewhat sympathetic until she decided to use her friend's secret to her advantage - all in the name of love.  Even after learning of the unfortunate demise of a similar relationship, this does not at all excuse her vindictive, obsessive actions.The emotional rollercoaster provided here was certainly enough to keep one interested in what happens to these two women.However, the real prize is watching these two wonderful actresses bring such a tenuous situation to film.

645889,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00005JP63,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 1]","I was looking forward to this film for the sheer treat of having Judy Dench and Cate Blanchett act together.  This film is interesting exploration on human relationships, desires and hurt humans are capable on inflicting to each other.  We encouter Sheeba, new high school teacher who seems to have it all: she is married, beautiful and artistic with a possibility of starting a new teaching career after staying at home to raise her son.  But then, we learn that her life is not a perfect one: she is married to an older man and the intensity of their relationship is wearing off with her.  Her teenage daughter has typical teenage problems (boyfriend anyone?), while her son requires constant attention due to his Down Syndrome.  In all that pressure, Sheeba succumbs to the seemingly worry free relationship with the high school student - young, handsome and amazingly manipulative.  And as these events are unrevelling, Judy Dench's character seems to see an end to her loneliness.  Under pretense to be a friend, comforting colleague on her slippery slope of self-destruction, she is naively plotting to lure Sheeba into relationshiop, only to find out that feelings are one sided.  And that is here is all falls to pieces.  I would say that while seemingly unremarkable, this is a true story of everyday people's lives.  It is  a true description of all of our transgressions and how easy it is for all of us to find justificaitons for our own actions. Also the moral of the story - if you are looking to confide to anyone, find a good psychotherapist, your friends and colleagues will find a way to ""jump"" you for all the petty reasons they can come up with should you be foolish enough to confide to them.",4,Friendship redefined,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,1713,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'sheer', 'treat', 'having', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'act', 'together', 'film', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'human', 'relationships', 'desires', 'hurt', 'humans', 'are', 'capable', 'inflicting', 'other', 'encouter', 'Sheeba', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'have', 'married', 'beautiful', 'artistic', 'possibility', 'starting', 'new', 'teaching', 'career', 'staying', 'home', 'raise', 'son', 'then', 'learn', 'life', 'not', 'perfect', 'one', 'married', 'older', 'man', 'intensity', 'relationship', 'wearing', 'off', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'typical', 'teenage', 'problems', 'boyfriend', 'anyone', 'son', 'constant', 'attention', 'due', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'pressure', 'Sheeba', 'seemingly', 'worry', 'free', 'relationship', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'young', 'handsome', 'amazingly', 'manipulative', 'events', 'are', 'unrevelling', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'character', 'see', 'end', 'loneliness', 'pretense', 'be', 'friend', 'comforting', 'colleague', 'slippery', 'slope', 'self-destruction', 'naively', 'plotting', 'lure', 'Sheeba', 'relationshiop', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'feelings', 'are', 'one', 'sided', 'here', 'falls', 'pieces', 'would', 'say', 'seemingly', 'unremarkable', 'true', 'story', 'everyday', 'people', 'lives', 'true', 'description', 'transgressions', 'how', 'easy', 'find', 'justificaitons', 'own', 'actions', 'Also', 'moral', 'story', 'are', 'looking', 'confide', 'anyone', 'find', 'good', 'psychotherapist', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'jump', 'petty', 'reasons', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'foolish', 'enough', 'confide']",Notes on a Scandal
645890,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00005JP63,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[11, 12]","""Notes on a Scandal"" stars Judi Dench as Barbara Covett, a lonely self-proclaimed ""battleaxe"" who teaches history at St. George's. When her attention is caught by the inexperienced teaching novice Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett), Barbara is delighted that she's found a new ""friend"" - until she learns of the younger woman's affair with a fifteen-year-old pupil, and decides to blackmail Sheba into a situation somewhat more involved than simple friendship.Directed by Richard Eyre, this surprisingly taut and fast-paced drama feels like much more than its 92 minutes (in the best possible sense) - Dench and Blanchett are to be congratulated on their completely absorbing characterisation and strength of performance. Blanchett's amazing in her role as the spineless, weak-willed Sheba Hart: here is a character guilty of both an extramarital affair and statutory rape, and yet Blanchett's skill as an actress keeps us from being completely alienated from Sheba Harte - on the contrary, there are scenes where we begin to pity her.Dench is, as you'd expect, completely brilliant in her role as insular, hard-edged Barbara Covett. Devoid of pretty much all glamour, Dench's immersion in her character makes for the most convincing of performances: her terse cruelty in describing Sheba's children or her overweight co-workers is thrown into higher contrast by her palpable grief at the death of her beloved cat Portia. But it's in the scenes where Barbara tries to take control of Sheba's situation that Dench shines brightest, and we're completely in the thrall of this miserable, lonely, manipulative old woman whose delusional sense of love leads her to destroy her only friend.Strong supporting cast nods go to Bill Nighy as Sheba's bohemian husband Richard, and to the excellent Andrew Simpson as underage Romeo Steven Connolly, and Richard Eyre's superlative direction comes to the fore in the violent, claustrophobic scenes of domestic dispute, or the floaty, dreamlike quality in the school scenes, mirroring Sheba's lust for her pupil or Barbara's infatuation with her colleague.Direction and performances combine with an insanely clever use of music in the soundtrack to lock us in and keep us hurtling forward towards the film's chilling conclusion, and, like I said before, these 92 minutes will seem like longer - we feel like we've run a marathon along with these women. ""Notes on a Scandal"" is a superlative drama, and one that you won't be sorry you saw. It handles so many uncomfortable issues - like loneliness, internalised homophobia, obsession, statutory rape and extramarital sex - with such deft ambiguity and fluid confidence (as well as a perfectly pitched sense of humour) that you won't want it to end. This is a film that reminds me why I love films, it's just that good.If Helen Mirren's given the Best Actress performance of the year in ""The Queen"" (another outstanding film, yes, but it's a huge shame that ""Notes on a Scandal"" is only on limited release), Dench is overlooked completely: she's easily the equal of Mirren and she has more ample support here, both before and behind the camera.I can't recommend this movie highly enough, go and see it quickly before it disappears from theatres.",5,Riveting,1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,3221,"['Notes', 'Scandal', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'lonely', 'self-proclaimed', 'battleaxe', 'who', 'history', 'St.', 'George', 'When', 'attention', 'caught', 'inexperienced', 'teaching', 'novice', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Barbara', 'delighted', 'found', 'new', 'friend', 'younger', 'woman', 'affair', 'fifteen-year-old', 'pupil', 'blackmail', 'Sheba', 'situation', 'somewhat', 'more', 'involved', 'simple', 'friendship.Directed', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'surprisingly', 'taut', 'fast-paced', 'drama', 'feels', 'much', 'more', '92', 'minutes', 'best', 'possible', 'sense', 'Dench', 'Blanchett', 'are', 'be', 'congratulated', 'completely', 'absorbing', 'characterisation', 'strength', 'performance', 'Blanchett', 'amazing', 'role', 'spineless', 'weak-willed', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'here', 'character', 'guilty', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'statutory', 'rape', 'yet', 'Blanchett', 'skill', 'actress', 'being', 'completely', 'alienated', 'Sheba', 'Harte', 'contrary', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'begin', 'pity', 'her.Dench', ""'d"", 'expect', 'completely', 'brilliant', 'role', 'insular', 'hard-edged', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'Devoid', 'pretty', 'much', 'glamour', 'Dench', 'immersion', 'character', 'most', 'convincing', 'performances', 'terse', 'cruelty', 'describing', 'Sheba', 'children', 'overweight', 'co-workers', 'thrown', 'higher', 'contrast', 'palpable', 'grief', 'death', 'beloved', 'cat', 'Portia', 'scenes', 'where', 'Barbara', 'take', 'control', 'Sheba', 'situation', 'Dench', 'brightest', ""'re"", 'completely', 'thrall', 'miserable', 'lonely', 'manipulative', 'old', 'woman', 'delusional', 'sense', 'love', 'destroy', 'only', 'friend.Strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'nods', 'go', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Sheba', 'bohemian', 'husband', 'Richard', 'excellent', 'Andrew', 'Simpson', 'underage', 'Romeo', 'Steven', 'Connolly', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'superlative', 'direction', 'fore', 'violent', 'claustrophobic', 'scenes', 'domestic', 'dispute', 'floaty', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'school', 'scenes', 'mirroring', 'Sheba', 'lust', 'pupil', 'Barbara', 'infatuation', 'colleague.Direction', 'performances', 'combine', 'insanely', 'clever', 'use', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'lock', 'keep', 'hurtling', 'forward', 'film', 'chilling', 'conclusion', 'said', '92', 'minutes', 'will', 'seem', 'longer', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'run', 'marathon', 'women', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'superlative', 'drama', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'saw', 'so', 'many', 'uncomfortable', 'issues', 'loneliness', 'internalised', 'homophobia', 'obsession', 'statutory', 'rape', 'extramarital', 'sex', 'such', 'deft', 'ambiguity', 'fluid', 'confidence', 'as', 'well', 'perfectly', 'pitched', 'sense', 'humour', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'film', 'why', 'love', 'films', 'just', 'good.If', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'given', 'Best', 'Actress', 'performance', 'year', 'Queen', 'outstanding', 'film', 'yes', 'huge', 'shame', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'only', 'limited', 'release', 'Dench', 'overlooked', 'completely', 'easily', 'equal', 'Mirren', 'more', 'ample', 'support', 'here', 'camera.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough', 'go', 'see', 'quickly', 'theatres']",Notes on a Scandal

Williams ""just an avid reader""","[6, 7]","In a summer filled with movies, this stands out as an interesting and worthwhile one to watch.Not only is the underlying novel well done, making both the plot and character development well above your average movie watching fare, but the questions raised and the dilemmas posed could have sprung out of today's newspaper headlines.The plot is, at this point in history, an all to familar one. Pretty, young teacher has affair with male high school student, ruining both her life and career. It's this interesting double sexual standard we seem to have with regards to statutory rape, the older male is a leecher and pervert, his lover seduced and not responsible, the older female is oddly misguided and her younger lover-lucky to be introduced to sex by an older more experienced woman. But we never seem to question motives or try to understand them, it is just too obvious that the older male is a child rapist and sexual pervert and the older female just confused.But the movie is far more than just a 35 year old married mother having sex with a 15 year old boy, it is the story of another seduction, an older woman manipulating conditions and worming her way into the life of the younger, a story of two lonely women. The primary thread is the women's story, the secondary one- the teacher and her pupil.  It is told as a first person narrative, in the voice of Judi Dench, the older women. She is one of those rare actresses who has continued to have excellent roles as she matures and ages, in the midst of a culture that honors only youth, especially in women. She is too, one of those rare actresses, who despite being well know to her audience, through pure strength of acting skill manages to make you believe that she really is an old teacher nearly ready to retire, leaving you wondering how she could have fit that career into a life  filled with the stage and films.Her face and manner brighten the film and when posed next to Cate Blanchett's make a comparison of their ages and outward beauty obvious, yet she is still literally beautiful inside despite the thinning gray hair and deeply furred face. From the first moment of the film, where you see her writing in her constantly at hand journal, moving to the shelf with literally hundreds of thin different colored journals, representing a long and literary life, to the very end on the park bench overlooking the city, where she has sat with several young women and now sits with a new victim, she dominates the movie and her voice fills your head as she narrates her life for us.I usually complain of too much sex or too explicit scenes or too much female physical exposure in the movies. This is the first time i can remember thinking that there was not enough explicit physical contact between the lovers. Something is lacking in the motivation of Blanchett's character to balance out all she has to loose with her affair with the male student. It needs to show a bit more passion, a bit more fleshly lust, mostly just hinted at here. This would make her betrayal of husband, family, school, career, and the law a bit more easy to swallow if she really was swept off her feet and thrown into the arms of fullfilled lust with a 15 year old. but this is just a small grip.But the theme is loneliness, what it does to these two people, how it transforms and breaks their souls and their lives. The elder is a psychic vampire, consciously seducing and worming into the confidence and life of the younger, the younger a lost and tormented soul who despite being a good wife, a good mother to her down's child and a decent artist then an art teacher (these are her words in the movie) craves for more excitement, more passion, more aliveness. To be manipulated into the grips of the elder woman, who uses her affair to steer her life's affairs in the way Judi Dench wishes them to go, rather than any way she (Cate Blanchett's character) could ever imagine or desired, is to be caught up in an extraordinary and well laid spider's web.It is interesting, leaves much to think about, doesn't even try to answer many of the why did she questions it proposes. But it challenges several of the common societal ideas we have about both older-younger sexual relations with both man and women and women with women.

645895,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JP63,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","Movies don't come much more steamy, salacious and drama-packed than ""Notes on a Scandal,"" a gripping tale of manipulation and obsession that showcases two of the pinnacles of modern English acting, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett.In Patrick Marber's first-rate adaptation of the Zoe Heller novel, Dench plays Barbara Covett, a teacher at a London grade school who becomes emotionally and sexually attracted to Sheba Hart (Blanchett), a pretty new faculty member who is married to a much older man and has two children, one a young boy with Down Syndrome.  Slowly, almost inexorably, Barbara begins to insinuate herself into Sheba's life, patiently waiting for just that right moment or event to come along which will carry their relationship to the next crucial level.  It turns out that she hasn't long to wait, for Barbara soon discovers that Sheba is having a torrid affair with a 15-year-old boy at the school.  Armed with this information, Barbara is suddenly in the cat-bird seat in the relationship, all too willing to work her new-found levers of power on her ""victim,"" sincere in her belief that she will somehow be able to blackmail Sheba into loving her.What makes ""Notes on a Scandal"" such a fascinating drama is its ability to make us both despise and sympathize with the characters at one and the same time.  Both Barbara and Sheba act in ways that are highly immoral and despicable, yet we can also empathize to some extent with their motives for what they do.  In many ways, the two women are mirror images of one another in that they allow the voids in their lives to determine their actions.  Barbara's intense loneliness and inability to connect emotionally with others drive her to states of near-madness as she endeavors to manipulate Sheba in every area of her life.  Barbara confuses love with possession, and will stop at nothing to achieve her desired goal.Sheba is motivated by inner demons similar to the ones that haunt Barbara.  Even though Sheba (unlike Barbara) has a family, she still feels that that there is something ""missing"" in her life, a conviction that leaves her vulnerable first to the boy at school and eventually to Barbara's artful machinations.  And like Barbara, Sheba seems heedless of the possible devastating consequences of her actions - to herself, her family, her school and especially the young boy whose thrall she is in.  Through the two characters, the movie makes a compellingly ironic case that humans, in that ever-elusive desire to find ""happiness,"" act in ways that actually prevent us from ever achieving that happiness.The acting could not be better.  Dench brings such a calculated, icy demeanor to the character of Barbara that she holds the audience in total thrall for ninety emotionally exhausting minutes.  Yet, the actress also allows the vulnerable side of the character to come through - the part that cries over the loss of her beloved cat, or that sits alone in her bathtub contemplating the dark emptiness of her life.  Blanchett does the same with her character, making it clear to us how a woman with as much as she DOES have in her life can still act out in ways that are counterintuitive and downright deleterious to her security, reputation and marriage.Director Richard Eyre has drawn fine performances out of the rest of his cast as well, especially Bill Nighy as Sheba's husband and Andrew Simpson as her underage paramour.""Note on a Scandal"" is obviously dealing with some fairly heady issues here, but the intensity of the drama, the complexity of the characters and the quality of the performances make it a film no true movie lover can afford to miss.",4,Great acting in the service of a great story,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,3637,"['Movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'more', 'steamy', 'salacious', 'drama-packed', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'gripping', 'tale', 'manipulation', 'obsession', 'two', 'pinnacles', 'modern', 'English', 'acting', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Cate', 'Blanchett.In', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'first-rate', 'adaptation', 'Zoe', 'Heller', 'novel', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'teacher', 'London', 'grade', 'school', 'who', 'emotionally', 'sexually', 'attracted', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'Blanchett', 'pretty', 'new', 'faculty', 'member', 'who', 'married', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'two', 'children', 'one', 'young', 'boy', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'Slowly', 'almost', 'inexorably', 'Barbara', 'insinuate', 'Sheba', 'life', 'patiently', 'waiting', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'event', 'come', 'will', 'carry', 'relationship', 'next', 'crucial', 'level', 'out', ""n't"", 'long', 'wait', 'Barbara', 'soon', 'Sheba', 'having', 'torrid', 'affair', '15-year-old', 'boy', 'school', 'Armed', 'information', 'Barbara', 'suddenly', 'cat-bird', 'seat', 'relationship', 'too', 'willing', 'work', 'new-found', 'levers', 'power', 'victim', 'sincere', 'belief', 'will', 'somehow', 'be', 'able', 'blackmail', 'Sheba', 'loving', 'her.What', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'such', 'fascinating', 'drama', 'ability', 'make', 'despise', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'act', 'ways', 'are', 'highly', 'immoral', 'despicable', 'yet', 'can', 'also', 'empathize', 'extent', 'motives', 'what', 'do', 'many', 'ways', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'mirror', 'images', 'one', 'allow', 'voids', 'lives', 'determine', 'actions', 'Barbara', 'intense', 'loneliness', 'inability', 'connect', 'emotionally', 'others', 'drive', 'states', 'near-madness', 'manipulate', 'Sheba', 'area', 'life', 'Barbara', 'love', 'possession', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'achieve', 'desired', 'goal.Sheba', 'motivated', 'inner', 'demons', 'similar', 'ones', 'haunt', 'Barbara', 'Even', 'Sheba', 'Barbara', 'family', 'still', 'something', 'missing', 'life', 'conviction', 'vulnerable', 'first', 'boy', 'school', 'eventually', 'Barbara', 'artful', 'machinations', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'heedless', 'possible', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'actions', 'herself', 'family', 'school', 'especially', 'young', 'boy', 'thrall', 'two', 'characters', 'movie', 'compellingly', 'ironic', 'case', 'humans', 'ever-elusive', 'desire', 'find', 'happiness', 'act', 'ways', 'actually', 'prevent', 'ever', 'achieving', 'happiness.The', 'acting', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'Dench', 'brings', 'such', 'calculated', 'icy', 'demeanor', 'character', 'Barbara', 'audience', 'total', 'thrall', 'ninety', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'minutes', 'actress', 'also', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'character', 'come', 'part', 'loss', 'beloved', 'cat', 'alone', 'bathtub', 'contemplating', 'dark', 'emptiness', 'life', 'Blanchett', 'same', 'character', 'making', 'clear', 'how', 'woman', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'life', 'can', 'still', 'act', 'out', 'ways', 'are', 'counterintuitive', 'downright', 'deleterious', 'security', 'reputation', 'marriage.Director', 'Richard', 'Eyre', 'drawn', 'fine', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Sheba', 'husband', 'Andrew', 'Simpson', 'underage', 'paramour', 'Note', 'Scandal', 'obviously', 'dealing', 'fairly', 'heady', 'issues', 'here', 'intensity', 'drama', 'complexity', 'characters', 'quality', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'true', 'movie', 'lover', 'can', 'afford', 'miss']",Notes on a Scandal

Luckily for screenwriter Patrick Marber, the genius casting of acting powerhouses Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett in his ""Notes On a Scandal"" amplifies it to classic status.From Zo Heller's hit source novel, the film is a gripping, thoroughly entertaining study of obsession and alienation. It flirts with some trite clich&eacute;s of the character-driven suspense genre, but in the hands of these actresses the averagely entertaining material takes a major upgrade.Dench is Barbara Covett, a schoolteacher close to retirement who rules her classroom with a heavy hand, but otherwise lives an empty life, referring to her calendar as an ""arctic wilderness."" She is respected by her colleagues, but they keep their distance from the intimidating eccentric. Barbara is thus drawn immediately to the lovely new art teacher Sheba Hart, portrayed by Blanchett; a fly to be lured unwittingly into the ever-growing web of Barbara's topsy-turvy fantasy world that is well-documented in her long-winded diary entries. Dench is, as always, spellbinding, even delivering a few comedic one-line zingers with finesse in this otherwise twisted tale. It is impossible to pay attention to anything else while she is onscreen.Barbara's inner dialogue sweeps the film along through its tight 90 minutes, revealing her disturbing preoccupation with Sheba, yet both she and her new friend remain unaware of the gravity of her mental roadblocks. They rise to the surface with a vengeance, however, when she catches Sheba committing a lewd act with an amorous 15 year-old named Patrick Connolly, played convincingly by Andrew Simpson. Shocked initially, she soon realizes her ability to exploit this vital information and take a position of power over her friend, nursing her own obsessions all the while.Blanchett shines playing a character that could have easily been overshadowed by the imposing Barbara. Marber succeeds in making Sheba more than just the eye of Barbara's storm of obsession, but Blanchett carries her over the threshold to the multi-faceted level. Sure, Sheba may seem to an extremely lucky woman - striking good looks, a faithful, loving husband, two wonderful children (albeit one in need of extra attention due to a mental handicap), a fulfilling job and lack of financial worry - but nothing in her life is the stuff of storybooks. Underneath her skin, pent-up passion yearns to spring free - but will this very passion prove her undoing?Both Barbara and Sheba have more in common than each other realizes. As Barbara demonstrates, playing cat and mouse is easy when you hold all the cards.

She's proven herself in almost any genre--comedy (The Life Aquatic), fantasy (Lord of the Ring), drama (The Aviator), experimental (Heaven), bad heist movie (Bandits)...and she always does a good job (and an outstanding job in The Aviator).  So you always know to expect something good from her.A lot of other people expect the same from Judi Dench--though I've never been convinced that she can play anything other than an older woman with a lot of confidence (like in the James Bond movies or in any film where she plays a queen).  Here, she's still playing the same character--this time it's a know-it-all school teacher, but it is a different role for her because she's not nearly as sophisticated as she thinks.The move itself is the story of a young teacher and an older teacher who was a crush on her.  When Dench catches Blanchett fooling around with a student, she has a means to blackmail her into the relationship she dreams of....It's a pretty offbeat premise, and it's an offbeat film, filled with dramatic moments, but plenty of droll humor.

Yarbrough""","[4, 4]","This GENIOUS story/movie can only be compared to such greats as Patricia Highsmith and Alfred Hitchcock when it comes to writing or film.  Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett are superb as two English school teachers caught up in a nasty affair.  Judi is a strict old maid named Barbara who narrates the story as entries into her journal.  She is desperate for love and soon becomes friends with Sheba (Blanchett), who is the new teacher in town who Barbara plans to seduce.However, Sheba is married with two kids, and soon begins an affair of her own with a 15 year old male student.  Barbara discovers the affair and uses it as blackmail to get closer to Sheba.  Shame on Sheba, right?  Not really.  By the time you learn of the affair Sheba is having with her student, you almost have entire sympathy for her as a character.  The fact that one of her kids has down syndrome certainly helps you to feel sorry for her as well.  She's so weak and fragile, but it's fun to watch Barbara the minx pounce on her like a little mouse, threatening to expose all if she doesn't get her way.There is one scene where Barbara forces Sheba to choose between getting in the car with her persistent family to go watch her son in his first school play, or accompany Barbara to see after her dying cat at the vet.  Barbara is in tears and hugs Sheba for comfort. The she throws her friendship with Sheba on the line and threatens to expose the affair right then and there to Sheba's husband.When she doesn't get her way, Barbara plants a bug in another teacher's ear and sits back to watch the fun begin.  Sheba is exposed.  Her marriage ruined.  She has no one to turn to except for...Barbara...who is right there waiting to comfort and console.  But, Sheba discovers Barbara's journals and her schemes are exposed.  Sheba goes mad!  Barbara is mad!  Someone must die, right?  Leave that to Hitchcock!  But you will be just as shocked!The haunting soundtrack from composer Philip Glass is just as mesmorizing as Dench and Blanchett in their roles.  Dench's quick tongue as a strict teacher, and in her journal entries, make for some great humor you will definitely appreciate.  She's a nasty lil character you'll grow to hate and love all at the same time, yet you'll be feeling sorry for her by the end.

645905,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B00005JP63,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[4, 5]","This film is noteworthy mainly for the bravura performances of its two leading actresses, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. Dench plays Barbara, an aged spinster schoolteacher replete with a dying cat, voluminous diaries, a witty contempt for her students and colleagues, unhappy memories of her earlier efforts at human connection, and a fear of spending her final days alone. Her latest, unsuitable target for a ""relationship"" to fill the void is a younger teacher, the inconveniently married and even more inconveniently adulterous ""middle-class bohemian,"" Sheba. Most of the film shows the skill with which Dench's Barbara uses sly wit and then chance to her advantage in spinning a web to entrap Blanchett's Sheba.Though the Patrick Marber screenplay is clearly a clever melodrama without deeper pretensions, it does allow Dench a role that strongly resembles in its demands one from tragedy, Iago's, and she plays it to the hilt. Seemingly improvised witty line readings, glee in her own sense of superiority to those ""simpletons"" she manipulates, and, above all, her luminous, tell-all facial expressions add up to great models of screen-acting.The principal shortcoming of this otherwise nearly perfect melodrama is the routine way in which the action is resolved. In a late plot development, notwithstanding her appropriately witty ripostes directed at her school's headmaster, Barbara still gets what feels like a very forced comeuppance. Equally lacking in persuasiveness is the cyclical final scene, an awfully convenient chance encounter played on a now overly familiar park bench.

645906,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JP63,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[37, 51]","The Amazon review probably tells more about the story than it should, so I'll not rehash the plot of the story and end up giving away even more here.  I'll just focus on the artistry of the film itself and how it takes wonderful actresses who play VERY unsympathetic roles and keeps us enthralled for 90 minutes (Amazon has it at 2 hours, but my rental copy ran only 92 minutes as noted on the American edition -- perhaps the British edition is longer).The story is horrific about a teacher justifying her lust for a 15 year old student entrusted in her care as ""okay"" simply because her marriage is ""dead"" (or more accurately, ""boring"").  One can't help but applaud another character in the story who notes ""can't you just wreck a marriage in the old-fashioned acceptable way with an affair with an adult?""  Well said.  A really sad note on all this is how unrepentant Blanchett's character is while at the same time knowing that what she did was completely wrong.  Yet, while knowing the relationship is wrong, she not only can't stop herself, but blames others should the secret get out that would send her to jail (as if they were doing something wrong turning her in).  Her comments of ""You could send me to jail if this gets out"" puts all the responsibility on others rather than where it belongs -- on her for her actions.Dench's character is equally disgusting in that everything that happens to her ""friend"" is always viewed as nothing but, in her own words, an ""opportunity.""  How sick and self-serving to use a 15 year old and a woman's innocent family to meet one's own desperate need to overcome loneliness.  It defies explanation, but Dench is such a great actress that we accept what she offers without further explanation.This film is absolutely compelling, chilling, and sadly very believable.  I was astonished that I could be so involved in a film that had no characters to really care about which is in direct contrast to how I felt withRunning With Scissorsin which not even decent acting could save that film as I was feeling too empty about the characters.  ""Notes"" clearly demonstrated to me that a quality film can be made involving despicable characters and in the film world that is a major achievement.UPDATE: In the comments section within this review I was called on the carpet for my, and others', initial misuse of the term ""pedophile"" when describing the teacher in this film.  I agree, in part, that I misused the term a bit then, and have since adjusted my review, as a true pedophile, by psychological terms, is one who desires sex with one prepubescent which is not the case in this film; however, both legally and in the hearts and minds of most individuals, sex with a minor of any age reeks of the elements associated with pedophilia, especially when it goes beyond one inappropriate impulsive incident and becomes a compulsion as it does in this story. The targeting of teenagers by adults for the purpose of sex IS deviant and wrong, and it's especially awful when a teacher, someone with authority over a minor, commits such an act. Therefore, spare me any more ""debate"" over whether this kids was abused or taken advantage of by the teacher in this story.For me personally, the splitting of hairs over whether this situation is a n example of true pedophilia based upon whether the child is 11 or 13 truly misses the point on the horrific nature of taking advantage of any underage youth, especially by a teacher.  I'm repulsed by those who have gone on to endlessly ""defend"" this teacher's actions in the film and have dismissed the situation as an over-reaction by religious conservatives or wish to quibble over the misuse of the term pedophilia.  I doubt these great defenders of ""free choice"" would feel this way if their son or daughter was having sex with his or her teacher whom they trusted to look out for their child's well-being.I also think it's extremely low and inappropriate to compare what happened in this film between an adult teacher and her 15 year old student and a case of rape, incest, or more appropriately accurate pedophilia relationship.  That is a disgusting effort to excuse a trusted teacher from her moral and professional duty to protect his or her students, no matter the age, from sexual abuse (whether the teenager ""consents"" or not) and attempts to devalue the abuse going on in this situation.  While I will admit that my anger and disgust level would be radically different if my own child was sexually taken advantage of at 8 in comparison to 15, that doesn't mean that a crime hasn't been committed, a moral violation hasn't happened, and that a professional misused the trust and authority given to him or her by his or her community.",4,Degenerate Characters Played by Top-Notch Actresses = Astonishing!,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,4720,"['Amazon', 'review', 'probably', 'more', 'story', 'should', 'so', ""'ll"", 'not', 'rehash', 'plot', 'story', 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'away', 'even', 'more', 'here', ""'ll"", 'just', 'focus', 'artistry', 'film', 'how', 'wonderful', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'VERY', 'unsympathetic', 'roles', 'enthralled', '90', 'minutes', 'Amazon', '2', 'hours', 'rental', 'copy', 'ran', 'only', '92', 'minutes', 'noted', 'American', 'edition', 'perhaps', 'British', 'edition', 'longer', '.The', 'story', 'horrific', 'teacher', 'justifying', 'lust', '15', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'entrusted', 'care', 'okay', 'simply', 'marriage', 'dead', 'more', 'accurately', 'boring', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'applaud', 'character', 'story', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'wreck', 'marriage', 'old-fashioned', 'acceptable', 'way', 'affair', 'adult', 'Well', 'said', 'A', 'really', 'sad', 'note', 'how', 'unrepentant', 'Blanchett', 'character', 'same', 'time', 'knowing', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'knowing', 'relationship', 'wrong', 'not', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'herself', 'others', 'should', 'secret', 'get', 'would', 'send', 'jail', 'were', 'doing', 'something', 'wrong', 'turning', 'comments', 'could', 'send', 'jail', 'out', 'responsibility', 'others', 'rather', 'where', 'actions.Dench', 'character', 'equally', 'disgusting', 'everything', 'friend', 'always', 'viewed', 'nothing', 'own', 'words', 'opportunity', 'How', 'sick', 'self-serving', 'use', '15', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'innocent', 'family', 'meet', 'one', 'own', 'desperate', 'need', 'overcome', 'loneliness', 'explanation', 'Dench', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'accept', 'what', 'further', 'explanation.This', 'film', 'absolutely', 'compelling', 'chilling', 'sadly', 'very', 'believable', 'was', 'astonished', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'involved', 'film', 'had', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'direct', 'contrast', 'how', 'felt', 'withRunning', 'Scissorsin', 'not', 'even', 'decent', 'acting', 'could', 'save', 'film', 'was', 'feeling', 'too', 'empty', 'characters', 'Notes', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'quality', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'involving', 'despicable', 'characters', 'film', 'world', 'major', 'achievement.UPDATE', 'comments', 'section', 'review', 'was', 'called', 'carpet', 'others', 'initial', 'misuse', 'term', 'pedophile', 'when', 'describing', 'teacher', 'film', 'agree', 'part', 'misused', 'term', 'bit', 'then', 'have', 'adjusted', 'review', 'true', 'pedophile', 'psychological', 'terms', 'one', 'who', 'sex', 'one', 'prepubescent', 'not', 'case', 'film', 'however', 'legally', 'hearts', 'minds', 'most', 'individuals', 'sex', 'minor', 'age', 'reeks', 'elements', 'associated', 'pedophilia', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'inappropriate', 'impulsive', 'incident', 'compulsion', 'story', 'targeting', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'purpose', 'sex', 'IS', 'deviant', 'wrong', 'especially', 'awful', 'when', 'teacher', 'someone', 'authority', 'minor', 'commits', 'act', 'Therefore', 'spare', 'more', 'debate', 'kids', 'was', 'abused', 'taken', 'advantage', 'teacher', 'story.For', 'personally', 'splitting', 'hairs', 'situation', 'n', 'example', 'true', 'pedophilia', 'based', 'child', '11', '13', 'truly', 'point', 'horrific', 'nature', 'taking', 'advantage', 'underage', 'youth', 'especially', 'teacher', ""'m"", 'repulsed', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'endlessly', 'defend', 'teacher', 'actions', 'film', 'have', 'dismissed', 'situation', 'over-reaction', 'religious', 'conservatives', 'wish', 'quibble', 'misuse', 'term', 'pedophilia', 'doubt', 'great', 'defenders', 'free', 'choice', 'would', 'feel', 'way', 'son', 'daughter', 'was', 'having', 'sex', 'teacher', 'whom', 'trusted', 'look', 'out', 'child', 'well-being.I', 'also', 'think', 'extremely', 'low', 'inappropriate', 'compare', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'adult', 'teacher', '15', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'case', 'rape', 'incest', 'more', 'appropriately', 'accurate', 'pedophilia', 'relationship', 'disgusting', 'effort', 'excuse', 'trusted', 'teacher', 'moral', 'professional', 'duty', 'protect', 'students', 'matter', 'age', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'teenager', 'consents', 'not', 'attempts', 'devalue', 'abuse', 'going', 'situation', 'will', 'admit', 'anger', 'disgust', 'level', 'would', 'be', 'radically', 'different', 'own', 'child', 'was', 'sexually', 'taken', 'advantage', '8', 'comparison', '15', ""n't"", 'mean', 'crime', ""n't"", 'been', 'committed', 'moral', 'violation', ""n't"", 'happened', 'professional', 'misused', 'trust', 'authority', 'given', 'community']",Notes on a Scandal

Sometimes, it's just about the story and the talented people to get the story onscreen. In this case, the story is based on Zoe Heller's novel of the same name. They casted Dame Judi Dench OBE CH to play Barbara Covett, a spinster aging school-teacher who lives with her cat, Portia in London, England and teaches at a rough school. Cate Blanchett plays Sheba Hart, the young art teacher who gets a job teaching at the same school after 10 years caring for her Down syndrome son, Ben. She is married to an older man, Richard, played by Bill Nighy.From afar, Barbara Covett watches Sheba Hart and observes her before she actually befriends her. Barbara is an old-school battleaxe teacher who is more of a Mother Superior. She's old school, traditional, and is trapped in the old world. She's alone and has lived an unremarkable quiet life in London with her cat, Portia. She has no close friends. From Barbara's narration, we can tell that she is looking for someone to care for her.When Barbara finds out about Shebe'a scandalous affair with a 15 year old student, she is both horrified and uses the secret affair to unintentionally blackmail Sheba into a friendship. When she betrays her, Barbara returns the favor. While Barbara is a complicated character, so is Sheba. I think Barbara likes to live vicariously through Sheba who has a family and a husband. Barbara narrates about the pain and suffering of being alone all this time.When the scandal breaks, nobody is safe and lives are overturned including Barbara's. My biggest complaint about this movie was the lack of use of Julia McKenzie. They could have used her more and helped explain Barbara's background. It's interesting that the movie is quite short about 90 minutes but it goes by so fast and you want more in the end.",4,The Spinster's Obsession!,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,1852,"['Sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'spend', 'fortune', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'story', 'talented', 'people', 'get', 'story', 'onscreen', 'case', 'story', 'based', 'Zoe', 'Heller', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'casted', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'OBE', 'CH', 'play', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'spinster', 'aging', 'school-teacher', 'who', 'cat', 'Portia', 'London', 'England', 'teaches', 'rough', 'school', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'young', 'art', 'teacher', 'who', 'job', 'teaching', 'same', 'school', '10', 'years', 'caring', 'Down', 'syndrome', 'son', 'Ben', 'married', 'older', 'man', 'Richard', 'played', 'Bill', 'Nighy.From', 'afar', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'actually', 'Barbara', 'old-school', 'battleaxe', 'teacher', 'who', 'more', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'old', 'school', 'traditional', 'trapped', 'old', 'world', 'alone', 'lived', 'unremarkable', 'quiet', 'life', 'London', 'cat', 'Portia', 'close', 'friends', 'Barbara', 'narration', 'can', 'tell', 'looking', 'someone', 'care', 'her.When', 'Barbara', 'out', 'Shebe', 'scandalous', 'affair', '15', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'horrified', 'secret', 'affair', 'unintentionally', 'blackmail', 'Sheba', 'friendship', 'When', 'Barbara', 'favor', 'Barbara', 'complicated', 'character', 'so', 'Sheba', 'think', 'Barbara', 'likes', 'live', 'vicariously', 'Sheba', 'who', 'family', 'husband', 'Barbara', 'pain', 'suffering', 'being', 'alone', 'scandal', 'nobody', 'safe', 'lives', 'are', 'overturned', 'including', 'Barbara', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'movie', 'was', 'lack', 'use', 'Julia', 'McKenzie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'helped', 'explain', 'Barbara', 'background', 'interesting', 'movie', 'quite', 'short', '90', 'minutes', 'fast', 'want', 'more', 'end']",Notes on a Scandal

However, she does it beautifully. She is an amazing actress.Cate, who plays Sheba Hart, a slightly bohemian art teacher, is truly gifted in any part she acts but this might be her very best.

No surprise to us, but Sheba was totally devastated.Bill Nighy, as the faithful husband, was a wonderful father. Sheba, on the surface, was a wonderful loving mother. However, Sheba had some major battles with lust that haunted her until those weaknesses caught up with her.

645913,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JP63,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 9]","How can any film with both Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett be bad? And ""notes on a Scandal"" is very close to being a brilliant thriller.Barbara Covett (Judi Dench), a longtime history teacher at a private middle school in a London suburb, watches the children return for another year of institutionalized baby sitting. They are a randy lot she generally dislikes. She also notices Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett), the new art teacher, arrive and decides to befriend her, help her get through the school year and cope with the rowdy children who are more interested in smoking, fighting and having sex. Sheba returns the favor and invites Barbara to Sunday Lunch. The older teacher is thrilled to have some ""alone time"" with her new friend and expects a quiet afternoon alone. But she is surprised to find Sheba is married to Richard (Bill Nighy), they have a teenage daughter, Polly (Juno Temple) and a son, Ben (Max Lewis) who has Down 's syndrome. Sheba and Richard invite her into the middle of their lives and Sheba also begins to confide in Barbara, telling her her secrets, her dreams and her disappointments. Barbara secretly hopes for, longs for, something more and when she spots Sheba sleeping with one of her students, Steven Connelly (Andrew Simpson), she suspects she may have found the way to get what she desires.Written by Patrick Marber (""Closer"") and directed by Richard Eyre (""Iris""), ""Notes on a Scandal"" is the first film in a long time to use thriller elements in a film written by, about and for adults. The characters may make some childish choices, but the filmmakers never treat the audience with the same disdain.Judi Dench plays perhaps the most repressed Lesbian in film history. As Barbara, she has few friends and little interaction with her family, preferring to spend time at home with her cat and writing in her journal. As she writes extensively in these bound notebooks, reading from them to narrate the film, we learn a little about her previous relationships; she seems attracted to women who don't return her affections. Her relationship with Sheba would probably end in the same way, with court action, but Barbara learns of Sheba's affair with one of her students providing Barbara with a light at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps, just perhaps, she might be able to use that to attain the relationship she has so long desired.It is this desperation, and what happens when things go wrong, that fuels the thriller elements of ""Notes"". Barbara is so repressed, so desperate, we don't know what she might do to attain this new relationship she craves.And they way she uses this knowledge works and helps make the film all the more memorable.Because Barbara provides the narration, reading from her journals, we learn things about her character other people do not know. I found myself watching the film thinking ""No, don't do that. Don't you see what she is doing?"" This doesn't happen that often. The writing and acting so affected me, I was rooting for certain characters, hoping they would do certain things. And this happened because of the narration. Because we learn things other characters don't know, we become a participant in the story. We can see the mistakes characters are making and hope and wish they will make the right choices because they have become so real we care for them.Cate Blanchett has the less showy, but no less important role of Sheba. What Blanchett does is make this role so much more than an innocent victim or bystander. Because Sheba so readily tells Barbara all of her secrets, she reveals a lot. She is a bit adrift, needs some companionship, perhaps her marriage and family isn't everything she had hoped for. She essentially gives Barbara everything the older woman thinks she needs to start a relationship. Sheba does this unknowingly, leading to those moments of ""Oh no, don't do that"", allowing Blanchett to reveal how trusting her character is.But Sheba isn't a saint. Married to her former professor (Nighy), who is a good twenty years her senior, she has two children. As she states, after ten years of caring for Ben and the rest of the family, she needs new challenges, which leads to the teaching job. Apparently, she also needs new loving, which leads to her affair with Stephen (Simpson), one of her 15 year old students. This affair is portrayed well, thoughtfully and painstakingly. We get a real feel for what draws Sheba to this relationship, why they continue to see each other, what makes it last. It also shows how flawed her character is. The filmmakers challenge us to like her character and we feel for her, sympathy, loathing and even pity.Blanchett and Dench so completely inhabit their characters it would be difficult to not believe they were real. I have never seen Dench look so dour, so unhappy, so unfulfilled. She looks like she has led an unhappy life and the one time she wears any make-up, it appears completely unnatural to her character. Blanchett appears uncomfortable and vulnerable, unhappy in her own skin. These are two of the best actresses working today, at the height of their craft and skills.Bill Nighy is also very good. He is usually cast in flamboyant, jokey roles, like the fading rock singer in ""Love, Actually""; he is a bit like the British Christopher Walken, but he can take on challenging dramatic roles. Richard is a loving, supportive husband but his anger is palpable when he finds out what his wife has done. The resolution of this crisis is also handled well and is very believable.Part of the beauty of ""Notes"" is how the tension escalates. Eyre and Marber reveal little bits of the characters as we go along, manipulating our feelings about these characters. One moment, we hate Barbara, then we start to feel sad for her. One moment, we think Sheba is a great mother, then we hate her for having an affair with a 15 year old. Because the filmmakers have laid the groundwork so well, we can see the road leading to certain missteps and watch as the consequences play out in a believable way. All of these elements - great acting, crisp writing, taut direction - blend together to create one of the best films of the year.",5,Dench and Blanchett Headline the Best Thriller of the

There a new teacher arrives, Sheba (Cate Blanchett), apparently happily-married, but in fact, as Barbara detects, discontented with her life. When Barbara comes to know the secret about Sheba and one student, Barbara, obsessed with one idea, starts to manipulate everyone around her, to obtain what she desperately wants in her lonely life.I regard ""Notes on a Scandal"" as well-made thriller, but you will also frequently hear the voiceovers from Judi Dench's Barbara, formidable character whose extraordinary personality is suggested between the lines peppered with her acid words. While you find Barbara's words and actions unexpectedly funny at certain points (as she acts like a young schoolgirl, for instance), you also notice that the film itself describes the past and present life of Barbara with a delicate touch, as well as that of Sheba, another case of loneliness.I know in real life people would behave more cleverly than Barbara and Sheba, and some would say, probably rightly, that actors sometimes overact, but it must be said that like a real page turner ""Notes on a Scandal"" is never boring with superb acting and engaging story.",4,Non-Stop Fun of Watching Well-Made Melodrama with First-Rate Performances,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,1650,"['want', 'enjoy', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'gripping', 'narrative', 'great', 'acting', 'biting', 'satire', 'here', 'Take', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'where', 'one', 'mistake', 'well-to-do', 'schoolteacher', 'snowballs', 'catastrophic', 'consequences', 'may', 'call', 'story', 'loneliness', 'yes', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'thriller', 'psychological', 'one', 'Fatal', 'Attractions', 'Meet', 'Barbara', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'spinster', 'living', 'old', 'cat', 'who', 'also', 'stern', 'history', 'teacher', 'rowdy', 'school', 'new', 'teacher', 'arrives', 'Sheba', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'apparently', 'happily-married', 'fact', 'Barbara', 'detects', 'discontented', 'life', 'When', 'Barbara', 'know', 'secret', 'Sheba', 'one', 'student', 'Barbara', 'obsessed', 'one', 'idea', 'manipulate', 'everyone', 'obtain', 'what', 'desperately', 'lonely', 'life.I', 'regard', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'well-made', 'thriller', 'will', 'also', 'frequently', 'hear', 'voiceovers', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Barbara', 'formidable', 'character', 'extraordinary', 'personality', 'suggested', 'lines', 'peppered', 'acid', 'words', 'find', 'Barbara', 'words', 'actions', 'unexpectedly', 'funny', 'certain', 'points', 'young', 'schoolgirl', 'instance', 'also', 'notice', 'film', 'past', 'present', 'life', 'Barbara', 'delicate', 'touch', 'as', 'well', 'Sheba', 'case', 'loneliness.I', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'would', 'behave', 'more', 'cleverly', 'Barbara', 'Sheba', 'would', 'say', 'probably', 'rightly', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'overact', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'real', 'page', 'turner', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'never', 'boring', 'superb', 'acting', 'engaging', 'story']",Notes on a Scandal

The situation (Cate Blachett having an affair with a student and being pursued by lesbian Judi Dench) is great material but what happened to British understatement? Instead, we get fights, tantrums, screaming matches, a dead cat, and mascara dripping down Blachett's face like a clown. The fights were worthy of Jerry Springer on a bad day. I thought soap suds would come of the DVD player after I've played it. Judi Dench and Cate Blachett are great, the dialogue is poignant (the quiet scenes are the best, i.e., Dench's speech about solitude). What a pity it was overshadowed by the loud historics demanded by the director/screenplay. The worst scene was when, after applying ghoulish black mascara, Cate Blachett blows up at Judi Dench after reading her diary and storms out into the crowd of reporters, screaming her head off. Then there's the scene where Blachett's husband discovers the affair and literally seems to be tearing his hair out. In another scene, the boy's mother comes into Blachett's house, and without a word, punches her! After awhile, I was too exhausted watching the historics of this film. Subtlety, anyone?

645925,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JP63,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[3, 4]","A movie like Notes on a Scandal would not work if the performances are bad, and it's simply irresitable and captivating when it features two of the best female performances of the year. Having watched the trailer, I was instantly tempted to check out the brilliant veteran actress Judi Dench in what was considered to be the performance of her career in her rare outting with a villianous role.The film is not a bit boring and it's very gradual how it all built up the intensity and  excitment towards one of the most powerful and mesmerizing physical and verbal showdown between the victim/Blanchette and the vampire/Dench. I shall not reveal much about the plotline, because it's really not a complicated story to follow, it's the depths of the characters that interested me profoundly. It had explored the inner psycholoical beings of the two female characters and how they allow themselves to fall apart or become relentlessly vulnerable. I must say I am not sympathetic towards Blanchette/Sheba at all, but I do get to understand why she chose to have an affair with her 15 year old student knowing that there was going to be consquences and sabotages towards her entire family life. It must have someting to do with her own experience of marrying a much older man(Bill Nighy) when she was in her late teens. As a loney and manipulative older woman(Dench/Barbara) secretly scrutinizing the moral downfall of Sheba, and masterminding an elaborate plan to put her to the point of no return, the process had given her more joy than anything in life. Something is really wrong with this woman when she writes in her secret diary with thoughts about the delicate intenisity of two women being it the same room and that being involved with Sheba had been the most delicious part of her life....So do I find Barbara likeable? Yes, for a dramatic reason, but she's unforgivable at the same time, and she's been ""long gone"" in a mental way. Watching such mesmerizing performance from Dench reminded me of some other great psychopath characters such as the ones played Kathy Bates and Jack Nicolson. It really is nothing like what she's done before in her career and I don't know if any actress of her generation would be able to tackle such a heavy duty role, maybe Maggie Smith?Bill Nighy did have a one big scene to work when he had the final confrontation with wife Sheba, but most of the time he was kind of a background character. The kid who seduced Sheba was brave and daring altogher. I didn't really understand his motive, maybe it's rebel thing.On Oscar note: I would love to see Dench win the best actress award, because I am so taken by her performance and it's not like she's going to have another more challenging role considered she might retire soon. It's really amazing when an actress can make you love and hate her character at the same time. I still don't know why Blanchette is being ""pushed"" as candidate in the best supporting actress cateogory considered that she has equal amount of screentime as Dench, maybe the studio wants Dench to have more chance of winning.",5,"""This month had been the most delicious part of my life....""",1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,3085,"['movie', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'performances', 'are', 'bad', 'simply', 'irresitable', 'captivating', 'when', 'two', 'best', 'female', 'performances', 'year', 'Having', 'watched', 'trailer', 'was', 'instantly', 'tempted', 'check', 'out', 'brilliant', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'performance', 'career', 'rare', 'outting', 'villianous', 'role.The', 'film', 'not', 'bit', 'boring', 'very', 'gradual', 'how', 'built', 'up', 'intensity', 'excitment', 'towards', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'mesmerizing', 'physical', 'verbal', 'showdown', 'victim/Blanchette', 'vampire/Dench', 'shall', 'not', 'reveal', 'much', 'plotline', 'really', 'not', 'complicated', 'story', 'follow', 'depths', 'characters', 'interested', 'profoundly', 'had', 'explored', 'inner', 'psycholoical', 'beings', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'how', 'allow', 'fall', 'apart', 'become', 'relentlessly', 'vulnerable', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Blanchette/Sheba', 'do', 'get', 'understand', 'why', 'chose', 'have', 'affair', '15', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'knowing', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'consquences', 'sabotages', 'towards', 'entire', 'family', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'someting', 'do', 'own', 'experience', 'marrying', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'when', 'was', 'late', 'teens', 'loney', 'manipulative', 'older', 'woman', 'Dench/Barbara', 'secretly', 'scrutinizing', 'moral', 'downfall', 'Sheba', 'masterminding', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'put', 'point', 'return', 'process', 'had', 'given', 'more', 'joy', 'anything', 'life', 'Something', 'really', 'wrong', 'woman', 'when', 'secret', 'diary', 'thoughts', 'delicate', 'intenisity', 'two', 'women', 'being', 'same', 'room', 'being', 'involved', 'Sheba', 'had', 'been', 'most', 'delicious', 'part', 'life', 'do', 'find', 'Barbara', 'likeable', 'Yes', 'dramatic', 'reason', 'unforgivable', 'same', 'time', 'been', 'long', 'gone', 'mental', 'way', 'Watching', 'such', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'Dench', 'reminded', 'other', 'great', 'psychopath', 'characters', 'such', 'ones', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Jack', 'Nicolson', 'really', 'nothing', 'what', 'done', 'before', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actress', 'generation', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'tackle', 'heavy', 'duty', 'role', 'maybe', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'big', 'scene', 'work', 'when', 'had', 'final', 'confrontation', 'wife', 'Sheba', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'kind', 'background', 'character', 'kid', 'who', 'seduced', 'Sheba', 'was', 'brave', 'daring', 'altogher', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'motive', 'maybe', 'rebel', 'thing.On', 'Oscar', 'note', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Dench', 'win', 'best', 'actress', 'award', 'am', 'so', 'taken', 'performance', 'not', 'going', 'have', 'more', 'challenging', 'role', 'considered', 'might', 'retire', 'soon', 'really', 'amazing', 'when', 'actress', 'can', 'make', 'love', 'hate', 'character', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Blanchette', 'being', 'pushed', 'candidate', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'cateogory', 'considered', 'equal', 'amount', 'screentime', 'Dench', 'maybe', 'studio', 'Dench', 'have', 'more', 'chance', 'winning']",Notes on a Scandal

The character of Barbara (Judi Dench) is villified beyond need and that of Sheba (Cate Blanchett) somehow manages to get our sympathy. No! This is not the feeling I got from the book! If I have to say something nice, the acting is good.On further reflection: why did they have to make the lesbian tendency SO obvious??? It was a little bit more than a hint in the book but it's FULL blown in the movie.

645927,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B00005JP63,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 3]","From the first trailer, it was clear that Notes On a Scandal is a performance-based film, relying heavily on its two leading actresses (Blanchett and Dench) to pull the audience in to the story. And that expectation definitely pays off. Both Dench and Blanchett bring so much to their characters, it's difficult to look away when either of them is on screen.The basic story is that Sheba Hart (Blanchett) joins a school's education faculty as an art teacher and befriends Barbara Covett (Dench), an older self-described 'battle-ax' of a teacher.  Sheba goes on to have an affair with a fifteen year old student at the school which Barbara discovers. What ensues is a psychological game of blackmail that leaves the viewer as disconcerted as Sheba herself.The story moves along steadily and eerily as the true extent of Barbara's obsession with Sheba is revealed. What is most interesting about the characters in this film is that none of them are simple caricatures, as is often unfortunately the result of a film of this nature. Dench and Blanchett earn their Oscar nominations hands down, while Nighy still manages to hold his ground and deliver a powerful performance as a confused and angry husband.As other reviewers have stated, towards the end of the movie, the melodrama meter gets a little high, especially in the last quarter of the film, but ultimately even that doesn't kill the energy that the film has built up throughout. I haven't read the book by Zoe Heller, so I can't compare or contrast anything there.",4,Stunning acting from two powerful actresses,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,1522,"['first', 'trailer', 'was', 'clear', 'Scandal', 'performance-based', 'film', 'relying', 'heavily', 'two', 'leading', 'actresses', 'Blanchett', 'Dench', 'pull', 'audience', 'story', 'expectation', 'definitely', 'Dench', 'Blanchett', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'difficult', 'look', 'away', 'when', 'screen.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Sheba', 'Hart', 'Blanchett', 'school', 'education', 'faculty', 'art', 'teacher', 'Barbara', 'Covett', 'Dench', 'older', 'self-described', ""'battle-ax"", ""'"", 'teacher', 'Sheba', 'have', 'affair', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'school', 'Barbara', 'discovers', 'What', 'psychological', 'game', 'blackmail', 'viewer', 'as', 'disconcerted', 'Sheba', 'herself.The', 'story', 'moves', 'steadily', 'eerily', 'true', 'extent', 'Barbara', 'obsession', 'Sheba', 'revealed', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'film', 'none', 'are', 'simple', 'caricatures', 'often', 'unfortunately', 'result', 'film', 'nature', 'Dench', 'Blanchett', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'down', 'Nighy', 'still', 'hold', 'ground', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'performance', 'confused', 'angry', 'husband.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'end', 'movie', 'melodrama', 'meter', 'little', 'high', 'especially', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'ultimately', 'even', ""n't"", 'kill', 'energy', 'film', 'built', 'up', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Zoe', 'Heller', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'contrast', 'anything', 'there']",Notes on a Scandal
