Here's the lowdown: A pretty ""lead"" actress, minor nudity, bad (as in not good) acting, uninvolving throughout. A shame DMX has his name capitalized on (somehow the producers got him about 2 minutes of screen time). Lou Diamond must have really needed the work. Anyway, I fast forwarded through the vast majority of this disc only to conclude that it did not improve the experience very much.",1,Not a Good Movie,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,430,"['classic', 'sub-par', 'movie', 'making', 'Here', 'lowdown', 'pretty', 'lead', 'actress', 'minor', 'nudity', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'acting', 'uninvolving', 'shame', 'DMX', 'name', 'capitalized', 'somehow', 'producers', 'got', '2', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'needed', 'work', 'Anyway', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'vast', 'majority', 'disc', 'only', 'conclude', 'did', 'not', 'improve', 'experience', 'very', 'much']",Death Toll

At the end the message was  about New Orleans high crime rate and poverty. So I assume this is what the movie was about.  There was no real story. This could have been a good movie if some more thought was put into it. Shame on the director and writers. They have a couple of good actors in there too. To me the movie was just all over the place, (this was worst than a soap opera. DMX was the  narrator, he was not an actor in this movie and you only see him talking a couple of times throughout the movie. It is like one of the reviewers said, almost like a home movie. The only thing I learned about this movie was at the end when the message pops up about New Orlean high crime rate and high proverty.

1136526,A3MEPA6GTA2MVZ,B0012EBV6U,Roloff,"[1, 1]","Where do I begin?  For one the summary for this movie is a lie, DMX is not a drug dealer called the dog calling the shots, he is in the movie for about 2 minutes and has no interaction with the characters, he is some odd narrator that say some non sensible quips from time to time.  The acting is perhaps the worst I have ever seen.  The story, where do I begin I could not understand what this movie was about one minute you got guys shooting each other, and then cops getting shot.  Then you got cops talking to the guy who everyone knows shot a cop as if nothing like that happened.  Then it jumps around and then you got preaching about how because these killing are in Black neighborhoods no one cares.  Then you got Lou Diamond Phillips overacting and then he is having an affair and then more people are getting shot and then you got renegade cops and then you got guys that visit their moms (oh how nice)and you got cops cheating on their wives and cops having threesomes and some drug dealer called the dominican and so on and so on. With my rambling run on sentence I probably do more justice to sum up the story than this movie does.  There is also some hypocritical message in the end stating that the New Orleans murder rate is high, then the very next message is something about honoring the fallen soldiers or warriors or something like.  Now I'm assuming that by fallen soldiers or warriors, theyre talking about the degenerates drug dealers and gang members that are getting killed in this violence, now call me reasonable (I know the writer and director would never understand this) but isn't saying the violence is too high and then saying the guys who got killed were heroes even though there they same type of people perpetrating the violence is kind of hypocritic.  I mean the whole movie is about gang members or drug dealer killing each other (I think, I really don't know what the movie was about), but that's okay because theyre warriors, but the killing is bad.",1,This is possibly the worst film ever made,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,1988,"['Where', 'do', 'begin', 'one', 'summary', 'movie', 'lie', 'DMX', 'not', 'drug', 'dealer', 'called', 'dog', 'calling', 'shots', 'movie', '2', 'minutes', 'interaction', 'characters', 'odd', 'narrator', 'say', 'non', 'sensible', 'quips', 'time', 'time', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'where', 'do', 'begin', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'minute', 'got', 'guys', 'shooting', 'other', 'then', 'cops', 'getting', 'shot', 'Then', 'got', 'cops', 'talking', 'guy', 'who', 'everyone', 'shot', 'cop', 'nothing', 'happened', 'Then', 'around', 'then', 'got', 'preaching', 'how', 'killing', 'are', 'Black', 'one', 'cares', 'Then', 'got', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'overacting', 'then', 'having', 'affair', 'then', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'shot', 'then', 'got', 'renegade', 'cops', 'then', 'got', 'guys', 'visit', 'moms', 'oh', 'how', 'nice', 'got', 'cops', 'cheating', 'wives', 'cops', 'having', 'threesomes', 'drug', 'dealer', 'called', 'dominican', 'so', 'so', 'rambling', 'run', 'sentence', 'probably', 'do', 'more', 'justice', 'sum', 'up', 'story', 'movie', 'also', 'hypocritical', 'message', 'end', 'stating', 'New', 'Orleans', 'murder', 'rate', 'high', 'then', 'very', 'next', 'message', 'something', 'honoring', 'fallen', 'soldiers', 'warriors', 'something', 'Now', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'fallen', 'soldiers', 'warriors', 'theyre', 'talking', 'degenerates', 'drug', 'dealers', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'violence', 'now', 'call', 'reasonable', 'know', 'writer', 'director', 'would', 'never', 'understand', ""n't"", 'saying', 'violence', 'too', 'high', 'then', 'saying', 'guys', 'who', 'got', 'killed', 'were', 'heroes', 'even', 'there', 'same', 'type', 'people', 'perpetrating', 'violence', 'kind', 'hypocritic', 'mean', 'whole', 'movie', 'gang', 'members', 'drug', 'dealer', 'killing', 'other', 'think', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'okay', 'theyre', 'warriors', 'killing', 'bad']",Death Toll
1136527,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0012EBV6U,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","Wow (in it's most negative form) is the first word to come to mind when trying to sum up Death Toll. When you can sign super washed up rapper DMX for the lead role in your movie you may want to choose another career. Even worse then that, if he decides it's so b that he's only going to appear for a couple minutes then you have your confirmation this business isn't for you. Instead try to start up a really b rap label where at least you may have a chance at extremely minor success. The funny thing is this one took us back to a time where we used to watch these type movies on a regular basis. A time that we still ponder as just being a really bad dream.If the synopsis even matters then here's a brief description to hopefully spare your time. Big time drug dealer ""The Dog,"" yeah he's still trying to make that crap work a decade later, is spreading panic and terror through the streets of New Orleans. So Mayor Padial (Lou Diamond Phillips) takes aim at stopping the madness by bringing down one of the world's top b rappers. Even more troubling then the awful plot is the fact that chief Lou Diamond Phillips accepted a role in the movie. This guy must have been in a real bad place where he needed some real quick cash. Either that or he wanted to meet DMX really bad, but we doubt anyone would really want to do that.So if you couldn't tell by the general tone of the review, we thought this one was simply terrible. Absolutely nothing good came from it despite Sid's love for laughable b of all genres. Even after Seagal watched Death Toll he threw up in his lap realizing he worked with DMX years ago in the blockbuster smash hit Exit Wounds. Once the credits rolled he simply said a term Sid had heard years prior by Rodgers' Mom ""Never again, never again!"" The best plan for the future of this dvd would be to give out free copies with every Popeyes combo meals and feature it on the ""He's gone, the evils gone from here"" Listmania. But on a good night Sid just realized the Seinfeld with Mr. Chan is on so it's time to go, thanks for reading.",1,You know it's bad when DMX only appears in it for a couple minutes,1257465600,"11 6, 2009",2009,2058,"['Wow', 'most', 'negative', 'form', 'first', 'word', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'trying', 'sum', 'up', 'Death', 'Toll', 'When', 'can', 'sign', 'super', 'washed', 'up', 'rapper', 'DMX', 'lead', 'role', 'movie', 'may', 'want', 'choose', 'career', 'Even', 'worse', 'then', 'so', 'b', 'only', 'going', 'appear', 'couple', 'minutes', 'then', 'have', 'confirmation', 'business', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'try', 'start', 'up', 'really', 'b', 'rap', 'label', 'where', 'least', 'may', 'have', 'chance', 'extremely', 'minor', 'success', 'funny', 'thing', 'one', 'took', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'used', 'watch', 'type', 'movies', 'regular', 'basis', 'time', 'still', 'ponder', 'just', 'being', 'really', 'bad', 'dream.If', 'synopsis', 'even', 'matters', 'then', 'here', 'brief', 'description', 'hopefully', 'spare', 'time', 'Big', 'time', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Dog', 'still', 'trying', 'make', 'crap', 'work', 'decade', 'later', 'spreading', 'panic', 'terror', 'streets', 'New', 'Orleans', 'So', 'Mayor', 'Padial', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'aim', 'stopping', 'madness', 'bringing', 'down', 'one', 'world', 'top', 'b', 'rappers', 'Even', 'more', 'troubling', 'then', 'awful', 'plot', 'fact', 'chief', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'accepted', 'role', 'movie', 'guy', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'bad', 'place', 'where', 'needed', 'real', 'quick', 'cash', 'wanted', 'meet', 'DMX', 'really', 'bad', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'that.So', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'general', 'tone', 'review', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'simply', 'terrible', 'Absolutely', 'nothing', 'good', 'came', 'Sid', 'love', 'laughable', 'b', 'genres', 'Even', 'Seagal', 'watched', 'Death', 'Toll', 'threw', 'up', 'lap', 'realizing', 'worked', 'DMX', 'years', 'ago', 'blockbuster', 'smash', 'hit', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'credits', 'rolled', 'simply', 'said', 'term', 'Sid', 'had', 'heard', 'years', 'prior', 'Rodgers', 'Mom', 'Never', 'again', 'never', 'again', 'best', 'plan', 'future', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'out', 'free', 'copies', 'Popeyes', 'combo', 'meals', 'feature', 'gone', 'evils', 'gone', 'here', 'Listmania', 'good', 'night', 'Sid', 'just', 'realized', 'Seinfeld', 'Mr.', 'Chan', 'time', 'go', 'thanks', 'reading']",Death Toll
1136528,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0012EBV6U,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie takes place in New Orleans. Two bad actors are talking on a hood of a car. Nu$$ie, wearing a hair net, who apparently hates bad actors shoots one of them. It turns out he belonged to a rival gang of bad actors. Some more bad actors show up at the scene disguised as policemen and the people in the hood won't talk to them, hoping all bad actors will die. The Feds (Lisa Marie Dupree) have their own bad actors who conflict with the local extras. To add to the confusion, a white male detective (Alec Rayme) is married to a black female lawyer. He has a somewhat black female partner (Leila Arcieri) who always calls him to the irritation of the wife who is threatening to Bobbitt him. OH! TALK TO THE HAND!I had to laugh when the 2 bad acting cops grabbed a local youth at the crime scene. He held him while she pulled her gun out and pointed at his chest demanding information. How many laws did the cops break with that one? DMX leads the rival gang of rappers who did the killing.Lou Diamond Phillips plays the mayor with few lines. The ""Dr. J"" flashback scene was so bad it was comical.This was a terrible movie. The good news is that they shot the whole thing on the first take, saving tons of money. It was comical in the way Seagal films are comical. (If you don't laugh at Seagal films, you may not find this one funny.) It has a very high MST potential, which means in an altered state you could possibly find this thing entertaining. DO NOT WATCH SOBER!Oneal A.
