It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops.Washington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City.The inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war.James Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate. But the star of this film is Daniels. In sum, a fine A&amp;E production well worth seeing.",4,Hats Off to Jeff Daniels,1001462400,"09 26, 2001",2001,1815,"['often', 'show', 'Crossing', 'political', 'science', 'classes', 'invariably', 'are', 'enthralled', 'intriguing', 'almost', 'shocking', 'film', 'most', 'striking', 'surprise', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'portrayal', 'great', 'Washington', 'humanism', 'determinism', 'unparalleled', 'leadership', 'mixed', 'little', 'testiness', 'bawdiness', 'sum', 'man', 'flaws', 'who', 'took', 'life', 'mission', 'seriously', 'winning', 'loyalty', 'rag', 'troops.Washington', 'was', 'somewhat', 'wooden', 'Daniels', 'again', 'well', 'took', 'aspect', 'life', 'dead', 'seriousness', 'clear', 'vision', 'nation', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'created', 'Present', 'creation', 'new', 'nation', 'commander', 'chief', 'rallied', 'men', 'battle', 'Trenton', 'December', '1776', 'subject', 'film', 'avenging', 'early', 'loss', 'New', 'York', 'City.The', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'are', 'little', 'consequence', 'essence', 'Washington', 'audacious', 'crossing', 'treacherous', 'Delaware', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'depth', 'night', 'completely', 'surprising', 'battle-hardened', 'hung-over', 'Hessians', 'helped', 'turned', 'tide', 'war', 'time', 'when', 'America', 'victory', 'teetered', 'disaster', 'Daniels', 'man', 'not', 'myth', 'giving', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'stiffness', 'caring', 'men', 'determination', 'would', 'win', 'very', 'long', 'war.James', 'Kidnie', 'Hessian', 'Colonel', 'Rall', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Washington', 'attack', 'meticulously', 'then', 'panics', 'American', 'onslaught', 'hardly', 'believing', 'eyes', 'Director', 'Harmon', 'pacing', 'plodding', 'times', 'crossing', 'full', 'suspense', 'battle', 'more', 'passably', 'exciting', 'cinematography', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'adequate', 'star', 'film', 'Daniels', 'sum', 'fine', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'production', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",The Crossing VHS

3984,A27T7FAONDX6VI,0767023765,"Chris ""Chris906""","[2, 4]","Jeff Daniels had brought to life previously a great figure in American history by his masterful job as Joshua Chamberlain in 'Gettysburg'. In 'The Crossing' he takes on a even larger icon from the American past and pretty much knocks it out of the park. George Washington has always been one of my favorite historical characters, I think pretty highly of him. I think that he and his men were the glue that held the American Revolution together. Washington could have been a dictator but wasn't. His character and devotion to country are the stuff legends are made of.'The Crossing' finds Washington at a critical time when he is at low ebb after the humbling defeats around New York. The war effort is portrayed in a very unromantic life. This was a war that America lost more battles than it won. But Washington at Christmas 1776 had a ace up his sleeve and the rest as they say is history. Daniels dazzles as Washington and portrays him as a very human character and shows his great temper that Washington usually kept under wraps. His dry humor is also a nice touch. I also like the bringing to life of the nearly forgotten John Glover ,by Sebastian Roch&eacute;, and the true bravery of his men and what they sacrificed for the cause without their efforts little would have been possible. Roger Rees also does a nice job as Washington's friend Hugh Mercer. Mercer was one of the ancestors of George S. Patton of World War II fame, for a little trivia.The film captures the cold of winter well and is a DVD to watch in December-January when the leaves have fallen off the trees and you have a warm crackling fire inside. This film captures that tough winter well and the spirit of the men who remained and the great leader who led them in one great roll of the dice. I wish more films were made about our Revolution.The DVD has good picture and sound plus an interesting little 'making of' the film as an extra.Highly recommended!",5,Very Good Film on Washington and critical time in the American Revolution,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,1934,"['Jeff', 'Daniels', 'had', 'brought', 'life', 'previously', 'great', 'figure', 'American', 'history', 'masterful', 'job', 'Joshua', 'Chamberlain', ""'Gettysburg"", ""'The"", 'Crossing', 'even', 'larger', 'icon', 'American', 'past', 'pretty', 'much', 'knocks', 'park', 'George', 'Washington', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'historical', 'characters', 'think', 'pretty', 'highly', 'think', 'men', 'were', 'glue', 'held', 'American', 'Revolution', 'together', 'Washington', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dictator', 'was', ""n't"", 'character', 'devotion', 'country', 'are', 'stuff', 'legends', 'are', 'made', 'Crossing', 'Washington', 'critical', 'time', 'when', 'low', 'ebb', 'humbling', 'defeats', 'New', 'York', 'war', 'effort', 'portrayed', 'very', 'unromantic', 'life', 'was', 'war', 'America', 'lost', 'more', 'battles', 'won', 'Washington', 'Christmas', '1776', 'had', 'ace', 'up', 'sleeve', 'rest', 'say', 'history', 'Daniels', 'Washington', 'very', 'human', 'character', 'great', 'temper', 'Washington', 'usually', 'kept', 'wraps', 'dry', 'humor', 'also', 'nice', 'touch', 'also', 'bringing', 'life', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'John', 'Glover', 'Sebastian', 'Roch', 'eacute', 'true', 'bravery', 'men', 'what', 'sacrificed', 'cause', 'efforts', 'little', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'Roger', 'Rees', 'also', 'nice', 'job', 'Washington', 'friend', 'Hugh', 'Mercer', 'Mercer', 'was', 'one', 'ancestors', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fame', 'little', 'trivia.The', 'film', 'cold', 'winter', 'well', 'DVD', 'watch', 'December-January', 'when', 'leaves', 'have', 'fallen', 'off', 'trees', 'have', 'warm', 'crackling', 'fire', 'inside', 'film', 'tough', 'winter', 'well', 'spirit', 'men', 'who', 'remained', 'great', 'leader', 'who', 'led', 'one', 'great', 'roll', 'dice', 'wish', 'more', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'Revolution.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'interesting', 'little', ""'making"", 'film', 'extra.Highly', 'recommended']",The Crossing VHS

They should see, in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.I have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war.  This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain &quot;toughness.&quot;  It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared.  These few made the great difference.  And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge.  This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing.  They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.As you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington (Jeff Daniels) and Col. John Glover (Sebastian Roche).  Col. Glover is the feisty, outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders.  He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.If you are interested get Howard Fast's &quot;The Unvanguished.&quot;  This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail.  Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script. With Fast's earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington's relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense.  .The acting is good to very good.

3997,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,0767023765,Hikari,"[9, 18]","I recently saw the HBO miniseries ""John Adams"" and was compelled to watch this movie for a different perspective on a portion of the same period.  Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of ""John Adams"" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.",2,An Epic Battle Not So Epic,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,3360,"['recently', 'saw', 'HBO', 'John', 'Adams', 'was', 'compelled', 'watch', 'movie', 'different', 'perspective', 'portion', 'same', 'period', 'most', 'American', 'schoolchildren', 'familiarity', 'crossing', 'Delaware', 'Trenton', 'was', 'limited', 'famous', 'painting', 'event', 'General', 'Washington', 'perched', 'imperiously', 'prow', 'boat', 'being', 'rowed', 'icy', 'waters', 'dead', 'night', 'reality', 'was', 'decidedly', 'less', 'cinematic', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'made-for-television', 'treatment', 'Admittedly', 'was', 'spoiled', 'superior', 'production', 'values', 'John', 'Adams', 'beside', 'production', 'favor', 'present', 'grittier', 'version', 'life', 'Continental', 'Army', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'much', 'humanize', 'deified', 'personage', 'Supreme', 'Commander', 'production', 'was', 'hobbled', 'obvious', 'budget', 'constraints', 'prosaic', 'camera', 'work', 'make', 'look', 'very', 'TV', 'project', 'was', 'decisive', 'battle', 'turned', 'Revolution', 'colonialists', 'favor', 'portrayed', 'little', 'more', 'skirmish', 'Washington', 'ragtag', 'band', 'volunteers', 'bunch', 'unsuspecting', 'drunks', 'Maybe', 'truth', 'was', 'amateur', 'look', 'production', 'nothing', 'elevate', 'action', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'noble', 'fate', 'Revolution', 'hinged', 'little', 'more', 'brawl', 'was', 'brawl', 'fledging', 'nation', 'desperately', 'needed', 'win', 'Washington', 'revealed', 'crafty', 'stratetician', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'risk', 'breathtaking', 'gamble', 'others', 'dimissed', 'insane', 'isolation', 'Washington', 'command', 'portrayed', 'numerous', 'references', 'utter', 'lack', 'support', 'Washington', 'very', 'body', 'had', 'authorized', 'carry', 'out', 'war', 'Citizens', 'Republic', 'present', 'day', 'may', 'take', 'comfort', 'not', 'knowledge', 'very', 'earliest', 'incarnation', 'Congress', 'honed', 'reputation', 'bunch', 'blow-hard', 'self-promoters', 'who', 'existed', 'endlessly', 'debate', 'not', 'act', 'Also', 'shown', 'in-fighting', 'Washington', 'generals', 'whom', 'resented', 'authority', 'cases', 'plotted', 'actively', 'undermine', 'Washington', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'successfully', ""'statue"", 'flesh', 'bone', 'wonderful', 'physicality', 'role', 'part', 'vigorous', 'devotion-inspiring', 'leader', 'prime', 'More', 'problematic', 'delivery', 'too', 'much', 'contemporary', 'Midwest', 'Daniels', 'Michigan', 'native', 'not', 'much', ""'gentleman"", 'Virginia', 'general', 'am', 'not', 'favor', 'American', 'actors', 'larding', 'up', 'dialogue', 'distracting', 'accents', 'Daniels', 'great', 'not', 'sound', 'convincing', 'Tidewater', 'aristocrat', 'contrast', 'mostly', 'British', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'elegant', 'diction', 'Daniels', 'rough-hewn', 'element', 'also', 'lines', 'very', 's-l-o-w-ly', 'one', 'hardly', 'Washington', 'heat', 'battle', 'life', 'Republic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'laconic', 'teleplay', 'Howard', 'Fast', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'tin', 'ear', 'authentically', 'colonial-sounding', 'dialogue', 'many', '20th', 'century', 'anarchronisms', 'creeping', 'greatest', 'obstacle', 'actors', 'worthwhile', 'moments', 'content', 'stylistically', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'subject']",The Crossing VHS

The film brings to the screen George Washington's first victory during the American Revolution: The Battle of Trenton.It is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British.  Chased by government forces, the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief, but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army (once numbering 20,000, now at 2,000 and dwindling).  Subsequently, Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice: does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come, or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton, which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen?The Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History. Specifically:We get a taste (though a very light one) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g. when the foundry's owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats (before they were in turn confiscated).Moreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught... and yet not so much about the merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain, which another film, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, portrays so well.The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown, just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies/mercenaries, which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film; but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc, favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee), as well as the problems between Congress and the Army (there are the subtlest of hints for the latter/Ral's sword sent to Congress).There is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support (enlistment being at a minimum, while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting), and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals ""alive,"" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain, and win the war.Therefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden ""under the carpet.""As a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of ""patriotism.""The only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor.As for the end where it states that: ""The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists.""  That should be ""...to fight the rebel colonists,"" not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1/3 each, of the total colonist populace.In short, The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.Strongly recommended, especially for History buffs, along with Revolution starring Al Pacino, and Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer. 4.5 Stars",5,"""In the end, sir, we all kill for profit""",1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,3933,"['Patriot', 'was', 'purely', 'made', 'propaganda', 'purposes', 'Crossing', 'much', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'realistic', 'effect', 'more', 'truthful', 'account', 'events', 'American', 'War', 'Independence', '1775-1783', 'film', 'screen', 'George', 'Washington', 'first', 'victory', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Battle', 'Trenton.It', 'December', '1776', 'Continentals', 'have', 'yet', 'score', 'victory', 'British', 'Chased', 'government', 'forces', 'rebels', 'find', 'exhausted', 'banks', 'Delaware', 'river', 'General', 'George', 'Washington', 'remaining', 'Commander-in-Chief', 'now', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Continental', 'Army', 'once', 'numbering', '20,000', 'now', '2,000', 'dwindling', 'Subsequently', 'Washington', 'faced', 'yet', 'difficult', 'choice', 'camp', 'winter', 'hope', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'rank', 'army', 'spring', 'come', 'surprise-attack', 'city', 'Trenton', 'hands', '1200', 'crack', 'German', 'troops', 'Hessen', 'Crossing', 'valuable', 'insight', 'very', 'important', 'period', 'American', 'British', 'History', 'Specifically', 'get', 'taste', 'very', 'light', 'one', 'different', 'attitudes', 'mentality', 'English', 'North', 'American', 'colonists', 'war', 'e.g', 'when', 'foundry', 'owner', 'refused', 'let', 'Continentals', 'use', 'boats', 'were', 'turn', 'confiscated', '.Moreover', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'double-crossing', 'generals', 'such', 'General', 'Lee', 'allowed', 'be', 'caught', 'yet', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'merchants', 'farmers', 'politicians', 'supported', 'side', 'wind', 'happened', 'be', 'blowing', 'always', 'search', 'profit', 'personal', 'gain', 'film', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor', 'so', 'well.The', 'clash', 'Loyalist', 'American', 'English', 'Continental', 'American', 'English', 'not', 'really', 'shown', 'just', 'one', 'Continentals', 'British', 'Hessen', 'allies/mercenaries', 'nonetheless', 'fascinating', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'film', 'then', 'so', 'clash', 'Continental', 'side', 'undermining', 'personality', 'clashes-Washington', 'vs', 'Gates', 'Lee', 'etc', 'favoritism-the', 'contingency', 'plan', 'having', 'Sullivan', 'arrest', 'Lee', 'as', 'well', 'problems', 'Congress', 'Army', 'are', 'subtlest', 'hints', 'latter/Ral', 'sword', 'sent', 'Congress', 'also', 'brave', 'admission', 'G.', 'Washington', 'Continentals', 'lack', 'public', 'support', 'enlistment', 'being', 'minimum', 'trying', 'keep', 'minutemen', 'deserting', 'important', 'role', 'Washington', 'played', 'Revolution', 'keeping', 'Continentals', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'French', '1778', 'Spaniards', '1779', 'Dutch', '1780', 'enter', 'war', 'Great', 'Britain', 'win', 'war.Therefore', 'movie', 'successfully', 'light', 'aspects', 'American', 'History', 'would', 'rather', 'keep', 'hidden', 'carpet', 'result', 'Crossing', 'daring', 'movie', 'more', 'few', 'misconceptions', 'deliberate', 'not', 'surrounding', 'attitudes', 'War', 'Independence', 'historical', 'truths', 'had', 'been', 'suppressed', 'long', 'years', 'name', 'patriotism', 'only', 'major', 'setback', 'relation', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'not', 'great', 'role', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Washington', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor.As', 'end', 'where', 'records', 'show', 'total', '16,992', 'Hessians', 'were', 'brought', 'America', 'fight', 'colonists', 'should', 'be', 'fight', 'rebel', 'colonists', 'not', 'forgetting', 'Loyalists', 'Neutrals', 'made', 'up', 'approximately', '1/3', 'total', 'colonist', 'populace.In', 'short', 'Crossing', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection.Strongly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'History', 'buffs', 'Revolution', 'starring', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor', 'starring', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', '4.5', 'Stars']",The Crossing VHS
4010,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0767023765,Linda Linguvic,"[20, 26]","This is a made-for-TV movie produced by the A&amp;E television network in 2001.  It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey.I recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost.But Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions.Jeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well.Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.

We see the broken remnants of the Continental army as it races to avoid capture following their defeats in New York.  The British, close on the heels of the retreating rebels, have written the Americans off as being on the verge of total surrender. Washington, tired and beaten, realizes that he must make one last attempt to achieve victory or all hope for the revolution will be lost.  Against the judgement of his officers, Washington prepares to launch a desperate offensive against a large force of Hessian troops occupying the town of Trenton, just across the Delaware River in New Jersey. The future of the new United States hangs in the balance as the rag-tag army bets all or nothing on this dangerous gamble.

Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.I enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.The sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.There is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes. The battle is not particularly bloody or violent, but would probably be PG if rated. It would make a nice addition to a homeschool history curriculum as well as the family video library.

4018,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,0767023765,Paul Sayles,"[4, 4]","The Crossing is about a small action that became a pivotal point in the American Revolution, the American assault on German mercinary troops in Trenton, NJ.  What struck me was not the audacity of Washington attacking in the dead of winter, but the cooperation of his subordinates that was need to even make this action remotely possible.  This is an ensemble performance that centers around Washington but shows the synergistec effect that was needed to make the attack work.Jeff Daniels is excellent as Washington pulling his dispirited troops together for a decisive action.  Washington was taking a great risk, maybe the biggest of his career; by making a winter attack.  Armies of this time, rarely, if ever, fought in the winter and Washington was going against convention by doing so.  He was also conducting an amphibious operation which is one of the hardest operations to perform in warfare.  Here the cooperation of others was critical.  If the men under Colonel John Glover were unable/unwilling to give their all, Washington might just as well have stayed in camp.  No boats, no action fairly well sums it up.  Washington's troops could have muddled through and affected a crossing, but the element of surprise, I am sure would have been lost and no surprise meant a harder and more doubtful battle.  Glover is the true unsung hero of the battle and it is good to see him recognized as such.This film abounds in small points.  The depiction of the Pennsylvania German troops in Washington's command is well done. The state of mind of Washington's troops, ofter overlooked, is shown in great detail.  The use of period sites also was a big plus in the making of this film.In all, I found this one of the best films about Washington's attack on Trenton and one that gives a new impression of the compexity in executing this battle.

And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic.

In fact the acting by the entire cast is uniformly good throughout. Despite his dedication and patriotism, Washington had surprisingly little military experience before taking command and had to learn as the revolution evolved. Trenton was his first real battlefield success. Washington came very close to losing his army; and we came very close to losing the Revolution in 1776. It was mostly due to Washington's determination and daring that we were able to continue fighting instead of going down to an inglorious defeat.

Compare this movie to say something like Mel Gibson's PATRIOT and you have the difference between quality and trash!  The movie conveys the feeling and desperation of Washy's army on its last legs before striking back at Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a spirted but probably false impression of Washy.  In reality the man was much more stiff and proper than is shown here.  Washy would never use such language in front of the common soldiers!  He rarely lost his temper as well, otherwise the famous tongue lashing of Charles Lee at Monmouth two years later would never have created such a sensation as it did.  Daniels makes Washy much more likeable to the modern audience, but is an flawed portrayal.The production value of this film is first-rate.  Obviously period re-enactors were used and their dedication to the hobby shows in the correct formations, drills, etc.  The brief skirmish at the beginning with the British probably did not happen so close to the Delaware like that.  Also, the uniforms for the British appear off somehow.  They look like an earlier period, not the 1770s.  Still, it works.  The Hessians are well portrayed, although it would have provided variety if some Musketeer's with their tri-corn hats were shown.  Not all of Rall's men were Grenadiers and Fusiliers!American losses were actually 2 dead from the march, and 4 wounded from the fight, including Hamilton and Monroe, the latter a future US President!  I don't know why the movie did not convey this.  The effects of Knox's artillery seems also much exaggerated.  Solid shot and cannister was used, not explosive shells as shown here.  Most films on this period fail to show artillery accurately in that regard.  Still, the acting and mood of the film are right on the mark which makes it easily the best Rev War production out there. Too bad it did not go further to show Washy's next great triumph at Princeton where a small British detachment gave him a much harder run for his money.  Still, what we have here is a nice concise work that comes close to converying the actual history of the event.  This is more than most Hollywood productions do these days.

Based on my somewhat limited reading (Richard Kethchum's &quot;The Winter Soldiers&quot;), this movie delivers reasonably well. More so, the most truly important aspect of history movies, in my opinion, is the context and how well this given period is presented...in essence, how deeply does the viewer feel involved? This is the issue that makes this movie stand out. Watching this, I felt all the emotions that Washington appeared to go through (desperation, frustration, exhileration upon smashing the Hessians at Trenton...) and just  marveled at the &quot;period&quot; depiction. I really felt that this was what it was like in 1776 Pennsylvania and New Jersey (volunteers with no uniforms or warm clothes...some even without shoes in the dead of winter...). Washington's character was well played by Jeff Daniels as he portrayed the important leadership qualities that made him a legend and founding father. Daniels &quot;playing&quot; Washington also managed to come across as somewhat flawed (i.e. &quot;human&quot;...) while giving a semblance of Washington's major desperation.

As if this wasn't bad enough, it was winter, and most of Washington's demoralized troops had only days left to their enlistment contracts.With the Revolution on the verge of collapse, General Washington needed a victory, ...immediately.At this point in American History, ...America, OUR nation, was dangerously close to never HAVING a history. This was, quite possibly, the most critical moment in the story of America. The man who signifigantly changed our national destiny at this moment in time, was George Washington.So how did General Washington save the Revolution from collapse? The story is portrayed most excellently in this movie!General Washington received intelligence that a regiment of German Hessian mercenaries had made winter-quarters in Trenton, New Jersey. The troops from Hess were considered amongst the very best of professional soldiers in Europe. They had already inflicted severe defeats upon the Revolutionaries earlier that year. It was a long shot, with what limited resources he had under his command, ...but Washington realized that he just might have a chance at a much-needed victory, ...if all went as planned. Surely he did not expect his operation to result in one of the most one-sided victories in military history!Washington made his proposal to his subordinates. Most of them were vehemently opposed to the operation, given all the factors involved. The weather was abyssmal, intense cold and freezing rain. To get to Trenton, they had to cross the Delaware River, which was already full of large chunks of ice, and a limited quantity of boats.Despite the various obstacles, they adapted, improvised, and overcame.They moved their ragged, starving, inexperienced army across the water, marching all night, cold and drenched to the bone! Many of these fellows didn't have shoes. It rained most of the way. The gun-powder was too wet to fire their rifles and muskets. Only the artillery had dry powder, ...which they used to great effect.This factor makes the nature of this victory at Trenton even more amazing:The Revolutionary army fixed bayonets, and rushed the town, KILLING the much more proficient enemy at CLOSE-QUARTERS! The completely surprised Hessian troops had just spent the previous night drunkenly carousing and feasting on Christmas Eve. Not one of them expected to be impaled by bayonets in the morning! Not one Revolutionary soldier was killed or injured in the attack on Trenton! Needless to say, ...this victory had the desired result on American morale.The man who delivered this Christmas Present to America was OUR Founding Father, ...George Washington!He succeeded because he was assisted by REAL MEN who were determined to accomplish this mission.The real signifigance of this movie:There have been several moments in the history of America, at home and abroad, where the nation faced seemingly overwhelming enemies, and abyssmally dire circumstances. This film portrays one of the first of such incidents. REAL AMERICANS take action. They lock and load, fix bayonets, ...and by the grace of God force a glorious victory from what was presumed to be an ""inevitable"" defeat. Be thankful that we had a REAL AMERICAN in command on Christmas Day of 1776!",5,The right man at the critical moment.,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,3770,"['December', '1776', 'Revolution', 'thus', 'far', 'was', 'disaster.For', 'twelve', 'months', 'first', 'American', 'patriots', 'had', 'endured', 'very', 'little', 'success', 'British', 'being', 'out-classed', 'routed', 'battlefield', 'almost', 'engagement', 'Desertion', 'was', 'rampant', 'Arms', 'ammunition', 'rations', 'were', 'scarce', 'Only', 'small', 'number', 'Revolutionaries', 'had', 'military', 'experience.Even', 'worse', 'was', 'usual', 'warfare', '20th', 'century', 'epidemic', 'diseases', 'were', 'major', 'cause', 'casualties', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'living', 'together', 'open', 'unsanitary', 'conditions', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'was', 'winter', 'most', 'Washington', 'demoralized', 'troops', 'had', 'only', 'days', 'left', 'enlistment', 'Revolution', 'verge', 'collapse', 'General', 'Washington', 'needed', 'victory', 'immediately.At', 'point', 'American', 'History', 'America', 'OUR', 'nation', 'was', 'dangerously', 'close', 'never', 'HAVING', 'history', 'was', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'critical', 'moment', 'story', 'America', 'man', 'who', 'signifigantly', 'changed', 'national', 'destiny', 'moment', 'time', 'was', 'George', 'Washington.So', 'how', 'did', 'General', 'Washington', 'save', 'Revolution', 'collapse', 'story', 'portrayed', 'most', 'excellently', 'movie', 'General', 'Washington', 'received', 'intelligence', 'regiment', 'German', 'Hessian', 'mercenaries', 'had', 'made', 'winter-quarters', 'Trenton', 'New', 'Jersey', 'troops', 'Hess', 'were', 'considered', 'very', 'best', 'professional', 'soldiers', 'Europe', 'had', 'already', 'inflicted', 'severe', 'defeats', 'Revolutionaries', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'long', 'shot', 'what', 'limited', 'resources', 'had', 'command', 'Washington', 'realized', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'much-needed', 'victory', 'went', 'planned', 'Surely', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'operation', 'result', 'one', 'most', 'one-sided', 'victories', 'military', 'history', 'Washington', 'made', 'proposal', 'subordinates', 'Most', 'were', 'vehemently', 'opposed', 'operation', 'given', 'factors', 'involved', 'weather', 'was', 'abyssmal', 'intense', 'cold', 'freezing', 'rain', 'get', 'Trenton', 'had', 'cross', 'Delaware', 'River', 'was', 'already', 'full', 'large', 'chunks', 'ice', 'limited', 'quantity', 'various', 'obstacles', 'adapted', 'improvised', 'overcame.They', 'moved', 'ragged', 'starving', 'inexperienced', 'army', 'water', 'marching', 'night', 'cold', 'drenched', 'bone', 'Many', 'fellows', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'shoes', 'rained', 'most', 'way', 'gun-powder', 'was', 'too', 'wet', 'fire', 'rifles', 'muskets', 'Only', 'artillery', 'had', 'dry', 'powder', 'used', 'great', 'effect.This', 'factor', 'nature', 'victory', 'Trenton', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'Revolutionary', 'army', 'fixed', 'bayonets', 'rushed', 'town', 'KILLING', 'much', 'more', 'proficient', 'enemy', 'CLOSE-QUARTERS', 'completely', 'surprised', 'Hessian', 'troops', 'had', 'just', 'spent', 'previous', 'night', 'drunkenly', 'carousing', 'feasting', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Not', 'one', 'expected', 'be', 'impaled', 'bayonets', 'morning', 'Not', 'one', 'Revolutionary', 'soldier', 'was', 'killed', 'injured', 'attack', 'Trenton', 'Needless', 'say', 'victory', 'had', 'desired', 'result', 'American', 'morale.The', 'man', 'who', 'delivered', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'America', 'was', 'OUR', 'Founding', 'Father', 'George', 'Washington', 'succeeded', 'was', 'assisted', 'REAL', 'MEN', 'who', 'were', 'determined', 'accomplish', 'mission.The', 'real', 'signifigance', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'moments', 'history', 'America', 'home', 'abroad', 'where', 'nation', 'faced', 'seemingly', 'overwhelming', 'enemies', 'abyssmally', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'film', 'one', 'first', 'such', 'incidents', 'REAL', 'AMERICANS', 'take', 'action', 'lock', 'load', 'fix', 'bayonets', 'grace', 'God', 'force', 'glorious', 'victory', 'what', 'was', 'presumed', 'be', 'inevitable', 'defeat', 'Be', 'thankful', 'had', 'REAL', 'AMERICAN', 'command', 'Christmas', 'Day', '1776']",The Crossing VHS
