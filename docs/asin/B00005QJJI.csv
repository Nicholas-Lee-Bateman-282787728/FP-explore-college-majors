675479,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005QJJI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","Bloodfight has to be the most depressing martial arts film I've ever seen.  This thing throws on the sackcloth and rolls around in the ashes for a while.  Sure, the dramatic events that unfold set the stage for an unlikely comeback by Kai against the younger and all but invincible Chong Lee (Bolo Yeung), but you're not going to come away from Bloodfight with a smile on your face.  That's not to say there's no entertainment value to the film, though.  Kai's recruitment of Ryu is laughably absurd, and a good bit of unintentional humor can easily be found in the movie's dialogue - which is filmed in bad English to begin with, thus saving Western distributors the chore of badly dubbing the film themselves.Yasuaki Kurata plays Masahiro Kai, a former champion of the World Championship free-fighting tournament (which actually takes place in a dark and seedy gym on some back street in Hong Kong).  A shadow of his former self, Kai runs a ridiculously poor excuse of a gym in hopes of finding a prot&eacute;g&eacute; who can follow in his fading footsteps.  After his wife leaves him, he seems to get pretty desperate, recruiting a mean and undisciplined local hooligan as his student.  I'm not sure how a white dude comes to lead a gang in Hong Kong, especially one as incredibly gay as this one, but the bigger mystery is why Kai would watch a gang of hoodlums terrorize an innocent young lady and then offer to train the guy responsible.  Not surprisingly, this little mentor relationship doesn't work out very well - but it does lead him to another young prospect named Ryu Tenmei (Simon Yam).  This young man has no desire to train and compete, and the very idea frightens his hot girlfriend to death.  Of course, he does end up competing in the big tournament, and let's just say the experience ends pretty badly.The big fight scene at the end isn't bad at all, but there's a whole lot of bad movie to wade through in order to get that far.  By the midpoint of Bloodfight, I was thinking this was quite possibly the worst martial arts movie I had ever seen.  The story had gone from boring to downright laughable, the film editor had seemingly thrown in bunches of short and insignificant scenes for apparently no reason, and all of the characters were pretty hard to like.  The emotional intensity of the second half of the film definitely leaves an impression on the viewer, though.  This isn't the kind of Saturday afternoon matinee film you pop in for ninety minutes of great fun watching crazy kung fu action.  Unless you're a real martial arts fan junkie or a fan of Bolo Yeung, you and Bloodfight need never cross one another's paths.",2,You won't get many kicks out of this sad and depressing martial arts film,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,2651,"['Bloodfight', 'be', 'most', 'depressing', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'thing', 'sackcloth', 'rolls', 'ashes', 'while', 'Sure', 'dramatic', 'events', 'unfold', 'set', 'stage', 'unlikely', 'comeback', 'Kai', 'younger', 'invincible', 'Chong', 'Lee', 'Bolo', 'Yeung', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'come', 'away', 'Bloodfight', 'smile', 'face', 'not', 'say', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'though', 'Kai', 'recruitment', 'Ryu', 'laughably', 'absurd', 'good', 'bit', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'filmed', 'bad', 'English', 'begin', 'thus', 'saving', 'Western', 'distributors', 'chore', 'badly', 'dubbing', 'film', 'themselves.Yasuaki', 'Kurata', 'Masahiro', 'Kai', 'former', 'champion', 'World', 'Championship', 'free-fighting', 'tournament', 'actually', 'place', 'dark', 'seedy', 'gym', 'back', 'street', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'Kai', 'ridiculously', 'poor', 'excuse', 'gym', 'hopes', 'finding', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'who', 'can', 'follow', 'fading', 'footsteps', 'wife', 'get', 'pretty', 'desperate', 'recruiting', 'mean', 'undisciplined', 'local', 'hooligan', 'student', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'white', 'dude', 'lead', 'gang', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'especially', 'one', 'incredibly', 'gay', 'one', 'bigger', 'mystery', 'why', 'Kai', 'would', 'watch', 'gang', 'hoodlums', 'terrorize', 'innocent', 'young', 'lady', 'then', 'offer', 'train', 'guy', 'responsible', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'mentor', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'lead', 'young', 'prospect', 'named', 'Ryu', 'Tenmei', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'young', 'man', 'desire', 'train', 'compete', 'very', 'idea', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'death', 'course', 'end', 'up', 'competing', 'big', 'tournament', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'experience', 'pretty', 'badly.The', 'big', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', ""n't"", 'bad', 'whole', 'lot', 'bad', 'movie', 'wade', 'order', 'get', 'far', 'midpoint', 'Bloodfight', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'had', 'gone', 'boring', 'downright', 'laughable', 'film', 'editor', 'had', 'seemingly', 'thrown', 'bunches', 'short', 'insignificant', 'scenes', 'apparently', 'reason', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'hard', 'like', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'definitely', 'impression', 'viewer', 'though', ""n't"", 'kind', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'matinee', 'film', 'pop', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'great', 'fun', 'watching', 'crazy', 'kung', 'fu', 'action', ""'re"", 'real', 'martial', 'arts', 'fan', 'junkie', 'fan', 'Bolo', 'Yeung', 'Bloodfight', 'need', 'never', 'cross', 'one', 'paths']",N/A

675481,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00005QJJI,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","Bloodfight is a pretty horrible low budget movie.  The fights look bad, the acting is painful, the directing is weak, the editing is crappy, and the sound and picture quailty are equivilant to an asian movie made in the late 60's.  Good news, the story is actually somewhat original, and if done with a bigger budget, this movie could have had a decent impact.Bloodfight's story at first is similar to that of Bloodsport, which was only made about a year earlier than Bloodfight.  In fact, Bloodfight could possibly be a continuation.  Again the world famous kumite is held in H.K., and fighters from around the world assemble, including Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) who was in Bloodsport.  I am assuming it is even the same Chong Li character, since that is the name the fans chant during his fights.  A sensai played by Yasuaki Kurata (Fist of Legend) was champion of the kumite 10 years ago, and wants to train a student to defeat Chong Li.  His obsession hurts his relationship with his wife, and blindly accepts an American punk for a student.  He fortunately discovers an Asian with more talent and discipline and uses him instead.  Thinking this new student can defeat Chong Li, he gets killed instead, and the sensai becomes a depressed drunk.  The students former girlfriend convinces the sensai to train to become a champion once again.I can say that is the only part of Bloodfight I found intriguing.  The fights are plenty, but look really bad.  The last fight between sensai and Li lasts a good 7 minutes.  Its the best fight of the movie, but thats not saying much.  Everything else the movie offers is weak and annoyingly bad.  Put it aside and you got a little treat (if you can understand the muttered English these actors try to speak).I guess you could say this is one to add to your Bolo collection.  Again, he plays the villain, which he does in most of his movies.

Perhaps a self-ripoff might be a more appropriate term.  If one were to compare BLOODFIGHT to BLOODSPORT, then the comparisons stand out, even apart from the titles.  Both star Bolo as the Bad Guy who seeks to defend his title in the kumite.  Both involve a young fighter who is trained by a grizzled veteran.  And both feature a number of preliminary bouts that are at least as interesting as the featured fight.  The primary difference is that the young fighter bows out of the film by the midpoint and his place is taken by his sensei.  The actors speak in sloooow English and the acting is abysmal.  Bolo may look tough but he speaks English in a voice that does not do justice to the word ""muffled."" The plot is paper mache thin and serves only to lead to the climax.

675486,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005QJJI,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","""Bloodfight"" belongs to a handful of Hong Kong features made during this era of the late-80s/early-90s designed to appeal to western audiences. It's also the only film in the middle of its respective decade to feature Japanese-born Hong Kong stalwart Yasuaki Kurata in a starring role, which is likely the reason it remains one of only a handful of features Kurata produced himself. It's an interesting exercise in awkwardness, far from boring, but certainly no martial arts masterpiece, especially if you're hoping for the Hong Kong standard of the time.The story: a disgraced martial arts instructor (Kurata,Fist of Legend), suffering from a series of professional and personal defeats, must regain his honor in the realm of underground fighting.Kurata is simultaneously one of the most versatile and respected performers of the kung fu  cinema scene, and here, he tops off a unique little collection of Hong Kong stars, including Simon Yam (Election), Meg Lam (Enter the Fat Dragon), John Ladalski (Operation Condor 2: The Armour of God), Stuart Smith (The Ultimate Ninja), and the singular Bolo Yeung, who's more or less reprising his role of the obsessive champion fromBloodsport- he even has the same name! However, while I like the over-the-top jerk-villain Stuart Smith plays so well, the rest of the cast can't help but feel mis-utilized: for all his talent and future acclaim, Simon Yam isn't exactly cut out for his role as the fighting lamb being led to slaughter, and the rest of the characters don't exactly have large roles, most noticeably, Bolo Yeung, whose advertisement as the star on the film cover is extremely misleading. Kurata-san sort of works as a Chow Yun-Fat -style screwup character, but it's more fun seeing him player a villain or a wise master than a bumbling drunk. Additionally, it doesn't help that virtually the entire Asian cast exhibits a degree of discomfort with the English language, which is predominant throughout the feature.The fight content ranges between average and pretty good, though examples of the latter are mostly confined to the first quarter of the picture. The opening five minutes give you the impression that this is going to be a good old underground tournament flick, as anonymous fighters of varying styles - including a sumo wrestler and a monkey kung fu practitioner - square off in succession. The rest of the film is a quasi-Kickboxer/Rockytale, with fights popping up every now and again. There's no real wire fu at work, with an unknown choreographer (possibly Kurata-san himself) preferring a more grounded, western style of hand-to-hand exchange with relatively limited cutting. I generally like this style, but none of the fights actually blow you away. They all build up to an emotional finale between Kurata and Bolo, who had fought on film at least once before and with hopefully better results than here: Bolo refuses to sell convincingly, to the point that the outcome of the fight is completely inexplicable.The production quality fluctuates from serviceable to occasionally being extremely cheap: as a matter of fact, the opening shot of the picture taken by a shaky handheld camera filming an airplane from behind an airport fence (didn't they have the funds for a permit inside the airport?). This won't break the film, though, of which you'll develop a fairly constant opinion of shortly thereafter. Of course, is the movie's faults sound like things you won't be able to abide or aren't a total Yasuaki Kurata fan, there's no point picking this one up. Casual viewers experimenting with all the diverse levels of quality Hong Kong flicks aspire to could do worse.",3,"""Nooo!
