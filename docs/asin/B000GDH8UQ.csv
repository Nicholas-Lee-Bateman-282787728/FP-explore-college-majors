1002086,A2ERGXW7ONBVLQ,B000GDH8UQ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",My father called me out to the living room about three years ago to see something on the TV. This was it. He and my mother said they had watched this as children. I love everything about Christmas so this was a treat for me. I was 22 at that time. It kind of has a magical feel about it. So when I saw that Amazon actually offered it I had to have it. You never know if they'll stop airing it each year. It will be fun to show my kids one day.,5,So happy,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,443,"['father', 'called', 'living', 'room', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'see', 'something', 'TV', 'was', 'mother', 'said', 'had', 'watched', 'children', 'love', 'everything', 'Christmas', 'was', 'treat', 'was', '22', 'time', 'kind', 'magical', 'feel', 'when', 'saw', 'Amazon', 'actually', 'offered', 'had', 'have', 'never', 'know', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'airing', 'year', 'will', 'be', 'fun', 'show', 'kids', 'one', 'day']",N/A

For our family, it was THE Christmas show of its day.  No Christmas season was complete without seeing it at least one time.  In half an hour we young viewers anticipated the joys of a visit from Santa Claus, followed by a reverent telling of the birth of Jesus.  In the intervening years since this program used to air, many more sophisticated Christmas shows came along to become our favorites.  I was very happy, though, to be reunited with this reminder of simpler, happy times when my brother gave me a VHS copy recorded from his local PBS station some years ago.  Now I am very pleased about this DVD release, which will preserve the program for future generations.  Thanks for making it available, Amazon!",5,"I'm unsure how broad this DVD's appeal would be, but if you were a kid in the 1950s in the Philadelphia area...",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,806,"['way', 'reconnect', 'what', 'were', 'hopefully', 'fondest', 'Christmas', 'memories', 'family', 'was', 'THE', 'Christmas', 'show', 'day', 'No', 'Christmas', 'season', 'was', 'complete', 'seeing', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'hour', 'young', 'viewers', 'anticipated', 'joys', 'visit', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'followed', 'reverent', 'telling', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'intervening', 'years', 'program', 'used', 'air', 'many', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Christmas', 'shows', 'came', 'along', 'become', 'favorites', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'though', 'be', 'reunited', 'reminder', 'simpler', 'happy', 'times', 'when', 'brother', 'gave', 'VHS', 'copy', 'recorded', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'preserve', 'program', 'future', 'generations', 'Thanks', 'making', 'available', 'Amazon']",N/A

Every year I try to find one worthy enough to add to my collection and this little special fits the bill.I discovered the movie on a site called TV Party and after reading the short blurb on the site and viewing the screen cap that was included, my curiosity was piqued. So I went over to youtube to sample it, as I do with most films before buying them, and I instantly fell in love with its simplistic charm. The puppetry is primitive in a sense and yet brilliant for the time this was produced. Its very nostalgic, before the age of cgi and all those distracting special effects. From a gentler, simpler time.I especially enjoyed the nativity segment and bought it just for that. Though there have been hundreds maybe even thousands of yuletide movies made since the dawn of cinema, there are few that touch on the nativity story. Even though the nativity segment is a mere 15 minutes, its the best interpretation I've ever seen.",5,INSTANT FAVORITE,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,1064,"['am', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'Christmas', 'fanatic', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'year', 'long', 'have', 'extensive', 'collection', 'holiday', 'films', 'year', 'try', 'find', 'one', 'worthy', 'enough', 'add', 'collection', 'little', 'special', 'bill.I', 'discovered', 'movie', 'site', 'called', 'TV', 'Party', 'reading', 'short', 'blurb', 'site', 'viewing', 'screen', 'cap', 'was', 'included', 'curiosity', 'was', 'piqued', 'went', 'youtube', 'sample', 'do', 'most', 'films', 'buying', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'simplistic', 'charm', 'puppetry', 'primitive', 'sense', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'time', 'was', 'produced', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'age', 'cgi', 'distracting', 'special', 'effects', 'gentler', 'simpler', 'time.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'nativity', 'segment', 'bought', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'hundreds', 'maybe', 'even', 'thousands', 'yuletide', 'movies', 'made', 'dawn', 'cinema', 'are', 'few', 'touch', 'nativity', 'story', 'Even', 'nativity', 'segment', 'mere', '15', 'minutes', 'best', 'interpretation', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

As a child, these two shows featuring marionettes were the defining opening of the holiday season.  I remember each year seeing these in front of a large black and white television set.  I noticed as a child, as soon as the first time the Charlie Brown christmas was shown, which was followed by a slew of other similiar programs, that these classics dissapeared.  Not only was I happy to find these were available, but the extras that came with it were very enjoyable.

I never thought I'd see it again. I agree with another review which lamented the cuts, removing the commercials for the telephone company. I seem to remember it ending with a telephone operator (w/ a vintage headset) encircled by a big Christmas wreath, wishing us all a Merry Christmas. The transfer doesn't seem quite as sharp and vivid as it did in that creaky old auditorium fifty years ago, but this was quite a find nevertheless. The addition of another puppet film by the same folks is a nice bonus (I'd never seen it).",4,Nostalgia Trip,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,638,"['Yea', 'big', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'used', 'show', 'grade', 'school', 'attended', 'late', '50', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'again', 'agree', 'review', 'lamented', 'cuts', 'removing', 'commercials', 'telephone', 'company', 'seem', 'remember', 'ending', 'telephone', 'operator', 'w/', 'vintage', 'headset', 'encircled', 'big', 'Christmas', 'wreath', 'wishing', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'sharp', 'vivid', 'did', 'creaky', 'old', 'auditorium', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'quite', 'find', 'nevertheless', 'addition', 'puppet', 'film', 'same', 'folks', 'nice', 'bonus', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen']",N/A
