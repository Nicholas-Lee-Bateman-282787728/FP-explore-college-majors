399367,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304078099,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[18, 19]","What a beautiful family drama this film was!  Not only did director Ulu Grosbard give us this story about two sisters and the struggles between them, but also he gave it to us (with the help of writer Barbara Turner) with a surprising twist that you do not see in everyday cinema.  Here is a story that is brutally honest and exceptionally real to anyone involved.  On the top layer you have a sister trying to compete with the popularity of the other, on another layer you have a troubled spirit controlled by substance abuse, and yet on another layer (and they keep going), you have this sister which isn't a good singer more passionate about the craft than the one that has an ever growing fan base.  Wow.  With this much structure and substance, you may think that it could get wrapped around itself relatively easy and eventually loose the potential that it has.  Well, if you were thinking that ... you would be wrong.  Georgia is able to keep us guessing and wanting more from each passing frame.  From the tight character work by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham to the powerfully emotional story of sisterhood, this movie will keep you enthralled until the final scene, which will literally knock you off your seat.I must applaud Jennifer Jason Leigh because I have never been as impressed with her performance as I was as her turn as Sadie Flood.  From her passionate portrayal of Sadie to the ability to capture every word with crisp emotion and distinction, Leigh takes every scene and makes it her last.  She is brilliant and honest at the same time.  She gives so much to the camera and to the role that you move away from that feeling of watching a movie and handed that sensation of being allowed into someone's private life.  This feeling could be because the events that happened on screen were ""real"" to those involved due to the semi-biographical story penned by Barbara Turner.  This was also filmed during a time when Miramax was actually making thought-provoking films that featured nobodies giving us performances of a lifetime.  While Leigh had worked before, the other breakout of this film was the title character, Georgia.  While screen-time with her was considerably shorter than Leigh, it was her strong bond with Sadie that allowed Mare Winningham to even be nominated for an Oscar in 1996.  While I to believe that she did deserve it, apparently the Oscar ballots felt that Mira Sorvino was better.  Can you hear me shudder?  I can honestly say that the reason that this film was such a powerful film about music and family was due greatly to these two anchor actresses giving us more than 100% and pulling at the strings of our hearts.  We all know what it is like to have a family member succeed faster than another, and it is difficult.  It is also perfectly portrayed by Leigh and Winningham.Outside of the acting, if you can really keep your eyes on anything else, to fully submerge yourself in this film, you have to listen to the music.  While others will argue that it is nothing more than just a secondary ploy to demonstrate the unequal balance between the sisters.  I really thought that the songs were what connected these two.  There was some equality between them.  As I watched this film, and listened to the music, I couldn't help but think that perhaps these two women were one in the same.  Think about it.  Here you have one, Leigh, who cannot sing, but leads the clich&eacute;d singer lifestyle.  She is very nomadic, very experimental, and extremely passionate about the craft.  While she may not be able to sing exceptionally well, she does harbor this passion that seems to be lacking from the other sister, Winningham.  While, on Winningham's side, she has this voice that will pack auditoriums, though she lives a very quaint life with a family and a house.  It always felt that Winningham's gift was a burden to her, and she would have rather had the simple life and handed it all over to Leigh ... but she doesn't.  That passion to perform is relevant in both sisters, which made me feel we were watching the same person just cut in half.The only negative aspect that I felt hurt this film from reaching perfection was the timing.  The script was great, phenomenal actually, but there were just moments when I felt that either the direction or the timing was off.  The entire plane scene (which was my second favorite of the film) was brilliant, yet a bit far fetched for my belief.  It was great to see Leigh completely break down in order to get to her sister, but the zaniness of it all was a bit overwhelming.  Also, I needed some pre-information if possible.  We had one scene of the sisters when they were young that could have been expanded just a bit.  It would have been interesting to see when the two broke off and what really forced the two to choose the lifestyle that surrounded them.  The concept of Sadie riding on Georgia's coattails was relevant throughout the entire film, but more could have been expanded on it.  It wasn't until closer to the end when I completely realized what was happening in the beginning of the film.  Just some small housekeeping would have propelled this film into ""favorite"" land.Overall, I was shocked and delighted with this film.  The final scene of this film, which shows the repetitive nature of life, continues to roll around in my mind.  Leigh's performance was exceptionally raw and showcased her true talent.  The secondary characters in this film could have been a bit tighter (Axel was very flimsy because I wanted to know him better), but it didn't seem to destroy this picture at all.Grade: **** out of

399368,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304078099,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Friends of mine have often told me that Jennifer Jason Leigh was one of the greatest actresses to lack an Oscar nomination and I personally have found the statement laughable.  Outside of her devilishly great turn in `Single White Female', she's never impressed me.  I find her uneven, awkward and unconvincing.  Those same friends always fall back on this particular performance as a reason for their statement, and up until this past week I had not seen it.  Now, 1995 was a ridiculously strong year in this category (Oscar's lineup is possibly the best they've EVER had in this category) and so Leigh's exclusion, while balked at by fans, has never really been seen as a complete snub.  I mean, Shue, Sarandon, Streep, Thompson and Stone were all outstanding in their respective films and so it's hard to begrudge the lineup in any way.Still, I hadn't seen and so I couldn't judge for myself.`Georgia' is one of those films that helps me reevaluate my personal feelings on a particular actor or actress.  I was BLOWN AWAY by the intensity and honesty that Leigh brought to her portrayal of junkie wannabe singer Sadie Flood.  Oppressed by the fame and stability of her sister Georgia, Sadie is constantly putting up a front, covering her own fears and insecurities with alcohol and drugs as a mask, a way to shield herself from her own inevitability.  The tensions that arise when the sisters are together is beautifully conveyed, and it reeks of a rawness and honesty that few films of this nature can establish.This is less a film about music or a film about drug abuse or a film about familial tensions and more an amalgam of them all, and a fine one at that.  With star performances by the entire cast, most notably Leigh and Winningham (who was Oscar nominated), this film is anchored by a strength that can only be found in genuine passion.That final frame...chills!",5,Georgia rules...,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,1875,"['Friends', 'mine', 'have', 'often', 'told', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'lack', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'personally', 'have', 'found', 'statement', 'laughable', 'devilishly', 'great', 'turn', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', 'never', 'impressed', 'find', 'uneven', 'awkward', 'unconvincing', 'same', 'friends', 'always', 'fall', 'back', 'particular', 'performance', 'reason', 'statement', 'up', 'past', 'week', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Now', '1995', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'strong', 'year', 'category', 'Oscar', 'lineup', 'possibly', 'best', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'had', 'category', 'so', 'Leigh', 'exclusion', 'balked', 'fans', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'seen', 'complete', 'snub', 'mean', 'Shue', 'Sarandon', 'Streep', 'Thompson', 'Stone', 'were', 'outstanding', 'respective', 'films', 'hard', 'begrudge', 'lineup', 'way.Still', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'judge', 'myself.', 'Georgia', 'one', 'films', 'reevaluate', 'personal', 'feelings', 'particular', 'actor', 'actress', 'was', 'BLOWN', 'AWAY', 'intensity', 'honesty', 'Leigh', 'brought', 'portrayal', 'junkie', 'wannabe', 'singer', 'Sadie', 'Flood', 'Oppressed', 'fame', 'stability', 'sister', 'Georgia', 'Sadie', 'constantly', 'putting', 'up', 'front', 'covering', 'own', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'mask', 'way', 'shield', 'own', 'inevitability', 'tensions', 'arise', 'when', 'sisters', 'are', 'together', 'beautifully', 'conveyed', 'rawness', 'honesty', 'few', 'films', 'nature', 'can', 'establish.This', 'less', 'film', 'music', 'film', 'drug', 'abuse', 'film', 'familial', 'tensions', 'more', 'amalgam', 'fine', 'one', 'star', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Leigh', 'Winningham', 'who', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'film', 'anchored', 'strength', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'genuine', 'final', 'frame']",Georgia VHS

It's heartbreaking to watch JJ Leigh's Sadie manufacturing so much hope in believing in herself and her singing.  I identify more with Georgia's character because she has more or less the approval from the society.  At times I felt embarrassed for Sadie with her tryings and failures.  While 'normal folks' see Sadie as a talentless junkie, you have to give Sadie points for trying.  Music is a form of self-expression and is very subjective.  Nobody has the right to crush a musician's dream.  Both actresses gave nuanced performance.  Although JJ Leigh's got the flashier Sadie. Without Winningham's emotionally guarded Georgia, there's no contrast to Sadie's desperate plight.  The song ""No More Hard Times"" was so poignant to the story.  It broke my heart at the end of the film to see two sisters singing the same song at different settings.  You know both women had achieved an understanding for each other's path in life.

399370,A84UFSF2SZS2W,6304078099,"EriKa ""E""","[4, 6]","This is a slow-moving and somewhat heartbreaking story of a woman, Sadie Flood (played with very typical immersion by Jennifer Jason Leigh who also produced this film), who yearns to be a singer. She is, as her husband implores late in the film, so full of hope it almost kills you. She has so much heart, but she has almost no talent on top of the fact that she is such a drifter with such real problems (drinking and drug problems), that even if she had the kind of talent to make a career, she would not have the perseverance. The problem, above and beyond this, is her older sister, Georgia (a fine, subdued Mare Winningham), who is a successful singer with a nice home and happy family. Sadie wants to win her sister's approval so much, but Georgia is guarded and very reserved. With good reason. Sadie is not the most stable person, and in subtly conveyed complexities the two actresses weave a very close but unsure relationship. It is clear by their interactions that they have had strained and problematic relations. Georgia tells Sadie's well-meaning husband, Axel, when he asks Georgia if she can help Sadie with her own music career, that Sadie is always getting in the way of Sadie. This is very true. No matter what she does she seems to hurt herself. It is heartbreaking. In the end, Sadie comes back to Georgia because she is strung out on heroin, and Georgia tries to help Sadie overcome her addiction. Their relationship is multi-layered and emotional. Fabulous performances by both actresses.

But I'm determined to add my 2 cents about this great movie because I feel so strongly about Jennifer Jason Leighs miraculous performance. She is touched by God (or Satan), because she so totally immerses herself into her role as ""Sadie"", that there is not a hint of ""acting."" She so perfectly captures those downed-out girls I saw in punk clubs in the '70's & '80's (where are THEY now??), and her slide down the gutter of addiction is so real, you may find yourself trying to wipe the droul off your t.v. screen. Sadie's pathetic attempts to ""be somebody"", in light of her sister, ""Georgia"", who not only has ""respectable"" fame, but, a seemingly stable family..etc, is heartbreaking to behold. The nuances of her portrayal are newly un-covereed at each viewing, leaving you just shaking your head in amazement at her performance. I'm surprised some viewers found her interpretation ""mannered"", to put it kindly. Because I recognized her mannerisms, her sad creation of a ""Sadie"" to hide the real hurt inside,as traits I have seen in many troubled people I have known. Hey, you either get it, or you don't. I have always admired Ms. Leighs work, always thought she was an exceptional actress, but this role just ""blew me away"", for want of a better phrase. I don't want to take anything away from all the other actors, stars, superstars, commercial draws, etc..., out there in ""La-La Land"", but this girl is SO much more of an artist, wonder, PRESENCE, that 99% of the others should just forget it. She makes you realize what true talent is, not just a bunch of hype.I almost feel bad about going on about her, because this movie also has one of my all-time favorite actresses,the incredibly gifted Mare Winningham.Her ""Georgia"" is a very subtle, perfect contrast, to J.J.Leighs ""Sadie.""I've always hoped Oliver Stone would make a film of another one of the handful of people who had true, God-given talent, Janis Joplin, and that Mare Winningham would star. She would be perfect. If you can ever get your hands on her early work ""Off The Minnesota Strip""(?), do so, as it is a precursor of J.J.Leighs role as Sadie.She is miraculous in it. The supporting players are all very good also in Georgia, especially John Doe, of ""X"" fame.

Georgia gets a modicum of soul into her music, but that's all there is. Axel, a boxboy & a decent guy, marries sister Sadie for a brief what's-wrong-with-this-picture time, but gives up.

I ran out and paid full price for it; I'd seen it several times in the theatre (for free), but I bear to be too long parted from it.It's said that there's nothing new under the sun, but the theme of this movie was something I haven't seen explored much-- not thematically, that I can recall: at its core it's about the desire to express oneself artistically in the absence of talent.This is a hard film to watch, I'm going to tell you that right away. Fortunately, Jennifer Jason Leigh isn't really a no-talent hack, she only plays one in the movie. Could she be any greater? I gave up ordering strawberry ice cream a long time ago, because it's just never as good as you think it's going to be, and I was just about ready to do the same with movies, before I saw this one. I mean, when was the last time I saw someone actually trying to act? The memories are fuzzy. In fact, it might havebeen another lifetime. Sadie's (Leigh's character) stands in serpentine postures that remind me of the kids in high school I would expect to grow up into Sadies; how difficult a task for an actress to sing badly, yet soulfully, and at the same time communicate that the character thinks she is singing well? and Leigh manages. It's beautiful and heart-breaking.And by the way, Mare Winningham (who plays Sadie's sister) can sing.

It's clean living success versus struggles and failures.  As an author of a book dealing with dysfunction and addiction, I enjoyed this move.  The movie is set up to root for the underdog, but the more you want her to make it or to crash and burn (even die), the more she stays the same in her situation.  Basically, you can't teach a dog new tricks.  Excellant acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh as the overly masscaraed, eye-lined Sadie.  At times she looks like she has two black eyes, because in reality she has been beaten (not physically, but beaten in life).  I kept waiting for her to be beautiful, but JJL does a great job being unattractive.  Why did I prefer her to the Georgia character?  Must be a character flaw of mine.  I rooted like heck for her and chances are would have seen one of her band's shows instead of Georgia's.  John Doe (from the band X) also does a great job acting in this one.  Memorable scene was when a messed up on Nyquil Sadie is carried up the stares by Bobby (Doe) and taken care of.  ""Shut up Sadie,"" he says repeatedly and then dumps her in the tub.  Interesting flick, not a five because Sadie didn't succeed or die.",4,"Rags to Riches,NO, Greek Tragedy,NO (minus one star because)",1034899200,"10 18, 2002",2002,1289,"['tale', 'successful', 'singer', 'sister', 'living', 'coat', 'untalented', 'singer', 'addict', 'polar', 'opposite', 'clean', 'living', 'success', 'struggles', 'failures', 'author', 'book', 'dealing', 'dysfunction', 'addiction', 'enjoyed', 'move', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'root', 'underdog', 'more', 'want', 'make', 'crash', 'burn', 'even', 'die', 'more', 'same', 'situation', 'Basically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'dog', 'new', 'tricks', 'Excellant', 'acting', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'overly', 'masscaraed', 'eye-lined', 'Sadie', 'times', 'two', 'black', 'eyes', 'reality', 'been', 'beaten', 'not', 'physically', 'beaten', 'life', 'kept', 'waiting', 'be', 'beautiful', 'JJL', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'unattractive', 'Why', 'did', 'prefer', 'Georgia', 'character', 'Must', 'be', 'character', 'flaw', 'mine', 'rooted', 'heck', 'chances', 'are', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'band', 'shows', 'instead', 'Georgia', 'John', 'Doe', 'band', 'X', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'one', 'Memorable', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'messed', 'up', 'Nyquil', 'Sadie', 'carried', 'stares', 'Bobby', 'Doe', 'taken', 'care', 'Shut', 'up', 'Sadie', 'repeatedly', 'then', 'dumps', 'tub', 'Interesting', 'flick', 'not', 'five', 'Sadie', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'die']",Georgia VHS
