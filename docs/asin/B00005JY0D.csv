660352,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JY0D,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[8, 8]","If you are looking for good cartoons for very young children to watch, the ""Little Bear"" series is an excellent choice.  These videos are nonviolent, reasonably engaging and intelligent, and they generally teach good values and problem solving.  It's not great art, but it is entertaining and won't insult your child's intelligence.  Based on a series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik in the 1960s, this is good family fare -- you can park your kid in front of these films and not have to worry about disturbing or inappropriate content.  Whew!  Thank goodness.This episode is a full-length film in which Little Bear meets a wild bear cub in the woods who has a rough-edged personality and doesn't know how to behave in a civilized house... Nonetheless, Little Bear brings him home and let's him stay as his guest for several days, teaching him about table manners and being polite, etc.  When they discover that the wild cub is an orphan, Little Bear and his friends help him find his parents again.  It's a little bit weird, but not too bad... another fine entry in the ""Little Bear"" series.
