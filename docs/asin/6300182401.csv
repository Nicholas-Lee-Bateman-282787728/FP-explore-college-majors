201803,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300182401,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I remember going through this phase about five years ago when I wanted to consume everything Lily Tomlin had ever touched because I had this idea in my head that she was a comedic genius.  I'm not saying that she isn't, or that my idea was wrong, but I'm not really sure what I was basing this assumption off of, other than word of mouth.  I wasn't that familiar with her work at the time and so I guess I was just dissatisfied with the current crop of funny ladies and was hoping it was better `back then'.`The Incredible Shrinking Woman' is a hard find.  Who has a VHS player?  Not me.  And the DVD, which everyone here has stuck their nose up at (apparently it is cutting the movie to shreds) is now out of print.  You can watch it on Amazon, but not everyone is into VOD.Thankfully, five years ago, this movie was actually on rotation on television (it's currently playing on Cinemax too) and so I was able to catch it in its perceived entirety.I'll admit, I wanted to love this more.  From a conceptual angle, I loved this idea, and Tomlin was effectively humorous in both a verbal and physical way, but the film's overall construction felt below par in my eyes.  It just didn't work entirely.  I liked it, and yet I felt no real reason to watch it more than once.  It is rather forgettable, and despite having some nicely done visuals the overall impact is less than I desired it to be.  I can't say that it is a real shame that the film is hard to find, since I don't know that I'd actually recommend it to anyone, at least not with urgency.  If you can get your hands on it, by all means check it out, but don't be too upset that you currently can't.",3,Shrug...,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,1658,"['remember', 'going', 'phase', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'wanted', 'consume', 'everything', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'had', 'ever', 'touched', 'had', 'idea', 'head', 'was', 'comedic', 'genius', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'idea', 'was', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'basing', 'assumption', 'other', 'word', 'mouth', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'work', 'time', 'so', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'dissatisfied', 'current', 'crop', 'funny', 'ladies', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'better', 'back', ""then'."", 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Woman', 'hard', 'find', 'Who', 'VHS', 'player', 'Not', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'here', 'stuck', 'nose', 'up', 'apparently', 'cutting', 'movie', 'shreds', 'now', 'print', 'can', 'watch', 'Amazon', 'not', 'everyone', 'VOD.Thankfully', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'rotation', 'television', 'currently', 'playing', 'Cinemax', 'too', 'so', 'was', 'able', 'catch', 'perceived', 'entirety.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'wanted', 'love', 'more', 'conceptual', 'angle', 'loved', 'idea', 'Tomlin', 'was', 'effectively', 'humorous', 'verbal', 'physical', 'way', 'film', 'overall', 'construction', 'felt', 'par', 'eyes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'entirely', 'liked', 'yet', 'felt', 'real', 'reason', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'having', 'nicely', 'done', 'overall', 'impact', 'less', 'desired', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'real', 'shame', 'film', 'hard', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'actually', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'least', 'not', 'urgency', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'upset', 'currently', 'ca', ""n't""]",N/A

I watched this movie twenty years ago as a child and thought the message about chemicals being toxic was scary then and even more so now!  It's interesting how pertinant the subject matter is.That being said, this movie is pure entertainment.  We watched it as a family and both my husband and son were interested throughout.  My son was delighted when Lily Tomlin gets so tiny that she lives in the kids Barbie dollhouse.THe supporting cast is excellent as well as the kids.  Joel Schumacher does an excellent job directing.

201805,A2JJSCIGPZDWHI,6300182401,BENJAMIN MILER,"[20, 21]","The Incredible Shrinking Woman came out in 1981 and the movie actually more or less reflected the consumerist attitudes of the time, the dawning of the Reagan administration. The movie wasn't too well liked by the critics, they thought that Lily Tomlin didn't give it her full here and that the script was simply so-so, but actually I thought the movie makes perfect sense. Here Lily Tomlin plays a housewife named Pat Kramer who starts to shink thanks to an intolerance of chemicals in her household items. What was really silly of the film was the gorilla, because it wasn't a real gorilla at all but a person in a gorilla suit. Anyway, this movie is basically a satire on Reagan-era American consumerism and materialism, and I think they did a good job at getting that message across, regardless what the movie critics said of it. Lily Tomlin might be a fine comedienne, but it's too bad that her movie output has been rather inconsistent, ranging from critically acclaimed and well liked films like Nashville (w/Henry Gibson, like Tomlin, a Laugh-In alumni, and Keith Carradine) and All of Me (w/Steve Martin) to total stinkers and box office bombs like Moment by Moment (w/John Travolta).

Pat Kramer who is a well-known and well-loved citizen in a town where she always shops, where her neighbors love her and know everything about her, and her husband (Charles Grodin) who is into advertising and coming up with names for products, which Pat just happens to try at home, do something to her matabolism.  The special effects that show her shrinking are quite awesome and amazing.  The dolls and toys scene is hillarious!  And the ape Sidney at an institute where Pat gets kidnapped because they want to do experiments on her blood as to why she's shrinking.  What amazes me is when Pat was on the podium on her last shrinking phase telling everyone she's about to go, she swims in a pool of fabric softener and comes back???? As funny as it seems they leave you hanging at the end cause when her husband tries to put her wedding ring back on, it won't go and she GROWS and her shoes explode.

Beneath all the laughs here is a very serious condemnation of our plastic, chemical-filled modern suburban American Dream, and despite the outlandish plot it all rings pretty true. Tomlin is wonderful, Grodin is as Grodin as ever, and while the laughs come and go, ISW is still in its very own genre: the conspiracy/sci-fi domestic comedy.It's almost unsettling to watch this with 30 years' hindsight into modern corporate criminality and the many new illnesses modern industry has created, and I kept thinking that it's no coincidence this has stayed off tv and off dvd. It's all a little too accurate in many ways, and indicts big business in general, including the advertising and marketing rackets. That it can do this while staying funny and kid-friendly is quite a feat, and it's a film that I'd highly recommend watching with your kids. They'll get it on many levels, as will you.If you can, watch the uncensored vhs version for the Edith Ann scenes and a few other assorted bits later clipped out.I hope this gets wide release and even a blu-ray...but I won't be at all surprised if it doesn't.

201824,A1WUMTJOASEL5F,6300182401,"Robert ""Supermandisco""","[0, 0]","Very amusing and well done comedy of a take on Incredible Shrinking ordeal, and not to be compared with The Incredible Shrinking Man which was a much more realistic sci-fi classic tale. Lily Tomlin shines as does the rest of the crew in this colorful outlook of products and it's chemical compounds gone awry in the body of Pat Kramer who suffers a shrinking disorder to oblivion.Nice little side moral along the way of how anyone, no matter what size, can make a strong valuable difference in the world of caring to make a difference. Funniest parts actually begin toward the last fourth quarter of the movie when it turns its story in the lab, and involves a lab gorilla with the comedic timing of a natural born comic. His status for flipping off the lab scientists is pure comedic pleasure in the primal nature of wanting to do just a thing to the people who tend to manipulate us as lab experiments in the real world. I actually have no beef or comment to make other than this is one of the 80s decade finest with many memorable scenes, including the house maid Concepcion who is outrageous in sterotype, and rhythmic latin dancing in the kitchen, makes us all jump for joy.The addition of seeing it online thanks to Amazon, is also another added plus.",5,The incredible story of Pat Kramer,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1257,"['Very', 'amusing', 'well', 'done', 'comedy', 'take', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'ordeal', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'tale', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'shines', 'rest', 'crew', 'colorful', 'outlook', 'products', 'chemical', 'compounds', 'gone', 'awry', 'body', 'Pat', 'Kramer', 'who', 'shrinking', 'disorder', 'oblivion.Nice', 'little', 'side', 'moral', 'way', 'how', 'anyone', 'matter', 'what', 'size', 'can', 'make', 'strong', 'valuable', 'difference', 'world', 'caring', 'make', 'difference', 'Funniest', 'parts', 'actually', 'begin', 'last', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'movie', 'when', 'story', 'lab', 'lab', 'gorilla', 'comedic', 'timing', 'natural', 'born', 'comic', 'status', 'flipping', 'off', 'lab', 'scientists', 'pure', 'comedic', 'pleasure', 'primal', 'nature', 'wanting', 'do', 'just', 'thing', 'people', 'who', 'tend', 'manipulate', 'lab', 'experiments', 'real', 'world', 'actually', 'have', 'beef', 'comment', 'make', 'other', 'one', '80s', 'decade', 'finest', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'including', 'house', 'maid', 'Concepcion', 'who', 'outrageous', 'sterotype', 'rhythmic', 'latin', 'dancing', 'kitchen', 'jump', 'joy.The', 'addition', 'seeing', 'online', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'also', 'added', 'plus']",N/A
