The Killing Jar is a crime/mystery film, a whodunit. After a grizzly murder is reported on the radio, and a mysterious man shows up at the diner, they began to question him which leads to some violent results. Overall, its a decent mystery film, only held back by a few flaws.What did I like? The Killing Jar kept me thoroughly entertained and interested. I enjoyed most of the acting and the music, as well. It got some surprising elements like the gore, especially if you don't watch the trailers. It definitely went by fast so the pacing was great. A great performance from Michael Madsen.What did I dislike? Personally, I was able to guess the mystery early in the film and the ending was about average. Also, the waitress didn't act well. A lot of her dialogue seemed forced and often flawed; she was either under or overacting, usually missing the target.The Killing Jar is a great whodunit/mystery film and an amazing time killer. If you're interested, it is available on Netflix Streaming as of 7/2/12, and I definitely recommend checking it out.The Killing Jar has blood and gore, no sex or nudity (some sexual references though)WARNING: Don't read the cast on Wikipedia/IMDB, it has major spoilers!",4,Surprising!

1389371,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0049D1T7W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","There's a fairly decent, and quite interesting, plot lurking somewhere in the thriller ""The Killing Jar."" I really wanted to be an advocate of the film. I love dramatic stories of conflict and surprise set in claustrophobic settings--this almost theater-like staging should ratchet up the tension and verbal dynamics. But there is an odd and uncertain execution within this film that really derails the more positive aspects of the story. I'm not entirely sure that all of the actors were even on set at the same time, though all the action transpires in one room! But I'll get to that in a bit. The film begins with a bang and ends with a flourish--but the moments in between range from amusingly eccentric to outright painful. I suspect that an intriguing idea for this thriller went slightly off track at the screenplay stage and jumped the rails completely during the actual filming. It's a shame because the basis, again, might have made for a satisfyingly twisty end product.Set late at night in a small town diner, the introduction of ""The Killing Jar"" promises of violence yet to come. It is a showy kick-off and one that had my expectations set high to see what led up to that moment. At the true beginning, however, we meet an eclectic gang of random individuals who apparently like to hang out in restaurants without eating. Amber Benson is the waitress and Danny Trejo is a cook/owner. Others sitting around conveniently until they are needed for the plot are a couple of kids escaping town (not very quickly, I might add), a deputy, and a trucker. Harold Perrineau, as a traveling businessman, and Michael Madsen, as an enigmatic stranger, soon enter the picture as well. Imagine a group of disparate strangers sitting in a diner where no food is being served (although promises of pie are forthcoming), the air conditioning is broken, there is no background music, and they just stare vacantly and indefinitely into space--now you understand the film's ambience. The restaurant is closing, apparently, though no one makes a move to make this happen. When news of a local murder hits the radio, suspicions fall on the surly Madsen.Confronting Madsen may not, however, be the best idea--but it is the entry point into a tale that is twisty enough to sustain the B-movie mayhem to follow. As the diner is taken hostage (even though the door is never locked, the lights are not shifted down, and the curtains aren't closed), startling revelations are at hand for our innocent and not-so-innocent cast. Madsen interrogates various people (unfortunately the scenes were eerily reminiscent of ""Reservoir Dogs"" making me remember what a dynamic actor he can be) and blood is spilled (the film likes to linger on close-ups of the blood to transition between scenes) before all is revealed. The final scenes embrace a mad logic and the finale is fun, but it's a case of too little/too late--for me anyway.The performances in the film range from adequate to not particularly good. Character actor Kevin Gage, as the trucker, is the only one I believed start to finish. Benson is merely okay as the world's most annoying and intrusive (I mean kindly) waitress. At several points, we're meant to believe that she is more deserving of life because she's a good person--but I never saw that special quality to make her worthier than the others. If not for the film's awkwardness in execution, however, I might have rated it a bit higher. The kids, who never leave the diner, are absent for much of the film. We hear an occasional random voice-over to remind us they're still there even though Benson should be walking by them when she's talking to Perrinueau. I guess they didn't want to pay them for all the days of the shoot! Which leads me to Trejo--who's advertised front and center on the DVD packaging. He never leaves the kitchen, is only seen through the window, and is never filmed with any other actor. Tell me he wasn't spliced into the final edit! The film, in general, just has a pieced together feel that lessens any possible tension! Good idea, poor execution.

1389375,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,B0049D1T7W,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[1, 2]","I began watching The Killing Jar DVD because I no longer subscribe to Netflix.  Early on we learn that a local farm family, mother, father, and two children, have been murdered for no apparent reason.  I got ready for a low-budget knock-off of In Cold Blood, but it was not to be.  The Silver Lake Diner's late-night characters, a tired and disheveled waitress in her early thirties, a deputy sheriff not much older, whose appearance and manner did little to inspire confidence in local law enforcement, and a brush-cut, fit-looking veteran of the the first Gulf War, exchanged predictable platitudes, but no one seemed particularly troubled or threatened by the local crimes.  After ten or fifteen minutes of banal chit-chat, I was ready to say ""Enough of The Killing Jar!"" and read a book or go for a walk.However, when the waitress (Amber Benson) began a casual conversation with a customer (Harold Parrineau) in the rear booth, the film showed a flicker of promise.  Parrineau's character was casually articulate, cordial, earnest, and alert, a sharp departure from the other folks killing time in the old diner.  I was surprised at how much Parrineau's on-screen presence elevated the tone of the film, suggesting that something of passing interest might be said or done after all.Still, I couldn't figure out why Danny Trejo was cast in the role of the cook and owner.  It didn't matter, I suppose, as he said little, did less, and was rarely on screen.  Before he left the scene for good, however, I entertained the notion that he might eventually make a conspicuous contribution.  But, when all was said and done, he seemed oddly miscast and not really interested, not even for a cameo laugh.  Too bad.When Michael Madsen's character walked in, he introduced a discordant strain of tension that accompanies a truculent-looking stranger in an insular little town.  The waitress suggested her favorite, pecan pie.  Since the grill had been turned off for the evening, pie and coffee were pretty much it.Madsen's character briefly, loudly, and profanely insisted on steak, but he settled for coffee.  Madsen, in a black leather jacket with metal studs, looked rumpled, haggard, and out of shape.  With the raspy voice of a hard drinking heavy smoker, he brought to mind a teenaged tough who had lumbered into middle age and didn't much like it.  The black dye in his hair was so thick and obvious that it looked like shoe polish in need of buffing.Prompted by the other locals, the skinny and feckless deputy sheriff (Lew Temple) confronted Madsen with questions about the farm family killings. Madsen was predictably boorish and unresponsive.  The deputy quickly lost his composure and, in the absence of other professional skills, pulled his gun, shouting questions and warning Madsen that he'd better be suitably forthcoming.  Madsen was neither frightened nor rendered less objectionable, but the deputy soon decided that he was satisfied, though I'm not sure why, and he ended the standoff.Most of the rest of the film is devoted to Madsen being angry, displaying the kind of shotgun you might see on The Military Channel, definitely not for hunting rabbits and pheasants.  In addition to Madsen's anger, most of what follows is premised on the dubious assumption that the killer of the farm family is one of the folks in the diner.Jake Busey makes an appearance. I had never seen him before, but given his provenance he's a better actor than I had expected, but he's quickly off camera.If you're looking for the plot to thicken, you'll have a long wait.  There's plenty of action of a sort, the proximate cause of most of it being that Madsen's character is really angry.  But there's not much of a story.Eventually we find out who killed the farm family, and the film has an unexpectedly satisfying ending.  But unless you find the characters played by Madsen, Ambrose, Parrineau, and Kevin Gage as the army veteran interesting, there's not much reason to sit through The Killing Jar.I've liked Madsen since I first saw him in Reservoir Dogs, and Parrineau really should be working more.  The guy has the sort of on-screen charisma and potential for versatility that go into making a really good character actor.  Gage is believably tough and commonsensically intelligent, at least compared to the other locals, and Ambrose is no more phlegmatic and pathetic than she has to be.  It's an actor's movie:  the set never changes, there is a lot of talk, the violence may seem gratuitous, but if you stretch a bit it can be construed as leverage, used more or less judiciously in the characters' efforts to get what they want, even if it's just retributive satisfaction.I liked The Killing Jar for the reasons just given, but that's not much of a recommendation.  Make of it what you will.",4,Why Is Danny Trejo in this Film?,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,4797,"['began', 'watching', 'Killing', 'Jar', 'DVD', 'no', 'longer', 'subscribe', 'Netflix', 'Early',

There are clear problems with this film but all in all it was a very entertaining, all be it- brutal movie. Madsen was spectacularly great in this. He just seems to play sadistic psycho's naturally, and brilliantly. Danny Trejo had a rather short appearance but I thought he was just plain hysterical as a cook in a small time diner. The acting by a few was decent to pretty good, but the real gem in this film is the black actor, who I have seen in other movies, but I don't know the actor by name. Watch a stellar piece of acting by this guy. His performance is the stuff that get's oscar nods. I mean he's that good. I was also very pleased that the actor who played the evil sadistic Wayne Grow in Michael Mann's 'Heat' was on board as a good guy this time around, and I must say his acting was very good as well. Here he plays a tough guy with some real heart. The film and story is pretty sick and twisted, and there is no real happy ending. it's also nothing particularly new, but for some moments of genuine great acting in a film that you'd never expect to have great acting, it's worth a look. Watch toward the end of the film as the black character makes a rather dramatic shift in personality. it's the work of genious. Without him in the film this movie would have not been much at all. But considering his performance in the most unlikely of films is just fantastic. This movie get's 4 out of 5 stars in my book. And Madsen fans will love Michael in this one.",4,Madsen fans!

After hearing about a brutal killing, a mysterious stranger comes in to a diner at closing time.  The waitress and the six customers begin to think this stranger is the killer.  After taking control of the situation the stranger begins to uncover secrets of the hostages.  Not everyone is who they seem to be.  This is yet another movie with a lot of potential but doesn't keep your attention.  There are some pretty intense parts but overall pretty slow moving.  It's not terrible but not a great first choice for nightly entertainment.  I give it a C.Would I watch again? - No, this is a movie that doesn't get better with repeated viewings.",3,A mysterious stranger enters a diner and is accused of murder.
