1226533,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001P9N9AI,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The problem with `Du saram-yida' is that it doesn't really hold up in the long run.  There are some stunning visuals and some truly scary production design, but the story itself is told in a very prodding fashion.  It just doesn't flow with ease and it doesn't hold the interest as tightly as a horror film needs to.  There is plenty of blood and death and violence, but the in-between moments are almost sleep inducing.  The performances are also very poor, like High School students attempting their first go at a drama class.  I do understand that Asian acting styles are more theatrical and more animated (not something you can really thrust upon this film though) and that their approach to acting can at times appear too much like acting, but even for that specific breed of film, this is a little amateurish.  Nothing feels genuine or natural.  It is an international variation of the poor man's American horror story.  Think `Urban Legend' with pacing issues and even worse (if you can conjure that up) acting.",2,The voices told me to turn this off...,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,1018,"['problem', 'Du', 'saram-yida', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'up', 'long', 'run', 'are', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'truly', 'scary', 'production', 'design', 'story', 'told', 'very', 'prodding', 'fashion', 'just', ""n't"", 'flow', 'ease', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'as', 'tightly', 'horror', 'film', 'needs', 'plenty', 'blood', 'death', 'violence', 'in-between', 'moments', 'are', 'almost', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'poor', 'High', 'School', 'students', 'attempting', 'first', 'go', 'drama', 'class', 'do', 'understand', 'Asian', 'acting', 'styles', 'are', 'more', 'theatrical', 'more', 'animated', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'really', 'thrust', 'film', 'approach', 'acting', 'can', 'times', 'appear', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'even', 'specific', 'breed', 'film', 'little', 'amateurish', 'Nothing', 'feels', 'genuine', 'natural', 'international', 'variation', 'poor', 'man', 'American', 'horror', 'story', 'Think', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'pacing', 'issues', 'even', 'worse', 'can', 'conjure', 'up', 'acting']",Voices
1226534,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B001P9N9AI,Anticlimacus,"[5, 5]","Sometimes I think that many reviewers are simply too lazy to understand films with indirect communication. I've heard people complain that ""Asian horror movies don't make sense"", which is usually just a roundabout way of saying, ""I'm too lazy to figure them out."" However, there are some films that prove to be very difficult to understand (e.g., Spider Forest) or simply don't make the slightest bit of sense at all (e.g., Marronnier). ""Voices"" (aka ""Someone Behind You"") is one of those projects that is most definitely a bit too vague for its own good, so it's understandable that many viewers have serious problems figuring this movie out.This is a shell game kind of movie that tries to bait the viewer into red herring traps from start to finish. Don't be fooled, this is simply and solely about a demon (in human form) who is one gigantic scumbag that uses varying degrees of manipulation to coerce and/or control human beings for his own sick little games and perverted enjoyment. His favorite statement, ""Don't trust anyone, not even yourself"" is nothing more than a patronizing taunt to scare his victims. If he was more forthcoming, he would say something like this: ""I will coerce your friends and family to kill you. If that doesn't work, I will force them into a state of temporary insanity to kill you."" The only true escape from this disastrous situation is to simply move into a desolate, isolated area and live the rest of your life in seclusion, which isn't exactly a losing proposition for a scumbag demon who wants to see people suffer, both physically and/or psychologically.The psychological effects come into play when his victims prove particularly difficult to kill - and our lead protagonist is one tough cookie, eluding a number of attacks from friends and family members. In cases such as this, the attempted murders will form an unprecedented pattern that points towards some supernatural, uncommon influence. Think about it. Why would every single friend and family member attempt to kill someone? At this point, the possibility of a curse no longer seems so far-fetched. In addition, paranoia reaches its highest level, and the target will suffer greatly when attempting to reconcile these crazy events with their newly acquired mistrust and fear of their loved ones. Just the kind of psychological games a sick, demonic scumbag would love to watch. It also makes this film hella interesting.While somewhat obvious that the demon has added outside influence to every attempted murder, what makes this movie even more appealing during a second viewing is pondering just how much manipulation is required to push a particular person over the edge into attempted murder. For example, the husband who throws his wife into the path of a moving bus is possibly the least influenced murder herein. It is possible that the demon made the phone calls to his house, but I have no problems assuming that the character is wholly responsible for his actions and that the demon simply instilled some doubt into his mind regarding his love's possible infidelity. To take a contrasting example, the groom who tosses his bride off the balcony had no identifiable motive for doing so, which leans more towards a demon-influenced state of temporary insanity. The other instances of assault usually fall between those two extremes.Not everything in this film is cut and dry though. As I mentioned earlier, the script is vague and ambiguous, leaving unexplained gaps in the storyline. Most of these are easily rectified with logical, common sense assumptions because there's very little (if any) blatant contradictions when one understands that a demonic scumbag is behind everything; and as we all know, demonic scumbags are not bound to follow a set or rules or guidelines. I would post my specific thoughts, but this 1000-word review is very limited (read the message board instead). Also, I knowingly confess that this film is flawed in terms of scriptwriting, so there's really no hard-hitting points to be made in that regard anyways.However, the blemishes in ""Someone Behind You"" are overshadowed by a number of positive qualities. At the very least you'll get solid acting and a refreshingly different premise, which automatically elevates this film above most non-Asian horror fare. The aforementioned murder attempts are well-executed (some of which are very bloody) and the sense of paranoia is most definitely highlighted at numerous points. The protagonists are also very likable and their decision-making is understandable. What you end up with is a flick that's pretty damn entertaining.The last few years have been fantastic for the South Korean horror/thriller genre. ""Faithless Hell"" (2009), ""Someone Behind You"" (2007) is a nice compliment to films like ""Hansel and Gretel"" (2007), ""The Chaser"" (2008), ""The Return"" (aka ""Wide Awake"") (2007), ""Epitaph"" (2007), ""Muoi"" (2007), ""Bloody Reunion"" (2006), ""Loner"" (2008), ""A Bloody Aria"" (2006), ""Seven Days"" (2007), ""Cadaver"" (2007), ""A Good Wife"" (2007), ""Coma"" (2006 miniseries), and ""D-Day"" (aka ""Roommates"") (2006). Most of these have their own particular flaws (most films do), but this is a very good lineup of titles that would make an awesome weekend marathon. I'll never understand why everyone reflexively runs out to rent the U.S. ""Shutter"" remake while ignoring these little gems. There is a significant minority of movie buffs who like Asian horror, but more people need to see these movies. I rarely (if ever) hear anyone talk about them. Even the formulaic entries like ""D-Day"" are really cool - and all of them are better than 90% of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days.

1226535,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001P9N9AI,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","Watching ""Voices,"" a subtitled South Korean import, I kept asking myself: When will this movie be remade in America? It's not that I want it to be remade. It's just that, with the recent releases of ""The Ring,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""The Eye,"" ""Mirrors,"" ""Shutter,"" and ""One Missed Call"" ... well, you just know it's going to happen sooner or later. When it does happen, I can only hope that American filmmakers will be able to make something out of the plot. Yes, this movie does have a plot, but God help me, I have no idea how I can describe it to you; it's one of those films that seems to intentionally forgo any degree of clarity, the story shifting gradually from vague to incomprehensible. I watched the bloody murder scenes and I read the subtitles and I studied the characters as best I could, but somehow, absolutely nothing was clicking.Now, I realize I may be at a serious disadvantage. It is, after all, a foreign language film, so it was most likely made with a very different audience in mind. Maybe there are cultural considerations I'm not aware of. In my review of ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" I noted that the main character's sense of optimism seemed unlikely given his terrible circumstances; readers were shocked at my ignorance, and a few even took the time to inform me that I was looking at this film from a very Western perspective, that even the most downtrodden in Mumbai survive only because they find something to live for. So it's quite possible that I'm looking at ""Voices"" from a very Western perspective. I may in fact lack the cultural understanding required to make sense of the story, which turns back on itself so many times that it eventually seemed less like a plot and more like a frightening dreamscape.The original Korean title is ""Du Saram-Yida,"" which literally translates as ""Someone Behind You."" This does accurately describe the sense of paranoia and uncertainty permeating the story. Paranoia is often times baseless and irrational, much like the story, in which a teenage fencing champion named Ga-in (Jin-seo Yun) finds herself at the mercy of an unstoppable and unexplainable death curse. At least, I think it's a curse. It seems that everyone around her wants someone else to die, and in a fit of rage, they act on it: one of Ga-in's aunts is pushed off a balcony on her wedding day, and as she recovers in the hospital, another aunt violently stabs her to death; one of Ga-in's classmates, a perfect student in all respects, becomes so jealous that she tries to stab Ga-in in the nurse's office; at a certain point, Ga-in's mother starts wielding a knife, screaming, ""Die! Die! Die!"" as her husband tries to subdue her.So then some supernatural force has been unleashed on Ga-in's family. Or has it? All throughout, a reclusive, sunken-eyed teenage boy named Seok-min (Ki-woong Park) keeps appearing to give her this ominous piece of advice: ""Don't trust anyone. Not your friends, not your family, not even yourself."" This may or may not have something to do with a bad thing that happened to him as a boy, which may or may not have something to do with the film's ending, at which point any remaining thread of plot cohesion is cut away. Watching those final scenes is like watching a demo reel of murders and surrealistic images and plot twists all edited together. It's a meaningless jumble of moments that wanted to reveal something without actually revealing it. To say I had no idea what was going on would be like saying that the surface of the sun is warm.The most maddening thing is that characters are constantly offing some kind of vague reason for what's happening. They keep talking, yet somehow they're not really saying anything. They certainly aren't saying anything understandable. How strange that a movie in dire need of clarity could have done with a lot less explanation. There's a point at which Ga-in travels outside the city to see an elderly recluse who killed his wife in a fit of rage decades earlier. Despite the fact that his scenes are annoyingly light on specifics, at least they hinted that the rest of the film would follow some kind of narrative logic. But then comes the ending. Dear God, the ending--a bleak, nonsensical muddle that reverses pretty much everything I thought I knew about the plot.This is one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in a long time. Rarely has a film worked so hard at being a confusing mess. Let it be known that I went into ""Voices"" with an open mind, and for the first forty-five minutes or so, I really did try my hardest to make sense of it. But at a certain point, it was obvious that there wasn't much to make sense of, and I threw in the towel. Yes, it's a frightening movie, full of gory death scenes and surprise scares and quiet moments that build tension. But when story is neglected in favor of atmosphere, you have nothing more than a thrill-a-minute funhouse ride. If I had wanted that, I would have gone to a carnival. American filmmakers will have their work cut out for them once they latch onto this screenplay and begin reworking it. Don't think it won't happen somewhere down the line.",2,I Must Kill You!,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,5120,"['Watching', 'Voices', 'subtitled', 'South', 'Korean', 'import', 'kept', 'asking', 'When',

Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[0, 0]","japanese horror flicks is a genre that has been growing on me for some time. the japanese have a take on horror that is similar to ours, but they do have their own vantage point that is flavored with their own folklore and perceptions of death and the macabre. this is a somewhat tantalizing flick put out by the after dark horrorfest, which is a company that sometimes delivers great movies.....but sometimes delivers trash. this is a worthwhile flick that is worth a look.  i still wish the after dark people would offer an english voiceover when doing japanese films.  all we get are english subtitles, which makes the movie harder to follow. still, this is a creepy, bloody movie about a girl who finds that everyone around her can suddenly snap and try to kill her.  she can trust no one!  it's hard to gage japanese acting, because the language barrier gets in the way....but the acting seems adequate for the genre. the story is fascinating and holds your interest. again, the language barrier made it necessary for me to watch this thing 3 or 4 times before i really figured out what was going on.....and i still haven't quite figured out the ending. but overall, this is a good flick with a decent number of surprises and scares, a lot of action and blood.....and when it comes down to it, it's just a fun, bloody, eerie little flick that is a pleasant diversion if you want to spend the day watching something spooky with a japanese twist. i'm sure i'll be watching it again. it's growing on me. and again, it would have been more enjoyable with an english voiceover....but it still would have been worth only a 4 star rating. but i can recommend this to horror fans at a 4-star level with a smile on my face and a dagger in somebody's heart........sayonara!",4,"a bloody, creepy journey into the unknown",1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,1768,"['japanese', 'horror', 'flicks', 'genre', 'been', 'growing', 'time', 'japanese', 'have', 'take', 'horror', 'similar', 'ours', 'do', 'have', 'own', 'vantage', 'point', 'flavored', 'own', 'folklore', 'perceptions', 'death', 'macabre', 'somewhat', 'tantalizing', 'flick', 'put', 'out', 'dark', 'horrorfest', 'company', 'delivers', 'great', 'movies', '..but', 'delivers', 'trash', 'worthwhile', 'flick', 'look', 'i', 'still', 'wish', 'dark', 'people', 'would', 'offer', 'english', 'voiceover', 'when', 'doing', 'japanese', 'films', 'get', 'are', 'english', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'harder', 'follow', 'still', 'creepy', 'bloody', 'movie', 'girl', 'who', 'everyone', 'can', 'suddenly', 'snap', 'try', 'kill', 'can', 'trust', 'one', 'hard', 'gage', 'japanese', 'acting', 'language', 'barrier', 'way', 'acting', 'adequate', 'genre', 'story', 'fascinating', 'interest', 'again', 'language', 'barrier', 'made', 'necessary', 'watch', 'thing', '3', '4', 'times', 'i', 'really', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', '..and', 'i', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figured', 'out', 'ending', 'overall', 'good', 'flick', 'decent', 'number', 'surprises', 'scares', 'lot', 'action', 'blood', '..and', 'when', 'down', 'just', 'fun', 'bloody', 'eerie', 'little', 'flick', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'want', 'spend', 'day', 'watching', 'something', 'spooky', 'japanese', 'twist', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'i', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'growing', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'english', 'voiceover', '.but', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'only', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'i', 'can', 'recommend', 'horror', 'fans', '4-star', 'level', 'smile', 'face', 'dagger', 'somebody', 'heart', '..sayonara']",Voices

Im not a big fan of foreign horror flicks (With The exeption of After Dark's HIDDEN.) So i skipped out on this movie for the longest time. I was looking through some movies the other day, and got to thinking... ""i have seen all of the other After Dark films, so why not go ahead and give this one a shot?"" All i can say is... im so glad that i did. I was very hesitant to watch it. I popped it in the DVD player, and immidiatally wanted to pop it right back out. But, i tried to bare through it, and after 10 minutes, i couldn't take my eyes off of the television. Most horror movies take forever for something exciting to happen, but not this one. Dramatic events, kept ahppening over & over again. They almost didn't give us a break. It's like this.... i was shocked. NO horror movie EVER shocks me. EVER. But thos one... is in a league of it's own. This is one of those, that you have to pay VERY close attetntion, to understand the full meaning of the plot. All that i kept saying to myself throughout this movie was. ""Ohh god""... or ""Oh my god""... Literally. Under my breath, throughout the entire movie. They even kept the suspense rolling untill the very end credits. It's like, everyone has a vendetta out for the girl. Bad things keep happening to her. Everyone is turning on her.... Her best friends, Boyfriend, Teacher, random classmates, even her own Mother. This movie, doesn't let you trust ANYONE in this movie. Not even the lead girl. Everyone has the potential to turn in this flick. Overall, i would give this movie a 10/10. Are all asian horror films this deep? If so.. i might have to burn all of my past thoughts of foriegn films. My only thing about those kinds of films, is that the subtitles annoy me a little bit. But after 10 minutes, i really stop noticing. Please check this movie out, you don't know what your missing, if you haven't seen this.

There were intimations of some sort of a family curse and great mood and plot (even allowing for the need to read the subtitles).  The heroine battles to stay alive as those around her )rivals, then friends and family) try to kill her...I was riveted...Real life intruded and I had to break away from the movie for a bit at about the 50 minute mark.  It was like someone came in and started a different movie with the same characters.  The idea of a family curse is quickly abandoned for a weird family revenge schtick with no real purpose or background.  Our heroine goes to visit some random old guy that may have survived or experienced a similar curse.  No real resolution or insight is provided, other than a nod to the idea of envy.  The random old guy commits suicide while our heroine returns home.The creators change track and add a family revenge motif (which might have worked had any of it been forecast in the first 2/3 of the movie).  When this does not work, they try to go back to a more supernatural element of a more individual curse or spiritual deception.  The movie ends with with the idea that all the bad stuff is about to happen again with a new victim.So, for the first 50 minutes I was riveted...and then watched the same actors and allegedly characters try two or three different horror motifs until they finally ended this turkey.My advice...watch for 45 minutes and realize or remember how good Asian horror can be...then leave and forget the last part of the movie ... use all means required to blot the last act from all memory...",2,"Leave now...or not, but you'll regret it",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,1688,"['started', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'story', 'female', 'Korean', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'family', 'were', 'intimations', 'sort', 'family', 'curse', 'great', 'mood', 'plot', 'even', 'allowing', 'need', 'read', 'subtitles', 'heroine', 'stay', 'alive', 'rivals', 'then', 'friends', 'family', 'try', 'kill', 'was', 'riveted', 'Real', 'life', 'intruded', 'had', 'break', 'away', 'movie', 'bit', '50', 'minute', 'mark', 'was', 'someone', 'came', 'started', 'different', 'movie', 'same', 'characters', 'idea', 'family', 'curse', 'quickly', 'abandoned', 'weird', 'family', 'revenge', 'schtick', 'real', 'purpose', 'background', 'heroine', 'visit', 'random', 'old', 'guy', 'may', 'have', 'survived', 'experienced', 'similar', 'curse', 'real', 'resolution', 'insight', 'provided', 'other', 'nod', 'idea', 'envy', 'random', 'old', 'guy', 'commits', 'suicide', 'heroine', 'home.The', 'creators', 'change', 'track', 'add', 'family', 'revenge', 'motif', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'had', 'been', 'forecast', 'first', '2/3', 'movie', 'When', 'not', 'work', 'try', 'go', 'back', 'more', 'supernatural', 'element', 'more', 'individual', 'curse', 'spiritual', 'deception', 'movie', 'idea', 'bad', 'stuff', 'happen', 'again', 'new', 'victim.So', 'first', '50', 'minutes', 'was', 'riveted', 'then', 'watched', 'same', 'actors', 'allegedly', 'characters', 'try', 'two', 'three', 'different', 'horror', 'motifs', 'finally', 'ended', 'turkey.My', 'advice', 'watch', '45', 'minutes', 'realize', 'remember', 'how', 'good', 'Asian', 'horror', 'can', 'be', 'then', 'leave', 'forget', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'use', 'means', 'required', 'blot', 'last', 'act', 'memory']",Voices
1226544,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B001P9N9AI,maskedgamer,"[1, 1]","There's plenty of jump scares in this film but I think it's to make sure your awake. The movie is interesting for the first 30 minutes but after that it just really doesn't go anywhere. The problem is the plot and how it doesn't ever evolve to make the story really work for the movie. The movie centers around a girl who's family and friends try to kill her when they randomly go ""berserk"" for whatever reason.It's about as interesting as it sounds since there's not really any good action. You'd think the movie would be one crazy adrenaline rush with plenty of escape sequences but instead it's full of cut scenes. I.E. when she's being attacked she jumps around and screams then someone comes to help her than cut scene.It does this for every action sequence and it gets old. It's like the writers didn't know how to end the fighting scenes.The people that just go berserk conveniently disappear. Aside from the fact that they just tried to commit murder they are talked about like they had a common cold after the cut seen.There's also the jump/demon scenes which are interesting and spooky but why? Usually in a normal horror film they do this for the first half hour to pump up the suspense and then they show the supernatural being. In this movie it's just the jump/shock scares so nothing ever truly evolves with the demon creature they show you. Matter of fact halfway through the movie it never makes another appearance or is even referenced as to what that was all about.The plot is full of holes and the story doesn't explain much. In most cases people will use an excuse saying you only understand the movie if your familiar with Korean culture. No, I only understand if you're Korean you'll probably use that as an excuse to get people to appreciate a horribly bad film your country produced. This horror movie is just plain awful in any culture.The reason as to why family members are trying to kill their loved ones is never explained. Is it the demon? Is it a curse? Is it some kind of virus? What's going on and why are they doing it? What was the message at the end? Was it the girl who was imagining people were attacking her when she was really hallucinating and attacking them instead? Story doesn't just doesn't make it clear. It's just overall a poorly written movie.There are also things I wonder about though like why does the main character who is a high school student have a boyfriend who is her same age that is apparently a Doctor. Is he Doogie Howser? Why is the method for killing someone always pushing them off a balcony or stabbing them?The only thing I can see is that this movie wants to be like ""Fallen"" but it falls far from making sense like ""Fallen"" did. Where as in Fallen a demon take possession of peoples bodies and causes them to kill one another and when he leaves the persons body they have no memory of what happened or why they did it. In Voices it's similar as to were people apparently kill their siblings,parents or whatever but it's not clear just what makes them do it but apparently they don't remember why themselves. Then they just trough random demon images in the mix. Just wasn't feeling this one at all.Overall Average film 2/5.A couple pretty girls (not the main character), some cheap scares, a plot that falls flat, and that's about it.",2,Doesn't really hold your attention.,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,3303,"['plenty', 'jump', 'scares', 'film', 'think', 'make', 'sure', 'awake', 'movie', 'interesting', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'just', 'really', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'problem', 'plot', 'how', ""n't"", 'ever', 'evolve', 'make', 'story', 'really', 'work', 'movie', 'movie', 'centers', 'girl', 'who', 'family', 'friends', 'try', 'kill', 'when', 'randomly', 'go', 'berserk', 'reason.It', 'as', 'interesting', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'action', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'crazy', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'plenty', 'escape', 'sequences', 'instead', 'full', 'cut', 'scenes', 'I.E', 'when', 'being', 'attacked', 'around', 'screams', 'then', 'someone', 'help', 'cut', 'scene.It', 'action', 'sequence', 'old', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'end', 'fighting', 'scenes.The', 'people', 'just', 'go', 'berserk', 'conveniently', 'disappear', 'Aside', 'fact', 'just', 'tried', 'commit', 'murder', 'are', 'talked', 'had', 'common', 'cold', 'cut', 'seen.There', 'also', 'jump/demon', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'spooky', 'why', 'Usually', 'normal', 'horror', 'film', 'do', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'pump', 'up', 'suspense', 'then', 'show', 'supernatural', 'being', 'movie', 'just', 'jump/shock', 'scares', 'nothing', 'ever', 'truly', 'demon', 'creature', 'show', 'Matter', 'fact', 'halfway', 'movie', 'never', 'appearance', 'even', 'referenced', 'what', 'was', 'about.The', 'plot', 'full', 'holes', 'story', ""n't"", 'explain', 'much', 'most', 'cases', 'people', 'will', 'use', 'excuse', 'saying', 'only', 'understand', 'movie', 'familiar', 'Korean', 'culture', 'No', 'only', 'understand', ""'re"", 'Korean', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'use', 'excuse', 'get', 'people', 'appreciate', 'horribly', 'bad', 'film', 'country', 'produced', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'culture.The', 'reason', 'why', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'loved', 'ones', 'never', 'explained', 'demon', 'curse', 'kind', 'virus', 'What', 'going', 'why', 'are', 'doing', 'What', 'was', 'message', 'end', 'Was', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'imagining', 'people', 'were', 'attacking', 'when', 'was', 'really', 'hallucinating', 'attacking', 'instead', 'Story', ""n't"", 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'just', 'overall', 'poorly', 'written', 'are', 'also', 'things', 'wonder', 'like', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'same', 'age', 'apparently', 'Doctor', 'Doogie', 'Howser', 'Why', 'method', 'killing', 'someone', 'always', 'pushing', 'off', 'balcony', 'stabbing', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'be', 'Fallen', 'far', 'making', 'sense', 'Fallen', 'did', 'Where', 'Fallen', 'demon', 'take', 'possession', 'peoples', 'bodies', 'kill', 'one', 'when', 'persons', 'body', 'have', 'memory', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'did', 'Voices', 'similar', 'were', 'people', 'apparently', 'kill', 'siblings', 'parents', 'not', 'clear', 'just', 'what', 'do', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'Then', 'just', 'random', 'demon', 'images', 'mix', 'Just', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'one', 'all.Overall', 'Average', 'film', '2/5.A', 'couple', 'pretty', 'girls', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'cheap', 'scares', 'plot', 'flat']",Voices

Part of the reason they suffer so is that the glory days of Yet Another Asian Horror films are, by and large, long gone. You still find the pearl now and again, but the number of swine seems to have increased tremendously in the past few years. Case in point: Du Saram-yida, released in English-speaking countries as Voices, a re-tread of a re-tread of a dozen other movies you've seen.Plot: Ga-in (Oldboy's Jin-seo Yun) is a high-school student and an award-winning fencer, but that's not enough for her coach, who's constantly pressing her to be better than her male colleagues. She's never exactly been one of the popular kids, either, but she finds what may be a friend in a new transfer student, Sung-min (War of the Arrows' Gi-woong Park). Unfortunately, his friendship couldn't have come at a worse time; it seems Ga-in's family has recently come under a death curse that causes family members to kill one another in vicious, bloody ways. Oddly (or is it?), Sung-Min seems familiar with this curse, and his advice to Ga-in plays as a constant refrain throughout the second half of the film: ""don't trust anyone.""It's a good premise, and given a director with some vision and originality, it could have been a stylish, competent-if-not-brilliant horror movie. Instead, Oh grabs a piece from horror movie A, a piece from horror movie B, etc., and sticks them all together. Even that can work okay, as long as you're a good enough artisan that the seams don't show, but Oh is not that artisan. This is nothing you haven't seen before...so why watch it again? * ",2,Utterly generic.,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,1805,"['Du', 'Saram-yida', 'Voices', 'Ki-hwan', 'Oh', '2007', 'go', 'off', 'now', 'again', 'movies', 'are', 'brought', 'here', 'marketed', 'Yet', 'Asian', 'Horror', 'Film', 'are', 'actually', 'anything', 'suffer', 'greatly', 'being', 'marketed', 'same', 'Part', 'reason', 'suffer', 'so', 'glory', 'days', 'Yet', 'Asian', 'Horror', 'films', 'are', 'large', 'long', 'gone', 'still', 'find', 'pearl', 'now', 'again', 'number', 'swine', 'have', 'increased', 'tremendously', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Case', 'point', 'Du', 'Saram-yida', 'released', 'English-speaking', 'countries', 'Voices', 're-tread', 're-tread', 'dozen', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen.Plot', 'Ga-in', 'Oldboy', 'Jin-seo', 'Yun', 'high-school', 'student', 'award-winning', 'fencer', 'not', 'enough', 'coach', 'who', 'constantly', 'pressing', 'be', 'better', 'male', 'colleagues', 'never', 'exactly', 'been', 'one', 'popular', 'kids', 'either', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'friend', 'new', 'transfer', 'student', 'Sung-min', 'War', 'Arrows', 'Gi-woong', 'Park', 'Unfortunately', 'friendship', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'worse', 'time', 'Ga-in', 'family', 'recently', 'come', 'death', 'curse', 'family', 'members', 'kill', 'one', 'vicious', 'bloody', 'ways', 'Oddly', 'Sung-Min', 'familiar', 'curse', 'advice', 'Ga-in', 'plays', 'constant', 'refrain', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'anyone', 'good', 'premise', 'given', 'director', 'vision', 'originality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stylish', 'competent-if-not-brilliant', 'horror', 'movie', 'Instead', 'Oh', 'piece', 'horror', 'movie', 'A', 'piece', 'horror', 'movie', 'B', 'etc.', 'sticks', 'together', 'Even', 'can', 'work', 'okay', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'good', 'enough', 'artisan', 'seams', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'Oh', 'not', 'artisan', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'why', 'watch', 'again', '*']",Voices

That is the scenario explored in VOICES, an Asian horror film in this years 8 Films To Die For festival.This was the second film I chose to view of the 8, trying to go in order of least to most interest.  I didn't care much for REINCARNATION from the first festival, and honestly have seen few Asian horror films that I liked, so I didn't bring a very high expectation level to this one.  I can say that, despite some flaws, I liked it more than I expected.The film begins with an inexplicable scene of a kid having witnessed a horrible murder in his own home, and then moves swiftly to our main character Ga-in Kim, who witnesses her Aunt being flung from a balcony at her own wedding, and later sees her brutally stabbed by her other Aunt (NOTE: the film is not shy in covering the screen with buckets of blood and gore).  The surviving Aunt tells Kim that she had been jealous of her sister, and ultimately felt an overwhelming urge to kill her.It isn't long before Kim seems to have elicited the same feeling in others, as her friends, then family all begin to attack her, one-by-one, trying to kill her.  As the film progresses, we soon learn there is indeed a force behind these murderous motives.As Asian horror films go, this one was not so bad.  I think there is a natural cultural disconnect when you are dealing with foreign film, so a lot of the difficulty comes from not quite understanding ""their world"" and in what is lost in translation of the script.  The main problem I have with this film is that the pattern of Kim being attacked by her family and friends quickly becomes predictable and tired.  Every time she seems completely out matched, and every time someone swoops in at the last moment to save her.  It becomes improbable very quickly.The writers try to pad the film out a little by having Kim take a side trip to an old man in the country to hear his story of how he too fell victim to the curse.  This device does little more than add to the running time, as he has no answers for her.The film also contains a kind of ""SIXTH SENSE"" style twist in the end, but you will see it coming from miles away, especially if you are up to date on supernatural films of the last decade.I think this would have been a very effective short film, but as a 90-minute feature, the plot seems stretched pretty thin.  Even so, the film is beautiful to look at - the acting seems good all around, and the music stands out - beautiful and haunting, it helps to set the creepy atmosphere.  After first viewing it, I gave the film a fairly low rating - but having sat through several of the other Horrorfest clunkers, I am finding myself appreciating this one more and more.",3,"Fairly Good K-Horror Yarn - Middle Of The Road Entry in 2009's ""8 Films To Die For""",1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,2754,"['What', 'family', 'friends', 'were', 'suddenly', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'scenario', 'explored', 'VOICES', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'years', '8', 'Films', 'Die', 'festival.This', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'chose', 'view', '8', 'trying', 'go', 'order', 'least', 'most', 'interest', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'REINCARNATION', 'first', 'festival', 'honestly', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'very', 'high', 'expectation', 'level', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'flaws', 'liked', 'more', 'expected.The', 'film', 'begins', 'inexplicable', 'scene', 'kid', 'having', 'witnessed', 'horrible', 'murder', 'own', 'home', 'then', 'swiftly', 'main', 'character', 'Ga-in', 'Kim', 'who', 'Aunt', 'being', 'flung', 'balcony', 'own', 'wedding', 'later', 'brutally', 'stabbed', 'other', 'Aunt', 'NOTE', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'covering', 'screen', 'buckets', 'blood', 'gore', 'surviving', 'Aunt', 'tells', 'Kim', 'had', 'been', 'jealous', 'sister', 'ultimately', 'felt', 'overwhelming', 'urge', 'kill', 'her.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Kim', 'have', 'elicited', 'same', 'feeling', 'others', 'friends', 'then', 'family', 'begin', 'attack', 'one-by-one', 'trying', 'kill', 'film', 'soon', 'learn', 'indeed', 'force', 'murderous', 'motives.As', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'go', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'think', 'natural', 'cultural', 'disconnect', 'when', 'are', 'dealing', 'foreign', 'film', 'lot', 'difficulty', 'not', 'quite', 'understanding', 'world', 'what', 'lost', 'translation', 'script', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'pattern', 'Kim', 'being', 'attacked', 'family', 'friends', 'quickly', 'predictable', 'tired', 'time', 'completely', 'matched', 'time', 'someone', 'swoops', 'last', 'moment', 'save', 'improbable', 'very', 'quickly.The', 'writers', 'try', 'pad', 'film', 'out', 'little', 'having', 'Kim', 'take', 'side', 'trip', 'old', 'man', 'country', 'hear', 'story', 'how', 'too', 'fell', 'victim', 'curse', 'device', 'little', 'more', 'add', 'running', 'time', 'answers', 'her.The', 'film', 'also', 'kind', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'style', 'twist', 'end', 'will', 'see', 'coming', 'miles', 'away', 'especially', 'are', 'up', 'date', 'supernatural', 'films', 'last', 'decade.I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'effective', 'short', 'film', '90-minute', 'feature', 'plot', 'stretched', 'pretty', 'thin', 'Even', 'so', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'acting', 'good', 'music', 'out', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'set', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'first', 'viewing', 'gave', 'film', 'fairly', 'low', 'rating', 'having', 'sat', 'several', 'other', 'Horrorfest', 'clunkers', 'am', 'finding', 'appreciating', 'one', 'more', 'more']",Voices
1226551,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001P9N9AI,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 4]","Re-titled and re-packaged as ""VOICES"" as part of this latest ""After Dark Horror fest"" film festival, director Ki-Hwan Oh's ""Some Behind You"" (aka. Du Saram Yida) is a South Korean commercial horror film--when I say ""commercial"", I mean because it has an appealing cast, and somewhat compelling characters adapted from a comic book by Kang Kyung-Ok. I wasn't expecting much when I saw this film, since most commercial Korean films usually suck but I decided to give it a chance. I should've known much better.Kim Ga-In (Jin-Seo Yun, she`s actually 24 yrs. old) is a high school student dating Hyung Joong, a medical intern (a 16-18 year old dating a mid-20`s intern, a little far-fetched don't you think?). One day, her aunt Ji-Sun falls off the balcony during her wedding day, and later on killed by her other aunt Jung-Sun. Soon after, strange things begin to occur as a significant number of people attempts to kill Ga-In; the school bookworm, her teacher, her fencing partner, and then even her own mother gets into the mix. She realizes that something is not right, and decides to leave--(really?) Now, she must get to the bottom of a so-called ""family curse"" that drives the smallest amount animosity turn to violent behavior.The film's direction and script is rather very unfocused and very undisciplined in the way it lacked credibility in its proceedings. A lot of things happen that require a very large suspension of disbelief. Silly elements are introduced, the film tries to point a finger to reasoning, and logic--one minute it is talking about curses, then we see a crazed murder plot in the final act. What makes it worst is the manner it all puts everything together in such a convoluted fashion that felt too cheap and made no sense. I don't really mind an abundance of subplots so long as the direction makes sense of them all by establishing groundwork; director Oh terribly fails in this needed execution and goes for cheap surprises that neither adds a psychological effect nor a narrative surprise.The screenplay by Lee Hyo-Chul is big mess, it became laughable and preposterous the longer it went; with her mother apologizing to Ga-In's attempted murder and then there's a mysterious guy named Seok-Min--who looked like a creepy anime character--is he a figment of Ga-In's imagination or something else? Well, her friend Myung-Hee saw him so he is no phantom or ""figment"" even though the script suggests otherwise. Also, whatever happened to the cops? I thought a number of killings would raise a red flag on this family. The curse's own development seemed too convoluted that it was so obvious that its rules lacked consistency. Actually, it is just one huge messy storyline with twists so ubiquitous.To its credit, the cinematography does look very slick and cool as with other more mainstream Korean horror films. The film does looked very pretty, with some scenes utilizing an effective use of CGI effects. The scene with the floating mid-air pool of blood is freaky. The film also has a good share of blood and mild gore, as it displays its somewhat violent sequences. The performance by Jin-Seo Kim is competent enough, she is after a good actress although you would be hard-pressed to notice in this film given the script she has to work with.""Voices"" is one entry in the books of Korean horror, that looks pretty. Unfortunately, all its good looks are overshadowed by a very uninspired script, unfocused direction and a cheap attempt for a cerebral surprise. A Horror film has to have its rules and groundwork well established, otherwise it would result in a very annoying experience. Personally, I think it should have kept its original title in U.S. shores--and as to why it was picked for ""Horror fest"" I have no idea. Sometimes, I just have to listen to my gut feeling or to the voice behind me--BOO!!Rental [2 - Stars]",2,"2 - Stars: If Only You Would Die...(Originally titled ""Someone Behind You"")",1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,3854,"['Re-titled', 're-packaged', 'VOICES', 'part', 'latest', 'Dark', 'Horror', 'fest', 'film', 'festival', 'director', 'Ki-Hwan', 'Oh', 'aka', 'Du', 'Saram', 'Yida', 'South', 'Korean', 'commercial', 'horror', 'film', 'when', 'say', 'commercial', 'mean', 'appealing', 'cast', 'somewhat', 'compelling', 'characters', 'adapted', 'comic', 'book', 'Kang', 'Kyung-Ok', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'most', 'commercial', 'Korean', 'films', 'usually', 'suck', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'much', 'better.Kim', 'Ga-In', 'Jin-Seo', 'Yun', 's', 'actually', '24', 'yrs', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'dating', 'Hyung', 'Joong', 'medical', 'intern', '16-18', 'year', 'old', 'dating', 'mid-20', 's', 'intern', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'One', 'day', 'aunt', 'Ji-Sun', 'balcony', 'wedding', 'day', 'later', 'killed', 'other', 'aunt', 'Jung-Sun', 'Soon', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'occur', 'significant', 'number', 'people', 'attempts', 'kill', 'Ga-In', 'school', 'bookworm', 'teacher', 'fencing', 'partner', 'then', 'even', 'own', 'mother', 'mix', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'leave', 'really', 'Now', 'must', 'get', 'bottom', 'so-called', 'family', 'curse', 'smallest', 'amount', 'animosity', 'turn', 'violent', 'behavior.The', 'film', 'direction', 'script', 'rather', 'very', 'unfocused', 'very', 'undisciplined', 'way', 'lacked', 'credibility', 'proceedings', 'lot', 'things', 'happen', 'require', 'very', 'large', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Silly', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'film', 'tries', 'point', 'finger', 'reasoning', 'logic', 'one', 'minute', 'talking', 'curses', 'then', 'see', 'crazed', 'murder', 'plot', 'final', 'act', 'What', 'manner', 'everything', 'together', 'such', 'convoluted', 'fashion', 'felt', 'too', 'cheap', 'made', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'abundance', 'subplots', 'so', 'long', 'direction', 'sense', 'establishing', 'groundwork', 'director', 'Oh', 'terribly', 'needed', 'execution', 'cheap', 'surprises', 'psychological', 'effect', 'narrative', 'surprise.The', 'screenplay', 'Lee', 'Hyo-Chul', 'big', 'mess', 'became', 'laughable', 'preposterous', 'longer', 'went', 'mother', 'apologizing', 'Ga-In', 'attempted', 'murder', 'then', 'mysterious', 'guy', 'named', 'Seok-Min', 'who', 'looked', 'creepy', 'anime', 'character', 'figment', 'Ga-In', 'imagination', 'something', 'else', 'Well', 'friend', 'Myung-Hee', 'saw', 'so', 'phantom', 'figment', 'even', 'script', 'otherwise', 'Also', 'happened', 'cops', 'thought', 'number', 'killings', 'would', 'raise', 'red', 'flag', 'family', 'curse', 'own', 'development', 'seemed', 'too', 'convoluted', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'rules', 'lacked', 'consistency', 'Actually', 'just', 'one', 'huge', 'messy', 'storyline', 'twists', 'so', 'ubiquitous.To', 'credit', 'cinematography', 'look', 'very', 'slick', 'cool', 'other', 'more', 'mainstream', 'Korean', 'horror', 'films', 'film', 'looked', 'very', 'pretty', 'scenes', 'utilizing', 'effective', 'use', 'CGI', 'effects', 'scene', 'floating', 'mid-air', 'pool', 'blood', 'freaky', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'share', 'blood', 'mild', 'gore', 'somewhat', 'violent', 'sequences', 'performance', 'Jin-Seo', 'Kim', 'competent', 'enough', 'good', 'actress', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'notice', 'film', 'given', 'script', 'work', 'Voices', 'one', 'entry', 'books', 'Korean', 'horror', 'pretty', 'Unfortunately', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'very', 'uninspired', 'script', 'unfocused', 'direction', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'cerebral', 'surprise', 'Horror', 'film', 'have', 'rules', 'groundwork', 'well', 'established', 'would', 'result', 'very', 'annoying', 'experience', 'Personally', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'original', 'title', 'U.S.', 'shores', 'why', 'was', 'picked', 'Horror', 'fest', 'have', 'idea', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'listen', 'gut', 'feeling', 'voice', 'BOO', 'Rental', '[', '2', 'Stars', ']']",Voices
