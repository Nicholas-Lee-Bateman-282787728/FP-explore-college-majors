They were insanely popular in Europe, Australia, Spain, etc. Most Americans found their brand of Euro-pop to be adolescent. Many of the melodies were no better than what you hear in children's songs. Strip away the production and you have very spare music that can sound clunky to US ears. In this movie, Benny even admits that there isn't much to their international hit, ""The winner takes it all."" It consists of nothing but two musical phrases - one repeated three times and one repeated twice. If you have ever tried to play ABBA on a guitar, it is embarassing how monotonous and simple their songs all sound (except for the more complex ""Dancing Queen."" I was never a fan.

861479,A21PISUDSXS9AU,B00065TZE6,Jay L. Rudko,"[4, 4]","If anyone doubts the influence ABBA had on the music scene of the 70's, this should get rid of them. Since their win at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with ""Waterloo"", this Swedish supergroup has become a true household name. When the music of a group who had disbanded as long ago as they did endures to the point of a musical being created, based on the songs we all grew to love, there can be no greater testimonial. This video documentary covers the 5th anniversary of the opening of ""MammaMia"", the musical that was ""Bjorn"" of Abba's songs. Benny, Bjorn, and Frida were all there; Agnetha's fear of travel got the better of her and she declined to attend. But this documentary didn't stop there. It dug much deeper, into the band, its members, and both good and bad times. It seems all of the members aged well; Frida still looks amazing, Agnetha also looks great, although we only saw her in filmed clips. While it was mentioned that Agnetha is not comfortable with interviews in English, she did some in English and some in Swedish with subtitles. There's the impression that she now lives as a recluse; she dispelled that myth and said that her life has taken a different turn. She also has a new studio album that was mentioned in the video. But the real star of this program is the music. It shines here, and makes you want to dig out the CD's and listen to them nonstop. This is definitely a video your collection needs. Now, if the folks at UMG would just give us these hits again, this time in full 5.1, I'd be ecstatic.",5,Mamma Mia!!!

861480,A3LX5HJUVX8IX7,B00065TZE6,Joey Saylor,"[29, 29]","I found this 90 minute documentary to be very well done, very well edited and well produced. There aren't really too many  revelations from the interviews, but the collection of clips from yesterday spliced together with current footage of the band members was a really nice, nostalgic touch. Especially the moments from the 1974 Eurovision song contest that rocketed their careers put back to back with the footage of them getting ready to go out on stage for Mamma Mia in 2004.One thing I did enjoy about the interviews were the comments by Agnetha taken from various sources and timed with various events. Some of her quotes are translated from Swedish, some in English. These segments prove to be very useful. They tease her appearance at the Mamma Mia opening, but even without prior knowledge most fans know she wasn't going to show. It's sad because it's so rare you see the members of ABBA together like that. Someday hopefully she will appear with them at least one more time (don't hold your breath).Other goodies are footage of Benny and Bjorn in their early careers with the Hep Stars and the Hootenany Singers, Frida's solo career before meeting them, ABBA concert footage of ""He Is Your Brother"" and video clips for ""People Need Love"" and ""So Long"". Michael Tretow talks about how they applied Phil Spector's sound methods to their recordings and provides good insight to various topics. The narrator is a little over enthusiastic in his appraisal and tells us how much he wanted to see Frida without her clothes on. I didn't need that much information.Note on the bonus features: the interviews with Frida and Benny are listed as full, however they just pasted together the clips shown throughout the documentary with a few extra questions. The interviewer is not even heard asking the questions or even seen.If you didn't believe ABBA was on a par with the Beatles before, you may change your mind after watching this.",5,Buy it for the archival footage if anything else,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,1934,"['found', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'edited', 'well', 'produced', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'too', 'many', 'revelations', 'interviews', 'collection', 'clips', 'yesterday', 'spliced', 'together', 'current', 'footage', 'band', 'members', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'nostalgic', 'touch', 'Especially', 'moments', '1974', 'Eurovision', 'song', 'contest', 'rocketed', 'careers', 'put', 'back', 'back', 'footage', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'out', 'stage', 'Mamma', 'Mia', '2004.One', 'thing', 'did', 'enjoy', 'interviews', 'were', 'comments', 'Agnetha', 'taken', 'various', 'sources', 'timed', 'various', 'events', 'quotes', 'are', 'translated', 'Swedish', 'English', 'segments', 'prove', 'be', 'very', 'useful', 'tease', 'appearance', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'opening', 'even', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'most', 'fans', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'show', 'sad', 'so', 'rare', 'see', 'members', 'ABBA', 'together', 'Someday', 'hopefully', 'will', 'appear', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'breath', '.Other', 'goodies', 'are', 'footage', 'Benny', 'Bjorn', 'early', 'careers', 'Hep', 'Stars', 'Hootenany', 'Singers', 'Frida', 'solo', 'career', 'meeting', 'ABBA', 'concert', 'footage', 'Brother', 'video', 'clips', 'People', 'Need', 'Love', 'So', 'Long', 'Michael', 'Tretow', 'talks', 'how', 'applied', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'sound', 'methods', 'recordings', 'good', 'insight', 'various', 'topics', 'narrator', 'little', 'over', 'enthusiastic', 'appraisal', 'tells', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'see', 'Frida', 'clothes', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'that', 'much', 'information.Note', 'bonus', 'features', 'interviews', 'Frida', 'Benny', 'are', 'listed', 'full', 'however', 'just', 'pasted', 'together', 'clips', 'shown', 'documentary', 'few', 'extra', 'questions', 'interviewer', 'not', 'even', 'heard', 'asking', 'questions', 'even', 'seen.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ABBA', 'was', 'par', 'Beatles', 'may', 'change', 'mind', 'watching']",N/A
861481,A1PVM3V959JFYM,B00065TZE6,Lovely to See You,"[15, 17]","Okay, I admit it; Linda is an ABBA schmuck.  After 30 years, they are still getting massive airplay all over the world, and a lot of people who would never have admitted they were into this group years ago are now acknowledging what we collectively always knew:  Most everyone loves ABBA, except some of us will never admit it.  That's okay, though, because I went through that in my later teens up until my late 30's.  For all you closet fans out there, this DVD is a great purchase, because you will finally realize that it's not these four incredibly talented people's fault that they had a chemistry that the public reacted to.  Even their manager Stig Andersson, who propelled them to fame, doesn't know why they took off in the way they did.  Let me ask all you naysayers the all-important question:  if this group was so disposable, how is it that their music is still so popular after 3 decades, and they have not only enjoyed a revival, but the music has made a great stage production?  It's true:  Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulveus are very good songwriters with their sesibilities about them at all times.  Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-frid Lyngstad, their former wives and partners, were beautiful vocalists together, and what they had between them was something very special while it lasted.  Also, they have never had a reunion since their breakup in 1982, and they don't intend to.  The heartless hit machine rep they've suffered from is not only a joke, but this DVD will show you just how human and talented they really were and are.One thing I have been struck by from this particular DVD is how warm, intelligent, and humble Bjorn Ulveus is, and how much more likable and full of life Frida, rather than pretty blond pinup girl Agnetha, actually is.  This DVD is full of lots of surprises for the naysayers and lots of treats for those of us who knew these Swedes were talented, personable beings who simply disliked touring for all the reasons anyone who never toured could understand.  The interviews are fun, the footage priceless, and the music rich and melodious.  Most of all, you will pull this DVD out of your player with a smile on your face and realize you never have to dress like you did at any time the group was together again!
