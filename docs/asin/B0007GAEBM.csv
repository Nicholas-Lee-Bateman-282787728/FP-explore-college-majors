880597,A34PAZQ73SL163,B0007GAEBM,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[201, 309]","There is no individual in contemporary America who is as derided and despised by the left than Ann Coulter.  She is the object of constant ridicule which is a direct result of her efforts to combat them.  So hated is she that when one attempts to defend her, many of her enemies will be tranferred over to you.  I recall a time that I reviewed Slander and received hate mail that mostly attacked Ann.  One memorable piece of mail accused me of being gay because I loved Coulter who was obviously a transsexual (in this person's sick opinion).There is no question though that conservatives need people like Coulter as much as she needs The New York Times.  The bombshell pundit exerts pressure that widens the boundaries of what is acceptable to discuss and what is not in our society.  In this film, she even defends the undefendable such as ""wars for oil"" beging legitimate.  She is the true Queen of Political Incorrectness and her rants, speeches, writing, and argumentation provides considerable benefit to the rest of us as she extends the ground in which we can maneuver.  Coulter loves to bait her enemies and there's no better example of this than in her ""convert them to Christianity"" line after 9/11.  No one, including me, would agree with her, but I bet that she doesn't believe in a US sponsored crusade herself.  The only reason that she said it was to provoke and anger her opponents.  She suceeded in this endeavor admirably.What is so interesting about this documentary is the way in which her enemies are filmed and their arguments are included in the body of the narrative.  My favorite moment came when a kid approached her wanting his t-shirt signed. It read ""Traitor"" so Coulter penned the words ""Have Fun in Guantanamo"" onto it.  Divine wit.  Without all of the Mein Kampf carrying leftists, this film wouldn't have been half as good.  My only reservation about Is it True... concerns its length.  A subject like this one deserves more than 37 minutes.",5,I Stand by Ann--And You Will Too.,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,1975,"['individual', 'contemporary', 'America', 'who', 'as', 'derided', 'despised', 'left', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'object', 'constant', 'ridicule', 'direct', 'result', 'efforts', 'combat', 'So', 'hated', 'when', 'one', 'defend', 'many', 'enemies', 'will', 'be', 'tranferred', 'recall', 'time', 'reviewed', 'Slander', 'received', 'hate', 'mail', 'mostly', 'attacked', 'Ann', 'One', 'memorable', 'piece', 'mail', 'accused', 'being', 'gay', 'loved', 'Coulter', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'transsexual', 'person', 'sick', 'opinion', 'question', 'need', 'people', 'like', 'Coulter', 'as', 'much', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'bombshell', 'pundit', 'pressure', 'boundaries', 'what', 'acceptable', 'discuss', 'what', 'not', 'society', 'film', 'even', 'undefendable', 'such', 'wars', 'oil', 'beging', 'legitimate', 'true', 'Queen', 'Political', 'Incorrectness', 'rants', 'speeches', 'writing', 'argumentation', 'considerable', 'benefit', 'rest', 'ground', 'can', 'maneuver', 'Coulter', 'bait', 'enemies', 'better', 'example', 'convert', 'Christianity', 'line', '9/11', 'one', 'including', 'would', 'agree', 'bet', ""n't"", 'believe', 'US', 'sponsored', 'crusade', 'only', 'reason', 'said', 'was', 'provoke', 'anger', 'opponents', 'suceeded', 'endeavor', 'so', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'way', 'enemies', 'are', 'filmed', 'arguments', 'are', 'included', 'body', 'narrative', 'favorite', 'moment', 'came', 'when', 'kid', 'approached', 'wanting', 't-shirt', 'signed', 'read', 'Traitor', 'so', 'Coulter', 'penned', 'words', 'Have', 'Fun', 'Guantanamo', 'Divine', 'wit', 'Mein', 'Kampf', 'carrying', 'leftists', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'half', 'good', 'only', 'reservation', 'True', 'length', 'subject', 'one', 'more', '37', 'minutes']",N/A
880598,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0007GAEBM,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 0]","`Is It True What They Say About Ann?' is a low budget, but entertaining documentary film offering both the fans and foes of Ann Coulter an insightful look into the private person and public persona of one of the most controversial conservative political figures in America today.As many other reviews have already pointed out this is definitely not one of the most professionally made documentaries on the market. However Ann shines through the mediocre production values as only Ann could. Her razor sharp wit, biting comebacks and fearless rhetoric is on full display. Whether you agree with her viewpoint or not you have to admire her for being willing to face her most vehement critics head on with a smile and flair that has established her as an American icon. You either love her or hate her, but you certainly can't ignore her.Recommended viewing for those of all political persuasions.",4,"""You Either Like Hate Mail Or You Don't, And I Like It""",1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,894,"['True', 'What', 'Say', 'Ann', 'low', 'budget', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'film', 'offering', 'fans', 'foes', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'insightful', 'look', 'private', 'person', 'public', 'persona', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'conservative', 'political', 'figures', 'America', 'today.As', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'professionally', 'made', 'documentaries', 'market', 'However', 'Ann', 'shines', 'mediocre', 'production', 'values', 'only', 'Ann', 'could', 'razor', 'sharp', 'wit', 'biting', 'comebacks', 'fearless', 'rhetoric', 'full', 'display', 'agree', 'viewpoint', 'not', 'have', 'admire', 'being', 'willing', 'face', 'most', 'vehement', 'critics', 'head', 'smile', 'flair', 'established', 'American', 'icon', 'love', 'hate', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'her.Recommended', 'viewing', 'political', 'persuasions']",N/A

And if she really does ""speak for mainstream America"", I'd be quite scared to think my fellow Americans believe that...- Oklahoma City bomber Tim McVeigh should've gone to the NY Times building- We lost the Vietnam War because of now-disabled vets- The best punishment for ex-Pres. Clinton's misdeeds was assasination- The ""Big 3"" broadcast TV networks should be shut down, and the NY Times censored (Nazi Germany, anyone?)And contrary to what that one reviewer said, it's Coulter who tries to shut down opposing viewpoints by taking quotes of context, using her countless stereotypical views (liberals hate America, hate all religions but Islam, etc.) to demonize those on the left, and completely ignoring the fallacies within her own party.

880601,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B0007GAEBM,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[5, 11]","I like Ann Coulter. I also enjoyed this short documentary which gives a little bit of insight into her style and motivation. I can see, however, why many people would dislike her. She does not give up, she takes no pity and she fights personal attacks with facts. That is pretty radical when the norm is to just call all conservatives Nazis or worse. Her wit is dripping with sarcasm and she does not really care what people say about her, especially if it is demonstrably false.This documentary follows Ann around to some of her speaking engagements. It examines some of the things she says that are controversial. These include things like we need to fight those who would kill us and it would probably be safer to kill them. The best part in my opinion is showing her speaking to college students. It is clear that some of her opponents are clueless about world events and show up just because she is ""evil"". She is evil because she is conservative.The production values of this project are fairly low. The titles and transitions are somewhat amateurish but they are effective enough. The actual film is fairly short, well under an hour, but the ""extras"" include about 80 minutes of more interviews. These tend to be topical.If you like Ann, you will likely enjoy this DVD.

I'm going to review this DVD product without reviewing Ann's politics.This short -- to short in my opinion -- documentary did an acceptable if awkward job of showing just who Ann Coulter is.  I wish it had been a more polished production.  It looks like it was shot on a high quality cam corder and subjected to less than stellar quality editing.  Basically, if I spent a couple thousand bucks on a camera and some computer video editing software, I could do the same thing myself.Part of the ""awkward"" stuff was:Camera jerking around during interviews.One-way Ann-only conversation.  Someone off camera is talking, but they don't have a microphone, so you know someone is talking to Ann and you can hear Ann but you can't hear the other side of the conversation.Too-long awkward fade-in and fade outs.Little drab fonts used on big screen for transitions.Waiting too long to fade in or out during a transition.Anyway, I don't know if I'm using the right video terminology but it all comes across as an amateurish production.  People who've watched some of the recent liberal documentaries like ""Outfoxed"" should at least feel at home with the production values.In this case however, quanitity does have a quality all its own, and you do get about three hours of content.  My favorite segment wasn't the documentary itself but an over 30 minutes long ""special feature"" that showed Ann giving a speech with a question and answer session.  I felt like I got to know her a lot more during that segment than perhaps during the documentary itself.So, once you've watched the whole thing you'll likely know whether or not it's really true what they say about Ann, whether you actually like her or not.",3,Accomplishes its purpose but Ann deserves better.,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,1836,"['Just', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'just', 'how', 'provocative', 'one', 'way', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'controversial', 'become', ""'m"", 'going', 'review', 'DVD', 'product', 'reviewing', 'Ann', 'politics.This', 'short', 'short', 'opinion', 'documentary', 'did', 'acceptable', 'awkward', 'job', 'showing', 'just', 'who', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'polished', 'production', 'was', 'shot', 'high', 'quality', 'cam', 'corder', 'subjected', 'less', 'stellar', 'quality', 'editing', 'Basically', 'spent', 'couple', 'thousand', 'bucks', 'camera', 'computer', 'video', 'editing', 'software', 'could', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'myself.Part', 'awkward', 'stuff', 'was', 'Camera', 'jerking', 'interviews.One-way', 'Ann-only', 'conversation', 'Someone', 'camera', 'talking', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'microphone', 'know', 'someone', 'talking', 'Ann', 'can', 'hear', 'Ann', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'other', 'side', 'conversation.Too-long', 'awkward', 'fade-in', 'fade', 'outs.Little', 'drab', 'fonts', 'used', 'big', 'screen', 'transitions.Waiting', 'too', 'long', 'fade', 'transition.Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'using', 'right', 'video', 'terminology', 'across', 'amateurish', 'production', 'People', 'who', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'recent', 'liberal', 'documentaries', 'Outfoxed', 'should', 'least', 'feel', 'home', 'production', 'values.In', 'case', 'however', 'quanitity', 'have', 'quality', 'own', 'do', 'get', 'three', 'hours', 'content', 'favorite', 'segment', 'was', ""n't"", 'documentary', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'special', 'feature', 'showed', 'Ann', 'giving', 'speech', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'felt', 'got', 'know', 'lot', 'more', 'segment', 'perhaps', 'documentary', 'itself.So', 'once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'know', 'not', 'really', 'true', 'what', 'say', 'Ann', 'actually', 'not']",N/A

The problem with the movie is that it's only 37 minutes long and still padded with footage of Ann talking to her mom on the phone and things like that, and it doesn't provide much actual information. It does provide proof of one thing we could already guess about Ann Coulter: She loves to be provocative. She says she loves to get hate mail. It seems like she exaggerates her hatred for liberals in order to be provocative because she's addicted to arguing and debating. And not debating with the intent of reaching any conclusions but debating just for the sake of debating.So, the film was only mildly interesting, but not worth the price of the DVD.
