While they have been heavily overshadowed in favor of The Flintstones, the family of the future has had a everlasting impact on animation that still remains enjoyable today, as it did back in the 60's, and when they came back in the 80's as well. The show with George, Elroy and its season which introduced Orbity has had a great deal of laughs in the 1980's. But through it all, in a great deal of animation during Hanna-Barbera's classic giants, they still are just as fun as you could imagine. A few years ago, the shows second season started to be released on DVD, but not all of the cartoons were released for die hard Jetsons fans.But more are still coming and they are worth the effort.The Jetsons: Season 2 Volume 2 continues the Jetsons classic 80's run to a whole new generation of those whom are into Spongebob Squarepants or The Penguins Of Madagascar. The collection of episodes still remain as classic today, as they were when they came out in 1985. The DVD features a lot of favorites for die hard fans, and are fun to enjoy for all ages whom have never seen Astro, Jane or George in laughter and action. The episodes have all been remastered, and include funny shorts including To Tell The Truth, where George gets stuck in a situation into a accidental space trip, while Jane is eagerly awaiting for him to return for a dinner for two out, and Swiss Family Jetsons where George gets laid off, and the family moves to a a asteroid called Paradisio for rest and relaxation, which comes back to haunt them, and A Jetson's Christmas Carol, giving a nice twist on the holiday classic where Astro opens his gift early and gets ill, as is where Mr. Spacely keeps George working late while Mr. Spacely shows a Scrooge-like anger at letting his bossy ways get the better of him with ghosts of the past, present and future coming to warn him of his ways.All in all, if you did buy the first Volume of The Jetsons Season 2, than you'll definitely want to buy this DVD set of The Jetsons: Season 2 Volume 2. Even if you haven't seen this great classic family of animation yet, than you really should give this DVD set a great glance at. I loved watching The Jetsons when I was a child, and it still feels just as classic and funny today, as it did back then. You definitely know why The Jetsons are the family of the 21st Century, and this is a great template of what Hanna and Barbera made a great team in making funny cartoons.Price: BRemastering: B+Shorts: B 1/2+Overall: B",4,"Jetson, You're Not Fired!!",1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,2561,"['hard', 'believe', 'year', '50th', 'anniversary', 'Jetsons', 'have', 'been', 'heavily', 'overshadowed', 'favor', 'Flintstones', 'family', 'future', 'had', 'everlasting', 'impact', 'animation', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'today', 'did', 'back', '60', 'when', 'came', 'back', '80', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'George', 'Elroy', 'season', 'introduced', 'Orbity', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'laughs', '1980', 'great', 'deal', 'animation', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'classic', 'giants', 'still', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'could', 'imagine', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'shows', 'second', 'season', 'started', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'not', 'cartoons', 'were', 'released', 'die', 'hard', 'Jetsons', 'fans.But', 'more', 'are', 'still', 'coming', 'are', 'effort.The', 'Jetsons', 'Season', '2', 'Volume', '2', 'Jetsons', 'classic', '80', 'run', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'whom', 'are', 'Spongebob', 'Squarepants', 'Penguins', 'Madagascar', 'collection', 'episodes', 'still', 'remain', 'classic', 'today', 'were', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1985', 'DVD', 'lot', 'favorites', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'are', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'ages', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Astro', 'Jane', 'George', 'laughter', 'action', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'include', 'funny', 'shorts', 'including', 'Tell', 'Truth', 'where', 'George', 'stuck', 'situation', 'accidental', 'space', 'trip', 'Jane', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'return', 'dinner', 'two', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Jetsons', 'where', 'George', 'laid', 'off', 'family', 'asteroid', 'called', 'Paradisio', 'rest', 'relaxation', 'back', 'haunt', 'A', 'Jetson', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'giving', 'nice', 'twist', 'holiday', 'classic', 'where', 'Astro', 'gift', 'early', 'ill', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Spacely', 'George', 'working', 'late', 'Mr.', 'Spacely', 'Scrooge-like', 'anger', 'letting', 'bossy', 'ways', 'get', 'better', 'ghosts', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'coming', 'warn', 'ways.All', 'did', 'buy', 'first', 'Volume', 'Jetsons', 'Season', '2', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'Jetsons', 'Season', '2', 'Volume', '2', 'Even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'great', 'classic', 'family', 'animation', 'yet', 'really', 'should', 'give', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'glance', 'loved', 'watching', 'Jetsons', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'still', 'just', 'classic', 'funny', 'today', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'definitely', 'know', 'why', 'Jetsons', 'are', 'family', '21st', 'Century', 'great', 'template', 'what', 'Hanna', 'Barbera', 'made', 'great', 'team', 'making', 'funny', 'cartoons.Price', 'BRemastering', 'B+Shorts', '1/2+Overall', 'B']","The Jetsons: Season 2, Vol. 2"

1510520,AQE1QZR23ZCUN,B00652FG7O,SimpsonsFan99,"[2, 2]","There are several episodes of ""The Jetsons""--Season 2, Volume 2 which I bought through Amazon On Demand Video because I thought they would never be released on DVD, including ""Swiss Family Jetson"", ""Space Bong"" and ""Little Bundle of Trouble""--some of these could possibly spawn sequels if a new ""Jetsons"" series is launched by Seth McFarlane on FOX.  I was impressed with the transfer of the master tapes to DVD of the episodes, though I was a little bit less than impressed than the rest of the boxed ""Jetsons"" sets.  The discs weren't even individually labeled (such as a George & Jane disc as opposed to an Elroy or Judy), as it just had the same logo on each one.  There are, unfortunately, no half-stars on this rating system, so I am systematically inclined to give this 3.5 out of 5--three stars for the quality of the episodes and only half a star for the shoddy marketing on the behalf of Warner Brothers.  I hope WB can give the final ten episodes from 1987 (Season Three) a little better treatment when those are finally released on DVD.  What an injustice Warners gave the Jetsons on their 50th anniversary!  The studio should be ashamed!
