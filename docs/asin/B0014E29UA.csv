This trait is usually seen as a drawback and is most often frowned upon, but he's seemed to master the art of the typecasted actor. The film opens with a scene at an underground Military Research Facility during the 1930's. Inside the facility top military officials are observing the results of a Soldier who has just smoked Marijuana in order to determine its psychological effects; the results, as you can imagine, are hilarious.Cut to modern times, James Franco plays a humble pot dealer that has the persona of not just being the 'go-to-guy' for pot, but a 'genuine friend'. Seth's character makes it apparent that he is not looking to expand on the relationship during their 'transactions'; but when he opts to stay a while, a true comedic chemistry is portrayed.You may or may not have heard that,**drumroll** 'Pineapple Express' is a brand of weed based upon an actual weather effect in the Pacific Ocean*; Franco introduces it to Rogen as an ultra-rare strain available only thru him(the way he describes the rarity of it is comical ingenuity).After Pineapple Express is introduced into the film; Rogen, who prefers to smoke while on the job, comes across a 'wrong place at the wrong time' situation and witnesses a murder occur. The killer, who sees Rogen's attempt to get away, only after hitting the car in front of and behind him, links the witness through the roach he threw out of his car window to the dealer(Franco) he buys it from. This incident would begin the buddy comedy-esque story filled with cat and mouse style pursuing, ridiculous humor in between, moderate violence and a shootout towards the end of the flick.The film is rated 'R' and YES, there is a pro-marijuana undertone to the movie, so if you are sensitive to this topic, dont bother watching it. HIGHly recommended comedy for the liberal, open minded crowd. Solid 4 outta 5 Comedy.*[...]",4,"""It's almost a shame to smoke it.

It does for comedy action pictures what Plan 9 from outer space did for horror sci-fi cinema.The picture is about a repossion man whose best friend is a pot dealer and he has a high school girlfriend. The man spies a murder when he goes to give a summons to another pothead and has to take it on the lamb because he drops his pot cigerette which is a special type only his drug dealing friend is selling. In this alleged comedy I found only 2 humorous moments in the whole picture. One is when he breaks up temporarily with his drug selling best buddy and calls his high school sweetheart because hes feeling lonely..He and she begin professing their undying love but when she mentions she wants to marry him immediately he just hangs up the phone and walks away The second funny moment is when he gets part of his ear shot off and his drug buddy tries to reattach it by holding it up to the rest of his ear.The rest of what passes for humor is characters go on and on to the point of oblivion confessing their feelings about how they feel about each other.Its as stupid as it sounds.I couldn""t help[ noticing the other praising reviews.The only way you can enjoy this turkey is if you are high on something,otherwise it has the feel of a movie written by junior high students",1,dumbest movieever,1231459200,"01 9, 2009",2009,1476,"['when', 'movie', 'hyped', 'much', 'tv', 'producers', 'think', 'runaway', 'hit', 'so', 'bad', 'producers', 'are', 'trying', 'recap', 'money.this', 'movie', 'latter', 'category', 'comedy', 'action', 'what', 'Plan', '9', 'outer', 'space', 'did', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'cinema.The', 'picture', 'repossion', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'pot', 'dealer', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'man', 'murder', 'when', 'give', 'summons', 'pothead', 'take', 'lamb', 'pot', 'cigerette', 'special', 'type', 'only', 'drug', 'dealing', 'friend', 'selling', 'alleged', 'comedy', 'found', 'only', '2', 'humorous', 'moments', 'whole', 'picture', 'One', 'when', 'up', 'temporarily', 'drug', 'selling', 'best', 'buddy', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'hes', 'feeling', 'lonely..He', 'begin', 'professing', 'undying', 'love', 'when', 'marry', 'immediately', 'just', 'up', 'phone', 'walks', 'away', 'second', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', 'part', 'ear', 'shot', 'drug', 'buddy', 'tries', 'reattach', 'holding', 'rest', 'ear.The', 'rest', 'what', 'humor', 'characters', 'go', 'point', 'oblivion', 'confessing', 'feelings', 'how', 'feel', 'other.Its', 'as', 'stupid', 'couldn', 't', 'help', '[', 'noticing', 'other', 'praising', 'reviews.The', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'enjoy', 'turkey', 'are', 'high', 'something', 'otherwise', 'feel', 'movie', 'written', 'junior', 'high', 'students']",N/A

Franco is wonderfully ditzy as the drugged-out stoner, and he has some great lines. In fact, you really have to watch it more than once to catch all the funny lines and little pieces of business from the principals.

PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is amazingly hilarious and has a non stop thrill ride story that never lets up and also never goes over the top.  It is about pot and one pot dealer in particular and his main client.  Yet this film is in no way a mere stoner film in the vein of Cheech and Chong.  It is filled with intelligent humor and a stage is set for all the performers to shine.  James Franco leads the pack and has totally changed his career with his full out comic, real portrayal of the drug dealer.  He is forever stoned and forever hilarious.  Seth Rogen shines more than ever as the client who sees a murder and turns to his dealer for help.  The comic duo these two provide is primed for the modern times.  They both rule and play off each other flawlessly.

1146582,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0014E29UA,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","The biggest problem with Pineapple Express is that you sit there and experience one misssed joke after another.  In addition to that, the majority of the storyline segments feel like a complete waste of time.  The storyline ITSELF feels like filler.  That's a sign of a bad movie.Perhaps yet another problem is that, on a personal note, I'm not too crazy about Seth Rogen as an actor.  He never really does anything particularly funny- it's more like the characters around him provide the laughs, so the humor is supposed to come from how Seth responds to said characters.  Someone completely different from him would be Jim Carrey- Carrey provides the humor himself.Anyway, Pineapple Express is mediocre for the majority of its running time.  It's about Seth's character who witnesses a murder while sitting in a parked car.  The murderers spot Seth Rogen before he drives away in a hurry, and eventually Seth and the murderers come into contact with each other.  It's a comedy film though.  Not a particularly funny one, but hey, that's the category it falls under.Despite being a comedy, it's interesting how the film has its share of graphic scenes pertaining to blood and shootings, and yet, the violent scenes aren't treated as comedy.  So the film has an extremely small portion of suspense as well.My favorite scene is *definitely* the one where Seth Rogen walks into his girlfriends parents home while the family is sitting at the dinner table. He's covered in sweat and blood and tries to explain to them that a murderer is following him and that they must leave right away.This is apparently Seth's first time meeting the parents of his girlfriend.  What an introduction!  There's quite a bit of humor involved during this part, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Proof that even a mediocre movie can make me laugh at times.Also the friend who bakes cakes for his dead cat provided a few solid laughs as well.  The entire conclusion of the storyline where all the bad guys and Seth's friends are battling each other is really exciting to watch as well.It's just amazing how pointless the majority of the storytelling is though.  A good portion of it focuses on nothing but Seth's friends sitting around and smoking weed and saying the worst jokes imaginable.  This isn't entertaining not even a *little* bit.Overall, an average film.

1146586,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0014E29UA,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 3]","After hearing just about everyone I know gush about PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, I finally got around to watching it. Perhaps I waited too long, or perhaps I've seen another movie that leaves it in the dust. But, for whatever reason, there just wasn't much appeal for me.The film I'm referring to that left Pineapple Express in the dust is none other thanTropic Thunder. Some might find the comparison unfair, but it really isn't. Both have that Jerry Bruckheimer-esque action quality to them. Both bill themselves as heavy comedies. And both have plenty of star power. But Pineapple Express started out slow, building up steam before finally getting several guffaws out of me, while Tropic Thunder did it from the first moment the screen lit up.More like a modernization of a Cheech and Chong flick, Pineapple Express shows the imbecility of the marijuana culture but does so by placing it within the vehicle of friendship. Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) stars as a 30-something-year-old loser Dale Denton who's job is that of a process server. And he's good at it. He could serve a summons on the pope if he had to. But he's also heavily into pot and gets it from his dealer-turned-buddy Saul Silver (James Franco,In the Valley of Elah). Everything is going along fine (including Dale hooking up with an 18-year-old high school hottie) until he witnesses the murder of a Chinese man at the hands of drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole,Talladega Nights) and a female police officer (Rosie Perez). Troubles deepen as Dale becomes paranoid after smoking some of the new bud he'd purchased called Pineapple Express. Saul, his dealer, is the only one in the city who has the stuff, and when Dale panicked and left behind a roach after fleeing the scene of the murder, Ted figures out who the witness might be and sends a couple of thugs out to find him.Dale and Saul flee for their lives, not that they were initially in danger, and into the woods, where they continue tokin' and eventually fall into a deep comatose state. When they awaken many hours later, they formulate a plan to find out if anyone is looking for them. They head out to Saul's distributor, a guy named Red (Danny R. McBride,Tropic Thunder) who initially tries to turn them in but later changes his karma and becomes practically immune to bullet holes.Although there are some laugh-out-loud funny moments, they don't come until later in the film. One particularly funny scene involves Red crashing through a burning barn in a car, instantly killing a thug, and then jumping from the car and shooting the dead guys foot off. Both crude and grossly hysterical.The ending is fairly anticlimactic with the stoned-out, burned-out, beat-up, and shot-up trio (Dale, Saul, and Red) sitting in a caf&eacute; waiting for a ride and sucking down food in a post-smoking haze. Not much to laugh about there.

1146597,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0014E29UA,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 3]","""Pineapple Express"" is supposedly named after a special species of marijuana, so special that James Franco's character thinks smoking it is as sinful as killing a unicorn. One wonders: How would anyone know what it's like to kill a unicorn, even if they were high at the time? A ridiculous question, I know, and I admit that my knowledge of marijuana is virtually nonexistent. If Pineapple Express truly is wonderful stuff, I'm just going to have to take Franco's word for it. I also admit that movies like this generally don't appeal to me; stoned characters doing stupid things is a sad sight to behold, in my opinion. That being said, ""Pineapple Express"" is surprising in that it's not merely a series of goofy comedic hijinx. It tells an actual story and it takes the time to develop the characters, albeit in a very immature, potheaded way. This movie is basically a drug-laced buddy flick set against the backdrop of a drug war, with two sky-high characters that unintentionally get into a giant heap of trouble.These characters are a process server named Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) and his jobless dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco). There isn't a single scene in this movie showing them sober. They smoke enough pot to make Cheech and Chong look like they were only experimenting. When Dale visits Saul's apartment after a morning of issuing subpoenas, Dale buys a bag of the newly discovered Pineapple Express marijuana, which only a few select people know about. Dale is then supposed to give a subpoena to a drug dealer named Ted Jones (Gary Cole), but this ends up not happening; while waiting in his car, smoking a joint, Dale witnesses Jones and a corrupt cop named Carol Brazier (Rosie Perez) murdering a rival drug dealer. In a panic, Dale tosses the roach on the street and speeds away ... but not before smashing into two parked cars, one of which is Brazier's patrol vehicle. When Ted finds the roach, he immediately recognizes the distinct odor and taste as Pineapple Express. As it turns out, he's the only one who supplies it. But more importantly, he's sold it to only one person: Saul's own dealer.Because of this, Dale knows that Saul is in danger. The two immediately devise a plan to meet with Saul's dealer and escape before any of Jones' henchmen can catch up. Unfortunately, it's too late--Saul's dealer, known only as Red (Danny R. McBride), has already given Saul's name to Budlofsky (Kevin Corrigan) and Matheson (Craig Robinson), Jones' right hand men. Both Dale and Saul are now on the run, and this puts Dale into even deeper trouble; Jones somehow convinces himself that Dale is a hitman hired by a rival Asian drug gang. As a result, Jones and the Asians are now at war. And two clueless stoners are caught in the middle of it.That's about as much of the general plot as you need to know. How it all turns out, you're just going to have to see for yourselves. How funny is it, you ask? Well, that would depend on your definition of ""funny."" Would you laugh at Saul's foot sticking out of a windshield while leading Officer Brazier in a dangerous car chase? Or Saul and Dale selling some of the Pineapple Express to a group of adolescent boys? Do you see the humor in Saul sticking his thumb through the fly of his pants, suggesting an alternative way to hitchhike? I'm not going to say where I stand on these particular moments; I was more taken with the suspense of the story, inevitably leading to a showdown between Ted Jones and his rivals. I will, however, make note of the film's prologue, which begins, strangely enough, in 1937. Shot in black and white, those first few minutes sort of play out like an R rated version of ""Reefer Madness,"" with a secret military faction determining once and for all that marijuana should be illegal in the United States.I'll also make note of James Franco's performance, which is thoroughly convincing, probably more so than the performances of Seth Rogen and Danny R. McBride. Franco's character, much like the film as a whole, gleefully celebrates the very existence of marijuana. Some may respond to this movie for that alone, which is fine, although I hope they don't lose track of the fascinating story that can actually keep you going. Had ""Pineapple Express"" been nothing but a back-to-back series of sophomoric gags, we'd probably be having a very different conversation right now. Fortunately, it was made to be gripping as well as funny, so it can potentially appeal to more audiences than one.If there's one thing about this movie that didn't quite work, it was a subplot featuring Dale's eighteen-year-old girlfriend, Angie (Amber Heard). She drifts in and out of the story, pretty much to the point of seeming unnecessary. In a scene that sounds better than it actually is, a beaten, bruised, disheveled Dale arrives at Angie's house and meets her parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Nora Dunn). He then gets all three of them involved in the drug war, forcing them to hide out in some out-of-the-way motel. This was never adequately resolved. Then again, the entire relationship was never adequately introduced. Basically, Angie felt more like an afterthought. She certainly took time away from the main story, which wasn't entertaining so much as it was absorbing. You, of course, might think that ""entertaining"" is the right word to describe ""Pineapple Express."" It's completely understandable if you do. Seeing it more than once, however, might be pushing it. There are certain things I can only take one hit of.",4,Reefer Madness,1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,5499,"['Pineapple', 'Express', 'supposedly', 'named', 'special', 'species', 'marijuana', 'so',

1146601,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0014E29UA,DanD,"[0, 3]","There's a lot of talent going into ""Pineapple Express:"" Seth Rogen, who's genuine talent for comedic timing makes him a standout in any film he does, no matter how small or large the role; James Franco, who displays great comedic chops here (we can forgive him his atrocious performance in the ""Spider-man"" series); Danny McBride, who's been spicing up big-budget comedies for the past couple months (think ""Tropic Thunder""); Gary Cole, who manages to convey both sinister intentions and slapstick humor at the same time; and of course Judd Apatow, the man responsible for the funniest comedy of the past decade (""Anchorman"") as well as two of the smartest (""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"").Thus, it's a bit surprising that ""Express"" doesn't completely excel.  The story revolves around drug dealer Saul (Franco), a down-and-outer with no aspirations whatsoever; and his client Dale, a process server who's dating a high school student and has equally low expectations of life.  When Dale witnesses drug kingpin Ted Jones (Cole) and his female cop partner/lover kill a man, he and Saul go on the run, getting into various comedic hijinks along the way.Rogen, Cole, and especially Franco are all stand-outs; and the writing is sharp, and the directing is solid.  So why, then, does the film lag?  Perhaps because somewhere along the way the filmmakers sacrificed humor for action, or vice versa; the film can't seem to decide if it wants to be a physical comedy or a more thoughtful one.  Also, a movie that revolves around pot has inherent problems.  Not to say anything against pot comedies (of which ""Pineapple Express"" is one of the best); merely to say, when the film revolves around pot, then it has to bring something else to the table to compensate, to remind us that we are watching a movie, and not a bunch of people smoking dope. There's even an attempt in the movie to suggest a moral stance on dope.  The film is certainly not solid enough to go that far.

1146605,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0014E29UA,Dave. K,"[3, 6]","The main reason I wanted to see Pineapple Express was due to my love for the TV series Freaks and Geeks, which left me heartbroken when it got cancelled; seeing as Judd Apatow was one of the producers and it starred James Franco and Seth Rogen all three of course involved with Freaks and Geeks I had to see this. Quite honestly I didn't really expect too much out of Pineapple Express; I was hoping for something entertaining and it actually turned out even better than I thought it would and easily rates as one of my favorite comedies of the past few years and not for nothing the action in this movie was pretty sweet as well.Despite what people say you don't need to be a stoner to enjoy this movie, while in my younger years I was known to light up I haven't done it in years now and I still loved this movie. Pineapple Express is very over the top, but every second of it works well. Due to the over the top nature of the movie it might turn some viewers off, which sometimes it turns me off as well. I guess it's all about the way it's handled and here in Pineapple Express these crazy over the top moments work well.The screenplay by Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg was excellent; it was constantly funny and the characters were great; all the characters really add to the movie no matter how little time some have. The main characters are fleshed out well, but some of the others aren't as well developed, but they all still work nonetheless. The screenplay was far better than I ever thought it would be.Director David Gordon Green shows some great promise with Pineapple Express; the movie is funny from the start and never lets up. Every scene in some ways adds to the movie and the pacing is amazing. There's never a slow moment to be found and like I said the movie is funny through out. Again Pineapple Express is a bit over the top with not only the action, but the comedy as well, but despite that every comedic part is just as funny as the last. David Gordon Green also shows great promise as an action director. While Pineapple Express has action through out it's the final act, which is all out action and David Gordon Green makes one of the better American action movies in quite some time. I really look forward to seeing what he does in the future.Both Seth Rogen & James Franco really work so well together. These guys are hysterical! James Franco though for me was the standout. Every scene with this guy was pure gold. Franco is quite a talented actor and while he's built a name for himself I think the future will only get better for him. Seth Rogen plays his typical type character and he's great here. It's good to see these two guys going onto bigger things since the end of Freaks and Geeks. Danny McBride nearly steals the show as Red and Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robison are hysterical as two hit men.Pineapple Express really was an excellent movie that turned out far better than I thought it would and to my surprise works as a really awesome action flick as well. There are moments where I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. Again due to some over the top moments Pineapple Express may not be for everybody, but just sit back and enjoy the ride. This flick from the start until the end is always funny and highly entertaining. I can honestly say I didn't want this movie to end. This one comes highly recommended.The Blu-ray looks and sounds great and the features are excellent. If not mistaken the features are the same as the 2-disc DVD. But due to the action scenes I would advise you to get the Blu-ray",5,Far better than I thought it would be.

The funniest bits are the throwaway lines delivered by Rogen as Dale Denton, a carefree process server who smokes reefer all day, dreams of being a radio talk-show host, and has a relationship with a high school girl named Angie. The movie's title refers to the new and powerful weed strain that Dale buys from a sweet-natured, likeably loopy dealer named Saul Silver. Both are quickly on the lam after Dale witnesses a grisly murder at the hands of criminal drug lord Ted Jones and his corrupt cop lover Carol. They try to elicit help from Saul's shifty but hilariously obtuse friend Red, but he rats on them to a pair of hit-men who are in hot pursuit of the comic pair.I have to admit that the film starts rather unpromisingly as a stoner comedy with a somewhat unsavory element in the romance Dale has with his underaged girlfriend. However, it picks up considerable comedy steam when Dale and Saul become paranoid as much from their excessive smoking as their on-the-run situation. Director David Gordon Green, a filmmaker known more for his indie work likeGeorge Washington, also brings a refreshing human element to key moments within the escalating shenanigans, especially when the bond between Dale and Saul becomes hilariously intractable. It also becomes clear that Dale's relationship with Angie is based on his emotional immaturity versus a Lolita complex.As Dale, the schlubby Rogen is really doing nothing different here than he did inKnocked Up, though his baseline character's object of affection has shifted discernibly from a beautiful entertainment reporter to a dealer and his doobies. An actor etched in my memory for his startling turn as James Dean in the2002 telepic, a stringy-haired James Franco manages to be funny and intriguingly poignant in an off-kilter way. The scene stealers, however, turn out to be Danny McBride (the suspicious brother in last year'sThe Heartbreak Kid), who survives every action-thriller clich&eacute; imaginable, and Craig Robinson (the hilariously observant nightclub bouncer inKnocked Up) as the overly sensitive hit-man Matheson. Left far to the sidelines are Gary Cole not nearly interesting enough as Jones and a strangely cast Rosie Perez acting quite butch as Carol.Ed Begley, Jr., has a funny bit as Angie's beleaguered dad, and Ken Jeong (the obnoxious ob-gyn inKnocked Up) shows up as one of the ninjas from the Asian crime syndicate. Overlong at 110 minutes, the movie shifts gears into Quentin Tarantino territory during the last third - first with a predictably wild car chase scene and then the particularly over-the-top mayhem at the grow house where the Pineapple Express is harvested. As a silly overture, the opening black-and-white scene, set seventy years prior, has Bill Hader as a soldier smoking copious amounts of marijuana to test his mettle, but make no mistake that this is at heart a stoner buddy film, a point made clear by the film's hangover scene in the diner. There's a lot of funny stuff in this film, and much of it is well-played, but the audience is clearly pre-determined by the subject. If you are repelled by the thought of watching guys getting high for nearly two hours, then I say just skip it.",3,Loopy Stoner Comedy Hijinks and Quentin Tarantino-Level Action Make for a Guy-Friendly Free-for-All,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,3345,"['Co-written', 'star', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'partner', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'ramshackle', 'dialogue', 'familiar', 'comedies', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'factory', 'funniest', 'bits', 'are', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'delivered', 'Rogen', 'Dale', 'Denton', 'carefree', 'process', 'server', 'who', 'reefer', 'day', 'dreams', 'being', 'radio', 'talk-show', 'host', 'relationship', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'named', 'Angie', 'movie', 'title', 'refers', 'new', 'powerful', 'weed', 'strain', 'Dale', 'sweet-natured', 'likeably', 'loopy', 'dealer', 'named', 'Saul', 'Silver', 'are', 'quickly', 'lam', 'Dale', 'grisly', 'murder', 'hands', 'criminal', 'drug', 'lord', 'Ted', 'Jones', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'lover', 'Carol', 'try', 'elicit', 'help', 'Saul', 'shifty', 'hilariously', 'friend', 'Red', 'pair', 'hit-men', 'who', 'are', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'comic', 'pair.I', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'rather', 'unpromisingly', 'stoner', 'comedy', 'somewhat', 'unsavory', 'element', 'romance', 'Dale', 'underaged', 'girlfriend', 'However', 'up', 'considerable', 'comedy', 'steam', 'when', 'Dale', 'Saul', 'become', 'paranoid', 'much', 'excessive', 'smoking', 'on-the-run', 'situation', 'Director', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'filmmaker', 'known', 'more', 'indie', 'work', 'likeGeorge', 'Washington', 'also', 'refreshing', 'human', 'element', 'key', 'moments', 'escalating', 'shenanigans', 'especially', 'when', 'bond', 'Dale', 'Saul', 'hilariously', 'intractable', 'also', 'clear', 'Dale', 'relationship', 'Angie', 'based', 'emotional', 'immaturity', 'Lolita', 'complex.As', 'Dale', 'schlubby', 'Rogen', 'really', 'doing', 'nothing', 'different', 'here', 'did', 'inKnocked', 'Up', 'baseline', 'character', 'object', 'affection', 'shifted', 'discernibly', 'beautiful', 'entertainment', 'reporter', 'dealer', 'doobies', 'actor', 'etched', 'memory', 'startling', 'turn', 'James', 'Dean', 'the2002', 'telepic', 'stringy-haired', 'James', 'Franco', 'be', 'funny', 'intriguingly', 'poignant', 'off-kilter', 'way', 'scene', 'stealers', 'however', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'suspicious', 'brother', 'last', ""year'sThe"", 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', 'who', 'action-thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 'imaginable', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'hilariously', 'observant', 'nightclub', 'bouncer', 'inKnocked', 'Up', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'hit-man', 'Matheson', 'Left', 'far', 'sidelines', 'are', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'not', 'nearly', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Jones', 'strangely', 'cast', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'acting', 'quite', 'butch', 'Carol.Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'funny', 'bit', 'Angie', 'beleaguered', 'dad', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'obnoxious', 'ob-gyn', 'inKnocked', 'Up', 'up', 'one', 'ninjas', 'Asian', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Overlong', '110', 'minutes', 'movie', 'shifts', 'gears', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'territory', 'last', 'third', 'first', 'predictably', 'wild', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'then', 'particularly', 'over-the-top', 'mayhem', 'grow', 'house', 'where', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'harvested', 'silly', 'overture', 'opening', 'black-and-white', 'scene', 'set', 'seventy', 'years', 'prior', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'soldier', 'smoking', 'copious', 'amounts', 'marijuana', 'test', 'mettle', 'make', 'mistake', 'heart', 'stoner', 'buddy', 'film', 'point', 'made', 'clear', 'film', 'hangover', 'scene', 'diner', 'lot', 'funny', 'stuff', 'film', 'much', 'well-played', 'audience', 'clearly', 'pre-determined', 'subject', 'are', 'repelled', 'thought', 'watching', 'guys', 'getting', 'high', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'then', 'say', 'just', 'skip']",N/A

In this Rogen plays Dale Denton, a mid 20-something subpoena server who likes smoking pot. That's pretty much him, that and he aimlessly goes through life as high as possible and has a girlfriend who's a senior in High School. During a routine pot pick-up we meet his dealer Saul (played well-enough by Spider-Man's James Franco, doing his best Jeff Spicoli just in time to star opposite Sean Penn in Milk in his next film, go figure). When he tells Saul that he has to deliver a summons to a Ted Jones, it reminds Saul of one of his chain of suppliers, who is one nasty mean killer of a drug lord. But Dale's stoned, so he's off to do his job and go to Ted's anyway. However, after a ""wrong place at the wrong time"" moment of witnessing Ted and his female police companion (Rosie Perez, who've honestly I've missed a bit) kill a member of the competition, Dale races back to Saul, gets him involved in the chase, and the two are off to protect their lives on the run against a bunch of baddies that just want them dead, all the while they're dead stoned.While films like Superbad and The 40 Year Old Virgin provided lots of laughs, it's surprising that this film really doesn't have that many ""bust a gut"" moments. Honestly, at times I thought to myself ""Man, if I only was ten years younger and completely stoned out of my mind right now this would be classic""....but sorry, I'm not either. Not to say it doesn't keep you interested with it's After Hours/Midnight Run meets Cheech & Chong sorta vibe, but at times the homage to cool car/foot chases and blasting gunfire of the past seem kind of forced and fakey here. Plus, I'm all for male-bonding in motion pictures today, but with such extremely high levels of uncomfortable bromance here I think they should have turned it down a notch or get it over with and get a room. Still, the movie is entertaining, but I found recent similar comedies like ""Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" achieve better success with the same format.Your money with the single-disc edition won't let it go up in smoke either. A 25 minute documentary sheds light on the history of the project, even dating past Freaks And Geeks, a gag-reel that at times is funnier than the movie itself, some deleted/extended scenes and an entertaining commentary too. Overall, this is a good rental for any fan of stoner-comedy, but unlike Apatow's other related successes, this one might not reach levels of Superbad as the short-term memory fades.(RedSabbath Rating:7.5/10)",3,"Though Not Completely Up In Smoke, They Just Don't Make Stoner-Comedy Like They Used To.",1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,2603,"['Yet', 'Seth', 'Rogen/Judd', 'Apatow', 'project', 'slightly', 'different', 'take', 'usual', 'films', 'Rogen', 'Dale', 'Denton', 'mid', '20-something', 'subpoena', 'server', 'who', 'smoking', 'pot', 'pretty', 'much', 'aimlessly', 'through', 'life', 'as', 'high', 'possible', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'senior', 'High', 'School', 'routine', 'pot', 'pick-up', 'meet', 'dealer', 'Saul', 'played', 'well-enough', 'Spider-Man', 'James', 'Franco', 'doing', 'best', 'Jeff', 'Spicoli', 'just', 'time', 'star', 'opposite', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Milk', 'next', 'film', 'go', 'figure', 'When', 'Saul', 'deliver', 'summons', 'Ted', 'Jones', 'Saul', 'one', 'chain', 'suppliers', 'who', 'one', 'nasty', 'mean', 'killer', 'drug', 'lord', 'Dale', 'stoned', 'do', 'job', 'go', 'Ted', 'anyway', 'However', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'moment', 'witnessing', 'Ted', 'female', 'police', 'companion', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'who', ""'ve"", 'honestly', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'bit', 'kill', 'member', 'competition', 'Dale', 'back', 'Saul', 'involved', 'chase', 'two', 'are', 'protect', 'lives', 'run', 'bunch', 'baddies', 'just', 'want', 'dead', 'while', ""'re"", 'dead', 'stoned.While', 'films', 'Superbad', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'provided', 'lots', 'laughs', 'surprising', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'bust', 'gut', 'moments', 'Honestly', 'times', 'thought', 'myself', 'Man', 'only', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'younger', 'completely', 'stoned', 'mind', 'right', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'classic', '.but', 'sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'either', 'Not', 'say', ""n't"", 'keep', 'interested', 'Hours/Midnight', 'Run', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'sorta', 'vibe', 'times', 'homage', 'cool', 'car/foot', 'chases', 'blasting', 'gunfire', 'past', 'seem', 'kind', 'forced', 'fakey', 'here', ""'m"", 'male-bonding', 'motion', 'pictures', 'today', 'such', 'extremely', 'high', 'levels', 'uncomfortable', 'bromance', 'here', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'turned', 'down', 'notch', 'get', 'get', 'room', 'Still', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'found', 'recent', 'similar', 'comedies', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Escape', 'From', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'achieve', 'better', 'success', 'same', 'format.Your', 'money', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'up', 'smoke', 'either', '25', 'minute', 'documentary', 'sheds', 'light', 'history', 'project', 'even', 'dating', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'gag-reel', 'times', 'funnier', 'movie', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'too', 'Overall', 'good', 'rental', 'fan', 'stoner-comedy', 'Apatow', 'other', 'related', 'successes', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'reach', 'levels', 'Superbad', 'short-term', 'memory', 'fades', 'RedSabbath', 'Rating:7.5/10']",N/A

The two stoners then do the one thing that any normal pothead would do...run, as quickly as they can because Jones and his thugs are hot on their heels.From the guys that brought you ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Superbad"" among others, comes the stoner buddy comedy ""Pineapple Express."" We all know there have been stoner movies before; ""Half Baked,"" ""Harold and Kumar"" and more notably ""Cheech and Chong,"" but ""Pineapple Express"" like the drug in the film, is unique. There was a fine balance between action and comedy, and there are moments where they are intertwined. It also seems as though for every serious hardcore action scene, the viewer is hit with a comedic twist. For example, when Saul manages to steal a police cruiser and a chase ensues, he tries to kick out the windshield which yields to be ineffective because he gets his foot lodged in there.Heck, there are even scenes with gratuitous violence that are made out to be funny. In other words, ""Pineapple Express"" never lets itself be taken too seriously, but what do you except from a movie with marijuana revolving around the plot and two stoners as main characters?

This stoner comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco and Danny McBride made me laugh all the way through!

The fight at Red's house is especially hysterical!What I'm most impressed about this film is James Franco's performance. I really disliked him in the Spider-Man movies. He reminded me of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars prequels. But here, he made me change my mind about his acting. He's believable as Saul, who's complex relationship with Dale Denton (Rogen) becomes a central point in the story.Pineapple Express may not be Monty Python or National Lampoon, but it's just as funny as Half-Baked, which is also a hilarious stoner comedy.

Seth Rogen, who cowrote both films with Evan Goldberg, plays Dale, a burned out process server who accidentally witnesses a drug kingpin committing murder, and leaves a roach at the scene of the crime which allows said kingpin to track Dale down via his dealer, Saul, played by James Franco. Dale and Saul go on the run. This pretty much sums up the ""plot"" aspect of the movie.But this is not a bad thing. While the movie does build towards a more than fairly suspenseful climax, the focus is never truly on what is happening but rather how it is happening. It is packed full of physical comedy, over the top emotional revelations, and plenty of pot smoke. While the Apatow obligatory sex jokes are still around, they don't dominate the script this time around, pushed aside by marijuana and even more so the other Apatow mainstay: male camaraderie.With the term ""Bromance"" becoming more and more popular, movies like Pineapple Express seem to have no better description than ""Bromantic Comedy,"" a movie in which any romantic subplot is inconsequential compared to the importance of the relationship between the heterosexual male leads. It takes the buddy movie concept to a whole new level.It is because the Bromantic chemistry between Rogen and Franco works that the movie itself works. Express has a built in audience of stoners due to its marquee nature as a ""pot movie,"" but it was still enjoyable to this non pot head because of clever dialogue, physical gags that don't rely on the simple gross out factor, a phenomenal supporting cast (including a fantastic cameo from Ed Begley Jr. ) and just a general air of having a good time, as smoke filled as that air is.",4,Action-Bromantic Comedy.

Seth Rogen stars as a stoned-out process server named Dale, whom gets a hold of some rare ""herbal remedy"" from his buddy Sol (James Franco, who steals the show IMHO).  Later on he goes to serve a guy named Ted Jones (Gary Cole), when he finds out that Ted, really a drug dealer, is in cahoots with a crooked cop.  Dale sees Ted and the cop kill somebody and then takes off in a panic.  The rest of the movie details Dale and Sol's journey as they try to escape the clutches of Ted Jones' assassins.As a skilled action-comedy, this film works in many ways.  First off to have the star power of Seth Rogen and James Franco is just great.  Combined, their comedic chemistry is unmatched.  James Franco definitely steals the show here because he acts completely different from his usual array, much like Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder or even Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.However, a few things did seem out of place.

It's certainly not the best comedy has to offer but it's full of fun mindless laughs. For those who are complaining about the drug content, what is it that you were expecting after reading the synopsis. Obviously it's based around weed but it as a very entertaining story. It's not great but is certainly one of the better comedies I've seen recently.The film is centered around Dale Denton (Rogen) and Saul Silver (Franco) who have a very interesting relationship built off of weed. Dale is a court process clerk who befriends his drug dealer Saul upon smoking a rare type of pot known as pineapple express. Dale is on his way to serve the city's most dangerous drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole) when he witnesses him murder someone. Dale freaks out and draws attention to his departure forcing home and Saul to leave town. Along the way they get involved in so many hilarious situations while being hunted by Jone's thugs. The film probably could have been wrapped up quicker then it was but no complaints overall.Going into it I wasn't expecting too too much due to all the hype. Fortunately the film was very satisfying in comedic value. Seth Rogen does his usual great job but James Franco takes the cake here. He plays the ultimate stoner that everyone has known at some point in their lives. It was stacked with a really solid cast in addition to Rogen & Franco. I definitely recommend Pineapple Express to those looking for a night of brainless stoner humor.",4,It's almost a shame to smoke it.

It never losses sight of what it is: a crude humor film, but it is done in a high standard; I got the warm feeling of respect for film that the likes of Noah Baumbach, or Jason Reitman have for Comedies. It abuses the almost routine of unconscious Homosexuality-bit; but it never crosses the red-line that leaves you more angry than embarrassed. The tagline is a comedy about growing up, which is climaxically pronounced in an angry outburst that is for film lovers: an enticing scene of humility portrayed by not only a character learning to grow before our eyes, but the actor in front of our eyes: Seth Rogen. Mixed into your theatre crowds, are going to be slowly more and more a more potent element of serious movie go-ers, the indie crowd that was once associated with Clerks.There is heavy drug usuage, and it can be funny at times. It presents to us the history of weed in America, and the governments plans with the recreational drug. The acting must be easy to do, as its about stoners who act like idiots, so how can you have much appreciation. But Seth Rogen does have a presence on film that needs credit. I don't think this is a film that can be done without the stars like Franco and Rogen taged to it.The ending is funny, and can have some excitement to share. It never takes itself seriously, and whatever reality there may have been leading to the climax, is certainly brought down again by the buddiness and who-cares approach for the ending.

So I added ""Pineapple Express"" to the queue of my online rental service (the one everyone and his brother subscribes to).  Anyway, the movie came the other day and I watched it.  It was fine, but I kept saying to myself, ""Funny stuff, but what's with all these explosions and big action scenes?  It's like they want this to be some kind of ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" movie or something.""  Anyway, when I watched the special features, I learned that that was exactly what producer Judd Apatow and his cohorts were going for: a big, Jerry Bruckheimer-style action movie, only with clueless stoner guys as the heroes instead of strong confident types like Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise.  Fair enough.  Not a horrible concept.  But me?  I found the huge action scenes, sadistic villains, etc. a little distracting and the movie kind of bloated.  Essentially I wanted less of the huge, ambitious set pieces and more stoner comedy.  But, again, that's just me.

But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop and the city's most dangerous drug lord, he panics and dumps his roach of Pineapple Express at the scene. Dale now has another reason to visit Saul: to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him. And it is. As Dale and Saul run for their lives, they quickly discover that they're not suffering from weed-fueled paranoia; incredibly, the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both.

I last saw Brogan in the miraculous Knocked UpKnocked Up (Unrated Full Screen Edition), one of the funnier films I've seen in recent years. This one is funny, too, but it is also wearisome and dull when visceral comedy isn't creating laughs.Brogan and his pot-dealing buddy (James Franco) have to outwit (perhaps a poor choice of words) a couple contract killers in this movie after the former witnesses the murder. This takes them from the comfort of their bong-driven life to life in transit, even though they never get far from home.The humor in this movie is all slapstick. In one memorable scene, the two heroes visit a ""friend"" who intentionally attacks them in his home and a three-way fight breaks out. The homebody hides in the bathroom and Brogran and bud break down the door, knocking the other guy into the sink which is dislodged from the wall. It's a lot funnier watching and hearing the action than what I can describe, and there are a half-dozen scenes almost as good throughout the movie. Take these scenes away, though, and you have a really stupid and dull late adolescent movie.Good comedies are hard to come by and, while I wouldn't call this a good one, it is laugh out loud funny at least a half-dozen times, often for 3-4 minutes at a time, and the action keeps moving so you're not bored with a flat story. ""Pineapple Express"" isn't the last word in anything but, when it's all said and done, people are going to remember it as another funny movie from Brogan.",3,Half laughs and half boredom,1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,1817,"['Pineapple', 'Express', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'brand', 'marijuana', 'sold', 'movie', 'signature', 'element', 'off', 'war', 'two', 'drug', 'cartels', 'actor', 'Seth', 'Brogan', 'stumbles', 'way', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'when', 'high', 'Pineapple', 'Express.If', 'made', 'chuckle', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'last', 'saw', 'Brogan', 'miraculous', 'Knocked', 'UpKnocked', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'one', 'funnier', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'one', 'funny', 'too', 'also', 'wearisome', 'dull', 'when', 'visceral', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'creating', 'laughs.Brogan', 'pot-dealing', 'buddy', 'James', 'Franco', 'have', 'outwit', 'perhaps', 'poor', 'choice', 'words', 'couple', 'contract', 'killers', 'movie', 'former', 'murder', 'comfort', 'bong-driven', 'life', 'life', 'transit', 'even', 'never', 'get', 'far', 'home.The', 'humor', 'movie', 'slapstick', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'two', 'heroes', 'visit', 'friend', 'who', 'intentionally', 'home', 'three-way', 'fight', 'breaks', 'out', 'homebody', 'bathroom', 'Brogran', 'bud', 'break', 'down', 'door', 'knocking', 'other', 'guy', 'sink', 'dislodged', 'wall', 'lot', 'funnier', 'watching', 'hearing', 'action', 'what', 'can', 'describe', 'are', 'half-dozen', 'scenes', 'almost', 'good', 'movie', 'Take', 'scenes', 'away', 'have', 'really', 'stupid', 'dull', 'late', 'adolescent', 'movie.Good', 'comedies', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'good', 'one', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'least', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'often', '3-4', 'minutes', 'time', 'action', 'moving', 'so', ""'re"", 'not', 'bored', 'flat', 'story', 'Pineapple', 'Express', ""n't"", 'last', 'word', 'anything', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'remember', 'funny', 'movie', 'Brogan']",N/A
1146660,A3SSWZCKFB38VI,B0014E29UA,LazerBlader,"[1, 1]","Best Stoner Movie? Heck, yeah.Best Apatow film? Not quite.But solid action comedy? Indeed.The brilliant men behind ""Knocked Up"" & ""Superbad"", Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, team up once again to do the stoner comedy justice. But also to try their hand at not only comedy but action as well.And how does it turn out? Solid. The action isn't anything special but the cast & comedy make it stand apart. Because it is also an action film & not all comedy, made Pineapple Express not the hilarious roller coaster that last August's Superbad was but still an enjoyable ride.It's great to see James Franco recovering from the unfortunate mess that was last summer's Spider-Man 3. He plays the quirky, good-hearted weed dealer Saul Silver and boy was it a pleasure to see him perform in that roll. Apatow-regular Seth Rogen is just funny & charismatic as always. Also, great to see Bill Hader, who played the other cop in Superbad, making an appearance with his cameo during the beginning of the film.Unlike other stoner comedies such as that sequel to the Korean & Indian dudes who escape from some place, I'm glad Pineapple Express had an actual coherent plot viewers can enjoy. Sure it got a little over-the-top for my tastes but since it was done skillfully, I can't complain that I didn't enjoy it.When you peel away the marijuana and the gun fire, what you're left with on the Pineapple Express is a wild story about friendship.So despite not finding it as funny as other Apatow productions, I'll scrap scoring a 3.5 & give it the benefit of the doubt with a 4.Rated R comedies have found their savior in Judd Apatow. I'm just afraid he'll burn himself out by releasing so many movies a year. We've already had a few duds like Dewey Cox & Zohan that I hope he can avoid in the future. As for now, keep up the great work Apatow, Rogen, Goldberg & I can't wait to see you guys next summer.",4,"Fly like paper, get high like planes!",1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,1897,"['Best', 'Stoner', 'Movie', 'Heck', 'yeah.Best', 'Apatow', 'film', 'Not', 'quite.But', 'solid', 'action', 'comedy', 'Indeed.The', 'brilliant', 'men', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'team', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'do', 'stoner', 'comedy', 'justice', 'also', 'try', 'hand', 'not', 'only', 'comedy', 'action', 'well.And', 'how', 'turn', 'out', 'Solid', 'action', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'cast', 'comedy', 'make', 'stand', 'apart', 'also', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'comedy', 'made', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'not', 'hilarious', 'roller', 'coaster', 'last', 'August', 'Superbad', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'ride.It', 'great', 'see', 'James', 'Franco', 'recovering', 'unfortunate', 'mess', 'was', 'last', 'summer', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'quirky', 'good-hearted', 'weed', 'dealer', 'Saul', 'Silver', 'boy', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'perform', 'roll', 'Apatow-regular', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'just', 'funny', 'charismatic', 'always', 'Also', 'great', 'see', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'who', 'played', 'other', 'cop', 'Superbad', 'making', 'appearance', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'film.Unlike', 'other', 'stoner', 'comedies', 'such', 'sequel', 'Korean', 'Indian', 'dudes', 'who', 'escape', 'place', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'had', 'actual', 'coherent', 'plot', 'viewers', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Sure', 'got', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'tastes', 'was', 'done', 'skillfully', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.When', 'peel', 'away', 'marijuana', 'gun', 'fire', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'wild', 'story', 'friendship.So', 'not', 'finding', 'as', 'funny', 'other', 'Apatow', 'productions', ""'ll"", 'scrap', 'scoring', '3.5', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', '4.Rated', 'R', 'comedies', 'have', 'found', 'savior', 'Judd', 'Apatow', ""'m"", 'just', 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'burn', 'out', 'releasing', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'year', ""'ve"", 'already', 'had', 'few', 'duds', 'Dewey', 'Cox', 'Zohan', 'hope', 'can', 'avoid', 'future', 'now', 'keep', 'great', 'work', 'Apatow', 'Rogen', 'Goldberg', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'guys', 'next', 'summer']",N/A

I will though encourage people to watch the laugh filled film, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS.The title refers to a particular type of marijuana sold by James Franco. But that's later. Seth Rogen stars as Dale Denton, a process server whose job makes him unpopular. This 25 year old professional is dating an 18 year old and spending his days serving papers and getting stoned between people.Stopping to see his dealer Saul Silver (James Franco), the pair seems to be friends but not quite. Saul turns Dale on to a special weed known as Pineapple Express and just after finds out whom Dale's next person to be served is. It could be a coincidence but it seems to be Saul's supplier, the man behind Pineapple Express.Dale heads out to serve papers but lights one up outside of Ted Jones' (Gary Cole) house. When a police car pulls up behind him, Dale ducks down only to see the policewoman (Rosie Perez) entering the house. Hearing a gunshot, he looks up to see a man killed and then panics. Enough to back into the police car alerting the killers they've been seen.Dale heads back to Saul's and the duo escape with minutes to spare after Ted's men track them down. It seems that roach that Dale tossed out the window was identified by Ted and only one man in town has that brand for sale at present.The movie turns into a buddies on the run flick for the middle act as Saul and Dale attempt to avoid any bloodshed, mainly their own. Along the way they philosophize, get stoned and ruminate on things as they become better acquainted. And some of the things they do and say make for some decent laughs.Fearing that the bad guys might go after those who mean something to them, the pair attempts to head them off, first going to Dale's girlfriend's parent's house. Trying to convince them to leave, the confrontation turns a here is my boyfriend meeting into a shotgun get out of my house moment.Before they can get to Saul's grandmother, the pair has a falling out. When the bad guys do show, they capture Saul and take him to the gang's hideout. Realizing he made a mistake, Dale sets out to rescue his friend in one of the funniest rescues ever attempted.Okay, so the description of this film sounds more like a drama then a comedy right? Well if it were played straight it might turn out that way. But instead of doing so, the team here twisted this genre piece into some funny stuff.Franco's character is the spaced out weird one, sort of like Tommy Chong from the old days but with a little more comprehension of what's going on around him. Rogen is funny as the uptight one of the pair, happy go lucky at first and now worried about everything and everyone.The humor of this film covers all bases. There is the obvious drug laced humor that reminds you of the old Cheech and Chong films. There is the different world's aspect between Dale and Saul that doesn't stand in the way of their becoming friends. There is the man in peril situation, much like an old Hitchcock film played not for drama but laughs.When the preview for this one showed prior to its opening I was concerned that they put the best pieces into it. Yes, those are some of the best seen here. No, they are not the only ones.  At moments the movie scours the world of crude humor but for adults it is hilarious. Not one to recommend to the kids though.This movie makes for a good rental but I think it's one I'll have to add to my collection. I enjoyed it that much. The extras are limited but the gag reel is great. As a matter of fact, one of the first things on it makes this one worth owning.If you need a good laugh, then light up PINEAPPLE EXPRESS.

James Franco plays his supplier Saul who also has a huge man-crush on Dale.  Dale witnesses a murder by Ted Jones (Gary Cole, who's infamous for his portrayal of Bill Lumburgh in OfficeSpace) and throws his joint out while fleeing.  Jones happens to be the area's drug lord and upon tasting his product from the leftover joint, knows he sold that strain to Saul.  What happens next are the supposed hilarity of male bonding and the action they end up getting involved in as a result of crossing a drug lord.)Like the title of my review suggests, the film was very inconsistent.  The comedy parts were worth at least a chuckle and the action parts were pretty spectacular, but the overall story/feel just didn't mesh as well as I would have liked to have seen.

1146675,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B0014E29UA,"MK ""Hussar""","[3, 5]","That famous platitude of absolute power corrupting absolutely is near-universally known, if not necessarily agreed upon--perhaps with ""Pineapple Express,"" director David Gordon Green (""Snow Angels"") has revealed to us comedy's analogue to the same axiom.  Is it possible that achieving stratospheric heights of mirth in past productions has temporarily sullied writer Seth Rogen's (writer, ""Superbad"") smile-making skills?  On the other hand, could one argue that with any ""stoner"" movie, one needs first to have the required ingredient in play?  If concentration holds, maybe this review will contain a relevant answer to that question before long.Dale Denton (Seth Rogen, ""Knocked Up"") is a process server who enlivens his lackluster daily routine by smoking weed, haunting various talk-radio shows, avoiding his high-school sweetheart's parents, and, shall we say, mixing up his on-the-job uniform.  The various problems with the above are, respectively:  he fears becoming his dealer Saul's friend (James Franco, ""Spiderman II""), his real aspiration is to be a talk-radio host, he is not a high-school student, and his guise-changing cements his enemies' suspicions later in the movie that he is, absolutely, a hired killer.  In other words, it's a stoner movie.  After a multiple-outcome encounter with his girlfriend in her high school, Dale wanders off to Saul's apartment to recharge his stores of wacky.  Saul, attempting to forestall Dale's quick exit after his purchase, entices his friend to smoke a triple-tipped ""trifecta"" deliverer-of-memory-loss after his purchase of the Holy Grail of the week:  Pineapple Express, a synthesis of various blends so profound as to make Dale wish he could live in the bag.Finally free, Dale goes to serve his last summons to a Ted Jones, (Gary Cole, ""Office Space"") but pauses first to smoke a bit of chronic.  This action both saves his life and dooms his ear, as the viewer will discover later on.  A police car screeches to a stop behind his vehicle, and a harried-looking policewoman (Rosie Perez, ""White Men Can't Jump"") rushes into Jones' house.  Temporarily amused that Jones was served by higher-ups before he had his chance, Dale is then horrified to witness a man in a bathrobe executing another man--all while the policewoman looks on.  He ditches his smoke and makes his escape, alerting the two murderers upstairs that there was a witness to the killing.  In a panic, he returns to Saul's apartment, and is even more appalled to realize that, according to Saul, the abandoned bit of Pineapple Express will lead Ted to middleman Red.  Red sold this brand only to Saul as a sneak-peek; therefore, once Ted browbeats Red into revealing who he sold the product to, the crosshairs will shift to rest directly upon Dale and Saul's stoned heads.  The pair, taking only the essentials--wacky, fruit roll-ups, and $78--in their haste, decide discretion in the better part of valor and flee the premises.If you've seen ""Superbad"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" you will find the type and pace of dialogue in this movie familiar--that of frequent asides, non sequiturs, and mumbled retorts that can reward the audience member who pays careful attention.  Frequently, it seems as if the actors may actually be ad-libbing their lines, so random are the thoughts which course from their mouths.  When done appropriately, such a technique can add layers to the comedy which ultimately results in viewer enjoyment, whether or not the plot is good.  Sadly, Seth Rogen's comedic timing is so off-pace, his expressions of surprise so frequent and so over-acted, and his sheer unbelievability so noticeable that he almost single-handedly destroys this movie.  His expertise is more in the area of dry and sarcastic humor and low-key roles, in general.  It was like having to listen to that loud, semi-funny guy at a party who thinks that enhancing his vocal volume is the solution to rectifying his audience's boredom and frequent glances askance.  Rogen was too manic, too forced, and did nothing to suspend my disbelief.  Franco, on the other hand, was fantastic, displaying every characteristic one expects from a total waste of protoplasm.  In addition, he displayed nuances of character besides stoned vacuity:  a childlike wish for Dale to be his friend, an overtone of benevolence which suffused his character, and an unseemly display of nobility for a character supposed to be no more than a low-life drug dealer.  Now, I'm not sure what chops it takes to act like someone three joints to the wind, or if Franco deserved a Golden Globes nomination for this role, but his performance was definitely the best this movie had to offer.The plot was sufficiently random and, in this way, comparable to other films of this genre, but was diminished in that it varied from serious to silly far too often.  A stoner movie needs its weight of material on the side of ridiculous to succeed, with only a few bits of sentiment strewn about.  Too many solemn bits, and the movie will morph into a comedy-drama, which mixes very poorly with the ludicrous plotlines fans of--for example--""Dude, Where's My Car,"" and ""Half-baked"" will probably be expecting.  There is also a fair amount of physical comedy, which is good, and an excess of violence, which is weird.  Ted and Carol executing some guy with copious blood-spatter made me think I was watching ""The Shield"" for a moment, not a good feeling for a viewer of a presumed romp through the typical insanity inherent in stoner movies to have.  In fairness, there were a smattering of truly funny moments which took the viewer by surprise--the shock present only because one had become deadened by all the prior unfunny attempts at comedy.  In the end, Rogen's acting, too much gravity, a mediocre plot, and lackluster performances from all supporting cast members--save Franco--killed this movie.  Franco and a few rare laughs are the only things keeping the movie above a one-star rating.DISCLAIMERThis review covers the unrated version of the DVD--I did not see the theatrical version, nor, I should think, will I ever.

I'm not a big fan of the ""lets see how many people I can offend before I appeal to their tender sensibilities"" vibe that drives most of Judd Apatow's productions.  Still, I am a big fan of the director, David Gordon Green, whoseGeorge WashingtonandAll the Real Girlsare among the very best American independent films of the last decade.  I was, on the whole, quite satisfied.  Until it got over the top and allowed the artificially hokey and intense plot to drive the climax, instead of allowing character to drive the drama, I was hooked and grinning.  Yeah, I wouldn't hang out with these guys.  But they were a lot of fun to watch, and I found it hilariously plausible that the first half of the film would leave them in denial about the seriousness of the situation they'd fallen into.The mood and pacing of the first half was perfect.  I loved the opening scene, that established a connection between this slacker comedy and the classic film noir, and made it quickly clear that the drug driving the drama of this film has effects that are incongruous with the desperate intensity that ordinarily dominates the crime film.  It's hard to emote paranoid desperation when you're ""chilling"" and ""mellow.""  The bromantic tension between Seth Rogen and James Franco is perfect - though it struck me that Franco is a far superior actor.  Nearly every other role is perfectly cast, though the Korean druglords were nothing more than stereotypes and Rosie Perez has seen much better days.All in all, this was a fun watch for the right mood - though the final showdown was just silly and was already done much better inHot Fuzz.

Soon enough, Dale and his dealer Saul Silver (the teriffic James Franco) are on the run, and all sorts of hilarity naturally ensue.  Though it comes close to wearing out its welcome, Pineapple Express is for the most part a continuously funny (and surprisingly violent) film that demonstrates the best of what Rogen has to offer as both a writer and an actor.  Franco however steals the show and manages to coax the biggest laughs, as does Danny McBride who shines as Saul's pal Red, who keeps taking a licking, and somehow manages to keep ticking.

It lacks the emotional depth that Apatow's associates have been able to mix with their brand of dirty comedy, but it still has heart.  It also has a different kind of humor. It's not the witty dialogue that takes center stage, but rather it's a tiny blend of that and a huge dose of finedly crafted physical comedy.The way the movie plays calls for physical comedy, as Seth Rogen and James Franco are high on pot through the duration of the film.  In the hands of anyone else, this movie will fail.  But Rogen and Franco play their parts very well.  That's where the humor plays out.  Whether it's a paranoid Rogen explaining a sticky situation to his girlfriends parents or a pot impaired Franco in a car chase, the humor is almost entirely physical.That's not to say this film doesn't have its own narrative wit.  The chracters are funny and as one review pointed out, almost plausible.  Rogen is entierly likeable (as he always is), as a man who serves out subpoenas and Franco is his drug dealer who is forced into an alliance with Rogen's character.  And wihle Rogen is always great and dependable in his comedic roles, it's Franco who shines, delivering laughs in nearly every scene he's in.The film has heart, too.

The same thing has been done already (with much more hilarous results) by Cheech and Chong. There is no ""real"" comedy to speak of; I mean, NOTHING in this movie even so much as made me chuckle or even smile. Was it supposed to be a drama?I know Seth Rogen is known for a great deal of improvisation in his films, but I just got the feeling that his entire performance was unscripted and whatever he happened to do or say in front of the camera ended up on film regardless of it's effectiveness or quality of humor.Give me ""Things Are Tough All Over"" or ""Nice Dreams"" any day over this trash.Sorry, Seth.

1146699,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0014E29UA,RMurray847,"[32, 37]","A movie like PINEAPPLE EXPRESS should not be expected to be talked about in the same breath as CITIZEN KANE or GONE WITH THE WIND.  However, it has nonetheless ascended to near the top ranks in its own particularly little sub-genre:  the ""pot"" comedy.While Cheech & Chong's UP IN SMOKE will probably always lead the pack, simply for being the first (and for being very edgy...in it's day)...EXPRESS is the first film of its ilk to boast huge laughs, modest thrills, enjoyable lead characters and a narrative structure that doesn't fall apart the further it goes.  For example, the HAROLD AND KUMAR films can be greatly amusing, but their ""plot"" grows more and more flaccid and pointless as they move along.  The lead ""characters"" are hardly believable as people...they are comic devices.In PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, we have the story of  a process server (Seth Rogan) who enjoys doing little else but smoking pot.  He is decent at his job, but also spends much of it sitting in his car smoking.  He's dating a high school girl who would have been seriously out of his league when HE was in school.  His ""best friend"" may just be his pot dealer (James Franco.)  And through an unfortunate circumstance, Rogan witnesses the murder of an Asian drug dealer by the leader (Gary Cole) of the other drug ring in his city.  The murder is aided by a policewoman (Rosie Perez), who is also a pretty vicious killer.  They get wise to who their witness is when Rogan makes the mistake of tossing his half-smoked joint out the window of his car as he hurriedly drives away.  You see, the joint is made of a new weed called Pineapple Express, which thus far has been sold only to one drug middleman (Danny McBride), who has only sold it to one of his dealers...Franco.  Thus, almost immediately, Rogan and Franco are on the run for their lives.  Eventually they will have to beat these violent men at their own game just to survive.That's about it for the basics of the plot...but what is nice about it is the way it holds together from beginning to end.  The characters go through a journey and they change and grow a little.  While the dialogue and humor are important, this is one ""pot"" movie where the plot is actually important to the film, not just an excuse to make ""I'm so stoned"" jokes.Rogan is basically playing his character from KNOCKED UP again...but if you need that sort of character, he's got it down cold.  He's a nice loser who actually looks like a real life person.  Danny McBride joins this group of losers midway through, and he brings a nice jolt of almost absurdist humor the film.  He's like Rasputin mixed with the character Terry on RENO 911 (you know, the ""male prostitute"" on roller skates).  Gary Cole and Perez are a little too generic, and frankly, the bad guys in the film are not well-sketched out.  Their behavior is inconsistent and not always credible.James Franco steals the film, though.  He was born to play this role.  In movies as varied as SPIDERMAN and FLYBOYS...he often is unsuccessful at playing a button up, ""serious"" types.  He's better when allowed to let his slacker show through.  In FREAKS AND GEEKS, he was a stoner heartthrob, who discovered he had deep reserves of loyalty and love.  In PINEAPPLE, he's a stoner with very little to offer, but who has a simplicity and openness about him that makes him likeable.  Yes, it's the pot that has made him this way...but Franco refuses for settle for a simple caricature.  His stoned but winning eyes & smile are the heart of this film.The humor is certainly R-rated.  Lots of ""f"" bombs.  A fair amount of violence near the end too.  It's crass and loud at times.  Sometimes the jokes are obvious and unoriginal.  But mostly it is sustained by moments of real feeling (as we see so often in films with the name Apatow stamped on them), likeable characters and a plot that has a beginning, middle & end.Now, finally, let me comment on the ""drug"" elements.  I don't use drugs.  Even in my days of ""youthful indiscretion"" I was not a dabbler.  I would certainly be what anyone would call ""conservative"" on this particular issue.  So therefore, I might tend to take offense at such ""glorification"" of drugs.  But I'm not sure that the film does that.  True, it pretty much assumes that the entire world does drugs.  But it also shows, quite clearly and without preaching, that the use of these drugs, while inducing pleasurable feelings, also induces stupid decision making, slothfulness and wastefulness.  Clearly, it sides with those who would make pot legal...but it doesn't disdain those who oppose this.  It simply IS.  I can't imagine this film would make anyone change their behavior.  Those who use pot regularly already are likely to smile in recognition at much of the behavior.  Those who don't use it will NOT be inspired to give it a try.  So while I'm not thrilled at a film that is clouded 90% of the time with pot fumes...I can't get upset about it either.",4,Remarkably fun and well-crafted.,1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,4946,"['movie',

1146702,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0014E29UA,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","If last year's hits, ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad,"" were the movie-comedy equivalent of grand slam homeruns, then the latest concoction by producer Judd Apatow - this one entitled ""Pineapple Express"" after some killer weed - is at the very least a solid triple.  More contrived in its storyline than those two earlier films, but no less hilarious on that account, ""Pineapple Express"" is the tale of two certified potheads, Dale and Saul, who are forced to go on the lam after Dale accidentally witnesses a murder by a big-time drug dealer.As both a producer and a writer, Apatow's distinctive trademark is lowbrow slapstick crossed with highbrow wit.  In ""Pineapple Express,"" Apatow and his co-scenarists Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg are not afraid to let their scenes run on a bit, resulting in a natural comic rhythm that allows the humor to grow organically out of the dialogue, characters and situations.  This has been billed in some quarters as the ""pot comedy,"" and while there are indeed many jokes that revolve around being stoned, the drug aspect is often incidental to what is really going on in the movie.  Directed by David Gordon Green, ""Pineapple Express"" joins a long list of recent comedies about men who refuse to grow up and accept the responsibility of being adults.  Yet, unlike, say, ""Step Brothers,"" ""Pineapple Express"" never talks down to its audience.  Even the slapstick is performed at a surprisingly high level of sophistication, and the movie features one of the most gut-bustingly hilarious car chase sequences we've encountered in quite some time.  The movie stumbles only in its closing stretches when it abandons its character-driven humor in favor of action-comedy hijinks.Seth Rogen duplicates his comical Everyman triumph from ""Knocked Up,"" while James Franco emerges as the most endearing stoner since Sean Penn first burst upon the scene in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" all those years ago.Add yet another one to the Apatow ""win"" column.",4,Apatow still on a roll,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,1975,"['last', 'year', 'hits', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad', 'were', 'movie-comedy', 'equivalent', 'grand', 'slam', 'homeruns', 'then', 'latest', 'concoction', 'producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'one', 'entitled', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'killer', 'weed', 'very', 'least', 'solid', 'triple', 'More', 'contrived', 'storyline', 'two', 'earlier', 'films', 'less', 'hilarious', 'account', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'tale', 'two', 'certified', 'potheads', 'Dale', 'Saul', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'go', 'lam', 'Dale', 'accidentally', 'murder', 'big-time', 'drug', 'producer', 'writer', 'Apatow', 'distinctive', 'trademark', 'lowbrow', 'slapstick', 'crossed', 'highbrow', 'wit', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'Apatow', 'co-scenarists', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'let', 'scenes', 'run', 'bit', 'resulting', 'natural', 'comic', 'rhythm', 'humor', 'grow', 'organically', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'situations', 'been', 'billed', 'quarters', 'pot', 'comedy', 'are', 'indeed', 'many', 'jokes', 'revolve', 'being', 'stoned', 'drug', 'aspect', 'often', 'incidental', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'movie', 'Directed', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'long', 'list', 'recent', 'comedies', 'men', 'who', 'refuse', 'grow', 'up', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'being', 'adults', 'say', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'never', 'down', 'audience', 'Even', 'slapstick', 'performed', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'level', 'sophistication', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'gut-bustingly', 'hilarious', 'car', 'chase', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'quite', 'time', 'movie', 'only', 'closing', 'stretches', 'when', 'character-driven', 'humor', 'favor', 'action-comedy', 'hijinks.Seth', 'Rogen', 'comical', 'Everyman', 'triumph', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'James', 'Franco', 'most', 'endearing', 'stoner', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'first', 'scene', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'years', 'ago.Add', 'yet', 'one', 'Apatow', 'win', 'column']",N/A

James Franco, echoing his roots as a burnout in Apatow's wonderful ""Freaks and Geeks,"" is a revelation as the kindly and deliriously goofy dealer Saul. His opening scene, in which he nearly chokes on a stick of strawberries laughing at an episode of the Jeffersons, is possibly the best introduction to a character I've ever seen, and the evolving buddy dynamic with Rogen is beautiful.

Starring (and co-written by) Apatow vet Seth Rogen alongside James Franco (""Spiderman"") in a breakout role, ""PA"" is a long, often hilarious comedy that for some reason devolves into a bloody shoot-em-up.Perhaps that's half the point - when you're as perpetually and spectacularly stoned as Dale (Rogen) and Saul (Franco), sometimes you wander into an entirely different movie.The initial set-up of the flick is standard Apatow.  Dale Denton is a low-life yet creative process server whose biggest ambition in life is to have pot legalized.  As a stoner, though, Denton's only steps toward legalization consist of calling in on radio talk shows to discuss the merits of legalization and also buying copious amounts of the stuff.  His dealer is Saul who, unlike *every other dealer in the world* claims to have exclusive access to the Really Good Stuff.  This weed is the famed Pineapple Express.Unfortunately for Dale, PA is actually very exclusive and the only local supplier is Ted Jones (Gary Cole).  Dale witnesses Cole and his sidekick Police Officer Carol (Rosie Perez) murder a rival dealer, freaks, and leaves a half-smoked joint of Pineapple Express behind.  And so the hunt for Saul and Dale is on.Rogen and his co-writer Evan Goldberg have written one funny, funny movie.  There's plenty of stoner comedy and plenty of straight stuff as well, and even though the movie's pretty darn long, it never wears out its welcome.That is, until the movie devolves into a bizarrely violent shoot-em-up scene that seems completely unrelated to the rest of the movie.  An un-subtle reference to the dangers of pot, or the throwing up of hands of writers who didn't have a good idea how to finish the movie?  Inquiring minds want to know.A good movie that could have been great - a very close near miss by this talented and prolific team.  The only sure-fire winner in this production is Franco, who leaves his pretty-boy status behind and shows that he is a true comic actor of style and timing - a breakout performance.",3,Loo-oong stoner comedy has great comic moments with Joel Silver action sequence attached,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,2156,"['David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'George', 'Washington', 'latest', 'hit', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'machine', '40-Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Superbad', 'etc.', 'Starring', 'co-written', 'Apatow', 'vet', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'James', 'Franco', 'Spiderman', 'breakout', 'role', 'PA', 'long', 'often', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'reason', 'bloody', 'shoot-em-up.Perhaps', 'point', 'when', ""'re"", 'perpetually', 'spectacularly', 'stoned', 'Dale', 'Rogen', 'Saul', 'Franco', 'sometimes', 'wander', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie.The', 'initial', 'set-up', 'flick', 'standard', 'Apatow', 'Dale', 'Denton', 'low-life', 'yet', 'creative', 'process', 'server', 'biggest', 'ambition', 'life', 'have', 'pot', 'legalized', 'stoner', 'though', 'Denton', 'only', 'steps', 'legalization', 'consist', 'calling', 'radio', 'talk', 'discuss', 'merits', 'legalization', 'also', 'buying', 'copious', 'amounts', 'stuff', 'dealer', 'Saul', 'who', '*every', 'other', 'dealer', 'world*', 'claims', 'have', 'exclusive', 'access', 'Really', 'Good', 'Stuff', 'weed', 'famed', 'Pineapple', 'Express.Unfortunately', 'Dale', 'PA', 'actually', 'very', 'exclusive', 'only', 'local', 'supplier', 'Ted', 'Jones', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Dale', 'witnesses', 'Cole', 'sidekick', 'Police', 'Officer', 'Carol', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'murder', 'rival', 'dealer', 'freaks', 'half-smoked', 'joint', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'so', 'hunt', 'Saul', 'Dale', 'on.Rogen', 'co-writer', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'have', 'written', 'one', 'funny', 'funny', 'movie', 'plenty', 'stoner', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'straight', 'stuff', 'well', 'even', 'movie', 'pretty', 'darn', 'long', 'never', 'out', 'welcome.That', 'movie', 'bizarrely', 'violent', 'shoot-em-up', 'scene', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'rest', 'movie', 'un-subtle', 'reference', 'dangers', 'pot', 'throwing', 'hands', 'writers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'finish', 'movie', 'Inquiring', 'minds', 'want', 'know.A', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'very', 'close', 'miss', 'talented', 'prolific', 'team', 'only', 'sure-fire', 'winner', 'production', 'Franco', 'who', 'pretty-boy', 'status', 'true', 'comic', 'actor', 'style', 'timing', 'breakout', 'performance']",N/A

1146711,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B0014E29UA,Siklootd,"[2, 4]","Seth Rogen is quickly adding films to his ever growing resume of comedy roles, and ""Pineapple Express"" may be one of the best films of his career.  Seth Rogen and James Franco have great on screen chemistry, contrasting and complimenting each other perfectly to create a nice blend of comedic styles onscreen for the viewers to enjoy.  The two actors portray their characters perfectly, allowing the audience to truly experience the hilarity and abundant jokes that the film consists of.The film begins by showing the army experimenting with Marijuana back in 1937.  They are performing several tests to check whether or not the herbal hallucinogen is safe enough to be legalized in the United States.  The soldier under going the experiments starts off fine, acting rather casual and normal, until he takes his first inhalation of the herb.  Slowly after consumption of the drug, the soldier begins to mouth off to his superiors, resulting in the denial of legalization of Marijuana.The film jumps to present day time, showing Dale Denton (Rogen) using disguises to issue subpoenas to unsuspecting citizens.  Dale also has a hobby he uses to pass the time, Marijuana.  Stopping by to visit his local dealer Saul (James Franco), Dale is given the opportunity to purchase a new form of weed that just came in.  Saul describes it as being the most potent form of Marijuana avaiable.  It's name: ""Pineapple Express"".  Saul states that he's the only dealer in town with access to the drug, after getting it directly from his supplier.  Dale leaves Saul's home in order to deliver his latest subpoena to a man by the name of Ted Jones.  Unbeknown to Dale, Ted Jones is actually a drug lord at wars with the Asian drug cartel.  Upon arriving outside Ted's home late night to deliver the subpoena, Dale witnesses Ted and his female partner (a cop by the name of Carol) murder someone on the top floor of the house near the large glass window.In a state of panic, Dale attempts to flee the scene in his vehicle, leaving behind his roach of Pineapple Express outside Ted's house.  Ted immediately recognizes the drug and knows that only one supplier in town has access to Pineapple Express.  Red is the only supplier with access to the drug, and he happens to be Saul's supplier as well.  After linking Dale back to the scene of the crime, Ted stops at nothing to ensure the demise of the man who witnessed the murder he committed.The film's plot is well carried out, and filled with non-stop action and jokes in every scene.  Scenes such as the forest scene in which both Saul and Dale go ballistic after realizing Ted is after them is hilarious.  The two actors fumble around in the darkness, screaming and running away from nothing, and destroying their cell phones in the process due to paranoia.  The confrontation at Red's house also provides abundant laughs to the audience.  The film never takes itself too seriously, but at the same time does not come off as a farce film simply aimed at producing jokes without a plot either.  It finds a nice balance between story telling and joke delivering, and throwing in a few nice action sequences truly helps balance the film as well.""Pineapple Express"" is one of the funnier movies I've experienced recently, and despite its flaws, it still has enough variety to please comedy fans.  If you're a fan of either Franco or Rogen, you cannot go wrong picking up this film.

Well, if you like stoner films (like Up In Smoke), than you will like this one too. It's not a classic, like Up In Smoke, but it is definitely one of the better stoner films out there.Dale (Seth Rogen) is a process server, who drives around and smokes joints like there is no tomorrow, has a girlfriend that is a senior in high school and who is still WAY out of his league, and is a very likable loser. He accepts on where he is in his life, and is happy on where he is. Dale's ""best friend"" Saul (James Franco) is a pot smoker/dealer who, like Dale, is a loser, and the only reason he became a pot dealer was to put his grandmother in a nice retirement home and has plans on becoming a civil engineer once she's gone. Saul sells Dale some rare weed called (you guessed it) ""pineapple express"", from there Dale witnesses a murder of a rival drug gang member by Ted Jones (Gary Cole) and a corrupt police officer (Rosie Perez). It's after what Dale sees that Dale and Saul try to figure out how to get out of the serious situation that they are in.That's the story in a nutshell. Seth Rogen, like in Knocked Up and Zack and Miri, is the lovable loser; he has it down pat, and is very real as a real-life loser. James Franco is so convincing as the loser who sits around, get's high, and does nothing. James Franco is very likable as the loser; he really doesn't feel right at home as the serious, button-up type of actor (like in the Spider Man movies), he feels very real as the slacker-type, and he really can act.Gary Cole and Rosie Perez characters are very one-dimensional; their is no meat to them as characters, they are just the bad duo and they both want Saul and Dale dead. They share some screen time together, but most of the time it's Dale and Saul together trying to piece together a plan on what to do next and how to keep themselves alive.Pineapple Express is a film that is not trying to be Oscar worthy, but it is funny with very witty dialogue, and the conversations between Dale and Saul feel very genuine, and they both learn from each other and grow as characters as the movie progresses. The movie doesn't try to add silly situations where they try to find a way out or fight all the time about something (*cough* Harold and Kumar *cough*), nor does it have gross-out humor to try to make me laugh; the dialogue and conversations between Dale and Saul are funny and feel very real.

The jokes are consistently humorous on an immature level, and surprising action sequences regularly surface, but the quality of the content rises and falls like the ever present waft of marijuana smoke. At certain times the realism is put on hold for utter nonsense, and at others the bloody drug wars become alarmingly authentic. This perpetually changing style of comedy makes remembering the high points of the film rather cloudy.Process server Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) leads a life of ease, constantly serving subpoenas and smoking weed. Save for the anxieties of having a girlfriend in high school, his life somewhat mirrors that of drug dealer Saul (James Franco), who works from home and consistently indulges in his own supply. When Dale witnesses a murder - and leaves a crucial piece of evidence at the crime scene linking him with Saul - the pair attempt to elude the killers and end up on a wild adventure full of car chases, gunfights, gang wars, crooked cops, and the rarest marijuana in the world.As the film progresses the comedy steadily reaches higher levels of absurdity - as do the levels of action violence and harrowing seriousness. These rather clashing elements are somewhat alleviated with slapstick and an undying comrade, but never reach a satisfying equilibrium. In Hot Fuzz, director Edgar Wright chose to place his comedic characters in a harsh reality, creating a stable vision of dark humor. Pineapple Express opts to weave in and out of believability with characters that also defy the realms of realism, resulting in a movie that starts in situational silliness, progresses into drug-related drama, and ends in an exaggerated action extravaganza. Gunshot wounds, coffee-pot face-scarring, and beating up a policewoman might provide more laughs than you'd think, but such serious topics run contrary to the carefree comedy found earlier in the picture.Seth Rogen plays himself again, which certainly doesn't hurt the humor, but giving himself the straight-man part allows others to steal the spotlight. James Franco delivers a truly riotous performance as the wacky drug dealer, Saul, and relishes in the crazy antics and bizarre conversations intrinsic to his character's constant state of intoxication. Danny McBride also provides numerous moments of verbal and physical ingenuity, but the vast majority of other supporting characters feel wasted, especially funnyman Craig Robinson whose contributions to the jocosity are surprisingly slim.While Rogen and crew have nailed the immature, weed-friendly humor in their latest outing, such absurd gags and violent slapstick only go so far before feeling exhausted. The highlights of Pineapple Express arise not from such ""stoner"" comedy, but instead from the snippets of hilarious truths reflected in the troubled relationships imbedded in the buddy flick.- The Massie Twins",3,Pineapple Express Review from The Massie Twins,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,2986,"['unpredictable', 'amount', 'violence', 'heavily', 'intoxicated', 'cast', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'latest', 'production', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'jokes', 'are', 'consistently', 'humorous', 'immature', 'level', 'surprising', 'action', 'sequences', 'regularly', 'surface', 'quality', 'content', 'ever', 'present', 'waft', 'marijuana', 'smoke', 'certain', 'times', 'realism', 'put', 'hold', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'others', 'bloody', 'drug', 'wars', 'become', 'alarmingly', 'authentic', 'perpetually', 'changing', 'style', 'comedy', 'remembering', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'rather', 'cloudy.Process', 'server', 'Dale', 'Denton', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'life', 'ease', 'constantly', 'serving', 'subpoenas', 'smoking', 'weed', 'Save', 'anxieties', 'having', 'girlfriend', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'somewhat', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Saul', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'home', 'consistently', 'indulges', 'own', 'supply', 'When', 'Dale', 'murder', 'crucial', 'piece', 'evidence', 'crime', 'scene', 'linking', 'Saul', 'pair', 'attempt', 'elude', 'killers', 'end', 'up', 'wild', 'adventure', 'full', 'car', 'chases', 'gunfights', 'gang', 'wars', 'crooked', 'cops', 'rarest', 'marijuana', 'world.As', 'film', 'comedy', 'steadily', 'higher', 'levels', 'absurdity', 'do', 'levels', 'action', 'violence', 'harrowing', 'seriousness', 'rather', 'clashing', 'elements', 'are', 'somewhat', 'alleviated', 'slapstick', 'undying', 'comrade', 'never', 'reach', 'satisfying', 'equilibrium', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'chose', 'place', 'comedic', 'characters', 'harsh', 'reality', 'creating', 'stable', 'vision', 'dark', 'humor', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'opts', 'weave', 'believability', 'characters', 'also', 'defy', 'realms', 'realism', 'resulting', 'movie', 'situational', 'silliness', 'drug-related', 'drama', 'exaggerated', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'Gunshot', 'wounds', 'coffee-pot', 'face-scarring', 'beating', 'up', 'policewoman', 'might', 'provide', 'more', 'laughs', ""'d"", 'think', 'such', 'serious', 'topics', 'run', 'contrary', 'carefree', 'comedy', 'found', 'earlier', 'picture.Seth', 'Rogen', 'again', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'humor', 'giving', 'straight-man', 'part', 'others', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'James', 'Franco', 'truly', 'riotous', 'performance', 'wacky', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Saul', 'relishes', 'crazy', 'antics', 'bizarre', 'conversations', 'intrinsic', 'character', 'constant', 'state', 'intoxication', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'also', 'numerous', 'moments', 'verbal', 'physical', 'ingenuity', 'vast', 'majority', 'other', 'supporting', 'characters', 'feel', 'wasted', 'especially', 'funnyman', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'contributions', 'jocosity', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'slim.While', 'Rogen', 'crew', 'have', 'nailed', 'immature', 'weed-friendly', 'humor', 'latest', 'outing', 'such', 'absurd', 'gags', 'violent', 'slapstick', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'feeling', 'exhausted', 'highlights', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'arise', 'not', 'such', 'stoner', 'comedy', 'instead', 'snippets', 'hilarious', 'truths', 'reflected', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'imbedded', 'buddy', 'flick.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

1146723,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0014E29UA,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 1]","""Pineapple Express"" has so many good things going for it, it's a shame it undermines them with odd shifts in tone and a schizophrenic structure.Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a process server.  The job suits him because it offers plenty of time to smoke joints and get high in his car as he drives around to find his marks and hand them subpoenas.  His friendly dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco), is a laid back, long-haired dude who maintains a constant high and likes to state impressive, heavy thoughts that reflect a mind hazed over by marijuana.  Saul offers Dale his latest product -- Pineapple Express, a potent form of pot that only Saul is selling.When Dale heads off to serve his next subpoena to Ted Jones (Gary Cole), who happens to be the city's most dangerous drug lord, he witnesses a murder and drives off in a panic, but not before he tosses away his Pineapple Express roach.  The murderers, Jones and a crooked cop (Rosie Perez), hear the commotion but fail to see who witnessed the murder.  They find the roach, Jones samples it, realizes it is Pineapple Express and knows Saul can lead them to the witness.Director David Gordon Green has created a sort of Frankenstein of a movie.  It seems to be cobbled together from parts of several movies rather than a cohesive whole.  The first half of the movie is its best.  The conversations between Saul and Dale are wonderfully surreal, as Saul's pot-induced misunderstandings or loopy associations make for some very funny scenes.  Franco, not really known for comedy (he's the somber Harry Osborn in the ""Spider-Man"" series), does a fantastic job underplaying Saul and is the source of most of the humor.  In fact, Rogen and Franco work like an off-centered Abbott and Costello with Rogen, the less stoned of the two, serving as straight man and Franco delivering not so much punchlines as dissociated responses that are often hilarious.The light, comic tone is perfect for the subject matter, and the film moves along briskly until, suddenly, it shifts gears to a violent action flick complete with a car chase, shoot `em ups, and brutal killings.  With such carnage going on, the attempt to blend comedy fails to come off, and the laughs are stifled by graphic, gruesome mayhem.Rogen, who should win a Most Unlikely Guy to Become a Movie Star statuette, has defined a new kind of leading man.  He plays a kind of man-child -- a fellow in his mid-20's to early 30's who retains a longed-for adolescence.  In ""Pineapple Express,"" for example, his 25-year-old Dale is dating an 18-year-old high school student, Angie* (Amber Heard).  When we see him visit her at school, it is a decidedly creepy scene.  And he still revels in getting high, choosing a job that allows him plenty of time to engage in his favorite pastime.I like Green's easy-going, episodic narrative in the first half of the film, which finds buddies Saul and Dale -- who don't realize they're buddies until they are on the run from the bad guys -- undergoing a series of misadventures in the woods, during a car chase, or at the home of middleman drug dealer Red (Danny R. McBride).  It plays like an odyssey of two stoners who outwit their fates by sheer luck, clumsiness, and on-the-spot decision making.  When the full-out action stuff kicks in, the movie loses its charm.Rated R for extreme violence, strong language, and abundant marijuana use, ""Pineapple Express"" is a movie whose potential isn't fully realized.  The fault lies with director Green, who takes an obvious road in the movie's third act rather than drawing upon more original means to tie the plot together.  The film reminds me of a student who writes a well crafted essay but, getting tired of thinking by 3 A.M., hastily scribbles down a final paragraph.",3,Stoner Comedy Mixes Laughs & Action,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,3758,"['Pineapple', 'Express', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'shame', 'odd', 'shifts', 'tone', 'schizophrenic', 'structure.Dale', 'Denton', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'process', 'server', 'job', 'suits', 'plenty', 'time', 'smoke', 'joints', 'get', 'high', 'car', 'find', 'marks', 'hand', 'subpoenas', 'friendly', 'dealer', 'Saul', 'Silver', 'James', 'Franco', 'laid', 'back', 'long-haired', 'dude', 'who', 'constant', 'high', 'likes', 'state', 'impressive', 'heavy', 'thoughts', 'reflect', 'mind', 'hazed', 'marijuana', 'Saul', 'Dale', 'latest', 'product', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'potent', 'form', 'pot', 'only', 'Saul', 'selling.When', 'Dale', 'heads', 'serve', 'next', 'subpoena', 'Ted', 'Jones', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'who', 'be', 'city', 'most', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'lord', 'murder', 'off', 'panic', 'not', 'away', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'roach', 'murderers', 'Jones', 'crooked', 'cop', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'hear', 'commotion', 'fail', 'see', 'who', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'find', 'roach', 'Jones', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'Saul', 'can', 'lead', 'witness.Director', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'created', 'sort', 'Frankenstein', 'movie', 'be', 'cobbled', 'together', 'parts', 'several', 'movies', 'rather', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'best', 'conversations', 'Saul', 'Dale', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'surreal', 'Saul', 'pot-induced', 'misunderstandings', 'loopy', 'associations', 'make', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Franco', 'not', 'really', 'known', 'comedy', 'somber', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Spider-Man', 'series', 'fantastic', 'job', 'underplaying', 'Saul', 'source', 'most', 'humor', 'fact', 'Rogen', 'Franco', 'work', 'off-centered', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Rogen', 'less', 'stoned', 'two', 'serving', 'straight', 'man', 'Franco', 'delivering', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'punchlines', 'dissociated', 'responses', 'are', 'often', 'hilarious.The', 'light', 'comic', 'tone', 'perfect', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'moves', 'briskly', 'suddenly', 'gears', 'violent', 'action', 'flick', 'complete', 'car', 'chase', 'shoot', 'em', 'ups', 'brutal', 'killings', 'such', 'carnage', 'going', 'attempt', 'blend', 'comedy', 'fails', 'come', 'off', 'laughs', 'are', 'stifled', 'graphic', 'gruesome', 'mayhem.Rogen', 'who', 'should', 'win', 'Most', 'Unlikely', 'Guy', 'Become', 'Movie', 'Star', 'statuette', 'defined', 'new', 'kind', 'leading', 'man', 'kind', 'man-child', 'fellow', 'mid-20', 'early', '30', 'who', 'longed-for', 'adolescence', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'example', '25-year-old', 'Dale', 'dating', '18-year-old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Angie*', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'When', 'see', 'visit', 'school', 'decidedly', 'creepy', 'scene', 'still', 'getting', 'high', 'choosing', 'job', 'plenty', 'time', 'engage', 'favorite', 'pastime.I', 'Green', 'easy-going', 'episodic', 'narrative', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'buddies', 'Saul', 'Dale', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'re"", 'buddies', 'are', 'run', 'bad', 'guys', 'undergoing', 'series', 'misadventures', 'woods', 'car', 'chase', 'home', 'middleman', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Red', 'Danny', 'R.', 'McBride', 'odyssey', 'two', 'stoners', 'who', 'outwit', 'fates', 'sheer', 'luck', 'clumsiness', 'on-the-spot', 'decision', 'making', 'When', 'full-out', 'action', 'stuff', 'kicks', 'movie', 'charm.Rated', 'R', 'extreme', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'abundant', 'marijuana', 'use', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'movie', 'potential', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'fault', 'director', 'Green', 'who', 'obvious', 'road', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'rather', 'drawing', 'more', 'original', 'means', 'tie', 'plot', 'together', 'film', 'student', 'who', 'well', 'crafted', 'essay', 'getting', 'tired', 'thinking', '3', 'A.M.', 'hastily', 'down', 'final', 'paragraph']",N/A

1146726,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0014E29UA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","""Pineapple Express"", the new film from producer Judd Apatow (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"") is a very funny, action packed film and goes a long way to restore my faith in the promise this filmmaker has shown to turn the comedy genre around. He just needs to be a little more selective about the films he puts his name on. And this film suffers from the same evil every one of his other films suffers from; it is too long. By about twenty minutes.Dale Denton (Seth Rogen, also a co-writer for the film) is a process server who is just as happy to spend a lot of time driving around and smoking pot. When he does have a job to do, he employs one of the many elaborate costumes he keeps in his trunk and seems to do a good job. But he simply isn't motivated to do anything but smoke pot. His dealer, Saul (James Franco), likes Dale so he offers him some 'Pineapple Express', a super-exclusive new blend from his supplier, Ted. Dale and Saul try some and proceed to get very high, but Dale has to leave and serve another subpoena. He rolls up in front of a house and proceeds to light up, eager to maintain the buzz. A cop pulls up behind him and the officer (Rosie Perez) hurries inside to join Ted (Gary Cole) as they murder an archenemy. Dale sees the whole thing through Ted's plate glass living room window. Excited, he tries to flee, but manages to hit the police car, garnering Ted's attention. He hurries back to Saul and the two are soon on the run from Ted. Along the way, they try to get Red (Danny McBride), Ted and Saul's middleman, to help them. And Dale has to deal with his teenager girlfriend, Angie (Amber Heard) who is anxious for Dale to come over for dinner and meet her parents (Nora Dunn and Ed Begley Jr.).""Pineapple Express"", directed by David Gordon Green and co-written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (""Superbad"") is a funny, strange, unusual film. I can't think of a lot of stoner action-comedies, so it certainly has originality going for it. And I think the influence of Green, who has a background in hyper-realistic independent dramas, also adds something unique and unusual to the story.Dale and Saul are both very funny characters and the moments we spend getting to know each of them are very funny. Dale is a guy who knows he has to work, if for no other reason than to support his pot habit. So he completes his assignments and does a good job of it. The job is really a perfect fit for Dale as it gives him flexible hours, he can work out of his car, and spend as much time smoking pot, as he likes. Wearing an out of date beige suite and his hair puffed up, he spends a lot of time in his car, driving around, and a haze of smoke enveloping him as he roams the city streets.Rogen injects this character with a lot of humor. As we meet Dale, he is driving around in his mid 80s Cadillac, smoking, talking to himself, singing along to the music. This is a guy with few cares in the world. When he has to work, he has built up an elaborate collection of costumes, allowing him access to a diverse group of people, allowing him to get close enough to serve them their papers. He has a delivery person's outfit, a doctor's smock and other costumes, and more all stowed away in his trunk.When he goes to see Saul, to buy some pot, we realize that as much as he is a pothead, he still has some common sense. He is a little weirded out when Saul claims they are friends and doesn't know how to react exactly.It is also interesting to watch Dale's interactions with Angie, his girlfriend, who is still a teenager, in high school. He stops by to see her during her break between classes and watches as she interacts with other students (including a jock is the complete opposite of Rogen's character) and a male teacher (who is clearly smitten with the jock, funny stuff). Just as we see that Dale does have some common sense, the fact he is dating a teenager contradicts this previous thought and we realize Dale is a little more complicated than we originally thought. Angie is very adamant that Dale comes over for dinner, to meet her parents (played by Ed Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn). I don't know about you, but if my teenage daughter brought over someone as old as Dale and introduced him as a boyfriend, I would flip out. But their eventual meeting is a lot more interesting than that because it ties into the rest of the story and becomes a part of the ongoing saga.Saul, played by James Franco, is less interesting, but still funny. When we first meet Saul it is because he is an extension of Dale's life. Therefore, we don't learn as much about Saul, about his life without Dale. When Dale shows up, the effects of living in a cloud of pot are immediately apparent. Saul has to focus very hard for anything to make sense, in order to make anything happen. When Dale arrives, he seems genuinely pleased to see his best customer and they share camaraderie. But Saul seems more interested in shooting the breeze with Dale, talking about anything and nothing. Dale recognizes their relationship is strictly business and wants to buy his pot and get out of there.I have to give a lot of credit to James Franco for making Saul seem so real. With dirty stringy hair held back by a sweatband and wearing a t-shirt and sleep bottoms, Saul is wearing his work uniform. He rarely, if ever, has to leave his apartment, so he might as well be comfortable. Because he is high all the time, Saul readily smiles and laughs, appearing to be goofy at all times. This is quite a transformation for this actor and he is easily classified as one of the most handsome actors working in film today. The fact Franco can make Saul seem real, like the grubby mess he is supposed to be, is a testament to his skill because it is so different from our usual image of this actor.As the story veers off in various directions, Saul takes a few minutes to catch up, a few minutes to calculate what he should try to do and accomplish. And frequently, this is not the right thing, but at least he tries.Danny McBride is receiving a lot of great critical notices for his portrayal of Red. This is the type of character who is so out of left-field (even in a stoner action-comedy) that he has to garner attention. The abuse he receives throughout the course of the film is amusing because it becomes obsessive and just when you think it can't go on, it does.Judd Apatow has assembled an interesting cast and his choice of director is unusual, to say the least. David Gordon Green, the director behind ""George Washington"", ""All the Pretty Girls"", ""Undertow"" and ""Snow Angels"", helms this stoner action-comedy. Based on his previous films, it seems an odd choice. But it also proves to be an interesting choice, adding another level to this project making it a better and more interesting film.I think the influence of David Gordon Green comes in some moments peppered here and there, helping to establish the relationships between the characters. It is fairly remarkable these moments are included at all, but Apatow, Rogen and Goldberg included them in the script and they are just the type of thing that make Green's films stand out, so they are a part of ""Pineapple Express"". The first time Dale goes over to Saul's apartment, they talk. During the conversation, we learn a lot about both of these characters and see how they interact. This helps to set up the rest of the film and make all of their further actions understandable. And as the film progresses, we are introduced to each character in this fashion. We meet them, they talk, we learn little things about their characters and their history with other characters, and they run off to create mischief.If you enjoy films like ""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"", you probably won't like ""Pineapple Express"", or at least you won't appreciate it as much. The fact that the filmmakers go to the trouble to establish characters, to have them interact with one another, and to have these interactions later inform the story and actions we are witnessing on screen, places this film head and shoulders above most stoner comedies. When Dale and Saul are stranded in the forest, they talk and we really see the extent of their relationship. When Dale and Saul end up having dinner with Angie, it is all the funnier because they are on the run from Ted, but also because how else could a meeting between a man in his mid twenties and the parents of his teenage girlfriend go?""Pineapple Express"" could benefit from more editing. It is, as most Judd Apatow films are, twenty minutes or so too long. How did I determine this? Comedies aren't supposed to drag and when you are watching a comedy and start fidgeting in your seat, it's too long. In all likelihood, you're fidgeting because you aren't laughing or your interest is waning. In Apatow's films, there are a lot of funny jokes and humorous moments, but his films begin to drag when the exposition starts, when the filmmakers try to make the characters more human and believable. A lot of this works, and a lot of this helps to set these comedies apart. But there is always too much of this.Apatow deserves a lot of credit for including this type of thing at all, trying to make his characters seem more real than say, any Adam Sandler creation, but he tends to go overboard. In ""Knocked Up"", there was a lengthy sequence after the two leads fight showing Rogen's character getting an apartment, moving in, getting a day job, etc. This is a good way to help establish his character, but it goes on too long and takes on an overly serious tone. In ""Pineapple Express"", there are one or two too many scenes between Dale and Saul, making their interactions a bit long.But ""Pineapple Express"" is a stoner action - comedy. I have never seen another film claiming to be this, so ""Express"" has a lot of area to cover during it's almost two hour running time. There is a funny action scene about halfway through when Saul and Dale are trying to get away from Rosie Perez. Saul is driving a police car, unable to see through the windshield. The climax is an elaborately staged action sequence in an old barn. This scene is both too long and almost brilliant. It is almost brilliant because it is too long and goes on forever, with all of the characters fighting one another, inflicting real pain and real harm. It does go on too long, but as it continues you realize how excessive it is. Each time someone gets harmed, they get up again, ready for more.""Pineapple Express"" is very good. It isn't great, but it is funny, action packed and has more than a few memorable laughs.",4,"Ride the ""Express"" to the Theater",1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,10596,"['Pineapple', 'Express', 'new',

1146727,A1997C46112EKH,B0014E29UA,Tiffany Bell,"[2, 3]","Just got this for Blu-Ray. Wouldn't start on my PS3 at all. It would get to the puffs of smoke and then reset, infinitely.The fix for me was pretty easy. I just turned off Blu-Ray internet connection. Once I did that, it started up with no problem.As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, it's a basic comedy movie. There's really no reason to pick this up on Blu-Ray if you already have it in DVD. It's nice to have it look crisp and clear, but there's no need to double-dip.As far as the content goes, I really enjoyed this movie. It's better the first time around.

1146729,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0014E29UA,Turfseer,"[6, 18]","Seth Rogen is the type of actor who simply plays himself. In ""Knocked Up"", there was a positive arc to the story where he plays a loser who must take on adult responsibilities and eventually grow up. In ""Pineapple Express"", he remains a loser and we can never believe in his journey since he's pitted against a bunch of unlikeable, unsavory comic book characters.Rogen plays Dale Denton, a process server, who witnesses a murder by a drug dealer and then must elude the drug dealer's hired killers who are out to get him. His buddy marijuana dealer, Saul Silver, joins him as they elude the hit men. Right away you see how dumb the movie is when Denton is able to witness a murder which occurs inside a house in full view of anyone walking on the street. Another ridiculous moment occurs when Saul's marijuana supplier is shot point blank in the stomach but manages to survive and then is strong enough to drive Denton to the drug dealer's lair.Of course those who wrote the movie undoubtedly will argue that the situations are supposed to be over the top and that's the humor of it. But there comes a point where there are so many scenes that are so ridiculous that one simply doesn't care about the characters anymore. Rogen and Franco do their Beavis and Butthead impersonations but their humor has no subtlety and relies mainly on slapstick to get by. There's a romantic subplot involving Denton's relationship with a girl who's a high school student but that fizzles completely especially at the end when the screenwriters forgot to tell us what happened between the two.While this is supposed to be a somewhat good-natured farce about two guys who share a mutual love for marijuana, there's a lot of unnecessary violence with drug dealers killing one another during the finale. The ending undercuts the more good-natured scenes between the film's two protagonists.If you check out the IMDb graph as to the age groups who liked this film, you will see that the older you are, you are less likely to like it.

It's a traditional stoner comedy with a good amount of Hong Kong gangster action mixed in, and the result is a very funny movie that had me smiling the rest of the night. Seth Rogen and James Franco, both from Judd Apatow's landmark TV show ""Freaks & Geeks"", are great at playing freaks once again. They're a lovable pair, making a great buddy picture.

1146731,AWRGM17GTMND8,B0014E29UA,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[0, 1]","Pineapple is one of those movies that is a lot funnier the second time around.  After viewing the whole blu-ray disc, I found the film improved in my mind.  Why, you ask? Probably because I notice more cleverness in the humor.  I think the directing style of this film left less punchlines and more raw comedy.  Sometimes people need an induced laugh by effective editing.  But now that I have watched the movie a few times, I find it contains a lot of talented people withstanding harsh criticism.  With that being said, I find that Pineapple express is probably not a very successfull film, but its odd movie that is very hilarious, if it strikes you in the right spot.  (Hilarious to the non-majority unfortunately).I believe the film carried itself more with James Franco's part more than the others.  Who would have thought that the Green Goblin would be a hilarious pot dealer?  He definately holds the spot as my favorite character next to Rogen and McBride.  As a stoner-comedy is does its purpose.  I think Harold and Kumar performed the genre a little bit better, because they were clearly stoned, where as these characters were clearly smoking.  I didn't really see the effects of smoking dope on these characters, besides Franco, who seemed always stoned.To conclude my review, I'll say that Pineapple Express is a very odd comedy that will be very mixed in reviews.  Some will find it boring, and some will find it extremely entertaining.  The reason for this is essentially the style of the film.  The raw footage approach along with the sort of quite humor, doesn't appeal to a lot of people.  Pineapple Express doesn't excatly slap you in the face with humor, you end up having to search for it a little.  Expect some action to compliment the comedy and you should be satisfied.  It definately has something to offer in the fight department.  Lastly, Pineapple Express really just suffers from the ""Trailer effect"".  The previews for this film were so good that the movie turned out to be a letdown for a lot of people.  We saw a flashy montage with great punchlines, that turned out to be a kick back oddball stoner movie that regular people didn't laugh to.P.S.: The Blu-ray disc is loaded with amazing special features.  I appreciate the time and effort the actors put in to make these hilarious skits to compliment the film.",4,"Sometimes a Little Dry, but Overall Another Funny Rogen Film",1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,2344,"['Pineapple', 'one', 'movies', 'lot', 'funnier', 'second', 'time', 'viewing', 'whole', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'found', 'film', 'improved', 'mind', 'Why', 'ask', 'Probably', 'notice', 'more', 'cleverness', 'humor', 'think', 'directing', 'style', 'film', 'left', 'less', 'punchlines', 'more', 'raw', 'comedy', 'Sometimes', 'people', 'need', 'induced', 'laugh', 'effective', 'editing', 'now', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'find', 'lot', 'talented', 'people', 'withstanding', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'being', 'said', 'find', 'Pineapple', 'express', 'probably', 'not', 'very', 'successfull', 'film', 'odd', 'movie', 'very', 'hilarious', 'right', 'spot', 'Hilarious', 'non-majority', 'unfortunately', '.I', 'believe', 'film', 'carried', 'more', 'James', 'Franco', 'part', 'more', 'others', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'would', 'be', 'hilarious', 'pot', 'dealer', 'definately', 'spot', 'favorite', 'character', 'Rogen', 'McBride', 'stoner-comedy', 'purpose', 'think', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'performed', 'genre', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'were', 'clearly', 'stoned', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'clearly', 'smoking', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'effects', 'smoking', 'dope', 'characters', 'Franco', 'who', 'seemed', 'always', 'stoned.To', 'conclude', 'review', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'very', 'odd', 'comedy', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'will', 'find', 'boring', 'will', 'find', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'reason', 'essentially', 'style', 'film', 'raw', 'footage', 'approach', 'sort', 'quite', 'humor', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'lot', 'people', 'Pineapple', 'Express', ""n't"", 'excatly', 'slap', 'face', 'humor', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'search', 'little', 'Expect', 'action', 'compliment', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'satisfied', 'definately', 'something', 'offer', 'fight', 'department', 'Lastly', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'really', 'just', 'suffers', 'Trailer', 'effect', 'previews', 'film', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'letdown', 'lot', 'people', 'saw', 'flashy', 'montage', 'great', 'punchlines', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'kick', 'back', 'oddball', 'stoner', 'movie', 'regular', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'to.P.S', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'loaded', 'amazing', 'special', 'features', 'appreciate', 'time', 'effort', 'actors', 'put', 'make', 'hilarious', 'skits', 'compliment', 'film']",N/A

However, Pineapple Express is barely crossing that border line. I know it's meant to be a stoner film and I suppose it succeeds in that regard.The plot revolves around a guy who has sees a murder and then involves his drug dealer friend in the whole mess. There's more but really it's irrelevant. The plot doesn't matter-it's the weakest link of the film. What matters is the brilliant casting of James Franco as said drug dealer. He completely steals the show from Seth Rogan who is also pretty darn funny in this. Franco's character spends 99% of the film completely stoned but strangely lucid. This film is worth watching just for him.This is definately a 'guy' film. Girls have their chick flicks and I guess men have theirs. I don't mind, as I love plenty of guy films-even sometimes more than chickflicks. But a fair warning for those who don't. This film is 80% F-bombes and the rest of it deals with drug abuse. Still, somehow, Judd Apatow and Seth Rogan manage to bring a little sweetness to the plot. There are those tiny heart-pulling moments where you can't help but smile in fondness, which seems to happen in a few of their popular films. They certainly know what they're doing. They even manage to turn a pointless movie about weed into something with a soul.My real gripe with the film is about the last 15-20 minutes. It completely reminded me of all those Austin Powers films. The characters seem to get dumber by the second, people are shot numerous times and yet are perfectly fine, crazy female cop character going even crazier, etc. I found it a bit silly and over the top.

1146735,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0014E29UA,Wheelchair Assassin,"[1, 2]","I'm the furthest thing from a stoner, but I can still appreciate a well-made action-comedy, which Pineapple Express very much is, whether you appreciate the barrage of marijuana references or not.  The films of the Judd Apatow collective aren't generally known for their emphasis on action, but Pineapple Express manages to make a nice variation on the formula by adding liberal doses of violence to the typical tale of man-children being forced to confront adulthood whether they want to or not.  It's actually a pretty innovative mix of slacker comedy, buddy-action movie, and outright parody, highlighted by a Big Lebowski-esque level of quotability and action scenes that rival those of Hot Fuzz and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (two of my favorite movies ever) for sheer lunacy and ineptitude.  If you've ever wanted to see a succession of fight scenes involving people who have no idea how to fight, this is definitely a movie for you.  The film especially comes to life during its farcical action sequences, which send up action movie staples from the fistfight to the car chase to the climactic free-for-all gun battle with a hilarious emphasis on the absurdity of the subject matter.Playing the sort of relatably unambitious slackers that have become a trademark of Apatow & Co.'s films, Seth Rogen and James Franco head up the cast as pot-loving process server Dale Denton and his spacey dealer Saul Silver, who end up on the run together after Dale sees local drug kingpin Ted Jones (Gary Cole) and a corrupt female cop (Rosie Perez) brutally murdering an Asian competitor.  Once Dale and Saul hit the road, their business relationship undergoes some profound changes while they try to stay alive in the face of one incompetent attempt on their lives after another. Much of the plot is pretty standard action-movie fare, but this film is less about plotting than about the shaggy-dog chemistry of its leads, its frequent entertaining diversions and the intermingling of outrageous physical comedy, over-the-top violence and surprisingly clever, weed-tinged slacker humor.  While its relaxed pace pushes it very close to a two-hour running time, the movie rarely gets dull because it manages its mix of genres so well, with indie director David Gordon Green bringing an attention to detail that's sorely lacking in most mainstream comedies these days.It helps that as Dale and Saul, Rogen and Franco both give unforced, likeable performances that manage to add at least a little depth of character to what could otherwise be little more than a goofball action-comedy (albeit an unusually funny and well-made one).  Franco is especially a revelation, proving to be a highly skilled comic actor after his mainly brooding appearances in the Spider-man films.  Saul's pajamas, unkempt hair, and perpetually vacant expression are amusing enough on their own, but Franco also recites his lines with a vapid, dope-addled cadence that perfectly fits Saul's utter cluelessness.  Franco's timing is surprisingly impeccable, with many of his best lines tossed off so casually it takes a second to even register that they're funny.  Rogen is his usual self--big, goofy, non-threatening--which makes the sight of him wielding as assault rifle and trying to negotiate his way through a gunfight all the more joyously incongruous.  The supporting performances help immensely as well, from Danny McBride's turn as a dim-witted, apparenty indestructible pot distributor to the great Gary Cole's combination of menace and smarm as the murderous kingpin Ted, to the always-strong work of regular Apatow contributors Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan as a pair of comically mismatched hitmen.  There's also the matter of the Asians' dialogue, which is accompanied by translations that would be hokey in the '70's and are even more transcendently ridiculous here.While it seemed that this movie didn't get quite as much attention as some previous Apatow/Rogen collaborations, I actually found it to be one of the best releases thus far from this group.  In an exceedingly rare move, I bought the DVD shortly after its release, and I'm pleased to say it gets even better on a second viewing.  It is something of a parody, especially in its last half-hour, but it still manages to function more than well enough as its own film.

There's an uneven tone in the film or it seems there are 2 or 3 movie genres running side by side with each trying to edge each other out.  It's Cheech & Chong meets Quentin Tarantino, meets Guy Ritchie, meets Sam Peckinpah, meets Sergio Leone, & meets Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out in typical Judd Apatow territory and then wanders in and out either drug induced humor to realistic to over-the-top, to cartoony violence. Some of the violence is very jarring because the movie lures the viewer into a set mood (comedic) one minute and all of a sudden, someone is blatantly shot in realistic fashion only to survive and go on to do extraordinary things. The cast itself is as varied as the film and everyone does a great job. Seth Rogen plays his typical Judd Apatow character. James Franco does a great job as the stoner pot dealer(Both Rogen and Franco were in Judd Apatow's much lauded tv series  FREAKS & GEEKS). The versatile and chameleon-like Gary Cole again plays a heavy (i.e A SIMPLE PLAN, OFFICE SPACE) alongside a ""missing-from-films-for-a-while"" Rosie Perez, Ed Begley Jr., Nora Dunne, MAD TV's Bobby Lee (and hey, he's not running around buck naked, but is a gun toting asian gangster!), Craig Robinson (tv's THE OFFICE), and Kevin Corrigan (GOODFELLAS, THE DEPARTED).  Overall, worth a viewing but be prepared to see a film that's all over the place with some laughs and some serious undertones.",3,Pineapple Express Loses Its Direction,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1484,"['PINEAPPLE', 'EXPRESS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'be', 'uneven', 'tone', 'film', 'are', '2', '3', 'movie', 'genres', 'running', 'side', 'side', 'trying', 'edge', 'other', 'out', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'meets', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'movie', 'out', 'typical', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'territory', 'then', 'wanders', 'either', 'drug', 'induced', 'humor', 'realistic', 'over-the-top', 'cartoony', 'violence', 'violence', 'very', 'jarring', 'movie', 'viewer', 'set', 'mood', 'comedic', 'one', 'minute', 'sudden', 'someone', 'blatantly', 'shot', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'only', 'survive', 'go', 'do', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'cast', 'as', 'varied', 'film', 'everyone', 'great', 'job', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'typical', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'character', 'James', 'Franco', 'great', 'job', 'stoner', 'pot', 'dealer', 'Rogen', 'Franco', 'were', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'much', 'lauded', 'tv', 'series', 'FREAKS', 'GEEKS', 'versatile', 'chameleon-like', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'again', 'heavy', 'i.e', 'SIMPLE', 'PLAN', 'OFFICE', 'SPACE', 'alongside', 'missing-from-films-for-a-while', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'Nora', 'Dunne', 'MAD', 'TV', 'Bobby', 'Lee', 'hey', 'not', 'running', 'around', 'buck', 'naked', 'gun', 'toting', 'asian', 'gangster', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'tv', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'GOODFELLAS', 'THE', 'DEPARTED', 'Overall', 'viewing', 'be', 'prepared', 'see', 'film', 'place', 'laughs', 'serious', 'undertones']",N/A
