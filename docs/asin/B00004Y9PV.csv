This cheap, corny series is not the worst Anime that I have seen, but it comes pretty close. Like Sailor Moon, Hyper Dolls has a similar plot line, bad jokes and poor animation quality. The ""plot"": Two girls get all powered up and beat up monsters threatening the city, *yawn*. Its like ""Legend of the Overfiend"" without the sex and graphic violence. ZZzzzzzz..Yes, it is better than Pokemon, but there are some really great Anime series out there (Outlaw Star, Cowboy Beebop) that make Hyperdolls look like the tired animated goop that it is.",2,Its better than Pokemon..,1019520000,"04 23, 2002",2002,618,"['Spriggan', 'Anime', 'Hyper', 'Doll', 'law', 'guess', 'cheap', 'corny', 'series', 'not', 'worst', 'Anime', 'have', 'seen', 'pretty', 'close', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Hyper', 'Dolls', 'similar', 'plot', 'line', 'bad', 'jokes', 'poor', 'animation', 'quality', 'plot', 'Two', 'girls', 'get', 'powered', 'up', 'beat', 'up', 'monsters', 'threatening', 'city', '*yawn*', 'Legend', 'Overfiend', 'sex', 'graphic', 'violence', 'ZZzzzzzz..Yes', 'better', 'Pokemon', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'Anime', 'series', 'there', 'Outlaw', 'Star', 'Cowboy', 'Beebop', 'make', 'Hyperdolls', 'look', 'tired', 'animated', 'goop']",N/A

Indeed, they can get so wound up in a face-off that they have to be interrupted to do their job; their boss appears usually in the device of some variety of pizza to rein them in.Their ""victim"" who knows who they are and cannot tell is a fairly typical boy with a delivery job who sits reading computer magazines in class and is saving for more memory. He get's angry with them when their machinations get him in trouble.I liked the modern setting; sky scrapers and water them park. Add to that the fireworks festival, and villians who despite being giant insects, jellyfish or earthworms were in their way too human.Too bad this is the only DVD of the HyperDolls.

Thankfully, it gets sent to video so people can really appreciate them. And now this type of anime finally gets on DVD, but I am afraid that Pioneer put about as much thought into it as the producers did. Mew and Mica are kinda like Sailor Moon (minus the skirts and add the skimpy outfits). They both argue and eat too much. The humor, when compared to Sailor Moon, is a bit dry, but I love watching the battle scenes. Now here is the big let-down about this DVD. The live-action version, which was included on the second subtitled VHS tape, isn't included. And extras are no where to be seen (not much to expect from a 2 episode series).

558769,A1AQ6NT5X4TMX1,B00004Y9PV,Matthew Lafrance,"[2, 3]","Another of Pioneer's budget DVDs, this one is worth every penny. Somewhat a parody of Dirty Pair, it's the story of Mew and Mica, two delinquent alien agents sent to protect earth, and the unfortunate boy who knows their secret. The writing is just great; Mew and Mica are the pinnacle of apathy and a great comic duo. The dubbing is exceptional and the subtitle good. Only two episodes of such quality material is a shame, but is the complete series as far as I know. My only gripe is the missing music videos and live action skits that graced the LDs and videos. I understand this was a budget DVD but the loss is felt.

In their off time they pose as high school students, and the only one who knows their true identity is their male classmate, Akai. Then there is Akai's old female friend, Shoko, who dosen't know their secret but is beginning to suspect something is strange about the two. As for why she and everyone eles can't tell just by looking at them...well, I guess it's just like Superman and most super hero stories inspired by it, where you just have to suspend your disbelief and accept that everyone is fooled by the hero's rather transparent disquiese.Also, the dolls don't want anyone eles finding out about their identity, so they make the threat to Akai: ""Don't tell anyone, or we'll twist your head off!"" I know that probably makes them seem less than heroic, but maybe the author decided he wanted his heroines to have a dark edge to them.The animation is fair (I've seen much worse-it's better than Poke'mon, at least,) the music score is good, (in the dubbed version, the opening song is also sung in english,) and both the English and Japanese voice actors do a great job of potraying the characters. However, the story kind of drops you off in the middle, and about the only back story you see are some brief imigaes that flash by during the opening song, where we see the hyperdolls coming down to earth.
