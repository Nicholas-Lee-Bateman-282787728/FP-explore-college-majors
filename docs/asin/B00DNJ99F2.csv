This DVD is produced by some journalists and not authorised by the band.It is a well produced documentary however that does include some fragments of original Allman Brothers songs and some footage of the Allman Brothers in the 1970s, including a show at The Fillmore.The use of effects on the images do annoy me, trying to look old and scratchy etc and using pops and scratches on Duane's voice from an interview is a bit silly.However I did enjoy this DVD as a history of Duane and the interviews from people who knew him are very interesting.This is worth getting if you want to know more about Duane Allman and Southern Rock in general.",4,Duane Allman DVD Doco,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,719,"['Duane', 'Allman', 'was', 'very', 'gifted', 'man', 'brother', 'Gregg', 'also', 'gifted', 'singer', 'DVD', 'produced', 'journalists', 'not', 'authorised', 'band.It', 'well', 'produced', 'documentary', 'however', 'include', 'fragments', 'original', 'Allman', 'Brothers', 'songs', 'footage', 'Allman', 'Brothers', '1970s', 'including', 'show', 'Fillmore.The', 'use', 'effects', 'images', 'do', 'annoy', 'trying', 'look', 'old', 'scratchy', 'etc', 'using', 'pops', 'scratches', 'Duane', 'voice', 'interview', 'bit', 'silly.However', 'did', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'history', 'Duane', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'are', 'very', 'interesting.This', 'worth', 'getting', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'Duane', 'Allman', 'Southern', 'Rock', 'general']","Allman, Duane - Song Of The South: Duane Allman And The Rise Of The Allman Brothers"

That was when the ABB was coming together. I Lived in Nashville, TN when they played at &#34;Teen Town&#34; as the Allman Joys. I knew that they were going to rock the world with their music, someday! This &#34;Un-Authorized&#34; DVD is a &#34;MUST-HAVE&#34; for every ABB Fan!  From the new young fan to the serious ABB fan, you're going to reminisce where you were when you first heard Duane play & when he died. I was in my car headed to Center Hill Lake, going fishing, when it came across WKDA, that Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. It made me sick. On the DVD, you'll see & hear Duane talk, give opinions, and best of all, play that &#34;Slide Guitar!&#34; If he had lived longer, there's no telling where he would be.

Good information about the start of his career and comments by former Hour Glass band musicians and producers was good but I wonder-=-why not any comments from the Allman Brothers band musicians?  Dickey Betts, Butch Trucks,and especially from his brother Greg.  Greg' book which came out last year tells a lot of his brother Duane and growing up with him.  I hope that another film comes out about Duane and includes memembers of the band-- I think it would be more beneficial.  Don't get me wrong-I love this film but it should have included the band interviews. and more concert shots.  Greg should play a bigger part in this film. I know the band did not give its approval of the film so another one is warranted---hope it will be made.
