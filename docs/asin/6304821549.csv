Kevin Kline had such a great year in 1997 with two vastly different performances, and while I prefer `The Ice Storm' as a film, there is no denying that his comedic timing and marvelous transformation in `In & Out' is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best performance of the two.  He really sunk into this character and added so many layers, so many ticks that just blossomed forth in such a delightful way.Kline plays Drama Teacher, Howard Brackett, who is bursting with pride as he watches a former student accept an Academy Award only to have his life spiral out of control when that student thanks him from the podium and, well, tells the world that Howard is gay.  This is news to Howard's fianc&eacute;e Emily and to, well, the whole town, including Howard himself who never thought he was gay but is now starting to question everything he thought he knew about himself.  The news obviously becomes media fodder, and a reporter named Peter Malloy comes to Howard's town to uncover the truth about his sexuality.I mirror the sentiments expressed by another reviewer who likened this to a Capra film.  The way in which the comedic aspects and the schmaltzy tones are regarded is beautiful because it never dips too heavily into the saccharine but remains feeling genuine and warming.  While it does have a message, it never beats you over the head with it and so it never feels overdone or insincere.  Kline is magnificent, as is Joan Cusack (when is she not?) and Tom Selleck sells his role rather easily.  All in all, this is a delightful little comedy that will bring a smile to your face.",5,I'm totally in with this one!,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,1853,"[""'m"", 'not', 'tell', 'worth', '32', 'seriously', 'Amazon', 'am', 'going', 'tell', 'well', '4', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'rent', 'anywhere', 'even', 'site', 'highly', 'recommend', 'do', 'so', 'soon', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'already', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'year', '1997', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'performances', 'prefer', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'film', 'denying', 'comedic', 'timing', 'marvelous', 'transformation', 'Out', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'best', 'performance', 'two', 'really', 'sunk', 'character', 'added', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'so', 'many', 'ticks', 'just', 'blossomed', 'forth', 'such', 'delightful', 'way.Kline', 'plays', 'Drama', 'Teacher', 'Howard', 'Brackett', 'who', 'bursting', 'pride', 'former', 'student', 'accept', 'Academy', 'Award', 'only', 'have', 'life', 'spiral', 'control', 'when', 'student', 'podium', 'well', 'world', 'Howard', 'gay', 'news', 'Howard', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Emily', 'well', 'whole', 'town', 'including', 'Howard', 'who', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'gay', 'now', 'starting', 'question', 'everything', 'thought', 'knew', 'news', 'obviously', 'media', 'fodder', 'reporter', 'named', 'Peter', 'Malloy', 'Howard', 'town', 'uncover', 'truth', 'sexuality.I', 'mirror', 'sentiments', 'expressed', 'reviewer', 'who', 'likened', 'Capra', 'film', 'way', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'schmaltzy', 'tones', 'are', 'regarded', 'beautiful', 'never', 'too', 'heavily', 'saccharine', 'feeling', 'genuine', 'warming', 'have', 'message', 'never', 'head', 'never', 'overdone', 'insincere', 'Kline', 'magnificent', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'when', 'not', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'role', 'rather', 'easily', 'delightful', 'little', 'comedy', 'will', 'bring', 'smile', 'face']",N/A

436692,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6304821549,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Director Frank Oz's IN & OUT (1997) is a charming little film with a few good laughs. In a story inspired by Tom Hanks' Oscar acceptance speech forPHILADELPHIA(1993), Kevin Kline plays Howard Brackett, a prissy-mannered, Streisand-loving high school English teacher. His class doesn't care about Shakespeare sonnets; they only wants to hear stories from Howard about former student Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), now a young star in Hollywood who's up for an Oscar.On awards night, Cameron wins a Best Actor Oscar for playing a gay soldier. The last person he thanks is his old English teacher, Mr. Brackett, who Cameron claims is gay! This revelation from the actor shocks everyone in town, especially Brackett, who's shortly due to marry fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), She's waited three years for this and now Emily isn't sure Howard is straight. He insists he is.One comedic highlight has Howard listening to a cassette tape that extols the listener to explore his masculinity. It's like the guy on the tape can see every little fey thing Howard does. When a Diana Ross cover of ""I Will Survive"" starts to play, Howard, with the encouragement of the taped voice, tries to resist dancing but fails. This is when he finally admits to himself that he'll never be a manly man.Tom Selleck (sans mustache) is Peter Malloy, reporter for a TV show similar to Entertainment Tonight. Peter's in town covering the big story of the outed schoolteacher, and he stays long after other newsfolk have moved on. Eventually Malloy admits to Brackett that he's gay and that he came out to all his friends and family. Then, right on a street intersection, Peter plants a big kiss on Howard.Meanwhile, In Hollywood Cameron Drake sees the TV reports about the damage he's caused his ex-teacher, so he heads out to his old home town to try to fix things.At the wedding, when the minister asks Howard if he'll take Emily in Holy Matrimony, instead of answering ""I do,"" he says: ""I'm gay."" The day is ruined, everyone in church appalled, Emily embarrassed and heartbroken. Now she's thinking of regaining the 75 lbs. she lost for Howard's sake. Howard gets fired and his life seems over.Cameron almost hits with his car a very drunk Emily, who's staggering around at night after some hard drinking in a local bar. Cameron consoles her and you can see that they've instantly become more than teacher and former student.The story's climax occurs at high school graduation ceremonies. The school's principal (Bob Newhart) is confronted by Cameron for having firing Howard. One by one, students stand up and declare that they're gay. So do Howard's dad (Wilford Brimley) and mom {Debbie Reynolds) and practically everyone in town. It's a triumph for tolerance and acceptance.Despite the way I've synopsized this, the movie is really entertaining and worth seeing. It gave me the ""sillies"" more than once.",4,"Howard Brackett: ""I just came out!

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Keep in mind that you HAVE to disregard the first 15 minutes which is basically nothing but total pointlessness concerning no storyline, plot development, characterization, or anything of that nature.  It's *really* bad.This may be the first time I've ever seen a storyline change *dramatically* in a matter of one simple second!!  While a man is giving a speech at an awards show, he either jokingly or seriously (never really COULD tell) says that a teacher back in a small town was a homosexual.  Now what's interesting is that the teacher was watching this awards show with his wife at home on the couch while this speech was occurring, and RIGHT when the man giving the speech said this questionable line, the guy and his wife froze starry-eyed at the television screen, LOL!  That was definitely the highlight moment of the entire film.  The man was worried the entire town would believe the speech and have a problem with it... even though it wasn't even true and the man is perfectly straight.  At least at *this* point it's not true.The humor doesn't end there either.  Another memorable moment occurs when at the high school gym the students feel uncomfortable changing their clothes around the teacher given the information that he likes men so they come up with excuses that are by no means believable to try and cover up the fact they're uncomfortable being around the guy.  Keep in mind this is mainly a comedy film with brief moments of drama.  The next moment when the principal in his office room makes excuses because he wants the teacher fired is another hilarious and excellent moment of storytelling.  The principal wanted to make sure the line at the awards show concerning the mans sexual preference was just a joke and not remotely true but... the principal kept tripping over his words and stuttering because he didn't want to say how he *really* felt.The BEST moment however, is when the teacher gets fed up with the entire town jumping on his case over the possibility of him preferring men, so the teacher decides to build his masculinity by way of listening to a tape on his stereo.  The man on the tape is *hilarious*.  He basically attempts to turn men straight by insulting and humiliating them.  He insults the teacher and everything happens to fall in line and make it appear like he really IS a homosexual.  Very funny stuff.It gets even better later on when the teacher believes he is a homosexual, and this results in a crashed wedding and several other incidents involving his wife that I'd rather not spoil.  Very good writing overall.My only complaint is that not *everything* works.  This seems to be because In & Out is a comedy and the moments of sincerity feel tacked on and insignificant.  Plus, you know, the first 15 minutes that I mention above just stinks!

436697,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,6304821549,Chris Fung,"[4, 11]","This is a hard movie to review because I really wanted to like the message, but ultimately had to settle for disliking the messenger. I am a fairly progressive pro-gay rights person, and was looking forward to a smart, liberating and interesting comedy about being gay. But the screenplay for this movie was so hamfisted that only the considerable acting talents of Kevin Kline (to some extent, but not nearly as much as some people think) and Tom Selleck saved it from one star territory. Joan Cusack has certainly done good work -some much better than this (see for example ""Cradle Will Rock"") but she did not deserve the best supporting actress nomination for this trite example of one-dimensional hysteria.I did enjoy some of the Barbra jokes (note the spelling please) and the parody of the ""de-programming"" audio course on how to realize your inner heterosexual was initially quite funny but like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch, it just went on and on and on until gradually I lost any sympathy I might have had for the characters or the plotline. I'm still waiting for the cinematic setting that does true justice to ""Macho Man"" by the way, -it certainly wasn't the ending scene in this movie.The fact that people fell all over themselves to praise this lame Hollywood attempt at commercial PC comedy just goes to show that cinematic liberation will not be achieved by suited corporate drones with degrees in communication and an eye on the bottom line.I'm not an activist (although if going on a few Pride Marches and AIDS walks count me as bound for the Pit, then I guess I'm on my way) and I'm not very familiar with the intimate details of the lives of lots of gay people, but I have a fairly good cross section of gay friends, co-workers and acquaintances and I can't say this movie was even one tenth as funny, pointed or perceptive as the real gay people I know.The ideas in this movie were expressed much more effectively (at least to me) by more skillful and imaginative gay-positive movies such as ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"", ""The Naked Civil Servant"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The Full Monty"", and even (god help us) ""To Wong Foo With Love"".  The fact that the first four are NOT US movies is not a coincidence.  Treating gay people as if they were defined by their personhood and not their sexuality seems to me to be a much more satisfying route than going on (and on and on) about whether someone likes to dance or how they walk or how they use their hands.Ultimately the real scandal in this movie, in my opinion, was not its treatment of gay people, but rather the way it depicted a hero who could afford to decorate his own home in such ""Town and Country Living""-style opulence on a small-town public school English teacher's salary.",3,"good message, dumb messenger",1038787200,"12 2, 2002",2002,2770,"['hard', 'movie', 'review', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'message', 'ultimately', 'had', 'settle', 'disliking', 'messenger', 'am', 'fairly', 'progressive', 'pro-gay', 'rights', 'person', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'smart', 'liberating', 'interesting', 'comedy', 'being', 'gay', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'hamfisted', 'only', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talents', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'extent', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'think', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'saved', 'one', 'star', 'territory', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'certainly', 'done', 'good', 'work', '-some', 'much', 'better', 'see', 'example', 'Cradle', 'Will', 'Rock', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'nomination', 'trite', 'example', 'one-dimensional', 'hysteria.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Barbra', 'jokes', 'note', 'spelling', 'please', 'parody', 'de-programming', 'audio', 'course', 'how', 'realize', 'inner', 'heterosexual', 'was', 'initially', 'quite', 'funny', 'bad', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketch', 'just', 'went', 'gradually', 'lost', 'sympathy', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'characters', 'plotline', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'cinematic', 'setting', 'true', 'justice', 'Macho', 'Man', 'way', '-it', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'ending', 'scene', 'movie.The', 'fact', 'people', 'fell', 'praise', 'lame', 'Hollywood', 'attempt', 'commercial', 'PC', 'comedy', 'just', 'show', 'cinematic', 'liberation', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'achieved', 'suited', 'corporate', 'drones', 'degrees', 'communication', 'eye', 'bottom', 'line.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'activist', 'going', 'few', 'Pride', 'Marches', 'AIDS', 'walks', 'count', 'bound', 'Pit', 'then', 'guess', ""'m"", 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'intimate', 'details', 'lives', 'lots', 'gay', 'people', 'have', 'fairly', 'good', 'cross', 'section', 'gay', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'acquaintances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'one', 'tenth', 'funny', 'pointed', 'perceptive', 'real', 'gay', 'people', 'know.The', 'ideas', 'movie', 'were', 'expressed', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'least', 'more', 'skillful', 'imaginative', 'gay-positive', 'movies', 'such', 'Priscilla', 'Queen', 'Desert', 'Naked', 'Civil', 'Servant', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Full', 'Monty', 'even', 'god', 'help', 'Wong', 'Foo', 'Love', 'fact', 'first', 'four', 'are', 'NOT', 'US', 'movies', 'not', 'coincidence', 'Treating', 'gay', 'people', 'were', 'defined', 'personhood', 'not', 'sexuality', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'route', 'going', 'someone', 'likes', 'dance', 'how', 'walk', 'how', 'use', 'hands.Ultimately', 'real', 'scandal', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'treatment', 'gay', 'people', 'rather', 'way', 'depicted', 'hero', 'who', 'could', 'afford', 'decorate', 'own', 'home', 'such', 'Town', 'Country', 'Living', '-style', 'opulence', 'small-town', 'public', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'salary']",N/A

He was gay according to the student, but not according to himself and all who knew him. He was also to get married to his colleague Ms Montgomery (Joan Cusack) within a week! What followed was denial, confusion and search for his own inclination, with the help of a national TV host (Tom Selleck).Kevin Kline was consistently good and one of the best scenes was when he tested himself by playing a tape ""exploring one's masculinity"" at home. He failed in almost all the tests given by the deep bass voice on the tape, none more so with the dancing test. He simply could not refrain from responding to the rhythm, music and pleasure. His dance sequence was analogous to the one by Hugh Grant in Love Actually. Only that Kevin Kline moved like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance!Even though the second half of the story conformed to the usual Hollywood formula, the gay man stereotyped and the u-turn of the townsfolk response not quite convincing, the movie was very watchable as a whole.

NOT because it's a gay movie, but because i really like Kevin Kline.The detractors say it's a propaganda film.  How is showing a movie where a gay person is a GOOD person propaganda?  Is the Cosby Show black propaganda, because they show a happy, rich black family?  Seriously.  Don't you right-wing nuts have an abortion doctor to kill or something?Ok, now on the the movie itself.  Kevin Kline did a fairly good job in the movie, as did Newhart and Debbie Reynolds.  But to me, the actor who stole the show was Joan Cusack.  She was very funny in this role, and that made it watchable.  Also, the small town setting & locations were warm and inviting.But the movie certainly had some problems.  With the exception of the supporting cast, the comedy (particularly what they gave Kevin Kline to work with) was pretty weak.  It was predictable, easy, old, hacky, and really just played upon the most BASIC stereotypes of gay people.  I was offended.  But not because of the stereotypes.  I was offended comedically because of the lack of clever writing.  Yes, yes, we all know many gay people like Streisand, dancing, snappy dressing, and the arts.  It's tired.  This might have been funny to me 20 or 30 years ago.  But now?  Uggghhh....  Somehow, they gave Cusack all the best comedy.  She played the perfect comedic foil for Kline, as she was so fragile, so lacking in self-esteem, and constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

I haven't seen a movie that kept me laughing so much in a very long time.  Kevin Kline plays a English lit professor who, as I mentioned, get's outed by his former student while accepting an oscar for playing a gay charactor and so in the heat of the moment decided to dedicate the award to his professor ""and he's gay"" and at that point...hilarity ensues.  You see, Kevin Kline is engaged to Emily (Joan Cusack in a scene stealing performance) and they are due to be married in just two days...so in those two days he needs to figure out if he's really gay.  One surprising thing was Tom Sellick who doesn't even look the same without his mustache (he actually is much better looking and should keep it off)  Tom plays a reporter who's intent on getting Kevin to out himself, admitt to himself that he is really gay, and all the while poor Emily isn't sure if there is even going to be a wedding.  The movie is great from start to finish and it does touch on some deeper subjects along the line of gay tollerance and acceptance in our society.  When Kamden outs his professor you get irritated when the priciple (played perfectly by Bob Newhart!!!) warns him that if he doesn't get married he'll lose his job.  It's sad to see the way our society will treat something they don't agree with.

Finding out that it was written by Paul Rudnick, the writer of ""Marci X"" and ""The Stepford Wives"", and directed by Frank Oz. the director of ""The Stepford Wives."" They work so well together. The only reason why I could only give this movie four stars is because of the last scene. It was too long, and I have seen that kind of scene before. They could have changed that part a little. The best scenes of the movie come from the middle, while Kevin Kline character is becoming confused about his life.Kline plays Howard Brackett, a high school teacher that loves his job. ""It's my life,"" he replies sometime during the movie. He is just days away from marrying another teacher Emily Montgomery, and he just found out that a former student of his named Cameron Drake was nominated for an Oscar for his preformance in ""To Serve and Protect"" in which he playsa gay solider. On the night where he wins, during his acceptance speech, he says that he was influenced by Howard because he's gay. That leaves Howard, Emily, and his parents Berniece and Frank, at a halt. None of them knew that Howard was gay, and Howard continues to deny it. The press gets involved when Peter Malloy, a gay newsreporter, decides to find out the truth about Howard. As his wedding day comes closer, and Howard continues to be a manly man, and prove to himself and everybody else that he's not gay, while also getting confused about his life.I like how the filmmakers handle being gay. There are some sterotypes throughout the movie, such as the gay characters moving their hands in a certain way while they talk, or just some of the dialog. Kevin Kline handles the physical comedy well, and the entire movie works because of him. Joan Cusack is hilarious as usual, but she can overact at times. Matt Dillon had a nice small part as Cameron Drake, and it is good that he is playing an actor who is not conceited, and always thinking about himself.

This movie has its heart in the right place, has a perfect script, is acted with passionate commitment and looks beautiful throughout.I love the way that gay and straight stereotypes are playfully tossed around. Selleck is wonderful, Klein shines and Joan Cusack clearly deserved to win, but must be happy with her nomination in the Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She won in the same category in the American Comedy Awards.My favourite scene is where Howard struggles through a ""self-help"" audio tape session on How To Improve Your Masculinity. I have been kissed with the same earth shattering intensity as Howard Brackett (Klein) is kissed by Peter Malloy (Selleck) - and it's no surprise that Howard knew then and there that he must be gay. There are lots of great potential quotes, but Debbie Reynolds as Howard's loving and devoted Mum delivers some of the best - including ""Who wouldn't want a wedding?""I own the Australian Village Roadshow DVD (region 4) and from what I've read in the product descriptions and comments on Amazon USA and UK, this seems to be the only version which includes genuine extras, and the vignette interview statements from the actors, the writer and the director are all gems.This DVD was made very early in the history of the format - and it is limited in video quality through being a single layer DVD-5 - however it is genuine 16:9 widescreen (no letterboxing), looks great when ""upscaled"" to 1080p, and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very well crafted. The quality of the film which they used for this mastering was very good - but you can easily see evidence of dirt etc, which would not be visible if the film were to be professionally restored and remastered for a Blu-ray release - and I believe that this movie fully justifies the effort and expense from Paramount to make this happen.

Many people just assumed he was gay even though he was quite a lady's man.  He had a bathrobe that was a little too large for  him and he offered it to a guy in the dorm who was a little larger than he.  The bigger guy had apparently reacted negatively (I didn't witness this).  The two had been getting along well the big guy had even been a guest in  our room for small social gatherings.  Things cooled down quickly after  that.  It is a little amusing how people with no animosity towards gays can  be a little uneasy in the presence of people whom they suspect may be gay.  Every one in the film realized that the main character, a high school  teacher, was effeminate and accepted him.  However, when rumor was out that  he was gay, everyone became less at ease and formed a concerted effort to  make him appear more masculine.  This included such subtle things as hand  gestures and tone of voice.  Meanwhile, a male television reporter played  by Tom Selleck, who was not effeminate, had &quot;come out of the  closet&quot; and suggested that the teacher do the same.

Stop taking things so seriously, I can watch a movie that stereotypes white people and one that has racial slurs against white people and laugh my head off, because there only joking! That is all this movie is doing. It's taking an akward situation and turned into a laugh out loud comedy! Anyway, the story is about a Hollywood heartthrob ""outs"" his small-town high-school drama teacher Howard Brackett during the Oscar telecast, the entire town of Greenleaf, Indiana, wonders if Howard's really gay. The result is a film that delivers constant laughs and a golden opportunity for its fine cast to show off their considerable comedic talents.

Red,"[7, 10]","I quite enjoyed watching this film, which is why I give it four stars, even though I think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic. So, why did I like it? Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Kevin Kline (in that order) and also a passably funny script -- at least one that is well structured for a feel-good viewing experience.Joan Cusack is wonderful here. Her blow-up at her wayward fiance after he stands her up  is fantastic, and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street, screaming ""Is this the Twilight Zone?"" at which point she collapses on the hood of Matt Dillon's car (in her wedding dress no less) -- well, that scene is adorable, especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet -- a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity. Yes, here is the heart of the film (so I cannot comprehend another viewer's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film; she's obviously going to marry the movie star, and get to eat cheetos into the bargain). Matt Dillon is, as ever, the essence of cuteness, and a much more desirable husband than Kevin -- um, I mean Howard.Kevin Kline does a decent job of mimicking Howard, a repressed gay man. But it still feels like mimicking, rather than acting. Here is also where the problems begin. I guess wearing a bow-tie means you are gay. And, similarly, the Barbra Streisand gag is beaten to death (and beyond). How many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like Barbra??!! Come on! Also, Kline's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture . . . Not only is it not enough; it's really kind of humiliating.Nonetheless, the final scene does give ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" a run for its money, and I can't deny it: I did really have fun watching this movie. It's basically a sound little production, well structured, reasonably well written, and Kevin Kline can dance.",4,KK Can Dance,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,1956,"['quite', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'why', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'even', 'think', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'seriously', 'problematic', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'order', 'also', 'passably', 'funny', 'script', 'least', 'one', 'well', 'structured', 'feel-good', 'viewing', 'experience.Joan', 'Cusack', 'wonderful', 'here', 'blow-up', 'wayward', 'fiance', 'up', 'fantastic', 'scene', 'where', 'bar', 'out', 'street', 'screaming', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'point', 'hood', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'car', 'wedding', 'dress', 'no', 'less', 'well', 'scene', 'adorable', 'especially', 'considering', 'truly', 'touching', 'readings', 'Shakespeare', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'play', 'competing', 'definitions', 'masculinity', 'Yes', 'here', 'heart', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'viewer', 'criticism', 'bride', 'given', 'nothing', 'film', 'obviously', 'going', 'marry', 'movie', 'star', 'get', 'eat', 'cheetos', 'bargain', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'ever', 'essence', 'cuteness', 'much', 'more', 'desirable', 'husband', 'Kevin', 'um', 'mean', 'Howard.Kevin', 'Kline', 'decent', 'job', 'mimicking', 'Howard', 'repressed', 'gay', 'man', 'still', 'mimicking', 'rather', 'acting', 'Here', 'also', 'where', 'problems', 'begin', 'guess', 'wearing', 'bow-tie', 'means', 'are', 'gay', 'similarly', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'gag', 'beaten', 'death', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'viewers', 'tolerate', 'being', 'told', 'gay', 'men', 'Barbra', 'Come', 'Also', 'Kline', 'attempt', 'appear', 'gay', 'simply', 'giving', 'limp', 'hand', 'gesture', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'kind', 'humiliating.Nonetheless', 'final', 'scene', 'give', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'run', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'did', 'really', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'basically', 'sound', 'little', 'production', 'well', 'structured', 'reasonably', 'well', 'written', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'can', 'dance']",N/A
