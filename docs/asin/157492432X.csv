Jimenez ""Veritas""","[2, 2]","It would appear as if many who rate this movie poorly are doing so because of how it differs from the book rather than judging the movie on it's own merits. I saw this movie, loved it and own it on DVD. The acting is great and the movie is very entertaining. It is really regrettable how so many people refuse to accept that movies and books are different media. My advice is buy this movie, you'll love it. For those who have already read the book and expect a movie version of the book you should accept that this movie is not it and get over it.",5,It's a movie NOT a book,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,548,"['would', 'appear', 'many', 'who', 'rate', 'movie', 'poorly', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'how', 'book', 'rather', 'judging', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'saw', 'movie', 'loved', 'own', 'DVD', 'acting', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'really', 'regrettable', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'refuse', 'accept', 'movies', 'books', 'are', 'different', 'media', 'advice', 'buy', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'love', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'book', 'expect', 'movie', 'version', 'book', 'should', 'accept', 'movie', 'not', 'get']",Rose Hill VHS

191174,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,157492432X,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[8, 10]","Before Jennifer Garner struck it big with, and developed her own fervent fanbase, as Sydney Bristow on ALIAS on ABC. And before she wowed audiences as Elektra in the original DAREDEVIL (surely she was the only redeeming feature of that movie) she was eking out a living as an actress in a variety of tv movies and b-pictures. One such movie was Hallmark's production of ""Rose Hill"" (based on Julie Garwood's best-selling ""For the Roses"") in which Garner plays Mary Rose. Mary Rose is a woman raised by a group of homeless boys. The boys decide to leave the slums and drab life as pickpockets on the streets of New York City to become cowhands on the plains of Texas (though one does enjoy a brief career as a Texas Ranger). Finally they become landholders of the Rose Hill Ranch on the rich grasslands of Montana where they raise cattle and try to make something of themselves - that is until tragedy strikes.I have not read the book on which this movie is based, so I cannot comment on how good a job it does translating the text for the screen (judging by other reviewers comments not a very good one). But what this movie may lack in faithfulness to its source material it no doubt makes up for in down-home charm.I'm not a big fan of westerns (I can probably count the number I like on two hands) so I was not holding out much hope for what this movie might offer (my shameless interest was the presence of Garner). But I found myself becoming both charmed and involved by the human family drama that is the underlying theme behind this movie.As TV movies go this is passable entertainment, but those expecting Garner to kick around baddies as she does in ALIAS and DAREDEVIL will no doubt be disappointed.",3,Early Jennifer Garner work has heart,1099872000,"11 8, 2004",2004,1710,"['Jennifer', 'Garner', 'struck', 'big', 'developed', 'own', 'fervent', 'fanbase', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'ALIAS', 'ABC', 'wowed', 'audiences', 'Elektra', 'original', 'DAREDEVIL', 'surely', 'was', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'movie', 'was', 'eking', 'out', 'living', 'actress', 'variety', 'tv', 'movies', 'b-pictures', 'One', 'such', 'movie', 'was', 'Hallmark', 'production', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'based', 'Julie', 'Garwood', 'best-selling', 'Roses', 'Garner', 'Mary', 'Rose', 'Mary', 'Rose', 'woman', 'raised', 'group', 'homeless', 'boys', 'boys', 'decide', 'leave', 'slums', 'drab', 'life', 'pickpockets', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'become', 'cowhands', 'plains', 'Texas', 'one', 'enjoy', 'brief', 'career', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Finally', 'become', 'landholders', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'Ranch', 'rich', 'grasslands', 'Montana', 'where', 'raise', 'cattle', 'try', 'make', 'something', 'tragedy', 'strikes.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'how', 'good', 'job', 'translating', 'text', 'screen', 'judging', 'other', 'reviewers', 'comments', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'what', 'movie', 'may', 'lack', 'faithfulness', 'source', 'material', 'doubt', 'up', 'down-home', 'charm.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'westerns', 'can', 'probably', 'count', 'number', 'like', 'two', 'hands', 'was', 'not', 'holding', 'out', 'much', 'hope', 'what', 'movie', 'might', 'offer', 'shameless', 'interest', 'was', 'presence', 'Garner', 'found', 'becoming', 'charmed', 'involved', 'human', 'family', 'drama', 'underlying', 'theme', 'movie.As', 'TV', 'movies', 'go', 'passable', 'entertainment', 'expecting', 'Garner', 'kick', 'around', 'baddies', 'ALIAS', 'DAREDEVIL', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'disappointed']",Rose Hill VHS

Good thing I prepared myself, because this adaptation is almost nothing like the book, except that it emphasizes the family relationship of Mary Rose and her unconventional brothers (which was my favorite part of the book anyway).

191178,A3JILVXOQD1JI1,157492432X,"M. Han ""fsgirl""","[0, 0]","When I saw the movie Rose Hill was an adaptation of one of my favorite author's book, I was very excited to watch it.  I should have skipped it.  The only thing they got right was the make up of the family.  Two of the main characters from the book are killed off in the movie but Julie actually wrote separate stories for them.  It has been a while since I read the book but who the heck is Fergus.  I don't remember him from the book but the movie implies that he ends up with Mary Rose.  Look, I understand that when a book is adapted into a movie there will be some artistic license taken, such as the deletion of minor characters or the addition of others; but when you totally change the main characters and what happens to them, you are not taking artistic license, you are telling a story that is totally different from the original.  Give me a break.  The people who made Rose Hill need to talk to the people who adapted the John Grisham books into movies.  I watched some of those movies before reading the books and vice versa and although artistic license was taken, the movies pretty much stayed true to the books.  I don't know how Julie Garwood could have put her name on this movie because it was no where near the wonderful story she wrote.  Didn't she read the screenplay before she agreed to this movie.  I hope, if she agrees to have another one of her books adapted into a movie, she ensures that the movie comes somewhere close to resembling the book in someway or form, such has having the main characters who are suppose be alive stay alive and having them marry characters that were actually in the books.",1,HOW COULD JULIE LET THEM DO THIS TO HER WONDERFUL BOOK!!!!!,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1630,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'was', 'adaptation', 'one', 'favorite', 'author', 'book', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'watch', 'should', 'have', 'skipped', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'right', 'was', 'make', 'up', 'family', 'Two', 'main', 'characters', 'book', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'movie', 'Julie', 'actually', 'wrote', 'separate', 'stories', 'been', 'while', 'read', 'book', 'who', 'heck', 'Fergus', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'book', 'movie', 'up', 'Mary', 'Rose', 'Look', 'understand', 'when', 'book', 'adapted', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'such', 'deletion', 'minor', 'characters', 'addition', 'others', 'when', 'totally', 'change', 'main', 'characters', 'what', 'are', 'not', 'taking', 'artistic', 'license', 'are', 'telling', 'story', 'totally', 'different', 'original', 'Give', 'break', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'need', 'talk', 'people', 'who', 'adapted', 'John', 'Grisham', 'books', 'movies', 'watched', 'movies', 'reading', 'books', 'vice', 'versa', 'artistic', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'movies', 'pretty', 'much', 'stayed', 'true', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Julie', 'Garwood', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'name', 'movie', 'was', 'where', 'wonderful', 'story', 'wrote', 'Did', ""n't"", 'read', 'screenplay', 'agreed', 'movie', 'hope', 'have', 'one', 'books', 'adapted', 'movie', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'close', 'resembling', 'book', 'someway', 'form', 'such', 'having', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'alive', 'stay', 'alive', 'having', 'marry', 'characters', 'were', 'actually', 'books']",Rose Hill VHS

The story of their journeys, the hardships of life in the west - issues of money, land, racism - all of that wrapped up in a drama.  I love this film and urge everyone to give it a shot.

I did not really pay much attention to that because I was expecting changes. This happens to everything that comes from a book onto the screen. However I have to say that it was really not well done. It did not deserve any relation with the book 'For the roses' at all because they changed even the most basic story line in the book. SPOILER ***** Mary Rose and Harrison are now brother and sister ***** I can live with many things, including stretching the proloque further then the book, adding a couple of characters and omitting some, because not everything that works in a book could work in a movie, but the story is between Mary Rose and Harrison, their funny interatction on the ranch and then in England, it is the core. They did not even though that, invented a complete new love interst. Another main thing in the book, the loyalty of her adopeted family to each other, is not really portrayed at all.To sum it up, it is not worth to buy it. Even if you do not consider the book at all, the movie seems to be missing something.
