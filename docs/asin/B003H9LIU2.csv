They are faster paced and hold my attention. If you liked the books or remember seeing the show when it originally aired then purchase the collection. It's a great value.,5,2nd season the is the best!,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,308,"['first', '2', 'hour', 'special', 'very', 'good', 'other', '2', 'hour', 'specials', 'seem', 'drag', 'second', 'season', 'shows', 'are', '47', 'minutes', 'long', 'are', 'faster', 'paced', 'hold', 'attention', 'liked', 'books', 'remember', 'seeing', 'show', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'then', 'purchase', 'collection', 'great', 'value']",N/A

Duggan ""IT Specialist""","[10, 10]","The advancement of civilization, the prevalence of computers in daily life, and the age old corruption in the hearts of men and women is present in this series. Drugs, political corruption, evil, greed, murder, etc, are taken to the next level when rebels, criminals, and society clash. One former cop, Greg Evigan, goes to prison for crossing the line is now is searching for his wife and son who are now involved in hight society. His wife is actually married to a man who helped put him in prison. The stories are written by William Shatner (Star Trek) and prove he's more than just a pretty face and an actor. I can highly recommend this series for anyone who enjoys SciFi and futuristic views of civilization both good and bad. I wonder if society is really as stupid as these kinds of stories suggest. We learn nothing from our mistakes, make bigger ones in the future, and seem to be determined to destroy our planet and us with it.",4,Surprisingly Intelligent,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,939,"['advancement', 'civilization', 'prevalence', 'computers', 'daily', 'life', 'age', 'old', 'corruption', 'hearts', 'men', 'women', 'present', 'series', 'Drugs', 'political', 'corruption', 'evil', 'greed', 'murder', 'etc', 'are', 'taken', 'next', 'level', 'when', 'rebels', 'criminals', 'society', 'clash', 'One', 'former', 'cop', 'Greg', 'Evigan', 'prison', 'crossing', 'line', 'now', 'searching', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'involved', 'hight', 'society', 'wife', 'actually', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'put', 'prison', 'stories', 'are', 'written', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Star', 'Trek', 'prove', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'actor', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'SciFi', 'futuristic', 'views', 'civilization', 'good', 'bad', 'wonder', 'society', 'really', 'as', 'stupid', 'kinds', 'stories', 'suggest', 'learn', 'nothing', 'mistakes', 'make', 'bigger', 'ones', 'future', 'seem', 'be', 'determined', 'destroy', 'planet']",N/A

The show was part of the package called the Action Pack way back during the 90's when syndication would have new shows.This show is based on a series of books written by William Shatner. It is  surprisingly good entertainment. Greg Evrigan does a credible job as the lead actor. The sets and situations are well done. The price at under $15 is perfect for the fans and newcomers to invest in the show and enjoy the sc fi series.,4,Good show!,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,511,"['set', '4', 'tv', 'movies', 'preceeded', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'show', 'was', 'part', 'package', 'called', 'Action', 'Pack', 'way', 'back', '90', 'when', 'syndication', 'would', 'have', 'new', 'shows.This', 'show', 'based', 'series', 'books', 'written', 'William', 'Shatner', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'entertainment', 'Greg', 'Evrigan', 'credible', 'job', 'lead', 'actor', 'sets', 'situations', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'price', '15', 'perfect', 'fans', 'newcomers', 'invest', 'show', 'enjoy', 'sc', 'fi', 'series']",N/A
