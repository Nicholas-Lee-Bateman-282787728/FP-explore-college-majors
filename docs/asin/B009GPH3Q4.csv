Their movies are not just about the characters but also about the city - mostly New York and its vibrancy. While Allen has recently flirted with Europe, Lee remains a faithful New Yorker and returns to his Brooklyn roots with Red Hook Summer.Red Hook Summer abounds with  characters, their observations through dialogues, often include monologues which help Spike Lee create a very watchable film but with limitations.Flik (Jules Brown) is  a 13 year old teenager whose mother, Colleen (De'Adre Aziza), brings him from Atlanta to New York to spend a summer with Bishop Enoch (Clarke Peters), the grandfather with whom both Flik and his mother are estranged from.Enoch is a hardcore Baptist preacher who runs a little church facing financial trouble known as Lil' Piece of heaven and is hellbent on teaching Flik the importance of God- Jesus. Flik reluctantly tags his grandfather everywhere that he goes, with his Ipad and finds fascinations in the rants of alcoholic stock market proponent Deacon Zee ( Thomas Jefferson Byrd) - funny character. and make friends with a loud mouth yet lively Chazz ( Toni Lysaith)Flik is in the projects and he wonders about their differences and these many characters are what make Red Hook watchable. Most of the scenes are shot in the church where Pastor Enoch waxes  and rants eloquently  about gentrification, education and the worsening state of popular culture.

I finally got around to seeing it just now and on the small budget he had, this was a very fine film!  When the pre-hype for the film started, I said to myself ""this is not the Spike Lee Joint I was expecting!""  However, after seeing the film, it was nicely done, shot in digital HD which in this case, helps with the film's aesthetics.This film tackles many African-Americans unwavering belief in the Christianity forced on them during slavery and how many give up hope, work or struggle for their 'trust in god.'  It also explore the hypocrisy in the Christian church such as lying, eating pork and child molestation.  All were properly explored and nothing was overdone.  You also have your trials and tribulations of living in the hood as well.This film seems award worthy as it is a dialog driven film.

1596339,A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B009GPH3Q4,Marcel Lee,"[0, 0]","This is an epilogue to Do The Right Thing, a movie many people consider Spike Lee's magnum opus, only in the sense that he uses it to reprise his role as Mookie. It's a brief cameo feature but a touch of nostalgia nonetheless. Both movies focus on black people in the city of Brooklyn. I just happen to like this one a little more.The acting on the part of the two child stars is surprisingly amateurish, especially the girl's; her voice inflections are consistently wrong; but Red Hook Summer, as desultory as its plot may be, is never boring. That has mostly to do with the boy's grandfather, a Bible-gripping bishop who preaches the gospel even when he's not preaching.He's determined to introduce his grandson to ""God"". And even if his cultic sermons fall on deaf ears, the church song performances he leads are enjoyable. The non-diegetic music, which plays even during scenes it shouldn't play during; Spike Lee appears at the end wearing a ""No Music"" shirt, oddly enough; sounds good too.There's a major plot twist in this movie; a sudden character reveal near the level of the one in The Sixth Sense. The way it happens is, like the riot scene in Do The Right Thing, overdramatic and even a bit silly, but it sets the tone for an ending that, whether you feel compassionate for the protagonist or not, is somber and moving.marcellee.com",3,3 of 5,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,1344,"['epilogue', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'consider', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'magnum', 'opus', 'only', 'sense', 'reprise', 'role', 'Mookie', 'brief', 'cameo', 'feature', 'touch', 'nostalgia', 'nonetheless', 'movies', 'focus', 'black', 'people', 'city', 'Brooklyn', 'just', 'happen', 'like', 'one', 'little', 'more.The', 'acting', 'part', 'two', 'child', 'stars', 'surprisingly', 'amateurish', 'especially', 'girl', 'voice', 'inflections', 'are', 'consistently', 'wrong', 'Red', 'Hook', 'Summer', 'as', 'desultory', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'never', 'boring', 'mostly', 'do', 'boy', 'grandfather', 'Bible-gripping', 'bishop', 'who', 'gospel', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'preaching.He', 'determined', 'introduce', 'grandson', 'God', 'even', 'cultic', 'sermons', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears', 'church', 'song', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'non-diegetic', 'music', 'even', 'scenes', 'should', ""n't"", 'play', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'end', 'wearing', 'Music', 'shirt', 'oddly', 'enough', 'good', 'major', 'plot', 'twist', 'movie', 'sudden', 'character', 'reveal', 'level', 'one', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'way', 'riot', 'scene', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'overdramatic', 'even', 'bit', 'silly', 'tone', 'ending', 'feel', 'compassionate', 'protagonist', 'not', 'somber', 'moving.marcellee.com']",Red Hook Summer

1596341,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009GPH3Q4,Mark Turner,"[7, 9]","I remember a day when a Spike Lee movie would come out and critics would fall all over themselves to talk about what a genius he was. I would see these same movies and think they were well made and interesting but nothing near as special as they seemed to think they were. Then things began to change. Lee's new movies weren't getting near the attention his earlier works did and he became known more for his outrageous comments than his films. If he continues to make movies like this I can see that continuing.REDHOOK SUMMER takes place in the now familiar Lee territory of Redhook, Brooklyn. Young Flick is forced by his mother to arrive in Redhook to spend the summer with his religious grandfather Enoch, a pastor of a church there. Coming from a middle class home where he has his own food and non-stop use of his Ipad 2, Flick grumbles about wanting to go home and hates the situation he's in.Enoch doesn't cow tow to the boy and makes the food he normally does. He also has Flick work for him in the church, taking care of the building and handing out pamphlets. It is at the church that Flick makes his only new friend, a young girl named Chazz who takes no guff from Flick and who speaks her mind frequently.Flick seems like the most naive character on the face of the Earth. Walking around the tough neighborhood of Brooklyn he flaunts his Ipad constantly never fearing that it will be stolen from him. When he meets the gang on the street, The Bloods, he doesn't flinch or act like he might be in any jeopardy while his grandfather gives them their space. He might try to convince them to change their ways and accept God but he knows better than to push their buttons.The story here is incredibly thin, that of a young boy discovering a different world than he's used to. While he's surrounded by faith and all that comes with it, the movie isn't about faith or discovering it. Instead it's about Flick and how he changes based on what goes on around him. Plenty of screen time involves the church and sermons there, but Flick seems unfazed by all that. He's more affected by his friendship with Chazz and the experience of being around his grandfather that the time in church. All that changes towards the end of the film with a startling revelation.Two things harm this movie more than anything. The first is the acting involved. Both the actors portraying Flick and Chazz are the most amateurish I've seen in some time. There is no life in Flick, no spark that this is a real person. Instead I felt like I was watching someone read a book instead of acting. The actress playing Chazz felt more like someone portraying a caricature than a real person. Maybe having never been to Brooklyn I'm missing something here but I don't think that's the case.The second worst thing this film does is be boring. The pacing is incredibly slow. Slow patches suddenly have speeches from characters inserted before going back to slow patches. There are few if any characters to sympathize with. With the exception of the big reveal towards the end of the film you feel like nothing is happening here.Movies have been made about the coming of age for characters since the black and white films of the past. Those movies involved the viewer, made them want to know what happened to the character after the final credits. With this film I couldn't find myself caring what happened to the character while it was going on. This is one movie I couldn't recommend to anyone with the exception of Spike Lee followers who will find any movie he does a work of art.",2,AMATEUR HOUR,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,3555,"['remember', 'day', 'when', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'critics', 'would', 'fall', 'talk', 'what', 'genius', 'was', 'would', 'see', 'same', 'movies', 'think', 'were', 'well', 'made', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'as', 'special', 'seemed', 'think', 'were', 'Then', 'things', 'began', 'change', 'Lee', 'new', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'getting', 'attention', 'earlier', 'works', 'did', 'became', 'known', 'more', 'outrageous', 'comments', 'films', 'make', 'movies', 'can', 'see', 'continuing.REDHOOK', 'SUMMER', 'place', 'now', 'familiar', 'Lee', 'territory', 'Redhook', 'Brooklyn', 'Young', 'Flick', 'forced', 'mother', 'arrive', 'Redhook', 'spend', 'summer', 'religious', 'grandfather', 'Enoch', 'pastor', 'church', 'there', 'Coming', 'middle', 'class', 'home', 'where', 'own', 'food', 'non-stop', 'use', 'Ipad', '2', 'Flick', 'wanting', 'go', 'home', 'situation', 'in.Enoch', ""n't"", 'cow', 'tow', 'boy', 'food', 'normally', 'also', 'Flick', 'work', 'church', 'taking', 'care', 'building', 'handing', 'out', 'pamphlets', 'church', 'Flick', 'only', 'new', 'friend', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Chazz', 'who', 'guff', 'Flick', 'who', 'mind', 'frequently.Flick', 'most', 'naive', 'character', 'face', 'Earth', 'Walking', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'Brooklyn', 'Ipad', 'constantly', 'never', 'fearing', 'will', 'be', 'stolen', 'When', 'gang', 'street', 'Bloods', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'act', 'might', 'be', 'jeopardy', 'grandfather', 'space', 'might', 'try', 'convince', 'change', 'ways', 'accept', 'God', 'better', 'push', 'buttons.The', 'story', 'here', 'incredibly', 'thin', 'young', 'boy', 'discovering', 'different', 'world', 'used', 'surrounded', 'faith', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'faith', 'discovering', 'Instead', 'Flick', 'how', 'based', 'what', 'Plenty', 'screen', 'time', 'church', 'sermons', 'there', 'Flick', 'unfazed', 'more', 'affected', 'friendship', 'Chazz', 'experience', 'being', 'grandfather', 'time', 'church', 'changes', 'towards', 'end', 'film', 'startling', 'revelation.Two', 'things', 'harm', 'movie', 'more', 'anything', 'first', 'acting', 'involved', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Flick', 'Chazz', 'are', 'most', 'amateurish', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'life', 'Flick', 'spark', 'real', 'person', 'Instead', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'someone', 'read', 'book', 'instead', 'acting', 'actress', 'playing', 'Chazz', 'felt', 'more', 'someone', 'portraying', 'caricature', 'real', 'person', 'Maybe', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'Brooklyn', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'case.The', 'second', 'worst', 'thing', 'film', 'be', 'boring', 'pacing', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'Slow', 'patches', 'suddenly', 'have', 'speeches', 'characters', 'inserted', 'going', 'back', 'slow', 'patches', 'are', 'few', 'characters', 'sympathize', 'exception', 'big', 'reveal', 'end', 'film', 'feel', 'nothing', 'happening', 'here.Movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'coming', 'age', 'characters', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'past', 'movies', 'involved', 'viewer', 'made', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'character', 'final', 'credits', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'caring', 'what', 'happened', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'exception', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'followers', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'work', 'art']",Red Hook Summer

I received a gift card to a certain store for Christmas, and with tax it was slightly over $10.00.The movie centers around a young man who calls himself Flik Royale, who is from upper middle class Atlanta and goes to the Red Hook housing project in Brooklyn to spend the summer with his granfather, Bishop Enoch Rouse whom he has never met before.The movie is filled with many colorful characters. Spike Lee revises his character Mookie, visibly older and still delivering Sal's Pizza, from the movie ""Do The Right Thing"". We see Mookie twice. There is Chazz Morningstarr a young lady who befriends Flik, and teaches him a thing or two about life. Deacon Zee, a deacon in the church,who is a wino, talks about the economy uses profanity constantly. He is the most comical character, other than T.K., the church organist.I love the way Spike uses vibrant colors in the movie mostly, reds, purple's, yellow, greens, and blues. The soundtrack is also a standout. Judith Hill , who was one of Michael Jackson's backup singers, has several wonderful tracks. Bruce Hornsby has a few tracks also.The movie has a complete plot twist. I won't reveal it, but as in the past, many of Spike's film deal with things that are going on in the black community, and sometimes other communities as well.I thought this was a great film, I have been a Spike Lee fan since 1988. I think many people slept on this film, but Spike is as brilliant as he was 25 years ago. All of his films have a message!  We can all  come away with something from his films.",5,Spike does it again!,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,1579,"['bought', 'movie', 'seeing', 'first', 'received', 'gift', 'card', 'certain', 'store', 'Christmas', 'tax', 'was', 'slightly', '10.00.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Flik', 'Royale', 'who', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Atlanta', 'Red', 'Hook', 'housing', 'project', 'Brooklyn', 'spend', 'summer', 'granfather', 'Bishop', 'Enoch', 'Rouse', 'whom', 'never', 'met', 'before.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'many', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'character', 'Mookie', 'visibly', 'older', 'still', 'delivering', 'Sal', 'Pizza', 'movie', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'see', 'Mookie', 'twice', 'Chazz', 'Morningstarr', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'Flik', 'thing', 'two', 'life', 'Deacon', 'Zee', 'deacon', 'church', 'who', 'wino', 'talks', 'economy', 'profanity', 'constantly', 'most', 'comical', 'character', 'other', 'T.K.', 'church', 'organist.I', 'way', 'Spike', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'movie', 'mostly', 'reds', 'purple', 'yellow', 'greens', 'blues', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'standout', 'Judith', 'Hill', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'backup', 'singers', 'several', 'wonderful', 'tracks', 'Bruce', 'Hornsby', 'few', 'tracks', 'also.The', 'movie', 'complete', 'plot', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'past', 'many', 'Spike', 'film', 'deal', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'black', 'community', 'sometimes', 'other', 'communities', 'well.I', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'fan', '1988', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'slept', 'film', 'Spike', 'as', 'brilliant', 'was', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'films', 'have', 'message', 'can', 'come', 'away', 'something', 'films']",Red Hook Summer

The acting of Clarke Peters really stands out in the lead role.  Even Spike himself recreates one of his most memorable movies role, that of Mookie from Do The Right Thing, who continues to deliver pizza for Sal's Famous Pizzeria in Brooklyn.  Also back from an earlier Spike Lee joint:  Tracy Camilla Johns, who reprises her earlier role as Nola Darling, the female protagonist from She's Gotta Have it, albeit in a quite different way here.",5,A BLAST FROM SPIKE LEE'S PAST,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,559,"['underrated', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'gem', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'release', 'late', 'Summer', '2012', 'one', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'acting', 'Clarke', 'Peters', 'really', 'out', 'lead', 'role', 'Even', 'Spike', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'movies', 'role', 'Mookie', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'who', 'deliver', 'pizza', 'Sal', 'Famous', 'Pizzeria', 'Brooklyn', 'Also', 'back', 'earlier', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'joint', 'Tracy', 'Camilla', 'Johns', 'who', 'earlier', 'role', 'Nola', 'Darling', 'female', 'protagonist', 'Got', 'ta', 'Have', 'quite', 'different', 'way', 'here']",Red Hook Summer
