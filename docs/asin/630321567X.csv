364832,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,630321567X,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","This is an episode in a successful British crime series. A woman is found dead, stabbed by a pole sticking out of a tree. Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis need to find out if this was an accident or murder. The woman was participating in a psychological group therapy in Italy, run by a former criminal with no psychological training, a man that Morse had previously captured for fraud and had imprisoned. While there seems to be no evidence of murder, the woman's husband breaks down during the British inquest of the Italian case and says he was forced to do what he did. He later refuses to clarify his outburst. Morse and Lewis are told to travel to Italy to investigate the issue. The lead Italian detective is convinced that the death was an accident and tries to persuade the two to leave, but Lewis sees him following one of the suspects. Morse and Lewis wonder why the detective wants them to leave and what is he investigating. Morse, who loves opera, is delighted to be in Italy and to meet a famous female opera singer. However, she turns out to be one of several suspects in the possible murder case.",5,A delightful Mose episode with a twist,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1115,"['episode', 'successful', 'British', 'crime', 'series', 'woman', 'found', 'dead', 'stabbed', 'pole', 'sticking', 'tree', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'need', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'accident', 'murder', 'woman', 'was', 'participating', 'psychological', 'group', 'therapy', 'Italy', 'run', 'former', 'criminal', 'psychological', 'training', 'man', 'Morse', 'had', 'previously', 'captured', 'fraud', 'had', 'imprisoned', 'there', 'be', 'evidence', 'murder', 'woman', 'husband', 'breaks', 'down', 'British', 'inquest', 'Italian', 'case', 'was', 'forced', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'later', 'clarify', 'outburst', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'are', 'told', 'travel', 'Italy', 'investigate', 'issue', 'lead', 'Italian', 'detective', 'convinced', 'death', 'was', 'accident', 'tries', 'persuade', 'two', 'leave', 'Lewis', 'following', 'one', 'suspects', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'wonder', 'why', 'detective', 'leave', 'what', 'investigating', 'Morse', 'who', 'opera', 'delighted', 'be', 'Italy', 'meet', 'famous', 'female', 'opera', 'singer', 'However', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'several', 'suspects', 'possible', 'murder', 'case']",N/A
364833,A319KYEIAZ3SON,630321567X,Mary Whipple,"[5, 5]","One of the few Morse episodes which takes place outside of Oxford, Death of the Self provides a close-up view of both Vicenza and Verona, Italy, and what a view it is!  Some of Vicenza's many Palladian masterpieces become settings for this mystery, and the Roman amphitheatre in Verona, used now as an outdoor opera house, is the major setting for the opera-based subplot.The overall plot is one of Morse's most complicated, filled with red herrings.  A fraud whom Morse (John Thaw) has sent to jail in England is now released and conducting expensive psychological workshops in the hills of Vicenza, urging the participants to ""burn the past"" and to ""be free.""  When one of the participants dies a gruesome death, all the others are suspects.  Among these is Nicole Burgess (Frances Barber), an opera singer (Janis Kelly provides the singing voice) whom Morse greatly admires but whose stage fright has ended her career, unless Russell Clark (Michael Kitchen), the ""psychologist,"" can help her.  Nicole's husband, an aristocrat in need of money, is an artist who copies medieval manuscripts.  A female writer (the victim) has written a questionable novel, and one of the participants has disappeared.Morse and Sgt Lewis (Kevin Whately) have only modest success in navigating the ins and outs of the Italian police system, which has closed the murder case.  Conveniently for the plot (and for those who want to see a lot of Vicenza and Verona), they do much of their investigation on their own, in and around Vicenza, and the camera work showing off the architecture is worth the price of the episode.Though the mystery is far-fetched and so full of subplots that it's hard to keep details and characters straight, there's plenty of action within the glorious panorama of rural Lombardy.  Nicole Burgess resides at Palladio's famous Villa Capra, also known as ""La Rotonda,"" and the expansive views of the countryside and close-ups of its front entrance are breathtaking.  Other scenes take place in the second story loggia of the Basilica Palladiana, used here as a public building, with long shots showing the famous repeating arches.  Nicole's opera performance at the Roman arena in Verona is unforgettable, both for Morse's reactions to her voice and for the views of the arena itself.  Not the greatest Morse episode from the standpoint of a unified plot, it is certainly one of the best in terms of scenery and music. n Mary Whipple",4,"""I burn the past.""",1190246400,"09 20, 2007",2007,2438,"['One', 'few', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'place', 'Oxford', 'Death', 'Self', 'close-up', 'view', 'Vicenza', 'Verona', 'Italy', 'what', 'view', 'Vicenza', 'many', 'Palladian', 'masterpieces', 'become', 'settings', 'mystery', 'Roman', 'amphitheatre', 'Verona', 'used', 'now', 'outdoor', 'opera', 'house', 'major', 'setting', 'opera-based', 'subplot.The', 'overall', 'plot', 'one', 'Morse', 'most', 'complicated', 'filled', 'red', 'herrings', 'fraud', 'whom', 'Morse', 'John', 'Thaw', 'sent', 'jail', 'England', 'now', 'released', 'conducting', 'expensive', 'psychological', 'workshops', 'hills', 'Vicenza', 'urging', 'participants', 'burn', 'past', 'be', 'free', 'When', 'one', 'participants', 'gruesome', 'death', 'others', 'are', 'suspects', 'Nicole', 'Burgess', 'Frances', 'Barber', 'opera', 'singer', 'Janis', 'Kelly', 'singing', 'voice', 'whom', 'Morse', 'greatly', 'stage', 'fright', 'ended', 'career', 'Russell', 'Clark', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'psychologist', 'can', 'help', 'Nicole', 'husband', 'aristocrat', 'need', 'money', 'artist', 'who', 'medieval', 'manuscripts', 'female', 'writer', 'victim', 'written', 'questionable', 'novel', 'one', 'participants', 'disappeared.Morse', 'Sgt', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'have', 'only', 'modest', 'success', 'navigating', 'ins', 'outs', 'Italian', 'police', 'system', 'closed', 'murder', 'case', 'Conveniently', 'plot', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'lot', 'Vicenza', 'Verona', 'do', 'much', 'investigation', 'own', 'Vicenza', 'camera', 'work', 'showing', 'off', 'architecture', 'price', 'episode.Though', 'mystery', 'far-fetched', 'so', 'full', 'subplots', 'hard', 'keep', 'details', 'characters', 'straight', 'plenty', 'action', 'glorious', 'panorama', 'rural', 'Lombardy', 'Nicole', 'Burgess', 'resides', 'Palladio', 'famous', 'Villa', 'Capra', 'also', 'known', 'La', 'Rotonda', 'expansive', 'views', 'countryside', 'close-ups', 'front', 'entrance', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'Other', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'second', 'story', 'loggia', 'Basilica', 'Palladiana', 'used', 'here', 'public', 'building', 'long', 'shots', 'showing', 'famous', 'repeating', 'arches', 'Nicole', 'opera', 'performance', 'Roman', 'arena', 'Verona', 'unforgettable', 'Morse', 'reactions', 'voice', 'views', 'arena', 'Not', 'greatest', 'Morse', 'episode', 'standpoint', 'unified', 'plot', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'terms', 'scenery', 'music', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",N/A
364834,AV33XOKKT2PH1,630321567X,Pamela Williams,"[4, 4]","This entry in the Morse series is unusual, if for no other reason than the fact that the episode is filmed on location in Italy.  An English woman suffers a traumatic death in a forest near Vincenza while involved in a pseudo-psychological program offered by Russell Clark, a professional con man who was once incarcerated in England for defrauding the elderly.  The official Italian verdict is accidental death; however, remarks made by the dead woman's husband during the Oxford inquest hearing raises the possibility that the death resulted from foul play.  Given the doubt surrounding the circumstances of the woman's death and the criminal history of the program sponsor, Morse and Lewis are sent to Italy to investigate the matter.  Morse, who was chiefly responsible for building the criminal case which sent Clark to prison, is instantly suspicious regarding the woman's death and highly cynical concerning the value of Clark's self-help courses.  In any event, Morse soon discovers that at least two course participants had possible motives to kill the English lady; however, he is genuinely frustrated by the fact that the Italian police are dismissive of this ""new evidence"" and are also unwilling (seemingly) to consider the possibility that Clark may be involved in something sinister or at least fraudulent.  Despite his frustrations, however, Morse does have the opportunity to meet one of his favorite female opera performers-- a lady who recently completed the Clark course to overcome stage fright and resume her career.  In fact, a low level romantic attraction develops between the two of them.  His relationship with Nicole, the lure of the beautiful scenery, and his appreciation of Italian culture represent distractions-- but do not impede Morse's efforts to investigate the woman's death.  Ultimately, Morse's judgement about the truly villainous nature of Clark's character and activities is vindicated, but on a basis which has nothing to do with the woman's death in the woods.  In the final analysis, we find that Clark is once more involved in fraudulent intrigues, and that he is willing to influence a lady toward suicide to protect his schemes.  The role of Clark as charming and convincing con man is exceptionally well played by Michael Kitchens.  This episode unfolds at a leisurely pace and in many ways is a departure from the usual Morse mystery.  Even Sergeant Lewis, who is initially reluctant to spend two weeks in Italy and anxious to get home to particpate in his son's sports day at school, soon becomes enthusiastic about nailing Clark and also succumbs to the charm of Italy.  One humorous scene features Lewis as the dance partner of an American tourist, at a party which apparently lasts all night.  This episode is satisfying but not spectacular; nevertheless, it is worth viewing for the change of pace and for the exposure to the marvelous scenery of rural and urban Italy.",4,Villains in Vicenza,1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,2925,"['entry', 'Morse', 'series', 'unusual', 'other', 'reason', 'fact', 'episode', 'filmed', 'location', 'Italy', 'English', 'woman', 'traumatic', 'death', 'forest', 'Vincenza', 'involved', 'pseudo-psychological', 'program', 'offered', 'Russell', 'Clark', 'professional', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'incarcerated', 'England', 'defrauding', 'elderly', 'official', 'Italian', 'verdict', 'accidental', 'death', 'however', 'remarks', 'made', 'dead', 'woman', 'husband', 'Oxford', 'inquest', 'hearing', 'possibility', 'death', 'resulted', 'foul', 'play', 'Given', 'doubt', 'surrounding', 'circumstances', 'woman', 'death', 'criminal', 'history', 'program', 'sponsor', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'are', 'sent', 'Italy', 'investigate', 'matter', 'Morse', 'who', 'was', 'chiefly', 'responsible', 'building', 'criminal', 'case', 'sent', 'Clark', 'prison', 'instantly', 'suspicious', 'regarding', 'woman', 'death', 'highly', 'cynical', 'concerning', 'value', 'Clark', 'self-help', 'courses', 'event', 'Morse', 'soon', 'least', 'two', 'course', 'participants', 'had', 'possible', 'motives', 'kill', 'English', 'lady', 'however', 'genuinely', 'frustrated', 'fact', 'Italian', 'police', 'are', 'dismissive', 'new', 'evidence', 'are', 'also', 'unwilling', 'seemingly', 'consider', 'possibility', 'Clark', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'something', 'sinister', 'least', 'fraudulent', 'frustrations', 'however', 'Morse', 'have', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'one', 'favorite', 'female', 'opera', 'performers', 'lady', 'who', 'recently', 'completed', 'Clark', 'course', 'overcome', 'stage', 'fright', 'resume', 'career', 'fact', 'low', 'level', 'romantic', 'attraction', 'two', 'relationship', 'Nicole', 'lure', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'appreciation', 'Italian', 'culture', 'represent', 'distractions', 'do', 'not', 'impede', 'Morse', 'efforts', 'investigate', 'woman', 'death', 'Ultimately', 'Morse', 'judgement', 'truly', 'villainous', 'nature', 'Clark', 'character', 'activities', 'vindicated', 'basis', 'nothing', 'do', 'woman', 'death', 'woods', 'final', 'analysis', 'find', 'Clark', 'once', 'more', 'involved', 'fraudulent', 'intrigues', 'willing', 'influence', 'lady', 'suicide', 'protect', 'schemes', 'role', 'Clark', 'charming', 'convincing', 'con', 'man', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'played', 'Michael', 'Kitchens', 'episode', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'many', 'ways', 'departure', 'usual', 'Morse', 'mystery', 'Even', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'who', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'spend', 'two', 'weeks', 'Italy', 'anxious', 'get', 'home', 'particpate', 'son', 'sports', 'day', 'school', 'soon', 'enthusiastic', 'nailing', 'Clark', 'also', 'charm', 'Italy', 'One', 'humorous', 'scene', 'features', 'Lewis', 'dance', 'partner', 'American', 'tourist', 'party', 'apparently', 'night', 'episode', 'satisfying', 'not', 'spectacular', 'nevertheless', 'worth', 'viewing', 'change', 'pace', 'exposure', 'marvelous', 'scenery', 'rural', 'urban', 'Italy']",N/A

This 1992 episode is set in Vicenza and Verona, Italy where Morse (John Thaw) and Detective Sergeant Lewis (Kevin Whately) are sent to investigate the death of an Englishwoman who is involved in a pricey psychological program run by Russell Clark (Michael Kitchen) a former adversary whom Morse had put away years before.The mystery involves a large cast of characters, some of who are difficult to follow, but the main achievement of this story is the gorgeous Lombardy scenery and operatic selections from Rigoletto and Turandot (sung by Scottish operatic soprano Janis Kelly).  Viewers are treated to scenes from the Roman arena in Verona, the Palladio's Villa Capra (here used as the residence of opera star Nicole Burgess, played by Frances Barber).When Morse and Lewis arrive in Italy, they find the Italian police have closed the case, figuring it as accidental death.

This particular episode was shot on-location in Italy, and sees Chief Inspector Morse and DS Lewis traveling there to investigate a case where a woman was found crucified to a tree. Though her death was ruled an accident, her husband's emotional outburst at the inquest makes it appear there was more to her death than previously thought. The case becomes even more interesting when Morse discovers that the dead woman had been attending a psychotherapy course in Vincenza, a course conducted by a con man (played credibly by Michael Kitchen) who had been previously arrested by Morse, been found guilty, and imprisoned for some time. Needless to say, Morse is convinced that this con man is involved in the woman's death.Meanwhile, Lewis is initially reluctant to enjoy the splendors of Italy, worried he might not make it back home in time to see his son's sports performance. Morse on the other hand, is enjoying himself, and his love for the opera is further enhanced by his involvement with a beautiful woman who used to be a prominent opera star, and who is now attempting a comeback.
