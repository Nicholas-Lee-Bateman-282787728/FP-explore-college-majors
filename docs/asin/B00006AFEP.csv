I mean, he's been pushy, demanding and silly on the set. He's not following a shot schedule or taking advice from anyone, particularly Chris Moore (who comes off in this show as a sort of wiseass, common-sense-spouting hero).Incidentally, did you count how many drinks Ben Affleck had in the first episode?

After viewing the first season of HBO's Project Greenlight on four dvds, I have a better concept of filmmaking nad the process involved behind the scenes.I have read Jerry Lewis's theThe Total Film-Maker.and understand the basic concepts of how the film starts from the script to final production. If you find a copy, read it!Here in this documentary DVD set is director Pete Jones's  filmmaking odyssey from being a novice screen writer (selected from an on line script contest) to selection of his script Stolen Summer (with producers Ben Affleck, Chris Moore & Matt Damon) greenlighted by Miramax. Then Jones had to make a budget and rewriting his script to fit his budget and not lose his cinematic vision. After that, there was the process of locations, casting actors, filming, to  editing his final print. Jones's film education is well documented in this mini series.To see it on DVD, you have a better chance to digest this series and Jones's filmmaking expierences...because you are with him for the journey as camera is on him personally and his cinematic vision. It is not always a positive or happy expierence. Sometimes you see the deals and the compromises you make, when making a movieThere are guests along the way like Jay Leno, Kevin Smith, Harvey Weinstein, and many others  filling the twelve week series.Included in this four disk DVD package is Pete Jones's final released cut of his film Stolen Summer with  his audio commentary.This DVD set shows what it takes to make films. since this is a small budget film, you can picture the bigger hassles that the large multi million dollar epic must go through...What an eduction this DVD series really is.This is worth viewing for the filmmaker, the film student, the film buff and those people who like to understand better the process of filmmaking. However, it is also amazing journey for those who like reality television.To watch the process is something that we all should view and this is a first rate showcase. This DVD set shows the real HOLLYWOOD from the hype that it usually showsThe extra features of the fourth disk shows the producers can poke fun at themselves and well as educate, So watch and learnBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",5,Great Greenlight,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,2474,"['are', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'say', 'myself', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'Who', 'producer', 'who', 'took', 'risk', 'script', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'such', 'such', 'actor', 'role', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'down', 'ending', 'viewing', 'first', 'season', 'HBO', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'four', 'dvds', 'have', 'better', 'concept', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'involved', 'scenes.I', 'have', 'read', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'theThe', 'Total', 'Film-Maker.and', 'understand', 'basic', 'concepts', 'how', 'film', 'script', 'final', 'production', 'find', 'copy', 'read', 'Here', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'set', 'director', 'Pete', 'Jones', 'filmmaking', 'odyssey', 'being', 'novice', 'screen', 'writer', 'selected', 'line', 'script', 'contest', 'selection', 'script', 'Stolen', 'Summer', 'producers', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Chris', 'Moore', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'greenlighted', 'Miramax', 'Then', 'Jones', 'had', 'make', 'budget', 'rewriting', 'script', 'fit', 'budget', 'not', 'lose', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'was', 'process', 'locations', 'casting', 'actors', 'filming', 'editing', 'final', 'print', 'Jones', 'film', 'education', 'well', 'documented', 'mini', 'series.To', 'see', 'DVD', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'digest', 'series', 'Jones', 'filmmaking', 'expierences', 'are', 'journey', 'camera', 'personally', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'not', 'always', 'positive', 'happy', 'expierence', 'Sometimes', 'see', 'deals', 'compromises', 'make', 'when', 'making', 'movieThere', 'are', 'guests', 'way', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Harvey', 'Weinstein', 'many', 'others', 'filling', 'twelve', 'week', 'series.Included', 'four', 'disk', 'DVD', 'package', 'Pete', 'Jones', 'final', 'released', 'cut', 'film', 'Stolen', 'Summer', 'audio', 'commentary.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'what', 'make', 'films', 'small', 'budget', 'film', 'can', 'picture', 'bigger', 'hassles', 'large', 'multi', 'million', 'dollar', 'epic', 'must', 'go', 'What', 'eduction', 'DVD', 'series', 'really', 'is.This', 'worth', 'viewing', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'student', 'film', 'buff', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'understand', 'better', 'process', 'filmmaking', 'However', 'also', 'amazing', 'journey', 'who', 'like', 'reality', 'television.To', 'watch', 'process', 'something', 'should', 'view', 'first', 'rate', 'showcase', 'DVD', 'set', 'real', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'hype', 'usually', 'showsThe', 'extra', 'features', 'fourth', 'disk', 'producers', 'can', 'poke', 'fun', 'well', 'educate', 'So', 'watch', 'learnBennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']","Project Greenlight, Season 1"

If you are a filmmaker, interested in the film industry...this four DVD set is jam-packed!First, let's talk about DVD 2-3.  The Project Greenlight twelve episode series.  I literally couldn't stop after each episode, I literally wanted to keep watching all episodes in one sitting and I did.  You really get a good behind-the-scenes look at the making of a film.  Sure, probably not in-depth that people would like but nevertheless a really good behind-the-scenes look at the making of &quot;Stolen Summer&quot; and the difference of opinions and the stress that goes on.  You literally can feel it.DVD 4.  This DVD is packed with video entries from the top competitors in the contest from their personal videos of why they should be selected to the top 10's short films and more.  There is also the act like Chris Moore competition and of course Project Redlight and also advice.  There is just so much stuff on this fourth DVD.  I've been a vistor of the Project Greenlight Website since this competition and it is great to see the competitor videos included on the DVD.And DVD 1.  This includes &quot;Stolen Summer&quot; movie, deleted scenes, director and producer's commentary.I don't know...I pretty much looked at this video like the many filmmaking books that I have and saw it more as a really good investment.  It's like how many filmmakers purchase &quot;El Mariachi&quot; for Rodriguez's filmmaking advice (and his cool book), this is also a worthy purchase.With all four DVD's packed with so much and for the price I got it for, I don't see how you can go wrong with this DVD.

For some time I believed digital cameras and video editing software might be seen as a threat to the film industry and that Project Greenlight was a propaganda tool devised by the Hollywood community to be used to discourage competition. This sounds absurd now but really the show does look like that. I remember reading scripts during the contest and every single one of the scripts I reviewed were better than the ones that made it to the finals. I couldn't understand how Stolen Summer was picked as the winner of the contest. But that's okay because the show itself is the movie, as far as I'm concerned. I hate the movie Stolen Summer but I LOVE the series. I've watched this entire series 4 times since I bought it but only suffered through the actual movie once and then I watched it with the commentary track so it would be worth my time. I think Pete Jones and the others are better characters than any he wrote for the film. Pete kind of reminded me of a character like Barney from the Andy Griffith show. He seemed like someone who thought he was cooler and more important than he really was.

709169,ARHE73CT3GAMF,B00006AFEP,"lisakttn ""lisakttn""","[2, 3]","I must begin by saying that I am addicted to Project Greenlight.  I, too, am an aspiring writer and find PGL inspiring.  I loved this DVD set.First, Stolen Summer.  It may not win the academy award but it won my heart.  Pete Jones tells a story that is so human and so touching with moments of humor as well as sadness.  It just felt natural and I think that is why I enjoyed it so much.  The little boy who plays the lead role was just amazing, especially being he first time out.  I would reccommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained and touched.Second, Project Greenlight, the series.  WOW.  I was unable to see all of the episodes while it ran last year so you can imagine my elation to find it all together in a DVD set.  The whole process fascinates me and I just love Jeff Balis ( I love Balis more season 2) and Chris Moore.Third, Pete Jones.  He was terrific.  Yes, he was rough around the edges but heck he had never done anything remotely like this before.  I think his rapport with the younger actors is a gift and part of what will eventually make him a great director.  The more opportunities Pete is given the better he will hone his craft, I am a fan and wish him all the luck.Lastly, The Chris Moore Challange was great, Project Redlight was even better.  Project Redlight was terrific in that it poked fun at everyone and the whole process and how wonderful is it that people are able to laugh at themselves in such a ""self involved"" industry!!!If you are a fan of PGL, buy this, you will love it.",5,"All that, a bag of chips and MOORE!!!",1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,1530,"['must', 'begin', 'saying', 'am', 'addicted', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'too', 'am', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'find', 'PGL', 'inspiring', 'loved', 'DVD', 'set.First', 'Stolen', 'Summer', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'academy', 'award', 'won', 'heart', 'Pete', 'Jones', 'story', 'so', 'human', 'so', 'touching', 'moments', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'sadness', 'just', 'felt', 'natural', 'think', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'especially', 'being', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'would', 'reccommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'entertained', 'touched.Second', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'series', 'WOW', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'episodes', 'ran', 'last', 'year', 'so', 'can', 'imagine', 'elation', 'find', 'together', 'DVD', 'set', 'whole', 'process', 'fascinates', 'just', 'love', 'Jeff', 'Balis', 'love', 'Balis', 'more', 'season', '2', 'Chris', 'Moore.Third', 'Pete', 'Jones', 'was', 'terrific', 'Yes', 'was', 'rough', 'edges', 'heck', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'remotely', 'think', 'rapport', 'younger', 'actors', 'gift', 'part', 'what', 'will', 'eventually', 'make', 'great', 'director', 'more', 'opportunities', 'Pete', 'given', 'better', 'will', 'hone', 'craft', 'am', 'fan', 'wish', 'luck.Lastly', 'Chris', 'Moore', 'Challange', 'was', 'great', 'Project', 'Redlight', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'Project', 'Redlight', 'was', 'terrific', 'poked', 'fun', 'everyone', 'whole', 'process', 'how', 'wonderful', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'laugh', 'self', 'involved', 'industry', 'are', 'fan', 'PGL', 'buy', 'will', 'love']","Project Greenlight, Season 1"

709171,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00006AFEP,Michael Crane,"[36, 36]","What started as a simple Internet contest transformed into one of the most acclaimed reality series to hit cable for quite some time.  Pete Jones was the winner and was given the opportunity to direct his film, &quot;Stolen Summer.&quot;  Sounds easy, right?  WRONG!With these episodes, you get to see all the drama, all the battles, and all of the controvercy that took place during the filming of &quot;Stolen Summer.&quot;  From casting complications to the infamous beach incident, they're all here, uncut and uncensored.I for one really enjoyed the series.  It was a look into directing that I had never witnessed before.  I never knew how complicated and stressful it is for the director, even when it comes to getting ONE scene into the can!This spectacular DVD package includes four disks.  On these disks you will find twelve episodes, the full length movie &quot;Stolen Summer,&quot; and a disk full of all sorts of extras and goodies.The disks go something like this:Disk One:  The complete film &quot;Stolen Summer,&quot; with extra features that include audio commentary from the director, co-producer and producer Chris Moore, the theatrical trailer, 2 deleted scenes (with choice of commentary or no commentary), and Pete Jones' &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; scene vs. the final film.  I highly recommend the full length commentary.  It's funny and informative at the same time.Disk Two:  Episodes 1-6.  (Or Episodes 101-106, if you want to be more accurate.)Disk Three: Episodes 7-12.  (Or Episodes 107-112, if you would like again to be more accurate.)Disk Four:  A bonus disk with tons of extras that include notable filmmaker videos from the contest, the Top 10 videos, Top 10 &quot;Where are they now&quot; videos, &quot;The Chris Moore Challenge,&quot; the Top 10 3-minute scenes from the Top 3 contestants, and lessons from &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; that you didn't get to see on the show.  &quot;The Chris Moore Challenge&quot; is guaranteed to get a laugh out of you, especially when you see Ben Afleck's impression.  The extended lessons were also interesting and funny, especially Kevin Smith's conversation with Pete.  There's some great filmmaking tips in it if you're interested.Note:  Since this was broadcasted on HBO, all of the strong language is in it, so it's not really recommended for younger viewers.  The language can get pretty intense at times, but it adds to the realistic element of filmmaking.  Not to mention it's funny as hell at times.  (If you thought Afleck and Damon had potty mouths in &quot;Goodwill Hunting......&quot;)I really enjoyed &quot;Project Greenlight.&quot;  And I'm glad they released the complete series on DVD.  Again, if you like the series and want the movie as well, DO NOT BUY THE MOVIE SEPARATELY!  The movie already comes with the series.  It was quite remarkable to see how the movie evolved from all of the battles and controvercy.  I was a little worried about the movie, because there was a lot of drama that went on during the filming, but the movie turned out really good.  (I'll write a seperate review of the movie &quot;Stolen Summer&quot; VERY shortly.)  Forget &quot;Survivor,&quot; this is the ultimate reality series!  Filled with over 6 hours of bonus material, the &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; DVD package is a must-have for anyone who loved the show.  It's also a great show for those who are new to it.

The episodes are exciting and well edited and leave you wanting them to bring on the next episode.  I had not seen any of season 1, but I did see a few episodes of season 2 and hated the directors.  The writer/director in this first season was good.  The movie was good and the behind the scenes drama was a good time for anyone.I got these DVDs less than a week ago and someone has already borrowed one of the DVDs.  The show is addictive if you have not seen it. It is just a shame that the movie made in season 1 barely made over $100k.  Makes you wonder how Miramax can pony up the $1.5 mil for the season 1 movie and the 1.0 mil for the season two movie (which barely made 240k).  Season 3 is coming soon on Bravo, so I guess that are making profit somewhere.  I suppose DVD sells and the HBO deal made it profitable.Anyway, definitely think about getting the set slightly used and save a few bucks and enjoy Project Greenlight's best season in my opinion.",5,Great Behind the Scenes Look at the Movie Biz,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,1059,"['think', 'almost', 'anyone', 'would', 'enjoy', 'DVDs', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'huge', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'exciting', 'well', 'edited', 'leave', 'wanting', 'bring', 'next', 'episode', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'season', '1', 'did', 'see', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'hated', 'directors', 'writer/director', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'scenes', 'drama', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'anyone.I', 'got', 'DVDs', 'less', 'week', 'ago', 'someone', 'already', 'borrowed', 'one', 'DVDs', 'show', 'addictive', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'just', 'shame', 'movie', 'made', 'season', '1', 'barely', 'made', '100k', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'how', 'Miramax', 'can', 'pony', 'up', '1.5', 'mil', 'season', '1', 'movie', '1.0', 'mil', 'season', 'two', 'movie', 'barely', 'made', '240k', 'Season', '3', 'coming', 'soon', 'Bravo', 'guess', 'are', 'making', 'profit', 'somewhere', 'suppose', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'deal', 'made', 'profitable.Anyway', 'definitely', 'think', 'getting', 'set', 'slightly', 'used', 'save', 'few', 'bucks', 'enjoy', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'best', 'season', 'opinion']","Project Greenlight, Season 1"

As the writer's first film, this isn't bad but, considering the subject matter, it lacks the depth that a more experienced writer might give it. This film only skims the surface of the theme of misunderstanding between religions, and the talented cast clearly know this. Aidan Quinn, as the working class stiff Catholic, turns in his performance by mail, and Kevin Pollack, as Rabbi Jacobson, appears to be hanging around the set waiting for the director to shout ""action"". Mike Weinberg, as Danny Jacobson, the Rabbi's eight year old son, is natural and charming, but he is not stretched either.This story has great potential, and the cast, including Brian Dennehy, are always worth watching.

""Stolen Summer"" isn't bad, definitely not great, but for a first-time director with no real filmmaking experience at all, it's a pretty good effort.  Sure I'm grading on a curve here, but when you see some of the dreck put out by people with plenty of experience, ""Summer"" begins to seem more than worthy to be called a film.  Throughout the series, many involved express concerns that the script ventured too far down into Afterschool Special territory, and to some extent, they were right.  The nice thing about the script is that it manages to avoid getting too preachy (given the clash of religions at the story's core, that is a feat in itself) and the attitudes of all the characters to young Pete's quest ring surprisingly true, at least, in a nice, better world scenario.  As a directed film, The pacing is a bit slow, scenes can be a bit static, and the child actors in the leads could be a bit stronger, but these are not unusual problems in movies with bigger budgets and more accomplished directors, ""Phantom Menace"", anyone?Enough defense of Pete Jones, and on to the series.  As a general rule, I steer clear of the ""reality"" genre as it has developed into public humiliation of private citizens while avoiding the need to pay writers (it probably keeps film and video editors in banner business, however).  ""Project Greenlight"" is an exception.  Why?  Well for one thing, the end result is at least a creative endeavor and not just some idiot getting a lot of money or a usless marriage proposal.  For another, you also learn a little something about the business of making a movie, usless of course if you could care less, but it's better than watching ""Survivor"" for wilderness survival tips.",5,Interested in the movie biz?
