It was a good evolutionary tale off an Original Series episode, ""Wink of an Eye,"" without copycatting the concept.  It expands on the idea of temporal space and time.  If you like Star Trek, you'll really like this episode. You might also recognize a young Daniel Dae Kim ( Jin from ""LOST"").

856548,A1M9H7AB2N0Q4Z,B00062IDLA,Andrew Cross,"[1, 2]","It has been said by multiple `Star Trek' fans that `Voyager' was a prime culprit of shredding the Borg of any kind of threat. When they first burst onto the `Star Trek' universe (in the `TNG' episode `Q Who?') they were otherworldly, malevolent, and near unstoppable. Kill or be killed was the order of business whenever they showed up and it's made for some heart-pounding heroism by many Federation crews.Like any popular hit song though, the more you hear it, the less resonance it has. `Unimatrix Zero' is the proverbial chisel that strips the Borg of whatever evil might they once had.The crux of this two-part season final is that there is a chance for Janeway and crew to spark a resistance from inside the Collective. She then sets in motion a plan that involves Tuvok, Torres, and herself getting assimilated, so as to introduce a virus that will allow everyone in Unimatrix Zero to retain their individuality after regenerating.So...assimilation. A horrifying violation of an individual's mind, body and soul by the Borg. A process that we have been told over and over again is almost a fate worse then death is fundamentally muted. Sure, they retain their individuality through a random potion thought up by the Doc (which is another negation of what was once thought inexorable), but what about the ghastly body mutilations? I guess having a half a toaster shoved into your eyeball ain't no thang to the Voyager crew.The assimilation of Janeway is supposed to be a final, chilling cliffhanger for the show, but instead comes off as confusing with no weight to it. Assimilation is something you want to avoid at all costs, so much so that death is a better course. But hey! We can simply reverse that now and get those irritating Borg implants right out of you at no extra cost!Positive Points:- Janeway always seem to be at her heroic best when fighting the Borg. Maybe it's how the Borg Queen almost curses her name whenever she finds out Janeway is messing about with the Collective.- Some aspects of Seven of Nine having a history in Unimatrix Zero are cool. Annika has apparently been kicking it as a human adult for sometime.- Harry Kim asking when he'll get promoted and everyone pretty much ignoring him.Negative Points:- The Borg Queen and severed Borg heads. A desperate attempt to make her twice as evil, but it just makes her (and the Collective) look incompetent.- The cobbled together feel of the episode. Unimatrix Zero (the place, not the episode) doesn't make much sense.- The crew not bothered enough by Janeway's plan to get assimilated. Chakotay used to put up a better fight then this to Janeway's hair brain schemes.",2,Assimilation - Ain't No Thang,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,2649,"['been', 'said', 'multiple', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'Voyager', 'was', 'prime', 'culprit', 'shredding', 'Borg', 'kind', 'threat', 'When', 'first', 'burst', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'TNG', 'episode', 'Q', 'Who', 'were', 'otherworldly', 'malevolent', 'unstoppable', 'Kill', 'be', 'killed', 'was', 'order', 'business', 'whenever', 'showed', 'up', 'made', 'heart-pounding', 'heroism', 'many', 'Federation', 'crews.Like', 'popular', 'hit', 'song', 'more', 'hear', 'less', 'resonance', 'Unimatrix', 'Zero', 'proverbial', 'chisel', 'Borg', 'evil', 'might', 'once', 'had.The', 'crux', 'two-part', 'season', 'final', 'chance', 'Janeway', 'crew', 'spark', 'resistance', 'Collective', 'then', 'motion', 'plan', 'Tuvok', 'Torres', 'getting', 'assimilated', 'so', 'introduce', 'virus', 'will', 'allow', 'everyone', 'Unimatrix', 'Zero', 'retain', 'individuality', 'regenerating.So', 'assimilation', 'horrifying', 'violation', 'individual', 'mind', 'body', 'soul', 'Borg', 'A', 'process', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'almost', 'fate', 'worse', 'then', 'death', 'fundamentally', 'muted', 'Sure', 'retain', 'individuality', 'random', 'potion', 'thought', 'up', 'Doc', 'negation', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'thought', 'inexorable', 'what', 'ghastly', 'body', 'mutilations', 'guess', 'having', 'half', 'toaster', 'shoved', 'eyeball', 'ai', ""n't"", 'thang', 'Voyager', 'crew.The', 'assimilation', 'Janeway', 'supposed', 'be', 'final', 'chilling', 'cliffhanger', 'show', 'instead', 'off', 'confusing', 'weight', 'Assimilation', 'something', 'want', 'avoid', 'costs', 'so', 'much', 'death', 'better', 'course', 'hey', 'can', 'simply', 'reverse', 'now', 'get', 'irritating', 'Borg', 'implants', 'right', 'extra', 'cost', 'Positive', 'Points', 'Janeway', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'heroic', 'best', 'when', 'fighting', 'Borg', 'Maybe', 'how', 'Borg', 'Queen', 'almost', 'name', 'whenever', 'out', 'Janeway', 'messing', 'Collective.-', 'aspects', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'having', 'history', 'Unimatrix', 'Zero', 'are', 'cool', 'Annika', 'apparently', 'been', 'kicking', 'human', 'adult', 'sometime.-', 'Harry', 'Kim', 'asking', 'when', ""'ll"", 'get', 'promoted', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignoring', 'him.Negative', 'Points', 'Borg', 'Queen', 'severed', 'Borg', 'heads', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'make', 'twice', 'evil', 'just', 'Collective', 'look', 'incompetent.-', 'cobbled', 'together', 'feel', 'episode', 'Unimatrix', 'Zero', 'place', 'not', 'episode', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense.-', 'crew', 'not', 'bothered', 'enough', 'Janeway', 'plan', 'get', 'assimilated', 'Chakotay', 'used', 'put', 'up', 'better', 'fight', 'then', 'Janeway', 'hair', 'brain', 'schemes']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Sixth Season

More great stories and great writing and great acting.  This season dives even deeper into the personalies of the characters and lets us know their beliefs and limits.  This season has a direct link to The Next Generation with Reginald Barlay (again portrayed by Dwight Schultz) in the episode ""Pathfinder"".  Tom Paris has a love affair with a ship...no...not the Delta Flyer.  We get an inside look at a possible timeline of Earth's future in ""One Small Step"" and ""The Rock"" guest stars in ""Tsunkatse"".  Also, is the creation of Fair Haven...a holodeck recreation program.  Janeway finds some lost crew members (Zoe MacLellan guest stars).  Neelix tells a ghost story, and Seven relives a relationship she found while in the Collective in ""Unimatrix Zero"".  Kes returns.  Oh heck...there's too much to write in a review.

856554,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B00062IDLA,Brandon J. Smith,"[1, 1]","Though my favorite Trek will always be Deep Space Nine, followed by The Next Generation, I give Voyager a lot of credit for growing as a series. When it first started, I found it to be dreadful. It was only after the addition of Seven of Nine that the show became more focused, and the cast really started to gel. By the end of the series' run, I found it a very respectable show and an important part of the Star Trek universe.Still, while the general quality of the episodes ranged from average to good, Voyager turned in two of the very best Star Trek episodes ever produced. The first is ""Latent Image"" in season 5, in which the very nature of the Doctor's sentience is debated. It's one of the finest hours of television I've ever seen, and in itself justifies the existence of Voyager. The other is the episode ""Pathfinder,"" found here in season 6. Dwight Schultz reprises his TNG role as Reginald Barclay, he of awkward social skills, many phobias, and holosuite addiction. The episode focuses on Barclay's determination to establish communication with Voyager, a ship that, like himself, is far removed from comfort and ""home."" Whereas Barclay was an interesting character on TNG, here he is even more vital and emotionally moving as he struggles to aid the lost Voyager, and in so doing find a place for himself and a connection to other people. Even the minor characters shine in this episode - I could go on and on, but really you've just got to see it and experience it for yourself. (And stick around for the half-dozen or so episodes that follow it, as they do keep the ball rolling rather well, with some very well-crafted plots and intriguing premises.)Voyager's final three seasons really were terrific, and ""Pathfinder"" represents the show at its best. I'd expect any Star Trek fan would be very happy to have this episode, and this stand-out season, as part of his or her collection.",4,"Excellent Season, highlighted by ""Pathfinder""",1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,1902,"['favorite', 'Trek', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'followed', 'Next', 'Generation', 'give', 'Voyager', 'lot', 'credit', 'growing', 'series', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'found', 'be', 'dreadful', 'was', 'only', 'addition', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'show', 'became', 'more', 'focused', 'cast', 'really', 'started', 'gel', 'end', 'series', 'run', 'found', 'very', 'respectable', 'show', 'important', 'part', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe.Still', 'general', 'quality', 'episodes', 'ranged', 'average', 'good', 'Voyager', 'turned', 'two', 'very', 'best', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ever', 'produced', 'first', 'Latent', 'Image', 'season', '5', 'very', 'nature', 'Doctor', 'sentience', 'debated', 'one', 'finest', 'hours', 'television', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'existence', 'Voyager', 'other', 'episode', 'Pathfinder', 'found', 'here', 'season', '6', 'Dwight', 'Schultz', 'TNG', 'role', 'Reginald', 'Barclay', 'awkward', 'social', 'skills', 'many', 'phobias', 'holosuite', 'addiction', 'episode', 'Barclay', 'determination', 'establish', 'communication', 'Voyager', 'ship', 'far', 'removed', 'comfort', 'home', 'Barclay', 'was', 'interesting', 'character', 'TNG', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'vital', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'aid', 'lost', 'Voyager', 'so', 'doing', 'find', 'place', 'connection', 'other', 'people', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'shine', 'episode', 'could', 'go', 'really', ""'ve"", 'just', 'got', 'see', 'experience', 'stick', 'around', 'half-dozen', 'so', 'episodes', 'follow', 'do', 'keep', 'ball', 'rolling', 'rather', 'well', 'very', 'well-crafted', 'plots', 'intriguing', 'premises', 'Voyager', 'final', 'three', 'seasons', 'really', 'were', 'terrific', 'Pathfinder', 'show', 'best', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'have', 'episode', 'stand-out', 'season', 'part', 'collection']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Sixth Season
856555,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00062IDLA,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[5, 10]","Nominated for 30 Emmys, including seven for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series, Star Trek: Voyager continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 6) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Equinox"" in which the crew of the Voyager is charged with devising a solution to rescue Capt. Janeway and Seven Of Nine before it's too late... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""The Voyager Conspiracy"" in which a malfunctioning Seven Of Nine starts spouting rumors of mutiny when the Voyager encounters an alien race in possession of warp technology capable of bringing the Voyager back home, and ""Good Shepard"" in which Capt. Janeway takes three of her crew members on a special training mission that goes awry when a collision with a comet threatens their very lives...Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek:

856567,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B00062IDLA,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[12, 39]","In the fall of 1999, for the first time in seven years, there was only going to be one Trek on. With Deep Space Nine sent off to syndicated rerun heaven, Voyager now had a chance to improve itself for its sixth season. Ronald D. Moore, who made the Klingons one of the most popular characters, was brought on board to help. However, his tenure was short-lived. He departed only a few weeks before production started on the sixth season though he did write Survival Instinct and helped pen Barge of the Dead (a Klingon story that showed why he was so good at using them). Again, the first half of the season was a mix bag of bad and semi good, with Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy, Dragon's Teeth, Blink of an Eye, and Memorial coming in on the semi good side. Pathfinder, featuring the return of both Barclay and Deanna Troi continued Voyagers foreshadowing that it the crew would eventually return home. But then there was Alice (the Stephen King inspired story), Riddles, and One Small Step (which appeared to be setting some grounds for Enterprise, for at this time there was speculation that the new series would be set before TOS). The second half featured some of the silliest and lamest episodes yet, including two trips into Tom's latest holodeck creation Fair Haven (what does Trek have against Irish people? This is not the first series to make them look like superstitious buffoons). Two whole hours wasted. These two stories alone proved that Voyager was sinking like a rock. Speaking of rocks, in another attempt getting ratings gold, wrestling superstar The Rock was brought onboard in Tsunkatse, an episode inspired by the controversial motion picture Fight Club (many other TV series did story lines like the Brad Pitt movie). It also featured two semi-regulars from DS9, the always-oily Jeffrey Combs and J.G. Hertzler. It was just too silly -and not even in the most escapist sort of way. There is an old saying Hollywood, everyone has heard it. Don't act with kids or animals. In some odd attempt at creating a story arc, plus get those ratings up, the Borg returned again in Collective. This time, a cube has been so damaged; the Collective has abandoned it, leaving a handful of children in charge. Bad acting children in charge, I might add. They would be the focus of at least three episodes, all of which were sub-par. The rest of the season was a wash, including the boring Muse (Shakespeare in Love?), Good Shepherd, (VOY's version of much better TNG episode Lower Decks) Live Fast and Prosper (a group of conmen who have stolen Voyager's identity. Was it supposed to be funny or serious? Either way, it didn't work) and Life Line (the Doctor is transmitted to the Alpha Quadrant again to help his creator, who is dying).  However, one of the most confusing shows, outside of some its time travel episodes, was Fury. It featured the return of Kes, who appeared to have had bad experiences since she changed forms nearly 4 years earlier. The show itself made no sense, and it even confused the cast (especially Robert Beltran, who went off like a rocket). Most were unsure why Jennifer Lien would return in such an unappealing way, and in such a horribly written episode to boot. One fan at TrekWeb, in an interview with producer/writer Bryan Fuller said the (episode had) ""weak plot and silly contradictions like Kes's shuttle, where did she get it?"" Fuller responded by saying: ""We figured that if Kes had advanced telepathic abilities she would have no trouble stealing a shuttle from a hapless passer-by."" Fuller continued, ""I agree with you on that one being a disappointment. We originally conceived of the show as a contemporary piece with real dramas with the crew seeing their old friend come back and having to deal with her bitterness, but somewhere along the line it became a time-travel episode. I think that was a mistake. It would have been more satisfying to see her interactions raising real issues as opposed to her skulking around the ship looking devious."" The season ends with the return of the Borg, who are no longer the menace they once were, as Braga has used them like tissue paper. Again, like the previous season's final episode, Unimatrix One cliffhanger was anticlimactic. Fairly large white arrows pointed to a conclusion that even a child could figure out. So, there was no anticipation for the conclusion, because they (the production team) already gave you one (and there might be a point at which one could say TNG's Best of Both Worlds was any series best cliffhanger). On the good side, though, he was leaving the day to day work to others, for he and Rick Berman were off to develop the new Trek series now scheduled to bow in the fall of

However, Voyager continued with its trend of abandoning the rest of the crew to boring episodes and haphazard characterization. One exception was an exceptional B'elanna episode ""The Muse"".Unfortunately, this season was also marred by a few duds, including the introduction of the Fair Haven holodeck program, featuring a small town of sentient holograms. Even worse, Captain Janeway falls in love with one - completely out of character. There's also some silliness with the crew adopting a bunch of Borg children.Where I really get frustrated is when the writers develop a really interesting moral quandary, but then find a quick and easy solution. There were definitely a few times this season when I thought Janeway took the moral high ground a bit too quickly. Too often, the writers seem reluctant to show the crew struggling with the moral implications of their decisions, ending episodes with a battle or action scene rather than a deep insight.Overall, there are quite a few missteps, but some gems worth watching.",4,The Seven and Doctor show,1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,1114,"['Seven', 'Nine', 'Doctor', 'episodes', 'Season', '6', 'are', 'finest', 'series', 'However', 'Voyager', 'continued', 'trend', 'abandoning', 'rest', 'crew', 'boring', 'episodes', 'haphazard', 'characterization', 'One', 'exception', 'was', 'exceptional', ""B'elanna"", 'episode', 'Muse', '.Unfortunately', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'marred', 'few', 'duds', 'including', 'introduction', 'Fair', 'Haven', 'holodeck', 'program', 'featuring', 'small', 'town', 'sentient', 'holograms', 'Even', 'worse', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'love', 'one', 'completely', 'character', 'also', 'silliness', 'crew', 'adopting', 'bunch', 'Borg', 'children.Where', 'really', 'get', 'frustrated', 'when', 'writers', 'develop', 'really', 'interesting', 'moral', 'quandary', 'then', 'find', 'quick', 'easy', 'solution', 'were', 'definitely', 'few', 'times', 'season', 'when', 'thought', 'Janeway', 'took', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'Too', 'often', 'writers', 'seem', 'reluctant', 'show', 'crew', 'struggling', 'moral', 'implications', 'decisions', 'ending', 'episodes', 'battle', 'action', 'scene', 'rather', 'deep', 'insight.Overall', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'missteps', 'gems', 'worth', 'watching']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Sixth Season

Amsbaugh,"[0, 0]","The return of Kes, who left rather unceremoniously in the early part of season 4, was nice in that an old friend returned for a final farewell but the story was very lacking. Jennifer Lien didn't leave the show in a contract dispute or anything of the sort and it seems this was an attempt to smooth the feathers of fans who were upset at her departure. She had been out of the business for over 2 years and she wasn't comfortable with the character anymore, too. This, along with a poorly written script, made for high hopes being dashed upon the rocks. Even with all of that, the story could have been saved with a nice ending, say Janeway and Neelix hugging Kes in the transporter room. They didn't even say goodbye! Huh? Sure, Neelix was sad to see her in such tough shape but that had to be all Ethan Phillips and not the script.

856608,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00062IDLA,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[6, 8]","Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe originally created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May 2001. Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season. The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth. Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.The primary cast members of the sixth season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Ensign Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ), Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Voyager's sixth season begins with the episode ""Equinox, Part 2"".  In this continuation of the fifth-season cliff-hanger final episode, Capt. Janeway finds a way to protect Voyager from the attacks of nucleogenic life forms that are fighting back at Captain Ransom (John Savage) who has been slaughtering them for use in improving his equally marooned Starfleet ship, the Equinox.  Of course, once Janeway understands what Ransom and his crew have been doing, she does all that she can to stop them.During the sixth season of ""Voyager"", Seven of Nine faces her past in episode ""Survival Instinct"", B'Elanna's ongoing struggle with her Klingon half is brought to the forefront in episode ""Barge of the Dead"", Tuvok suffers from neurological damage in episode ""Riddles"", Janeway & Voyager discover awakens an ancient race in episode ""Dragon's Teeth"", Chakotay gets excited over the discovery of a long-lost Martian probe in episode ""One Small Step"", Voyager is contacted by Starfleet thanks to Lt. Barclay in episode ""Pathfinder"", Borg children are discovered in episode ""Collective"", former Voyager crewmember Kes (Jennifer Lien) unexpectedly visits in episode ""Fury"" and Capt. Janeway with Seven of Nine again battle the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) in first of the two-part episode ""Unimatrix Zero"". The best sixth-season episodes, in order of airdate, include ""Survival Instinct"", ""Barge of the Dead"", ""Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy"", ""Riddles"", ""Dragon's Teeth"", ""One Small Step"" (possibly the best sixth-season episode), ""Pathfinder"", ""Fair Haven"", ""Blink of an Eye"" (the planet in accelerated time, a very good episode), ""Virtuoso"" (reality-check for the Doctor), ""Memorial"", ""Collective"",  ""Spirit Folk"", ""Child's Play"", ""Muse"", ""Fury"", ""Life Line"" and the season finale ""Unimatrix Zero, Part 1"".  The least memorable sixth-season episodes include ""Equinox, Part 2"", ""Alice"", ""Tsunkatse"", ""Good Shepherd"", ""Live Fast and Prosper"" and ""The Haunting of Deck Twelve"".Overall, I rate the sixth season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars.

856609,A3ARKIF3FNB5HV,B00062IDLA,Michael D. Goolsby,"[16, 19]","Season 6 seemed to be the d&eacute;noument to this series.  It was consistently good overall.  My favorite episode had to ""Dragon's Teeth"" where Janeway and crew discover these old transwarp conduits that could get them home faster only to discover that there are hostile forces claiming these conduits and if Voyager does not leave and forget these, they would destroy the ship.  Instead, Janeway tests their mettle and her ship winds up taking some damage and the crew winds up taking refuge on a planet whose people built these conduits and used them to control this part of the galaxy with an iron fist until the peoples they conquered rose up and destroyed them.  Down underneath the planet's surface, Janeway and crew find some of the survivors of that race only to find that these guys are worse than the pirates they were hiding from.  Once again, Janeway's gotta make a choice, either deal with the baddies from below or the pirates from above.  Eventually, the baddies and the pirates wind up fighting each other instead of pursuing Voyager.For added humor, there ""Tinker, Tenor, Soldier, Spy"" where the doctor enables a dream program and a plucky bureaucrat from an alien ship tries to use these dreams to control the doctor--only to find out that what he was seeing was the doctor's dreams.  It's almost as funny as the episode where the doctor becomes a musical sensation or when he hides out in 7 of 9's cortical implants and winds up taking over her body and personality.  Sometimes he provided the necessary levity where everything else seemed grim for Voyager.""Muse"" is also another good episode as well, as Torres and Kim are stranded on a planet when their shuttle crashes.  Torres is befriended by a playwright who basically uses her stories--the stories about Voyager--to write new plays where we see these people re-enact the journey from the time that the Caretaker removed both Voyager and the Macquis ship from the Badlands to the Delta Quadrant.The season begain with ""Equinox"" where Voyager encounters another starfleet ship brought into the Delta Quadrant.  Once again, the crew is tempted to use what that ship is using for power to get home with, but once it is discovered that the captain of that ship is killing off a race of creatures and using their bodies for the power, this leaves Janeway and crew distressed, especially when these creatures attack Voyager with the intent to destroy it for what Equinox is doing.Then there is ""Child's Play"" where we discover the back story behind Ichib, one of the Borg Children rescued from a failing cube.

856622,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00062IDLA,Robert Moore,"[4, 6]","All in all I found Season Six to be a disappointment following the previous two excellent seasons.  On the upside they continued to infuse the show with serial elements.  On the downside there were simply too many flat or uninteresting episodes.  In general, the problem with the season is that the writing lost some of its edge.For fans of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, this season is interesting for the very, very brief involvement in the show by Ron Moore, who is created with having written the first two stories of the season.  Moore was, of course, a wunderkind who had joined ST:TNG at an absurdly young age and quickly became one of the most important writers on ST:TNG and ST:DS9.  He also wrote the script for two of the ST movies (GENERATIONS and FIRST CONTACT), so his joining VOYAGER as one of the show's primary muses made sense.  But Moore's vision conflicted with those already entrenched.  For instance, he was bothered by the endless number of shuttles and felt that in a long journey across space Voyager should show more wear and tear and shortages of materiel, including shuttles.  So after only two episodes he dropped out of the show.  His next significant gig would be on ROSWELL (which had some major tie ins with the STAR TREK franchise, with Jonathan Frakes as one of the executive producers) and after that CARNIVALE.  In his next project after CARNIVALE he would get his wish to depict a starship struggling with ongoing deprivation in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which in many ways could be construed as the anti-VOYAGER.  Almost everything in BSG is the opposite of VOYAGER.  It features projectile weapons instead of beam weapons.  There are no ""shields"" and therefore you'll never hear Gaeta or Tigh or Helo say something along the lines of ""Shields down to 64%.""  It has no aliens nor even different versions of humanoid species (leaving aside the Cylons).  The political decisions are not idealistic (though arguably a far more politically liberal show than Voyager) but more akin to real politik, with expediency often trumping ideals or prime directives.  Leaders are vastly more fallible on BSG than on VOYAGER.  And BSG never, ever engages in the technobable that dominates every episode of VOYAGER.  On almost every point, the two shows are opposites.  You can tell this simply by looking at the ships, Voyager always pretty and pristine and Galactica looking worse for wear in every episode.While increasingly unhappy with aspects of VOYAGER, there was still much in Season Six that I still found to enjoy.  The Doctor became a more and more important character on the show.  He, along with Seven of Nine, was my favorite character on the series.  Although I often complain about many aspects of the ST franchise, the one area they often excelled at was developing characters that did extraordinary jobs of helping astute viewers explores issues surrounding what can count for personhood.  The series clearly aligns itself with writers like Ray Kurzweil who believe in the almost limitless capacity for computers to gain something akin to geniune intelligence.  At this point in the run of the series I generally found that two-thirds of the episodes that I enjoyed focused either on the Doctor or on Seven.Again, not as good a season as the previous two, but still much better than the first three seasons of the show, which simply were not very interesting and generally failed to approach any potential the show had.

We focus heavily again on Seven and the Doctor, and sadly Neelix too in this season.  After Season 3 when Voyager started to form, and then Seasons 4-5 where Voyager is awesome, and Season 7 that's good, Season 6 sort of looks like it just got lost in the clutter.  Voyager finally starts to have fairly regular contact with StarFleet, namely starting in the episode ""Pathfinder"" as we see that getting home to Earth is more and more a reality all the time.  Kes returns for an episode ""Fury"" which actually is awesome, despite my not caring for Kes.  There aren't many standout episodes in Season 6, most of them are just passable.  The finale half Unimatrix Zero is brilliantly done, and a couple of gems in Season 6 include ""Blink of an Eye,"" ""Riddles,"" and ""Dragon's Teeth.""  There are other enjoyable episodes, such as ""The Voyager Conspiracy"" and ""Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy.""
