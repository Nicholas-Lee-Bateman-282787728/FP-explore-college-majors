754742,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00009MEJX,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Kai Doh Maru / B00009MEJX""Kai Doh Maru"" is probably unique in that not only do you need to review the back of the box before the movie in order to understand what's going on, the back of the box actually contains *more* information than the actual film does!This extremely short film is deeply episodic, with tiny (about 2-3 minutes) vignette-like shots that have been cobbled together in a simulation of a movie. This scene shows two ministers talking about local politics, this scene shows a wagon of mysteriously captured children, this scene shows the cherry blossom trees losing their blossoms in the wind, this scene shows the monastery where the local warriors train. The short scenes fail to tie together in a meaningful way - and while they all relate in some way to the story outline on the back of the box, they never fully realize a story, resembling instead an unfinished storyboard that needed a good deal more fleshing out.Which is not to say that this couldn't have worked as in interesting, if enigmatic film - I enjoyed the episodicDarkside Bluesfor its experimental and artistic nature, if nothing else. But ""Kai Doh Maru"" is so disjointed and disconnected that it's almost impossible to allow yourself any kind of immersion. Several scenes are less than a minute, and without any kind of character development (even from the main character) there's nothing to hold your interest except the artwork which is, in my opinion, pretty poor.Which is a point to be made: several reviewers have praised the artwork as the redeeming value (or, in some cases, the entire point) of the film, and maybe if you're a *huge* enthusiast of the time period, the artwork might give you a reason to watch this film. But if you're just an anime buff like me and don't have the prerequisite schooling to appreciate this style, then the artwork will seem very bland and amateurish. There's very little color in this movie (except the occasional cherry blossom shot), people and faces look two-dimensional and are impossible to distinguish from one another (I was grateful that one of the warriors had an eye patch so I could at least pick *him* out of a crowd), and textures are largely either ignored or computer generated in a really sloppy way. In the first sequence, we thought that the savior warriors were angels or spirits because their horses seemed to be hovering over a stream of water - but as it turns out, it was just a really badly rendered road that had been computer generated by someone who apparently didn't know what they were doing and made it too smooth, flowing, and blue. Later, it's impossible to tell whether some lumps in the distance are mountains rising out of land, or mountains obscured by clouds, or clouds in a blue sky. Very monochromatic, very bad texture work. It may or may not be authentic to the time period depicted - all I know is that if you're not already a fan, the art in this movie isn't going to make the impenetrable plot any more palatable.I would highly recommend skipping ""Kai Doh Maru"". This movie has English captions, which often do not match the English dubs, which is always annoying if you're hearing impaired like me.~ Ana Mardoll",1,"Not a movie, but an incredible simulation of one!",1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,3185,"['Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', '/', 'B00009MEJX', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'probably', 'unique', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'need', 'review', 'back', 'box', 'movie', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'back', 'box', 'actually', '*more*', 'information', 'actual', 'film', 'extremely', 'short', 'film', 'deeply', 'episodic', 'tiny', '2-3', 'minutes', 'vignette-like', 'shots', 'have', 'been', 'cobbled', 'together', 'simulation', 'movie', 'scene', 'two', 'ministers', 'talking', 'local', 'politics', 'scene', 'wagon', 'mysteriously', 'captured', 'children', 'scene', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'trees', 'losing', 'blossoms', 'wind', 'scene', 'monastery', 'where', 'local', 'warriors', 'train', 'short', 'scenes', 'fail', 'tie', 'together', 'meaningful', 'way', 'relate', 'way', 'story', 'outline', 'back', 'box', 'never', 'fully', 'realize', 'story', 'resembling', 'instead', 'unfinished', 'storyboard', 'needed', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'fleshing', 'out.Which', 'not', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'interesting', 'enigmatic', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'episodicDarkside', 'Bluesfor', 'experimental', 'artistic', 'nature', 'nothing', 'else', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'so', 'disjointed', 'disconnected', 'almost', 'impossible', 'allow', 'kind', 'immersion', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'less', 'minute', 'kind', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'nothing', 'hold', 'interest', 'artwork', 'opinion', 'pretty', 'poor.Which', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'praised', 'artwork', 'redeeming', 'value', 'cases', 'entire', 'point', 'film', 'maybe', ""'re"", '*huge*', 'enthusiast', 'time', 'period', 'artwork', 'might', 'give', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'anime', 'buff', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'prerequisite', 'schooling', 'appreciate', 'style', 'then', 'artwork', 'will', 'seem', 'very', 'bland', 'amateurish', 'very', 'little', 'color', 'movie', 'occasional', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'shot', 'people', 'look', 'two-dimensional', 'are', 'impossible', 'distinguish', 'one', 'was', 'grateful', 'one', 'warriors', 'had', 'eye', 'patch', 'could', 'least', 'pick', '*him*', 'crowd', 'textures', 'are', 'largely', 'either', 'ignored', 'computer', 'generated', 'really', 'sloppy', 'way', 'first', 'sequence', 'thought', 'savior', 'warriors', 'were', 'angels', 'spirits', 'horses', 'seemed', 'be', 'hovering', 'stream', 'water', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'badly', 'rendered', 'road', 'had', 'been', 'computer', 'generated', 'someone', 'who', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'made', 'too', 'smooth', 'flowing', 'blue', 'Later', 'impossible', 'tell', 'lumps', 'distance', 'are', 'mountains', 'rising', 'land', 'mountains', 'obscured', 'clouds', 'clouds', 'blue', 'sky', 'Very', 'monochromatic', 'very', 'bad', 'texture', 'work', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'authentic', 'time', 'period', 'depicted', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'art', 'movie', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'impenetrable', 'plot', 'more', 'palatable.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'movie', 'English', 'captions', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'English', 'dubs', 'always', 'annoying', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'impaired', 'me.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Kai Doh Maru
754743,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B00009MEJX,Amber,"[4, 5]","I have long been interested in Japanese history, and so when I found this for a good price in Media Play I made the decision to buy it. I have not regretted that decision one bit.I will admit that the filter over the film makes it difficult to look at after a while, but I appreciate what the makers were trying to do. It is made to look sort of like an old watercolor, and that really just adds to it's charm.The dialogue is consistent with the speech patterns you would expect to hear in a period drama. There is some haiku thrown in, which is also historically correct, as that was how many types of people communicated. Granted, my own exposure to poetry being used as formal communication is with lovers from the period, but it still gives the film an authentic feel for me.The characters are admirable. Kintoki is a strong, confident young girl who knows her place in her chosen world, and is happy being there. Her love for her commander/rescuer is merely implied, not stated. But that is how things were back then, so there is another point in the historical aspect's favor. Her cousin comes across as someone who is not entirely sure what to do with what she wants--she knows what she desires, but it doesn't seem as though she has thought everything through. The leader of the Knights is an eminently likable person, and I felt myself drawn to him as well.The art is fantastic. The backgrounds are done with ancient paintings in mind, and you can clearly see that, especially with the gardens and forests. The fight scenes rival those in Kenshin.And I actually found the character designs quite pleasing to look at.The music is more like what you would have heard then as well. While not the most pleasing sound at times, it is still appropriate.When all is said and down, I enjoyed this.

The story line had me interested, however it just ended, leaving me wanting more!!  I also got the impression that this was supposed to be the begining of a series, but it was not to be true.  I'm just still really confused to why it ended where it did, it had soo much potential to be somthing truly magnificant, yet it fell short with ending the movie where they did...The style of animation that they used was truly amazing, this is the thing I liked most about this movie.  I think that IG Plus / Production IG team did a great job of capturing the look and feel of the Japan's Heian era.  Though I was obviously not around during these times, I really think they really captured how things would have looked during that time period.  I loved how everything appeared to have a foggy-haze sourounding it and how the characters would sort of glow in the moonlight.  The animations reminded me a of a old style painting, which I believe is what the production team was aiming for.The story, though historical and interesting, was just missing something at the end.  The story just all the sudden ended, and I still am pondering what could have been.  Truly, though the story lines were completly different, this movie reminded me alot of another IG Plus / Production IG realese, &quot;Blood, The Last Vampire&quot;. Both are visual masterpieces in their own unique way, and that both have great potential story lines that just end in the middle of the story!!  It kind of upsets me that this is the second time that this production team has done this because of the fact that the story lines had potential.  This is also the production team that did one of my all time favorite Anime Movies (not to be confused with my favorite series)&quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;.  I really think that Kai Doh Maru needed just another 10 to 15 minutes to wrap up the story line and it could have turned an OK Anime short story into a great animated movie that takes place in an interesting time in Japanese History.Overall I enjoyed watching this DVD untill the credits started rolling, that just pissed me off!!  If watched with an open mind I think you might agree that this particular style of probably one of the most unique styles used in anime.  Remember, just keep an opened mind and don't start to compare the style of to your favorite anime movie or series because Kai Doh Maru's style is UNIQUE and truely one of a kind.....If the ending of Blood the Last Vampire did not bother you too much, then I would highly recomend buying this dvd....",4,STUNNING ANIMATION missing ending of the story......,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,2619,"['gave', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'mainly', 'style', 'animation', 'was', 'used', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'interested', 'however', 'just', 'ended', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'also', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'begining', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'true', ""'m"", 'just', 'still', 'really', 'confused', 'why', 'ended', 'where', 'did', 'had', 'soo', 'much', 'potential', 'be', 'somthing', 'truly', 'magnificant', 'fell', 'short', 'ending', 'movie', 'where', 'did', 'style', 'animation', 'used', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'think', 'IG', 'Plus', '/', 'Production', 'IG', 'team', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'look', 'feel', 'Japan', 'Heian', 'era', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'times', 'really', 'think', 'really', 'captured', 'how', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'time', 'period', 'loved', 'how', 'everything', 'appeared', 'have', 'foggy-haze', 'sourounding', 'how', 'characters', 'would', 'sort', 'glow', 'moonlight', 'animations', 'reminded', 'old', 'style', 'painting', 'believe', 'what', 'production', 'team', 'was', 'aiming', 'for.The', 'story', 'historical', 'interesting', 'was', 'just', 'missing', 'something', 'end', 'story', 'just', 'sudden', 'ended', 'still', 'am', 'pondering', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Truly', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'completly', 'different', 'movie', 'reminded', 'alot', 'IG', '/', 'Production', 'IG', 'realese', 'quot', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'quot', 'are', 'visual', 'masterpieces', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'have', 'great', 'potential', 'story', 'lines', 'just', 'end', 'middle', 'story', 'kind', 'upsets', 'second', 'time', 'production', 'team', 'done', 'fact', 'story', 'lines', 'had', 'potential', 'also', 'production', 'team', 'did', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'Anime', 'Movies', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'favorite', 'series', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'quot', 'really', 'think', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'needed', 'just', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'wrap', 'up', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'OK', 'Anime', 'short', 'story', 'great', 'animated', 'movie', 'place', 'interesting', 'time', 'Japanese', 'History.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'credits', 'started', 'rolling', 'just', 'pissed', 'off', 'watched', 'open', 'mind', 'think', 'might', 'agree', 'particular', 'style', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'styles', 'used', 'anime', 'Remember', 'just', 'keep', 'opened', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'compare', 'style', 'favorite', 'anime', 'movie', 'series', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'style', 'UNIQUE', 'truely', 'one', 'kind', 'ending', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'recomend', 'buying', 'dvd']",Kai Doh Maru

The subtext lends an undercurrent (or is it an overcurrent?) of obsession to the villainess's motives, and makes her perhaps the most complex Japanese villainess since Throne of Blood's Lady Washizu.Yes, this one ends suddenly, but that adds an air of tension that would be lacking if we knew what came next.

It comes from Production IG, the studio responsible for 'Blood - the Last Vampire' and 'Ghost in the Shell.'  But unlike those anime and others intended for large public exposure, 'Kai Doh Maru' is a far more intimate creation, curiously low key for a tale with this much violence.  Intended more as artistic expression than high profile.The story is set in the late 9th Century in the Heian capital of Kyoto.  Action revolves around Kintoki Sakata, the Kai Doh Maru.  When an envious uncle wiped out her branch of the Sakata clan, Kintoki escaped and was finally rescued by Lord Raiko Minamoto who is the captain of the Four Knights of the defense ministry.  Kintoki has always been a tomboy, and now she sets out to be a warrior, one of Raiko's right hand 'men.'The overt theme is the political conflict already brewing between the Minamoto and the Taira.  Doji Ibaragi is a mad swordsman who serves Kintoki's cousin, Hime Ohni.  He uses Hime's own compulsive desire for Kintoki to manipulate events into a crisis.  The true theme, amidst the whirl of fighting and betrayal, is Kintoki's fatal effects on the lives of those that love her.This is all told with the terse minimalism that the Japanese often seem to relish.  The ending is sudden, and difficult to grasp.  I found it jarring in its sudden tragedy, and I expect that many watchers will feel that 'Kai Doh Maru' is much too short.  The film cries out for more detail and character development.Yet, as an art piece, this film is outstanding.  Colors and graphic style have been chosen to recall Heian artistic forms.  The images of the capital and characters will stay with you for some time.  And the fight chorography is nothing short of remarkable.  It all makes the abruptness of the telling forgivable.

754751,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00009MEJX,Sesho,"[6, 17]","This anime was awful. The back of the dvd case actually give you more informative information on the backstory than the feature itself. Its set in the Heian era of Japan in which different political factions, organized gangs, and hereditary rulers were all vying for power. Kintoki is a young girl raised as a boy whose parents are murdered by her uncle and she is next except she is rescued by Raiko, the captain of the &quot;Four Knights&quot;, an elite guard of the city of Kyo. She is raised as a samurai and as she reaches the age of 17, she is an equal partner in the defense of the city. Thats when a sorceress, unaware that Kintoki is a woman and is consequently in love with her comes to stir up chaos and death.Why was this dvd awful? The same people that created Kai Dah Maru created Blood The Last Vampire. That movie was too short. The storyline was very simple so that its brevity didn't interfere with the enjoyment of it that much. The same does not hold true for this movie. You have all these complex intrigues and assasinations and backstory and presentstory and you're cramming it into 45 minutes. Think of any anime series ending after its second episode and you'll understand the problem here. I am not ignorant of Japanese history but I really never understood what was going on in this story. You really can't even figure out who is who character-wise until the show is over. It's like they were trying to do Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the space of 20 minutes. Truly awful. No development.In addition to the shortness of the feature, the animation was sorry. I know by reading the cover that the palette was supposed to be influenced by the art of the time period and all this seasonal blah blah blah. What you get is the effect of watching the entire anime through a fog. Picture being in a theater watching a movie through a haze of smoke. Also, during the action scenes, the frames shake in a pitiful attempt to simulate a hand held camera. All it looks like to me is scrolling up and down on a computer screen.This movie was a total disaster. One guy gets his arm cut off and instead of bleeding to death on the spot, he jumps onto a roof and, as he escapes, yells to his amputator &quot;I won't forget your face!!&quot; The CGI used in this movie also stinks. It does not blend into the scenes. It's like every small flaw in Blood was taken and expanded upon by this anime. In the future, I would suggest that the makers, if they continue to make 45 minute movies, should stick to stories that are simple and that can fit into their time restraints.There are a lot of extras on this dvd but I didn't look at them because I hated the movie so much what was the point?",1,WORST ANIME I HAVE EVER SEEN,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,2702,"['anime', 'was', 'awful', 'back', 'dvd', 'case', 'actually', 'give', 'more', 'informative', 'information', 'backstory', 'feature', 'set', 'Heian', 'era', 'Japan', 'different', 'political', 'factions', 'organized', 'gangs', 'hereditary', 'rulers', 'were', 'vying', 'power', 'Kintoki', 'young', 'girl', 'raised', 'boy', 'parents', 'are', 'murdered', 'uncle', 'next', 'rescued', 'Raiko', 'captain', 'quot', 'Four', 'Knights', 'quot', 'elite', 'guard', 'city', 'Kyo', 'raised', 'samurai', 'age', '17', 'equal', 'partner', 'defense', 'city', 'Thats', 'when', 'sorceress', 'unaware', 'Kintoki', 'woman', 'consequently', 'love', 'stir', 'up', 'chaos', 'death.Why', 'was', 'dvd', 'awful', 'same', 'people', 'created', 'Kai', 'Dah', 'Maru', 'created', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'storyline', 'was', 'very', 'simple', 'brevity', 'did', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'enjoyment', 'much', 'same', 'not', 'hold', 'true', 'movie', 'have', 'complex', 'intrigues', 'assasinations', 'backstory', 'presentstory', ""'re"", 'cramming', '45', 'minutes', 'Think', 'anime', 'series', 'ending', 'second', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'problem', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'ignorant', 'Japanese', 'history', 'really', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'story', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'who', 'character-wise', 'show', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'space', '20', 'minutes', 'Truly', 'awful', 'development.In', 'addition', 'shortness', 'feature', 'animation', 'was', 'sorry', 'know', 'reading', 'cover', 'palette', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'influenced', 'art', 'time', 'period', 'seasonal', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'What', 'get', 'effect', 'watching', 'entire', 'anime', 'fog', 'Picture', 'being', 'theater', 'watching', 'movie', 'haze', 'smoke', 'Also', 'action', 'scenes', 'frames', 'shake', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'simulate', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'scrolling', 'up', 'down', 'computer', 'screen.This', 'movie', 'was', 'total', 'disaster', 'One', 'guy', 'arm', 'cut', 'off', 'instead', 'bleeding', 'death', 'spot', 'roof', 'yells', 'amputator', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'face', 'quot', 'CGI', 'used', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'blend', 'scenes', 'small', 'flaw', 'Blood', 'was', 'taken', 'expanded', 'upon', 'anime', 'future', 'would', 'suggest', 'makers', 'continue', 'make', '45', 'minute', 'movies', 'should', 'stick', 'stories', 'are', 'simple', 'can', 'fit', 'time', 'are', 'lot', 'extras', 'dvd', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'hated', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'point']",Kai Doh Maru
754752,AJ6XR403WY88M,B00009MEJX,"Sniff Code ""www.sniffcode.com""","[1, 1]","Whenever I come away from anim&eacute; or any foreign film scratching my head, I am always suspicious if my perplexity is due to cultural barriers. Kai Doh Maru begins as a promising movie, but as the plot unravels my mind somehow got completely tangled by a confusing storyline and unclear characters.It's difficult to give a plot synopsis since I'm not exactly sure about what I watched. But it seems like the story has something to do with one group of soldiers training a young girl, Kintoki, to be a warrior; and another group who has some counter-agenda that involves her. There's a love story in here somewhere, too. Sorry, but that's all I got. I suppose for more information read the plot synopsis on the packaging.Having said that, of all the incomprehensible films, I was actually able to finish this one; and for two reasons: One, it's only 40 minutes long. Had it been much longer, I probably would have hit the eject button. But if complicated ambiguity is a writers style, I suppose the successful lesson here is to not keep your audience in their seats for very long. The other reason I got through this is that the art is fantastic. The subdued colors make the scenes of blood spatter all the more real. When the action happens, I'm never quite sure why it has happened, but oh well...that didn't prevent me from being fully engrossed by some high energy and wildly poetic fighting sequences. There's some neck slicing that has so much grit that it rivals any live action equivalents.Strangely, I feel compelled to re-watch this movie and see if one or two more viewings won't crack open this cryptic storyline. Something tells me that once I ""get it"", I'll find myself praising it as a hard earned classic. If not, it can at least be excused as the mess that is often accumulated and left around by brilliant minds.",4,The Most Beautiful Mess I've Ever Seen,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,1833,"['Whenever', 'come', 'away', 'anim', 'eacute', 'foreign', 'film', 'scratching', 'head', 'am', 'always', 'suspicious', 'perplexity', 'due', 'cultural', 'barriers', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'promising', 'movie', 'plot', 'unravels', 'mind', 'somehow', 'got', 'completely', 'tangled', 'confusing', 'storyline', 'unclear', 'characters.It', 'difficult', 'give', 'plot', 'synopsis', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'watched', 'story', 'something', 'do', 'one', 'group', 'soldiers', 'training', 'young', 'girl', 'Kintoki', 'be', 'warrior', 'group', 'who', 'counter-agenda', 'love', 'story', 'here', 'somewhere', 'too', 'Sorry', 'got', 'suppose', 'more', 'information', 'read', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'packaging.Having', 'said', 'incomprehensible', 'films', 'was', 'actually', 'able', 'finish', 'one', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'only', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'Had', 'been', 'much', 'longer', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'hit', 'eject', 'button', 'complicated', 'ambiguity', 'writers', 'style', 'suppose', 'successful', 'lesson', 'here', 'not', 'keep', 'audience', 'seats', 'very', 'long', 'other', 'reason', 'got', 'art', 'fantastic', 'subdued', 'colors', 'make', 'scenes', 'blood', 'spatter', 'more', 'real', 'When', 'action', ""'m"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'happened', 'oh', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'being', 'fully', 'engrossed', 'high', 'energy', 'wildly', 'poetic', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'neck', 'slicing', 'so', 'much', 'grit', 'live', 'action', 'equivalents.Strangely', 'feel', 'compelled', 're-watch', 'movie', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'viewings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'crack', 'open', 'cryptic', 'storyline', 'Something', 'tells', 'once', 'get', ""'ll"", 'find', 'praising', 'hard', 'earned', 'classic', 'not', 'can', 'least', 'be', 'excused', 'mess', 'often', 'accumulated', 'left', 'around', 'brilliant', 'minds']",Kai Doh Maru

They are slick and innovative in their animation, but lack basic storytelling skills necessary to make great animators.  Their first release, ""Blood: The Last Vampire,"" could be forgiven as a rookie attempt, but their sophomore film ""Kai Doh Maru"" unfortunately replicates the same errors.  At a little over 40 minutes, this isn't a feature or even an intro to a continuing series.""Kai Doh Maru"" is beautiful.  That much is certain.  Production IG is not afraid to take risks and push the boundaries of raw animation, playing with muting filters, color pallets, pencil techniques and various other technologies that create a unique look for their films.  With ""Kai Doh Maru,"" they have sought to capture the look of antique Japanese art, with an emphasis on browns and other neutral tones.  The CG blending with Cel animation is somewhat less artfully done, and stands out in each scene.  Still, it is nice to see Heian era Japan so fully dimensional.The story, such as it is, is just a skeleton of plot to stitch together the visuals.  As with ""Blood: The Last Vampire,"" one has the distinct sense that the character designs came first, and then a plot was constructed to bring them together.  A female warrior, Kintoki, is on the run from a power-mad Uncle.  Rescued by Raiko of ""The Four Knights,"" she begins to question her masculine nature.  From there, incomprehensible villains appear and are defeated, and a strange semi-supernatural woman seeks Kintoki to be her lover.  It is a confusing mess, and hardly able to be realized in the 45 minutes allotted to the film.The special features on the DVD are greater than are actually warranted by the feature, clocking in at almost the same length as ""Kai Doh Maru.""  For someone interested in the intimate mechanics of animation, these features might be of great interest.  Personally, I could not sit through them all, as disappointed as I was with the main story.",3,45 Minutes of Artful Confusion,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,2002,"['animation', 'group', 'Production', 'IG', 'understand', 'style', 'not', 'substance', 'are', 'slick', 'innovative', 'animation', 'lack', 'basic', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'necessary', 'make', 'great', 'animators', 'first', 'release', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'rookie', 'attempt', 'sophomore', 'film', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'unfortunately', 'same', 'errors', 'little', '40', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'feature', 'even', 'intro', 'continuing', 'series', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'beautiful', 'much', 'certain', 'Production', 'IG', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'push', 'boundaries', 'raw', 'animation', 'playing', 'muting', 'filters', 'color', 'pallets', 'pencil', 'techniques', 'various', 'other', 'technologies', 'create', 'unique', 'look', 'films', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'have', 'sought', 'capture', 'look', 'antique', 'Japanese', 'art', 'emphasis', 'browns', 'other', 'neutral', 'tones', 'CG', 'blending', 'Cel', 'animation', 'somewhat', 'less', 'artfully', 'done', 'out', 'scene', 'Still', 'nice', 'see', 'Heian', 'era', 'Japan', 'so', 'fully', 'dimensional.The', 'story', 'such', 'just', 'skeleton', 'plot', 'stitch', 'together', 'visuals', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'one', 'distinct', 'sense', 'character', 'designs', 'came', 'first', 'then', 'plot', 'was', 'constructed', 'bring', 'together', 'female', 'warrior', 'Kintoki', 'run', 'power-mad', 'Uncle', 'Rescued', 'Raiko', 'Four', 'Knights', 'question', 'masculine', 'nature', 'there', 'incomprehensible', 'villains', 'appear', 'are', 'defeated', 'strange', 'semi-supernatural', 'woman', 'Kintoki', 'be', 'lover', 'confusing', 'mess', 'hardly', 'able', 'be', 'realized', '45', 'minutes', 'allotted', 'film.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'greater', 'are', 'actually', 'warranted', 'feature', 'clocking', 'almost', 'same', 'length', 'Kai', 'Doh', 'Maru', 'someone', 'interested', 'intimate', 'mechanics', 'animation', 'features', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'interest', 'Personally', 'could', 'not', 'sit', 'as', 'disappointed', 'was', 'main', 'story']",Kai Doh Maru
