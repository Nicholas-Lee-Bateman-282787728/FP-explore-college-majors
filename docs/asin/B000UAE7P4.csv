1094399,A38JTHKCYF9JWQ,B000UAE7P4,James A. Freeman,"[5, 12]","The movie arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition.  The movie itself was not as great as some of the reviews indicated.  First, Jonathan's ""miracle"" was not much of one.  There is an implication that he went to church, but there is no personal confession of faith from his lips and neither does he repent for his lack of trust of God or the time He has spent disobeying him by keeping to himself without serving Him and forsaking the assembling together of the saints as the book of Hebrews forbids.  The end is abrupt and leaves you feeling a bit unfulfilled, as if something more of a summation or conclusion was wanting.Also, the son's bad attitude is not really dealt with much.  The mother and son presumably have faith in God since the nativity set was so important to them, but there is not much evidence of same in how they act and interact throughout the movie.Over all, the movie is family friendly, but I'd say some discernment should be used when watching with your kiddos and some poignant questions would be appropriate afterward to address what is wrong both spiritually, theologically and behaviorally.  For example, ""What should Mr. Toomey have done in response to losing his wife and child?"" and ""What comfort could the boy's mother have taken and given to her son in light of what happened?""",3,Movie So-so; Arrived in Good Condition,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,1320,"['movie', 'arrived', 'timely', 'fashion', 'good', 'condition', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'reviews', 'indicated', 'First', 'Jonathan', 'miracle', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'implication', 'went', 'church', 'personal', 'confession', 'faith', 'lips', 'neither', 'repent', 'lack', 'trust', 'God', 'time', 'spent', 'disobeying', 'keeping', 'serving', 'Him', 'forsaking', 'assembling', 'together', 'saints', 'book', 'Hebrews', 'forbids', 'end', 'abrupt', 'feeling', 'bit', 'unfulfilled', 'something', 'more', 'summation', 'conclusion', 'was', 'wanting.Also', 'son', 'bad', 'attitude', 'not', 'really', 'dealt', 'much', 'mother', 'son', 'presumably', 'have', 'faith', 'God', 'nativity', 'set', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'not', 'much', 'evidence', 'same', 'how', 'act', 'interact', 'movie.Over', 'movie', 'family', 'friendly', ""'d"", 'say', 'discernment', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'when', 'watching', 'kiddos', 'poignant', 'questions', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'afterward', 'address', 'what', 'wrong', 'spiritually', 'theologically', 'behaviorally', 'example', 'What', 'should', 'Mr.', 'Toomey', 'have', 'done', 'response', 'losing', 'wife', 'child', 'What', 'comfort', 'could', 'boy', 'mother', 'have', 'taken', 'given', 'son', 'light', 'what', 'happened']",The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey

1094406,AW5LNZBFQAOWM,B000UAE7P4,"Noir Man ""Foggy Dude""","[48, 48]","Whereas I might not use this term so often to refer to a movie I will now in writing that this Christmas film is warm, actually in many ways:  The musical score has a fullness and soul that immediately welcomes you into the story; the colors and set designs are literally ""earthy"" and gorgeous as the mother and boy take many walks through the forest to arrive at Mr. Toomey's home; the importance of silence (as Mr. Toomey advocates often to the boy) allows the viewer to think and feel to greater depths than your average splice and cut/edited movie.The acting is solid, especially behind Tom Berenger in an anticipated role-departure from the likes of ""Platoon"" or ""Sniper"".  He plays the grieving, not-quite-living recluse of the film's title...and to see him slowly come out of his shell behind the gentle presence and love of the mother and son is very touching, to say the least.  And this brings me to my one critique of the film: the final opening up of Mr. Toomey is so dramatically quick (even the back of the DVD case shows Mr. Toomey singing in church next to the mother and son...did I miss that?  I don't think so).  It WOULD have been nice to see that scene as part of the re-awakening of Mr. Toomey; why wasn't that in the picture?  My point is that the film beautifully depicts the depressed woodworker slowly but surely rising out of his soulful cave only to kind of burst out at the end...suddenly he's coming out of church and the mother suddenly sees him??  A suggestion: Why not have a quick clip of him perhaps shyly entering the worship service and people being surprised and warmly accepting him there?  Why not a little more transition to fill out the viewing experience ""with"" the characters in the story?  The magic of the previous 1 hour and 20 minutes came up too quick and short.  To that end I was disappointed and left wanting....to be even more touched by Mr. Toomey's transformation.  Alas, that did not ruin the film.No one told me of this film, I just happened upon it while I was cruising through Amazon.  What a good, good find.  A probable annual Christmas tradition of viewing for years to come.

I'd forgotten what a delightful movie it is!Based on the book by Susan Wojciechowski, ""The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"" is a movie of the value of family and of new beginnings. Thomas has recently lost his father in the War. When he and his mother move to the country from their upscale city home, Thomas finds it difficult to adjust.  How will he ever survive without his father? And to make matters worse, Thomas accidentally left the beautiful Nativity Scene figurines at the train stop. Figurines that are a reminder of the Christmases past with his father.Jonathan Toomey is no stranger to grief. Having lost his wife and child, he shuts himself out from the world, and instead is content to hide behind the doors of his rented cabin carving items to sell at the local shop. Some of the children in town mock him including calling him ""Gloomy Toomey"" and throw pebbles at his home. Rumors abound when the children make up stories about just what it is that Mr. Toomey does.When the paths of Thomas, his mother, and Mr. Toomey cross, lives change. Can those who have lost the most find true happiness again?This is a wonderful movie with themes of not judging others (Luke 6:37; Matthew 7:1), caring for those less fortunate , and doing to others as you would have done to you (Matthew 7:12). It is a story of healing with some humor dabbled in and some refreshing scenes about the importance of family. It's a film you'll want to add to your annual Christmas collection.This movie contains nothing objectionable, and I would highly recommend ""The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey"" for all ages.This review was first published on, and has been added to, my mom-approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.",5,Delightful Movie for the Entire Family!,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,1818,"['first', 'watched', 'movie', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'recently', 'watched', 'other', 'night', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'what', 'delightful', 'movie', 'Based', 'book', 'Susan', 'Wojciechowski', 'Christmas', 'Miracle', 'Jonathan', 'Toomey', 'movie', 'value', 'family', 'new', 'beginnings', 'Thomas', 'recently', 'lost', 'father', 'War', 'When', 'mother', 'move', 'country', 'upscale', 'city', 'home', 'Thomas', 'difficult', 'adjust', 'How', 'will', 'ever', 'survive', 'father', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Thomas', 'accidentally', 'left', 'beautiful', 'Nativity', 'Scene', 'figurines', 'train', 'stop', 'Figurines', 'are', 'reminder', 'Christmases', 'past', 'father.Jonathan', 'Toomey', 'stranger', 'grief', 'Having', 'lost', 'wife', 'child', 'world', 'instead', 'content', 'hide', 'doors', 'rented', 'cabin', 'carving', 'items', 'sell', 'local', 'shop', 'children', 'town', 'mock', 'including', 'calling', 'Gloomy', 'Toomey', 'throw', 'pebbles', 'home', 'Rumors', 'when', 'children', 'make', 'up', 'stories', 'just', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Toomey', 'paths', 'Thomas', 'mother', 'Mr.', 'Toomey', 'cross', 'change', 'Can', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'most', 'find', 'true', 'happiness', 'again', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'themes', 'not', 'judging', 'others', 'Luke', '6:37', 'Matthew', '7:1', 'caring', 'less', 'fortunate', 'doing', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Matthew', '7:12', 'story', 'healing', 'humor', 'dabbled', 'refreshing', 'scenes', 'importance', 'family', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'add', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'collection.This', 'movie', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Christmas', 'Miracle', 'Jonathan', 'Toomey', 'ages.This', 'review', 'was', 'first', 'published', 'been', 'added', 'mom-approved', 'movie', 'listing', 'wordpress', 'blog']",The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey

It talks about the value of silence and other traits that are somewhat foreign to our modern culture.This is a different type of Christmas movie that is a joy to savor and reflect upon.",4,Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,725,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'hermit', 'unfriendly', 'man', 'amazing', 'talent', 'wood', 'carving', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'young', 'widow', 'young', 'son', 'contract', 'hermit', 'Toomey', 'make', 'nativity', 'set', 'developing', 'relationship', 'man', 'mysterious', 'past', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'never', 'showed', 'what', 'mysterious', 'past', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'it.This', 'story', 'wonderful', 'character', 'slower', 'paced', 'time', 'family', 'who', 'Christmas', 'truly', 'special', 'very', 'hard', 'circumstances', 'value', 'silence', 'other', 'traits', 'are', 'somewhat', 'foreign', 'modern', 'culture.This', 'different', 'type', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'joy', 'savor', 'reflect', 'upon']",The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey
