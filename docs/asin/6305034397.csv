Quite nicely. Fine writing, laugh out loud funny situational comedy, many supporting actors and actresses who I recognized from elsewhere, funny hair, clever satire, solid content, garishly colorful clothes you have to love laughing at. At last I understand why Simon and Garfunkel, who I like, are so overrated. Anne Bancroft immediately became every schoolboy's fantasy, and Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in the starring role. I chose not to have sex as a teenager or a pre-teenager. But seeing Hoffman as a recent university graduate, all I could think was, ""Damn, that kid needs to get laid."" Even after he got laid.

444659,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305034397,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`The Graduate' is by far one of my favorite movies ever made; maybe top ten, at least top twenty (I never imagined how hard it would be to compile a list of fifty films); the point being that it is pure genius.  Director Mike Nichols takes Calder Willingham's screenplay (based off of Charles Webb's novel of the same name) and delivers it to us with a delicate yet subtle brazenness that adds layers of emotional weight and clarity to the film.  Couple that with a slew of fantastic performances by just about everyone in the cast and you have a film that is legendary, classic and frankly `important' in the catalogue of cinematic achievements.`The Graduate' tells us the story of young Benjamin Braddock who is just that, a college graduate.  Upon returning home to a life undecided Benjamin finds himself being pursued by the older, beautiful and married Mrs. Robinson.  There is no denying that Benjamin is intrigued by the proposition but he is awkwardly hesitant.  Temptation can only lay undisturbed for a short time and soon Benjamin is entertaining her pursuits and falls into a full-fledged affair with Mrs. Robinson.  His life is finally starting to interest him, and then a corkscrew is thrown in the mix.  Mr. Robinson wants Benjamin to take out their teenage daughter Elaine.  When Benjamin falls in love with her his world starts to unravel as Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose their affair in an effort to keep him away from her daughter.What make this movie so iconic are the marvelous performances by the entire cast, Hoffman and Bancroft especially.  Anne Bancroft is marvelous as the seductive and manipulative Mrs. Robinson; a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it.  She very comfortable slides into character and single handedly created a character that will go down in history as one of the most recognizable and memorable screen vixens.  Dustin Hoffman is marvelous here, truly outstanding.  Benjamin Braddock was his breakthrough and garnered him his first Oscar nomination, which should have been his first win.  His handling of Braddock's awkward shyness (even his audition was an awkward mess) was phenomenal.  He became Benjamin, lived and breathed him, and really delivered in a way that no other actor could have.  I'm often reminded of this performance when I watch Jake Gyllenhaal act, for Gyllenhaal has that same awkwardness about him as Hoffman possesses in this role (maybe that says good things for Gyllenhaal).The rest of the cast excels as well, especially Katherine Ross, who plays Elaine.  She is welcoming and vivacious and everything a man could want, thus adding to the believability that Benjamin would chose her over her aggressive mother.  Murray Hamilton is great as Mr. Robinson, even if he is underused and William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson deliver as well as Benjamin's parents.`The Graduate' is one of those films that defined a generation.  It's a film that captured everything that made the 60's what it was and created a standard for all other films approaching this genre to live up to.  The feeling of the film, the fluidity, the casting; everything down to the music (Simon and Garfunkel were a prime choice) come together beautifully to help embellish the riches springing forth from `The Graduate'.In the end I must declare that everyone should see this iconic film.  There are so few true gems in this world, so few films that are undeniably splendid.  Even when compiling my list of favorite films I come to realize that many of them are purely of my own opinion; but `The Graduate' is one of those movies that is universally lauded and adored; a film that we call all agree is truly one of the very best.",5,A film that graduates at the head of its class...,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,3689,"['Graduate', 'far', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'maybe', 'top', 'ten', 'least', 'top', 'twenty', 'never', 'imagined', 'how', 'hard', 'would', 'be', 'compile', 'list', 'fifty', 'films', 'point', 'being', 'pure', 'genius', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Calder', 'Willingham', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Charles', 'Webb', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'delicate', 'yet', 'subtle', 'brazenness', 'layers', 'emotional', 'weight', 'clarity', 'film', 'Couple', 'slew', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'just', 'everyone', 'cast', 'have', 'film', 'legendary', 'classic', 'frankly', 'important', 'catalogue', 'cinematic', 'achievements.', 'Graduate', 'tells', 'story', 'young', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'who', 'just', 'that', 'college', 'graduate', 'returning', 'home', 'life', 'undecided', 'Benjamin', 'being', 'pursued', 'older', 'beautiful', 'married', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'denying', 'Benjamin', 'intrigued', 'proposition', 'awkwardly', 'hesitant', 'Temptation', 'can', 'only', 'lay', 'undisturbed', 'short', 'time', 'soon', 'Benjamin', 'entertaining', 'pursuits', 'full-fledged', 'affair', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'life', 'finally', 'starting', 'interest', 'then', 'corkscrew', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Mr.', 'Robinson', 'Benjamin', 'take', 'out', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'When', 'Benjamin', 'love', 'world', 'unravel', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'expose', 'affair', 'effort', 'keep', 'away', 'daughter.What', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'iconic', 'are', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Hoffman', 'Bancroft', 'especially', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'marvelous', 'seductive', 'manipulative', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'woman', 'who', 'what', 'how', 'get', 'very', 'comfortable', 'slides', 'character', 'single', 'handedly', 'created', 'character', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'most', 'recognizable', 'memorable', 'screen', 'vixens', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'marvelous', 'here', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'garnered', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'win', 'handling', 'Braddock', 'awkward', 'shyness', 'even', 'audition', 'was', 'awkward', 'mess', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'became', 'Benjamin', 'lived', 'breathed', 'really', 'delivered', 'way', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', ""'m"", 'often', 'reminded', 'performance', 'when', 'watch', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'act', 'Gyllenhaal', 'same', 'awkwardness', 'about', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'maybe', 'good', 'things', 'Gyllenhaal', '.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'excels', 'well', 'especially', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'who', 'Elaine', 'welcoming', 'vivacious', 'everything', 'man', 'could', 'want', 'thus', 'adding', 'believability', 'Benjamin', 'would', 'chose', 'aggressive', 'mother', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Robinson', 'even', 'underused', 'William', 'Daniels', 'Elizabeth', 'Wilson', 'deliver', 'as', 'well', 'Benjamin', 'parents.', 'Graduate', 'one', 'films', 'defined', 'generation', 'film', 'captured', 'everything', 'made', '60', 'what', 'was', 'created', 'standard', 'other', 'films', 'approaching', 'genre', 'live', 'up', 'feeling', 'film', 'fluidity', 'casting', 'everything', 'down', 'music', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'were', 'prime', 'choice', 'come', 'together', 'beautifully', 'help', 'embellish', 'riches', 'springing', 'forth', ""Graduate'.In"", 'end', 'must', 'declare', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'iconic', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'true', 'gems', 'world', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'undeniably', 'splendid', 'Even', 'when', 'compiling', 'list', 'favorite', 'films', 'come', 'realize', 'many', 'are', 'purely', 'own', 'opinion', 'Graduate', 'one', 'movies', 'universally', 'lauded', 'adored', 'film', 'call', 'agree', 'truly', 'one', 'very', 'best']",The Graduate

444662,ARA48345JZPZR,6305034397,Archmaker,"[2, 3]","This was one of the transforming movies of my youth. It captured the angst a lot of us felt, knowing that we didn't want the seemingly empty material values we were supposed to want, but not knowing what the hell it was that we DID want. That this is a universal dilemma of young adulthood is why The Graduate still speaks to us.But, on seeing it now, it is so obviously of a very special time and place. Post 50's early 60's America in general, Southern California specifically. It was still an innocent America....the Viet Nam war isn't even mentioned. This is just on the cusp of pre-Hippie, pre-Yippie, pre-Chicago Convention, pre-Nixon, pre-Bobby &amp; Martin's assassinations but after John's. To see the movie now is to see another country, one that didn't exist for very long, and one that no longer exists. The world this movie depicts is about to explode, and Benjamin's dissatisfaction is a precursor to that which would fuel that explosion. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.Forget about that and just enjoy a tremendously funny and insightful film. Mike Nichols second directorial effort (and he went all out to make his bones) and the star-making breakout role for Dustin Hoffman. Ann Bancroft is wonderful, Katherine Ross delicious, Murray Hamilton very funny, and the rest of the cast perfect.A disaffected graduate scholar/athlete drifts into an affair with his father's partner's wife, and subsequently falls head-over-heels for the daughter. That's it, but what fun and great laughs are mined from this material. Just great classic scenes and dialogue, and emotions and situations that are timeless. And, of course, there was the brilliant idea to use Simon &amp; Garfunkel's music. The near-Hollywood ending is saved by the last shot....confusion and angst aren't that easily dispelled.

Well, actually I knew about Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson's relationship, as does everyone by now; I just didn't know how it ended.When we first meet him, Benjamin Braddock(Hoffman), having just returned home after finishing college, is trying to steal some time for himself away from his graduation party so that he can figure out what to do with his life next.  Who should come knocking but Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), who with the question, ""Would you like me to seduce you?"", proceeds to put him in the most uncomfortable position he's ever been in his life, literally and figuratively.  After Benjamin tries unsuccessfully to first have an intellectual conversation with Mrs. Robinson and then to break off the affair, his parents decide to set him up for his first date with the Robinsons' daughter, Elaine.  Mrs. Robinson expresses her disapproval and threatens to tell all if he dates Elaine a second time.  Ben finally goes to Berkeley, where Elaine is attending college, and convinces her to marry him on the spot---right up to the day when she's scheduled to marry someone else  The final climatic scene would be parodied and reproduced some twenty-seven years later in ""Wayne's World 2.""I took note especially of the cinematography in this movie.  In particular, whenever ""The Sounds of Silence"" or ""Scarborough Fair"" is heard, the images on the screen become surreal: images of reality mixed with what is going on inside Benjamin's imagination.

Erland,"[0, 0]","I can remember sitting through back to back showings of `The Graduate' in a now defunct Whittier theater when it was originally released in '67. I was a sophomore in high school at the time and as I remember there were several reasons why I put in the extra time to sit through a second viewing. One reason was to see that incredibly sexy night club stripper (Lainie Miller) perform again.  Hey, I was sixteen, raging hormones, you know the story. Anyway that was one reason. The other was because it was hilarious and there was so much laughing going on in the audience that I missed a lot of what was being said the first time. I had to see it again just to catch all the subtle jokes and comic nuances.Of course that was '67, how does `The Graduate' fair some 39 years later? Dustin Hoffman is still delightful as the nave and somewhat awkward Benjamin Braddock, while Katherine Ross remains as lovely as ever. However with that said, I must also admit that the film appears to have lost some of the comedic charm and emotional pathos it once possessed. Maybe it's not the film, maybe with the passing of years I've simply lost my connection with that sixties angst this movie so perfectly reflects. Sadly, even the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack that so enthralled me when I was a teenager now seems somewhat out of place and dated.I quess what I'm trying to convey is 'The Graduate' may not be quite the classic I once thought it was, but it doesn't miss by much.

Every word and frame carefully builds upon one another in a comedic drama that stains the bounds of reason.  Yet, in the world of the film, have a place due to effort leading to the moment and the way in which they're captured.  The continuity editing, done to an extent which rivals Kubrick, adds to the comedic effect as the viewer tries to laugh off the tension and &#34;agitation&#34; that characters can't seem to.The acting in the film is meant to be the accent, not the focus, of the film.  Granted, the situations and conversations had between characters often serves of the focal point, but even then the weight of it's commentary is only as strong as the world in which it occurs.  These are often subtle, which the film gives the viewer an opportunity (if not ample) to find it in the extended duration of the base sequences which comprise the film.As to it's place as the greatest of all films is yet to be determined.  It's critical value, however, cannot be denied.  Yes, Ben is an interesting person, but the constant focus on him creates a void in character development from the ensemble.  It does comment on Ben, or anyone's, extent which they can know a person.  This is just one the massive number of symbolic and cultural criticism that can be found in the film: whether its the world of the fish tank, the cage, the mind, or just another person.

I've been blown away by ""Taxi Driver"" (#47), ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (#5), and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""(#20) among others.  But although ""The Graduate"" is listed as the #7 all-time great movie, it just left me wondering what all of the accolades were about.I really enjoyed the first half of the flick, which was rife with offbeat comedy about Ben (Hoffman) as an aimless college graduate.  Despite his numerous collegiate achievements, he doesn't know what to do with his life.  Dry, offbeat hilarity ensues as his parents and their friends try to steer him into a career.  Enter Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft) and the comedy becomes a display of Ben's intense discomfort with their illicit relationship.  Up to this point, I was really impressed.Unfortunately, when Elaine arrives on the scene and Ben falls madly in love with her, the movie takes a turn for the worse.  His desperation borders on pathetic and her acceptance of him after learning of his Oedipal affair with her mother is not credible.  As you watch their faces as they flee her wedding, you realize that this ""love"" was only for the forbidden fruit and that Ben's path in life isn't happiness but failure.Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 80's, but the rejection of social norms and do-your-own-thing message espoused here didn't seem bold and fresh.

I thought it did an excellent job of capturing the post-graduate mentality (partly idealistic, partly cynical, and completely lost).  I liked how the main characters were fairly fleshed out, even though the dialogue was economical.  I thought the camera work was interesting.  In particular, there are several impressive shots involving ""Mrs. Robinson.""  The first being the quick cuts to her nude torso during the initial seduction scene.  I think the flashes of her chest and sharp tan-lines are much more titillating than a lingering, full-body shot could have been.  There is also a scene, just after Hoffman's rainy-day confession, when he looks at Mrs. Robinson standing in the corner.  The camera speedily zooms back, and we see her looking very small and wasted.  I found this quite effective.  The last thing I will mention about the Graduate is the final scene ... after the almost implausible grand finale, the camera lingers on its characters for about 20 second longer than you might expect.  I think this brings the story back to reality, in a way - and makes for a simultaneously uncomfortable, open-ended and hopeful conclusion.  Anyway, I thought it was great.Although some people apparently find The Graduate slow or dated, personally, I think it's one of the most completely excellent films I've ever seen.

Here we have an intelligent, introspective young man, fresh out of college, who wants nothing more than to lounge in his parents' pool and reflect upon his future, a slacker three decades before that term was coined.  But those in his life try to pull him into different directions and attempt to make decisions for him.  His parents are hell bent on his going to grad school; a colleague of his father's insists he seek out a career in the plastics industry; and, most forcibly of all, Mrs. Robinson coerces him to initiate an affair with her.THE GRADUATE is more a story of one person versus a domineering society than anything else.

444683,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,6305034397,"""chick_flick""","[0, 2]","""The Graduate"" tells the story of a young man named Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who has just graduated from college and has come home. Benjamin doesn't know yet what he wants to do for the rest of his life. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Braddock (William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson), want Benjamin to go to grad school, but he's not sure if he wants to go. His life eruptly changes when an older friend of his family's, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), tries to seduce him. Mrs. Robinson is the wife of Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton), who likes Benjamin until he finds out that Benjamin has been sleeping with his wife, and is the mother of Elaine Robinson (Katherine Ross), who is Benjamin's age. Benjamin's parents try to set him up with Elaine, even though Benjamin is already sleeping with her mother. Mrs. Robinson refuses to let Benjamin take her daughter out, but he does anyway. When Benjamin falls in love with Elaine, Mrs. Robinson finds out and forbides Elaine to see him anymore and even tries to get her to marry another man! Now Benjamin must end his affair with Mrs. Robinson and win back Elaine before it's too late.Dustin Hoffman is charming, and superb in his role of Benjamin Braddock. Anne Bancroft is also superb as the sexy, sedusive wife. Kathrine Ross, William Daniels, Murray Hamilton, and Elizabeth Wilson are also wonderful in their co-starring roles. ""The Graduate"" is hilarious and poignant at the same time. The Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack only makes the film more enjoyable and fits in just right with the story. The directing by Mike Nichols is awesome and the storyline and dialouge are great. The DVD is okay, but it could have added a few more extras. The only bonus material this DVD includes are an exclusive interview with Dustin Hoffman and a behind-the-scenes making documentary. The DVD is available in wide screen format.I highly recommend ""The Graduate"".Score:100/100A+",5,"""Would you like me to seduce you?"" ~ Mrs. Robinson.",1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,1919,"['Graduate', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'college', 'come', 'home', 'Benjamin', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'what', 'do', 'rest', 'life', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Braddock', 'William', 'Daniels', 'Elizabeth', 'Wilson', 'want', 'Benjamin', 'go', 'grad', 'school', 'not', 'sure', 'go', 'life', 'eruptly', 'when', 'older', 'friend', 'family', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'seduce', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'wife', 'Mr.', 'Robinson', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'Benjamin', 'out', 'Benjamin', 'been', 'sleeping', 'wife', 'mother', 'Elaine', 'Robinson', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'who', 'Benjamin', 'age', 'Benjamin', 'parents', 'try', 'set', 'up', 'Elaine', 'even', 'Benjamin', 'already', 'sleeping', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'let', 'Benjamin', 'take', 'daughter', 'anyway', 'When', 'Benjamin', 'love', 'Elaine', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'out', 'forbides', 'Elaine', 'see', 'anymore', 'even', 'tries', 'get', 'marry', 'man', 'Now', 'Benjamin', 'must', 'end', 'affair', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'win', 'back', 'Elaine', 'too', 'late.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'charming', 'superb', 'role', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'also', 'superb', 'sexy', 'sedusive', 'wife', 'Kathrine', 'Ross', 'William', 'Daniels', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'Elizabeth', 'Wilson', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'co-starring', 'roles', 'Graduate', 'hilarious', 'poignant', 'same', 'time', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'right', 'story', 'directing', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'awesome', 'storyline', 'dialouge', 'are', 'great', 'DVD', 'okay', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'few', 'more', 'extras', 'only', 'bonus', 'material', 'DVD', 'are', 'exclusive', 'interview', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'behind-the-scenes', 'making', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'available', 'wide', 'screen', 'format.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Graduate', '.Score:100/100A+']",The Graduate

If he only knew he'd be sowing oats in Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) he may not have been so quick to give advise.  After a dinner party thrown in the honor of his return, Benjamin escorts Mrs Robinson home only to be thrown into an affair he wasn't counting on.  Soon he becomes acustomed to the idea and actually quite comfortable with it.  You see Benjamin is trying to find himself over the summer, find out who he is and where he wants to go with his life, and with everyone around him being so fake and superficial he finds it difficult to do so.  I just love his birthday party scene.  It really shows how he is nothing like the family he was raised in nor the company they keep.  He's an awkward teenager (think Jake Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko) who finds it hard to function in the environment he's stuck in.  But being with Mrs Robinson gives him the courage and confidence he was lacking and makes it easier for him to relax and take it easy.  And then he makes a realization.  He's being used.  When he falls for the daughter of the Robinsons, Elaine (Katherine Ross), Mrs Robinson quickly makes him aware that he is nothing but an expendable playtoy and that he's not good enough for her daughter.  The rest of the film follows Benjamin as he tries to win over Elaine's heart and eventually break up her engagment to family friend Carl Smith (Brian Avery).  This is a cult classic, a film that resulted in many other staple films of today.  It's far from a love story but more a story about the desire to be more than what others expect of you.

444690,A3673NBQVA4J2M,6305034397,"Daniel Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[2, 32]","On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is ""There's a time and place for everything"", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you.

444693,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6305034397,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","Some of the themes of ""The Graduate"" are dated by today's standards but it remains a very funny film.  The story involves a recent graduate, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who has little or no direction in life who stumbles into an affair with his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft).  When not going off for his trysts with Mrs. Robinson he spends his time lolling in his parents pool.  After breaking off his affair with Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin turns his attention to wooing her daughter, Elaine(Katherine Ross), much to the consternation of his elders.  When ""The Graduate"" was released in 1967 it was considered to be a landmark in American film-making.  It was the boomers making a statement about their exploitation by their elders.  Now that the boomers have become the establishment, these sentiments would be amusing to any succeeding generation.  What remains are some very funny bits mostly involving Benjamin's awkward encounters with the worldly, seductive Mrs. Robinson.  There's also some funny moments involving Benjamin's frantic pursuit of Elaine, particularly after she finds out about his affair with her mother.  Hoffman makes a terrific debut as Benjamin. Bancroft imbues complexity in a character that could have been one-note, particularly in the scenes after the affair where the demands of the story make her seem shrewish.  Ross is pretty and adequate as Elaine.  There are alot of great scenes involving character actors including Murray Hamilton (""I think you're scum!""), Norman Fell(""You're not one of those outside agitators?"") and others.  Look fast for Richard Dreyfus(""Should I get the cops?"") and co-scripter, Buck Henry(""Good evening, Mr. Gladstone."").  Praise goes out to director Mike Nichols and screenwriters Henry and Calder Willingham.  Lastly, you cannot review this film without mentioning the now classic song score by Simon and Garfunkel.

The screenplay by Buck Henry is great, Mike Nichols did an outstanding job directing, and all the key parts were cast and acted perfectly.  The great Simon &amp; Garfunkel music helped to make the film what it became.  AFI ranked it #7 on its list of the top 100 American movies, and I agree.  I think it is that good.  I saw it on TV when I was teenager, and have rented it or seen it on TV several times since then.  It has always been one of  my favorite films.  I even read the novel by Charles Webb (to which the movie stayed pretty close).Unfortunately, this DVD does not do it justice.  The main problem is the audio.  The sound track is just ever so slightly out of sync with the picture throughout the entire film.  In one scene, when Benjamin's mother confronts him about his nocturnal activities, the problem is extremely noticeable.  The sound is mixed badly throughout, especially during the second half of the film, when Benjamin starts seeing Elaine (Katherine Ross).  Crucial dialog is drowned out by sound effects.  By the end, you have to crank up the volume on your TV to wake-up-the-neighbors levels just to hear what the characters are saying.  This is inexcusable.  I also note, from an earlier review, that the laserdisk version had a director's commentary, so why doesn't the DVD?Some day, they'll put out a good DVD version of the movie, until then we'll have to be content with VHS and Turner Classic Movies.",3,"Outstanding movie, crummy DVD",1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,1505,"['movie', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'when', 'released', 'now', 'classic', 'screenplay', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'great', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'directing', 'key', 'parts', 'were', 'cast', 'acted', 'perfectly', 'great', 'Simon', 'amp', 'Garfunkel', 'music', 'helped', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'became', 'AFI', 'ranked', '7', 'list', 'top', '100', 'American', 'movies', 'agree', 'think', 'good', 'saw', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'have', 'rented', 'seen', 'TV', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'even', 'read', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Webb', 'movie', 'stayed', 'pretty', 'close', '.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'main', 'problem', 'audio', 'sound', 'track', 'just', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'sync', 'picture', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Benjamin', 'mother', 'nocturnal', 'activities', 'problem', 'extremely', 'noticeable', 'sound', 'mixed', 'badly', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'Benjamin', 'seeing', 'Elaine', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'Crucial', 'dialog', 'drowned', 'out', 'sound', 'effects', 'end', 'have', 'crank', 'up', 'volume', 'TV', 'wake-up-the-neighbors', 'levels', 'just', 'hear', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'inexcusable', 'also', 'note', 'earlier', 'review', 'laserdisk', 'version', 'had', 'director', 'commentary', 'so', 'why', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'day', ""'ll"", 'put', 'out', 'good', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'then', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'content', 'VHS', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies']",The Graduate

444701,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6305034397,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 6]","This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967.  Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson.  She is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting.  Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor.  The maternal way she has with the virginal Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in a breakout role) emphasizes the creepy, almost incestuous nature of their sterile affair.Mike Nichols has directed a number of sexual/relationship comedies, including Carnal Knowledge (1971), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), Nora Ephron's Heartburn (1986) and Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge (1990).  Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of human nature.  The humor usually has an edgy quality while the taboo elements are somehow resolved into happy endings as in a musical comedy.  Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own.  Typically, The Graduate is adapted from the novel by Charles Webb.  Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score.  What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence.""  Of course Paul Simon wrote the song ""Mrs. Robinson"" for this movie, but what I didn't realized until now is his ""It's all happening at the zoo"" was probably inspired in part by the zoo scene in this film.Dustin Hoffman's confused and drifting Benjamin, worried about his future and suffocated by his parents' generation, knocked everybody out in those days with his dead-panned, literal delivery of one-liners, some of which were written by Buck Henry, who plays the desk clerk at the rendezvous hotel.  I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half-baked idea?""  In dead seriousness, Benjamin says, ""No, sir.  It's completely baked.""Memorable is Norman Fell (whom most of us recall from TV's long-running comedy, Three's Company) in a small part as the landlord of the Berkeley rooming house.  He is of course a past master at dead-panning one-liners; in fact, he is a master at mute dead-panning.  One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view; the wonderful chase scene at the end, a Hollywood staple made fresh; the sympathetic character of Benjamin with whom we could readily identify; the cliche-ridden and shallow parents being slyly made fun of; and the sense of getting what we want out of life and doing it our own way.  This is a coming-of-ager and a romance and a social satire rolled into one, and a classic Hollywood movie that no afficionado would want to miss.But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.",5,"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson",1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,3264,"['one', 'defining', 'films', 'generation', 'course', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1967', 'Seeing', 'again', 'years', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'funny', 'brittle', 'cynical', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'flawless', 'part', 'might', 'easily', 'lend', 'overacting', 'Instead', 'subtle', 'controlled', 'focused', 'authentic', 'way', 'sexy', 'chilling', 'just', 'hint', 'ironic', 'humor', 'maternal', 'way', 'virginal', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'breakout', 'role', 'creepy', 'almost', 'incestuous', 'nature', 'sterile', 'affair.Mike', 'Nichols', 'directed', 'number', 'sexual/relationship', 'comedies', 'including', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', '1971', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', '1966', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'Heartburn', '1986', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'Postcards', 'Edge', '1990', 'Nichols', 'films', 'typically', 'feature', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'explore', 'deceptively', 'humorous', 'manner', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'humor', 'usually', 'edgy', 'quality', 'taboo', 'elements', 'are', 'somehow', 'resolved', 'happy', 'endings', 'musical', 'comedy', 'Nichols', 'work', 'material', 'medium', 'make', 'own', 'Typically', 'Graduate', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Webb', 'Nichols', 'also', 'feature', 'cutting', 'edge', 'popular', 'music', 'score', 'What', 'hear', 'background', 'played', 'opening', 'credits', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'Sounds', 'Silence', 'course', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'wrote', 'song', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'movie', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'realized', 'now', 'happening', 'zoo', 'was', 'probably', 'inspired', 'part', 'zoo', 'scene', 'film.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'confused', 'drifting', 'Benjamin', 'worried', 'future', 'suffocated', 'parents', 'generation', 'knocked', 'everybody', 'out', 'days', 'dead-panned', 'literal', 'delivery', 'one-liners', 'were', 'written', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'who', 'desk', 'clerk', 'rendezvous', 'hotel', 'especially', 'loved', 'Ben', 'answer', 'when', 'father', 'enquiring', 'Quixotic', 'plan', 'marry', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'Katharine', 'Ross', ""n't"", 'half-baked', 'idea', 'dead', 'seriousness', 'Benjamin', 'No', 'sir', 'completely', 'baked', 'Memorable', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'whom', 'most', 'recall', 'TV', 'long-running', 'comedy', 'Three', 'Company', 'small', 'part', 'landlord', 'Berkeley', 'rooming', 'house', 'course', 'past', 'master', 'dead-panning', 'one-liners', 'fact', 'master', 'mute', 'dead-panning', 'One', 'funniest', 'bits', 'movie', 'when', 'camera', 'face', 'Elaine', 'father', 'Ben', 'room', 'spewing', 'obscenities', 'insults', 'Ben.What', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'youthful', 'point', 'view', 'wonderful', 'chase', 'scene', 'end', 'Hollywood', 'staple', 'made', 'fresh', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Benjamin', 'whom', 'could', 'readily', 'identify', 'cliche-ridden', 'shallow', 'parents', 'being', 'slyly', 'made', 'fun', 'sense', 'getting', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'doing', 'own', 'way', 'coming-of-ager', 'romance', 'social', 'satire', 'rolled', 'one', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'afficionado', 'would', 'want', 'miss.But', 'see', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'brilliant', 'perhaps', 'underrated', 'actress', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'roles']",The Graduate

A bored, pampered housewife, seducing a youth lost in his own angst, makes THE GRADUATE the timeless classic that it is.  (Not to mention the Simon & Garfunkel musical score, which also is timeless.)  Often very funny--yet always poignant--this is a film that identified the turbulent Sixties.  What a problematic, dysfunctional decade that was!Dustin Hoffman became a mega-star as uninspired Benjamin Braddock, a recent graduate from an east coast school hanging out in his parents' digs in LA for one endless summer.  Benjamin has no idea what he wants to do with his life. . .or when he wants to get in the game.  But he's not as bored as crafty Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft is fabulous), a longtime family friend, who makes herself readily available for young Ben to sample her wares.  Like their lives, the affair itself is an exercise in tedious mundanity, until Benjamin's psyche is piqued by Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).  Benjamin falls head over heels with Elaine, which angers Mrs. Robinson to the point the affair is readily exposed, causing Benjamin to employ 24/7 damage control.  And we all know the climactic scene where Benjamin, pounding on the plate glass windows of a church, disrupts Elaine's nuptials; the ensuing flight of the lovebirds signifying the outside-the-box behavior characteristic of the Sixties.Hoffman and Bancroft are superb in their respective roles--even though in ""real"" life, Bancroft was only six years Hoffman's senior.  The supporting cast is worthy, the musical score (again) is exceptional, and the dynamics of this film defined a generation.

He is very worried about his future, and during a party that his parents for him, this makes him vulnerable to being seduced by Mrs. Robinson. She is married to Ben's father's business partner, and has known Ben for his whole life. Although, when she lures Ben into her home the first time, she is unsuccessful in seducing him. Eventually he gives into her, and they have affairs for many months. Elaine Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's daughter, comes back from school and Ben's parents set up a date between the two young adults. Ben ends up falling in love with Elaine, which makes Mrs. Robinson furious. Elaine then finds out about the affair and heads back to school. Knowing that Elaine is the one for him, Ben goes to find her at her school and tries to get her to marry him. It does work, but Mr. Robinson steps in and takes Elaine and tries to marry her off to some other guy. In a last hope of desperation, Ben searches for Elaine before she gets married. When he does find her the vows are already said, but Ben interrupts the wedding anyway. Then, Elaine yells out to Ben, he fights his way to her, and whisks her away into a bus. After they calm down, the movie with sincere expressions on their faces.  ""The Graduate"" was a very tasteful film. I found it to be quite funny and that the story could basically fit our time period, not just the 60's. This characteristic is not commonly found in movies that were made more then four decades ago. This could be contributed to that the movie didn't give much of any relation from the events of the plot to the time period it was set. It also had a very complicated story.  The acting was quite superb. I did not notice one character that seemed awkward or that I didn't like. Dustin Hoffman and Anne Boncroft (Ben and Mrs. Robinson) acted remarkably well especially when I heard that they were around the same age. in the film, Ben seems to be much younger then Mrs. Robinson. Not just in appearance, but also in the way that they acted. Nervous young Ben as compared to calm uncaring Mrs. Robinson. All the characters in this movie did very well in getting into their roles.  The feelings and moods of the film were portrayed quite well. You could tell what Ben was feeling just by the every once and while shots of him either on a plane or on the bottom of the pool. He looked like he was lost in his own mind. The music was also very important to showing the mood of the story, and the soundtrack is quite amazing if I do say so myself.  The film kept me interested because of how the characters grow with the story and the plot. If you just looked at the characters at the beginning of the movie and the end you can see that they all have changed a lot.  In short, I really enjoy this movie and I will recommend it many people that I know. Plus, if they don't like it they at least have to respect the music in it. I have to say I think this is my favorite film from the 60's.",4,Film Studies Review,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,3006,"['film', 'guy', 'name', 'Benjamin', 'who', 'just', 'home', 'college', 'very', 'worried', 'future', 'party', 'parents', 'vulnerable', 'being', 'seduced', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'married', 'Ben', 'father', 'business', 'partner', 'known', 'Ben', 'whole', 'life', 'when', 'Ben', 'home', 'first', 'time', 'unsuccessful', 'seducing', 'Eventually', 'have', 'affairs', 'many', 'months', 'Elaine', 'Robinson', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'daughter', 'back', 'school', 'Ben', 'parents', 'set', 'up', 'date', 'two', 'young', 'adults', 'Ben', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Elaine', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'furious', 'Elaine', 'then', 'out', 'affair', 'heads', 'back', 'school', 'Knowing', 'Elaine', 'one', 'Ben', 'find', 'school', 'tries', 'get', 'marry', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Robinson', 'Elaine', 'tries', 'marry', 'off', 'other', 'guy', 'last', 'hope', 'desperation', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'married', 'When', 'find', 'vows', 'are', 'already', 'said', 'Ben', 'wedding', 'anyway', 'Then', 'Elaine', 'out', 'Ben', 'way', 'away', 'bus', 'calm', 'down', 'movie', 'sincere', 'expressions', 'Graduate', 'was', 'very', 'tasteful', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'funny', 'story', 'could', 'basically', 'fit', 'time', 'period', 'not', 'just', '60', 'characteristic', 'not', 'commonly', 'found', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'more', 'then', 'four', 'decades', 'ago', 'could', 'be', 'contributed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'relation', 'events', 'plot', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'set', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'complicated', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'superb', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'one', 'character', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Anne', 'Boncroft', 'Ben', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'acted', 'remarkably', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'same', 'age', 'film', 'Ben', 'be', 'much', 'younger', 'then', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Not', 'just', 'appearance', 'also', 'way', 'acted', 'Nervous', 'young', 'Ben', 'compared', 'calm', 'uncaring', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'characters', 'movie', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'getting', 'roles', 'feelings', 'moods', 'film', 'were', 'portrayed', 'quite', 'well', 'could', 'tell', 'what', 'Ben', 'was', 'feeling', 'just', 'once', 'shots', 'plane', 'bottom', 'pool', 'looked', 'was', 'lost', 'own', 'mind', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'showing', 'mood', 'story', 'soundtrack', 'quite', 'amazing', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'film', 'kept', 'interested', 'how', 'characters', 'grow', 'story', 'plot', 'just', 'looked', 'characters', 'beginning', 'movie', 'end', 'can', 'see', 'have', 'changed', 'lot', 'short', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'recommend', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'least', 'have', 'respect', 'music', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'favorite', 'film', '60']",The Graduate

444710,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6305034397,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film. But then again, judging from his subsequent work all the way to ""Angels in America"" and ""Closer"", Mike Nichols seems to have come into filmmaking fully understanding the frailties of the human condition and knowing how to convey them in a way that audiences could empathize. ""The Graduate"" is one of those films that gravitates effortlessly to its audience even now, the aging Vietnam War-era population who championed anarchy and the people who revise their personal histories so they can think they were members of the now-fashionable counter-cultural movement. It is a testament to Nichols and screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that the social comedy aspects of this film do not seem at all dated. In fact, despite its provocative veneer, it's really old-fashioned in key ways from the hero's moralistic tendencies to his romantically compulsive motivations toward the end.Dustin Hoffman was pulled out of complete obscurity to play Benjamin, the alienated, recent college graduate drifting amid his parents' Southern California upper middle class, swimming pool-centered ennui. As he figures out what to do with his life and faces unwanted advice from his parents' friends, enter Mrs. Robinson, a bored, restless wife, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth. It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life. She gives a masterful performance. The hotel sequence where Benjamin awkwardly asks Mrs. Robinson for a drink is sharply observed and hilarious - the suspicious hotel clerk  (Henry, the film's co-screenwriter) eyeing Benjamin's every move; the reception line which Benjamin pretends to know (watch for TV veterans Alice Ghostley and Marion Lorne - Aunt Clara of ""Bewitched"" - make indelible marks here); and just the predatory Mrs. Robinson's business-like approach to seduction.  Complicating matters exorbitantly is Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played with relative nonchalance by Katharine Ross. The film then turns into a revenge comedy with Mrs. Robinson trying to prevent the inevitable coupling of Benjamin and Elaine. She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus. Some of the comedy and characterizations do seem a bit extreme, for example, Hoffman seems to amplify his character's nebbishness a few too many times, Elaine's fianc&eacute;e appears like a textbook 1960's TV stereotype. There are also geographic gaffes which are obvious to me since I am a Berkeley alum and a San Francisco Bay Area native: the campus scenes are most certainly not filmed at Berkeley but at USC, Benjamin crosses the Bay Bridge in the wrong direction to hunt for Elaine. But these lapses are forgivable in light of Nichols' expert direction; the witty, observant script; and Simon and Garfunkel's distinctively dulcet tones.

I think it has an enduring quality because it is a well made movie and as some reviewers have pointed out, we can all relate to Ben Braddock's lost, lonely and indecisive phase in our youths no matter if it was in a lesser or greater degree.  And folks, let's face, the soundtrack is a Bomb.The movie is also an excercise in style and technique, although according to Henry, some came by accident as the actors and the director sort of fumbled around when they didn't know quite how to create a certain scene.  I love the part when Dustin Hoffman eagerly kisses Anne Bancroft with smoke still in her mouth.Some reviewers complained that this movie didn't reflect the turbulent times and places that was happening then.  But in a way doesn't Ben's own ambivalence towards his future and his ultimate courage to go against all odds and fight for what he wants reflect this?  To lodge this particular complaint about this movie is really missing the point.This movie will last and will appeal  to any generation.  I first saw this movie in junior high back in the early 80's and I thought what a neat movie it was.  I was mostly impress by the cinematography and I loved the neat ending, but as you watched the movie with age, you grow to appreciate it in different levels, that's why I think this movie will endure many generations of movie lovers and DVD collectors.Get the DVD, it will make a nice addition to your collection and when you're feeling reflective on a nice gloomy day, pop it on and enjoy.",5,"Enduring, Timeless",1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,1947,"['DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'will', 'delight', 'true', 'fans', 'lenghty', 'interviews', 'stars', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'screenwriter', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'recount', 'making', 'movie', 'critical', 'decisions', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'made', 'most', 'reminiessed', 'making', 'movie', 'itself.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'grown', 'tired', 'have', 'grown', 'apprreciate', 'even', 'more', 'think', 'enduring', 'quality', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'can', 'relate', 'Ben', 'Braddock', 'lost', 'lonely', 'indecisive', 'phase', 'youths', 'matter', 'was', 'lesser', 'greater', 'degree', 'folks', 'let', 'face', 'soundtrack', 'Bomb.The', 'movie', 'also', 'excercise', 'style', 'technique', 'according', 'Henry', 'came', 'accident', 'actors', 'director', 'sort', 'fumbled', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'how', 'create', 'certain', 'scene', 'love', 'part', 'when', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'eagerly', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'smoke', 'still', 'mouth.Some', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'reflect', 'turbulent', 'times', 'places', 'was', 'happening', 'then', 'way', ""n't"", 'Ben', 'own', 'ambivalence', 'future', 'ultimate', 'courage', 'go', 'odds', 'fight', 'what', 'reflect', 'lodge', 'particular', 'complaint', 'movie', 'really', 'missing', 'point.This', 'movie', 'will', 'last', 'will', 'appeal', 'generation', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'junior', 'high', 'back', 'early', '80', 'thought', 'what', 'neat', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'mostly', 'impress', 'cinematography', 'loved', 'neat', 'ending', 'watched', 'movie', 'age', 'grow', 'appreciate', 'different', 'levels', 'why', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'endure', 'many', 'generations', 'movie', 'lovers', 'DVD', 'collectors.Get', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'nice', 'addition', 'collection', 'when', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'reflective', 'nice', 'gloomy', 'day', 'pop', 'enjoy']",The Graduate

And if you've read any of my other reviews, you're saying, ""Oh, yeah, cuz she's obsessed with Simon and Garfunkel."" Well, I must admit that I first saw it for the outstanding soundtrack (which really is reason enough), but the movie itself exceeded all my exprectations. It's perfect: unconventional, darkly funny, honest, odd, with the perfect music and about a million lines that are regularly quoted at my home. (""No, it's completely baked."") Darn it, you could even say it's touching. But not in a smushy-mushy sort of way.Anyway, there's really no need to go over the plot here, you probably know it: Grad student Benjamin gets sucked into Mrs. Robinson's web of sin, regrets it, falls for the daughter, gets everyone pissed off at him, but persists and--oh no I wo'nt ruin the ending. But it's awesome, the best movie ending ever. Does this sound like a dumb romantic comedy? Well it's not, and I can assure you I LoAtHe romantic comedies. The dark look at the relation between youth and age, innocence and world-weariness, right and wrong and love and lust (and all these elements fit together perfectly) prevents it from falling into this category of mush. Its other saving grace is the constant undercurrent of humor, in Dustin Hoffman's magnificent deadpan and the personalities of the minor characters. The element of humor is indescribable, being somewhat unconventional, but in the end is probably the funniest (and saddest even) movie I have ever seen.I must, I fear, discuss the music for a moment. The S&G; soundtrack is so distinctive, as the only songs in the movie are by them and each song is used several times. However, this never gets tedious, just helps to reveal hidden truths in the characters and their emotions. It's a beautiful juxtaposition. The music really embodies the movie, and especially ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""Mrs. Robinson."" ""Sound"" is an utterly dark and tragic song, lamenting the lack of true and honest human contact that becomes a major theme in the movie. ""Mrs. Robinson"" is a slightly odd, humorous song, but with an undercurrent of reality in thinking about the loss of youth.And so everything in this movie adds up. It's entertaning, somewhat groundbreaking for its time, moving, balanced, serious and at the same time absolutely hilarious. It's so original, and the perfect performances of Hoffman and Bancroft really carry the whole film. This is really a movie for anyone; despite the subject matter it's not really to risque (but if you want risqu-osity it IS there), and any film lover will adore it. Buy it, watch it again, have a blast from the past or see for the first time one of the greatest movies ever! Show the kids! (Well, maybe later...)Just as an afterthought: it just struck me that for some reason this movie in particular seems like it would make a really good gift...or maybe that's just because I covet it...hahaha.

With that said, the movie isn't as funny as I had expected or hoped. Some of it might be Dustin Hoffman's acting - I like him in other movies, but he comes off pretty annoying here. Part of it might be that the movie pushed cultural boundaries and spoke to issues in the 1960s that don't have as much resonance today. Some scenes were just too over the top - like Hoffman's parents forcing him to go scuba-diving in the pool. I just don't get the humor there.The movie made great use of Simon and Garfunkel songs for the soundtrack! It really becomes part of the film and tells the story. Frankly, it's probably the best part of the movie. It would be nice if more movies weaved pop music in their films.Bottom line: if you liked The Catcher in the Rye (or stories like it), you'll like The Graduate.

It was the most unique film of its time and is now considered a timeless classic.Aside from it's release date, costumes, props and the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack place this film in the 60s.  What makes it a timeless classic is that nothing dates it, we see no Vietnam War and no hippies.  Also the themes from this film, coming of age, rebellion (against parents, against the status quo) and alienation all still apply today.The acting and cinematography make this film a masterful work of art.  Dustin Hoffman accurately portrayed a 21 year old college graduate with a life full of uncertainty.  He was awkward and dryly funny.  Director of photography Robert Surtees added to the uncertainty with inventive cinematography, always placing Ben to the left or right.

Let's be clear, this film was groundbreaking and has many excellent qualities (including story, directing, creative editing, symbolism, humor, irony, etc.).  However, more thanever a few detractors stood out.1) Although the first half is a definite tour de force, thesecond half is generally lacking and is carried on the fumesof the reved-up first half.  Let's face it, after the humorand intrigue of Mrs. Robinson's affair, there is a climaxwhen Elaine finds out (which follows their date sequence, which is neither interesting nor psychologically compelling).  After this we enter into the whole Berkeley interlude, which is also rather dull, and the storyline turns soap operaish.  Why?2) Because the love between Ben and Elaine is, let's face it,contrived.  Realize, they only had one date, and now they'remadly in love?  Furthermore, how does Elaine blithely dismissthe affair and the strong psychological implications of that?And what does this imply about the ending, when they desperatelyrun off together.  Doesn't it seem like a relation more doomedthan with destiny?  Also along this line is how Ben tells his parents he will marry Elaine, without consulting with heror her parents.  I suppose this act is part of the underlying counter-culture/generation gap in sensibilities.However, looking through today's lense, it seems more foolish than rebelish. Which leads too...3) The movie's lack of timelessness.  Reviewing in the new millennium, much of the 60s reality that made this movie moreshocking and revelatory in its time has passed.  The editing,film making, music, and humor that permeate the first halfare still first rate.  However, the rebelious impulse upon which the second half rely on and ultimately caps the movieno longer work.  Let's face it, upon second and third screeningsit becomes clear that the second half is sorely lacking in ingenuity and relies strongly on a lot of questionable psychology and dubious motivation.4) Character development. I'm just throwing this one out there,because think about it, how well do we really know any of these characters?All the parents are obvious stereotypes of a certain social class, maybe this can be easily accepted for thestories' purposes.  But even Ben and Elaine, do we understandmuch at all about what makes them tick, aside for the amorphousidea that they somehow want their lives to be different than their parents staid existence.Isn't there an onus for the story to give us better insight into their psyches?  Maybe it is all just a moral tale, and that's the excuse, but one is leftat the end with the sense that it all wasn't quite explained as well as it could be.Overall, of course, this movie is still a clear classic, because of it's strong message and style at the time,and the overall strength of the film.  However, I question the height of the pedestal it has been placed upon.",4,"Re-examining ""The Graduate""",1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,3045,"['Having', 'seen', 'Graduate', 'several', 'times', 'enjoying', 'thoroughly', 'happened', 'view', 'again', 'recently.However', 'recognized', 'again', 'few', 'flaws', 'new', 'questions', 'arose', 'Let', 'be', 'clear', 'film', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'many', 'excellent', 'qualities', 'including', 'story', 'directing', 'creative', 'editing', 'symbolism', 'humor', 'irony', 'etc.', 'However', 'more', 'thanever', 'few', 'detractors', 'stood', 'out.1', 'first', 'half', 'definite', 'tour', 'force', 'thesecond', 'half', 'generally', 'lacking', 'carried', 'fumesof', 'reved-up', 'first', 'half', 'Let', 'face', 'humorand', 'intrigue', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'affair', 'climaxwhen', 'Elaine', 'out', 'date', 'sequence', 'interesting', 'psychologically', 'compelling', 'enter', 'whole', 'Berkeley', 'interlude', 'also', 'rather', 'dull', 'storyline', 'soap', 'operaish', 'Why', '2', 'love', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'let', 'face', 'contrived', 'Realize', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'date', 'now', ""they'remadly"", 'love', 'Furthermore', 'how', 'Elaine', 'blithely', 'affair', 'strong', 'psychological', 'implications', 'what', 'imply', 'ending', 'when', 'desperatelyrun', 'off', 'together', ""n't"", 'seem', 'relation', 'more', 'doomedthan', 'destiny', 'Also', 'line', 'how', 'Ben', 'parents', 'will', 'marry', 'Elaine', 'consulting', 'heror', 'parents', 'suppose', 'act', 'part', 'underlying', 'counter-culture/generation', 'gap', 'sensibilities.However', 'looking', 'today', 'lense', 'more', 'foolish', 'rebelish', 'Which', 'too', '3', 'movie', 'lack', 'timelessness', 'Reviewing', 'new', 'millennium', 'much', '60s', 'reality', 'made', 'movie', 'moreshocking', 'revelatory', 'time', 'passed', 'editing', 'film', 'making', 'music', 'humor', 'permeate', 'first', 'halfare', 'still', 'first', 'rate', 'However', 'rebelious', 'impulse', 'second', 'half', 'rely', 'ultimately', 'movieno', 'longer', 'work', 'Let', 'face', 'second', 'third', 'screeningsit', 'clear', 'second', 'half', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'ingenuity', 'relies', 'strongly', 'lot', 'questionable', 'psychology', 'dubious', 'motivation.4', 'Character', 'development', ""'m"", 'just', 'throwing', 'one', 'there', 'think', 'how', 'well', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'characters', 'parents', 'are', 'obvious', 'stereotypes', 'certain', 'social', 'class', 'maybe', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'accepted', 'thestories', 'purposes', 'even', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'do', 'understandmuch', 'what', 'tick', 'aside', 'amorphousidea', 'somehow', 'want', 'lives', 'be', 'different', 'parents', 'staid', 'existence.Is', ""n't"", 'onus', 'story', 'give', 'better', 'insight', 'psyches', 'Maybe', 'just', 'moral', 'tale', 'excuse', 'one', 'end', 'sense', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'explained', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be.Overall', 'course', 'movie', 'still', 'clear', 'classic', 'strong', 'message', 'style', 'time', 'overall', 'strength', 'film', 'However', 'question', 'height', 'pedestal', 'been', 'placed']",The Graduate
444722,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,6305034397,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[166, 180]","The Graduate is a great film and I grow to love it more with each viewing. Everything is nearly perfect about it. The script, Mike Nichols' direction, the performances of Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross, the music of Simon and Garfunkel. It's funny yet dramatic, moving and profound all at the same time. A very enjoyable film all around. Dustin Hoffman has rarely been better than in The Graduate, although he has certainly given many other fine performances (Midnight Cowboy, Rain Man, Kramer Vs. Kramer). However, even more than those pictures, Hoffman will always be remembered for The Graduate and his portrayal of an awkward young man trying to get a hold on his life.Also worth noting in particular is the direction of Mike Nichols. He truly gives the film a unique visual style to make it an experience rather than just a comedy/drama. Note the opening credits with Hoffman on an airport moving sidewalk set to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's ""The Sound of Silence"". Nichols' uses cuts very interestingly in several scenes such as the scene where Benjamin jumps up on his raft in the pool, and lands in bed with Mrs. Robinson. He also uses zooms to great effect throughout the film. Nichols' Best Director Oscar for this film was well-deserved. I think that Hoffman's performance should have won also, as well as the screenplay by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry.One other thing that I must mention is that The Graduate absolutely must been seen in its original aspect ratio! If you're not watching a widescreen version, then you're not watching The Graduate. The film was shot in the Panavision process with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Mike Nichols makes wonderful use of the 2.35:1 frame, so the film will be absolutely botched in pan and scan. If you watch The Graduate in full-screen pan and scan, you're really, really missing out. The visual impact of the film will be irreparably damaged.The DVD is adequate, but this film deserves much better. The disc is labeled a special edition, but it's really too skimpy to be that. At very least you're getting a widescreen version of the film. However, the transfer is not enhanced for 16:9 televisions. What we need is a fully remastered 16:9 transfer which would be immensely beneficial. The picture quality is fair, but could be so much better. It's really stunning what difference a brand new remastered 16:9 transfer can make for an older film like this. Just look at the new DVD of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. The film also deserves better supplemental materials. A better documentary and a commentary by the filmmakers would be great. A seperate commentary by Dustin Hoffman would be even better.

He plays an awkward, funny, lost in space character named Benjamin who is just out of college and has no idea what to do with his life now.  While he's searching for somewhere to go or something to do, a longtime family friend who is old enough to be his mother begins to seduce him.  Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft, provides Ben with an outlet and something to do with his summer other than apply to graduate school or anything else.  He spends his days lazing in his pool and nights finding hotel rooms to continue Mrs. Robinson's affair.  The tides begin to get rough, however, when Ben reconnects with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played by the stunning Katharine Ross.This particular DVD has a few special features including a making of the film documentary, an interview with Dustin Hoffman, and the soundtrack.

However I feel if nothing else, The Graduate is culturally significant because it ushered in an age in the late 1960s where films focused on trying to attract younger audiences. Along with its good writing this film was one of the forerunners in using popular music in its soundtrack. Starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katherine Ross with direction by Mike Nichols, the film opens with Benjamin Braddock returning home from college. He has excelled in many ways and yet he feels bored and alienated from his parents. However the naive Benjamin soon finds himself in an affair with an older woman. This further confuses him as he figures out what to do with his life. His unknowing parents want him to date a girl attending Berkeley. Things become complicated since it turns out to be Mrs. Robinson's daughter. Not wanting anything to happen between Benjamin and Elaine, Mrs. Robinson sabotages the relationship and tries to marry her daughter off while her own marriage goes down the tube. Benjamin who is ultimately in love with Elaine crashes the wedding and takes her away to face an unknown life ahead. With the help of a memorable Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, this film ushered in a new age geared toward the younger generations.",4,The Graduate (1967),1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,1333,"['may', 'see', 'film', 'comedy', 'drama', 'not', 'category', 'great', 'movies', 'However', 'feel', 'nothing', 'else', 'Graduate', 'culturally', 'significant', 'ushered', 'age', 'late', '1960s', 'where', 'films', 'focused', 'trying', 'attract', 'younger', 'audiences', 'good', 'writing', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'forerunners', 'using', 'popular', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Starring', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'direction', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'film', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'returning', 'home', 'college', 'excelled', 'many', 'ways', 'yet', 'bored', 'alienated', 'parents', 'However', 'naive', 'Benjamin', 'soon', 'affair', 'older', 'woman', 'further', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'unknowing', 'parents', 'want', 'date', 'girl', 'attending', 'Berkeley', 'Things', 'become', 'complicated', 'out', 'be', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'daughter', 'Not', 'wanting', 'anything', 'happen', 'Benjamin', 'Elaine', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'relationship', 'tries', 'marry', 'daughter', 'own', 'marriage', 'down', 'tube', 'Benjamin', 'who', 'ultimately', 'love', 'Elaine', 'wedding', 'away', 'face', 'unknown', 'life', 'ahead', 'help', 'memorable', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'ushered', 'new', 'age', 'geared', 'younger', 'generations']",The Graduate

I was impressed also with the great direction and especially the way the scenes transition from one to the next; inspired work indeed.  In some ways the film is also touching as it reveals that behind the facade of prosperity and family wholesomeness lies some very unhappy and unfulfilled lives.Hoffman's character feels lost as despite achieving all that society tells him is important i.e. graduating with top honours and a letter in sport from a top university he still feels empty and unfulfilled seeking meaning in life and a way out of a depression that stems from knowing that he doesn't have the answers.  Mrs Robinson feels the same way being in a loveless marriage and seeking a way out but has given up not having the strength and courage to go against the mainstream view of what she has to be.  The scene at the end when her daughter tells her that it's not too late for her to escape from the straight-jacket of the kind of life her parents want for her is what made the whole film.  Hoffman and Ross' characters having the courage to go against the mainstream, to rebel and to live life rather than to be a slave to the mainstream view of what it should be.  Very 60s ideology indeed and hence a very apt movie for the times.This DVD though is poor and you should wait for the inevitable hopefully much better picture and sound quality restored Blu-ray version to come out.

444731,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,6305034397,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[8, 23]","Yes, the film is a ""classic"".  That doesn't mean that it is perfect.  Far from it.  The ""classic"" aspects of it are (1) Simon and Garfunkle (I found out that ""Sounds of Silence was NOT written specially for the movie, but pre-dates it to 1966), (2)  ""Ben - I have just one word for you - PLASTICS"" , (3) Buck Henry saying ""Sir, are you here for an affair?"" (4) ""That sounds a little half-baked""---""No it is fully baked"" (5) and other quotes that I can't recall at the moment.Having said that, as a ""social commentary"" which the film claims to be, it is a flop.  It was claimed that this was the first film to really deal with the ""generation gap"", and it is true that there is a totally breakdown in communication between Ben and his parents, but we must ask, whose  fault is this?  We must remember that Ben's parents were of the generation that grew up during the Great Depression and World War II.That meant they had to do without a lot of material comforts that the 1960's generation took for granted.  Ben's father would have served in the military in WWII, and possibly put his life on the line in addition to living a highly regimented life for several years.In addition, even though it is not stated explicitly, they are Jews, meaning that they most likely had to encounter anti-Semitism that only became ""politically incorrect"" when they became adults, possibly depriving them of the chance to attend the university of their choice or obtaining the most desirable job.It was very difficult for this generation to talk about the difficulties they encountered and they most definitely wanted to shield their children from these difficulties.  It also fixated  a lot of them on ""material success"" at the expense of what earlier generations considered ""character development"", ""morality"" or ""spirituality"".Thus, Ben comes home from University with the feeling that he is of value only if he ""performs"" or ""achieves"" to the level that his parents expect of him.  This is why his father makes the point of saying how much he paid for the scuba-diving equipment in front of his friends (""see-look how much I am willing to spend on him!"").  This shows that he does have grounds for being unhappy with his relationship with them.  In fact, in general his parents and friends (except for the Robinsons) seem to be pleasant people who genuinely like Ben. Yet, all he wants to do is run away from them, and instead he is strangely attracted Mrs Robinson who treats him in a stand-offish and exploitative manner. Even Mr Robinson goes out his way to be nice to him at first, before the truth comes out.So  the film goes on and instead of trying to reach out and communicate with his parents, who have given him much, he turns his back on them and basically breaks off all contact.Since the message of the film seems to be that Ben is ""right"" in rejecting everyone and everything and he apparently finds ""true happiness"" in running off with Elaine, I can only conclude that the film'screators are giving a basically nihilistic message (in any event, why should he hit it off with Elaine whom we really don't learn much about better than with anyone else?,- she is a product of the same ""superficial, materialist"" society as everyone else he seems to have so much contempt for). Whereas, at least the film, at the beginning gives its message with some subtlety, the ending is a real incoherent mess with the way-over-the-top scenes with him fighting off everyone with a crucifix (how heavy-handed can one get with the symbolism?) and the  faces of the people at the wedding contorted with hate and anger all yelling silently at him.All in all, the film will be remembered for the ""classic"" elements I mentioned above, but its message is eminently forgettable.",3,Face It-Ben Is Nothing More Than A Spoiled Egotist,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,3753,"['Yes', 'film', 'classic', ""n't"", 'mean', 'perfect', 'Far', 'classic', 'aspects', 'are', '1', 'Simon', 'Garfunkle', 'found', 'out', 'Sounds', 'Silence', 'was', 'NOT', 'written', 'specially', 'movie', 'pre-dates', '1966', '2', 'Ben', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'word', 'PLASTICS', '3', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'saying', 'Sir', 'are', 'here', 'affair', '4', 'little', 'half-baked', 'fully', 'baked', '5', 'other', 'quotes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'moment.Having', 'said', 'that', 'social', 'commentary', 'film', 'claims', 'be', 'flop', 'was', 'claimed', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'deal', 'generation', 'gap', 'true', 'totally', 'breakdown', 'communication', 'Ben', 'parents', 'must', 'ask', 'fault', 'must', 'remember', 'Ben', 'parents', 'were', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'Great', 'Depression', 'World', 'War', 'II.That', 'meant', 'had', 'do', 'lot', 'material', 'comforts', '1960', 'generation', 'took', 'granted', 'Ben', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'military', 'WWII', 'possibly', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'addition', 'living', 'highly', 'regimented', 'life', 'several', 'years.In', 'addition', 'even', 'not', 'stated', 'explicitly', 'are', 'Jews', 'meaning', 'most', 'likely', 'had', 'encounter', 'anti-Semitism', 'only', 'became', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'when', 'became', 'adults', 'possibly', 'depriving', 'chance', 'attend', 'university', 'choice', 'obtaining', 'most', 'desirable', 'job.It', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'generation', 'talk', 'difficulties', 'encountered', 'most', 'definitely', 'wanted', 'shield', 'children', 'difficulties', 'also', 'fixated', 'lot', 'material', 'success', 'expense', 'what', 'earlier', 'generations', 'considered', 'character', 'development', 'morality', 'spirituality', '.Thus', 'Ben', 'home', 'University', 'feeling', 'value', 'only', 'performs', 'achieves', 'level', 'parents', 'expect', 'why', 'father', 'point', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'paid', 'scuba-diving', 'equipment', 'front', 'friends', 'see-look', 'how', 'much', 'am', 'willing', 'spend', 'have', 'grounds', 'being', 'unhappy', 'relationship', 'fact', 'general', 'parents', 'friends', 'Robinsons', 'seem', 'be', 'pleasant', 'people', 'who', 'genuinely', 'Ben', 'do', 'run', 'away', 'instead', 'strangely', 'attracted', 'Mrs', 'Robinson', 'who', 'stand-offish', 'exploitative', 'manner', 'Even', 'Mr', 'Robinson', 'out', 'way', 'be', 'nice', 'first', 'truth', 'out.So', 'film', 'instead', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'communicate', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'much', 'back', 'basically', 'breaks', 'off', 'contact.Since', 'message', 'film', 'be', 'Ben', 'right', 'rejecting', 'everyone', 'everything', 'apparently', 'true', 'happiness', 'running', 'off', 'Elaine', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', ""film'screators"", 'are', 'giving', 'basically', 'nihilistic', 'message', 'event', 'why', 'should', 'hit', 'off', 'Elaine', 'whom', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'product', 'same', 'superficial', 'materialist', 'society', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'contempt', 'Whereas', 'least', 'film', 'beginning', 'message', 'subtlety', 'ending', 'real', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'way-over-the-top', 'scenes', 'fighting', 'off', 'everyone', 'crucifix', 'how', 'heavy-handed', 'can', 'one', 'get', 'symbolism', 'people', 'wedding', 'contorted', 'hate', 'anger', 'yelling', 'silently', 'him.All', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'classic', 'elements', 'mentioned', 'message', 'eminently', 'forgettable']",The Graduate

Particularly effective is his use of repeated images to give the movie form-- the scenes with stockings, the swimming pool, the aquarium, for instance. And &quot;plastics&quot; and &quot;wood or wire&quot; have become a part of our national vocabulary. (Nichols does however, hit you over the head with  his imagery when Hoffman grabs that cross near the end of the movie.)One final thing: while I love the music of Paul Simon, with the exception of &quot;Mrs. Robinson,&quot; I didn't understand what those other great songs had to do with the theme of this movie in 1967 and I don't know now.

444738,A3EMNS5N86ZUOG,6305034397,H. Mario,"[2, 2]","This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967. Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. She really is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting. Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor. The maternal manner with which she treats virginal Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in a breakout role) emphasizes the creepy, almost incestuous nature of their sterile affair.  Mike Nichols has directed a number of sexual/relationship comedies, including Carnal Knowledge (1971), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), Nora Ephron's Heartburn (1986) and Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge (1990). Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of our human nature. The humor usually has an edgy quality while the taboo elements are somehow resolved into happy endings as in a musical comedy. Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own. Typically, The Graduate is adapted from the novel by Charles Webb. Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score. What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence."" Of course Paul Simon wrote the song ""Mrs. Robinson"" for this movie, but what I didn't realized until now is his ""It's all happening at the zoo"" was probably inspired in part by the zoo scene in this film.  Dustin Hoffman's confused and drifting Benjamin, worried about his future and suffocated by his parents' generation, knocked everybody out in those days with his dead-panned, literal delivery of one-liners, some of which were written by Buck Henry, who plays the desk clerk at the rendezvous hotel. I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half-baked idea?"" In dead seriousness, Benjamin says, ""No, sir. It's completely baked.""  Memorable is Norman Fell (whom most of us recall from TV's long-running comedy, Three's Company) in a small part as the landlord of the Berkeley rooming house. He is of course a past master at dead-panning one-liners; in fact, he is a master at mute dead-panning. One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.  What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view; the wonderful chase scene at the end, a Hollywood staple made fresh; the sympathetic character of Benjamin with whom we could readily identify; the clich&eacute;-ridden and shallow parents being slyly made fun of; and the sense of getting what we want out of life and doing it our own way. This is a coming-of-ager and a romance and a social satire rolled into one, and a classic Hollywood movie that no afficionado would want to miss.  But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.",4,Here's to you,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,3283,"['one', 'defining', 'films', 'generation', 'course', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1967', 'Seeing', 'again', 'years', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'funny', 'brittle', 'cynical', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'really', 'flawless', 'part', 'might', 'easily', 'lend', 'overacting', 'Instead', 'subtle', 'controlled', 'focused', 'authentic', 'way', 'sexy', 'chilling', 'just', 'hint', 'ironic', 'humor', 'maternal', 'manner', 'virginal', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'breakout', 'role', 'creepy', 'almost', 'incestuous', 'nature', 'sterile', 'affair', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'directed', 'number', 'sexual/relationship', 'comedies', 'including', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', '1971', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', '1966', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'Heartburn', '1986', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'Postcards', 'Edge', '1990', 'Nichols', 'films', 'typically', 'feature', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'explore', 'deceptively', 'humorous', 'manner', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'humor', 'usually', 'edgy', 'quality', 'taboo', 'elements', 'are', 'somehow', 'resolved', 'happy', 'endings', 'musical', 'comedy', 'Nichols', 'work', 'material', 'medium', 'make', 'own', 'Typically', 'Graduate', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Webb', 'Nichols', 'also', 'feature', 'cutting', 'edge', 'popular', 'music', 'score', 'What', 'hear', 'background', 'played', 'opening', 'credits', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'Sounds', 'Silence', 'course', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'wrote', 'song', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'movie', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'realized', 'now', 'happening', 'zoo', 'was', 'probably', 'inspired', 'part', 'zoo', 'scene', 'film', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'confused', 'drifting', 'Benjamin', 'worried', 'future', 'suffocated', 'parents', 'generation', 'knocked', 'everybody', 'out', 'days', 'dead-panned', 'literal', 'delivery', 'one-liners', 'were', 'written', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'who', 'desk', 'clerk', 'rendezvous', 'hotel', 'especially', 'loved', 'Ben', 'answer', 'when', 'father', 'enquiring', 'Quixotic', 'plan', 'marry', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'Katharine', 'Ross', ""n't"", 'half-baked', 'idea', 'dead', 'seriousness', 'Benjamin', 'No', 'sir', 'completely', 'baked', 'Memorable', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'whom', 'most', 'recall', 'TV', 'long-running', 'comedy', 'Three', 'Company', 'small', 'part', 'landlord', 'Berkeley', 'rooming', 'house', 'course', 'past', 'master', 'dead-panning', 'one-liners', 'fact', 'master', 'mute', 'dead-panning', 'One', 'funniest', 'bits', 'movie', 'when', 'camera', 'face', 'Elaine', 'father', 'Ben', 'room', 'spewing', 'obscenities', 'insults', 'Ben', 'What', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'youthful', 'point', 'view', 'wonderful', 'chase', 'scene', 'end', 'Hollywood', 'staple', 'made', 'fresh', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Benjamin', 'whom', 'could', 'readily', 'identify', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'shallow', 'parents', 'being', 'slyly', 'made', 'fun', 'sense', 'getting', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'doing', 'own', 'way', 'coming-of-ager', 'romance', 'social', 'satire', 'rolled', 'one', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'afficionado', 'would', 'want', 'miss', 'see', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'brilliant', 'perhaps', 'underrated', 'actress', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'roles']",The Graduate

I had to see what Wikipedia had on it, as I watched the movie a number of times.  That's where Robert Osbourne must get his leadins/outs for TCM.  Most of the reviews I've read here focus on the technical aspects of the film itself, and that's fine.  I don't know much about those things.  I'll assume everyone is familiar with the basic storyline, so I'll not belabor the details.What I take exception to is my man Roger Ebert's much-later assessment that Mrs. Robinson deserved more sympathy and that Ben was ""an insufferable creep.""  He's wrong.  This not a story about a young man's affair with an older woman.  It's about social pressure and the devestating effects it can have on the young -- Ben and Elaine and even Mrs. Robinson herself when she was their age.  I saw The Graduate at the theater, first run.  I was twenty years-old myself, and at the time just saw it as an hilarious comedy.  Forty-five years later it looks altogether different.  If Ben is creepy, it may well have been caused by they creepy things going on around him.  On the edge anyway, the actions of Mrs. Robinson pushed him over.  Indeed, in the beginning he is a basically sincere and honorable young man.  He's led astray by a woman old enough to know better and caught up in her own narcicism.  She deliberatly sets out to destroy him because he represents the promise that had once elluded her.  When he later determines to fullfill it with her own daughter, she comes completely unglued.The ending is somewhat ambiguous.  You'd like to think that things get sorted out for Ben and Elaine and that they live happily ever after.  But you know life ain't that simple and that they're off to a shaky start.  It's clear, however, that Ben is a better man than Elaine's husband, Carl, who is revealed to be the real creep and with whom she could not have had a good life.  The potential, if not the promise, of a happy ending resolves the story about as well as it could have.The Graduate is worth watching every few years for a lifetime . . .",5,A Sometimes Misunderstood Story,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,2116,"[""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'great', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'indeed', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'actually', 'ended', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'Wikipedia', 'had', 'watched', 'movie', 'number', 'times', 'where', 'Robert', 'Osbourne', 'must', 'get', 'leadins/outs', 'TCM', 'Most', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'focus', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'things', ""'ll"", 'assume', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'basic', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'not', 'belabor', 'details.What', 'take', 'exception', 'man', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'much-later', 'assessment', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'deserved', 'more', 'sympathy', 'Ben', 'was', 'insufferable', 'creep', 'wrong', 'not', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'affair', 'older', 'woman', 'social', 'pressure', 'devestating', 'effects', 'can', 'have', 'young', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'even', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'when', 'was', 'age', 'saw', 'Graduate', 'theater', 'first', 'run', 'was', 'twenty', 'years-old', 'myself', 'time', 'just', 'saw', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'Forty-five', 'years', 'later', 'altogether', 'different', 'Ben', 'creepy', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'caused', 'creepy', 'things', 'going', 'edge', 'anyway', 'actions', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'pushed', 'over', 'Indeed', 'beginning', 'basically', 'sincere', 'honorable', 'young', 'man', 'led', 'astray', 'woman', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'better', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'narcicism', 'deliberatly', 'out', 'destroy', 'promise', 'had', 'once', 'elluded', 'When', 'later', 'fullfill', 'own', 'daughter', 'completely', 'unglued.The', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'ambiguous', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'things', 'get', 'sorted', 'out', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'know', 'life', 'ai', ""n't"", 'that', 'simple', ""'re"", 'shaky', 'start', 'clear', 'however', 'Ben', 'better', 'man', 'Elaine', 'husband', 'Carl', 'who', 'revealed', 'be', 'real', 'creep', 'whom', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'life', 'potential', 'not', 'promise', 'happy', 'ending', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have.The', 'Graduate', 'worth', 'watching', 'few', 'years', 'lifetime']",The Graduate

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[4, 4]","I don't know if every generation has one particular film that defines it, but Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"" is the one which defines mine. This masterpiece, with its themes of alienation, idealism, social consciousness, cultural and generation gaps, and the extraordinary music of Simon & Garfunkel, brings back strong and poignant memories of life in the late 1960s and early '70s. Oddly enough, the specific issues which really separated generations, the Vietnam War, Civil Rights and the Women's Movement, are not mentioned here at all. Perhaps these matters were circumvented, even as points of reference, so that the movie would not become dated, or like ""Easy Rider,"" be labeled as too revolutionary for the mainstream.Benjamin Braddock, (superbly portrayed by Dustin Hoffman), has just graduated from college. A confused young man who is awkwardly making the transition between adolescence to adulthood, he is totally unsure of what to do with his future, let alone what to do next. As the film begins, the Braddocks are throwing a party for their son, the successful  new grad. All his parents' financially secure and affluent friends are there to celebrate. Benjamin is not one of the happy participants, however. He returns to his room as if it were the womb, and watches the aquarium. It seems as if he longs for comfort and clarity, but doesn't know how to express himself or whom to ask. He attempts to talk with his father to no avail. He will spend much of the summer like this, contemplating the tropical fish and his future - which he sure doesn't want to be ""in plastics."" I always felt that someone should have told him about the Peace Corps ...but I digress.Benjamin is expected to enter the bland suburban Californian society that his folks move in, filled with unhappy relationships, materialistic brinkmanship, and manicured lawns. He doesn't know what he wants to do, but he definitely knows what he doesn't want. Enter the famous Mrs. Robinson, and may I say BRAVO Anne Bancroft! Bored and unfulfilled, she is married to Benjamin's father's business partner. She obviously feels that Ben can temporarily alleviate her situation when she seduces him - or attempts to. He is initially unbelieving and reluctant, but persuadable. Filled with self-loathing, he continues the affair, which only punctuates his ineptness and his emptiness.Elaine Robinson, (Katherine Ross), daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, is about to come home from college. Benjamin is forbidden to date her, by his lover, who happens to be her mother. Talk about incestuous! Of course the now jaded Benjamin and the fresh, lovely Elaine will go out, fall in love, and you'll have to see the movie for the rest. The conclusion is brilliant.Anne Bancroft, in her gorgeous prime, is perfect as Mrs. Robinson. She is also sad, sarcastic, manipulative, at times really b*tchy, brittle in her beauty, and vulnerable in the role. If it were real life I would have asked her what she was doing with the virginal nerd, when she could do so much better!The film holds up so well today, not only because of the brilliant acting, direction and screenplay, but because the Graduate's problems are not dissimilar from what many youths experience now. Nichols won the Best Director award for this movie. His pacing is fluid, and his imagery metaphorical, at times chillingly so. Writers Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, (working from Charles Webb's novel), did a remarkable job with their satirical, off-beat screenplay. Simon and Garfunkel songs, including ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""The Sounds of Silence,"" give the film a wonderful lyrical tone.A five-minute interview with Dustin Hoffman and a fascinating documentary ""The Graduate at 25"" make up the extra features on the DVD, along with a limited edition 64-page book with production notes and a collection of articles and reviews from the original theatrical release.I remember watching ""The Graduate"" for the first time in 1968, and really relating. What can I say? I was young! Naive as this may sound, I did identify with the feelings stirred by the movie and performances. I still do, very much...no matter how retro.

Buck Henry did a very good job with the screenplay.But Nichols and Henry didn't create ""The Graduate,"" which they are often credited with doing--Charles Webb did. Webb is the writer whose novel ""The Graduate"" Nichols and Henry adapted, and he's the author of this work. To read the novel after watching the movie is startling: virtually every line of dialogue in the film is lifted straight from the novel, and the film largely follows the novel scene for scene. As important, the film's characteristic attitude of ironic detachment is no more than faithful to the novel. Certainly, Webb's book reads more like a screenplay--of a movie that in fact got made--than any other novel I've ever read.The book is a bit darker, perhaps--Benjamin's character in the novel doesn't have quite Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin's naive charm. And it doesn't have Simon and Garfunkel's brilliant soundtrack music! But broadly, the film is a direct translation, and whatever Nichols' and Henry's contributions may be, they simply don't rise to the level of their being called ""The Graduate""'s creators.

Packer,"[2, 2]","At first I thought another review for this film would be redundant, but after reading several other reviewer's comments, it seems that more needs to be said.This film isn't truly a love story.  Instead, the love story is a thin disguise over a call for social revolution.Like most rich people, the Braddocks and the Robinsons seem to have absolutely everything that human beings could possibly want, as long as you view them from the sidewalks that edge their front yards.Move inside, however, and you find that the Braddocks are two of the most fluffy and superficial people the planet has ever produced.  Like reflections in a mirror, they don't seem to have any existence aside from how they appear in other's eyes.  Their son Benjamin seems to have value in their minds only as a ticket, (through his accomplishments,) to yet more external validation for them.The Robinsons were trapped by pregnancy into a loveless, lifeless marriage that seems to be sustained mostly by bourbon, scotch and separate bedrooms.  He is a pompous ass, and she is a frustrated artist and successful narcissist who sees her daughter as competition.  Her affair with Benjamin seems to be nothing more than a cure for boredom and a way of confirming that she ""still has it.""  Yet she pursues him with the almost violent determination of a vampire.Benjamin's interest in Elaine is nonexistent until her mother, (his lover,) absolutely forbids him to date her daughter.  Ben has been searching for a way to push against this bizarre society of 1967 Los Angeles dreamworld, and suddenly he realizes that he wants to have anything that that society (embodied in Mrs. Robinson's hypocrisy) forbids him to have.The only thing that Benjamin and Elaine really have going for them, is that neither of them is stupid.  They both understand that this bizarre world their parents live in is a recipe for depression, alcoholism, insanity and suicide, all wrapped up in a sparkling wrapper of self-delusion, hypocrisy and fatal compromise.When they work together at the end to break Elaine free from her arranged marriage, and get on that bus with the impish grins of children who have just played an incredible prank on their far too serious parents, they don't really even know each other.  They have no real idea where they're going, or who they plan to be.  Truth is, they don't even know if they are going to stay together.  They just know that they aren't going to live anymore according to their parents' visions of who they are.The end of this film isn't the end of anything.  Instead, it's a call for the start of something.  It's a call for social revolution, for nonconformism, for independent thought, for a courageous rejection of an insane ""normal.""  The bus that Ben and Elaine are riding on isn't heading for the suburbs.  Ultimately, it's heading for Haight-Ashbury, for a ""be-in"" at Golden Gate Park, for one of Ken Kesey's ""Acid Tests,"" and for a large, green field on Yazgur's Farm.Ben and Elaine's relationship is almost irrelevant to where that bus is heading.

""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","This classic film from director Mike Nichols, his second movie after the great 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf', may have lost its strength in some scenes but other great moments make up for that. The first time we meet Ben, just graduated on a party, every single one wants to speak to him and he is getting really tired of them all. He tries to lose them all and that ends up with having the first encounter with Mrs. Robinson. This leads up to the best known scene with the most memorable line from this film.The second party is on Ben's birthday. His must show his present which gives us a hilarious scene. Considering the first party he finds his peace at last, although probably not the way he wanted it.Little things like this make this movie entertaining. The strong acting from both Hoffman and Bancroft also help. Especially the early scenes from Bancroft are terrific. They make us understand why Ben just has to do what he does, also telling us that Ben is not the strongest person in the world. Ross is quite nice too, although her character is pretty forgettable. If Ben would have chosen for Mrs. Robinson instead of the daughter it would probably have been more believable.The music from Simon & Garfunkel is good, although it does not add something to the film really. Because three well known songs ('Mrs. Robinson', 'The Sound of Silence' and 'Scarborough Fair') play over and over again some people will get tired of it after a while. I liked the songs enough to not have that problem.Overall I think this is a great film, with only the ending as really implausible, although I must admit I liked it this way.

He accomplished what society  deems as a success but ponders the point of living.  This is a situation  every generation must face.  Making his parents proud just doesn't seem to  be enough.  He finds meaning and direction in life through sex and love.  The women in the movie perfectly exemplify the one night stand girl and the  one you'd want to marry.  Moreover, if you could have one for one night  only, it would be Mrs. Robinson, but if you had to spend the rest of your  life with one, it would definitely be Elaine.  The experience and  sophistication of Mrs. Robinson make her allure overwhelming.  And the  scenes where Elaine in on campus really show how much she stands out among  average people.

It was one of the first films to explore some racey issues, such as younger man/oder woman affairs.We see Dustin Hoffman, a newly graduated kid on his way to college, moping around the house in the summer. He soon finds out that life can be a little more interesting in the mean time. Anne Bancroft(perfect for the role) plays the older woman who is, in fact, ""trying to seduce"" Hoffman. The two start a heated affair but one that contains very little conversation. At one hilarious point, Hoffman objects to the silence and says, ""let's talk about art,"" seemingly upset by the fact that their affair contains very little deep conversations.Things get downright comedic when Katherine Ross, portrayed as Elaine Robinson, daughter of Mrs. Robinson, shows up and decides she wants to date Hoffman's character, Ben Braddock. Ben , despite strict objections from the elder Robinson, falls for Elaine and becomes obsessed with her. Things get even more insane when Hoffman follows Elaine to her wedding...only he's not the groom.This is a funny, sassy, witty, and tremendous film.  It set the precedent for future films of the same genre.  You'll love this movie.FINAL NOTE: In The Graduate, we can clearly see signs of where Hoffman gets some of inspiration for later characters, such as his roles in Tootsie and Rain Man.

444758,A20Z1PKIH0PFUF,6305034397,JoeyD,"[6, 7]","This is an atypical review for me folks.  Rather than review this classic film, which most people have already either seen or heard about, I wanted to entice you fans out there to post some commentary on some of the points I have covered below.  After all, Amazon does tell us to 'make it fun'!We all know that this is one of those no-brainer, without-a-doubt comedy classics that is seemingly above reproach (a la ""Some Like It Hot"", ""Annie Hall"", ""Tootsie"", Dr. Strangelove"", etc...).  However, after viewing this one yet AGAIN the other night (my guess is, I've seen this film over twenty times now), I couldn't help but pose these questions: (spoiler alert)1) Would the film be as great w/out the music of Simon & Garfunkel?  In my opinion, few film soundtracks/scores have had a greater impact than this one (not including musicals of course).2) What did Mrs. Robinson find so alluring about Benjamin?  Why would a woman in her position do something so self-destructive when she didn't even seem like she was all that attracted to Benjamin in the first place?  If she was just out for some casual sex w/ a young, pretty boy toy why would she choose to do it w/ one of her best friend's sons?3) How do you explain the beautiful, intelligent, and wholesome character of Elaine Robinson (Katherine Ross) falling in love w/ the shallow, uncharismatic, aloof Benjamin?  They only went on one date and he took her to a strip club for God sakes!!!  Then he begins to stalk her!  To all you young cats out there, I can tell you that this approach usually will get you thrown into prison and/or getting your butt kicked by the girl's father, brother, or friends.4) Would any woman, no matter what the circumstances, want to get involved with a guy who just spent the last several months making the beast w/ two backs w/ her mother?  Not only is it completely repulsive and vulgar, but how do you ever forget about something like that, let alone forgive it?  The thought of it makes my skin crawl.5) How do you propose to a woman you barely know?  How does that woman even remotely take you seriously (we are talking about a beautiful, well-to-do, educated young woman w/ seemingly everything going for her)?  And that's not even taking into account Ben's sordid affair w/ mom.6) Supposedly Benjamin is rebelling against conformity and the conventional, artificial (PLASTICS!) world that his affluent parents and their friends subscribe to.  However, he has no problems still living at home, laying on a raft all day in their pool drinking beer and working on his tan.  To me, that's not being a rebel, that's being a spoiled, rich kid bum!7) And last, but certainly not least (for I could go on for days), are there really any endearing characteristics about Benjamin at all?  To me, he is a lazy, spoiled, self-absorbed, unambitious, aloof, whiny loner w/ almost zero charisma.  The guy doesn't have one friend!  For example, at his graduation party there was not one person there his own age.  The guy is completely anti-social to everyone he meets.Yet, despite the contrived love story and illicit romance, this film does work and is quite entertaining, mainly because of the great cinematography, writing, music, directing and acting.  In my humble opinion, Bancroft stole the show and I only wish she had more time on screen.  And Katherine Ross not only possesses the prettiest brown eyes you'll ever see, but by the end of the film we all can't help but to fall in love w/ her winsome, wholesome ways.",4,"However, upon further review...",1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,3504,"['atypical', 'review', 'folks', 'Rather', 'review', 'classic', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'either', 'seen', 'heard', 'wanted', 'entice', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'post', 'commentary', 'points', 'have', 'covered', 'Amazon', 'tell', ""'make"", 'know', 'one', 'no-brainer', 'without-a-doubt', 'comedy', 'classics', 'seemingly', 'above', 'reproach', 'la', 'Hot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Tootsie', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'etc', 'However', 'viewing', 'one', 'yet', 'AGAIN', 'other', 'night', 'guess', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'twenty', 'times', 'now', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'pose', 'questions', 'spoiler', 'alert', '1', 'Would', 'film', 'be', 'great', 'music', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'opinion', 'few', 'film', 'soundtracks/scores', 'have', 'had', 'greater', 'impact', 'one', 'not', 'including', 'musicals', 'course', '.2', 'What', 'did', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'find', 'so', 'alluring', 'Benjamin', 'Why', 'would', 'woman', 'position', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'self-destructive', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'was', 'attracted', 'Benjamin', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'just', 'out', 'casual', 'sex', 'w/', 'young', 'pretty', 'boy', 'toy', 'why', 'would', 'choose', 'do', 'w/', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'sons', '3', 'How', 'do', 'explain', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'wholesome', 'character', 'Elaine', 'Robinson', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'falling', 'love', 'w/', 'shallow', 'uncharismatic', 'aloof', 'Benjamin', 'only', 'went', 'one', 'date', 'took', 'strip', 'club', 'God', 'Then', 'stalk', 'young', 'cats', 'there', 'can', 'tell', 'approach', 'usually', 'will', 'get', 'thrown', 'prison', 'getting', 'butt', 'kicked', 'girl', 'father', 'brother', 'friends.4', 'Would', 'woman', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstances', 'want', 'get', 'involved', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'spent', 'last', 'several', 'months', 'making', 'beast', 'w/', 'two', 'backs', 'w/', 'mother', 'Not', 'only', 'completely', 'repulsive', 'vulgar', 'how', 'do', 'ever', 'forget', 'something', 'let', 'alone', 'forgive', 'thought', 'skin', 'crawl.5', 'How', 'do', 'propose', 'woman', 'barely', 'know', 'How', 'woman', 'even', 'remotely', 'take', 'seriously', 'are', 'talking', 'beautiful', 'well-to-do', 'educated', 'young', 'woman', 'seemingly', 'everything', 'going', 'not', 'even', 'taking', 'account', 'Ben', 'sordid', 'affair', 'mom.6', 'Supposedly', 'Benjamin', 'rebelling', 'conformity', 'conventional', 'artificial', 'PLASTICS', 'world', 'affluent', 'parents', 'friends', 'subscribe', 'However', 'problems', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'laying', 'raft', 'day', 'pool', 'drinking', 'beer', 'working', 'tan', 'not', 'being', 'rebel', 'being', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'kid', 'bum', '7', 'last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'could', 'go', 'days', 'are', 'there', 'really', 'endearing', 'characteristics', 'Benjamin', 'lazy', 'spoiled', 'self-absorbed', 'unambitious', 'aloof', 'whiny', 'loner', 'almost', 'zero', 'charisma', 'guy', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'friend', 'example', 'graduation', 'party', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'own', 'age', 'guy', 'completely', 'anti-social', 'everyone', 'contrived', 'love', 'story', 'illicit', 'romance', 'film', 'work', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'mainly', 'great', 'cinematography', 'writing', 'music', 'directing', 'acting', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Bancroft', 'stole', 'show', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'screen', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'not', 'only', 'prettiest', 'brown', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'end', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'w/', 'winsome', 'wholesome', 'ways']",The Graduate

444762,A33TED651NAXWU,6305034397,"Johnny Williams ""High School History Teacher""","[1, 1]","**Spoiler Alert****Spoiler Alert**The Graduate was a unique movie for its time because of when it was made, who the actors were, and how America itself was changing.  The movie made during the Vietnam War, and agitators are mentioned a couple of times during the film.  Anti-war demonstrations were being conducted on college campuses all around the United States, especially at Berkeley, the university highlighted through much of the film.It however must be said that the movie only touches upon this fact, the analysis of the movie goes into deeper historical context than just the war which was going on at the time the movie was filmed.  So much culture was changing in America at that time.  Some things that stand out in the movie are the generational gap, between the older people and the younger ones.  The older more mature people whose lives are already defined, such as Ben's Parents represent an older America who represents old values, traditions, good morals and an old time America in which the father was the main provider for the family and knew what best for the family.  The younger generation thought that the older was nave, didn't understand them, and didn't get what was really going on.The older generation had a defined family setting, the nuclear family, again traditional that was to be seen as the best parts of that, however we can see that as Elain's father is divorcing her mother that this area in America is beginning to fail and more and more marriages are falling apart ending in divorce.  Perhaps alluding to the ""Free love"" that was espoused during that period in history, to break the bonds of matrimony and live free, and just ""shack up"".This ""Free love"" might be able to possibly extend to Mrs. Robinson, the women whom seduced Ben.  Women seducing men was unheard of during that time, let alone a woman of this age difference, yet so many things can be taken from the se4duction itself that lets us know how America is changing.  Take a look at the naivety of Ben, as he drives her home, get out of his car, accompanies her to the door, goes inside, gets a drink, head up to her bedroom, helps her dress off, and all this time, not up until, the very end has he any idea whatsoever that she wants to seduce him.  The seduction by women was unheard of in society, let alone a movie and repeated small brief flashes of her breast was unheard of at the time as well.  The movie makers where testing the waters, and telling the ratings boards that America isn't this Nave, that they can handle brief nudity in films and that they shouldn't have the belief that the culture isn't changing between the older and the younger, because it is.Even after the seduction by Mrs. Robinson Ben is still in the precarious situation of not knowing what he wants to be, though he does know what he don't want to be, and that is like his parents and the people of his parents' generation.  The movie plays upon this as that they are not above their own faults; Mrs. Robinson has a long lived love affair with Ben, all the while cheating on her own husband with a boy half her age.  Totally unheard of and still a very great fault portrayed by her that the older generation might not be so traditional in values after all, so who are they to tell the younger generation how to live, how to act, and what to say, especially so after they have succumbed to their own form of evil?However upon further inspection of Ben's character we can see that he thought of Mrs. Robinson as his only way out.  One of the early scenes Mrs. Robinson throws Ben's car keys in the fish tank.  This could represent several things.  Firstly that Mr's Robinson was the key to what he wanted and the freedom he so much thought he deserved.  He was just like a fish in the fish tank, caught in an area with very little move room and a go nowhere but in circles attitude unsure of what was happening or which way to go.  We see this played out again as he is in a diving suit in the pool, he tries to come back up but his parents just push him right back down.  Mrs. Robinson could be seen as his way out from a trapped existence, and she was the ""key"" to doing so.All in this entire movie is about a transitional change from a more conservative culture to a more liberal one.  This stance is repeated many times throughout the course of the film.  It plays upon the fact that love can be used for ill or for gain.  The differences between right and wrong is not always clear, and that lust and love are two different things, and while the movie challenges us to think about it in terms of a changing America in an antiwar type of culture, it still manages to entertain and tell us things about the human condition in that we are all human and just as likely to fail as to win and the winds of cultural change will blow no matter how hard you hold out.",5,And Here's To You Mrs. Robinson...,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,4849,"['**Spoiler', 'Alert****Spoiler', 'Alert**The', 'Graduate', 'was', 'unique', 'movie',

444763,ABX7SEE84DMLU,6305034397,John P Bernat,"[5, 7]","Mike Nichols went from a successful career as a comedian to a successful career as a filmmaker.  He was smart, funny and pointed in his view of American life.Buck Henry, the screenwriter, is no less brilliant.  This collaboration was magical and influenced a generation of movies.  Its greatest irony, though, is that ""the counterculture"" embraced the film as an anti-establishment statement.  Actually, it's not.Viewing it today can be seen as ""dated,"" but it also allows us to separate the social themes of 1967 (especially Viet Nam) from the appeal to the universal.  As Ross Perot, used to say, look, it's simple:1.  Sex can be exploitative.  Mrs. Robinson has to have Ben because she is a self-confessed alcoholic who is also a sex addict.  She seems to have no more respect or affection for Ben than she would for a vibrator;  in fact, she's openly contemptuous of him.2.  Romance can be narcissism.  Ben wants Elaine because he sees ""a better Ben"" in her eyes.  He doesn't know the first thing about her except that he likes himself better when he's with her.  We fall in love with ourselves when we fall in love, and are denied the clarity of accurate self-perception just when we need it most.3.  The literary impulse to romance proposed can seal the illusion.  Elaine leaves with Ben and gets on the bus;  Nichols' mastery is to show the two of them, at length, not interacting with one another at all, but staring blankly at the people and world around them, dazed.

444766,A25CQTB313XDWO,6305034397,"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland""","[0, 2]","Without giving spoilers away, I immediately see parallels that can be drawn between Groundhog Day and The Graduate. The main characters are individuals who, in their own way, are seeking happiness. Unlike Bill Murray's character in Groundhog Day, Hoffmann's Benjamin Braddock does not have the predicament or fortune, depending on how you look at it, of facing a ""nine lives"" way of living and reliving the exact same calendar day until he gets his life squared up and in order.In both movies, there is plenty of stumbling and bumbling and repetitive, aimless wandering reminiscent of La Dolce Vita. Braddock is faced with several obstacles in his pursuit of happiness. He has just graduated from college and is expected to get a job and live out a life that is prescribed or envisioned by his parents and nearby locals.Though he is a bit of an egoist and an egotist, Benjamin Braddock is willing to go against the grain to sort things out in his life and determine what his underlying sources of happiness truly are. This type of searching often puts him at odds with others, in fact, practically everyone else, and perhaps rightfully so, but the viewer almost cannot help but admire the ""It ain't over 'til it's over"" perseverance that comes to define this character.In sum, after having also read and done a review of Ayn Rand's novel, We the Living, a book about a girl who is willing to sacrifice her personal safety in pursuit of her dreams, I conclude that The Graduate is a 1960's movie adaptation of this work but in a Western society with much fewer societal perils.

It is said that she came to resent the way she was remembered by the mass public only for her role in THE GRADUATE, bemoaning the fact that even her best screen work (playing Annie Sullivan in Arthur Penn's film of THE MIRACLE WORKER, for which she won the Oscar) was in its shadow.  Any real fan of Anne Bancroft can remember dozens of great performances she gave us over the fifty years she spent in show business, all the way from screaming her lungs out in GORILLA AT LARGE to her suicidal existentialist in THE SLENDER THREAD with Sidney Poitier as the psychiatrist who tries to help her.Everyone knows that she was not the first choice to play Mrs Robinson and that Mike Nichols lobbied hard to persuade Doris Day to take the part.  Similarly, she only wound up playing the lead in John Ford's ""Eastern"" SEVEN WOMEN (his last narrative film) when Patricia Neal had her terrible stroke.  Bancroft was gallant, reliable, game for anything, and she was also extremely magnetic.  The other day we were watching THE TURNING POINT, Herbert Ross' ballet movie-slash-continual catfight, which cast her opposite the reoubtable Shirley MacLaine.  No disrespect to Miss MacLaine, but when Bancroft is on the screen, as the aging prima donna Emma Jacklin, there's no way you can take your eyes off of her.She was memorable also in AGNES OF GOD, with Margaux Hemingway in LIPSTICK, and booklovers everywhere identified with her Helene Hanff, the American woman with a thing for London bookstores and the men who staff them, in 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD opposite Anthony Hopkins.No matter what the part, big or small, Bancroft was always amazing, and always classy, and that's what made her such a good screen partner (and life partner) to the unapologetically vulgar Mel Brooks.  Together they formed a Hollywood relationship unlike all the others.  We mourn her death and extend our condolences to him and to their family.

I was most impressed with the selection of films for the quarter. One was called ""The Graduate,"" and I had never seen this popular film, but knew it was highly regarded. From the very first scene when Ben is on the airplane to the last scene on the bus, I could finally pick my favorite movie of all time. Directed by the acclaimed Mike Nichols and the screenplay written by Buck Henry, this film is based around Ben (Dustin Hoffman), a recent college graduate who returns home only to become even more confused about life and its obstacles. On his arrival, Mrs. Robinson ( Anne Bancroft), a friend of his parents for sometime seduces Ben in having an affair with each other. Ben continues to worry about his future, so he decides to engage in the opportunity. Later he is pressed with taking her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) on a date. All chaos ensues and Ben must try to solve what he has caused. An excellent plot and the timing is just right on. Simon and Garfunkel helped with the hit song ""Mrs. Robinson"" that was specifically for the movie. Although I am usually not a fan of zooming, Nichols using this effect masterfully. Definitely my favorite flick! ""One word. Are you listening?

444782,ASSCA9IS0GWF5,6305034397,Laszlo Matyas,"[0, 0]","Like J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye, The Graduate is an offbeat, tenderly funny and ultimately poignant tale of alienation and youthful angst. It's a coming-of-age story that manages to avoid the pitfalls and platitudes that tend to plague the genre, and winds up saying something truly original about growing up in the modern world, about coming to terms with our futures and confusions, about understanding the people around us, about finding our way and falling in love. It does so with a quiet sense of humor, a perennially wistful tone, and a really cool Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack.The people behind the film are wonderful- Dustan Hoffman plays the role of Ben Braddock (the film's protagonist and titular character) with just the right mix of starry-eyed introspection and sly wit, earning our sympathies before the opening credits are over and keeping us on his side through the cathartic finale. Anne Bancroft takes on the role of the nigh-on-legendary Mrs. Robinson with smoldering sexuality and a sharp sociopathic edge. The script is a mixture of stinging satire and tender, clich&eacute;-free romance, with plenty of memorable lines and iconic images.The result is a classic movie, and one that every human being with a pulse should see (preferably before they turn 25).",5,"""A nation turns its lonely eyes to you...""",1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,1292,"['J.D', 'Salinger', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'Graduate', 'offbeat', 'tenderly', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'poignant', 'tale', 'alienation', 'youthful', 'angst', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'avoid', 'pitfalls', 'platitudes', 'tend', 'plague', 'genre', 'up', 'saying', 'something', 'truly', 'original', 'growing', 'up', 'modern', 'world', 'about', 'coming', 'terms', 'futures', 'confusions', 'understanding', 'people', 'finding', 'way', 'falling', 'love', 'so', 'quiet', 'sense', 'humor', 'perennially', 'wistful', 'tone', 'really', 'cool', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'soundtrack.The', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful-', 'Dustan', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'Ben', 'Braddock', 'film', 'protagonist', 'titular', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'starry-eyed', 'introspection', 'sly', 'wit', 'earning', 'sympathies', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'keeping', 'side', 'cathartic', 'finale', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'role', 'nigh-on-legendary', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'smoldering', 'sexuality', 'sharp', 'sociopathic', 'edge', 'script', 'mixture', 'stinging', 'satire', 'tender', 'clich', 'eacute', '-free', 'romance', 'plenty', 'memorable', 'lines', 'iconic', 'images.The', 'result', 'classic', 'movie', 'one', 'human', 'being', 'pulse', 'should', 'see', 'preferably', 'turn', '25']",The Graduate

Dustin is superb as the college grad that has always done well, but is now sort of aimless and confused about what to do next. He's pounced on by a female friend of his parents, and doesn't put up much resistance as she seduces him. He's not quite sure what to do - he doesn't want it to be just sexual, but she resists any attempt to make it more. His parents try to get to know him, but are inept at it. The daughter of his lover appeals to him in her 'normalcy' ... and he finally has to take a stand and figure out what he really does want.The acting is great, the dialogue is great, and even the cinematography is excellent in conveying the mood of the various scenes. The soundtrack works extremely well with the atmosphere.The special features on the DVD are very eye-opening. The one that struck me the most involves the scene near the end in the church, where Dustin is pounding on the glass with his arms wide. It seems to be a very strong 'Jesus' symbolism ... but as the 'making of' explains, he *had* to do it that way so that there was no risk of breaking the glass.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 2]","This film changed the formula of how films were made, breaking taboos and using, oh my goodness, serious pop music as the soundtrack. A bit dated for today's audience, this film still retains the art that made it more than entertainment.Back in the days when it was more common for students to skip grades, Benjamin was set up as the brilliant prodigal son, graduating from college early and ready to conquer the world. However, Benjamin was his own lost generation. The world of hippies, flower power and the generational yearning to change the world was happening all around Benjamin, and he was caught in the molasses of upper-middle-class America. His parents and all their friends expected Benjamin to get a job in business somewhere, and follow in path of his parents and their friends. This conflict is the essence of the movie.Throughout the movie Dustin Hoffman is reminded of how he feels trapped in a world he did not make. The monkeys in the zoo, pounding the glass in the window of the church, even at the very end, looking through the glass in the back of the bus, the entire movie is a constant reminder that Benjamin is trapped, even if the trap is in his own mind.Anne Bancroft plays the Mrs. Robinson of the Simon and Garfunkel song. Extremely manipulative of her daughter and Dustin, she is the character that Dustin Hoffman must overcome. Elaine Robinson, who Benjamin finds he is in love with and wants to marry, is played by the beautiful Katharine Ross. Katharine has already fallen into the path laid by her parents, but through her relationship with Dustin she finds that she is intrigued by a world of which Dustin has only given her a glimpse.The cast includes numerous other names that are very recognizable today, including a very young Richard Dreyfuss. Adding the artistic beauty of the cinematography, the incredible acting by not only the lead actors but all the supporting actors, and the score by Simon and Garfunkel, this movie was virtually an instant classic that has served as an example for dozens of artistic movies through the present day.

True it's not the typical story told in the most believable way.  But the movie is about more than this one young man, and it's about more than just the 60s.  It's about an entire generation in the middle of changing.  This movie captures the chaos that is change.This is not necessarily the lighthearted funny movie, nor is it the carefully scripted drama.  It's a mix of the absurd with the all too real.  In the end, every thing has a place in this movie. Many of the elements seem more suitable for an avant-garde film project than a major motion picture release.  But for those who love experimentation in movies, as well as good stories being told on screen, there is MUCH to appreciate here.The acting performances by Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katherine Ross are all stellar, and the music of Simon and Garfunkel is molded to fit every scene perfectly. True, a lot has been said about these things. Still, they are so good that one cannot say enough about them.  Hoffman and Bancroft in particular truly do give performances of their lifetimes.  It's not easy to capture the angst of a confused and needy boy in the middle of becoming a man.  It's not easy to capture the cold calculation of a woman who wants nothing more than for once to get what she really wants.  On both fronts, mission accomplished. And the music is one of the best scores written for a film ever.The cinematography is some of the most interesting ever.  Studying it could be the sole focus of an entire graduate film program, and they still not might be able to cover it in its entirety.  It's hard to describe the power of scenes like after Hoffman reveals to his girlfriend that her mother was the woman he was with.  As he walks away defeated, the camera pans out and the look in Mrs. Robinson's eyes says she knows she's been defeated too.  ""Goodbye Benjamin,"" she says coldly.  It's just one example of truly pivotal work in the history of film-making.  Like Citizen Kane, this movie is a giant of visual arts.Some comentators more knowledgable than I have noted technical weaknesses in the video transfer and screen definition of the film.

444792,A6EQ3CFA02C57,6305034397,Martin Andersen,"[9, 9]","(Sorry, couldn't resist the pun on that one;)This release was quite a positive surprise; considering it was not really something I expected to benefit greatly in getting the high-def treatment. However, the picture quality is very respectable throughout, and does not appear to have been artificially ""souped-up"" with edge-enhancement or digital noise reduction. It does have a few (mostly scenery or reduced-lighting scenes) which do show the age if one looks closely, but still I have to admit that it looked pretty fresh for being a 40+ year old catalog title.The audio I did expect to benefit greatly from being remastered into lossless 5.1, though, and the DTS HD Master Audio track delivered in spades. Both the dialogue--which is clear and intelligible throughout--but not least the excellent music by Simon & Garfunkel makes this worth buying just for the soundtrack alone.As for the movie itself, the performance by Dustin Hoffman is superb--I feel he perfectly captured all the mannerisms; the awkwardness & uneasiness his character exhibits after being thrust into the situations by the also brilliant Anne Bancroft (in an iconic performance)--in a way that is so subtle but still hilariously funny at the same time--that it deserves some major credit (this was after all his first major role.) I notice another reviewer mentioned that he came across as ""annoying""--which just shows what a great performance it really is (not that this reviewer thought so, but I can see how it can be interpreted that way)The directing is also flawless, and a Mike Nichols movie through and through. (Only bettered by Catch-22 in my opinion--can't wait to see that on this format as well!)All in all, a true gem that can be highly recommended.

444793,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6305034397,Martin Asiner,"[8, 10]","Nearly everyone who has seen THE GRADUATE hails it as a major masterpiece of American cinema.  The AFI poll places it at #7 on its all-time hit list.  There are reasons why this film was such a monster hit that can still resonate with a new generation that usually puts down whatever their parents held up as classic.  THE GRADUATE is alternatingly hilarious, serious, undecided, and sexual, exactly the mix that appeals across the board to any generation.  When it was released in 1967, the Baby Boomers were roughly the same age as Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman was then a surprising 30, with Anne Bancroft 36). When Ben walks down the stairs to his living room, he is not only being introduced to his parents' guests, he is a surrogate male deb presented to a then post baby boom and pre-Vietnam society that had riches, power, and education but nowhere to turn to use them.  Much of the power of the film lies in a series of vignettes that illustrate this gap between the earnest callowness of youth and the foolish, sometimes vindictive ingrained attitudes of Ben's family and of the vicious Queen Bee herself, Mrs. Robinson.  The 'plastics' scene has been endlessly debated as to its symbolism, but given its context, it more likely refers to the slightly sardonic choice between Ben's unwillingness to act and the older generation's Depression Era habit of requiring all of the next generation to act. Have you noticed that every adult in the film older than Ben is either foolish, mean-spirited, or cowardly?  Certainly Ben has.  It must not have been easy for him to be unfailingly polite to all those whom he must have seen as confrontational. The seduction scenes between Ben and Mrs.Robinson are both funny and pathetic.  Funny in that she has a world of sophistication that constantly exposes his lack of it.  Pathetic in that she establishes in concrete that in this relation she is the boss, leaving both Ben and the viewer to wonder where her antagonism toward her daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross) is coming from.  When I watched the movie again recently, I paid more attention to the relation between mother and daughter than to mother and lover.  Nowhere does Mrs.Robinson show any maternal love for Elaine. Instead, what we see is a competition between the reigning Queen and an upstart princess pretender who is not even aware of the existence of this competition. Their time together on screen in short, but what there is evidences a conflict that climaxes in the church marriage of Elaine to Carl Smith.  Ben shouts out Elaine's name, while tapping on a window.  Elaine shouts back, while her mother slaps her face.  When Ben and Elaine fight their way out using yet another heavily symbolic prop, a massive crucifix, the battle between them and her parents is seen more as a battle between the wandering youth generation of 1967 and an earlier one that was hardened by the Depression and the Second World War, both of which carried no emotional wallop except to those that endured them.Those who try to encapsulate the lasting power of the movie usually focus on the standout scenes: plastics, the frontdesk bell ringing in the hotel, the 'I think you are scum' invective delivered by Elaine's father, the terrific songs of Simon and Garfunkel whose lyrics and themes punctuate Ben's evolving perspective.  Yet, one of the least analyzed moments comes at the very end when Ben and Elaine dash out of the church, she in a wedding gown, he in a jogging suit, to seek refuge in a passing bus. As they sit in the back, to the consternation of all the other passengers, the camera lingers on Ben's and Elaine's faces.  Their expressions are at first ecstatically happy.  Bit by bit though, their expressions take on a more somber hue.  They do not even look at each other.  It is as if now for the first time in the film for both, that they realize that up until that very moment, life's consequences could be evaded, avoided, or deterred.  Now they know differently.  They may in fact love one another, but each has been rudely yanked out of their comfortable Southern California affluent life to live in the real world where maturity is but one asset needed to enjoy that love. THE GRADUATE is a magnificent ensemble of sight, sound, mood, and acting, but it is this subtle call to the need to reach out for a mature perspective about why we do things the way that we do that makes this movie as timeless now as it was back in 1967.",5,The Graduate: One Step on the Road to Maturity,1027814400,"07 28, 2002",2002,4456,"['Nearly', 'everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', 'major', 'masterpiece', 'American', 'cinema', 'AFI', 'poll', '7', 'all-time', 'hit', 'list', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'monster', 'hit', 'can', 'still', 'resonate', 'new', 'generation', 'usually', 'down', 'parents', 'held', 'up', 'classic', 'GRADUATE', 'alternatingly', 'hilarious', 'serious', 'undecided', 'sexual', 'exactly', 'mix', 'appeals', 'board', 'generation', 'When', 'was', 'released', '1967', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'were', 'roughly', 'same', 'age', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'then', 'surprising', '30', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', '36', 'When', 'Ben', 'walks', 'down', 'stairs', 'living', 'room', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'introduced', 'parents', 'guests', 'surrogate', 'male', 'deb', 'presented', 'then', 'post', 'baby', 'boom', 'pre-Vietnam', 'society', 'had', 'riches', 'power', 'education', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'use', 'Much', 'power', 'film', 'series', 'vignettes', 'illustrate', 'gap', 'earnest', 'callowness', 'youth', 'foolish', 'sometimes', 'vindictive', 'ingrained', 'attitudes', 'Ben', 'family', 'vicious', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', ""'plastics"", 'scene', 'been', 'endlessly', 'debated', 'symbolism', 'given', 'context', 'more', 'likely', 'refers', 'slightly', 'sardonic', 'choice', 'Ben', 'unwillingness', 'act', 'older', 'generation', 'Depression', 'Era', 'habit', 'requiring', 'next', 'generation', 'act', 'Have', 'noticed', 'adult', 'film', 'older', 'Ben', 'foolish', 'mean-spirited', 'cowardly', 'Certainly', 'Ben', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'be', 'unfailingly', 'polite', 'whom', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'confrontational', 'seduction', 'scenes', 'Ben', 'Mrs.Robinson', 'are', 'funny', 'pathetic', 'Funny', 'world', 'sophistication', 'constantly', 'lack', 'Pathetic', 'concrete', 'relation', 'boss', 'leaving', 'Ben', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'where', 'antagonism', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'coming', 'When', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'recently', 'paid', 'more', 'attention', 'relation', 'mother', 'daughter', 'mother', 'lover', 'Nowhere', 'Mrs.Robinson', 'show', 'maternal', 'love', 'Elaine', 'Instead', 'what', 'see', 'competition', 'reigning', 'Queen', 'upstart', 'princess', 'pretender', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'aware', 'existence', 'competition', 'time', 'together', 'screen', 'short', 'what', 'evidences', 'conflict', 'church', 'marriage', 'Elaine', 'Carl', 'Smith', 'Ben', 'out', 'Elaine', 'name', 'tapping', 'window', 'Elaine', 'back', 'mother', 'face', 'When', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'fight', 'way', 'using', 'yet', 'heavily', 'symbolic', 'prop', 'massive', 'crucifix', 'battle', 'parents', 'seen', 'more', 'battle', 'wandering', 'youth', 'generation', '1967', 'earlier', 'one', 'was', 'hardened', 'Depression', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'carried', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'endured', 'them.Those', 'who', 'try', 'encapsulate', 'lasting', 'power', 'movie', 'usually', 'focus', 'standout', 'scenes', 'plastics', 'frontdesk', 'bell', 'ringing', 'hotel', 'think', 'are', 'scum', 'invective', 'delivered', 'Elaine', 'father', 'terrific', 'songs', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'lyrics', 'themes', 'punctuate', 'Ben', 'evolving', 'perspective', 'one', 'least', 'analyzed', 'moments', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'dash', 'church', 'wedding', 'gown', 'jogging', 'suit', 'seek', 'refuge', 'passing', 'bus', 'sit', 'back', 'consternation', 'other', 'passengers', 'camera', 'Ben', 'Elaine', 'expressions', 'are', 'first', 'ecstatically', 'happy', 'Bit', 'bit', 'expressions', 'take', 'more', 'somber', 'hue', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'look', 'other', 'now', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'realize', 'up', 'very', 'moment', 'life', 'consequences', 'could', 'be', 'evaded', 'avoided', 'deterred', 'Now', 'know', 'differently', 'may', 'fact', 'one', 'been', 'rudely', 'yanked', 'comfortable', 'Southern', 'California', 'affluent', 'life', 'live', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'maturity', 'one', 'asset', 'needed', 'enjoy', 'love', 'GRADUATE', 'magnificent', 'ensemble', 'sight', 'sound', 'mood', 'acting', 'subtle', 'call', 'need', 'reach', 'out', 'mature', 'perspective', 'why', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'do', 'movie', 'timeless', 'now', 'was', 'back', '1967']",The Graduate
444794,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6305034397,Marty Gillis,"[10, 10]","This review pertains to the Blu Ray release of The Graduate and as such is not concerned with the movie itself but the quality of the transfer, sound and extras.I am a child of the 60's and enjoy almost all the popular culture from that era with just a few exceptions.  The Graduate has so much going for it that it was a no brainer for me to purchase this Blu Ray.  The 2nd film appearance by Dustin Hoffman and 2nd directing job for Mike Nichols plus a stellar supporting cast and superior writing by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham make The Graduate a must see for mature movie lovers and a must own on Blu Ray if you are a collector of classic films.Overall this is a good solid upgrade from the DVD (which is also included in this package) although this is not the dazzling image one might hope for.  The Graduate is presented on a 25GB single layer disc and as such the ""wow factor"" and ""pop"" is missing most of the time.  The colors are good and strong and except for one moment where a horizontal white streak flashes across the screen for less than 1 second the image is stable.  I can't figure out what the cause of this streak is but it occurs just after Mrs. Robinson invites Benjamin inside her home and they are walking down the hallway to the living room area. I froze the frame and watched it in slow motion a number of times to try and see what was causing it.  To me this flaw looks like an authoring mistake of some sort and not a film blemish but you can decide for yourself. It was the only such instance in the entire film of anything actually wrong with the visual presentation.The image does go soft a number of times but not to the point where it ruins the illusion of film.  A good remastering job would work wonders for this title as the original elements appear to be in very good shape and most likely a nice 4k rescanning job would work wonders all by itself.  Oh well, we have what we have and it is more than watchable.  The bit rate is a bit low in the low 20's and I can't help but feel a dual layered disc with a higher bit rate may have yielded a much better result.The most solid area of improvement is claimed by the soundtrack presented in DTS HD Master Audio.  The dialogue is reproduced as originally recorded and you will not be straining to hear what the actors are saying.  This was originally a 4-track stereo presentation in at least some theaters so that suggests the people who transferred the film to Blu Ray had at least 4 audio ""stems"" to work with when creating this new surround mix.  Of course the most obvious improvement is in the fidelity of the Paul Simon written and Simon and Garfunkel performed songs.  Unfortunately the version of ""Mrs. Robinson"" that is part of this films soundtrack is NOT the well known single version but rather a mostly acoustic version with altered lyrics and slightly different melody.  The two songs used the most were ""Sounds of Silence"" and ""Scarborough Fair""  which are both repeated at least twice. The level of sonic improvement is truly remarkable and if you are a fan of these songs it will spoil you and render even the remastered CD versions as inferior to these mixes.The surrounds are occasional employed for ambiance , background sounds, and a few dramatic front to back pans for the sports car scenes.  For a film released back in 1967 this is a VERY good sounding audio mix, especially with the low budget they had to work with back then.  Interestingly enough, this film is currently rated at #19 for the all time highest grossing films , raking in more than 104 million at the box office after a modest 3 million was spent on production.It is a big plus you can choose between the remixed 5.1 mix or stick with the original mono for purities sake!  I went with the 5.1 in DTS HD Master Audio format and never felt I was missing anything. MY only REAL complain about this two disc set is except for the original trailer (in SD on both discs) you get ZERO bonus features. No commentaries or documentaries. Nothing.  With all the historical and artistic significance this film lays claim to, it is pretty cheesy that nothing was done to include some extras for this release.  But the film is here, it looks reasonably good, MUCH BETTER than the DVD counterpart and has a vastly improved soundtrack.The Graduate is a true classic and as such deserves to be in your film library.

444798,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6305034397,Mike Stone,"[3, 6]","Wes Anderson (director of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") has said that when he and Owen Wilson hit a block in one of their scripts, they (consciously or not) steal something from ""The Graduate"".  Magically, everything gets back on track.  Being a huge fan of Anderson and Wilson's work, I figured I'd give ""The Graduate"" another try.  My first viewing left me underwhelmed.  Amused, but underwhelmed.  But seeing it again, with freshly graduated eyes, it's a different story.  The film is damn near perfect.The first act can be off-putting.  It was to me.  Less concerned with reality than with tone, it comes off as little more than self-obsessed parody, enamored with its own jokes (""Plastics!"" has become stale with time) and the angst of its protagonist.  And with the benefit of hindsight, Dustin Hoffman's clipped monotonic speech makes it appear like he's playing a younger version of Raymond Babbitt than the newly graduated Benjamin Braddock.  Thankfully, things relax when Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) comes on the scene, and the film can get down to brass tacks.Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson's seduction scene is a wonder of comic awkwardness.  While she's in total control and full of ennui, he's sweating and stumbling while trying to hatch an escape route.  But he stays.  And the next sequence, their inevitable coupling, is ludicrous on several levels.  First, it revels in the cheeky double entendres paranoiacally swirling around Ben's head (Buck Henry, as a hotel desk clerk, asks innocently, ""Are you here for an *affair*, sir?""; ""Wood?"" asks Ben of Mrs. Robinson, gauging her preference of clothes hangers, instead of making a pass, as she nearly assumes).  Second, it is underscored by Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sounds of Silence'.  The song choice is ludicrous because its dulcet tones would seem to have nothing to do with detached copulation.  But read the lyrics.  Is this not Ben's voice, trying to scream above the ""ten thousand people, maybe more... talking without speaking... hearing without listening""?  In his affair with Mrs. Robinson, Ben is searching for his voice (in the wrong place, as we shall soon see).The bulk of the second act is concerned with Ben meeting and then being rejected by Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter.  The first hour, so nearly perfect in its satire and depiction of Californian malaise, left doubts in me that the second hour could live up to it.  Thankfully, and an equal part of the credit should go to Katharine Ross as Dustin Hoffman, it does.  Hoffman relaxes around Ross, putting on a cloak of easy charisma and charm, allowing the honest emotions of his love to shine through.  Ross, for her part, is always open and receptive to Ben, and even gives back as much as she gets.  Their knee-jerk fall into love is made sensible by the obvious chemistry between the actors.  The act is scored, again paradoxically perfectly, by another S&G; songs, 'Scarborough Fair'.  With its constant wish of ""then she'll be a true love of mine"", it too captures the mood of the sequence perfectly.In act three, Ben tries to redeem himself after all his mistakes.  And thanks to the care the filmmakers took in setting him up, you can't help but feel for Ben as he runs through the streets of Santa Barbara looking for Elaine's wedding.  'Mrs. Robinson', the third major S&G; song used, works here mainly for its ambiguity.  Which one of Ben's women does its titular character represent?  Doesn't matter, really.  Just follow the bouncy beat, hum ""coo coo ca-choo"", and long for the innocent days when Joe DiMaggio held the gaze of a nation's lonely eyes.Many have hypothesized that ""The Graduate"" is about the sixties' youth rebellion.  But in the end, and in the beginning if you look close enough, it's not about rebellion, but conformity on one's own terms.  Ben determines to botch the date his parents set him up on.  But eventually he ends up on a bus with that very same girl, she in her wedding dress, he with a ripped jacket.  He has just stolen her away from a button-down fiancee, and their future together appears to be filled with laughter.  Until, and this happens in a quick moment, the laughter subsides, and they realize they barely know each other.  It's not groundbreaking for me to say that this scene runs the emotional gamut from exhilaration to anxiety in just the expressions on the actors' faces.  But it's worth mentioning one more time for those who've missed it.I didn't expect it to be, but ""The Graduate"" is still fresh today, more than thirty years after its first release.  And it's also about a lot more than adultery, post-graduate misery, and romantic love.  It has much critical to say about the generation from whence it sprang.  I suspect Mike Nichols, whose direction is whimsical and witty without ever being overbearing, and Buck Henry/Calder Willingham, whose screenplay abounds with sharp jokes and sharper observations about human nature, deserve a lot of the credit.  Regardless, ""The Graduate"" is one of those rare films whose appeal and importance hasn't lessened over time; in fact, on both counts, it may have increased.",5,Perfectly clear,1016496000,"03 19,

However because this movie was made during a time when true quality and craftsmanship was appreciated, the themes are delicate and subtle. It really makes you use your imagination and look deeper into the storyline, rather than just the obvious.

Miller,"[17, 46]","I had heard a lot of things before even seeing this film, but I'd never really heard the plot so I was surprised how drawn out, and well, just pointless it all weas.  Yeah I never was interested in the Ms. Robinson/Benjamin relationship, but I had at least assumed that it would not start in the first tenth of the film.  The movie felt arduously lengthy because everything was rushed.  Now that paradox was the only problem, because in general the movie just made too little sense.Hoffman's character for instance goes through this 'Ferris Buehler' transformation (another movie I disliked), and well where did that come from?  The first few minutes he seems happy and is smiling, and then he's upset because well he graduated college, apparently the worst thing in the world, only to still be surrounded by his rich family and friends that could, and would, support him in life.  Yes, class struggles are hard especially when you're on the top.Oh, and Benjamin's stalker tactics with Elaine would land him in jail, and not to the ultimate end of the story (which looks more like a Pacino clip from Scarface.)Lastly, enough about the plot and let's talk soundtrack music.  You know what?  I really love Simon and Garfunkel music, but I also like soundtracks that do not play three songs three times each.  They say this music was etched into the mind of America, and there is a reason for that!

But I am judging it because I liked the film and I can also appreciate fact that  this film was groundbreaking at the time I am giving it four instead of  three stars.Never before had there been a film about someone who is  post-coming of age but still too young to class himself as an adult and the  kind of life, a mish-mash of boredom, identity, duty and frustration, most  of us feel when we are in that often ignored transition phase (ignored by  culture, parents, teachers etc.)  Fresh from college graduate Benjamin  Braddock simply does not know what he wants to do with his life; but he  does know he doesn't feel quite ready to jump into the cosey little life  his ghastly parents have planned for him (ghastly in that they are  insensitive, pushy, self-obsessed and seem to want to show him off as a  reflection on themselves rather than worried about his own happiness). And  so this is the perfect opportunity for Mrs. Robinson a bored alcoholic  housewife who despises her husband to pounce on him. Purely to add some  glamour into his life Benjamin starts an illicit affair with her which  turns nasty once he meets and falls in love with her daughter,  Elaine.Hoffman is terrific as the confused Benjamin adding wonderful  comic timing and making this film throroughly entertaining. Bancroft is  also good as the spiteful and manipulative Mrs. Robinson and Katharine Ross  doesn't do a bad job either as Elaine.I liked the fact that Elaine was  not written as a sickly sweet young thing and you can fully believe in them  as a couple and you can see what they see in eachother.However, I prefer  the stage play version; it offers more insight into Mrs. Robinson and  Elaine but then again I guess I'm biased.But the ending is best on film;  now that wa undeniably good.",4,To Be Fair....,961545600,"06 21, 2000",2000,1923,"['was', ""n't"", 'even', 'twinkle', 'mother', 'eye', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'judge', 'film', 'can', 'spot', 'holes', 'am', 'judging', 'liked', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'time', 'am', 'giving', 'four', 'instead', 'three', 'stars.Never', 'had', 'been', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'post-coming', 'age', 'still', 'too', 'young', 'class', 'adult', 'kind', 'life', 'mish-mash', 'boredom', 'identity', 'duty', 'frustration', 'most', 'feel', 'when', 'are', 'often', 'ignored', 'transition', 'phase', 'ignored', 'culture', 'parents', 'teachers', 'etc', 'Fresh', 'college', 'graduate', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'simply', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'know', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'ready', 'jump', 'cosey', 'little', 'life', 'ghastly', 'parents', 'have', 'planned', 'ghastly', 'are', 'insensitive', 'pushy', 'self-obsessed', 'seem', 'want', 'show', 'off', 'reflection', 'rather', 'worried', 'own', 'happiness', 'so', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'bored', 'alcoholic', 'housewife', 'who', 'husband', 'pounce', 'Purely', 'add', 'glamour', 'life', 'Benjamin', 'illicit', 'affair', 'nasty', 'once', 'love', 'daughter', 'Elaine.Hoffman', 'terrific', 'confused', 'Benjamin', 'adding', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'timing', 'making', 'film', 'throroughly', 'entertaining', 'Bancroft', 'also', 'good', 'spiteful', 'manipulative', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Katharine', 'Ross', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'Elaine.I', 'liked', 'fact', 'Elaine', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'young', 'thing', 'can', 'fully', 'believe', 'couple', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'see', 'eachother.However', 'prefer', 'stage', 'play', 'version', 'more', 'insight', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Elaine', 'then', 'again', 'guess', ""'m"", 'ending', 'best', 'film', 'now', 'wa', 'undeniably', 'good']",The Graduate

I didn't realize until now what a wide influence this film has had.  As I watched it I was reminded of so many later films that stole from it.  So in that sense I can understand why it is considered a classic.Stylistically, ""The Graduate"" scored big.  The first scene where Mrs. Robinson tries to seduce Benjamin completely blew me away.  The way the shots were framed by her leg, and the almost subliminal use of body shots made this the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a PG movie.  And the film has many other interesting shots throughout.I think the only noticeable thing I didn't like in the film was the character work.  With the exception of the Dustin Hoffman character, all the others seemed too contrived to me.  Maybe this is due to the generation gap, but I just couldn't believe how shallow they all were nor how their emotions could change from love to hate and back again so quickly.The picture quality has been restored nicely on the DVD, though the sound quality seems dated, but that's to be expected.I found this movie interesting and entertaining enough, but I didn't fall in love with it.

It manages to give the movie a sort of tension, which it demonstrates in other arenas. The generational gap is one of these themes which plays out throughout the movie. The songs seem to mainly play during moments of this particular tension, such as the scene when Ben is forced into the pool by his parents in his scuba outfit. The music gives the film a certain quality, without which it would be vastly different. Simon and Garfunkel were referred to as the ""voice of a generation,"" and this is exactly what they provide in the movie for Benjamin and Elaine.According to a Variety article by Peter Bart in the 15 May 2005 issue, Nichols had become obsessed with Simon & Garfunkel's music while shooting the film. Lawrence Turman, his producer, made a deal for Simon to write three new songs for the movie. By the time they were nearly finished editing the film, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him for more but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he didn't have the time. He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; ""It's not for the movie... it's a song about times past -- about Mrs. Roosevelt and Joe DiMaggio and stuff.""

I could sympathize with his search for something worthwhile in the days following his graduation from college.  The party scene at his house where all of the adults are asking Benjamin what he is going to do and offering their advice is particularly amusing.  I had a similar experience and was forced to make up answers to appease the questioners.Mrs. Robinson, his friend's attractive mother was also played very well.  Her encounters and advances towards an uncomfortable Benjamin are comic in their portrayal.  In his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, we see Benjamin go from a shy, unconfident boy to a man confident in his sexuality and with his affair with Mrs. Robinson.The Simon and Garfunkel song that is used during transitions is haunting and will ring in your mind for many hours following the movie.

444824,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,6305034397,P Magnum,"[5, 5]","The Graduate is a touchstone film.  Released in 1967, it defined the 60's youth generation.  As recent college graduate Benjamin Braddock is told at a pool party, the future is plastics.  The movie portrays the coming of age, sexual freedom and wayward view of the young adults of the 60's, the almost plastic existence of their future.  Dustin Hoffman stars as Benjamin and it is his breakout role.  He was thirty years old when he filmed the picture, but he perfectly captures the youthful, nave essence of the part.  Anne Bancroft vamps it up as Mrs. Robinson who seduces Benjamin.  Ms. Bancroft brings a sexy and sultry flair to the film and her role as a sexual predator was stunning at the time.  A third star of the film is the soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel.  Their music is liberally intertwine throughout the film, the opening sequence set to ""The Sounds Of Silence"" is dead on and the use ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"" adds a longing, somber note to the picture.  Of course the movie produced the number one hit ""Mrs. Robinson"" which won a Grammy as Record of the Year in 1968.  The film was just the second that Mike Nichols directed.  His first was Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which was departure from his comedic background.  The Graduate is closer to his comedy roots, but he perfectly balances out the humor with dramatic moments.

It sounds typical soap but really goes in directions still unexpected after all these years.The performances are powerful and affecting, even Mike Nichols'.  As the actors brace their characters against one uncomfortable scene after another, Nichols keeps the camera usually very close to Benjamin, which causes an almost subjective and first person narrative while also making the screen very claustrophobic.  And when the camera is far away from Benjamin (and he's looking at himself), he's usually blocked in by something, be it water or Anne Bancroft's (Mrs. Robinson's) legs.Very existential, it's a film that presents a hero who finds himself constantly alone in the world, and even his convictions seem unable to pull him together.  It's not a happy movie, as the final shot of his face shows when he's riding off into the sunset that is definitely not of his dreams.Okay.Now that I'm done with the review proper, I thought I'd point out something interesting I discovered during my recent reviewing of this film.Modern day ""Indie"" music is like this throwback to the acoustic folksy rock of the 60s, so of course sounds a lot like our friends Mssrs Simon and Garfunkel, who of course play the music for this wonderful movie.  Also, Hoffman's hair and dress, along with his painful awkwardness and his conflict with the people who surround him (""people of society"", so to speak), means that if this film was made today, it would be the Ultimate Indie Hipster Film.  Hell, it's practically a Garden State, only without the cheesy happy ending and even better performances.I don't know exactly what that means, or even if it means anything at all.  It's just something really interesting about how this film looks considering contemporary culture.  It's not dated, per se, it's just that a lot of its motifs are weirdly similar to a cheesier and cheaper social subculture, even if it was made almost 40 years earlier.Crazy how things like that work out, huh?--PolarisDiB",5,Existential Quandary,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,2204,"['Back', 'existentialism', 'was', 'cool', 'had', 'Graduate.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'breakout', 'role', 'perfectly', 'backed', 'up', 'story', 'young', '21', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'young', 'girl', 'having', 'affair', 'mother', 'typical', 'soap', 'really', 'directions', 'still', 'unexpected', 'years.The', 'performances', 'are', 'powerful', 'affecting', 'even', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'actors', 'brace', 'characters', 'one', 'uncomfortable', 'scene', 'Nichols', 'camera', 'usually', 'very', 'close', 'Benjamin', 'almost', 'subjective', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'while', 'also', 'making', 'screen', 'very', 'claustrophobic', 'when', 'camera', 'far', 'away', 'Benjamin', 'looking', 'usually', 'blocked', 'something', 'be', 'water', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'legs.Very', 'existential', 'film', 'hero', 'who', 'constantly', 'alone', 'world', 'even', 'convictions', 'seem', 'unable', 'pull', 'together', 'not', 'happy', 'movie', 'final', 'shot', 'face', 'shows', 'when', 'riding', 'off', 'sunset', 'definitely', 'not', 'dreams.Okay.Now', ""'m"", 'done', 'review', 'thought', ""'d"", 'point', 'out', 'something', 'interesting', 'discovered', 'recent', 'reviewing', 'film.Modern', 'day', 'Indie', 'music', 'throwback', 'acoustic', 'folksy', 'rock', '60s', 'so', 'course', 'lot', 'friends', 'Mssrs', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'who', 'course', 'play', 'music', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Also', 'Hoffman', 'hair', 'dress', 'painful', 'awkwardness', 'conflict', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'people', 'society', 'so', 'speak', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'Ultimate', 'Indie', 'Hipster', 'Film', 'Hell', 'practically', 'Garden', 'State', 'only', 'cheesy', 'happy', 'ending', 'even', 'better', 'performances.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'even', 'anything', 'just', 'something', 'really', 'interesting', 'how', 'film', 'considering', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'not', 'dated', 'se', 'just', 'lot', 'motifs', 'are', 'weirdly', 'similar', 'cheesier', 'cheaper', 'social', 'subculture', 'even', 'was', 'made', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'earlier.Crazy', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'huh', 'PolarisDiB']",The Graduate

The film was unlike anything the 60's had ever seen, ahead of its time, bleak, realistic. It portrayed a dismal aspect of non-comformity, the breaking of traditional familie values, in much the same way the recent &quot;American Beauty&quot; portrayed sub-urban America. The film is most famous for the scene in which Mrs. Robinson seduces the young Hoffman (Mrs. Robinson, I think you are trying to seduce me). The affair was scandalous. Not only was she a much older woman, but the mother of her daughter's fiance. The soundtrack was composed by Simon and Gurfunkel, whose song &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; was an instant hit and earned them lasting fame. Including also in the film is the symbolic, melancholy &quot;Sounds Of Silence&quot;.Well-written screenplay, powerful and impressive performances by all the actors, great music, some comedy, irony, realism- this film could have well defined the decadence of the 60's era, a time when &quot;free&quot; love was becoming an established idea, when the seedy, steamy underbelly of suburbia was being excavated.

Four decades later of course it's evolved into ""cougar"". Anyway, Ben Braddock (the young Dustin Hoffman--the role that made him a star) has just got his Bachelor's degree and a new Alfa Romeo as a graduation present (must be nice to be an attorney's kid). His parents (Elizabeth Wilson and the pre-""St. Elsewhere""/ pre-KITT William Daniels) throw a party for him in which everybody is all over him like flies on doo-doo when he'd prefer to just chill out. There's a paradox in that--the party which is ""in your honor"" but which always seems to boil down to everyone else's preferences. One of the guests who is soon all over Ben in a different sort of way is the wife of his Dad's law partner--the soon-to-be-iconic Mrs. Robinson (Anne Baxter). None of the older generation here have first names, you understand. That may be a none-too-subtle sign of the Generation Gap right there.So the virginal Ben embarks on an affair with Mrs. Robinson. Never mind that even back then real college kids were past that hurdle not long after the first Homecoming weekend. Ben's parents are clueless about the affair and blatantly trying to matchmake him with the Robinson daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross). Unbeknownst to them, Mrs. Robinson is dead set against that--her boy-toy with her baby girl--no way no how. Despite her opposition, the two start dating and start getting serious.Some of this movie's shticks age like Ben's Alfa--it looks like a real beater by the last scenes. Like the way Simon & Garfunkel's music gets used--""Scarborough Fair"" is one of my all-time favorite songs of theirs, but in one lengthy scene it gets practically looped like an MP3 player locked on ""repeat"". The tendency of the adults to yammer nonstop at the younger people as if so much as pausing to draw a breath means defeat of some sort.Partial ""spoiler alert"" here--there's a scene at a church in which Ben fights off attackers with the cross off the altar, then as he escapes he slides the cross through the front door handles to bar the door and trap his ""enemies"" inside the sanctuary. Looking back, I can't believe how shocked I was at that ""sacrilege"".Also in the cast is Norman Fell as the landlord of a rooming house Ben stays in during his suit of Elaine, a role Fell reprises a few years later in TV's ""Three's Company"".

444836,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6305034397,Robert Morris,"[5, 7]","As I think about this film,  I am again struck by the fact that films never change, only we do over a period of time (in this instance decades) from the first time we see a film until we most recently see it again. I admire this film as much now as I did in 1967 but for different reasons. Much younger then, of course, I was totally sympathetic with Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) and drew parallels between him and Salinger's Holden Caulfield. Today, I really do not identify with any character in the film even as I appreciate more than before the multi-dimensional social commentary which Mike Nichols makes on that era. In a word, ""plastic."" I consider it both significant and revealing that neither Benjamin's parents nor Elaine Robinson's parents are given first names. Elaine is perfectly portrayed by Katherine Ross, in stunning contrast to Brenda Patimkin played by Ali MacGraw two years later in Goodbye, Columbus. Nichols also integrates seamlessly the script co-authored by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry with the music score (Simon and Garfunkel) and Robert Surtees' cinematography. Also, he selected and coordinated brief but brilliant appearances by Norman Fell (Mr. McLeeiry), Alice Ghostley (Mrs. Singleton), Marion Lorne of ""Mr. Peepers"" fame (Miss DeWitt), and Henry (Hotel Clerk). I even spotted Richard Dreyfuss among the hotel guests. Nichols' brilliant work in his film earned for him an Academy Award as best director.The comic moments are memorable (some indelible) but the humor is essentially bittersweet, as is the humor Nichols created with his former associate Elaine May. How easy to overlook the fact that the film portrays adultery, a relationship which betrays so many others. Also, that the predatory Mrs. Robinson's need for sexual gratification exploits so callously Benjamin's vulnerability as he struggles to decide what to do with his life after graduation from college. For me, the film's title is ironic because, even with his diploma in hand, Benjamin must complete other rites of passage and almost (not quite) loses the decent and uncorrupted young woman he truly loves. As the film ends, he and Elaine sit together at the back of a public bus, staring ahead without apparent emotion at a future which, for them, is assuredly uncertain. Once again, Benjamin must address a question posed earlier, ""Now what?""It remains for cultural anthropologists to comment on this film's sociological significance. As indicated previously, I think so highly of this film because Nichols has brilliantly combined and integrated just about everything a great film requires: a compelling story, great acting and cinematography, memorable (and appropriate) music, and effective use of humor. Many people believe that this film offers a ""window"" to upper-middle class suburban America in the 1960s. Probably it does. But I think it will also continue to be appreciated because it examines certain themes which have defined human experience for several thousand years: the struggle for wisdom, the sometimes necessary loss of innocence, and the transcending power of the human heart.",5,Transcending &quot;Plastic&quot;...Perhaps,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,3106,"['think', 'film', 'am', 'again', 'struck', 'fact', 'films', 'never', 'change', 'only', 'do', 'over', 'period', 'time', 'instance', 'decades', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'most', 'recently', 'see', 'again', 'admire', 'film', 'much', 'now', 'did', '1967', 'different', 'reasons', 'Much', 'younger', 'then', 'course', 'was', 'totally', 'sympathetic', 'Benjamin', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'drew', 'parallels', 'Salinger', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'Today', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'identify', 'character', 'film', 'even', 'appreciate', 'more', 'multi-dimensional', 'social', 'commentary', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'era', 'word', 'plastic', 'consider', 'significant', 'revealing', 'Benjamin', 'parents', 'Elaine', 'Robinson', 'parents', 'are', 'given', 'first', 'names', 'Elaine', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'stunning', 'contrast', 'Brenda', 'Patimkin', 'played', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Goodbye', 'Columbus', 'Nichols', 'also', 'seamlessly', 'script', 'co-authored', 'Calder', 'Willingham', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'music', 'score', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'Robert', 'Surtees', 'cinematography', 'Also', 'selected', 'coordinated', 'brief', 'brilliant', 'appearances', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'Mr.', 'McLeeiry', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'Mrs.', 'Singleton', 'Marion', 'Lorne', 'Mr.', 'Peepers', 'fame', 'Miss', 'DeWitt', 'Henry', 'Hotel', 'Clerk', 'even', 'spotted', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'hotel', 'guests', 'Nichols', 'brilliant', 'work', 'film', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'director.The', 'comic', 'moments', 'are', 'memorable', 'indelible', 'humor', 'essentially', 'bittersweet', 'humor', 'Nichols', 'created', 'former', 'associate', 'Elaine', 'May', 'How', 'easy', 'overlook', 'fact', 'film', 'adultery', 'relationship', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Also', 'predatory', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'need', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'exploits', 'so', 'callously', 'Benjamin', 'vulnerability', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'graduation', 'college', 'film', 'title', 'ironic', 'even', 'diploma', 'hand', 'Benjamin', 'must', 'complete', 'other', 'rites', 'passage', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'decent', 'uncorrupted', 'young', 'woman', 'loves', 'film', 'Elaine', 'sit', 'together', 'back', 'public', 'bus', 'staring', 'ahead', 'apparent', 'emotion', 'future', 'assuredly', 'uncertain', 'Once', 'again', 'Benjamin', 'must', 'address', 'question', 'posed', 'earlier', 'Now', 'what', 'cultural', 'anthropologists', 'comment', 'film', 'sociological', 'significance', 'indicated', 'previously', 'think', 'so', 'highly', 'film', 'Nichols', 'brilliantly', 'combined', 'integrated', 'just', 'everything', 'great', 'film', 'compelling', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'memorable', 'appropriate', 'music', 'effective', 'use', 'humor', 'Many', 'people', 'believe', 'film', 'window', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'America', '1960s', 'Probably', 'think', 'will', 'also', 'continue', 'be', 'appreciated', 'certain', 'themes', 'have', 'defined', 'human', 'experience', 'several', 'thousand', 'years', 'struggle', 'wisdom', 'sometimes', 'necessary', 'loss', 'innocence', 'transcending', 'power', 'human', 'heart']",The Graduate

Poor Ben Braddock-spoiled to death, doted on, fresh out of college...and has no idea what to do next. In his inertia he stumbles into a sex affair with the neighbors wife who is twice his elder. This gets dicey when he falls for her daughter, and the jealous mother makes him ruin his budding romance with her. What is at first a racy romp of a movie turns shrill at the end, when the movie takes its focus off Ben and Mrs. Robinson's dalliance and focuses more on a hero's quest for the heart of the woman he loves, with much screaming and nastiness abounding...the cool Mrs. Robinson becomes a shrew, which was unfortunate. Saying anymore would spoil the ending.Overall, this was a great movie, one Ive been putting off to see and am glad I finally broke down and watched.

Benjamin is in love with Mrs. Robinson's fresh, wide-eyed daughter (Katherine Ross), and the mother is turned into a vindictive witch.  (and the comedy turns into melodrama).

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[4, 4]","Mike Nichols' THE GRADUATE (1967), brilliantly written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, is a timeless film masterpiece that speaks profoundly to me.  In 1967 I was in the middle of high school and 16 years old.  In only two years, I would face Viet Nam or the working world or college.  And if I chose college, where would it be and what would my major be?  I was a confused and depressed virgin with no real girlfriend.Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, who is seduced (actually mindf---ed by a chain-smoking middle-aged friend named Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft at her best).  But Benjamin is really in love with Mrs. Robinson's college student daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).  All three actors got Oscar nominations, the script was also nominated, and Nichols won Best Director.  This is an amazing work of art that speaks to an entire generation, just as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955) spoke to an earlier generation.  That it was partly filmed at both UC Berkeley and USC, two of my college alma maters, is only another plus.What is amazing about THE GRADUATE is that it is totally free of things that might date it, like sex and drug love-ins, love beads, and hippies.  Watching it for the first time in fifteen years, on widescreen DVD, I was stunned by the performances, every perfect line of dialogue, and very stylish cinematography by Robert Surtees.  We are in a shallow upper class Southern California world, with the camera shooting underwater in a swimming pool, through aquariums, and in mirrored surfaces.  Surtees and Nichols constantly do interesting things with the Panavision canvas, like beautiful soft lighting and backgrounds in focus while foregrounds are fuzzy.  They love playing with darkness.The dazzling editing is by Sam O'Steen, who later worked with Polanski on CHINATOWN (1974).  He has fun with the big seduction scene and quick cutting, as well as the legendary cut from swimming pool mattress to Mrs. Robinson's bed.  Contrasts are always inspired.  Surtees, O'Steen, and Nichols are a dream team to match the dazzling performances.I am reviewing THE GRADUATE at 40 DVD, which includes two audio commentaries (one with Hoffman and Ross, the other with Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh); fellow directors and other industry figures talking about how influential the movie remains for them; Buck Henry talking about the screenplay and other items; Hoffman chatting about how he got the lead role in a movie conceived in terms of all blonde, blue-eyed WASPS like in the Charles Webb novel;  and the impossible-to-overstate importance of Simon and Garfunkel's incomparable song score.  (They get a separate CD here with complete versions of songs done piecemeal in the film.)For those who care, the movie is NOT in anamorphic widescreen, but looks great in regular 2.35 widescreen with beautiful color and matchless compositions.  THE GRADUATE at 40 is a wonderful addition to my DVD collection, possibly a favorite movie of all time in what it has to say about the 1960's and the formative years of everyone my age, and a definite must-see in this lovely new DVD edition from 20th Century Fox Home Video.",5,A timeless masterpiece that speaks to an entire generation,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,3154,"['Mike', 'Nichols', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', '1967', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'Calder', 'Willingham', 'timeless', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'profoundly', '1967', 'was', 'middle', 'high', 'school', '16', 'years', 'old', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'would', 'face', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'working', 'world', 'college', 'chose', 'college', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'would', 'major', 'be', 'was', 'confused', 'depressed', 'virgin', 'real', 'girlfriend.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'who', 'seduced', 'actually', 'mindf', '-ed', 'chain-smoking', 'middle-aged', 'friend', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'best', 'Benjamin', 'really', 'love', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'college', 'student', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'three', 'actors', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'script', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Nichols', 'won', 'Best', 'Director', 'amazing', 'work', 'art', 'entire', 'generation', 'just', 'REBEL', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'CAUSE', '1955', 'spoke', 'earlier', 'generation', 'was', 'partly', 'filmed', 'UC', 'Berkeley', 'USC', 'two', 'college', 'alma', 'maters', 'only', 'plus.What', 'amazing', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', 'totally', 'free', 'things', 'might', 'date', 'sex', 'drug', 'love-ins', 'love', 'beads', 'hippies', 'Watching', 'first', 'time', 'fifteen', 'years', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'was', 'stunned', 'performances', 'perfect', 'line', 'dialogue', 'very', 'stylish', 'cinematography', 'Robert', 'Surtees', 'are', 'shallow', 'upper', 'class', 'Southern', 'California', 'world', 'camera', 'shooting', 'underwater', 'swimming', 'pool', 'aquariums', 'mirrored', 'surfaces', 'Surtees', 'Nichols', 'constantly', 'do', 'interesting', 'things', 'Panavision', 'canvas', 'beautiful', 'soft', 'lighting', 'backgrounds', 'focus', 'foregrounds', 'are', 'fuzzy', 'love', 'playing', 'darkness.The', 'dazzling', 'editing', 'Sam', ""O'Steen"", 'who', 'later', 'worked', 'Polanski', 'CHINATOWN', '1974', 'fun', 'big', 'seduction', 'scene', 'quick', 'cutting', 'as', 'well', 'legendary', 'cut', 'swimming', 'pool', 'mattress', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'bed', 'Contrasts', 'are', 'always', 'inspired', 'Surtees', ""O'Steen"", 'Nichols', 'are', 'dream', 'team', 'match', 'dazzling', 'performances.I', 'am', 'reviewing', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', '40', 'DVD', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'one', 'Hoffman', 'Ross', 'other', 'Nichols', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'fellow', 'directors', 'other', 'industry', 'figures', 'talking', 'how', 'influential', 'movie', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'talking', 'screenplay', 'other', 'items', 'Hoffman', 'chatting', 'how', 'got', 'lead', 'role', 'movie', 'conceived', 'terms', 'blonde', 'blue-eyed', 'WASPS', 'Charles', 'Webb', 'novel', 'impossible-to-overstate', 'importance', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'incomparable', 'song', 'score', 'get', 'separate', 'CD', 'here', 'complete', 'versions', 'songs', 'done', 'piecemeal', 'film', 'who', 'care', 'movie', 'NOT', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'great', 'regular', '2.35', 'widescreen', 'beautiful', 'color', 'matchless', 'compositions', 'GRADUATE', '40', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'what', 'say', '1960', 'formative', 'years', 'everyone', 'age', 'definite', 'must-see', 'lovely', 'new', 'DVD', 'edition', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Home', 'Video']",The Graduate
444851,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,6305034397,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[25, 28]","The previous reviews posted here are all based on what the reviewers HOPED would be on the new 40th Anniversary and raised some questions. I can answer most of the concerns having watched the DVD this week.As for how important this film is, let's just say it defined a generation in the 1970s. And nearly anyone in either high school or college (or a recent ""graduate"" entering the working world) when the film was released can quote verbatim important lines and whole scenes. Try ""Are you trying to seduce me Mrs. Robinson?"" or even the mention of one word """"Plastics!"". I have only watched the film (on VHS) once since my original viewing on the big screen forty years ago. Of course I remember many of the great moments (the finale at the church, for one) and the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack. (Dave Grusin wrote the incidental music.). I did not see the ""25th Anniversary"" reissue. So much of the supplemental material was new to me.First off the transfer is great! It must have been remastered. And yes, it's in Wide Screen. It HAS to be. The hardest video to pan and scan was always this film as Director Mike Nichols spaced his characters at the far sides of the screen. I watched this on an 25 year old 26 in TV and it was still perfect.Okay, now the bonus features. It's a 2 ""disc"" set because one disc is a CD of FOUR songs from the film. So it's really more of a CD single."", That's fine with me, but most of us have the music in our collection.There are TWO commentary tracks: One is Hoffman and Ross talking. Since Ross doesn't even appear in the film until almost half way through, she has little to say for a while. And there are long periods where Hoffman says nothing so you get to hear the soundtrack dialogue at that point. The second commentary is with Director Mike Nichols and Director Stephen Soderburgh. It more that SS is interviewing Nichols. And Nichols is very outgoing here. Where I found a small problem is that the conversation often does not match what is on the screen. During the ""Seduction"" scene I expected to hear details about the set up. But Nichols was talking about Screen Tests or something else. I have not made it all the way through the commentaries. Too much other good stuff here.There is a NEW 25-minute documentary: ""Students of the Graduate"" which has interviews with young directors who learned techniques from Nichols direction. The Directors of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" were ones I remember. It's interesting. There is a short 8-minute one on ""the Seduction"" as well. This appears to be new.The other featurettes are from the 25th Anniversary release. One is obvious as it's title is ""The Graduate at 25"". You can see from the excerpted scenes how poor the 25th Anniversary print was. And - what I found MOST interesting was a ""One on One"" featurette with Dustin Hoffman which runs 22 minutes. It was recorded for the 25th - similar comments appear in the ""Graduate at 25"" feature - but Hoffman tells GREAT stories and I was on the floor laughing!ONE of the tywo screen tests that Ross did - with Charles Grodin - is included in the ""at 25"" featurette but the announced ""two screen tests with introduction"" are not on the final DVD. NEITHER is the ""Coming of Age: The Making of the Graduate"" one.So there is lots to watch here and moments to remember. I, for one, loved this set and the special featurettes - which rarely, though sometimes, repeat themselves - briefing out things you missed and make you want to playback some scenes.This should be a hot release for September!Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,The Landmark Film - Done RIGHT!!!,1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,3561,"['previous', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'are', 'based', 'what', 'reviewers', 'HOPED', 'would', 'be', 'new', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'raised', 'questions', 'can', 'answer', 'most', 'concerns', 'having', 'watched', 'DVD', 'week.As', 'how', 'important', 'film', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'defined', 'generation', '1970s', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'recent', 'graduate', 'entering', 'working', 'world', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'can', 'quote', 'verbatim', 'important', 'lines', 'whole', 'scenes', 'Try', 'Are', 'trying', 'seduce', 'Mrs', 'Robinson', 'even', 'mention', 'one', 'word', 'Plastics', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'film', 'VHS', 'once', 'original', 'viewing', 'big', 'screen', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'course', 'remember', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'finale', 'church', 'one', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'soundtrack', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'wrote', 'incidental', 'music.', 'did', 'not', 'see', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'reissue', 'So', 'much', 'supplemental', 'material', 'was', 'new', 'me.First', 'off', 'transfer', 'great', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'yes', 'Wide', 'Screen', 'be', 'hardest', 'video', 'pan', 'scan', 'was', 'always', 'film', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'spaced', 'characters', 'far', 'sides', 'screen', 'watched', '25', 'year', 'old', '26', 'TV', 'was', 'still', 'perfect.Okay', 'now', 'bonus', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'one', 'disc', 'CD', 'FOUR', 'songs', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'CD', 'single', 'fine', 'most', 'have', 'music', 'are', 'TWO', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'One', 'Hoffman', 'Ross', 'talking', 'Ross', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'film', 'almost', 'way', 'little', 'say', 'while', 'are', 'long', 'periods', 'where', 'Hoffman', 'nothing', 'so', 'get', 'hear', 'soundtrack', 'dialogue', 'point', 'second', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Soderburgh', 'more', 'SS', 'interviewing', 'Nichols', 'Nichols', 'very', 'outgoing', 'here', 'Where', 'found', 'small', 'problem', 'conversation', 'often', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'screen', 'Seduction', 'scene', 'expected', 'hear', 'details', 'set', 'up', 'Nichols', 'was', 'talking', 'Screen', 'Tests', 'something', 'else', 'have', 'not', 'made', 'way', 'commentaries', 'Too', 'much', 'other', 'good', 'stuff', 'NEW', '25-minute', 'documentary', 'Students', 'Graduate', 'interviews', 'young', 'directors', 'who', 'learned', 'techniques', 'Nichols', 'direction', 'Directors', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'were', 'ones', 'remember', 'interesting', 'short', '8-minute', 'one', 'Seduction', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'new.The', 'other', 'featurettes', 'are', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'release', 'One', 'obvious', 'title', 'Graduate', '25', 'can', 'see', 'excerpted', 'scenes', 'how', 'poor', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'print', 'was', 'what', 'found', 'MOST', 'interesting', 'was', 'One', 'One', 'featurette', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', '22', 'minutes', 'was', 'recorded', '25th', 'similar', 'comments', 'appear', 'Graduate', '25', 'feature', 'Hoffman', 'GREAT', 'stories', 'was', 'floor', 'laughing', 'ONE', 'tywo', 'screen', 'tests', 'Ross', 'did', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'included', '25', 'featurette', 'announced', 'two', 'screen', 'tests', 'introduction', 'are', 'not', 'final', 'DVD', 'NEITHER', 'Coming', 'Age', 'Making', 'Graduate', 'one.So', 'lots', 'watch', 'here', 'moments', 'remember', 'one', 'loved', 'set', 'special', 'featurettes', 'rarely', 'sometimes', 'repeat', 'briefing', 'out', 'things', 'missed', 'make', 'want', 'playback', 'scenes.This', 'should', 'be', 'hot', 'release', 'September', 'Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Graduate
444852,A3M0YP958H2KRX,6305034397,Steven K. Szmutko,"[3, 4]","A defining movie of the 1960's, THE GRADUATE remains a unique movie that stands up extremely well today.  Mike Nichols displays his extraordinary talent for extracting terrific performances from his talented cast as well as providing a unique cinematic experience.  The use of unusual camera shots to create mood and heighten emotion without special effects is a standard that today's film makers would do well to emulate.Dustin Hoffman gives an inspired performance as Benjamin Braddock - the confused disillusioned college graduate manipulated by parents, friends, and of course -- Mrs. Robinson.  His portrayal is subtle in so many respects.  Anne Bancroft is, of course, stellar as Mrs. Robinson, the original desperate housewife.  The full range of her acting abilities shines through in one of the key bedroom scenes where she seamlessly transitions from hard-edged middle-aged seductress to vulnerable wistful lover (Art?  Well, I guess you kind of lost interest....).Other fine performances (large and small) from a noted supporting cast include Katherine Ross, Murry Hamilton, William Daniels, Elizabeth Wilson and Buck Henry.  Look for up and coming actors such as Mike Farrell, Richard Dreyfuss and Ben Murphy.Simon and Garfunkel's sound track is appropriately dated, providing the quintessential 60's feel to the film.  Having both the full screen VHS and wide screen DVD, the latter is the only way to enjoy the movie.Just one more word.....""PLASTICS""",5,Hello Darkness My Old Friend,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,1464,"['defining', 'movie', '1960', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', 'unique', 'movie', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'today', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'extracting', 'terrific', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'use', 'unusual', 'camera', 'shots', 'create', 'mood', 'heighten', 'emotion', 'special', 'effects', 'standard', 'today', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'emulate.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'confused', 'disillusioned', 'college', 'graduate', 'manipulated', 'parents', 'friends', 'course', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'portrayal', 'subtle', 'so', 'many', 'respects', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'course', 'stellar', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'original', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'full', 'range', 'acting', 'abilities', 'shines', 'one', 'key', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'where', 'seamlessly', 'transitions', 'hard-edged', 'middle-aged', 'seductress', 'vulnerable', 'wistful', 'lover', 'Art', 'Well', 'guess', 'kind', 'lost', 'interest', '.Other', 'fine', 'performances', 'large', 'small', 'noted', 'supporting', 'cast', 'include', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'Murry', 'Hamilton', 'William', 'Daniels', 'Elizabeth', 'Wilson', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'Look', 'up', 'coming', 'actors', 'such', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Ben', 'Murphy.Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'sound', 'track', 'appropriately', 'dated', 'providing', 'quintessential', '60', 'feel', 'film', 'Having', 'full', 'screen', 'VHS', 'wide', 'screen', 'DVD', 'latter', 'only', 'way', 'enjoy', 'movie.Just', 'one', 'more', 'word', '..', 'PLASTICS']",The Graduate

Along comes Anne Bancroft as the much older wife of Hoffman's father's partner, who makes an attempt to seduce him, which he hastily refuses. After some reflection, however, he happily decides to proceed with the somewhat torrid affair. A problem arises when the wife's daughter arives in town and Hoffman may find himself in love.....The Graduate is a great blend of comic timing and drama. The sountrack by Simon and Garfunkle is arguably the best use of a soundtrack by any movie, with music that captures the boredom and repitition and torridness of the affair, and subsequent wild passion, seemingly much better than any dialouge could.

444865,A17JVVAKWEB0M,6305034397,Wesley Mullins,"[6, 8]","Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) returns home from what most would consider a triumphant college experience.  Head of the debating club, captain of track team, editor of the school paper and award-winning scholar, Ben creates envy in all his parents' friends, as none of them can imagine the angst and directionlessness that overwhelm him.  Ben perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the late 1960s; it is no coincidence that he comes along at a time when the youth of America were searching for answers and questioning the world of their elders.  The goals of his parents' social circle are not his goals.  Their dreams, not his.  Ben is not eager to make decisions that will map out the rest of his life, and is certainly not ready to jump into an exiting career in ""plastics"".He is also not ready to jump into an affair with Mrs. Robinson, wife of Ben's father's longtime partner.  But Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) has other plans.  In a comically uncomfortable wooing, the middle-aged temptress toys with young Ben, making obvious passes and then feigning shock when Ben responds to her advances.  Ben's confusion - heightened by an old-fashion respect for elders - culminates when he laughingly says, ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me,"" and with a puzzled look, then asks, ""Aren't you?""While the romance between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson occupies an unequaled spot in American popular culture, it only establishes the real conflict of the film (the turmoil that develops when Benjamin falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine).  The latter half of the film sees Ben find the direction he lacks in the lost, lazy days that originally guided him toward Mrs. Robinson.  He sees in her daughter the dreams and desires he so needs.  As his past trysts with the elder socialite come to haunt him, Benjamin finds himself trapped between his hopes for the future and the actions of his past.Watching ""The Graduate"" for the first time creates in a viewer a series of ""oh, that's where that came from"" moments, similar to reading ""Hamlet"" or watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Godfather"".  ""The Graduate"" forever altered the collective language and experience of our culture, and neophytes to the film will be shocked at how much of it they have already seen elsewhere (not just the content of the plot, but also the framing of shots, tricky editing, and the music of Simon & Garfunkel).",5,"One Word: Perfection (Not ""Plastics"")",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,2395,"['Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'home', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'triumphant', 'college', 'experience', 'Head', 'debating', 'club', 'captain', 'track', 'team', 'editor', 'school', 'paper', 'award-winning', 'scholar', 'Ben', 'envy', 'parents', 'friends', 'none', 'can', 'imagine', 'angst', 'directionlessness', 'overwhelm', 'Ben', 'perfectly', 'zeitgeist', 'late', '1960s', 'coincidence', 'along', 'time', 'when', 'youth', 'America', 'were', 'searching', 'answers', 'questioning', 'world', 'elders', 'goals', 'parents', 'social', 'circle', 'are', 'not', 'goals', 'dreams', 'not', 'Ben', 'not', 'eager', 'make', 'decisions', 'will', 'map', 'out', 'rest', 'life', 'certainly', 'not', 'ready', 'jump', 'exiting', 'career', 'plastics', '.He', 'also', 'not', 'ready', 'jump', 'affair', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'wife', 'Ben', 'father', 'longtime', 'partner', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'other', 'plans', 'comically', 'uncomfortable', 'wooing', 'middle-aged', 'temptress', 'toys', 'young', 'Ben', 'making', 'obvious', 'passes', 'then', 'feigning', 'shock', 'when', 'Ben', 'advances', 'Ben', 'confusion', 'heightened', 'old-fashion', 'respect', 'elders', 'culminates', 'when', 'laughingly', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', ""'re"", 'trying', 'seduce', 'puzzled', 'look', 'then', 'Are', ""n't"", 'romance', 'Benjamin', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'unequaled', 'spot', 'American', 'popular', 'culture', 'only', 'real', 'conflict', 'film', 'turmoil', 'when', 'Benjamin', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'Ben', 'find', 'direction', 'lost', 'lazy', 'days', 'originally', 'guided', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'daughter', 'dreams', 'desires', 'so', 'needs', 'past', 'trysts', 'elder', 'socialite', 'come', 'haunt', 'Benjamin', 'trapped', 'hopes', 'future', 'actions', 'past.Watching', 'Graduate', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'series', 'oh', 'where', 'came', 'moments', 'similar', 'reading', 'Hamlet', 'watching', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Godfather', 'Graduate', 'forever', 'altered', 'collective', 'language', 'experience', 'culture', 'neophytes', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'just', 'content', 'plot', 'also', 'framing', 'shots', 'tricky', 'editing', 'music', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel']",The Graduate

Let's face it, DVD's have really helped younger generations explore older titles, and in their original widescreen presentations too!The Graduate ia about a young man (Dustin Hoffman) who is reaching manhood.  He is unsure where he is going in life, and then life becomes very interesting for him when an older woman, Mrs Robinson, seduces him (Ann Bancroft). Mrs Robinson is a family friend with an attractive daughter (katherine Ross) whom Hoffman eventually goes after, much to the disapproval of Mrs Robinson.Blessed with a beautiful Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, this film is basically fun to watch from start to finish. Some reviewers have called it ""dated"", but that's actually what makes it so special.  There are some great lines in the film, and some of them were used in a George Michael song ""Too Funky"".The film has been restored beautifully for DVD.
