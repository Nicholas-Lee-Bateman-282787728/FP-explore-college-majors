1515828,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B006IVNIS6,Amber MacDonald,"[0, 0]","This movie is a fantastic tale of life and how complicated it will always be. No matter what situation you find yourself in, there will always be some kind of obstacle to overcome.Amara Winter, finds this out. Her road to stardom wasn't exactly paved with turmoil, but with her life and very soul on the line, turmoil finds her. There is her mother, who is a very well respected figure in the religious community. She is openly unsupportive of Amara's decisions, music, and videos. Amara doesn't want her mother to hate what she is becoming, but realizes that she cannot allow that to keep her from realizing her dreams.To further complicate her situation, Amara's father tragically dies. She also must face down the troubles that are inherited with stardom and assuming the role of a celebrity. No one could prepare her for the decisions she would be faced with, despite the fact that she had already weathered so much.This movie is a good example of life and the toll it takes in exchange for what it gives. It is also a testament that not every celebrity leads the glamorous life that most of the rest of us think they do. It is a good film for people of any age, race, or background.",4,MAMA I Want To Sing DVD,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1187,"['movie', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'life', 'how', 'complicated', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'matter', 'what', 'situation', 'find', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'kind', 'obstacle', 'overcome.Amara', 'Winter', 'out', 'road', 'stardom', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'paved', 'turmoil', 'life', 'very', 'soul', 'line', 'turmoil', 'mother', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'respected', 'figure', 'religious', 'community', 'openly', 'unsupportive', 'Amara', 'decisions', 'music', 'videos', 'Amara', ""n't"", 'want', 'mother', 'hate', 'what', 'becoming', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'keep', 'realizing', 'dreams.To', 'further', 'complicate', 'situation', 'Amara', 'father', 'tragically', 'also', 'must', 'face', 'down', 'troubles', 'are', 'inherited', 'stardom', 'assuming', 'role', 'celebrity', 'one', 'could', 'prepare', 'decisions', 'would', 'be', 'faced', 'fact', 'had', 'already', 'weathered', 'so', 'much.This', 'movie', 'good', 'example', 'life', 'toll', 'exchange', 'what', 'also', 'testament', 'not', 'celebrity', 'glamorous', 'life', 'most', 'rest', 'think', 'do', 'good', 'film', 'people', 'age', 'race', 'background']",Mama I Want to Sing

It kind of had a feel of a classic movie - even though it wasn't in black and white - and I love to watch classic movies. I also enjoyed listening to Reverend Winter (Marvin Winans)singing right from the start.Amara (Ciara): She's young Doris (Mariah Roberson) when the movie begins and she's using her beautiful singing voice for the Lord. Seven years later, she's singing in the club and then she gets a manager and rises to pop stardom. She remembered the words her father spoke to her when he was alive, but she took them out of context, the way some Christians misinterpret Scripture. But whatever choices she made when she stopped singing for Jesus, it was obvious she didn't stop caring about Him. Still, the question she asked her mother at the dining room table, she should have asked herself.Doris' brother, Luke (Kevin Phillips): A gifted photographer and my favorite character. His dreams of becoming a photo journalist took him to a dangerous place.Doris' mother, Lillian (Lynn Whitfield): Did she want to build a mega ministry for Jesus or gain recognition for herself? She was not happy with the woman her daughter had become, but she couldn't see the woman she had become.Horace Payne (Ben Vereen): I liked his words of wisdom and he was witty.Amara's Manager (Billy Zane): An irritating man.Revelation Network: Were they looking to expand to reach the lost or for financial gain?There was a scene with Lillian and Smokey Norful (as himself) that showed how `unreal' television ministry can be at times, but it did make me laugh. And the scene where Luke was talking to Horace was touching.I watch a movie more for the storytelling, and I pay close attention to the words that are spoken. What grabbed me and made me nod in agreement and say, Amen:1. The higher up the ladder you go, the more difficult the tests become.2. This is not about business. This is about right and wrong.3. Inside every person there is a gift, a calling. And that gift and calling is a direct link between you and God. God placed it there. But it is our responsibility, our duty, to discover, uncover and then recover that gift.""I never saw the play, but there was much said in this movie to give the audience something to think about.

When the father fell in the scene, you had no scene to support whether he lived or died. just that he wasn't in the picture. The brother who worked for both mother and daughter, but wanted to move on, it was like he was their puppet until he decided to move on. I had no love for Billy Zane's character, although most of the folks he portray are villians anyhow. the one part I could feel is when the lady who originally started this, Ms Vy Hygginsen came on and really talked to Lynn Whitfield's character and truly tried to level with her. She had a small part but was so significant in what she said. I feel the movie has a story that was to come out but somehow in the movie version, it didn't turn out that way.",3,had potential but fell short,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,948,"['have', 'looked', 'forward', 'watching', 'film', 'i', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'play', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'came', 'screen', 'bought', 'dvd', 'just', 'took', 'time', 'watch', 'tonight', 'thing', 'movie', 'When', 'father', 'fell', 'scene', 'had', 'scene', 'support', 'lived', 'died', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'picture', 'brother', 'who', 'worked', 'mother', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'move', 'was', 'was', 'puppet', 'decided', 'move', 'had', 'love', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'character', 'most', 'folks', 'portray', 'are', 'anyhow', 'one', 'part', 'could', 'feel', 'when', 'lady', 'who', 'originally', 'started', 'Ms', 'Vy', 'Hygginsen', 'came', 'really', 'talked', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'character', 'truly', 'tried', 'level', 'had', 'small', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'significant', 'what', 'said', 'feel', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'come', 'out', 'somehow', 'movie', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way']",Mama I Want to Sing

The starring role performed by Ciara is shallow & weak while the role of the mother played by Lynn Whitfiekd is brillant, as expected.  Ms. Whitfield is a force to be reckoned with.  It would take a stronger presence to outshine Ms. Whitfield and unfortunately Ciara was not it.  The story is well prsented on a whole but without the strong vocal performance shown in the play my preference is on the stage version versus the movie .",3,Mama She Wants to Sing,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,508,"['Having', 'sen', 'stage', 'version', 'foiund', 'version', 'lacking', 'comparison', 'starring', 'role', 'performed', 'Ciara', 'shallow', 'weak', 'role', 'mother', 'played', 'Lynn', 'Whitfiekd', 'brillant', 'expected', 'Ms.', 'Whitfield', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'would', 'take', 'stronger', 'presence', 'outshine', 'Ms.', 'Whitfield', 'unfortunately', 'Ciara', 'was', 'not', 'story', 'well', 'prsented', 'whole', 'strong', 'vocal', 'performance', 'shown', 'play', 'preference', 'stage', 'version', 'movie']",Mama I Want to Sing
