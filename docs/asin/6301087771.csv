I think this particular tape may only have the pilot but the tape we have also has an episode called A Happy Life and is about Catherine dealing with the anniversary of her mother's death. Both are great episodes but my favorite is the pilot episode! Linda Hamilton from the Terminator movies plays Catherine and Vincent is played by Ron Perlman. I highly recommend this video to fans of Beauty and the Beast.",5,Wonderful!,1011225600,"01 17, 2002",2002,694,"['great', 'tape', 'first', 'pilot', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'City', 'New', 'York', 'wonderful', 'how', 'Catherine', 'Chandler', 'attacked', 'Vincent', 'underground', 'home', 'recover', 'soon', 'bond', 'develops', 'soul', 'mate', 'kind', 'love', 'think', 'particular', 'tape', 'may', 'only', 'have', 'pilot', 'tape', 'have', 'also', 'episode', 'called', 'A', 'Happy', 'Life', 'about', 'Catherine', 'dealing', 'anniversary', 'mother', 'death', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Terminator', 'movies', 'Catherine', 'Vincent', 'played', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'fans', 'Beauty', 'Beast']",N/A

Which, of course, it did with flying colors and then some.Why has this not made it to DVD yet?

He said there was a show on TV with people dressed up rather old-fashioned, who played chess, lived in underground caves, and read the classics.  He knew this show would interest me, and he was right!  My parents and I watched every single episode, and all the reruns and absolutely loved the gentle messages and lessons each episode taught, the great cast, the originality of the series, the music, the heartbreak.  This is one of the best series I have come across; other favourites of mine include Little House, Avonlea, Dr. Quinn, Alias, Joan of Arcadia.
