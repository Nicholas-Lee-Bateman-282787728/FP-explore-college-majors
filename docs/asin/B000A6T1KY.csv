I'm looking forward to the episode where a news crew shows to do a story on Bill which he thinks is going to be a tribute, but which is really an expose of how bad it is to work with him.  He keeps rehearsing how he majestically wants himself shown- then finally gets so tired of waiting for his time on camera, he imagines himself telling the woman interviewer off and her forcing herself on him.

From reading the negative reviews, it's obvious that the humor is not for everyone.  It's probably not an acquired taste--you either chuckle, or you don't.  Do NOT expect jokes or typical joke rhythms (set up, punch line; set up, punch line).  It's situational, and wry, and off-beat.  Like jazz, the joy is in the unexpected riffs and silences.  The acting is top-notch, of course, and the mixture of poignancy and fun is justly famous.  The character of Bill is just too abrasive for some people, I know.

Lewis ""the lantern""","[2, 2]","I watched this occasionally while home from college back in the 1980's, and very much enjoyed the eccentric, yet somehow oddly encouraging, humor, concerning a small city (Buffalo, N.Y.), it's famous talk show (""The Buffalo Bill Show""), and of course the head of it, Bill Bittinger, played (exceptionally well) by Dabney Coleman.  Buffalo Bill thought that he was not only the head of the show, but pretty much Buffalo itself; and the man was almost insufferable in his selfishness and mendacity.  But we all loved him.  Not sure why, but perhaps because he reminded us of ourselfes.The 'show' was on tv for only about one year, before it was unfortunately cancelled.  A show ahead of its time, perhaps, in the advanced nature of its humor, being that to some degree it was self-referential.  The plots in each episode are really not so important as are the characters themselves:  the leader, Bill; the shy, retiring, executive producer (played by Max Wright); the intelligent lady manager (Joanna Cassidy); and in an early role, information manager, and consultant to the head, a young lady played by Geena Davis!I have read a review here which complained of a 2 or 3 minute section being taken out of the series: and while this is true (because of copyright laws concerning a song), I would recommend not being too concerned with this... I actually never saw the missing segment, but I would say that sure it was no doubt a nice bit, but it was just 3 minutes or so out of a whole series!
