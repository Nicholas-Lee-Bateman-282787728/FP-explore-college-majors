The downside to reading and viewing so many history programs is that, after a while, you start to wander into the territory of historical revisionism - that futile, flawed political ideology that exists solely to distort some of the true details in order to spare some political group's collective self-esteem.  I haven't read as much on the five subjects given exploration here in THE MEN WHO BUILT AMERICA so I couldn't say how accurate the portrayals were; I can say that there were a handful of tidbits that I think were tinkered with just a bit.  I'm not so sure that was done in any attempt to revise history as it was to tighten up the narrative structure of this miniseries.  Still, the main thrust of the production - that America wasn't so much discovered as it was built - comes center stage ... the good, the bad, and the ugly of it.And I found most of it fascinating.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Vanderbilt.  Rockefeller.  Carnegie.  Morgan.  Ford.Those are five names - five important names - of men who not only built their fortunes on the American Dream but also helped build America, giving the still-fledgling nation a purpose to exist in the world.  Their collective efforts ushered our entire planet into the Industrial Revolution, and, as their activities overlapped with one another's in so many ways, why not capitalize one exploration of capitalism by featuring them in a well-produced, highly-publicized historical mini-series?The History Channel has gotten a bad `rap' as of late for investing in some curious products - say Ancient Aliens, which I happen to love but that's another story - by so much of the mainstream media establishment, and that's quite probably what fueled their interests in airing something that might appeal to the critical backbone of a nation.  THE MEN WHO BUILT AMERICA is an impressive exploration of American history post-Civil War - a time when pioneers awoke the industrial might of a nation in order to bring the States back together in such a way no one at the time imagined possible.  Granted - as is the problem with almost any production these days - there's a natural tendency to play fast and loose with some facts in order to meet the demands of today's short-attention-span crowd, and MEN delves into some of the more sensationalist aspects of these lives a bit too often.  It's a fault easy to forgive because the rest of the package works to maintain viewer interest and maybe - just maybe - inspire its audience to actually pick up some books and actually read up on the histories of these men and these times in order to get to know them better and more fully than what's presented in an eight episode miniseries.How well does it work?  I thought it very effective, though I'll admit that Vanderbilt and Ford are kinda/sorta given the short stick here, not getting nearly as much coverage out of the eight-episodes that Rockefeller, Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan get.  Also, there's more than a healthy use (and re-use) of stock or secondary footage that grows a bit distracting as the mini pushes on.  Also - as this was clearly constructed for episodic television treatment - there's more than needed recapping done; in fact, one might question why the editors chose to provide a recap after every fifteen minute segment aired.  Have our attention spans grown really that short?  The History Channel must think so.  Thankfully, I kept my remote handy and began eliminating (fast-forwarding) these segments as I watched this on DVD.THE MEN WHO BUILT AMERICA is produced by Stephen David Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate for The History Channel.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds exceptional; no expense appears to have spared in bringing this mini to life.  In fact, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the production was nominated for a VES Award for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Broadcast Program.  As is often the case, this one is a bit short of special features - there are only a handful of excised and/or re-edited sequences that appear sprinkled throughout the three discs.  I didn't feel nothing was essentially added to the production by having them here, but it is what it is.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  As I said in my opening, I don't know how well THE MEN WHO BUILT AMERICA would score in total accuracy of the facts, but, so far as the narrative, it works brilliantly, presenting one industrial titan and then showing how he overlapped with the next, and so on and so forth.  The lion's share of the story revolves around Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan; Vanderbilt is given what feels like `summary treatment,' and Ford feels almost like an afterthought, being relegated to a small portion of the final episode.  Still, it's a compelling portrait of the times that shaped these men as well as how these men shaped those times; the only way to perhaps fully flesh these gentlemen out to greater depth would be to now give each of them a stand-alone eight-part mini ... which, for the record, I'd definitely watch, in case you're listening, History Channel.In the interest of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE MEN WHO BUILT AMERICA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,THE MEN WHO BUILT AMERICA Is History

Strongbow Red Cloud ""Serene Warrior""","[25, 49]","First;  the introductory singer and his musical backers...if you can call it that, shows why we have sunk to the lowest common denominator, and why today's children, and their posterity will never be interested in American history.  The introduction blasts your ear with a bizarre sounding noisey menage of guitars and a voice that belongs in the gutter somewhere, no offense intended to the person who sung for this drip! This poorly made ""historical"" movie is long on re created shots, short on facts, sequences, woefully bad in regard to period clothing, how these men looked in their youth, terribly bad in regard to the dialogue between them, and lousy interviews laced in the cut- aways.  SECOND:  Mark Cuban, pardon me, has about as much respect for history as Attila the Hun, meaning none.  His diatribe contributes nothing to the enlightenment of the viewer, except to to give his funky smurky shrugging comments that suggest his overt abject  indifference to any dialogue that speaks to history on a serious level.  Cuban is the latter-day jackal with no regard nor respect for the republic on which he stands.  His comments are inauspicious to say the least.  Charles Schwab is reduced to a screen appearance more out of mention of an ancestor, than for any historical facts he can offer.  His dressed-down appearance speaks volumes of how far he too has gone to placate the gangsta-funkers who insist that everybody who does one of these ""modern day"" videos, speak on camera dressed in hideous black, pajamas, jeans,cut away tee shirts, and never look at the camera directly.  Schwab was once an impeccable dresser who spoke volumes to honesty and still does.  The end of formal dress wear in exchange for pajamas, nappy hair dos, funky tee shirts, and ""anything goes including the F -bomb"" is the undoing of this once-great Nation that feeds today's generation of smart phone gangstas the notion that even history can be told in short cuts.For analysis: John D. Rockefeller and Carnegie were far more friendly in real life, especially in their middle age years, than this video suggests.  The video points incorrectly to the twi-light years of the barons as the time they ""came together"" by mutual interests.  Not so.  JP Morgan was an obsessed grubber who was particularly sensitive to his bulbous nose appearance, and shied away from public because of his self proclaimed grotesqueness, but this is not touched upon anywhere, and this alone created an isolated-destructive monster that was this fellow during his formative years.  While ti can not be argued that these men owned America, they also got assistance from the elites who made up the ""permanent government"" of that era, Elihu Root, Robert T. Lincoln,  My advice to you the reader of this critique? Skip this drip DVD set,  and save your money.  Men Who Made America is a bust! Big time!  Probably was scraped together to make loot for the looters of this poorly made drivel.  Don't buy it, you will lament it after you view this flop which is a gross waste of your time.If this is the best that History Channel can do?  It needs to be called the Inept Channel.

1605366,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00A2XTHYU,Joker,"[30, 35]","I caught this program on the History Channel two nights ago.  It's one of the better documentaries I've seen on the History Channel.  It really held my attention.  Of course, it helps that I've always been interested in this time period in American History - the Gilded Age, the Age of Enterprise, the progressive era, etc.This documentary does in depth about the great business titans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The label of ""robber baron"" has been attached to the great business titans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a label that basically means ""ruthless businessman"" and ""filthy rich"".  Indeed, the reality was that during their heyday, before anti-trust laws, before Theodore Roosevelt became an unexpected and trust-busting president, these business titans were in fact ruthless and competitive businessmen trying to gain as much power and wealth as possible while monopolizing entire industries.  When the anti-big business William Jennings Bryan ran for president in 1896, these titans felt so threatened that they did the unprecedented by putting down their gloves and teaming up together to try to get William McKinley elected president for the simple fact that McKinley was pro-big business while Bryan was not.  The strategy worked, as these titans contributed millions of dollars to the McKinley campaign.  By 1900, Theodore Roosevelt, a young rising star in politics, held anti-trust views that made these titans nervous, so they set out to derail Roosevelt's momentum and agenda by trying to get him on the McKinley ticket in the 1900 presidential election so he could be a powerless Vice President under President William McKinley.  Once again, the strategy worked, but McKinley's assassination in 1901 made Roosevelt an unexpected - and feared - President of the United States who was out to break the trusts.  Understandably, this documentary exposes the cold truth, the ruthlessness of these men during the time when the absence of anti-trust laws allowed them to get away with monopolizing industries and having ruthless business practices, as well as the anti-trust climate of the 1890s and 1900s.  The documentary depicts reality and events in chronological order.  When Roosevelt became president, it was the beginning of the end of the long party the great business titans were enjoying for decades.  Mention is even made about the progressive movement as well.  Of course, the passage of time and revisionism beginning in the 1930s and 1940s has helped portray these men more as ""industrial statesmen"", men who helped build the nation and whose industries helped America win wars via use of oil, steel, electricity, etc., not to mention the philanthropy of these men.  So the old debate still rages - were these men ""robber barons"" or ""industrial statesmen""?This documentary features Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, and Henry Ford.  In addition, Jay Gould, George Westinghouse, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and others are featured.  Carnegie, Morgan, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, and Gould all have been labeled ""robber barons"" many times throughout history.  Ford, on the other hand, was viewed in a more favorable light due to the fact that he was producing a product that he wanted the common man to be able to afford.  However, despite whatever label, good or bad, has been attached to these men, they all had one thing in common that's indisputable - they helped build America into a superpower.  The documentary also features interviews with current and former CEOs and founders of American corporations and businesses, such as Donald Trump, Donny Deutsch, Steve Case, Mark Cuban, and that Jack Welch guy from General Electric.  The series is narrated by Campbell Scott and I thought he did a good job except for a mispronunciation or two.  The cinematography was very good.They spelled Grosse Pointe, Michigan wrong.I didn't like that a full recap was done after every commercial break about what we had seen up until that point.  It happened after every commercial break and was extremely repetitious and time consuming.  I didn't care for the music by Blues Saraceno.  It didn't ""fit"" at all.Some of the shady things these business titans were up to during their heyday has been emulated by the corporate elitists of today.  Just think of what happens with presidential elections of the current day.Overall, though, this is a great documentary that I rate at 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5.  I highly recommend watching it.",5,Well done documentary,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,4543,"['caught', 'program', 'History', 'Channel', 'two', 'nights', 'ago', 'one', 'better', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'History', 'Channel', 'really', 'held', 'attention', 'course', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'time', 'period', 'American', 'History', 'Gilded', 'Age', 'Age', 'Enterprise', 'progressive', 'era', 'etc.This', 'documentary', 'depth', 'great', 'business', 'titans', 'late', 'nineteenth', 'early', 'twentieth', 'centuries', 'label', 'robber', 'baron', 'been', 'attached', 'great', 'business', 'titans', 'late', 'nineteenth', 'early', 'twentieth', 'centuries', 'label', 'basically', 'ruthless', 'businessman', 'filthy', 'rich', 'Indeed', 'reality', 'was', 'heyday', 'anti-trust', 'laws', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'became', 'unexpected', 'trust-busting', 'president', 'business', 'titans', 'were', 'fact', 'ruthless', 'competitive', 'businessmen', 'trying', 'gain', 'as', 'much', 'power', 'wealth', 'possible', 'monopolizing', 'entire', 'industries', 'When', 'anti-big', 'business', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryan', 'ran', 'president', '1896', 'titans', 'felt', 'so', 'threatened', 'did', 'unprecedented', 'putting', 'down', 'gloves', 'teaming', 'up', 'together', 'try', 'get', 'William', 'McKinley', 'elected', 'president', 'simple', 'fact', 'McKinley', 'was', 'pro-big', 'business', 'Bryan', 'was', 'not', 'strategy', 'worked', 'titans', 'contributed', 'millions', 'dollars', 'McKinley', 'campaign', '1900', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'young', 'rising', 'star', 'politics', 'held', 'anti-trust', 'views', 'made', 'titans', 'nervous', 'set', 'out', 'derail', 'Roosevelt', 'momentum', 'agenda', 'trying', 'get', 'McKinley', 'ticket', '1900', 'presidential', 'election', 'could', 'be', 'powerless', 'Vice', 'President', 'President', 'William', 'McKinley', 'Once', 'again', 'strategy', 'worked', 'McKinley', 'assassination', '1901', 'made', 'Roosevelt', 'unexpected', 'feared', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'who', 'was', 'out', 'break', 'trusts', 'Understandably', 'documentary', 'cold', 'truth', 'ruthlessness', 'men', 'time', 'when', 'absence', 'anti-trust', 'laws', 'allowed', 'get', 'away', 'monopolizing', 'industries', 'having', 'ruthless', 'business', 'practices', 'as', 'well', 'anti-trust', 'climate', '1890s', '1900s', 'documentary', 'depicts', 'reality', 'events', 'chronological', 'order', 'When', 'Roosevelt', 'became', 'president', 'was', 'beginning', 'end', 'long', 'party', 'great', 'business', 'titans', 'were', 'enjoying', 'decades', 'Mention', 'even', 'made', 'progressive', 'movement', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'passage', 'time', 'revisionism', 'beginning', '1930s', '1940s', 'helped', 'portray', 'men', 'more', 'industrial', 'statesmen', 'men', 'who', 'helped', 'build', 'nation', 'industries', 'helped', 'America', 'win', 'wars', 'use', 'oil', 'steel', 'electricity', 'etc.', 'not', 'mention', 'philanthropy', 'men', 'old', 'debate', 'still', 'were', 'men', 'robber', 'barons', 'industrial', 'statesmen', 'documentary', 'features', 'Cornelius', 'Vanderbilt', 'John', 'D.', 'Rockefeller', 'J.P.', 'Morgan', 'Andrew', 'Carnegie', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'addition', 'Jay', 'Gould', 'George', 'Westinghouse', 'Thomas', 'Edison', 'Nikola', 'Tesla', 'others', 'are', 'featured', 'Carnegie', 'Morgan', 'Rockefeller', 'Vanderbilt', 'Gould', 'have', 'been', 'labeled', 'robber', 'barons', 'many', 'times', 'history', 'Ford', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'viewed', 'more', 'favorable', 'light', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'producing', 'product', 'wanted', 'common', 'man', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'However', 'label', 'good', 'bad', 'been', 'attached', 'men', 'had', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'indisputable', 'helped', 'build', 'America', 'superpower', 'documentary', 'also', 'interviews', 'current', 'former', 'CEOs', 'founders', 'American', 'corporations', 'businesses', 'such', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'Donny', 'Deutsch', 'Steve', 'Case', 'Mark', 'Cuban', 'Jack', 'Welch', 'guy', 'General', 'Electric', 'series', 'narrated', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'mispronunciation', 'two', 'cinematography', 'was', 'very', 'good.They', 'spelled', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Michigan', 'wrong.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'full', 'recap', 'was', 'done', 'commercial', 'break', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'up', 'point', 'happened', 'commercial', 'break', 'was', 'extremely', 'repetitious', 'time', 'consuming', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'music', 'Blues', 'Saraceno', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'all.Some', 'shady', 'things', 'business', 'titans', 'were', 'up', 'heyday', 'been', 'emulated', 'corporate', 'elitists', 'today', 'Just', 'think', 'what', 'presidential', 'elections', 'current', 'day.Overall', 'though', 'great', 'documentary', 'rate', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '5', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching']",N/A

1605382,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B00A2XTHYU,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[1, 1]","Cornelius Vanderbilt began by buying a ferry with a $100 loan, and then grew it into the largest private fleet in the world. He then sold all his ships and invested in railroads prior to the Civil War - sensing that railroads would revolutionize travel and transportation in the U.S. Ruthless tactics helped him acquire competitors - eg. he owned the only railroad bridge entering New York City, closed it to competitors, and then bought them out as they suffered. Vanderbilt also built Grand Central Depot, and owned 40% of U.S. railroads. He was victimized, however, trying to buy the Erie Railroad, the only line from NYC to Chicago, the latter then the fastest growing city. Gould and Fisk were mid-level managers at the Erie and took advantage of fine print that allowed selling new stock - the more Vanderbilt bought, the more they printed. Looking for a new play, Vanderbilt sensed that railroads were overbuilt and decided to corner the market on a new likely major source of railroad traffic - kerosene. Vanderbilt met with Rockefeller, then struggling - rather than roll over, however, Rockefeller promised to fill 60 train cars/day(despite a need for less than half that) for a 1/3 rate discount. Vanderbilt had to accept, under threat of Rockefeller going elsewhere.Rockefeller, age 24, focused on refining because he saw drilling as gambling. He raised more money to buy up competitors and generated more volume than Vanderbilt could handle. By age 33 he had 90% of the refining market. Vanderbilt then joined forces with a major competitor to raise rates for Rockefeller, who in turn built 4,000 miles of pipeline. One-third of railroads went bankrupt, but Vanderbilt still thought he had a strong hand by controlling the only railroad between Pittsburgh and N.Y.C., a route with no pipeline and a Rockefeller refinery in Pittsburgh. Rockefeller countered by shutting down his Pittsburgh refinery, bankrupting that railroad.Andrew Carnegie had risen from messenger boy at the railroad to top management when he was tasked with building a railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis. Designers told him he'd have to use a series of short arches because iron wasn't strong enough for a long span. Carnegie realized this would block river traffic and wouldn't be acceptable - exploring alternatives he learned first of steel (then produced for only small items such as knives) and then the Bessemer process that reduced the time to make steel rail from two weeks to 15 minutes. Carnegie invested all he had and built such a plant and completed the bridge in 1873. The public, however, was not convinced the bridge was strong enough - taking advantage of a common belief that an elephant wouldn't cross an unsafe structure, Carnegie arranged for a parade to cross the bridge, led by an elephant. Soon his initial steel plant was unable to fill orders as builders saw steel as offering improved buildings - after bringing in more investors, Carnegie expanded. Then brought in Henry Frick, a coal mine operator with a ruthless reputation, to assure adequate supplies of coke and to cut costs, which he did.Frick also helped found an exclusive club above Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Frick ignored pleas to strength what was then the world's largest earthen dam, and in fact weakened it by lowering the top to widen the path for carriages. The club owned the dam, but was never successfully held liable. Carnegie donated millions to help rebuild Johnstown, as well as building libraries across the U.S. and Carnegie Hall in NYC.Carnegie continued to push to become more profitable, upgrading the Homestead Steel Works near Pittsburgh in 1892. Frick did the dirty work while Carnegie went to Scotland and played golf. Wages were reduced, the work day extended to 12 hours for six days/week, and accidents began happening. A fatal accident led to 2,000 workers barricading themselves inside the plant; Frick called in Pinkerton (more men and guns than the military), nine workers were killed, and the state militia called in to restore order. The public was outraged, Carnegie returned from Scotland and undermined Frick - who then tried fomenting a board coup to oust Carnegie. Carnegie instead pushed Frick out.J.P. Morgan got his start by consolidating warring railroads, then became interested in Edison's light bulb. Morgan financed Edison's lighting part of Manhattan, envisioning being on the ground floor of a new industry. Instead, Westinghouse's AC system took the lead after the 1893 Chicago's World Fair. Westinghouse was unable to obtain additional financing due to the royalty agreement with Tesla; Tesla then tore it up and Westinghouse was back in the hunt. Morgan then threatened Westinghouse with an expensive (baseless) lawsuit over patent infringement, and Westinghouse capitulated, giving Morgan the patents. Morgan then pushed Edison out, converts the firm to AC, and renames it General Electric.Meanwhile Rockefeller's kerosene business is being seriously threatened by electricity, and hires scientists to find a use for its then useless gasoline by-product. They found it - powering motors.",5,Excellent -,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,5124,"['Cornelius', 'Vanderbilt', 'began', 'buying', 'ferry', '100', 'loan', 'then', 'grew', 'largest', 'private',

That is very useful, but it doesn't tell why America grew from a nearly broken country at the end of the Civil War to the most powerful country in the world.  It's also provides a pretty good history of economics; although there is no mention of supply and demand curves, or the theories of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, or John Maynard Keynes.  America wasn't built by the lone cowboy.  America is strong because it's economy is strong.  Freedoms preserved by our Founders in the Constitution, a country rich in raw but unused materials, and giants such as Vanderbilt, Morgan, Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Ford, who in their personal quests to build wealth helped create the wealthiest economy the world has ever seen.  I especially liked their depictions as young men, although several were poorly cast.  Most photos of them were as old men.

Another reviewer has pointed out oversimplifications that may distort the story, and it wouldn't surprise me.  However it's interesting how it dances around revealing some truths, like the extent to which European bankers and secret societies were involved.  For instance, during a strike in a steel mill, Frick writes to Carnegie for permission to deal with the strike.  Carnegie is ""vacationing"" in Scotland, which was running the British Empire.  He gives Frick permission to go at the strikers in his predictably brutal fashion, with circumlocutions and evasions.  But interestingly, in his last letter, he uses the ""royal 'we'"":  ""We have every confidence you will...""  He indicates that it is the will of the British Empire, but the narrators say nothing of pressure from Britain, or any secret society.  The theme is never mentioned, although it pops up again and again as an undercurrent.  Morgan tells his son he is handling a bond sale for England in London, and reminds the young man not to forget where their loyalties lie.It would be interesting to get more of the untold story of what foreign powers were influencing these Titans of American industry.",5,Not the Whole Story,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1194,"['well', 'done', 'series', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'oversimplifications', 'may', 'distort', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'However', 'interesting', 'how', 'around', 'revealing', 'truths', 'extent', 'European', 'bankers', 'secret', 'societies', 'were', 'involved', 'instance', 'strike', 'steel', 'mill', 'Frick', 'Carnegie', 'permission', 'deal', 'strike', 'Carnegie', 'vacationing', 'Scotland', 'was', 'running', 'British', 'Empire', 'Frick', 'permission', 'go', 'strikers', 'predictably', 'brutal', 'fashion', 'circumlocutions', 'evasions', 'interestingly', 'last', 'letter', 'royal', ""'we"", 'have', 'confidence', 'will', 'will', 'British', 'Empire', 'narrators', 'say', 'nothing', 'pressure', 'Britain', 'secret', 'society', 'theme', 'never', 'mentioned', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'undercurrent', 'Morgan', 'son', 'handling', 'bond', 'sale', 'England', 'London', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'forget', 'where', 'loyalties', 'lie.It', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'get', 'more', 'untold', 'story', 'what', 'foreign', 'powers', 'were', 'influencing', 'Titans', 'American', 'industry']",N/A
