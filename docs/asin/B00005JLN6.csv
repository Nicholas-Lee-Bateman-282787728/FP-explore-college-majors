602417,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLN6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[96, 97]","Absolute agreement that the premier episode of &quot;Monk&quot; is one of the more memorable television pilots of recent vintage, but only having one episode, even that one, is less than satisfactory.  Consequently, this DVD is not really for the devoted fan of the show but more for those who have missed out on the party from the first episode and need to get up the speed.  What you get is an introduction to Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), a former San Francisco homicide detective who left the force because he suffers from an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition that afflicted him after the murder of his wife.  However, when there is an assassination attempt on a mayoral candidate he is coaxed out of retirement by his former boss, Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine).The idea is that Monk is now a private consultant with an uncanny ability to pick up details missed by other detectives.  You can think of Monk as a really quirky Sherlock Holmes, with his full-time nurse Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) in the role of Watson.  However, she spends more of her time serving as a buffer between Monk and the real world.  The result is one of the rare delights on television from last season and the first television show to cross over from cable to networks.  By the time you get to the scene where Monk knocks all of the little colored pins out of the candidate's map, you will be hooked and checking your television schedule to see when the next episode is airing.  That is one of only a half-dozen scenes where Monk provides his bona fides as a detective.The most important thing is that in addition to all the quirky comedy shtick with Monk's super attention to detail, the crimes he is investigating are worthy of his attention.  The dynamic between Monk and Sharona becomes the pivot on which the pilot and all other episodes have turned, even though the idea of a potential romance between the two misses the point.  Just watch the scene where he blows away her date and you can see the foundation of their relationship and just more proof that this is the role of Shalhoub's career.  If you are not on the &quot;Monk&quot; bandwagon, then check this out.  If you are already a fan and do not have everything on tape, keep hope alive that all of Season 1 will be available sooner or later.",4,The pilot episode for Tony Shalhoub's &quot;Monk&quot; (but just that),1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,2320,"['Absolute', 'agreement', 'premier', 'episode', 'quot', 'Monk', 'quot', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'television', 'pilots', 'recent', 'vintage', 'only', 'having', 'one', 'episode', 'even', 'one', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'Consequently', 'DVD', 'not', 'really', 'devoted', 'fan', 'show', 'more', 'who', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'party', 'first', 'episode', 'need', 'get', 'up', 'speed', 'What', 'get', 'introduction', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'former', 'San', 'Francisco', 'homicide', 'detective', 'who', 'left', 'force', 'extreme', 'case', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'condition', 'afflicted', 'murder', 'wife', 'However', 'when', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'coaxed', 'retirement', 'former', 'boss', 'Captain', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'idea', 'Monk', 'now', 'private', 'consultant', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'pick', 'up', 'details', 'missed', 'other', 'detectives', 'can', 'think', 'Monk', 'really', 'quirky', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'full-time', 'nurse', 'Sharona', 'Fleming', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'role', 'Watson', 'However', 'more', 'time', 'serving', 'buffer', 'Monk', 'real', 'world', 'result', 'one', 'rare', 'delights', 'television', 'last', 'season', 'first', 'television', 'show', 'cross', 'cable', 'networks', 'time', 'get', 'scene', 'where', 'Monk', 'little', 'colored', 'candidate', 'map', 'will', 'be', 'hooked', 'checking', 'television', 'schedule', 'see', 'when', 'next', 'episode', 'airing', 'one', 'only', 'half-dozen', 'scenes', 'where', 'Monk', 'bona', 'fides', 'detective.The', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'addition', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'shtick', 'Monk', 'super', 'attention', 'detail', 'crimes', 'investigating', 'are', 'worthy', 'attention', 'dynamic', 'Monk', 'Sharona', 'pivot', 'pilot', 'other', 'episodes', 'have', 'turned', 'even', 'idea', 'potential', 'romance', 'two', 'point', 'Just', 'watch', 'scene', 'where', 'away', 'date', 'can', 'see', 'foundation', 'relationship', 'just', 'more', 'proof', 'role', 'Shalhoub', 'career', 'are', 'not', 'quot', 'Monk', 'quot', 'bandwagon', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'everything', 'tape', 'keep', 'hope', 'Season', '1', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'sooner', 'later']",N/A

602419,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JLN6,Mark Baker,"[130, 131]","When an assassin takes a shot at a mayoral candidate, the current mayor insists that Monk is brought in as a consultant on the case.  Adrian Monk has been consulting for three years trying to get over his intense fears and obsessive compulsive disorder enough to return full time to the force.  Still, his curses are also gifts that help him notice little things others miss.  Right away, he makes a connection between this case and another murder that otherwise would appear unrelated.  But can Monk figure out what is going on?I came to the party rather late, not watching until season 2.  I was quite anxious to see the pilot because I wanted to get the complete background on the character.  Since I've seen almost every episode now, I did know the basics of what I needed to know, so I could just sit back and enjoy the storyline.I am a mystery fiend, and I especially love a good puzzle.  Monk is wonderful for that, and this episode is no exception.  I should have seen the ending coming, but, as usual, was taken completely by surprise.  There are some wonderful laugh out loud moments as well.The episode does fall into the traps of a series premier.  Since we need to know about our characters, story is often slowed down for exposition.  While it would have been helpful the first time around, I didn't need it.  Fortunately, we were treated to the back story in small doses, so it didn't slow the story down for long.  Also, the actors and writers are still trying to define the characters.  While not as sharp as they later in the series, they're quite acceptable here.I'm not completely sure why this DVD was put out.  Maybe it was to test the waters or hold over fans until season one was released.  Either way, all you get here is the two part pilot episode.  No extras whatsoever.  Since it's included again in the recently released complete season 1 set, if you are a fan of the series, just pass right on by.Monk is one of the most original and entertaining shows currently on TV anywhere.  While not perfect, this is a great intro to the character and tone of the series.  If you only want an intro, get this disc.

On one hand I love Monk, and  think it is one of the freshest and most original sitcoms to come in years. It success revolving around and helped greatly by the wonderful Tony Shalhoub, (a talent that the Coen brothers had had the insight to exploit to the great benefit of their movies, Barton Fink and The Man Who Wasn't There). So the series itself gets my full deserved marks.Yet on the other hand, this DVD release is truly baffling!(hence my three marks). With the boom in the market,dozens of TV sitcoms and series have gone digital in their entirety,one season after another! Even series like Married with Children, Ally Mc Beal and Spin City have had 'a best of episodes' editions from one or two seasons. What we have here is only ONE episode of Monk!! I don't know who in the studios echelons of power have taken that decision, but it is surely a very misjudged one.

His role as unhinged-movie-producer-from-hell in the Coen brothers' movie Barton Fink was exhilarating. As was his performance as superlawyer in The Man Who Wasn't There (the Coens certainly know talent when they see it).The only negative thing that can be said about Monk is that it's long overdue. The writing's good. It's very good actually. But some episodes are better than others. In Monk Meets Dale the Whale, for example, the dialogue is badly dubbed and the continuity is choppy and hiccupy. The storylines are mostly standard TV show plots, some even seem recycled from old episodes of Streets of San Francisco or Scooby Doo. So you shouldn't watch Monk for the ingenious plots - it's Monk's phobia-intensive behaviour and case-solving talent that we're after. Well, that and Sharona's great legs.
