This one is only a slight bit tougher than the first Dummies video but it is worth having.  It seems to be assumed that the viewer has been doing the first video faithfully and has developed more flexibility and balance.  It uses both quite a bit more than the first video did.  It is a good workout and Sara Ivanhoe talks you through it like in the first one.This video is a great addition to any yoga video library!",5,A step up from the basics; nice video!,1043193600,"01 22, 2003",2003,478,"['Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'good', 'effective', 'yoga', 'workout', 'one', 'only', 'slight', 'bit', 'tougher', 'first', 'Dummies', 'video', 'worth', 'having', 'be', 'assumed', 'viewer', 'been', 'doing', 'first', 'video', 'faithfully', 'developed', 'more', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'first', 'video', 'did', 'good', 'workout', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'talks', 'first', 'one.This', 'video', 'great', 'addition', 'yoga', 'video', 'library']",N/A

714038,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00006FMB0,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[13, 13]","Sara Ivanhoe's nurturing teaching style makes her workouts perfect for beginners, but even if you are intermediate, she still knows how to present challenging postures in a way that makes you  want to try them. This workout begins with a series of stretches to warm up the upper body, but you may want to walk for 20-30 minutes or do some aerobics to warm up the muscles. I found that without the walking or biking, I was not as flexible.""The Daily Dozen"" exercises are a little more challenging than the first DVD and I was actually surprised at two of the exercises because they almost seemed advanced. It was more the length of time you are required to hold the posture that seems to make them go beyond intermediate. Upward Dog is surprisingly challenging when held for six breaths. Normally I've tried this in a vinyasa style workout with flowing postures. When you take each posture and focus your attention for six breaths, this becomes a test of patience and endurance. The postures include:ChairWarriorTriangleWide Leg Standing Forward BendLow Lunge TwistUpward Facing DogDolphinCow - I had never seen this exercise before! Total challenge!Wide Leg Seated Forward BendReclined ButterflySupine TwistFinal RelaxationI really loved ""Dolphin"" which is like Downward dog with your arms bent and your head almost on the floor. It tests your upper body strength and balance, but feels great once you are done with the breathing exercises. Each posture presents a physical and psychological challenge which makes them even more fun.""Cow"" felt very much like an advanced exercise, mostly because of the flexibility required to even get into the posture. I literally sat there laughing when I realized there was no way my legs would ""pretzel"" the way the exercise required. So, you may just want to adapt that one for beginner/intermediate and it still seems to have the desired effect. Beginners will find some of the exercises to be more intermediate, and intermediate practitioners may find this workout great for developing patience.For some reason, which I can't explain, Sara Ivanhoe's workouts leave me feeling more centered, balanced and generally happy and peaceful. It is as if the world spins a little more smoothly after the workout. A meditation session is also offered and Sara Ivanhoe teaches you a new mudra. I can also highly recommend her Candlelight Yoga workout and all of her 20-minute Makeovers.Items needed: Yoga Mat~The Rebecca Review",5,Yoga Postures for Strength and Flexibility,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,2457,"['Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'nurturing', 'teaching', 'style', 'workouts', 'perfect', 'beginners', 'even', 'are', 'intermediate', 'still', 'how', 'present', 'challenging', 'postures', 'way', 'want', 'try', 'workout', 'series', 'stretches', 'warm', 'up', 'upper', 'body', 'may', 'want', 'walk', '20-30', 'minutes', 'do', 'aerobics', 'warm', 'up', 'muscles', 'found', 'walking', 'biking', 'was', 'not', 'flexible', 'Daily', 'Dozen', 'exercises', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'challenging', 'first', 'DVD', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'two', 'exercises', 'almost', 'seemed', 'advanced', 'was', 'more', 'length', 'time', 'are', 'required', 'hold', 'posture', 'make', 'go', 'intermediate', 'Upward', 'Dog', 'surprisingly', 'challenging', 'when', 'held', 'six', 'breaths', 'Normally', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'vinyasa', 'style', 'flowing', 'postures', 'When', 'take', 'posture', 'focus', 'attention', 'six', 'breaths', 'test', 'patience', 'endurance', 'postures', 'include', 'ChairWarriorTriangleWide', 'Leg', 'Standing', 'Forward', 'BendLow', 'Lunge', 'TwistUpward', 'Facing', 'DogDolphinCow', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'exercise', 'Total', 'challenge', 'Wide', 'Leg', 'Seated', 'Forward', 'BendReclined', 'ButterflySupine', 'TwistFinal', 'RelaxationI', 'really', 'loved', 'Dolphin', 'Downward', 'dog', 'arms', 'bent', 'head', 'almost', 'floor', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'balance', 'great', 'are', 'done', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'posture', 'physical', 'psychological', 'challenge', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'Cow', 'felt', 'very', 'much', 'advanced', 'exercise', 'mostly', 'flexibility', 'required', 'even', 'get', 'posture', 'literally', 'sat', 'laughing', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'way', 'legs', 'would', 'pretzel', 'way', 'exercise', 'required', 'So', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'adapt', 'one', 'beginner/intermediate', 'still', 'have', 'desired', 'effect', 'Beginners', 'will', 'find', 'exercises', 'be', 'more', 'intermediate', 'intermediate', 'practitioners', 'may', 'find', 'workout', 'great', 'developing', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'workouts', 'leave', 'feeling', 'more', 'centered', 'balanced', 'generally', 'happy', 'peaceful', 'world', 'little', 'more', 'smoothly', 'workout', 'meditation', 'session', 'also', 'offered', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'new', 'mudra', 'can', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Candlelight', 'Yoga', 'workout', '20-minute', 'Makeovers.Items', 'needed', 'Yoga', 'Mat~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

714040,A27KQ8MMLNFD1B,B00006FMB0,Sara,"[24, 24]","Just when I was getting bored with the routine from ""Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies"", they decided to come out with a sequel with the same instructor (the always wonderful Sara Ivanhoe) but with a more challenging workout.  I had been doing the old routine for about 10 months when I decided to step things up a bit and buy the sequel.  This video is a fitting follow-up to the first.  While the first routine introduced you to yoga and got you used to practicing it on a regular basis, the second video really gets you into it and presents a good workout for the body.  You will be surprised at how fit this yoga workout will make you feel.  I've been doing the workout for 6 months now, and I'm more toned and muscular, and I've even lost some weight!  (Never meant to, though, it just happened...)  When I noticed that my clothes didn't fit as snuggly as they used to, and I had to buy smaller rings, I knew the yoga was working!Like the first video, the instructor goes through each pose step-by-step to make sure you are doing it properly.  If you're a veteran of the first video, you'll have no problem learning the new routine.  But even if this is your first time, you will have no problem learning and doing the poses since the instructor makes yoga so accessible for everyone.  And the good thing about the video is that you can watch it a few times, memorize the routine, and then do it on your own after that.With this video, who needs to spend money on expensive yoga classes at the gym?  You'll get a great workout at a great price.",5,Excellent follow-up to the first,1049673600,"04 7, 2003",2003,1546,"['Just', 'when', 'was', 'getting', 'bored', 'routine', 'Basic', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'Dummies', 'decided', 'come', 'out', 'sequel', 'same', 'instructor', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'more', 'challenging', 'workout', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'old', 'routine', '10', 'months', 'when', 'decided', 'step', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'buy', 'sequel', 'video', 'fitting', 'follow-up', 'first', 'first', 'routine', 'introduced', 'yoga', 'got', 'used', 'practicing', 'regular', 'basis', 'second', 'video', 'really', 'good', 'workout', 'body', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'fit', 'yoga', 'workout', 'will', 'make', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'workout', '6', 'months', 'now', ""'m"", 'more', 'toned', 'muscular', ""'ve"", 'even', 'lost', 'weight', 'Never', 'meant', 'though', 'just', 'happened', 'When', 'noticed', 'clothes', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'as', 'snuggly', 'used', 'had', 'buy', 'smaller', 'rings', 'knew', 'yoga', 'was', 'working', 'first', 'video', 'instructor', 'pose', 'step-by-step', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'doing', 'properly', ""'re"", 'veteran', 'first', 'video', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'learning', 'new', 'routine', 'even', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'learning', 'doing', 'poses', 'instructor', 'yoga', 'so', 'accessible', 'everyone', 'good', 'thing', 'video', 'can', 'watch', 'few', 'times', 'memorize', 'routine', 'then', 'do', 'own', 'that.With', 'video', 'who', 'spend', 'money', 'expensive', 'yoga', 'classes', 'gym', ""'ll"", 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'great', 'price']",N/A
