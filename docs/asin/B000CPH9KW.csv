First of all, it's sadly amusing to the inth degree.  Here we have a sensitive, pretty but fading, highly intelligent, well educated and well read older woman who's lost two husbands and and is lonely.  Along comes an attractive, viable man about her own age.  Who wouldn't perk up for that?  But what she gets is a whole lot more than she bargained for.

But I had to see it anyway, and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it was one of Michael's &#34;bad guy&#34; portrayals, (that he does so well) but his characterization of Henry Kent was so absolutely charming for most of the movie, that I have watched it several times since.

959634,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B000CPH9KW,Richard B. Schwartz,"[12, 12]","No, it's not the old pop ballad.  Here, we're falling into the abyss.  The Andrew Davies script and Michael Kitchen performance are worth the price of admission.  Kitchen plays the innocuously named Henry Kent, a local Yorkshireman living on a canal boat.  When a London novelist (the wonderful Penelope Wilton) arrives at her recently-purchased cottage, fresh from a failed marriage and ready to go to work, Henry appears.  He offers his gardening services, then volunteers to take care of the cottage in her absence, then volunteers to help warm her bed.  He tells her stories of lost loves and his victimization at the hands of the class system.  Slowly it dawns on her that he is not quite what he appears to be.  Her agent and a gay male friend both scope him out as bad news from the get-go.  It takes the novelist longer, since he has expressed his love for her and exhibited his sexual prowess on cold, damp Yorkshire nights.  After they argue and he strikes her she sets off on an investigation of his past and learns what has really happened.  He is an opportunist who exploits wealthy women . . . or worse.This is a small film, but not a claustrophobic one.  Many of us think of Michael Kitchen as the benevolent Christopher Foyle, but he has long played villain roles.  He plays them expertly.  Falling is creepy and laced with tension but it is not full-tilt gothic with blood splattering across the walls.  It is plausible, domestic gothic, with good direction, an excellent script and superb performances.  Also some brief nudity and adult language.  Watch this before you hire any volunteers to fix up your garden.",5,"No, Not That 'Falling'",1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,1630,"['not', 'old', 'pop', 'ballad', 'Here', ""'re"", 'falling', 'abyss', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'script', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'performance', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'Kitchen', 'innocuously', 'named', 'Henry', 'Kent', 'local', 'Yorkshireman', 'living', 'canal', 'boat', 'When', 'London', 'novelist', 'wonderful', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'recently-purchased', 'cottage', 'fresh', 'failed', 'marriage', 'ready', 'go', 'work', 'Henry', 'gardening', 'services', 'then', 'take', 'care', 'cottage', 'absence', 'then', 'volunteers', 'help', 'warm', 'bed', 'stories', 'lost', 'loves', 'victimization', 'hands', 'class', 'system', 'Slowly', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'be', 'agent', 'gay', 'male', 'friend', 'scope', 'out', 'bad', 'news', 'get-go', 'novelist', 'longer', 'expressed', 'love', 'exhibited', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'cold', 'damp', 'Yorkshire', 'nights', 'argue', 'off', 'investigation', 'past', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'opportunist', 'who', 'wealthy', 'women', 'worse.This', 'small', 'film', 'not', 'claustrophobic', 'one', 'Many', 'think', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'benevolent', 'Christopher', 'Foyle', 'long', 'played', 'villain', 'roles', 'expertly', 'Falling', 'creepy', 'laced', 'tension', 'not', 'full-tilt', 'gothic', 'blood', 'splattering', 'walls', 'plausible', 'domestic', 'gothic', 'good', 'direction', 'excellent', 'script', 'superb', 'performances', 'Also', 'brief', 'nudity', 'adult', 'language', 'Watch', 'hire', 'volunteers', 'fix', 'up', 'garden']",Falling
