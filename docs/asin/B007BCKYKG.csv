I was pleasantly surprised how very good it was.The story is interesting. It had plenty of twists and turns that kept me interested throughout keeping your interest up until the end. Some of the story, I thought could have used some work, for example, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric is unlikely to be too excited about going to his boy birthday party. If he did, he would not mention it publicly. The scene, however, is important as it shows the attitude the cleric has to his disciple. To the people that organise suicide bombers, these people are a weapon, not people. Some of the other scenes on recruitment to Islamic terrorism seemed a bit too simple - Hollywoodish. Still overall it was well done. It showed a young muslim guy looking for something and how he gets drawn to terrorism.The acting was good. The characters are interesting.

1529077,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007BCKYKG,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","There appears to be a trend in the film industry to explore the concept of terrorism from both sides. This insightful film addresses this very concept of sharing with the audience the factors behind what encourages men to terrorist acts, especially those of suicide bombers who by their actions work with the concept that in carrying out such bombings to kill infidels they gain immediate access into Paradise with the concomitant virgins and joining deceased family and friends.The title holds some clues as to the film's direction: `A `cleanskin' is a term for an undercover operative unknown to his or her targets, or, as more commonly used in the UK following the London bombings, an extremist with no previous convictions so therefore unknown to national security.' A strangely quiet man named simply Ewan (Sean Bean) is a rather ruthless British Secret Service Agent who with his partner Mark (Tom Burke) is directed by his superiors Charlotte (Charlotte Rampling) and Scott (James Fox), and faced with the task of pursuing and eliminating a British born Muslim suicide bomber Ash (Abhin Galeya) and his terrorist cell directed by Nabil (Peter Polycarpou). The complexities of misinformation and unnecessary murders and the use of flashbacks and flash forwards to help the viewer understand the motivations of each of the characters gives us a better view of the conflicted personalities of all involved. The process of pursuing the capture and the perpetration of the terrorist activity is full of surprising twists and turns and the resolution is entirely unexpected.While the film focuses attention on Sean Bean as the name actor, the story really belongs to the very gifted young British actor Abhin Galeya who plays Ash, a handsome idealistic student in love with a non-Muslim girl Kate (Tuppence Middleton) who struggles with the concept of terrorism yet grows into a man with a terrifyingly single-minded mission. His relationship to his partner Yussif (Chris Ryman) and the influence of Nabil allows us to understand why terrorist suicide bombers gain their convictions.The film was written and briskly directed by Hadi Hajaig. CLEANSKIN has much more to offer than mere entertainment: there is considerable investigation into the continuation of terrorist idealism and resultant activities both in England and in all parts of the world.

Except for the sex scenes which at my age are just tedious. So the Islamic murderers and their henchmen are being killed by revenge-minded Sean Bean, and I'm thinking....wait a minute...this is a movie about radical Islam made by British filmmakers. Brit filmmakers are as bad or worse than American filmmakers i.e. paranoid leftists when it comes to making flicks about Islamic killers. Something doesn't seem right.

Having said that, I still watch all his films when they come out but I had low expectations that this very familiar story about preventing a terrorist attack on British soil would be much good. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised that this turned out to be a terrific spy/thriller. The biggest reason the film is so good in my view is because of the 'back story' about the terrorist which is so well done and it makes up at least 40% of the film which is not what you typically see in this kind of ""the British Secret Service kicks butt"" kind of film. The scenes showing how Abhin Galeva who plays the bomber, is transformed from brilliant Law Student to committed suicide bomber really help explain what is going on in the world today. As his narrative was played over the final scenes of the movie while Sean Bean is trying to stop the attack, I was riveted. And while at times Sean Bean looks once again like he's sleepwalking thru his part here the ending of this movie with him and his Boss played by Charlotte Rampling is absolutely awesome!

Include the marvelous Charlotte Rampling, and it's an added bonus that's hard to resist.  ""Cleanskin"" is yet another British action film that examines the effects of terrorism on domestic soil.  There have been so many films and TV shows on this subject, it might well be impossible to offer up anything new.  ""Cleanskin,"" from a plotting standpoint, certainly isn't breaking the mold you've come to expect.  It opens with a bold action sequence, obvious budget constraints, and sketchy character development.  After about thirty minutes, I'd almost written it off as unimaginative and completely routine.  But the uneven tone of the opening slowly starts to settle itself into a groove and the picture begins to get progressively better.  Credit must be given to Bean.  He doesn't have a lot of shading, but his relentless brutality is riveting.  Even better, though, is Abhin Galeya.  Galeya, as the terrorist, is given the story's most complex arc and really paints a compelling foe who is surprisingly identifiable.Bean is an undercover operative within the British Secret Service.  On assignment, he loses some explosives in a violent heist.  His disappointed superiors (Rampling and James Fox) task him to right the situation, still keeping the entire operation off the books.  Bean is single-minded and uncompromising.  With a new partner, he'll do whatever it takes to achieve mission goals.  In addition to this story, we also meet Galeya and (through flashbacks) we see how he developed into a violent extremist.  While the earliest flashbacks have a little awkwardness (and his recruitment isn't particularly compelling), they do serve as an introduction that the screenplay builds on.  As you might anticipate, the alternate plot threads have Bean tracking the explosives and Galeya moving toward the ultimate goal of using them.  As the two intersect, who will emerge victorious?  Can Bean stop the next attack?  And can he trust those around him?As I said, the beginning of ""Cleanskin"" is incredibly uneven.  But stick with it.  Galeya, whose initial motivations are relatively unexplored, gives a strong and compelling performance.  Although not a big budget spectacle, the action sequences have a gritty brutality that serves the piece well.  Even the plot gets twistier and more involving as the film progresses.  Although not perfect, I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Bean or of the genre.  The movie gets stronger and stronger and ends with a pleasantly grim final act well worth waiting for.  I didn't expect to, but in the end I really came to like this spare and vicious little film.  Starts at 3 stars, finishes at 4 1/2.

The film chronicles the evolution of a British-born Muslim law student in London (""Ash"" played by Abhin Galeya) into a suicide bomber. It's filled with action, and it has you on the edge of your seat for a full two hours. It's by far the best commercial film I've seen on ""homegrown"" terrorist recruitment, practically a video handbook:1. Recruiters for terror cells are like recruiters for any other cult---They seek out isolated, disaffected young people:Ash is bright and handsome but feels alienated from his fellow law students, some of whom call him derogatory names. His recruitment starts with a bar fight over a girl.2. The terror recruiters, rather than building up their recruits' sense of self-worth, break it down:""You see?"" says the recruiter, an Imam, ""They call you a ""n****r""; they call you a ""Paki"", you will never be like them. You have been hated all your life. Look what they've done to you! You're weak! You can't make your own choices! Only a coward wants to be like his oppressor, and you are oppressed, and you are a coward!""3. Then the recruiter extols membership in the cult:""You are a member of an ancient civilization. An honorable civilization. You are not like them, with their decadent drinking, their music, their shameless women. You don't want to be like them...They are drunkards, they eat swine, they defile the sanctity of their bodies and their souls! There is not one decent one among them. They are not like us, they are worthless, they have no values, and they have no value even to themselves. If you are with us, you will have given up all that self-abuse. Be a man!""4. The recruiter then globalizes the issue:""And it is not just you. It is your brothers everywhere. In Chechnya. In Kosovo. In Palestine. In Iraq. In Afghanistan. They not only want to spread their decadence to you, here, but they want to spread their decadence all over this earth!""5. The pitch:""It is up to you to stop them!""After Ash accompanies a more experienced terrorist on a local ""mission"" that ends in the decapitation of a husband, wife, and infant, the decision is made to send Ash overseas ""for more and better training."" He comes back a bombmaker. And even at that point, he moves among the population of London innocuously, he dates non-Muslim women, and nobody sees what's uncoiling inside him. At a half-dozen points he almost takes off his dynamite vest, but in the end, his own inadequacies, aided and abetted by his recruiters' constant exhortations, consume his entire life.What's hopeful is that not everyone the recruiters approach falls for their ""You're a Victim!"" routine. What's less hopeful is that because the recruiters move among (and claim to be) members of a legitimate religious community, even the people who send the recruiters away tend to do nothing and say nothing to undermine what is obviously occurring.I had never heard of CLEANSKIN (the title comes from the fact that Ash is an unknown terrorist without a history; he has ""clean skin""). I watched this, purely by chance, at a friend's house in the wake of the Boston bombing.  Idiots like the Tsarnaev brothers couldn't exist if there wasn't a conspiracy of silence in Islam. But we don't hear Imams coming out publicly decrying the violence and the loss of life in Boston and elsewhere. Muslims who do decry the violence are silenced or ignored, expelled from their communities, like Irshad Manji, or worse, like Salman Rushdie, given death sentences.The fact is, these terrorists make up a cult, but it's a cult given legitimacy by its association with a legitimate religious structure. And it's a cult that few Muslims choose to challenge for fear of social ostracism or, worse, targeting by the cult.But at least I understand the Tsarnaev brothers now. Their uncle was right.

1529099,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B007BCKYKG,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[1, 2]","Sean Bean is slumming it a bit here in this relatively low budget British thriller, set in the world of counter terrorism.  In this context, Cleanskin is an extremist unknown to the security forces as they have no prior record or convictions.  Bean effortlessly plays the role of an ex serviceman now employed to do skulduggery by the government, his handler played by Charlotte Rampling of all people, who reports to James Fox.  All of whom seem out of place with the apparent low budget and straight to DVD feel of the movie.Having said that, although the action scenes are well contained and feel real world-y, the more interesting part is the story, partly told in flashback, of how Ash (Abhin Galeya, who does very well) goes from UK student with anger management issues, to a terrorist willing to sacrifice his life.  His journey is the most interesting, by far, of the characters.  Bean does well enough, but he is on autopilot here, and how Rampling and Fox were persuaded to be in it is anybodys guess, though their very presence does lend a little class to the movie.  Still the action certainly rattles along, and the director never fails to make the most of an opportunity to show someone's brains being blown out in as much detail as possible.There are plot holes all over the place, and the behaviour of some of the characters doesn't always make sense.  The introduction of Sean Bean in his first shoot-out does seem to leave you to think that he is somehow not as professional as the rest of the movie would like you to believe he is.  The score effectively sounds cinematic enough to propel the action and at 108 minutes it's about the right length for the amount of story to be told.  It's not a disaster, but as a budget buy this will fill some of your spare time for you well enough.  Certainly for a movie that looks fairly exploitational from the cover, it does a surprising job of showing two sides of an all too current story, in an interesting and even-handed way, tied in to a thriller format.",3,Budget thriller veneer covers more interesting investigation of topical subject,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,2019,"['Sean', 'Bean', 'slumming', 'bit', 'here', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'British', 'thriller', 'set', 'world', 'counter', 'terrorism', 'context', 'Cleanskin', 'extremist', 'unknown', 'security', 'forces', 'have', 'prior', 'record', 'convictions', 'Bean', 'effortlessly', 'role', 'ex', 'serviceman', 'now', 'employed', 'do', 'skulduggery', 'government', 'handler', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'people', 'who', 'James', 'Fox', 'whom', 'seem', 'place', 'apparent', 'low', 'budget', 'straight', 'DVD', 'feel', 'movie.Having', 'said', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'contained', 'feel', 'real', 'world-y', 'more', 'interesting', 'part', 'story', 'partly', 'told', 'flashback', 'how', 'Ash', 'Abhin', 'Galeya', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'UK', 'student', 'anger', 'management', 'issues', 'terrorist', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'life', 'journey', 'most', 'interesting', 'far', 'characters', 'Bean', 'well', 'enough', 'autopilot', 'here', 'how', 'Rampling', 'Fox', 'were', 'persuaded', 'be', 'anybodys', 'guess', 'very', 'presence', 'lend', 'little', 'class', 'movie', 'Still', 'action', 'certainly', 'along', 'director', 'never', 'make', 'most', 'opportunity', 'show', 'someone', 'brains', 'being', 'blown', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'possible.There', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'place', 'behaviour', 'characters', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'introduction', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'first', 'shoot-out', 'seem', 'leave', 'think', 'somehow', 'not', 'as', 'professional', 'rest', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'score', 'effectively', 'cinematic', 'enough', 'propel', 'action', '108', 'minutes', 'right', 'length', 'amount', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'not', 'disaster', 'budget', 'buy', 'will', 'fill', 'spare', 'time', 'well', 'enough', 'Certainly', 'movie', 'fairly', 'exploitational', 'cover', 'surprising', 'job', 'showing', 'two', 'sides', 'too', 'current', 'story', 'interesting', 'even-handed', 'way', 'tied', 'thriller', 'format']",N/A

Only down side was a few slow moments, but then it is a mystery-thriller more than an action movie so no roller coaster ride here. Sean Bean's secret service character doesn't channel Bond or any of the American action heroes so the action is more low-key. Although the fighting sequences are fairly realistic.One issue I found was with the pistol silencers. One scene we have the the next we don't. The scene with the lads running about the streets of London in broad daylight busting caps without silencers was awkward; especially since they just had silencers a few moments before. They go banging about and no one is the wiser in a city where guns are banned???  Tsk-Tsk!!It gets a tad side-tracked with the love story bit, but even that has some relevance to the plot. I deducted two stars just because of the lags, some of which is caused by the bouncing back and forth between ""then and now"" --- for crying out loud, there is a time and place for flashbacks and a way to use them effectively, this movie doesn't manage it well. I think it adds to the slowness and confusion. Character development could have been better.I tend to appreciate the roller-coaster style movies where something is constantly happening. This was somewhat too slow for my taste. It doesn't serve to ""make one think"" much either so I can't even give it credit for trying to be a message movie, which it clearly was trying to be. While I found this worth the $3.99.Rent it?  YES, if you like the whole anti-terrorist thing, and some blood.  Own it?

I was hoping that the silly girlfriend would help him see the light that what he was doing was senseless, but the writers took the story in a different direction. I wonder if any of these pawns ever wake up just before the press the trigger? I'm pretty sure it has happened.
