The most ridiculous situations, dialogue with zero self-awareness and a story that is so beyond preposterous it is mind boggling. The story involves a snake out to kill a mom/daughter because they ran over it's mate and &#34;it must have seen you do it&#34; and now it's mad enough to not only follow you, but marshal an entire desert to come after you. With some Mexican drug smugglers and an old desert man thrown in for good measure.

1641809,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00C5OZL5S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","The most surprising thing about the low budget survival story ""Venom"" is just how seriously it takes itself. It is both perplexing and a critical error. As a lover of bad movies, I almost always see the humor and fun in the biggest duds. I'm afraid, however, that ""Venom"" is so slow and amateurish that I can't believe it didn't strive for ANY camp value. No, it wants to be a thoughtful story about a mother and daughter surviving and bonding under treacherous conditions. But with the dialogue being truly clunky and cringe-worthy and the dangers being so preposterous and the characters being absolutely inane, there isn't much to grasp onto. It certainly isn't good and it is absolutely no fun.For some reason, the mother (a charmless and monotone Jessica Morris) in the story is a famous singer who happens to have a drug problem. The first few minutes of the movie establish her issues in a debauched sequence of overindulging in a nightclub. Why? Who knows, it has little to do with anything. She whisks her estranged daughter (a whiny Oliviah Crawford) on a trip to a ranch where they can reconnect and get away from the pressures of the big concert tour. MY FAVORITE MOMENT: Morris asks Crawford if she wants to hear the song they worked on together and then plays a synthesized track that has no words but ""oh baby."" I'm sure that would pack audiences into sold out stadiums! For some reason, the ranch is in the middle of nowhere without even a paved road. They are literally driving through the middle of the desert. Morris hits a snake with the car and gets snake gut scent on her that will cause venomous snakes to travel hundreds of miles for revenge. Sound good? Only if you think watching a little snake slither across sand is enthralling.Oh, did I mention the car has a faulty starter that wasn't fixed before this little trip? Did I mention that Morris gets frustrated when talking to her husband, so she throws her cell phone into the desert and drives off? It's stupidity layered onto stupidity while Morris looks around this desolate landscape repeating how everything looks familiar to her eagle eye (apparently she was raised in the desert when she was a child). The snakes are not scary or menacing and are badly handled. But they aren't the only danger. A drug cartel is also wandering around in the dust. But I won't spoil anything else. I'd say you have to see it for yourself, but that would be cruel of me. Again, I don't mind a dumb movie but ""Venom"" is also dreadfully dull. It took me three sittings to get all the way through, but I swore I'd do it! I was as persistent as a snake bent on vengeance!

Later the wound moves to his upper arm. Likewise Helen has a tourniquet on her elbow that disappears for a while. The explanation is that Helen has the smell of the dead snake she ran over on her which is why the snakes are after her, the snake she didn't touch but removed with a stick.
