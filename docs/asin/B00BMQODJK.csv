This movie had the children (ages 8, 6, and almost 3) in constant giggles. I'm not even sure what was so funny as I couldn't keep my eyes off of the kids but it was a joy to hear them laughing away. My husband and I also found this movie to be refreshingly different than so many out there now days. It had a nice flow and was not over stimulating. The 80 minute movie kept our children captivated with the story and fun as they learned along with Pocoyo. Thank you!",5,Plenty of giggles!,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,602,"['Hi', 'Everyone', 'just', 'wanted', 'share', 'family', 'experience', 'month', 'NCircle', 'Entertainment', 'NSider', 'movie', 'Pocoyo', 'Circus', 'movie', 'had', 'children', '8', '6', 'almost', '3', 'constant', 'giggles', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'kids', 'was', 'joy', 'hear', 'laughing', 'away', 'husband', 'also', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'so', 'many', 'there', 'now', 'days', 'had', 'nice', 'flow', 'was', 'not', 'stimulating', '80', 'minute', 'movie', 'kept', 'children', 'captivated', 'story', 'fun', 'learned', 'Pocoyo', 'Thank']",Pocoyo: Pocoyo Circus

My almost 5-year-old really enjoys it. Whether the lesson is doing as asked or figuring whose foot prints are left before getting scared of your own this DVD has them all. Our whole family enjoys watching this with our daughter.,5,Cute Shows that Teach,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,329,"['Pocoyo', 'adorable', 'show', 'teaches', 'day', 'lessons', 'fun', 'way', 'DVD', 'different', 'almost', '5-year-old', 'really', 'lesson', 'doing', 'asked', 'figuring', 'foot', 'prints', 'are', 'left', 'getting', 'scared', 'own', 'DVD', 'whole', 'family', 'watching', 'daughter']",Pocoyo: Pocoyo Circus

1635704,A1IY1UDG9BNQXF,B00BMQODJK,NB83,"[0, 0]","My kids and I really enjoyed watching the ""Pocoyo's Circus"" DVD from NCircle that will be released on August 27. In the first episode, aliens recruit Pocoyo and his friends to perform in their space circus show. In ""Mystery Footprints"", Pocoyo examines different footprints and assumes Pato's flipper footprints are from a monster until he discovers the truth! In the next episode, Pocoyo's balloon floats away, but his friends aren't able to help him retrieve it. He is frustrated and angry until he realizes his friends are much more valuable to him. In ""Who's Calling Me Now"", Pocoyo discovers a box of various whistles that the friends use to call to each other, and the result is quite humorous. My kids thought this episode was especially hilarious! When Pocoyo puts off giving Baby Bird a driving lesson in ""Vamoosh on the Loose"", he decides to take off by himself and causes quite a commotion. In ""New on the Planet"" a shy little alien that ends up in Pocoyo's world is frightened of the characters that live there until he realizes they are afraid of him as well. ""Mad Mix Machine"" is about a contraption that allows Pocoyo to combine different objects to make one funny object like a trumpet that plays the radio, a train telephone, a bouncing bone and a cake hat. In ""Remember When"", the friends watch videos starring themselves and making fun of their friends, but Baby Bird and Caterpillar's video is the favorite because it showcases everyone. Pocoyo is a great show for kids because it encourages the development of problem solving skills and teaches lessons about friendship. Pocoyo is always eliciting giggles from my little guys! This is definitely a worthy addition to any Pocoyo fan's collection!",5,Very cute Pocoyo DVD,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,1716,"['kids', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Pocoyo', 'Circus', 'DVD', 'NCircle', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'August', '27', 'first', 'episode', 'recruit', 'Pocoyo', 'friends', 'perform', 'space', 'circus', 'show', 'Mystery', 'Footprints', 'Pocoyo', 'different', 'footprints', 'Pato', 'flipper', 'footprints', 'are', 'monster', 'truth', 'next', 'episode', 'Pocoyo', 'balloon', 'floats', 'away', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'help', 'retrieve', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'friends', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'valuable', 'Who', 'Calling', 'Me', 'Now', 'Pocoyo', 'box', 'various', 'whistles', 'friends', 'use', 'call', 'other', 'result', 'quite', 'humorous', 'kids', 'thought', 'episode', 'was', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'When', 'Pocoyo', 'giving', 'Baby', 'Bird', 'driving', 'lesson', 'Vamoosh', 'Loose', 'take', 'off', 'quite', 'commotion', 'New', 'Planet', 'shy', 'little', 'alien', 'up', 'Pocoyo', 'world', 'frightened', 'characters', 'live', 'there', 'are', 'afraid', 'as', 'well', 'Mad', 'Mix', 'Machine', 'contraption', 'Pocoyo', 'combine', 'different', 'objects', 'make', 'one', 'funny', 'object', 'trumpet', 'radio', 'train', 'telephone', 'bouncing', 'bone', 'cake', 'hat', 'Remember', 'When', 'friends', 'watch', 'videos', 'starring', 'making', 'fun', 'friends', 'Baby', 'Bird', 'Caterpillar', 'video', 'favorite', 'everyone', 'Pocoyo', 'great', 'show', 'kids', 'development', 'problem', 'solving', 'skills', 'teaches', 'lessons', 'friendship', 'Pocoyo', 'always', 'eliciting', 'giggles', 'little', 'guys', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Pocoyo', 'fan', 'collection']",Pocoyo: Pocoyo Circus

""Pocoyo went to the circus just like ME!""At four and five years old, my kids are still pretty self focused and the world revolves around them. So to see that one of their beloved characters did the same thing as them is enough reason for them to immediately demand to watch!It was fun watching it with them and having them point out the similarities between the circus we saw and this alien space circus. For example, they recognized that all of the aliens coming out of the car were similar to the clowns coming out at the circus. They remembered the juggling and the different performance acts; although there were no aliens at our circus!The white background and vibrant colors really make the focus on the characters and their story in Pocoyo and I like that there isn't a whole lot of distraction or unnecessary images to overload their minds. The narrator telling the entire story while the characters act it out is truly unique and I think it's part of what mesmerizes my kids. I can't think of anything else out there like that right now.Most Pocoyo episodes are super short at under ten minutes so it was really fun for my kids to watch Pocoyo's Circus and get a longer look at their fun friends! The rest of the episodes are the regular length so you get the best of both worlds!",5,Full Length Fun,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,1425,"['recently', 'went', 'circus', 'so', 'as', 'soon', 'Pocoyo', 'Circus', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'mail', 'Paige', 'was', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'excitement', 'Pocoyo', 'went', 'circus', 'just', 'ME', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'focused', 'world', 'So', 'see', 'one', 'beloved', 'characters', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'enough', 'reason', 'immediately', 'demand', 'watch', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'having', 'point', 'out', 'similarities', 'circus', 'saw', 'alien', 'space', 'circus', 'example', 'recognized', 'aliens', 'coming', 'car', 'were', 'similar', 'clowns', 'coming', 'out', 'circus', 'remembered', 'juggling', 'different', 'performance', 'acts', 'were', 'aliens', 'circus', 'white', 'background', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'really', 'make', 'focus', 'characters', 'story', 'Pocoyo', 'like', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'distraction', 'unnecessary', 'images', 'overload', 'minds', 'narrator', 'telling', 'entire', 'story', 'characters', 'act', 'out', 'truly', 'unique', 'think', 'part', 'what', 'mesmerizes', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'right', 'now.Most', 'Pocoyo', 'episodes', 'are', 'super', 'short', 'ten', 'minutes', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'kids', 'watch', 'Pocoyo', 'Circus', 'get', 'longer', 'look', 'fun', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'regular', 'length', 'get', 'best', 'worlds']",Pocoyo: Pocoyo Circus
