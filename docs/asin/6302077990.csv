The basic plot is that there's this guy, Harry Joy, who suffers a heart attack and is resuscitated.  However, such is the horror of his many epiphanies after this that he comes to believe that he was never resuscitated, and is now living in hell.The quality of the disks you're buying here is less than fantastic.  For example the film, while not long, has been rendered on two discs, and there is nothing for extra features.But highly recommended anyhow:  it's one of the most perfect movies I can think of.  There ending is so ineffably beautiful that you're going to wish you had watched the whole thing more carefully.Note that the film is based on a novel by Peter Carey.",5,sublime,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,974,"['bit', 'baffling', 'movie', 'twenty', 'so', 'years', 'release', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'U.S.', 'Not', 'only', 'available', 'only', 'import', 'Amazon', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'find', 'video', 'stores', 'rental.It', 'magical-realist-style', 'Australian', 'movie', 'late', '80s', 'basic', 'plot', 'guy', 'Harry', 'Joy', 'who', 'heart', 'attack', 'resuscitated', 'However', 'such', 'horror', 'many', 'epiphanies', 'believe', 'was', 'never', 'resuscitated', 'now', 'living', 'hell.The', 'quality', 'disks', ""'re"", 'buying', 'here', 'less', 'fantastic', 'example', 'film', 'not', 'long', 'been', 'rendered', 'two', 'discs', 'nothing', 'extra', 'features.But', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyhow', 'one', 'most', 'perfect', 'movies', 'can', 'think', 'ending', 'so', 'ineffably', 'beautiful', ""'re"", 'going', 'wish', 'had', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'more', 'carefully.Note', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Peter', 'Carey']",Bliss VHS

I use anOPPO DV-970HD Up-Converting Universal DVD Playerto view here in the US. As long as your TV is set to NTSC, the DVD is viewable using the OPPO. Picture quality is a step up from video-tape, but it is not the sharpest image. It is somewhat pixelated on a 50 inch plasma screen, though after so many years of only seeing this on video tape, its manageable. One aspect that is nice is that the DVD has better sound then the video, so there is more to hear with a decent audio set-up. It is still a great film, just as I remembered it from the mid 1980s. The last 20-30 minutes is extraordinarily beautiful. Just don't expect miracles in the presentation.

I recently read somewhere that there's a lengthier director's cut of the film; I believe this would definitely be worth a look as this film has great potential, but suffers from too many of the characters (as well as much of the plot) not being fully fleshed out. In other words, it all feels somewhat squeezed in to the roughly 110 minutes running time. I suspect that writers Ray Lawrence and Peter Carey struggled with trying to incorporate all the elements of Carey's novelBlissin to the film.",3,"Interesting, yet disjointed film",1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,558,"['mostly', 'enjoyed', 'Bliss', 'something', 'be', 'missing', 'recently', 'read', 'somewhere', 'lengthier', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'believe', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'look', 'film', 'great', 'potential', 'suffers', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'plot', 'not', 'being', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'other', 'words', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'squeezed', 'roughly', '110', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'suspect', 'writers', 'Ray', 'Lawrence', 'Peter', 'Carey', 'struggled', 'trying', 'incorporate', 'elements', 'Carey', 'novelBlissin', 'film']",Bliss VHS
294221,A2YISIVK4Y8S1Q,6302077990,Rico,"[1, 1]","Adapted from the Peter Carey novel, ""Bliss"" is the story of Harry Joy and the love letter that takes 8 years to be delivered. The movie hooks you with a compelling 5 minute opening scene in which the main character, Harry Joy, a 40ish ad exec, dies in his backyard during a birthday party and witnesses his own death as if it was someone else's. He floats in ecstasy above his body until he suddenly sees both the bliss of heaven and the tortures of hell. In this fear, he makes his way back to his body, reviving after being dead four minutes. And, as the narrator says, ""he would never be the same again.""  Knowing now, beyond a doubt, both heaven and, more importantly, hell do exist, Harry Joy begins a re-examination of his life and of those lives around him. The film exhibits a quirkiness frequently found in Australian cinema, and that is a compliment in this case. Through dream sequences, symbolic hallucinations and a bartender who talks to the camera, the movie leads Harry and the viewer to question whether his family and close associates are real or actually clever demons sent to torment him as he tries to make sense of life on earth now considering the knowledge he has acquired from his near-death experience. Harry's fractured life becomes refocused when he meets and falls for Honey Barbara, a neophyte call-girl(""a gifted amateur"") who visits the city from the rain forest to make some money. Barbara, beautiful and much younger than Harry, raises bees in the forest and her passion is honey. Harry and his new found love have a falling out, but, his former life now useless to him, Harry eventually follows after Honey Barbara to the rain forest. There he lives a remarkably transformed life planting trees and trying to win back the stubborn Honey Barbara. It is the rain forest where the stage is set for the ""love letter that takes 8 years to be delivered."" What that means will remain a mystery until you view the film. This is not a family film or shallow romantic comedy although there are some very funny scenes including one involving a circus elephant which, being trained to sit on big red boxes, accidentally sits on Harry's red Fiat when he parks it too close to the pachyderm. One of the funniest scenes in movie history. The movie contains some sexual scenes, brief nudity and memorable dialogue.",5,Epitaph for Harry Joy: He told stories and he planted trees,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,2333,"['Adapted', 'Peter', 'Carey', 'novel', 'Bliss', 'story', 'Harry', 'Joy', 'love', 'letter', '8', 'years', 'be', 'delivered', 'movie', 'compelling', '5', 'minute', 'opening', 'scene', 'main', 'character', 'Harry', 'Joy', '40ish', 'ad', 'exec', 'backyard', 'birthday', 'party', 'own', 'death', 'was', 'someone', 'else', 'ecstasy', 'body', 'suddenly', 'bliss', 'heaven', 'tortures', 'hell', 'fear', 'way', 'back', 'body', 'reviving', 'being', 'dead', 'four', 'minutes', 'narrator', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'Knowing', 'now', 'doubt', 'heaven', 'more', 'importantly', 'hell', 'do', 'exist', 'Harry', 'Joy', 're-examination', 'life', 'lives', 'film', 'quirkiness', 'frequently', 'found', 'Australian', 'cinema', 'compliment', 'case', 'dream', 'sequences', 'symbolic', 'hallucinations', 'bartender', 'who', 'camera', 'movie', 'Harry', 'viewer', 'question', 'family', 'close', 'associates', 'are', 'real', 'actually', 'clever', 'demons', 'sent', 'torment', 'make', 'sense', 'life', 'earth', 'now', 'considering', 'knowledge', 'acquired', 'near-death', 'experience', 'Harry', 'fractured', 'life', 'becomes', 'refocused', 'when', 'Honey', 'Barbara', 'neophyte', 'call-girl', 'gifted', 'amateur', 'who', 'city', 'rain', 'forest', 'make', 'money', 'Barbara', 'beautiful', 'much', 'younger', 'Harry', 'bees', 'forest', 'passion', 'honey', 'Harry', 'new', 'found', 'love', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'former', 'life', 'now', 'useless', 'Harry', 'eventually', 'Honey', 'Barbara', 'rain', 'forest', 'remarkably', 'transformed', 'life', 'planting', 'trees', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'stubborn', 'Honey', 'Barbara', 'rain', 'forest', 'where', 'stage', 'set', 'love', 'letter', '8', 'years', 'be', 'delivered', 'What', 'will', 'remain', 'mystery', 'view', 'film', 'not', 'family', 'film', 'shallow', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'involving', 'circus', 'elephant', 'being', 'trained', 'sit', 'big', 'red', 'boxes', 'accidentally', 'Harry', 'red', 'Fiat', 'when', 'too', 'close', 'pachyderm', 'One', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'history', 'movie', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'brief', 'nudity', 'memorable', 'dialogue']",Bliss VHS
