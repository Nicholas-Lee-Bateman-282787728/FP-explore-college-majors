938551,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BB1534,A Customer,"[3, 4]","In this moving expose of man and his relationship with animals, filmmaker Judy Irving follows ex counter culture rock and roller Mark Bittner as he cares for a flock of wild, cherry-crowned parrots. Mark arrived in San Francisco sometime at the end of the hippie era with the illusion of becoming a rock musician.That was in the 1970s and he has been homeless and jobless since. Relying on the kindness of others - the owner of the local caf&eacute; gives him free coffee and food - Mark has eked out a life for himself in a shack on Nob Hill and has found his calling through the parrots he so lovingly adores.  He knows each bird by name and tends to those either ill or injured.Irving depicts a fascinating community of birds, including the feathered lovers Picasso and Sophie, the ailing Tupelo, and Mingus, a cantankerous conure who nests under the birdman's bed. There's also the flock's blue-crowned conure, Connor, a loner and outcast who symbolically mirrors Bittner. And the close-ups of the blinking parrots, with their bright green backs, red or blue heads and high-handed beaks, are indeed gorgeous.Picasso and Sophie have been partners for many years, breaking up occasionally when one gets mad at the other. Mingus has a nest in Bittner's small cottage. It's a mystery how these parrots got to San Francisco from their native South America - and there are various urban legends, which try to explain this - but Bittner knows four were the starters of the flock. By now all the birds have well and truly adapted to the colder climate of northern California.It is to the credit of Irving that she depicts Bittner as a sensitive thinking man and he draws some startling and very spiritual conclusions about our relationships with animals. The documentary also has a story to tell, and as such it builds up its drama. The owners of the cottage want to remodel, and Bittner must go. Connor is getting on in years and wobbly on his legs.In another director's hands, this documentary might have been a bit hackneyed and precious, but Irving's insightful and glorious up-close photography and her astute observations of this truly beautiful city reveals larger individual truths for her subject, whilst also exploring this fascinating society of unwanted parrots who seemed to have survived, and even thrived, against the odds.

There is much to recommend it:the lovely eccentric Mark Bittner; the gorgeousness of the City and the openness and generosity of those who live there; and most importantly the parrots themselves.If one has any doubts that animals are like us in so many ways, if we took the time to notice and care, this film dispells them. Mark approaches them with respect. He wins their trust with his authenticity and unwillingness to exploit them. Their personalities shine, distinctive and unique.If one has ever lost a beloved animal friend, he or she will relate to Mark's relaying of an experience of the feeling of emotions and telepathic connection with one of the birds at the time of death.

This is definitely an ""only in San Francisco"" sort of movie from many points of view.Late in the last millennium, Mark Bittner discovered that there are flocks of parrots in San Francisco which he calls wild, but which were probably released from capture. Urban legends as to their origins abound. He was squatting in an old cottage on Telegraph Hill, feeding and caring for these birds, naming them, talking to them, making friends with them, photographing them, writing about them, and loving them, until about 2005, when this movie was made.Judy Irving was a bird-lover who was also a photographer and filmmaker, and got to know Mark due to his interest in these parrots. Yes, the photography is stunning, and the birds are fascinating. But Mark and Judy are at least as interesting as the birds. Without giving away too much, early in the filming, Judy asks Mark why he doesn't cut his very long hair, and he says he decided he would not cut it until he had a girlfriend.

Like the more recent film, Telegraph Hill follows a particular group of birds in their ""natural"" habitat, which surprisingly is San Francisco.  Telegraph Hill also adds a human element in the form of Mark Bittner, the aimless and practically homeless aging hippie who becomes a de facto caregiver for the flock.Exactly how a group of tropical, wild parrots came to be living in populated San Francisco no one knows for sure, although the film features locals offering several different theories.  Clearly, the stars of this movie are the birds themselves, but caretaker Bittner does an excellent job of helping the view get to know the flock just as he did, a filmmaker Judy Irving wonderfully showcases the personalities of these beautiful creatures.Although the documentary comes in at just under 1 1/2 hours, the DVD offers plenty of bonus footage, including Mark Bittner's home movies, a more detailed history of the flock, deleted scenes, and an update on the flock's progress since the close of the film.

The story of Mark Bittner's journey to become the expert on and the caretaker of the flock of wild parrots of Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, while he avoids most of the appearances of being connected to society or to society's values along the way, certainly makes one wonder about the importance of some of the taken-for-granted symbols of success. The respect he earns for the study of the birds is a result of the intelligence, sensitivity, and acute observation skills he brings to his passion, while he wryly maintains a charmingly self-deprecating view of himself-- even if he DOES deny being eccentric. What's wrong with eccentric?It is a movie about the parrots as much as about Mark. If you can watch this movie and not be convinced of the individuality of the birds' personalities, then you are hopelessly anthropocentric. If you watch Mingus dance and are not convinced he's enjoying the music, or if Connor's story in no way moves you, then you may have become far too limited in your view of the world; a bird's eye view is certainly called for. This is a quirky and lovely story, lovingly told. I did not find the ending to be a surprise, as many did, but agree that it was uplifting.Congratulations to director Judy Irving.

938564,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000BB1534,Craig Matteson,"[3, 3]","This is not really a nature film.  While the parrots get top billing and are the ostensible reason for the movie, as we watch the film the reason we become interested in their story is because of the way Mark Bittner's obsession with the birds invites us to care.  We care because he is such a strangely interesting character.  Yes, he is a real person, but he is a very real character, too.He came to San Francisco in a bygone era hoping to be a musician.  After some modest success that avenue became closed and Mark became a street person.  There are few places on earth where being a street person is more viable than in San Francisco.  He talks a bit about his views of life and what he is trying to get to and why he wasn't ever meant for a career.  While most of us can sympathize with the notion that the cubicle life might not always be the most fun life choice, we would also be greatly puzzled at the Mr. Bittner's chosen life path.  But then again, when we get into the details of the lives of most of the people we meet we find much of it just as bewildering no matter how normal the surface of the life seems to be.A few years before the film opens he began living on Telegraph Hill (as he makes comments about not paying rent for many years and we see him inside an apartment, we have questions...) and became attached to the parrots that lived there.  Where did they come from?  What kind(s) are they?  Can he tell them apart?  What has he learned about them and how has he confirmed it?  Are they breeding?  And more.As he cares for the birds (even so, they are still wild birds), he explains what he knows and introduces us to some of them as individuals.  Of course, we become attached to them and root for them.  But life in the wild is quite demanding and even in San Francisco there are other natural creatures who prey on the parrots.  We even learn how they protect themselves when there are hawks around.  Quite fascinating.We slowly become aware of a necessary change in Mark's living arrangements and there is some concern about what will happen to the birds.  Most people make the leap that because Mark has been caring for them that they require his care.  He assures them that this not so.

938567,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B000BB1534,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[23, 55]","Warning! This review reveals the end of the movie. If you don't want to know how the movie ends, stop reading now!The buzz about ""Wild Parrots"" is that it is a heartwarming portrait of a gentle man's bittersweet love affair with beautiful parrots.Well, okay, if that's the movie you saw, great.The ""Wild Parrots"" I saw was disappointing.The least I expect from any filmmaker is honesty. If you use your camera to ferret out truths that most of us miss, and present those truths articulately and in an interesting way to others, you work deserves a showing, no matter its topic. I love birds and haven't much interest in sports and would rather watch an insightful sports documentary than a movie about birds that plays it safe and fudges its story.""Wild Parrots"" follows forty something San Franciscan Mark Bittner's relationship with a flock of feral parrots that live on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco. Bittner spends much of his time hand feeding the birds and observing their behavior. Bittner, who is of sound mind and body but declines to work, lives rent-free in a cottage owned by people who apparently do work.The documentary's drama comes when the cottage owners decide that they must renovate the cottage. Given how extensively it needs to be renovated, they ask Bittner to leave.Bittner is shown weeping on camera. He gives away Mingus, a parrot he had living in the cottage with him. He says goodbye to Conner, a lone member of a species that is different from the rest of the flock. Conner had never been able to find a mate (a hard thing for a parrot, as they are very social) and Bittner had performed some mate-like functions for Conner, for example grooming him.Mingus is sent to live in a facility for abandoned parrots, and lonely Conner, after appearing to mourn Bittner's departure, dies tragically.The movie wants us to believe that Bittner is being victimized by the couple who asked him to leave their cottage, where he had lived for years without paying any rent. The movie wants us to believe that Mingus and Conner's sad fate is all the fault of the evil landlords.Oh, baloney.Bittner makes it clear that he has long refused to work for a living, preferring what he calls a more ""spiritual"" and ""pure"" lifestyle. Jesus was a carpenter . . . but that kind of labor is not good enough for Mark Bittner.Bittner could have gotten a job, enabled himself to pay rent, moved to a new apartment, and taken Mingus with him. After Bittner was evicted, he was taken in by friends in the East Bay. He was a short public transportation ride away from the parrot flock. He could have easily continued to visit the wild parrots; Conner did not have to mourn him.I've lived in the Bay Area. I met many who didn't work, and who didn't pay rent. These folks often announced themselves as above such pedestrian concerns as, oh, paying money for the food they ate, or contributing to society through labor. These folks often sponged off of their parents and friends. They often disappointed their loved ones and children. Like Bittner, they always had quotes from Zen scriptures at the ready to make themselves sound deep.Maybe there is a good reason why Bittner could not work, or live up to his commitments even to a flock of birds. The film never explores that question, though. It accepts, without any curiosity, Bittner's self description as a man too spiritual to work. The filmmaker became lovers with Bittner. Even so, women have been able, in the past, to explore the truths, both the benign truths and the hard truths, of their lovers' lives. That's what art is for, even art about parrots.The film doesn't even look very hard at the parrots it captures in its frame. There are very difficult to watch scenes of parrots attacking an injured flock member. No theory is offered as to why this happens.Any film featuring footage of parrots, other birds, and the sun on San Francisco Bay can't be all bad; ""Wild Parrots"" is beautiful. I just wish ""Wild Parrots"" had had a little bit more courage, a tad more curiosity, and some honesty. If the film had been more probing, and more honest, about both Bittner and the parrots, I'm sure I would have liked him, the birds, and the film much more.",3,Take Your Pick: Warm & Cuddly or Disappointing & Dishonest,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,4207,"['Warning', 'review', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', 'buzz', 'Wild', 'Parrots', 'heartwarming', 'portrait', 'gentle', 'man', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'affair', 'beautiful', 'parrots.Well', 'okay', 'movie', 'saw', 'great.The', 'Wild', 'Parrots', 'saw', 'was', 'disappointing.The', 'least', 'expect', 'filmmaker', 'honesty', 'use', 'camera', 'ferret', 'out', 'truths', 'most', 'miss', 'present', 'truths', 'articulately', 'interesting', 'way', 'others', 'work', 'showing', 'matter', 'topic', 'love', 'birds', 'have', ""n't"", 'much', 'interest', 'sports', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'insightful', 'sports', 'documentary', 'movie', 'birds', 'safe', 'story', 'Wild', 'Parrots', 'forty', 'something', 'San', 'Franciscan', 'Mark', 'Bittner', 'relationship', 'flock', 'feral', 'parrots', 'live', 'Telegraph', 'Hill', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bittner', 'much', 'time', 'hand', 'feeding', 'birds', 'observing', 'behavior', 'Bittner', 'who', 'sound', 'mind', 'body', 'declines', 'work', 'rent-free', 'cottage', 'owned', 'people', 'who', 'apparently', 'do', 'work.The', 'documentary', 'drama', 'when', 'cottage', 'owners', 'decide', 'must', 'renovate', 'cottage', 'Given', 'how', 'extensively', 'be', 'renovated', 'ask', 'Bittner', 'leave.Bittner', 'shown', 'weeping', 'camera', 'away', 'Mingus', 'parrot', 'had', 'living', 'cottage', 'goodbye', 'Conner', 'lone', 'member', 'species', 'different', 'rest', 'flock', 'Conner', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'mate', 'hard', 'thing', 'parrot', 'are', 'very', 'social', 'Bittner', 'had', 'performed', 'mate-like', 'functions', 'Conner', 'example', 'grooming', 'him.Mingus', 'sent', 'live', 'facility', 'abandoned', 'parrots', 'lonely', 'Conner', 'appearing', 'mourn', 'Bittner', 'departure', 'tragically.The', 'movie', 'believe', 'Bittner', 'being', 'victimized', 'couple', 'who', 'asked', 'leave', 'cottage', 'where', 'had', 'lived', 'years', 'paying', 'rent', 'movie', 'believe', 'Mingus', 'Conner', 'sad', 'fate', 'fault', 'evil', 'landlords.Oh', 'baloney.Bittner', 'clear', 'long', 'refused', 'work', 'living', 'preferring', 'what', 'more', 'spiritual', 'pure', 'lifestyle', 'Jesus', 'was', 'carpenter', 'kind', 'labor', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'Mark', 'Bittner.Bittner', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'job', 'enabled', 'pay', 'rent', 'moved', 'new', 'apartment', 'taken', 'Mingus', 'Bittner', 'was', 'evicted', 'was', 'taken', 'friends', 'East', 'Bay', 'was', 'short', 'public', 'transportation', 'ride', 'away', 'parrot', 'flock', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'continued', 'visit', 'wild', 'parrots', 'Conner', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'mourn', 'him.I', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Bay', 'Area', 'met', 'many', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'rent', 'folks', 'often', 'announced', 'such', 'pedestrian', 'concerns', 'oh', 'paying', 'money', 'food', 'ate', 'contributing', 'society', 'labor', 'folks', 'often', 'sponged', 'parents', 'friends', 'often', 'disappointed', 'loved', 'ones', 'children', 'Bittner', 'always', 'had', 'quotes', 'Zen', 'scriptures', 'ready', 'make', 'sound', 'deep.Maybe', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Bittner', 'could', 'not', 'work', 'live', 'up', 'commitments', 'even', 'flock', 'birds', 'film', 'never', 'question', 'curiosity', 'Bittner', 'self', 'description', 'man', 'too', 'spiritual', 'work', 'filmmaker', 'became', 'lovers', 'Bittner', 'Even', 'so', 'women', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'past', 'explore', 'truths', 'benign', 'truths', 'hard', 'truths', 'lovers', 'lives', 'what', 'art', 'even', 'art', 'parrots.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'very', 'hard', 'parrots', 'frame', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'scenes', 'parrots', 'attacking', 'injured', 'flock', 'member', 'theory', 'offered', 'why', 'happens.Any', 'film', 'featuring', 'footage', 'parrots', 'other', 'birds', 'sun', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'Wild', 'Parrots', 'beautiful', 'just', 'wish', 'Wild', 'Parrots', 'had', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'courage', 'tad', 'more', 'curiosity', 'honesty', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'probing', 'more', 'honest', 'Bittner', 'parrots', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'birds', 'film', 'much', 'more']",N/A

938569,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000BB1534,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[29, 32]","This gentle documentary features Mark Bittner, an aging hippy and once-musician living in San Francisco, and the birds he loves, a flock of now-wild and breeding cherry-headed conures (and a few hangers-on) who reside in the city's trees.  Viewers who don't have experience with the intelligence and antics of the parrot family might approach this film the way one of the tourists does at the beginning when he says, ""If they have names, then they can't be wild.""  Viewers will soon understand the unique niche these parrots have forged for themselves in the urban environment.  Non-native and yet able to find food because of imported landscape plants, these birds swoop over the hills in a raucous flock and have become as much a part of San Francisco as the more numerous pigeons.Filmmaker Judy Irving captures Bittner's need to do right by the parrots with loving photography and soft-spoken questions.  When she asks her most pointed question, ""What is the difference between you and the pigeon lady?"", Bittner pauses for several beats before finally answering, with some pain, ""I don't know.""  But we do know by then.  His feeding the birds might not be any different but his curiosity about them and his drive to protect them distinguishes him.  Irving has managed to portray, through Bittner's interactions and thoughts about ""his"" flock, the individuality of the birds:  Mingus, an escaped conure who would rather live inside with Bittner than outside; Connor, the lonely blue-headed conure who inhabits the fringes of the cherry-headed society but who values his freedom over companionship; little nerve-damaged Sophie whose poignant devotion to her mate Picasso is heart-breaking; and, most touching of all, the cripple Tupelo who adores her trips into the garden while cradled in Bittner's hands.  When a city councilman reveals that some environmentalists wanted the birds captured and exterminated since they are considered invaders, viewers will be horrified since, unlike the environmentalists, they have come to know and love these birds.Irving provides context for the man/bird relationship through interviews with a lorikeet zookeeper at the San Francisco zoo, the locals who have their own theories about how the flock came to be, politicians, and tourists.  This film is not a hard-hitting documentary since it fails to fully explore the underlying conditions and politics of the situation.  Instead, it is a tribute to Bittner and the individual parrots he adopts as his friends.  Viewers who cannot get enough of the conures will be delighted with the DVD extras, several of which follow up on events.The film shows how right Bittner's fatalistic sixties' philosophy can be:  if something doesn't work out, then it wasn't meant to be.  You just have to wait for the right calling to come along.  In Bittner's case, he has become a champion not only of these conures but of animal right/intelligence in general. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5,For the Love of Birds,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,2958,"['gentle', 'documentary', 'features', 'Mark', 'Bittner', 'aging', 'hippy', 'once-musician', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'birds', 'flock', 'now-wild', 'breeding', 'cherry-headed', 'conures', 'few', 'hangers-on', 'who', 'reside', 'city', 'trees', 'Viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'intelligence', 'antics', 'parrot', 'family', 'might', 'approach', 'film', 'way', 'one', 'tourists', 'beginning', 'when', 'have', 'names', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'wild', 'Viewers', 'will', 'soon', 'understand', 'unique', 'niche', 'parrots', 'have', 'forged', 'urban', 'environment', 'Non-native', 'yet', 'able', 'find', 'food', 'imported', 'landscape', 'plants', 'birds', 'swoop', 'hills', 'raucous', 'flock', 'have', 'become', 'much', 'part', 'San', 'Francisco', 'more', 'numerous', 'pigeons.Filmmaker', 'Judy', 'Irving', 'Bittner', 'need', 'do', 'right', 'parrots', 'loving', 'photography', 'soft-spoken', 'questions', 'When', 'most', 'pointed', 'question', 'What', 'difference', 'pigeon', 'lady', 'Bittner', 'several', 'beats', 'finally', 'answering', 'pain', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'know', 'then', 'feeding', 'birds', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'different', 'curiosity', 'drive', 'protect', 'Irving', 'managed', 'portray', 'Bittner', 'interactions', 'thoughts', 'flock', 'individuality', 'birds', 'Mingus', 'escaped', 'conure', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'live', 'Bittner', 'outside', 'Connor', 'lonely', 'blue-headed', 'conure', 'who', 'fringes', 'cherry-headed', 'society', 'who', 'freedom', 'companionship', 'little', 'nerve-damaged', 'Sophie', 'poignant', 'devotion', 'mate', 'Picasso', 'heart-breaking', 'most', 'touching', 'cripple', 'Tupelo', 'who', 'trips', 'garden', 'cradled', 'Bittner', 'hands', 'When', 'city', 'councilman', 'environmentalists', 'wanted', 'birds', 'captured', 'exterminated', 'are', 'considered', 'invaders', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'horrified', 'environmentalists', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'birds.Irving', 'context', 'man/bird', 'relationship', 'interviews', 'lorikeet', 'zookeeper', 'San', 'Francisco', 'zoo', 'locals', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'theories', 'how', 'flock', 'came', 'be', 'politicians', 'tourists', 'film', 'not', 'hard-hitting', 'documentary', 'fully', 'explore', 'underlying', 'conditions', 'politics', 'situation', 'Instead', 'tribute', 'Bittner', 'individual', 'parrots', 'friends', 'Viewers', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'conures', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'DVD', 'extras', 'several', 'follow', 'up', 'events.The', 'film', 'how', 'right', 'Bittner', 'fatalistic', 'sixties', 'philosophy', 'can', 'be', 'something', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'right', 'calling', 'come', 'along', 'Bittner', 'case', 'become', 'champion', 'not', 'only', 'conures', 'animal', 'right/intelligence', 'general', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",N/A

In this movie, we have more than a documentary, we have some bordering on a real life soup opera with BOTH a human character and wild parrots sharing the limelight equally.  Mark Bittner is just as much a storyline in this film, as the parrots.  The interweaving between the two is quite interesting and as an added bonus must documentaries don't really entertain, but this one does.I saw The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill during its initial theatrical release and then again on DVD.  The extra features on the DVD are also quite interesting, and greatly add to the editted feature film version.  Unfortunately, these ""extras"" are probably not included in the downloadable version.  Then again, the cost of a downloaded is significantly less than the DVD at retail store prices.Regardless of version, we don't get to have a widescreen format in which to view this movie.  Make no mistake, this movie was made on a shoestring budget, but the results are surprisingly satisfying nevertheless.The birds' human benefactor, Mark Bittner is sort of upbeat spinoff of the Birdman of Alcataras.  He is really the star of this movie, and the roust-a-bout flock green parrots his on-off again sidekicks against the backdrop of the San Francisco urban landscape.  The cast of characters, all borderline homeless, are certainly not in any great despair, and in fact seem to happily coexistence and thrive from their apparent outcastness.In conclusion, this is a unusually entertaining ""documentary"" that will engage the viewer on several fronts, and does in fact have what can best be described as a ""surprise"" but certainly happy ending.

938577,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BB1534,Ed Uyeshima,"[11, 14]","At first, I wasn't terribly keen about seeing this documentary about a flock of wild South American parrots even though it takes place in my city, San Francisco. The trailer, which I saw in the movie theater earlier this year and is included as an extra in the DVD, made it seem like one of those quirky stories about a lonely eccentric who takes care of birds. However, now that I have seen it, I can say it is a genuinely beguiling, even uplifting film that will surprise you with its charm and poignancy. Over the course of 83 minutes, local documentary filmmaker Judy Irving accurately conveys the heart and soul of Mark Bittner, a middle-aged, pony-tailed hippie who found his calling over a decade ago in taking care of over forty of these colorful birds from his ramshackle cottage on Telegraph Hill.Bittner's story is familiar - having dreams of becoming a rock musician, he moved to San Francisco in the 1970's but could never find a job to suit his free spirit. He is not the stereotypical homeless slacker, at least as portrayed by Hollywood, but an eloquent, obviously sensitive man who doesn't easily share his feelings with others except with the parrots he has come to know and name. What Irving has done particularly well is not portray Bittner as a selfless savior of these birds but as a realist who respects the freedom the wild birds need and tend to them when they are ill or injured. In fact, according to a city official interviewed in the film, environmentalists want them removed, even destroyed, as they are not a native species.Bittner, on the other hand, knows how the birds have adapted naturally to the cold climate of Northern California and continue to thrive in such an anomalous, urban landscape. The film does not shy away from the tragedy inevitable with wildlife, namely predators like hawks who hover above the city and perhaps more destructively, the ignorance of humans. Bittner himself speaks candidly about the trap of anthropomorphism, i.e., attributing human characteristics to the parrots, especially given the all-too-human penchant to project feelings onto animals. This becomes challenging to the viewer as well since what stays in the memory are the beautiful close-ups of the parrots and their obviously loving interactions with him. The birds - among them, Mingus, Pushkin, Tupelo, Picasso, Sophie - have individual stories that indeed humanize them to some degree, and the most interesting is the plight of Connor, the only blue-crown parrot among the cherry-crowns and consequently the resident outsider.What makes the film so noteworthy, however, is the fact that contrived sentimentality is averted in favor of a more journalistic approach to this highly personal story. The chief example of this is when the film documents a challenging development - the property owners have to evict Bittner from the cottage as part of a major renovation. Instead of being portrayed as villains, the obviously well-to-do owners are shown to be good, realistic people who have allowed Bittner to stay on the property for three years without rent. Irving also provides a lot of nice contextual touches with shots of Bittner in North Beach, the dramatic visual and audio contrast between the parrots and the soaring Blue Angels, and interviews with people who share ""urban legends"" about the origin of the parrots. I particularly like the establishing shot of the film when a particularly cynical inquisitor questions Bittner about how wild the parrots could be since they interact so easily with him. Irving and Bittner should be rightly proud of this heartfelt film.The DVD package has loads of extras targeted to those enthralled by Bittner's story, including most importantly, a seven-minute update on the parrots. There are seven deleted scenes, all understandably excised, but they nonetheless provide additional insight into Bittner's story as well as the parrots themselves. One interesting excerpt is a 14-minute interview with a woman who took care of the flock prior to Bittner and illustrating how the birds drew people from different walks of life. Four shorts are also included - a more in-depth profile of Connor, a follow-up report on Mingus at the Oasis Sanctuary in Phoenix, a featurette on California quails in the Presidio, and almost half an hour of Bittner's own home movies, which I assume is the basis of the film. There is even a music video of pianist-vocalist Roberta Fabiano signing a forlorn paean to the parrots, ""Dogen, Connor and Tupelo"".",5,"A Heartfelt, Often Enthralling Look at the Birdman of Telegraph Hill",1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,4508,"['first', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'keen', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'flock', 'wild', 'South', 'American', 'parrots', 'even', 'place', 'city', 'San', 'Francisco', 'trailer', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'earlier', 'year', 'included', 'extra', 'DVD', 'made', 'seem', 'one', 'quirky', 'stories', 'lonely', 'eccentric', 'who', 'care', 'birds', 'However', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'can', 'say', 'genuinely', 'beguiling', 'even', 'uplifting', 'film', 'will', 'surprise', 'charm', 'poignancy', 'course', '83', 'minutes', 'local', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Judy', 'Irving', 'accurately', 'conveys', 'heart', 'soul', 'Mark', 'Bittner', 'middle-aged', 'pony-tailed', 'hippie', 'who', 'found', 'calling', 'over', 'decade', 'ago', 'taking', 'care', 'forty', 'colorful', 'birds', 'ramshackle', 'cottage', 'Telegraph', 'Hill.Bittner', 'story', 'familiar', 'having', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'rock', 'musician', 'moved', 'San', 'Francisco', '1970', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'job', 'suit', 'free', 'spirit', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'homeless', 'slacker', 'least', 'portrayed', 'Hollywood', 'eloquent', 'obviously', 'sensitive', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'easily', 'share', 'feelings', 'others', 'parrots', 'come', 'know', 'name', 'What', 'Irving', 'done', 'particularly', 'well', 'not', 'portray', 'Bittner', 'selfless', 'savior', 'birds', 'realist', 'who', 'freedom', 'wild', 'birds', 'need', 'tend', 'when', 'are', 'ill', 'injured', 'fact', 'according', 'city', 'official', 'interviewed', 'film', 'environmentalists', 'want', 'removed', 'even', 'destroyed', 'are', 'not', 'native', 'species.Bittner', 'other', 'hand', 'how', 'birds', 'have', 'adapted', 'naturally', 'cold', 'climate', 'Northern', 'California', 'continue', 'thrive', 'such', 'anomalous', 'urban', 'landscape', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'tragedy', 'inevitable', 'wildlife', 'namely', 'predators', 'hawks', 'who', 'hover', 'city', 'perhaps', 'more', 'destructively', 'ignorance', 'humans', 'Bittner', 'candidly', 'trap', 'anthropomorphism', 'i.e.', 'attributing', 'human', 'characteristics', 'parrots', 'especially', 'given', 'all-too-human', 'penchant', 'project', 'feelings', 'animals', 'challenging', 'viewer', 'well', 'what', 'memory', 'are', 'beautiful', 'close-ups', 'parrots', 'obviously', 'loving', 'interactions', 'birds', 'Mingus', 'Pushkin', 'Tupelo', 'Picasso', 'Sophie', 'have', 'individual', 'stories', 'indeed', 'humanize', 'degree', 'most', 'interesting', 'plight', 'Connor', 'only', 'blue-crown', 'parrot', 'cherry-crowns', 'consequently', 'resident', 'film', 'so', 'noteworthy', 'however', 'fact', 'contrived', 'sentimentality', 'averted', 'favor', 'more', 'journalistic', 'approach', 'highly', 'personal', 'story', 'chief', 'example', 'when', 'film', 'documents', 'challenging', 'development', 'property', 'owners', 'have', 'evict', 'Bittner', 'cottage', 'part', 'major', 'renovation', 'Instead', 'being', 'portrayed', 'villains', 'obviously', 'well-to-do', 'owners', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'good', 'realistic', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'allowed', 'Bittner', 'stay', 'property', 'three', 'years', 'rent', 'Irving', 'also', 'lot', 'nice', 'contextual', 'touches', 'shots', 'Bittner', 'North', 'Beach', 'dramatic', 'visual', 'audio', 'contrast', 'parrots', 'soaring', 'Blue', 'Angels', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'share', 'urban', 'legends', 'origin', 'parrots', 'particularly', 'establishing', 'shot', 'film', 'when', 'particularly', 'cynical', 'inquisitor', 'questions', 'Bittner', 'how', 'wild', 'parrots', 'could', 'be', 'interact', 'so', 'easily', 'Irving', 'Bittner', 'should', 'be', 'rightly', 'proud', 'heartfelt', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'loads', 'extras', 'targeted', 'enthralled', 'Bittner', 'story', 'including', 'most', 'importantly', 'seven-minute', 'update', 'parrots', 'are', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'understandably', 'excised', 'nonetheless', 'provide', 'additional', 'insight', 'Bittner', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'parrots', 'One', 'interesting', 'excerpt', '14-minute', 'interview', 'woman', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'flock', 'prior', 'Bittner', 'illustrating', 'how', 'birds', 'drew', 'people', 'different', 'walks', 'life', 'Four', 'shorts', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'more', 'in-depth', 'profile', 'Connor', 'follow-up', 'report', 'Mingus', 'Oasis', 'Sanctuary', 'Phoenix', 'featurette', 'California', 'quails', 'Presidio', 'almost', 'hour', 'Bittner', 'own', 'home', 'movies', 'assume', 'basis', 'film', 'even', 'music', 'video', 'pianist-vocalist', 'Roberta', 'Fabiano', 'signing', 'forlorn', 'paean', 'parrots', 'Dogen', 'Connor', 'Tupelo']",N/A

His own evolution from bemused observer to someone who truly loves the birds and appreciates them as individuals is fascinating, and as persuasive evidence for animal consciousness (for those who still feel the need for such evidence) as anything I've seen.

For years he has cared for this flock of birds, not out of necessity for the flock, but out of a desire to simply care for them. As one man comments, Mr. Bittner is a modern day St. Francis of Assissi.This is an odd topic for a documentary. It isn't about parrots in their native South America. It isn't about a homeless man. It's about a man with no job who cares for and studies a flock of non-native conures living in and around Telegraph Hill in San Francisco.Surprisingly, we are priviledged to meet Mr. Bittner and see that he has been fortunate enough to have people on Telegraph Hill (which is one of the most expensive locations in San Francisco) not only allow him to ""squat"" in a guest house on their property, but they pay for his electricity and other utilities...all in the name of upholding the unique character of San Francisco and as a nod toward his work with the parrots.Birds definitely have personality and this movie lets us see that.

The book was subtitled,"" A Love Story--With Wings"". It was considered a memoir, but soon it propelled Bittner into a shaft of international prominence as an ""amateur"" expert on Conures. Then it became a documentary film produced and directed by the activist environmentalist filmmaker-Judy Irving.Irving wrote,"" At first glance, Mark didn't seem like a natural ""movie star"". Yes, the green and red parrots flying around him were exotic and feisty-but Mark, himself was-well, a quiet long-haired hippie recluse living in a shack. I also wondered how much of a story there was in a guy just feeding birds.""Bittner does have an interesting presence on film. His centered soul, his kindness, openness and unrestricted ability to love-all came through. A man who spent 25 years in San Francisco without a real job-never paying rent-he must have been very resourceful. After he started feeding the Conures-and had gained their trust-people started noticing him and the parrots. He became known as the St. Francis of Telegraph Hill. Studying Zen and looking for the big answers to existence-Bittner discovered that his relationship with the Conures provided him everything he needed-focus, meaning, love, tragedy, and total interest.He gave all the parrots names-and Irving found a way to film them where their individual personalities shined through. The message of the picture-it seems to me-is that ""love"" is the common denominator for all things throbbing in the universe.

This while drawing out - and capturing - a lot of emotion about the birds and their plight.Director Judy Irving is also deceptively dramatic in her storytelling, in that a few of the sub-stories which at first come across as simple documentary commentary eventually result in somewhat tearful moments.  (For whether they are ""good"" tears or ""bad"" tears, you'll have to see it yourself.)  In any case, it's very talented storytelling.This also shows a fun, odd little aspect of San Francisco I hadn't heard about -- the lifestyle on Telegraph Hill.  So much of Bittner's life there for the past several years made me smile with appreciation in kind of a ""only in San Francisco"" way.  He seems like an extremely likeable guy, and you've got to love him for what he did for the parrots.Lastly, I also highly recommend this if you have a child.  It's not cartoonish or Disney-esque at all, but it does do a very nice job of showing the benefits of having a healthy respect and appreciation for animals.  Be warned that it's not 100% happy-go-lucky for the birds, so you may want to preview it to gauge your child's reactions.

Opening sequences of parrot caretaker, Mark Bittern, answering tourist's questions as they stroll through Telegraph Hill in San Fransisco, as if it was a zoo, and as if he was an employee of the city, are friendly and amusing introductiions to both the birds and Bittern, who becomes as much a documented study; an unemployed and somewhat aimless man who seems to have found his life's calling in caring for the birds. When the camera goes inside his apartment, which serves as a parrot hospital, the parrots take on a clown-like personae, with one appearing to really rock-out with the beat of a song Bittern plays on his guitar. Bittern, who at one time struggled to be a musician, plays a nice guitar and has a good singing voice, and the folk guitar heard throughout the film is an accomplished pleasurable score. Through the course of the filming we see a change in Bittern, he seems to have aged slightly, his frisky nature seems to be winding down to an exhaustion, as late in the film, he is passively evicted from his rent-free home, which is conveniently close to the parrot population.One feels he has run himself ragged caring for the birds and accomodating the filmmakers. This makes the undeniably happy ending all the more agreeable. There are few, if any, detailed studies of the behavior of surviving non-native escaped birds, and Bittern's notes become a definitive scientific study, even though his objectivity may be in question, with an absolute passion for the birds.The film morphs between the studies of the man and the parrots, and the incidental conclusion, left me a bit undone, with questions lingering regarding the bird's history and future, like how long has the population been existant, and what threat, if any, do they pose to native species?

Picht,"[5, 6]","Animal documentaries often fall prey to sloppy sentimentality and shameless pandering to people who hate ""development"" (often a poorly defined concept that involves people who enjoy destroying animals and trees even when there's no profit in it - the bad guys in the old ""Captain Planet"" cartoons). Because I have a soft spot in my heart for animals, I watch them anyway and hate myself afterward. I didn't hate myself at all after watching this one. It's a bit sentimental, but never sloppy, and it makes of its subject something akin to a hero without ever pandering.I bought this movie because I thought my children (ages three and five) might enjoy the images of birds and be entertained. They did and they were, but the older one was also deeply interested in what happened to the human subject of the film (Mark Bittner), not just the birds. To my surprise, I also was engrossed and moved by both. The parrots are individually as interesting as any human character in your typical Hollywood entertainment, and Mr. Bittner is as engaging as any animal star. Together, they are superb.This is a documentary; there's no plot, no story arc. Even so, it has its narratives and a definite flow. It builds to a dramatic climax, and it resolves in a way that's both surprising and satisfying. As must any animal documentary, it has its tragedy, but that tragedy saddened me and my children without making us feel psychologically manipulated and abused. Throughout, the film is infused with humor that is uplifting and joyful.I loath sentiment (I'm an economist - it's unlikely that I even have a human heart unless I keep one in a bottle by my bed for a late-night snack), but at a couple of points during this film my eyes got strangely moist. That almost never happens to me and I find it disconcerting, but when the movie was over I found that I had tender feelings for small birds (I usually favor raptors) and aging San Francisco hippies (I usually feel about them as Eric Cartman does). Unlike Mr. Bittner, I don't think of parrots as people, but this film shows them to be wonderfully engrossing animals, as deserving of admiration and kindness as any of God's creations.

I remember vividly looking up and seeing the flock of parrots cavorting about as they made a big racket in the trees.  It was really an amazing and unexpected sight in the middle of the city, and yet one more little piece of the mosaic that makes San Francisco such a special place.This documentary captures the parrots and their human benefactor in great detail.  Mark Bittner is beyond just a quirky guy who happens to love these birds.  It also documents his Buddhist/zen view of himself and life and how his relationship with the birds changes his self perception and outlook.  In addition to the story about Bittner and the birds, the viewer gets to see a part of San Francisco that you might otherwise miss.You feel the sadness when Bittner is no longer able to take care of the birds and one of the main bird characters dies shortly after.If there's a small complaint, the film arguably occasionally suffers from a lack of pacing, but the surprise ending is great.In case you're wondering about the flock, I can tell you that I was in San Francisco again recently, and the parrots are alive and well.

Even though he spends nearly all of his waking hours caring for a flock of San Francisco's wild parrots, he downplays his true interest in the animals, afraid that his strong affection will cause him to be labeled as an eccentric.  But his fear of being known as one doesn't stop him from feeding the wild parrots of Telegraph Hill everyday, letting the large flock of birds (more than two dozen) perch on his shoulders, his arms, and his head.  Bittner cares for San Francisco's wild parrots as a teacher might care for a rowdy class of young students; he looks for any problems the parrots are having-if they are hungry, sad, happy-and caters to their needs, letting injured parrots stay in his house, letting reticent parrots keep their distance.  He treats his parrots as equals and works to understand the parrot's feelings in human terms.Were Mark Bittner's charming camera presence and admirable sympathy and care for the parrots the main focus of ""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill,"" the film would be an interesting documentary on how strongly people can become attached to animals.  However, Bittner is only the costar of the film; the real focus is on the parrots themselves.  When the movie begins, we see different shots of the parrots flying around San Francisco, moving through downtown, passing by the Golden Gate Bridge, landing on trees, and being fed by Mark.  As the movie progresses, we become attached to the parrots in a way that Mark Bittner is attached.  We learn the names of some of the parrots, and we get to know their history: whether the parrot has had a mate, how old he/she is, and  how long the parrot has been with the flock.  One of the most interesting parrots, named Connor, reminded me of a wise but embittered old man living with a group of young college kids, annoyed that he's surrounded by yippy, less intelligent parrots, but happy he has a group that accepts him.  Another parrot, named Sophie, acts flirtatious and needy, snuggling up to a couple different mates throughout the movie.  It's easy to see why  Mark utilizes anthropomorphism to help explain the parrot's feelings; the scrutinizing camera supports Mark's claims that certain parrots become moody or angry.""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill"" treats its two main subjects with great care and admiration.  Mark Bittner, obviously slightly eccentric whether he can admit it or not, is never used for the audience's derisive entertainment, and the parrots are given more time in front of the camera than any human in the film.

It's a little disjointed at times, jumping around to all kinds of side topics and discussions, but that sort of contributed to its appeal: ""The Parrots of Telegraph Hill"" has a homemade, constructed on the fly feel, kind of like Mark Bittner's apartment in the film.  That is, both the movie and the apartment aren't very polished or organized, but they're both designed with love of the parrots in mind.  In any event, everything in the film is fascinating, funny, moving, interesting, or a combination of those things.  And that's what's important.DVD is really the way to experience this movie, as, after it's over, one can have the instant gratification of going through the many extra features to get immediate updates on the people and birds featured in the film.  Though the film was officially a 2004 release, it must have taken quite a while to film and then a while longer to get into theaters, as some of the ""update"" sections in the special features take place fully five years after the events depicted in the film.  So you get some nice, detailed updates, including seeing Mark visiting the birds he had to say goodbye to at the end of the movie.  Those reunion scenes are really something.I'm a fan of documentaries because they're something different from the same old action film or comedy, and most of them clock in at a painless hour and a half or so.

This short movie is an engaging profile of the Bird Man of San Fran and his love of feathered wild things.  A few reactions and comments:Humans tend to anthropomorphize animals.  We project onto them emotions and motivations that we feel ourselves.  This may or may not be justified.  Does a parrot ""grieve"" over its lost mate?  Does it feel love for a human?  Who knows?  We all do it, but is it justified or does it really make for a better story line?No comment is made about the introduction of this non-native parrot species on the local ecosystem.  It presumes as a given that the preservation and survival of these non-native parrots is a good thing, and maybe it is.  However, it would be interesting to hear from an ecologist on the issue.The film should have been underwritten by the San Francisco Tourist Bureau, not because it is a propaganda piece but because the movie is a lovely postcard to the beauty of this city by the Bay.

When that dream failed him he lived on the street, taking odd jobs and exploring Eastern religions.While living on Telegraph Hill as a caretaker, he began to notice a growing flock of wild parrots in the area. His interest in the flock grew into a passion and he befriended the birds, naming and characterizing them in his field notes.This passion led him to write about the parrots. His bookThe Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill: A Love Story . . .with Wingswas published in 2004.The fascinating documentary ""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill"" was released at the same time. Filmmaker Judy Irving translated Mark's passion and knowledge into astonishing footage that easily differentiates the birds and illustrates their personalities -- Connor, the odd-bird-out, a blue-crowned parrot in the country of the cherry-headed. Sophie, tenderly devoted to her mate Picasso. Mingus, the jokester. These and other birds come to life in Judy's award-winning film.Mark also comes to life. Not trained in ornithology but completely devoted to the welfare of the flock, his eccentricity is acknowledged but not emphasized. You WILL be surprised at the ending of this film. Bring tissues for the crying, but expect to leave with a smile.The independent theater in a nearby town showed ""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill"" last year as a fund-raiser for the Audubon Society.

A friend of mine saw the whole flock as he was driving down Columbus Avenue.So, Wild Parrots is a great documentary where Mark Bittner has shown us the personalities of these different birds, and documented their trials, their dysfunctional love lives, and the dangerous lives they lead.In this presentation of a great and compelling story, its possible to recognise our own humanity in the lives of these birds, and to feel a strong sense of wonder at how this movie came to be made.  Its also a great love story for the main character, and I was truly impressed with the quality of this movie and have recommended it to numerous people.If you have friends who love wildlife documentaries, they will definitely love this movie.As in many movies about San Francisco, the city itself becomes a character in the movie.I trust you find this helpful.",5,"Pieces of eight, pieces of eight!",1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,1198,"['more', 'interesting', 'wildlife', 'San', 'Francisco', 'might', 'imagine.I', 'vividly', 'remember', 'going', 'movie', 'San', 'Francisco', 'week', 'later', 'walking', 'block', 'Embarcadero', 'Cinema', 'hear', 'tremendous', 'squawking', 'sound', 'trees', 'look', 'up', 'see', 'parrots', 'flying', 'block', 'away', 'where', 'saw', 'movie', 'friend', 'mine', 'saw', 'whole', 'flock', 'was', 'driving', 'down', 'Columbus', 'Avenue.So', 'Wild', 'Parrots', 'great', 'documentary', 'where', 'Mark', 'Bittner', 'shown', 'personalities', 'different', 'birds', 'documented', 'trials', 'dysfunctional', 'love', 'lives', 'dangerous', 'lives', 'lead.In', 'presentation', 'great', 'compelling', 'story', 'possible', 'recognise', 'own', 'humanity', 'lives', 'birds', 'feel', 'strong', 'sense', 'wonder', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'be', 'made', 'also', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'truly', 'impressed', 'quality', 'movie', 'have', 'recommended', 'numerous', 'people.If', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'love', 'wildlife', 'documentaries', 'will', 'definitely', 'love', 'movie.As', 'many', 'movies', 'San', 'Francisco', 'city', 'character', 'movie.I', 'trust', 'find', 'helpful']",N/A

Sherwin,"[3, 3]","The Wild Parrots Of Telegraph Hill is an outstanding documentary about a bohemian ex-musician who gradually befriends a flock of wild parrots in the Telegraph Hill section of San Francisco. During the film's eighty-three minutes you are never once bored; Judy Irving directs this loving story with sensitivity, realism and a lot of heart and admiration for Mark Bittner, the man who makes friends with the parrots.We get Mark's story mostly through Mark himself--Judy Irving films him studying the birds and feeding them as he talks to the camera about how the birds gradually came to trust him. We also learn how they loved to be fed by him as he held out birdseed in his hands. I was especially touched by how Mark Bittner gives names to several of the most outstanding members of the bird flock and we learn about the birds as Mark also tells us what he discovered by watching them through binoculars and up-close, too.Mark Bittner is especially caring and protective of the birds even if he doesn't admit to it directly; he takes sick birds inside his small home so that he can help them recuperate or be with them as they die from illness or old age. That's very moving.Through Mark we meet Connor, the blue headed parrot who is the outcast of the flock because he has blue feathers on his head instead of red features; and we meet Sophie and Picasso, two love birds (no pun intended) who eventually become separated when Picasso mysteriously stops showing up at mealtimes. Sophie mourns the loss of Picasso and the close-up shots of them cuddling are adorable.Eventually Mark must move out of his cottage when extensive renovations have to be made; and what happens to the flock when he is no longer there for him? Will they be helpless or will they be able to fend for themselves? Will other people in Mark's neighborhood take over the responsibilities of feeding the parrots? Watch the movie and find out! And yes, we DO get a surprise ending--a very happy one indeed!The DVD comes with quite a few extras; and this impresses me. We get an ""update"" on the flock and we also get almost a half-hour of Mark's own home movies of the birds. There are deleted scenes and urban legends about the flock and its origins. There is a more serious short about the possible origin of the flock as well; and the update of a bird named Mingus at a safe haven in Arizona called The Oasis is very well done.The Wild Parrots Of Telegraph Hill is a documentary of an unusual but extremely touching, true story of how one man established a unique loving relationship with a rather wild flock of parrots. I even shed a few tears when Mark had to leave his home so they could renovate it!

This film by Judy Irving begins later in Bittner's relationship with the birds and ends sooner than the book, which covers more time and goes into more depth in describing the individual birds' personalities. You don't need to have read the book to understand the film, though. Anyone who loves parrots will enjoy seeing the characters among San Francisco's wild flock. But I think the book does increase the audience's appreciation of the flock and Bittner's role in helping them along. If you have read the book, it is extraordinary to see the birds in action in this film, which includes a lot of colorful footage of these playful, vivacious parrots.As the film starts, the flock numbers about 45 birds, cherry-headed conures plus one blue-crowned conure, Conner, and an occasional budgie. It ends around the time Mark Bittner moved away from Telegraph Hill due to renovations. In addition to observing the flock, we hear Bittner recount his life in San Francisco as a bohemian drifter in search of direction, which he finally found in the unlikely form of a flock of displaced parrots. Bittner does most of the talking about the parrots, through interviews and voice-over narration. There are also interviews with his Telegraph Hill neighbors, the curator of birds at San Francisco's Lorikeet Aviary, John Aiken, and a host of people speculating on the flock's origins. By the film's end, the flock included a mitred conure and hybrid offspring, and it's unclear to me how many birds it numbered. But the flock included around 160 birds by the time this DVD was finished.It's incredible to see these birds living and thriving in an urban environment, feeding on fellow non-natives: the subtropical plants imported for landscaping. Judy Irving has captured some of the most engaging footage of parrots that I've ever seen on film. And this film adds some value to Mark Bittner's book beyond visuals: Bittner comes across as less reclusive and eccentric than he did in his book. And I got a much stronger sense of Conner's plight, as the flock's regal, thoughtful outsider, from the film than I did from the book, which I really appreciated. ""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill"" is a vivid account of some very out-of-place parrots who have made a place for themselves in an urban jungle filled with humans and other oddities. A great film for bird-lovers -and take a look at the book too, if you can.The DVD (New Video Group 2005): This DVD is loaded with extras as long as the film itself, and you won't want to miss them if you're interested in the origins of the flock, updates on the flock, or just want to see more parrot pictures. There is a ""Flock Update"" (7 min), containing info on the birds and Mark's move back to Telegraph Hill, which I believe is in the book but not the movie. There are 7 deleted scenes (25 min) available, including a long sequence, ""Flock Origins"" (14 min), on the early days of the flock, in which Laurel Wroten recounts her observations of how 2 apparently escaped cherry-headed conures became 7 and then were joined by Conner and his blue-crowned mate. This ends a lot of speculation about how the flock began. There are 4 short films (51 min) about Conner, Mingus' life at the Oasis Sanctuary, and ""Mark's Home Movies"", which include a lot of footage of birds discussed in the book. There is a Music Video (4 min) of a song about Dojen, Conner, and Tupelo, recorded by Roberta Fabiano. Also: a theatrical trailer (2 min), ""Filmmaker Bio"" (text), ""About the Book"" (text), including how to order a signed copy, ""About the Soundtrack"" (how to order), ""About Pelican Media"" (where to get t-shirts and other movie paraphernalia), and DVD credits.

As Mark finds his way, he must leave the warmth of his feathered home.  Like all children, young or old, he must stike out and make his own way.  And he does.

938613,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000BB1534,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","An inherently interesting, funny and beautiful story told from a HIGHLY subjective point-of-view, THE WILD PARROTS OF TELEGRAPH HILL is a documentary for all ages, and would actually make an excellent introduction to the form for younger children.  I say that, because I remember many years ago bringing home a documentary for my young daughter and her friends to watch (SPELLBOUND) and they were frankly puzzled as to what a documentary could be.  (We've since cleared that up.)WILD PARROTS follows the life of Mark Bittner, a middle-aged ""failed"" musician who many years before had moved to San Francisco's Beat / Hippie neighborhoods to make his way as a musician.  He failed at that, and never really settled into a normal career either.  Years on the streets, and then years squatting in a small rental cottage that didn't belong to him brought him in contact with a flock of Cherry-headed Conures that lived in the neighborhood.  The flock, which probably started as a tiny handful of released pets, but flourished in the nice weather, fascinated Bittner, and over time, he became something of their caretaker, or at least, their studier and (perhaps) their friends.  Each day revolves around the feeding of this flock, which over the years have come to know him extremely well.  Tourists and locals alike come to see Bittner relate with his feathered buddies.Some might call Bittner a bum.  Others would call him a ""free spirit.""  There's no doubt that he is a thoughtful and well-spoken man...a aged hippie with long hair and a scraggly beard.  He clearly loves his charges...yet as he freely admits early on, they would do just fine without him.  While he does personally take care of a few injured birds in his little home...the flock as a whole would thrive even if he wasn't around.  His primary contribution is as their ardent observer.  He knows each bird by sight, and has carefully studied their behaviors, particularly the ins-and-outs of their couplings.  He has a genuine love for the birds...no one could ever question that.  He's gentle with them, calls them by name, is endlessly patient with them...and for the few he's been forced to raise indoors, he's even a ""father.""  But with those few exceptions...he hasn't saved the birds...but they've probably saved him.  They've given his life its own meaning...they defined his career.  Bittner is self-aware enough to understand this, and he takes the gift they've given him pretty seriously.But the movie certainly spends the heart of its time following the parrots.  It focuses on a few key ""characters,"" and there is NO doubt that these birds are fascinating and engaging to follow.  They are beautiful little creatures, and it is so easy to anthropomorphize them.  Bittner believes they have feelings, and it's hard to argue with him.  There is certainly little doubt that the birds are quite clever and that they all develop distinct ""personalities.""  I found myself thoroughly engaged with them in a most childlike way.  I love animals, and movies like this give such a rare glimpse of them in beautiful close-up.  (This DVD is ripe for an HD upgrade...hope it happens sometime.)So for 83 minutes, I was quite entranced.  (And the lengthy bonus materials are pretty good too.)  Bittner and his friends made good company.  But as a documentary, I had a couple of problems.  First of all, the filmmaker finds virtually no fault in this eccentric man or the things he says about the birds.  They don't need him for their survival, and one could question if his interacting with them might actually put them in danger.  Yet early on, one spectator questions Bittner rather pointedly and raises some very valid questions...but the film treats this guy as a kook.  No one in the film really has anything bad to say about Bittner, and even the environmental questions about the dangers of ""non-native"" species are glossed over quickly.  The film is really taking a glowing look at Bittner and his work...it is not an impassive, objective work.  It doesn't dig deep.  You really only get one side of the story.  By no means am I saying that Bittner is actually a villain...he's seemingly quite upfront about his feelings and attitudes.  But I was a little troubled by the clearly biased view of the documentarian.  And just to support that, there's a little surprise at the very end of the film that proves that bias.  It's a nice surprise, no doubt, but it left me pretty convinced that what I had seen was a lovingly done, beautifully entertaining fluff piece.  Not a true documentary.Nonetheless, you'll have a great time and you'll find yourself smiling for much of the film, and even shedding a tear or two.  It's rated G, and would probably be great for anyone aged 11 or up.  A great example of  ""something for the whole family.""",5,"Not exactly an objective, hard-hitting piece...but delightfully engaging!",1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,4804,"['inherently', 'interesting', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'story', 'told', 'HIGHLY', 'subjective', 'point-of-view', 'THE', 'WILD', 'PARROTS', 'OF', 'TELEGRAPH', 'HILL', 'documentary', 'ages', 'would', 'actually', 'make', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'form', 'younger', 'children', 'say', 'remember', 'many', 'years', 'bringing', 'home', 'documentary', 'young', 'daughter', 'friends', 'watch', 'SPELLBOUND', 'were', 'frankly', 'puzzled', 'what', 'documentary', 'could', 'be', ""'ve"", 'cleared', 'up', 'WILD', 'PARROTS', 'life', 'Mark', 'Bittner', 'middle-aged', 'failed', 'musician', 'who', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'moved', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Beat', '/', 'Hippie', 'neighborhoods', 'make', 'way', 'musician', 'failed', 'never', 'really', 'settled', 'normal', 'career', 'Years', 'streets', 'then', 'years', 'squatting', 'small', 'rental', 'cottage', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'brought', 'contact', 'flock', 'Cherry-headed', 'Conures', 'lived', 'neighborhood', 'flock', 'probably', 'started', 'tiny', 'handful', 'released', 'pets', 'flourished', 'nice', 'weather', 'fascinated', 'Bittner', 'time', 'became', 'something', 'caretaker', 'least', 'studier', 'perhaps', 'friends', 'day', 'feeding', 'flock', 'years', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'extremely', 'well', 'Tourists', 'locals', 'alike', 'come', 'see', 'Bittner', 'relate', 'feathered', 'buddies.Some', 'might', 'call', 'Bittner', 'bum', 'Others', 'would', 'call', 'free', 'spirit', 'doubt', 'thoughtful', 'well-spoken', 'man', 'aged', 'hippie', 'long', 'hair', 'scraggly', 'beard', 'clearly', 'charges', 'yet', 'freely', 'early', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'personally', 'take', 'care', 'few', 'injured', 'birds', 'little', 'home', 'flock', 'whole', 'would', 'thrive', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'primary', 'contribution', 'ardent', 'observer', 'bird', 'sight', 'carefully', 'studied', 'behaviors', 'particularly', 'ins-and-outs', 'couplings', 'genuine', 'love', 'birds', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'question', 'gentle', 'name', 'endlessly', 'patient', 'few', 'been', 'forced', 'raise', 'indoors', 'even', 'father', 'few', 'exceptions', ""n't"", 'saved', 'birds', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'saved', ""'ve"", 'given', 'life', 'own', 'meaning', 'defined', 'career', 'Bittner', 'self-aware', 'enough', 'understand', 'gift', ""'ve"", 'given', 'pretty', 'seriously.But', 'movie', 'certainly', 'heart', 'time', 'following', 'parrots', 'few', 'key', 'characters', 'NO', 'doubt', 'birds', 'are', 'fascinating', 'engaging', 'follow', 'are', 'beautiful', 'little', 'creatures', 'so', 'easy', 'anthropomorphize', 'Bittner', 'have', 'feelings', 'hard', 'argue', 'certainly', 'little', 'doubt', 'birds', 'are', 'quite', 'clever', 'develop', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'found', 'thoroughly', 'engaged', 'most', 'childlike', 'way', 'love', 'animals', 'movies', 'give', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'beautiful', 'close-up', 'DVD', 'ripe', 'HD', 'upgrade', 'hope', 'sometime', 'So', '83', 'minutes', 'was', 'quite', 'entranced', 'lengthy', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Bittner', 'friends', 'made', 'good', 'company', 'documentary', 'had', 'couple', 'problems', 'First', 'all', 'filmmaker', 'virtually', 'fault', 'eccentric', 'man', 'things', 'birds', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'survival', 'one', 'could', 'question', 'interacting', 'might', 'actually', 'put', 'danger', 'early', 'one', 'spectator', 'questions', 'Bittner', 'rather', 'pointedly', 'very', 'valid', 'questions', 'film', 'guy', 'kook', 'one', 'film', 'really', 'anything', 'bad', 'say', 'Bittner', 'even', 'environmental', 'questions', 'dangers', 'non-native', 'species', 'are', 'glossed', 'quickly', 'film', 'really', 'taking', 'glowing', 'look', 'Bittner', 'work', 'not', 'impassive', 'objective', 'work', ""n't"", 'dig', 'deep', 'really', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'side', 'story', 'means', 'am', 'saying', 'Bittner', 'actually', 'villain', 'seemingly', 'quite', 'upfront', 'feelings', 'attitudes', 'was', 'little', 'troubled', 'clearly', 'biased', 'view', 'documentarian', 'just', 'support', 'little', 'surprise', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'bias', 'nice', 'surprise', 'doubt', 'left', 'pretty', 'convinced', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'lovingly', 'done', 'beautifully', 'entertaining', 'fluff', 'piece', 'Not', 'true', 'documentary.Nonetheless', ""'ll"", 'have', 'great', 'time', ""'ll"", 'find', 'smiling', 'much', 'film', 'even', 'shedding', 'tear', 'two', 'rated', 'G', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'anyone', 'aged', '11', 'up', 'great', 'example', 'something', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

He finds himself as much of a tourist focus as the parrots.

Second, the photography (Judy Irving) is exceptional, and you will sense very quickly that these parrots are individuals, with unique ""personalities.""  And third, you will mull over the relationship between people and animals.  These parrots are exotics (cherry-headed and blue-crowned conures)!  Should they be encouraged to stay, or eliminated as pests?  Should Bittner be encouraged to tame these ""wild"" birds... indeed, are they to be considered wild?  And what is our responsibility, as individuals and as a community, to protect the parrots from predation, hunger, and disease?

This can be a cruel fate for these animals, who most often can't survive more than a few weeks, if they're lucky.  If they're birds, they join up with those birds who have escaped.  Every once in a while, these released/escaped animals can survive, and even thrive, in the wild.And so it is for the parrots of San Francisco.  Filmmaker Judy Irving, according to published interviews at the website for the film, had heard from several people about these colorful parrots (cherry-headed conures from Peru) that had naturalized in San Francisco, far from their home.  Years later, she decided to look into these birds, and started filming them, little knowing that an award-winning documentary would come out of it.Mark Bittner was living on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco.  He wondered about these unlikely denizens of the Bay Area.  Being tropical birds, how could they survive in the temperate San Francisco?  He worried about them, and decided that he would be their human protector.  Along the way, he became very attached to the parrots, naming them and keeping track of their comings and goings.  Some of the parrots would come into his house to feed.It's a sweet film.  Irving, the filmmaker, enters into the film at times, as she gets to know Mark.  There is drama when Mark is threatened with losing his free house.  One will have to watch the film to see how it is resolved.Highly recommended.

938624,AK61LQI92GTCH,B000BB1534,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[3, 14]","Pleasant enough documentary that lovingly profiles bohemian author Mark Bittner and the feral parrots of the Telegraph Hill area of San Francisco.  There's an awful lot of footage of Bittner feeding the birds, and, the great strength of this movie, Bittner telling anecdotes about and the personal histories of the parrots he'd befriended.  This dvd includes a lot of nice extras - deleted scenes, some follow-up scenes on a couple of the parrots - most particularly Connor, who disappeared from the flock (we find out what happened to him) and a follow-up visit with Mingus, the clown, who was given to a bird shelter.Many people will find this one of those life-affirming films whose after glow lasts a long time.  If so, more power to you.  If you're looking for something beyond a profile of a somewhat eccentric bird-lover, though, this will prove unsatisfying.  For one thing, there's little beyond some inconclusive urban legend scenes speculating on how these South American parrots made it to San Francisco in the first place.  It's not vital to the story, but these parrots were probably intended for the domestic pet market.  The fact that these birds are easily domesticated played around in the back of my head while watching this movie, and seriously cut into the awe I might otherwise have felt for a movie profiling someone who befriended them.  That Bittner had the time - three-plus 24/7 years - brought up another issue.  Telegraph Hill isn't the cheapest neighborhood in this country, and how Bittner was able to live there rent-free for years is a testament to the usually unsung generosity so rampant in this country today.  Unfortunately, the couple who provided housing for Bittner come across a little miserly when they evict him when their home is going to undergo a major renovation.  The movie doesn't at all try to paint them that way, I hasten to add, but that's the effect.  Even though this is a loving profile, rather than another kind of documentary, there still should have been more attention given to the issue of invasive foreign species.  The parrots aren't native to San Francisco, and the movie leads us to believe their effect on the area is benign.  That may well be the case, but the short scene of a city council meeting (Bittner testified at the hearing) has a councilman telling the camera some local conservationists advocated eradicating the parrots.  It was an intriguing road of inquiry not taken, and the hole it left in the story was frustrating.I'm not a bird fancier, and I'm usually pretty immune to movies that others find inspiring.

He manages to get an apartment in San Francisco without paying any rent to his kind-hearted landlords. He does nothing to fix up the place, and squats there for years. By some quirk of fate that is not researched by the wastrel, or the makers of this movie, there are wild parrots living nearby on Telegraph Hill. The wastrel decides to appoint himself caretaker of the parrots. He feeds them with what is probably donated food, since I can't imagine he pays for anything. To make a long story short, his landlords finally manage to evict him from his free living space, he moves across town to freeload off of some unfortunate friends, and the favorite parrot dies, because the wastrel is too lazy to commute across town to continue caring for the birds. It is not an uplifting story, as some reviewers seem to believe.
