Still, this series makes you feel like you're really there.  I gained insights into mountain climbing, mountain climbers and especially the psychology of Everest climbers.  Such insights are interesting and valuable in understanding the best of human nature.I particularly liked the story line about the firefighter that didn't summit; his process of self-realization as that occurred and after, taught us much about how to view the world.",5,Feels like you're there!,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,546,"['Tremendously', 'great', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'mountain', 'climber', 'due', 'age', 'disability', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'one', 'Still', 'series', 'feel', ""'re"", 'really', 'there', 'gained', 'insights', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'especially', 'psychology', 'Everest', 'climbers', 'Such', 'insights', 'are', 'interesting', 'valuable', 'understanding', 'best', 'human', 'nature.I', 'particularly', 'liked', 'story', 'line', 'firefighter', 'did', ""n't"", 'summit', 'process', 'self-realization', 'occurred', 'taught', 'much', 'how', 'view', 'world']",Everest: Beyond the Limit - Season 1
