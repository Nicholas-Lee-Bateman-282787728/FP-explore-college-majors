The real Stalin does not appear in this sometimes facile, oftentimes inaccurate biography of the Russian dictator. Originally airing as an HBO TV movie, there are an abundance of errors in the script, as well as a host of other problems.First, the make-up is amateurish and truly detracts from the viewing experience. Duvall's mustache is a clear paste-on job and in several scenes, the left side of the whiskers almost falls off his face. It's comical at times but ultimately becomes ludicrous in the extreme. His wig is also absurd and fake looking. While this might seem a minor criticism, the make up on the other chief characters is equally ridiculous and cheap. The costumes are also inaccurate in many instances. The color of Stalin's uniform at Yalta in 1944 was not yellow, the color of his uniform at Postsdam in 1945 was not blue!The historical inaccuracies in the movie are continuous. The characteizations are facile, transparent and weak. Of course Stalin was evil incarnate and a paranoid schizophrenic, but the script doesn't bother to delve into the question of why this was so. There is little material about either of his two wives, or his children. All of that is glossed over. Another silly aspect are the abysmal accents that all of the actorsThe only reason I give this a generous rating of 3 is because Duvall is a brilliant actor. Though horribly miscast (and made up to resemble more of a circus clown that Stalin), his acting abilities do shine through.

This film turns this on its head saying that Stalin was bad, but he was surrounded by good people.  Both of these are wrong--the leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution and the leaders of the USSR in the period following the revolution were all up to their necks in blood.  Robert Duvall gives an excellent portrayal of Stalin, emphasizing that he, unlike his ranting partner in mass murder Hitler, was soft-spoken and basically uncharismatic.  Duvall correctly does not use a ""Russian"" accented English because Stalin spoke Russian with a heavy Georgian accent.  Having said this, the historical aspects of the film are very poor.  First of all, Maximilian Schell's portrayal of Lenin is way off base.  The Old Bolsheviks like Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Ordzhonikidze and Kirov are shown to be basically well-meaning people who got trapped in Stalin's web.  This is untrue, they were all involved in mass terror, justifying it in the name of a ""higher good"".  In Solzhenitsyn's ""Gulag Archipelago"", he points out what a pathetic man Bukharin really was and how he so freely shed tears for the injustice committed to his person, and yet he had no pity on the millions of others who suffered.  At the end of the film, Khruschev says that Stalin's crimes (""the millions"" he liquidated) had to be accounted for, whereas,in reality,  he himself took an active role in the Great Terror.The film shows very little of what the effect of ""Stalinism"" was on the average Soviet citizen, with the exception of a scene where Stalin's wife confronts the effects of the mass famine in the Ukraine.  The film does not really show the ""cult of the personality"".  It would have been effective if the film had shown how, when Stalin would enter a hall full of people, the crowd would applaud for a very long time because everyone was afraid to be the first to stop clapping.  Similarly, towards the end of the film, we see a physician nervously examining Stalin without any mention of the infamous ""Doctors Plot"" frame-up in which Jewish doctors were falsely accused of trying to murder top Soviet officials which would explain the physicians hesitancy in examing his famous patient.In spite of the many faults of this film, I have still given it three stars rating because it is important for people to become aware of what this monster did to so many millions of innocent people and who was supported by millions of otherwise good people, both inside and outside the USSR.",3,"Good Characterization of Stalin, Bad History",1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,2595,"['past', 'apologists', 'Stalin', 'including', 'many', 'victims', 'said', 'Stalin', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'surrounded', 'bad', 'people', 'film', 'head', 'saying', 'Stalin', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'surrounded', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'wrong', 'leaders', 'Bolshevik', 'Revolution', 'leaders', 'USSR', 'period', 'following', 'revolution', 'were', 'up', 'necks', 'blood', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Stalin', 'emphasizing', 'ranting', 'partner', 'mass', 'murder', 'Hitler', 'was', 'soft-spoken', 'basically', 'uncharismatic', 'Duvall', 'correctly', 'not', 'use', 'Russian', 'accented', 'English', 'Stalin', 'spoke', 'Russian', 'heavy', 'Georgian', 'accent', 'Having', 'said', 'historical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'First', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'portrayal', 'Lenin', 'way', 'base', 'Old', 'Bolsheviks', 'Trotsky', 'Kamenev', 'Zinoviev', 'Bukharin', 'Ordzhonikidze', 'Kirov', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'basically', 'well-meaning', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'trapped', 'Stalin', 'web', 'untrue', 'were', 'involved', 'mass', 'terror', 'justifying', 'name', 'higher', 'good', 'Solzhenitsyn', 'Gulag', 'Archipelago', 'out', 'what', 'pathetic', 'man', 'Bukharin', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'so', 'freely', 'shed', 'tears', 'injustice', 'committed', 'person', 'yet', 'had', 'pity', 'millions', 'others', 'who', 'suffered', 'end', 'film', 'Khruschev', 'Stalin', 'crimes', 'millions', 'liquidated', 'had', 'be', 'accounted', 'whereas', 'reality', 'took', 'active', 'role', 'Great', 'Terror.The', 'film', 'shows', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'effect', 'Stalinism', 'was', 'average', 'Soviet', 'citizen', 'exception', 'scene', 'where', 'Stalin', 'wife', 'effects', 'mass', 'famine', 'Ukraine', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'show', 'cult', 'personality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'film', 'had', 'shown', 'how', 'when', 'Stalin', 'would', 'enter', 'hall', 'full', 'people', 'crowd', 'would', 'applaud', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'everyone', 'was', 'afraid', 'be', 'first', 'stop', 'clapping', 'Similarly', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'physician', 'nervously', 'examining', 'Stalin', 'mention', 'infamous', 'Doctors', 'Plot', 'frame-up', 'Jewish', 'doctors', 'were', 'falsely', 'accused', 'trying', 'murder', 'top', 'Soviet', 'officials', 'would', 'explain', 'physicians', 'hesitancy', 'examing', 'famous', 'patient.In', 'spite', 'many', 'faults', 'film', 'have', 'still', 'given', 'three', 'stars', 'rating', 'important', 'people', 'become', 'aware', 'what', 'monster', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'millions', 'innocent', 'people', 'who', 'was', 'supported', 'millions', 'otherwise', 'good', 'people', 'USSR']",Stalin VHS

He looked as if he was unhappy doing this role and came off as too calm when in real life Stalin was an emotional paranoid person that would probably have a scream match with Nadya if given the chance.  He just did nothing for me at all, he's a better actor than that!2.They tried to create a one-sided issue to make Stalin look like the only jerk in the relationship between him and his second wife Nadya.  It got to the point where Julie Ormond came off as the villain in the relationship because she was nagging at Stalin to the point where I almost felt badly for him instead of her.  For me Julie is a better actress than this, its as if she had no idea how to portray a woman who hates her husband and loves him at the same time.  In actuality Nadya was a mentally unstable woman even before she married him, and when he found this out after he married her...he lost all of his patience and trust for her.  Of course he doesn't trust her, why would anyone trust their woman when they're yelling at you like a maniac and trying to make you feel guilty!3.They got the plot wrong!a)Nadya was actually at the dinner party on the anniversary of the Revolution, she did not just come into town.  And when Stalin threw his cigarette butt at her he was trying to get her attention because he thought that she was being disrespectful for not raising her glass.b)Yes Stalin probably slept with some other woman on the night that Nadya shot and killed herself, but nobody knows that for sure.  Also it was probably with a wife of a comrade, not a Georgian dancer.  Anyways, he went off with her to her apparment, Stalin did not actually return to the Kremlin until the next day, by that time he was told and not showed that his wife was dead.c)Nadya already knew before Stalin married her that Stalin was widowed and he had Yakov from his first wife.d)It was Molotov's wife Polina who was Nadya's best friend, not Zhenya, Zhenya was her sister-in-law.  It was to Polina that she confessed in real life that she was tired of Stalin and the children.e)Yes Stalin was anti-Semitic, but also keep in mind that Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew and was glad to help Stalin out killing other Jews and so on forth.4.Yes the scenery was beautiful and made me want to go to Russia all the more.5.Last but not least, I just could not watch the rest of the movie, because all these conferences that Stalin was at with his henchmen board me to death!

Stalin was the most brutal dictator of the 20th century and Duvall does a good job of showing what a callous man Stalin was. Note: Contrary to popular belief, Stalin killed far more people than Hitler did--app. 50 million to 25 million. While this film doesn't dwell on Stalin's atrocities, it does give the viewer a good insight as to how Stalin operated and how he came to power.Although ""Stalin"" is well-acted and well-produced, it does have its shortcomings. For one thing, I found the movie to be a bit long and as the movie winds down, it loses some of its interest. Also, the casting for the roles of Khruschev and Bukharin could've been a lot better. The guy who plays Khruschev sounds more like an Irishman than a Ukrainian and Jerome Krabbe is clearly miscast in the role of Nikolai Bukharin. For one thing, Bukharin was an older man who had a striking resemblance to Lenin. Here, Krabbe looks and acts like a member of the Moscow State Circus.All in all, ""Stalin"" is a good movie but it should not be relied upon as a serious historical film.
