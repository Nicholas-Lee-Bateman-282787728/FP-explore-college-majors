304354,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,630225678X,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","Over the years this episode has really grown on me. At first I did not like it because there were just way too many unanswered questions, like: How do the inscriptions suddenly write themselves on a crypt wall? Why are the Doctor and Fenric bound by that chess game? Why is Millington doing what he's doing (Aside From His Military Duties)? Most importantly, how was it that Ace could not recognize her own Grandmother? Even assuming she (Grandmother) had passed before Ace was born, why was the name not familiar to her like the name of her Mother? That is a major plot hole. Not to mention Millington's bizzare orders to destroy all the chess sets along with the radios! I get a general idea why, but others might not, and to not explain it in the script leaves another question unanswered.But I liked the supporting characters. The Vicar, Captain Sorin, the British Marines, the soldiers from the USSR. Those Russians were an elite group of men if there ever were any! It's too bad they were decimated in the end. The death of the Vicar and Captain Sorin, the two supporting characters I liked and cared for make this episode a bit dark. However, I feel The Curse of Fenric would have been better served had it held nothing back and made the episode a true horrorfest. That means most of the scenes should have been filmed either at dawn, dusk and at night, leaving us frightened and truly fearful as to what would happen next. While the Haemovores were a bit gaudy, and I have to say again they would have been better served being shown at night like when they pursued the Russian soldiers.To paraphrase Rob Matthews from the website pagefillers.com: ""Filmed in less than three weeks, I think this is an amazing piece of television. Absolutely amazing, and it's a fantastic tribute to director Nicholas Mallett that we can see it in full at last.""The 2-Disc DVD I have has the episode that was originally broadcast and one that has new scenes and a Director's discussion as to how the production was set up. This is quite informative, I must say. I liked this episode, and I bought it because it had extra scenes included and was basically the unedited version which I've always coveted. This DVD was the first DVD I ever purchased of the original Doctor Who series. I'm not disappointed with this DVD; nor will any true fan of the show.

Sylvester McCoy, as the Seventh Doctor, is clearly a fine actor, but, in this case, he was given a weak script to draw from.While the show is not known to be exceptionally complex politically, here, it tries to be. As the Cold War was winding down, apparently the writers thought they would try to push a cliche British-Russian post-war friendliness. The message is inoffensive, but it is presented so syrupy and unbelievable.Characters here are more cookie-cutter than usual, with an old maid, innocent soldiers, and an obsessive leader.Implausibility continues as various victims do not run from the Haemovores who slowly approach in zombie-like manner. In fact, it is so zombie-like, there is a direct allusion to ""Night of the Living Dead"" when they are trapped in a building.Included here is an obvious plotline of her meeting her mother while she was still a baby.I wanted to like this more than I do, and my overall love for the series is probably why I give it as high marks as I have.

304358,ABBEL5QDVTZ7R,630225678X,Connor,"[2, 3]","I've got a soft spot for the 7th Doctor's era indeed. Beginning my Who journey in the 21st century, I decided in the lapse between series 5 and series 6, I would watch some old Who, try it out. I started off on Netflix and watched Ghost Light and The Curse of Fenric. I loved both and eventually saw all 12 of the Seventh Doctor's adventures. While they ranged from far and few between, many were cracking, and this one is no exception- in fact, it's his best outing!I don't know why people have maligned this story on Amazon. It ranked 30 out of 200 on the mighty DWM 200. That's a got thing btw. And it's fantastic to boot.The story is very complicated (which could garner some fair complaints) but rewarding if you understand it, and it may take several views too. The story is about a group of British Soldiers who have become wary about the Russians and have tricked them by making a device known as an encoder which will actually end up poisoning them and destroying Moscow with the high level poison the British people are mining in the costal town. An ancient entity is awoken amidst the chaos and creatures that are the warning and the future of the biowarfare and the victims of a terrible curse emerge from the sea. Meanwhile, Ace begins to suspect the Doctor is up to many tricks, and he isn't explaining anything.The plot is very complicated, I won't lie. However, the DVD includes a movie-length version with 12 minutes of deleted scenes put back into it which helps the story to breathe and plays just like a movie. By far the best special feature out of many great ones.The Curse of Fenric is strong for many reasons. The story is original and very smart (a tad confusing, yes). Cartmel's plan is beginning to show and we learn more about Ace in the 2nd entry of the Ace Trilogy. Mark Ayres' score is suitably eerie, the acting is brilliant, and the special effects are good. The best part is easily the location work and Nicholas Mallett's brilliant direction. It lends the story an authentic feel and the production values haven't been so high in a while.Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the 4 part broadcast version is pale in comparison to the movie, but the movie is the price of admission really and should the real reason to own this DVD. This is easily McCoy's best story, dark, creepy, and well-acted.

304359,A11GO5VA74HD8K,630225678X,Crazy Fox,"[9, 10]","""The Curse of Fenric"" tries so hard to be a quintessential Doctor Who story. Pseudo-historical tales are a hallmark of the show, and this one is set at a British naval base during World War II but features an extraterrestrial (extradimensional?) threat very much true to form. Like some of the most beloved classics especially from the early seasons of Tom Baker, ""Fenric"" takes classic and cliche motifs from known horror movies and translates them into a science fiction idiom, in this case any number of ""living dead"" type movies like ""Evil Dead II"" or ""Prince of Darkness"" (to name the ones I've actually seen, not being a big fan of horror films myself): the emergence into our world of a demonic being through some sort of activating text and/or ritual, his bringing an army of zombies or vampires to bear against the heroes, surrounding them in a frail safehold and besieging them there, and yes, we even have the poor ill-fated priest who ineffectually waves a Bible or cross at the creepies only to be promptly overtaken by them. ""Fenric"" also features an ecological undertone similar to many of the greats from Jon Pertwee's time (especially ""Inferno"") as the zombies are in fact a badly mutated version of humanity from some polluted industrial meltdown of a future. Then too there's a Cold War fable a la ""The Armageddon Factor"" (among others) as the Russian and British soldiers decide to stop their clandestine maneuvers against each other so as to fight their common enemy, evil itself (originally airing in 1989, this may well be one of the last of its kind). Why, with the final chess game between Fenric and the Doctor, there's even a whiff of ""The Celestial Toymaker"" from way back.And yet it all comes across as trying too hard. Knowing in retrospect that this is the next-to-last story in the show's classic run it may be too easy to say this, but it almost seems as if the producer and his staff are attempting to jumpstart the waning popularity of Doctor Who by haphazardly throwing in everything that ever worked--missing the basics in the process. First of all, they left out the heart: The spirit of fun and adventure just seems to be missing, and the combination of quintessential elements seems artificial and contrived rather than natural and creative. Second of all, they forgot the brain: once again as with ""Ghost Light"" a fledgling writer is doing his best but not apparently getting the direction and feedback he needs from the script editor. As a whole the story is far more coherent, thank goodness, but there are still far too many fuzzy points, plotline tangles, and sheer implausibilities for a final draft--and overall the horror-to-sci-fi translation is incomplete and unripe, with too many things a trifle too supernatural and unscientific for the Doctor Who fictional universe. Finally, they lost their courage: the story bends over backwards painfully to cast the Soviet soldiers in a good light while vilifying the Brits--to the degree that it winds up as an embarrassing display of self-persecution. If only they'd had a wonderful wizard to consult with on these matters.Still, for all that, ""The Curse of Fenric"" is reasonably enjoyable and entertaining, and it has its moments. This is the BBC, so the historical sets and costumes are top-notch. Having the believably clunky British decryption computer summon forth Fenric by spitting out an English translation of his cursed verses from Norse is clever. McCoy does great as the Doctor, and at one point rambles off a quick summary of what must be Time Lord Theology (and Theodicy) which is rather interesting and convincingly abstract. The way he bumbles in and somehow makes himself at home in a top secret naval base really is classic Doctor Who, utterly uncontrived. And the story as a whole nicely and intriguingly thematizes faith and doubt, giving it more multilayered texture than the average monster movie. All of this makes ""Fenric"" worth watching despite its flawed nature, but none of it justifies making this a double-DVD set by including a director's cut version of the same story over again.",3,"""We hoped to return to the North Way, but the dark curse follows our dragon ship.""",1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,4104,"['Curse', 'Fenric', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'quintessential', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', 'Pseudo-historical', 'tales', 'are', 'hallmark', 'show', 'one', 'set', 'British', 'naval', 'base', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'extraterrestrial', 'extradimensional', 'threat', 'very', 'much', 'true', 'form', 'most', 'beloved', 'classics', 'especially', 'early', 'seasons', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Fenric', 'classic', 'cliche', 'motifs', 'known', 'horror', 'movies', 'science', 'fiction', 'idiom', 'case', 'number', 'living', 'dead', 'type', 'movies', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'II', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'name', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'seen', 'not', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'emergence', 'world', 'demonic', 'being', 'sort', 'activating', 'text', 'and/or', 'ritual', 'bringing', 'army', 'zombies', 'vampires', 'bear', 'heroes', 'surrounding', 'frail', 'safehold', 'besieging', 'there', 'yes', 'even', 'have', 'poor', 'ill-fated', 'priest', 'who', 'ineffectually', 'Bible', 'cross', 'creepies', 'only', 'be', 'promptly', 'overtaken', 'Fenric', 'also', 'ecological', 'undertone', 'similar', 'many', 'greats', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'time', 'especially', 'Inferno', 'zombies', 'are', 'fact', 'badly', 'mutated', 'version', 'humanity', 'polluted', 'industrial', 'meltdown', 'future', 'Then', 'too', 'Cold', 'War', 'fable', 'la', 'Armageddon', 'Factor', 'others', 'Russian', 'British', 'soldiers', 'decide', 'stop', 'clandestine', 'maneuvers', 'other', 'so', 'fight', 'common', 'enemy', 'evil', 'originally', 'airing', '1989', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'kind', 'Why', 'final', 'chess', 'game', 'Fenric', 'Doctor', 'even', 'whiff', 'Celestial', 'Toymaker', 'way', 'back.And', 'yet', 'across', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'Knowing', 'retrospect', 'next-to-last', 'story', 'show', 'classic', 'run', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'say', 'almost', 'producer', 'staff', 'are', 'attempting', 'jumpstart', 'waning', 'popularity', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'haphazardly', 'throwing', 'everything', 'ever', 'worked', 'missing', 'basics', 'process', 'First', 'left', 'out', 'heart', 'spirit', 'fun', 'adventure', 'just', 'be', 'missing', 'combination', 'quintessential', 'elements', 'artificial', 'contrived', 'rather', 'natural', 'creative', 'Second', 'forgot', 'brain', 'once', 'again', 'Ghost', 'Light', 'fledgling', 'writer', 'doing', 'best', 'not', 'apparently', 'getting', 'direction', 'feedback', 'script', 'editor', 'whole', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'coherent', 'thank', 'goodness', 'are', 'still', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'fuzzy', 'points', 'plotline', 'tangles', 'sheer', 'implausibilities', 'final', 'draft', 'overall', 'horror-to-sci-fi', 'translation', 'incomplete', 'unripe', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'trifle', 'too', 'supernatural', 'unscientific', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fictional', 'universe', 'Finally', 'lost', 'courage', 'story', 'backwards', 'painfully', 'cast', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'good', 'light', 'vilifying', 'Brits', 'degree', 'up', 'embarrassing', 'display', 'self-persecution', 'only', ""'d"", 'had', 'wonderful', 'wizard', 'consult', 'matters.Still', 'Curse', 'Fenric', 'reasonably', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'BBC', 'historical', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Having', 'believably', 'clunky', 'British', 'decryption', 'computer', 'summon', 'forth', 'Fenric', 'spitting', 'out', 'English', 'translation', 'cursed', 'verses', 'Norse', 'clever', 'McCoy', 'great', 'Doctor', 'one', 'point', 'quick', 'summary', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'Time', 'Lord', 'Theology', 'Theodicy', 'rather', 'interesting', 'convincingly', 'abstract', 'way', 'somehow', 'home', 'top', 'secret', 'naval', 'base', 'really', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'utterly', 'uncontrived', 'story', 'whole', 'nicely', 'intriguingly', 'faith', 'doubt', 'giving', 'more', 'multilayered', 'texture', 'average', 'monster', 'movie', 'Fenric', 'worth', 'watching', 'flawed', 'nature', 'none', 'making', 'double-DVD', 'set', 'including', 'director', 'cut', 'version', 'same', 'story', 'again']",Doctor Who - The Curse of Fenric VHS

Then about a week ago or so, I rewatched it on the internet, and it was just as good as I remembered. A very spooky and eerie story about an evil entity rising once again in a small English village off the coast of Britain during World War II. This adventure is excellently directed creating a scary atmosphere. Some great momments include the dead Russian soldier under the water opening his eyes, the two girls in the water after they have been turned into Haemovores, the two girls attacking their step-mother, the army of Haemovores rising from the water and walking towards the church in the grave yard, the part where the Doctor, Ace, and the Vicker are trapped in the church and trying to keep the Haemovores out, and part three's cliffhanger ending where we see the first appearance of Fenric. It's got great performances in it, lot of good and scary parts, plus a lot of action on the side of that.This DVD includes both the original four-part version of the story plus a new extended feature-length version with newly added CGI effects and a new sound mix which greatly improove this story which was great to begin with. The extended version also includes an added scary part that wasn't featured in the original where two soldiers run into an army of Haemovores in a dark tunnel.A great adventure that combines ""Doctor Who"" with ""Steven King's Salem's Lot"", and does a very good job at scarying you.

304367,A2KWJ1TZC6C60P,630225678X,John Kane,"[3, 6]","I bought this episode because it got a high review on a Doctor Who online poll. In fact in that poll done a few years ago it was the highest rated story with Sylvester McCoy's Doctor. I was disappointed big time. I know anything is possible in science fiction, but I prefer stories that have a certain scientific plausability to them. Or failing that to at least have some explanation for the methods used by the Doctor to save the earth and the universe.The writer claims that the 3rd episode was meant to be chaous and confusion so that you could almost watch the scenes in a random order. In my opinion the entire story is so unexplained and jumps around that you could also watch the episodes in any order and not lose much. So much is left for the viewer to fill in that I found myself rewriting the story in my own mind. The Doctors final solution seems to be magical and not based on science at all which gives the series a high degree of unbelievability. I never really get the sense that tthe doctor is aver truly in any danger which makes the whole plot fall down.On the plus side, the extras give a nice behind the scene look at the filming of this episode. The extended version adds about 15 more minutes but does not help add to the plot. This story needed to be a 6 parter due to the complexity of the plot and they likely had almost enough unused film to make it so. I think the story was well concieved but the final product after editing is just a bunch of clips mashed together and seems more like a rough draft than a finished product.A point of interest is that this series was filmed entirely on location during rapidly changing weather. Most of the time it was raining and other times it was sunny. Because the scenes were filmed out of sequence, the director thought it necessary to hire a water truck and use a hose to sprinkle water in the scenes when it wasn't raining. This was done to try to keep the continuity in scenes that followed each other in the show but were filmed under different weather conditions. The thing is though, when it was actually raining you can see the ground was wet but the camera does not actually pick up the falling rain. Then when they use the water truck you could see huge drops of water but instead of falling straight down, first they come from one direction and a while late they fall from a different direction, all while the set is completely sunny. So after all that extra work, nothing was really gained by it.From what I have read, on location filming was expensive and was used very limited in Doctor Who because of budget constraints. Not only was this entire show filmed on location but it also had some under water filming. My impression is that because of this they likely had less retakes shot and were more apt to use the first take. At certain times there were high winds causing further sound trouble. There are a couple scenes where I have rewound to try to make out what Ace was saying, but even after listening several times I can't understand her.One of the extras on the film appears shows the writer and some of the cast answering questions at a convention. Since I didn't care for the show, I found this a bit annoying because the writer carrys on like he has just created a top rated movie or something special.There is another separate interview of the writer where he explains what he was trying to convey, and the background to the charactors. This does help but it shouldn't be necessary if the script was better.",2,Cut & Paste Story seems like a Rough Draft Script,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,3502,"['bought', 'episode', 'got', 'high', 'review', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'online', 'poll', 'fact', 'poll', 'done', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'highest', 'rated', 'story', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Doctor', 'was', 'disappointed', 'big', 'time', 'know', 'anything', 'possible', 'science', 'fiction', 'prefer', 'stories', 'have', 'certain', 'scientific', 'plausability', 'failing', 'least', 'have', 'explanation', 'methods', 'used', 'Doctor', 'save', 'earth', 'universe.The', 'writer', 'claims', '3rd', 'episode', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'chaous', 'confusion', 'so', 'could', 'almost', 'watch', 'scenes', 'random', 'order', 'opinion', 'entire', 'story', 'so', 'unexplained', 'jumps', 'could', 'also', 'watch', 'episodes', 'order', 'not', 'lose', 'much', 'So', 'much', 'left', 'viewer', 'fill', 'found', 'rewriting', 'story', 'own', 'mind', 'Doctors', 'final', 'solution', 'be', 'magical', 'not', 'based', 'science', 'series', 'high', 'degree', 'unbelievability', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'tthe', 'doctor', 'aver', 'truly', 'danger', 'whole', 'plot', 'fall', 'plus', 'side', 'extras', 'give', 'nice', 'scene', 'look', 'filming', 'episode', 'extended', 'version', '15', 'more', 'minutes', 'not', 'help', 'add', 'plot', 'story', 'needed', 'be', '6', 'parter', 'due', 'complexity', 'plot', 'likely', 'had', 'almost', 'enough', 'unused', 'film', 'make', 'so', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'concieved', 'final', 'product', 'editing', 'just', 'bunch', 'clips', 'mashed', 'together', 'more', 'rough', 'draft', 'finished', 'product.A', 'point', 'interest', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'location', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'weather', 'Most', 'time', 'was', 'raining', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'sunny', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'sequence', 'director', 'thought', 'necessary', 'hire', 'water', 'truck', 'use', 'hose', 'sprinkle', 'water', 'scenes', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'raining', 'was', 'done', 'try', 'keep', 'continuity', 'scenes', 'followed', 'other', 'show', 'were', 'filmed', 'different', 'weather', 'conditions', 'thing', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'raining', 'can', 'see', 'ground', 'was', 'wet', 'camera', 'not', 'actually', 'pick', 'up', 'falling', 'rain', 'Then', 'when', 'use', 'water', 'truck', 'could', 'see', 'huge', 'drops', 'water', 'instead', 'falling', 'straight', 'down', 'first', 'come', 'one', 'direction', 'while', 'late', 'fall', 'different', 'direction', 'set', 'completely', 'sunny', 'So', 'extra', 'work', 'nothing', 'was', 'really', 'gained', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'location', 'filming', 'was', 'expensive', 'was', 'used', 'very', 'limited', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'budget', 'constraints', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'entire', 'show', 'filmed', 'location', 'also', 'had', 'water', 'filming', 'impression', 'likely', 'had', 'retakes', 'shot', 'were', 'more', 'apt', 'use', 'first', 'take', 'certain', 'times', 'were', 'high', 'winds', 'causing', 'further', 'sound', 'trouble', 'are', 'couple', 'where', 'have', 'rewound', 'try', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'Ace', 'was', 'saying', 'even', 'listening', 'several', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'her.One', 'extras', 'film', 'writer', 'cast', 'answering', 'questions', 'convention', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'show', 'found', 'bit', 'annoying', 'writer', 'carrys', 'just', 'created', 'top', 'rated', 'movie', 'something', 'special.There', 'separate', 'interview', 'writer', 'where', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'background', 'charactors', 'help', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'necessary', 'script', 'was', 'better']",Doctor Who - The Curse of Fenric VHS

304369,AMS0KR29YZXCE,630225678X,"Kenneth Sohl ""ksohl@bellsouth.net""","[1, 6]","In search of GOOD Sylvester McCoy stories for my classic Who collection, I finally purchased this one and watched it.  I had been a little curious about the mixed reviews here, and now I know why it has had such an uneven reception.Although the fact that the BBC is saturated with leftists is no secret, this one really slaps the viewer in the face with it.  The main human baddy is a british naval commander wanting to make a  preemptive strike against the russians before WW2 ends.  He rants maniacally that they will never be allies, revealing his unreasoning prejudice.  I guess the writer forgot all about the actions of Stalin and Kruschev in the decades to follow. At one point, as a scientist is explaining to him about the machine that thinks (a computer integral to the plot), he muses out loud about whose thoughts it will hold, revealing his motivation and casting him as enemy to free thought, the inference being that free thought is communism.  Hopefully, the viewers are educated enough to be familiar with the mass imprisonment and persecution of college professors as well as any individuals or groups with dissident viewpoints immediately after socialist revolutions (interestingly, in the case of college professors, the reasons given for this in revolutionary doctrine is that since these usually helped to overthrow their own government, they are not to be trusted.  Lenin refers to them in his book as ""useful idiots"").  In this story, faith is protection against the evil forces summoned, so a russian officer, armed with his faith in communism, walks unharmed through a horde of zombies that shrink back fearfully from his Order of Lenin medal.  Later, there is a scene where a priest (who questions his faith, no doubt because it isn't as pure as communism) with a crucifix tries the same thing, but is killed because he ""had no goodness in him.""  Give me a break! The russian commandos murder a group of british soldiers running down the beach for no apparent reason, the leader being shown to be properly contrite at this ""necessity of war"", while the british are shown to be harsh and xenophobic.  In the climax, a british and russian soldier joins forces, the russian saying that war is between politicians, not soldiers, but by this time, the message is clear that we are talking about western politicians, not ""revolutionary leaders"".  The russian calls the brit a brother, presumably a brother in socialism.  I couldn't help but be reminded here about all the ""brothers"" the russians sent to Siberia because they didn't embrace socialism.  However, this scene need not be taken politically.  In fact, it was almost naively heart-warming if the director hadn't smashed us over the head with it by having the actors repeat the same lines with different words about 3 times.  There's more (much more) showing the brave, heroic russians among the hateful british, but I think I made my point.All this is not to say that all is lost in this story.  The real star here is the directing.  Fast paced, the story practically hurtles along skilfully blending its mishmash of elements, first, into an intrigueing mystery, then, into a horrific pot-boiler.  The cast is superb, particularly the actors that portray the priest, the scientist, and the naval commander.  The creatures are imaginative, and the ""ancient one"" may be the most convincing monster ever seen in classic Who.  Photography was particularly good in this one as well.  The only further con I'd add, though, is  that this story seems to take itself a little too seriously to be fun, as if the director forgot he was doing Doctor Who and thought he was making a hammer film.  Indeed, there is almost a slight touch of the avant garde in the directing, as might have been encountered in the best of Hammer.All in all, one of McCoy's better ones, but so heavily laced with political propoganda that it is an extremely sweet chocolate bar that leaves the bitterest of aftertastes. One wonders why it rated a 2-DVD release, or why this story had some of the highest production values ever seen in Who.  For these reasons, I am forced to give it just 2 stars.

304372,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,630225678X,Matthew Kresal,"[3, 4]","There is a saying about going out on top. Sylvester McCoy (and indeed Doctor Who itself) found itself coming to an unexpected end in 1989 with some of the original series best stories.  Of those the best of them would be The Curse Of Fenric. With this DVD release this classic story is seen not only in its original form but in an expanded ""special edition"" that presents the way it was originally intended. The result is a unique release of what I consider to be the second best Doctor Who story ever.Any good production must have a god cast and this one has one of the best of the series. The performances start with the regulars: Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor and Sophie Aldred as Ace. McCoy gives his single best Doctor Who performance in this story as he strikes just the right balance between his more comedic Doctor of season 24 and the more serious Doctor of season 25 and earlier in season 26. Just look at the final episode (or the last half-hour of the special edition) to see McCoy at his best. Sophie Aldred also gives one of her best performances as Ace. This was the middle story of what has become known to fans as the ""Ace Trilogy"" (the other two stories being Ghost Light and Survival) due to their heavy focus on Ace and giving Aldred a chance to show off her skills as an actress. Aldred doesn't disappoint with a strong disappointment with a strong performance as the companion who discovers that her past is interlinked with the vents unfolding around her. Despite their excellent performances, McCoy and Aldred is just the tip of the cast.There is also an excellent supporting cast as well. There's Dinsdale Landen as Dr. Judson, the crippled computer scientist who unleashes the title and effectively embodies it. Alfred Lynch gives an excellent performance the obsessive Commander Millington who grows more and more paranoid as the story unfolds. There are also excellent performances from Tomek Bork as Soviet Captain Sorin plus Joann Kenny and Joanne Belll as the two teenagers Jean and Phyllis. Even the smaller roles are filled with good actors and actress like Anne Reid (Nurse Crane), Steven Rimkus (Captain Bates), Janet Henfrey (Mrs. Hardaker) and Raymond Trickett (the Ancient One). The true highlight of the supporting cast is Nicholas Parsons as Reverend Wainwright. Parsons, who apparently is better known in the UK for his more comedic roles and game show hosting, gives one of the best performances of the McCoy era as the priest who lost his faith and pays for it. There is a wonderful scene in the church where he is giving a sermon to an empty church that illustrates this beautifully and gives Parsons his best moment in the story. All together they form one of the show's best casts.The story also has some strong production values as well. From the outset we get a rather well-done recreation of a WWII era army camp complete with trappings of the era (including a well done 1940's computer). Then there's the Haemovore's: the vampire possible future evolution of humanity brought back to the past. The Haemovore's, especially the Ancient One, are amongst the best monsters ever designed for the show as they are incredibly spooky and convincing. Couple this with the underwater filming and excellent location work and the result is a story that proves that under the right conditions a low budget can be overcome.Then there's the heart of it all: the script. This is a story with many threads and layers. It is a story about war and faith that explores the nature of evil plus the lengths one must go to fight it. On top of all that there is the obvious horror aspect in the form of the Haemovores. Ian Briggs also manages to tie together stories from the McCoy era (Silver Nemesis, Dragonfire) to explore the background and character of Ace. Above all, this story is a sort of chess game between the Doctor and is ancient enemy named here as Fenric in which all the other characters act as their pawns. This is a story where one must watch to get everything that is going on making this not only a action story but one of the show's most cerebral as well.  It is because of its complexity that the ""special edition"" is worth watching.The DVD is packed with special features including interviews, commentaries, making of stuff etc but the true star of this release: the ""special edition"" version of the story. This version is movie length with new scenes, CGI effects and a 5.1 soundtrack which makes it the superior of the two versions. This is not only because of the CGI effects and the excellent 5.1 soundtrack but because of the new scenes added to the story. The new scenes add a new depth to the story that expands on the backgrounds of some character sand the actions of others.  This version also is helped by the regarding done the story which brings a new degree of atmosphere that the story was previously missing. The result is a classic story made all the better and this version of the story alone is worth the price of the DVD.The Curse Of Fenric is Doctor Who at its finest or close to it. It is defiantly the best story of the McCoy era at any rate with its strong performances, good production values and a strong script. This DVD release, with the ""special edition"" version, is the definitive version of this classic Doctor Who adventure. Believe what you've heard: The Curse Of Fenric is excellent.",5,The Best Story Of The McCoy Era Gets Better,1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,5365,"['saying', 'going', 'out', 'top', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy',

Duvall ""KangiTanka3""","[0, 0]","I could wax on forever about how much I adore this story and how absolutely amazing it is in my opinion (and increasingly that of many other DW fans). Loved it when I first saw it back in 1989 and I still do, all the more with the passing of time.But the special 103 minute cut to be found in the special features of this DVD release I enjoyed even better than the original four-parter that aired as classic Doctor Who's penultimate story in '89. Not only does it benefit from some fine effects work and some deleted scenes that have been reintegrated into the tale, it flows far better and makes a good deal more sense than the original. This is the FULL story being told for the first time.In both versions this is an epic in every sense of the word. But like all the best Who epics it is deeply personal as well as earth-shattering. A complex tale, to be sure, but one that develops beautifully as it unfolds. It's set during World War II in an army base on the northeastern English coast, and is full of period charm. A dark, gritty story in many ways, and definitely geared toward DW's Horror side.This is admittedly a strange mix of themes - the Second World War, an ancient Viking curse, vampires (or something similar at least), Russian spies, Ace's backstory and more. BUT it is all blended seamlessly and magically into what I absolutely believe is one of the greatest masterpieces of Classic Who's last five to ten years.The two stories in Season 26 that preceded it, 'Battlefield' and 'Ghost Light', build up to this moment beautifully, and I highly suggest watching them first. BUT really this story began all the way back in 'Dragonfire', when Ace first joined the Doctor in traveling time and space, and was touched upon again several times thereafter, especially in 'Silver Nemesis' and then all of Season 26. This serial is the culmination of almost two seasons of omens and portents involving the Doctor's companion and her past, and in that sense there is much a ""nu Who"" fan can find to enjoy here.And at the end of it every character, especially the 7th Doctor (whose manipulations of friend and foe alike come to a head here) and above all Ace (who comes of age and makes peace with her past over the course of this story), has grown immensely.My favourite science fiction take on vampires ever, too.So many magical scenes here. And some of the best moments, happy and tragic both, between the Seven and Ace (in my opinion one of the very best Doctor & Companion pairings ever) happen here.I can't recommend it enough!",5,One of Doctor Who's greatest epics - especially now,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,2540,"['could', 'wax', 'forever', 'how', 'much', 'adore', 'story', 'how', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'opinion', 'increasingly', 'many', 'other', 'DW', 'fans', 'Loved', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'back', '1989', 'still', 'do', 'more', 'passing', 'time.But', 'special', '103', 'minute', 'cut', 'be', 'found', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'release', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'four-parter', 'aired', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'penultimate', 'story', ""'89"", 'Not', 'only', 'benefit', 'fine', 'effects', 'work', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'reintegrated', 'tale', 'far', 'better', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'sense', 'original', 'FULL', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'first', 'time.In', 'versions', 'epic', 'sense', 'word', 'best', 'Who', 'epics', 'deeply', 'personal', 'as', 'well', 'earth-shattering', 'complex', 'tale', 'be', 'sure', 'one', 'beautifully', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'army', 'base', 'northeastern', 'English', 'coast', 'full', 'period', 'charm', 'dark', 'gritty', 'story', 'many', 'ways', 'definitely', 'geared', 'DW', 'Horror', 'side.This', 'admittedly', 'strange', 'mix', 'themes', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'ancient', 'Viking', 'curse', 'vampires', 'something', 'similar', 'least', 'Russian', 'spies', 'Ace', 'backstory', 'more', 'blended', 'seamlessly', 'magically', 'what', 'absolutely', 'believe', 'one', 'greatest', 'masterpieces', 'Classic', 'Who', 'last', 'five', 'ten', 'two', 'stories', 'Season', '26', 'preceded', ""'Ghost"", 'Light', 'build', 'up', 'moment', 'beautifully', 'highly', 'suggest', 'watching', 'first', 'BUT', 'really', 'story', 'began', 'way', 'back', ""'Dragonfire"", 'when', 'Ace', 'first', 'joined', 'Doctor', 'traveling', 'time', 'space', 'was', 'touched', 'upon', 'again', 'several', 'times', 'thereafter', 'especially', ""'Silver"", 'Nemesis', 'then', 'Season', '26', 'serial', 'culmination', 'almost', 'two', 'seasons', 'omens', 'portents', 'involving', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'past', 'sense', 'much', 'nu', 'Who', 'fan', 'can', 'find', 'enjoy', 'here.And', 'end', 'character', 'especially', '7th', 'Doctor', 'manipulations', 'friend', 'foe', 'alike', 'come', 'head', 'here', 'Ace', 'who', 'age', 'peace', 'past', 'course', 'story', 'grown', 'immensely.My', 'favourite', 'science', 'fiction', 'take', 'vampires', 'ever', 'too.So', 'many', 'magical', 'scenes', 'here', 'best', 'moments', 'happy', 'tragic', 'Seven', 'Ace', 'opinion', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'Doctor', 'Companion', 'pairings', 'ever', 'happen', 'here.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough']",Doctor Who - The Curse of Fenric VHS

304375,A3DYEOY7Q7ZR3V,630225678X,Rick Lundeen,"[16, 31]","I feel sorry for Sylvester McCoy. Because of bad management decisions at the BBC, he didn't get a proper regeneration sequence,  his first season was horrible AND short since it wasn't written for him. He was saddled with two companions, one, Mel, who was an unbelievable annoyance and then Ace who eventually had some good moments but also had a mush-mouth and it was often hard to hear what she was actually saying. He only had 12 adventures to play the Doctor on TV at the time and about 8 of them were pretty bad. &quot;Fenric&quot; is one of his better shows but unfortunately that's not saying much. Sometimes, things are not clear in this story, such as the badguy being an old enemy of the Doctor and this really does seem to come out of nowhere. McCoy's Doctor being very secretive and manipulative? Never quite worked for me and I felt the show was at it's worst during his era. He did have some good shows, though, the best being 'Remembrance of the Daleks', 'Happiness Patrol' and 'Battlefield'. Fenric runs in place right after. Keep in mind, I don't blame McCoy but pretty much everybody ELSE involved at the time, right down to the sound man who apparently didn't know what he was doing either when you can't understand  a lot of the incidental dialogue spoken by your two lead actors.

Sundquist,"[1, 2]","Sylvester McCoy was a spectacular Doctor, perhaps second best out of all ten actors to play the part, and Sophie Aldred's Ace is one of the more interesting and entertaining companions. It's too bad that many of their stories suffered from muddled plotting and clumsy staging, but regardless of a story's quality, the Doctor and Ace are still worth watching.Set in 1943, ""The Curse of Fenric"" is helped immensely by a great location (the south coast of England standing in for the North Sea coast, and an honest to goodness old military base), and some hideous monsters, the haemovores. The inclusion of Viking legends, Soviet commandos, and a secret cipher-cracking machine makes it all into a bit of a jumble, but it does manage to work itself out in the end, and rewards a second viewing. It's not quite ""cinematic"", but the BBC never used to have that sort of budget; the result is modest but slightly more impressive than the usual cardboard corridors the Doctor runs around in.The special features are a little thinner than on other DVDs, focusing on the makeup, costumes, and the location, with no interviews besides an informative chat with the story's writer, Ian Briggs. There is a special edition of the serial, edited into a single movie with a few added scenes.This story is dominated more than usual by its guest cast, including the crippled scientist Dr Judson and the unhinged base commander Millington. Sophie Aldred as Ace really takes center stage for much of it, unwittingly helping out the villains as both sides are manipulated by Fenric and the Doctor -- mirroring the frequent references to chess throughout.Though not the greatest Dr Who story, it's definitely not a dismal ending to the series, and how could it be with Sylvester McCoy as the second-best Doctor of them all?",4,The Wolves of Fenric,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,1800,"['Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Doctor', 'perhaps', 'second', 'best', 'ten', 'actors', 'play', 'part', 'Sophie', 'Aldred', 'Ace', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'companions', 'too', 'bad', 'many', 'stories', 'suffered', 'muddled', 'plotting', 'clumsy', 'staging', 'regardless', 'story', 'quality', 'Doctor', 'Ace', 'are', 'still', 'worth', 'watching.Set', '1943', 'Curse', 'Fenric', 'helped', 'immensely', 'great', 'location', 'south', 'coast', 'England', 'standing', 'North', 'Sea', 'coast', 'honest', 'goodness', 'old', 'military', 'base', 'hideous', 'monsters', 'haemovores', 'inclusion', 'Viking', 'legends', 'Soviet', 'commandos', 'secret', 'cipher-cracking', 'machine', 'bit', 'jumble', 'manage', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'second', 'viewing', 'not', 'quite', 'cinematic', 'BBC', 'never', 'used', 'have', 'sort', 'budget', 'result', 'modest', 'slightly', 'more', 'impressive', 'usual', 'cardboard', 'corridors', 'Doctor', 'in.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'little', 'thinner', 'other', 'DVDs', 'focusing', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'location', 'interviews', 'informative', 'chat', 'story', 'writer', 'Ian', 'Briggs', 'special', 'edition', 'serial', 'edited', 'single', 'movie', 'few', 'added', 'scenes.This', 'story', 'dominated', 'more', 'usual', 'guest', 'cast', 'including', 'crippled', 'scientist', 'Dr', 'Judson', 'unhinged', 'base', 'commander', 'Millington', 'Sophie', 'Aldred', 'Ace', 'really', 'center', 'stage', 'much', 'unwittingly', 'helping', 'out', 'villains', 'sides', 'are', 'manipulated', 'Fenric', 'Doctor', 'mirroring', 'frequent', 'references', 'chess', 'not', 'greatest', 'Dr', 'Who', 'story', 'definitely', 'not', 'dismal', 'ending', 'series', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'second-best', 'Doctor']",Doctor Who - The Curse of Fenric VHS
304377,ABVULUZ2ILKKO,630225678X,Stephen Ressel,"[7, 16]","By Jingo.  By Jove.  Buy Junk.  Because, if you purchase this, you are getting pure grade A crap. There are few Doctor Who episodes I never saw, but among the ones I saw this ranks far down the ladder near the bottom.  Does any of this make sense to anyone?  Chess sets, self destructive hemovores, Russians invading a small British building for a coding device with a twist, a cripple genius that is out thought by Ace, faith stops the overly under edited vampires, and a lot of fluff and dialogue that goes no where.  That's what I saw.  Why was the Doctor even there?  It was like the writer needed an excuse to make him fit into the fan fiction he wrote in 1979.  Even comes with ridiculous predictions, earth prophecies, and cartoonish reflections on the cold war.My head is still reeling from this one.  It was a whirlwind of bad.  But, Since JNT took the reins of Doctor Who it never fully recovered from the throes of bad writing.  Even the new series does THIS, but with a lot of nice technical aspects, most times.  If you want great pulp TV, go back to the early Tom Bakers.  If you want enticing acting and stories, with a bit of fun, go to the Troughtons.  But have pity on yourself- avoid this era completely.",1,Fenric = Bad Writing + Bad Lighting,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1223,"['Jingo', 'Jove', 'Buy', 'Junk', 'purchase', 'are', 'getting', 'pure', 'grade', 'crap', 'are', 'few', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'never', 'saw', 'ones', 'saw', 'far', 'down', 'ladder', 'bottom', 'make', 'sense', 'anyone', 'Chess', 'sets', 'destructive', 'hemovores', 'Russians', 'invading', 'small', 'British', 'building', 'coding', 'device', 'twist', 'cripple', 'genius', 'out', 'thought', 'Ace', 'faith', 'overly', 'edited', 'vampires', 'lot', 'fluff', 'dialogue', 'where', 'what', 'saw', 'Why', 'was', 'Doctor', 'even', 'there', 'was', 'writer', 'needed', 'excuse', 'make', 'fit', 'fan', 'fiction', 'wrote', '1979', 'Even', 'ridiculous', 'predictions', 'earth', 'prophecies', 'cartoonish', 'reflections', 'cold', 'war.My', 'head', 'still', 'reeling', 'one', 'was', 'whirlwind', 'bad', 'JNT', 'took', 'reins', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'throes', 'bad', 'writing', 'Even', 'new', 'series', 'THIS', 'lot', 'nice', 'technical', 'aspects', 'most', 'times', 'want', 'great', 'pulp', 'TV', 'go', 'back', 'early', 'Tom', 'Bakers', 'want', 'enticing', 'acting', 'stories', 'bit', 'fun', 'go', 'Troughtons', 'have', 'pity', 'yourself-', 'avoid', 'era', 'completely']",Doctor Who - The Curse of Fenric VHS
304378,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,630225678X,Twiddles42,"[33, 41]","This release is unique - it contains both the original transmission version of the story, and a 1 hr 45 minute re-edit that contains 14 minutes of previously unseen footage, that is dedicated to the Director (Nicholas Mallett) and the Producer (John Nathan-Turner) and justifiably so.The story itself is a classic Dr Who monster tale, but with a few grown up twists added, and also gives the companion, Ace, some maturation in the process.  This is a story I'd recommend to people I'd try to get hooked on the series, even though I'm still embarrassed over the question mark vest the Doctor wears...  I am a fan of JNT and what he had done with the show despite the crass slop the script editor prior to Andrew Cartmel had allowed during his years as script editor, and the only thing I can't forgive JNT for is the question mark pullover vest.  Even the 6th Doctor's outfit is far less grating on the nerves.  But I digress.  Andrew Cartmel, script editor for all of the 7th Doctor's era, is at his best here.  He reintroduced the concept of mystery and seriousness to the show and he did it right.  If only the show had continued for another year, with more stories to fill out their plans...The video quality itself is quite good, even exceptional.  Given the high prices that Who discs command, it's a shame that Warner Bros won't release them on dual-layer discs to improve the compression artifacting, but this release (along with &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;...) seem to be the most visually clean stories they've released to date.  Even so, the releases up to now have been more or less great (with only &quot;Ressurection of the Daleks&quot; really showing the artifacting to an annoying level.)The audio had been remastered into Dolby 5.1, because somebody kept the original audio tapes.  Apart from the theme music (which sounds better as the original stereo*), the 5.1 remastering is very effective.There are numerous extras, primarily encompassing the behind the scenes efforts in producing this story, and interviews with cast and crew.The special 'movie' edition is extraordinary.  Many of the newly added scenes are worth their weight.  They also treated the video to look more consistent, given the stormy nature of the later half of the story.  They also improved on some of the effects.  The only problem is with some of the music.  It betrays that this story was originally composed of four episodes.  It's most noticeable when, 25 minutes into the story, you hear music that's got action to it but doesn't fall back and leaves you hanging (ala a cliffhanger).  It's a very MINOR issue, but as I love to whine about problems, I felt I should mention it.  :-)The only problem with the disc (#1) is when you go to watch the titles sequences - if you select the 'original stereo' version, you get the original MONO version.  I hope they fix this someday and offer free exchanges...In the end, it's a shame the BBC lost faith in the series.  (the monsters in this tale would take full notice if it too, heh.)  This one is a MUST for any fan of the show.  Even if you're not a fan of the 7th Doctor era (the scripts in novel form are rather better than how they were put on screen), this one is worthy of buying.I'm looking forward for the remainder of the 7th Doctor on DVD.",5,This one really IS one of the better 7th Doctor stories!,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,3289,"['release', 'unique', 'original', 'transmission', 'version', 'story', '1', 'hr', '45', 'minute', 're-edit', '14', 'minutes', 'previously', 'unseen', 'footage', 'dedicated', 'Director', 'Nicholas', 'Mallett', 'Producer', 'John', 'Nathan-Turner', 'justifiably', 'so.The', 'story', 'classic', 'Dr', 'Who', 'monster', 'tale', 'few', 'grown', 'up', 'twists', 'added', 'also', 'companion', 'Ace', 'maturation', 'process', 'story', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'people', ""'d"", 'try', 'get', 'hooked', 'series', 'even', ""'m"", 'still', 'embarrassed', 'question', 'mark', 'Doctor', 'wears', 'am', 'fan', 'JNT', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'show', 'crass', 'slop', 'script', 'editor', 'prior', 'Andrew', 'Cartmel', 'had', 'allowed', 'years', 'script', 'editor', 'only', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'JNT', 'question', 'mark', 'pullover', 'vest', 'Even', '6th', 'Doctor', 'outfit', 'far', 'less', 'grating', 'nerves', 'digress', 'Andrew', 'Cartmel', 'script', 'editor', '7th', 'Doctor', 'era', 'best', 'here', 'reintroduced', 'concept', 'mystery', 'seriousness', 'show', 'did', 'right', 'only', 'show', 'had', 'continued', 'year', 'more', 'stories', 'fill', 'out', 'plans', 'video', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'even', 'exceptional', 'Given', 'high', 'prices', 'Who', 'discs', 'command', 'shame', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'wo', ""n't"", 'release', 'dual-layer', 'discs', 'improve', 'compression', 'artifacting', 'release', 'quot', 'Two', 'Doctors', 'quot', 'seem', 'be', 'most', 'visually', 'clean', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'released', 'date', 'Even', 'so', 'releases', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'great', 'only', 'quot', 'Ressurection', 'Daleks', 'quot', 'really', 'showing', 'artifacting', 'annoying', 'level', 'audio', 'had', 'been', 'remastered', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'somebody', 'kept', 'original', 'audio', 'tapes', 'Apart', 'theme', 'music', 'better', 'original', 'stereo*', '5.1', 'remastering', 'very', 'effective.There', 'are', 'numerous', 'extras', 'primarily', 'encompassing', 'scenes', 'efforts', 'producing', 'story', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew.The', 'special', ""'movie"", 'edition', 'extraordinary', 'Many', 'newly', 'added', 'scenes', 'are', 'worth', 'weight', 'also', 'treated', 'video', 'look', 'more', 'consistent', 'given', 'stormy', 'nature', 'later', 'half', 'story', 'also', 'improved', 'effects', 'only', 'problem', 'music', 'story', 'was', 'originally', 'composed', 'four', 'episodes', 'most', 'noticeable', 'when', '25', 'minutes', 'story', 'hear', 'music', 'got', 'action', ""n't"", 'fall', 'back', 'hanging', 'cliffhanger', 'very', 'MINOR', 'issue', 'love', 'whine', 'problems', 'felt', 'should', 'mention', 'only', 'problem', 'disc', '1', 'when', 'go', 'watch', 'titles', 'sequences', 'select', ""'original"", 'stereo', 'version', 'get', 'original', 'MONO', 'version', 'hope', 'fix', 'someday', 'offer', 'free', 'exchanges', 'end', 'shame', 'BBC', 'lost', 'faith', 'series', 'monsters', 'tale', 'would', 'take', 'full', 'notice', 'too', 'one', 'MUST', 'fan', 'show', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', '7th', 'Doctor', 'era', 'scripts', 'novel', 'form', 'are', 'rather', 'better', 'how', 'were', 'put', 'screen', 'one', 'worthy', 'buying.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'remainder', '7th', 'Doctor', 'DVD']",Doctor Who - The Curse of Fenric VHS
