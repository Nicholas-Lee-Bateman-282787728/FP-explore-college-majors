Vince Edwards is superbly cast and Sam Jaffe as well!! Some really great Guest Stars and some stand out episodes! Better than ER!!!,5,ONE OF THE EARLY GREATS,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,255,"['was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'dealt', 'people', 'dying', 'not', 'alwasy', 'typical', 'happy', 'ending', 'Vince', 'Edwards', 'superbly', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Jaffe', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'great', 'Guest', 'Stars', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'Better', 'ER']",N/A

1514799,A11DSVTOJO61A8,B006EMUYPE,Leslie,"[5, 5]","""Man, woman, birth, death, infinity"" was the catch phrase of this terrific medical drama of Ben Casey, a chief resident neuro-surgeon at the Country General Hospital, who goes the extra mile, goes over the heads of his senior colleagues and almost everyone else to do what has to be done, and speaks his mind.Vince Edwards portrayed Ben Casey, a doctor's doctor, who knew his job better than most others, never suffered fools lightly, and medicine was everything to him and his life came last.Doctor David Zorba (Sam Jaffe) is his greatest friend and helps Ben through thick and thin. Each episode Ben Casey is either saving lives, operating, fighting the bureaucrats, dealing with death, irate people, taking flack for doing what (in his opinion) is the right thing or bonding with doctor Maggie and the other doctors at the hospital. All this is in a days work for the overworked and underpaid doctor who lives at the hospital.In the first episode we learn that when he was young he had rabies and survived, and that saved his life when he was infected by a needle he tried to give to an infected woman he was dealing with, and just as well. If he had not this series would not have lasted the first episode, and we would not have seen one of THE greatest medical dramas ever.As doctor Zorba said, ""It is a sad house we work in Ben Casey, broken bodies, shattered minds, some genuine sick, some over come by their weakness, just like Mr. Moonie in there, the sick and the weak.""All you ER lovers out there eat your heart out, because you haven't seen a medical drama until you have seen Ben Casey. Besides, it was forty years before ER, was way ahead of its time, on a budget that producers would kill for today, was informative as well as entertaining. As was most of the shows from that era.Ben Casey was, and still is, great to watch and people tuned in each week to get their medical fix for another short hour, but was relived by the tongues that discussed and probed the show the next day.It is at the top of the bill with shows like ""Dr. Kildare"" (Richard Chamberlain) and ""Medic"" (Richard Boone), that put the big budget shows of today to shame.This is a region free series, so you won't have to worry if your dvd player will work or not. But I have noticed with a lot of these box sets they are using one case with three discs piled on top of each other to cut costs. If you want the sets it is something you will have to deal with yourself, as it is not going to change.There are twenty shows in the first series and twenty-one in series two and three.I recommend this series to anyone who is tied of the drawn-out shows of today, to those who remember Ben Casey when they were growing up, and especially to those who have not had the privilege to see it yet.The series get five stars from me as I was glad to be able to see it again, and hope lots of people will buy and watch the complete series, there are more to come. You will not be disappointed.",5,Ben Casey season one,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,2964,"['Man', 'woman', 'birth', 'death', 'infinity', 'was', 'catch', 'phrase', 'terrific', 'medical', 'drama', 'Ben', 'Casey', 'chief', 'resident', 'neuro-surgeon', 'Country', 'General', 'Hospital', 'who', 'extra', 'mile', 'heads', 'senior', 'colleagues', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'mind.Vince', 'Edwards', 'portrayed', 'Ben', 'Casey', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'who', 'knew', 'job', 'better', 'most', 'others', 'never', 'suffered', 'fools', 'lightly', 'medicine', 'was', 'everything', 'life', 'came', 'last.Doctor', 'David', 'Zorba', 'Sam', 'Jaffe', 'greatest', 'friend', 'Ben', 'thick', 'thin', 'episode', 'Ben', 'Casey', 'either', 'saving', 'lives', 'operating', 'fighting', 'bureaucrats', 'dealing', 'death', 'irate', 'people', 'taking', 'flack', 'doing', 'what', 'opinion', 'right', 'thing', 'bonding', 'doctor', 'Maggie', 'other', 'doctors', 'hospital', 'days', 'work', 'overworked', 'underpaid', 'doctor', 'who', 'hospital.In', 'first', 'episode', 'learn', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'had', 'rabies', 'survived', 'saved', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'infected', 'needle', 'tried', 'give', 'infected', 'woman', 'was', 'dealing', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'not', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'lasted', 'first', 'episode', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'THE', 'greatest', 'medical', 'dramas', 'ever.As', 'doctor', 'Zorba', 'said', 'sad', 'house', 'work', 'Ben', 'Casey', 'broken', 'bodies', 'shattered', 'minds', 'genuine', 'sick', 'come', 'weakness', 'just', 'Mr.', 'Moonie', 'there', 'sick', 'weak', 'ER', 'lovers', 'out', 'there', 'eat', 'heart', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'medical', 'drama', 'have', 'seen', 'Ben', 'Casey', 'Besides', 'was', 'forty', 'years', 'ER', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'budget', 'producers', 'would', 'kill', 'today', 'was', 'informative', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'was', 'most', 'shows', 'era.Ben', 'Casey', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'people', 'tuned', 'week', 'get', 'medical', 'fix', 'short', 'hour', 'was', 'relived', 'tongues', 'discussed', 'probed', 'show', 'next', 'day.It', 'top', 'bill', 'shows', 'Dr.', 'Kildare', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Medic', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'put', 'big', 'budget', 'shows', 'today', 'shame.This', 'region', 'free', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'dvd', 'player', 'will', 'work', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', 'lot', 'box', 'sets', 'are', 'using', 'one', 'case', 'three', 'discs', 'piled', 'top', 'other', 'cut', 'costs', 'want', 'sets', 'something', 'will', 'have', 'deal', 'not', 'going', 'change.There', 'are', 'twenty', 'shows', 'first', 'series', 'twenty-one', 'series', 'two', 'three.I', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'tied', 'drawn-out', 'shows', 'today', 'who', 'remember', 'Ben', 'Casey', 'when', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'privilege', 'see', 'yet.The', 'series', 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'again', 'hope', 'lots', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'watch', 'complete', 'series', 'are', 'more', 'come', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Unlike today's medical shows which have about three running plots per episode, Casey held one storyline tightly knit throughout each episode. I met James Moser long ago. He told me they would always try and get the best writers and directors. Back then a lot of them had been writing for shows like Kraft Theatre and Playhouse 90. I would love to be able to purchase this season by season, but I guess you take what you can get.",3,Great Series,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,489,"['Ben', 'Casey', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'TV', 'series', 'time', 'today', 'medical', 'shows', 'have', 'three', 'running', 'plots', 'episode', 'Casey', 'held', 'one', 'storyline', 'tightly', 'knit', 'episode', 'met', 'James', 'Moser', 'long', 'ago', 'told', 'would', 'always', 'try', 'get', 'best', 'writers', 'directors', 'Back', 'then', 'lot', 'had', 'been', 'writing', 'shows', 'Kraft', 'Theatre', 'Playhouse', '90', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'able', 'purchase', 'season', 'season', 'guess', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get']",N/A
