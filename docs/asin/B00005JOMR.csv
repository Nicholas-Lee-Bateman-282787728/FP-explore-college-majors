It's smart, clever and so well written in characters. This is one of the Must See TV series that never gets talked about much. I hope, I just hope that season three and four come out on dvd as well. Because from what looks like there hasn't been news on it, it looks like we'll have to treasure both season one and two until then.",5,Must See TV on DVD,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,464,"['are', 'looking', 'something', 'quality', 'television', 'watching', 'Buy', '1st', 'season', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'enjoyment', 'smart', 'clever', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'characters', 'one', 'Must', 'See', 'TV', 'series', 'never', 'talked', 'about', 'much', 'hope', 'just', 'hope', 'season', 'three', 'four', 'come', 'out', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'what', ""n't"", 'been', 'news', ""'ll"", 'have', 'treasure', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'then']",Caroline in the City: Season 1
642065,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B00005JOMR,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[7, 8]","I followed the ""Must See TV"" Thursday night line-up as long as it kept throwing out worthwhile, inspired, clever and funny programming. And this show was part of the last generation of those kind of shows, particularly comedies in my case. For some reason, few guys admit to liking this show. Is it ""Seinfeld?"" Of course not. But that was the kind of show more guys related to more than a show like ""Caroline In The City,"" which was one of my favorite comedies of all the ""Must See"" lineup. In addition to the leads- Thompson (Caroline), Lutes (Del), Getz (Richard), and Pietz (Annie), Andrew Lauer, who played Charlie, Del's assistant/messenger had me in stitches on many occasions. I've always adored Lea Thompson, so sampling her show was a given. But there was definitely something about it from the beginning that separated it from other flash in the pan sitcoms. Once you took this show on its own, and not by comparing it to others it grew on you very fast. The story lines were as relatable as they come, but with a different sense of humor than its contemporaries, albeit with some usual formulas. But the ensemble pulls it off. And as the show and characters developed, so did the appeal. The show was not only funny, but had a real heart. Even the extras on the series had their shining moments and contributions to this show- restauranteur Remo was always ready to pounce on any cue for a home run chuckle. Sadly, in its latest stage it started to pander to the focus group mentality who felt adding additional, yet pointless cast members would reach a wider demographic (Suddenly Susan suffered through the same desperation as it aged too), and the exact opposite occurred. It wound up pleasing nobody, or at least displeased its most loyal followers. What a pitiful finish to a show with so much potential, and a great fistful of episodes to embrace in its early years. When I bought the DVD set, I went through them in no time. They just flew by. Very entertaining series with the edge it needed to separate it from the others. I can't wait for follow up season releases.",4,"The last era I watched TV regularly, because of shows like ""Caroline""",1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,2086,"['followed', 'Must', 'See', 'TV', 'Thursday', 'night', 'line-up', 'as', 'long', 'kept', 'throwing', 'out', 'worthwhile', 'inspired', 'clever', 'funny', 'programming', 'show', 'was', 'part', 'last', 'generation', 'kind', 'shows', 'particularly', 'comedies', 'case', 'reason', 'few', 'guys', 'admit', 'liking', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'course', 'not', 'was', 'kind', 'show', 'more', 'guys', 'related', 'more', 'show', 'Caroline', 'City', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'Must', 'See', 'lineup', 'addition', 'leads-', 'Thompson', 'Caroline', 'Lutes', 'Del', 'Getz', 'Richard', 'Pietz', 'Annie', 'Andrew', 'Lauer', 'who', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Del', 'assistant/messenger', 'had', 'stitches', 'many', 'occasions', ""'ve"", 'always', 'adored', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'so', 'sampling', 'show', 'was', 'given', 'was', 'definitely', 'something', 'beginning', 'separated', 'other', 'flash', 'pan', 'sitcoms', 'took', 'show', 'own', 'not', 'comparing', 'others', 'grew', 'very', 'fast', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'as', 'relatable', 'come', 'different', 'sense', 'humor', 'contemporaries', 'usual', 'formulas', 'ensemble', 'pulls', 'off', 'show', 'characters', 'developed', 'so', 'did', 'appeal', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'had', 'real', 'heart', 'Even', 'extras', 'series', 'had', 'shining', 'moments', 'contributions', 'show-', 'restauranteur', 'Remo', 'was', 'always', 'ready', 'pounce', 'cue', 'home', 'run', 'chuckle', 'Sadly', 'latest', 'stage', 'started', 'pander', 'focus', 'group', 'mentality', 'who', 'felt', 'adding', 'additional', 'yet', 'pointless', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'reach', 'wider', 'demographic', 'Suddenly', 'Susan', 'suffered', 'same', 'desperation', 'aged', 'too', 'exact', 'opposite', 'occurred', 'wound', 'up', 'pleasing', 'nobody', 'least', 'displeased', 'most', 'loyal', 'followers', 'What', 'pitiful', 'finish', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'great', 'fistful', 'episodes', 'embrace', 'early', 'years', 'When', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'went', 'time', 'just', 'flew', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'series', 'edge', 'needed', 'separate', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'follow', 'up', 'season', 'releases']",Caroline in the City: Season 1

Not sure what other reviewers meant when they said the episodes were out of order.  I sure haven't noticed that.  I think this is one of the most fun series and just laugh-out-loud fun.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that there are some adult-themed episodes and I'm never sure if an episode is appropriate for my young teen-aged daughter or son to watch with me until I'm in the middle of it (which I find sort of disappointing.) Some episodes are perfectly acceptable and others, not so much.  My daughter actually left the room the other night during an episode b/c she obviously felt uncomfortable.  Still for adults, it's humor that we just don't get to see these days and that's a shame.
