1019811,A2QHYTS231GJB3,B000ICLRJS,Christie W.,"[15, 20]","Having watched this feature on Hallmark, it seemed more commercials than actual film.  Even though it clocks in at just over an hour, it feels much shorter.Unfortunately, the story varies greatly from that of the book.  It continues with Jeff, now as the LaHaye's adopted son.  The little romance in this film involves him.  Tragedy strikes the LaHaye family early on in the film.  Clark had been there visting and remains to be with Missie.I was disappointed not only in the film's overall lack of plot but also because I found the acting even more hokey than usual.  The actress who play Missie overacts to the extreme in this film.  Her feelings are, of course, understandable- but she doesn't act in ways that felt real or relatable.  It all seems melodramatic, almost laughably so.Marty does not appear in this film or the previous, which makes it seem as if she has died.  (I understand Katherine Heigl's being in a successful TV show but she has a good fan base going with this series.  But maybe she refused because the quality is so poor.  If that's the case, I understand completely.  I wouldn't want my name attached to it either.)I love the fact that these beloved, faith-full stories are being made into films but I just wish that they would stick to Janette Oke's plot and not try to make up their own.  The missing elements are, unfortunately, all too obvious.I rated this three stars because I have to give them credit for trying to produce good, faithful, family entertainment.

I know movie-makers take ""artistic license"" and change the book but I was disappointed to see how much change there was. I think that the first movie of the series (Love Comes Softly) is the only one that remained true to the book.The thing that really disappointed me was the DVD itself.  The jacket said that the DVD contained both Widescreen and Full Screen versions.  The only problem was that the DVD had no labels at all so it was trial and error to find the format desired.  I would have thought that both versions could have been placed on one side of the DVD with a full label on the other side.  That way a person would know by looking at the DVD what movie it was.

1019825,A37DGB3816NA18,B000ICLRJS,John L. Williams,"[0, 1]","The fourth in the LOVE Series is easily the worst of the four. While Love Comes Softly sets a nice dramatic heartfelt tone with religious undertoes that inspire and move, this episode crashes and burns in nearly every possible aspect of the movie. It is only the competent acting of the film that keeps you at all interested in the melodrama that flows like a burst damn over what should have been a sensitive portrait of loss due to sudden crib death & how it affects a family.As a member of a family who lost an child to this, I find this portrait insulting and so forcefully RELIGIOUS that it offends. While the hand of God moves and guides one through such a terrible incident in life, to depict it in such a simplistic manner is mind-numbing. It is not in any way shape or form up to the standard set in the earlier episodues of this warm intimate series. While Mr. Landon Sr knew how to tread that thin line between healthfelt/sentiment with a passion and compassion, Mr Landon Jr seems to have oversteped that line and wandered most decidedly in to predictible exploitive melodrama. I only hope the remainer of the series reverts back to the style and grace of the first three films and does not continue into this mauldlin over the top style. When the very same actors who were reserved and illuminating in their roles, perform the same role but with such exaggerated emotions, you know the director is doing a diservice to the work. As the music swells ominously each time the evil rich mayor appears and he executes his insidious deeds on the poor Christian folk, one can feel the swells of not tears but thunderous laughter building with one's gut. Not the intended the reaction especially when dealing issues such as crib death, weather induced poverty and loss of the ability to maintain one's livelihood. In these trying economic times to see such black and white manipulations of situations & characters can only induce laughter and derisive dismissal.

Talk about awkward moments.  These people are friends of the LaHayes.Meanwhile, the mayor's daughter, Collette, has struck up a fancy to Willie's adopted son, Jeff.  It's an innocent friendship that soon blossom into a young simply romance.Willie struggles with his job as a sheriff.

1019827,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000ICLRJS,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","""Love's Abiding Joy"" was a treat.  It's the second in the series that I've seen.  Erin Cottrell who was in ""Legally Blonde II"" plays Missie, a mother who has to endure the sad death of a child.  She does a good job with the emotional life of the character and perhaps shows a bit more independence than we might expect for the time period with her insistence on teaching.  Logan Bartholomew who was in ""American Wedding"" plays her husband.  He's a nice looking young actor who was good at showing his tender feelings toward his wife.  However, there wasn't a depth of characterization that the role demanded.  Drew Tyler Bell who was in ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" plays the older son Jeff who becomes infatuated with the rich banker's daughter Colette.  The father Clark comes to visit.  His character was well established in the film I saw,Love Comes Softlywhere Katherine Heigl from ""Grey's Anatomy"" played his wife.  Dale Midkiff plays the character with depth and understanding.  John Laughlin who was in ""Footloose"" way back in 1984 plays the bad guy, the banker Samuel Doros.  He's a man who puts ethics in a back seat to practicality.  When he forecloses on the ranchers, he creates enemies.  His daughter Colette is played by Mae Whitman who was in TV's ""Arrested Development"" and can currently be seen in ""The Bionic Woman.""  As a rich kid daughter, she does a good job of being spoiled, but seems to have a sincere heart and good values as she swoons for Jeff.  James Tupper from the ""Men in Trees"" TV series plays Henry Klein whose ranch is saved by Missie's selfless action.  The film is based on Janette Oke's novel.  Director Michael Landon Jr. does an excellent job keeping the pacing and playing up just the right amount of tension.  This is a sweet film, well worth an evening's viewing.

I usually don't mind about creative liberties, as long as they keep the original theme, the main characters, and preserve the flavor that the books have. Mr. Landon Jr. has, I believe, suceeded in this for the most part. The plot in this the fourth installment to the series is fuller and richer than in any of the preceeding films, with several sub-plots imaginativly woven into the main. Clark is finally reunited with his daughter, Missie, after taking a stage-coach out west to her and Willie's struggling ranch, and he meets his grandson Maddy, grand-daughter Kathy, and adoptive grandson Jeff for the first time, as well as the faithful old ranch hands Scottie and Cookie, who have stayed by the Lahayes through the thick, and, now, in the thin. The happy moment is shattered, however, when the ""grim reaper"" comes for one of the Lahaye children. Friends with overwhelming burdens in their own lives reach out to the young couple with love and compassion, but nothing can keep Missie from the troubling reality that she is no longer capable of coping with the responsibilities of school-teaching, thus putting Willie in a position of reluctantly accepting the local Mayer's offer of a job as Tetsford Junction's first sherrif. While a blosseming friendship between teenage Jeff and Colette Doros -- the Mayor's daughter -- takes an honest turn for romance, Missie and Willie draw into seperate islands of dispair. Only Clark's determination to peirce through the darkness enshrouding Missie, only her own realization that she must do something to help Willie when he comes to a crisis between friendship and the letter of the law, only God's love, and the promise of abiding joy to those who trust in Him . . . is able to bring their hearts to a meeting place once again. Beatiful filming and music, touchingly potrayed relationships between people all of America has come to care about, and a story that promises to inspire. As far as the P.G. rating goes, I think it would have been wise to rate it so even without Mayor Doros' low muttered ""h**l"", or the kissing scene between Jeff and Colette. The theme is very mature, and without parental guidence young children might become upset and confused as Missie and Willie deal with their grief and try to help their neighbors in difficult circumstances. But with parental guidence, I think it would do no harm for the whole family to watch this together.
