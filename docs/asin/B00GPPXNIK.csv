1680085,A1TUZL12O7X1A9,B00GPPXNIK,Alexander G.,"[3, 5]","The film devours you into the main actress. Her acting, the interesting methodically developed transformation of her sexual identity, her ignition of passion towards the feminine of her choice, the love affair and the eventualities of how the love affair plays out. Reality created true to life nuanced passionate love story. True lived in character became profoundly interesting as the youthful passion became inflamed. Creation of passion was well done by the actresses and director capturing the subtleties and slowness of the developing love, the pause during the eye contract. Her awakening into a sexuality orientation and leap into her identity took dramatic alteration from who she thought she was and it seemed at the end of the movie her transformation is still somewhat being discovered. Sequels can fully explore her sexual identity whether lesbian or perhaps someone who loves the person despite their sex.Sexuality was utilized to explain and showcase the passions she felt and contrast them to her other love affairs especially the one with the male. Not everything in film needs to be imagined sometimes stark portrayals can truly take the audience into whats going on. We get to be completely immersed into the passions seeing some of the sexuality between the characters. We can therefore not only understand but feel more the character's spiritual love, her painful anguish, her desirous passions since we were allowed to voyeuristically step into the bedroom and take a peak. The relationship was unpredictable and you did not know what would happen next. The movie could have exploited this sexuality giving more of a thrill yet it remained controlled by holding back and focusing on the relationship and the psychoanalysis of love. This created more interesting characters.A world that delights in the delectable sensuality of life. Not only regarding sex but food takes on a symbol of pleasure. You see side characters not so much indulging as taking real genuine sensual satisfying pleasure in eating.The exquisite, philosophical, thought provoking, literary referenced, writing coupled with unbelievably believable acting portrayals made this possibly the best made film this year. Philosophical conversations not related to the thrust of the story but its themes such as the comparison of male vs female pleasure, gave the film another level of substance.It was very long at 3 hours and you were left with wanting to literally follow the main protagonist and find out what would happen next in her life. A sequel was suggested at end credits and it would be wonderful to see more well made explorations of these subject matters following this amazing actress. Further learning and discovering her primordial essence with her and witnessing how she will indulge in it.This Blu-Ray Is a Must Have!.",5,Coming of Primordial Essence (Age),1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,2822,"['film', 'devours', 'main', 'actress', 'acting', 'interesting', 'methodically', 'developed', 'transformation', 'sexual', 'identity', 'ignition', 'passion', 'feminine', 'choice', 'love', 'affair', 'eventualities', 'how', 'love', 'affair', 'out', 'Reality', 'created', 'true', 'life', 'nuanced', 'passionate', 'love', 'story', 'True', 'lived', 'character', 'became', 'profoundly', 'interesting', 'youthful', 'passion', 'became', 'inflamed', 'Creation', 'passion', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'actresses', 'director', 'capturing', 'subtleties', 'slowness', 'developing', 'love', 'pause', 'eye', 'contract', 'awakening', 'sexuality', 'orientation', 'leap', 'identity', 'took', 'dramatic', 'alteration', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'seemed', 'end', 'movie', 'transformation', 'still', 'somewhat', 'being', 'discovered', 'Sequels', 'can', 'fully', 'explore', 'sexual', 'identity', 'lesbian', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'who', 'person', 'sex.Sexuality', 'was', 'utilized', 'explain', 'showcase', 'passions', 'felt', 'contrast', 'other', 'love', 'affairs', 'especially', 'one', 'male', 'Not', 'everything', 'film', 'needs', 'be', 'imagined', 'sometimes', 'stark', 'portrayals', 'can', 'truly', 'take', 'audience', 'whats', 'going', 'get', 'be', 'completely', 'immersed', 'passions', 'seeing', 'sexuality', 'characters', 'can', 'therefore', 'not', 'only', 'understand', 'feel', 'more', 'character', 'spiritual', 'love', 'painful', 'anguish', 'desirous', 'passions', 'were', 'allowed', 'voyeuristically', 'step', 'bedroom', 'take', 'peak', 'relationship', 'was', 'unpredictable', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'exploited', 'sexuality', 'giving', 'more', 'thrill', 'yet', 'remained', 'controlled', 'holding', 'back', 'focusing', 'relationship', 'psychoanalysis', 'love', 'created', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters.A', 'world', 'delights', 'delectable', 'sensuality', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'regarding', 'sex', 'food', 'symbol', 'pleasure', 'see', 'side', 'characters', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'indulging', 'taking', 'real', 'genuine', 'sensual', 'satisfying', 'pleasure', 'eating.The', 'exquisite', 'philosophical', 'thought', 'provoking', 'literary', 'referenced', 'writing', 'coupled', 'unbelievably', 'believable', 'acting', 'portrayals', 'made', 'possibly', 'best', 'made', 'film', 'year', 'Philosophical', 'conversations', 'not', 'related', 'thrust', 'story', 'themes', 'such', 'comparison', 'male', 'vs', 'female', 'pleasure', 'gave', 'film', 'level', 'substance.It', 'was', 'very', 'long', '3', 'hours', 'were', 'left', 'wanting', 'literally', 'follow', 'main', 'protagonist', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'life', 'sequel', 'was', 'suggested', 'end', 'credits', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'see', 'more', 'well', 'made', 'explorations', 'subject', 'matters', 'following', 'amazing', 'actress', 'Further', 'learning', 'discovering', 'primordial', 'essence', 'witnessing', 'how', 'will', 'indulge', 'it.This', 'Blu-Ray', 'Must', 'Have']",N/A

It's a coming of age film that is like nothing I've ever seen. This is truly a beautiful movie. I almost can't even call this a film because it seemed so real. Honestly, I felt like I was standing right on the side seeing everything unfold in person. These two women give the most sincere and honest performances that I have ever seen. Adele Exarchopoulos gives the BEST female performance of 2013. She was seriously beyond great. Lea Seydoux was outstanding as well.Everything looked amazing; the camerawork and shots were something else. It added so much to the movie.

Tunisian born director Abdelatif Kechiche has shown some sensibility in previous movies (for instance Games of Love and Chance) but this Cannes festival winner feels quite exploitative (his previous movie, Black Venus, was also nasty, disappointing and sensationalistic). The young actresses who play the lead (Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos), who are not porn actresses, appear in very explicit, seemingly non simulated sex scenes (including masturbation, oral sex, fingering and doing the sex position popularly known as the 69). It would be interesting to wonder if a lesbian director (instead of a male director) would have filmed this story differently, perhaps less explicitly and more subtly. Interestingly, both actresses have complained after the film was released that they felt exploited during the filming and will not work with the director again.

1680091,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00GPPXNIK,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 8]","It seems like it&#8217;s been years since &#8216;Blue is the Warmest Color&#8217; was released, solely because there has been so much talk about this film since it premiered in Cannes last year.  Whether there be talk on the content, the explicit nature of the sex scenes, the tremendous performances by the stars, the shared Palm win or the tyranny on set (thanks to those candid interviews likening director Abdellatif to Hitler), there has not been a lack of talk surrounding this award winning drama.  So, to say that I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve FINALLY seen a film that was only released on DVD this week and only played in select theaters last October thanks to the subject, length and subtitles may seem odd and yet it doesn&#8217;t at the same time.  It feels like everyone has already seen this and I&#8217;m VERY late to the party.I&#8217;m glad I finally attended.I love that controversy continually surrounds the very best of films, because there are always going to be critics or self-proclaimed critics trying to degrade any film that is put on a pedestal.  It&#8217;s too long!  It&#8217;s too gay!  It&#8217;s too honest!  It&#8217;s too European!  The bottom line is that &#8216;Blue is the Warmest Color&#8217; is about as good as they come, and to pick it apart or place upon it unfair criticisms is to not fully understand the depths to which this film actually goes.  Yes, it is long and it is gay and it is honest and it&#8217;s European, but I have yet to see a complaint and feels like a detractor.Count me in!The basic premise here is quite simple (but it&#8217;s not).  Adele is a young girl living in France who is attending High School and trying to discover herself.  She tries dating boys, but she&#8217;s uninterested.  Then one day she happens to see a blue haired lesbian crossing the street and their eyes lock and she&#8217;s hooked.  She thinks about her all the time.  She abuses herself to the thought of her.  She eventually seeks her out in a curiosity infused visit to a gay bar and stumbles across her.  Her name is Emma, and she is equally attracted to the young Adele.  Despite being tepid about announcing her love affair to her friends and family, Adele jumps right in, engulfing Emma and everything she represents.  But love is tricky and never as smooth as we&#8217;d want it to be and as the years pass by and they settle into their life together, people, professions and insecurities begin to erode their happiness.I hate the criticism that surrounds this film and others like it.  I remember when &#8216;Brokeback Mountain&#8217; was being heralded as THE film of 2005 and all the naysayers were barking about how the only reason people find it interesting is because it is a gay story, and once you take out the gay the story becomes just another troubled love story.  Maybe the GAY aspect of the story is the point.  Maybe it isn&#8217;t supposed to be so different.  To me, this is such a lazy complaint.  A good story is a good story at the core, and a film like &#8216;Blue is the Warmest Color&#8217; reaches Bergman levels of blunt force honesty by dragging us to the depths of this love affair and actually developing a deeply moving portrait of love gained and lost.  Take away the gay aspect and you STILL have a powerful portrait of love gained and lost, but it is in those details that this becomes something so much more.Adele&#8217;s depiction as a girl unsure of her sexuality, ashamed almost, is a great plot point because it helps color in the fact that despite the forward steps made in the acceptance of the LGBT community, there are still so many stigmas attached to the idea of homosexuality.  Adele was frightened to embrace who she was, and it was that fear that caused her to make some foolish decisions, to hold back from being herself and ultimately lose out of what she wanted most.But it&#8217;s more than that.Strip away the gay aspect and you have a pretty rock solid depiction of a couple who has passed the point of mere infatuation and lust and moved into that area of subtle judgment.  You have the artistic and soulful Emma, older and surer of herself, who was initially attracted to the youthful innocence and high-minded ideals of Adele, but who has grown into quietly condemning her for being complacent in her life and not trying to be something Emma thinks she should be.  There is a moment when they are lying in bed and Emma tells Adele that she wishes she would do something that makes her happy and Adele says &#8220;I teach&#8221; and Lea tries to convince her that she should be a writer and then cops out by saying something like &#8220;but it&#8217;s up to you&#8221; and you can sense the judgmental mindset, the idea that Adele is beneath her because she&#8217;s not trying to be like her.  This isn&#8217;t uncommon in any relationship, and it is films like this that put a very familiar face on LGBT relationships, showing that they aren&#8217;t any different than the ones we are used to.We are all human beings.There are three people who made this film work so well, and it is a beautiful thing that they all share the Palm.  Director Abdellatif Kechiche may have been a terror to work with, but he pulled out so much raw emotion from his stars and depicted such a raw and tremendously honest portrait of love that I can&#8217;t help but applaud his methods, whatever they were.  His stars, Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux, are so committed to these performances that it is no surprise that they were heralded as two of the greatest performances of the year.  Exarchopoulos is so raw here that you can see every shade of innocence get stripped away from her as she discovers her new life.  Seydoux is far more comfortable, easing into every scene, but her moment in the caf&eacute; is a true testament to how well she built this character.  Her quiet breakdown in the midst of Adele&#8217;s more vocal one is so heartbreaking.And yes, there are some very explicit sex scenes here, but they are not gratuitous in the way that they were depicted as in some reviews.  These scenes are there to present us with a complete picture of how deeply invested in each other these two girls were, and that caf&eacute; scene really brings us back to that in a very strong and connective way.Such a powerful film!",5,Blue could be my new favorite color&#8230;,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,6313,"['8217', 'been', 'years', '8216', 'Blue', 'Warmest', 'Color', '8217', 'was',

She's an incredible presence on screen, and deserves an Academy Award for her work.The film follows Adele's life as a high school student through young adulthood. She wants to become a teacher and loves literature, and her family. Her sexual discoveries as a young woman reach a climax when she meets an older art student, played by Lea Sedoux. The film follows their relationship, through explicit sex scenes, intense arguments, and passionate embraces.Blue is the Warmest Color is in French, and many viewers will probably shy away because of the subtitles and running time.

Like most people I have been lost in that same arc in the real world and the acting and the writing here resonated so vividly that at times it almost had the directive feeling of a dream, where your memories are digested, reassembled and presented to you in a different symbolic form. Not many movies can do this, and I think one reason this movie had that kind of affect was because of the non-linear free format style of the presentation---something I see it has been criticized for. I love French movies and have watched a fair number of them, (this reminded me a bit of &#34;Waterlilly's&#34;) so this pacing and direction didn't surprise me, in fact I wouldn't have it any other way as I think it is essential in creating such a deep emotional and empathetic reaction as it helps to suspend the disbelief. I didn't feel I was being &#34;fed&#34; a plot, I felt I was an observant actor, creating pieces of the story myself, as I viewed the events. The result was a very immersive, and personal experience. At times I felt like grabbing Emma and yelling at her to forget about her career anxiety for a second and pay attention to her lover; and I also felt like screaming at Adele to stand up for herself!--use your ammunition, point out that Emma was unfaithful first, and she was the one alienating Adele--in other words &#34;she started it!&#34; Yet at the same time understanding how their relationship was doomed to have major issues because of their divergent interests and personalities (which quixotically can also make a relationship heart-breakingly precious), and like pretty much all of us they weren't prepared to deal with that monster.The performances are stunning, the real vehicle that makes this a special work of art. Both of the leading actresses are revelations (I am unfamiliar with them both), The sex scenes are graphic, but beautiful...This is one of those rare movies where the sex is actually presented realistically and not soft-core porn formulaic, so that it is actually essential to the movie.

From thefirst minutes director Abdellatif Kechiche fixes his camera on theprotagonist Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos), and never lets us take oureyes off her as she embarks on a voyage of discovery, both personal andsexual. The movie thus becomes extremely claustrophobic; we see Adele'sreactions to each and every situation, and share her pain as shediscovers her sexuality. Set in small-town France, the film exploreshow Adele and her girlfriend Emma (L&eacute;a Seydoux) try to continue theirpassionate relationship in a world where same-sex affairs are stillstigmatized. That knowledge inevitably affects the way in which Adeleand Emma react to one another. Emma comes across as unsympathetic, moreinterested in herself, her life and her career rather than her lovedones; but we can understand why she behaves in this way in a contextwhere success depends mostly on career achievement. Adele has not gotto that stage yet, but painful experiences - both at school and out ofschool - teach her to become more hardhearted, even if that feeling canonly be expressed through a noncommittal expression direct to camera.The film has explicit sex scenes, but they seem somehow remote, almostas if Adele and Emma are trying their best to achieve personalfulfillment through physical means.

1680110,A3TY54T5QG26ID,B00GPPXNIK,erdprod,"[6, 7]","There are spoilers in this review so don't read on if that bothers you.  This is a pro-lesbian film. If that bothers you don't read on.  This is not pornography, I was told by somewhat reliable sources that the women &#8220;wore things&#8221; so you're not seeing real girl on girl sex, just acting faking.  So I am told.  There is, however, a lot of female nudity and love making sequences.  This film is sub-titled, if that bothers you don't read on and don't see the film.  One problem with sub-titles is that you are so busy reading them that you don't watch the actors and French directors make their actors work with their eyes and faces.  So, you have to see this film enough to see their faces.  I first saw Lea Seydoux as the 'assassin who goes flying out the window' in &#8220;Ghost Protocol&#8221; the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible film.  What can I say, I fell in lover with her at first sight. I looked her up and there was this film about to go into theaters.  So I waited and it became available as a pre-order and I ordered it.  It will it sit on my shelf next to The Lover.  There were two &#8220;things&#8221; that raised eyebrows in 2013, one was &#8220;Fifty Shades of Grey&#8221; and the other was &#8220;Blue is the Warmest Color.&#8221;  It's about a 15 year old French high school girl who is discovering her own sexuality.  Her friends want her to be hetro.  She, however, see's this older woman with blue hair crossing the street and the two of them meet with their eyes and it's love at first sight.  Adele, the girl, has an affair with a guy who is a senior at school(she's a junior) and they go to bed and have sex but you can see she's not all that into it.  She has dreams of the woman with blue hair making love to her as she mastrubates and dreams.  At school she meets a girl who is curious but not comitted and they share kisses.  Later Adele see's her and goes to kiss her but finds out it was just a passing fancy.  For our young girl it was not.  She, like other students, goes to a crowded political gathering in the town square with union people and students.  One of her friends, a guy who is gay, takes her to a gay bar but she leaves and walks back to her house and passes a lesbian bar that she goes into just to 'see' what goes on.  In there she is confronted by the older woman with blue hair.  They chat.  The share a drink.  They part and the woman in Blue moves on with her friends while Adele goes home.  The woman in blue meets Adele near his school and the two walk away while Adele's friends call after her.  The woman does her portrait and they chat.  The woman says she's into 18 year olds and older (Adele is 15).  They part.  Adele is confronted by her &#8220;gal pals&#8221; who now thing she's a lesbian.  A &#8220;pussy eater.&#8221; She is confronted and gets into a fight and is osterized.  Adele meets up again with the Woman with the Blue Hair and Adele seduces her.  One of the men Adele crossed paths with in the male Gay Bar said:  &#8220;Love has no gender.&#8221;  That is what this movie about.  It's about a 15 year old girl trying to find out what she likes with a 30 year old who can get 5-20 years in jail for kissing the backside of a 15 year old girl or just being with her totally naked.  She goes to dinner at Emma's house and they have oysters.  Adeles doesn't like oysters (remember Tony Curtis in Kubrick's &#8220;Sparticus&#8221;? Emma goes to dinner at Adele's house after she turns 18 and they think Emma has a boyfrieind (they don't yet know about Adele).  Orgasmic!  Adele becomes Emma's &#8220;muse' and poses for her painting.  Even in the &#8220;gay world&#8221; Adele has a hard time being &#8220;suzie home maker &#8221; even in the gay world while she does learn to make spagettie from her parents. Adele moves in with Emma, who is a struggling professional artist and Adele is her model.  Adele is more in love with Emma than Emma is with herself and her art.  Slowly they fall apart.  Emma stays out late at night doing 'work'.  Adele takes up with a man from the pre-school where she works.  As a result of this affair Emma throws her out. Much later they meet at a restaurant.  Adele is now the Alpha Dog.  But the love between Adele and Emma is not let to be anymore.  Later Emma invites Adele to her exhibit.  There she meets a man from her past and they talk then part.  She leaves. He goes after her but doesn't know which way she went.  She walks home alone.  He just walks.  The film is about:  Discovery. Confusion.  Mistrust. Betrayal.  Hate.  There are people in this world who say Jewish people can't marry Gentiles.  Whites can't marry blacks.  Red Heads can't marry Brunettes.  You have to decide if you side with Hitler and his Master Race concept of if you let people be what they are and love who they choose.  It's up to all of you to decide and remember that others decide about YOU as well!  This is a fantastic film.  Watch the eyes.  Watch the faces and ignore the skin and nipples. This film is about YOUR ultimate freedom and if you don't get it someone, someday might get you!  Sorry, but that's ultimate reality!  This film won the Palm D'Or. Cannes Film Festival's greatest award. The award the Taxi Driver, Appoclipse Now and many other great films won.  This film is a great novel.  It is worth reading.  It is not easy reading.  You have to go beyond the bare skin, nipples and moans and look into their eyes past the sub-titles.  Afterall, it is a French film and they don't make films like American's make films!",5,Love At First Sight,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,5538,"['are', 'spoilers', 'review', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'read',

Perhaps it is because in France institutional religion does not have as much control over the expression of human biology to the extent it has control most everywhere else.What captivated me for nearly three hours was the amazing performance by Ad&egrave;le Exarchopoulos - kudos to her.

I must admit I was intrigued wondering what they are going to do with Adele and Emma. Two very different girls who come together. Adele is the protagonist, she is the definition of the word, cherubic. At times beautiful, within the first hour she becomes a family member in your living room, you can't help but understand her entirely and even empathise.Emma, on the other hand, has a mysterious smile with no fixed stare/gaze in her eyes. Her head is often tilted when she is studying Adele like a book. She has a gap in her teeth. She seems hurt but her behaviour despite her company is so stolid you will really keep thinking about just one thing, the title.More than 1/6th of the movie involves love making scenes. It makes you understand without meaning to perhaps but it does make you understand how women discover their sexuality. Almost every question you will have will be answered and the film will let you free.What I liked most about the film were the actors. The central character is this everyday cherubic girl who loves to eat foods. She isn't shy, she is just never easily impressed. Infact almost nothing impresses her in the whole film. She is curious but never over ambitious to prove anything to herself or anyone else around. She has many looks but just one mouth so you always know its her. When you finally see a genuine smile on her face in the film, you will say oh that's how she smiles. I am a 29 year old straight man who has been forever interested in the possibilities and endless angles of sexuality that exists in the female anatomy but maybe I am only saying this because now I know very vaguely what its about. I hope this will not give a wrong message to readers who are reading but this is the most under stated of films that will leave your world rocked.What I didn't like about the movie is how it just sort of leaves you and walks away with itself. I mean 3 hours into the film you fear you have a sense of entitlement (even though somewhere you know you don't) it just walks away.... But maybe that is what left me crestfallen and deeply missing both Emma and Adele.Emma is the character to watch out for.

With love comes happiness and security but when it is suddenly taken away from you there is only hollowness and despair.Adele is a high school senior pressured into having sex with boys to appease her nasty ""friends"". She enjoys it, but still feels that it is wrong. A split-second encounter in the street with blue-haired artist Emma leads to love at first sight and Adele can't get her out of her mind, fantasizing about her in bed at night. Lesbian urges grow inside her and she finally builds the courage to find Emma and falls head-over-heels in love with her.Adele's sexuality (and, by extension, Emma's too) causes problems with her school friends, her family (a scene in which she was disowned was unwisely cut from the final movie), and Emma's own circle. Her jealousy eventually leads to critical trust issues. It's a sin that everybody is guilty of at some point.Abdellatif Kechiche fills the movie with very long, following takes which highlight the mundane existence of Adele as she longs for love. The sex scenes are passionate and believable, punctuated with moans and gasps rather than music and are shot in realistic light which is not too unflattering. None of the actresses wear make-up, allowing their full range of facial expressions to show their true emotions, including messy, greasy hair. The sex scenes are nothing to get offended about, they are tasteful and honest and only a prude would object. Anyone taking the film seriously will find it hard to not be emotionally affected by them. But they are not pornographic.However I did find the ""food mouth"" close-up shots at the beginning to be a major turn-off.Blue is the Warmest Color is most certainly a film that will linger in your mind for a long time and will resonate, or maybe open old wounds, of people who have loved and lost. It's a very hard watch and not really a movie you can enjoy, but I'd sooner have this over anything starring Jennifer Aniston or Goldie Hawn's daughter.The Blu-ray sports a 2.35:1 picture that is good for the most part with lovely warm colors (HA!) but suffers from looking quite ""digital"" during the darker nighttime scenes. I will assume that this is a problem with the fake widescreen photography and loss of resolution with the cropping (the movie was shot with a Canon C300 which has a native ratio of 1.78:1 and then simply cropped to 2.35:1 in post-production, which is a lazy way of achieving the aspect ratio).

1680118,A1NVP0BM1ZZYNU,B00GPPXNIK,IntoMoYouKnow,"[2, 3]","Based on simply watching this 3-hour-long epic modern romance, you realize what a wonderois accomplishment of realism it is, and how unconcerned with sexuality it is, despite being a highly erotic and emotional roller-coaster. The film traverses around 10 years of time in the life of Adele, from ravenous teenaged high-schooler to wistful young adult schoolteacher, bookending the torrid romance she has with an older lesbian art student.  Theirs is a tender romance turned volatile over time as both come into their own, driven by a lust for knowledge and experiences, both individually and together.It is here where the controversies about the film's director and actresses begin to color how one looks at this film.  The male director clashed with his stunningly beautiful and totally committed actresses over graphic depictions of sexuality, which women have decried as unrealistic and male-oriented fantasy.  The power of two extended semi-pornographic sex scenes cannot be ignored, and yet with the criticism, become hard to view objectively or properly.  Wherever you fall in how to view these scenes, the work of the two actresses and the director elsewhere create a masterwork of human emotion, in which the two leads happen to be women.  Those who refuse to look past the gender of the two romantic leads need a few more LGBT people in their life, because it's a can't miss film.",4,A beautful film made uglier by controversy,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,1390,"['Based', 'simply', 'watching', '3-hour-long', 'epic', 'modern', 'romance', 'realize', 'what', 'wonderois', 'accomplishment', 'realism', 'how', 'unconcerned', 'sexuality', 'being', 'highly', 'erotic', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'film', '10', 'years', 'time', 'life', 'Adele', 'ravenous', 'teenaged', 'high-schooler', 'wistful', 'young', 'adult', 'schoolteacher', 'bookending', 'torrid', 'romance', 'older', 'lesbian', 'art', 'student', 'Theirs', 'tender', 'romance', 'turned', 'volatile', 'over', 'time', 'come', 'own', 'driven', 'lust', 'knowledge', 'experiences', 'individually', 'together.It', 'here', 'where', 'controversies', 'film', 'director', 'begin', 'color', 'how', 'one', 'film', 'male', 'director', 'clashed', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'totally', 'committed', 'actresses', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'sexuality', 'women', 'have', 'decried', 'unrealistic', 'male-oriented', 'fantasy', 'power', 'two', 'extended', 'semi-pornographic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'yet', 'criticism', 'become', 'hard', 'view', 'objectively', 'properly', 'Wherever', 'fall', 'how', 'view', 'scenes', 'work', 'two', 'actresses', 'director', 'elsewhere', 'create', 'masterwork', 'human', 'emotion', 'two', 'leads', 'happen', 'be', 'women', 'who', 'refuse', 'look', 'gender', 'two', 'romantic', 'leads', 'need', 'few', 'more', 'LGBT', 'people', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film']",N/A

1680120,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00GPPXNIK,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[90, 107]","A good romance in American cinema is surprisingly difficult to find because most films of a romantic nature are either romantic comedies or romantic melodramas. They're a dime a dozen. But every once in a great while, you get a film that not only casts off the rom-com or melodrama usually associated with a romance story, but actually draws you in to the relationship in such a mesmerizing way with smart and absorbing storytelling and unbelievably brilliant performances is one of the rarest things imaginable. Director Abdellatif Kechiche's BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is that film.Based on the wonderful award-winning graphic novel by Julie Maroh, BLUE is the story of Adele (Adele Excharopoulos), who begins the film as a naturally beautiful 15-year-old high school student who is just trying to do her best to stay uneaten in the feeding frenzy of adolescence. She keeps with her friends; she dates a cute boy; she pleases her working-class parents; she does well in school. But all that changes one day when she walks across a street, and sees Emma (Lea Seydoux), a haunting and beautiful older college student with dyed blue hair. They share a gaze, and in that instant, Adele is transfixed. She can barely move. She has really felt that thing we all look for: love at first sight. After losing her virginity with her boyfriend as an attempt to deny her ""abnormal"" feellings, she clearly doesn't feel the love and desire for him that she wants to, and breaks it off with him. Through a sequence of events, she has a chance meeting with Emma at a gay bar, and they become friends. The friendship clearly blossoms into something more, and their passions reach a fever pitch as they make love for the first time. They begin a relationship that is hidden from Adele's family and friends, but is open and accepted by Emma's. The relationship spans several years from Adele's student days and to her becoming a teacher of kindergarteners, and Emma changes from starving artist to toast of the town. But their relationship has problems. Despite the length of time they've spent together, they seem to be losing one another. Does love overcome, or is the passion of youth weighed down by the practicality of adulthood?When this film was presented with the Palme D'or, the highest award at the Cannes Film Festival, it wasn't just presented to director Kechiche, but also to leads Excharopoulos (this is her first major film role) and Seydoux (who some filmgoers might recognize from American films like MIDNIGHT IN PARIS or MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL) and the reasoning behind that is that they were all equal parts of what makes this film so remarkable. Kechiche directs the film using a lot of close-ups, allowing the audience very much in the lives and minds of the characters that inhabit the film. He also spares the audience any obvious artistic flourishes. There is barely any soundtrack to the film that isn't ambient sound from the settings within the film, so there are no music cues that instruct the audience how to feel. But Kechiche's skill behind the camera pales in comparison to what is possibly one of the most revelatory screen debuts I've ever seen, and that is from Excharopoulos, who so bares herself in both body and soul that it may be one of the singularly most immersive performances I've seen since Charlize Theron's amazing turn in MONSTER. Seydoux is as close to Excharopoulos's level as possible, which is an obvious challenge, but she plays the wiser, edgier and more experienced Emma close to perfection opposite Adele's wide-eyed, voracious youth, hungry for knowledge, experience and love.Both regretfully and triumphantly, the film's most talked-about sequence is a nearly 10-minute love scene between Adele and Emma which, while being graphic (but not unsimulated), is exciting, erotic, tender, a little clumsy, and beautiful. It gives the film its NC-17 rating, and I regret that it's the scene that most articles and reviews tend to bring up, but I also think it's a triumph because no one has talked this way about an NC-17 film since the film that effectively killed the rating being taken seriously, and that is Paul Verhoeven's SHOWGIRLS. Another thing that is brought up in regards to this film is the seemingly endless war of words between Kechiche and his two leads, but more than anything, that's just fodder for the gossip columns and not worth the time to remark on it any further.For fans of the graphic novel, there are certainly differences that will surprise and possibly disappoint them. A major plot point is dropped from this film in favor of something that seems more realistic, and that actually works in the film's favor, however, if how the film plays out is how it played out in the graphic novel, it would not have worked. It's best to think of them as two separate but equally amazing pieces of art that share a great deal, but one story works better in the graphic novel, and one works better in the film.To me, this is the most romantic film since Ang Lee's BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, and let me qualify that statement. Yes, they are both romance epics about same-sex love, but for whatever reason, I haven't seen another film between the masterpiece of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in 2005 and this film in 2013 that reflects what it truly feels to be in love, and is also so achingly beautiful and sad and heartfelt and real as we watch the relationship progress, flourish and disintegrate through time.BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is certainly one of the very best films of the year and possibly of the decade, and has what is certainly to be the two best female performances in recent years. I can only hope that Exarchopolous and Seydoux are remembered and rightfully recognized during Oscar season.",5,A breathtaking and monumentally powerful film with two of the best performances of

Clocking-in at three hours, I can't believe I watched this entire movie, in no small part to my own determination to finish something once I've crossed the half-way mark, aka the point of no return. This is to say I obviously hate myself because this movie is one of those supposedly high-minded art movies in which everything is supposed to a metaphor for something else; the color blue is a metaphor for the things about the world that confuse Adele, the gratuitous shots of Adele sleeping and dining with her family a metaphor for her existential angst, even the bloody spaghetti her parents make and she later prepares for Emma's friends is a metaphor! I don't usually mind symbolism, but I do mind being bludgeoned to death with it. But of course, that is not why any of us are watching this movie. Let's all stop pretending this is art and acknowledge that we're here for lesbian ""love"" scenes that are so graphic, you know that somewhere a 13 year old teenage boy was unable to call or text his friends and tell him what he's just discovered on [your choice of streaming video service]. Worse, the ""love"" scenes are the only time our protagonist, Adele, comes alive; she otherwise spends the entire movie being wishy-washy when she's not staring off into space with her vacant doe eyes which of course must also be a metaphor for something. Ultimately, the movie preys upon the viewer's own existential angst, leaving us with no resolution to the story and unable to reach through the screen to strangle the director for making this movie twice as long as it should have been.

It's a great movie but didn't hit me in a lot of the ways I expected it to nor in the same way many other 5-star films would. It also didn't really help that while the film started to (mostly) follow the book, it went way off in a different direction by the end and it also lost a lot of the book's moments which made it such an emotional gut punch for me.Despite the initial flaws like that, I wound up really enjoying the film for what it was: an honest look at a deep relationship over the span of years. If nothing else, the film is beautiful and well-made from a technical angle. It's a soft, subtle, yet very grounded-in-reality type of film that in many ways shows us how different we are when we're younger compared to how we are as we get older. The sex scenes that many talk about were very intense at times. While I've seen people talk about them as being almost downright pornographic, they really show multiple shifts in things throughout the film. First, when Adele has sex with a guy, it's short, sweet, and a little boring. When she's with Emma the first time, it's long and passionate, but subsequent scenes get shorter until they get to a point where they're in bed and just cuddling as opposed to having a lot of sex. To me, this was less about being pornographic and more about showing the loss of passion in their relationship, which was quite core to the story.While I've stated I had issues with how the movie detracted from the book, I also really like what they did at the same time. The emotional gut punches in the book might be gone, but in their place they expanded on the later parts of Adele's life. In the book, Adele (or Clementine as she's called in it) goes to dinner with Emma at her house like in the movie but in specific, her parents actually kick her out of the house in a very angry, heartbreaking scene. After that, there's only a few pages highlighting Adele's life afterwards, like meeting Emma's family, showing how she became a teacher, Emma getting a haircut, etc. but without elaborating on anything. Then suddenly we flash forward about 15 years to where she's now just about 30. Instead, the movie actually goes in depth with her becoming a teacher, going to Emma's art gatherings and art shows, and just her overall adult life. It was enjoyable and refreshing despite the lack of what I felt was the book's overall emotional intensity.My overall feelings are that this film is beautiful. It's a stellar movie with a great director and two daringly amazing leads, even if they had a lot of negative things to say about the director by the end of it all. It's a very real and down-to-earth film about love and loss. If you haven't read the book, it's worth watching all the same and is very much worth your time. If you have read the book, go in with a bit of caution in mind: it's not the same, but taken for what it is by itself it's still a fantastic film.4.5 Stars",4,"Despite detracting from the book, this is one amazing film.",1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,2970,"['sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '5-star', 'rating', 'want', 'great', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'lot', 'ways', 'expected', 'same', 'way', 'many', 'other', '5-star', 'films', 'would', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'film', 'started', 'mostly', 'follow', 'book', 'went', 'way', 'different', 'direction', 'end', 'also', 'lost', 'lot', 'book', 'moments', 'made', 'such', 'emotional', 'gut', 'punch', 'initial', 'flaws', 'wound', 'up', 'really', 'enjoying', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'honest', 'look', 'deep', 'relationship', 'span', 'years', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'beautiful', 'well-made', 'technical', 'angle', 'soft', 'subtle', 'yet', 'very', 'grounded-in-reality', 'type', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'how', 'different', 'are', 'when', ""'re"", 'younger', 'compared', 'how', 'are', 'get', 'older', 'sex', 'scenes', 'many', 'talk', 'were', 'very', 'intense', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'talk', 'being', 'almost', 'downright', 'pornographic', 'really', 'show', 'multiple', 'shifts', 'things', 'film', 'First', 'when', 'Adele', 'sex', 'guy', 'short', 'sweet', 'little', 'boring', 'When', 'Emma', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'passionate', 'subsequent', 'scenes', 'get', 'shorter', 'get', 'point', 'where', ""'re"", 'bed', 'just', 'cuddling', 'as', 'opposed', 'having', 'lot', 'sex', 'was', 'less', 'being', 'pornographic', 'more', 'showing', 'loss', 'passion', 'relationship', 'was', 'quite', 'core', 'story.While', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'had', 'issues', 'how', 'movie', 'detracted', 'book', 'also', 'really', 'what', 'did', 'same', 'time', 'emotional', 'gut', 'punches', 'book', 'might', 'be', 'gone', 'place', 'expanded', 'later', 'parts', 'Adele', 'life', 'book', 'Adele', 'Clementine', 'called', 'dinner', 'Emma', 'house', 'movie', 'specific', 'parents', 'actually', 'kick', 'house', 'very', 'angry', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'only', 'few', 'pages', 'highlighting', 'Adele', 'life', 'afterwards', 'meeting', 'Emma', 'family', 'showing', 'how', 'became', 'teacher', 'Emma', 'getting', 'haircut', 'etc', 'elaborating', 'anything', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'flash', 'forward', '15', 'years', 'where', 'now', 'just', '30', 'Instead', 'movie', 'actually', 'depth', 'becoming', 'teacher', 'going', 'Emma', 'art', 'gatherings', 'art', 'shows', 'just', 'overall', 'adult', 'life', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'refreshing', 'lack', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'book', 'overall', 'emotional', 'intensity.My', 'overall', 'feelings', 'are', 'film', 'beautiful', 'stellar', 'movie', 'great', 'director', 'two', 'daringly', 'amazing', 'leads', 'even', 'had', 'lot', 'negative', 'things', 'say', 'director', 'end', 'very', 'real', 'down-to-earth', 'film', 'love', 'loss', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'worth', 'watching', 'same', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'go', 'bit', 'caution', 'mind', 'not', 'same', 'taken', 'what', 'still', 'fantastic', 'film.4.5', 'Stars']",N/A

1680135,A3485K2A3Q814Z,B00GPPXNIK,Lemons,"[9, 11]","This Abdellatif Kechiche movie adaption of Julie Maroh's award winning 2010 graphic novel (which she started writing at 19), is an intensely intimate and heart wrenching account of a 15 year's rite of passage, culminating in an intense  relationship. Ad&egrave;le (Ad&egrave;le Excharpoulos) a diligent, nave virgin from a conservative working class family, is initially perplexed by her attraction to Emma (Lea Seydou) a worldly, openly gay college student, when she first notices her in the street. An unfulfilling encounter with an attractive older male student followed by nightly fantasies and curiosity drives her to seek out Emma in a gay bar.Deservedly, it won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, garnering awards for director and both lead actresses. Apparently Kechiche was heavily criticized for the working conditions and poor salaries to which he subjected his actors and crew, many of whom quit mid-way.  The two lead actresses said they will not work with him again, later tempering their criticism after basking in the glow of it's favorable reception. One can only speculate if it was Kechiche's brutal perfectionism that elevated this film from mediocrity into a sublime work of art. His obsessive close-ups of Ad&egrave;le transform her from lead actress to muse, echoing a theme in the story itself - that of Emma's muse. The story takes place over several years, hence the original title ""The Life of Ad&egrave;le - Chapters 1 & 2"".Without Ad&egrave;le herself being aware of it, we see her latent sensuality early on, greedily devouring spaghetti while making small talk with her parents. This will explode into the unbridled passion that Emma ignites in her. They become two sides of the same coin - Ad&egrave;le submissively nurturing and uninhibitedly physical, Emma intellectually controlling and ambitious. Their relationship is ultimately doomed. Ad&egrave;le is intimidated by and bored with Emma's highbrow friends and their existential philosophical debates; Emma is frustrated by Ad&egrave;le's ignorance and lack of ambition as a kindergarten teacher. But it is ultimately Emma's insecurity that is the undoing of this relationship. While being deeply in love with Emma, Ad&egrave;le is not emancipated enough to admit her sexual orientation to her colleagues and family, or to herself.The recurring theme of ""Blue"" - Emma's hair, Ad&egrave;le's bedsheets, the primary color of Emma's paintings of Ad&egrave;le, Ad&egrave;le floating in the sea, culminating in the final scene where Ad&egrave;le is wearing a bright blue dress - creates a silent visual counterpoint to the intense dialog and naked angst which dominates the film.Without a noticeable soundtrack, the audience is focused on the ecstasy and anguish of Ad&egrave;le and Emma's relationship. Their character development as the storyline progresses is subtle and finely nuanced.  Emma becomes more butch and pretentious, while Ad&egrave;le seeks the company of non-threatening peers, dabbling in heterosexual liaisons.  Where this film the has the edge over many of it's American counterparts, is that it draws the viewer in voyeuristically, while American films often sanitize or dilute raw emotion.I did not read the reviews before watching it. I wanted to form my own unbiased opinion of this Palme D'Or winner and Oscar nominee. I was therefore unprepared for the lengthy graphic unsimulated sex scenes - one of which commanded over 10 minutes of screen time. There were times that I was reminded of the soft porn movies of the 70s, particularly Emmanuelle. Only the French can convey such realism without it feeling gratuitous or dirty, although it did drag on a bit. In fact, at almost 3 hours, the movie itself wallowed self-indulgently, with endless close-ups of the naturally beautiful, pouty lipped, greasy haired Ad&egrave;le. Despite its length, it held my attention - there wasn't a single scene that didn't enrich the story in some way.  Nevertheless, relegating 45 minutes to the cutting room floor would not have hurt, particularly as the ending was so abrupt.It is undoubtedly one of the best films I have seen in a long time and should fare well at the Oscars, if the voters are not offended by the explicit nudity/sexual content vs the NC17 rating.

A decade later when I was old enough to see it for myself I seriously thought, Ho hum, I've had more exciting [and interesting] escalator rides. It didn't hold up very well, and I think Blue will find itself in a similar category as same sex relationships become more and more mainstream.Concerning the male gaze [oh those postmodernist feminists! ] during the sex scenes: the director is male, obviously, and his gaze is prevalent throughout as he focuses an inordinate amount of time on his heroine&#8212;as she sleeps [ mouth open], cries [ mouth open with snot], eats [ mouth open] , talks with food in [ open] mouth, thinks[ mouth open], plays endlessly with hair [ mouth open]. However  his favorite shot is not of the open mouth, but of her derriere&#8212;as she showers [ truly gratuitous], has sex, sleeps on stomach, checks herself out and finally in the multiple walking away shots. Clearly, it is his most beloved view. So that by the time we get to the sex, it is merely an extension of her other bodily functions and about as titillating.Only an actress as adorable as Adele E. could pull this off, and she really is great in her role: sweet, vulnerable, giving, loving, tormented, shamed, angry, confused and finally, at least in her work as a teacher, confident and fulfilled. Each time I'd  had about enough of  the movie, she would do something so touching that I couldn't help but like her and the film all over again.I cannot say the same for Lea Seydoux, who looks like the love child of Kate Moss and a blue lizard [ with her totally dead eyes that convey nothing] in a universe where meals are actually eaten. Her one expression is a sardonic smile, which she puts on whenever she sneers at the innocence of the infinitely more practical working class Adele while she, herself,  and her artsy friends drone on about the subject in the most banal terms ever put on film [ and judging from the results she couldn't sketch her way out of a paper bag]. But perhaps it was the directors intention to expose the pretentiousness of that crowd [?].As for the tenderness of first love, my understanding is that the author of the the graphic novel, Julie Maroh, had Adele kill herself at the end. Let me just say to young people who may be reading this: any lover, male or female, who is that disrespectful of one's chosen career and who allows the other to cook for his/her friends and then sits around afterward not helping while the other washes all the dishes by hand isn't worth the time of day, no matter how good the sex.Five stars for Adele Exarchopoulos' extraordinary performance, three for the rest of it--which should average to four, but I am bad at math.",3,"Last Tango for our times, three and a half stars",1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,2777,"['recall', 'huge', 'controversy', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'caused', 'elders', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'decade', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'see', 'seriously', 'thought', 'Ho', 'hum', ""'ve"", 'had', 'more', 'exciting', '[', 'interesting', ']', 'escalator', 'rides', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'Blue', 'will', 'find', 'similar', 'category', 'same', 'sex', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'mainstream.Concerning', 'male', 'gaze', '[', 'postmodernist', 'feminists', ']', 'sex', 'scenes', 'director', 'male', 'obviously', 'gaze', 'prevalent', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'heroine', '8212', '[', 'mouth', 'open', ']', '[', 'mouth', 'open', 'snot', ']', '[', 'mouth', 'open', ']', 'food', '[', 'open', ']', 'mouth', '[', 'mouth', 'open', ']', 'endlessly', 'hair', '[', 'mouth', 'open', ']', 'However', 'favorite', 'shot', 'not', 'open', 'mouth', 'derriere', '8212', '[', 'truly', 'gratuitous', ']', 'sex', 'sleeps', 'stomach', 'checks', 'out', 'finally', 'multiple', 'walking', 'away', 'shots', 'Clearly', 'most', 'beloved', 'view', 'time', 'get', 'sex', 'merely', 'extension', 'other', 'bodily', 'functions', 'titillating.Only', 'actress', 'as', 'adorable', 'Adele', 'E.', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'really', 'great', 'role', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'giving', 'loving', 'tormented', 'shamed', 'angry', 'confused', 'finally', 'least', 'work', 'teacher', 'confident', 'fulfilled', 'time', ""'d"", 'had', 'enough', 'movie', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'touching', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'film', 'again.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'Lea', 'Seydoux', 'who', 'love', 'child', 'Kate', 'Moss', 'blue', 'lizard', '[', 'totally', 'dead', 'eyes', 'convey', 'nothing', ']', 'universe', 'where', 'meals', 'are', 'actually', 'eaten', 'one', 'expression', 'sardonic', 'smile', 'whenever', 'innocence', 'infinitely', 'more', 'practical', 'working', 'class', 'Adele', 'artsy', 'friends', 'drone', 'subject', 'most', 'banal', 'terms', 'ever', 'put', 'film', '[', 'judging', 'results', 'could', ""n't"", 'sketch', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', ']', 'perhaps', 'was', 'directors', 'intention', 'expose', 'pretentiousness', 'crowd', '[', ']', '.As', 'tenderness', 'first', 'love', 'understanding', 'author', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Julie', 'Maroh', 'had', 'Adele', 'kill', 'end', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'reading', 'lover', 'male', 'female', 'who', 'disrespectful', 'one', 'chosen', 'career', 'who', 'allows', 'other', 'cook', 'his/her', 'friends', 'then', 'around', 'afterward', 'not', 'helping', 'other', 'washes', 'dishes', 'hand', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'day', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'sex.Five', 'stars', 'Adele', 'Exarchopoulos', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'three', 'rest', 'should', 'average', 'four', 'am', 'bad', 'math']",N/A

1680138,A79U01AE98EV8,B00GPPXNIK,MACLEAR,"[2, 6]","What may be suitable in pornography qua pornography is questionable and amounts to exploitation in mainstream films.  How tired I am of hearing actresses say, with a straight face and a touch of professional (if misplaced) pride that they will only submit to nudity &#34;if the script demands it&#34;.  The point too easily missed is that if the script demands nudity there is a fault in the script.  We do not need to see Romeo and Juliet have sex to know they have been intimate - the language makes it apparent.  I have yet to see a non-ponographic film in which nudity was called for.  Are we so bereft of imagination that we require seeing sex rather than conjuring it up ourselves or having the writer conjure it up in imagery, gestures, etc.?  I do not care what others say - this film stands or falls on the sex scenes - without them the film is pedestrian.  Nothing new is said.  Nothing that has been expressed before is here expressed better.  If I want to see two women flailing about in bed I know where to find it without the self-righteous blather about it having an integral part to play in the character's development.  This has nothing to do with Puritanism.  It has to do with calling &#34;sex as window dressing&#34; what it is.  Just once I would love to hear a director, producer, or actress come out and say what is patently obvious - &#34;I took my clothes off to sell tickets&#34; or &#34;I allowed my breasts to be exposed and fondled because my career needed a boost&#34; or even &#34;I can't act to save my life and subtlety is beyond me - so voila - I strip&#34; or, perhaps more cynically, &#34;The director told me I couldn't get the gig if I didn't spend half the picture in the buff&#34;.

1680149,A14SOHUCCL0606,B00GPPXNIK,Nowhere Man,"[14, 17]","This French film, the winner of the Palme d'or at the 2013 Cannes film festival, has been generating almost equal amounts of praise and controversy since its arrival stateside. Based on a graphic novel (unread by me), ""Blue"" charts out the stages of an intense romantic relationship between two young women - Adele, a working-class high school student, radiantly played by Adele Exarchopoulos, and a twenty-something middle-class art student, Emma (Lea Seydoux). Most of the controversy, which persists in many of the comments sections of other Amazon reviewers, centers on two fairly extended sex scenes that earned the film an NC-17 (although only a ""no one under 12 permitted"" rating in France).Most of the film is an introspective but passionate study of Adele: her hopes, desires, resentments, and, ultimately, sadness. Abdellatif Kechiche, the co-writer and director, spends a considerable amount of screen time focused on Exarchopoulos's face - and she *is* beautiful even if at first sight she seems awkward and nondescript. The courtship scenes with Seydoux, when the two circle each other warily, are delicately rendered. The tenderness shared between the two actresses feels so genuine that its no wonder that both shared in the Palme d'or with Kechiche. For the first hour or so, the film is every bit the masterpiece that so many have claimed it to be.But then the sex scenes take on a formal, almost clinical, tone that, at least for me, threw me out of the movie. Its as though another, more brusque, director took over. They don't reveal anything about the characters or their volatile emotions and are  designed instead to be provocative for their own sake. Maybe I was influenced too much from reading about Kechiche's difficult treatment of the two women on the set, but as I was watching these ""controversial"" scenes, I was thinking of them more as actresses trying to please their director than as their characters in the film. Aiming for extreme realism, Kechiche achieved more than he bargained for: having focused so much in the film's first hour on the characters' faces and their subtle emotional shifts, it seems like a horrible betrayal to spend the better part of ten minutes fixated on their derrieres. These sex scenes, and some of the later overextended sequences of Adele teaching in her classroom, tell us more about Kechiche's self-indulgence than the lives of his characters.Thus, I can't take this film to my heart as much as others have: Kechiche goes on too long and too far for no apparent reason (contrast this film with Eric Zonka's compact, masterly ""The Dreamlife of Angels"" from 1999 to see what I'm getting at). But the film's strengths are also undeniable. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux's performances are so finely nuanced that you start to feel the sadness encroaching at the slightest hint that they're drifting away from each other. The film is novelistic in its attention to detail and its careful rendering of place. And, even more, ""Blue"" is about how class divisions are replicated even in intimate life: Adele becomes painfully aware that she has neither the cultural background to keep up with Emma's art-school friends nor the interest in Emma's prodding her to become more than an elementary school teacher - a job at which she's quite contented to stay.""Blue,"" then, is a near-great (or semi-great) film. To dismiss it as simply a ""lesbian film"" (as if there was some problem with that) or an arty porn flick is to do it a great disservice. Flaws aside, the film beautifully modifies Tolstoy's famous dictum: all relationships are the same *and* are unique in themselves - both in how people come together and in the ways they break apart.While I'm sure Criterion's February 2014 DVD release will be sufficient for most people, diehards should know that a more deluxe edition will be released later in the year.",4,"Blue is the warmest color, but not the hottest....",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3867,"['French', 'film', 'winner', 'Palme', ""d'or"", '2013', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival', 'been', 'generating', 'almost', 'equal', 'amounts', 'praise', 'controversy', 'arrival', 'stateside', 'Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'unread', 'Blue', 'out', 'stages', 'intense', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'Adele', 'working-class', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'radiantly', 'played', 'Adele', 'Exarchopoulos', 'twenty-something', 'middle-class', 'art', 'student', 'Emma', 'Lea', 'Seydoux', 'Most', 'controversy', 'many', 'comments', 'sections', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'centers', 'two', 'fairly', 'extended', 'sex', 'scenes', 'earned', 'film', 'NC-17', 'only', 'one', '12', 'permitted', 'rating', 'France', '.Most', 'film', 'introspective', 'passionate', 'study', 'Adele', 'hopes', 'desires', 'resentments', 'ultimately', 'sadness', 'Abdellatif', 'Kechiche', 'co-writer', 'director', 'considerable', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'focused', 'Exarchopoulos', 'face', '*is*', 'beautiful', 'even', 'first', 'sight', 'awkward', 'nondescript', 'courtship', 'scenes', 'Seydoux', 'when', 'two', 'circle', 'other', 'warily', 'are', 'delicately', 'rendered', 'tenderness', 'shared', 'two', 'actresses', 'feels', 'so', 'genuine', 'wonder', 'shared', 'Palme', ""d'or"", 'Kechiche', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'bit', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'claimed', 'be.But', 'then', 'sex', 'scenes', 'take', 'formal', 'almost', 'clinical', 'tone', 'least', 'threw', 'movie', 'more', 'brusque', 'director', 'took', 'over', 'do', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'characters', 'volatile', 'emotions', 'are', 'designed', 'instead', 'be', 'provocative', 'own', 'sake', 'Maybe', 'was', 'influenced', 'too', 'much', 'reading', 'Kechiche', 'difficult', 'treatment', 'two', 'women', 'set', 'was', 'watching', 'controversial', 'scenes', 'was', 'thinking', 'more', 'actresses', 'trying', 'please', 'director', 'characters', 'film', 'Aiming', 'extreme', 'realism', 'Kechiche', 'achieved', 'more', 'bargained', 'having', 'focused', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'characters', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'shifts', 'horrible', 'betrayal', 'spend', 'better', 'part', 'ten', 'minutes', 'fixated', 'derrieres', 'sex', 'scenes', 'later', 'overextended', 'sequences', 'Adele', 'teaching', 'classroom', 'tell', 'more', 'Kechiche', 'self-indulgence', 'lives', 'characters.Thus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'film', 'heart', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'have', 'Kechiche', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'far', 'apparent', 'reason', 'contrast', 'film', 'Eric', 'Zonka', 'compact', 'masterly', 'Dreamlife', 'Angels', '1999', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'getting', 'film', 'strengths', 'are', 'also', 'undeniable', 'Exarchopoulos', 'Seydoux', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'start', 'feel', 'sadness', 'encroaching', 'slightest', 'hint', ""'re"", 'drifting', 'away', 'other', 'film', 'novelistic', 'attention', 'detail', 'careful', 'rendering', 'place', 'even', 'more', 'Blue', 'how', 'class', 'divisions', 'are', 'replicated', 'even', 'intimate', 'life', 'Adele', 'painfully', 'aware', 'cultural', 'background', 'keep', 'up', 'Emma', 'art-school', 'friends', 'interest', 'Emma', 'prodding', 'become', 'more', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'job', 'quite', 'contented', 'stay', 'Blue', 'then', 'near-great', 'semi-great', 'film', 'dismiss', 'simply', 'lesbian', 'film', 'was', 'problem', 'arty', 'porn', 'flick', 'do', 'great', 'disservice', 'Flaws', 'aside', 'film', 'beautifully', 'Tolstoy', 'famous', 'dictum', 'relationships', 'are', 'same', '*and*', 'are', 'unique', 'how', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'ways', 'break', 'apart.While', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Criterion', 'February', '2014', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'be', 'sufficient', 'most', 'people', 'diehards', 'should', 'know', 'more', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'later', 'year']",N/A

As the movie opens, we see Adele, who lives in Lille, taking the bus to school, getting through the day at school, clearly enjoying her French Lit class, where they are discussing Marivaux's ""The Life of Marianne"", having dinner with her mom and dad (it appears Adele is an only child), and turning in for bed, so that she can do it all over again the next day. Adele has a few dates with Thomas, a senior. At one point Adele briefly crosses paths with a girl who has blue streaks in her hair, and for Adele it is ""le coup de foudre"" (love at first sight). Adele even dreams about her but it isn't till much later that she runs into the girl at a gay bar. The girl's name is Emma, and even though Emma has been with another girl for 2 years, it isn't long before Adele and Emma fall for each other. At this point we are just over an hour into the movie. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, there is good reason this movie won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes festival: this is an epic relationship movie that will move you to your core (and perhaps also shock you). Let's immediately address the infamous sex scenes: yes, they are very graphic, so be forewarned. If you take offense to nudity, save yourself the trouble (and money), and go see another movie, seriously. Second, the acting performances are nothing short of monumental, none more so than Adele Exarchopoulos, in the title role. Surely this will get Oscar Best Actress consideration. Considering she is only 19 years, the sky is the limit for this talented actress. L&eacute;a Seydoux in the role of Emma is quite good too, but clearly in the shadows of Exarchopoulos. Third, I was amazed at how quickly this film flew by. It must be that I was so absorbed by how Adele's life is unfolding on the screen that I completely lost track of time (this isn't giving anything away, but the events in the movie play out over a number of years). Due to the sheer length of the movie and the graphic nudity, this movie clearly isn't for anyone, so be honest with yourself whether this is something worth checking out (if Iron Man 3 is your favorite movie of the year, this is likely not for you).Last, if you wonder how Jean-Paul Sartre and Bob Marley are more similar than you ever imagined, just watch! The movie will explain all.I had seen the trailer a couple of times and couldn't wait to see this. It finally opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati (on 2 screens even, a rarity), and I went to see it today. The matinee screening wasn't particularly well attended, but when I left the movie theatre, a long line had formed at the box office for the evening show. The movie's credits including the movie's title appear only at the end, so I was quite surprised that the original French title makes a reference to ""Chapter 1 and 2"", which seems to indicate that we may not have seen the very last of ""the life of Adele"", which would be great news indeed. If you are interested in a quality foreign movie that is conversation-driven and examines relationships (including some graphic sex), you cannot go wrong with this. ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY BRECOMMENDED!",4,4.5 stars...

While this epic didn&#8217;t blow me away as Weekend did, it certainly was a fascinating, intelligent work that justifies its 3-hour length on an intellectual level, even if not an emotional one. This ambitious work is some parts love story, some parts change-over-time, and mostly a coming-of-age tale of a young woman in modern-day France.This bulky work is best looked at through its two distinct halves: the first of main character Adele as a high school youth, and the second of Adele as a young woman, having become a teacher and coming into her own. There is a fascinating parallel between the two - Adele seen as a student, learning from others, and then as a teacher herself, passing along wisdom rather than receiving it from mentor figures.From the very beginning, we get a strong sense of intimacy by the sheer closeness of each shot; each character is right against the camera, making us feel like we are right next to them, nearly feeling their breath. Each character is also shot in isolation, giving one moment (nearly 45 minutes into the film) of two characters in the same shot that much greater of impact.The love story is a sweet and believable one, as we are drawn to the allure, charm, and intelligence of the artistic Emma just as Adele is. Even their first real meeting, after-hours at a lesbian bar, ties back to Adele&#8217;s school lessons of philosophy; earlier in the film, her teacher mentions the struggle between chance and fate/predestination. When Emma asks what brought Adele to the bar, however, Adele brushes it off as &#8220;by chance,&#8221; though neither Emma nor we believe that for a moment.The romance that ensues, much like the also-excellent Her, is an insightful, poignant tale of love, jealousy, and obsession. With the lengthy running time a film like this has, we clock in enough time in the relationship to feel the trauma and rough waters that Emma and Adele face.The brilliant subtext of art and philosophy provides a very satisfying finale to the film. Emma&#8217;s gallery of artwork is full of models (all loved ones) in her life, and, even years later, Adele is still part of it. In a similar vein to Her, which argues that our relationships build us into who we are, Blue is the Warmest Color addresses our projected identities and how we share these pieces of ourselves with the world, and embrace these reflections.All in all, though, I see this movie less of a romance and more of a coming-of-age story. Any young adult goes through an incredibly impressionable period where a singular person, or way of life, can completely transform your way of life and your outlook, and this film puts all of these together into one personification, Emma.Blue is the Warmest Color is a sometimes joyful, sometimes heartbreaking, exploration of identity and the sacrifices necessary to achieve that.",4,"Moving, insightful coming-of-age story",1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,2985,"['breakout', '2013', 'film', 'Blue', 'Warmest', 'Color', 'been', 'lauded', 'one', 'most', 'passionate', 'devastating', 'love', 'stories', 'recent', 'memory', 'epic', 'didn', '8217', 'blow', 'away', 'Weekend', 'did', 'certainly', 'was', 'fascinating', 'intelligent', 'work', '3-hour', 'length', 'intellectual', 'level', 'even', 'not', 'emotional', 'one', 'ambitious', 'work', 'parts', 'love', 'story', 'parts', 'change-over-time', 'mostly', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'modern-day', 'France.This', 'bulky', 'work', 'best', 'looked', 'two', 'distinct', 'halves', 'first', 'main', 'character', 'Adele', 'high', 'school', 'youth', 'second', 'Adele', 'young', 'woman', 'having', 'become', 'teacher', 'coming', 'own', 'fascinating', 'parallel', 'two', 'Adele', 'seen', 'student', 'learning', 'others', 'then', 'teacher', 'passing', 'along', 'wisdom', 'rather', 'receiving', 'mentor', 'very', 'beginning', 'get', 'strong', 'sense', 'intimacy', 'sheer', 'closeness', 'shot', 'character', 'right', 'camera', 'making', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'next', 'nearly', 'feeling', 'breath', 'character', 'also', 'shot', 'isolation', 'giving', 'one', 'moment', 'nearly', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'two', 'characters', 'same', 'shot', 'much', 'greater', 'impact.The', 'love', 'story', 'sweet', 'believable', 'one', 'are', 'drawn', 'allure', 'charm', 'intelligence', 'artistic', 'Emma', 'just', 'Adele', 'Even', 'first', 'real', 'meeting', 'after-hours', 'lesbian', 'bar', 'back', 'Adele', '8217', 's', 'school', 'lessons', 'philosophy', 'earlier', 'film', 'teacher', 'struggle', 'chance', 'fate/predestination', 'When', 'Emma', 'what', 'brought', 'Adele', 'bar', 'however', 'Adele', 'off', '8220', 'chance', '8221', 'Emma', 'believe', 'moment.The', 'romance', 'much', 'also-excellent', 'Her', 'insightful', 'poignant', 'tale', 'love', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'lengthy', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'clock', 'enough', 'time', 'relationship', 'feel', 'trauma', 'rough', 'waters', 'Emma', 'Adele', 'face.The', 'brilliant', 'subtext', 'art', 'philosophy', 'very', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'film', 'Emma', '8217', 's', 'gallery', 'artwork', 'full', 'models', 'loved', 'ones', 'life', 'even', 'years', 'later', 'Adele', 'still', 'part', 'similar', 'vein', 'Her', 'relationships', 'build', 'who', 'are', 'Blue', 'Warmest', 'Color', 'projected', 'identities', 'how', 'share', 'pieces', 'ourselves', 'world', 'embrace', 'reflections.All', 'see', 'movie', 'less', 'romance', 'more', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'young', 'adult', 'incredibly', 'impressionable', 'period', 'where', 'singular', 'person', 'way', 'life', 'can', 'completely', 'transform', 'way', 'life', 'outlook', 'film', 'together', 'one', 'personification', 'Emma.Blue', 'Warmest', 'Color', 'sometimes', 'joyful', 'sometimes', 'heartbreaking', 'exploration', 'identity', 'sacrifices', 'necessary', 'achieve']",N/A

1680171,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00GPPXNIK,Turfseer,"[11, 18]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0Okay I'm generalizing, but in so many cases, If you're looking for an intense film about relationships, French films trump American ones, because the French just seem inherently to be the experts when it comes to love and passion. French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche's intimate dissection of a romance between two young women is no exception. His film won the Palme d'Or, the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. This was the first time a director and two actresses collectively received the award--by a panel led by such film industry luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and director Ang Lee.The film features a smashing performance by Ad&egrave;le Exarchopoulos who has the same first name as the film's protagonist. When we first meet Ad&egrave;le, she's a high school student confused about her sexual identity. She sees a young blue haired woman on the streets and has dreams about her. Prodded by her gossipy classmates, she has a brief, unsatisfactory relationship with a boy, but soon breaks up with him after an encounter with a female classmate, who first kisses her on the steps outside of the school. The female classmate tells her that she wasn't serious about the encounter but Ad&egrave;le is taken to a gay bar by a male gay friend but she soon wanders off to a lesbian bar, where she meets the blue-haired woman she had seen out on the streets earlier.The young blue-haired woman is Emma (played by an equally intense L&eacute;a Seydoux), an older art graduate student. They begin a steamy affair, culminating in a series of explicit sex scenes which has garnered quite a bit of publicity for the film. The second Act occurs after a passage of time--now Emma is trying to break into the art world as a professional artist and Ad&egrave;le has begun a job as a kindergarten teacher. Director Kechiche pulls out all the stops in depicting the burgeoning romance between the two women.The problem with much of it is that it's just too drawn out. That not only includes the sex scenes but other scenes such as when the each women meets one another's parents (Emma's upper middle class parents know that she's gay and are immediately accepting of Ad&egrave;le; but Ad&egrave;le's lower middle-class parents are left in the dark as to the nature of their relationship). Mr. Kechiche can't resist closeups of each character discussing how much they enjoy the pasta they're eating. Another earlier scene, where Emma and Ad&egrave;le engage in a long intellectual discussion about Sartre and other sundry topics on a park bench, also seems to go on and on.But I was grudgingly willing to put up with the incredibly drawn out spectacle to see what the final outcome of the relationship was between the two lovers. Before the final blowup, cracks in the facade of the relationship, begin to emerge. Ad&egrave;le, working much more simply with children, begins to feel out of place in Emma's more sophisticated world of art professionals. Finally, with Emma spending more time in the art world, Ad&egrave;le has a brief fling with a guy, a fellow male co-worker from her job at the school. Emma finally figures out that Ad&egrave;le has been cheating on her and she flips out. She throws Ad&egrave;le out of her house and tells she never wants to see her again. I like how Emma was depicted in the scene where she dumps Ad&egrave;le, as her lack of flexibility and unwillingness to forgive the vulnerable Ad&egrave;le, showed her to be cold and overly controlling. In other words, there's a multi-dimensionality to the character.The rest of the film I would say is anti-climactic. Some years pass and Ad&egrave;le spends a good deal of time by herself, trying to get over her relationship with Emma, but not quite doing so. She finally meets with Emma after quite a bit of time has gone by, who ostensibly has forgiven her. Ad&egrave;le attempts to force herself on Emma in a restaurant but Emma is now committed to another woman and rejects her. Flash forward again--Emma invites Ad&egrave;le to her art exhibition, where Ad&egrave;le finally accepts the fact that Emma has moved on. Her run in with the actor (who's now a real estate agent) doesn't seem to go anywhere.'Blue' is a three hour movie but it probably could have been more effective with 45 minutes of less footage. I wonder if the sex scenes were pared down, the film would have garnered as much publicity as it did. The end of filming was not the end to the controversy. Not only did union members complain about director Kechiche over working them but Exarchopoulos and Seydoux indicated that they never wanted to work with Kechiche again as they indicated that he treated them roughly while shooting the film.. Seydoux went as far as saying that she felt like a ""prostitute"" during the film shoot. Kechiche was offended by his actors' comments and at one point was quoted as saying that he hoped the film would not be released. There was also talk that Kechiche was going to sue Seydoux for her comments.Probably both parties overreacted. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux knew what kind of film they were getting into, when they signed the contract to act in it and they probably should have known Kechiche was a perfectionist. On the other hand, Kechiche perhaps should have taken into account his actors' sensibilities and directed them a little more gently.All in all, 'Blue is the warmest color', is a well-made film which captures the intensity of the intense relationship between two young women, who ultimately were not right for each other. The film needed to flow better and the editing was just not there. If you're willing to put up with the film's overall length, you will still be rewarded with some phenomenal acting and intense dissection of a relationship that ran its course.",3,Excellent dissection

1680172,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B00GPPXNIK,Willy D. Reviewer,"[5, 15]","The Worst Part: The French have never heard of a Film Editor.  This 3 hour movie could have easily been cut down to 90 min. without losing one important scene or plot point.The Cannes Film Festival Best Part:  The lesbian graphic sex scenes. But not simply because of the sex, but because mainstream actress Lea Seydoux was willing to &#34;play it for real&#34;.  She erased any doubt in your mind that she was acting.  Now that's dedication.The Bad Part:  She and Adele Exarchopoulos were sabotaged while doing the sex scenes.  We, the audience, are suppose to be watching very intimate moments between two females alone in their room -- then why does the camera jiggle?  Because there is a cinematographer in the room filming the scenes.  Set the camera on a tripod and get the hell out of the room!  Very annoying and distracting.The Dull Part:  The plot.  Teen girl meets college girl.  They fall in lust.  Teen girl sexually betrays college girl.  Teen girl loses college girl.  The End.The French love drama, drama, drama.  They hate &#34;Hollywood Endings&#34; -- read happy endings -- therefore, you watch their dramas and leave the theater depressed.  This movie would have been so much better and more enlightening if the girls had fallen in love and not simply lust, if they had bonded.  If Mr. Kechiche had given us a movie about two girls meeting, falling in love, and each becoming stronger -- becoming more than the sum of their parts -- who only had hearts for each other and whose lives became fulfilling because of this bond . . .

The famed scenes of physical affection seem entirely at home in this context. The relationship is hot and intense in every way, and I think the imagery supports that very appropriately.But, despite the visual appeal of the leading ladies, this lies away from what I look for in movies. The breakup carried a gut-wrenching sense of reality, and what came after sounded mostly like rubbing salt in self-inflicted wounds. I can imagine many people appreciating the reality of it, but I mostly just found it painful.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters",3,"Attractive, but not really my thing.",1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,747,"['core', 'really', 'heat', 'first', 'love', 'combined', 'poor', 'choices', 'teenagers', 'disastrous', 'combination', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'experienced', 'one', 'way', 'famed', 'scenes', 'physical', 'affection', 'seem', 'entirely', 'home', 'context', 'relationship', 'hot', 'intense', 'way', 'think', 'imagery', 'very', 'appropriately.But', 'visual', 'appeal', 'leading', 'ladies', 'away', 'what', 'look', 'movies', 'breakup', 'carried', 'gut-wrenching', 'sense', 'reality', 'what', 'came', 'sounded', 'mostly', 'rubbing', 'salt', 'self-inflicted', 'wounds', 'can', 'imagine', 'many', 'people', 'appreciating', 'reality', 'mostly', 'just', 'found', 'painful.', 'wiredweird', 'reviewing', 'release', 'theaters']",N/A
1680174,A1WM5FNKKVRAQ2,B00GPPXNIK,YAC,"[3, 6]","I did not realize it was in French, however I did enjoy the movie.  I thought it realistic and the acting, especially by the lead character Adele, was very good.  First love is always tough for the novice, let alone realizing you're gay.  It's a little long (3 hrs.) but you get to know Adele better.  They say 1 is the loneliest number, but that 2 can be as bad as 1 - so I believe this is the case ultimately with Adele.  Her immaturity and starry-eye love for Emma results in unsatisfactory consequences.  You may not like the film but it is thought provoking at the very least.  In my opinion, Emma was never really in love with her - hence the feeling of isolation by Adele.  The film cannot be compared to Elena Undone which is my #1 favorite concerning the subject matter.  It's apples and oranges.  One is about seasoned, matured adults (read ROMANTIC) whereas this film is about a very young girl facing her attraction to women and falling in love with a young but experienced female.  I differ in opinion with a friend who felt the sex scenes a little raw.  I disagreed and said get over it and remember when you were much, much younger!!!  Both have lovely bodies and the sex scenes are explicit.  After all it is what two women do sexually.  I would have preferred more sensuality and affectionate verbalizing, but you can't have everything bundled up into one package.  Otherwise, direct it yourself!!",4,Remember when...........,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,1414,"['did', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'French', 'however', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'thought', 'realistic', 'acting', 'especially', 'lead', 'character', 'Adele', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'First', 'love', 'always', 'tough', 'novice', 'let', 'alone', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'gay', 'little', 'long', '3', 'hrs', 'get', 'know', 'Adele', 'better', 'say', '1', 'loneliest', 'number', '2', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'bad', '1', 'so', 'believe', 'case', 'ultimately', 'Adele', 'immaturity', 'starry-eye', 'love', 'Emma', 'results', 'unsatisfactory', 'consequences', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'thought', 'provoking', 'very', 'least', 'opinion', 'Emma', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'love', 'hence', 'feeling', 'isolation', 'Adele', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'Elena', 'Undone', '1', 'favorite', 'concerning', 'subject', 'matter', 'apples', 'oranges', 'One', 'about', 'seasoned', 'matured', 'adults', 'read', 'ROMANTIC', 'whereas', 'film', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'facing', 'attraction', 'women', 'falling', 'love', 'young', 'experienced', 'female', 'differ', 'opinion', 'friend', 'who', 'felt', 'sex', 'little', 'raw', 'disagreed', 'said', 'get', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'much', 'much', 'younger', 'have', 'lovely', 'bodies', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'explicit', 'what', 'two', 'women', 'do', 'sexually', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'sensuality', 'affectionate', 'verbalizing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'bundled', 'up', 'one', 'package', 'Otherwise', 'direct']",N/A

1680176,A3B26C1WRMBEAC,B00GPPXNIK,Zoe Marr,"[9, 11]","&#34;Blue is the Warmest Color&#34; was my favorite film of 2013 and the best movie I've seen in years. This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Steven Spielberg told Adele Exarchopoulos it was the best love story he'd ever seen. I wouldn't doubt it, I can't think of a film that more realistically and honestly depicts the nature of love, which looks the same no matter what the orientation of its players. Two of the bravest and most memorable performances I can remember... Adele Exarchopoulos is the birth of a genius onscreen. Seydoux is also evenly matched with respect to her degree of talent. Director Abdellatif Kechiche leaves you spellbound for the whole movie. Controversy aside, this movie is worth seeing for far more than its NC-17 content and I think audiences will be surprised by the depth of the surrounding material. It's odd that the sex scenes have become such a point of discussion and speaks to cultural hangups more than anything else. Those scenes comprise less than 10 minutes of the 3-hour film, which is in essence the story of growing up and experiencing first love, and the rollercoaster ride that accompanies it. This film is ambitious in its scope and I have yet to see several of the scenes in this film play out in other movies. Truly, some of the best onscreen chemistry and commitment I've seen performers give. They are at 150% the whole way through and there isn't a moment where any of it feels contrived, which isn't suprising given that the actresses improvised most of the film.This film isn't for everyone; it is 3 hours long, French with subtitles, sex and nudity (which I feel is justified), and it is what I'd call a slice-of-life minimalist film, if that isn't your cup of tea you may want to look elsewhere but personally, this film is a treasure and I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. This film speaks truth, and you can't ask for much more with respect to the magic that transpires on screen and the perfect trifecta of artists that are Kechiche, Seydoux, and Exarchopoulos who won the first ever triple Palm d'Or at Cannes for this very reason. Spielberg mentioned if this movie was as much as 3% different in any aspect it wouldn't have worked, I agree it was just the right amount of everything, you can't lose with these three onboard. This film has been recognized internationally for its brilliance, made most critics top 10 list for the year, and was largely snubbed at US awards shows for political reasons, which is unfortunate. For the curious, this film is not a political commentary, but rather a story of two people who find one another and journey. And a worthy journey it is! I do believe this film will one day be seen as a classic. It is a very special and singular film.Note: This Criterion Edition DVD is just the movie, if you are waiting for the additional 40 minutes the director plans on including in his Director's Cut version (also a future Criterion edition) you may want to hold out on buying this now.",5,"It's Not Just Hype, folks...",1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,2982,"['34', 'Blue', 'Warmest', 'Color', '34', 'was', 'favorite', 'film', '2013', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'movie', 'nothing', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'told', 'Adele', 'Exarchopoulos', 'was', 'best', 'love', 'story', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'would', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'more', 'realistically', 'honestly', 'nature', 'love', 'same', 'matter', 'what', 'orientation', 'players', 'Two', 'bravest', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'can', 'remember', 'Adele', 'Exarchopoulos', 'birth', 'genius', 'onscreen', 'Seydoux', 'also', 'evenly', 'matched', 'respect', 'degree', 'talent', 'Director', 'Abdellatif', 'Kechiche', 'spellbound', 'whole', 'movie', 'Controversy', 'aside', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'far', 'more', 'NC-17', 'content', 'think', 'audiences', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'depth', 'surrounding', 'material', 'odd', 'sex', 'scenes', 'have', 'become', 'point', 'discussion', 'speaks', 'cultural', 'hangups', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'scenes', 'comprise', 'less', '10', 'minutes', '3-hour', 'film', 'essence', 'story', 'growing', 'up', 'experiencing', 'first', 'love', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'film', 'ambitious', 'scope', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'other', 'movies', 'Truly', 'best', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'commitment', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'performers', 'give', 'are', '150', '%', 'whole', 'way', ""n't"", 'moment', 'where', 'contrived', ""n't"", 'suprising', 'given', 'actresses', 'improvised', 'most', 'film.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'everyone', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'French', 'subtitles', 'sex', 'nudity', 'feel', 'justified', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'slice-of-life', 'minimalist', 'film', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'personally', 'film', 'treasure', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'stumbled', 'film', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'respect', 'magic', 'screen', 'perfect', 'trifecta', 'artists', 'are', 'Kechiche', 'Seydoux', 'Exarchopoulos', 'who', 'won', 'first', 'ever', 'triple', 'Palm', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'very', 'reason', 'Spielberg', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'much', '3', '%', 'different', 'aspect', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'agree', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'everything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'three', 'onboard', 'film', 'been', 'recognized', 'internationally', 'brilliance', 'made', 'most', 'critics', 'top', '10', 'list', 'year', 'was', 'largely', 'snubbed', 'US', 'awards', 'political', 'reasons', 'unfortunate', 'curious', 'film', 'not', 'political', 'commentary', 'rather', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'one', 'journey', 'worthy', 'journey', 'do', 'believe', 'film', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'seen', 'classic', 'very', 'special', 'singular', 'film.Note', 'Criterion', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'just', 'movie', 'are', 'waiting', 'additional', '40', 'minutes', 'director', 'plans', 'including', 'Director', 'Cut', 'version', 'also', 'future', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'may', 'want', 'hold', 'out', 'buying', 'now']",N/A
