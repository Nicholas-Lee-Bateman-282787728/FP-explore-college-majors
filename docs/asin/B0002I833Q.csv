834475,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0002I833Q,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[61, 61]","With a marvelous and for the most part accurate script based on historical documents (though embellished with ""certain composite and representative scenes and characters""), Lionel Chetwynd has written a compelling drama about General Eisenhower and the planning of the D-Day invasion, with thoughtful and well paced direction by Robert Harmon, and a superb performance by Tom Selleck, who captures Eisenhower's strength, manly charisma, and many of the subtle mannerisms reminding me of this hero of mine since youth.The cinematography by David Gribble is wonderful, and the atmospheric score by Jeff Beal also adds much to the film.Filmed in New Zealand in less than 3 weeks, the terrific cast is mostly from Australia and New Zealand (with exceptions like Timothy Bottoms, excellent as Eisenhower's Chief of Staff Walter Bedell Smith); stellar among them is Ian Mune who plays Churchill. Others include Bruce Phillips as General Montgomery, and George Shevtsov as Charles DeGaulle, in a scene where DeGaulle displays such arrogance towards Eisenhower that it will vex those of us who remember and honor the American blood left on French soil.This is far from a wartime action film; it is sometimes sober and introspective, and always fascinating, with the intricacy of the planning for D-Day, and the many characters and huge egos involved, some upset by Eisenhower's insistence of being the Supreme Commander, always holding one's attention. The expectation of the massive casualties for D-Day makes one wonder how this type of operation would be viewed in today's media age, where long-term objectives are rarely considered. Eisenhower in addressing King George VI (Mick Rose) on the king's fear of expected losses says ""...but if they do not offer the sacrifice of blood now, we will all pay dearly with added gallons later. So if some must die, it is in a worthy cause"".This production for the A & E Network makes perfect viewing for a day like Veteran's Day, to honor the lives of those who have died so heroically for our freedoms. Total time is 2 hours, and the main DVD ""Extra"" is an interesting interview with writer Chetwynd (who also produced/wrote the excellent ""DC 9/11: Time of Crisis"") and director Harmon; both speak of how Selleck has some of Eisenhower's admirable characteristics, and Selleck, who tells how as a non-smoker, he played a man with a 4 pack a day habit.",5,"on freeing ""a world gone half mad""",1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,2388,"['marvelous', 'most', 'part', 'accurate', 'script', 'based', 'historical', 'documents', 'embellished', 'certain', 'composite', 'representative', 'scenes', 'characters', 'Lionel', 'Chetwynd', 'written', 'compelling', 'drama', 'General', 'Eisenhower', 'planning', 'D-Day', 'invasion', 'thoughtful', 'well', 'paced', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Harmon', 'superb', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'who', 'Eisenhower', 'strength', 'manly', 'charisma', 'many', 'subtle', 'mannerisms', 'reminding', 'hero', 'mine', 'youth.The', 'cinematography', 'David', 'Gribble', 'wonderful', 'atmospheric', 'score', 'Jeff', 'Beal', 'also', 'much', 'film.Filmed', 'New', 'Zealand', 'less', '3', 'weeks', 'terrific', 'cast', 'mostly', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'exceptions', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'excellent', 'Eisenhower', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Walter', 'Bedell', 'Smith', 'stellar', 'Ian', 'Mune', 'who', 'Churchill', 'Others', 'include', 'Bruce', 'Phillips', 'General', 'Montgomery', 'George', 'Shevtsov', 'Charles', 'DeGaulle', 'scene', 'where', 'DeGaulle', 'displays', 'such', 'arrogance', 'towards', 'Eisenhower', 'will', 'vex', 'who', 'remember', 'honor', 'American', 'blood', 'left', 'French', 'soil.This', 'far', 'wartime', 'action', 'film', 'sometimes', 'sober', 'introspective', 'always', 'fascinating', 'intricacy', 'planning', 'D-Day', 'many', 'characters', 'huge', 'egos', 'involved', 'upset', 'Eisenhower', 'insistence', 'being', 'Supreme', 'Commander', 'always', 'holding', 'one', 'attention', 'expectation', 'massive', 'casualties', 'D-Day', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'type', 'operation', 'would', 'be', 'viewed', 'today', 'media', 'age', 'where', 'long-term', 'objectives', 'are', 'rarely', 'considered', 'Eisenhower', 'addressing', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'Mick', 'Rose', 'king', 'fear', 'expected', 'losses', 'do', 'not', 'offer', 'sacrifice', 'blood', 'now', 'will', 'pay', 'dearly', 'added', 'gallons', 'later', 'must', 'die', 'worthy', 'cause', 'production', 'A', 'E', 'Network', 'perfect', 'viewing', 'day', 'Veteran', 'Day', 'honor', 'lives', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'so', 'heroically', 'freedoms', 'Total', 'time', '2', 'hours', 'main', 'DVD', 'Extra', 'interesting', 'interview', 'writer', 'Chetwynd', 'who', 'also', 'produced/wrote', 'excellent', 'DC', '9/11', 'Time', 'Crisis', 'director', 'Harmon', 'speak', 'how', 'Selleck', 'Eisenhower', 'admirable', 'characteristics', 'Selleck', 'who', 'how', 'non-smoker', 'played', 'man', '4', 'pack', 'day', 'habit']",N/A

He did a fantastic job.  The casting for this movie was superb.  The acting was also very very good, as was the screenplay.  The movie covers the period when Ike is first named ""Supreme Commander"", in charge of the entire European theater, to the D-Day invasion.  The movie starts out with Ike speaking with Winston Churchill.  They debate over the idea of having one ""supreme commander"" calling the shots in Europe.  Churchill goes on to say that no one in history has held that much power as he would have, not Alexander, Napoleon or Caesar. It's hard to disagree with that statement. The movie explores the decision making that took place in planning D-Day.  You really get a feel for the immense responsibility that Eisenhower had with running the War and keeping the Allies together.  Not only did he have war strategy to deal with, he also had to keep egomaniacs, like Monty and Charles de Gaulle, happy. No easy task, to be sure.

This made-for-cable movie has solid production values, authentic period detail, and a cast that recreates the many strong personalities Ike had to manage to pull off the liberation of Europe from the Nazis.  British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Montgomery; American Generals Bradley, Patton, and Smith; and French self-appointed savior DeGaulle are authentically captured as contending parties in the final planning for the invasion.Above all else, the movie portrays the enourmous pressures on Ike to balance the needs of the Allied military forces against challenges of weather, terrain, resources, and politics.  The final days of the countdown, as Ike waits for a break in the weather that may never come, and considers the human costs of a botched operation, are incredibly tense.Among other highlights of the movie: Ike's productive but sometimes trying relationship with Churchill, who understood the realities of the war but was ocassionally swept away by his own enthusiasms. Another is Ike's necessity to discipline an American staff officer who talks out of turn about the invasion and must be sent home in disgrace.

D-Day, and the Allied drive to Berlin is, indeed my favorite chapter in World War II history. I have read dozens of books on the topic, as well as bios of Dwight D. Eisenhower and his principle lieutenants. I truly admire Ike, and I am also a huge Tom Selleck fan. So what happened?The themes of the film are well handled. Selleck is a top-notch actor, and portrayed Ike's burdens of command admirably. The casting of the film's characters, however, spoils any chance that I can sit through this film and thoroughly enjoy it. I can forgive a reasonable amount of artistic license in war films, such as the multitude of exotic scenes in every take in Patton (1970), but I need my characters to at least resemble their historical figures. Despite the cropped haircut, Sellect is much too tall, and too young as Ike.

Eisenhower in this powerful film about the events leading up to the invasion of Normandy by the Allied forces.  Eisenhower's first task was to convince British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Ian Mune) of the need for one solitaty supreme commander for the invasion.  Churchill liked Ike's direct style and no-nonsense approach, and he readily endorsed Ike for the job.Meanwhile, British General Bernard Montgomery (Bruce Phillips) was more than a bit miffed at being passed over for the job.  Despite his victories over Rommel at El Alamein and Tobruk, he was denied the supreme commander job, but was still put in charge of all of the D-Day ground forces.  One poignant part of the film was seeing General George Patton (Gerald McRaney) have to practically beg Ike not to send him back to the States.  A hard-nosed tank commander who always got results on the battlefield, Patton routinely disobeyed orders from superiors.  Perhaps his most well-known incident was calling a shell-shocked soldier a coward and forcing him back into combat.  This incident did not sit well with Ike.  Despite all of Patton's shortcomings, Ike kept him on for the invasion.James Remar stars as General Omar Bradley. Remar gives a simply superb performance as Ike's right-hand man.  Bradley was in charge of the assault troops on D-Day and he lobbed Ike hard to keep the paratroop drop on despite very bad weather.  Ike agreed, and the paratroopers played a significant role in causing confusion among the German defenders.Timothy Bottoms stars as General Walter Bedell ""Beetle"" Smith, Ike's chief of staff.  A person would have a difficult time finding a soldier more loyal to his commander than Smith was.  He typically ran interference between Ike and the press and he kept all of the operations flowing smoothly.This is one of the best war films I have seen.  The historical correctness of the film is evident from beginning to end, including the cold relationships between Ike and Montgomery and Ike and French General DeGaulle.  The build-up to D-Day during the final few days is remarkably depicted, with the uncooperative weather, the hourly weather reports, and Ike's agonizing decision to go ahead with the invasion despite less than ideal conditions.  The movie even shows Ike mingling with one of the glider paratrooper crews before take-off.  Ike was a soldier's soldier, and this trait is shown throughout the movie.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The acting by all members is tremendous, and the attention to detail is magnificent.  I'm a huge fan of World War II movies, and after seeing this movie, it has quickly become one of my favorites.

834506,AGKJF15QQNVX6,B0002I833Q,"klownboy ""klownboy""","[11, 13]","WWII movies have tended to concentrate on the action in the small units; platoons, companies or even individual air planes as their members are confronted with the life and death obstacles placed directly in front of them.  Glimpses into what the major leaders are dealing with are typically left for an interested viewer to pursue on their own, or added in as mere background dressing in whatever biopic miniseries is in the works.Ike-Dountdown to D-Day may be the best example of capturing and presenting the enormity of the the Normandy invasion decision in a human scale.  The questions about the location of the invasion itself.  Is the deception campaign against the German's still holding?  How long can it hold?  How much bad weather can we accept?  Will the airborne forces be able to be effective or are we wasting them in a suicide mission?  The enormity of these considerations, the decisions that had to be made with much less than perfect information, and the men chosen to make those decisions are the focus of this movie.Personalities and ego's were in play, and the movie does a wonderful job of displaying the strengths and foibles of these men.  Ike's quiet leadership; Patton's brash self-promotion (with a great scene by Gerald MacRaney); Churchill's resolute and inspiring leadership; Montgomery's wounded pride and professionalism. Even DeGaulle shows up long enough to act like he's doing the allies a favor by allowing them to free France from the Nazi's.Selleck's performance in particular is very effective.  He doesn't fall into the trap of trying to mimic Eisenhower, and limits the makeup job to a shaved 'stache and a haircut.  It's absolutely the right choice, and allows you to concentrate on the performance and the story rather than on some aped affectations or rubbery makeup.  I was impressed at how he slid into this roll.  He deserved an Emmy nod but didn't get one, and it's a crime when you see what hokey garbage was nominated in his place.Entertaining and educational, it sheds a lot of light on some of the most important men making some of the most important decisions in the history of the world.  There is a lot of detail in the movie as well.  The bit about the pre-invasion DeGaulle speech was new information to me.As any worthwhile bit of history does, it still remains relevant in our era, where everyone seems to want to monday-morning-quarterback any conflict that arises.

Leadership is decision making.  It's easy to wait for perfect information to make a decision, but by then it's probably too late for your decision to make any difference.

Selleck has no resemblance in visual appearance or manner to Ike, either as war General or President.

The rest of cast is very good as well and that only helps the overall movie.  This movie shows why without Ike the whole d-day operation might have been a disaster like the earlier Dieppe invasion was.  The one fact that we don't see here is that he was having a affair with a woman during this period of his life.  His wife later forgave him for this and unlike today; peoples affairs weren't front page news.  That was probably one of his few faults other than chain smoking which was quited common in that era but just as destructive as today.  Tom Selleck though really gives you a feel for this great commander who proved that leadership isn't just a battlefield commodity it exists on many levels.  We owe Ike alot to this day and this movie really shows us why that is the case and it shows Ikes humanity as well. It proves that this is the type of leader you want at the top. You want your fierce generals on the line but they need a Ike to steer them overall and make sure that they don't waste lives needlessly.

His outstanding leadership skills are apparent from the beginning without being in our face, as he deals with personalities at levels above and below his rank, treating them equally with dignity and respect.  Selleck's use of restraint in playing his role mirrors Eisenhower's leadership style.The dynamics of managing the personalities and politics of the Allies and the generals are presented without glamorizing any of the personalities involved.  Instead, we see the strengths and weaknesses of each, and how Eisenhower managed them with an unassuming, yet authoritative style.Early on, Ike demands and is granted complete authority not to gratify his ego, but in order to ensure this diverse group of intense personalities speaks and acts with a single voice.  At the same time, Eisenhower assumes full accountability for everything that goes with the decision to be solely responsible for committing thousands of lives to an enormously complex and risky operation.His refusal to lose touch with the front lines, arguably his greatest asset as a leader, is highlighted in a moving scene where the General meets and greets an elite force of paratroopers prior to their deployment.  Ike's ability to deal with the responsibilities of his rank while reaching out to and inspiring the common man is what led to his success at Normandy and eventually, as President of the United States.",5,"Exceptional, courageous leadership",1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,1814,"['other', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'movies', 'spectacularly', 'depict', 'action', 'shores', 'Normandy', 'film', 'concerned', 'human', 'dynamics', 'who', 'conceived', 'executed', 'battle', 'eventually', 'broke', 'back', 'Nazi', 'freed', 'Europe', 'tyranny.Tom', 'Selleck', 'General', 'Eisenhower', 'competent', 'compassionate', 'leader', 'who', 'acutely', 'appreciated', 'impact', 'decisions', 'had', 'individual', 'soldier', 'outstanding', 'leadership', 'skills', 'are', 'apparent', 'beginning', 'being', 'face', 'personalities', 'levels', 'rank', 'treating', 'equally', 'dignity', 'respect', 'Selleck', 'use', 'restraint', 'playing', 'role', 'mirrors', 'Eisenhower', 'leadership', 'style.The', 'dynamics', 'managing', 'personalities', 'politics', 'Allies', 'generals', 'are', 'presented', 'glamorizing', 'personalities', 'involved', 'Instead', 'see', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'how', 'Eisenhower', 'managed', 'unassuming', 'yet', 'authoritative', 'style.Early', 'Ike', 'demands', 'granted', 'complete', 'authority', 'not', 'gratify', 'ego', 'order', 'ensure', 'diverse', 'group', 'intense', 'personalities', 'speaks', 'acts', 'single', 'voice', 'same', 'time', 'Eisenhower', 'full', 'accountability', 'everything', 'decision', 'be', 'solely', 'responsible', 'committing', 'thousands', 'lives', 'enormously', 'complex', 'risky', 'operation.His', 'refusal', 'lose', 'touch', 'front', 'lines', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'asset', 'leader', 'highlighted', 'moving', 'scene', 'where', 'General', 'meets', 'greets', 'elite', 'force', 'paratroopers', 'prior', 'deployment', 'Ike', 'ability', 'deal', 'responsibilities', 'rank', 'reaching', 'out', 'inspiring', 'common', 'man', 'what', 'led', 'success', 'Normandy', 'eventually', 'President', 'United', 'States']",N/A

However, each of us should know what he did...and not only what he did, but what each Allied soldier did in giving their lives for us.  I WISH that when I had been a high school or college student films like this had been available---accurate to history, but moving too.  I cried through many places as I realized the sacrifices so many have made to preserve our freedoms.Tom Selleck is exemplary---fabulous---as Eisenhower.  He says that he plays Eisenhower as ""truly an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances"".  Would that men like Eisenhower were alive today---I would hope this, wish this, but I doubt it.  Tom Selleck's acting is stunning and the directing is equally impressive.  This is a great movie!This film makes history come alive in a vibrant way.  If you are intersted in leadership, or history, or value your freedom, or want to be more grateful for your life...you will enjoy this film.  If you simply wish to appreciate the sacrifices others made for you, you will also enjoy this film.  If you want to understand the responsibilities and sacrifices of courageous leadership, this film will be of great benefit.  If you have teenagers, get them to watch this.  Upcoming generations who have no concept of what has been done for them will certainly benefit and even enjoy this movie.  It truly does pay homage to ""Our Greatest Generation""; now I truly understand why.There is no violence or profanity.  This is a movie suitable for children, especially children familiar with this historical period.  There are no battle scenes.  This is a film about leadership, courage, strength, sacrifice, moral values, confidence, and the humanness of the military.If you are a Democrat, as I am, it will help you to understand war more in this context, as difficult as war is. This movie did this for me.The special features are valuable, also; I will rewatch this movie again and again...it has spurred me on to read more about this time period in history...it is one of the few movies I will rewatch with the special features voiceover.I would rate this movie 10 stars on Amazon if it were possible.  I know that this is a rave review, but this is a film that exceeds the rave.  See this film.

This movie is absolutely superb.Tom Selleck gives what may be one of the most mature and serious performances of his career, and from my vantage point--not having been a general officer but knowing about fifty of them)--I believe he captures with enormous nuance and feeling the stress not only of leadership, but of leadership in a coalition environment where egos and posturing by lesser generals can run amok.The very best part of this movie is in its portrayal of the dynamics between Churchill and Ike, and the historic shift away from separate field commanders for air, land, and sea, and one Supreme Commander.  The USA could use a Supreme Commander today.  In my view, the services continue to posture and lie to inflate their budgets, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be a five-star general and chosen to be the Supreme Commander, with the Secretary of Defense in command of policy and acquisition and inter-agency support, but NOT micro-managing either the strategy or the global force projection.When in London I always try to visit the war bunker from which Churchill managed World War II.  I always look for the 2-3 telephones that were used and remind myself that command is about more than having a ton of command and control, communications, computing, and a heavy metal military.

834526,AP3V63JVKLEO5,B0002I833Q,Sherman A. Thompson,"[8, 20]","I give this monstrosity a generous two stars for Selleck's somewhat believable imitation of Ike. I am in my 80's and followed the war closely as it unfolded, from '39 through the end. I voted for Ike as president. He was a good man and a top level general caught in a bind, trying to control two prima donnas, Monte and Patton. I remember following Patton's slapping incident in the news as it happened. The faces and names of the real men portrayed in this film were and still are as familiar to me as Carter, Reagan, Clinton and Obama are today.The casting of this unfortunate film is terrible, especially for the roles of Patton and Montgomery. Patton was portrayed as a fat man instead of the trim, fit Officer he was, and he  came across as a sniveling little girl. He and Ike were old personal friends and West Pointers. Ike would have likely have been sitting on a corner of his desk as he chewed him out, talking frankly about the mess he'd made and difficult position he put him (Ike) in, with Patton sitting in a chair and taking his medicine informally. The scene portrayed in the film was so amateurishly played it was laughable.I watched as much of this cinematic travesty as I could, then shut it off and went to bed. The recent generations who didn't live during those war years have nothing to reference to and are excused for giving this more stars than it deserves out of ignorance. But the producers, directors, screenwriters, and those responsible for casting should have gotten better advisors and done their homework. They have done a disservice to history and the cinematic industry. The director also chose to make this a ""dark"" film, which just made it worse. Even the background music was amateurish, inappropriate, and unnecessary in most places, adding nothing to the presentation.As I said, the only reason I give this two generous stars is because of Sellick's decent performance in this cinematic dog.If you want a more accurate portrayal of Patton and Monte, see ""Patton"" again. Scott did a good job, although the real Patton had more of a high squeaky voice. ""Patton"" was well cast and acted, and almost every word of the script was taken from actual Patton quotes..",2,"Terrible, simply terrible.

So far so good. However, this movie left me curiously unsatisfied. The interactions between Eisenhower and his subordinates struck me as somewhat underdeveloped. Monty was portrayed in a very accurate fashion, but I didn't recognize Bradley, and the  actor portraying Patton seemed a caricature. Any information as to input from either the President or General Marshall were practically nonexistent and there was no detailed information as to the details of how Overlord was to be carried out. The viewer is simply handed the final plans of Overlord as a completed deal. Eisenhower's concern as the projected casualties and the welfare of his troops was well portrayed, but he seems almost paralyzed by this problem. Oddly, I don't think Selleck resembles Eisenhower. Too big and bulky and didn't display his uncontrolled temper that was on display during this period. Selleck could have been anyone in this movie. Finally, we are just told at the end of the movie that D Day was a success. It just deflates any expectations that the viewer might have that there would be any dramatic conclusion to the problems portrayed earlier.If the viewer is looking for a simple overview of Eisenhower's actions during this period, then it is okay.

The perfect Hero. He can do light comedy, hard drama and everything in between. Tom rules.It is only because Tom headlined this story that I was willing to watch it at all. From the first 2 minutes, I was hooked! Instead of your traditional ""beginning, middle and end"" the first 60 seconds of the story dumps you straight into heavy drama. There is no joking around. Thousands of allied troops are at stake and losses could reach from 80% to Total if these men get this wrong.The acting is strong and earnest. The director uses many close shots that assist the audience in the feeling that they are also at this tiny table surrounded by smoke. You can feel the tension in the air as the intelligence and counter-intelligence reports come in.How much do the Germans know? How many troops can we secretly move without being detected? Are all the allied nations and their respective troops on the same page here with us? Is there anything we've missed? Is the new equipment really going to perform as it should? What if it doesn't? What will happen if the weather goes bad?These and other questions way heavily on Dwight Eisenhower as he tries to negotiate and coordinate the most massive commitment of air, sea and land troops the world had ever seen. So much could go wrong and everything hinged on minutes, not hours to turn the tide of battle.Tom is fantastic in a role that is unlike anything he's ever done. You can feel the tension and anguish in his voice as he talks about projected allied casualties. You can feel as if you're in the room with his senior staff and even though you may know the history, this film presents the story as fresh. The acting is compelling and the story simply refuses to be put in a box. There is nothing about the elements of this story that couldn't be being played out right now in Iraq, Korea or anywhere else in the world.This is a story of human courage in the teeth of opposition. Opposition, an enemy, that is strong enough to strike back and destroy you if you get even one part of this wrong.
