I look forward to their upcoming tour and new CD. This DVD just makes me smile. I have loved this band for half my life and I'm 33.  I swear it's like my life goes with the songs when they come out. My favorite park is right before ""Unwell"" when he says what the song is about. It has personal meaning and that song to this day is my happy feel good song.I paid like $3.98 total with shipping! It was brand new and still sealed in original packaging. It was the best money I have spent on Amazon. I know I will watch this often!!!",5,Awesome! Love it!

The extra footage is well done and the whole thing professionally edited and THANK GOD they had the sound going through a recorder instead of recording from the live speakers at the concert!

The band is great, the songs are wonderful, the shots are good - the sound is shocking (I have a reasonable 5.1 sound system and over 100 music DVDs to compare against).I would strongly recommend (insist actually) that the producers of this DVD a) retract the product until another - qualified - sound company can fix it, and b) ensure that the sound people who did this DVD never work in the industry again.Matchbox 20 should take this up with the produces as well, as it hinders their brand and the beauty of their music.

Any fan of the group will recognize every song they perform and you will be singing along.  I found the audio to be slightly low volume, but this is just a fine reason to crank it up a couple of notches.  This concert recording provides you with the opportunity to enjoy the 90 minute show over and over without the annoying high ticket price, the rude people in front of you, waving their arms in the air, or the hassle of not being able to see.

I consider myself a little more than a casual Matchbox Twenty fan, but I've never seen a live concert in person, and this DVD almost compensates.  The sound is incredible, I rarely enjoy &quot;live&quot; concert sounds, but they really did a fantastic job at making the sound crisp and clear, no matter what sound system you have, it is great!  The video &quot;picture&quot; is great too!The second disc is kind of neat, you have all the lyrics from the concert displayed in a nifty manner.  You can change the camera angles from 6 different views on, &quot;Bright Lights&quot; and &quot;soul&quot;, which is kind of neat, you can focus on each member of the band, and watch them in action, instead of watching &quot;just&quot; Rob Thomas, not that, that is bad ::winks::  Oh and the Photo Gallery, which was nothing to write home about, they could of done without that section.The Documentary was alright, I would of liked them to focus more on each member of the band, and maybe do a biographical kind of thing..they mostly showed and explained how they get ready for a venue, how they prepare, and they showed their tour busses.  All in all, I think the DVD is worth your while.  It's almost like a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package with a ZING!

High quality video (shot in digitally with HD cameras), the sound is about average for a 5.1 mix of live concert. SRS adds a bit of depth (if your equipment support sit).The concert is 16:9 (anamorphic widescreen) so if you have a widescreen TV it looks really good. The documentary is not widescreen and mildy interesting.

However, concert videos can go either way (good or bad) so I was also ready for the worst.Thankfully though, my doubts were ruled out as minute by minute of the film rolled on.  The visuals are spectacular, with editing that fits the paces of the song really well.  Personally, I didn't see a problem with the sound, but maybe the volume was up a bit too much.The video was successful in placing me front and center (and closer) to a great Matchbox Twenty concert.  I almost got to go to the concert on the film (Atlanta), so having missed it I am extremely glad that the director did such a fine a job of catching the feel of one of their live concerts.I'd already decided this worthy of a five-star rating, but on top of the show itself I also enjoyed the documentary, or behind the scenes of the show (which is where most of the explicitness is.)  This is located on Disc 2.In summary, if you're a fan then it's a must like it was for me; however, it is still one of the best representations that people will get of Matchbox Twenty so I'd say it's just a good buy for the music lover/concert watcher in general.",5,"and I could've been, a ticket holder...",1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,1234,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Matchbox', 'Twenty', 'while', 'now', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 'concert', 'video', 'was', 'excited', 'However', 'concert', 'videos', 'can', 'go', 'way', 'good', 'bad', 'was', 'also', 'ready', 'worst.Thankfully', 'doubts', 'were', 'ruled', 'out', 'minute', 'minute', 'film', 'rolled', 'visuals', 'are', 'spectacular', 'editing', 'paces', 'song', 'really', 'well', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'sound', 'maybe', 'volume', 'was', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'much.The', 'video', 'was', 'successful', 'placing', 'front', 'center', 'closer', 'great', 'Matchbox', 'Twenty', 'concert', 'almost', 'got', 'go', 'concert', 'film', 'Atlanta', 'so', 'having', 'missed', 'am', 'extremely', 'glad', 'director', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'catching', 'feel', 'one', 'live', 'concerts.I', ""'d"", 'already', 'decided', 'worthy', 'five-star', 'rating', 'top', 'show', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'show', 'where', 'most', 'explicitness', 'located', 'Disc', '2.In', 'summary', ""'re"", 'fan', 'then', 'must', 'like', 'was', 'however', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'representations', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'Matchbox', 'Twenty', ""'d"", 'say', 'just', 'good', 'buy', 'music', 'lover/concert', 'watcher', 'general']",N/A
