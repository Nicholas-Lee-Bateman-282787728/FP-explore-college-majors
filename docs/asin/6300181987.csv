200548,A3QWHQK6CVMT3M,6300181987,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Steven Speilberg's first movie as director is a classic tale of cross-country terror between a car and trucker. Dennis Weaver stars as David Mann traveling across country who encounters road-rage, 70's style. No blood or language here. Through-out the movie you find yourself rooting for Weaver to somehow conquer this over-sized mechanical monster. People over 40 years of age will relate more to this movie due to the age of the film. Enjoyed as much now as when the film aired on tv.",5,Classic Spielberg,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,486,"['Steven', 'Speilberg', 'first', 'movie', 'director', 'classic', 'tale', 'cross-country', 'terror', 'car', 'trucker', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'David', 'Mann', 'traveling', 'country', 'who', 'road-rage', '70', 'style', 'blood', 'language', 'here', 'movie', 'find', 'rooting', 'Weaver', 'somehow', 'conquer', 'over-sized', 'mechanical', 'monster', 'People', '40', 'years', 'age', 'will', 'relate', 'more', 'movie', 'due', 'age', 'film', 'Enjoyed', 'much', 'now', 'when', 'film', 'aired', 'tv']",Duel VHS

I think I came across it because I left the TV on while doing homework or something. Next thing I know this movie has my attention. At first I thought it was one of those comedy movies. The main character, David (Dennis Weaver), seemed like an engaging character so I thought it seemed like an interesting movie so I started watching it, then the truck driver shows up and wow! I was captivated. This is my kind of movie. I have watched it several other times since then when it's on TV, and I would like to own it on DVD. I don't usually care for road rage movies, where there's lots of violence and death; they are exciting yet a little too much drama, however this movie is very well balanced and realistic. It might be kind of scary for young children, but otherwise is appropriate. At times I guess the music on the movie is dated, and there are some weird sound effects, however it still is very well done! I don't usually like Spielberg (I didn't realize it was a Spielberg till I looked this movie up on this website just now!) but this is his best!

200552,AXA7OH47LBXZ7,6300181987,"A Positive Guy ""Jay""","[0, 1]","This was originally a short story which attained prominence and (well deserved) which appeared in Playboy magazine in the late 1960's.  Steven Speiberg's secretary noticed it and thought it would make a great film.  From there, Speilberg began to take the story and make a film out of it.The original author, Richard Matheson wrote quite a few short stories from the late 1940's through 1970.  He wrote many of the 'Twilight Zone' stories, including 'Third Rock from the Sun', and 'Nightmare at 20,000 ft.'  Yet, 'Duel' may be the one story he is most remembered for.David Mann (Dennis Weaver) starts out on an ordinary workday to make an appointment in another city and very quickly encounters a truck driver with a big rig and a psychotic disposition.  The rest of this movie is a non-stop thriller with lots of twists and turns (literally) and a dramatic conclusion.The acting, filming, location, and direction is superb.  There should be more movies like this.  It is a timeless classic, that even though made in 1970, is as relevant and disturbing today as it was then. 'Duel' rivals anything Alfred Hitchcock ever did.

200553,A2QA095LQPDBJD,6300181987,Ariel Escasa,"[5, 5]","Picture this: a 23-year-old directs a cast composed entirely of actors older than him (with the exception of a bunch of school children whose scene lasts just a few minutes), exceeds the producers' budget, fails to meet the imposed deadline, and comes up with a piece that still packs enough chills to terrify motorists 35 years later.Eschewing plot intricacies and character depth, Spielberg brings us back to the time when movies were vehicles for no-frills storytelling. The sheer simplicity of the plot is in fact what makes Duel so frighteningly real to anybody who has gotten behind the wheel and traveled alone, especially on long stretches of highway.One thing I noticed that was not mentioned by any of the other reviewers here is the fact that Duel plays out in real time. With the exception of one scene where a time lapse is compressed into just under a minute (when David Mann hides his car behind some bushes and waits it out for an hour or so before continuing his trek), the entire movie's events take place in the same amount of time as the movie itself. So what's the significance of this?  It makes the entire experience of our protagonist even more real. You get more of that ""oh-my-God-this-could-very-well-be-me"" feeling when you see the events unfolding with virtually no time lapses.Spielberg holds the distinction of being the only director with five entries in the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time (from 1896 to 1996): Jaws, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T, and Schindler's List. I'll go out on a limb here, folks, and declare that Duel remains Spielberg's best movie. The others have not aged all that well. The awe and wonder of his fantasy flicks have faded, and so has the pathos of Schindler's List. On the other hand, the terror that Duel elicits has remained real as ever.So does that lead me to the conclusion that Duel deserves to be in the 100 Greatest Movies list, in place of one of these five Spielberg films? It's a tough call, but I would have to say that at the very least, Duel just has to be the greatest made-for-TV movie of all time.",5,"Precocious Kid Surpasses Budget, Timetable, And Expectations",1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2149,"['Picture', '23-year-old', 'cast', 'composed', 'entirely', 'actors', 'older', 'exception', 'bunch', 'school', 'children', 'scene', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'producers', 'budget', 'meet', 'imposed', 'deadline', 'up', 'piece', 'still', 'enough', 'chills', 'terrify', 'motorists', '35', 'years', 'later.Eschewing', 'plot', 'intricacies', 'character', 'depth', 'Spielberg', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'vehicles', 'no-frills', 'storytelling', 'sheer', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'fact', 'what', 'Duel', 'so', 'frighteningly', 'real', 'anybody', 'who', 'gotten', 'wheel', 'traveled', 'alone', 'especially', 'long', 'stretches', 'highway.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'not', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'fact', 'Duel', 'out', 'real', 'time', 'exception', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'time', 'lapse', 'compressed', 'just', 'minute', 'when', 'David', 'Mann', 'car', 'bushes', 'waits', 'out', 'hour', 'so', 'continuing', 'trek', 'entire', 'movie', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'amount', 'time', 'movie', 'what', 'significance', 'entire', 'experience', 'protagonist', 'even', 'more', 'real', 'get', 'more', 'oh-my-God-this-could-very-well-be-me', 'feeling', 'when', 'see', 'events', 'unfolding', 'virtually', 'time', 'distinction', 'being', 'only', 'director', 'five', 'entries', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'list', '100', 'Greatest', 'Movies', 'Time', '1896', '1996', 'Jaws', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'E.T', 'Schindler', 'List', ""'ll"", 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'here', 'folks', 'declare', 'Duel', 'Spielberg', 'best', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'awe', 'wonder', 'fantasy', 'flicks', 'have', 'faded', 'so', 'pathos', 'Schindler', 'List', 'other', 'hand', 'terror', 'Duel', 'remained', 'real', 'ever.So', 'lead', 'conclusion', 'Duel', 'be', '100', 'Greatest', 'Movies', 'list', 'place', 'one', 'five', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'tough', 'call', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'Duel', 'just', 'be', 'greatest', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'time']",Duel VHS

Weaver displays varying degrees of road rage as he and the truck driver try to pass and cut each other off while driving on crooked highways with little traffic.The truck driver is never seen, adding to the suspense and intensity of the film.  It's interesting to watch if only to see Weaver's emotional state, since he's usually a mild mannered character in most of his other movies.

200555,AI46E73DWKD2B,6300181987,BackToGood,"[5, 6]","Still, to this day, DUEL (1971) is perhaps my FAVORITE Steven Spielberg ""film""! Technically released as a made-for-TV movie in 1971 in U.S., it was re-marketed and theatrically released on Europe as a feature in 1972. Not surprisingly, it was a major success in both arenas, garnering major award nominations (Golden Globe for Best TV movie and Emmy noms for Sound Editing and Cinematography) and even garnering a film festival award as Best Feature Film of 1972. The then early-twentysomething Spielberg was immediately hailed as a phenom and the rest, as they say, is history. As far as I'm concerned, DUEL is a FILM. As good or better as any debut of an actual feature film of an up-and-coming director...and just as influential.DUEL is a thrilling psychological tale of a cat-and-mouse game between a psychotic truck driver and David Mann (the perfectly cast Dennis Weaver in a magnificent performance), a weary family man and salesman on a business road trip. Mann is just casually trying to get to his destination, when the trucker goads him into road rage by constantly passing and blocking him. Just when Mann thinks he's gotten the better of the trucker, the real ""game"" begins and it becomes a matter of life and death as Mann must navigate the desert highway to elude this pyschopath. Weaver perfectly relays Mann's slightly frustrated, meek, everyday Joe quality. I like the fact that the story never makes Mann do anything out of character or impulsive and forces him to react, rather than act, for most of the film. Even when he does kind of take action, it does a good job of explaining his inner thoughts and what motivates him to act this way.DUEL, minus a couple of hiccups, is one of the best edited films as each cut serves an actual purpose to simultaneously move the story along and relay the intensity of the situation. It's of great benefit that Spielberg was forced to use his imagination with intricate camera work as this was even before the era of fancy special effects in films. And Spielberg's direction is rock solid BEYOND good! Hard to believe it took less than 2 weeks to make this classic!It always fascinates me how an older film like DUEL, which SHOULD be dated, still manages to seem more modern than many of the films that have tried to copy it over the decades. ""Simplicity"" is a word that often comes to mind. DUEL is minimalist filmmaking in that it's told from a singular point of view and presented in a (feasible) way that makes us totally empathize with the main character's plight to the point where we can actually see ourselves going through this. Another thing is that DUEL was literally shot on location in remote roadside desert locales, which gives the film a timeless quality. Not to mention that all minor characters (the diner crowd, the elderly couple on the highway, the bus driver and kids, and the ""snake"" lady) come across as being very convincing in their bit parts. The dialogue is spare, natural, and realistic. None of that ""too clever for it's own good"" stuff you hear in so many flicks like this nowadays.I still think this is one of Spielberg's top films, right up there with JAWS, probably the only 2 films that he's made that I don't think slow down or lag at any moment. I own the DVD with Spielberg's commentary and added scenes that flesh DUEL out into a ""film"" more than it's initial TV-movie-of-the-week presentation, and for the most part, I think these scenes are of benefit.....TV movie?.....Film?.....

200557,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6300181987,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","This was always a little Steven Spielberg masterpiece that always alluded me. Being a gigantic Spielberg fan, and him being the number one influential movie making source for me, I couldn't believe that I had never seen this little gem of a film. For years I kept hearing about this cool little road thriller that he did back in the early 70's. Before ""Jaws"", and before ""The Sugarland Express"". This one was an elusive little creature, as I couldn't track it down. Thankfully, they showed it last night on AMC and I finally got to see the ""lost"" Spielberg movie I hadn't seen. Was it worth the wait?. Yes and yes. I am always a sucker for a really good road thriller, and I have to say that this one is not only the starter of all road thrillers to come, but it's the granddaddy of them all. Spielberg was only about 24 years old when he directed this, and you can see from the start of the Spielbergian flourishes that will come into play later in his career. Dennis Weaver, best known from ""Gunsmoke"" and ""McCleod"", stars as David Mann. A traveling salesman. Weaver plays the character as a real normal, every day kind of guy, which makes the material hit closer to him, and make the audience more connected with the character and his plight. As Mann is traveling to get to an appointment thru the rustic scenery of California, he is confronted by a big, ugly, rusted looking rig. Menacing and imposing, the truck itself is a character all it's own. From here on out, the mysterious rig begins to play a serious and deadly cat and mouse chase with Mann. Wherever Mann goes, the truck is there. He stops to eat, use the phone, try a phone, everything. He can not the shake the killer truck off. Finally pushed to the edge, Mann tries to save his life and stop this menacing rig once and for all. The movie is perfectly executed by Spielberg, and it amazes one that this is a TV movie. They sure don't make TV movies like this anymore, folks. The truck is the character. It's not so much about the truck driver as the movie rolls on. It's focused solely on the truck. As if it is not being controlled and driven by a human being, but is it's own self. It is it's own person with a mind of it's own. A piece of rust and metal that will keep charging forward no matter what, until it finally gets it's prey. It's no big surprise that Spielberg has pointed out the similarity to this and to ""Jaws"". The film doesn't really have a whole lot of dialogue. What dialogue there is is Weaver's inner voice speaking to him. Trying to figure things out. It's a different and ingenious way of handling things. The fact that there is less talk in this movie, just adds to the overall vibe of the film. Spielberg really shoots the film as if you were there. As if you can feel the California heat on the pavement, and feel the rumblings of the truck behind you. He uses brilliant techniques to shoot the film, and shows you that this is one guy who will become a masterful storyteller. Unless you read the one star review below from a reviewer who didn't seem to get it at all. He makes the movie very bare, with little to no dialogue, no main characters other than Weaver's, and basically lets the suspense and the surroundings play itself out and tell the story.

200558,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,6300181987,Barry C. Chow,"[12, 12]","This movie makes one yearn for simpler times before virtuosity was replaced with special effects. The shoestring budget in this originally made-for-TV movie is its very strength, forcing the director to use his filmmaker's skill to compensate for its lack of pyrotechnics or star power. This is one of Spielberg's very first directorial efforts, and his mastery of his craft is cast into sharp relief through the stark simplicity of this film: just a guy, a car and a truck. The resulting film is one of the tautest in the suspense repertoire.Much attention has been focused on this film over the years, mainly because its director would later go on to become one of the most successful filmmakers in history. It contains many of his trademark touches: the everyman thrown into conflict against his will, the dramatic suddenly rearing out of the commonplace, ordinary people confronting extraordinary evil or terror.It isn't slick like his later films, but is made more compelling by its austerity. Stripped of artifice, it exists as a clean bracing example of film in its essence: a great story told by a great storyteller in as simple, forthright and direct a manner as possible.An ordinary guy is driving to an appointment down a lonely stretch of highway when he gets stuck behind a semi-trailer that is obviously baiting him. He eventually makes a fateful decision, passes the truck, and in so doing earns the enmity of its unseen psychopathic driver. This leads to a cat and mouse chase down desert roads; fear, anger and paranoia; and the development of the main character from a comfortable dweeb into an unlikely hero.It's all done with a minimum of camera platforms, stunts and explosions. Instead, Spielberg relies on pacing, editing, mood and internal dialogue. There is a scene at a diner, and later, one with a school bus, in which the hero's fear is transformed into paranoia. For the occupants of the diner and the bus, the hero's actions look like those of a lunatic. For we, who have shared his experiences, his are the frantic actions of a man desperate to escape impending doom. This is masterful technique forcing us to adopt the protagonist's viewpoint so completely that we feel like screaming at the various characters along the way to help the poor fool.If the protagonist is weak, timid and a little stupid, these traits work to the film's advantage. He isn't some plastic action figure, but a man with whom we can identify. We've met his type before, may even share some of his qualities, and this makes his troubles so much more our own.Not everyone will enjoy this film. Those weaned on a contemporary diet of wall-to-wall destruction and ballets of death will lack the refinement necessary to appreciate its simplicity. Likewise, those who confuse suspense with mayhem and character development with macho swagger won't get it. But if you are the kind of person who associates suspense with circumstance and intrigue, who can see past low-cost production constraints, and who values quality over quantity, you will find this film not only a pleasure, but a master-class in Filmmaking 101.",5,Filmmaking in its Essence,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,3118,"['movie', 'one', 'yearn', 'simpler', 'times', 'virtuosity', 'was', 'replaced', 'special', 'effects', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'originally', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'very', 'strength', 'forcing', 'director', 'use', 'filmmaker', 'skill', 'compensate', 'lack', 'pyrotechnics', 'star', 'power', 'one', 'Spielberg', 'very', 'first', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'mastery', 'craft', 'cast', 'sharp', 'relief', 'stark', 'simplicity', 'film', 'just', 'guy', 'car', 'truck', 'resulting', 'film', 'one', 'tautest', 'suspense', 'repertoire.Much', 'attention', 'been', 'focused', 'film', 'years', 'mainly', 'director', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'filmmakers', 'history', 'many', 'trademark', 'touches', 'everyman', 'thrown', 'conflict', 'will', 'dramatic', 'suddenly', 'rearing', 'commonplace', 'ordinary', 'people', 'confronting', 'extraordinary', 'evil', 'terror.It', ""n't"", 'slick', 'later', 'films', 'made', 'more', 'compelling', 'austerity', 'Stripped', 'artifice', 'clean', 'bracing', 'example', 'film', 'essence', 'great', 'story', 'told', 'great', 'storyteller', 'as', 'simple', 'forthright', 'direct', 'manner', 'possible.An', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'driving', 'appointment', 'down', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'highway', 'when', 'stuck', 'semi-trailer', 'obviously', 'baiting', 'eventually', 'fateful', 'decision', 'truck', 'so', 'doing', 'enmity', 'unseen', 'psychopathic', 'driver', 'cat', 'mouse', 'chase', 'down', 'desert', 'roads', 'fear', 'anger', 'paranoia', 'development', 'main', 'character', 'comfortable', 'dweeb', 'unlikely', 'hero.It', 'done', 'minimum', 'camera', 'platforms', 'stunts', 'explosions', 'Instead', 'Spielberg', 'pacing', 'editing', 'mood', 'internal', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'diner', 'later', 'one', 'school', 'bus', 'hero', 'fear', 'transformed', 'paranoia', 'occupants', 'diner', 'bus', 'hero', 'actions', 'look', 'lunatic', 'who', 'have', 'shared', 'experiences', 'are', 'frantic', 'actions', 'man', 'desperate', 'escape', 'impending', 'doom', 'masterful', 'technique', 'forcing', 'adopt', 'protagonist', 'viewpoint', 'so', 'completely', 'feel', 'screaming', 'various', 'characters', 'way', 'help', 'poor', 'fool.If', 'protagonist', 'weak', 'timid', 'little', 'stupid', 'traits', 'work', 'film', 'advantage', ""n't"", 'plastic', 'action', 'figure', 'man', 'whom', 'can', 'identify', ""'ve"", 'met', 'type', 'may', 'even', 'share', 'qualities', 'troubles', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'own.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'weaned', 'contemporary', 'diet', 'wall-to-wall', 'destruction', 'ballets', 'death', 'will', 'lack', 'refinement', 'necessary', 'appreciate', 'simplicity', 'Likewise', 'who', 'confuse', 'suspense', 'mayhem', 'character', 'development', 'macho', 'swagger', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'suspense', 'circumstance', 'intrigue', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'past', 'low-cost', 'production', 'constraints', 'who', 'values', 'quality', 'quantity', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'pleasure', 'master-class', 'Filmmaking', '101']",Duel VHS

Businessman, Dave Mann (Dennis Weaver) ends up behind a big, rusty fuel truck on his way to a meeting. After passing the slow-moving vehicle, Mann gets caught up in a cat-and-mouse / life-and-death struggle for survival with the maniacal truckdriver. What I like most is the fact that the entire tale unfolds in the wide open countryside, in broad daylight. No dark, misty streets. Both predator and prey are seen in full sunlight, under bright blue skies. This makes DUEL all the more frightening and real. Writer Richard Matheson (Night Stalker / Night Strangler) spins another of his impressively scary yarns. Director Steven Spielberg isn't known for horror movies, but he has had some experience in the field (He directed 2 first season episodes of Night Gallery). The tension and suspense he creates in DUEL is relentless, unheard of in television (especially in the wacky 70s). Dennis Weaver is oddly perfect in his role as victim-turned-victor. Starting out calm, he slowly gets nervous, then spends a lot of time being terrified, finally getting fed up and determined to put an end to the insanity. And just who IS that mysterious truckdriver anyway?? The truck itself is a demonic presence, a juggernaut of death! The movie JEEPERS CREEPERS pays homage to DUEL (check out the kids' first encounter with the Creeper's truck). DUEL would make a great double feature w/ THE CAR.

Basically, a business man plans to arrive in a certain location in a couple of hours. However, an oil truck has been following him. At first, the man (Dennis Weaver) does not really care about the truck driver's pointless moves on the road; he thinks that somebody just wants to have fun or something. But as drives further, the truck driver becomes more insane and crazier than ever, and pursues Weaver's death.Weaver seems to be not used to driving fast; and he sweats as the truck follows him with 80 miles per hour. He gives a break at a cafe to think of what to do. These scenes are especially well established tension scenes. We see Weaver's helplessness, stress, and anger. Now, it's not about getting to his destination on time; it's about surviving, it's about staying alive. Yet, it will require a lot more sweat and stress.I agree with another reviewer in that 'The Duel' has a Hitchcockian style to it, as far as how tension is created.

The truck driver at first simply hounds Weaver, but then it turns potentially deadly as the driver tries to run Weaver down while he is calling from a phone booth.It becomes a game of high stakes road chicken as Weaver in his Valiant takes on the man in his large truck. With no possible hope of winning in any direct confrontation, Weaver must rely on speed and tactics if he is to survive the confrontation with a man on a deadly mission to kill him using an extremely powerful weapon.The music and the camera shots do an excellent job of establishing the semi truck as an extremely large predator lying in wait for the relatively weaker prey. The truck is a dirty-looking behemoth, the exhaust is extremely smoky and the coloration is a grayish, rusty tint that makes it look like something from a swamp. The movie was one of the first directed by Steven Spielberg and he clearly shows his talents in setting scenes of tension. If there is a flaw in the movie, it is that some of the road scenes are too long.",5,The natural fear of large trucks taken to a terrifying conclusion,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,1743,"['People', 'drive', 'cars', 'have', 'natural', 'aversion', 'large', 'trucks', 'driving', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'larger', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'easy', 'be', 'intimidated', 'Being', 'human', 'drivers', 'trucks', 'also', 'occasionally', 'make', 'mistakes', 'so', 'most', 'long-term', 'drivers', 'have', 'had', 'experience', 'near', 'actual', 'accident', 'semi', 'truck', 'movie', 'natural', 'fear', 'trucks', 'as', 'well', 'experience', 'higher', 'level', 'terror.Dennis', 'Weaver', 'man', 'experiencing', 'bit', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'driving', 'attend', 'meeting', 'Valiant', 'car', 'very', 'non-descript', 'just', 'like', 'thousands', 'other', 'men', 'road', 'However', 'reasons', 'target', 'man', 'driving', 'tanker', 'truck', 'truck', 'driver', 'first', 'simply', 'Weaver', 'then', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'driver', 'run', 'Weaver', 'down', 'calling', 'phone', 'booth.It', 'game', 'high', 'stakes', 'road', 'chicken', 'Weaver', 'Valiant', 'man', 'large', 'truck', 'possible', 'hope', 'winning', 'direct', 'confrontation', 'Weaver', 'must', 'rely', 'speed', 'tactics', 'survive', 'confrontation', 'man', 'deadly', 'mission', 'kill', 'using', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'weapon.The', 'music', 'camera', 'shots', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'establishing', 'semi', 'truck', 'extremely', 'large', 'predator', 'lying', 'wait', 'relatively', 'weaker', 'prey', 'truck', 'dirty-looking', 'behemoth', 'exhaust', 'extremely', 'smoky', 'coloration', 'grayish', 'rusty', 'tint', 'look', 'something', 'swamp', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'clearly', 'talents', 'setting', 'scenes', 'tension', 'flaw', 'movie', 'road', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'long']",Duel VHS

200572,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6300181987,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","It's neat to look back on a career, especially one as influential as Steven Spielberg's. Known for action films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws and Jurassic Park and serious films such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, he had to start somewhere. So we have his first feature debut(not officially, this was a made for TV movie while Sugarland Express was his first official theatrical release) which proudly wears its Hitchcock-like atmosphere on its sleeve.David Mann is on his way to a meeting when he ends up running into a slow moving but really ugly looking truck and passes him. Only the truck ends up passing him too and pretty soon this truck gets into a big hissy fit, such as following David around and trying to run him over.Narratively it doesn't seem like much: a guy and his car being chased by a guy in his truck(which we don't see, which makes it more effective). But somehow there's enough to make everything work better and never seems to falter in its pacing. You can probably count with your fingers how many times David looks behind him or the truck coming towards camera but you don't mind.Also great is Dennis Weaver(who for some reason, facially reminds me of Burt Reynolds) who gives a nice paranoid performance as he's being mind****ed. One nice scene was after he ends up crashing in a gate he gets whiplash(this doesn't happen much in car crashes on film does it?). Spielberg oddly has a cameo, 2 actually: he's in the backseat on one shot and in a reflection on the phone booth.Both of those cameos are featured in one of 2 big sit-downs with Spielberg himself as he remembers everything from his big map to a segment of the film an editor made from scratch and the dinosaur roar that the truck gives(which oddly I didn't hear on my speakers but maybe it was buried). The other feature is Spielberg recalling his early days as a TV director working on shows such as Columbo.It's pretty much Jaws on wheels in a way but Jaws was so great why not have a little companion to go with it.

200573,A3DTUMLBZCG47D,6300181987,Connor J. Hamilton,"[2, 3]","My parents had both seen this film when it was first made, and had always spoken highly of it. Last night, we finally checked it out from the library.As some reviewers have said, the plot is extremely simple. A businessman in a small car is attacked by an enormous semi truck on a lonely California highway. But sometimes the simplest plots are the most effective, and the most tense. There is no room left for complication, for viewer confusion or structural inconsistency. You don't forget which truck it is that's really chasing him; there's only one. And it comes back, again and again, with frightening patience and consistency.Dennis Weaver's acting is consistently good in this film. His reactions were understandable and well-portrayed. The scene where his voice-over depicts his thoughts in an almost stream of consciousness way when he stops at the cafe was very well done.I have a few quibbles, of course--no film is perfect, and Spielberg was just starting out with this film.First of all, there is the problem that Weaver's character never simply turns back. The truck is almost always just behind him or in front, waiting for him. If he had taken the opportunity, when it was in front, to turn around and go racing back for home as quickly as he could, it would have made more sense. Perhaps the truck would have still caught up, but if he had survived long enough he could have gotten back into habitable areas and thus out of the danger zone. If Spielberg had a reason that he did not, he should have had the character at least toy with the idea, and then reject it. Otherwise the viewers are left wondering why he keeps on going in the same direction, even after the truck has nearly killed him several times.Also, at the scene in the cafe, when Weaver's character is searching among the men at the bar for which one might be the truck driver (we never see his face; only his arm and his cowboy boots), the men consistently turn around and stare back at him. I have been in restaurants numerous times before, and it is possible to look at people without getting stared back at almost every time. From his position Weaver's character is fairly far from the men in an inconspicuous position. There would be little reason for all of them to turn and look at them as though they knew he was staring at them.But those are minor quibbles. In all the suspense was handled quite well. The film did not leave me with quite the sense of creepiness that some other suspense films--including Jaws--have, but perhaps that is because those deal with areas I have never really explored (I'm rather scared of the deep sea, and have never been in it, nor do I ever plan to be). But I've been on the highway a lot, and, scary as it would be for a truck to chase after you, it does not carry that sense of unknown possibilty that makes some suspense movies so effective.But it was a good movie overall, and I recommend seeing it. The truck starts out looking innocent enough, but it will become almost a personality as the movie progresses...",4,Tense and Interesting,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,3040,"['parents', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'made', 'had', 'always', 'spoken', 'highly', 'Last', 'night', 'finally', 'checked', 'out', 'library.As', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'plot', 'extremely', 'simple', 'businessman', 'small', 'car', 'attacked', 'enormous', 'semi', 'truck', 'lonely', 'California', 'highway', 'simplest', 'plots', 'are', 'most', 'effective', 'most', 'tense', 'room', 'left', 'complication', 'viewer', 'confusion', 'structural', 'inconsistency', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'truck', 'really', 'chasing', 'only', 'one', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'frightening', 'patience', 'consistency.Dennis', 'Weaver', 'acting', 'consistently', 'good', 'film', 'reactions', 'were', 'understandable', 'well-portrayed', 'scene', 'where', 'voice-over', 'thoughts', 'almost', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'way', 'when', 'cafe', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done.I', 'have', 'few', 'quibbles', 'course', 'film', 'perfect', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'film.First', 'problem', 'Weaver', 'character', 'never', 'simply', 'back', 'truck', 'almost', 'always', 'just', 'front', 'waiting', 'had', 'taken', 'opportunity', 'when', 'was', 'front', 'turn', 'around', 'go', 'racing', 'back', 'home', 'as', 'quickly', 'could', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'Perhaps', 'truck', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'caught', 'up', 'had', 'survived', 'long', 'enough', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'back', 'habitable', 'areas', 'thus', 'danger', 'zone', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'character', 'least', 'toy', 'idea', 'then', 'reject', 'Otherwise', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'going', 'same', 'direction', 'even', 'truck', 'nearly', 'killed', 'several', 'times.Also', 'scene', 'cafe', 'when', 'Weaver', 'character', 'searching', 'men', 'bar', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'truck', 'driver', 'never', 'see', 'face', 'only', 'arm', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'men', 'consistently', 'turn', 'around', 'stare', 'back', 'have', 'been', 'restaurants', 'numerous', 'times', 'possible', 'look', 'people', 'getting', 'stared', 'back', 'almost', 'time', 'position', 'Weaver', 'character', 'fairly', 'far', 'men', 'inconspicuous', 'position', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'reason', 'turn', 'look', 'knew', 'was', 'staring', 'them.But', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'suspense', 'was', 'handled', 'quite', 'well', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'sense', 'creepiness', 'other', 'suspense', 'films', 'including', 'Jaws', 'have', 'perhaps', 'deal', 'areas', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'explored', ""'m"", 'rather', 'scared', 'deep', 'sea', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'do', 'ever', 'plan', 'be', ""'ve"", 'been', 'highway', 'lot', 'scary', 'would', 'be', 'truck', 'chase', 'not', 'carry', 'sense', 'unknown', 'possibilty', 'suspense', 'movies', 'so', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'overall', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'truck', 'out', 'looking', 'innocent', 'enough', 'will', 'become', 'almost', 'personality', 'movie']",Duel VHS

200577,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,6300181987,Daniel Hurley,"[3, 3]","Total action film with virtually no other stars other than Dennis Weaver while others are virtual character actors sprinkled briefly throughout the film. Weaver is a middle aged, middle class man riding in a humble sedan. He has a modest clash with a trucker on a desert highway and in turn earns the unrelenting hatred of the trucker whose lone focus is homicidal revenge. The uniqueness of the film is that neither the face nor the voice of the truck driver is seen or heard but throughout Weaver's journey across the barren southwestern landscape, the truck is always gaining in his rearview mirror or confronting him while making legal stops. Steven Spielberg directs this 1971 classic that leaves you in suspense as to the motives of the truck driver as this movie becomes a gladiator fight between the weak and un-powered, Weaver and his pedestrian car, and the strong and powerful, the truck driver and the engine and weight of his tractor trailer. The movie is virtually frightening as Weaver's character seems weak and powerless symbolized by his confrontation with a man he thinks is the truck driver while stopped at a remote dinner. After suffering an undignified physical trauma, Weaver returns to the road but again, the unseen truck driver continues to stalk Weaver as it becomes obvious that the hunted and the hunter can only finish with a violent and abrupt ending. The ending is all those things but considering the unresolved mystery, the ending is ironically satisfying. Devoid of other characters, the total action touched with a virtual close up of Weaver's racing mind makes one think this was an early Spielberg college film entry that was magnified by a studio budget, which may be why it's so unique.

And where could the producers have located one of filmdom's scariest monsters?-- that rusting leviathan that could only have come from 18-wheeler hell. The movie itself confims what many of us only suspect: that heavy machinery operators should be psychologically tested before being loosed on the road.

Man wins because his more highly-evolved brain and agility will always best clumsy bulk and strength.

200590,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300181987,Erik North,"[92, 94]","DUEL is the film that made Steven Spielberg a household word in Hollywood--and for good reason.  Though made in only three weeks on a budget of less than $500,000, this superlative made-for-TV movie helped to launch his career beyond the stars.This is an extremely lean but effective psychological thriller with Dennis Weaver (of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; fame) effectively portraying the first of Spielberg's favorite characters, the Everyman--in this case, an average auto motorist driving to a business appointment on a lonely California highway.  He tries to pass a road-hogging diesel truck; but when he does, the truck goes after him for the rest of the way.  Neither Weaver nor the viewer ever sees the truck driver, with the exception of a beefy hand and a pair of cowboy boots; but it's perfectly obvious that this man is a total psychopath.Though suffering from some slight technical flaws, DUEL is brilliantly directed by Spielberg.  The film's screenplay is by the always-excellent sci-fi/horror writer Richard Matheson, who based it on a short story he had published in the April '71 edition of Playboy magazine.  Matheson, known for such novels as &quot;I Am Legend&quot; and scripts for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, is a master at this kind of mind-bending terror, and the combination of his and Spielberg's talents results in one of the most gut-wrenching and emotionally draining suspense films of all times.

There is a kind of an underlying ""Hitchcockian"", Twilight Zone aspect to the film, which is not surprising since the story is based on Matheson's work. When I saw this film as a kid, something struck me that made me a little uneasy--it was the faceless, unknowing identity of the semi's driver. Now after watching the film again, I realize what a nice touch this is. The driver takes on a ""demonic"" or ""hellish"" persona,  and whomever or whatever is going after the business man (Dennis Weaver) on the interstate is relentless to the point of absurdity. But, then again, that is what makes this film a great thrill to see again. This ""less is more"" theory of suspense is something that most directors don't pick up on, and the longing to know this driver's identity seems to get into not only Weaver's character, but the audience's as well.There is also that level within the business man's head, the inner narration, to try to understand the truck driver's motivation for hunting him down. The scene that captures this best is when the man goes to stop at the diner to eat lunch and call his wife. Part of the scene is the ""outer"" point of view, where we see the drivers' eating and the patrons having a regular meal, but, at the same time the inner workings of the man's mind is frantic and gut-wrenching, especially when he sees that the ""empty"" semi is just outside the diner. As he inconspicuously looks around for shoes that might match the man behind the wheel, he contemplates within his thoughts whether a mad-man is after his life. That is what great suspense is about.As far as other aspects of the DVD, I'm not usually a junkie for the extras when it comes to movies, but I found the extras that come with Duel to be extraordinary, specifically the interview and dialogue with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg looks back on the film, and gives a sense of how the concept of the movie came about, such as the inspiration to make Matheson's work come to life, as well as the tricks of making the chase scenes work. Also, he gives some insight into the film's amazing ending.If you haven't seen this film yet, go check out Spielberg before he became Spielberg.",4,Spielberg before Spielberg,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2312,"['Duel', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'Spielberg', 'potential', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'can', 'see', 'building', 'blocks', 'future', 'more', 'perfected', 'works', 'kind', 'underlying', 'Hitchcockian', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', 'surprising', 'story', 'based', 'Matheson', 'work', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'kid', 'something', 'struck', 'made', 'little', 'uneasy', 'was', 'faceless', 'unknowing', 'identity', 'semi', 'driver', 'Now', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'realize', 'what', 'nice', 'touch', 'driver', 'demonic', 'hellish', 'persona', 'whomever', 'going', 'business', 'man', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'interstate', 'relentless', 'point', 'absurdity', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'thrill', 'see', 'again', 'less', 'more', 'theory', 'suspense', 'something', 'most', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'longing', 'know', 'driver', 'identity', 'get', 'not', 'only', 'Weaver', 'character', 'audience', 'well.There', 'also', 'level', 'business', 'man', 'head', 'inner', 'narration', 'try', 'understand', 'truck', 'driver', 'motivation', 'hunting', 'down', 'scene', 'best', 'when', 'man', 'stop', 'diner', 'eat', 'lunch', 'call', 'wife', 'Part', 'scene', 'outer', 'point', 'view', 'where', 'see', 'drivers', 'eating', 'patrons', 'having', 'regular', 'meal', 'same', 'time', 'inner', 'workings', 'man', 'mind', 'frantic', 'gut-wrenching', 'especially', 'when', 'empty', 'semi', 'just', 'diner', 'inconspicuously', 'shoes', 'might', 'match', 'man', 'wheel', 'thoughts', 'mad-man', 'life', 'what', 'great', 'suspense', 'about.As', 'far', 'other', 'aspects', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'junkie', 'extras', 'when', 'movies', 'found', 'extras', 'come', 'Duel', 'be', 'extraordinary', 'specifically', 'interview', 'dialogue', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Spielberg', 'back', 'film', 'sense', 'how', 'concept', 'movie', 'came', 'about', 'such', 'inspiration', 'make', 'Matheson', 'work', 'come', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'tricks', 'making', 'chase', 'scenes', 'work', 'Also', 'insight', 'film', 'amazing', 'ending.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'Spielberg', 'became', 'Spielberg']",Duel VHS

One of Steven Spielberg's early directorial efforts, it is a classic among TV movies. Simple story of a working family man just trying to drive his car across the barren dust-beaten rural Southwest following, then being followed, by a truck. Soon the truck is trying to drive the poor urbanite off the road. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until things get nasty and it becomes evident that getting killed is a distinct possibility. The goings on take place on a simple stretch of interstate highway. The visual menace is the imposing truck with its exhaust, its metal, its speed. The psychological menace is in the intent, the perceived motive, the senselessness, the isolation. Its driver is faceless---we see a boot here, a rear-view window reflection there, a glancing back-of-the-head shot there. The terror experienced by this poor guy was predominantly in the expansive, intangible universe of his mind where civilized common sense gave way to paranoia and then to rudimentary survival. The lead was played by the always underappreciated Dennis Weaver whose TREMENDOUS performance I will never forget. The scene where he is trying to outrun the truck , with his car's radiator overheating,  struggling to get the faltering vehicle beyond the highway incline so that he can coast the rest of the way is memorable. The scene where he walks into a diner in a paranoid daze and surveys the farmers and truckers for possible complicity is a beaut. This was a tense, suspenseful, riveting TV movie and a classic one.

200599,A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,6300181987,Gunther Haagendazs,"[5, 6]","What fascinates me the most about the film Duel is how simplistic it is.  Stephen Spielberg was given a car, a truck, the desert, a few town stops along the way, rocks and more desert and was able to make a 72-minute TV movie out of it (and then later expand it to 90 minutes for official release).  For those of you unfamiliar with the film, it's very simple.  A salesman is driving through a desert on his way to a business meeting; after he passes a truck that is going too slow multiple times, it escalates to a sick game of cat and mouse as our hero must drive for his life before the truck driver ends it.Duel was Spielberg's first movie and is a great example of what can be done with very little.  The camera work is brilliant; Dennis Weaver's acting really draws you in to his character's fear and paranoia; and the truck always looks menacing.  The truck's warning Flammable seen on the side of the truck implies that the driver is a ticking time bomb just waiting to go off, while the multiple license plates on the front bumper imply that the he has killed before and is a possible serial killer).  There are many things drawn from Hitchcock films such as the constant usage of suspense to hook the viewer.  The greatest example of this is the fact that we never see what the truck driver looks like.  Sure, we see a hand of a foot every now and then, but we never get a glance at the man's face.  This little bit of missing information allows us to be afraid because we never know what kind of monster we are up against.If you haven't seen this movie and are a Spielberg fan, hunt it down as quickly as possible.  It's basically the rough draft version of Jaws, as the death cry of the shark is the same sound used in Duel when the truck is destroyed.  I personally think Spielberg needs to go back and do another horror/suspense film like Duel or Jaws just because he was so good at it and it would be nice to have another film like those released today where as most horror films are just so bland and dull today, lacking a unique edge.",5,Jaws On Wheels,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2051,"['What', 'most', 'film', 'Duel', 'how', 'simplistic', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'given', 'car', 'truck', 'desert', 'few', 'town', 'stops', 'way', 'rocks', 'more', 'desert', 'was', 'able', 'make', '72-minute', 'TV', 'movie', 'then', 'later', 'expand', '90', 'minutes', 'official', 'release', 'unfamiliar', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'salesman', 'driving', 'desert', 'way', 'business', 'meeting', 'truck', 'going', 'too', 'slow', 'multiple', 'times', 'sick', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'hero', 'must', 'drive', 'life', 'truck', 'driver', 'it.Duel', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'movie', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'very', 'little', 'camera', 'work', 'brilliant', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'acting', 'really', 'draws', 'character', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'truck', 'always', 'menacing', 'truck', 'warning', 'Flammable', 'seen', 'side', 'truck', 'driver', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'just', 'waiting', 'go', 'off', 'multiple', 'license', 'plates', 'front', 'bumper', 'imply', 'killed', 'possible', 'serial', 'killer', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'drawn', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'such', 'constant', 'usage', 'suspense', 'hook', 'viewer', 'greatest', 'example', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'truck', 'driver', 'Sure', 'see', 'hand', 'foot', 'now', 'then', 'never', 'get', 'glance', 'man', 'face', 'little', 'bit', 'missing', 'information', 'be', 'afraid', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'monster', 'are', 'up', 'against.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'Spielberg', 'fan', 'hunt', 'down', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'basically', 'rough', 'draft', 'version', 'Jaws', 'death', 'cry', 'shark', 'same', 'sound', 'used', 'Duel', 'when', 'truck', 'destroyed', 'personally', 'think', 'Spielberg', 'go', 'back', 'do', 'horror/suspense', 'film', 'Duel', 'Jaws', 'just', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'film', 'released', 'today', 'where', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'bland', 'dull', 'today', 'lacking', 'unique', 'edge']",Duel VHS

200601,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6300181987,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[5, 5]","Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"" is a great movie about an ordinary salesman and his horrifying day on the road in the desert in California.  Dennis Weaver stars as David Mann in this superbly crafted thriller that pits a simple man in his car versus an eighteen wheeled truck in a game of survival of the fittest.  Spielberg does a great job of presenting the action to the audience from David Mann's point of view by allowing the audience the unique experience of hearing Mann's thoughts as he thinks them.  This allows the viewer access to the mind of the main character, and the psychological effect on the viewer is amazing.  The score/soundtrack in ""Duel"" also does a great job of presenting mood and atmosphere throughout the movie.Being privy to Mann's thought processes makes ""Duel"" a terrific psychological thriller from Mann's perspective that allows the viewer to climb into the mind of the main character.  Hence, the viewer is able to empathize with Weaver's character in this most intimate manner.  The audience consequently sympathizes with Mann, and thinks with him as he goes through the action of the movie about what could be done to eradicate the dilemma that Mann has.""Duel"" is more of a thriller than a horror movie.  However, there is an undeniable element of horror inherent in Mann's situation.  Imagine being bullied in your small car by an eighteen wheel truck on a desert highway with a truck driver who has a death wish or at least no regard for human life, much less the ordinary traffic laws for any jurisdiction. Everybody has experienced road rage with drivers that like to play road games, but what if you were on a desert highway with a huge truck who basically wanted to kill you for some inexplicable reason?  The fact that there is no real motive for the truck driver's actions only works to magnify the horror associated with Mann's situation.Indeed, there is horror in the situation and setting of ""Duel"", and Spielberg does a brilliant job of presenting it to the audience.  Spielberg cleverly never allows the viewer to get a real look at the driver of the truck thereby creating even more suspense and fear in the audience, but the real fear is in the isolation of Mann's character and the situation with which he must confront all by himself.  No one is around to help him, and it is a fight to the death with Mann and his piece of junk car versus this crazy truck driver and his eighteen wheeled killing machine.  I mean let's face it, the odds are against Mann in this fight to the death, and the audience is able to experience his David versus Goliath like horror every step of the way.  The critics will argue that there is no blood and gore in this film and that it is one-dimensional...this is true, but I like it.I highly recommend ""Duel"" as a great thriller with an element of horror derivative of the main character's situation which is sure to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat for the entire movie.",4,"4.5 STARS: ""Maybe he's crazy...ok, so he's crazy.

200602,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,6300181987,Irishgirl,"[5, 6]","Wow! Who says you need blood, guts and gore to make a good horror movie? Sometimes all you have to do is place yourself in a person's shoes and feel their utter terror in order to experience true horror chill through your bones. I still can't believe that this is director Steven Spielberg's first film. He should have gotten the 1971 ""Rookie of The Year"" Award.Ever experienced road rage? I have. Usually it was in the form of an obscene finger gesture. But road rage comes in other forms; forms such as gigantic semis with ""Caterpillar"" diesels roaring at your car bumper. With 1971's ""Duel,"" you are literally put in the drivers seat with Dennis Weaver on one of the most hellish highway races around. I remember watching in horror with my heart doing flips in my chest during my first encounter with this movie on television years ago. I've seen this movie several times since.Dennis Weaver, perfectly cast for this role with his panicked deer-caught-in-the-headlights eyes and his chilling hysterical shrieks, plays a salesman named David Mann who is on the road to an important meeting. On the way, he finds himself coughing behind the fumes of a huge semi in front of him. We find out pretty quickly that it does not take much to piss this semi-driver off. After they each take their turns of passing one another, the semi driver promptly leads David Mann on into an on-coming car. Okay....this is not your ordinary Sunday-drive on the road.The suspense builds as the semi virtually rides Mann's bumper down the road at at least 100 mph in a seemingly endless saga, forcing Mann to go beyond all limits and finally come ""crashing"" into a nearby ""Chuck's Cafe."" What follows is one of the more humorous parts of the film when Mann becomes suspicious of everyone in the cafe being this dreaded driver, and ends up getting into a fight with one of the customers. Word to the wise, if someone tells you to ""Just cut it out"" and then slaps your sandwich out of your hand, you best put up your dukes and fight like a man!Unfortunately the time comes for David Mann to be on his merry way, and he's off like a dirty shirt; sweat stains and all, back on the road again in that little red Plymouth. Anyway, I bet you can pretty much guess what lies ahead for the poor salesman. Actually there are many things lying ahead for David Mann from attempting to help a stalled busload of kids, to nearly getting pushed into a fast-moving train, to a frustrating encounter with a freaked-out elderly couple, to the stop at the reptilian gas station that gets rudely trashed. The semi driver was intent on creating a ""duel"" to the death with David Mann.A bit of comic relief takes hold as Mann struggles to give a school bus of kids a push with his little red car only to be literally chased away by ""Mr. Diesel."" Adding to the comedy is the elderly couple whom Mann tries to stop and tell to call the police. Mann only succeeds in freaking them out and is chased away by the mighty ton on wheels. Then there's that classic reptile gas station, and I must say, I felt so bad for the woman running the place. Here is a middle-aged woman who is passionate about her caged snakes, lizards and spiders surrounding the station. She's clear out in the boonies and probably gets hardly any business at all. Needless to say, she is overjoyed when David Mann pulls up to let her check under the hood of the car while he checks into a phone booth to call the police. Unfortunately the diesal takes care of the poor lady's station in an attempt to get after Mann. Obviously, Mann needed to heed Dr. Diesel's wishes and get back on the road of terror where he belonged.Probably the most terrifying part of the film comes toward the end when Mann is being chased by the semi up a grade. If you have not watched this movie before and are planning to watch it for the first time, you may have a difficult time getting through this part and need a paper bag to breathe in. This scene involves a radiator hose, lots of hissing steam, speed dials dropping, spine-tingling screams and pleading from David Mann ringing in your ears and the sound of the engine frying. And no, we're not talking about fried chicken. This all comes together to create one of the most edge-of-your-seat experiences around.For those of you who have not yet seen this movie, I will leave you with a few little details. #1: You will learn just how handy a brief case can be when you're in a jam, #2: A fire's blaze can be quite blinding, and #3 Living on the edge will eventually leave no edge to live on. Unfortunately you may just realize it when you're flying off a cliff.Something that is definitely worth a mention is the music of the film. It is intense, frantic; the music of an adrenaline rush echoing the rapid pounding heartbeat of someone on the run with racing thoughts filling the head. Urgent and screeching violins and other haunting sounds; I really mean HAUNTING, completely engulf you that much more into the terrifying world of David Mann and the deranged madness of the truck driver. Even the truck itself looks mean; dirty and metal-colored with a face only a mother could love. In this case, the truck and driver make perfect partners in crime.Also definitely worth a mention are the highway shots throughout the movie. We get some excellent footage of the truck's tires grinding against the hot pavement as well as its foreboding bug-smashed grill. The quick shots of the speedometer dropping and speeding up in Mann's car is a fantastic touch, and the overall chasing scenes down the highway are very well done. You can feel the speed, the terror rise, and you'll be guaranteed to get very anxious.Dennis Weaver does an EXCELLENT job in this film as we see some amazing close-ups of his terror-drenched face and his hysterical yells at the truck driver and at his own car to go faster. The close-up shots of him looking back frantically to see how far the truck is behind him, really add to the mounting terror. Weaver is a very versatile actor in that he can swing from the calm man listening to the radio on his way to the meeting, to the frantic man literally driving for his life.The extras in the movie are worth the price as you get a complete history on how the movie came about, and the making of the movie with all the techniques, tricks and styles that Spielberg chronicles for us in his commentary. You'll even find out how he picked out his actors/actresses for the film, as well as the truck! It is quite interesting indeed.I tell you, even though this is Spielberg's first full-length film, it is one of his very best works, let alone early works. As my heart raced and panic rose during my first viewing of the film, I remember my mom telling me that this was a Steven Spielberg film. Then I, totally engrossed in this amazing 1971 film, turned to her and said, ""Well that explains it.""",5,"""You Can't Beat Me On The Grade!!""",1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,6871,"['Wow', 'Who',

He tried in 1971 to build a thriller in the road tradition, road rage and other brutalities. A poor man in his car crossing some desert area in California is chased by a truck that was not for him going fast enough and that he dared overtake. The chase will be a full success without a real ending. It is not a masterpiece just because of that. The frenzy is too long and hence too slow and chaotic. A scene of that type cannot last more than ten minutes. And the end does not bring any solution. The truck is destroyed, fine, but the flammable product in it does not explode, shucks. But the driver does not come out to haunt the dumb car driver who had defied him. That's a shame and he stays there sitting in the desert with no car, no water, a full blasting sun on his head and miles away from the closest desolate road where there is one car every two weeks. What was he doing on this road anyway? The best part is the rattlesnakes, the tarantulas, the boas, and a few other creepy crawly animals, but this time it was too short.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",4,You will get lost in the very tricky plot,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1264,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'just', 'play', 'den', 'tried', 'frighten', 'nurse', 'babysitter', 'tried', '1971', 'build', 'thriller', 'road', 'tradition', 'road', 'rage', 'other', 'brutalities', 'poor', 'man', 'car', 'crossing', 'desert', 'area', 'California', 'chased', 'truck', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'fast', 'enough', 'dared', 'overtake', 'chase', 'will', 'be', 'full', 'success', 'real', 'ending', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'frenzy', 'too', 'long', 'hence', 'too', 'slow', 'chaotic', 'scene', 'type', 'can', 'not', 'last', 'more', 'ten', 'minutes', 'end', 'not', 'bring', 'solution', 'truck', 'destroyed', 'fine', 'flammable', 'product', 'not', 'explode', 'shucks', 'driver', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'haunt', 'dumb', 'car', 'driver', 'who', 'had', 'defied', 'shame', 'there', 'sitting', 'desert', 'car', 'water', 'full', 'blasting', 'sun', 'head', 'miles', 'away', 'closest', 'desolate', 'road', 'where', 'one', 'car', 'two', 'weeks', 'What', 'was', 'doing', 'road', 'anyway', 'best', 'part', 'rattlesnakes', 'tarantulas', 'boas', 'few', 'other', 'creepy', 'crawly', 'animals', 'time', 'was', 'too', 'short.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",Duel VHS

200608,AIO247KHD2O40,6300181987,James N Simpson,"[4, 4]","Duel is the only Matheson classic where the movie actually has much similarity to the original Matheson story.  This may well be due to the fact that Matheson also wrote the screenplay but none the less this is a pretty unique factor for a Matheson story and something those who sat through the Wil Smith version of his masterpieceI Am Legendno doubt wish had happened there as well.  What makes Matheson's masterpieces in print work, is the ordinary man verse whatever the unexpected element factor is (in the case of Duel a tormenting semi trailer). The books are so successful because the reader can place themselves in the situation in the character's shoes, they think what I would do here? Would I do the same thing as the man character?  Would I survive?  The ordinary man readers can relate to is usually lost in the movie version as film studios try and fill cinema seats with more heroic or popular actors than your every day person is but not so with the movie version of Duel.  Not saying Dennis Weaver is an average actor by any means, just that he plays and every day relatable to the reader David Mann very, very well.Even though this is a very low budget film (the film is made up of an ABC telemovie, shot quickly in twelve days and later expanded to movie length with the train crossing and car being pushed by truck and other added scenes necessary for the legal minimum length to show it in cinemas in Europe), I don't think that increasing budget or modernising it today Spielberg or anyone else could achieve a much better or edge of your seat thriller of a film.  It is really only the beginning shots before David Mann encounters the truck with the opening credit fonts and shots of 1971 version of San Diego and other towns being a bit dated.  Once the film quickly reaches the desert it could be happening in the modern day.  The only thing I think where Spielberg's lack of experience let him down was the final couple of minutes as the vehicles climb a mountain where continuality isn't achieved with the truck sometimes being right behind and in the mirrors of the car, and sometimes being a long way behind when it should have been the same or even gaining.Apart from the great movie itself the DVD also comes with three mini documentaries.  The first being Spielberg recounting how he made Duel, the second a look at Spielberg and his early TV director career and the final an interview with Richard Matheson.  The first and last are very interesting documentaries where you not only learn how the film was made/story was written but get to know some trivia as well.  Spielberg points out due to the fact that the film was airing a few weeks after he shot it and he was out in the desert filming so never saw the camera on shots on screen, he never knew he was actually in Duel. You can see a glimpse of him in the back seat of the car in one shot and his reflection in the phone booth as David Mann calls the police and the truck bears down on him.  Matheson also tells us along with recounting the story of the truck that harassed him and a buddy on the day JFK was assassinated that he didn't think the story could last the length of a TV movie so was going to add a wife in the car but someone talked him out of it and he's glad they did.The original trailer and some poster images and photos are also included.Duel is a classic film that you'll watch over and over again!",5,Roadrage Can Be Deadly!,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,3407,"['Duel', 'only', 'Matheson', 'classic', 'where', 'movie', 'actually', 'much', 'similarity', 'original', 'Matheson', 'story', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'Matheson', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'none', 'less', 'pretty', 'unique', 'factor', 'Matheson', 'story', 'something', 'who', 'sat', 'Wil', 'Smith', 'version', 'masterpieceI', 'Am', 'Legendno', 'doubt', 'wish', 'had', 'happened', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'Matheson', 'masterpieces', 'print', 'work', 'ordinary', 'man', 'verse', 'unexpected', 'element', 'factor', 'case', 'Duel', 'tormenting', 'semi', 'trailer', 'books', 'are', 'so', 'successful', 'reader', 'can', 'place', 'situation', 'character', 'shoes', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'here', 'Would', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'man', 'character', 'Would', 'survive', 'ordinary', 'man', 'readers', 'can', 'relate', 'usually', 'lost', 'movie', 'version', 'film', 'studios', 'try', 'fill', 'cinema', 'seats', 'more', 'heroic', 'popular', 'actors', 'day', 'person', 'not', 'so', 'movie', 'version', 'Duel', 'Not', 'saying', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'average', 'actor', 'means', 'just', 'day', 'relatable', 'reader', 'David', 'Mann', 'very', 'very', 'well.Even', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'film', 'made', 'ABC', 'telemovie', 'shot', 'quickly', 'twelve', 'days', 'later', 'expanded', 'movie', 'length', 'train', 'crossing', 'car', 'being', 'pushed', 'truck', 'other', 'added', 'scenes', 'necessary', 'legal', 'minimum', 'length', 'show', 'cinemas', 'Europe', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'increasing', 'budget', 'modernising', 'today', 'Spielberg', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'achieve', 'much', 'better', 'edge', 'seat', 'thriller', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'beginning', 'shots', 'David', 'Mann', 'truck', 'opening', 'credit', 'fonts', 'shots', '1971', 'version', 'San', 'Diego', 'other', 'towns', 'being', 'bit', 'dated', 'film', 'quickly', 'desert', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'modern', 'day', 'only', 'thing', 'think', 'where', 'Spielberg', 'lack', 'experience', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'final', 'couple', 'minutes', 'vehicles', 'climb', 'mountain', 'where', 'continuality', ""n't"", 'achieved', 'truck', 'sometimes', 'being', 'right', 'behind', 'mirrors', 'car', 'sometimes', 'being', 'long', 'way', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'even', 'gaining.Apart', 'great', 'movie', 'DVD', 'also', 'three', 'mini', 'documentaries', 'first', 'being', 'Spielberg', 'recounting', 'how', 'made', 'Duel', 'second', 'look', 'Spielberg', 'early', 'TV', 'director', 'career', 'final', 'interview', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'first', 'last', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentaries', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'learn', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made/story', 'was', 'written', 'get', 'know', 'trivia', 'as', 'well', 'Spielberg', 'out', 'due', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'airing', 'few', 'weeks', 'shot', 'was', 'out', 'desert', 'filming', 'so', 'never', 'saw', 'camera', 'shots', 'screen', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'actually', 'Duel', 'can', 'see', 'glimpse', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'one', 'shot', 'reflection', 'phone', 'booth', 'David', 'Mann', 'police', 'truck', 'down', 'Matheson', 'also', 'recounting', 'story', 'truck', 'harassed', 'buddy', 'day', 'JFK', 'was', 'assassinated', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'story', 'could', 'last', 'length', 'TV', 'movie', 'so', 'was', 'going', 'add', 'wife', 'car', 'someone', 'talked', 'glad', 'did.The', 'original', 'trailer', 'poster', 'images', 'photos', 'are', 'also', 'included.Duel', 'classic', 'film', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'over', 'again']",Duel VHS

200614,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6300181987,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[103, 110]","Just as many people find themselves viewing the shower with trepidation after viewing Psycho, I've found myself wary to get on interstate highways after viewing Duel.  A 1971 tv-movie (that was, yes, the first film to be directed by Steven Spielberg), Duel is an effectively, simple little film that sticks with you long after the end credits have run.  Dennis Weaver plays a businessman travelling alone across a desolate strip of America.  For reasons that neither he nor the viewer can quite understand (and, for once, this makes the film's terror all the more effective), a truck driver targets Weaver and for the next hour and a half, we watch as Weaver struggles to survive against a faceless, seemingly more powerful opponent.  It's a simple premise but it is also a premise that taps into our deepest fears of the unknown.  Weaver's struggle is made all the more terrifying because it seems to just happen at random.  Weaver is targeted for no specific reason and, as unfair as that might seem to both him and the viewer, he now has no choice but to try to survive.Duel works because of the talents of a young Steven Spielberg and the likeable everyman performance of Dennis Weaver.  Indeed, Weaver's contribution has often been overshadowed by the hype surrounding Spielberg's involvement and that's a shame because he gives a truly perfect performance, a worthy model for actors (especially those currently sleepwalking through today's crop of horror films) everywhere.  Weaver is one of those talented actors who, because he was never a showy performer and for the most part limited himself to television work, has never really gotten his due.  In Duel, he is totally believable as an ordinay man caught up in an extradorinary situation.  From the minute he first appears on screen, viewers can easily accept him as their surrogate and it is this indentifiability that makes what happens to him so enthralling and disturbing.  As for Spielberg, this film proves that, had he not gotten into his head to be a great filmmaker, Speilberg could have had a very lucrative and rewarding career as a modern day Roger Corman.  Using the techniques he would later hone to perfection in Jaws, Spielberg crafts an unpretentious, massively entertaining horror film that never loses sight of reality.  Working with essentially one actor and one set, Spielberg manages to capture the viewer from the first minute and keeps the narrative flying for the next 90 minutes, never allowing things to slack off and never giving viewers a reason to look away from the screen.  Especially compared with some of Spielberg's later, more ""respectable"" entertainments, Duel represents the ideal Spielberg -- all of his skill without the later need to prove he was capable of more than just being a ""mere"" entertainer.  Duel, despite being this young director's first film, is a perfect example of everything that Steven Spielberg does right and when compared with his later films, it becomes just as perfect an example of everything Spielberg's done wrong since then.But don't watch the film because it was directed by Steven Spielberg or because Dennis Weaver was always underrated as an actor.  Watch it because it does everything you could possibly want a thriller to do.",5,Don't get on the interstate...,1046822400,"03 5, 2003",2003,3258,"['Just', 'many', 'people', 'find', 'viewing', 'shower', 'trepidation', 'viewing', 'Psycho', ""'ve"", 'found', 'wary', 'get', 'interstate', 'highways', 'viewing', 'Duel', '1971', 'tv-movie', 'was', 'yes', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Duel', 'effectively', 'simple', 'little', 'film', 'long', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'run', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'businessman', 'travelling', 'alone', 'desolate', 'strip', 'America', 'reasons', 'viewer', 'can', 'quite', 'understand', 'once', 'film', 'terror', 'more', 'effective', 'truck', 'driver', 'targets', 'Weaver', 'next', 'hour', 'half', 'watch', 'Weaver', 'survive', 'faceless', 'seemingly', 'more', 'powerful', 'opponent', 'simple', 'premise', 'also', 'premise', 'deepest', 'fears', 'unknown', 'Weaver', 'struggle', 'made', 'more', 'terrifying', 'just', 'happen', 'random', 'Weaver', 'targeted', 'specific', 'reason', 'as', 'unfair', 'might', 'seem', 'viewer', 'now', 'choice', 'try', 'survive.Duel', 'works', 'talents', 'young', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'likeable', 'everyman', 'performance', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Indeed', 'Weaver', 'contribution', 'often', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Spielberg', 'involvement', 'shame', 'truly', 'perfect', 'performance', 'worthy', 'model', 'actors', 'especially', 'currently', 'sleepwalking', 'today', 'crop', 'horror', 'films', 'everywhere', 'Weaver', 'one', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'showy', 'performer', 'most', 'part', 'limited', 'television', 'work', 'never', 'really', 'gotten', 'due', 'Duel', 'totally', 'believable', 'ordinay', 'man', 'caught', 'up', 'extradorinary', 'situation', 'minute', 'first', 'screen', 'viewers', 'can', 'easily', 'accept', 'surrogate', 'indentifiability', 'what', 'so', 'enthralling', 'disturbing', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'gotten', 'head', 'be', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'Speilberg', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'lucrative', 'rewarding', 'career', 'modern', 'day', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Using', 'techniques', 'would', 'later', 'hone', 'perfection', 'Jaws', 'Spielberg', 'unpretentious', 'massively', 'entertaining', 'horror', 'film', 'never', 'sight', 'reality', 'Working', 'essentially', 'one', 'actor', 'one', 'set', 'Spielberg', 'capture', 'viewer', 'first', 'minute', 'narrative', 'flying', 'next', '90', 'minutes', 'never', 'allowing', 'things', 'slack', 'off', 'never', 'giving', 'viewers', 'reason', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'Especially', 'compared', 'Spielberg', 'later', 'more', 'respectable', 'entertainments', 'Duel', 'ideal', 'Spielberg', 'skill', 'later', 'need', 'prove', 'was', 'capable', 'more', 'just', 'being', 'mere', 'entertainer', 'Duel', 'being', 'young', 'director', 'first', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'everything', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'right', 'when', 'compared', 'later', 'films', 'just', 'perfect', 'example', 'everything', 'Spielberg', 'done', 'wrong', 'then.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'was', 'always', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Watch', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'thriller', 'do']",Duel VHS
200615,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6300181987,Jeffrey Leach,"[5, 5]","Steven Spielberg, more than any other director, has become synonymous with the big budget Hollywood summer blockbuster. His film ""Jaws"" in many ways started the trend, and just about every year or so Spielberg debuts another jaw dropper. Let's see, what films has the big kahuna made since ""Jaws""? Hmmm, it looks like quite a few if his extensive filmography is any indication. After ""Jaws"" came ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" a smash hit that still holds up well today in the special effects department. I guess we'll skip over ""1941"" since it tanked at the box office. Then there is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which needs no explanatory description. If you haven't seen this film, check your vital signs. Ahhh, ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,"" a film that's sure to bring a tear to your eye. I could go on and on, I guess, but the above description is enough to pad out my usual context setting paragraph. Spielberg is a big shot whose films always draw attention, even the bombs. But even Stevie had to start out somewhere, and that's where ""Duel"" comes in. I'm surprised it took this long for the film to reach DVD.Just as ""Jaws"" set the standard for every animal run amok film made since then, ""Duel"" did the same thing for killer car movies. Yes, there is a killer car genre, although it's much smaller than the animals run amok genre. Anyway, ""Duel"" stars veteran actor Dennis Weaver as a sort of average, everyday buttoned down business type who runs into far more than he bargained for during a trip across a deserted stretch of country. At some point in his travels, he angers the driver of an ancient, dirt encrusted semi-truck. Mann--that's Weaver's character--sort of shrugs the belligerent driver off at first and continues on his way. Most of us would do the same thing on a long trip, preferring to pay more attention to the radio and the road than waste time wondering what a touchy truck driver is doing. Heck, most people get mad on the road and then let it pass. At least they did back in the 1970s before road rage reared its ugly head. Problem is, Mann unfortunately angered a total sociopath, and a sociopath tends to NOT let things that irritate them pass by without a response. In no time at all this guy is following Mann, roaring up behind him, trying to run him off the road, and generally making quite a nuisance of himself. When truck drivers want to pose a menace to their fellow citizens on the highway, they can certainly do a good job of it.Events escalate from nuisance to worry to downright fear as the trucker makes it quite clear he won't be happy until Mann dies horribly. He gets Mann so jittery that our hero makes a total fool out of himself at a diner when he thinks a poor guy eating a sandwich is the villain. Oops. Then there is the situation in which a desperate Mann trying to use a pay phone has to dive out of the way as the truck flattens the booth. What in the heck is it going to take to put an end to the madness? Well, Mann is going to have to stand up and be, pardon the pun, a man. He's going to have to swallow his civilization-induced cowardice and put this guy down for the count. It's sort of hard to imagine how Mann can do anything about his situation, however. He doesn't have a cell phone since it's the 1970s, he drives a dinky red car that couldn't run a bicycle off the road, and he's stuck out in the middle of what must be one of the most desolate regions in the nation. There aren't even that many other cars on the road to seek help from, and the few that do pass by make it a point to stay away from any potential problems. It turns out that a bait and switch routine might do the trick, but it all comes down to the wire as the milquetoast makes his final stand. Who will win? If you've seen any of Spielberg's films, the answer shouldn't elude you for long.""Duel,"" considering it's a made-for-television movie, succeeds for a number of reasons. The biggest thing going for the film is that it's based on a Richard Matheson story with a screenplay written by Richard Matheson. He's an old hand at suspense and horror stories, so Spielberg started out with great material before shooting a single frame. The acting chops of Dennis Weaver give the story a lot of oomph as well. No one plays sweat soaked nervous like Weaver (see him in ""Touch of Evil""), and ""Duel"" is another example of this actor carrying panic to the nth degree. Spielberg says in an interview included on the disc that he jumped at the chance to cast Weaver in the film because he wanted a character who would properly convey a sense of overwhelming panic. A final reason the film works is Spielberg's direction. The same interview on the disc serves as a sort of miniature commentary track in which Spielberg relates a lot of the camera tricks he used to give the film a sense of frenzied pace. One interesting factoid concerns the sound effect he used in the film's denouement, an effect he used again in ""Jaws.""Extras on the disc include the thirty-five minute interview with Spielberg (he refuses to do traditional DVD commentaries), an interview with Richard Matheson discussing how the genesis of ""Duel"" came about, an intriguing documentary about Spielberg's early career directing television shows (he worked with Joan Crawford at one point), a photograph and poster gallery, a trailer, and cast and crew biographies and filmographies.

Duel is a film that stands the test of time and delivers more geniune thrills than the majority of todays big budget, formula driven, action ""flicks"".Elements of Duel have been copied, rehashed and borrowed ever since its debut in 1971. You can spot the influence of Duel in such films as ""West World"", ""Terminator"", ""Breakdown"", ""The Hitcher"", ""Mad Max"", and Spielbergs own ""Jaws"" just to name a few! But unlike many of the films that it inspired, Duel remains practically flawless 35 years later.By highlighting the psychological aspects of the script and by shooting the entire film ""on location"" within a thirteen day period a certain timeless magic and a suspesful sense of urgency was captured on film.

Capogrossi,"[3, 3]","I like this DVD, not only because it's the early Speilberg classic, but because the special features are really cool.Of course, you get the classic...A regular, mild mannered 70's salesman from Southern Cal, David Mann (Dennis Weaver) is on a road trip accross the desert to meet a client.On his way, he has a simple run in with a mysterious, rusty, huge deisel truck with an unseen, mystery driver. As everyone knows, you never see the driver throughout the film, but it becomes obvious early on that this driver is crazy and has singled out Dennis Weaver's character for no aparent reason, and continues to terrorize and chase David Mann across the desert, until the climactic showdown.A lot of films that have come out since then have drawn a lot of inspiration from this suspense classic, from the 80's (C Thomas Howell/Rutger Hauer ""The Hitcher"" comes to mind), all the way up to more recent suspense/horror films with more obvious influence from Duel, like Kurt Russell's ""Breakdown"", ""Joyride"" with Paul walker, and of course ""Jeepers Creepers"", which repeats certain lines and camera shots from Duel as an actual tribute...it would have been cool if the Bonus Materials had gone through and interviewed other directors who have referenced Duel in one way or another in later films. As far as suspenseful desert highway films go, this is the classic.I like the original movie for it's 70's style cinematography, (the use of sunlight is really retro 70's, but is still cool) and for the details that, even that early on, Speilberg addded.The special features are really good, especially the extended feature where Speilberg himself talks about the making of the film. Anybody who is an aspiring filmaker (like myself) would find this interview really informative, because he gives a lot of camera tricks and production techniques he used. He also shows the time saving techniques he used to shoot the entire film in as short a time as possible (he was only given 13 days). A lot of cool details are given out about camera angles, production techniques, why and how he picked the truck that was used, and more. Even though the film was made in 1971, a lot of the tricks Speilberg used then are still pretty ingenious, even today. Also the references to past films and filmakers (especially Hitchcock) was cool as well.If you like the movie Duel, or consider yourself a fan of Speilberg's films,  this is a good DVD to get",5,Great movie with interesting Special Features,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,2426,"['like', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'early', 'Speilberg', 'classic', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'cool.Of', 'course', 'get', 'classic', 'regular', 'mild', 'mannered', '70', 'salesman', 'Southern', 'Cal', 'David', 'Mann', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'road', 'trip', 'desert', 'meet', 'client.On', 'way', 'simple', 'run', 'mysterious', 'rusty', 'huge', 'deisel', 'truck', 'unseen', 'mystery', 'driver', 'everyone', 'never', 'see', 'driver', 'film', 'obvious', 'early', 'driver', 'crazy', 'singled', 'out', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'character', 'aparent', 'reason', 'terrorize', 'chase', 'David', 'Mann', 'desert', 'climactic', 'showdown.A', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'then', 'have', 'drawn', 'lot', 'inspiration', 'suspense', 'classic', '80', 'C', 'Thomas', 'Howell/Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Hitcher', 'mind', 'way', 'more', 'recent', 'suspense/horror', 'films', 'more', 'obvious', 'influence', 'Duel', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Breakdown', 'Joyride', 'Paul', 'walker', 'course', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'certain', 'lines', 'camera', 'shots', 'Duel', 'actual', 'tribute', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'Bonus', 'Materials', 'had', 'gone', 'interviewed', 'other', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'referenced', 'Duel', 'one', 'way', 'later', 'films', 'As', 'far', 'suspenseful', 'desert', 'highway', 'films', 'go', 'classic.I', 'original', 'movie', '70', 'style', 'cinematography', 'use', 'sunlight', 'really', 'retro', '70', 'still', 'cool', 'details', 'even', 'early', 'Speilberg', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'especially', 'extended', 'feature', 'where', 'Speilberg', 'talks', 'making', 'film', 'Anybody', 'who', 'aspiring', 'filmaker', 'would', 'find', 'interview', 'really', 'informative', 'lot', 'camera', 'tricks', 'production', 'techniques', 'used', 'also', 'time', 'saving', 'techniques', 'used', 'shoot', 'entire', 'film', 'short', 'time', 'possible', 'was', 'only', 'given', '13', 'days', 'lot', 'cool', 'details', 'are', 'given', 'out', 'camera', 'angles', 'production', 'techniques', 'why', 'how', 'picked', 'truck', 'was', 'used', 'more', 'Even', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1971', 'lot', 'tricks', 'Speilberg', 'used', 'then', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'ingenious', 'even', 'today', 'Also', 'references', 'past', 'films', 'filmakers', 'especially', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'cool', 'well.If', 'movie', 'Duel', 'consider', 'fan', 'Speilberg', 'films', 'good', 'DVD', 'get']",Duel VHS
200626,A25CQTB313XDWO,6300181987,"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland""","[2, 2]","I never get tired of watching this movie. While so many stories center around a protagonist who has strong personal attributes that help create situations where the odds are easily stacked in his or her favor, Duel, on the other hand, portrays the good guy in the form of David Mann, a status quo, well-meaning, down-on-his-luck salesman who comes a lot closer to being like Charlie Brown than he does Arnold Schwarzenegger.While he is traveling through desert areas in the U.S., heading home by taking alternate routes that are sparsely populated, Mann intermittently encounters a madman of a motorist who drives an old, flammable oil tanker. At first, it seems as if this person is just a hazardous, highway irritant that will soon turn off at some other road and that Mann will never see again.The problem is, however, that this oil tanker from Hell keeps appearing and reappearing, creating even more highway havoc, causing Mann's Plymouth to nearly end up in: head-on collisions, rear-end collisions, railroad tracks soon to be occupied by a fast-moving train, and abandoned, deep, isolated, Grand Canyon type territory where Mann could possibly be pushed over the ledge and fall several feet below.Throughout the movie, Weaver portrays the neurotic man in a small car quite well. In one scene, he is so frightened when he is being chased down that he bites his lower lip to the point of bleeding. Scenes of near nervous breakdowns are intermittent but become more frequent as the movie progresses.No matter where he goes, that accursed oil tanker appears. On a parallel note, it reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode of the female motorist who, no matter how fast or how far she goes, there is always that same hitchhiker who keeps thumbing a ride.Near the end, the Plymouth starts to show signs of wear and tear, and Mann, in this overheated vehicle that can no longer accelerate while having this deranged truck driver closing behind him, is screaming, ""Where's the summit?!!!... Come on!!! ... Come on!!!"" It is then that you are truly at the edge of your seat and can feel your muscles tighten up.All in all, this is a gut-wrenching, David versus Goliath classic from Steven Spielberg. And I agree that it can do for the highway what Jaws did for the ocean.As an added note, Steven Spielberg used in the conclusions of both Duel and Jaws the very same sound effects that were borrowed from old B dinosaur movies.",5,The Best Horror Film on the Highway,1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,2424,"['never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'center', 'protagonist', 'who', 'strong', 'personal', 'attributes', 'help', 'create', 'situations', 'where', 'odds', 'are', 'easily', 'stacked', 'favor', 'Duel', 'other', 'hand', 'good', 'guy', 'form', 'David', 'Mann', 'status', 'quo', 'well-meaning', 'down-on-his-luck', 'salesman', 'who', 'lot', 'closer', 'being', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger.While', 'traveling', 'desert', 'areas', 'U.S.', 'heading', 'home', 'taking', 'alternate', 'routes', 'are', 'sparsely', 'populated', 'Mann', 'intermittently', 'madman', 'motorist', 'who', 'old', 'flammable', 'oil', 'tanker', 'first', 'person', 'just', 'hazardous', 'highway', 'irritant', 'will', 'soon', 'turn', 'off', 'other', 'road', 'Mann', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again.The', 'problem', 'however', 'oil', 'tanker', 'Hell', 'appearing', 'reappearing', 'creating', 'even', 'more', 'highway', 'havoc', 'causing', 'Mann', 'Plymouth', 'nearly', 'end', 'up', 'head-on', 'collisions', 'rear-end', 'collisions', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'soon', 'be', 'occupied', 'fast-moving', 'train', 'abandoned', 'deep', 'isolated', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'type', 'territory', 'where', 'Mann', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'pushed', 'ledge', 'fall', 'several', 'feet', 'movie', 'Weaver', 'neurotic', 'man', 'small', 'car', 'quite', 'well', 'one', 'scene', 'so', 'frightened', 'when', 'being', 'chased', 'down', 'lower', 'lip', 'point', 'bleeding', 'Scenes', 'nervous', 'breakdowns', 'are', 'intermittent', 'become', 'more', 'frequent', 'movie', 'progresses.No', 'matter', 'where', 'accursed', 'oil', 'tanker', 'parallel', 'note', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'female', 'motorist', 'who', 'matter', 'how', 'fast', 'how', 'far', 'always', 'same', 'hitchhiker', 'who', 'thumbing', 'ride.Near', 'end', 'Plymouth', 'show', 'signs', 'wear', 'tear', 'Mann', 'overheated', 'vehicle', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'accelerate', 'having', 'deranged', 'truck', 'driver', 'closing', 'screaming', 'Where', 'summit', 'Come', 'Come', 'then', 'are', 'truly', 'edge', 'seat', 'can', 'feel', 'muscles', 'tighten', 'up.All', 'gut-wrenching', 'David', 'versus', 'Goliath', 'classic', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'agree', 'can', 'do', 'highway', 'what', 'Jaws', 'did', 'ocean.As', 'added', 'note', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'used', 'conclusions', 'Duel', 'Jaws', 'very', 'same', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'borrowed', 'old', 'B', 'dinosaur', 'movies']",Duel VHS

Starring Dennis Weaver (David Mann) and Eddie Firestone, Duel is the story of a menacing truck driver terrorising a hapless motorist on the road. Tautly directed and suspenseful, the film is one of Spielberg's most gripping movies.The extra scenes shot for the film's theatrical release consist of a longer set-up, with Weaver driving along listening to the radio, an unnecessary scene where Weaver's character calls up his wife to talk, and one terrifying sequence where the truck driver tries to push Mann's car into a passing train. Spielberg's talent for unique camera shots and technical stunts can all be seen in the film, with some truly shocking moments. The creepy bell-like music adds to the suspense, and Weaver's character growth is surprisingly good, considering the film's short running time. And the inspired idea of never showing the truck driver almost creates a personality for the truck's menace. This is where Spielberg's talent for vivid and shocking storytelling was first shown, as he would go on to direct Jaws (1975) and Jurassic Park (1993). Duel is one of the greats.

In a great and very disturbing scene in a typical truck stop diner, Weaver sees a lineup of similarly attired guys at the counter and tries to figure out which one is the demented trucker.The pacing in this film is flawless, and Weaver's acting has never been better.  The ending is a perfect culmination of the momentum that is so effectively built during the course of the film.For a terrific movie going experience, rent or buy this one.

The man who drives on his way to work and than home to his same routine is caught in this mindless disconnected motoring when suddenly a semi seems to be playing a game of overtake. It starts out as a normal little car power struggle that we all experience yet wends its way to a full blown attempt at murder. The semi driver is never shown so it feels like its between the actual truck and the civilian driver. They try and overtake each other at first, with dangerous speeding and competitiveness, than the civilian takes on another role, it is not a game of who can be first, he begins to become a victim. He doesn't know what to do. He tries to confront the possible trucker at a cafe, but it is the wrong person. He is becoming more and more agitated. He can't lose the guy. It becomes deadly, knocking over a phone booth the civilian is in. Pushing him off the road, where he slams into a guard rail. The civilian isn't in touch with center and pulls off the road and than pulls back on, instead of just stopping and waiting for police, etc. He tries to call them but gives up, cus the phone is demolished. Its like the civilian can't give up his normal routine no matter if death is at stake. The emotion is very well acted by Weaver, who is the main character in this film. He starts out with the normal day to day stress and we see it build and his fear take over and again rational thought seeming to not be as present. The good thing I got from this film was the feeling of something being over. Over and done, no more, alive and safe. Free for the moment and still being alive. Thats when the routine of daily life fades and it doesn't matter anymore, you can sit and throw rocks and know that no one will be hurting you anymore.",3,Stress,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,1872,"['movie', 'filled', 'spirit', 'strife', 'seemed', 'unending', 'footage', 'driving', 'different', 'roads', 'looked', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'way', 'work', 'home', 'same', 'routine', 'caught', 'mindless', 'disconnected', 'motoring', 'when', 'suddenly', 'semi', 'be', 'playing', 'game', 'overtake', 'out', 'normal', 'little', 'car', 'power', 'struggle', 'experience', 'yet', 'way', 'full', 'blown', 'attempt', 'murder', 'semi', 'driver', 'never', 'shown', 'actual', 'truck', 'civilian', 'driver', 'try', 'overtake', 'other', 'first', 'dangerous', 'speeding', 'competitiveness', 'civilian', 'role', 'not', 'game', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'first', 'become', 'victim', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'confront', 'possible', 'trucker', 'cafe', 'wrong', 'person', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'agitated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'guy', 'deadly', 'knocking', 'over', 'phone', 'civilian', 'Pushing', 'road', 'where', 'guard', 'rail', 'civilian', ""n't"", 'touch', 'center', 'road', 'pulls', 'back', 'instead', 'just', 'stopping', 'waiting', 'police', 'etc', 'call', 'up', 'cus', 'phone', 'demolished', 'civilian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'normal', 'routine', 'matter', 'death', 'stake', 'emotion', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'Weaver', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'out', 'normal', 'day', 'day', 'stress', 'see', 'build', 'fear', 'take', 'again', 'rational', 'thought', 'seeming', 'not', 'be', 'present', 'good', 'thing', 'got', 'film', 'was', 'feeling', 'something', 'being', 'over', 'done', 'more', 'alive', 'safe', 'Free', 'moment', 'still', 'being', 'alive', 'Thats', 'when', 'routine', 'daily', 'life', 'fades', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anymore', 'can', 'sit', 'throw', 'rocks', 'know', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'hurting', 'anymore']",Duel VHS

If you're in the mood for a good Hitchcock-like movie, this is it. Watch it when you're home alone at night.  The film stars Dennis Weaver and THE TRUCK. It starts out looking thru the lens of a camera mounted on the front bumper of a car backing out of the garage, then driving thru the suburban Los Angeles neighborhood, into the rush hour traffic of the LA freeway system. When you finally meet the middle-aged salesman on his way to meet a client somewhere outside of LA in a rural, desert area, he's turned off the freeway onto a lonely, two lane highway. That's where you also meet the co-star of the film, the Peterbilt truck with the tanker trailer. Peterbilt has the long, menacing-looking hood (the face) and the small windows (eyes) and this one looks like it went thru the Vietnam War and is dirty and greasy and has a set of various state license plates on the front bumper (which you learn in the commentary represent each state where he has killed a motorist). Sick of the diesel smoke blowing in the window of his red 4 door Plymouth Valiant sedan, Dennis Weaver looks for an opening to pass THE TRUCK. Whether it was passing it that triggered the decision to terrorize the motorist or he was just waiting for the right victim to come along, we don't know but we keep waiting to see the driver and there are many suspenseful moments when you think the two men will confront each other face to face. The movie is full of suspense as THE TRUCK tries to run Weaver down in the mountains and desert of rural California on a lonely highway. The suspense is constant so that you don't want to turn away for a minute or you might miss something. There is little or no foul language, no sex, just good old fashioned suspense and a fist fight and some vehicles doing damage to property. Very climactic ending. The movie was made entirely on location in 12 days, a phenomenal accomplishment.  Watch the interview with Spielberg and you will get a feel for the genius of him as a filmmaker.

After seeing that, I made it my personal quest to find the film DUEL, but because of where I live, this was very difficult. In fact, it took me a good year and a half, at least. I found it while visiting family back home, and it was SOOOO worth the wait. The story centers on David Mann (Dennis Weaver, in a role he oughta get more credit for) a rather timid salesman on a drive through theMojave Desert for an appointment. He is so naive as to cut in front of a diesel truck. Next thing he knows, the crazy driver is in relentless pursuit of Mann. Taht's about all there is to this movie, but what's cool is that the driver of the truck, save for his hands at the steering wheel and his cowboy boots, is never, NOT ONCE seen in this movie, making it twice as scary as it already was. It's really quite easy to feel sorry for poor old David. The crazy trucker tries shoving him into an oncoming train for God's sake!!!

Based on a Richard Matheson short story, Steven Spielberg's first real directing effort stands as one of the most sublimely suspenseful films made.  Although a TV movie, it ranks up there with some of the cinema's most interesting and different thrillers.The story is pretty simple and one millions of commuters will find familiar:  a traveling salesman (played laconically and superbly by Dennis Weaver) is late for an appointment.  So he does what any driver would do:  he passes a fuel truck.  But it seems the driver doesn't want anyone to pass him, so he returns the favor, many times.  It becomes clear that this particular trucker is a vengeful, actually psychotic man, as he relentlessly pursues Weaver, obviously to kill him.  Spielberg made the wise choice of not showing us the truck driver, so in essence, the truck itself becomes the Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, etc. of the film.DUEL doesn't have splashy effects, no bloodshed, and a slam bang of an ending.  If it seems preposterous and dated, remember it's 1971, folks, and this kind of movie wasn't being made.  Spielberg and Weaver are to be commended on taking so little and winding up with so much.An innovative film, and evidence of great things to come from Spielberg.",5,VALIANT ROAD RAGE,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,1308,"['33', 'years', 'later', 'DUEL', 'excellent', 'exercise', 'filmmaking', 'Based', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'short', 'story', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'real', 'directing', 'effort', 'one', 'most', 'sublimely', 'suspenseful', 'films', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'cinema', 'most', 'interesting', 'different', 'thrillers.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'one', 'millions', 'commuters', 'will', 'find', 'familiar', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'played', 'laconically', 'superbly', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'late', 'appointment', 'So', 'what', 'driver', 'would', 'do', 'fuel', 'truck', 'driver', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'pass', 'favor', 'many', 'times', 'clear', 'particular', 'trucker', 'vengeful', 'actually', 'psychotic', 'man', 'relentlessly', 'Weaver', 'obviously', 'kill', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'wise', 'choice', 'not', 'showing', 'truck', 'driver', 'so', 'essence', 'truck', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'etc', 'film.DUEL', ""n't"", 'have', 'splashy', 'effects', 'bloodshed', 'slam', 'bang', 'ending', 'preposterous', 'dated', 'remember', '1971', 'folks', 'kind', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'made', 'Spielberg', 'Weaver', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'taking', 'so', 'little', 'winding', 'up', 'so', 'much.An', 'innovative', 'film', 'evidence', 'great', 'things', 'come', 'Spielberg']",Duel VHS

(It would be nice if, like the DVD of the Bogart/Bacall &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, both versions were on the disc...)(Incidentally, just as this was the first of many films, ranging from excellent to execrable, for Spielberg, it was also the beginning of his reputation for never finishing a film within budget or on schedule -- he ran over on both.)",5,Some Points Noticed in Other Reviews,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,1505,"['perusing', 'others', 'reviews', 'gem', 'i', 'find', 'rather', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'cited', 'most', 'often', 'exemplary', 'cafe', 'scene', 'Weaver', 'character', 'attempts', 'see', 'other', 'patrons', 'might', 'be', 'driver', 'truck.What', 'amusing', 'one', 'scenes', 'added', 'expand', 'original', '77-minute', 'version', '90-plus', 'minutes', 'make', 'suitable', 'theatrical', 'release', 'mainly', 'Europe', 'local', 'US', 'television', '77', 'minutes', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'fit', 'local', 'tv', '90-minute', 'commercials', 'too', 'short', 'two-hour', 'local', 'tv', 'slot', '92', 'minutes', 'just', 'perfect', 'local', 'tv', 'two-hour', 'slot', 'Other', 'added', 'scenes', 'include', 'phone', 'conversation', 'wife', 'also', 'cited', 'one', 'more', 'reviewers', 'i', 'think', 'been', 'while', 'i', 'saw', 'short', 'version', 'scene', 'Lou', 'Frizzel', 'schoolbus', 'added', 'material', 'school', 'bus', 'scene', 'fun', 'alter', 'overall', 'pacing', 'form', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'shown.As', 'i', ""'ve"", 'said', 'maybe', 'when', 'get', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'so', 'arranged', 'can', 'see', 'version', 'so', 'desire', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'DVD', 'Bogart/Bacall', 'quot', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'quot', 'versions', 'were', 'disc', 'Incidentally', 'just', 'was', 'first', 'many', 'films', 'ranging', 'excellent', 'execrable', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'also', 'beginning', 'reputation', 'never', 'finishing', 'film', 'budget', 'schedule', 'ran', 'over']",Duel VHS

Then again never putting a face on the driver is a great move, it doesn't make the man and the truck human it's just this thing relentlessly chasing us, when you remember the movie you don't remember this specific guy chasing another you remember this thing coming after you.  That truck could symbolize anything we've been pursued by or feel unable to escape from be it credit cards, secrets, guilt or anything else you could think of, and for David Mann it could be guilt.  In an earlier phone conversation with his wife we learn that the night before David and his wife went to a party and another man was very disrespectful to his wife and David did nothing, which angered the wife and caused a fight.  Now here is this truck that is terrorizing him and David tries and thinks of every way possible to avoid confrontation and tries to rationalize what he did even though this guy is trying to kill him, but unlike the man at the party and I'm sure other times in David's life he is being forced to face his problems and isn't allowed a way out.For all we know maybe after that fight with his wife and feeling emasculated David could've gone to bed and we are witnessing his dream.The movie is interactive i challenge anyone to watch this with a group of friends at their house preferably with drinking involved and not talk to the screen.  We've all been in little altercations on the road and we all have an opinion on what David should do, i myself was annoyed with David many times.Duel is also ranked 67th on Bravo channel's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, which was a great show.THE DVD:  The transfer looked great and the DTS 5.1 soundtrack gave my Sonus Faber speakers a good work out.Thanks for reading and share any thoughts you have.",4,Chase Visa,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,1905,"['first', 'i', 'thought', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'Duel', 'was', 'simple', 'story', 'guy', 'road', 'who', 'man', 'man', 'going', 'terrorize', 'Then', 'again', 'never', 'putting', 'face', 'driver', 'great', 'move', ""n't"", 'make', 'man', 'truck', 'human', 'just', 'thing', 'relentlessly', 'chasing', 'when', 'remember', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'specific', 'guy', 'chasing', 'remember', 'thing', 'coming', 'truck', 'could', 'symbolize', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pursued', 'feel', 'unable', 'escape', 'be', 'credit', 'cards', 'secrets', 'guilt', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'think', 'David', 'Mann', 'could', 'be', 'guilt', 'earlier', 'phone', 'conversation', 'wife', 'learn', 'night', 'David', 'wife', 'went', 'party', 'man', 'was', 'very', 'disrespectful', 'wife', 'David', 'did', 'nothing', 'angered', 'wife', 'caused', 'fight', 'Now', 'here', 'truck', 'terrorizing', 'David', 'tries', 'thinks', 'way', 'possible', 'avoid', 'confrontation', 'tries', 'rationalize', 'what', 'did', 'even', 'guy', 'trying', 'kill', 'man', 'party', ""'m"", 'sure', 'other', 'times', 'David', 'life', 'being', 'forced', 'face', 'problems', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'way', 'know', 'maybe', 'fight', 'wife', 'feeling', 'emasculated', 'David', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'bed', 'are', 'witnessing', 'dream.The', 'movie', 'interactive', 'i', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'watch', 'group', 'friends', 'house', 'preferably', 'drinking', 'involved', 'not', 'talk', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'altercations', 'road', 'have', 'opinion', 'what', 'David', 'should', 'do', 'i', 'was', 'annoyed', 'David', 'many', 'times.Duel', 'also', 'ranked', '67th', 'Bravo', 'channel', '100', 'Scariest', 'Movie', 'Moments', 'was', 'great', 'show.THE', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'looked', 'great', 'DTS', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'gave', 'Sonus', 'Faber', 'speakers', 'good', 'work', 'out.Thanks', 'reading', 'share', 'thoughts', 'have']",Duel VHS

The story line is well covered by other reviewers, so i'll spend a moment on other areas.  Duel reminds me of the kind of suspense Hitchcock was so well known for and a little bit like some of Stephen King's works.  This movie builds a generic character (Dennis Weaver) as just a normal guy.  The kind of guy you see every day in the restaurant, or car beside you.  The development of his character and who he is throughout the movie is intriquing from the start.  Opening: he backs out of his non descript suburban home, drives down his street, 'coasts' through the stop sign to turn right(St. Louis stop hehehe).  Them proceeds down a business district street.  He drives STRAIGHT thru a left turn only lane, then as he approaches pedestrians in the cross walk, slows just enough to let them cross in front of him.  All very typical driving patterns of people who don't have a policeman in their rear view mirror.  He drives through a lonely stretch of highway listening to talk radio and talks to himself as a comment or laugh at what's being said.  We've all been behind people driving (not just trucks) who seem to ignore basic courtesy, traffic laws, and common sense.  In this case, the trucker is downright crazy or suffers from a severe case of road rage.  Weaver's character changes as the movie progresses.  Instead of being the 'nice guy' don't make waves guy, or passive driver, he becomes aggressive, defensive, and vindictive while still remaining the victim.  Indeed the Duel is a most interesting character study and an excellent story.  It brings out the inner hidden feelings most of us have or would have if put into an unbelievable/outlandish situation.  In the Duel, we experience that rarity, temporary suspension of disbelief.",5,Classic Suspense,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,1841,"['Duel', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'One', 'i', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'shelf', 'view', 'again', 'again', 'story', 'line', 'well', 'covered', 'other', 'reviewers', 'i', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'moment', 'other', 'areas', 'Duel', 'kind', 'suspense', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'little', 'bit', 'Stephen', 'King', 'works', 'movie', 'generic', 'character', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'just', 'normal', 'guy', 'kind', 'guy', 'see', 'day', 'restaurant', 'car', 'development', 'character', 'who', 'movie', 'intriquing', 'start', 'Opening', 'non', 'descript', 'suburban', 'home', 'down', 'street', ""'coasts"", 'stop', 'sign', 'turn', 'right', 'St.', 'Louis', 'stop', 'hehehe', 'Them', 'down', 'business', 'district', 'street', 'STRAIGHT', 'thru', 'left', 'turn', 'only', 'then', 'pedestrians', 'cross', 'walk', 'just', 'enough', 'let', 'cross', 'front', 'very', 'typical', 'driving', 'patterns', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'policeman', 'rear', 'view', 'mirror', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'highway', 'listening', 'talk', 'radio', 'talks', 'comment', 'laugh', 'what', 'being', 'said', ""'ve"", 'been', 'people', 'driving', 'not', 'just', 'trucks', 'who', 'seem', 'ignore', 'basic', 'courtesy', 'traffic', 'laws', 'common', 'sense', 'case', 'trucker', 'downright', 'crazy', 'suffers', 'severe', 'case', 'road', 'rage', 'Weaver', 'character', 'changes', 'movie', 'Instead', 'being', ""'nice"", 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'waves', 'guy', 'passive', 'driver', 'aggressive', 'defensive', 'vindictive', 'still', 'remaining', 'victim', 'Indeed', 'Duel', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'excellent', 'story', 'out', 'inner', 'hidden', 'feelings', 'most', 'have', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'unbelievable/outlandish', 'situation', 'Duel', 'experience', 'rarity', 'temporary', 'suspension', 'disbelief']",Duel VHS

200665,A3I4EX7TBWUT1U,6300181987,"""patrick_mcknight""","[6, 8]","This riveting suspense film helped to launch the career of a then unknown young filmmaker by the name of Steven Spielberg. Though made for TV, it became clear upon its release that both the film and Spielberg were too good for television. The film was released in Europe with some added scenes (well integrated) and got great reviews and business, while Spielberg graduated to feature films becoming the most financially successful filmmaker of all time.Dennis Weaver stars as David Mann, a mild mannered business man on his way to a meeting. Driving along a lonely stretch of road in the California desert listening to the radio, Mann reflects upon an argument he had with his wife the night before. It seems that a guy at a party they were at made a drunken pass at Mann's wife, and she is angry that Mann did not come to her rescue.""Well what was I supposed to do?"" Mann demands talking to his wife from a pay phone, ""challenge him to a fist fight?""Little does the emasculated Mann know how prophetic those words are to be.Mann's seemingly benign journey takes a frightening turn when he makes the mistake of passing a gigantic, beat-up looking diesel truck on the highway. The truck driver is so offended by this, that he makes it his unrelenting mission to eliminate Mann. Now Mann is in a desperate battle for survival against the Goliath-like truck who will stop at nothing to wipe him off the face of the earth.Spielberg successfully captures the baren look of the desert while portraying Mann's increasingly frantic state of mind. As Mann is chased across the desert, he must contend with not only the psychotic truck driver, but also the unhelpful deadbeat locals who inhabit this God foresaken land. Ultimately Mann is left to his own devices. The truck driver (who is never seen), becomes the very personification of Mann's inner demons. Mann must take on the truck driver and in the process overcome his feelings of emasculation.That's about if for plot, but don't despair. This is one of the most heartpounding suspense films ever made. It is also a foreshadowing of the spectacular career upon which Spielberg was to embark.

Duel is a psychological film with Dennis Weaver in my opinion giving his finest ever performance(and I am a big Gunsmoke fan)worthy of a Oscar.The camera work is great and the close ups of the truck with that oily look make it even better.When Spielburg had to extend the film he had to scour the U.S for the same kind of truck remembering he had wrote the original off at the end of the movie.You can see the colors are just a bit off when the truck goes to help the stranded school bus but other than that there is not many faults with the film in any other aspect.This film should be used by film students as a learning tool on how to make a great film on a small budget , we actually need to start making tv movies like this again so one day we might find another Spielburg.",5,Duel-The Best Of Spielburg,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,1660,"['Well', 'Duel', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'Jaws', 'favourite', 'film', 'time', 'lot', 'ways', 'Duel', 'movie.I', 'first', 'saw', 'television', 'early', '70', 'then', 'brought', 'out', 'theatres', 'extra', 'scene', 'bus', 'different', 'truck', 'brought', 'running', 'time', 'more', 'theatrical', 'release.I', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'guy', 'who', 'not', 'love', 'film', 'wife', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'ladies', 'will', 'be', 'fan', 'suspect', 'more', 'guy', 'kind', 'film.There', 'are', 'three', 'road', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'early', 'mid', '70', 'define', 'era', 'are', 'Duel', 'Vanashing', 'Point', 'Dirty', 'Mary', 'Crazy', 'Larry-now', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'triple', 'feature', 'get', 'back', 'Duel.I', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'Spielburg', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'when', 'made', 'even', 'made', 'great', 'films', 'last', '40', 'years', 'Duel', 'psychological', 'film', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'opinion', 'giving', 'finest', 'ever', 'performance', 'am', 'big', 'Gunsmoke', 'fan', 'worthy', 'Oscar.The', 'camera', 'work', 'great', 'close', 'ups', 'truck', 'oily', 'look', 'make', 'even', 'better.When', 'Spielburg', 'had', 'extend', 'film', 'had', 'scour', 'U.S', 'same', 'kind', 'truck', 'remembering', 'had', 'wrote', 'original', 'off', 'end', 'movie.You', 'can', 'see', 'colors', 'are', 'just', 'bit', 'off', 'when', 'truck', 'help', 'stranded', 'school', 'bus', 'other', 'not', 'many', 'faults', 'film', 'other', 'aspect.This', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'film', 'students', 'learning', 'tool', 'how', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'small', 'budget', 'actually', 'need', 'start', 'making', 'tv', 'movies', 'again', 'so', 'one', 'day', 'might', 'find', 'Spielburg']",Duel VHS

Collette ""rcollette""","[17, 19]","Duel is an especially effective film because it plays upon the fears of man, specifically the fear of losing control over a seemingly routine situation that, without warning, becomes life threatening.  What this movie  does is take a common, ordinary human being (he could be anyone of us) and  puts him in a horrific clash against an unknown assailant: a savage truck  driver whose person (as well as motive) is never revealed to him.The  film opens to nothing more than the view from the hood of a car as it  progresses on a long business commute through a suburb, city, and finally a  rural, desert area.  There is a very special purpose for why there is no  dialogue, action, or character development in the first 15 minutes...it  sets the mood and condition: Dennis Weaver plays the driver, but we are  never allowed to know enough about him where we can separate his identity  from our own.  Thus, we become the driver, alone and quietly listening to  the radio, just trying to reach our destination.  And then the adversary  arrives, almost imperceptibly as just another vehicle on the road...a  large, rusted truck.  The truck's actions seem innocuous, even playful at  first.  But the scenes grow more unpredictable and terrifying with each  encounter.  Now we see ourselves as the driver, alone on an empty highway,  radio turned off, and just trying to stay alive.  Weaver's anger and  bewilderment matches our own as he struggles to regain control of a  situation that pits man against beast, David against Goliath.Spielberg's  first effort, this film shows flashes of the brilliance that would come to  signify his finest works, including Jaws and Close Encounters.

200697,A3FZ06XRKW5JC5,6300181987,"snalen ""snalen""","[3, 3]","Since the astronomical success of `Jaws' in 1975, Steven Spielberg has had numerous opportunities to show us what he can do with a monster budget. Here, in what began life as an improbably good TV movie, we get to see what the youthful Spielberg could do with a budget of, by his later standards, more or less nothing. The answer is quite a lot. Indeed this is, in very many ways, a far better thriller than, say, `Jurassic Park' or `Minority Report'.It's a story of extreme simplicity. It begins with a middle-aged businessman, David Mann, about whom we know almost nothing except his name, that he is married and that he is heading for a business meeting and hopes to be back in time for dinner, sets off on a long road journey north from Los Angeles in a rather tired-looking red Plymouth that could do with a service. As he comes into the mountains he gets stuck behind a huge dirty great truck. He overtakes it but then it overtakes him back. So he overtakes it again and in doing so, it would seem, he annoys Mr Truck Driver. Annoys him quite a lot. To begin with Truck Driver won't let him overtake again, swerving about to block the road. Then Truck Driver maliciously waves him forward just as an oncoming car is approaching at speed. Then Truck Driver gives chase and sets out to run him off the road. From here on, this continuing game of cat and mouse makes up the entire film. There is never any explanation of why Truck Driver reacts in such an extreme way to so mild a provocation. Indeed we never ever see Truck Driver, only his darkened windscreen, his upper arms, and, at one point, his feet. (Not quite accurate that: we do, perhaps, see him in a group of people but neither we nor Mann knows which, if any, of them is he.) . His behaviour is so strange and his ability to double-guess Mann's movements so considerable that at times indeed it is a bit ambiguous whether we are watching a regular crime thriller or some sort of supernatural story. This extreme simplicity of plot and complete lack of any good explanation for Truck Driver's insane behaviour are both significant artistic risks to be taking but contribute highly effectively to creating a unique movie shot through with something of the terrifying intensity of a real nightmare.Mann is the only character apart from the unseen truck driver and a few very tiny other roles and his role is ably carried by Dennis Weaver. This being low budget land, Weaver isn't the most famous actor in cinema history, but he nonetheless enjoys a certain iconic status among film lovers for having been the unforgettable `Night Man' in Welles' `Touch of Evil'. As that would lead one to expect, he is rather good at nervous, something much called for here.The movie is very well thought out. Given the simplicity of the story, 90 minutes takes a bit of filling. Straight truck-chases-car would hardly fill it so it's necessary to raise and lower the intensity of the action and vary the forms taken by the truck driver's murderous aggression in ways that call for - and receive - a fair bit of ingenuity. And of course, it's beautifully directed.I have only one quibble, just for the sake of finding fault. At times I was reminded of the fictitious screenwriters' manual employed by the Donald Kaufman in `Adaptation' with its central injunction to avoid voiceover at all cost. A hugely overstated injunction of course as voiceover can be a splendid thing in his place but here I think the manual has it dead right. Occasional voiceovers by Weaver, employed to let the audience listen in on his unspoken thoughts, seem something of a cop-out. The audience could and should be trusted to make sense of his actions well enough without them and I think the film would have been more powerful and dramatic had they simply been dispensed with. But that's about all I can think of to object to in this genuinely exciting and beautifully put together little movie.",5,A Minor Masterpiece of Narrative Simplicity,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,3923,"['astronomical', 'success', 'Jaws', '1975', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'numerous', 'opportunities', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'monster', 'budget', 'Here', 'what', 'began', 'life', 'improbably', 'good', 'TV', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'youthful', 'Spielberg', 'could', 'do', 'budget', 'later', 'standards', 'more', 'less', 'nothing', 'answer', 'quite', 'lot', 'Indeed', 'very', 'many', 'ways', 'far', 'better', 'thriller', 'say', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Minority', ""Report'.It"", 'story', 'extreme', 'simplicity', 'middle-aged', 'businessman', 'David', 'Mann', 'about', 'whom', 'know', 'almost', 'nothing', 'name', 'married', 'heading', 'business', 'meeting', 'be', 'back', 'time', 'dinner', 'off', 'long', 'road', 'journey', 'north', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'rather', 'tired-looking', 'red', 'Plymouth', 'could', 'do', 'service', 'mountains', 'stuck', 'huge', 'dirty', 'great', 'truck', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'seem', 'Mr', 'Truck', 'Driver', 'Annoys', 'quite', 'lot', 'begin', 'Truck', 'Driver', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'overtake', 'again', 'swerving', 'block', 'road', 'Then', 'Truck', 'Driver', 'maliciously', 'forward', 'just', 'oncoming', 'car', 'approaching', 'speed', 'Then', 'Truck', 'Driver', 'chase', 'out', 'run', 'off', 'road', 'here', 'continuing', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'up', 'entire', 'film', 'never', 'explanation', 'why', 'Truck', 'Driver', 'such', 'extreme', 'way', 'so', 'mild', 'provocation', 'Indeed', 'never', 'ever', 'see', 'Truck', 'Driver', 'only', 'darkened', 'windscreen', 'upper', 'arms', 'one', 'point', 'feet', 'Not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'do', 'perhaps', 'see', 'group', 'people', 'Mann', 'behaviour', 'so', 'strange', 'ability', 'double-guess', 'Mann', 'movements', 'so', 'considerable', 'times', 'indeed', 'bit', 'ambiguous', 'are', 'watching', 'regular', 'crime', 'thriller', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'story', 'extreme', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'complete', 'lack', 'good', 'explanation', 'Truck', 'Driver', 'insane', 'behaviour', 'are', 'significant', 'artistic', 'risks', 'be', 'taking', 'contribute', 'highly', 'effectively', 'creating', 'unique', 'movie', 'shot', 'something', 'terrifying', 'intensity', 'real', 'nightmare.Mann', 'only', 'character', 'apart', 'unseen', 'truck', 'driver', 'few', 'very', 'tiny', 'other', 'roles', 'role', 'ably', 'carried', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'being', 'low', 'budget', 'land', 'Weaver', ""n't"", 'most', 'famous', 'actor', 'cinema', 'history', 'nonetheless', 'certain', 'iconic', 'status', 'film', 'lovers', 'having', 'been', 'unforgettable', 'Night', 'Man', 'Welles', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'expect', 'rather', 'good', 'nervous', 'something', 'much', 'called', 'here.The', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'Given', 'simplicity', 'story', '90', 'minutes', 'bit', 'filling', 'Straight', 'truck-chases-car', 'would', 'hardly', 'fill', 'necessary', 'raise', 'lower', 'intensity', 'action', 'vary', 'forms', 'taken', 'truck', 'driver', 'murderous', 'aggression', 'ways', 'call', 'receive', 'fair', 'bit', 'ingenuity', 'course', 'beautifully', 'directed.I', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'quibble', 'just', 'sake', 'finding', 'fault', 'times', 'was', 'reminded', 'fictitious', 'screenwriters', 'manual', 'employed', 'Donald', 'Kaufman', 'Adaptation', 'central', 'injunction', 'avoid', 'voiceover', 'cost', 'hugely', 'overstated', 'injunction', 'course', 'voiceover', 'can', 'be', 'splendid', 'thing', 'place', 'here', 'think', 'manual', 'dead', 'right', 'Occasional', 'voiceovers', 'Weaver', 'employed', 'let', 'audience', 'listen', 'unspoken', 'thoughts', 'seem', 'something', 'cop-out', 'audience', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'trusted', 'make', 'sense', 'actions', 'well', 'enough', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'had', 'simply', 'been', 'dispensed', 'can', 'think', 'object', 'genuinely', 'exciting', 'beautifully', 'put', 'together', 'little', 'movie']",Duel VHS
200698,A178LLZ84A2JB5,6300181987,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[2, 2]","Duel was created by a young Steven Spielberg, way back before he became a Hollywood legend. No other film maker does suspense, like Spielberg does. This is certainly evident with Duel, which was Spielberg's first film. Dennis Weaver is cast as the main character, named David Mann. David is a rather milquetoast traveling salesman. He's a bit afraid of his demanding wife, and under constant pressure to perform well at his job.One day, David sets out on a long road trip, to handle some important business at his job. David travels lots of deserted highways, to get to his destination. He has no reason to expect his journey to be anything other than a pleasant drive, out on those remote highways. But a deranged trucker harasses David out on the road, and turns his otherwise routine business trip into a nightmare.This film belongs entirely to Dennis Weaver, as David. The few supporting characters, seem to be just incidental to the plot. Spielberg made sure that the whole thrust of the story-line, was intensely focused on David, and his quest to escape the insane trucker. None of the other characters take David seriously anyhow, when he tries to get their help to fend-off the trucker. David realizes in horror, that he is left all alone, to defend himself.Dennis Weaver does a superb job, of portraying the terrified David Mann. Weaver makes the viewer believe that David is utterly shocked and bewildered, by his predicament. Spielberg's genius at milking every iota of the film's suspense element, is everywhere in this movie. For instance, the viewer always wonders if David will ever identify the trucker, or why the trucker is after him to begin with. Also, just as the trucker is closing in on David, David's car starts to malfunction. This is one of the most spine-tingling parts of the film, that will have you on the edge of your seat.Duel is a sparse film. It was made during an era when most films lacked all of the frills, of today's overblown 'blockbusters'. It's all substance, without a slick veneer of style. If you like movies with genuine, cliff-hanger suspense and visceral thrills, then Duel is a must-see.",5,Steven Spielberg's first masterpiece.,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2137,"['Duel', 'was', 'created', 'young', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'way', 'back', 'became', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'other', 'film', 'maker', 'suspense', 'Spielberg', 'certainly', 'evident', 'Duel', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'film', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'cast', 'main', 'character', 'named', 'David', 'Mann', 'David', 'rather', 'milquetoast', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'bit', 'afraid', 'demanding', 'wife', 'constant', 'pressure', 'perform', 'well', 'job.One', 'day', 'David', 'out', 'long', 'road', 'trip', 'handle', 'important', 'business', 'job', 'David', 'lots', 'deserted', 'highways', 'get', 'destination', 'reason', 'expect', 'journey', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'pleasant', 'drive', 'remote', 'highways', 'deranged', 'trucker', 'David', 'out', 'road', 'otherwise', 'routine', 'business', 'trip', 'nightmare.This', 'film', 'belongs', 'entirely', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'David', 'few', 'supporting', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'incidental', 'plot', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'sure', 'whole', 'thrust', 'story-line', 'was', 'intensely', 'focused', 'David', 'quest', 'escape', 'insane', 'trucker', 'None', 'other', 'characters', 'take', 'David', 'seriously', 'anyhow', 'when', 'get', 'help', 'fend-off', 'trucker', 'David', 'horror', 'left', 'alone', 'defend', 'himself.Dennis', 'Weaver', 'superb', 'job', 'portraying', 'terrified', 'David', 'Mann', 'viewer', 'believe', 'David', 'utterly', 'shocked', 'bewildered', 'predicament', 'Spielberg', 'genius', 'milking', 'iota', 'film', 'suspense', 'element', 'everywhere', 'movie', 'instance', 'viewer', 'always', 'wonders', 'David', 'will', 'ever', 'identify', 'trucker', 'why', 'trucker', 'begin', 'Also', 'just', 'trucker', 'closing', 'David', 'David', 'car', 'malfunction', 'one', 'most', 'spine-tingling', 'parts', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat.Duel', 'sparse', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'era', 'when', 'most', 'films', 'lacked', 'frills', 'today', 'overblown', ""'blockbusters"", 'substance', 'slick', 'veneer', 'style', 'like', 'movies', 'genuine', 'cliff-hanger', 'suspense', 'visceral', 'thrills', 'then', 'Duel', 'must-see']",Duel VHS

Get that fat-*ss truck outta my way!"" - David Mann gets his road-rage face on & starts ""Duel""Before the term ""road-rage"" was coined there was Steven Spielberg's first film. ""Duel"" still holds its punch 33 years after its movie of the week debut.David Mann is a simple business man, late for a convention thats taking him cross country to get there. It seems that he's making good time, that is, until, an old tanker truck gets in his path, and won't let Mann pass at any cost, except, with the cost of his own life. But, when Mann sees an opening and slips past the truck, an annoying situation escalates into a dangerous game of cat & mouse as the truck and its unknown driver hunts down, teases, & taunts Mann, & his crappy Dodge Dart, all over the Arizona highway.The film is still great. Its like a feature length episode of ""The Twilight Zone"". Dennis Weaver is at his best as David Mann, who seems confindent, one of the guys that seems to have an infinite amount of patience, at the films beginning, but, at films end he's a nerve-shattered shell of his formerself & you wonder if he would ever drive a vehicle again, let alone sit in one!Spielberg shows his first flair for suspense in ""Duel"" with the school bus sequence and the gas station attack (if you weren't at least on the edge of your seat when Mann was trying to help the kids & the school bus out while the truck ominously watched in the wings, you better check your pulse!).""Duel"" is one of those films that makes you think twice about showing off your road-rage & flipping someone off after they cut you off on the highway.

200706,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6300181987,T O'Brien,"[1, 1]","Duel is a great thriller starring Dennis Weaver from first time director Steven Spielberg.  Businessman David Mann is on his way to a business meeting when he nonchalantly passes a huge semi-truck on the interstate.  Before he even knows what is going on, Mann is being hunted down by the trucker.  At a crisp 90 minutes, this movie never slows down keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  The viewer feels like you're there with Mann as the truck driver continuously tries to kill him.  What makes this made for TV movie that much more effective is that the truck driver is never shown, leaving the viewer to imagine what he looks like.  And just like Jaws made you scared of getting back in the water, Duel will make you wary of getting on an interstate the next time you need to go somewhere.Dennis Weaver is excellent as David Mann, the businessman being hunted down by a murderous truck driver in his gas tanker.  Weaver's emotions are completely realistic making the whole movie seem that much more real.  The fact that this could happen to anybody makes this movie all that more terrifying.  While Weaver is the only person with a big part, the huge semi-truck deserves billing as a character.  The truck is just as scary as the shark in Jaws because of its immense size and speed.  The long overdue Special Edition DVD features the standard presentation of the movie, a 35-minute interview with Spielberg about the making of Duel, a featurette about Spielberg's background in television, a brief interview with the author of the short story Duel, Richard Matheson, a poster gallery, and a theatrical trailer.

A motorist (Dennis Weaver) is on a long journey when he incurs the wrath of a murderous truck (I say 'truck' and not 'truckdriver', because the truck itself is the character - a monster on the rampage). The rest of the movie is spent in Weaver trying to get away from the truck. Every aspect of the movie underscores the motorist's puniness and lack of power; his car gives him trouble; it is not as fast as the truck, and the driver tries (in vain) to indentify who the truck driver is.In fact, we never see the truck driver. We only see an occasional arm or hand. This emphasises the fact that the truck is like a prehistoric monster with demonic strength.Dennis Weaver is superb.

""Duel"" has the assured hand of a veteran film director and while Spielberg had been directing television programs (""The Name of the Game"", ""Night Gallery"" among many others), he had yet to make his big screen theatrical debut. ""Duel"" made it all possible.Based on Richard Matheson's fine short story and original screenplay, ""Duel"" was part of ABC's amibitious efforts to produce original movies of the week. Others included the Ted post thriller ""Night Slaves""(1970) and ""Killdozer""(1974)(based on Ted Sturgeon's short story and, although not as memorable, it was a fine TV movie and influenced a certain Stephen King on his directorial debut as well for ""Maximum Overdrive""). Dennis Weaver stars as a David Mann (as generic a name and universal as possible with some interesting biblical references as well) returning home after a long period on the road. He passes the driver of a big rig truck. Roadrage takes effect and this mysterious driver (we never see his face)like Spielberg's shark in ""Jaws"" irrationally hunts the man in this game of cat and mouse trying to kill him.Having seen the 90 minute version on laserdisc when it was released a couple of years ago, I can comment on the theatrical version vs. the original broadcast version of the movie. The scene in the diner was, indeed, in the original broadcast version but much of the other footage involving his phone call to his wife, etc. was not. While is does dissapate some of the suspense of the original, tighter wound version it also adds some nice character moments fleshing out Mann in ways that were only hinted at before. Matheson (a novelist well known in Science Fiction and Horror circles as the author of the classics I AM LEGEND, HELL HOUSE and for the big and little screen ""The Night Stalker"", ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", ""Star Trek"" and ""The Twilight Zone"")creates a tense, simple but powerful story that Spielberg twists into a small screen masterpiece.An under rated actor, Dennis Weaver (""Gunsmoke"" and ""McCloud"" among many other TV programs)gives a performance that turns from thoughtful to animalistic rage within the course of an hour and a half. The production values aren't high for the film (it's set in the middle of nowhere and really involves just a single actor for much of the movie)but the editing by Frank Morris and music by creepy music by Billy Goldenberg slather on additional tension to an already tightly wound movie.This film pointed the way to ""Jaws"" and Spielberg's first theatrical film the road movie ""The Sugarland Express"" featuring Goldie Hawn. Although I haven't seen the DVD extras, the suspensful direction and nicely paced editing on the laserdisc edition are exactly the same as this edition.

""Duel"" is a highly entertaining and suspenseful movie, and one thing that makes this movie so great is how minimalistic the whole thing is! Think about it; how many movies can you name where the whole film is basically one giant chase scene? Any movie that can pull such a feat off and be interesting all the way through is a surefire winner in my book, and ""Duel"", being such a movie, earns a spot amongst other classic horror/suspense movie that I've seen.With so little to work with, it makes it that much easier to add detail to everything. Details that were worked to perfect include that of the truck: If you look, it has a railroad track with a bunch of license plates on it...hhmm, a giant truck with the license plates of other cars on its front. Yep, we have a serial killer on the loose! Speaking of which, I also find it curiously interesting that they never show the face of the truck driver, which highlights that the scariest thing about evil is the unknown factor behind it.Overall, ""Duel"" is a feat that probably couldn't be pulled off by just any writer and still be as good as it is.

200712,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,6300181987,William,"[3, 3]","DUEL is Spielberg's first TV movie about an innocent man (Dennis Weaver) who is pursued by an angry truck driver.  In this age of road rage, the movie is very relevant. What starts out as a long drive to a meeting, turns into a long drive to hell.  The film focusses on Weaver's emotions well, in particular during the cafe scene where there are six or so truck drivers at the bar and one of them is the person who has been following him.  Which one?  The mind games begin.  The film never reveals the actual truck driver which is good, because the fear of the unknown remains throughout the film.DVD SUMMARY:  AS the movie was filmed for TV, the aspect ratio is 1:33.  It's unfortunate it wasn't filmed in widescreen to capture the landscapes better. The image is quite soft in parts, and crystal clear in others.  Considering the age of the film, the transfer is more than acceptable.  The DVD includes several special features such as a featurette on Spielberg's TV work titled ""Spielberg and the small screen"".  This featurette also includes discussions with Spielberg.  The other featurette focusses on the writer of Duel and how it developed from a short story to a feature length film.  There is also an audio commentary and trailer included on the disc.  To be honest, I was surprised to find a trailer considering the film was originally made for TV, not cinema.  SOund purists will enjoy the audio options available on the DVD - both DTS and 5.1.OVERALL: Duel is nailbiting stuff, and is an accomplishment to Spielberg considering he had to film it in 10 days. He actually took 13 days to do it, and got in trouble for it as revealed on the DVD. Excellent camera work, and suspense make for a good night's entertainment. The DVD is worth buying to have Spielberg's first movie.

He's done some ok work, but he has never equaled the imagination and character development that he accomplished in &quot;Duel&quot;. This is a simple film based on a simple plot, but it's totally effective. I would take 'Duel' over all of Spielberg's other works combined.
