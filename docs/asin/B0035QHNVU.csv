Make no mistake, this is a splendid movie that touches on a number of issues most people are unaware of. But with today's technology, you would think they could get the entire movie on one disc, with closed captions. That being said, the movie itself is based on actual events that did occur in Hawaii in 1937 ( PBS has an excellent documentary- The Massie Affair ) but the treatment this two-part drama received for a 1986 TV presentation goes above what you'd expect. This film is about power, racism, America's policies and attitude toward colonies ( it's inhabitants ) and perhaps hope and redemption. There's an outstanding cast that give honest believeable performances. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoy a movie that is a force that demand your attention. Kris Kristofferson, Jane Alexander and Jose Ferrer are exceptional. The only thing that would have made this a better movie...They should have simply told the truth.

1326843,A14GILA5IVI2Z3,B0035QHNVU,KATELAND,"[1, 1]","A story of Cruelty, Lies, Adultery, and Venegance. Set in Hawaii in 1937.  Amid wealthy Plantation Owners, and an American Navel Base, A SAGA UNFOLDS. Four young Hawaiian youths who happend to have been labourers, were driveing along, haveing a good night out, they stoped to buy some beer, and then were on the road again, all looking forward to the night ahead. And what a night it was. Up in front of them amongest the trees and bushes lay a naked female, they bought their vehicle to a halt, got out and walked slowly up to her. Discovering that she was a white woman who had been severly bashed and left for dead, they drove her to the hospital, bringing her in, they were questioned by the hospital staff, realiseing that they  were under suspicion themselves, quickly fled the building. They then became suspects. Hate built up amongest the locals towards these young labourers, and everyone was out to get them. They had tried to help a young woman who was very badly hurt, and now they were going to pay with their lives for their act of good will. The young woman who they had taken to the hospital also had a very wealthy scheming mother, who was very well known throughout the island, as a very classy and respectable woman. Waiting for her daughter to recover enough, to tell her who the person was that did this to her. The mother was shocked to learn from her daughter that it was a high up Navel Officer from the American Navel Base who had done it. She had been haveing an adulteress affair with him.  To protect the American Base, and her daughter, the mother told her daughter she MUST say that it was those four Hawaiian youths, who bashed and raped her. And the court hearing soon begins, with a young hawaiian lawyer takeing on the case, fighting for these 4 young men to prove their innocents. And he is cunning, very smart and very clever. The court trial will have you on edge as the suspense builds up. A great movie. And an excellent true story.",5,KATELAND,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1972,"['story', 'Cruelty', 'Lies', 'Adultery', 'Venegance', 'Set', 'Hawaii', '1937', 'Amid', 'wealthy', 'Plantation', 'Owners', 'American', 'Navel', 'Base', 'A', 'SAGA', 'UNFOLDS', 'Four', 'young', 'Hawaiian', 'youths', 'who', 'happend', 'have', 'been', 'labourers', 'were', 'driveing', 'along', 'haveing', 'good', 'night', 'out', 'stoped', 'buy', 'beer', 'then', 'were', 'road', 'again', 'looking', 'forward', 'night', 'ahead', 'what', 'night', 'was', 'Up', 'front', 'amongest', 'trees', 'bushes', 'lay', 'naked', 'female', 'bought', 'vehicle', 'halt', 'got', 'out', 'walked', 'slowly', 'up', 'Discovering', 'was', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'severly', 'bashed', 'left', 'dead', 'drove', 'hospital', 'bringing', 'were', 'questioned', 'hospital', 'staff', 'realiseing', 'were', 'suspicion', 'quickly', 'fled', 'building', 'then', 'became', 'suspects', 'Hate', 'built', 'up', 'locals', 'young', 'labourers', 'everyone', 'was', 'out', 'get', 'had', 'tried', 'help', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'badly', 'hurt', 'now', 'were', 'going', 'pay', 'lives', 'act', 'good', 'will', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'hospital', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'wealthy', 'scheming', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'island', 'very', 'classy', 'respectable', 'woman', 'Waiting', 'daughter', 'recover', 'enough', 'tell', 'who', 'person', 'was', 'did', 'mother', 'was', 'shocked', 'learn', 'daughter', 'was', 'high', 'up', 'Navel', 'Officer', 'American', 'Navel', 'Base', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'had', 'been', 'haveing', 'adulteress', 'affair', 'protect', 'American', 'Base', 'daughter', 'mother', 'told', 'daughter', 'MUST', 'say', 'was', 'four', 'Hawaiian', 'youths', 'who', 'bashed', 'raped', 'court', 'hearing', 'soon', 'young', 'hawaiian', 'lawyer', 'takeing', 'case', 'fighting', '4', 'young', 'men', 'prove', 'innocents', 'cunning', 'very', 'smart', 'very', 'clever', 'court', 'trial', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'suspense', 'up', 'great', 'movie', 'excellent', 'true', 'story']",N/A
