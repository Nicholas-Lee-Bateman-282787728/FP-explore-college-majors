His children range in age from approximately 8 to 34 years of age.  I can't help but feel horrible for them.

1539947,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007ZC31LQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","In the realm of Lifetime network's ""ripped from the headlines"" genre of movie making, let's just say that most leave a lot to be desired. The results are mostly sensationalized suppositions put together for entertainment purposes as opposed to a serious contemplation of real life events. But as long as you know that's what you're getting, some definitely fare better than others. ""Drew Peterson: Untouchable"" is one of their efforts that might actually surpass your expectations. Rob Lowe steps into Peterson's shoes and attempts valiantly to recreate his brashness and bravado. While his performance can border on the maniacal, this over-the-top caricature of evil may lack subtlety but it is eminently watchable. Despite the actual case being unresolved, the movie pulls no punches in its assertion about what happened. But again, it is a fictionalized account and not a literal retelling of the crimes (and alleged crimes) represented.The movie introduces a Drew Peterson that is outwardly charming, but riddled with jealousy and pettiness. The story picks up as Peterson's third marriage to Kathleen Savio (Cara Buono) is near its end. He meets another young woman (Kaley Cuoco plays bride number four Stacy), and starts his fatherly seduction. Stacy and Drew have a fairy tale romance, even as Savio warns her of Peterson's unpredictable volatility. Convinced that Savio is the one that is skewed, Stacy becomes a stepmother to Peterson's kids and settles in before she starts to see signs of Peterson's controlling nature. One ""accidental"" drowning and an infamous missing person case later, and Drew Peterson has become a media sensation. While much conjecture is inherent in this story (Stacy is still considered a missing person), the movie does a great job handling the aftermath of the events. The media presence and Peterson's erratic behavior (such as Win a Date with Drew) are well replicated.For what it is, this is one of Lifetime's better recreations. Lowe is fun to watch and does well with the public Peterson that we've seen. He is so apparently unhinged, though, (as represented) it seems unlikely that he'd have so much support. Buono and Cuoco are both sympathetic and draw you into somewhat underwritten roles. ""Drew Peterson: Untouchable"" is bolstered by these good performances. The filmmakers have publicly stated that the film is not meant to portray Peterson's guilt or innocence, but its beliefs are fairly transparent. Of course, the real life Peterson tried to prevent the movie. The intellectual part of me says that this genre of movie smacks of exploitation and shouldn't be used for entertainment purposes. But ultimately I was entertained by ""Drew Peterson: Untouchable."" About 3 1/2 stars.

1539951,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B007ZC31LQ,Ron,"[0, 0]","This was you average TV movie based on current actual events in a very condensed package. Like most of these murder stories that have been &#34;SENSATIONALIZED&#34; BY THE MEDIA and by the viewers thirst for depravity and its aftermath I didn't follow this story nor the one that was playing in my own backyard (Jodi Arias). I rather wait until the facts have been compiled and the focus of the story is on facts and not the hype.I like Lowe and have enjoyed many of his projects so I'm sure he was doing his best portraying Peterson's persona, but if this guy was that arrogant why in the heck did so many people hang around him let alone date and marry the guy?I know his MO was to pick young women with low self-esteem and rough up brings and it worked what I can't get how many friends he had that backed him up with the way he treated them. If I'm treated that way color me gone and that goes for work related friends code or no code especially if I thought there was foul play involved.The movie gives us tiny glimpses of worry from his partner and step brother and a whole lot (rightfully so) by friends and relatives of the dead and missing women. As others have mentioned this story starts near the end and does nothing to address the reason for this bums logic or upbringing for being so abusive towards these women.You do get an idea of his mindset, but again nothing in detail.The acting and direction are decent enough, but the writing could have been better especially involving Peterson's background. I can't say for sure but, it seemed like the director had Lowe go a bit to far with Drew's arrogance or maybe he was just that bad?Overall a decent TV movie that only focuses of the last two wives of Drew Peterson and to a lesser degree their four children. The majority of the movie is spent on displaying Peterson's arrogance, twisted mindset towards women and his enjoyment being the center of the media attention and his rants.There is some foul language, but no F&#8230;words and a few sex scenes under the covers and there is some visual/mental wife abuse, but nothing to dramatic of visual.  3 stars",3,"""MISTER PERSONALITY""",1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,2122,"['was', 'average', 'TV', 'movie', 'based', 'current', 'actual', 'events', 'very', 'condensed', 'package', 'most', 'murder', 'stories', 'have', 'been', '34', 'SENSATIONALIZED', '34', 'BY', 'THE', 'MEDIA', 'viewers', 'thirst', 'depravity', 'aftermath', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'one', 'was', 'playing', 'own', 'backyard', 'Jodi', 'Arias', 'rather', 'wait', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'compiled', 'focus', 'story', 'facts', 'not', 'hype.I', 'Lowe', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'projects', 'so', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'doing', 'best', 'portraying', 'Peterson', 'persona', 'guy', 'was', 'arrogant', 'why', 'heck', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'hang', 'let', 'alone', 'date', 'marry', 'guy', 'know', 'MO', 'was', 'pick', 'young', 'women', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'rough', 'up', 'brings', 'worked', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'many', 'friends', 'had', 'backed', 'up', 'way', 'treated', ""'m"", 'treated', 'way', 'color', 'gone', 'work', 'related', 'friends', 'code', 'code', 'especially', 'thought', 'was', 'foul', 'play', 'involved.The', 'movie', 'tiny', 'glimpses', 'worry', 'partner', 'step', 'brother', 'whole', 'lot', 'rightfully', 'so', 'friends', 'relatives', 'dead', 'missing', 'women', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'story', 'end', 'nothing', 'address', 'reason', 'bums', 'logic', 'upbringing', 'being', 'so', 'abusive', 'towards', 'women.You', 'do', 'get', 'idea', 'mindset', 'again', 'nothing', 'detail.The', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'decent', 'enough', 'writing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'especially', 'involving', 'Peterson', 'background', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'seemed', 'director', 'had', 'Lowe', 'go', 'bit', 'far', 'Drew', 'arrogance', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'decent', 'TV', 'movie', 'only', 'focuses', 'last', 'two', 'wives', 'Drew', 'Peterson', 'lesser', 'degree', 'four', 'children', 'majority', 'movie', 'spent', 'displaying', 'Peterson', 'arrogance', 'twisted', 'mindset', 'towards', 'women', 'enjoyment', 'being', 'center', 'media', 'attention', 'rants.There', 'foul', 'language', 'F', '8230', 'words', 'few', 'sex', 'scenes', 'covers', 'visual/mental', 'wife', 'abuse', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'visual', '3', 'stars']",N/A
1539952,A387BD735MI50R,B007ZC31LQ,R. Schultz,"[6, 8]","It's always difficult to make a movie about a murder case that's still being adjudicated in the courts. You can't actually show the murder being committed. On the one hand, you must be positive enough to provide the film with some definite form and to give the viewer some sense of learning the facts of the case. But on the other hand, you must avoid libeling the accused.Generally, this film negotiates that fine line satisfactorily. Drew Peterson isn't shown actually committing any murder. However it's plain that the producers are projecting him as the guilty party.The acting is fairly good in this regard. Except - Bob Lowe uses the technique of squinting too much to signal evil intent. All that squinting is distracting and not the kind of obviously malevolent face that any actual sociopath would be likely to present to the world.Also, most of the women in Drew's life are shown here as looking like virtual clones of each other. Drew's last two wives and most of their female relatives are difficult to distinguish from each other. They all have the same blonde hairdos, are about the same age, and are the same general ""types."" I felt as if I'd been catapulted into a less glamorous version of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" music video, with its famous back-up of eerily identical mannequin women. In reality, Drew Peterson's last two wives at least were quite different-looking.If you've been following the case at all, you probably won't learn a lot that you didn't already know from this movie. You might gain a little more insight into the combination of possessiveness, boredom, and disdain that characterized Drew Peterson's attitude toward the ""used"" women in his life.
