Shirley MacLaine (probably more atractive than Mary Kay) is wonderful in this film.  Her little words of wisdom directly to the audience are great!The movie centers on the battle between Mary Kay and BeutiControl.  Parker Posey and Shannen Doherty also give great performances.If you're looking for high drama, this movie probably isn't it.  But it is a lot of fun!  I love watching it.  And it's very affordable.  I felt that the picture and sound quality were excellent.  There are no bonus features.This is a must for fans of the great Shirley MacLaine.",5,Fun TV movie!,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,671,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'television', 'Hell', 'Heels', 'Battle', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'loved', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'probably', 'more', 'atractive', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'wonderful', 'film', 'little', 'words', 'wisdom', 'directly', 'audience', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'centers', 'battle', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'BeutiControl', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'also', 'give', 'great', 'performances.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'high', 'drama', 'movie', 'probably', ""n't"", 'lot', 'fun', 'love', 'watching', 'very', 'affordable', 'felt', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'were', 'excellent', 'are', 'bonus', 'features.This', 'must', 'fans', 'great', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine']",N/A
