1058785,A276M3NSIY9B82,B000NOIX7U,Harry Brewer,"[2, 2]","Rawhide was one of the best westerns that was ever on television. It's a shame that CBS/Paramount has decided to break this season up in two volumes. They didn't do it on Mission: Impossible. But there's just no telling about Paramount. I don't think they are particularly geared toward customer satisfaction.This set of Rawhide has sixteen episodes & they're in excellent condition. Though Clint Eastwood (Rowdy Yates) receives second billing, Sheb Wooley (Pete Nolan) is just as visible. Paul Brinegar (Wishbone) appears to have more screen time but James Murdock (Mushy) is still tagging along but not with much to do. We occasionally see Rocky Shahan (Joe Scarlet) but he doesn't say much. Robert Cabal (Jesus or as the credits put it, Hey-Soos) makes a single appearance.The set opens with "" Incident of the Day of the Dead"" which has Rowdy as the primary character. It's a peculiar episode of Rawhide that has Rowdy at a ranch to attempt to break a wild stallion that no one else has been able to. It's eerie music will give you a sci-fi flashback. ""Incident of the Roman Candles"" was a bonus episode of the first season. The episode features Pete Nolan as the main character. ""Incident of the Shambling Man"" has Victor McLaglen & Anne Francis as guest stars. Mclaglen is a former boxer that has delusions of being in the ring again. Most consider him harmless but his daughter-in-law (Francis) sets him up as dangerous & lies about him attacking her. ""Incident of the Thirteenth Man"" has Wishbone with a toothache. Wishbone & Rowdy go to the nearest town & get forced into jury duty. ""Incident of the Stalking Death"" has Cesar Romero as a guest star. In this episode Favor has wounded a cougar but it has escaped. A visit from a senora leads Favor into taking more interest in finishing off the cougar. Romero sees Favor as competition for the senora so he plans to kill him. ""Incident of the Blue Fire"" is an episode I actually remember. The St. Elmo's fire bit on the cattle has always stuck with me. Skip Homeier (Lucky) is the guest star. This is the only episode Jesus appears in; it's also the only episode Charles Marquis Warren directs in this set. This episode has a mild Twilight Zone-like twist. In ""Incident at Spanish Rock"" the drovers encounter a band of Mexican revolutionaries. ""Incident of the Druid's Curse: is another strange episode of Rawhide. ""Incident at Red River Station"" involves a smallpox incident. The twist in this episode is the doctor expressing that everyone should be vaccinated. Nowadays we know about this but it was a novel idea in that period.Overall this is a very good set of Rawhide episodes. But it's odd, after all these years, to see a young Clint Eastwood who's character isn't the star & learning about the cattle business. There are absolutely no bonus materials included in this set, not even subtitles. CBS/Paramount has really skimped on this set though they didn't really have much bonus material in the season one set.""Head 'em up! Move 'em out!""

ONE"" (18 September 1959 - 29 January 1960) (720 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- Rawhide was a television western series that aired on the U.S. network CBS from 1959 to 1966. The show starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood --- The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white --- It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke --- Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide --- Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows --- Rawhide was the fourth longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others --- The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting --- Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth --- A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up - In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.Of all the western characters on TV, these were the only real cowboys, because they drove cows. There were also sheep boys who drove sheep, pig boys who looked after pigs, etc. The name cowboys became a generic name in western films and TV series --- The theme song's lyrics were written by Ned Washington in 1958. It was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by pop singer Frankie Laine. The theme song became very popular --- It was covered several times and parts of the song also appear in more recent movies like The Blues Brothers and Shrek.-- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)List of Season, Episode, Title and Original Air Date:Season 2, Episode 1: Incident of the Day of the Dead  (guest star Viveca Lindfors)Original Air Date--18 September 1959Season 2, Episode 2: Incident of the Roman Candles  (guest star Beverly Garland)Original Air Date--25 September 1959Season 2, Episode 3: Incident at Dangerfield Dip  (guest star Douglas Kennedy)Original Air Date--2 October 1959Season 2, Episode 4: Incident of the Shambling Man  (guest stars Anne Francis, Victor McLaglen, Gene Nelson, Robert Lowery, Harry Carey Jr. & Earle Hodgins)Original Air Date--9 October 1959Season 2, Episode 5: Incident at Jacob's Well  (guest stars David Brian & Patricia Medina)Original Air Date--16 October 1959Season 2, Episode 6: Incident of the 13th Man  (guest stars Edward Platt & Paul Fix)Original Air Date--23 October 1959Season 2, Episode 7: Incident at the Buffalo Smokehouse  (guest stars Vera Miles, Gene Evans, Leif Erickson & John Agar)Original Air Date--30 October 1959Season 2, Episode 8: Incident of the Haunted Hills  (guest stars John Drew Barrymore,Kent Smith & Strother Martin)Original Air Date--6 November 1959Season 2, Episode 9: Incident of the Stalking Death  (guest stars Cesar Romero, Mari Blanchard & Martin Garralaga)Original Air Date--13 November 1959Season 2, Episode 10: Incident of the Valley in Shadow  (guest stars Leo Gordon, Rick Jason & Fay Spain)Original Air Date--20 November 1959Season 2, Episode 11: Incident of the Blue Fire  (guest star Skip Homeier)Original Air Date--11 December 1959Season 2, Episode 12: Incident at Spanish Rock  (guest star Jacques Aubuchon)Original Air Date--18 December 1959Season 2, Episode 13: Incident of the Druid Curse  (guest stars Claude Akins, Luana Patten & Don Keefer)Original Air Date--8 January 1960Season 2, Episode 14: Incident at Red River Station  (guest star James Dunn)Original Air Date--15 January 1960Season 2, Episode 15: Incident of the Devil and His Due  (guest star Neville Brand)Original Air Date--22 January 1960Season 2, Episode 16: Incident of the Wanted Painter  (guest stars Arthur Franz,Steve Brodie & Robert Lowery)Original Air Date--29 January 1960BIOS:1.

The stories are much more intriguing and surprising than any other Western series available on dvd. Sure, I like Gunsmoke, I like Daniel Boone... but these have stories that are much more simple, or ""Little House""-ish; that is, 1/3 the way through, you know what's going to happen. Personally I get bored with this type of story.With Rawhide, you never quite know where they're going with a story, and that makes for good tv viewing!Also, there's the acting: Clint Eastwood in one of his early roles, is great. But also Eric Fleming as Mr. Favor is great, and Sheb Wooley as Pete, and then there is one of my personal favorites, Paul Brinegar as Wishbone, who always brings a laugh or two to the series with his ""old goat"" personality and his almost-inedible food.But to my mind, the acting - while indeed very good - is secondary to the writing, which is exceptional, making each story different and compelling.I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out!

1058800,AEX2Z4984LXYO,B000NOIX7U,pen name,"[30, 34]","Thoughts from various sources-This is the landscape of Rawhide - desert, forest, mountain and plains. It is intense heat, bitter cold, torrential rain, blinding dust; men risking their lives, earning small reward - a life of challenge - Rawhide.  It is men like trail scout Pete Nolan, the cantankerous Wishbone, Ramrod Rowdy Yates, good natured Mushy, and trail boss Gil Favor - these men are Rawhide!-The time was the 1860s - Gil Favor and Rowdy Yates moved cattle across the country, with episodes depicting the struggles and hardships they faced on their cattle drive from San Antonio, Texas, to Sedalia, Kansas.-The proliferation of TV channels, video and other home entertainment formats has ensured that the best of the past will continue to find an audience. The appeal of nostalgia in those who recall its first airing has never been better served. ""Rawhide"" was about the west, the cowboy and his backbreaking work on the trail. Filmed outdoors, it told absorbing stories, and included unforgettable Gil Favor, Rowdy Yates and Wishbone the cook. It launched the career of Clint Eastwood. It offered a glimpse of the best qualities of its other leading actor Eric Fleming and now begs the question of what he might have achieved had he lived. When the prevailing opinion of current television is so negative and dismissive, ""Rawhide"" is an example of what the medium could once achieve. The critical acclaim it received during its mid-nineties run on the UK's Channel 4 seems like proof of that.-These were stories about the Old West you may have read about as a kid.  Rawhide requires a high degree of attention to plot and character. You don't see presentations of morality issues like these any more.  Rawhide reminds us of just what a great storytelling medium television can be.-The 'heart' of the show - the pivotal character - was Gil Favor (Eric Fleming). Whether the character was in a given show for two seconds or the entire episode, Eric Fleming was counted on to ground the show and give it the successful flavor it Gil Favor was the essence and backbone of Rawhide.-I dearly love Eric Fleming and I never hear Clint Eastwood talk about Eric Fleming or say anything nice about him-Eric had a sad childhood and he was a sculptor and a painter. It's true Rawhide was never the same when he got fired If they hadn't fired him (final season) he might still be alive. Even though Eric Fleming is dead I wish in some way they could create a tribute to him. He was a very gifted actor.-Originally titled ""Cattle Drive"" but later changed to ""Rawhide"".  Rawhide was a concentration on the harsh aspect of frontier life.  This would be a series to depict the ""working west"" and the men and women who inhabited it.  Gil was the trail boss, the supervisor of the entire cattle-drive operation. Rowdy was his right-hand man Other regulars were the cooks, drovers, and scouts who helped the cattle drive stay together.-The show was sometimes brutal. Its situations could be apocalyptic - parched plains, anthrax, gypsy curses, ghostly riders, wolves.-The early death of Eric Fleming is the only reason he didn't grow to be a star that would dwarf Clint Eastwood today.-Charles Marquis Warren would have preferred ninety minutes per episode if allowed.It's been an unforgivable crime that this series has been withheld from us for all these years. Occasionally referred to as the `lost classic', hopes are high that this classic no longer be a lost one. Thank you Paramount!  Please continue with the series!Hearing Eric's voice is something special. Eric can do it all and probably better than anyone has or ever will.  I don't think anyone will ever be able to convey what Eric was able to achieve in this series.Rowdy is excellent, endearing and simply oozes masculinity!  We need to go back to the 1950s and 1960s when it was okay to show men acting like real men!Hard feelings develop as they do in real life and the confrontations in this series are riveting. The focus of the series is human feeling, often powerful feelings -not special effects, like too many shows nowadays. It seems as though special effects, too often, are the stars today.The DVDs are uncut and digitally remastered and after comparing them to my old copies from television the difference is night and day. We sure are lucky to have this great series available with such a razor sharp picture! The close ups have such clarity it's amazing.  This kind of clarity was never available to us in the past, but it's possible now.  I can't wait to view it on the new big screen TVs they're making nowadays.  The continuation of the classic Rawhide is a landmark event for fans of the western!",5,The gold standard in western excellence,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,4671,"['Thoughts', 'various',

These stories take me back to when television was a pleasure to watch and quality stories were shown. Louie Lamour would be proud of these writers who wrote these stories. What is so amazing about Rawhide is that it draws you in to feeling that you are really there with the drovers and are caught up in the stories.

Some old TV series can be a disappointment when you view them many years later - they somehow don't look so good as your memory suggested! But ""Rawhide"" is an exception. Channel 4 (a major British TV channel) to their credit, re-ran many of the episodes a while back - and watching it impressed me enough to buy the DVDs.""Rawhide"" stands apart from so many 1960s Westerns, in which the heroes look so impeccably turned out, with never a speck of dust and dirt on them. Instead ""Rawhide"" portrays grubby, smelly, tatty drovers, who bleed when they get thumped or shot, and bicker amongst themselves; the series features historically-credible and authentic detail with consistently credible storylines. For instance, our heroes aren't referred to as ""cowboys"", but ""drovers"" - a minor point but hey, that's authenticity for you. The black-and-white photography seems to enhance the atmosphere and the acting's pretty top-notch from the ensemble cast too.Incidentally. I've seen some of the episodes from Seasons 4,5 and 6 on home-recorded VHS recently and it seems to me the very high standards of production, writing and acting were kept up throughout the series' run (I think the very last season was never broadcast in the UK so I can't comment on that one).
