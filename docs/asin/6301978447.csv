287825,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301978447,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Paul Newman is possibly my favorite actor of all time.  The range he had and the string of tremendous performances and films to boot (it is very hard to find an actor who knows how to select quality material, not merely put in a quality performance) make him a worthy choice and a memorable presence.  Regardless of his legendary career, the fact of the matter is that Newman wasn't initially welcomed into the world of cinema with open arms.  His debut film, `The Silver Chalice', was not met with enthusiasm and actually forced Newman to retreat back to Broadway.  But then tragedy struck a young budding star, James Dean, and opened a door for Newman to walk through.  That door was a biopic on the boxer Rocky Graziano.This is a pretty big story to tell, and Robert Wise does his best to do so, but clocking in at under two-hours, there is just too much to tell and not enough time to tell it.  Much of Rocky's early life gets skimmed over in favor of his boxing career, which is the core of the story.  Still, it could have used a little meat on the bones so-to-speak to make his early life of crime or his stint in the army (not to mention prison) feel more lived in and whole.  The latter half though, pertaining to his relationship with Norma and his boxing career is really well done and offers some insight into the ups and downs of his career thanks to his AWOL status and his affiliation with some thugs.The performances are uniformly good here, with a few standouts.  Paul Newman is green here, but he shows a lot of the promise that he soon would capitalize on.  I actually saw a lot of Marlon Brando here, from his accent work down to his mannerisms, and it actually shows how great of an actor Newman was because anyone familiar with his film career knows that he was nothing like Brando.  For me, Pier Angeli and Everett Sloane were the true standouts.  Angeli had such a soft and natural way about her, and she made the most out of a stock character (suffering spouse).  Everett Sloane was sensationally underplayed as Rocky's manager, and I loved the way he balanced out the paternal with the business.Overall, the film is very good.  It needed some length, but overall it manages to be really entertaining and the tight editing (those fight scenes are great) add wonderful layers of intensity.  The cinematography is outstanding (Oscar bit) and the overall technical aspects are strong.",4,The better `Rocky'...,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,2406,"['Paul', 'Newman', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'actor', 'time', 'range', 'had', 'string', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'films', 'boot', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'actor', 'who', 'how', 'select', 'quality', 'material', 'not', 'merely', 'put', 'quality', 'performance', 'make', 'worthy', 'choice', 'memorable', 'presence', 'Regardless', 'legendary', 'career', 'fact', 'matter', 'Newman', 'was', ""n't"", 'initially', 'welcomed', 'world', 'cinema', 'open', 'arms', 'debut', 'film', 'Silver', 'Chalice', 'was', 'not', 'met', 'enthusiasm', 'actually', 'forced', 'Newman', 'retreat', 'back', 'Broadway', 'then', 'tragedy', 'struck', 'young', 'budding', 'star', 'James', 'Dean', 'opened', 'door', 'Newman', 'walk', 'door', 'was', 'biopic', 'boxer', 'Rocky', 'Graziano.This', 'pretty', 'big', 'story', 'tell', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'best', 'do', 'so', 'clocking', 'two-hours', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'tell', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'tell', 'Much', 'Rocky', 'early', 'life', 'skimmed', 'favor', 'boxing', 'career', 'core', 'story', 'Still', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'meat', 'bones', 'so-to-speak', 'make', 'early', 'life', 'crime', 'stint', 'army', 'not', 'mention', 'prison', 'feel', 'more', 'lived', 'whole', 'latter', 'half', 'pertaining', 'relationship', 'Norma', 'boxing', 'career', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'insight', 'ups', 'downs', 'career', 'thanks', 'AWOL', 'status', 'affiliation', 'thugs.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'good', 'here', 'few', 'standouts', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'green', 'here', 'lot', 'promise', 'soon', 'would', 'capitalize', 'actually', 'saw', 'lot', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'here', 'accent', 'work', 'down', 'mannerisms', 'actually', 'how', 'great', 'actor', 'Newman', 'was', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'film', 'career', 'was', 'nothing', 'Brando', 'Pier', 'Angeli', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'were', 'true', 'standouts', 'Angeli', 'had', 'soft', 'natural', 'way', 'made', 'most', 'stock', 'character', 'suffering', 'spouse', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'was', 'sensationally', 'underplayed', 'Rocky', 'manager', 'loved', 'way', 'balanced', 'out', 'paternal', 'business.Overall', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'needed', 'length', 'overall', 'be', 'really', 'entertaining', 'tight', 'editing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'add', 'wonderful', 'layers', 'intensity', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'Oscar', 'bit', 'overall', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'strong']",N/A

287827,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6301978447,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" is one of the most underrated and under-discussed movies of the 1950s. It was interesting from start-to-finish and had drama, humor, suspense, action, romance.....and it's all true. The story was approved by the man it was about: boxer Rocky Graziano. Thus, you know it's not ""based on a true story"" in which 90 percent of it turns out to be fiction, just for dramatic purposes. No, this was Graziano's story and Paul Newman - despite not looking Italian - did a superb job playing him. This movie put Newman ""on the map"" as an actor. He was fascinating in here and dominated most of the scenes.The film's direction by Robert Wise and the cinematography also took center stage.  The movie won an Oscar for its photography.Newman is complemented by the great character actors Harold Stone and Eileen Heckart . Also, Pier Angeli is well-cast as Graziano's sweetheart-turned wife. Her Italian accent fits in perfectly as does her character as the soft and frail-but tough female complement to ""Graziano."" Too bad we didn't see much of this actress in the USA.The rest of the supporting cast is top-notch, from Everett Sloane as the fight manager to '50s star/teen idol Sal Mineo as a neighborhood pal to Graziano. Also good was Robert Loggia as the bad- influence hood. This was Loggia's first role on screen. Speaking of first roles, did anyone catch Steve McQueen in here?? I did a double-take when they had a quick gang-fight rumble on top of a roof and there's McQueen! The camera put a closeup shot on him and there was no doubt it was him!

He got in jail more than he should have. He was drafted into the army on the most voluntary obligation possible. He got discharged dishonorably and was sent to one more prison term and there he was noticed as a fighter and was trained into boxing by some military chap who was seeing millions behind him.

As Romolo and Norma, Mineo and Angeli are uncharacteristically subdued, and in the judgment of MGM executives uncooperative.  In a draconian moves, studio brass cancelled both their contracts shortly afterwards, and the careers of both actors were to plummet.  Poor Pier Angeli left this world without regret, the victim of Hollywood excess and a suicide bid that told her fans there was no life left in her after James Dean.  And of course the world knows what happened to Sal.  The James Dean ""curse"" continued even into this film, in which he did not participate beyond some early script discussions with Ernest Lehman and director Robert Wise.As a sidenote, several obituaries noted last year that SOMEMODY UP THERE LIKES ME was the late R&B; master Luther Vandross' favorite movie and as a boy he caught it several times at revival houses, putchasing a VHS tape as soon as it was available.

287838,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6301978447,Martin Asiner,"[24, 27]","The boxing film genre is, by its very nature, always viewed through a prism of cliches.  From the very first fight films of the thirties, usually with Cagney as the fighter and Bogie as the crooked fixer, Hollywood has delivered a nonstop series of boxers on film who, for the most part, have resonated with the viewing public.  The better ones linger in the memory, and with SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME, director Robert Wise presents the true to life story of middleweight champion Rocky Graziano, played in the performance of a lifetime by Paul Newman.  Newman has been so good so often in future films using his face and voice, that it is refreshing to remember that as Rocky Graziano, he could combine that busted face and Brooklyn accent with a physical ferocity in the ring that compares favorably with the best of Stallone's Rocky.  Newman plays Graziano as the thug that he surely was.  First as a street hood, then later as an army malcontent, Graziano seems on the fast track to prison and an early death.  Paradoxically, it is the very bitterness of his soul that convinces his manager Everett Sloane to take a chance on this tough kid as a professional fighter.  Along the way, the cliches start to pile up:  Sloane's 'Meshuganah' Yiddish accent; the complaints of his future wife (Pier Angeli) that she can't stand the fight business; and the many altercations that Graziano has with the rule-bound boxing commission, which is determined to make Rocky adhere to a set of rules that from the first reel, he would fight with the same ferocity that he would later show in the ring.  But by the time these cliches add, the audience no longer cares that they are cliches.  Now they care very much about the motivation within Rocky's soul.  When Rocky forgets to attend a scheduled fight only because of the trauma of a breakup with Pier Angeli, the audience can feel the pain of his broken heart which does not leave room for such petty details as punching some opponent's lights out.  And there are the fight scenes.  The climactic battle with champion Tony Zale, the 'Iron Man,' is one of the best choreographed fights ever filmed.  Court Shepard, who plays Zale, is an intimidating presence, who says not a word during this long bout, yet his etched in concrete face tells Rocky all he needs to know that Zale is no joke.  The blow by blow narration done over the radio by real life announcer Henry Wismer adds a grueling note of authenticity to a fight that leaves the audience gasping at the pounding Graziano and Zale give each other. Throughout the film, Newman gives just the right note of a street born Brooklyn tough guy who slowly comes to realize that the toughest bout of his life need not take place in the ring itself.  Connecting to his wife and father gave Rocky more internal bruises than the Iron Man ever could.",5,The Original Rocky: Cliched but Supremely Well Done,1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,2838,"['boxing', 'film', 'genre', 'very', 'nature', 'always', 'viewed', 'prism', 'cliches', 'very', 'first', 'fight', 'films', 'thirties', 'usually', 'Cagney', 'fighter', 'Bogie', 'crooked', 'fixer', 'Hollywood', 'delivered', 'nonstop', 'series', 'boxers', 'film', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'resonated', 'viewing', 'public', 'better', 'ones', 'linger', 'memory', 'SOMEBODY', 'UP', 'THERE', 'LIKES', 'ME', 'director', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'middleweight', 'champion', 'Rocky', 'Graziano', 'played', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Newman', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'often', 'future', 'films', 'using', 'face', 'voice', 'refreshing', 'remember', 'Rocky', 'Graziano', 'could', 'combine', 'busted', 'face', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'physical', 'ferocity', 'ring', 'favorably', 'best', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'Newman', 'Graziano', 'thug', 'surely', 'was', 'First', 'street', 'hood', 'then', 'later', 'army', 'malcontent', 'Graziano', 'fast', 'track', 'prison', 'early', 'death', 'Paradoxically', 'very', 'bitterness', 'soul', 'manager', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'take', 'chance', 'tough', 'kid', 'professional', 'fighter', 'way', 'cliches', 'start', 'pile', 'up', 'Sloane', ""'Meshuganah"", 'Yiddish', 'accent', 'complaints', 'future', 'wife', 'Pier', 'Angeli', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'fight', 'business', 'many', 'altercations', 'Graziano', 'rule-bound', 'boxing', 'commission', 'determined', 'make', 'Rocky', 'adhere', 'set', 'rules', 'first', 'reel', 'would', 'fight', 'same', 'ferocity', 'would', 'later', 'show', 'ring', 'time', 'cliches', 'add', 'audience', 'no', 'longer', 'are', 'cliches', 'Now', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'motivation', 'Rocky', 'soul', 'When', 'Rocky', 'forgets', 'attend', 'scheduled', 'fight', 'only', 'trauma', 'breakup', 'Pier', 'Angeli', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'broken', 'heart', 'not', 'leave', 'room', 'such', 'petty', 'details', 'punching', 'opponent', 'lights', 'out', 'are', 'fight', 'scenes', 'climactic', 'battle', 'champion', 'Tony', 'Zale', ""'Iron"", 'Man', 'one', 'best', 'choreographed', 'fights', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Court', 'Shepard', 'who', 'Zale', 'intimidating', 'presence', 'who', 'not', 'word', 'long', 'bout', 'yet', 'etched', 'concrete', 'face', 'tells', 'Rocky', 'all', 'know', 'Zale', 'joke', 'blow', 'blow', 'narration', 'done', 'radio', 'real', 'life', 'announcer', 'Henry', 'Wismer', 'grueling', 'note', 'authenticity', 'fight', 'audience', 'gasping', 'pounding', 'Graziano', 'Zale', 'give', 'other', 'film', 'Newman', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'street', 'born', 'Brooklyn', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'slowly', 'realize', 'toughest', 'bout', 'life', 'need', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'ring', 'Connecting', 'wife', 'father', 'gave', 'Rocky', 'more', 'internal', 'bruises', 'Iron', 'Man', 'ever', 'could']",N/A

His father (Harold Stone), a disappointed, third-rate ex-boxer, takes out his frustrations by drinking and by beating up Rocky; his mother (Eileen Heckart), is an unhappy, nervous wreck...As a result, Rocky becomes a brutal delinquent, spending most of his youth in reformatories and prisons... Defiant, impulsive, striking out with his fists at anyone, he is seemingly incorrigible... Even the Army can't tame him--he punches an officer, goes AWOL and is sentenced to hard labor--but in prison he learns that he can turn his hatred into a living: instead of fighting the world he can punch one man at a time in the ring... He becomes a successful fighter, marries a devoted woman, Norma (Pier Angeli), and eventually makes it in the world, becoming middleweight champion...The story is in the tradition of a number of fifties movies about delinquency and rebellion... Newman's portrayal of Rocky as an inarticulate teenager is similar to Brando's motorcyclist in ""The Wild One,"" who also rebels against anything convenient and practical... But unlike the Brando character, Rocky develops from a causeless rebel into someone with a clear goal--to become a respected member of society--and this strong ambition allies him with many of Newman's subsequent characters...In ""The Rack,"" Newman says he's ""half my father's disappointment--half' my mother's hope,"" and the situation here is the same... Alienated from his vicious father, he runs out ""to be something,"" and strikes back at the world... Their final confrontation, in which each recognizes his responsibility toward, and need for, the other, is a powerful moment; and the two reaching awkwardly for each other recalls the car scene in ""The Rack.""Newman effectively portrays Rocky's sincere but clumsy attempts at tenderness with Norma; in subsequent films he would play many men who have difficulty being tender... Rocky is made even more sympathetic by his genuine concern for a fellow hoodlum (Sal Mineo), whose idolatry of Rocky as a father-figure evokes the similar relationship between Mineo and James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause.""",3,The story is in the tradition of a number of fifties movies about delinquency and rebellion...,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,2240,"['film', 'Graziano', 'impoverished', 'childhood', 'New', 'York', 'East', 'Side', 'slums', 'where', 'up', 'streets', 'hoodlums', 'gangs', 'father', 'Harold', 'Stone', 'disappointed', 'third-rate', 'ex-boxer', 'out', 'frustrations', 'drinking', 'beating', 'up', 'Rocky', 'mother', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'unhappy', 'nervous', 'wreck', 'result', 'Rocky', 'brutal', 'delinquent', 'spending', 'most', 'youth', 'reformatories', 'prisons', 'Defiant', 'impulsive', 'striking', 'out', 'fists', 'anyone', 'seemingly', 'incorrigible', 'Even', 'Army', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tame', 'officer', 'AWOL', 'sentenced', 'hard', 'labor', 'prison', 'can', 'turn', 'hatred', 'living', 'instead', 'fighting', 'world', 'can', 'punch', 'one', 'man', 'time', 'ring', 'successful', 'fighter', 'devoted', 'woman', 'Norma', 'Pier', 'Angeli', 'eventually', 'world', 'becoming', 'middleweight', 'champion', 'story', 'tradition', 'number', 'fifties', 'movies', 'delinquency', 'rebellion', 'Newman', 'portrayal', 'Rocky', 'inarticulate', 'teenager', 'similar', 'Brando', 'motorcyclist', 'Wild', 'One', 'who', 'also', 'anything', 'convenient', 'practical', 'Brando', 'character', 'Rocky', 'causeless', 'rebel', 'someone', 'clear', 'goal', 'become', 'respected', 'member', 'society', 'strong', 'ambition', 'allies', 'many', 'Newman', 'subsequent', 'characters', 'Rack', 'Newman', 'half', 'father', 'disappointment', 'half', 'mother', 'hope', 'situation', 'here', 'same', 'Alienated', 'vicious', 'father', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'strikes', 'back', 'world', 'final', 'confrontation', 'responsibility', 'need', 'other', 'powerful', 'moment', 'two', 'reaching', 'awkwardly', 'other', 'car', 'scene', 'Rack', 'Newman', 'effectively', 'Rocky', 'sincere', 'clumsy', 'attempts', 'tenderness', 'Norma', 'subsequent', 'films', 'would', 'play', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'difficulty', 'being', 'tender', 'Rocky', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'genuine', 'concern', 'fellow', 'hoodlum', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'idolatry', 'Rocky', 'father-figure', 'similar', 'relationship', 'Mineo', 'James', 'Dean', 'Rebel', 'Cause']",N/A
