The problem is the story that surrounded those words was not as good and I thought it did drag out a bit. It probably is a story better for women then blokes.I thought the acting was ordinary.

1065099,AHMNYLIQ98QWY,B000OPPR4A,"Faisi Island (#2) ""Faisi""","[15, 16]","This is a movie about Islamic terrorists, not Islam or Christianity.  The main character, Alceo, is a victim of terrorism, a journalist turned scholar who has become obsessed with learning about why his legs were taken away and so many innocents are murdered in the name of Allah.When we meet him, he is a modern-day Cassandra who recites reason after reason why we find ourselves in a cultural, religious war (like it or not) yet who is dismissed as paranoid and unreasonable.I failed to find anything in his character's lines that were historically or factually inaccurate.  Yet he is ignored and dismissed by everyone, of course, including his wife, his colleagues, and the police.Keitel and Abraham give performances commensurate with their experience; Jane March does a good job too. The others...well, I must say there is some poor acting in this film.The dialogue is bad, the editing is bad, continuity is awful, and the screenplay has more than a few weak spots; this is clearly a B movie, maybe even a C movie struggling desperately to rise to a B.Nevertheless, the storyline is plausible and appropriately frightening.I read a review from Variety when this movie was released that called the storyline ""highly improbable.""  I'm sure they would have said the same thing about the events of September 11, 2001.  Anyone who's ever taken the Dover-Calais ferry or who's lived in Europe will take the premise of this movie seriously.In spite of these many failings, the film makes a heraldic point, a statement about exactly what the West faces in militant Islam, based on history.  This is the only film I can recall having seen that doesn't try to lay blame for today's Islamic jihad on the West's doorstep.  None of the usual vacuous, politically correct blather here.  He may not know how to write a good movie but the screenwriter certainly knows his Wahabi Salafists.Because it takes such a risk, swimming against the fashion, the story (taken alone) seems brave and courageous, truthful while respectful, yet duly alarmist to a degree.  Duly alarmist because the story is so eerily plausible.  Again, anyone who lives in Europe and travels extensively throughout the continent like me knows it is.Thus, I found the plot rather gripping overall, in spite of the love subplot, which I did not find plausible at all, as it asks us to accept a committed jihadist on the eve of martyrdom falling truly in love with a card-carrying infidel.I've seen much worse movies.  As an interesting contrast, compare Kingdom of Heaven, a very good film as far as entertainment and production quality go...but complete fiction and propaganda from a historical perspective.",3,"Plausible story, great set design, cinematography...otherwise not very good at all.",1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,2666,"['movie', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'not', 'Islam', 'Christianity', 'main', 'character', 'Alceo', 'victim', 'terrorism', 'journalist', 'turned', 'scholar', 'who', 'become', 'obsessed', 'learning', 'why', 'legs', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'so', 'many', 'innocents', 'are', 'murdered', 'name', 'Allah.When', 'meet', 'modern-day', 'Cassandra', 'who', 'reason', 'reason', 'why', 'find', 'cultural', 'religious', 'war', 'not', 'yet', 'who', 'dismissed', 'paranoid', 'unreasonable.I', 'failed', 'find', 'anything', 'character', 'lines', 'were', 'historically', 'factually', 'inaccurate', 'ignored', 'dismissed', 'everyone', 'course', 'including', 'wife', 'colleagues', 'police.Keitel', 'Abraham', 'give', 'performances', 'commensurate', 'experience', 'Jane', 'March', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'others', 'well', 'must', 'say', 'poor', 'acting', 'film.The', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'editing', 'bad', 'continuity', 'awful', 'screenplay', 'more', 'few', 'weak', 'spots', 'clearly', 'B', 'movie', 'maybe', 'even', 'C', 'movie', 'struggling', 'desperately', 'rise', 'B.Nevertheless', 'storyline', 'plausible', 'appropriately', 'frightening.I', 'read', 'review', 'Variety', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'called', 'storyline', 'highly', 'improbable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'events', 'September', '11', '2001', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'taken', 'Dover-Calais', 'ferry', 'who', 'lived', 'Europe', 'will', 'take', 'premise', 'movie', 'spite', 'many', 'failings', 'film', 'heraldic', 'point', 'statement', 'exactly', 'what', 'West', 'militant', 'Islam', 'based', 'history', 'only', 'film', 'can', 'recall', 'having', 'seen', ""n't"", 'try', 'lay', 'blame', 'today', 'Islamic', 'jihad', 'West', 'doorstep', 'None', 'usual', 'vacuous', 'politically', 'correct', 'blather', 'here', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'write', 'good', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'certainly', 'Wahabi', 'Salafists.Because', 'risk', 'swimming', 'fashion', 'story', 'taken', 'alone', 'brave', 'courageous', 'truthful', 'respectful', 'yet', 'duly', 'alarmist', 'degree', 'Duly', 'alarmist', 'story', 'so', 'eerily', 'plausible', 'Again', 'anyone', 'who', 'Europe', 'travels', 'extensively', 'continent', 'is.Thus', 'found', 'plot', 'rather', 'gripping', 'overall', 'spite', 'love', 'subplot', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'plausible', 'accept', 'committed', 'jihadist', 'eve', 'martyrdom', 'falling', 'truly', 'love', 'card-carrying', 'infidel.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'movies', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'compare', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'entertainment', 'production', 'quality', 'go', 'complete', 'fiction', 'propaganda', 'historical', 'perspective']",The Stone Merchant

It has certainly drawn out my anxious hostitlity towards the evergrowing radical Islamic population.It seems that the only thing that will appease the extremists would be for any person of a different faith to study the Koran and then allow the violent Islamics to distort the writings just read.  Then actually convert to Islam and then, turn into suicide bomber, thus killing those of different faiths and, according to these extremists, get their tickets to Heaven.It's like watching the emergence of a huge Cult whipping up a lakeful of Koolaide.I am old, but I wonder how the younger generations will manage to live on, with the increasing threats and inevitable destruction of other religions.Was ""The Stone Merchant"" an entertainment or a warning?",3,Genre for This Film Should be: HORROR!!!,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,831,"['Regardless', 'what', 'anybody', 'film', 'was', 'dramatized', 'propaganda', 'certainly', 'drawn', 'out', 'anxious', 'hostitlity', 'evergrowing', 'radical', 'Islamic', 'population.It', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'appease', 'extremists', 'would', 'be', 'person', 'different', 'faith', 'study', 'Koran', 'then', 'allow', 'violent', 'Islamics', 'distort', 'writings', 'just', 'read', 'Then', 'actually', 'convert', 'Islam', 'then', 'turn', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'thus', 'killing', 'different', 'faiths', 'according', 'extremists', 'get', 'tickets', 'Heaven.It', 'watching', 'emergence', 'huge', 'Cult', 'whipping', 'up', 'lakeful', 'Koolaide.I', 'am', 'old', 'wonder', 'how', 'younger', 'generations', 'will', 'manage', 'live', 'increasing', 'threats', 'inevitable', 'destruction', 'other', 'religions.Was', 'Stone', 'Merchant', 'entertainment', 'warning']",The Stone Merchant
1065102,A2733E5FQFAUKR,B000OPPR4A,Rick  Henry,"[5, 5]","This is one of those rare gems of a film that somehow fell through the cracks of Hollywood mainstream... but should be seen by more people, indeed.I felt the story-line was a bit implausible, mostly in the ""coincidental"" meeting of the main characters, all at the same time, at a rather off-the-beaten path locale -- and for two of those main characters to quite become so ""involved"" with each other, (I mean with the age differences, and ""attractability"" factors, not making it a believably-positive connection for the most part).  Sweeping all that aside, we are given a real treat in viewing a part of Turkey no one hardly ever sees; we are given some stunningly good camera work, at the beginning, and throughout the film in general; the acting is above board, and the ""professor"" is an extremely well-done part, with a character barely ever encountered in film -- and realistically so!Granted, there may be a few flaws that are a bit incongruous.  Such as: why do they really need ""the dove,"" anyway?  (I surmise that part was tied in only as a double way to get to the professor; AND the weakness of the merchant himself, at the last tally, is a little lacking... yet somewhat understood.)  But the message in this film is NOT to be dismissed as fanciful, or merely imaginative, or just for the sake of drama.  While I mournfully realize this could incite and underscore prejudice towards Muslims in general, one must discern that Islamic radicals, while indeed Muslim, are in a rather special category all their own -- and not to be ignored for their intended lethal-ity.All in all, I found this one of the better films I've seen in the last couple of years -- since Hollywood has NOT been on the ""keen edge"" lately of putting out too much of worthwhile/enjoyable note.  For anyone who may have missed this in the first go-around, it should be rented for a more than intriguing, satisfying, and thought-provoking evening at home.This was a really pleasant surprise.

1065103,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B000OPPR4A,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 1]","THE STONE MERCHANT(2006) Directed by Renzo Martineli.Starring Harvey Keitel, Jane March Jordi Molla and F. Murray Abraham.An Italian University Professor, confined to a wheelchair for life, due to one of the African Embassy bombings in the late 90s and who constantly warns against the dangers posed by Islam against the West and his wife, who was recently involved in another Muslim Assault at an airport, decide to take a holiday to get away from it all.While in Turkey, they meet a fellow countryman who specializes in selling gems and who takes a special interest in the Professor's wife. Following them back to Italy, the stone merchant, secretly a Muslim, seduces the wife and the Professor discovers that they have been chosen by an Al Queada cell to be pawns in a devastating attack on Europe.One of those rare films that actually attempt to address the causes of the current war and the nature of the enemy baring some similarities to those old films where a woman discovers that she has married a Nazi or a Communist only here keeping with the times and its European locale it is more I HAD AN ADULTEROUS AFFAIR WITH A MUSLIM. Being as it deals with the Muslim threat without ever using such boilerplate dogma as ""Cheney"", ""Haliburton"", ""Controlled Explosions"" or ""The Jews"" it should not be too surprising that the film was so loathed by the Left that they eschewed all their shallow pretenses of decency and honor........not too mention dubious control of their ever brittle sanity to try and destroy it in a hysterical frenzy. The reviews of the film are staggering barrage of venom and outright dishonesty---to such a degree that they are, in effect, reviewing some other film that exists in their own minds somewhere and not this one.And as always, they are overreacting.The film does have flaws but they are of the artistic/creative nature. As this is an Italian and therefore European film, the picture's pacing is characteristically languid at times. There is an excessive.......and to my mind..inexplicable use of CGI. Is it not possible to show real boats and airplanes anymore?? Must everything be a cartoon?? Of the film's four leads, two are not up to their parts and one is miscast and is a questionable talent in any case. Molla, as the professor, is constantly referred to by other character's in the film as being obsessed and in the reviews as seething and spewing bile while the actor merely seems glum. A little seething passion would have added a little drive to the film and placed things in a sharper relief. As it is, as supposed anti-muslim fanatics go, Molla constantly acts as if someone just told him that his pizza is going to arrive 15 minutes late.While attractive, March has no clue what to do with her character--meant one assumes--to represent those in the West who get all doe eyed and gushy at the surface exoticism of Islamic culture. To be fair, Elizabeth Taylor made a hash of a similar role when she discovered that husband Robert Taylor was a Red in CONSPIRATOR(1949) but, at least, one did not grow to dislike the character as a very silly and stupid woman who sort of gets what she deserves. This may be what the director intended but March does not have it in her to be sympathetic or unsympathetic and she certainly does nothing to help the viewer understand these people who get all goofy whenever a Muslim walks into the room.And most fatally..... someone thought that as the supposedly seductive stone merchant, Harvey Keitel would be a good idea. An actor whose career and popularity is a mystery to me, Keitel...like DeNiro and Pacino..simply CANNOT play anything than modern urban gangster types from the triborough area. Not only is he utterly miscast as a Italian Muslim but he is too old for the part---as described in the film itself---by twenty years. Supposedly devastatingly attractive to March, in a part better suited to an Omar Shariff(or as Hitchcock would have done Joseph Cotten or Ray Milland) type, Keitel, instead, comes across as a constipated cranky old man. Apparently it must be in Keitel's contract that he do nude scenes with attractive actresses because I cannot imagine anyone thinking three sex scenes with a nekid Keitel is ANYONE's idea of erotic. And it is in that section---the middle section---where the film is weak. There is also a suspense scene involving monkey bars that reeks of modern film making and does not really work.The odd thing? In any other film..the slow pace, the CGI and Harvey Keitel in the buff would be hailed as works of brilliance by the same apparatchiks who attack this film while never once addressing its genuine flaws rather than the projected ones.All of the above said??? This is still a very interesting, intelligent and better than average film on several levels. It's honesty, integrity and courage go a long way towards allowing the film to overcome the aforementioned missteps. Art is supposed to be about those attributes and this film has it to spare. You simply will not see a film like this in the United States and I believe this type of film is actually illegal in parts of Europe and certainly in the Islamic world. The Left does NOT want you to see this film and will lie to your face to stop you. The film is probably being ""soft censored"" as we speak.Yet the film says nothing about Islam that is not absolutely true. It makes valid points--with varying degrees of effectiveness about Westerners--be they the average woman on the street dreaming of her sheik to come and carry her off or members of academia/media who deem it their duty to suppress the truth about Islam rather than simply report it. And just to make sure the film had no chance of getting a good review anywhere on the planet, Martinelli takes a charming but true potshot at film critics.The direction--especially the camera work is good. Abraham, as the terrorist mastermind, is solid. The film's first thirty/forty minutes is very good and the final thirty is incredibly effective.While not thinking that one has seen a great film, the viewer will come away with the sad feeling that he has seen a powerful and honest one. Someday this film will be credited as predicting something that tragically will likely occur and future historians will ask why did no one listen??If possible........and I think it will be increasing unlikely as the film is lowly vanishing from availability..........take the opportunity to see this one if you can.It will not be something you regret and the subject is too important.Just cover your eyes when Keitel takes his clothes off!!!",4,Flawed but generally intelligent and brave film on the Muslim Threat,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,6571,"['STONE', 'MERCHANT', '2006', 'Directed', 'Renzo',
