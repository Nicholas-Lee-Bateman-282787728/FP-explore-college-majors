Videos and info that you have to click to watch, can't seem watch all continiously, no Play All feature, so it's bothersome to click on each name at a time.

908678,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009NSCSA,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[33, 37]","Every year in the beginning of August, a month before the NFL season kicks off, the excitement around professional football begins to simmer.  What triggers this commotion around the pigskin is the many training camps and the induction into the National Football League Hall of Fame.  Over many decades the number has exceeded far more than 18,000 players who have experienced the thrills of tackles, blocks, and touchdowns.  Among these a select few, no more than 229 players, as of 2005, have been inducted into this select group for their achievements on the professional gridiron since its opening in 1963.Warner Home Video has together with NFL Films complied a DVD set with three discs, which contains highlights, induction speeches, and gallery with biographical information of the Hall of Fame inductees.  The first disc contains most of the football highlights of the inductees, which has been made into 12 different chapters.  Some of these chapters are named Signature Plays, Game Breakers, and Underdogs.  Each of these chapters runs about 10 minutes in length, and it is jam packed with amazing plays by former players such as Larry Little pancaking a defender to Dick Butkus shaming his opponents with ruthless tackles.  There are also nice elusive runs by players such as Gale Sayers and Barry Sanders to stunning passes by Dan Fouts and others. All of these are inductees of the Hall of Fame who have earned their right by excellence on the football field to be a part of this great DVD.On the second disc the audience can patiently listen to 30 different induction speeches, which is very tedious in one sitting.  Thus, it is warmly recommended for the audience to pace themselves by watching one or two speeches at the time while letting the speech settle in the mind.  However, it is interesting for anyone who is interested in football to listen to these former talented players express their gratitude and the pleasure they have received from football and the individuals in football.  On the third disc, the viewer can discover an extensive encyclopedia that covers all of the 229 members of the NFL Hall of Fame.  It holds information in regards to playing history, place of birth and photos of both the athletes and the bust that can be seen in Canton, Ohio.  There is also a short video attached to each NFL profile, which draws attention to the highlights of the person's NFL career.NFL Films has together with Warner Home Video successfully accomplished to achieve a terrific box set with wonderful packaging.  It is not really true that the DVD has no extras, as the whole box set should be perceived as an extra in itself.  It is one of those box sets that will get NFL fans pumped up for any upcoming season, as it contain awesome tackles, touchdowns, and other important aspects of the gridiron.",5,Terrific NFL History on the Hall of Fame...,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2826,"['year', 'beginning', 'August', 'month', 'NFL', 'season', 'kicks', 'off', 'excitement', 'professional', 'football', 'simmer', 'What', 'commotion', 'pigskin', 'many', 'training', 'camps', 'induction', 'National', 'Football', 'League', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'many', 'decades', 'number', 'exceeded', 'far', 'more', '18,000', 'players', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'thrills', 'tackles', 'blocks', 'touchdowns', 'select', 'few', 'no', 'more', '229', 'players', '2005', 'have', 'been', 'inducted', 'select', 'group', 'achievements', 'professional', 'gridiron', 'opening', '1963.Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'together', 'NFL', 'Films', 'complied', 'DVD', 'set', 'three', 'discs', 'highlights', 'induction', 'speeches', 'gallery', 'biographical', 'information', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'inductees', 'first', 'disc', 'most', 'football', 'highlights', 'inductees', 'been', 'made', '12', 'different', 'chapters', 'chapters', 'are', 'named', 'Signature', 'Plays', 'Game', 'Breakers', 'Underdogs', 'chapters', 'runs', '10', 'minutes', 'length', 'jam', 'packed', 'amazing', 'plays', 'former', 'players', 'such', 'Larry', 'Little', 'pancaking', 'defender', 'Dick', 'Butkus', 'shaming', 'opponents', 'ruthless', 'tackles', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'elusive', 'runs', 'players', 'such', 'Gale', 'Sayers', 'Barry', 'Sanders', 'stunning', 'passes', 'Dan', 'Fouts', 'others', 'are', 'inductees', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'who', 'have', 'earned', 'right', 'excellence', 'football', 'field', 'be', 'part', 'great', 'DVD.On', 'second', 'disc', 'audience', 'can', 'patiently', 'listen', '30', 'different', 'induction', 'speeches', 'very', 'tedious', 'one', 'sitting', 'Thus', 'warmly', 'recommended', 'audience', 'pace', 'watching', 'one', 'two', 'speeches', 'time', 'letting', 'speech', 'settle', 'mind', 'However', 'interesting', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'football', 'listen', 'former', 'talented', 'players', 'express', 'gratitude', 'pleasure', 'have', 'received', 'football', 'individuals', 'football', 'third', 'disc', 'viewer', 'can', 'discover', 'extensive', 'encyclopedia', '229', 'members', 'NFL', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'information', 'regards', 'playing', 'history', 'place', 'birth', 'photos', 'athletes', 'bust', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Canton', 'Ohio', 'also', 'short', 'video', 'attached', 'NFL', 'profile', 'attention', 'highlights', 'person', 'NFL', 'career.NFL', 'Films', 'together', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'successfully', 'accomplished', 'achieve', 'terrific', 'box', 'set', 'wonderful', 'packaging', 'not', 'really', 'true', 'DVD', 'extras', 'whole', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'perceived', 'extra', 'one', 'box', 'sets', 'will', 'get', 'NFL', 'fans', 'pumped', 'up', 'upcoming', 'season', 'awesome', 'tackles', 'touchdowns', 'other', 'important', 'aspects', 'gridiron']",N/A
