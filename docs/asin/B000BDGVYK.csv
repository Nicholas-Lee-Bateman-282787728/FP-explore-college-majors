Otherwise, this movie is great. Sure, Billy Bob Thornton isn't the greatest actor ever, but in this movie he creates a very funny, likeable character that not many people could create. The kids are actually very good in this movie. Occasionally, the blonde one will make one of those stupid parts where it feels awkward, but even he is solid throughout the movie. and that is what creates this comedy, the drunk coach, and is rambunctios kids. Definitely a good movie, although  would recommend renting it first.",4,"Great comedy, story, some stupid parts",1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,671,"['only', 'reason', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'five', 'couple', 'really', 'stupid', 'unfunny', 'parts', 'movie', 'usually', 'having', 'do', 'kids', 'characters', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'great', 'Sure', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'actor', 'ever', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'likeable', 'character', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'create', 'kids', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Occasionally', 'blonde', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'stupid', 'parts', 'where', 'awkward', 'even', 'solid', 'movie', 'what', 'comedy', 'drunk', 'coach', 'rambunctios', 'kids', 'Definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'first']",N/A
940698,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B000BDGVYK,Amy Henley,"[1, 4]","My real rating is 3 1/2 stars.  I saw the orignal movie when I was the same age as the kids in the movie, and loved it.  I was, of course, afraid the new one was going to suck and replace all my good memories with bad, but I am pleased to say that didn't happen. In fact, it was a fun renter and had some good DVD featurettes.  I just wish it had more outtakes.The writers, director, and actors do a good job of showing the humourous side to members of the team learning important life lessons.  Plus, I think casting picked some real winners.  I really like Billy Bob Thorton as Buttermaker. Perhaps even more than Walter Mathaeau (Scandalous, I know).  I don't think that he was copying Walter Matheau.  He made the role his own by giving it a more sexy-sleazy twist, while still having a heart of gold (contrary to what some other reviewers said).  Although many people make a big deal out of who played Buttermaker, for me it was the character Amanda.  I didn't think anyone could play Amanda better than Jodie Foster, but again it was a matter of the actor making the role her own and not trying to copy the original.  I thought the kids did an outstanding job considering many of them had no previous experience.  They also had just as much, and some cases more, personality than the original cast (e.g. the kid who played Kelley).  Each of them stand out in my mind as individuals because of how well they played their characters and because the  writers gave them their own time and one-liners to develop a personality.As far as the age of kids to see it....  some people are horrified by the language and content.  Unfortunately, I've seen and heard worse come out of kids mouths.  First of all, the kids in the movie are in 6th grade which is close to the age of the PG-13 rating.  Second, when you think of all the sex and violence kids usually see and the langauge they speak every day and then compare it to the positive messages of hard work pays off, there is no 'i' in team, building self-esteem, and good sportmanship, etc., there is no contest.  I would highly recommend it.  However, I probably wouldn't take anyone under nine either.",4,better than I expected,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2153,"['real', 'rating', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'saw', 'orignal', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'same', 'age', 'kids', 'movie', 'loved', 'was', 'course', 'afraid', 'new', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'suck', 'replace', 'good', 'memories', 'bad', 'am', 'pleased', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'fact', 'was', 'fun', 'renter', 'had', 'good', 'DVD', 'featurettes', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'outtakes.The', 'writers', 'director', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'humourous', 'side', 'members', 'team', 'learning', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'think', 'casting', 'picked', 'real', 'winners', 'really', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'Buttermaker', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'Walter', 'Mathaeau', 'Scandalous', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'copying', 'Walter', 'Matheau', 'made', 'role', 'own', 'giving', 'more', 'sexy-sleazy', 'twist', 'still', 'having', 'heart', 'gold', 'contrary', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'many', 'people', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'who', 'played', 'Buttermaker', 'was', 'character', 'Amanda', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'play', 'Amanda', 'better', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'again', 'was', 'matter', 'actor', 'making', 'role', 'own', 'not', 'trying', 'copy', 'original', 'thought', 'kids', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'considering', 'many', 'had', 'previous', 'experience', 'also', 'had', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'cases', 'more', 'personality', 'original', 'cast', 'e.g', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Kelley', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'individuals', 'how', 'well', 'played', 'characters', 'writers', 'gave', 'own', 'time', 'one-liners', 'develop', 'personality.As', 'far', 'age', 'kids', 'see', 'people', 'are', 'horrified', 'language', 'content', 'Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'worse', 'come', 'kids', 'mouths', 'First', 'all', 'kids', 'movie', 'are', '6th', 'grade', 'close', 'age', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Second', 'when', 'think', 'sex', 'violence', 'kids', 'usually', 'see', 'langauge', 'speak', 'day', 'then', 'compare', 'positive', 'messages', 'hard', 'work', 'pays', 'off', 'i', 'team', 'building', 'self-esteem', 'good', 'sportmanship', 'etc.', 'contest', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'However', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'anyone', 'nine']",N/A

Billy Bob plays Bad Santa playing an ex professional ball player playing a coach of a little league team (watch the movie and that will make sense).  The movie illicited a few chuckles and the story didnt really take any major turns from the original.  They definetly pushed the limit of taste with some of the jokes which made it a little more amusing.  Overall this wasnt a bad movie but it wasnt a great one either.

940704,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000BDGVYK,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 4]","""The Bad News Bears"" is yet another remake of an older film that, once again, fails to capture the spirit of the original. Many people have watched the original movie from the 1970's that starred Walter Matthau in the lead role as Coach Morris Buttermaker and know how entertaining of a film it was, both for young and old alike.This time around, the viewer is treated to Billy Bob Thornton as the head coach of the hapless baseball team and the result this time around is less than stellar. I like Billy Bob Thornton and I can usually find something worthwhile in most of his movies (typically, his own performance). But with ""Bad News Bears"" there is little to cheer about and it pales in comparison to the 1976 original.Much of the basic script for this movie is the same as it was back in the 1970's but anyone who has seen the older movie would be hard pressed to find much good to say about the remake. First of all, the kids on this team are obnoxious- so much so, that you don't really care whether they win or lose. Yes, it would be nice to see their young minds get a much needed boost in self- esteem. But the way they act, toward other teams and toward each other, made me feel indifferent. I didn't really care what happened to them as the film progressed.Many people have criticized this comedy for the harsh language used by Thornton and the kids. Yes, there is a good deal of cussing going on and more conservative viewers will not find it amusing at all to hear so many four letter words hurled from the mouths of elementary school kids (it was given a PG-13 rating because the director wisely decided not to let the kids say ""f-ck"", even though they say everything else). But the truth is, even if you took away the language issue, there is still very little to recommend with this movie. The plot of the movie is simple and it stays simple. There are no surprises and no suspense. It moves along at a decent pace most of the time but there isn't any real chemistry between the performers on the screen to keep it interesting. And there is no character development in this film. Other than the Spanish speaking kid learning how to insult people the American way (he is taught by Timmy Deters), no one in the film really changes at all from beginning to end. They are all the same sorry group of kids and adults.Another thing that is sub par in this movie is the direction. I have seen weaker efforts, but there are some scenes in this movie that had me scratching my head, wondering why on earth the director would have included such a silly scene. One example is when one of the kids leans against the door of Buttermaker's car while he is driving and falls out. Buttermaker stops the car and finds the kid lying face down in the bushes. The kid doesn't respond at first, but eventually does and Buttermaker takes the smiling youngster back to his car. This scene was completely pointless. It didn't foreshadow anything and it had no relationship to any other part of the film. There were other scenes like this one, too, where I could not understand what the director was thinking. It almost seemed like he was in need of filler to reach a specific amount of viewing time and thus proceeded to include meaningless material to fill up space.So let's see, this movie has bad dialogue, weak acting (even from Thornton, who should not have played this role), and no character development. Is there anything worthwhile about it? The only thing I can think of that prevents me from giving this film one star is the occasional use of funny one- liners and physical humor. Probably the funniest scene in the film comes when actor Timmy Deters, frustrated that his team can't play defense, decides to start tackling base runners as they attempt to get from second to third base. This, and a few humorous lines from Thornton and some of the kids, give it just enough entertainment value to give it a rating slightly better than the bomb that it almost was.Remakes are awfully popular these days and there have been a few that I considered respectable efforts to recapture the spark the made the originals so enjoyable. But others are not so good, and this movie is one of them. ""Bad News Bears"" offers no magic like one would expect in a sports movie. You don't find yourself cheering for the home team in this movie. The only cheering is the hope that it will end as soon as possible so you can watch the original or view a real sports movie with real entertainment.

940711,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000BDGVYK,Cubist,"[1, 2]","If fans of Richard Linklater's films were nervous when he entered the mainstream with School of Rock, a Jack Black vehicle with kids, then they must've freaked out when it was announced that he was remaking The Bad News Bears with Billy Bob Thornton and kids. Linklater managed to escape relatively unscathed with School of Rock and then used its success to make the more personal Before Sunset. He's done the same with Bad News Bears, making it for the studios so that he could then make the much riskier, more experimental A Scanner Darkly. At first glance, it seems a rather calculated move: take the director of School of Rock and the star of Bad Santa (2003) and voila, instant box office hit.But look closer and you can see what must've appealed to Linklater: the original Bears movie came out in 1976 - the same year that Linklater's Dazed and Confused is set in. The original Bears movie was pretty subversive for its day: foul-mouthed hellraisers coached by a sarcastic burn-out played by Walter Matthau. This time around, Thornton plays the alcoholic burn-out, Morris Buttermaker, an ex-pro ballplayer now exterminator who is enlisted to coach a misfit team of Little Leaguers. He's hit rock bottom and likes the view, refusing to give a crap about much of anything anymore.As he demonstrated with School of Rock, Linklater works well with kids and is able to get natural performances out of them. He keeps the kids rooted in reality and doesn't allow them to resort to shameless mugging. The kids improve gradually over the course of the movie and it doesn't happen miraculously overnight. When they do start winning it is well-earned. Compared to the bland, kid sports movie, Kicking and Screaming, this one is much wittier and feels more genuine, like it was made by someone who actually has his own personal filmmaking style. Linklater's trademark, laid-back style and charm have survived intact. At times, his movie evokes those sunny, summer afternoons spent playing ball. As he did with Rock, Linklater sticks close to the formula of the genre but finds enough tiny variations to keep things interesting. It is an unnecessary remake but entertaining nonetheless. He is obviously a fan of the original and keeps true to its raunchy spirit.There is an audio commentary by Linklater and screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. Linklater addresses the stigma of remakes and thought that it was a good opportunity to not just modernize but remain true to the original's raunchy roots. If you've listened to Linklater's commentaries in the past, you know what you're in for: a laid-back vibe with self-effacing humour that is very engaging.""At Bat with the Bears"" takes a look at how the film came together. Linklater loves baseball and always wanted to do a movie about the sport. He was hesitant about doing a remake but Thornton's involvement and the script changed his mind.""Writing the Bad News Bears"" is an interview with screenwriters Ficarra and Requa and how they set out to write a remake. They didn't want to change much from the original, just update it, like diversifying the kids on the team and so on.""Scouting for the Big Leagues"" takes a look at the casting process for the kids in the movie, including clips from their audition tapes. The challenge was to find distinctive kids and not just with looks but personality as well.""Spring Training"" is a brief look at how the kids trained to play baseball and how the games were choreographed. It was all about technique and selling it to the camera.There are also six deleted scenes with optional commentary by Linkater, Ficarra and Requa. They put the footage into context and talk about why they were cut out (mostly for time).Also included are three outtakes with optional commentary.In a nice touch, ""Video Baseball Cards"" gives a mini-bio on Thornton and his team.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",4,Not as good as the original but still quite entertaining...,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,3887,"['fans', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'films', 'were', 'nervous', 'when', 'entered', 'mainstream', 'School', 'Rock', 'Jack', 'Black', 'vehicle', 'kids', 'then', 'must', ""'ve"", 'freaked', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'remaking', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'kids', 'Linklater', 'managed', 'escape', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'School', 'Rock', 'then', 'used', 'success', 'make', 'more', 'personal', 'Sunset', 'done', 'same', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'making', 'studios', 'so', 'could', 'then', 'make', 'much', 'riskier', 'more', 'experimental', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'first', 'glance', 'rather', 'calculated', 'move', 'take', 'director', 'School', 'Rock', 'star', 'Bad', 'Santa', '2003', 'voila', 'instant', 'box', 'office', 'hit.But', 'look', 'closer', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'must', ""'ve"", 'appealed', 'Linklater', 'original', 'Bears', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1976', 'same', 'year', 'Linklater', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'set', 'original', 'Bears', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'subversive', 'day', 'foul-mouthed', 'hellraisers', 'coached', 'sarcastic', 'burn-out', 'played', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'time', 'around', 'Thornton', 'alcoholic', 'burn-out', 'Morris', 'Buttermaker', 'ex-pro', 'ballplayer', 'now', 'exterminator', 'who', 'enlisted', 'coach', 'misfit', 'team', 'Little', 'Leaguers', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'view', 'refusing', 'give', 'crap', 'much', 'anything', 'anymore.As', 'demonstrated', 'School', 'Rock', 'Linklater', 'well', 'kids', 'able', 'get', 'natural', 'performances', 'kids', 'rooted', 'reality', ""n't"", 'allow', 'resort', 'shameless', 'mugging', 'kids', 'improve', 'gradually', 'course', 'movie', ""n't"", 'happen', 'miraculously', 'overnight', 'When', 'do', 'start', 'winning', 'well-earned', 'Compared', 'bland', 'kid', 'sports', 'movie', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'one', 'much', 'wittier', 'feels', 'more', 'genuine', 'was', 'made', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'own', 'personal', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'Linklater', 'trademark', 'laid-back', 'style', 'charm', 'have', 'survived', 'intact', 'times', 'movie', 'evokes', 'sunny', 'summer', 'afternoons', 'spent', 'playing', 'ball', 'did', 'Rock', 'Linklater', 'close', 'formula', 'genre', 'enough', 'tiny', 'variations', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'unnecessary', 'remake', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless', 'obviously', 'fan', 'original', 'true', 'raunchy', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Linklater', 'screenwriters', 'Glenn', 'Ficarra', 'John', 'Requa', 'Linklater', 'stigma', 'remakes', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'opportunity', 'not', 'just', 'modernize', 'remain', 'true', 'original', 'raunchy', 'roots', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'Linklater', 'commentaries', 'past', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'laid-back', 'vibe', 'self-effacing', 'humour', 'very', 'engaging', 'Bat', 'Bears', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'Linklater', 'baseball', 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'movie', 'sport', 'was', 'hesitant', 'doing', 'remake', 'Thornton', 'involvement', 'script', 'changed', 'mind', 'Writing', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'interview', 'screenwriters', 'Ficarra', 'Requa', 'how', 'set', 'out', 'write', 'remake', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'much', 'original', 'just', 'update', 'diversifying', 'kids', 'team', 'so', 'Scouting', 'Big', 'Leagues', 'look', 'casting', 'process', 'kids', 'movie', 'including', 'clips', 'audition', 'tapes', 'challenge', 'was', 'find', 'distinctive', 'kids', 'not', 'just', 'looks', 'personality', 'as', 'well', 'Spring', 'Training', 'brief', 'look', 'how', 'kids', 'trained', 'play', 'baseball', 'how', 'games', 'were', 'choreographed', 'was', 'technique', 'selling', 'camera.There', 'are', 'also', 'six', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Linkater', 'Ficarra', 'Requa', 'put', 'footage', 'context', 'talk', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'mostly', 'time', '.Also', 'included', 'are', 'three', 'outtakes', 'optional', 'commentary.In', 'nice', 'touch', 'Video', 'Baseball', 'Cards', 'mini-bio', 'Thornton', 'team.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

Don't get me wrong...I thought it was hilarious, and I mean beings that the original was quite offensive as well you have to understand that the remake would keep in the same vein.  Billy Bob THorton takes on the roll of the drunk coach and he has a whole string of kids who have bad attitudes and can't play the game.  THrow in a female pitcher, the school badboy and a rival coach played by Greg Kenear and you have yourselves entertainment...with enough jokes at the expence of fat kids, handicapped and mentally slow children and ethnic stereotypes to keep you laughing...and believe me, the first time you see Hooper (the overweight child in a wheelchair) driving onto the field you'll bust a gut laughing...because its funny.  The children have worse mouths than Billy Bob, especially Tanner the short fuse blonde kid who resorts to throwing his gloves at the opposing team when he can't catch the ball.  The film is a riot, but the attitudes of these children can be somewhat obnoxious at times and take away from the hilarity of the film...I mean, theres only so much you can take before it's too much.  That's why I say it starts off slow and ends strong, because in the beginning when you meet these kids they lather on the profanity and the fighting so thick it's overwhelming, but once the film kicks into gear the script gets tighter and the laughs start coming...so it ends memerable...even though it ends with an indian boy telling another kid to shove a trophy up his @$$...ha, back where we started.",4,Starts off slow but ends strong,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,1832,"['Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'quite', 'few', 'simularities', 'Will', 'Ferralls', 'last', 'gig', ""'Kicking"", 'Screaming', 'misfit', 'coach', 'misfit', 'kids', 'moral', 'element', ""'is"", 'winning', 'everything', ""'Kicking"", 'Screaming', 'sutable', '5', 'year', 'old', ""'Bad"", 'News', 'Bears', 'offended', 'parents', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'mean', 'beings', 'original', 'was', 'quite', 'offensive', 'well', 'have', 'understand', 'remake', 'would', 'keep', 'same', 'vein', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'THorton', 'roll', 'drunk', 'coach', 'whole', 'string', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'bad', 'attitudes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'game', 'THrow', 'female', 'pitcher', 'school', 'badboy', 'rival', 'coach', 'played', 'Greg', 'Kenear', 'have', 'yourselves', 'entertainment', 'enough', 'jokes', 'expence', 'fat', 'kids', 'handicapped', 'mentally', 'slow', 'children', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'keep', 'laughing', 'believe', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Hooper', 'overweight', 'child', 'wheelchair', 'driving', 'field', ""'ll"", 'bust', 'gut', 'laughing', 'funny', 'children', 'have', 'worse', 'mouths', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'especially', 'Tanner', 'short', 'fuse', 'blonde', 'kid', 'who', 'throwing', 'gloves', 'opposing', 'team', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'ball', 'film', 'riot', 'attitudes', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'obnoxious', 'times', 'take', 'away', 'hilarity', 'film', 'mean', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'why', 'say', 'slow', 'strong', 'beginning', 'when', 'meet', 'kids', 'lather', 'profanity', 'fighting', 'so', 'thick', 'overwhelming', 'once', 'film', 'gear', 'script', 'tighter', 'laughs', 'start', 'coming', 'memerable', 'even', 'indian', 'boy', 'telling', 'kid', 'shove', 'trophy', 'up', '@', 'ha', 'back', 'where', 'started']",N/A
940713,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000BDGVYK,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[1, 1]","The first time I heard that Billy Bob Thorton was going to be starring in the remake of The Bad News Bears I was pumped.  I mean who else could be a good Buttermaker?  Well after seeing the movie, I would have to guess that a whole lot of actors could have performed better.  Throuought the whole movie I kept waiting for Billy Bob to ""kick"" in with that IT-factor he usually sports, and at not time did that ever happen.  He seemed to just let this performance slide right by.That said, there are a few rays of light in this film.  Sammi Kane Kraft plays Amanda Whurlitzer, Buttermaker's daughter, and she is brilliant in the role.  I read that this is her first acting job!  I can guarantee it won't be her last.  She added some spark to this remake, delivering a performance that came close to the original performance with Tatum O'neal.  In fact, in some ways, she did a better job.  She didn't yell out her lines, or push the drama too far.  I think she had the best performance in this film.  No, I'm not happy about some of the dialogue from her character, but now that she has proven herself to be an awesome actress, she'll be able to choose roles that don't have her talking like she just climbed out of the gutter...maybeTimmy Deters (Kicking and Screaming) also brings a little bit of character to this movie with his perfomance as Tanner Boyle, though he had a very hard act to follow. Chris Barnes made that role one of the most memorable characters in movie history!  The kid tried to take on the whole sixth-grade.  I bet Chris grew up to become an Ultimate Fighter!Jeffery Tedmori is another one who rises to the level of a mention in this review.  He plays the role of Garo Daragebrigadian, and I can't even say that name!  I see that this kid was in a movie with Eric Roberts.  No wonder he can act!Overall, I was rather upset by the movie as a whole, but this movie could help launch the careers of some really good young actors.  So maybe something good may come out of its production.

Yet somehow, they never transcend being Greg Kinnear and Billy Bob Thorton acting in a lame remake of Bad News Bears.  And unfortunately the kid actors do nothing to distiguish themselves either.At no point in this movie does anything feel even remotely realistic.  The baseball games, the dialogue, the interactions between the kids, the relationships between the characters, the ""brawl"" scenes...it all feels staged and scripted.  It's almost like the filmmakers felt like it was enough just to have the character spout vulgarities and constantly bicker.  That miscalculation leaves a very empty movie in its wake.I went in hoping director Richard Linklater could again capture lightning in a bottle, like he did in the excellent School of Rock.  Now I understand that the success of that movie was more a result of Jack Black's tremendous performance, rather than anything Linklater did.  Though those child actors were light years ahead of what is on display here.Normally, Bad News Bears would be remarkable for it's mediocrity, it's phoniness and sub-par performances.

It was such a good movie because it essentially brought the ""Little Rascals"" up to speed by introducing vulgar language and behavior into the context of screen-childhood.  The kids smoked, cussed, talked about sex, etc.:  that's what pre-pubescent kids do.  Matthau was the perfect degenerate:  a aged pool boy alcoholic who simply wanted to make a little more money for booze by ""coaching"" a group of athletically incompetent kids.  But what he also captured, as the movie apparently was designed to, was the gradual change from being a completely out of it loser - an anonymous nothing waiting for death in Southern California - to an increasingly enlightened man, with an renewed sense of the possibilities of life, by rediscovering his humanity through the kids.  The movie's final - and finest - moment is when Buttermaker (Matthau) realized he doesn't want to be a jock dad, yelling at kids to satisfy his own sense of emptiness.  In fact, by degrees, from the time he gets Amanda (Tatum O'Neal), his daughter from a broken marriage and an ace pitcher, to play for the Bears, Buttermaker is already on the road to redemption.  The movie is so interesting because it is in effect about Buttermaker's journey back from savagery to civilization.Not so this pathetic attempt to ... to ... to do I don't know what.  Billy Bob Thornton, who never was and probably never will be able to convey humanity, is a poor choice for Buttermaker.  Apparently the producers wanted an alcoholic loser-type.  BBT is good at that:  cf. ""Bad Santa.""  But what he isn't good at is the transition, the journey from beast to human.  In fact, the crucial moment, when Buttermaker sees the jock dad berating and even slapping his own son, is all but lost.  Apparently, we're supposed to laugh more at BBT's portrayal of a loser than understand that people can actually come back from such self-inflicted hells as Buttermaker's.  Indeed, Buttermaker's only a loser because he doesn't believe in himself.  At the end of this movie, we expect BBT to fall right off the wagon and head back to the Cabo-of-his-mind.This whole remake is transparently that and can't hold a candle to the original, most especially because the message is lost.  BBT again reprises ""bad Santa.""  The kid-cast all seem to have seen the original about 100 times each:  they try really hard to imitate their models - and wind up depriving themselves of believability.  (Lupus's own struggle is all but lost in one catch, for which there is no real preface.)  The girl who plays Amanda is at least seventeen years old and as wooden an actress as I've ever seen.  And where is the cigarette-smoking, hell raising ""Kelly Leak?""  The original was a great character:  an angry bat, riding a Honda, right out of the suburban hell and shopping mall wastelands of southern California of the '60s and '70s.  The actor who played him got it just right.  The kid who plays him in this movie is no ""Kelly Leak"":  he's cardboard.For these remakes, we must ask, why?  This does nothing whatsoever for anybody:  actors, audience, art.  It was undoubtedly extraordinarily cheap to produce and it traded on its great antecedent.  Anyway, this is total crap, top to bottom, left to right, up and down.  Don't rent it!  Rent the original.

I think he should've even been nominated. He played Coach Morris Buttermaker, a drunk former professional baseball player. He gets stuck coaching a little league team. He would even drink while coaching the team. He wasn't exactly a winner but Matthau made you like him anyway. Billy Bob Thornton takes over the role and although he's a great actor too, he's being type casted. Since playing in Bad Santa he's going to be type casted as a mean drunk who curses around children. He does it great but it's getting old quick and he is too good of an actor just to be playing those roles.Here he's just playing Bad Santa as well. He gets drunk and curses at the kids. Yes Matthau got drunk in the original but he wasn't as mean spirited and sleazy. Thornton takes the kids to Hooter's to celebrate whenever they win  and yes that is funny. He also has women that look like porn stars as cheerleaders for the Bears. He sleeps with the mom of one of the kids and when he sneaks out of her room, the kid sees him. He lies about just being there to make sure he greases up his baseball glove.  All that is funny but sleazy. At times the film is exactly like the original. The kids even give the same exact performance as the kids in the original at times. The little blonde kid who has an attitude could even be the nephew or son of the guy who played him in the original lol. I mean they even look alike and and the performance is pretty much the same.

940731,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BDGVYK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","I agree that remaking ""Bad News Bears"" with the writing team of ""Bad Santa"" retooling the Walter Matthau role for Billy Bob Thornton is a good idea.  Giving Buttermaker a harder edge makes sense, but that changes the dynamic of the film because now the coach is more foul-mouthed than the kids, which was what made people notice the 1976 original.  But he is also a darker character, engaged in a destructive spiral of self-loathing, which actually provides better motivation for his attempt at redemption (when the kids hate him almost as much it is too close for the comfort of his psyche).Coach Morris Buttermaker (Thornton) is certainly more profane and more inebriated than in the original, but what stands out for me is that he actually tries to teach the kids the game of baseball.  They could have played this up more, because besides getting Amanda and Kelly, the Bears really do have to improve as a team to make the championship game (the biggest flaw with regards to playing Little League in these films is the idea that Amanda is pitching every game).Coach Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear) is actually the key character in the film, because once Buttermaker changes, Bullock needs to change too.  The idea is to make him more gung-ho, a know-it-all wannabe who thinks that makes him better than being a brief-moment-of-glory has-been like Buttermaker.  Kinnear is well suited to such a role, but it sets up the worst moment in the film when Bullock goes after his son, Joey (Carter Jenkins) for throwing a bean ball at Engleberg.  That scene was pivotal in the original movie with Vic Morrow (it gave substance to the profanity by pointing out that overbearing parents are the worst parts of competitive sports when you are a kid), but here it rings hollow.  There needed to be a different scene here.Liz Whitewood (Marcia Gay Harden), the parent who gets Buttermaker to coach, is now a woman instead of a man.  This also takes away from the indictment of what parents do to kids when they play sports.  She is also a lawyer, and the Bears exist because of a class action lawsuit that insists all kids should get to play.  This could have been a more fertile area to explore, but it is just a set up that is thrown away.Pitcher Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft) gets points for the look on her face when she releases her pitches and like most of the first time actors in the cast contributes to the kids seeming like real kids.  Outfielder Kelly Leak (Jeffrey Davies) does not come across as much of a bad boy, but when he swings a bat and especially the one time he does a perfect pop up slide into third base, he certainly looks like a Little League superstar (bet he could pitch the games Amanada does not).Shortstop Tanner Boyle (Timmy Deters) is a shadow of the original simply because he cannot be more profane than before.  But it was always his pugnacity more than his constant stream of profanity that made him endearing.  Catcher Mike Engleberg (Brandon Craggs) and outfielder Timothy Lupus (Tyler Patrick Jones) are about the same, as are Miguel and Jose Agilar (Carlos and Emmanuel Estrada) except for being taller.  Prem Lahiri (Aman Johal) turns the role of the team nerd into an opportunity to increase the ethnicity of the team, but without much of a payoff, and the same can be said for first baseman Ahmad Abdul Rahim (Kenneth ""K.C."" Harris), who is no longer an angry young Black Muslim but a rather thoughtful kid who just wants to play baseball like his hero, Mark McGwire (the joke here has to do with McGwire being white and has nothing to do with steroids).The two ""new"" members of the team are Matthew Hooper (Troy Gentile), who is confined to a wheelchair, and Garo Daragebrigadian (Jeffrey Tedmori), who wants to play baseball despite his Armenian father's disdain for the pastime.  These do have some payoffs and suggest that coming up with more differences from the original film would have made for a better movie.  They could have taken the basic original idea and characters and come up with something true to the spirit of the original without following the basic blueprint.The rationale for doing so is easy.  Sports have changed in the three decades since ""The Bad News Bears"" first came out.  Money talks and loyalty walks more than ever, we are just beginning to learn how much steroids and drugs are part of playing the game, and no athlete is too young to be exploited.  At the Little League level there are certainly scandals (altering birth certificates) but there are also some notable efforts to make playing baseball fun again (T-Ball).  Still, parents living vicariously through their children will always be with us.  Ultimately, director Richard Linklater needed to update the story more than the characters.  This ""Bad News Bears"" gets to a 2-2 count and then fouls off the next pitch.",3,"More steps backwards than forwards for the ""Bad News Bears"" remake",1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,4843,"['agree',

940735,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000BDGVYK,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 2]","Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob) has been asked to coach a rag tag bunch of kids, who have no shot of winning one game, in a little league for baseball. After loosing their first game of the season and being taunted by the other teams coach, Buttermaker decides to actually try and get his team to actually start playing better so they don't become a laughing stock like he has been for the latter part of his life. With the help of the arm of his ex-wife's daughter and also the rebel `biker' kid who can slam the ball out of the park on a bad day, just maybe The Bears have chance to show the league what they really got... and that means Bad News for the league.There should be a Billy Bob kid movie every year in my opinion because Billy Bob + Kids = Win. While some parents would disagree, I absolutely love his take on the dead beat roles he plays around kids. Instead of practicing, he takes his team to go do his other job (pesticide) and has them throwing bug bombs under the house, carrying dead rats around and telling them to just throw it in the house garbage, telling the kids to stop spraying the bug poison at each other like they are water guns, not because it's poisonous, but because it's expensive. The constant cursing adds to the laughs also. I just love how Buttermaker is the exact opposite of how an adult is supposed to act around kids. I love when he pours out half his beer from a can and fills it with like Jack Daniels or something. To funny.While I understand some people can't stand this movie, because it's a remake, I just don't understand why people cant like it for what it is. Sure the two movies are very different in ways, so in all honesty, just pretend it's not a remake. Just think of it as it's own movie. Both movies are very funny in their own way. Sometimes I think people just want to hate on something just to hate. But this Bad News Bears does allow itself to be hated by parents though because of the way Buttermaker is. He's constantly drinking, taking the kids to Hooters, has strippers and hooter girls showing up in the stands to cheer for the team, hitting kids with pitches, and even letting them drink beer...non-alcoholic beer at least. But that's where the charm is in this movie for me.The Bad News Bears (2005) is definitely a funny movie if you like the crude humor that this movie deals out. It's a Billy Bob movie...what do you expect?! Own this movie!P.S. - I used to play little league ball. I remember playing second base once (I was a third baseman later on in my years) when I was around 8 years old. I remember a friend of mine was at bat for the other team and he hit it right to me. Routine ground ball, until it hit a rock. It bounced up and hit me square in the mouth and knocked out my front baby teeth. Of course I started crying, but not cause it hurt. Oh no. I started crying cause I was freaking out that I lost my teeth and I wouldn't get money from the Tooth Fairy. So the umps had to call time out and we had everyone looking for my teeth...lol. We found them and I got 10 dollars that night!

The Walter Matthau/Tatum O'Neil 1976 version is just fine.That all said, Billy Bob Thornton is about as good as Matthau, as Coach Buttermaker, an oleagenous, drunken exterminator and former pro ballplayer hired to coach a little league team of misfits.The kids, a California ethnic mix, and their modern parents are a good update, but otherwise, the new BEARS parallels the original and provides about the same level of raunch, race, and wit.The original was edgy in '76, but the remake is tame by early 21st century standards, such as Thornton's recent opus, Bad Santa.Still, in all, if you haven't seen the original, go ahead and buy and watch this one.

Some grizzled veteran goes in to teach kids what the real spirit of (insert game here) is, thus turning them from underdogs into champions.  This one has the ""Bad Santa"" twist: Billy Bob Thornton being very rude around children.  Because, see, he's saying very profane things, and they're like, children, you see?  That's funny.  It's a joke, get it?  In case you didn't get it, we'll repeat the same joke for about 45 minutes before we get into any sort of exposition.The exposition basically involving this: the team is getting better, but they can't win until they get GOOD players.  See, because that's just heartening to see the underdogs have to have some amazing big kids come along and win their games for them.  Then we get some more rude language, a sappy bit of twelve-year-old trying to be an adult (because, see... she's twelve.  But she thinks she's an adult.  And kids, like... they're growing up so fast now.  And that's funny.  So we're going to repeat that joke for the duration of the movie...), and that's basically how it goes until the climactic game against the evil ""Last-year's winning team"" that is distinctive only because they're bigger in stature than our heroic team.  Because the other team is a bunch of bullies, but then again so is the team we've been following.  And that coach, he's a big meanie, but then again... so's the coach we've been following.  In fact, this movie is just kind of watching a bunch of bullies be bullies to each other, only the one kid who isn't a bully... well he never succeeds, he drops the ball all throughout, but hey, at least the crippled bully behind him becomes a better person when he catches it!It does, technically, have a good message about having fun, and the fact that it doesn't exactly turn out the way you expect is nice too.  But who cares about that when it undermines that theme by ending with, again, kids bullying each other?  ""That's what I'm talking about!""So, wait, that's what I've spent the last two hours of my life doing, watching kids continually say the Big Bad S-word repetitively?

The message of the movie, intended or not, is that if you entrust your children to the supervision of a perverse, irresponsible drunkard, everything will work out fine in the end.There are a couple positives: the music (which was about the same as in the original version, no improvement), and the performance of Greg Kinnear as the ""bad guy.""

940750,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000BDGVYK,Reviewer,"[4, 9]","Over the years, the ""sports"" movie has become a genre unto itself, and good or bad, these films are for the most part well received by a significant cross section of the population who hold the fundamental belief that sports=America=patriotism.  And filmmakers know it.  That's why most of these films feature thematic variations rooted in the ""Win one for the Gipper,"" ""It's not winning, but how you play the game"" and ""There's no 'I' in 'team'"" mentality.  How refreshing, then, when one like ""Bad News Bears"" comes along to provide a much needed perspective on our society's preoccupation with sports in general, and amateur athletics in particular.Based on the 1976 screenplay by Bill Lancaster and updated by screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who successfully teamed up with Thornton for 2003's ""Bad Santa""), the story is about a local little league that has excluded a group of youngsters for failing to live up to their standards of physical prowess (they just aren't good enough to play with the ""real"" eleven and twelve year old ""athletes""), the mother who sues the organization so that her son can play, the resultant team of diverse ""misfits"" the league must accommodate, and the man hired by the mother to manage that team.That man in none other than Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton), a former professional baseball player who once pitched 2/3 of an inning in the Big Leagues and who now makes a living by exterminating rats.  ""Boilermaker"" Buttermaker likes to drink, frequents the local Hooters and doesn't give a fig about what anyone thinks about him.  Not that he's a rugged, iconoclastic individualist; far from it.  He's just a guy who refuses to play the game anymore (and we're not talking about baseball here).  On the surface, he's probably not the guy you'd choose to be your kid's role model, mainly because of all the things he ""isn't.""  Upon closer examination, however, it becomes apparent that being a hypocrite is among the things he ""isn't,"" and it's very telling as to the man's true character.On the other side of the fence, meanwhile, there's the manager of the Yankees, Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear), a real coach's coach, a pillar of the community (he's a car salesman) and the very personification of The Great American Role Model.  He's as American as apple pie, and if there's a high moral ground in evidence here, he's on it.  And, he is by all that's holy, going to take his team to the championships.  His team is going to win, no matter what, because, after all, winning is everything, isn't it?  Even if it means expecting your twelve-year-old to play like a Major Leaguer with a multimillion dollar contract, and publicly chastising him when he doesn't.And therein lies the beauty of this film.  Without preaching, without pointing fingers, but simply by presenting a realistic depiction of one of our sacred institutions, the ""coach,"" the true nature of what millions of kids are subjected to in the name of ""sportsmanship"" year after year in this country is exposed, and with no apology necessary.  At the same time it says that kids are worth more, much more, than what the Roy Bullock philosophy has to offer.  The Roy Bullocks of the world will tell you that this kind of treatment ""builds character.""  I beg to differ.  And it's up to the Morris Buttermakers of the world to level the playing field.  And when the rubber meets the road, I'd want my kid on Boilermaker Buttermaker's team rather than Bullock's any day of the week.Director Linklater assembled a superb cast for this film, beginning with Thornton, who makes Buttermaker a very real, if flawed, flesh and blood human being, quite different from the likeable caricature created by Walter Matthau in the 1976 original version.  Kinnear delivers, as well, by capturing the very essence of a character that anyone who has ever been near a little league-- or any sports field-- has known in real life.  And in the confrontations between Buttermaker and Bullock, Thornton and Kinnear give it a ring of truth that is beyond anything you'll ever see on any of the ""reality"" TV shows.Add to that a credible performance by Marcia Gay Harden as Liz whitewood (the mother who sues the little league), and an amazing group of young actors:  Sammi Kane Kraft (Amanda); Ridge Canipe (Toby); Brandon Craggs (Mike); Jeffrey Davies (Kelly); Timmy Deters (Tanner); Carlos Estrada (Miguel); Emmanuel Estrada (Jose); Troy Gentile (Hooper); Kenneth Harris (Ahmad); Aman Johal (Prem); Tyler Patrick Jones (Lupus); Jeffrey Tedmori (Garo); Carter Jenkins (Joey); and Seth Adkins (Jimmy), and you've got a movie that's going all the way to the World Series.The acerbic humor and biting satire of ""Bad News Bears"" is without a doubt going to generate some mixed reviews.  Some viewers will be offended by this film; others will be outraged.  But that's because the truth hurts, and the fact of the matter is, there's a lot of Roy Bullocks out there, and they'll all be expecting a movie that confirms their point of view and sanctions their own sanctimonious belief that the lessons learned on the diamond, the court or the football field are all positive, the stuff that ""champions"" are made of.  Instead, they're going to see a film that has the guts to call a spade a spade, that isn't entirely politically correct and in the end may make it necessary for them to take stock and reevaluate the real world that exists out there beyond the shells of the cocoons in which they've ensconced themselves.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.",4,A Film With a Real Bite To It.,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,5553,"['years', 'sports', 'movie', 'become', 'genre', 'good', 'bad', 'films', 'are',

Retired minor league pitcher Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) played 2/3 of an inning in the majors, at a time ""long ago and far away,"" and describes his current situation like so: ""I make a living killing rats so I can pay rent on a trailer."" Sarcastic, frustrated, and frequently drunk, he agrees to coach a Little League team that includes players of various abilities (one is in a wheelchair, another is overweight, another short and puny, etc.) and backgrounds (""I got the damn League of Nations here,"" he grumps).Nostalgic for a time when little kids uttering obscenities was considered hilarious mischief, BAD NEWS BEARS is surprisingly unimaginative, given director Richard Linklater's previous displays of ingenuity, including School of Rock, Waking Life, and of course, Slacker. (Sadly, the film's standout aspect is editing: scene to scene, it's spectacularly incoherent.) Basic plot: mean coach turns nice, and team comes to believe in itself.As Buttermaker squares off against the rival team's coach, a bully named Bullock (Greg Kinnear), he also comes to respect his own team, as much for their oddities as for their spirit. He also sleeps with one player's mom (Marcia Gay Harden), makes the kids work for him exterminating rats and bugs, trots out a midget for no apparent reason (except, it seems, the Bad Santa writers, who scripted this film, like this particular ""joke"").Though Buttermaker advises his players to lie to their parents when the team is losing (""Lie your ass off, tell 'em what they wanna hear""), everyone's happy when the team begins winning, this after Buttermaker recruits a great pitcher, his ex's daughter, Amanda (Sammi Kane Kraft, a real life Little League pitcher) and a great hitter, long-haired, just-out-of-juvie skater boi Kelly (Jeffrey Davies), who has a crush on Amanda. Kraft (who is quite good) and Thornton develop something like a charming rhythm, but for the most part, the film feels sloppy, riding on the lingering appeal of the original.Families who enjoy this movie might seek out the 1976 original Bad News Bears (though its sans-Matthau sequels are less worthy), School of Rock (Jack Black coaches misfit musicians), Friday Night Lights (Thornton coaches high school football), Hard Ball (Keanu Reeve coaches urban Little League), and the annoying Kicking & Screaming (Will Ferrell coaches soccer). Older viewers might like The Upside of Anger, where Kevin Costner plays a similarly sulky but less annoying ex-ball player.",2,Scatological remake of a not-so-pure movie in the first place.,1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,2593,"['lackluster', 'remake', 'much-loved', '1976', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'new', 'table', 'Retired', 'minor', 'league', 'pitcher', 'Morris', 'Buttermaker', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'played', '2/3', 'inning', 'majors', 'time', 'long', 'ago', 'far', 'away', 'describes', 'current', 'situation', 'so', 'make', 'living', 'killing', 'rats', 'so', 'can', 'pay', 'rent', 'trailer', 'Sarcastic', 'frustrated', 'frequently', 'drunk', 'coach', 'Little', 'League', 'team', 'players', 'various', 'abilities', 'one', 'wheelchair', 'overweight', 'short', 'puny', 'etc', 'got', 'damn', 'League', 'Nations', 'here', '.Nostalgic', 'time', 'when', 'little', 'kids', 'uttering', 'obscenities', 'was', 'considered', 'hilarious', 'mischief', 'BAD', 'NEWS', 'BEARS', 'surprisingly', 'unimaginative', 'given', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'previous', 'displays', 'ingenuity', 'including', 'School', 'Rock', 'Waking', 'Life', 'course', 'Slacker', 'Sadly', 'film', 'standout', 'aspect', 'editing', 'scene', 'scene', 'spectacularly', 'incoherent', 'Basic', 'plot', 'mean', 'coach', 'nice', 'team', 'believe', 'itself.As', 'Buttermaker', 'off', 'rival', 'team', 'coach', 'bully', 'named', 'Bullock', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'also', 'respect', 'own', 'team', 'much', 'oddities', 'spirit', 'also', 'one', 'player', 'mom', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'kids', 'work', 'exterminating', 'rats', 'bugs', 'trots', 'out', 'midget', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'writers', 'who', 'scripted', 'film', 'particular', 'joke', 'Buttermaker', 'players', 'lie', 'parents', 'when', 'team', 'losing', 'Lie', 'ass', 'off', 'tell', 'what', 'wan', 'na', 'hear', 'everyone', 'happy', 'when', 'team', 'winning', 'Buttermaker', 'great', 'pitcher', 'ex', 'daughter', 'Amanda', 'Sammi', 'Kane', 'Kraft', 'real', 'life', 'Little', 'League', 'pitcher', 'great', 'hitter', 'long-haired', 'just-out-of-juvie', 'skater', 'boi', 'Kelly', 'Jeffrey', 'Davies', 'who', 'crush', 'Amanda', 'Kraft', 'who', 'quite', 'good', 'Thornton', 'develop', 'something', 'charming', 'rhythm', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'feels', 'sloppy', 'riding', 'lingering', 'appeal', 'original.Families', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'might', 'seek', 'out', '1976', 'original', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'sans-Matthau', 'sequels', 'are', 'less', 'worthy', 'School', 'Rock', 'Jack', 'Black', 'misfit', 'musicians', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Thornton', 'coaches', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'Hard', 'Ball', 'Keanu', 'Reeve', 'coaches', 'urban', 'Little', 'League', 'annoying', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'coaches', 'soccer', 'Older', 'viewers', 'might', 'like', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'similarly', 'sulky', 'less', 'annoying', 'ex-ball', 'player']",N/A

This man, in addition to being an incredibly intense actor, shows himself to be a screen comedian on par with the best of our time.

Despite the fact that The Bad News Bears (2005) is essentially a kiddie movie, even more so than Bad Santa, Thornton's relentlessly dark delivery keeps you coming back for more.

There was no need for a remake; the fact that this movie was made anyhow is a tribute to the lack of creativity and aversion to risk taking in Hollywood. That said, the remake is entertaining, and had it been an original film I would have rated it four rather than three stars.The primary reason to see the new Bad News Bears is actor Billy Bob Thornton. He is the logical successor to Walter Matthau's mantle. Thornton owns the character of Coach Buttermaker - a lewd, gruff drunk with no socially redeeming traits who still manages to exude a sleazy charm. Had he created this role rather than just expertly imitated it, it would have been pure genius, and as it is, it stands as a homage to the original.Oddly, the remake manages to be simultaneously both raunchier and more politically correct than the original. Where the original film had Buttermaker getting endorsements from a bail bondsman on the kid's uniforms, the remake has the endorsement of a strip club, complete with dancers coming to the games as a rooting section for the team. Yet in the climatic scene of the aftermath of the championship game, where the original film had Buttermaker giving all the kids beers, in the remake he simply hands out near-beer, robbing the scene of all of its edginess and power with its unwillingness to take the risks of the original.The kids in the movie were well cast and did a nice job of recreating the original roles. Here once again, this movie has the feel of a homage. The only innovation was to make the ethnic mix of the team more diverse.This movie is a must see for all Billy Bob Thornton fans - his performance here will not disappoint them. And though this remake can never replace the original, it is entertaining and stays fairly true to the intent and feel of the film that it is imitating.

940763,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BDGVYK,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Whether or not you love this new 'Bad News Bears' (without 'The,' following recent trend') depends strictly on your experience of watching the original.  In short, if you have seen Walter Matthau's 1976 film, in which one retired baseball player Morris Buttermaker accepts the job of coaching a hopeless team in the Little League, you have virtually seen the remake.  Want to see something new added to the original?  But what can we add anyway, to the original?Well, but if you're talking about delightful Bill Bob Thornton's grizzled baseball coach Buttermaker, he is well worth watching.  His character is virtually the same, except some minor points.  New Buttermaker loves not only drinking; he loves women too, including Marcia Gay Harden, who plays the single mother of one of the kids.  I admit that this womanizer image is certainly what Billy Bob is better at playing than Walter Matthau.  But still I miss Walter and his slouching.OK, I should stop comparing two films, but how can I?  Anyway, good news is the kids doing the Bears players are all excellent.  Another good news is that the remake didn't change the bad languages they use, probably one of the best part of Bill Lancaster's script of the original.  As to the rival team's coach, who represents the spirit of 'winning is everything' (whom Vic Morrow played convincingly in the original), Greg Kinnear does a good support as he did in another remake 'Sabrina.'  Perhaps they knew the comparison is inevitable because songs from Bizet's Carmen, which was used effectively in 1976 version, can be heard again, differnently arranged.So you don't expect the originality of hilarious 'School of Rock' for no matter how it tries, this remake always reminds us of the original -- IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT.

I laughed, not aloud- but often and even had blurted out some giggles aloud which I usually can contain unless something is really funny.  I like the Hooters part of the movie, when the kids are brought there to celebrate a victory.  The scene ends with the background song in the restaurant still playing the initial song the scene opened with and the group of Billy Bob Thornton, the kids on the team and a handful of in uniform Hooters waitresses all clinging cheers with their beverages to victory and finishing the final verse of the last chorus of Eric Claptons song ""Cocaine"" in unison.  ""She dont like.....COCAINE!""  It fit the deadpan persona of heavy drinking coach (Thornton) and the misfits that filled the roster in a twisted classic way....I dont know, just watch the movie if you have yet to do so.  Its refreshing and different from most the types of stuff I end up watching, and can be compared to the ""School of Rock"" movie in ways, which had the kids with a deadbeat adult underachiever together and they ultimately come through together in the end giving the adult character some respect in each film.",5,Great remake of the 1970's series.,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1200,"['Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'was', 'fantastic', 'found', 'amused', 'film', 'laughed', 'not', 'aloud-', 'often', 'even', 'had', 'blurted', 'out', 'giggles', 'aloud', 'usually', 'can', 'contain', 'something', 'really', 'funny', 'Hooters', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'brought', 'there', 'celebrate', 'victory', 'scene', 'background', 'song', 'restaurant', 'still', 'playing', 'initial', 'song', 'scene', 'opened', 'group', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'kids', 'team', 'handful', 'uniform', 'Hooters', 'clinging', 'cheers', 'beverages', 'victory', 'finishing', 'final', 'verse', 'last', 'chorus', 'Eric', 'Claptons', 'song', 'Cocaine', 'unison', '..COCAINE', 'fit', 'deadpan', 'persona', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'coach', 'Thornton', 'misfits', 'filled', 'roster', 'twisted', 'classic', 'way', '.I', 'dont', 'know', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'yet', 'do', 'so', 'refreshing', 'different', 'most', 'types', 'stuff', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'School', 'Rock', 'movie', 'ways', 'had', 'kids', 'deadbeat', 'adult', 'together', 'ultimately', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'giving', 'adult', 'character', 'respect', 'film']",N/A

A good story needs to be told more than once. It's a waste otherwise. The movies represent our myths. We've seen two remakes and two sequels to ""King Kong"" and ""Dracula"" has been adapted many, many times (badly for the most part I might add) so why not the comedy about the team of baseball misfits who could? Billy Bob Thornton takes on the role that Walter Matthau essayed in the original 1976 film. The social misfits angle has been updated with kids that behave worse and have their own social stigmas. They still kick butt. Alcoholic pest worker Morris Buttermaker (Thornton) briefly played in the ""big game"" before washing out and using booze as his crutch. He's recruited to coach a kids baseball team that play so badly that they could be beat by a tree in the wind.Michael Ritiche's (""Smile"", ""The Bad News Bears"", ""Downhill Racer"", ""The Candidate"")original is a five star classic that would be difficult to beat. Luckily this remake doesn't try to beat it--instead Linklater (""Dazed and Confused"", ""Before Sunset"", ""The School of Rock"", ""A Scanner Darkly"")just tries to update it for a new audience. His efforts deserve 3 1/2 stars. It ain't perfect but it's a whole lot of fun. Here's the good news-this film like the original is just as nasty, funny and outrageous in its own way. There was probably the temptation to make this into a PC Disney movie. Luckily the writers and director Richard Linklater resisted temptation and made a film that both pays homage to the original film and retell the story for a new audience.""Bears"" hits a home run on DVD with an very good transfer. Detail is exceptionally good and color rich with accurate flesh tones.  The color and detail are remarkably good. The 5.1 catches every ground ball that the cast hit.""At Bat with The Bears"" features Linklater, Billy Bob Thornton  discussing his attraction to doing a remake something that he has avoided. Thornton mentions that the big attraction for him was taking on a role so strongly associated with Matthau. ""Scouting for the Big Leagues"" focuses on the casting sessions and includes bits and pieces of the audition tapes done by the kid actors. Linklater felt that finding actors that could both play the roles and project distinctive personalities was the biggest casting challenge. The other challenge according to Linklater was finding an actress that could play the role convincingly of Amanda Whurlitzer and someone who could actually throw the ball well. The ""outtakes"" don't amount to much and aren't all that memorable. The ""Video Baseball Cards"" is a clever way to give us a bit of background on the actors in the main roles.The commentary by director Linklater and writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa provides an entertaining glimpse behind-the-scenes. The challenge of translating a classic film without losing the flavor of the original for a contemporary audience is discussed. Ficarra and Requa are depreciating about  their efforts crediting Bill Lancaster with writing the perfect comedy (he did). Sadly, Lancaster is no longer around to hear his efforts praised (or to see this fine remake) as he died in 1997 having written only a handful of movies including John Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"".Remakes are always a questionable affair. Luckily Linklater and his collaborators have fashioned one that manages to be unique, funny and yet also stands up pretty well when compared to the original. Not insulting the original is an art by itself and ""Bad News Bears"" (what happened to ""The""? Hollywood is becoming increasingly illiterate) manages to be entertaining and worthwhile without diminishing the terrific original film directed by Michael Richtie.",4,Entertaining remake of Michael Ritche/Walter Matthau classic,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,3764,"['Remakes', 'good', 'bad', 'dog', 'entertainment', 'existence', 'Why', 'good', 'story', 'needs', 'be', 'retold', 'good', 'story', 'needs', 'be', 'told', 'more', 'once', 'waste', 'otherwise', 'movies', 'represent', 'myths', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'remakes', 'two', 'sequels', 'King', 'Kong', 'Dracula', 'been', 'adapted', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'badly', 'most', 'part', 'might', 'add', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'comedy', 'team', 'baseball', 'misfits', 'who', 'could', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'role', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'essayed', 'original', '1976', 'film', 'social', 'misfits', 'angle', 'been', 'updated', 'kids', 'behave', 'worse', 'have', 'own', 'social', 'stigmas', 'still', 'kick', 'butt', 'Alcoholic', 'pest', 'worker', 'Morris', 'Buttermaker', 'Thornton', 'briefly', 'played', 'big', 'game', 'washing', 'out', 'using', 'booze', 'crutch', 'recruited', 'coach', 'kids', 'baseball', 'team', 'play', 'so', 'badly', 'could', 'be', 'beat', 'tree', 'wind.Michael', 'Ritiche', 'Smile', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'Downhill', 'Racer', 'Candidate', 'original', 'five', 'star', 'classic', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'beat', 'Luckily', 'remake', ""n't"", 'try', 'beat', 'instead', 'Linklater', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'Sunset', 'School', 'Rock', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'just', 'update', 'new', 'audience', 'efforts', 'deserve', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'ai', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'Here', 'good', 'news-this', 'film', 'original', 'just', 'nasty', 'funny', 'outrageous', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'probably', 'temptation', 'make', 'PC', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Luckily', 'writers', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'resisted', 'temptation', 'made', 'film', 'pays', 'homage', 'original', 'film', 'retell', 'story', 'new', 'audience', 'Bears', 'home', 'run', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'transfer', 'Detail', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'color', 'rich', 'accurate', 'flesh', 'tones', 'color', 'detail', 'are', 'remarkably', 'good', '5.1', 'catches', 'ground', 'ball', 'cast', 'hit', 'Bat', 'Bears', 'Linklater', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'discussing', 'attraction', 'doing', 'remake', 'something', 'avoided', 'Thornton', 'mentions', 'big', 'attraction', 'was', 'taking', 'role', 'so', 'strongly', 'associated', 'Matthau', 'Scouting', 'Big', 'Leagues', 'casting', 'sessions', 'bits', 'pieces', 'audition', 'tapes', 'done', 'kid', 'actors', 'Linklater', 'felt', 'finding', 'actors', 'could', 'play', 'roles', 'project', 'distinctive', 'personalities', 'was', 'biggest', 'casting', 'challenge', 'other', 'challenge', 'according', 'Linklater', 'was', 'finding', 'actress', 'could', 'play', 'role', 'convincingly', 'Amanda', 'Whurlitzer', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'actually', 'throw', 'ball', 'well', 'outtakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'are', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'Video', 'Baseball', 'Cards', 'clever', 'way', 'give', 'bit', 'background', 'actors', 'main', 'roles.The', 'commentary', 'director', 'Linklater', 'writers', 'Glenn', 'Ficarra', 'John', 'Requa', 'entertaining', 'glimpse', 'behind-the-scenes', 'challenge', 'translating', 'classic', 'film', 'losing', 'flavor', 'original', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'discussed', 'Ficarra', 'Requa', 'are', 'depreciating', 'efforts', 'crediting', 'Bill', 'Lancaster', 'writing', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'did', 'Sadly', 'Lancaster', 'no', 'longer', 'around', 'hear', 'efforts', 'praised', 'see', 'fine', 'remake', 'died', '1997', 'having', 'written', 'only', 'handful', 'movies', 'including', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'remake', 'Thing', '.Remakes', 'are', 'always', 'questionable', 'affair', 'Luckily', 'Linklater', 'collaborators', 'have', 'fashioned', 'one', 'be', 'unique', 'funny', 'yet', 'also', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'when', 'compared', 'original', 'Not', 'insulting', 'original', 'art', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'what', 'happened', 'Hollywood', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'illiterate', 'be', 'entertaining', 'worthwhile', 'diminishing', 'terrific', 'original', 'film', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Richtie']",N/A
