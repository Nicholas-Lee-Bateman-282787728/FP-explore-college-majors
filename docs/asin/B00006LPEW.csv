The Amazon Quartet are some of the most interesting villians in the Sailor Moon series since they embody innocence and cruelty often at the same time.  Each episode is about someone with her dream symbolized by a dream mirror.  It is interesting that when the character has her dream mirror knocked out of her, the character becomes lifeless.  I suppose that is what happens when someone's dream is lost, the person is still alive but yet lifeless since all passions are knocked out of her.Incidentally, the Japanese voice actress that played Sailor Moon also voiced Agent Excel in the Excel Saga.",5,Amazon Quartet !,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,674,"['Six', 'Amazon', 'Quartet', 'nemesis', 'Sailor', 'Soldiers', 'Amazon', 'Quartet', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'villians', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'series', 'embody', 'innocence', 'cruelty', 'often', 'same', 'time', 'episode', 'someone', 'dream', 'symbolized', 'dream', 'mirror', 'interesting', 'when', 'character', 'dream', 'mirror', 'knocked', 'character', 'lifeless', 'suppose', 'what', 'when', 'someone', 'dream', 'lost', 'person', 'still', 'alive', 'yet', 'lifeless', 'passions', 'are', 'knocked', 'her.Incidentally', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actress', 'played', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'also', 'voiced', 'Agent', 'Excel', 'Excel', 'Saga']",N/A

I received this, as well as Sailor Moon SuperS Pegasus Collections 1, 2, and 3 for Christmas of 2002.I had high expectations for the series at first, but those high expectations suddenly turned to low ones.This has to be the worst Sailor Moon season by far.It is completely boring and focuses mainly on Chibiusa and Pegasus.If you want to watch a good Sailor Moon season, watch either the first season (Sailor Moon) or the third (S).",1,"Cute, but that's all",1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,531,"['am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'utterly', 'disappointed', 'when', 'got', 'received', 'as', 'well', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'SuperS', 'Pegasus', 'Collections', '1', '2', '3', 'Christmas', '2002.I', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'series', 'first', 'high', 'expectations', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'low', 'ones.This', 'be', 'worst', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'season', 'far.It', 'completely', 'boring', 'mainly', 'Chibiusa', 'Pegasus.If', 'want', 'watch', 'good', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'season', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'third', 'S']",N/A

720598,A20JS9ESUZWU9Y,B00006LPEW,Ren Culpepper,"[0, 0]","Sailor Moon is a really good anime series, no matter what language you see it in.You'll probably notice that a lot of people have griped about how horrible it is when it's been dubbed into English, but they're just angry because it's rather different than the Japanese version (of COURSE it's different; certain things wouldn't translate well into other cultures).  I, personally, like both versions of it.  I like the Japanese version because it's interesting to see anime in its original state, and I like the English version because not only is it also really good (the writing and voice acting is really clever much of the time), but it's also easier for me to relate to.On this DVD set, the Sailor Scouts are forced to repeatedly face off with the Amazon Quartet (Vesves, Junjun, Cerecere and Pallapalla) who are searching for Pegasus at the request (or rather the demand) of Zirconia, the short-tempered subordinate of Queen Nehelenia, who is trapped in a mirror and wants Pegasus's Golden Crystal so she can (1) escape from the mirror and (2) take over the universe (predictably).Fortunately, Serena and Rini, with the help of the other Sailor Scouts and Tuxedo Mask, manage to vanquish them whenever they meet.Of the six episodes on this DVD, my personal favorites are the one where Pallapalla opens a dentist office, and the one where Rini's schoolfriend Hiroki attempts to make some kind of homemade plane.In conclusion, this DVD is really good, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for younger children because it is ""uncut"".  In other words, they left in everything parents might find objectionable.  I, personally, didn't see anything too objectionable, but someone else might.",5,"Really Good, Despite What The Purists Say",1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,1693,"['Sailor', 'Moon', 'really', 'good', 'anime', 'series', 'matter', 'what', 'language', 'see', 'in.You', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'notice', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'griped', 'how', 'horrible', 'when', 'been', 'dubbed', 'English', ""'re"", 'just', 'angry', 'rather', 'different', 'Japanese', 'version', 'COURSE', 'different', 'certain', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'other', 'cultures', 'personally', 'versions', 'like', 'Japanese', 'version', 'interesting', 'see', 'anime', 'original', 'state', 'like', 'English', 'version', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'writing', 'voice', 'acting', 'really', 'clever', 'much', 'time', 'also', 'easier', 'relate', 'to.On', 'DVD', 'set', 'Sailor', 'Scouts', 'are', 'forced', 'repeatedly', 'face', 'off', 'Amazon', 'Quartet', 'Vesves', 'Junjun', 'Cerecere', 'Pallapalla', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'Pegasus', 'request', 'rather', 'demand', 'Zirconia', 'short-tempered', 'subordinate', 'Queen', 'Nehelenia', 'who', 'trapped', 'mirror', 'Pegasus', 'Golden', 'Crystal', 'can', '1', 'escape', 'mirror', '2', 'take', 'universe', 'predictably', '.Fortunately', 'Serena', 'Rini', 'help', 'other', 'Sailor', 'Scouts', 'Tuxedo', 'Mask', 'manage', 'vanquish', 'whenever', 'meet.Of', 'six', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'one', 'where', 'Pallapalla', 'dentist', 'office', 'one', 'where', 'Rini', 'schoolfriend', 'Hiroki', 'make', 'kind', 'homemade', 'plane.In', 'conclusion', 'DVD', 'really', 'good', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'recommend', 'younger', 'children', 'uncut', 'other', 'words', 'left', 'everything', 'parents', 'might', 'find', 'objectionable', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'too', 'objectionable', 'someone', 'else', 'might']",N/A
