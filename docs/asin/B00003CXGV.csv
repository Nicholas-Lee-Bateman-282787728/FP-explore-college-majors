Jackson is Marine Colonel Terry Childers and Tommy Lee Jones is the lawyer who must defend him. The movie begins in some nameless jungle in Vietnam where Childers and Jones are soldiers fighting Charlie. A huge gun battle ensues and Jones's group is massacred. But Childers convinces the VC leader to call off the attack by killing his radio operator. Then we are taken to the present day, to San'aa, Yemen, where Childers is forced to get the ambassador out. His marines are being shot at, he thinks by the crowd, and so he orders his marines to open fire. They do, and so begins his difficult legal battle. It is not &quot;A Few Good Men,&quot; Rob Reiner's spactacular military courtroom drama, but it is a good, interesting look at the military's justice system, and it keeps you riveted.

And Jones is second by becoming Jackson's lawyer after Jackson is accused of murdering 83 Yemenese civilians.  It is an emotional roller coaster of a movie with a tremendous musical score to enhance the drama.  The action scenes of the movie are done with great effects.

Let's start by saying any movie with Tommy Lee Jones ad Samuel L Jackson is one that I will like, both are among my favorite actors. Our two lead characters fought together during Viet Nam and experienced extreme action. Moving forward in time Jackson's character is still active in the Marines and is picked to do an embassy extraction in the middle east. His mission encounters heavy automatic weapon fire as they touch-down in the embassy compound. Extracting the Ambassador and his family, fire become heavier killing and wounding several Marines. Jackson eventually orders his troops to return fire killing over 80 people outside of the embassy. The key question was, were these people armed and firing upon the embassy? If so, they were combatants; if not they were civilians. The movie shifts to a legal and courtmarshall drama. Jackson asks his old friend Jones to be his attorney.A very well made movie.

This tough time together cemented their friendship, indebted Tommy Lee Jones' character to Samuel Jackson's but also brought in question, the type of soldier Samuel Jackson's character was.Years later, upon Tommy Lee Jones' character's retirement, he once again sees his old friend.  You see that Samuel Jackson's character has gone on to more wartime heroism and Tommy Lee Jones' character is retiring as an service (Marines) attorney.Events develop shortly after his friends retirement, where Samuel Jackson is called in to rescue an ambassador holed up in an embassy in Yemen.  The protests have gotten ugly and there is concern for the ambassador and his family's welfare.Events during this rescue unfold that result in significant casualties among the locals and Samuel Jackson is held personally responsible for this.Telling you why and any details around that would ruin the story for you.However, in his need for legal representation, Samuel Jackson's character calls on his retired friend in Tommy Lee Jones' character.  Jones' character is concerned that his skill as a lawyer will not be sufficient for his old friend's problem.  Lucky for his old friend Tommy Lee Jones' character overprepares himself.The investigation and the details are pretty interesting.  Some commentaries on allowable force in a war or skirmish are made.  Depending on your viewpoint, you may agree or dissagree.When I started watching this movie, I was not aware that it was based on a true story. I still have not seen this stated explicitly.  However in the ending they stated the status of the various parties involved, so I drew this conclusion.This movie was not all splash and dash.  Which lets face it, if it is based on reality, this is appropriate.  Some conclusions seemed like leaps of logic.  We did not see the build up that got you there.

As a former alcoholic (he seems to be dissolute in many films), and by his own admission, inept lawyer, he is asked by a friend to represent him in an upcoming court martial.  He replies  ""I'm a good enough lawyer to know that you need a better lawyer than me.""  But he takes the case.The movie events are timely ... terrorism in Yemen, court martial. Samuel L. Jackson as the accused Col. Terry Childers, is excellent, as is the prosecuting attorney.  The trial itself is my favorite part.  Tommy Lee as Col. Hayes Hodges belies his claim to be a poor lawyer by turning in a quite credible performance.There are some inconsistencies in the script (how come none of the Marines saw the crowd below firing at them when they fired back? .... their testimony would have cleared Childers immediately.)  But the best part of the movie consists in the heart-felt and lasting friendship between Hayes and Terry.  And the most touching is when, after the trial as Childers leaves the courtroom, he sees a North Vietnamese officer who testified against  him.  The officer, who he has not seen since the Vietnam War, salutes him, and he salutes back, acknowledging that the war is over and that they both respect each other as soldiers.This is by no means a perfect film. but its strengths outnumber its weaknesses.",5,Tommy Lee Rules!,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1389,"['especially', 'admire', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'work', 'not', 'disappoint', 'film', 'former', 'alcoholic', 'be', 'dissolute', 'many', 'films', 'own', 'admission', 'inept', 'lawyer', 'asked', 'friend', 'represent', 'upcoming', 'court', 'martial', ""'m"", 'good', 'enough', 'lawyer', 'know', 'need', 'better', 'lawyer', 'case.The', 'movie', 'events', 'are', 'timely', 'terrorism', 'Yemen', 'court', 'martial', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'accused', 'Col.', 'Terry', 'Childers', 'excellent', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'trial', 'favorite', 'part', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Col.', 'Hayes', 'Hodges', 'claim', 'be', 'poor', 'lawyer', 'turning', 'quite', 'credible', 'performance.There', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'script', 'how', 'come', 'none', 'Marines', 'saw', 'crowd', 'firing', 'when', 'fired', 'back', 'testimony', 'would', 'have', 'cleared', 'Childers', 'immediately', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'heart-felt', 'lasting', 'friendship', 'Hayes', 'Terry', 'most', 'touching', 'when', 'trial', 'Childers', 'courtroom', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'officer', 'who', 'testified', 'officer', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'back', 'acknowledging', 'war', 'respect', 'other', 'soldiers.This', 'perfect', 'film', 'strengths', 'outnumber', 'weaknesses']",N/A

But saying that  would be too harsh. Sure, this is predictable. I think everyone who watches  this will know in their hearts that really this is a very average film.  Still, it has a certain bravado and entertainment factor to it which makes  it irresistable.Basic plot: Samuel L. Jackson orders his marines to  start firing upon a bunch of civilians in Yemen. He is charged with murder  and Tommy Lee Jones must defend him. While &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;  sees Samuel L. Jackson shouting his guts out in every third scene and  attempts to gloss things over with a big question of military integrity,  the whole movie rests upon one question: Did Samuel L. Jackson fire upon  innocent people or were they armed? The marketing slogan that they have  come up for this crap is unbelievable, &quot;should a hero ever have to  stand alone?&quot; Throughout the film we are bombarded with questions of  ethics when in actuality it is a very simple question played out to full  dramatic effect. It turns out Samuel L. Jackson had every right to shoot at  those people because they DID have machine guns. That is the whole movie  summed up nicely in a paragraph.Tommy Lee Jones is really good as is  Samuel L. Jackson. Their characters are an absolute joke and it's more of a  pleasure trying to watch them fumble around with such weak material. A  pleasure none the less.Who am I to complain about violence in the  movies? I'm not going to take it seriously so as far as I'm concerned  &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; does relieve a good days stress when the  massacre occurs. The violence is so gruesome that many will be repelled. It  doesn't bother me so the slaying of many inncoent people was also very  redeeming.Ultimately &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; is just another big  Hollywood joke that we all know is terrible but will still entertain us  anyway.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[0, 1]","The framework in which this story is centered around is quite compelling: an American embassy in a 3rd world country is being besieged by an angry and volatile anti-American mob.  A security detail from a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) is called in to defuse the situation.  From that point onward, utter chaos breaks out.In this day &amp; age the scene of the mob is sure to be quite gripping to any American viewer.  This is especially the case given the fact that we've had several embassies overseas bombed in the past 10-20 years.  Ever since 9/11 it has been exceedingly difficult to have a whole lot of sympathy for anti-American mobs, regardless of where they are.While the film examines nicely some of the ethical intricacies of combat, the major flaw is that there is a rather large hole in the plot that even the least clever moviegoers will be able to point out.  As the rest of the movie is pretty good, the best thing to do is to try and overlook this unfortunate inconsistency.Another facet that strikes close to home is the cover-up attempts of the State Department.  Not only is this plausible, but it is downright realistic.  Few people with morals work for the State Department and the history of the department is filled with cloak-and-daggar silliness.In all, this is an entertaining movie that compels one to think.  It would have been a great movie, if not for the hole in the plot.

524566,A2IRYEO9UQ8AC5,B00003CXGV,"Eric Franklin ""mrefranklin""","[3, 7]","Friedkin really tried to make this movie feel legitimate. When you build an interesting idea up from a shaky plot and even more unlikely story, however, you're bound to end up with some sort of mishap. That's exactly what happens here.I wanted to believe the things I saw. I watched eagerly as the characters played by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson were established in the jungles of Vietnam. I liked it. Dare I say, it felt real.Unfortunately, what transpires afterwards is a load of hogwash. The basic premise involves Samuel Jackson, a military colonel, being dropped into what had been a peaceful demonstration outside the US embassy in Yemen. His mission is to protect the embassy, and if necessary, to evacuate the ambassador and his family. Since the demonstration gets out of control, the ambassador evacuates and leaves Samuel there with his marines. At this point, the movie takes some care to &quot;not&quot; show you what really goes on, so that there will be this lingering question in your mind as to whether or not Samuel Jackson's character is guilty of the murder of a group of unarmed demonstrators.This is the first sticky point of the movie. We are misled with everybody else into not knowing what to think about the occurrence. How are we supposed to feel compassion for a guy that we just saw murder all of these people? Regardless of any vindication that may come later, it's hard to feel good about what we see on the screen. The rest of the movie involves Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel's old Vietnam buddy trying to exonerate him from murder charges we aren't sure if he committed. Trust me, it sounds more intriguing than it really is.This whole scenario is made even more murky by a tainted National Security Administrator that causes the surviving video (which we find out would totally clear Samuel Jackson of the charges) to be &quot;lost.&quot;The ending is lackluster melodrama that, for me, was totally unbelievable. Worth a rental but not enough to own. This could of been a great movie contrasting the combat-experienced men of Vietnam with modern day &quot;Peacekeepers,&quot; but as it is, it relies on cheap sentimentality to make its impact.

Jackson.  It is an interesting premise in today's world where the lines between politics and warfare become ever fuzzier.  Is a commander justified to engage an enemy to protect his men if there is a high probability of killing innocents?  With increasing frequency, radical groups use human shields to capitalize on this Western dilemma.  This film brought some of these issues to the fore, and though sloppily done in parts, it was an entertaining treatment of the issue.Director William Friedkin (The French Connection) is no stranger to action flicks, and the action scenes were extraordinarily realistic.  The trial was also well done from a dramatic standpoint, but some glaring flaws went unexplained.  For instance, are we to believe that with all the firing that occurred from the ground, forensics experts couldn't find a single bullet hole with a ground-based trajectory?By far the best aspect of this film was the acting.  Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding as the shot-up marine who turned into a second rate lawyer to stay in the service.  Samuel L. Jackson continued to prove himself one of the better dramatic actors around with a stellar performance of the dedicated career officer thrown into an impossible situation and then fed to the wolves.  Guy Pearce also gave a fine performance as the prosecutor for the government, although he tried to hide his British accent by putting on a New York accent and it sounded phony.Though unoriginal (see &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;), this is a very watchable drama with some credibility problems, but the flaws were more than overcome by the great acting.  I rated it a 7/10.

Jackson), in a military story. O.K., so far, so good. Though this movie technically was well-done, it fell far short of glory, besides the fact that these two proven Hollywood winners were in it.Jackson plays career Marine Terry Childers, who is sent to Yemen on a mission to extricate the U.S. ambassador and his family, who apparently have suffered the ire of the local Muslin populace (for what, it is not apparently known. All we really DO know is that Islamic Jihad handed out cassette tapes of the usual kill-the-American-dogs line, and the people went ape-excrement). Childers succeeds in completing his mission, but finds that he and his Marine detachment are getting pounded by enemy fire on the surrounding rooftops, as well as on the ground. Childers orders his men to fire on the crowd, killing many young people. He finds himself facing court-martial in the States, on the grounds that the people he fired upon had no weapons. Thus begins a manhunt on Childers by the State Department, undoubtedly worried about a Lebanon-like situation.Enter Jones as Hayes Hodges, a soon-to-retire career Marine. Like his Vietnam-era comrade, Childers, Hayes had seen what life was like in the trenches. However, Hodges was not as successful in combat as his beleaguered friend, so instead opted for life as a military defense attorney. Childers puts his future career in the hands of his longtime Marine friend, believing that since Hodges knew what combat conditions were like, he would be the ideal person to defend him. Hodges, though, feels that he can't compete against hot-shot prosecutor Biggs (Guy Pearce), who's been hired by the Secretary of State, Bill Sokal (Bruce Greenwood).Much of the film deals with the court-martial. Unfortunately, everything that would have made this a great film wasn't there; things like suspense, retribution, or a slam-dunk ending were just, well, missing in action. The end of the film is so anti-climactic, it makes one wonder what the fuss was all about. Even the usually solid performances by Jones and Jackson aren't enough to redeem the lack of spirit in the last 20 minutes of the film.If you like films with great military court scenes, check out &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, or better yet, &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;; they did them first, and certainly did them better.

Jackson, but then again who isnt? These two powerhouse performers team up for one good movie.Jackson plays Terry Childers who is a 30 year combat veteran colonel in the Marine Corps. Childers is sent into Yemen to rescue an Ambassador (Ben Kingsley) and his family. The mission gets quite hairy and terrorists and civilians both are caught in the firestorm to follow.  The incident in seen as an embarassment  at best and a political nightmare at worst by the folks in Washington and Childers is put on military trial for murder.  He asks his old buddy Hayes Hodges (Jones) to defend him. Hodges also happens to owe Childers his life from events in Vietnam.The movie has the outcome you might expect and along the way we are introduced to a not so hidden conspiracy to frame Childers for the crime. What separates this usual plot from other films is the outstanding acting of Jackson and Jones.  Jones takes center stage and wows you as a former combat Marine turned military lawyer who struggles to search for his own identity and questions his value as a Marine along the way. Jackson as always delivers a rock solid and emotional performance.The direction of this movie is particularly note worthy. It does an admirable job with addressing the modern military dilemna of fighting unseen enemies in urban environments. The director holds some things from you so that you will find yourself questioning the acts of the Marines involved in the shooting. Only at the end does he give you everything you need to know. This makes the movie better than most.Overall it is great and the only thing that keeps it from being a five star flick is that Jackson's character, although central to the plot, had to take a backseat to Tommy Lee Jones performance. I thought the nature of the film would have benefited from more scenes surrounding how Childers was dealing with the consequences of his actions. Still, it is a movie worth adding to your collection.

This film tackles this problem under the light of a potential miscarriage of military justice in the US. It all revolves around one piece of evidence, a video tape, that was destroyed but had been duly listed on some invoice slip. The court does not require this piece of evidence but the jury seems to have taken it into account to refuse to convict the accused of the crime the politicians of the State Department and the leadership of the Marines would like him to be convicted of. Unluckily the film is cryptic about this element that seems to be supported by some written messages at the end of the film showing the national security advisor who destroyed the tape was gotten rid of. But the film does not make this piece of information the center of the plot, though it deserves to be. But yet the film is quite clear about how a miscarriage of military justice is built and planned to cover the failings and shortcomings and drawbacks of other personnel like diplomatic staff or ambassadors or counselors or advisors of any type. You have to destroy a piece of evidence, then you have to pressurize the officers who have authority in the case, and then you make some people lie, bluntly lie, and there you are. It's ugly, frightening and disgusting and yet it happens all the time. In this film to cover up the political mess the soldier has to be convicted of a crime he did not commit, in some other cases it can be the reverse, to be absolved of a crime he did commit on orders but those orders have to be covered up for political reasons. Politics is the worst human invention ever and it is too often the cause of the worst crimes imaginable. And war is generally the result of the impotence of politicians, their incapability to solve problems without violence. And soldiers have always been pawns on the political chessboard. They better be willing to die on the altar of politics if they enter this career. But at times there might be salvation and success for one victim of such events, though it will be the exception that will prove the rule unescapable : soldiers are the natural scapegoats and fuses of politicians.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,To be a soldier is to be a slave of politicians,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,2269,"['personal', 'responsibility', 'soldier', 'rank', 'country', 'military', 'action', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'problem', 'light', 'potential', 'miscarriage', 'military', 'justice', 'US', 'around', 'one', 'piece', 'evidence', 'video', 'tape', 'was', 'destroyed', 'had', 'been', 'duly', 'listed', 'invoice', 'slip', 'court', 'not', 'require', 'piece', 'evidence', 'jury', 'have', 'taken', 'account', 'refuse', 'convict', 'accused', 'crime', 'politicians', 'State', 'Department', 'leadership', 'Marines', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'convicted', 'film', 'cryptic', 'element', 'be', 'supported', 'written', 'messages', 'end', 'film', 'showing', 'national', 'security', 'advisor', 'who', 'destroyed', 'tape', 'was', 'gotten', 'rid', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'piece', 'information', 'center', 'plot', 'be', 'yet', 'film', 'quite', 'clear', 'how', 'miscarriage', 'military', 'justice', 'built', 'planned', 'cover', 'failings', 'shortcomings', 'drawbacks', 'other', 'personnel', 'diplomatic', 'staff', 'ambassadors', 'counselors', 'advisors', 'type', 'have', 'destroy', 'piece', 'evidence', 'then', 'have', 'pressurize', 'officers', 'who', 'have', 'authority', 'case', 'then', 'make', 'people', 'lie', 'bluntly', 'there', 'are', 'ugly', 'frightening', 'disgusting', 'yet', 'time', 'film', 'cover', 'up', 'political', 'mess', 'soldier', 'be', 'convicted', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'other', 'cases', 'can', 'be', 'reverse', 'be', 'absolved', 'crime', 'did', 'commit', 'orders', 'orders', 'have', 'be', 'covered', 'up', 'political', 'reasons', 'Politics', 'worst', 'human', 'invention', 'ever', 'too', 'often', 'cause', 'worst', 'crimes', 'imaginable', 'war', 'generally', 'result', 'impotence', 'politicians', 'incapability', 'solve', 'problems', 'violence', 'soldiers', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'pawns', 'political', 'chessboard', 'better', 'be', 'willing', 'die', 'altar', 'politics', 'enter', 'career', 'times', 'might', 'be', 'salvation', 'success', 'one', 'victim', 'such', 'events', 'will', 'be', 'exception', 'will', 'prove', 'rule', 'unescapable', 'soldiers', 'are', 'natural', 'scapegoats', 'fuses', 'politicians.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

When dire actions occur under tinderbox cirmcumstances, the President has a public relations nightmare and needs a scape goat.  The scape goat gets his retired buddy to reluctantly come out off retirement to defend him.While I found this movie to be entertaining, I don't know that I'll watch it again except to discuss it with my 15 year old son in order to get his take on some of the issues covered in the movie. The issues of patriotism, defending those who depend on you, doing the right thing and how to get out of things that are over your head, are important issues that are addressed in this movie, they're just not addressed that well.It doesn't take an avid JAG viewer (not that I am one nor am I an attorney) to realize that if the movie shows you what happened and why, but there is no corroborating evidence and there are prosecution witnesses who are lying, then you discredit the &quot;bad guys'&quot; testimony. This should have been of prime benefit to the defense, but doesn't happen here.This movie reminds me of a theme I find in many other movies as well as books. The management characters only care about their careers and are willing to step on the backs of the hump characters to whom they owe unpaid gratitude for the efforts that management takes credit for. Cynical yes, accurate, probably, overdone definitely. It's an unfair world, let's get over it and produce works that shed more understanding on those characteristics in the human condition and human spirit from which we can benefit. I see no reason to constantly remind ourselves how unfair life can be.The acting was quite good given the lack of depth the actual characters are forced to portray in this movie. The actions of all the bad guys are predictable and so are those of the good guys.The burning question, on which the justification for the accused's actions hang, is whether or not there was gunfire from the crowd on the street. It seems to me analysis of the bullet holes in the soft masonry walls of the embassy would indicate trajectory and therefore prove or disprove the accused's claims. If you stick your finger in a bullet hole in the wall and your finger is pointing up at an angle not horizontally, and there are a substantial number of those holes, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to solve that mystery. A second question is why the ambassador was not required to prove he was the one to remove the American flag when he evacuated the embassy as he said he did.The ending was anticlimatic and therefore a let down and the epilogue on the screen explaining the fate of the bad guys seemed more like a lame afterthought than it was helpful. Had it been a true story, I might have been interested, as it was just pleasant fiction, I could care less.

Jackson are excellent as usual in their roles:  two old friends from Vietnam whose careers took different courses  after a firefight that badly injured Jones.  Jackson's Marines rescue a  cowardly ambassador and his family from an embassy pelted with rocks,  insults and the occasional sniper's bullet.  In return for this service,  the ambassador will testify that Jackson lost control and opened fire on a  crowd full of unarmed civilians, because his superior at the Department of  State thinks he should to save the American reputation in the Middle  East.The basic story is good and the actors have amazing presence, but  there are a number of amusing inconsistencies in the script, like:1)  Dale Dye, as Samuel L. Jackson's commanding officer, asks him whether he  wants private counsel or the base legal office to represent him (if you  watch this in a theater full of military personnel, expect this line to be  among the funniest in the film).  This occurs right in the middle of him  briefing the man whose court-martial he will convene, which happens  absolutely never.2) Why didn't anyone analyze the bullet holes in the  embassy wall to establish trajectory?3) How the hell do you find a  Vietnamese company captain from an action that occurred thirty years ago  with no sort of attention at any previous time?  (This probably makes no  sense to you if you haven't seen it, and it really won't in the film,  except to make the point that even officers on opposing sides have the  common trait of valuing their troops' lives more than anything else on the  field of battle.)The conflict between functions of state and defense  isn't as implausible as the reviewers appear to think, particularly in a  time when we deploy our soldiers and Marines to the world's least desirable  corners as beat cops.

Jackson's character couldn't have violated the rules of engagement. The opening scene sets his attitude pretty well when he blatantly kills a Viet Cong prisoner to encourage the enemy commander to call off his unit which is killing everyone in Tommy Lee Jones's platoon. While the plot is different, the atmosphere of old, beat-down, used-up has-beens reminds me of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. The problem lies in the ending.I think it could have been a good movie, but it lacked a key ingredient. I lost that suspension of disbelief that makes it necessary to enjoy the movie. I will illustrate this point next, but beware...SPOILER AHEAD...When the old Viet Cong commander who stopped the attack on Tommy Lee Jones's platoon shows up in the court room to testify, I was stricken with how unlikely that would be. When he testified that Samuel L. Jackson murdered his radio operator to force him to call off the attack, I figured it was a done deal. Regardless of all the emotion brought forth by Tommy Lee Jones's defense, which sounded good, but didn't change the facts, the whole time I'm watching this I'm thinking ""guilty, guilty, guilty."" I was sure they weren't going to convict the main character, I was just wondering how he was going to get out of it. The ultimate defense was Tommy Lee Jones asking the Viet Cong commander if he would have done the same if that had been his friend's platoon being killed. Of course, the guy says ""yes."" So the viewer is supposed to believe that makes it ok? Since when did the American military hold the values of the Viet Cong up to such high admiration that they condoned flat-out murder, point-blank, in the head, to an unarmed prisoner?

Oscar winning director William Friedkin gives us an opening scene in Vietnam which is disturbing in its violence and intensity.  And then he takes us to Yemen, where a supposedly peaceful demonstration gets out of hand and over 80 ""innocent"" women and children are slaughtered, the order given by decorated Colonel Terry Childers.  As the viewers can attest, the demonstration is far from peaceful and Childers' decision utilizing the rules of engagement is a logical, if tragic, one.  What makes the movie such a powerful entity is the magnificent performances of Samuel L. Jackson (probably one of his best performances) as Childers and gruff Tommy Lee Jones as the lawyer who defends him against the murder charges.  Both actors seize their roles with a marked intensity and are fascinating to watch as they embody their characters with the valor, doubt, and fierce belief in themselves.  Guy Pearce (Memento, Count of Monte Cristo) is excellent as Biggs, the soldier who serves as the prosecutor.  The rest of the supporting cast is good too:  Bruce Greenwood, Philip Baker Hall, Ben Kingsley, Anne Archer and Nicky Katt.  I would think it would be hard to decide what to do in a case like this, and seeing how duplicitous and deceitful the government is once again portrayed, it would be hard call.

That is called ""command influence"" and is a big no-no. The combat scenes are excellent and even the courtroom scenes are good. The improbability of finding the right NVA colonel 30 years later to testify in a US court martial is secondary to the dramatic effect. Both Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones are terrific and two of my favorites.The movie was made before 9/11 but is more honest about Islamic violence than anything made since.

524599,A2887J6P8VPB5H,B00003CXGV,Nichomachus,"[3, 7]","Perhaps once upon a time there was a script that dealt seriously with the issues of morality and warfare in the ambiguous post-modern warfare of ""low-intensity"" conflict. That's my hope. The resulting RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, however, takes every good element it has and obscures it behind trite dramatics and sad appeals to the successful devices of past ""legal"" films. It's pretty obvious that a couple of bufoon film executives were given an all too free ride in the finalization of the screenplay.The two combat scenes are excellent: Vietnam in the 1960s; and Yemen in the 1990s. Reviewers who know what they're talking about have commented on all that, but I'll just say they are the high points of the film. The two battle scenes do a remarkable job of relaying the stress and confusion of the American characters under fire.The rest of the film, however, is utterly useless. Why? Because of the potential that was squandered. A FEW GOOD MEN, which is uncomfortably aped by this movie, was successful in presenting ambiguous moral questions about the use of power in the military, and its relationship to the free society the military protects. RULES OF ENGAGEMENT had the potential to provoke those kinds of questions, but the weaknesses overwhelm it.Two Marines who fought together in Vietnam are reunited in the 1990s. A public relations disaster and coverup erupts when US Marines protecting and evacuating the embassy in Yemen begin to take casualties. The one Marine (Sam Jackson) is the commander of the force evacuating the embassy. He orders his troops to fire into the crowd, killing scores of Yemenis. The other Marine (Tommy Lee J.) is a washed up ex-drunk with a knack for losing cases, and ends up defending the Sam in a shockingly anti-climactic court martial. Sam, you see, has been hung out to dry by the Goviment, and the drying out Tommy can't get over the fact he's not as cool as his Marine dad.Bravado, sanctimony, and hyperbole flow freely, but we've seen all that before. Frankly, I don't think there's an actor today who can portray an avenging lawyer as well as Michael Moriarty on old LAW & ORDER reruns. You can guess the outcome unless you've been living in a bomb shelter for a couple of decades. These children of Perry Mason can do no wrong, for God is on their side, etcetera, etcetera.What could have gone right?1) The civilian sleazeball villain could have been scaled back. It was perfect at first: the man was acting on his political instincts of the interests of the United States and the security of Americans everywhere. He outlines all of the alternative options available to Sam instead of blowing away the protestors. The viewer starts to think, ""Well geez, maybe he's kinda right."" This ambiguity is so important in trying to figure out these very real issues in the real world. But then it is all layed on so thick that the viewer is not left with any choice about who the bad guy is when the character is played as grotesquely as possible.2) The chaos and confusion of events at the embassy. This was all very interesting; the breakdown in communication, the stress, etc. What overshadowed this, however, was the utter stupidity of a US Ambassador actually having his family with him in such an obviously hostile post.3) The vanity and near hysteria of Sam Jackson's character was often chilling. We are initially left with severely mixed feelings as we watch the court martial plot unfold. However, they decided to give you a flashback to make you feel alright about having him your hero. Again, this removes the ambiguity.4) Tommy Lee's defense case was pretty sappy. Apart from an okay, sob-story closing argument, it is perplexing to see why the verdict was so magnaminous. In reality, with the range of choices available to the commander at the time, he should have been nailed to the wall by the jury. One Marine death came from the crowd; the rest from the more deadly sniper fire. Did the commander then not have a greater obligation to suppress the sniper fire? Doing so would probably have caused the crowd to scatter anyway, and all of the women and children would not have died.5) A decent lawyer with even half the story could have nailed the Ambassador for perjury right there on the stand. The helicopters were taking fire as they were landing, there were dozens of American witnesses about the danger of the situation. Tommy Lee could have skewered him for blatantly lying.6) Since when does mail to the State Department go to the National Security Adviser? The unrealistic chain of command undermines the screenplay even more.7) Colonel Sam and the Vietnamese commander saluting each other. This was the most poignant part of the film. It was the ultimate challenge to the viewer: honor, dignity, and common understanding was based on a mutual recognition of the moral insanity and absurdity of the violence. The nature of moral responsibility is that much more confusing.This should have ended the movie, with lots of open questions left about what really happened, and about what values really mattered in judging these events. Instead, the appeal to the banal was made, with a bunch of silly text messages assuring the viewer that all the hitherto unaccountable badguys were indeed busted. Why? It was totally disatisfying; the point of such a resolution is that the audience participates in it. It's silly to think some text paragraphs overlaying marching soldiers lets us feel justice was done. Had they left it open ended, they might have been able to salvage this movie as one provoking serious questions about the nature of bad policies and bad decisions in the inconclusive world of post-modern combat.",2,Creampuff casper milquetoast,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,5676,"['Perhaps', 'once', 'time', 'was', 'script', 'dealt', 'seriously', 'issues', 'morality', 'warfare', 'ambiguous',

524608,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CXGV,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Rules of Engagement (William Friedkin, 2000)[originally posted 8May2000]Two bad Samuel L. Jackson movies in one year? Say it ain't so, Jim! But the sad truth is, yep. On the heels of allowing himself to be cast in Star Wars: Episode I, Jackson finds himself in this muddled mess of a Friedkin. You know, one wonders what drives Friedkin these days, and how someone whose career started with such promising work as The Birthday Party, The French Connection, and The Exorcist took such a left turn so quickly, leaving us with stuff like Blue Chips, Jade, and Rules of Engagement.And Jackson isn't the only one who lent his name to this muddled mess, though he's the actor I'm most surprised to find in a bad film. Tommy Lee Jones, Ben Kingsley, Dale Dye, and Blair Underwood all find themselves in here, wandering aimlessly through a plot with more holes in it than the facade of the building in question, but they've all been in truly awful things before.The quick and easy plot summary is this: Jackson is a marine colonel who saved Jones' life when both were in Vietnam. Jones got shot up and took a desk job as a not-too-good lawyer, while Jackson stayed in the field. Jackson is sent to evacuate the ambassador to Yemen and protect the embassy, and while doing so, Jackson and his men are attacked, from the time they're still in the air until the time Jackson orders his men to open fire on the crowd. And they do, killing eighty-three people. The Yemeni government is up in arms (pardon the pun) over this, and Jackson is hauled in front of a military tribunal as a scapegoat. He hires Jones to defend him, and away we go.If you want to make a good Vietnam war film, you go to the best. You get Jim Webb to write the script. Webb's good, right? He wrote the definitive Vietnam War novel, Fields of Fire. Then you get a technical adviser who happens to double as an actor whose name, in Hollywood, is synonymous with Vietnam--Dale Dye. Whip up a few upper-middle-age actors, and transport the whole thing to the year 2000.Whoops. Rules of Engagement is not a Vietnam War film, despite that fact that a decent chunk of its screen time takes place there. And maybe that's where this thing goes horribly wrong. Well, that, and the incredible number of clich&eacute;s in the script. Let's see. We need a scene where Jones and Jackson beat each other to a pulp and end up laughing about it. We need a scene where a whole bunch of people get shot up in Vietnam. We need a slimy government official who is the embodiment of pure evil. We need a young, gung-ho prosecutor who will make a name for himself with this case (Guy Pearce, last seen as the male lead in Ravenous, who is nastily effective here). And so on, and so on. You name it, it's in here. How much predictability do you want?Okay, despite all this, there ARE some good things to be said. There's a chemistry between Jones and Jackson. Jackson's usual comic timing comes through, despite the script (you get the feeling he ad-libbed a lot). Pearce and the evil government official (Bruce Greenwood, who hasn't played a good guy since FOX's late and very much lamented series Nowhere Man) are very, very good at making you hate them. And at a time when American feeling towards the government and our military and its involvement overseas is either horribly wrong or right but for all the wrong reasons, it can be argued that a film like this was in desperate need of being made. It's too bad that what came out of it was such a cliche-ridden, goopy, insubstantial mess. Many reviewers have compared it to A Few Good Men, one of whom went so far as to say Rules of Engagement is ""the same movie. Not similar, the same."" Would that it were so. After this, Jack Nicholson's scene-chewing and Tom Cruise's incompetence look positively masterful. * ",2,"You Can't Handle the Script, Part 2",1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,3804,"['Rules', 'Engagement', 'William', 'Friedkin', '2000', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '8May2000', ']', 'Two', 'bad', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'movies', 'one', 'year', 'Say', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'Jim', 'sad', 'truth', 'yep', 'heels', 'allowing', 'be', 'cast', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'Jackson', 'muddled', 'mess', 'Friedkin', 'know', 'one', 'Friedkin', 'days', 'how', 'someone', 'career', 'started', 'such', 'promising', 'work', 'Birthday', 'Party', 'French', 'Connection', 'Exorcist', 'took', 'left', 'turn', 'so', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'stuff', 'Blue', 'Chips', 'Jade', 'Rules', 'Engagement.And', 'Jackson', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'name', 'muddled', 'mess', 'actor', ""'m"", 'most', 'surprised', 'find', 'bad', 'film', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'find', 'here', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'plot', 'more', 'holes', 'facade', 'building', 'question', ""'ve"", 'been', 'truly', 'awful', 'things', 'before.The', 'quick', 'easy', 'plot', 'summary', 'Jackson', 'marine', 'colonel', 'who', 'saved', 'Jones', 'life', 'when', 'were', 'Vietnam', 'Jones', 'got', 'shot', 'up', 'took', 'desk', 'job', 'not-too-good', 'lawyer', 'Jackson', 'stayed', 'field', 'Jackson', 'sent', 'evacuate', 'ambassador', 'Yemen', 'protect', 'embassy', 'doing', 'so', 'Jackson', 'men', 'are', 'attacked', 'time', ""'re"", 'still', 'air', 'time', 'Jackson', 'orders', 'men', 'open', 'fire', 'crowd', 'do', 'killing', 'eighty-three', 'people', 'Yemeni', 'government', 'up', 'arms', 'pardon', 'pun', 'Jackson', 'hauled', 'front', 'military', 'tribunal', 'scapegoat', 'Jones', 'defend', 'away', 'go.If', 'want', 'make', 'good', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'film', 'go', 'best', 'get', 'Jim', 'Webb', 'write', 'script', 'Webb', 'good', 'right', 'wrote', 'definitive', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'novel', 'Fields', 'Fire', 'Then', 'get', 'technical', 'adviser', 'who', 'double', 'actor', 'name', 'Hollywood', 'synonymous', 'Vietnam', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'Whip', 'up', 'few', 'upper-middle-age', 'actors', 'transport', 'whole', 'thing', 'year', '2000.Whoops', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'not', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'fact', 'decent', 'chunk', 'screen', 'time', 'place', 'there', 'maybe', 'where', 'thing', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Well', 'incredible', 'number', 'clich', 'eacute', 'script', 'Let', 'see', 'need', 'scene', 'where', 'Jones', 'Jackson', 'beat', 'other', 'pulp', 'end', 'up', 'laughing', 'need', 'scene', 'where', 'whole', 'bunch', 'people', 'get', 'shot', 'up', 'Vietnam', 'need', 'slimy', 'government', 'official', 'who', 'embodiment', 'pure', 'evil', 'need', 'young', 'gung-ho', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'name', 'case', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'last', 'seen', 'male', 'lead', 'Ravenous', 'who', 'nastily', 'effective', 'here', 'so', 'so', 'name', 'here', 'How', 'much', 'predictability', 'do', 'want', 'Okay', 'ARE', 'good', 'things', 'be', 'said', 'chemistry', 'Jones', 'Jackson', 'Jackson', 'usual', 'comic', 'timing', 'script', 'get', 'feeling', 'ad-libbed', 'lot', 'Pearce', 'evil', 'government', 'official', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'who', ""n't"", 'played', 'good', 'guy', 'FOX', 'late', 'very', 'much', 'lamented', 'series', 'Nowhere', 'Man', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'hate', 'time', 'when', 'American', 'feeling', 'government', 'military', 'involvement', 'overseas', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'right', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'film', 'was', 'desperate', 'need', 'being', 'made', 'too', 'bad', 'what', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'such', 'cliche-ridden', 'goopy', 'insubstantial', 'mess', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'compared', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'one', 'whom', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'same', 'movie', 'Not', 'similar', 'same', 'Would', 'were', 'so', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'scene-chewing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'incompetence', 'look', 'positively', 'masterful', '*']",N/A
524609,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B00003CXGV,Roger J. Buffington,"[8, 10]","This is a powerful movie that closely examines the problem faced by every trial lawyer: how do you bring the reality of what really happened into a courtroom.  Facts appear different in court.  And of course often one side does everything it can, and more than it should, to distort ""objective truth"" to the extent that it exists.  That is what this movie is about.The movie deals with a combat marine (Samuel L. Jackson) who rescues the staff of the besieged American embassy in Yemen.  Things get ugly and people die.  Was he a trigger-happy war criminal, or was he doing his duty in a damnable situation?  That is the question that the movie examines.  Tommy Lee Jones is very good as the defense attorney, and Jackson does his customary excellent job.The premise is unfortunately very believable.  There are many technical defects in the court-martial that will offend any trial lawyers watching the movie (during opening and closing Jones makes many personal references to himself and his personal knowledge of the defendant, for example).  But put these defects aside.  The real issue here is how to bring reality into the courtroom in the face of a determined attempt by the government to deceive and obfuscate.The DVD is of very high quality, both audio and video.  It is a pleasure to watch.I am not a huge Tommy Lee Jones fan, but he was pretty darned good in this movie.  Samuel L. Jackson is very authentic and reminds us that there are tough, good soldiers and marines out there putting their lives on the line to protect us.  Recommended without reservation.

524610,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXGV,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","***1/2  Had William Friedken's `Rules of Engagement' had the courage to travel down a different route, it might have emerged as a great film rather than merely the good one it turns out to be. Credit this big budget action film with at least attempting to address a morally complex issue in a morally complex way. That the film doesn't succeed completely is probably due to the restraints imposed on it by both studio and box office considerations.The film poses a number of long-debated military questions: when used in the context of an endeavor like war - whose primary aim is to take away the lives of one's enemy - is the term &quot;rules of engagement&quot; itself an untenable paradox? Does it even makes sense to have &quot;rules&quot; when it comes to war? And can there be such a thing as an `innocent victim' killed in the heat of battle? And can a commander who orders the deaths of such people in a wartime situation be convicted of `murder'?Samuel L. Jackson stars as Colonel Terry Childers, a decorated Vietnam War hero who suddenly finds himself on trial for court martial for ordering his men to open fire on an allegedly unarmed group of Islamic protesters demonstrating outside the United States embassy in Yemen. Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as Hays Hodges, the man whom Childers saved in a battle in Vietnam who now, as a self-described mediocre lawyer, has the chance to pay back his buddy by clearing his name in court. `Rules of Engagement' raises a number of fascinating issues, but I contend that the film would have been even more interesting than it is (and it IS interesting) if it had left the audience in doubt as to Childers' innocence or guilt. Instead, we know from the beginning that Childers' version of the events in question is the accurate one, which robs the film of the kind of gripping human drama that can be achieved only through an examination of the ambiguities that make up human motives and actions. This means that we know who the heroes and villains are right away. There is even a tell-all video of the event to be secreted and ultimately destroyed by an unctuous government official. Thus, we end up with yet another David vs. Goliath story, yet another soldier-at-the-mercy-of-the-U.S.-military-industrial-complex scenario, when what we really crave is something more challenging, more ambiguous, more morally complex.These elements are what keep `Rules of Engagement' from being an extraordinary achievement. Yet, there are many positive aspects of the film as well. For one thing, it avoids the temptation to become a xenophobic, flag-waving pro-American/anti-Islamic diatribe. It certainly doesn't shy away from portraying the tragic toll inflicted by the shooting on the protestors present. In addition, it allows its two male leads to display honest emotions like regret, confusion and self-doubt. They are even permitted to cry from time to time. In a way, both actors have been cast a bit against type, since neither is portraying the self-assured, almost cocky brand of hero he is usually called on to play.Most important is that, despite the feeling of compromise, the film does raise some fascinating moral issues that too few major films even bother to consider. If this review comes across as more negative than it should, it is merely because the potential for greatness is always regrettable when it is not achieved. Nevertheless, `Rules of Engagement' deserves to be seen and admired for what did make it to the screen. For all its imperfections, this really is a very good film.",3,flawed but interesting effort,986688000,"04 8, 2001",2001,3543,"['***1/2', 'Had', 'William', 'Friedken', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'had', 'courage', 'travel', 'down', 'different', 'route', 'might', 'have', 'emerged', 'great', 'film', 'rather', 'merely', 'good', 'one', 'out', 'be', 'Credit', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'film', 'least', 'attempting', 'address', 'morally', 'complex', 'issue', 'morally', 'complex', 'way', 'film', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'completely', 'probably', 'due', 'restraints', 'imposed', 'studio', 'box', 'office', 'considerations.The', 'film', 'number', 'long-debated', 'military', 'questions', 'when', 'used', 'context', 'endeavor', 'war', 'primary', 'aim', 'take', 'away', 'lives', 'one', 'enemy', 'term', 'quot', 'rules', 'engagement', 'quot', 'untenable', 'paradox', 'even', 'sense', 'have', 'quot', 'rules', 'quot', 'when', 'war', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'such', 'thing', 'innocent', 'victim', 'killed', 'heat', 'battle', 'can', 'commander', 'who', 'orders', 'deaths', 'such', 'people', 'wartime', 'situation', 'be', 'convicted', 'murder', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Colonel', 'Terry', 'Childers', 'decorated', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'hero', 'who', 'suddenly', 'trial', 'court', 'martial', 'ordering', 'men', 'open', 'fire', 'allegedly', 'unarmed', 'group', 'Islamic', 'protesters', 'demonstrating', 'United', 'States', 'embassy', 'Yemen', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'co-stars', 'Hays', 'Hodges', 'man', 'whom', 'Childers', 'saved', 'battle', 'Vietnam', 'who', 'now', 'self-described', 'mediocre', 'lawyer', 'chance', 'pay', 'back', 'buddy', 'clearing', 'name', 'court', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'number', 'fascinating', 'issues', 'contend', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'IS', 'interesting', 'had', 'left', 'audience', 'doubt', 'Childers', 'innocence', 'guilt', 'Instead', 'know', 'beginning', 'Childers', 'version', 'events', 'question', 'accurate', 'one', 'robs', 'film', 'kind', 'gripping', 'human', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'only', 'examination', 'ambiguities', 'make', 'up', 'human', 'motives', 'actions', 'know', 'who', 'heroes', 'villains', 'are', 'right', 'away', 'even', 'tell-all', 'video', 'event', 'be', 'secreted', 'ultimately', 'destroyed', 'unctuous', 'government', 'official', 'Thus', 'end', 'up', 'yet', 'David', 'vs.', 'Goliath', 'story', 'yet', 'soldier-at-the-mercy-of-the-U.S.-military-industrial-complex', 'scenario', 'when', 'what', 'really', 'crave', 'something', 'more', 'challenging', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'more', 'morally', 'complex.These', 'elements', 'are', 'what', 'keep', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'being', 'extraordinary', 'achievement', 'are', 'many', 'positive', 'aspects', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'thing', 'temptation', 'become', 'xenophobic', 'flag-waving', 'pro-American/anti-Islamic', 'diatribe', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'portraying', 'tragic', 'toll', 'inflicted', 'shooting', 'protestors', 'present', 'addition', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'display', 'honest', 'emotions', 'regret', 'confusion', 'self-doubt', 'are', 'even', 'permitted', 'cry', 'time', 'time', 'way', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'bit', 'type', 'portraying', 'self-assured', 'almost', 'cocky', 'brand', 'hero', 'usually', 'called', 'play.Most', 'important', 'feeling', 'compromise', 'film', 'raise', 'fascinating', 'moral', 'issues', 'too', 'few', 'major', 'films', 'even', 'bother', 'consider', 'review', 'more', 'negative', 'should', 'merely', 'potential', 'greatness', 'always', 'regrettable', 'when', 'not', 'achieved', 'Nevertheless', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'deserves', 'be', 'seen', 'admired', 'what', 'did', 'make', 'screen', 'imperfections', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'film']",N/A

524614,A2AN988COWP49T,B00003CXGV,Shiragami Hiromi,"[1, 3]","The International Law of War on Land says about qualification of belligerents: ""Article 1: The laws, rights, and duties of war apply not only to armies, but also to militia and volunteer corps fulfilling the following conditions: 1.To be commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; 2.To have a fixed distinctive emblem recognisable at a distance; 3.To carry arms openly; and 4.To conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.""""In countries where militia or volunteer corps constitute the army, or form part of it, they are included under the demonstration `army'.""""Article 2: The inhabitants of a territory which has not been occupied, who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading troops without having had time to organize themselves in accordance with Article 1, shall be regarded as belligerents if they carry arms openly and if they respect the laws and customs of war.""In this film, the key issue is the lawfulness of the Yemeni ""civilians"" who were in the ""peaceful demonstration"" at the American Embassy in civilian clothes (1), and hiding deadly weapons (3), then attacked the U.S. Marine corps with armed forces killing a few marines before they started to fire back (4).Colonel Childers' action was eventually justified by the Marshal Law, as his lawfulness was tested according to the Rules of Engagement, but, in my opinion as an amateur, International law also tells you that the Yemeni civilians' action was illegal as you can see in the abovementioned Article 1 because those Yemeni civilians were not legally categorised as belligerents and their action was not a ""spontaneous"" resistance, either.I am well aware of that some people would want to make an argument against this view, but, I must be clear that I am not a sympathiser of the U.S. globalisation / dominance over the world with invincible armed forces, yet, at the same time, I strongly believe in the necessity of compromise through the truly objective International Law between Western Powers who have enormous military power and countries that are categorised as ""the third world"" where people can only rely on ""terrorism"" and guerrilla warfare to resist the dominance of the Western Powers over their own countries.No one can ever emotionally justify the horrific mass-killing Childers' decision caused as the director Friedkin says. And the fact that the terrorists of Arab world have to use even their own women and children as human shield and, in this instance, attackers, is truly tragic. However, if you allow your sentiment to cloud your judgment on this Childers case and distort the truth (in this case, the fact that Childers' action is legal by the Marshal Law and the International Law) to call Childers ""murderer"", it would have an ultra-left/anarchist connotation. I do not believe such view would solve the problem of the power balance in the military world.I know that the International Law is mostly being manipulated by the arbitrariness of the Western Powers, namely, the U.S.A. So, I am not saying at all that the current situation is perfectly alright and all terrorism deserves total elimination which would facilitate the U.S. dominance of the whole world. Still, I think both side of this conflict - globalisation and terrorism - should stick to the International Law as mutual compromise, although it definitely needs decent reconsideration in the light of fair treatment for the ""non-powers"".",5,True Meaning of the International Law,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,3479,"['International', 'Law', 'War', 'Land', 'qualification', 'belligerents', '1', 'laws', 'rights', 'duties', 'war', 'apply', 'not', 'only', 'armies', 'also', 'militia', 'volunteer', 'corps', 'fulfilling', 'following', 'conditions', '1.To', 'be', 'commanded', 'person', 'responsible', 'subordinates', '2.To', 'have', 'fixed', 'distinctive', 'emblem', 'recognisable', 'distance', '3.To', 'carry', 'arms', 'openly', '4.To', 'conduct', 'operations', 'accordance', 'laws', 'customs', 'war', 'countries', 'where', 'militia', 'volunteer', 'corps', 'constitute', 'army', 'form', 'part', 'are', 'included', 'demonstration', 'army', 'Article', '2', 'inhabitants', 'territory', 'not', 'been', 'occupied', 'who', 'approach', 'enemy', 'spontaneously', 'take', 'up', 'arms', 'resist', 'invading', 'having', 'had', 'time', 'organize', 'accordance', 'Article', '1', 'shall', 'be', 'regarded', 'belligerents', 'carry', 'arms', 'openly', 'respect', 'laws', 'customs', 'war', 'film', 'key', 'issue', 'lawfulness', 'Yemeni', 'civilians', 'who', 'were', 'peaceful', 'demonstration', 'American', 'Embassy', 'civilian', 'clothes', '1', 'hiding', 'deadly', 'weapons', '3', 'then', 'attacked', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'corps', 'armed', 'forces', 'killing', 'few', 'marines', 'started', 'fire', 'back', '4', '.Colonel', 'Childers', 'action', 'was', 'eventually', 'justified', 'Marshal', 'Law', 'lawfulness', 'was', 'tested', 'according', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'opinion', 'amateur', 'International', 'law', 'also', 'Yemeni', 'civilians', 'action', 'was', 'illegal', 'can', 'see', 'abovementioned', 'Article', '1', 'Yemeni', 'civilians', 'were', 'not', 'legally', 'categorised', 'belligerents', 'action', 'was', 'not', 'spontaneous', 'resistance', 'either.I', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'make', 'argument', 'view', 'must', 'be', 'clear', 'am', 'not', 'sympathiser', 'U.S.', 'globalisation', '/', 'dominance', 'world', 'invincible', 'armed', 'forces', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'strongly', 'believe', 'necessity', 'compromise', 'truly', 'objective', 'International', 'Law', 'Western', 'Powers', 'who', 'have', 'enormous', 'military', 'power', 'countries', 'are', 'categorised', 'third', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'rely', 'terrorism', 'guerrilla', 'warfare', 'resist', 'dominance', 'Western', 'Powers', 'own', 'countries.No', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'emotionally', 'justify', 'horrific', 'mass-killing', 'Childers', 'decision', 'caused', 'director', 'Friedkin', 'fact', 'terrorists', 'Arab', 'world', 'have', 'use', 'even', 'own', 'women', 'children', 'human', 'shield', 'instance', 'attackers', 'truly', 'tragic', 'However', 'allow', 'sentiment', 'cloud', 'judgment', 'Childers', 'case', 'distort', 'truth', 'case', 'fact', 'Childers', 'action', 'legal', 'Marshal', 'Law', 'International', 'Law', 'call', 'Childers', 'murderer', 'would', 'have', 'ultra-left/anarchist', 'connotation', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'such', 'view', 'would', 'solve', 'problem', 'power', 'balance', 'military', 'world.I', 'know', 'International', 'Law', 'mostly', 'being', 'manipulated', 'arbitrariness', 'Western', 'Powers', 'namely', 'U.S.A', 'So', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'current', 'situation', 'perfectly', 'alright', 'terrorism', 'total', 'elimination', 'would', 'facilitate', 'U.S.', 'dominance', 'whole', 'world', 'Still', 'think', 'side', 'conflict', 'globalisation', 'terrorism', 'should', 'stick', 'International', 'Law', 'mutual', 'compromise', 'definitely', 'decent', 'reconsideration', 'light', 'fair', 'treatment', 'non-powers']",N/A

Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. A highly decorated Marine and Vietvet, Terry Childers (Jackson) is called upon to rescue the American ambassador and his family from Yemen, where the embassy building is surrounded by a crowd of angry anti-American demonstrators. Once the crowd turns hostile and opens fire on the rescue team, killing several Marines, Childers orders his men to fire back, annihilating a large number of civilian targets, including women, old men and children. The public outrage leads to a scandal and a court-marshal for Childers, who asks his old Vietnam buddy (Jones) now a mediocre lawyer and a recovering alcoholic, to take his case. What follows completely defies credibility, as a cover-up is masterminded by a top national security official, who is eager to use Childers as a scapegoat in order to preserve good U.S. relations with the Middle Eastern states. Even worse, the last reel is a total misfire.

RULES OF ENGAGEMENT casts in evil light the actions of a National Security Advisor who says in one breath that he's not going to have a coverup but then immediately reverses himself and confiscates evidence.  In so doing, he willfully condemns a highly decorated Marine to virtually certain imprisonment, and possibly death.  Why? If the Marine (Samuel L. Jackson) takes the fall as a rogue colonel, then the American government itself won't be seen as an enemy by the region.  Yet the seized evidence is a tape which clearly shows that Jackson was being fired on and that he had every right to return fire.  Surely, then, the release of this tape would not only free Jackson, but remove any diplomatic quandaries as well.  It's hard to imagine moderate Middle East countries like Egypt and Jordan, which this fictional NSA is worried about, getting angry with the US for defending itself.  And that's where the movie fails.  The premise is just wrong.More than that, details are weird, too.  Chain-of-command leaps to mind.  The NSA has no place in the diplomatic hierarchy.  Why he's seen as having some sway over the US Ambassador to Yemen is thus kinda strange.  Ambassadors obviously report to the Secretary of State.  Wouldn't this Ambassador have thought to check out the NSA's threats of retribution with his boss before perjuring himself?  And once he did that, wouldn't the red flags have gone up at State?  I mean, the whole cover-up is portrayed throughout the movie as an NSA-only job.  If the Ambassador goes to State to check it out, the Secretary would presumably have immediate problems with the NSA.  Beyond that, the Ambassador would've been debriefed long before he even saw the NSA, and he would've told the debriefing officer the pro-Sam Jackson story he initially told the NSA.  Because the NSA isn't in the State Department chain of command, I would personally think there was no way for this character to have exerted the kind of control over this situation depicted.As a result of these problems, the movie ends up wasting a lot of good stuff, including fine acting and competent direction.

524626,A2HE4RHOGMWDV8,B00003CXGV,Young Kim,"[2, 2]","The Rules of Engagement had the potential to be an excellent movie that is marred by a couple of bad script and direction decisions.  The acting by the two leads, Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones is dead on, and the combat action is feverish and brutal, as well as it should be.  The movie also raises very interesting questions, but fails to deliver in the end.The movie opens with a flashback to Vietnam, where we learn of the bond of brotherhood shared by these two Marines, and see them action.  Mr. Jackson, who plays Col. Childers, saves Mr. Jones' character, Col. Hodges, who is severely injured in combat and reduced to a desk job, becoming an undistinguished attorney for the Corps.  Childers, on the other hand, continues in a long and distinguished career, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel and assigned command of a Marine rapid deployment unit sent to the Middle East (Yemen).  There, they face a rioting mob in front of the US Embassy, and the situation quickly deteriorates from rock throwing to active gunfire and Molotov cocktails.  After evacuating key personnel from the embassy, Childers makes the tragic decision that results in his eventual court martial.  He orders his men to fire at the crowd in front of the embassy, thereby killing 83 men, women, and children, and injuring hundreds more.All this sets the stage to a courtroom drama that is filled with tension and anguish.  However, after the build-up of the first two thirds of the movie, the script and director make two key decisions that drains the movie of its emotional and moral dilemmas, thus stripping the movie of its message and purpose.The movie, as it starts out, shows Col. Childers as a determined and fiercely loyal and patriotic soldier, a man who takes decisive action and is unafraid to shed blood in order to save his soldiers' lives.  It is a credit to Mr. Jackson's acting that this unflinching, uncompromising soldier comes across as sympathetic and likable.  However, therein lies the problem.  After the Yemen massacre, the US Government wants to quickly resolve the matter to dispel any notion within the Arab nations that the US condoned the killing.  The deck is stacked against Childers from the beginning, with a sleazy National Security Advisor and a hot shot Marine attorney thrown against Childers and Hodges.  But since the movie takes the stance that Childers is the protagonist of the movie, it is unwilling to demonize him.  As a matter of fact, the crucial flaw of the movie is showing too much to the audience in order to exonerate him.  Unfortunately, the moviemakers also wanted to maintain the dilemmas they set up in the premise of their film.  This leaves for a dual-personality film that attempts to leave doubt in the minds of the character whereas the audience knows that there is none, and thus, the director, as he admits in his audio commentary, is forced to bootstrap a resolution to the film by throwing some text at the screen before the credits roll out.  Although he wanted doubt and ambiguity, the director is forced to provide the typical Hollywood ending, where the good guys ride victoriously into the sunset and the bad guys lose.I focused primarily on Mr. Jackson's character because he is the focus of the maelstrom all around him, but that is not meant as a denigration of Mr. Jones' acting.  In fact, he carries the heavier burden of playing a bitter, weaker man, who had all the potential to be as good a soldier as Childers, but denied it, as he puts it, by a flip of a coin.  By no means is Col. Hodges, as Mr. Jones plays him, defined by bitterness, but rather, he understands his shortcomings as being the result of the events that took place in Vietnam so many years ago.  Therefore, he finds redemption and vindication in trying to defend his life-long friend.Again, the acting is top notch by an excellent cast, which includes a couple of cameos by two very good actors who play the ambassador to Yemen and his wife.  The quality of the DVD is top notch, with vibrant details, clear visuals, and good use of 5.1 surround, especially in the combat scenes.  The DVD contains the above mentioned director's commentary as well as a brief making of featurette.  I don't recall whether it contains a trailer.In conclusion, this is a great film that is indeed hobbled by compromises in the script.  The acting by the leads is excellent, the questions the film raises are compelling and timely, but the answers are simply nothing more than Hollywood fluff.  The current way Hollywood makes movies is truly the greatest culprit in the film: the changes that are brought to bear on a movie because it did not test well, or because the hero must be a hero, no matter what the script demands.
