1453519,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B005C7SXMS,AIROLF,"[0, 1]","Submarine is the type of black comedy that takes you by surprise.The protagonist, Oliver, played by Craig Roberts from the Being Human spin-off webshow, is not a nice character, nor is he likeable, and yet, the audience continues to watch his progress throughout this film. to say that the protagonist learns something throughout the ideal is to attempt to apply the regular Hollywood formula onto this film. Such a superstition would be a mistake.This is a movie that doesn't predictably go where you'd expect, but that is not where it's funny bone lies. The humor in this film is that, like in life, one never knows where our paths may lead us.Due in part to the sensibility of Roberts, as well as the witty dialogue, this film leaves an impression on you.My favorite scene is when Oliver asks each of his parents who they are more likely to save in a fire - him or the other parent. The answer may surprise you. But what is more surprising is the kind of revelation that leads to about each character, their storyarc, and the viewer.Go ahead, I dare you to ask that question of your loved ones.

1453520,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B005C7SXMS,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 2]","This somewhat sweet, somewhat creepy coming of age movie is worth watching for its quirky humor and for the sincere acting of its young cast. It is set in South Wales in the mid-1980s. By way of local color, there are some nice shots of the seashore, the hills, the local junkyards and railway depots and deserted industrial plants.We meet Oliver, a somewhat thoughtful, somewhat geeky kid of around 15 anxious to avoid bullying, if necessary by joining in against even more vulnerable targets. His love interest is Jordana, a cute classmate with an independent streak. Both of them have problems at home.Oliver's parents are bizarre, each in their own way. His father seems to be in the grip of clinical depression; his mother is obviously frustrated and somewhat attracted by a creepy neighbor who practices a form of ""new age"" therapy to do with light. Both are hopelessly awkward and inept with their son.We learn later that Jordana's mother may die of a brain tumor, though when we meet her, she seems amazingly healthy. This is one aspect of the plot that totally fails to work.Oliver earns Jordana's respect when he submits to a beating for refusing to call her a ""massive slut"". But then he loses it by failing to show up at the hospital where her mother has just undergone surgery. The two break up -- and we watch Oliver try to go through the painful mournful process we all go through when our first love affair dies. At the same time, he makes increasingly desperate and ill-judged attempts to save his parents' marriage.In the end, all these matters are resolved and the characters walk off into the sunset.I quite enjoyed it, my wife did not. I think it's worth watching on an evening when there's nothing on the TV and when you can't stand yet another reality show.",3,"Coming of age in Wales, sweet and quirky",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1780,"['sweet', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'quirky', 'humor', 'sincere', 'acting', 'young', 'cast', 'set', 'South', 'Wales', 'mid-1980s', 'way', 'local', 'color', 'are', 'nice', 'shots', 'seashore', 'hills', 'local', 'junkyards', 'railway', 'depots', 'deserted', 'industrial', 'plants.We', 'meet', 'Oliver', 'somewhat', 'thoughtful', 'somewhat', 'geeky', 'kid', '15', 'anxious', 'avoid', 'bullying', 'necessary', 'joining', 'even', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'targets', 'love', 'interest', 'Jordana', 'cute', 'classmate', 'independent', 'streak', 'have', 'problems', 'home.Oliver', 'parents', 'are', 'bizarre', 'own', 'way', 'father', 'be', 'grip', 'clinical', 'depression', 'mother', 'obviously', 'frustrated', 'somewhat', 'attracted', 'creepy', 'neighbor', 'who', 'practices', 'form', 'new', 'age', 'therapy', 'do', 'light', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'awkward', 'inept', 'son.We', 'learn', 'later', 'Jordana', 'mother', 'may', 'die', 'brain', 'tumor', 'when', 'meet', 'amazingly', 'healthy', 'one', 'aspect', 'plot', 'totally', 'work.Oliver', 'earns', 'Jordana', 'respect', 'when', 'beating', 'refusing', 'call', 'massive', 'slut', 'then', 'failing', 'show', 'up', 'hospital', 'where', 'mother', 'just', 'undergone', 'surgery', 'two', 'break', 'up', 'watch', 'Oliver', 'try', 'go', 'painful', 'mournful', 'process', 'go', 'when', 'first', 'love', 'affair', 'dies', 'same', 'time', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'ill-judged', 'attempts', 'save', 'parents', 'marriage.In', 'end', 'matters', 'are', 'resolved', 'characters', 'walk', 'sunset.I', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'wife', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'evening', 'when', 'nothing', 'TV', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'yet', 'reality', 'show']",Submarine

1453522,AW85VDASDM8VU,B005C7SXMS,Amazon Customer,"[0, 2]","""My mother is worried I have mental problems. I found a book about teenage paranoid delusions during a routine search of my parents' bedroom.""There are quite a few teen-aged, quirky, personal movies out there.  They're usually pretty good.  They either resonate or they're funny or both.  The alphas of our species will probably have to be in a listless mood to enjoy them.  For us quirks, any time is a good time.  Rushmore (1998), Easy A (2010), Juno (2007), Starter for 10 (2006), The History Boys (2006), and, now, Submarine (2011).Oliver (Craig Roberts) is a little odd, but meeting his parents goes a long way to explain it.  Mom, Jill (Sally Hawkins), and Dad, Lloyd (Noah Taylor), are both pretty darn odd.  His girlfriend Jordanna (Yasmin Paige) is odd too.  Oliver is afraid that his mother is having an affair with total wanker, Graham (Paddy Considine), who's into mystic stuff that's so outlandish his mother's inclined to think there must be something to it.  Human relationships are complicated and Oliver does his best.  It isn't always good enough.  Poor Oliver.This movie is so good.  It's so funny.  It's so well put together.  It's a great way to spend an hour-forty.Great acting.  It's kind of one-dimensional for the character-almost all of the characters actually-but he's got that dimension down.  Roberts, who seems like a close cousin of Daniel Radcliffe, lays down his character and performs the voice over to perfection.  Everyone's motivation is pretty clear and understandable.  That doesn't sound like a glowing endorsement, but really, it's an aid to the script.It's a fantastic script.  I imagine that it's a fantastic book (by Joe Dunthorne).  Bravo to he and writer/director Richard Ayoade.  The comedy is of the awkward, honest kind.  It's not brutally awkward, but the kind of normal awkward that arises when there are no good responses to events. Very British awkward.  But it's-forgive me-full of heart.  I'm not sure how original it is-I mean, this is a teenager who has trouble understanding his relationship and that of his parents-but it is freshly prepared.Great visuals.  Most of the freshness comes from this quality.  The style is...quirky.  Have I gone over my ""quirk"" quota yet?  I hate to do that to you since it's such a non-expressive word.  I'll try something else.  It's filmed unconventionally, functionality is not the priority, colors are alternatively vivid and washed out, camera action is varied but never ""art house.""  Were those any better?  How about ""solid""?It's great finding/seeing these movies.  I couldn't say ""finding"" by itself because that would make it seem like I've done something other than heard of it and ran across it completely by accident on Netflix Instant (sweet!).  Still, it's like coming across a Wes Anderson-before they became too quirky to function (so by Wes Anderson, I mean Rushmore)-and totally giving in to its charms.  It didn't get me drunk and take advantage.There's a little ownership that goes with this kind of find.  It's mine and very few people share in it.  I share it with people and praise it lavishly.  It's almost like boasting.  ""Oh, you've got to see this, it's absolutely hilarious.""  You say that sometimes just to make sure everyone understands that you got the joke.  Or, in its analogous genres, have such great, high, powerful tastes in film or whatever.Like most tastes, I can't stand it in anyone other than myself.  The boasting is obvious and patronizing.  If I don't laugh because I don't think it's particularly funny, which is probably due to the fact you're not a professional comedian, and then you have the temerity to ask ""Get it?"" you don't know how close you come to annihilation.In self-defense, there are jokes where you are allowed to say ""Get it?""  These jokes include puns (difficult ones), very short (probably ironic) jokes, and the kind of jokes I like.  Whenever I relate a joke from Yes Minister (1980-84), I feel well within my rights to return your dumb glazed look with a ""Get it?""However, because I am in the fraternity, you need only pause and allow me to catch up.  If I don't nod in apparent agreement (and silently prove your failure), then you may brutally dissect and explain the joke.  I'm one of those weird people who will probably laugh even then.The strange thing about owning a part of a movie as if you're special (despite the fact that neigh on 17,000 people took the trouble to rate the thing on a website to prove how special they are) is that paradox of sharing.  I own it and I'm special, now I want you to join the cult.  If you don't (and thereby emphasize exactly how special I am), then this is an affront to me, the House of Ratigan, my tastes, and Western Civilization.The paradox is resolved with the premise that your ownership (if accepted) is but a pale reflection of my blazing glory and when you go all new moon on it, you've disrupted my universe.  Maybe I'm just some rogue comet that meets up once every some-odd years with other, grander planets or I'm a moon to someone else's star.  Or can I be?  Is this metaphor just collapsing into itself like the universe only to reduce to nothing and then explode once again with brute denial!I digress.The whole movie can roughly be described as understated.  That's means it's right up my alley.  It's also British (Welsh), so it's so far up my alley, I'll see it twice.  I had high expectations for all of these reasons and they were met and exceeded.  You can't do better than that.  Definitely worth the investment.&lt;...>",5,Prof. Ratigan Reviews,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,5545,"['mother', 'worried', 'have', 'mental', 'problems', 'found', 'book', 'teenage', 'paranoid',

1453523,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B005C7SXMS,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 2]","The 2010 film `Submarine' is in my opinion one of those ""could have been films"" that just didn't quite reach its potential. The story-line captured my full attention at the beginning; a coming of age movie examining the internal thought processes of a sensitive young Welsh boy (Oliver played by (Craig Roberts) as he deals with feelings of acceptance, peer pressure, love, a quirky, dysfunctional family and the always presence knowledge that when all is said and done we are all alone in the world. It had kind of a Woody Allen feel played out against the enchanting Celtic landscape of Wales.There were so many ways to go with this film, so many possible avenues to explore. Maybe that turned out to be the problem. After wetting the audience's appetite with a well thought out entrance into Oliver's world populated by school mates, love interest and parents the filmmakers had to decide what aspects of Oliver's world to focus on. In my opinion that choose incorrectly.I thought his life at school was by far the most interesting. There was an early sequence of events involving his participation in bullying an overweight girl for the sole purpose of winning favor with peers and his future girlfriend. His feelings of guilt and the moment of personal self examination that followed the incidence was touching and possibly the best moment in the film for me. Surprisingly the film suddenly veered off in another direction, a missed opportunity in my estimation.Ultimately what I see as the main problem was the character development of Oliver. Initially I found Oliver to be an intelligent, introspective and likeable young man I could easily identify with. To be sure, he was someone who didn't always make the right choices, but did nothing out of malice of forethought. However as the storyline and his persona developed those intelligent and introspective qualities displayed early in the film had given way to something more in keeping with perverse pathological tendencies and paranoid-like behavior. In other words he was no longer likeable. That's when I found myself waiting for the film to end. To be fair everyone is attracted to different personality types, this one just wasn't relatable to me.",3,"""We're All Traveling Under The Radar"" ~ Life, Love And Dysfunctionality",1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,2213,"['2010', 'film', 'Submarine', 'opinion', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'films', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'potential', 'story-line', 'captured', 'full', 'attention', 'beginning', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'examining', 'internal', 'thought', 'processes', 'sensitive', 'young', 'Welsh', 'boy', 'Oliver', 'played', 'Craig', 'Roberts', 'feelings', 'acceptance', 'peer', 'pressure', 'love', 'quirky', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'always', 'presence', 'knowledge', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'are', 'alone', 'world', 'had', 'kind', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'feel', 'played', 'out', 'enchanting', 'Celtic', 'landscape', 'Wales.There', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'go', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'possible', 'avenues', 'explore', 'Maybe', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'problem', 'wetting', 'audience', 'appetite', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'entrance', 'Oliver', 'world', 'populated', 'school', 'mates', 'love', 'interest', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'decide', 'what', 'aspects', 'Oliver', 'world', 'focus', 'opinion', 'choose', 'incorrectly.I', 'thought', 'life', 'school', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'was', 'early', 'sequence', 'events', 'involving', 'participation', 'bullying', 'overweight', 'girl', 'sole', 'purpose', 'winning', 'favor', 'peers', 'future', 'girlfriend', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'moment', 'personal', 'self', 'examination', 'followed', 'incidence', 'was', 'touching', 'possibly', 'best', 'moment', 'film', 'Surprisingly', 'film', 'suddenly', 'veered', 'off', 'direction', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'estimation.Ultimately', 'what', 'see', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'Oliver', 'Initially', 'found', 'Oliver', 'be', 'intelligent', 'introspective', 'likeable', 'young', 'man', 'could', 'easily', 'identify', 'be', 'sure', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'did', 'nothing', 'malice', 'forethought', 'However', 'storyline', 'persona', 'developed', 'intelligent', 'introspective', 'qualities', 'displayed', 'early', 'film', 'had', 'given', 'way', 'something', 'more', 'keeping', 'perverse', 'pathological', 'tendencies', 'paranoid-like', 'behavior', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'likeable', 'when', 'found', 'waiting', 'film', 'end', 'be', 'fair', 'everyone', 'attracted', 'different', 'personality', 'types', 'one', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'relatable']",Submarine

The characters (other than the zany ninja ""light guru"" guy) are dry and subdued, even depressed for much of the film. With just a few exceptions where a splash of color is used effectively (i.e. a red coat), the color palette is mostly drab grays and blues, reflecting the dreariness of the characters' lives.The story is one of love, loneliness, and cruelty in both adolescents coming-of-age and weary adults who should know better.

Jordana herself is not so pleasant, she's a rather remote young lady who is not above bullying her less fortunate classmates.  Oliver, however, is smitten, and sets about trying to win her love.Meanwhile, Oliver's parents seem to be slowly drifting apart: his father suffers from bouts of depression and his mother is becoming way too close to an old beau, a new age guru, for Oliver's comfort.  Oliver can see his family on the verge of falling apart and it drives him to desperate acts.These characters struggle through their lives against a gloomy Welsh seaside background that is a perfect reflection of their moods.  None of these people is from Sunnybrook Farm, they definitely have theiri all to human flaws.

1453528,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B005C7SXMS,CGScammell,"[0, 0]","I have to admit that seeing that this was produced by Ben Stiller (and a few others)is what attracted me to this little-known movie.  This movie didn't disappoint, and I sensed a bit of Stillerisms throughout this movie in both the actor playing Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts) and in the cinematography, in which scenes are flashed acrossed the screen using lighting techniques and Jacques Brel songs, a famous Belgian singer popular in mid-20th century France.This is a unique coming-of-age movie.  All the main characters are weird (something I find Ben Stiller is famous for portraying as well).  Craig is an outsider 15-year-old determined to find a girlfriend.  He's scared enough he won't succeed in ever having one, let alone of having intimate relations with one, though.  He has a mean touch to his action, too.  His parents are weird in their own way, trying to survive or revive their own staled marriage, which is further threatened by their neighbor who is an old flame of the mother.  The parents are so consumed by their own woes that they don't see the anguish of their own son, and when son talks to mother about his attempts at finding a girlfriend, mom is only relieved her weird son isn't gay.  Is this a typical response of a parent toward their sexually-awakening son?!The acting is stellar on all the actors' parts.  The writing is crisp and the cinematography is just as beautiful.  The sountrack is also nice in its own right, being so unusual for a British-made film.  If you aren't a fan of 1960s French music, it may hurt your ears, but it fits in well with Craig's love for French romance singers.The movie is about love and friendship, doubt and self-doubt, but also about forgiveness and redemption.  There are some sweet and tender moments in this movie, and I found the end a bit of a surprise...or not.This is definitely worth watching, for both Ben Stiller fans and fans of independent/British films.",5,A lovely little sleeper,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1932,"['have', 'admit', 'seeing', 'was', 'produced', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'few', 'others', 'what', 'attracted', 'little-known', 'movie', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'sensed', 'bit', 'Stillerisms', 'movie', 'actor', 'playing', 'Oliver', 'Tate', 'Craig', 'Roberts', 'cinematography', 'scenes', 'are', 'flashed', 'screen', 'using', 'lighting', 'techniques', 'Jacques', 'Brel', 'songs', 'famous', 'Belgian', 'singer', 'popular', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'France.This', 'unique', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'weird', 'something', 'find', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'famous', 'portraying', 'as', 'well', 'Craig', 'outsider', '15-year-old', 'determined', 'find', 'girlfriend', 'scared', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'ever', 'having', 'one', 'let', 'alone', 'having', 'intimate', 'relations', 'one', 'though', 'mean', 'touch', 'action', 'too', 'parents', 'are', 'weird', 'own', 'way', 'trying', 'survive', 'revive', 'own', 'staled', 'marriage', 'further', 'threatened', 'neighbor', 'who', 'old', 'flame', 'mother', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'consumed', 'own', 'woes', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anguish', 'own', 'son', 'when', 'son', 'talks', 'mother', 'attempts', 'finding', 'girlfriend', 'mom', 'only', 'relieved', 'weird', 'son', ""n't"", 'gay', 'typical', 'response', 'parent', 'sexually-awakening', 'son', 'acting', 'stellar', 'actors', 'parts', 'writing', 'crisp', 'cinematography', 'just', 'as', 'beautiful', 'sountrack', 'also', 'nice', 'own', 'right', 'being', 'so', 'unusual', 'British-made', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', '1960s', 'French', 'music', 'may', 'hurt', 'ears', 'well', 'Craig', 'love', 'French', 'romance', 'singers.The', 'movie', 'love', 'friendship', 'doubt', 'self-doubt', 'also', 'forgiveness', 'redemption', 'are', 'sweet', 'tender', 'moments', 'movie', 'found', 'end', 'bit', 'surprise', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'fans', 'fans', 'independent/British', 'films']",Submarine
1453529,A4U27URFECK1U,B005C7SXMS,"Chris Damon ""Classic TV & Tech Guy""","[0, 0]","Growing up as a teenager in Wales or anywhere in the UK seems like a far different experience than growing up here in America.  As with many British films depicting ""coming of age"" such as ""Wish You Were Here"" to ""Trainspotting"", there is always a feeling that you are missing something because there is a underlying cultural difference that you can never quite pinpoint.  Submarine has some of this, but not as much as other films of this type.There are quite a few vibes you get when watching ""Submarine"", which is kind of expected, since there was nothing really ""new"" in the film, it seemed to borrow styles from other films. I guess the strongest vibe you feel is that it is like ""Rushmore"", this is true, especially the narrative style. I also got the vibe from Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" as much of the movie deals with Oliver's parent's relationship, his mother's affair, and how they handle the situation.  This is reflected on his own relationship with his new girlfriend.  It's hard to talk about this film without giving to much away, so I won't.In case you were wondering if I liked the film, I did. It had the usual indie quirkiness, plus there was one point in the movie that they were lighting flares, sparklers and setting things on fire that reminded me of the Snow Patrol video for ""Run"" as Oliver tosses a flaming bicycle into the water.  What I did find lacking however is a good soundtrack. There only appeared to be music by a singer-songwriter named Alex Turner, and I could take it or leave it. Maybe he is big in Wales, I don't know.  Since the movie took place in an undetermined time in the 80's (imDb says it's 1986), the music choices are abundant , but I'm sorry to say that there probably was no budget for music in this movie. Music probably would have made this movie a bit more enjoyable, just look at Rushmore's outstanding soundtrack. You remember the movie just as much for the music as the movie. That could also have been a director's decision to keep the soundtrack minimalist, I don't know. I have not the Special Feature ""The Making of Submarine"" - maybe that will clue me in. Maybe I will also learn about the prominence of the four colors throughout the film that some of the characters wear - blue, red, yellow and black - The most obvious being  Yasmine in her prominent red coat.I find that most of the movies that hit my DVD player lately are from the Weinstein Company (in this case there are seven other companies involved as who produced the film), it seems that they have the ""pulse"" on good indie entertainment right now, plus their movies seemed to win a lot of Golden Globes.

It's set in current day Wales and it was nice to see the beautiful and as well as the more prosaic countryside.  I'd guess that Oliver is about 15 years old.  He's fallen in love for the first time in his dreamy way with a classmate, Jordana.  They finally bond over a bullying episode against another student.  Though the bullying is uncharacteristic of Oliver he gladly goes along with it as well as some of Jordana's other pastimes such as spitting and lighting fires in trash bins.  There is an obligatory `falling in love set to mushy music' pastiche of the two spitting pyromaniacs bonding.  He throws lit fireworks into trash cans as they hold hands and run away.  She lifts his pant leg and burns his hair.  It's funny.  In fact much of this movie is hilarious from the dead pan line delivery and screenplay writer Richard Ayoade's understated dialog.  The only problem is the words are often spoken so quietly and too quickly that it's hard to get the full affect.  I found myself laughing a beat late as I finally put together what had just happened.  Especially funny was Noah Taylor who plays Oliver's depressed, science professor father.  As you can imagine from the title the film is sprinkled with water metaphors; spitting, urinating, rain, a swimming pool, a bath tub, a massive sucking drain and of course the beautiful Welsh Ocean with gorgeous sunsets.

1453531,A3J2FNZVT1IBBK,B005C7SXMS,De Omnibus Dubitandum.,"[0, 3]","FIRST: I must admit that anything with or by or involving Ben Stiller always grabs my attention and as this is his presentation (he has a brief appearance in the film) I was happy to view this film. YES it is another ""coming of age story"" (COAS) but I just love them and find them both touching and enlightening. Likely my own still unresolved issues fuel this interest.SECOND: This particular COAS is, as best I can figure, is set in a time between 1976 and 1997. I say that is the window because they are watching VHS video tapes (and listening to cassette tapes) and the VHS became available at the earliest in 1976. And as there are no DVDs nor CDs in the film it must be set before 1997 when movies on DVD first became available.THIRD: This time period saw a great deal of issues regarding blacks and women come to the forefront.OK, having stated all that as background young OLIVER the protagonist has two primary problems: (A) He fears his parents will divorce; (B) He desires a significant and sexual other (a girl). His issues with the parental problem cause him to make poor decisions with his new found friend who is a girl. On both fronts tension and problems and conflicts and confrontations present themselves as they might in your life (dear reader) and in mine. Remarkable, there is a rather happy, although tentatively happy, ending.The actors are all excellent from the stars to the extras. Yes it is quirky but not silly. It is serious and respectful of the persons/characters in the film and never makes fun of them. It could have been more tightly edited, but I am no genius and can not tell you exactly what should have been removed.I laughed, I cried, I felt for all these people and cared about them.

1453532,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B005C7SXMS,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 2]","----------------------------------------""Submarine"" (2011)----------------------------------------Note: mild spoilers below.----------------------------------------This British indie film focuses on the insecurities and idiosyncrasies of a teenage loner attending a private (?) school where he hooks up with a prickly young girl and tries to form a meaningful emotional relationship inside a social context of total cynicism and detachment. Meanwhile, his family life provides a perilous example, with his totally checked-out, socially challenged father seemingly about to break up with the more functional but also emotionally remote mother. As the film opened, I sensed a kinship to the ""quirky"" films of Wes Anderson (""Rushmore,"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" etc.) which I detest for their facile irony and contempt for their easily mockable, stick-figure characters. ""Submarine,"" however, kept my interest as the familiar dynamics of precocious-young-man-in-an-absurdist-world seemed to give way to something more subtle and engaging. For one thing, the narrator-protagonist didn't seem like such a know-it-all savant, indeed, he seemed genuinely befuddled and barely able to keep ahead of the curve and maintain his public front of geekish cool. The dynamics of his relationship were odd, but not the cartoonish agit-prop of the Anderson ouvre. So, for the middle section of the film I was engaged... That changed, however, with the introduction of the family's new neighbor, a clownish New Age guru prone to martial arts hyaa-yah chops and meaningless sexual conquests: here was a classic Anderson-ian stick figure, and the tenor of the film sagged as soon as we delved into Graham's superficiality.What I dislike about this genre is its lack of emotional resonance and the lack of respect or credence it gives its characters... The humor is facile and empty, and while ""Submarine"" is a genuinely darker and more uncomfortable film than any of Anderson's efforts, it unnecessarily dips into the same well just enough that I got a familiar sour taste. Nonetheless, it's an intriguing film, with some compelling performances (mainly the teen couple) and an odd, unpredictable tang that gives it just enough mystery to make it a worthwhile view.

1453533,A26DQMYF5E0GL6,B005C7SXMS,Don Walton Jr.,"[1, 2]","A lot of films strive to 'place' the viewer in the place of the protagonist of the story.  To cause the viewer to feel and sympathize with the hero of the film, and cheer him on.  It's difficult to think of a film that does just this more productively than 'Submarine'.  I went into it knowing nothing about the movie, and came out of it feeling like I had just spent time with a close friend.Ultimately, 'Submarine' is an exploration of a young man's adolescent failures and tiny successes, but every thought that 'Oliver Tate' (our hero) stammers aloud is met with touches of humor, confusion, anger, conflict, romance and anxiety from both the cast around him and the audience.  'Submarine' is perfectly cast and hits its mark time and time again.  I had a great time hanging out with Oliver and his family, and reliving the awkwardness and thrills of young love and adolescence.A great directorial debut from Richard Ayoade (yes, the guy with the afro on 'The IT Crowd')...

He has the requisite quirky girlfriend (Yasmine Paige), the pal who gives well-meaning but inaccurate advice about relationships; and two parents (Noah Taylor and Sally Hawkins) who are slowly drifting apart, as the result of an old beau (Paddy Considine) turned self-help guru who has moved in next door.Since Oliver's girlfriend has family problems of her own, he wants to be the ""best"" boyfriend he can be, but he's also concerned with keeping his parents together, monitoring their whereabouts with a rather stalker-like intensity.  These are laudable goals, but unfortunately, everyone ends the film not a whole lot happier than they were when they began.  The film reminded me of ""Harold and Maude"" (Tate bears an eerie resemblance to a young Bud Cort and is somewhat concerned with death) and ""Rushmore,"" but while Harold learned that there was more to life than attending funerals, and Max Fischer produced a successful play and accepted that he can't always meddle in adults' lives, Oliver doesn't really seem to change over the course of the movie.

Fourteen year old Oliver Tate is in love with his classmate Jordana Bevan. Oliver's folks are having issues in their marriage and mom's old flame has moved in next door. Oliver feels compelled to get the girl and save his folks' marriage.This is a quirky flick. Oliver is young and too bright for his age so he comes off as kind of gorpy. Jordana seems nice enough but has a dark side and harbors issues regarding closeness and commitment. Of course Oliver only sees what he wants to see in her because he wants to get in her nickers. His mom seems normal enough but dad is an intellectual stick in the mud. Her old flame is way too into himself and his ""New Age"" guru travelling show, but he's more alive than dad. This film does much to give the viewer the sense of the craziness one experiences when coming of age. The awkwardness and missteps are all brought to the forefront.Again, this is a very quirky movie. It's set in Whales and sometimes the accents and Oliver's rapid fire delivery of a line kept me from getting everything, but I enjoyed it just the same. And this is only a happy-ish ending. You get the feeling that Oliver and Jordana, if they move into the future together, might not end up as the storybook happy couple. They both have issues to work on.This is director Richard Ayoade's first feature length film, but he seems to have already found a voice.

1453539,A33Z8L75OXCP78,B005C7SXMS,Eric Schenk,"[0, 1]","This movie is set in the dark, funny, poignant demimonde of a Welsh teen-age boy.  But before i discuss the movie, i want to offer a heartfelt ""Thank you"" to the Weinstein Company for including English subtitles.  I don't understand why some companies release British films in America without including subtitles.  A dialog-heavy movie such as Mike Leigh's ""Another Year"" is much less enjoyable when one can't make out occasional bits of the actors' lines.  Similarly, most English detective series, such as ""Prime Suspect"" (which featured strong performances by Helen Mirren) are usually released without subtitles, depriving people like me of the opportunity to become fully engrossed because i can't make out about 20% of what is being said. As George Bernard Shaw noted, England and America are two countries are divided by a common language. Thank you, Weinstein Company and Anchor Bay for recognizing the wisdom in that bit of wit.The main character both in action and perspective is Oliver (in a performance by Craig Roberts that hits all the right notes): a thoughtful, melancholy boy who inhabits that vast grey middle ground between the popular and the unpopular.  His parents, well portrayed by Noah Taylor and the always enjoyable Sally Hawkins, were, apparently, at one time, a bit bohemian.  But they have settled into a marriage also situated in the vast grey middle between the happy and the unhappy.  His father, looking like a mild-mannered Rasputin, is a full-on nerd, is a marine biologist.  His mother, once the sort of girl that men fought over now looks like a prim third-grade teacher. A repeated image in the movie is the three of them sitting almost trance-like in front of the television. Having few examples as to how passion and sexuality are to be expressed, Oliver is never sure of himself. Indeed, his mother is worried that he might be gay.The main plot, as is usually the case in these movies is Oliver's pursuit of the ""mildly unpopular"" Jordana Brewer.  Although Jordana, played by Yasmin Paige, is a great character, one of the few weaknesses of the film (and clear evidence that the director is a man) is that she is more of a fantasy girl who in the real world would have no interest in a boy like Oliver.  She is wild, dark, and dangerous, enamored of fire and bullying.  She would have no patience for an awkward nebbish like Oliver.  Notably, one of the pictures on Oliver's bedroom wall is a caricature of Woody Allen.) This is the sort of relationship that boys like Oliver --and the characters Woody played in his early movies --dream about -- the wild, unconventional girl who will be his passport to the world of the id.Because this is a comedy about good people, the betting money is on a happy ending. (It is the rare comedy,The Wacknessor(500) Days of Summer] or perhaps the greatest film of this type, [[ASIN:6304907729 Annie Hall]that challenges the well-worn trope of ""Boy meets girl; boy loses girl; boy wins girl back."") But every scene between Oliver and Jordana is rich and engaging.  The movie seamlessly incorporates the subplots. And its wit and poignancy are seldom (although sometimes)created through manipulation of the audience. And the elements that make the title, ""Submarine"", surprisingly appropriate make this a truly enjoyable film.  I was worried that i would be watching a Disney channel movie.

There are some very subtle jokes and references that are easy to miss if you're not paying attention.  In fact, I would recommend that anyone who watches this do so at least two times.  Some of the callbacks to previous scenes and other happenings in the story need to be appreciated and it's very difficult to do so with only one viewing.  It's a very well-written and well-directed movie (and well-edited, for that matter) everything fits together like a great jigsaw puzzle of storytelling.  I thought most of the actors' performances were very good, except I thought the parents' lack of emotional involvement in their own lives was a little extreme.  However, that perception may have just carried over from their son's description of them as being very ""calm"" about everything.  I'd say this was a great coming of age story - except the main character himself (Oliver Tate) sort of skewers that very concept toward the end of the movie.  That was one of the most interesting things about this movie - that Oliver was completely aware of everything he was going through almost as if he was one of us - a viewer of the movie.

The movie tells, among other things, about the confused young man's relationships with fellow students and his teacher at school, his parents who he thinks are breaking up, his neighbors who he is convinced are strange and one of whom may be responsible for his mother abandoning his father, his reactions to a dying person and hospitals, and especially and primarily his difficult relationship with the girl who he loves.",5,"A different view of a boy growing up: ironic, sad, moody, yet somewhat funny",1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,821,"['are', 'lots', 'books', 'movies', 'examine', 'difficulties', 'boys', 'have', 'growing', 'up', 'film', 'young', 'teen', 'problems', 'somewhat', 'different', 'ironic', 'sad', 'moody', 'yet', 'slightly', 'humorous', 'lens', 'acting', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'looks', 'one', 'person', 'are', 'very', 'articulate', 'frequently', 'more', 'words', 'good', 'movie', 'tells', 'other', 'things', 'confused', 'young', 'man', 'relationships', 'fellow', 'students', 'teacher', 'school', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'breaking', 'up', 'neighbors', 'who', 'convinced', 'are', 'strange', 'one', 'whom', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'mother', 'abandoning', 'father', 'reactions', 'dying', 'person', 'hospitals', 'especially', 'primarily', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'girl', 'who']",Submarine

Hey -- we have all been through it, haven't we?Admittedly, it's perfectly agonizing, at times, and yet the intensity of the feelings we feel during the experience make it worth it. I cannot imagine being quite that self-absorbed ever again...But I am 60 now and I still REMEMBER my teens, and love remembering, even though I was way too fat and spent half the time reading. OK, more than half the time, I admit it.My heart hurts for the narrator of this charming movie, ""Oliver"". I identify with him. Smart, a misfit, a loser, he is such a dreamer. But he has such BIG plans! Nothing is impossible for young people--that is what is so cool. I find we lean some of of our most important lessons when we are young. Then, later on, the memories of them unfold and teach us more and more as we grow older.A movie like Submarine reminds us of how silly we can be as kids. Yet at the time, whatever it was which was occupying us was all so terribly important. You know what I mean. And actually it is important. It is part and parcel of what makes us who we are, now.I LOVE humor, and this movie, Submarine, is a comedy, basically. Its brilliant acting turns by leads ""Oliver"" (Craig Roberts), and his would-be Juliet, ""Jordana"" (Yasmin Paige), the sort-of arrestingly pretty girl with exzema (and a few worse secrets than that obvious problem) are perfect. Paddy Considine as the self-help neighbor next door to the Tates, whom Oliver suspects is having an affair with his mother is fantastic in his part. I would watch this movie again just to see him, with his dramtic spiked hairdo from the eighties, his divaesque self-help program with these LIGHTS swirling about, and his insane van, painted all over with ads for his program.There is more to this movie than you might think, at first viewing.It is very clearly laid out. Titled Prologue, etc., right up to the end. It is separated into vignettes which are clearly delineated. Somehow this makes it funnier, yet more dramatic in import as well.Oliver narrates throughout and his adolescent voice, speaking his thoughts as they happen, give this movie the punch it needs to keep going and keep our attention.You will be in for quite a few surprises with this movie, and a lovely ending (did I spoil something?). However, up until then you will be on the edge of your seat with this kid's pain, heartache, overthinking(he is very smart), attempts at getting first love right, betrayal, honor, strength, and heart. His courtship of his would-be love is incredible. Can't wait for you to see that!Yes, I loved this movie and I recommend it.  It has wonderful acting as I said, wonderful scenery from Wales, and yeah, it's ""quirky"" as Vogue magazine said, but with great, sincere honesty.

Oliver Tate learns a lot about relationships through the course of the film whether it is with his crush, Jordana, or in trying to keep his parents from splitting up after his mother's first love moves in next door.  The film is interesting and has depth, but tries to do too much in the editing process.  Sometimes with great effect, but often with confusing results.  The acting is good and well rounded, but never fully gets out of its awkward stage.  While this is amusing at first, after a while the tone falls a little flat, particularly as Oliver becomes more and more paranoid about what is going on, or not, with his parents and the neighbor.  His own personal relationships begin to suffer as a result and the character begins to feel a bit one sided.  That said, there are plenty of moments of good humor, deadpan or not.

1453548,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B005C7SXMS,Kevin F. Tasker,"[0, 0]","Submarine is a thoughtful, stylish, azure-tinted coming-of-age story that tells a familiar tale in a clever but never pretentious way. Oliver Tate is young, alienated and beset by delusions of grandeur. He believes he is supremely important yet his place in the universe has not yet revealed itself--aside from being an accessory to the occasional pond-plunge for the fat girl at school. He spies on his parents' love-making habits and tinkers in his room or stands pensively at the ocean's edge, awaiting inspiration that seems a long way off. Enter the girl in the stark red jacket who would change his life for the better--or at the very least add a little color. Relatedly, Oliver's ex-actress mother is searching for a bit of color herself to save her from the pervasive doldrums that plague her marriage with a marine biologist and chronic depressive whose only relatively alluring feature--beyond his stellar beard--is his ability to create relationship mix-tapes that encompass both passionate beginnings and unavoidable despondency. The way in which Oliver's mother tries to save herself is quite comical as she attempts to join forces with a neighboring `ninja' whose self-help ramblings end up relating to improving one's sphere of color by never-fully-explained self-transcendence. Color, inevitably, conjoins the worlds of both Oliver and his distant parental units. It is of supreme importance. Submarine, as a whole, manages to balances Oliver's quasi-romantic exploits with his attempts to alter the grim course of his parents` marriage without seeming the least bit manipulative or over-done. The visual palate is washed out but peppered by various flairs such as title cards and fades to red or blue. The dialogue is snappy as an asp in your palms and without a doubt, the performances by young Noah Taylor and Yasmin Paige are phenomenal. Overall, anyone familiar with the work of Wes Anderson or Noah Baumbach should be feel comfortable wading into these waters. The film is melancholic without being depressing and relatable without being stale: biting with dry wit, arsonist young love and all the fast-cut magic of modern cinema, it is not to be missed.",4,Unusual and elevating: A coming of age story for the new millennium,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,2176,"['Submarine', 'thoughtful', 'stylish', 'azure-tinted', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'familiar', 'tale', 'clever', 'never', 'pretentious', 'way', 'Oliver', 'Tate', 'young', 'alienated', 'beset', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'supremely', 'important', 'yet', 'place', 'universe', 'not', 'yet', 'revealed', 'aside', 'being', 'accessory', 'occasional', 'pond-plunge', 'fat', 'girl', 'school', 'parents', 'love-making', 'habits', 'tinkers', 'room', 'pensively', 'ocean', 'edge', 'awaiting', 'inspiration', 'long', 'way', 'Enter', 'girl', 'stark', 'red', 'jacket', 'who', 'would', 'change', 'life', 'better', 'very', 'least', 'add', 'little', 'color', 'Relatedly', 'Oliver', 'ex-actress', 'mother', 'searching', 'bit', 'color', 'save', 'pervasive', 'doldrums', 'plague', 'marriage', 'marine', 'biologist', 'chronic', 'depressive', 'only', 'relatively', 'alluring', 'feature', 'stellar', 'beard', 'ability', 'create', 'relationship', 'mix-tapes', 'encompass', 'passionate', 'beginnings', 'unavoidable', 'despondency', 'way', 'Oliver', 'mother', 'save', 'quite', 'comical', 'join', 'forces', 'neighboring', 'ninja', 'self-help', 'ramblings', 'end', 'up', 'relating', 'improving', 'one', 'sphere', 'color', 'never-fully-explained', 'self-transcendence', 'Color', 'inevitably', 'worlds', 'Oliver', 'distant', 'parental', 'units', 'supreme', 'importance', 'Submarine', 'whole', 'balances', 'Oliver', 'quasi-romantic', 'exploits', 'attempts', 'alter', 'grim', 'course', 'parents', 'marriage', 'seeming', 'least', 'bit', 'manipulative', 'over-done', 'visual', 'palate', 'washed', 'out', 'peppered', 'various', 'flairs', 'such', 'title', 'cards', 'fades', 'red', 'blue', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'asp', 'palms', 'doubt', 'performances', 'young', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'Yasmin', 'Paige', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'Overall', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'work', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'should', 'be', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'wading', 'waters', 'film', 'melancholic', 'being', 'depressing', 'relatable', 'being', 'stale', 'biting', 'dry', 'wit', 'arsonist', 'young', 'love', 'fast-cut', 'magic', 'modern', 'cinema', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Submarine
1453549,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005C7SXMS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 12]","Being a fan of Richard Ayoade from ""The Mighty Boosh"" and ""The IT Crowd,"" I was eager to check out his feature film debut ""Submarine.""  As the writer and director of this offbeat coming-of-age story, Ayoade demonstrates a deft hand balancing a narrative that is simultaneously outrageous and surprisingly grounded.  Championed by Ben Stiller (who takes an executive producer credit), the movie has moments of laugh-out-loud humor to be sure--but it is much more than a conventional teenage romp.  I hate using the term quirky as a descriptor.  Quirk, as I've often and loudly proclaimed, is the curse of independent cinema.  Too many times, eccentric characters and unbelievable situations abound in quirky coming-of-age stories that drain real life relatability out of the comedy.  ""Submarine,"" however, employs a real restraint.  Its deadpan tone and clever script are its strongest assets in conveying a story that, despite its occasional wackiness, presents identifiable dilemmas and believable protagonists.Set in contemporary Wales, ""Submarine"" introduces a high school outsider played by Craig Roberts.  Roberts contends with the traditional angst of a boy of fifteen.  Trying to navigate the pitfalls of school and, in the process, score his first real girlfriend--Roberts has an understated charm that is pivotal to the success of the film.  Even at his most gloriously frustrating, Roberts always holds the story together as one of the most strikingly original heroes I've seen in a while.  In addition to his blossoming romance with a very challenging partner, his life faces further upheaval as his parent's marriage seems to be on the brink of destruction.  His mother (the always reliable Sally Hawkins) is spending a lot of time with an old paramour who happens to be a neighbor (Paddy Considine).  Befuddled dad (Noah Taylor) seems ill-equipped to deal with this new set of circumstances so Roberts becomes both sleuth and mischief maker in a scheme to keep things on track.In truth, there is nothing in the plotting of ""Submarine"" that you haven't seen in countless other films.  But despite this, the movie still feels very fresh and original.  A lot of credit must go to a terrific central performance.  But Yasmin Paige as the tough, yet vulnerable, love interest is such a complex and interesting character as well.  Hawkins and Taylor make a perfect pair of opposites and Considine has a lot of fun with a new-age self-help psychic ninja shtick (you just have to see the movie).  Although quite humorous, this is not always what I would describe as a laugh riot.  It has an understated cleverness and much of the amusement derives from uncomfortable situations.  If I had to compare the film's sardonic tone to that of another filmmaker, the closest relation in my mind would be Wes Anderson at his most restrained.  An easy recommendation, Ayoade has scored a winner and I look forward to future endeavors.

When a mysterious girl draws him into his first romantic relationship, everything seems to fall into place. Until a strange self help guru moves in next door and his mom seems to take a fancy to him.SUBMARINE is a hybrid of coming of age story, comedic drama, and experimental filmmaking. The story marches along in different parts, almost like a short story collection.Oliver (played by Craig Roberts) is a strange, albeit charming protagonist who himself is a combination of Walter Mitty, Max Fischer from ""Rushmore,"" and Paul McCartney (it's the hair and wardrobe.) He's aggravating in the beginning, but as the film progresses, he's actually funny and awkward. The people around him add to the awkwardness: his girlfriend Jordana, perceived as a quiet bully, has more story to her than she lets on. Oliver's parents are polar opposites who start off flat and never fully develop, which is unfortunate because there was a lot of potential for their plot. And seeing Paddy Considine in a mullet doing martial arts is a blast.The music fits in to the film with ease, gliding along with an air of longing and pretentiousness which spoke to me. Pretentiousness is overrated, yet I can't help but enjoy the songs which highlight Oliver's life.I enjoyed watching this; however, it felt like the film was trying to be over the top just because it could.

In so many films, depression is overly romanticized or made to look more dramatic than it is.

1453555,ADTUS88NFTW23,B005C7SXMS,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[0, 0]","After receiving a string of terrible indie films to review, ""Submarine"" was a very nice change of pace.  ""Submarine"" is a small indie film from Wales telling the coming-of-age story of Oliver.  Many compare the movie to the film ""Rushmore"", but I think that it feels a bit more like ""Donnie Darko"", if all the science fiction bits were removed.  Like ""Donnie Darko"", the film is set in the 80's around a socially awkward youth who does not react to situations as most others around him might.  Unlike ""Darko"", where the angst in the main character is based in knowledge in the pending end of the world; the problems in ""Submarine"" are grounded in reality (relationship troubles, bullies, parents, etc.).I do not know how to comment much on the movie without ruining the viewing experience.  These coming of age stories tend t follow the same plot patterns, and it is the execution that can make them interesting.  Much of the humor (as well as discomfort) in the film comes from Oliver's way of dealing with the situations in which he is placed.  In spite of his best intentions, he always errs on unintentionally dark solutions to his problems.I try not to quote critics, but I believe Roger Ebert really put it best when he said that the film ""doesn't try too hard to be desperately clever.  It's a self-confident work for the first-time director..."".  That is what I like about the movie.  While I do enjoy the films of Wes Anderson, I think he does try a bit too hard to be simultaneously clever and a little too twee.  ""Submarine"" feels like a work of passion, and it does not feel like the director is trying to convince the audience of anything other than that.

He spends his time daydreaming about how people would react to his death, listening to recordings by French crooners and also plotting how to lose his virginity, preferably with the equally eccentric Jordana (Yasmin Paige), who likes to start fires.Although he seems to hit a home run in his relationship with Jordana, Oliver does have some real world issues that he must confront.  His parents (Noah Taylor, Sally Hawkins) are not getting on well and, in fact, Oliver suspects that Mom is having an affair with the next-door neighbor (Paddy Considine), her old flame.  If that's not bad enough, Jordana's mother has a brain tumor and is facing surgery.How the young man deals with these problems is what growing up is all about.I was quite moved by this charming film.

1453558,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B005C7SXMS,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""Submarine"" is a coming-of-age dramedy set in Wales of the 1980s, narrated by its 15-year-old protagonist Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts). This is one of those rare cases where voiceover narration is not superfluous. Oliver is a socially awkward, introverted, slightly odd young man confronted with two challenges: getting a girlfriend and preventing his parents' relationship from disintegrating. Pretty mundane stuff and common grist for independent films. I've seen it all before -too many times. But Oliver and his annoying girlfriend and sweetly unhappy parents grew on me. This is Richard Ayoade's first feature film, which he wrote and directed, based on Joe Dunthorne's 2008 novel. He just hits the right notes. The trick is that Ayoade is not afraid to let Oliver be a selfish jerk.Oliver has his sights on his mildly pyromaniacal classmate Jordana (Yasmin Paige), and his plan is to win her over by bullying a chubby girl, which he thinks Jordana will find amusing. She does -then she tries to use Oliver to make her ex-boyfriend jealous. At least Oliver gets the girl. Then he wonders what he is going to do with her. Meanwhile, his ""naturally neurotic"" mother Jill (Sally Hawkins) is feeling lonely and frustrated in the face of his depressed, dweeby father Lloyd (Noah Taylor). Jill's old flame Graham (Paddy Considine), now a new age guru, has moved in next door, providing Jill an outlet for her emotions...and possibly and end to her marriage. But Oliver is determined not to let that happen.Oliver tends to do all the wrong things. And not because he's hapless and loveable. He does the wrong things on purpose. He's selfish and odd. I must give him credit for never doing the obvious. But there's something endearing about him after a while. His quiet determination is reflected in the film's tone. Although the parents are peripheral characters, I found them the most sympathetic. They're patient with their son and ultimately with each other. The DVD (Anchor Bay 2011) bonus features are 9 deleted or extended scenes and ""The Making of Submarine"" (11 min), featuring interviews with the cast and director in which they discuss the characters, making the film, and working with one another.

1453559,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B005C7SXMS,Mr. Bey,"[0, 0]","Given the fact that Submarine is prefaced by an introduction claiming that it is ""an important film, watch it with respect,"" I had my doubts going in. Many indie films find themselves to be far more important than they actually are. The ""produced by Ben Stiller"" label that can be found on the DVD cover and in the opening credits wasn't a good sign either. Films that advertise a famous person who didn't direct or star in it (though Stiller has a very minor cameo), generally do so because they don't have much else going for them. But once Submarine got started, I was blown away by the film's undeniable charm.Submarine is told from the perspective of Oliver Tate, a young fifteen-year-old bent on saving his parents relationship and losing his virginity. Young Oliver is a genius and carries the typical pretentiousness that you might expect, but his obliviousness is countered by his vulnerability. Oliver isn't the kind of guy you would like if you went to school with him, but you can't help but feel sympathy for him as you watch him struggle with situations that he can't control.Coming of age movies have been done for decades, but it's still incredibly satisfying when one's done properly. He struggles with girls as any fifteen year old would, but he doesn't turn to outlandish stunts to get his girlfriend Jordana, who dumped in after he struggled to offer her comfort while her mother battled cancer, back. He doesn't stand outside her window blasting Peter Gabriel from a boom box and he doesn't deliver any one-liners. His approach is rather normal. This might be unappealing to some who look to movies as an escape from reality, but indie fans will gobble this movie up.Submarine is an incredibly clever movie, but it's powered by humor that one might find in real life. It's advertised as a biopic and it lives up to that, even if the bio is about someone that isn't famous at all. You get to know Oliver and you get to care about him. It goes beyond the struggles of a too smart for his own good teenager searching to get laid, it's a tale of humanity that anyone can relate to. You wouldn't expect a movie about a fifteen-year-old Welsh boy to carry universal appeal, but you'd be surprised.If you like indie movies, give Submarine a shot. I still don't think it's an ""important film"" as it may claim to be, but it's certainly one of the most charming movies I've seen in a long time. The art of the teen film was perfected in the 80s and many films have failed to reinvent the wheel. Submarine doesn't come from the same mold as The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, but it does show the vulnerability that teenage years inevitably usher in. Few films enter that territory for any other reason that to get a few laughs. While I don't mean to put those films down, I appreciated Submarine's effort to accurately portray the realization of helplessness that many teenagers experience.",5,A Real Indie Treat,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,2905,"['Given', 'fact', 'Submarine', 'prefaced', 'introduction', 'claiming', 'important', 'film', 'watch', 'respect', 'had', 'doubts', 'going', 'Many', 'indie', 'films', 'find', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'actually', 'are', 'produced', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'label', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'DVD', 'cover', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'sign', 'Films', 'advertise', 'famous', 'person', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'star', 'Stiller', 'very', 'minor', 'cameo', 'generally', 'do', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'once', 'Submarine', 'got', 'started', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'film', 'undeniable', 'charm.Submarine', 'told', 'perspective', 'Oliver', 'Tate', 'young', 'fifteen-year-old', 'bent', 'saving', 'parents', 'relationship', 'losing', 'virginity', 'Young', 'Oliver', 'genius', 'typical', 'pretentiousness', 'might', 'expect', 'obliviousness', 'countered', 'vulnerability', 'Oliver', ""n't"", 'kind', 'guy', 'would', 'like', 'went', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'watch', 'struggle', 'situations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control.Coming', 'age', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'decades', 'still', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'when', 'one', 'done', 'properly', 'girls', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'outlandish', 'stunts', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'Jordana', 'who', 'dumped', 'struggled', 'offer', 'comfort', 'mother', 'battled', 'cancer', 'back', ""n't"", 'stand', 'window', 'blasting', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'boom', 'box', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'one-liners', 'approach', 'rather', 'normal', 'might', 'be', 'unappealing', 'who', 'look', 'movies', 'escape', 'reality', 'indie', 'fans', 'will', 'gobble', 'movie', 'up.Submarine', 'incredibly', 'clever', 'movie', 'powered', 'humor', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'real', 'life', 'advertised', 'biopic', 'up', 'even', 'bio', 'someone', ""n't"", 'famous', 'get', 'know', 'Oliver', 'get', 'care', 'struggles', 'too', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'teenager', 'searching', 'get', 'laid', 'tale', 'humanity', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Welsh', 'boy', 'carry', 'universal', 'appeal', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised.If', 'indie', 'movies', 'give', 'Submarine', 'shot', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'important', 'film', 'may', 'claim', 'be', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'art', 'teen', 'film', 'was', 'perfected', '80s', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'failed', 'reinvent', 'wheel', 'Submarine', ""n't"", 'come', 'same', 'mold', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'show', 'vulnerability', 'teenage', 'years', 'inevitably', 'usher', 'Few', 'films', 'enter', 'territory', 'other', 'reason', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'put', 'films', 'down', 'appreciated', 'Submarine', 'effort', 'accurately', 'portray', 'realization', 'helplessness', 'many', 'teenagers', 'experience']",Submarine

This is a hip and quirky coming-of-age story that is so intent on being quirky that it ends up not being very real. Fifteen-year-old Oliver Tate is a fairly typical outsider at school and is trying to land a girlfriend whose mother may be dying while he simultaneously saves his parents' marriage, which is endangered by his mother's apparent infatuation with a self-help guru.All of this could be the standard plot, give or take a bit, for any number of films, but ""Submarine"" is indeed different. For example, this fifteen-year-old boy listens to French crooners. He also makes films, at least in his dreams. In fact, he does a great number of things that, individually, might be credible of any particular fifteen-year-old boy but which, collectively, took the story out of the realm of believability for me. I still enjoyed the film, but I couldn't really get over the fact that I really did not believe in the characters. Nearly all of them seemed to be--I don't know what the right word is here.

I expected movie to be smart and funny and I was not let down.  Film is written and directed by Richard Ayoade.  This is the first of his movies that I have seen so far and I absolutely loved it.  Story is original and actors are carefully chosen.  It is a coming of age movie, setup in England.  The main protagonist is a teenage boy Oliver Tate, who is romantic daydreamer, experiencing confusion upon discovering feelings of attraction and love towards his classmate Jordana.  He is also determined to save his parents deteriorating marriage.The title of the movie ""Submarine"" is highly fitting the story. It is as if all of the characters are deep under the sea and if not careful, close to suffocating.

1453565,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B005C7SXMS,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","SUBMARINE is a very quirky, deeply INDIE-feeling movie.  It's set in lower class England, and involves a ""coming of age"" story for the very quirky, very INDIE-feeling Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts).  He's a bit of a loner...his only friends being boys who torment him only a little less than the rest of the school population.  But he's managed to catch the eye of the quirky, very INDIE-feeling Jordana (Yesmin Paige), and attempts to chart his way through his first experience with young love.This is the kind of film where the main character provides significant narration.  He's also one of those kids prone to blank looks, the ""affectless"" attitude so often seen in modern films about troubled teens.  The movie is slow paced, the accents thick and the humor of the most subtle kind.  It's not really a comedy, but more of a quirky drama.You may gather from my repeated use of the words ""quirky"" and ""indie"" that I find the film to be predictable and tired.  And much of it is.  The mood, the camera angles, the narration, so much feels SO terribly familiar.  What was once (what, maybe 20 years ago?) a fresh approach to storytelling now feels as clich&eacute;d as the any Hollywood film...just on a lower budget.  I found the first half of the movie to be almost unbearably familiar.But something happened along the way that pulls this film out of the trash heap.  It actually deals with some real emotions.  Most importantly, we come to understand that although Oliver's parents are quirky...the fact that their relationship is crumbling is actually a cause of some very real anxiety for Oliver.  He WANTS his parents to stay together.  He loves them and can tell they love him...but he also wants his family unit for the security and stability they bring him.  He's as surprised to discover it as we are.  His dad (Noah Taylor, who turns out to be quite amusing and endearing by the end) is a biologist who barely makes a living, and seems incapable of bringing any excitement to his wife.  Mom (Sally Hawkins) is coasting on the edge of leaving her family when who should move in across the street but her extremely quirky former boyfriend (Paddy Considine in a terrific mullet!) and his wife.  The old boyfriend is a low-rent psychic, giving lectures and selling VHS tapes of those lectures, complete with terrible special effects.  Mom is drawn to him, because he is alive and full of energy, even if he's also full of BS.  Oliver senses danger, and in his own quirky way, tries to restore order to the family.In the meantime, Jordana begins to let her guard down with Oliver, and the two grow close despite her stated desire to remain aloof.  It's a subtle change, and I also liked that the question of Oliver losing his virginity is handled in a humorous and relatively dignified manner.  And when Jordana has an emotional crisis of her own, the testing of their relationship actually contains some surprises.SUBMARINE is still hopelessly enthralled with the trappings of indie filmmaking.  But beneath that predictable veneer, some fine ideas and good performances are there for your enjoyment.

But then he has an encounter with a girl he likes. Jordana has been dumped by her boyfriend. To get back at him, she enlists Oliver to kiss her and take pictures of said kissing. This, of course, gets Oliver in trouble with the ex-boyfriend who is a bully.

1453575,A2VWE5SGNDS8HW,B005C7SXMS,"tachi1 ""tachi1""","[0, 1]","Submarine is a witty, occasionally sardonic, film shot in a distinctly Wes Anderson-like style, about Oliver (Craig Roberts) a quirky young man coming of age as he deals with his first love and his parents' deteriorating marriage. The film, written and directed by Richard Ayoade and executive produced by Ben Stiller, follows Oliver as he navigates tricky emotional waters both at home and in school: His girlfriend's mother is dying and the sheer terror of it is often too much for him to handle, leaving him less responsive and supportive than his girlfriend would like. Simultaneously, Oliver tries to sabotage what he perceives as a burgeoning affair between his mother and a wildly narcissistic self-help guru next door (a hilarious supporting performance by Paddy Considine).It sounds like unbearably intense material, but the narrative style is a dry, deadpan one that keeps the tone light and occasionally makes one laugh out loud. I mentioned that the style is pure Wes Anderson and viewers of Anderson's work can probably guess what that means: strong, very graphic, visuals and compositions; prolonged set pieces set to popular music; deadpan delivery; offbeat humor; and heavy use of narration.As in Anderson's work, you see here a director very much in command of his material. The film is visually beautiful and expressive; it's at all times witty and entertaining, and occasionally very funny; and the performances are all excellent (Sally Hawkins plays Oliver's mother and is wonderful as usual). What it lacks, however, is a strong emotional core that leaves one truly moved as well as entertained. It is a weakness shared by Wes Anderson's lesser works, but overcome in his best (The Royal Tanenbaums). What I mean is that, to a remarkable degree given what the characters are going through, we don't care about them all that much: both central relationships (Oliver and his girlfriend, Oliver's parents) could rot and one doesn't get the sense that the characters would be worse off. There's a vulnerability that's missing in these characters to make them feel more relatable and human. It's the risk that comes with having a story that is so strongly stylized -- and no amount of wit and charm can mitigate it. What would have, I think, taken the film to another emotional level, would have been a sublime moment or two written into the script and delivered with heart: I'm thinking of the moment in The Royal Tanenbaums when the off-the-wall eccentric character played by Ben Stiller confesses to his father ""it's been a very tough year dad"" and suddenly all of his strangeness takes on a new dimension and we're seeing a scared, lonely human being in all his complexity. It's moments like that which reveal the heart beneath all the craziness and make a truly indelible story out of what could otherwise have been just an exercise in style.I wouldn't say Submarine is just an exercise in style - there is material here that resonates and the central metaphor (of which the title is a part) is a compelling one - but if there were moments that truly moved, they eluded me. Still, it is a very solid piece of filmmaking and a thoroughly entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.",3,Had the potential to be even better.,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,3203,"['Submarine', 'witty', 'occasionally', 'sardonic', 'film', 'shot', 'distinctly', 'Wes', 'Anderson-like', 'style', 'about', 'Oliver', 'Craig', 'Roberts', 'quirky', 'young', 'man', 'coming', 'age', 'first', 'love', 'parents', 'deteriorating', 'marriage', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'executive', 'produced', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Oliver', 'tricky', 'emotional', 'waters', 'home', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'dying', 'sheer', 'terror', 'often', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'leaving', 'less', 'responsive', 'supportive', 'girlfriend', 'would', 'like', 'Simultaneously', 'Oliver', 'sabotage', 'what', 'burgeoning', 'affair', 'mother', 'wildly', 'narcissistic', 'self-help', 'guru', 'next', 'door', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Paddy', 'Considine', '.It', 'sounds', 'unbearably', 'intense', 'material', 'narrative', 'style', 'dry', 'deadpan', 'one', 'tone', 'light', 'occasionally', 'one', 'laugh', 'loud', 'mentioned', 'style', 'pure', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'viewers', 'Anderson', 'work', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'strong', 'very', 'graphic', 'visuals', 'compositions', 'prolonged', 'set', 'pieces', 'set', 'popular', 'music', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'humor', 'heavy', 'use', 'narration.As', 'Anderson', 'work', 'see', 'here', 'director', 'very', 'much', 'command', 'material', 'film', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'expressive', 'times', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'occasionally', 'very', 'funny', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Oliver', 'mother', 'wonderful', 'usual', 'What', 'however', 'strong', 'emotional', 'core', 'one', 'truly', 'moved', 'as', 'well', 'entertained', 'weakness', 'shared', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'lesser', 'works', 'best', 'Royal', 'Tanenbaums', 'What', 'mean', 'remarkable', 'degree', 'given', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'that', 'much', 'central', 'relationships', 'Oliver', 'girlfriend', 'Oliver', 'parents', 'could', 'rot', 'one', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'worse', 'off', 'vulnerability', 'missing', 'characters', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'relatable', 'human', 'risk', 'having', 'story', 'so', 'strongly', 'stylized', 'amount', 'wit', 'charm', 'can', 'mitigate', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'taken', 'film', 'emotional', 'level', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sublime', 'moment', 'two', 'written', 'script', 'delivered', 'heart', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'moment', 'Royal', 'Tanenbaums', 'when', 'off-the-wall', 'eccentric', 'character', 'played', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'father', 'been', 'very', 'tough', 'year', 'dad', 'suddenly', 'strangeness', 'new', 'dimension', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'scared', 'lonely', 'human', 'being', 'complexity', 'moments', 'reveal', 'heart', 'craziness', 'make', 'truly', 'indelible', 'story', 'what', 'could', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'exercise', 'style.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Submarine', 'just', 'exercise', 'style', 'material', 'here', 'resonates', 'central', 'metaphor', 'title', 'part', 'compelling', 'one', 'were', 'moments', 'truly', 'moved', 'eluded', 'Still', 'very', 'solid', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'half']",Submarine

1453579,A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B005C7SXMS,T. Paslay,"[0, 0]","Submarine is an independent film with Wes Anderson undertones about a young Welsh boy and his struggles with his parents failing marriage while dealing with the trials and tribulations of his first real girlfriend.The protagonist, Oliver Tate, is a high school boy that most will find relatable. Oliver isn't popular, but he isn't unpopular either. He spends his days floating through his classes and trying not to stand out in his uniform and black wool coat. The problem is, when he develops a crush on a classmate, Jordana. Jordana is a bit of a loose cannon in a bright red coat but Oliver can't help but be drawn to her. Eventually the two are brought together and their awkward relationship begins to bloom. Oliver must now juggle his parent's sinking love-life (something that he exhibits a little too much interest in) and his first real relationship.In terms of production, the movie is paced well. However don't expect a roller coaster ride. This is a bio-pic about a young man, his girlfriend and his parents. It's a beautiful story and very relatable. You'll cringe at the awkward moments with him and Jordana. You'll shake your head at the valiant, if a little idiotic, efforts he makes to save his parents relationship. But in the end you'll know that when you were his age, you would've done (or maybe you did) the same things.Filmography is where this film really shines. I stated in the introduction that this had Wes Anderson undertones. It does, but it is anything but a Wes Anderson rip off. It has a very vintage feel (it takes place in the 80s I think) and the color palettes are very deliberate and well done.

1453580,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005C7SXMS,Turfseer,"[4, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***If you're a fan of quirky indie films such as 'Harold and Maude' or anything by quirky indie director Wes Anderson, then first-time director Richard Ayoade's 'Submarine' is for you. As for the rest of us, better to find something more rooted in a sensible, historical reality. This is not to say that Mr. Ayoade is not without talent. His background is in music video as well as being well known for his comic performance on a British TV show, 'The IT Crowd'. Ayoade does wonders with the camera, turning his Welsh urban landscape into a veritable palette of most inviting sights and sounds.Unfortunately, Ayoade drew his inspiration from the 2008 novel of the same name, by Joe Dunthorne. While I haven't read the novel, I'm told that the film sticks fairly closely to the novel's plot, which features the unlikeable protagonist, Oliver Tate (played by Craig Roberts, who bears a striking resemblance to another famous quirky character, Bud Cort, of 'Harold and Maude' fame). Roberts has Oliver offering up an almost deadpan, monosyllabic delivery throughout the film, which some may find to be cool or amusing, but for me it's symptomatic of Submarine's overall monotonous tone.Submarine's main problem is that it's protagonist, Oliver, is not endearing at all. Most 'coming-of-age' stories feature protagonists who are basically good people with one characteristic flaw. In Oliver's case, it's the opposite: most of his actions are cruel and he fails to have his grand epiphany until the film's denouement.Set in the mid-80s in Wales, we're introduced to Oliver as he's fantasizing what his community's response would be, had he passed away at his current age of fifteen. If that isn't morbid enough, it gets worse when Oliver decides to impress Jordana, a schoolmate he has a crush on, by bullying another overweight schoolmate, Zoe, who ends up falling into a pond as a result of Oliver's taunts. To make matters worse, Oliver types up a manual for Zoe, advising her how not to be a victim and delivers it to her only friend, only to discover that Zoe has left school and moved as a result of all the bullying.Oliver and Jordana become victims of bullying themselves, after Jordana takes Polaroid pictures of Oliver and her kissing, and distributes them to classmates in order to make an ex-boyfriend jealous. As a result of their new found isolation, the two become closer. While well-intentioned, Oliver's continuous clueless actions cannot be excused because he's old enough to know right from wrong. At one point, after reading a book that offers the opinion that children are able to cope with death better as a result of experiencing the death of their own pets, Oliver considers poisoning Jordana's dog so that she can cope with her mother's impending death from a recent terminal cancer diagnosis. Oliver alienates Jordana further when he decides it's a better idea to leave Jordana alone as she copes with her stricken mother in the hospital.The second part of the 'Submarine' plot involves Oliver's suspicions that his mother has been having an affair with next-door neighbor Graham Purvis, a new-age Guru, who peddles a wacky 'system' involving emotions and the color spectrum. Oliver's Dad is a depressed marine biologist who hardly seems upset when Oliver informs him that his mother might be having an affair. Oliver engages in the creepy surveillance of his mother and Graham at a New Year's Eve party at the beach. Later, he spies Graham and his mother entering Graham's trailer together and assumes the worst. There's more bad conduct from Oliver when he gets drunk and attempts to trash Graham's home, before passing out.It's supposed to be funny when Oliver's parents coddle the wayward Oliver after the break-in as well as the mother admitting that she gave Graham a 'hand job', but at the same time indicating that she and her husband were reconciling (remember, anything can happen in a movie with 'quirky' characters!).After all of Oliver's troublesome conduct during the film, director Ayoade wants us to conclude that ""youths will be youths"". Somehow, all the bad behavior is not so bad after all, since clueless Oliver was well-intentioned at the same time. Oliver's 'reward' at film's end is the implied reconciliation with love interest, Jordana. But there is little remorse from Oliver, who really needs to make up for all his bad conduct, especially the bullying he engaged in with his formerly besieged and ostracized classmate.For all those who are enamored with these type of films featuring 'quirky' characters, I can only point out that they seem to operate in their own separate but dubious moral universe. Admire 'Submarine' for its neat cinematography and clever editing, but please recognize that such tomes add nothing to the pantheon of true art house fare.",2,"Quirky, unlikeable protagonist populates

This movie is a bittersweet and imaginative account of a teenager and his first love plus dealing with his dysfunctional parents.  It's funny but not in that Ben Stiller sort of way, which is confusing since it looks like they tried to market this film as a Ben Stiller production and therefore, it's more like There's Something About Mary or more of an ""in your face"" comedy, which this film isn't.The film has a lot of narration and I was watching at a low volume, but I imagined Richard Ayoade actually voicing this, since he wrote the adapted screenplay.  It's close to his IT Crowd voice, the wit of it.  It also has a great use of color, since one of the characters, Graham Purvis, uses color to heal and I find the splitting of the story into parts helps with the narration of the lead character.I don't find this much like the movie Rushmore, which I see it's been compared too.  I didn't find Rushmore laugh out loud funny, more situational funny and I laughed out loud at Submarine and a lot of the narrative.It's got a nice submarine metaphor throughout, using water to convey emotions.

1453582,A4YXKE5F62II8,B005C7SXMS,Visual Bureau,"[0, 1]","""Submarine, the directorial debut by The I.T. Crowd's Richard Ayoade (who also starred in the recent film, The Watch), tells the story of a young man named Oliver Tate who is entangled by the complexities he has with the relationships of his love interest, Jordana Brewster, his quiet oceanography professor for a father, and Oliver's mother willing to date someone else other than her husband.The film, as a whole, prides on a quirky whimsy evident in much of the works of Wes Anderson (Rushmore brings into mind) and French New Wave cinema with its experimental shots of emotion and character. It is not entirely certain if Ayoade made the script with this intention or the novel characterises much of the craziness within Tate's mind. If it is one way or the other, the film is delightfully well done (in terms of cinematography, choice of music, and colour scheme), snappy, witty (in a dry way), and consistent enough to hold its own ground with its slightly schizophrenic perspective of a teenager's mentality. The film does suffer a bit with moments of too much distance and whimsical silence by its characters that it makes them a bit cartoonish.However, the film is nonetheless more realistic, more to heart, and less sporadic than many of its modern counterparts (i.e. Superbad, Project X). In addition, the film's strong collaboration with the production team from Film4 (part of Channel 4) and Warp Films make for a work that is not only interesting but, moreover, something definitive of their established brands.""",4,"A well-done, light-hearted debut for a comedy that explores much into the mind of many timid, intelligent teenagers",1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1526,"['Submarine', 'directorial', 'debut', 'I.T', 'Crowd', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'recent', 'film', 'Watch', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Oliver', 'Tate', 'who', 'entangled', 'complexities', 'relationships', 'love', 'interest', 'Jordana', 'Brewster', 'quiet', 'oceanography', 'professor', 'father', 'Oliver', 'mother', 'willing', 'date', 'someone', 'else', 'other', 'husband.The', 'film', 'whole', 'prides', 'quirky', 'whimsy', 'evident', 'much', 'works', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Rushmore', 'mind', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'cinema', 'experimental', 'shots', 'emotion', 'character', 'not', 'entirely', 'certain', 'Ayoade', 'made', 'script', 'intention', 'novel', 'characterises', 'much', 'craziness', 'Tate', 'mind', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'film', 'delightfully', 'well', 'done', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'choice', 'music', 'colour', 'scheme', 'snappy', 'witty', 'dry', 'way', 'consistent', 'enough', 'hold', 'own', 'ground', 'slightly', 'schizophrenic', 'perspective', 'teenager', 'mentality', 'film', 'suffer', 'bit', 'moments', 'too', 'much', 'distance', 'whimsical', 'silence', 'characters', 'bit', 'cartoonish.However', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'more', 'realistic', 'more', 'heart', 'less', 'sporadic', 'many', 'modern', 'counterparts', 'i.e', 'Superbad', 'Project', 'X', 'addition', 'film', 'strong', 'collaboration', 'production', 'team', 'Film4', 'part', 'Channel', '4', 'Warp', 'Films', 'make', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'interesting', 'moreover', 'something', 'definitive', 'established', 'brands']",Submarine
1453583,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B005C7SXMS,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[1, 2]","At first viewing, you might think SUBMARINE is a film produced for teenagers going thru COMING OF AGE problems, ie first serious relationship, changing relationships with parents, being harassed by school chums, etc. However, NOBODY really has a youth like this. The film's characters and their situations are idealized, exaggerated stereotypes. SUBMARINE centers around Young Oliver, and his problems stemming from his self absorbed, self reflective philosophizing of his life. Oliver's EYE is the film itself, a film that cleverly shows Oliver agonizing over relationships, family and depression. His self reflective, artistic world is revealed thru the device of films within films. Oliver is constantly OBSERVING his world, filming with his eyes, just as we are observing him as the movie viewer. For example, you have the ""student film"" scene of the two young lovers running on the beach, filmed in super 8 style, all shakey, overexposed, etc. Various dreams and daydreams work as film within film as well. His girlfriend intuitively understands and promotes the process, forcing Oliver to take polaroids of their FIRST KISS, and record it immediately into his diary. Almost NOTHING happens in the film without Oliver being in, or being shown observing the scene. If you enjoy a movie that's a ""Visualized Confessional Diary"", employing symbolism, both blatant and subtle, then you're sure to enjoy this movie. Its not as surreal as some films of this genre become (SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD comes to mind), but there's enough creativity with the cinematic motifs, to keep the age old theme of FIRST LOVE fresh.The film is called SUBMARINE for a good reason...everybody in the film is sinking into their own inner ocean of depression at some point. The main characters, and their setting, are all strongly connected to the ocean. From the father's job as oceanographer, the huge fish tank in Oliver's house dominating the domestic scenes, the shots of Oliver with and without his girlfriend contemplating the ocean while depressed, the daydreams of drowning, Oliver's slow movement into the ocean at the film's end, and the constant reminder that the ocean is ""6 miles deep"", the symbol of the OCEAN is the motor driving the film's plot. Each of the characters are in a SUBMARINE, six miles deep, and disconnected from each other. Getting OUT of their submarines, and discovering healthy human relationships, is the GOAL of the characters. As the true antagonist, the ocean represents the self-indulgent, over-emotional qualities of a teenager (or adults acting out their teenage dreams). If you took the symbolism out of the film, it would be a rather ordinary, boring look at two teenagers in crisis, and their families. What makes this film cool, is this intricate, intriguing use of symbolism, from the point of view of OLIVER as a young artist both sinking into, and floating upon, the Ocean of feelings he struggles with thruout the film. SUBMARINE will take you someplace deep, if you're willing to take the trip.",5,The Celtic Romance with YOUNG LOVE,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,3026,"['first', 'viewing', 'might', 'think', 'SUBMARINE', 'film', 'produced', 'teenagers', 'going', 'thru', 'COMING', 'OF', 'AGE', 'problems', 'ie', 'first', 'serious', 'relationship', 'changing', 'relationships', 'parents', 'being', 'harassed', 'school', 'chums', 'etc', 'However', 'NOBODY', 'really', 'youth', 'film', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'idealized', 'exaggerated', 'stereotypes', 'SUBMARINE', 'centers', 'Young', 'Oliver', 'problems', 'stemming', 'self', 'absorbed', 'reflective', 'philosophizing', 'life', 'Oliver', 'EYE', 'film', 'film', 'cleverly', 'Oliver', 'agonizing', 'relationships', 'family', 'depression', 'self', 'reflective', 'artistic', 'world', 'revealed', 'device', 'films', 'films', 'Oliver', 'constantly', 'OBSERVING', 'world', 'filming', 'eyes', 'just', 'are', 'observing', 'movie', 'viewer', 'example', 'have', 'student', 'film', 'scene', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'running', 'beach', 'filmed', 'super', '8', 'style', 'shakey', 'overexposed', 'etc', 'Various', 'dreams', 'daydreams', 'work', 'film', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'girlfriend', 'intuitively', 'understands', 'process', 'forcing', 'Oliver', 'take', 'polaroids', 'FIRST', 'KISS', 'record', 'immediately', 'diary', 'Almost', 'NOTHING', 'film', 'Oliver', 'being', 'being', 'shown', 'observing', 'scene', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Visualized', 'Confessional', 'Diary', 'employing', 'symbolism', 'blatant', 'subtle', 'then', ""'re"", 'sure', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'surreal', 'films', 'genre', 'become', 'SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'VS', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'mind', 'enough', 'creativity', 'cinematic', 'motifs', 'keep', 'age', 'old', 'theme', 'FIRST', 'LOVE', 'fresh.The', 'film', 'called', 'SUBMARINE', 'good', 'reason', 'everybody', 'film', 'sinking', 'own', 'inner', 'ocean', 'depression', 'point', 'main', 'characters', 'setting', 'are', 'strongly', 'connected', 'ocean', 'father', 'job', 'oceanographer', 'huge', 'fish', 'tank', 'Oliver', 'house', 'dominating', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'shots', 'Oliver', 'girlfriend', 'contemplating', 'ocean', 'depressed', 'daydreams', 'drowning', 'Oliver', 'slow', 'movement', 'ocean', 'film', 'end', 'constant', 'reminder', 'ocean', '6', 'miles', 'deep', 'symbol', 'OCEAN', 'motor', 'driving', 'film', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'SUBMARINE', 'six', 'miles', 'deep', 'disconnected', 'other', 'Getting', 'OUT', 'submarines', 'discovering', 'healthy', 'human', 'relationships', 'GOAL', 'characters', 'true', 'antagonist', 'ocean', 'self-indulgent', 'over-emotional', 'qualities', 'teenager', 'adults', 'acting', 'out', 'teenage', 'dreams', 'took', 'symbolism', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'boring', 'look', 'two', 'teenagers', 'crisis', 'families', 'What', 'film', 'cool', 'intricate', 'intriguing', 'use', 'symbolism', 'point', 'view', 'OLIVER', 'young', 'artist', 'sinking', 'floating', 'upon', 'Ocean', 'feelings', 'film', 'SUBMARINE', 'will', 'take', 'someplace', 'deep', ""'re"", 'willing', 'take', 'trip']",Submarine

The story centers around 15-year-old Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), who suffers through the pangs of adolescence which includes seeing his parents' marriage about to crumble (mom Jill is played by Sally Hawkins and dad Lloyd is played by Noah Taylor). This fact is not helped when mom's ex-boyfriend becomes their next-door neighbor.As he struggles with this issue, Oliver is also facing problems at school - he is not the most popular kid, and becomes romantically attracted to Jordana Bevan (Yasmin Paige), a dark-haired beauty who is not above tormenting the weaker ones amongst the student population. Despite this, Oliver is hopelessly drawn to Jordana and goes about trying to win her heart.Frankly, I did not find the central characters very likable, but the storyline is interesting and the cast does a credible job in their respective performances. It is amazing what a good ensemble cast can bring to a production, and Submarine fares well as a result.
