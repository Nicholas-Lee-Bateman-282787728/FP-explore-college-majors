232834,A1TC2OKW6XQIWK,6300268845,Brian W.,"[6, 7]","This is one of those little-seen gems of '70s American cinema that always seem to pop up (although maybe it's no longer accurate to say this film is little-seen, since it's been on DVD for three years).  With films like this, it's always tempting to cry ""lost masterpiece!"" but in this case, while the movie is very interesting and worthwhile, to call it a masterpiece would be  hyperbole.  The chief pleasures derived from two hours spent with SCARECROW are (1) the fascinating interplay between actors Gene Hackman (doing a variation on the tightly-wound jerk we've seen him play many times) and Al Pacino (revelatory as a friendly drifter whose warmth and good humor is a far cry from the typical Pacino role) and (2) the gorgeous photography from master cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, a name that should be familiar to all fans of '70s cinema.  As Hackman and Pacino amble across American backroads, hopping trains and hiking through hills, Zsigmond's lens tints everything with a shade of magic.  The episodic plot sets the pair on individual personal journeys (Hackman wants success in business, Pacino wants a reunion with his family) as well as collaborative ones.  It is great fun to watch Pacino's warmth rub off on Hackman as he becomes steadily less grumpy.  Because this was the '70s and pessimism was the order of the day, the film ends on an ambiguously dour note, but what lingers for the viewer is the ramshackle charm and beauty of the film's pleasant meanderings.",3,"Hackman, Pacino, and America",1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,1484,"['one', 'little-seen', 'gems', ""'70s"", 'American', 'cinema', 'always', 'seem', 'pop', 'up', 'maybe', 'no', 'longer', 'accurate', 'say', 'film', 'little-seen', 'been', 'DVD', 'three', 'years', 'films', 'always', 'tempting', 'cry', 'lost', 'masterpiece', 'case', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'be', 'hyperbole', 'chief', 'pleasures', 'derived', 'two', 'hours', 'spent', 'SCARECROW', 'are', '1', 'fascinating', 'interplay', 'actors', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'doing', 'variation', 'tightly-wound', 'jerk', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'many', 'times', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'revelatory', 'friendly', 'drifter', 'warmth', 'good', 'humor', 'far', 'cry', 'typical', 'Pacino', 'role', '2', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'master', 'cinematographer', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'name', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'fans', ""'70s"", 'cinema', 'Hackman', 'Pacino', 'amble', 'American', 'backroads', 'hopping', 'trains', 'hiking', 'hills', 'Zsigmond', 'lens', 'tints', 'everything', 'shade', 'magic', 'episodic', 'plot', 'pair', 'individual', 'personal', 'journeys', 'Hackman', 'success', 'business', 'Pacino', 'reunion', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'collaborative', 'ones', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'Pacino', 'warmth', 'rub', 'off', 'Hackman', 'steadily', 'less', 'grumpy', 'was', ""'70s"", 'pessimism', 'was', 'order', 'day', 'film', 'ambiguously', 'dour', 'note', 'what', 'viewer', 'ramshackle', 'charm', 'beauty', 'film', 'pleasant', 'meanderings']",N/A
232835,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,6300268845,Carlos Rodriguez,"[16, 17]","This is without a doubt a lost gem that never found an audience like the description reads. This little seen movie was one of the best acting vehicles for its stars. Gene Hackman and Al Pacino deliver great and heartfelt performances as two drifters who are seen as losers and they themselves especially Lion, Pacino's character thinks of himself as one of them. This film reminded me of John Steinbeck's classic novel ""Of Mice and Men"" who was brought to the screen in 1994 with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich in the title roles. Pacino is Lenny in my eyes as he has the same innocent and childlike behavior that Lenny has in the film and story. Hackman is George, the strong of the two who is less of a dreamer and more practical than Pacino's character. The two of them although at odds with each other during most of the course of the movie did not get along when they were filming this classic film. They argued and disagreed a lot on the set from what I have it read... however you never saw a bit of animosity between the two of them as their superb acting and professionalism shone through out the film. If you have never seen this movie... this would be a good opportunity to purchase this film and see not only a great, classic movie of the 1970's but also the highlight for me anyway... is two see two masters of the acting craft battle it out in front of your eyes with their amazing gift and talent. SCARECROW,is a winner and you won't be disappointed to add this classic movie to your collection. Special thanks go to the company that decided to finally release this great film on DVD it was about time.",5,Finally this great film is out on DVD it's about time.,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,1617,"['doubt', 'lost', 'gem', 'never', 'found', 'audience', 'description', 'little', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'vehicles', 'stars', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'deliver', 'great', 'heartfelt', 'performances', 'two', 'drifters', 'who', 'are', 'seen', 'losers', 'especially', 'Lion', 'Pacino', 'character', 'thinks', 'one', 'film', 'reminded', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'classic', 'novel', 'Mice', 'Men', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', '1994', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'title', 'roles', 'Pacino', 'Lenny', 'eyes', 'same', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'Lenny', 'film', 'story', 'Hackman', 'George', 'strong', 'two', 'who', 'less', 'dreamer', 'more', 'practical', 'Pacino', 'character', 'two', 'odds', 'other', 'most', 'course', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'when', 'were', 'filming', 'classic', 'film', 'argued', 'disagreed', 'lot', 'set', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'however', 'never', 'saw', 'bit', 'animosity', 'two', 'superb', 'acting', 'professionalism', 'shone', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'opportunity', 'purchase', 'film', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'classic', 'movie', '1970', 'also', 'highlight', 'anyway', 'two', 'see', 'two', 'masters', 'acting', 'craft', 'battle', 'out', 'front', 'eyes', 'amazing', 'gift', 'talent', 'SCARECROW', 'winner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'add', 'classic', 'movie', 'collection', 'Special', 'thanks', 'go', 'company', 'decided', 'finally', 'release', 'great', 'film', 'DVD', 'was', 'time']",N/A
232836,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6300268845,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[12, 14]","Having read a decent amount of opinions about the film Scarecrow (1973), I've noticed quite a few differing thoughts with regards to how specific visuals and elements were interpreted, but the one aspect that many seem to agree upon is this is a vastly underrated feature, one that might have gotten lost in the shuffle specifically because the two main actors, Gene Hackman and Al Pacino had both just recently (at the time) appeared in landmark films The French Connection (1971) and The Godfather (1972), respectively.  Directed by Jerry Schatzberg (The Panic in Needle Park, Honeysuckle Rose), the film includes performances by Dorothy Tristan (Klute, Rollercoaster), Ann Wedgeworth (Bang the Drum Slowly, My Science Project), Richard Lynch (The Seven-Ups, The Sword and the Sorcerer), Penelope Allen (Dog Day Afternoon), and Eileen Brennan (The Sting, Murder by Death), as a nasty, drunken floozy with a big mouth.Hackman and Pacino play the characters Max Millan and Francis Lionel 'Lion' Delbuchi, respectively, who are two drifters that hook up with each other in the backwoods of California, both headed east as Max, who was recently released from prison, has plans on opening a carwash in Pittsburgh while Francis, who completed a stint at sea, is returning home to Detroit to meet his child for the first time and make some sort of amends to his wife (apparently after his wife got pregnant, Francis got scared, ran off, and joined up with the merchant marines).  Anyway, the two couldn't be more different...Max is a gruff, belligerent, short-tempered, mean-spirited, uptight cuss who likes to crack heads, take naps, and doesn't do anything without a plan while Francis is a likeable go with the flow sort, one who enjoys the spotlight if only to make people laugh (he believes you don't have to hit people if you can make them laugh).  As I said, the two hook up on the road through a chance meeting, and Max immediately decides to make Francis a partner in his upcoming business venture, that being opening a carwash in Pittsburgh.  Seems Max, who's been in the joint for the last six years, has been saving every penny and depositing it in a bank, fastidiously planning every aspect of the operation, pouring over every detail to the point of committing them to memory.  As the pair hitch rides, jump trains, and hoof it by foot eastward, they have their ups and downs, eventually making their way to Denver to stop off and see Max's sister Coley (Tristan).  Times are good, but quickly sour as Max gets both himself and Francis chucked in the can for a thirty-day stint after a barroom brawl (Max ends up blaming Francis for convincing him to deviate from his `plans', and subsequently the pair are now on the `outs').  Francis makes friends quickly with a trustee (played by Lynch), earning himself some relatively easy work assignments (along with some unwanted attentions), while Max's standoffishness earns him a trip to Pigville (the county pig farm), shoveling manure.  Eventually the men reconnect, are released from prison, and back on the road, headed for Detroit for a reunion of sorts with Francis' estranged wife and child...If you're looking for a straightforward type of story, one that has a distinctive beginning, middle, and an end, then you'd best pass this film up.  This is purely a character driven drama with comedic underpinnings, one that, like life itself, tends to get a little messy.  The real treat here is watching these two fine actors play off each other, something director Schatzberg encourages given the length of some of the scenes and the unrestrictive atmosphere in general throughout the feature.  I'll admit, initially I was a little wary about the pairing of Hackman and Pacino in this sort of `buddy buddy' road picture, but the two completely immerse themselves in their roles, creating a pair of completely believable and identifiable characters.  I thought Hackman did particularly well presenting an overly retentive, rigid, suspicious, angry at the world individual obsessed with sticking to his plan, his confidence stemming from the very fact that it was so well thought out (by himself) it couldn't possible fail.  There's an exchange in the film that really helps put his character in perspective, as Francis relates how once in Catholic school he got the palm of his hand smacked by a nun with a ruler for clowning around.Max: How come you didn't pound that old lady in the mouth?Francis: What old lady?Max: The one that hit you in the palm with the stick.Francis: She was a nun!I thought Pacino also did very well as in his role as the easy going, trusting, sociable type that's everyone's friend, a bit naive at times, always handy with a joke or a pratfall, whose main goal in life seems to try and resolve a past indiscretion that seems to have haunted him for awhile, that of leaving his wife in the lurch (he did send her whatever money he could over the years, but that was more or less out of an effort of support, and not one of amends).  At some point he realized the only way to excise the demon that plagues him is to confront it, which is why he's headed to Detroit.  The characters are obviously from different ends of the spectrum, but, in their differences, they create sort of a `ying and yang', as Max is the driven man with the plan, along with being the streetwise protector of the pair, his edge slightly offset by Francis' ability to enjoy each moment in the here and now (Max allows Francis quite a bit of leeway in terms of Francis poking fun at Max only because he sees Francis as sort of a child, one whose only desire is to please).  My favorite sequence in the film comes while the pair is in prison, after their falling out.  Despite the fact that they're now at odds, the bond is still there as Max dishes out the retribution after Francis discovers his new friends like him more than for his comedic repartee.  As I said, there's not much of a story here, but I found the characters, relationships, and performances fascinating enough to keep me entertained throughout the nearly two hour running time.  The ending is sort of downbeat, and offers very little in the way of resolution, but if you can get past this, you might want to check this movie out.  It was definitely worth my time.The picture quality on this DVD release is decent, presented in widescreen (2.40:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through reasonably well (it did seem a little soft at times).  As far as extras, there are English, Spanish, and French subtitles, an original theatrical trailer, and a vintage featurette for the film entitled ""On the Road"" (3:48).Cookieman108By the way, another scene worth seeing this film for is when Max strips off his clothes in order to go to bed...he's wearing like ten shirts, and watching him remove them is like watching the clowns come out of the little car at the circus.  For those interested, the cinematographer on the film was Vilmos Zsigmond, who also did such features as Deliverance, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and The Deer Hunter.",5,"""For every car,

232840,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,6300268845,Green Manalishi,"[2, 2]","One of the best I've seen in a long time.  While filming is beautiful from the start, it took a little while for me to be sure I was really on board with the characters.  Hackman is so prickly in the beginning, and  Pacino's scarecrow solilique (""The scarecrow makes 'em laugh.."") had me wondering.  By the time they get thrown in the house of detentions, you're thinking what a nice guy Pacino is and how unreasonable is Hackman.. who ends up on a pigfarm.  What a reverse the film suddenly takes after that!  Suddenly, Hackman's stand-offish ways seem to make a little more sense!But sure, Pacino was the charmer. Hackman was also interesting in his own loyalty and focused determination.  One or two scenes may have been a bit over the top (Hackman strip-teasing in that greasy diner to show Pacino he's not gonna get in another fight?).  Still, this movie was a real work of genius.  It seems to teach something:  Pacino's art of defusing a potential situation (the scarecrow) and Hackman's determination - or as it would manifest in his life (outside of his dreams) - too ready for a fight.  The movie is a character study and a study of human nature.

From California to Philadelphia a pair of drifter-losers plan their future building the isolated pieces of a broken living without many expectations in the middle term future. The wings if the hopeless make its work in the desperate souls of these men literally overcome by the hard challenge of living. Curious parable: from West to East in the same way that just four years before two outlaw men make a parallel road in Easy Rider. This long journey will allow us to explore once more the aridity emotional and affective of two men in the edge of the fall.

I do not think it is exaggerate to conclude this has been the best achievement of Gene Hackman in his career and the sixth best acting of Pacino after Godfather II, Scent of a woman, Justice for all, Dog day afternoon  and Carlitos way in that decreasing order.I insist: it is not a easy film. But it is plenty of details that work out so efficiently that you will remind it for a long, long time.

232846,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6300268845,Luke Killion,"[2, 2]","""Scarecrow"" is a 1973 film starring the buddy duo of Al Pacino (Francis Lionel Debuchi) and Gene Hackman (Max Millan) on the road in the midwest.  This movie was definately a departure from each actor's previous successes, as they both starred in stories about organized crime, but playing characters on different ends of the law. For Hackman, his rendition of Popeye Doyle in ""The French Connection"" in 1971 is perhaps one of the first outstanding cop movies in the age of color motion pictures. Pacino's role in ""The Godfather"" in 1972 is usually considered the best movie ever made about the mafia, despite the legions of pictures and cable television series that have been made after it, which have the benefit of more information about organized crime and higher quality of resources for writing and production. That the early 70's films have held up to all currently styled projects says alot about their importance in giving all modern filmakers points of reference and creative influence.""Scarecrow"" is an especially unique film, which I believe holds up to the test of time in the same fashion as the starring duo's other movies, despite its relative obscurity. It was a total departure from their work prior to the 1973 release at the Cannes Film Festival in the south of France. The film says alot about the road pathos of the hippie generation and the belief in freedom that was an all important aspect of most people's existence back then.  This is a somewhat curious contradiction at times, as the characters' quest for spontaneous thrills on the road have some dramatic legal consequences, which in turn threaten that very freedom that is necessary for the unbroken spirit that is personified in Gene Hackman's Max. Pacino plays a shy sailor recently returned from five years at sea, looking to reunite with his estranged wife and son. Even though Max is an ex con, his hard boiled demeanor and street smarts make him the natural leader of the pair (he is also noticably older, making him much more experienced).This is one of those films that I had never heard of (being born ten years after the release date), but I could tell it touched a nerve in the psyche of times and spirit of freedom through a semi-rootless existence, hoping to find the gold at the end of the rainbow, so to speak. The viewer finds out that the style of character development is very reminiscent of Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady's buddy duo in ""On the Road"", as Max and Lionel could definately be described as ""beat"" in several senses of the word, as they scrape together money for multiple rounds at highway pubs and hitch rides in flatbad pickup trucks.There is alot of wishing in this movie; the characters' lives are so far from perfect but both Hackman and Pacino create  unique personalities that seemed to click instantly at the beginning of the film, as they stand on opposite sides of a deserted midwestern road, looking at eachother suspiciously. This scene sets the tone for the whole movie, as the theme of trust is paramount; the friendship that evolves is never cemented in certainty, but the dynamics are constantly shifting, as they serve as an essential counter balance to one another. Max has the obvious knowledge of how to survive on the road, but his hard headed stubborness and propensity for brawling require a calming influence if he is to avoid another jail sentence. Pacino's character provides this perfectly, as he intuitively knows how to reel Max in, just as Max knows how to break Lionel of his shell.The viewer is never quite sure which one will end up on top, or what the exact motives are for the entering into a tentative business partnership/friendship (they plan on travelling to Pittsburgh to open a carwash). The ending to this film is an obvious commentary upon the toll this kind of life can take on the mind, and that if one is to survive, they must have it together mentally as well as physically.",5,Great road flick starring Hackman and Pacino,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,3932,"['Scarecrow', '1973', 'film', 'starring', 'buddy', 'duo', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Francis', 'Lionel', 'Debuchi', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Max', 'Millan', 'road', 'midwest', 'movie', 'was', 'definately', 'departure', 'actor', 'previous', 'successes', 'starred', 'stories', 'organized', 'crime', 'playing', 'characters', 'different', 'ends', 'law', 'Hackman', 'rendition', 'Popeye', 'Doyle', 'French', 'Connection', '1971', 'perhaps', 'one', 'first', 'outstanding', 'cop', 'movies', 'age', 'color', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Pacino', 'role', 'Godfather', '1972', 'usually', 'considered', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'mafia', 'legions', 'pictures', 'cable', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'have', 'benefit', 'more', 'information', 'organized', 'crime', 'higher', 'quality', 'resources', 'writing', 'production', 'early', '70', 'films', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'currently', 'styled', 'projects', 'alot', 'importance', 'giving', 'modern', 'filmakers', 'points', 'reference', 'creative', 'influence', 'Scarecrow', 'especially', 'unique', 'film', 'believe', 'test', 'time', 'same', 'fashion', 'starring', 'duo', 'other', 'movies', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'was', 'total', 'departure', 'work', 'prior', '1973', 'release', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'south', 'France', 'film', 'alot', 'road', 'pathos', 'hippie', 'generation', 'belief', 'freedom', 'was', 'important', 'aspect', 'most', 'people', 'existence', 'back', 'then', 'somewhat', 'curious', 'contradiction', 'times', 'characters', 'quest', 'spontaneous', 'thrills', 'road', 'have', 'dramatic', 'legal', 'consequences', 'turn', 'threaten', 'very', 'freedom', 'necessary', 'unbroken', 'spirit', 'personified', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Max', 'Pacino', 'shy', 'sailor', 'recently', 'returned', 'five', 'years', 'sea', 'looking', 'reunite', 'estranged', 'wife', 'son', 'Even', 'Max', 'ex', 'con', 'hard', 'boiled', 'demeanor', 'street', 'smarts', 'make', 'natural', 'leader', 'pair', 'also', 'noticably', 'older', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'experienced', '.This', 'one', 'films', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'being', 'born', 'ten', 'years', 'release', 'date', 'could', 'tell', 'touched', 'nerve', 'psyche', 'times', 'spirit', 'freedom', 'semi-rootless', 'existence', 'hoping', 'find', 'gold', 'end', 'rainbow', 'so', 'speak', 'viewer', 'out', 'style', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'buddy', 'duo', 'Road', 'Max', 'Lionel', 'could', 'definately', 'be', 'described', 'beat', 'several', 'senses', 'word', 'scrape', 'together', 'money', 'multiple', 'rounds', 'highway', 'pubs', 'hitch', 'rides', 'flatbad', 'pickup', 'alot', 'wishing', 'movie', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'perfect', 'Hackman', 'Pacino', 'create', 'unique', 'personalities', 'seemed', 'click', 'instantly', 'beginning', 'film', 'stand', 'opposite', 'sides', 'deserted', 'midwestern', 'road', 'looking', 'eachother', 'suspiciously', 'scene', 'tone', 'whole', 'movie', 'theme', 'trust', 'paramount', 'friendship', 'never', 'cemented', 'certainty', 'dynamics', 'are', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'serve', 'essential', 'counter', 'balance', 'one', 'Max', 'obvious', 'knowledge', 'how', 'survive', 'road', 'hard', 'headed', 'stubborness', 'propensity', 'brawling', 'require', 'calming', 'influence', 'avoid', 'jail', 'sentence', 'Pacino', 'character', 'perfectly', 'intuitively', 'how', 'reel', 'Max', 'just', 'Max', 'how', 'break', 'Lionel', 'shell.The', 'viewer', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'one', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'top', 'what', 'exact', 'motives', 'are', 'entering', 'tentative', 'business', 'partnership/friendship', 'plan', 'travelling', 'Pittsburgh', 'open', 'carwash', 'ending', 'film', 'obvious', 'commentary', 'toll', 'kind', 'life', 'can', 'take', 'mind', 'one', 'survive', 'must', 'have', 'together', 'mentally', 'as', 'well', 'physically']",N/A

Gene Hackman plays Max, a cynical ex-con who just wants to get to Pittsburgh, and start a car wash business. While walking along the side of the road, hoping to hitch a ride to his destination, Max happens upon Francis (played with deft emotional poignancy by Al Pacino). Francis is also hitch-hiking, trying to get back to Detroit, to re-unite with the spouse that he abandoned when she got pregnant.This movie moves along at a leisurely pace, as Max and Francis gradually become friends, despite their very different personalities. The two men become embroiled in several misadventures along their journey, even getting put in a prison farm for a month. The prison stint sorely tests Max and Francis' friendship. But, both men discover that the loyalty they develop to each other, transcends the chaos that threatens to tear these two pals apart.Scarecrow was made back when movies with intense character studies, were much more common than they are now. And this film is among the best made in the 70s, regarding the complexity of the main characters. Gene Hackman is superb as the world-weary, cantankerous Max. Al Pacino gives one of the best performances of his career, as the cheerful, yet achingly vulnerable Francis.If you like films that have plenty of substance, intriguing characters, and splendid acting, then you owe it to yourself to see Scarecrow.",5,"Superb, deeply poignant film.",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1424,"['Scarecrow', 'film', 'human', 'longing', 'change', 'growth', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Max', 'cynical', 'ex-con', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'Pittsburgh', 'start', 'car', 'wash', 'business', 'walking', 'side', 'road', 'hoping', 'hitch', 'ride', 'destination', 'Max', 'Francis', 'played', 'deft', 'emotional', 'poignancy', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Francis', 'also', 'hitch-hiking', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'Detroit', 're-unite', 'spouse', 'abandoned', 'when', 'got', 'pregnant.This', 'movie', 'moves', 'along', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'Max', 'Francis', 'gradually', 'become', 'friends', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'two', 'men', 'become', 'embroiled', 'several', 'misadventures', 'journey', 'even', 'getting', 'put', 'prison', 'farm', 'month', 'prison', 'stint', 'sorely', 'Max', 'Francis', 'friendship', 'men', 'discover', 'loyalty', 'develop', 'other', 'chaos', 'tear', 'two', 'pals', 'apart.Scarecrow', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'when', 'movies', 'intense', 'character', 'studies', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'are', 'now', 'film', 'best', 'made', '70s', 'regarding', 'complexity', 'main', 'characters', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'superb', 'world-weary', 'cantankerous', 'Max', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'cheerful', 'yet', 'achingly', 'vulnerable', 'Francis.If', 'like', 'films', 'have', 'plenty', 'substance', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'splendid', 'acting', 'then', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'Scarecrow']",N/A

232853,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6300268845,Westley,"[1, 1]","Gene Hackman and Al Pacino star in this amiable but meandering buddy road picture.  The pair meets while hitchhiking in California.  Pacino has been drifting and now is making his way to Detroit to reunite with his wife and child, the latter of whom he has never met before; Hackman is a former con who has been saving money and is now heading to Pittsburgh to open a car wash.  The duo becomes fast friends and decides to go into business together.  Unfortunately, they run into trouble at every turn.""Scarecrow"" is an interesting movie - the kind that only could have been made in the early 1970s.  Hackman and Pacino are in fine form; this picture was Pacino's first since his breakthrough in ""The Godfather"" and only his fourth movie overall.  I think it demonstrates his career-long willingness to take on intriguing roles in less commercial faire.  ""Scarecrow"" has a lot of quirky humor and situations, with amusing cameos by Eileen Brennan and Ann Wedgeworth.  The picture was largely overlooked at the time, although it somewhat surprisingly won the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.  It does have the kind of nihilistic feel that the Cannes jury often likes in other American winners, such as ""Wild at Heart"" and ""Taxi Driver.""The movie, though, doesn't hold together very well in tone or plot.  There are some undeniably touching scenes that take advantage of the genuine friendship between the two men, but it gets lost among the quirkier aspects of the plot, such as Hackman doing an admittedly very funny strip-tease in a bar.  The film has much to offer and is certainly worth a look, although its slow and somewhat erratic pace will turn off some viewers.",4,"""A crow isn't afraid of a scarecrow.
