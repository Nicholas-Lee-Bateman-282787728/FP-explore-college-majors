1652462,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00CYQXH4O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[26, 29]","One of the most eagerly anticipated show on CBS's 2012 lineup had to be ""Vegas.""  An expensive period piece starring acting heavyweights Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis, the show was created by TV veteran Greg Walker and organized crime authority Nicholas Pileggi.  If you aren't familiar with Pileggi, he's best known for writing the book ""Wiseguy.""  ""Wiseguy"" was then adapted by Pileggi and Martin Scorcese into the Oscar nominated screenplay for ""Goodfellas.""  In my household, it was a no-brainer.  We were definitely going to check out this TV project with his name on it!  The debut of ""Vegas"" drew good overall numbers, but then struggled to maintain interest with the younger demographic.  As advertisers are primarily concerned with ratings information from the 18-49 age grouping, this ended up being a big problem for CBS and this high profile offering.  ""Vegas"" was knocked out of its Tuesday time slot, went on a brief hiatus, and subsequently burned off original episodes on Friday.  Canceled after its debut season, ""Vegas"" holds the distinction of being one of the highest rated regular programs to get tossed this year.  It simply didn't skew young enough!Given the opportunity, ""Vegas"" had all the potential necessary to develop into a great show.  That said, the first season struggled a bit creatively.  The show didn't know whether to be a weekly crime drama with a case to solve before the closing credits or a more involved crime saga.  To play it safe, it tried both tactics to only intermittent success.  The routine crimes were often uninspired and unimaginative.  With a thousand procedurals already on the air, we've seen it all before.  ""Vegas"" had the power to give us something different, something richer and more rewarding.  As the season progressed, though, the on-going story lines became more intriguing.  Relationships deepened and the stakes were raised dramatically.  While there was much that I admired about the show, I only really saw glimpses of greatness toward the end of the season from a narrative perspective.Dennis Quaid plays Sheriff Ralph Lamb.  Based on an actual person, Lamb was a local rancher who reluctantly stepped into law enforcement in 1960's Vegas.  In the show, he is aided by his brother (Jason O'Mara) and son (Taylor Handley).  The primary threat to the rising cityscape is the presence of organized crime.  Epitomizing that role, Michael Chiklis plays Vincent Savino.  Savino is a Chicago gangster with big ambitions, holding court at one of the town's most illustrious mob owned casinos.  Also pivotal to the cast are Carrie-Anne Moss as an upright District Attorney and Sarah Jones as a mob boss's daughter who pretty much runs Savino's casino.  My favorite moments of the series are provided by Jones and O'Mara who become an unlikely romantic pairing (Jones, in fact, as the deadpan Mia is my choice for the show's unsung MVP).  When Chiklis and Quaid share scenes, """"Vegas"" also hits its high points.  Near the end, the two even share common goals and this is when the show is at its best.  My least favorite moments generally have to do with weekly crimes that can be solved in two seconds.The cast, for the most part, is quite good.  I've been a fan of Quaid for years and I'd watch Chiklis in anything (I still miss Vic Mackey)!  But perhaps the true star of the piece is the set design, special effects, and production value.  Having lived in Vegas, I liked seeing the effects and period recreations that defined a different time.  Overall, I enjoyed this season of ""Vegas.""  It's not always a great show, but it's easy to like.  But when it is good, it is very good.

Vincent Savino - Michael Chiklis has big plans for the Savoy Casino and is give a relatively free hand as long as he keep the ""skim"" flowing back to the bosses in Chicago. Opposing Savino and his underworld methods and unsavory friends is Sheriff Ralph Lamb - Dennis Quaid. For the record I watched the entire series over a period of a month. This was my first viewing of ""Vegas"".Content:Five disks - 21 episodes - origional broadcasts 9/22/2012 to 05/10/13Positive Comments:This is one of the few TV series I looked forward to viewed each show. In addition to the main episodes narrative each character had an interesting back-story or relationship that was integrated with the weeks plot.The character of Ralph Lamb played by Dennis Quaid was based upon an actual person. In the ""extras"" on the series DVD's the real Sheriff Lamb visits the set and comments on some of his experiences during the early 1960's.The DVD is full of very interesting deleted or extended scenes and interviews. These were worth watching and not just fillers or vanity videos.The Cast:Actors Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis as lawman and casino manager/gangster respectively are outstanding in these roles.In fact I could not fault any of the supporting cast. There were a couple of ""bad-ass"" gangster types that could give you nightmares!Negative Comments:Sheriff Lamb's son, a deputy, has a romance with an attractive Mexican American woman who is the sheriff's office manager. This story line seems very contrived and was inserted to attract, apparently, a certain demographic. To this viewer it detracted from the overall story.Recommendations:This is an excellent series on several levels. It has a wonderfully talented cast of actors that seem to ""fit"" their roles with perfection. The sets have a real nice 1960's look of what, presumably, Vegas was like during that period. Almost every episode was well written and paced to a satisfying conclusion.It is a mystery to me was this series was not renewed for another season.",5,Excellent series on several levels,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2152,"['Vegas', 'Entire', 'SeriesSummary', '1959-60', 'Chicago', 'crime', 'organization', 'one', 'representatives', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'manage', 'casino', 'Vincent', 'Savino', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'big', 'plans', 'Savoy', 'Casino', 'give', 'relatively', 'free', 'hand', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'skim', 'flowing', 'back', 'bosses', 'Chicago', 'Opposing', 'Savino', 'underworld', 'methods', 'unsavory', 'friends', 'Sheriff', 'Ralph', 'Lamb', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'record', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'period', 'month', 'was', 'first', 'viewing', 'Vegas', '.Content', 'Five', 'disks', '21', 'episodes', 'origional', 'broadcasts', '9/22/2012', '05/10/13Positive', 'Comments', 'one', 'few', 'TV', 'series', 'looked', 'forward', 'viewed', 'show', 'addition', 'main', 'episodes', 'narrative', 'character', 'had', 'interesting', 'back-story', 'relationship', 'was', 'integrated', 'weeks', 'plot.The', 'character', 'Ralph', 'Lamb', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'person', 'extras', 'series', 'DVD', 'real', 'Sheriff', 'Lamb', 'set', 'comments', 'experiences', 'early', ""1960's.The"", 'DVD', 'full', 'very', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'were', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'just', 'fillers', 'vanity', 'videos.The', 'Cast', 'Actors', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'lawman', 'casino', 'manager/gangster', 'respectively', 'are', 'outstanding', 'roles.In', 'fact', 'could', 'not', 'fault', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'couple', 'bad-ass', 'gangster', 'types', 'could', 'give', 'nightmares', 'Negative', 'Comments', 'Sheriff', 'Lamb', 'son', 'deputy', 'romance', 'attractive', 'Mexican', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'sheriff', 'office', 'manager', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'contrived', 'was', 'inserted', 'attract', 'apparently', 'certain', 'demographic', 'viewer', 'detracted', 'overall', 'story.Recommendations', 'excellent', 'series', 'several', 'levels', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'cast', 'actors', 'seem', 'fit', 'roles', 'perfection', 'sets', 'have', 'real', 'nice', '1960', 'look', 'what', 'presumably', 'Vegas', 'was', 'period', 'episode', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'paced', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.It', 'mystery', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'season']",Vegas: The Edition

Yes, I understand the pressure network stations are under from the cable giants, but to waste a great premise is a tragedy. Not very authentic-visually.  When I think of Vegas, I think of sexy showgirls, prostitutes, filthy language, a sense of realism of the times. Network tv destroyed this sense.
