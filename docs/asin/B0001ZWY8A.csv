818864,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0001ZWY8A,Annie Van Auken,"[0, 0]","After an endlessly extended revival sequence in Wes Craven's 1981 TV movie CHILLER, the dead man doesn't awake until 25 minutes into the story (an even longer wait if TV ads are factored in). During a board meeting, one actress clearly has more smudged mascara on her right eye, but exiting the room she appears to be wearing none at all. Only one of several continuity goofs in this tedious clunker.The first victim of reanimated company CEO Miles is an older exec whose position is eliminated during that meeting, but the fellow croaks from nothing more nefarious than a staircase ascent and his bad heart.Later, Miles huddles by a roaring fire in an overheated room, unable to warm himself. The point being he was defrosted not only sans a soul but with ice cold blood in his veins, literally and figuratively. By this film's halfway point it's blatantly apparent that more than Miles' soul has gone AWOL: so has the viewer's interest in watching the rest of this tripe.Paul Sorvino as the priest is wasted, but so is your time if you stay tuned until the end.

Something goes awry 10 years later, and Miles thaws out prematurely. Doctors bring him back from the dead. Alas, Miles left something back in the freezer- mainly, his soul!

Smith ""Everything Fantasy & Horror""","[15, 15]","I don't normally write too many reviews, but I felt that I had to warn people before buying this particular DVD release.  If you are in the store and see Wes Craven's Chiller released by ""Quality DVD,"" walk the other way.  As a movie I'd give this about 3 stars, maybe 3.5 stars.  Its a decent story, with decent acting, basically it is an all around decent 80s psychological thriller.The premise is that Marion Creighton (Beatrice Straight) is the mother of Miles Creighton (Michael Beck).  Ten years ago he ""dies"" from a failed liver transplant.  The doctor's can't do anything to save him and she decides to cryogenically freeze her son till one day when medical science has advanced enough to help him.  Ten years later he accidently starts to thaw when his ""freezer"" mechanically fails.  The doctor's of the time are capable of saving him.  However, Miles isn't exactly the same anymore...Miles quickly begins to terrorize the people around him.  His loving mother, who is too overwhelmed with happiness at his return, doesn't realize it until it is too late what he's become.  The movie also stars Paul Sorvino as Reverend Penny, a close family friend and one of the first to question the return of Miles.Anyway, this DVD release is nearly unwatchable.  Imagine someone took an original VHS copy of Chiller, watched it a hundred times, let the neighbors dog pee on it, stuck it out in the sun for a year, then locked it in an attic for another decade, then pulled it out without bothering to dust it off, used a composite connection (I'm talking the F connector) hooked it up to a theater projector, setup a tripod with their grandmother's 3 decade old camcorder, and filmed the movie being projected, and then and only then transferred the horrendous copy remaining to a digital format, slapped it on a DVD and called it ""Quality.""The irony isn't lost on me.  Seriously, the video is horribly washed out and even pixelated, the audio is barely legible at parts, this is made worse by the lack of subtitles and/or closed caption for the hearing impaired, therefore meaning that you will actually miss parts of conversations, expecially when Stacy is speaking.  For God sake the movie actually had video frames ""ripple"" like an old abused VHS tape.If you like this movie or are even interested, DO NOT buy the ""Quality DVD"" release at any price.I wonder what it must feel like to work for a company like ""Quality"" and go home at the end of the day after producing such a low quality product like this.
