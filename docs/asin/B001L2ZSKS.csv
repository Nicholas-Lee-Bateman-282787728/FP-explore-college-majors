The movie has an awesome storyline and it really plays well in to the movie. Shia LeBlouf has really stepped into the role of the main character in movies. He is no longer the kid on Even Stevens he is grown up and everyone that didn't believe in him was dead wrong. The movie doesn't take long to get off to the thrill as 15 minutes into the movie a plane comes crashing through the window of his house. From there its nonstop action on the run and following the instructions of a computer device in order to stay alive.

1212998,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001L2ZSKS,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Eagle Eye / B001L57ZYM*Spoilers*""Eagle Eye"" isn't likely to win any major awards for a deep, compelling story or emotionally moving acting, but as a Friday night mindless fun action movie, it's everything that it should be.When two perfectly dull and normal people receive a mysterious phone call telling them they have been ""activated"" as sleeper terrorists that they didn't even know they were supposed to be, they react with realistic shock, confusion, and refusal to act. Shia's character reacts particularly realistically, certain that his chances are better with the FBI agents who have taken him into custody and only fleeing when the alternative is to be shot and killed. Equally realistically, both of the ""activated"" people react with hostility and suspicion towards the other, convinced that the other may not be as innocent as they know that they themselves are.The plot unfolds quickly and manically, with just enough ""catch up"" explanations to keep the viewer in the loop (and plenty of ""Oh, THAT's why..."" moments) without ever devolving into a derailing exposition monologue. The 'good guys' catch on to the real story much faster than in your average ""everyone must be dumb to facilitate the plot"" story and the villain behind the mysterious phone calls has a nice, if slightly predictable twist. All the acting is done surprisingly well, which is just that much more proof that an action movie doesn't require a bunch of big name actors to be decent. And I was particularly pleased that while the movie did finally succumb to the mandatory ""we have to fall in love now"" nonsense that every action/adventure movie seems to adhere to, the love interest material was kept to a severe minimum and left until the very end of the movie - a nice choice, in my opinion.""Eagle Eye"" isn't perfect, but the flaws it suffers from are the usual action-movie flaws that can't really be avoided. The super-computer shouldn't be able to tap remotely into so many devices, and I'm pretty sure that you can't remotely blow up power wires on the power grid (why would you program in that particular little ability?). Why is the experimental medicine locked in a time-case (designed to look like a bomb timer) and carried by a security detail, but the government's new powerful explosive is being sent by regular USPS? Why does the super-computer wait until everything goes wrong before attempting a back-up? And there's really no reason other than tragic suspense to have the little boy's trumpet be the trigger for the bomb - if there are speakers in that building, the computer should be able to remotely generate the necessary sound to trigger the explosives. I tried to come up with a ""first law"" reason for why this wasn't done, but considering how often the super-computer directly kills people, that explanation just doesn't seem to work.I don't know if this movie deserves accolades when compared to every movie ever made, but ""Eagle Eye"" was definitely the most fun action movie I've seen this year and I'm grateful for that.~ Ana Mardoll",4,"Fun, Mindless Action",1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,3046,"['Eagle', 'Eye', '/', 'B001L57ZYM*Spoilers*', 'Eagle', 'Eye', ""n't"", 'likely', 'win', 'major', 'awards', 'deep', 'compelling', 'story', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'acting', 'Friday', 'night', 'mindless', 'fun', 'action', 'movie', 'everything', 'should', 'be.When', 'two', 'perfectly', 'dull', 'normal', 'people', 'receive', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'call', 'telling', 'have', 'been', 'activated', 'sleeper', 'terrorists', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'react', 'realistic', 'shock', 'confusion', 'refusal', 'act', 'Shia', 'character', 'particularly', 'realistically', 'certain', 'chances', 'are', 'better', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'custody', 'only', 'fleeing', 'when', 'alternative', 'be', 'shot', 'killed', 'Equally', 'realistically', 'activated', 'people', 'react', 'hostility', 'suspicion', 'other', 'convinced', 'other', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'innocent', 'know', 'are.The', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'quickly', 'manically', 'just', 'enough', 'catch', 'up', 'explanations', 'keep', 'viewer', 'loop', 'plenty', 'Oh', 'THAT', 'why', 'moments', 'ever', 'devolving', 'derailing', 'exposition', 'monologue', ""'good"", 'guys', 'catch', 'real', 'story', 'much', 'faster', 'average', 'everyone', 'must', 'be', 'dumb', 'facilitate', 'plot', 'story', 'villain', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'nice', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'twist', 'acting', 'done', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'proof', 'action', 'movie', ""n't"", 'require', 'bunch', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'be', 'decent', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'movie', 'did', 'finally', 'succumb', 'mandatory', 'have', 'fall', 'love', 'now', 'nonsense', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'adhere', 'love', 'interest', 'material', 'was', 'kept', 'severe', 'minimum', 'left', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'nice', 'choice', 'opinion', 'Eagle', 'Eye', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'flaws', 'are', 'usual', 'action-movie', 'flaws', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'avoided', 'super-computer', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'tap', 'remotely', 'so', 'many', 'devices', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'blow', 'up', 'power', 'wires', 'power', 'grid', 'why', 'would', 'program', 'particular', 'little', 'ability', 'Why', 'experimental', 'medicine', 'locked', 'time-case', 'designed', 'look', 'bomb', 'timer', 'carried', 'security', 'detail', 'government', 'new', 'powerful', 'explosive', 'being', 'sent', 'regular', 'USPS', 'Why', 'super-computer', 'wait', 'everything', 'wrong', 'attempting', 'back-up', 'really', 'reason', 'other', 'tragic', 'suspense', 'have', 'little', 'boy', 'trumpet', 'be', 'trigger', 'bomb', 'are', 'speakers', 'building', 'computer', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'remotely', 'generate', 'necessary', 'sound', 'trigger', 'explosives', 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'first', 'law', 'reason', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'considering', 'how', 'often', 'super-computer', 'directly', 'people', 'explanation', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'accolades', 'when', 'compared', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'was', 'definitely', 'most', 'fun', 'action', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'that.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Eagle Eye

I'm tired of movies that are trying to be smart but wind up proving themselves ten times over to be more preposterous than realistic.There is not one scene in this movie that makes any sense whatsoever.`Eagle Eye' starts with a slacker twin brother mourning over the loss of his brother, his stark opposite.  There is also a single mother who fights to find some time for herself while struggling to get her son's father to do his part.  These two people are going to be thrown into an adventure when a woman (is it a `woman') calls them up and gives them an ultimatum.  For Jerry it's `do as I say or the FED's will think you're a terrorist and arrest you' and for Rachel it's `do as I say or the train your son is on is going to crash'.  So, needless to say, they do as the voice says.It could have been interesting, but it is so mind numbingly ridiculous that it loses all interest points in the first twenty minutes.  The plot is overworked and underdeveloped.  The ending is a ridiculous mess that feels thrown together to make sense out of something that offers no sense to be made.  Some have noted that the films moves at such a fast pace we are not given time to understand how stupid the film is, but sadly that is not true enough.  Sure, there is a lot of stuff going on all the time, but the fact of the matter is that the action is so over the top and half of it feels as though it has been spliced in from bigger and better films.The action is also very, very uninteresting.The acting is a mess.  Shia LaBeouf is just irritating, not charming or likable at all really.  Michelle Monaghan (who is gorgeous yet manages to look like a wreck here) is horrible here, giving her character no development and just one oversized emotion.  Rosario Dawson is unbelievable, Chiklis is underused and Thornton is a clich&eacute;, but he's entertaining at least so I'll credit him that.Each and every passing scene brought with it yet another `that would never happen' moment, and so many of those strung together makes for one very tediously unrealistic movie.  My wife likened it to `Minority Report', in that both films make an enemy out of technology, but the difference between those two films is that one of them fleshed out a coherent and plausible plot and coupled it with engrossing and entertaining action while the other through a bunch of action scenes on an idea and called it a movie.`Minority Report' is a minor sci-fi classic; `Eagle Eye' is a forgettable popcorn muncher.",1,I hate stupid movies...,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2639,"['Okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'smart', 'really', 'how', 'stupid', 'can', 'get', 'just', 'have', 'throw', 'up', 'hands', 'yell', 'enough', 'already', ""'m"", 'tired', 'movies', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'smart', 'wind', 'up', 'proving', 'ten', 'times', 'be', 'more', 'preposterous', 'not', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'sense', 'whatsoever.', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'starts', 'slacker', 'twin', 'brother', 'mourning', 'loss', 'brother', 'stark', 'opposite', 'also', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'find', 'time', 'struggling', 'get', 'son', 'father', 'do', 'part', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'thrown', 'adventure', 'when', 'woman', 'woman', 'up', 'ultimatum', 'Jerry', 'do', 'say', 'FED', 'will', 'think', ""'re"", 'terrorist', 'arrest', 'Rachel', 'do', 'say', 'train', 'son', 'going', 'crash', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'do', 'voice', 'says.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'so', 'mind', 'numbingly', 'ridiculous', 'interest', 'points', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'plot', 'overworked', 'underdeveloped', 'ending', 'ridiculous', 'mess', 'thrown', 'together', 'make', 'sense', 'something', 'sense', 'be', 'made', 'have', 'noted', 'films', 'moves', 'fast', 'pace', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'time', 'understand', 'how', 'stupid', 'film', 'sadly', 'not', 'true', 'enough', 'Sure', 'lot', 'stuff', 'going', 'time', 'fact', 'matter', 'action', 'so', 'top', 'half', 'been', 'spliced', 'bigger', 'better', 'films.The', 'action', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'uninteresting.The', 'acting', 'mess', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'just', 'irritating', 'not', 'charming', 'likable', 'really', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'who', 'gorgeous', 'yet', 'look', 'wreck', 'here', 'horrible', 'here', 'giving', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'one', 'oversized', 'emotion', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'unbelievable', 'Chiklis', 'underused', 'Thornton', 'clich', 'eacute', 'entertaining', 'least', 'so', ""'ll"", 'credit', 'that.Each', 'passing', 'scene', 'brought', 'yet', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'moment', 'so', 'many', 'strung', 'together', 'one', 'very', 'tediously', 'unrealistic', 'movie', 'wife', 'likened', 'Minority', 'Report', 'films', 'make', 'enemy', 'technology', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'fleshed', 'out', 'coherent', 'plausible', 'plot', 'coupled', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'action', 'other', 'bunch', 'action', 'scenes', 'idea', 'called', 'movie.', 'Minority', 'Report', 'minor', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'forgettable', 'popcorn', 'muncher']",Eagle Eye

The plot is set in the present, and revolves around a super-computer that (surprise) develops a will of its own. Known as ARIIA or Aria, the computer takes over the communication-systems all over the United States, and eventually decides to kill the president and blow up Congress during the State of the Union speech. The computer has decided (on somewhat flimsy grounds) that the U.S. administration is violating the constitution, and therefore launches ""Operation Guillotine"" in the name of We the People to end the problem once and for all...The film was panned by the critics for being extremely unrealistic and illogical.

Both viewings were on blu ray but the first time I had high expectations.  The story line intrigued me and I am a huge Shia LaBeouf fan.  With the first viewing I didn't like it very much.  I liked Shia but I thought the story line pushed the limits and was just too unbelievable for me.  It looked great in blu ray but I was disappointed.Well, we all know that our experiences when we have expectations can sometimes be altered.  I love blu ray, have consistently read how EAGLE EYE is one of the best films to utilize blu ray to its full effect so now, many months after my first viewing I purchased EAGLE EYE.  I wanted to have it for I do want to own every Shia LaBeouf film and I am so grateful I did.  This time I sat back with my home theater system with no expectations and was on the edge of my seat from beginnig to end.  Knowing the plot and having no expectations allowed me to just view it and amazingly the plot suddendlty made sense, caught me up from beginning to end and I enjoyed myself immensely.Kudos first must go to the acting.  Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan and Billy Bob Thornton all up the ante with their acting chops.  These characters are believable and it is refreshing to have the male and female lead not get romantically involved.  It brings more of a sense of relity to the film.  This film is directed and acted with respect to the story and it is very believable once you get caught up.  It is also filled with amazing action sequences and they were all right - blu ray is the only real way to enjoy this film to is full effect.  The video presentation is an amazingly crisp 1080p.  Colors and clarity are perfection.  Flesh tones are just right and the quality does not falter be it day or night, inside or outside.  The video never falters throughout the amazing action sequences.  The audio is an amazing Dolby TruHD 5.1.  Whether with dialogue driven scenes or the major action driven scenes the audio is strong, vibrant and realistic.  All the speakers of your theatre system will be put to use and the sound quality throughout is at such a level that it makes the film that much more stimulating.This is the first time I have ever said that if you did not like a film the first time give it a second shot but EAGLE EYE is an action film of the highest caliber with stimulating suspense.  Certainly one I plan on viewing again and again.

I remember when I first saw the trailer that it definitely intrigued me, but then when it came out it didn't seem to go over that well with the critics and public. And now I just got to seeing it a few weeks ago.  Of course sometimes the timing of a movie is key as well. This one hit theaters in September of 08, kind of a slow month typically for movies. The movie takes the plots of several different movies and combines them into this new telling of a familiar story. I immediately thought of Will Smith's excellent film Enemy of the State (1998) with Gene Hackman, the movie Se7en (1995) with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, and The Bourne movies with Matt Damon.  The images below of Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan walking on a dirt road under massive power lines are immediately recognizable from the famous final scenes of Se7en set in an eerily similar context.  Even the van delivery vehicle approaching them is the same as in Se7en. I half expected a head in a box! While I love the feel of this context/location both in Se7en and now Eagle Eye, it did feel a little too copycat like.Of course the Big Brother feel in the movie is instantly recognizable from Enemy of the State, the awesome techie movie from director Tony Scott, brother of director Ridley Scott, and the man who has certainly made a movie you've seen. Just look at his filmography and you'll be wowed by his catalog of movies. Same of course for his brother Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors, with an equally impressive filmography. Seems that both brothers were blessed by the movie gods! Eagle Eye also has the fast paced action and movement across land that The Bourne movies have taken as their iconic film motif. Eagle Eye rarely sits still as it bounces the 2 main characters off of every possible moving object known to man. I loved the cinematography and production design on Eagle Eye.  The sets are beautifully imagined and look incredible, especially the Eagle Eye mainframe computer room.  Those glowing light bulb orbs all around the room are super cool!While Eagle Eye does feel a bit like a Hollywood re-tread of the last 20 years, I still recommend it as good escape movie that will take you out of the ordinary Big Brother world we all live in now and plop you in a world where its all put to important use instead of mechanical monotony.",3,Big Brother,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2458,"['was', 'very', 'surprised', 'Eagle', 'Eye', '2008', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'giving', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'definitely', 'intrigued', 'then', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'over', 'well', 'critics', 'public', 'now', 'just', 'got', 'seeing', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'course', 'sometimes', 'timing', 'movie', 'key', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'hit', 'theaters', 'September', '08', 'kind', 'slow', 'month', 'typically', 'movies', 'movie', 'plots', 'several', 'different', 'movies', 'combines', 'new', 'telling', 'familiar', 'story', 'immediately', 'thought', 'Will', 'Smith', 'excellent', 'film', 'Enemy', 'State', '1998', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'movie', 'Se7en', '1995', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'images', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'walking', 'dirt', 'road', 'massive', 'power', 'lines', 'are', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'famous', 'final', 'scenes', 'Se7en', 'set', 'eerily', 'similar', 'context', 'Even', 'van', 'delivery', 'vehicle', 'approaching', 'same', 'Se7en', 'half', 'expected', 'head', 'box', 'love', 'feel', 'context/location', 'Se7en', 'now', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'did', 'feel', 'little', 'too', 'copycat', 'like.Of', 'course', 'Big', 'Brother', 'feel', 'movie', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Enemy', 'State', 'awesome', 'techie', 'movie', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'brother', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'man', 'who', 'certainly', 'made', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Just', 'look', 'filmography', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wowed', 'catalog', 'movies', 'Same', 'course', 'brother', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'equally', 'impressive', 'filmography', 'brothers', 'were', 'blessed', 'movie', 'gods', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'also', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'movement', 'land', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'have', 'taken', 'iconic', 'film', 'motif', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'rarely', 'still', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'possible', 'moving', 'object', 'known', 'man', 'loved', 'cinematography', 'production', 'design', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'sets', 'are', 'beautifully', 'imagined', 'look', 'incredible', 'especially', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'mainframe', 'computer', 'room', 'glowing', 'light', 'bulb', 'orbs', 'room', 'are', 'super', 'cool', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'feel', 'bit', 'Hollywood', 're-tread', 'last', '20', 'years', 'still', 'recommend', 'good', 'escape', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'ordinary', 'Big', 'Brother', 'world', 'live', 'now', 'plop', 'world', 'where', 'put', 'important', 'use', 'instead', 'mechanical', 'monotony']",Eagle Eye

1213014,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001L2ZSKS,Caleb Williams,"[7, 10]","Remember 40 years ago, there was a movie brought out called 2001: A Space Odyssey and it is long considered one of Stanley Kubricks greatest works? Well in that movie it contained a short story involving an advanced computer called HAL, who gained independent intelligence and tried to eliminate all astronauts on board his space station. That idea has been parodied and ripped off so many times it's laughable, with the TV shows such as The Simpsons and Futurama giving their own parody of it along with the most recent movie Stealth using the idea as a basis for their own movie. Hell, it even sort of looked like HAL and if that's not a ripoff I don't know what is, seriously.Eagle Eye is no exception to that rule as it takes the HAL idea of a powerful computer killing people and taking control and puts a terrorism twist on it. Jerry Shaw is the twin brother of Ethan Shaw, a soldier we're first lead to believe is killed in some form of action. After that event Jerry gets home to his apartment to find it's filled with munitions supplies and explosive chemicals. He receives a call from a female telling him the FBI are about to enter his apartment to arrest him and to get out. On the other side, Rachel Holloman gets a call from the same woman who tells her that her son Sam will be killed unless she follows the instructions. Jerry is caught by the FBI the first time, but the woman on the phone who's hacked into all United States networks breaks him out by smashing a crane into the building allowing Jerry an escape route. Jerry winds up with Rachel and it now leads into a chase/mission for them to try and save their own necks by following the womans instructions and keep from getting caught by the FBI who suspect them of being Cyber Terrorists. About a quarter into the film we find out that the woman on the phone is an artificially intelligent super computer located in the Pentagon. It's reason for creation is to automatically seek out, monitor and alert the authorities of a suspected threat to national security (this one again looks like HAL).Although the blatant ripoff material is there, this is still an intensely enjoyable film with some of the best action sequences I've seen in a film this year. The acting by Shia Labeouf and even Billy Bob Thornton is excellent, obviously the supporting actress of Michelle Monoghan is something great and again Shia delivers a stellar performance, constantly cementing his status as an all round excellent actor.

No, nor will we probably ever be that stupid.  Take my word from years of knowledge about computers and those that operate them, and those intelligent enough to create all the computers and monitoring devices, they are not going to let computers control anything.  For a computer and surveillance system to get remote control access and have the ability to carry out commands to act on, it would have to have several preset programmed scenario events take place.  While it is watching us, we are watching it and we control it, not vice versa.A rebellious young man's that roams the world doing odd jobs gets a call that his twin brother is killed in an auto accident.  We see that his brother was in the military but he hasn't spoken to his brother in three years (odd as he loved him).  How does his bank account go from insufficient funds to almost three-quarters of a million.  Why is his apartment now full of weapons delivered today?  Who is the woman on the phone telling him the FBI is coming and he has seconds to leave before capture?  Why is a single mother receiving calls telling her do do things or her son will die?

1213016,A2O6K23YDIP81M,B001L2ZSKS,"camden0022 ""Amazon Jungle King""","[1, 1]","I watched this movie at the $1.50 theater yesterday and all I can say was I was at the edge of my seat throughout the movie thinking about what is going to happen next to Jerry Shaw (Sia LaBeouf) and Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan). They are randomly brought together by a strange 'voice' who calls them on their cell phone and tells them to follow its instructions or they die (in Rachel's case it is her son). The FBI is after Jerry (especially an agent played by Billy Bob Thorton) because they suspect that he is involved in terrorist activity because of all the stuff found in his apartment and the $751,000 wired into his bank account. It was cool how all that money spit out of the ATM machine although that is very unrealistic since ATM's give a maximum of $400 per day. Jerry makes the terrible mistake of taking the money instead of going to the police, although I can understand why he did it.Anyway the story starts of with the US army launching a missile at a small village in Afghanistan that the president orders because he says that there is about a 60% probability that a dangerous terrorist is there. A lot of innocent civilians die, and this strengthens the terrorists cause and they hack into the power grids and traffic cams in the US. There are tons of high speed chases, deadly car crashes, shootings, and action in the airplane that the audience is breathless and doesn't know what will happen the next minute. I enjoyed the budding romance between Jerry Shaw and Rachel Holloman as they work together to try and get away from the voice. Later in the movie (without spoiling the plot) we see that Rachel becomes very emotionally attached to Jerry when the voice asks her to make a major decision. Also the audience is trying to guess who on earth is that female voice who is causing all this hell for the both of them, and if it is just one person. As you watch the movie you will be startled/shocked by the answer and what you learn.I give this movie 4.5 stars because my only qualm was the movie was a little more than 2 hours long and the stylized action with the trucks/cars crashing made me a little squeamish.

Instead this is an action packed movie with an intense and original plot unrevealing the series of events that happened in hours, not days.The movie succeeded in delivering action scenes of machines and technologies (rather than of man) one expects to see in a truly science fiction. The destruction hands of the cranes and of the powerlines are two most impressive ones in the movie. Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are excellent in portraying the ""pawns"" of the brain behind the secret - they are intelligent, sharp and being involuntarily involved in the big conspiracy exhibit a strong sense of helplessness and hence develop a convincibly strong bond with one another. One can feel their pressing need to survive and use all the wits one gets to figure out what comes next.It's thus a delight to watch an action packed movie which is fluid in story telling, mind provoking and unorthodox. You can actually sit back with your mind totally immersed in the movie for a couple of hours. Surprise and suspence, not romance, are abundant.

Lebryk,"[0, 0]","In the very short, fairly lame, making of featurette on this DVD, somebody says, we wanted to make the action real, we wanted people to live the action, we wanted people to remember the action in this fim.Well, action you get. Acting and story, you don't. Yes the chase scenes are amazing, there's some hair raising action. It all looks like another LaBeouf movie, Transformers, without the really cool CG effects or robots. So that does make these chase scenes lame or cool, depending on what you like.Story, well you don't get much. This film tried to be a Bourne Identity mystery. Instead, it's just another silly potboiler thriller. It tries to be Washington DC, consipracy theory, all seeing movie. Sadly there are so many moments where the shark jumps, it's impossible to believe any of the nonsense that goes on. There just isn't enough space to call out all the non-sequitors in this film. It's actually like many reviewers have said, Shia, why didn't you just let those calls go to voice mail? Unknown caller? You don't answer those calls.Oh there are some really mornonic homages to 2001 A Space Odessy. Aria, the evil computer, has a red ball that looks like Hal's. She discovers the plot against her through wave patterns in a coffee cup. They try to dismantle her by removing her memory banks. She uses a crane to wipe people away. It's all too awful really. 2001 was a fabulous movie, it's sad when a piece of not so good film making does things like this.Shia is really tiresome in this film. He's done nothing of note since Holes. It's very hard to take him the least bit seriously. Billy Bob Thorton is decent in this film, be he's also hit that stupid stride with his music playing. And it just seems to rub off in this film. He jumped character way too often. The only bright star, Michelle Monaghan, and only because she is beautiful to look at. Acting-wise, well some decent moments in this film.Technically, yes it was well shot. Yes we learn in that Making Of featurette that the car crashes were ""real"", they avoided CG as much as they could. And that is supposed to make the movie more thrilling and ""real."" Oh just give me back the CG, there was nothing all that special about the crashes. In fact the tunnel crash of the truck flying in the air - I couldn't understand how that airplane, with very little clearance, didn't crash right into that truck. Real or not, the slo-mo was way over used.This film is about 45 minutes too long. You could very easily run this film at 4x speed during the conversations and actually miss very little of the plot line. The chases were fine, about the right length. All the nonsense inbetween, cut it away.The single disc DVD has really bad deleted scenes. They all belong in the garbage can. There were only 4 scenes, one of which, I found hard to figure out what was different from the film. The making of featurette is around 4 minutes long, and is moderately interesting.Rate PG-13, violence, some strong language here and there. No nudity. No sensual scenes at all. It's a very chaste film. But, a ton of stuff gets blown up and crashed.Just didn't care for this film very much. The chase scenes were fine. The rest, trash can.

The film finds recent media-pimped heart-throb, Shia LaBeouf, who spends most of the film resembling nothing less than a startled vole with a perspiration problem, framed for conspiracy to commit terrorism and aided in hisEnemy of the Statestyle flight from the authorities by an unseen female voice with seemingly god-like abilities to manipulate technology. Now, if you like me, are capable of adding two and two together, you'll have worked exactly who this mysterious puppet-master is in about one minute flat. Further to that, both the other half and I had worked out the entire plot within about five minutes, but then we watch a lot of these kinds of films. As with the recent Liam Neeson opus, 'Taken', it's a mish-mash of cinematic clich&eacute;s which have been dusted off, given a fresh lick of paint and elevated to the status of ""extremely watchable"" by hyper-kinetic execution. The vortex of conspiracy which sweeps a cast including LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton (who gets all the best lines), Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis into a maelstrom of car chases, explosions and fist fights is completely unbelievable, but then that's never been a strike against a film in my opinion. Hell, I watch films for escapism and this is escapism - with a vaguely defined message about the dangerously fragile nature of liberty that gets lost along the way - pure and simple. I say rent and watch with the lights out, the sound way up and a big bucket of popcorn. It's why films like this exist and this film is largely superior to any other recent efforts in this genre.

1213033,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001L2ZSKS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","Back in the late 90's, well-known producer/director Steven Spielberg had an idea of a story about the government using technology as a way to watch people.  An idea that is based on Isaac Asimov's short story ""All the Troubles of the World"".  With the discussion of how far the government can go in profiling and surveillance will always be debatable but this film does have its relevance with today's news and thus Spielberg's idea from the mid-to-late 90's became a reality in 2008 with the release of ""EAGLE EYE"".The film is directed by D.J. Caruso (""Disturbia"") who was inspired by Robert Lantham's ""War Games"" when creating ""EAGLE EYE"".  The film ended up grossing over $177 million worldwide and had a budget of $80 million.  The film reunites Shia LaBeouf with Steven Spielberg (who produced ""Transformers"" and ""Indiana Jones: The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"") and Caruso (for ""Disturbia"") and stars the following talent Michelle Monaghan (""Mission Impossible III"", ""The Heartbreak Kid"", ""Bourne Supremacy""), Billy Bob Thornton (""Monster's Ball"", ""The Alamo"", ""Mr. Woodcock""), Rosario Dawson (""Sin City"", ""Seven Pounds"", ""Clerks II"") and Michael Chiklis (""Fantastic Four"",""The Shield"", ""The Commish"").VIDEO & AUDIO:""EAGLE EYE"" definitely showcases awesome picture quality and I wouldn't expect anything lower from a Steven Spielberg produced film.  The film featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:35:1 features an enormous amount of action that in both daylight, night, lowlight conditions with no signs of artifacts.  Blacks are really nice and deep and I recall no artifacting or low-light noise.The outdoor scenes are absolutely beautiful but despite overcast but the amount of detail and the number of locations featured in the film definitely is a major plus.  You really get something new with each shot.  Overall, a beautiful transfer that I can't complain about.  There are a lot of colors in the film and almost an artistic way of utilizing colors courtesy of Director of Photography Dariusz Wolski is known for his work on the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and ""Sweeney Todd"" but his experience really gave ""EAGLE EYE"" a visceral explosion with the amount of colors combined with the action and of course, the audio.""EAGLE EYE"" is featured in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and this lossless track is just pleasing to listen to.  Of course, having watched the car chase scene and hearing how beautiful that film sounds and now watching ""EAGLE EYE"", ""QoS"" definitely haves the one up on ""EAGLE EYE"" in the sound department but that is not bad by all means.  The amount of audio from the various chase scenes to the explosions definitely give your home theater setup a workout.Overall, there's not much to complain about the video and audio quality, both are well done!SPECIAL FEATURES:""EAGLE EYE"" contains the following special features (many of them in HD):* Deleted Scenes - (4:39) A total of three deleted scenes featured below and an alternate ending.  The alternate ending was a bit farfetched as Jerry buys Sam ""Rock Band"" for a birthday gift and the kids start playing and performing the songs and we learn that Ariia has managed to get herself into a video game.  I'm glad they didn't use that alternate ending.* Ethan's Wake HD* Minuteman HD* Twins HD* Alternate Ending HD* Asymmetric Warfare: The Making of Eagle Eye - (25:32) A featurette with interviews with the producers, director, crew, cast and behind-the-scene footage of the making of the film.  How Steven Spielberg brought in D.J. Caruso to direct and how Caruso was reunited with LaBoeouf (both worked together on ""Disturbia"") and also working with the other talent such as Billy Bob Thornton, Michelle Monaghan and Rosario Dawson.  How Caruso was influenced by ""Wargames"" director.* Eagle Eye on Location: Washington, D.C. - (5:58) A featurette about shooting the film in Washington D.C., shooting the film at the Library of Congress, the Pentagon and working with actual soldiers from the military.* Is My Cell Phone Spying on Me? - (9:13) How the government can be spying on people with the use of cell phones.  Interviews with the producer, director, the talents including Michal Zimmer (Asst. Professor in the School of Information Studies, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and Marc Rotenberg (Exec. Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center).* Shall We Play A Game? HD - (9:21) A conversation between ""Eagle Eye"" Director D.J. Caruso and his mentor John Badham, Director of ""War Games"".  A very fun conversation to watch as we learn about both films and the differences of technology of the present and the past.* Road Trip - (3:05) A featurette about the many locations that ""Eagle Eye"" was filmed.  The crew and talent all experienced a major road trip of filming in these many locations.* Gag Reel - (6:57) A fun, lengthy gag reel of the crew and talent having fun or scenes of them messing up their lines.* Photo Gallery - Using your remote, you can navigate through still images taken from the film.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:20) The original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:""EAGLE EYE"" was a film that definitely made me curious because the trailer had this hi-tech fugitive type of vibe going for it.But I have to admit that the film felt like it was full of non-stop action, many chase scenes and if anything, not much plot.  Where Caruso credits John Badham (""War Games"") as his mentor, where a film like ""War Games"" is effective is that although there are chase scenes, there is quite a bit of character development and an actual plot.Immediately in ""EAGLE EYE"", we are to believe that the government has given so much power to a supercomputer that in ""Terminator"" like fashion, it rebels, it kills and it feels slighted because the President of the United States went against its recommendation.  The last time I saw a supercomputer get so emotional was 1997's ""Universal Soldier: The Return"".But of course the message being driven was how everything is now being connected through technology and that our privacy is now under the watchful eye of the government.But when there is potential for plot, Caruso goes Michael Bay and wants to focus on the action-scenes and granted, there are a good number of people who love that.  Jean Claude Van Damme or Steven Segal films anyone?The characters brought into the mix such as Michelle Monaghan as Rachel.  Every role she has portrayed, we have cared about her...but in this film, because of its chaotic pacing, there's no time to really give a damn.  Michael Chiklis was not utilized as much as I hoped.And for Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson, do these two agents really need to squabble so much that their efforts are being tested by this supercomputer?  I did enjoy Thornton and Dawson's characters but I felt they were not used effectively.  Especially Anthony Mackie as Major William Bowman who becomes a hero as he defies the antagonist and you ended up rooting for the guy but he ends up being under utilized and I expected to see him one last time at the end of the film.And last, Julianne Moore did do a great job supplying the voice of supercomputer Ariia.But with the overall plot of a supercomputer that has gone on a revenge tirade...to say the least, ""EAGLE EYE"" is not a film about logic.What could have been an intellectual thriller, ends up being a film with a lot of destruction, explosions and two main characters who have no idea what they are doing but realize that they could be killed by electronic wires or some form of technology.  OK... ...even in the middle of the country where there are no signs of technology but electrical wires, this antagonist has the ability to control even that and electrocute them.So, whether ""EAGLE EYE"" is trying to poke fun about the Patriot Act or being a film that wants people to consider the privacy issues going on today in the world, ""EAGLE EYE"" had potential but somehow the action scenes over dominates the film.  With what plot does happen, it just seems farfetched.Did I dislike the film or the Blu-ray.  Actually, no I didn't.  I was entertained by the action scenes and when you know that logic can be thrown out the door, you just enjoy the film for what it is and hope that the screenplay gets even more creative or exciting.On the Blu-ray end, the action scenes look great and the audio quality is magnificent but along with great picture quality and great audio quality, you would hope to get a great story behind that.  I did enjoy the special features especially the interview between ""EAGLE EYE"" Director Caruso and ""War Games"" Director John Badham was quite interesting.  Especially when Caruso throws in ""Saturday Night Fever"" (which Badham also directed) as another film of inspiration.  But where Caruso missed the boat is that with ""War Games"", you cared about the characters.  There was a good amount of character development... But with ""EAGLE EYE"", action is put as priority over storytelling.Overall, ""EAGLE EYE"" was an entertaining thriller.  I was not bored nor did I want to shut the film off.  There are really cool action sequences in the film and that is the strong point of the film.The Blu-ray does feature great picture and audio quality and several special features to keep one busy.  But overall, I can't help but feel that the potential for something greater was missed.",4,Blu-ray: Non-stop action!

Caruso has had his share of flops (Taking Lives, anyone) but with Distrubia he pretty much hit pay dirt and will without a doubt, make movies for years to come. Eagle Eye reminded me of Enemy Of The State in a lot of ways, and being that I'm a consiprasit, I could identify with the film and its paranoia. Shia Labruf (who I'm not tired of yet) turns in another good performance and he easily shows why in the next three to five years he'll be on Hollywood A-list. The nature of the film doesn't require Shia to be a hard-core action star, he's just an everyman put in a situation he doesn't want to be in. Michelle Monaghan does all right in the film but she has yet to equal her performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

There is ZERO connection between the computer and the aircraft.  That is true with everything in the movie. Just because there are cameras on buildings doesn't mean that a computer can tap into it.  There has to be a way for the computer to tap into those type of systems and contrary to what most people believe, those ""connections"" just don't exist.

The comparisons others are making to good films is unfair to the good films.  Whenever Hollywood sets out to make a movie featuring the power of computers, they botch it.

It sets off air bags, operates cranes, and can see every step made by the main characters.  Somehow, the FBI is on their heels every step of the way.  Why doesn't the computer stop them?  That's a mystery.  The timing and precision that allows the main characters to do what they do is somehow not put into play to prevent the FBI from locating them all the time.  Why not blow up the FBI's air bags while they're driving?  How about sabotaging the lead agents to keep them from being able to pursue?  Or how about locking them somewhere?

But--harkening back to the last presidential campaign--even if you put lipstick on a pig. . .A copier store nobody (LaBeouf) and a single mother (Michelle Monaghan, who's okay) are suddenly selected by Big Brother (only this time, it's Big Sister) to be dupes in the AI's grand (and absurd) scheme to save the nation.  Consequently, the two characters are forced to jump through death defying hoops along the way--all while receiving never-ending cell phone instructions.  They're chased by lots of folks, but primarily by an egotistical FBI agent (Billy Bob Thornton), who doesn't see the light until it's meeting him right between the eyeballs.

Here, I thought it was a massive stroke of genius to make him a twin whose over-achieving military officer brother has died. It is this brother that is the major key in the film, and me likey!

(You'll notice AVATAR stole this concept of twins.)The creepy extortionist who's really a computer gone mad...well I certainly didn't see that one coming, in spite of the fact that when it did come, it was a total rip-off of I, ROBOT. That wasn't too bad, considering the drama and suspense this film gives us. Shia's performance, though at times I think maybe a bit tepid, is intense. I love his eyes.That is where I am leaving it.

1213055,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001L2ZSKS,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","EAGLE EYE  is not a great movie but it is an entertaining one.  Granted, leaving reason at the door is a prerequisite to plugging into the plot, but the style of the film and the premise that in the midst of all of our government's supposedly first class intelligence agencies such amazing programs can be staged opens the window for some speculation. Credit writers John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz and Dan McDermott for pushing the button on current cellphone obsession tied to terrorism to an all time high. And with director D.J. Caruso at the helm the whole preposterous (but entertaining) tale comes vividly to life.Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a free-living disappointment to his father and at the funeral of Jerry's twin brother Ethan the tables turn.  Somehow Jerry's little apartment is filled with guns and ammo and a mysterious female telephone voice on his cellphone warns him to escape the impending FBI entry.  Jerry is clueless as to the appearance of the weaponry and when taken into custody Agent Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) accuses him of collusion with his probable terrorist twin brother, now deceased.  Jerry escapes but is 'followed' by the constant orders from his cellphone that lead to dangerous circumstances.  On the other side of the city a working mother Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) receives equally strange cellphone calls threatening to murder her child if he does not do the voice's bidding.  Obviously Jerry and Rachel are joined in this duo adventure and the manner in which they resolve the clues on the run closely pursued by Agent Morgan, Zoe Perez (Rosario Dawson) et al drives the story to its conclusion.The movie is bogged down with far too many car chases and absurd crashes and disasters, but the idea of terrorism in a new guise is an interesting one.  But for all the tense mood of the movie, the audience is doused with a syrupy sentimental ending which all but negates the adrenalin flow the film had.  LaBeouf and Monaghan make an interesting coupling, given the little dialog they have to create fleshed out characters. Not a great movie, but not a bad movie for thriller fans.

1213056,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B001L2ZSKS,GratedTopping,"[0, 0]","Okay, I just saw the movie a few moments ago and am just typing about it. Just thinking 'on the go' and not re-watching the film at the time.Anyway, here, you'll have ""Aria"", the voice of the ""Eagle Eye"" project in the 36th secret underground floor of the Pentagon. It's there to track possible terrorists and all data about basically every person. She uses every cell phone, electronic device, traffic camera, and almost anything electronic to analyze us. Heck, she can even dectect what is being said by the vibrations she 'sees' in a cup of coffee! However, she's gone on her own, determining that the Executive branch of the government needs to be eliminated.Rachel's a mother raising her son and dealing with a deadbeat dad who's part of the assassination plot. She's teamed up with .. I admitedly forget the character's name .. but he's played by Shia LaBeouf. Both are getting messages or spoken voices -- all sent by the computer -- to do specific things which will ultimately lead them to Washington. For example, they need to steal a briefcase from guards of an armored vehicle...but it doesn't contain money. It has some sort of drug that allows them to slow their breathing and heart rate when they sneak on government plane.Anyway, the story contains something about a crystal bomb that, when presented by a certain note, will explode and destroy major areas despite its size. Rachel's son plays the trumpet and, with others in his school's band, will be playing for the President. A person being led by ""Aria"" has hidden some sort of activator in the trumpet. At least that is how I got it. It showed ""Aria"" noticing and activating it.Now, at the end, Rachel was in the Capitol building at the end and it all was pretty ridiculous. I mean, it showed her putting on the necklace/crystal. She must have known that if her son played the trumpet, what she had on her neck would kill her, her son, and everyone else there. So...why go anyway? I mean, let ""Aria"" kill her son but the rest would be spared. You wouldn't be killing yourself, at least. The President would be spared ... at least until someone else was manipulated by the ""Eagle Eye"".Why was Rachel even going to see the President? How was she recognized? Why did Rachel look so surprised to see her son playing for the President? I don't know. I thought she knew that this was going on. Oh wait. . I think I recall that someone from the White House approached the teacher and said something like ""There was a change of plan."" Still, it's confusing.Shia's character soon learned that his brother learned of the project's desire to go AWOL and the machine killed him by controlling traffic lights that resulted in a car crash. Shia was lured to the project and, because he was so similar in voice to his brother's, he was able to speak the words overriding the computer's last given command. Whatever.The very end was a disappointment. It should have finished with Shia's character passing away with him sacrificing himself. He had just gone into the main room as a security guard andshot his gun in the air. He knew that the music would cause the bomb to go off, so he did this to scare everyone and stop the band's playing. Of course, he was taken down.Rosario Dawson's character and another military member were trying to shut ""Aria"" down. They found a memory card left by Shia's brother -- who wasn't a terrorist after all -- which showed a video of ""Aria""'s first moment of deciding to do things her way. If you disagree with her, you are then enemies of the state. They should have shown Ms. Dawson's character telling others how the Shia's character had saved the Presiden't life and the lives of many others. That would have been a better ending.Yet it finishes with Shia just receiving an award, being barely wounded with a broken arm even though he was shot at least 5 times in the back or chest, and ... a year or so later ... meeting up with Rachel and getting a kiss at her son's birthday.The coolest thing in this movie was that the car crashes were awesome and were also real and not computerized (which I learned earlier from an extra on the DVD). For extras, you'll have three deleted (two are actually just extended); a behind-the-scenes that lasts about 5 minutes; and some previews. One other deleted scene I recognized in the behind-the-scenes was when ""Aria"", the ""Eagle Project"" (sorry...I see that I didn't even complete this part in the review; I'll fix it later [2.24.2011]).Okay flick for brainless action with a 'similarity' that's been done better elsewhere back in 1983's ""WarGames"". Check this for cool crashes, Billy Bob Thornton as an FBI agent, and the lovely Rosario Dawson as an agent for...? I think she said something about formerly being in the Navy or something.Anyway, this was exciting but preposterous and confusing. You'll certainly think ""What the ????"" through this stinker, but it's a fast-paced, popcorn-chompin' flick. If that's good enough, then it won't be a total stinker.",2,It's been done better...

One hour into the film, I was hoping it wouldn't stretch too long. Not because I was sleepy but because I realized what a poor script it is. And just when I started to think this Shia guy isn't as bad as I've always thought he was, I realized he is what is wrong with this film. The film is not clever at all. There are many scenes that last for less than one second, almost all are action filled. In the second half, it is a jumble of storylines, twists, concerned eyes, speed and self loveth logic. The actress was horried and so was pretty much everyone invovled in the plot. I don't understand what is wrong with three of my friends who loved this film. The lowest rating they gave it was an 8/10 and they almost looked hurt when I told them what I thought.Shia is not a good actor. He should go back and get a degree or two and try to save our economy. The actress has bad skin and made it difficult for me to concentrate on her dialogues. The film never really settles down and when it does it looks campy, cheesy and torturous. Believe me, by no strength of imagination am I the sort of person who considers his time of prime importance, but this film gave me quite a moodswing.I know it will be a hit and I'm happy the producers will get there money worth. I realize I like the other two films by the actor more. I think it was a waste of good resources. Wanted was better and tolerable.This is the sort of film that will make it big on movie rentals but it's just so badly directed.I loved Billy Bob Thorton in The Man Who Wasn't There but I must say the man gets really silly roles and aside from the Coen brothers collaboration, he hasn't done one single worthy film.I rest my case, the Entourage episode in the morning was today's highlight.bye.",2,LIKE ORDERING A VEGETARIAN SUBWAY,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1935,"['was', 'very', 'entertained', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'when', 'friend', 'told', 'great', 'film', 'had', 'doubts', 'waited', 'film', 'settle', 'down', 'then', 'give', 'rethink', 'One', 'hour', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'too', 'long', 'Not', 'was', 'sleepy', 'realized', 'what', 'poor', 'script', 'just', 'when', 'started', 'think', 'Shia', 'guy', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'realized', 'what', 'wrong', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'clever', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'last', 'less', 'one', 'second', 'almost', 'are', 'action', 'filled', 'second', 'half', 'jumble', 'storylines', 'twists', 'concerned', 'eyes', 'speed', 'loveth', 'logic', 'actress', 'was', 'horried', 'so', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'invovled', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'wrong', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'loved', 'film', 'lowest', 'rating', 'gave', 'was', '8/10', 'almost', 'looked', 'hurt', 'when', 'told', 'what', 'thought.Shia', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'get', 'degree', 'two', 'try', 'save', 'economy', 'actress', 'bad', 'skin', 'made', 'difficult', 'concentrate', 'dialogues', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'down', 'when', 'campy', 'cheesy', 'torturous', 'Believe', 'strength', 'imagination', 'am', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'time', 'prime', 'importance', 'film', 'gave', 'quite', 'moodswing.I', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'hit', ""'m"", 'happy', 'producers', 'will', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'realize', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'actor', 'more', 'think', 'was', 'waste', 'good', 'resources', 'Wanted', 'was', 'better', 'tolerable.This', 'sort', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'big', 'movie', 'rentals', 'just', 'so', 'badly', 'directed.I', 'loved', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'must', 'say', 'man', 'really', 'silly', 'roles', 'aside', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'collaboration', ""n't"", 'done', 'one', 'single', 'worthy', 'film.I', 'rest', 'case', 'Entourage', 'episode', 'morning', 'was', 'today', 'highlight.bye']",Eagle Eye

1213061,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001L2ZSKS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[49, 58]","The Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition)andMinority Report (Widescreen Edition)both produced similar moments which I really dug, in which a near omniscient character guides his/her fleeing companion and does so with such exquisite timing and pinpoint accuracy that capture is thereby avoided (Jason Bourne in one film, that psychic chick in the other). EAGLE EYE is one extended version of these two moments, and, guess what, it doesn't get old.I guess this could happen, government voyeurism, what with how advanced technology's gotten. In fact, I've no doubt this is happening right now. EAGLE EYE presents a twisty plot, the soup of which blends Big Brother paranoia, the techno thriller, the shadow of terrorism, a whiff of Skynet, and the classic man on the run theme. EAGLE EYE tells of two strangers - Jerry Shaw, the slacker copy boy (excuse me, ""copy associate"") from Copy Cabana and Rachel, the stressed single mom/paralegal - suddenly flung together by a mysterious (and dang pushy) female who gives them brisk instructions over their cell phones, forcing them to frenetically run and jump around, drive like they've got to use the bathroom, hold up a pair of security guards for a briefcase (of which contents are a letdown, by the way), and even sneak onboard a military cargo plane. And those are just for starters...The most intriguing part of the film, for me, was learning what was up with the voicy voice, who's cornered Jerry by framing him as a terrorist and cornered Rachel by threatening to kill her son. Much of the suspense leaks out once the film drops the 411 on the cell phone taskmaster. EAGLE EYE is escapist cinema which may have started out intending to make some sort of significant political and social statement but then kind of shrugged it off halfway thru the film. There's no dearth of far-fetched moments (like, on the train, where there just happened to be a conveniently snoozing stranger with a celly sitting right across from Shia or Rachel being so out-of-the-blue capable with a firearm). But the third act really goes ape-shiznit with the preposterous as the Big Bad's plans coalesce and imperil the nation's highest offices. The film's big crescendo echoes the climax scene from Hitchcock'sThe Man Who Knew Too Much.Will Smith's ENEMY OF THE STATE and the Bourne series have already demonstrated that the government can check up on us by accessing security, surveillance, and traffic cameras, as well as cell phones. EAGLE EYE one-ups these films by featuring an antagonist who is more far reaching, more omnipresent. The voice not only can track any person anytime, anywhere, by tapping into the nation's electronic data grid, but she can remotely control stop lights, steer elevated trains, set off power lines, and even take over military aircrafts. When our heroes go on the run (and don't really have time to chat on the cell), they get helpful directions from various electronic billboard signs, readout displays and monitor screens. So, unless you're Amish, there's no escaping the nagging voice.Shia LaBeouf lost some cred with me for his vine-swinging part in the latest Indiana Jones flick. Here, he's decent but this really isn't a platform to show off his acting chops, slave as the picture is to the quick cut edits, flashy stunts and loud pyrotechnics. LaBeouf's characer has a few moments to do his surly, angst-ridden bit (what with his dead twin brother being the brighter light in the family), but he and lead actress Michelle Monaghan actually come off more as chess pieces being shuffled about by the all powerful entity to progress its murky end game. Julianne Moore plays the mysterious voice on the phone, managing to sound impersonal yet officiously sexy. Billy Bob Thornton is good as the undeterred FBI guy and Rosario Dawson is wasted as Air Force OSI Agent Zoey Perez trying to piece it all together. Thornton, by the way, comes up with the best line in the film, as he chews out his underlings: ""If I don't get some good leads soon, you're all gonna be demoted into something that's gonna require touching $#!t with your hands!""So, why am I four-starring this film? Because, in spite of the over-the-top beats, I got hooked into the premise enough that I had to see it thru to the end. And it may be loud and sometimes incoherent, but, damn if I didn't enjoy the wild ride. I think the key is that the film moves at such a frenetic pace that it forces you to shift your focus from one sequence to the next. You might just have enough time to ponder the implausibility of whatever's on the screen, but then you almost immediately get distracted with the next implausible thing on the screen. It's sleight-of-hand trickeration, is what it is. And, in the final tally, I had a good time (and, yes, part of the good time was spent making fun of the film).As for the government accessing our electronic devices, that would certainly explain why I'm so sucky at Tetris on my cell phone. Now I see that it's the government conducting cyber terrorism.

In fact, the two slow parts of the movie are the first minute and the last minute - everything in between is non-stop action that keeps your attention during this just under 2 hour movie.Avid movie watchers will see themes from other movies embedded in Eagle Eye - a story that revolves around a military artificial intelligence that monitors pretty much EVERYTHING. From mobile phones to surveillance cameras to electrical and utility grids, the AI monitors the United States and reports back on possible threats to the security of the country. Typically these threats are reported to the Department of Defence, but the AI is empowered to act upon them in any way necessary.The AI has a similar feel to Flight of the Navigator - an ""all-seeing-eye"" that can roam around the room looking into globes that provide information and communication. There are also water elements in the AI room that are reminiscent of Minority Report, and ""all powerful"" elements like War Games.The characters are thrown into the world of terrorism, government conspiracy, and are pitted against the FBI and the Department of Defense as a strange voice on their phones directs their every move (against their will). What will they do to not only save the son of the female lead, but as we discover, save the entire power structure of the United States from a supposed terrorist threat?This movie features INTENSE car chases - with all the associated explosions and collateral damage. Most of these effects are NON-digital as you learn in the behind the scenes featurettes on the DVD. This adds realism and excitement to the movie. There is also a very intense chase scene in the baggage handling facility of an airport that will leave the viewer thinking they are on a wild roller coaster.I found myself on the edge of my seat during much of the movie - even with all those memories of past movies with similar AI themes. This one makes it fresh by wrapping a new set of action sequences and character development around the AI in a new and exciting way.You'll also want to watch the gag reel on the dvd for an absolutely hysterical sequence between Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson - not to be missed.Genuine acting, exciting action sequences, and tasteful special effects give this movie four full stars from me.

Aside from that FACT, the rest of it is just convoluted eye candy meant to put the majority of easily persuaded viewers into a trance.  Last but not least, it's a message movie, with an obvious political axe to grind from a Hollywood crowd bereft of any leverage in the moral landscape.Essentially, Eagle Eye is a top secret government computer system meant to predict crime (Minority Report) by using every electronic resource networked together to eavesdrop and anticipate wrong-doing.  When a complicated political assassination attempt goes awry (Vantage Point), and against the computer's calculated recommendation, Eagle Eye becomes self-aware and decides to take over (The Terminator).  Countless humans, including the majority of the Order of Succession, are on the most wanted list.Caught in the conspiracy theory (Conspiracy Theory) of government corruption, cover up, and ubiquitous clandestine sources of observation - big brother is watching (Enemy of the State) - Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are led around on a goose chase via mysterious phone voice that knows everything (Matrix), as the story takes about 400 plot twists and turns mistakenly meant to distract and amaze the viewers (Ocean's Eleven).  There are countless moments in the movie's ""plot"" in which the ridiculously intricate details that deliver Shia and Michelle throughout Chicago (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and cross-country to the Pentagon can be questioned.  The what-ifs challenging the sequences of this movie are boundless.  If even one minor detail were to change, the movie fails (The Butterfly Effect).  And the train sequence (stolen from movies too numerous to mention) does not provide sufficient convincing that the powers behind the voice leading the duo could orchestrate new ways to force participants' hands.  Sooner or later makers of movies like this have to watch Tom and Jerry to realize that the 43-step mouse trap doesn't work, except in cartoons.  The only aspect of the movie that is truly believable is that Shia Lebouf, much like his character in this movie, has been led around like a puppy on a leash, choosing one bad movie after another.It's average, somewhat interesting, but nothing all that great.

If you've never seen that film I would say go rent or buy it. It is probably at such a low price now. This though is not about that film. This is my opinion about Eagle Eye.This movie has some good actors in it. I usually prefer older actors over new oes because of the level of quality they put out.  However there are some great young actors in this film.  Well I mean I'm only 23 so I guess I should say there are some great actors my age.  Some of of them are. Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson and Michael. They all do a great job in this film. A couple of other really good actors in the film are Ethan Embry and Billy Bob Thornton. Now I have seen Embry and Thornton in a lot f films. Some of these are That Thing You Do and Vegas Vacation for Embry and Armageddon and Mr. Woodcock for Thornton. I just saw Made of Honor which had Michelle Monaghan. This was a really funny movie. I would say if you've yet you've yet to see it I would suggest you check it out.Now for the important part. My review of Eagle Eye. As I said in the beginning this kind of reminded me of war games. I will not say in what way because I do not want to give away to much of the movie. Ok, the movie is about a boy ""Jerry Shaw"" who can't keep a job. His father is always comparing him to his brother who is in the Air Force. He gets a call informing him that his brother has died. That's when the trouble starts. One day he goes to the A.T.M and he has over 700 thousand dollars. He does not understand how or why this money is there. He then goes home and has a lot of things in his house. Like cases of weapons and other military things. Then he gets a phone call telling him to run. He doesn't understand and says no. Thinking that it is a joke. His house is raided and he is in jail. He gets another phone call telling him to run. There is an explosion and he runs. You will learn more of his brother as the movie goes on. There are important things that have to do with his brother, so pay attention.He is not alone though. For there is a lady who gets the same phone calls. She has a young son in school and she is told if she does not comply to the demands her son will die. Her son will have a big part in the main scheme of things. That is not something I will tell you about though. As I said in the beginning I do not want to give away to much. You never really find out why her son is picked. I have an idea and it has to do with a skill he has. You'll see!So now these two people are trapped. By an enemy they can not see but whom can see them WHEREVER they go. The enemy gets access to all the cameras on the streets and everywhere else. The lady who called earlier calls and gives them exact directions to get to the places she has instructed then to go. It really blew my mind when I thought about how true a lot of this stuff could be. The two will come to find out who is on the other end of the phone. Again you will probably think WOW.I saw this with my mom and my stepfather. I am 23 and them 42 and 44. We each have our own types of movies we like but we all really liked this one. I am sure a lot of people will enjoy this movie. It has good acting. Lots of action. A lot to do with technology and conspiracy. I am going to buy this when it comes out because it seems like one of those movies you can enjoy more than once. This movie is for people with all kinds of picks and favorites. When the world is going crazy watch this about a world going crazy and perhaps it will take your mind off the real stuff for a while!Also, I was wondering why in the heck this movie is so expensive?  I mean over 30 dollars!

Government now has a super computer capable of accessing every electronic device ever invented and can conduct even through liquid when push comes to shove. Its super duper computer spy network is called ""Eagle Eye,"" and it means something more powerful than Big Brother is watching. It is a she and she is wired/programed/processed/evolved to go beyond the confines of her gold globes and her 36 floors underground below the Pentagon.Early on, Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBoeuf) is forced to follow Eagle Eye's orders, as is Michelle Monagham's character. The early chase scene in which they are involved put me on my feet from wildly choreographed car collisions, and the whirligig cranes were beyond believable, creating pure adrenaline rushes.All the impossible machinations controlled by Eagle Eye are just too incredible to be vaguely believable. On the other hand, remember Hal? ""2001: Space Odyssey"" was uniquely far-fetched, too. A computer that would kill all the astronauts but one and take control of the spacecraft? We accepted that premise, didn't we? It's not much different with Eagle Eye, except her power is inordinately more powerful.As for the ending that meets with disagreement in some of these reviews, my question is: Why not that ending? What we thought was the ending is not in keeping with the powerhouse story. It would be anti-climatic.Special kudos go to Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis, both of whom lend credence to the story. As for Billy Bob Thornton, his pancake makeup was so thick as to be the most laughable part of the story! A high-ranking FBI agent wearing all that makeup! Now that's unbelievable!If you are looking for a message, consider the potentially dangerous power of a super computer gone rogue. Do we even know if the government has a super computer?Even if you can't concede Eagle Eye's all-pervasive powers, just grumble over the premise, then relax, and enjoy the non-stop action.

The script is as sophomoric as the plot, and it is painful to see Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan trying to bring ""depth"" to their two respectively just plain dumb characters.  I can only hope their political acumen surpasses the absurd piece of propaganda they were given as a script.Let's see, the plot - suprise, suprise - an out-of-control American government  murders ""innocents"" in the War on Terror and thereby creates a cyber Frankenstein that attempts to destroy that government for its sins. Of course, the bad decision to kill ""innocents"" is made by, guess who, the ""President."" The rogue computer even uses the phrase, ""stay the course,"" but there's no agenda in this film.Once again, the Hollywood ""elite"" (Believe me, I use the term mockingly.) chooses to portray the American government (need I say, under President Bush) as a misguided, callous villian.Yet, somehow, these ""purveyors of pop-culture"" manage to ignore an enemy which straps explosive vests on mentally-handicapped innocents and then sends them into crowds to be blown up; or murders teachers for educating girls. People who do these things don't exist in their glitzy world or in their movies.It is the world our soldiers live in, however; and they, the president, and the intelligence agencies are the ones fighting this real enemy which is really bad. But no, not in ""Hollywood Land"" - There, America is the problem - a theme repeated in movie after movie ""ad nauseam.""These Kool-Aid drinkers believe, if they keep repeating these false premises enough, their view will seep into the public consciousness and become accepted by individuals who don't take the time to think for themselves or are credulous enough to believe such dribble.The movie's ending is laughable: a pensively dumb (pardon the oxymoron) Secretary of Defense states (with as much gravitas as this silly movie can muster) that we do need intelligence on terrorists but not at the expense of anyone's possible civil liberties. I thought I was listening to a Senate speech by the equally pensively dumb Harry Reid. I wouldn't mind all of this, but there are people who actually swallow this claptrap.Wouldn't it be nice to see one film from Hollywood that doesn't preach the left's political agenda? Wouldn't it be nice to see one film where we are the ""good guys"" and not the ""problem""? Sadly, such considerations don't enter the ""glitterati's weltanschauung.""Please, someone, with a modicum of intelligence and fair-mindedness, make a movie where the American military, intelligence services, and executive branch are the heroes, and the cold-blooded murderers we are fighting are presented for what they are - evil. I would also like to ask the ""movie world"" to give us a break with the propaganda, but that would be a waste of breath.

His twin has been murdered and he is forced to do things that he doesn't want to do (by a gentle, female voice on the phone), all with the help of an unwilling, single mother played by Michelle Monaghan. Torn between fear and duty to Country, LaBeouf  and Monaghan, follow a series of steps to unmask who is behind the plots and why. Rosario Dawson and Billy Bob Thornton are wonderful in their support roles as law enforcement officers, who soon begin to believe that everything is not as it seems.While I found the movie entertaining (chase scenes especially) and somewhat exciting, I don't think there was anything too original. This plot, the ""Big Brother/Artificial Intelligence"" gone mad concept, has been done several times before (Stealth, I-Robot, Terminator, Minority Report, Transformers, etc), and this one really didn't have anything new. Although the computer supposedly gained ""intelligence"" or at least began making decisions based on what ""it"" thought was best for the country, there still should have been more of a fail safe on the system in place. Now don't get me wrong, I am personally intrigued by artificial intelligence (in movies usually something that we mere humans have created) that ""realizes itself"" and attempts to erase mankind for the betterment of all. Terminator, for example, was the perfect balance between ""artificial intelligence and realization"" because they looked human but feel that the world would be a better place without us, while the computer generated female voice felt that our world would be a better place with a different President and Cabinet.

I expected to dislike it, and while there is a good long list reasons to dislike the film, it eventually won me over. While it isn't great cinema, it is entertaining if you can set aside disbelief for two hours.First, the bad: the plot line is an amalgamation of borrowed material from films as diverse as ENEMY OF THE STATE and THE MAN WHO KNEW TO MUCH, both better films by far. I never discount a film immediately for using things from other successful efforts, after all, virtually every movie made these days borrows from predecessors. However, when borrowed material is simply repackaged without much original imagination, it is much less acceptable. In this case, the end result of a plot is pretty much a patchwork quilt of things that feels disjointed. Conspiracy flicks have always had much in common, but EAGLE EYE seems a bit inbred.The second major problem is the vast array of things that 'just don't make sense.' I understand that not everything needs to be logical in a thriller, but the sheer mass of things that DON'T make sense in this movie is astounding. Without providing spoilers, there are numerous times when things are taken control of remotely where it would be absolutely impossible to do so. These occurrences ramp up near the middle-marker of the film, with one so ridiculous (the train scene) that is had me laughing out loud.However, this one does work as a thriller, albeit a stupid one. The action scenes are interesting, and some of them quite imaginative. There are also some impressive special effects that look fantastic on Blue Ray.I also enjoyed Billy Bob Thornton's performance, a sort of relaxed cool FBI agent with an obsessive-compulsive gene. He is enjoyable to watch and stands out as one of the few really believable elements of the film. Shia is well cast as the protagonist, a college drop out turned card shark. LaBeouf seems to be landing a lot of these underachiever hero roles lately (Transformers, Indiana Jones) and for good reason. He's good at them. However, I don't think he's a believable action star in general. He just doesn't have the gravitas or the physique, sort of the new Ben Affleck. For a role like this one, he's perfectOverall, this one might not be the best film ever, but it is entertaining if you can set logic aside for two hours.

This film features a super-computer capable of controlling the lives and actions of all the citizens of the United States.  Certain citizens are singled out by the computer for no apparent reason and drafted into the secret war being waged against the United States president for his violation of the Constitution.  What is most eerie about this film, is the way it shows that technology has overtaken society and all actions and thoughts are capable of being monitored.  In the film, both stars are singled out by the computer for various reasons and made to take part in the planned action against the president.  Since technological devices (including cell phones, blackberries, computers, street signs, and overhead projectors) are ubiquitous in any given city it is possible for the computer to access the location of the citizens anywhere and also impossible for them to escape its grip.  Thus, we learn how freedom is imperiled by emerging technologies which already are amongst us capable of controlling our very actions.  As it turns out, the entire computer system has been implemented in an effort to fight terrorism.  However, the costs prove to be enormous as it becomes apparent that in fighting terrorism all freedom has been lost.

Pair ""Shaman""","[2, 6]","As far as political thrillers go, I'm not a die hard fan of them but I can at least appreciate a good one when I see it, and this is one. Think of Eagle Eye as the Manchurian Candidate with 10x the action in it.I will at least give the producers of this movie some credit, they advertised this film very well. The first previews we saw were very enticing, and they left you with just barely enough info about what the movie was about to make you want to see it and find out more.Shia Labeouf does a very good job with his more serious roles, and is clearly growing as an actor. He handles his role well as the loser, underachiever brother, and the film establishes this early in the movie, giving him a goal to complete in the first 15 min of the movie.The plot is actually quite good, and the action is well spaced out, yet very fast paced. The bad guy in this may or may not shock you (I admit to being caught off guard) but ultimately it makes sense and makes the film not suck like it could have done so very easily if they weren't careful about it. There was a lot more work put into the story then I had anticipated considering how much action they had in it. In the end the movie was very balanced, and believable enough that you didn't have to suspend belief so much that it became unrealistic.Say what you will about Eagle Eye, all you nay-sayers. At the end of the day, it was a great summer action flick with a few political jabs thrown in to keep it intellectual, instead of just mindless running explosions. Most people will like this, and I think its worth owning since there more to it then just an action flick.

This core representation is strikingly similar in character and presentation to ""2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY"" and its computer HAL. The only difference is that HAL was ""male"" and in outer space... while this computer is ""female"" and in the pentagon.The photography is stellar... and the early action sequences are typical Spielberg... in other words... you find yourself saying... ""How did they film this?"" The supporting characters are excellently cast including Michael Chiklis as a Donald Rumsfeld -like- Secretary of Defense... Billy Bob Thornton as a dedicated FBI boss...

Rather, the viewer gets the feeling that their desperation is their main asset in surviving everything they get put through, and that helps the viewer identify and get emotionally involved with the characters.The movie is fast paced, with some pretty exciting action and chase sequences that also, fortunately, distract from the nonsensical premise and the ""character"" of the computer antagonist.I think this movie could have been a bit better if there was a believable human or group of humans utilizing this fictional technology for nefarious purposes, instead of the computer itself having ""artificial intelligence"" combined with a really bad attitude, leading it to go haywire.I sat entertained throughout the film, but came away with a sour taste due to the truly ridiculous premise and the naive presentation of technology that it is based upon.

Or maybe I'm just tired of seeing and hearing the same personality in every movie that he's in. That's not acting. Heath Ledger inThe Dark Knight...now THAT'S acting.Anyway, the first movie that I really noticed LeBeouf in, albeit briefly, wasI, Robot. And what a coincidence!...LeBeouf is now in a movie called Eagle Eye that steals the underlying principle of I, Robot. The rip-off was simply blatant to me. I don't want to spoil Eagle Eye for you if you're determined to see it, but, man, if you've not seen I, Robot and you're on the fence about Eagle Eye...just go with I, Robot.Eagle Eye has LeBeouf in the role of an ordinary guy that is suddenly thrust into the position of defending our national security...just like he was inTransformers. And like in Transformers, in Eagle Eye LeBeouf magically ""transforms"" into a super-soldier that can handle almost any situation. But it ain't easy being a super-soldier when you're up against a foe that can use anything...I mean ANYTHING...with a lens or something that can pick up sound waves to eavesdrop in on you're every move.Making a very good movie is certainly not beyond Eagle Director DJ Caruso; he just seems to prefer over the top lately. Eagle Eye is so far over the top it's at the bottom of the other side. Caruso's last movie,Disturbia, (that also starred LeBeouf) wasn't as far-fetched, but it was still over the top. However,Taking Livesshowed that Caruso has it in him to put out a better film.Joining LeBeouf is a pretty decent cast, including Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. But the good cast doesn't come close to making up for how unrealistic Eagle Eye is by the time it's all said and done.Like I said before: Eagle Eye is very similar to I, Robot...except I, Robot was very good...Eagle Eye isn't!

Threatening their lives and family, she pushes Jerry and Rachel into a series of increasingly dangerous situations, using the technology of everyday life to track and control their every move.In my opinion, I found the teaser trailer of ""Eagle Eye"" one of the best trailers I've ever seen in my entire life. It was like ""Cloverfield"": The trailers show little to nothing yet they want to make you see more, because, seriously, the trailer for ""Eagle Eye"" doesn't show jack. Well, that's the problem. Yeah, I agree that trailers aren't supposed to spoil a movie *cough*Quarantine, Alien vs. Predator: Requiem*cough* and ""Eagle Eye"" makes a perfect example to make an audience want more of what they're given. However, you don't know what to expect from a movie that gives you little information. What you find out in this movie will either make you happy, or make you disappointed.Well, I was happy. From the get go, I knew a movie like this would need a suspension of disbelief but I didn't know how much until twenty minutes into the movie. At first, I was NOT going along with it at all. I was laughing inside my head about how preposterous, ridiculous, and highly improbable this movie is. But somehow (impossibly, I must admit), I managed to pull myself together and go along with the ride. However, this film is more or less quite boring. I mean, the trailer was nothing like this movie. I expected more ""umph"" or energy put into this.One big problem with this movie is that, with an exception of the supporting actors, I never felt threat for the protagonists, much like ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" With all of these ""obey or die"" sorts of threats, the whole situation never felt dangerous until the last twenty minutes of the film. But of course, a person like me would shrug that off. Another problem is at first, the film would be a kinetic thrill ride. The next, it would change into a boring ""we must pursuit the people"" type of film. What I'm basically trying to say is that the pacing is all over the place.It's true when they say this movie borrows heavily from other films but I appreciated the originality put into this film. It's true when they say this movie has really big plot holes, similar to the complaints from the airplane thriller, ""Flightplan"" (although I'm one of the few who actually loved it) but I somehow also tolerated those as well. The performances by the two leads, Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are good enough. Everyone else in the supporting cast is good enough.One of the very *few* things I appreciated about this movie was the message it was trying to say about our society and you might think, ""Huh? This isn't one of those brainless popcorn movies?"" but you'll change your mind after seeing this movie. I also appreciated that this is not just another dumb, mindless film and that the filmmakers actually try to put some intelligence behind the script. Overall, this film could have, I mean, should have, been better from what the trailer made it out to be. It's a very flawed but *mostly* entertaining film nonetheless.

1213152,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B001L2ZSKS,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 3]","Movie - 4.0When I first saw the trailer, I had no clue what the movie would turn out to be other than some kind of conspiracy-thriller.  To my surprise, I saw it in theaters with a friend and enjoyed it, mainly for the chasing around, but also for the characters and the subtle philosophical conspiracies of privacy, control, and over-reliance on technology (which a lot of these titles usually do).  In particular, I really like Jerry Shaw (played by Shia LaBeouf) and the way he progresses through the movie.  His journey strikes me as a sort of intrinsic desire that everyone has to try their hardest in order to make an honest living, with some of us making it higher on the social chain, while others are.. well, not so fortunate.  Not that there's anything wrong with a social gap, for the pros and cons of every person are unique and useful in their own way (as we see in this movie).  I just think his initial circumstances and the results by the end of the film make for an entertaining, yet heartwarming experience.  The one problem I do have, however, is with the suspension of disbelief.  Now, I'm all for the outrageous and unbelievable (this coming from a guy who watches anime), but the concept of ARIA just feels a tad too out-of-touch with reality.  Everything in the movie before ""her"" actual appearance feels so realistic, almost gritty.  Then to be presented with what ""she"" is kinda' takes away that built up realism.  And because of that, I recommend that if you haven't seen this movie yet, that you take it with a grain of salt and consider this more of a popcorn flick, rather than a full-blown conspiracy-thriller with real-world machinations.  Keep your imagination open and you'll probably enjoy it.Video - 4.5Eagle Eye is presented to us by DreamWorks in MPEG-4 AVC with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  As I mentioned about enjoying most of the grittiness early on in the film, the visual style represents that feeling very well.  About half the of movie takes place in dark areas or at nighttime, so blacks levels are very important and do not disappoint.  Dark clothing, shadows, and pitch black darkness separate pretty well from one another, giving the overall film a great sense of realism and depth.  Accordingly, daytime and well-lit scenes also do an adequate job of displaying colors and contrast, exposing the finer details in flesh tones, backgrounds, objects, etc.  Some inconsistent levels of grain are present through a few shots, making this just short of demo material.  But given that the movie itself isn't even supposed to be that flashy, it's an excellent transfer, nonetheless.Audio - 5.0In addition to a near-flawless video encode, DreamWorks also provides a VERY capable TrueHD 5.1 track.  Dynamic range in combination with LFEs are most present during chase sequences and are accompanied by a bombastic musical score composed by Brian Tyler, who uses quite a bit of percussion, giving the overall sound stage a nice oomph to the sub-woofer.  Directionality goes from subtle to chaotic in the blink of an eye when on-screen action gets hectic, sending all sorts of sound effects from left to right, through the front, and back to the rears.  Dialogue is crisp and clear (yes, even Billy Bob sounds coherent) with zero dropout or discrepancy.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great this sounded, given it's not even an all-out action flick.  The car chase scene is reference quality.Extras - 4.0I always love seeing well-made production segments.  It shows me just how much work and effort goes into creating a film, giving me a greater sense of appreciation for what everyone in this industry seeks to accomplish.  While not as lengthy or in-depth as it could've been, the extras on this BD were enough to win me over.  The large majority of these extras include various interviews with director D.J. Caruso and other cast/crew, some brief commentary about the eerie reality of government privacy invasion, and then a few spots on design/shooting locale.  There's also a 7-minute gag reel, which I found hilarious given what Billy Bob was saying towards the end of it.Overall - 4.5Eagle Eye presents itself very well for a large majority of the movie.  It's an exhilarating conspiracy-thriller with lots of chases, plot twists, and even a little bit of character development.

1213153,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001L2ZSKS,trashcanman,"[5, 10]","Seriously, between this, the goofiness ofTransformers, the poor man's Hitchcock ofDisturbia, and the god-awfulness ofIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Mr. Lebeouf is on a very profitable bus straight to cheesytown.  Move over, Pauly Shore, there's a new star who we won't be able to take seriously in 5 years or so.  ""Eagle Eye"" is a film that will appeal to a broad audience of small-minded film fans.  People who consider themselves above science-fiction and yet have a complete inability to comprehend concepts like themes, metaphors, nuanced storytelling,  and imagination go ahead and change my rating to 5 stars, because this movie was made with you in mind.  But for those of you who have seen2001 - A Space Odyssey,V for VendettaThe Terminator,The Matrix, or any number of the other embarrassingly superior films casting light on the dangers that Artificial Intelligence and Big Brother could very well pose to our future should not waste two hours on this under any circumstance.Picture a team of producers brainstorming this concept.  Let's blatantly rip off the best science fiction stories, but set it in the present day and make it so ridiculously over-the-top that spaceships, time traveling, and aliens seem realistic in comparison.  Then disguise it as a PG-13 thriller, add tons of obnoxious and pointless big-budget effects, and then just a dash of everybody's favorite political sport: bashing the Bush administration.  The people who enjoy this sort of film will almost certainly be too dense to catch the relevancy, those that do take note will feel like super-geniuses for finally being able to read between the lines (at least when the lines are shoved right up into their face), and anybody with more than half a brain but no cinematic taste will likely overlook the fact that the film is as dumb as a sack of rocks because they will be too busy applauding it for stating the extremely obvious.  Around 75% of Americans say Bush is a tool.  The other 25% know he is, but are too obstinate to admit their side screwed them and the rest of the country over for no good reason.  Political commentary aimed at patting the vast majority of 20/20 hindsighters on it's collective back loses it's edge and it's point.  Even when ""Eagle Eye"" tries to do good, it fails because it's still just reiterating what we already know in the most tedious and corny way possible. I'll take my robots and spaceships now, please.""Eagle Eye"" is hardly the worst film out there and at least it tries on the surface to be politically relevant and reach the braindead masses.  That's more than a lot of the garbage out there gives us.  There are some good visuals, the performances aren't bad, and on some level I do enjoy the tribute paid to ""2001"". Also, Rosario Dawson is hot.  She usually picks her roles better than this (A LOT better), but I'll give her a pass this time.The way the film is set up as a by-the-books thriller that slowly reveals it's sci-fi twist may blow the minds of cinematic idiots, but to a fan of the art form, it's actually insulting.  It begins with mysterious phone calls to our two protagonists from an all-seeing, all-knowing, all-controlling feminine voice.  The voice coerces them with threats into performing task after task after boring task while the audience feels coerced into waiting to see what this is all about.  Long story, short: Operation Guillotine is in effect.  If our heroes don't think fast, a secret military project known as Skynet....err I mean Eagle Eye is going to behead the American government with a child's musical instrument.  Why this is a bad thing is never really explained. I guess it's because killing is, like, bad and stuff.We all know theNational Treasure-loving masses are easily impressed with needless plot complications that make no sort of realistic sense but sound cool on the surface. This one takes it to a new level.  The all-knowing, all-seeing aspect of this gets old fast and it takes up about 1 1/2 hours of the film.  It just pounds you in the face over and over until you are begging the story to progress in some meaningful way.  The plot itself is interesting in it's intricacy if that's your cup of tea, but that genre of storytelling wore out it's welcome with me by the time I finished the first of theOcean's Eleven/Twelve/Thirteenfilms.  We get it, you Hollywood writers have too much time on your hands and feel compelled to one-up every film that comes out with silly twists and super-complex plots that have no basis in reality and work big-budget effects in.  Wow, you guys are really smart but here's a thought: get some original ideas and stop copying off each other.  This cinematic inbreeding is killing the art form.  The economy has nothing to do with the film industry recession, just askThe Dark Knight.  People are just sick an tired of paying to see the same ridiculous nonsense over and over. Hollywood's elite need to get off their duff and give us some quality entertainment before we the fans put our own Operation Guillotine into effect.If ""Eagle Eye"" can serve as a buffer between the humdrum, dime-a-dozen mainstream thriller and legitimate creative science fiction works then perhaps it can do some good and convert some of the closed-minded to the real meat of genre filmmaking.  In spite of it's cheesiness and reliance on big dumb special effect and big dumb plot twists, its pretty watchable and should work for the sort of people that enjoy those sorts of movies and have a limited knowledge of cinema and politics.  But I am a geek and this movie gave me more eye-rolling and irritation than anything else.  If you are also an eye-rolling sci-fi nerd, you have been warned. If you are all about empty flash and big dumb boom, then enjoy but don't forget to check out the real deal as well.",2,Shia Lebeouf needs to fire his agent.,1230508800,"12 29,

1213154,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001L2ZSKS,trebe,"[0, 0]","Slick and flashy, and with some solid acting performances, Eagle Eye (2008) has some good things going for it, but lacking an intelligent plot, the film takes you on an exciting ride, only to leave you with a hollow unsatisfying finish.  The story is completely unbelievable, terribly ridiculous, far more complicated than it needs to be, and seems obsessed with displaying the marvels of technology.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.The premise of a master computer running amok has been explored before, in films like 2001 (1968), Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), and War Games (1983), just to name a few.  Eagle Eye follows along similar lines, as an incredibly sophisticated government computer named ARIA has become misguided, and has instituted an overly complex and intricate set of operations, intended to eliminate the President and most of the cabinet.  ARIA has the ability to do some amazing things, but instead of taking a more straightforward approach, ""she"" takes a most obscure and roundabout route to accomplishing its mission.Chicago resident Jerry Shaw (Shia LeBeouf), is drawn into ARIA's scheme, after his twin brother Ethan, an Air Force officer who works with ARIA, is killed.  Jerry is arrested by the FBI as a suspected terrorist, and questioned by special agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton).  In a device that quickly becomes overused, Jerry receives phone calls and other forms of messages from ARIA, giving him directions, or pointers on how to evade capture.  With ARIA's guidance, Jerry escapes from FBI custody, and hooks up with Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monahan), who is also following ARIA's instructions, in order to save her son's life.The pair survives a wild car chase, and then travel from Chicago to Indianapolis, where they commit an armed robbery.  Morgan is not far behind, and almost catches them after a circuitous pursuit through the baggage handling system at the Dayton airport.  Monahan and LaBeouf work well together, and their characters behave in a mostly plausible manner, despite being put a series of extremely ridiculous and convoluted gyrations, on their way to the Pentagon.  Thornton is also very solid, as the dogged FBI agent.The script goes to great lengths attempting to be clever, and amaze the viewer with ARIA's capabilities, but instead it mostly comes off as being gimmicky, extremely silly, and lacking any believability.  The worst aspect probably concerns ARIA itself, a high tech monstrosity with crazy architecture that is cooled by liquid nitrogen.  Like nearly every mega-computer in a Hollywood movie, the computer speaks in a human voice (in this case Julianne Moore's), describing step by step what it is doing, or what is happening.  Computer speech is just a plot device that has simply been done to death, as has the master computer gone wild idea.Eagle Eye features some good acting performances, and nicely executed action scenes, but the story that ties them together is unoriginal and without much substance.  Like many big budget Hollywood productions, the approach is to dazzle the audience, so that they don't notice that the cool thing they are watching, makes little sense within the context of the story.  Eagle Eye certainly does entertain, but the adventure that you are supposed to be intrigued by and be invested in, is actually ridiculously laughable fluff.

1213156,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001L2ZSKS,Turfseer,"[5, 7]","Eagle Eye is based on a Spielberg concept and executive produced by him. Spielberg is famous for successfully incorporating technical elements from famous films and directors into his own films but never quite developing his characters equal to the masters. Taking a cue from Spielberg, director D.J. Caruso has decided to shoot a film that is virtually all action and has virtually no character development. Take Shia LaBeouf's character, 'Jerry Shaw'. LaBeouf's plays him over the top, constantly angry and fighting with everybody, starting with his father (who he hates), spurning his offer to pay his tuition and return to college at Stanford where he had dropped out two years earlier. There is virtually nothing likable about our protagonist from the beginning! When a secret Department of Defense computer named Aria goes berserk and deposits over $700,000 into Shaw's bank account and then dumps a cache of terrorists' weapons in his apartment, leading to his arrest by the FBI, Shaw has to figure out who has set him up. He ends up escaping from the FBI's clutches with the help of the computer and then being paired with Michelle Monaghan who plays 'Rachel Holloman', a divorced single mother.Jerry and Rachel are ordered about by this computer under pain of death to go to and fro to all kinds of crazy locations, fulfilling the computer's various commands that don't seem to have a discernible purpose. The computer stays in contact with our two protagonists by all means of computer connected gadgetry (principally cell phones) but also at times through electronic devices (such as LCD screens at the subway) that are not ostensibly connected to computers. At first Jerry and Rachel are yelling at each other all the time but gradually come to realize that they have been victimized by a common enemy. In addition to surviving numerous car chases (which are edited so poorly, it's often impossible to know what's going on), they suddenly find the moxie to disarm armored truck guards. Meanwhile, they're being chased by an FBI agent played by an unhealthy looking Billy Bob Thornton who injects no humor, charm or wit into the role. The same goes for Zoe Perez who plays a Department of Defense investigator who eventually discovers why the computer has gone berserk. It seems that the computer has decided to eliminate the President and his underlings after the Military fails to heed its advice to abort a mission to kill a terrorist utilizing a drone somewhere in Afghanistan (or some nearby terrorist haven). The computer was 'locked' at the last second by Shaw's twin brother who mysteriously dies in a car accident at the beginning of the movie. The computer needs Jerry to unlock the command and eventually summons him to her lair.Eagle Eye borrows heavily from superior films such as I, Robot and Terminator II where the protagonist must disable the computer to keep it from committing its nefarious acts. I can't remember the exact manner in which Zoe Perez actually disables ""Aria"" here in Eagle Eye but the computer 'takedown' by Will Smith and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their respective films is much more exciting and sophisticated than what is depicted here.In an awkward tribute to Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", Shia is given the Jimmy Stewart part where he must prevent Rachel's son from hitting a high note while playing the Star Spangled Banner on his trumpet at the White House. The note will trigger an explosion that will eliminate the US chain of command from the President on down (In ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", Jimmy Stewart must prevent the assassination of a world leader while a symphony orchestra also hits a 'high note--masking the sound of the assassin's bullet). In addition to LaBeouf's one-note performance, my main problem with the film was that I couldn't understand why such a logical entity as a computer would be so illogical in constructing such a convoluted plot to accomplish its goals. What's surprising about Eagle Eye is that it actually starts out realistically (the botched terrorist strike actually looks like something that could happen!). I understand that action-adventure films aren't supposed to be 'realistic' but shouldn't they conform to some kind of internal logical?

Caruso).  He plays Jerry Shaw, a ne'er do well who works at Copy Cabana.  He's chronically broke and behind on his rent, but he receives a surprise when he uses an ATM - over $700,000 has been deposited into his account.  That's just the beginning, though; when he returns home, he has received numerous deliveries to his small apartment.  As he goes through the boxes, he's shocked that they contain guns and other suspicious items.  That's when he receives the first call from a mysterious female caller; she tells him to flee the scene or else he'll be captured by the FBI.  The rest of the film unfolds with the female caller dictating Jerry's moves and involves a dead twin brother, a sexy mother, and Billy Bob Thornton, among other oddities.""Eagle Eye"" is about what you would expect from a mid-level thriller.  There are some very good action scenes, particularly one involving a plane that tails Jerry's car into a tunnel.  LeBeouf is a likeable enough protagonist, and the movie has some nice twists.  There are also some clever scenes involving the female caller seeming to be omniscient and having unbelievable powers to control electronic items.  At the same time, the movie isn't very believable and does require a hefty suspension of disbelief.  It also cribs shamelessly from a number of other movies, including ""Enemy of the State"" and a dozen Hitchcock flicks.

I found the scenes between Jerry and Rachel on the bus and in the freighter to be particularly charming.

While the film definately delivers in the action department, there really isn't much else to it.The basic plot of the film centers on two ordinary people who are suddenly ""activated"" as terrorists and must flee for there lives while only taking mesages from all the electronic devices around them (cell phones, billboards, streaming text lines, LED signs, etc.).  As they continue to flee, they eventually figure out what is happening to them and begin hatching a plan to stop it.The reason why this movie fails, though, is that is doesn't focuses on the dramatic elements that are actually interesting.  Without giving any spoilers, the film would have been much better served focusing on two areas: 1. The technology behind why the two U.S. citizens are ""activated"" in the first place; and 2. The relationship between the two lead characters played by Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.Instead, however, this film is little more than one pulse-pounding action sequence after another with just enough (but much too little) exposition to move the plot forward to the next crazy chase scene.  Plus, the focus of the film seemed to be on the fact that the two citizens can be communicated with or found by any electronic device.  However, it covered much of the same territory that Will Smith and Gene Hackman did in Enemy of the State a decade ago.  There wasn't enough new material to really hook me into this plot thread.Thus, if you a huge fan of non-stop action in films, you will love this film.  If you need some character and plot development to keep your interest, though, then skip this movie, as you will just be disappointed.",2,"Too Much Action, Too Little Acting",1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,1768,"['film', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'advertised', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'aspect', 'goverment', 'intruige', 'Big', 'Brother', 'watching', 'film', 'definately', 'action', 'department', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'it.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'centers', 'two', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'suddenly', 'activated', 'terrorists', 'must', 'flee', 'lives', 'only', 'taking', 'mesages', 'electronic', 'devices', 'cell', 'phones', 'billboards', 'streaming', 'text', 'lines', 'LED', 'signs', 'etc.', 'continue', 'flee', 'eventually', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'begin', 'hatching', 'plan', 'stop', 'it.The', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'though', ""n't"", 'focuses', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'are', 'actually', 'interesting', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'served', 'focusing', 'two', 'areas', '1', 'technology', 'why', 'two', 'U.S.', 'citizens', 'are', 'activated', 'first', 'place', '2', 'relationship', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'played', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan.Instead', 'however', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'pulse-pounding', 'action', 'sequence', 'just', 'enough', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'exposition', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'next', 'crazy', 'chase', 'scene', 'focus', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'fact', 'two', 'citizens', 'can', 'be', 'communicated', 'found', 'electronic', 'device', 'However', 'covered', 'much', 'same', 'territory', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'did', 'Enemy', 'State', 'decade', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'new', 'material', 'really', 'hook', 'plot', 'thread.Thus', 'huge', 'fan', 'non-stop', 'action', 'films', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'need', 'character', 'plot', 'development', 'keep', 'interest', 'though', 'then', 'skip', 'movie', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'disappointed']",Eagle Eye
