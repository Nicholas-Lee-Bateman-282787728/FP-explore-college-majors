But recently I had the opportunity to purchase the widescreen DVD and got to watch the non-""edited for television & modified to fit your screen"" feature film and found it to be a very good movie. With strong performances, a great plot, and exciting action, its now become a favorite of mine.The period is the early 1900's. John Wayne plays Jacob McCandles, an old-fashion cowboy out of place in the ""modern era."" Having been estranged from his family for over 10 years he is called back when the grandson he never knew has been kidnapped and held for $1,000,000 ransom. It's up to Jake, his Indian friend Sam Sharpnose (played decently by Bruce Cabot) and his two sons (Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum) to retrieve the boy at all costs. What follows is an adventure that brings father and sons together as they become dependent on each other to survive the coming violence.What makes this movie great is the cast. Besides Wayne and Cabot, we get the always outstanding Maureen O'Hara as the matriarch of the McCandles family, hard-nosed and stubborn in her devotion to her family. Richard Boone plays the leader of the outlaw gang and brings his own typical flair to the part. Two of the best scenes are when he verbally spars with Jake, each trying to dominate the other and neither one successful. Harry Carey, Glen Corbett, and a young Bobby Vinton in a bit part, rounds out the cast.What fails in this movie though, is the constant attempts at levity. Silly antics coupled with silly music takes the hard-edge of the movie away at the wrong times. This easily could have been an epic film that bordered on the intensity of John Ford'sThe Searchers [HD-DVD]. Instead, just as things begin to get tense, we're treated to bucking mules sending people into the mud, or a silly bar fight between Jake and a mountain of a man named Mr. Sweet. I think at times the film makers weren't sure what kind of western they wanted to make so they threw a bit of everything into it with mixed results.That aside, though, the final confrontation between the McCandles and the outlaws takes us back to the gritty, hard-edged film. Violent, but not graphically so, and intense, it absolutely makes this an above average western. I would strongly recommend this to any John Wayne fan, and with some reservations, to the western fan in general",4,A Solid John Wayne Western!,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,2462,"['years', 'watched', 'film', 'TV', 'found', 'be', 'so-so', 'John', 'Wayne', 'effort', 'interesting', 'kind', 'average', 'Wayne', 'films', 'go', 'recently', 'had', 'opportunity', 'purchase', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'got', 'watch', 'non-', 'edited', 'television', 'modified', 'fit', 'screen', 'feature', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'strong', 'performances', 'great', 'plot', 'exciting', 'action', 'now', 'become', 'favorite', 'mine.The', 'period', 'early', '1900', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Jacob', 'McCandles', 'old-fashion', 'cowboy', 'place', 'modern', 'era', 'Having', 'been', 'estranged', 'family', '10', 'years', 'called', 'back', 'when', 'grandson', 'never', 'knew', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'held', '1,000,000', 'ransom', 'up', 'Jake', 'Indian', 'friend', 'Sam', 'Sharpnose', 'played', 'decently', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'two', 'sons', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Christopher', 'Mitchum', 'retrieve', 'boy', 'costs', 'What', 'adventure', 'father', 'sons', 'together', 'become', 'dependent', 'other', 'survive', 'coming', 'violence.What', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Wayne', 'Cabot', 'get', 'always', 'outstanding', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'matriarch', 'McCandles', 'family', 'hard-nosed', 'stubborn', 'devotion', 'family', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'leader', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'own', 'typical', 'flair', 'part', 'Two', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'verbally', 'Jake', 'trying', 'dominate', 'other', 'one', 'successful', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Glen', 'Corbett', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Vinton', 'bit', 'part', 'out', 'cast.What', 'movie', 'constant', 'attempts', 'levity', 'Silly', 'antics', 'coupled', 'silly', 'music', 'hard-edge', 'movie', 'away', 'wrong', 'times', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'epic', 'film', 'bordered', 'intensity', 'John', ""Ford'sThe"", 'Searchers', '[', 'HD-DVD', ']', 'Instead', 'just', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'tense', ""'re"", 'treated', 'bucking', 'mules', 'sending', 'people', 'mud', 'silly', 'bar', 'fight', 'Jake', 'mountain', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Sweet', 'think', 'times', 'film', 'makers', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'western', 'wanted', 'make', 'so', 'threw', 'bit', 'everything', 'mixed', 'results.That', 'aside', 'final', 'confrontation', 'McCandles', 'outlaws', 'back', 'gritty', 'hard-edged', 'film', 'Violent', 'not', 'graphically', 'so', 'intense', 'absolutely', 'above', 'average', 'western', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'reservations', 'western', 'fan', 'general']",N/A

In this movie, however, the violence, and I mean little kids getting killed, a dog being slashed to death, guys being gut-shot every two to three minutes, or so, is gruesome and tiresome.  On top of that, yuck-yuck humor is thrown in with the same regularity:  A search is being organized to find a kidnapped child, but his uncles and grandfather still have time to get into a zany, mud-splashed fight in the yard while his sexy, hot grandma chuckles as she watches.  Throw in the lighthearted sound track that plays as guys are shot to death, and this movie gets even more bizarre, almost on a surreal level.  All in all, I think the screenwriter and director must have been doing lots of alcohol and other drugs as they put this stinker together.  Oh yeah, Duke is pretty terrible in it, as well.

269550,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301802330,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","Seems like John Wayne got better and better scripts as he got older. This is one of the ones he did with his own production company, so presumably he had a lot of control over the script and the way it was played out.It's a very interesting set-up from the get-go. The year is 1909, and as the opening credits tell us, it was getting quite civilized in the east, but still pretty wild in the west. The large, prosperous McCandles ranch, is within ""spitting distance"" of the Rio Grande. That is, bandits can come up to the ranch, create havoc, and cross the river to escape justice in Mexico.Big Jake McCandles (John Wayne) left the ranch some 18 years ago, when his wife Martha (Maureen O'Hara) apparently kicked him out for being a philanderer. One day nine desperadoes ride into the ranch and kidnap Little Jake, Big Jake's grandson, killing everyone they can in the process. They toss a $1 million ransom note to Martha McCandles and ride off.The sheriff wants to go after them with his newfangled automobiles, a friend wants to take ten of his best Texas rangers and go after them, but Martha calls for Big Jake to take the big red money box to the kidnappers. The oldest son, apparently the boy's father, is laid up with two or three bullet wounds, but the younger two are available to go with him. The middle boy says he'll go with the automobiles; the youngest one rides a motorcycle.Of course, the automobiles and the motorcycle are out of the story pretty quickly in that rough country, so Jake, his two sons, and his Indian friend continue on horseback, leading a mule that carries the strong box.I won't tell you any more, except that Little Jake's courage turns out to have a lot to do with getting him home safely. As in the best John Wayne films, his triumph is as much about outsmarting the bad guys as it is about courage or good shooting. It's got some humor, lots of action, and great scenery, which is standard for Wayne films, too.

Not the best I've seen but not bad either, one reviewer said that there was no plot. Obviously they really didn't watch this movie, Wayne plays Big Jake McCandles, who hasn't seen his wife in 18 years, and is called home after his grandson is kidnapped by a vicious gang of outlaws, and this gang is vicious. And of course, the story is set in 1901, so it's also a glimpse into the old west style of justice vs automobiles and motorcycles. All on the same side, Big Jake and his Indian scout go after the outlaws on horses. While the Sheriff and Jake's two sons give chase in cars and on motorcycles, needless to say. The horses win out, as the gang ambushes the sheriff and his posse. So Big Jake, the scout and his two sons must push on ahead, with the ransom money. Now, there is a twist at the end involving the money. That quite honestly, you would never see coming in a million years. Big Jake and his wife, don't like each other. But she hates the outlaws more than she hates Big Jake, So they switch the money. For news paper clippings, a brilliant move.

A gang of vicious kidnappers attacks a ranch, kill several people and make off with the young grandson of Jacob McCandles (John Wayne) and Martha McCandles (Maureeen O'Hara). They've been estranged for years, but she calls on him to rescue their grandson. Big Jake is a crusty, aging rancher with -- for his grandson -- a heart as big as his gut. He sets out with the ransom, a couple of his sons who don't know him, an Indian Scout and a dog. And he finds the kid. In the process he gets reacquainted with his sons and wipes out the gang, led by Richard Boone in a really first-rate performance.This movie is a very pleasant way to waste a couple of hours. It has it's drawbacks. His two sons are played by Patrick Wayne, one of Wayne's own, and Christopher Mitchum, one of Robert's. They're both good looking guys but they have the acting ability of two logs. The story is predictable. But the movie works for me because...--The relationship between McCandles and the sons is prickly and interesting.--The relationship between McCandles and his grandson is genuinely endearing. The last of the movie, during the actual rescue, Wayne does an excellent job of working with the boy.--Maureen O'Hara's role is small but important. It turns out she is just as ruthless as her estranged husband can be.--And maybe most of all, there's Richard Boone. He was a charismatic actor and is more than able to stand up to Wayne's star power. The confrontation between the two at the end has a lot of energy.--And every now and then there's some amusing dialogue...---Jake : And now you understand. Anything goes wrong, anything at all...your fault, my fault, nobody's fault...it won't matter...I'm gonna blow your head off. No matter what else happens, no matter who gets killed, I'm gonna blow your head off.---O'Brian : They tell me you killed two good men in a fair fight tonight.

John Wayne's ""The Searchers,"" a very similar movie story-wise, gets a lot better press than this film but ""Big Jake"" is just as good, if not better.To be fair, while the gunfights in here were well done, the fistfights were an insult. Whenever someone got slugged, such as Wayne belting his kids, it had no effect on them, except just to knock them down for a second or two. In real life, folks, chances are you will knocked unconscious if you are hit in the face, especially by a powerful man like Wayne. This has been a ludicrous fact-of-life, however, in all films for 100 years, not just here.Other than that, the film is a straight hard-nosed one with Wayne and adversary Richard Boone both fascinating. The dialog between the two was especially fun to hear. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Boone did not have enough lines in this film. Wayne's real-life sons in this film didn't impress me with their acting but they weren't horrible either.Bruce Cabot was a hoot as an old Indian friend of Wayne's.As with most westerns, there is some nice scenery so if you have the opportunity, watch this on widescreen DVD.

I enjoyed him coming up with that a great deal.  This is a very good Waynestern and has so many of the classic elements we enjoy.  Wayne is a loner ""Big Jake"" McCandles, oh he's married and has three sons and even an eight year old grandson he has never seen.  His estranged wife, Martha (played by Maureen O'Hara), is very rich and runs a beautiful spread.  Everyone on her staff is devoted to her and keeping their ranch running like a well oiled machine.But when John Fain (wonderfully done by Richard Boone) and his gang ride into the ranch and shoot up the place, paradise is lost.  Several of Martha's employees die or are terribly wounded trying to defend the place against the unprovoked and unexpected assault.  One of those wounded is one of Martha's sons, the father of her grandson.  It turns out that the goal of the assault is to kidnap the Little Jake (Ethan Wayne, one of John Wayne's real life sons).  The kidnappers want a million dollars delivered to a place of their choosing.  Everyone realizes that getting the boy back is a long shot even if the ransom is paid.Word gets to Big Jake and he comes back to help deliver the money and get the boy back.  The army and the newly motorized Rangers also offer their help, as do two of Jake's other sons, James (Patrick Wayne), and Michael (Christopher Mitchum).  The story of the journey to the inevitable final confrontation is full of good stuff.  Of course the older boys resent their father abandoning the family.  They offer a theory or two, but we are never really told why Big Jake is estranged, but father and sons find ways to unite again even if they can't resolve their generational and technological differences with their father.  It is 1909 after all!  There is also some humor along the way, especially the way Big Jake decides to create a diversion by singling out the orneriest guy in a saloon.  Another running joke in the film happens every time Big Jake identifies himself to a stranger, but I'll let you watch the film and enjoy the responses.At one point on the trail Big Jake delivers this line to Fain (without either admitting their identities to each other), ""And now you understand. Anything goes wrong, anything at all... your fault, my fault, nobody's fault... it won't matter - I'm gonna blow your head off. No matter what else happens, no matter who gets killed I'm gonna blow your head off.""  What could more classic Wayne than that!The final confrontation is well handled and has some twists and bends that keep it from being just another Western shootout or even a Waynestern shootout.  I think this is a very good movie and very much worth seeing.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,"One of Wayne's later films that holds up very well, especially with Richard Boone",1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,2849,"['youngest', 'son', 'are', 'enjoying', 'going', 'range', 'Westerns', 'together', 'coined', 'term', 'Waynesterns', 'whole', 'category', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Westerns', 'enjoyed', 'coming', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'very', 'good', 'Waynestern', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'elements', 'enjoy', 'Wayne', 'loner', 'Big', 'Jake', 'McCandles', 'married', 'three', 'sons', 'even', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'never', 'seen', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Martha', 'played', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'very', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'spread', 'Everyone', 'staff', 'devoted', 'keeping', 'ranch', 'running', 'well', 'oiled', 'machine.But', 'when', 'John', 'Fain', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'gang', 'ride', 'ranch', 'shoot', 'up', 'place', 'paradise', 'lost', 'Several', 'Martha', 'employees', 'die', 'are', 'terribly', 'wounded', 'trying', 'defend', 'place', 'unprovoked', 'unexpected', 'assault', 'One', 'wounded', 'one', 'Martha', 'sons', 'father', 'grandson', 'out', 'goal', 'assault', 'kidnap', 'Little', 'Jake', 'Ethan', 'Wayne', 'one', 'John', 'Wayne', 'real', 'life', 'sons', 'kidnappers', 'want', 'million', 'dollars', 'delivered', 'place', 'choosing', 'Everyone', 'getting', 'boy', 'back', 'long', 'shot', 'even', 'ransom', 'paid.Word', 'Big', 'Jake', 'back', 'help', 'deliver', 'money', 'get', 'boy', 'back', 'army', 'newly', 'motorized', 'Rangers', 'also', 'offer', 'help', 'do', 'two', 'Jake', 'other', 'sons', 'James', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Michael', 'Christopher', 'Mitchum', 'story', 'journey', 'inevitable', 'final', 'confrontation', 'full', 'good', 'stuff', 'course', 'older', 'boys', 'resent', 'father', 'abandoning', 'family', 'offer', 'theory', 'two', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'told', 'why', 'Big', 'Jake', 'estranged', 'father', 'sons', 'find', 'ways', 'unite', 'again', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'generational', 'technological', 'differences', 'father', '1909', 'also', 'humor', 'way', 'especially', 'way', 'Big', 'Jake', 'create', 'diversion', 'singling', 'out', 'orneriest', 'guy', 'saloon', 'running', 'joke', 'film', 'time', 'Big', 'Jake', 'stranger', ""'ll"", 'let', 'watch', 'film', 'enjoy', 'responses.At', 'one', 'point', 'trail', 'Big', 'Jake', 'delivers', 'line', 'Fain', 'admitting', 'identities', 'other', 'now', 'understand', 'Anything', 'wrong', 'anything', 'fault', 'fault', 'nobody', 'fault', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'m"", 'gon', 'blow', 'head', 'matter', 'what', 'else', 'matter', 'who', 'killed', ""'m"", 'gon', 'blow', 'head', 'What', 'could', 'more', 'classic', 'Wayne', 'final', 'confrontation', 'well', 'handled', 'twists', 'bends', 'keep', 'being', 'just', 'Western', 'shootout', 'even', 'Waynestern', 'shootout', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'seeing.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",N/A

The issue I am reviewing here is in VHS Format, and is a 20th Century Fox Selections release (ISBN 0-7939-7149-7).  The visual and sound quality was excellent.  Being on the cheap side, I check this copy out from the library where I am sure it has been played and replayed many times and the tape has held up well.As to the plot, it has been covered pretty well by other reviewers here.  The one (for me) significant plot difference from many of the other John Wayne Westerns was the fact that the violence in this film was a bit more graphic and a bit more intense than in most I have seen.  This is not a bad thing actually, it is simply different.  Perhaps, since this was one of Wayne's later films, he was only responding to public demand.  To slowly pick apart and dissect the artistic value of any Wayne western is an exercise best left for those who care about such things.  To me that is much like examining each and ever bite of a good cheeseburger...hey, it you like it, who cares?No, the plot, while good (although I have seen better) as far as I am concerned, was not what drew me to this film.  The thing that attracted me most was of course John Wayne.  Secondly we have Richard Boone, one of the most under rated actors in the history of Hollywood and of course the beautiful, talented and icon, Maurean O'Hara.  This wonderful actress appeared in five pictures with Wayne and even though her role in this film was extremely limited, it was still worth watching.  Besides those facts, I just simply enjoy watching old westerns and I enjoy watching John Wayne.Even though Wayne is showing his age in this film, the part he plays is age appropriate and he is still able to pull his typical John Wayne one liners off perfectly and even did a pretty good job of the various stunts and fight scenes.All in all the bad guys are really, really bad, John Wayne is John Wayne and this was a very nice 109 minutes of entertainment.  I must say, like several other reviewers, that I was not at all happy with the ending of this particular movie and am not sure what Wayne, the Director, was thinking.I have to give this one 5 stars simply because.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,"HIS BEST FILM?

The Duke stars Jacob MacCandles (maybe a reflection of his real life family situation) as a tough man, estranged from his wife and grown sons.  Bobby Vinton gives a quickie performance as Wayne's eldest son, shot when (the great) Richard Boone and his band of cutthroats nearly slaughter all on Jacob's ranch in the kidnapping of his grandson (played by Wayne youngest son Ethan).  Patrick Wayne, his real son, plays second eldest son and youngest son, Michael, is played by Christopher Mitchum (Robert Mitchum's son!).In tow are Wayne regulars, Harry Carey (disgusting tobacco chewing baddie), Bruce Cabot as the Indian tracker showing age with Jacob, Glen Corbett as breed the fast gun that faces off against Patrick Wayne in a gun fight, the most natural actor to ever grace the screen, the late Richard Boone, and a lovely appearance by the eternally beautiful Maureen O'Hara, once again playing John's long suffering wife whot loves him, but cannot live with him.It is super to watch Wayne with Cabot, Carey, Boone and O'Hara, and Jim Davis (later rose to fame once more as Jock Ewing of Dallas) and though the film is intensely violent, I don't see it was gratuitous.  The violence came from the end of a very violent era, times were changing, but not fast enough.  The violence of the kidnappers had to be there to show Wayne's to-the-wall rescue of his small grandson was called for.  Wayne's character was a violent man when the times called for it, but it was just as willing to let things go - if ONLY the other person walked away.He worked well with his sons and Mitchum, and the interaction between Jacob and his two sons provides the Wayne brand humour in the film.The times were changing for the code of the old west, and in the same way, times were changing for John Wayne....I give Wayne credit for not pulling punches in a film that does him credit.",5,don't call him DADDY!!!!!!!!!,1040774400,"12 25, 2002",2002,1970,"['film', 'one', 'better', 'later-day', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films', 'strangely', 'violent', 'Wayne', 'film', 'Duke', 'stars', 'Jacob', 'MacCandles', 'maybe', 'reflection', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'situation', 'tough', 'man', 'estranged', 'wife', 'grown', 'sons', 'Bobby', 'Vinton', 'quickie', 'performance', 'Wayne', 'eldest', 'son', 'shot', 'when', 'great', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'band', 'cutthroats', 'nearly', 'slaughter', 'Jacob', 'ranch', 'kidnapping', 'grandson', 'played', 'Wayne', 'youngest', 'son', 'Ethan', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'real', 'son', 'second', 'eldest', 'son', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Mitchum', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'son', '.In', 'tow', 'are', 'Wayne', 'regulars', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'disgusting', 'tobacco', 'chewing', 'baddie', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'Indian', 'tracker', 'showing', 'age', 'Jacob', 'Glen', 'Corbett', 'breed', 'fast', 'gun', 'off', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'gun', 'fight', 'most', 'natural', 'actor', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'late', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'lovely', 'appearance', 'eternally', 'beautiful', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'once', 'again', 'playing', 'John', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'whot', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'him.It', 'super', 'watch', 'Wayne', 'Cabot', 'Carey', 'Boone', ""O'Hara"", 'Jim', 'Davis', 'later', 'rose', 'fame', 'once', 'more', 'Jock', 'Ewing', 'Dallas', 'film', 'intensely', 'violent', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'came', 'end', 'very', 'violent', 'era', 'times', 'were', 'changing', 'not', 'fast', 'enough', 'violence', 'kidnappers', 'had', 'be', 'there', 'show', 'Wayne', 'to-the-wall', 'rescue', 'small', 'grandson', 'was', 'called', 'Wayne', 'character', 'was', 'violent', 'man', 'when', 'times', 'called', 'was', 'just', 'willing', 'let', 'things', 'go', 'ONLY', 'other', 'person', 'walked', 'away.He', 'worked', 'well', 'sons', 'Mitchum', 'interaction', 'Jacob', 'two', 'sons', 'Wayne', 'brand', 'humour', 'film.The', 'times', 'were', 'changing', 'code', 'old', 'west', 'same', 'way', 'times', 'were', 'changing', 'John', 'Wayne', '.I', 'give', 'Wayne', 'credit', 'not', 'pulling', 'punches', 'film', 'credit']",N/A
269579,A11PTCZ2FM2547,6301802330,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","The Duke hardly entered the twilight of his cinematic career with a whimper; he made some overwhelmingly violent shoot-'em-ups during these years.  Case in point:  1971's BIG JAKE, with John Wayne playing Jacob McCandles--one mean, tough-as-nails hombre (believed by his adversaries to have long been dead) leading a rescue party into Mexico circa 1909 to (allegedly) pay a hefty ransom and obtain his small grandson (whom he's never met).  There are so many problems with this film I scarcely know where to begin; here's but one silly example:  When Jacob's son Michael (Christopher Mitchum, the real-life son of Robert Mitchum) claims to be ""proficient"" with a rifle, Wayne challenges him to shoot a buck some 500 yards from their camp.  Once Michael complies (""That's some good shootin',"" Jacob gushes) he then asks his father if he would like to test his marksmanship, to which Jacob guffaws, ""I couldn't even see that far!""Again, but one example.  The film is plagued with dialogue and pacing awkwardness (hopefully Christopher Mitchum didn't quit his day job),  a climactic bloodletting scene that is as silly as it is over the top, and no Western, repeat, no Western should have Bobby Vinton appear in it, even if it's just a cameo as eldest McCandles son Jeff (who promptly gets shot in the movie's opening scene).  But still. . .BIG JAKE is just grand fun to watch.  The Duke plays well off of his own son Patrick Wayne (playing middle son James, who's none too happy to be reunited with his estranged ""Daddy""), Richard Boone is as good as it gets as a Western villain, and when it comes to teeth-gritting machismo no one is tougher than Wayne.  The Duke busts noggins, shoots up bad guys, and sends them to the grim reaper without breaking a sweat; for John Wayne fans wanting violence over substance BIG JAKE definitely fills the bill.--D.

269583,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6301802330,Erik North,"[2, 2]","Often it's hard to separate the man from his arch-conservative politics, but the fact is that John Wayne defined what it meant to be a star in Hollywood for decades on end.  And while his way of making films may have fallen into a routine under his Batjac production company during the last decade and a half of his life without the guiding hands of a John Ford, a Howard Hawks, or a Henry Hathaway, he still managed to pull it off time and time again.  Such is the case with BIG JAKE, released in 1971.Here, his character is Jacob McCandles, the patriarch of a south Texas ranching family who is presumed to be dead because nobody has seen him in eighteen years.  But he is forced by his estranged wife (Maureen O'Hara, in her final film with Wayne before his death and her 20 year-long retirement) to find and kill the outlaw gang who killed several of her ranch hands, badly wounded one of his sons (Bobby Vinton), and made off with his grandson (Ethan Wayne).  Along the way to find his grandson, which takes him across the Rio Grande into Mexico, he is given the seemingly even more onerous task of forcing his kids (Chris Mitchum, Glenn Corbett, Patrick Wayne) NOT to call him Daddy.Besides everything else, Wayne and his trusty Indian sidekick (Bruce Cabot) are carrying a storebox with what is supposedly a $1 million ransom as authorized by the leader of the outlaws (Richard Boone, a very efficient villainous performance).  Of course, Wayne doesn't exactly plan on coming through with that ransom, and you can pretty much guess what happens next...BIG JAKE is every bit as predictable as Wayne's other westerns in terms of plot, with the exceptions of THE COWBOYS and THE SHOOTIST (neither of which were made under the Batjac banner), but it works all the same, largely due to Wayne's always-formidable presence, but also in no small measure to Boone's villainous outlaw.  It also benefits from the excellent cinematography of William Clothier, who shot many Westerns, both with and without Wayne in them, done on location in what had become Wayne's favorite western locale--the high Mexican desert around Durango.  George Sherman, who had directed Wayne in several westerns in the early 1930s prior to the Duke attaining stardom in STAGECOACH, managed to direct with enough panache to cover the fact that he wasn't in the best of health at the time (a fact that Wayne covered up by directing a number of scenes himself but still giving the directing credit to Sherman).  The only serious disappointment in BIG JAKE is the fact that Wayne and O'Hara don't have enough screen time together (given the chemistry they showed in Ford's 1952 classic THE QUIET MAN).And yet despite its flaws, there's no denying that BIG JAKE just plain works, not only for die-hard fans of the Duke, but for people who just appreciate any westerns (although this one is unique among Wayne's westerns by being the most overtly violent, hence the 'PG-13' rating).  It may not be STAGECOACH or THE SEARCHERS, but then what is?Just don't call him ""Daddy"", or he'll finish the fight.",4,BIG JAKE--Call Him Anything But Daddy,1180569600,"05 31, 2007",2007,3067,"['hard', 'separate', 'man', 'arch-conservative', 'politics', 'fact', 'John', 'Wayne', 'defined', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'decades', 'end', 'way', 'making', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'fallen', 'routine', 'Batjac', 'production', 'company', 'last', 'decade', 'half', 'life', 'guiding', 'hands', 'John', 'Ford', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'still', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Such', 'case', 'BIG', 'JAKE', 'released', '1971.Here', 'character', 'Jacob', 'McCandles', 'patriarch', 'south', 'Texas', 'ranching', 'family', 'who', 'presumed', 'be', 'dead', 'nobody', 'seen', 'eighteen', 'years', 'forced', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'final', 'film', 'Wayne', 'death', '20', 'year-long', 'retirement', 'find', 'kill', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'who', 'killed', 'several', 'ranch', 'hands', 'badly', 'wounded', 'one', 'sons', 'Bobby', 'Vinton', 'made', 'off', 'grandson', 'Ethan', 'Wayne', 'way', 'find', 'grandson', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'Mexico', 'given', 'seemingly', 'even', 'more', 'onerous', 'task', 'forcing', 'kids', 'Chris', 'Mitchum', 'Glenn', 'Corbett', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'NOT', 'call', 'Daddy.Besides', 'everything', 'else', 'Wayne', 'trusty', 'Indian', 'sidekick', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'are', 'carrying', 'storebox', 'what', 'supposedly', '1', 'million', 'ransom', 'authorized', 'leader', 'outlaws', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'very', 'efficient', 'villainous', 'performance', 'course', 'Wayne', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'plan', 'coming', 'ransom', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'BIG', 'JAKE', 'bit', 'as', 'predictable', 'Wayne', 'other', 'westerns', 'terms', 'plot', 'exceptions', 'THE', 'COWBOYS', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'were', 'made', 'Batjac', 'banner', 'same', 'largely', 'due', 'Wayne', 'always-formidable', 'presence', 'also', 'small', 'measure', 'Boone', 'villainous', 'outlaw', 'also', 'benefits', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'William', 'Clothier', 'who', 'shot', 'many', 'Westerns', 'Wayne', 'done', 'location', 'what', 'had', 'become', 'Wayne', 'favorite', 'western', 'locale', 'high', 'Mexican', 'desert', 'around', 'Durango', 'George', 'Sherman', 'who', 'had', 'directed', 'Wayne', 'several', 'westerns', 'early', '1930s', 'prior', 'Duke', 'attaining', 'stardom', 'STAGECOACH', 'managed', 'direct', 'enough', 'panache', 'cover', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'health', 'time', 'fact', 'Wayne', 'covered', 'up', 'directing', 'number', 'scenes', 'still', 'giving', 'directing', 'credit', 'Sherman', 'only', 'serious', 'disappointment', 'BIG', 'JAKE', 'fact', 'Wayne', ""O'Hara"", 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'given', 'chemistry', 'showed', 'Ford', '1952', 'classic', 'THE', 'QUIET', 'MAN', '.And', 'yet', 'flaws', 'denying', 'BIG', 'JAKE', 'just', 'plain', 'works', 'not', 'only', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Duke', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'appreciate', 'westerns', 'one', 'unique', 'Wayne', 'westerns', 'being', 'most', 'overtly', 'violent', 'hence', ""'PG-13"", 'rating', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'STAGECOACH', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'then', 'what', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'Daddy', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'fight']",N/A

""The War Wagon"" was his 'caper' film, and this one, ""Big Jake"",  was an attempt to incorporate elements of the suspense film, mixing dark violence and an extended, suspenseful climax with the usual John Wayne elements.  The result is mixed at times, particularly Christopher Mitchum's ""acting"", but the film is well-paced and crisply edited. Richard Boone steals the film as the scary, very believable villain.  His weary, frustrated delivery of the line ""Who are you?"" near the end of the film shows what a great actor can do with a simple line. The Elmer Bernstein score is one of his best Western efforts (and finally available on CD in a limited edition).  A couple of notable 'flubs'.  According to the plot, Wayne has been estranged from his family over ten years, away for so long he is unaware that he has a ten year old grandson. Yet, when told that a ranch employee and his family have been killed by the kidnappers, he asks ""the little boy, too?""  We've already seen this boy killed and he cannot be ten years old yet.  So Jake knows the servant had a child, but not his own son?  Later in the film Wayne punches Christopher Mitchum and, as Mitchum falls, the sound of an SLR with a speedwinder taking pictures can clearly be heard on the soundtrack.

It just seemed to not be made with any effort to make it seem real. The storyline was okay but poorly executed. It almost seemed like they were in a hurry to finish the movie so really poor quality scenes were left. If about 20 scenes were redone with a little better writing the movie could have been improved 100%. This most likely would have taken just a week or so to rework the scenes.Richard Boone is always good and so is John Wayne. Lots of the scenes were great and it seems kind of poor direction to not redo the junk parts of the movie. It was many moons ago so who really cares. I just watched Red River and True Grit and High Noon and Winchester 73 and they were made well and with meaning. Those 4 movies must have had the scenes redone until they were good.By redone I mean even rewriting some of the goofy dialogue and changing script to seem more real.

269592,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6301802330,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","The Duke wasn't above indulging in nepotism. Take BIG JAKE, his wild and wooly 1971 shoot-'em-up that co-starred two of his kids. At a period when certain directors - ie: Robert Altman (1971's McCABE & MRS. MILLER) and Sam Peckinpah (1969's THE WILD BUNCH) - were giving a face lift to western cinema, BIG JAKE for the most part kept faith with the traditional horse opera... but with a nod or three towards the modernizing trend. I thought it an entertaining watch. But maybe I'm biased. I've mostly always thought of a John Wayne vehicle as an entertaining watch. The sole exception is THE CONQUEROR in which he achieved an epic level of suck playing Genghis Khan.On a day in 1909 the Texas sprawl of the McCandles clan is invaded by marauders, ten within the household shot down, and the youngest McCandles abducted and taken across the border into Mexico. A ransom demand is extended: a million dollars (in $20 bills, please). Martha McCandles (Maureen O'Hara), matriarch of the fam, deems her 8-year-old grandson's retrieval a task for an ""extremely harsh and unpleasant kind of man."" And so she sends word to her estranged, restless, ornery husband, Jacob (John Wayne). Big Jake and his fierce, faithful dog (whose name is ""Dog"") quickly make tracks for the old homestead but, before that, lavish time enough to rescue a Scottish sheepherder from a rough hanging.So much of BIG JAKE plays out as a standard John Wayne action western. The Duke stands tall and spits out manly phrases and coldcocks adversaries with his meat hook fists. And after four decades of working in the film industry, the Duke pulls off this larger-than-life role without breaking a sweat. The rough-n-tumble humor is present, as always. Part of the Duke's charm is that he thrives as the bewildered straight man and the blustery contrarian who absorbs jabs from foes, friends, and hostile family members. In this one, Big Jake is bedeviled by two of his sons who grew up in his absence. It's always amusing to eyeball Wayne's onscreen parenting methods. It makes for a bruising family bonding experience. Michael (Christopher Mitchum, son of Robert) is the more amenable offspring. The one who really puts Jake on blast is the seriously resentful James (Patrick Wayne). James from jump makes a mission of getting under his father's skin by mockingly calling him ""Daddy"" and questioning every decision Jake makes. There's extra spice in that John and Patrick are dad and son in real life. Ethan Wayne, the Duke's other real life son plays his character's kidnapped grandson. Here, the kid gets dressed up like a little Puritan boy. Thanks, dad.To acknowledge the shift in the wind, BIG JAKE does at times veer away from what's expected. There's the pseudo-documentary intro. As a nod towards the march of progress, Michael McCandles rides a motorcycle and a passage features a number of horseless carriages attempting to head off the kidnappers even as Big Jake on horseback trails behind on a more sedate pace. BIG JAKE features more squibs than usual and, in the climactic sequence, a machete wielding henchman who amps the violence, although much of what he does is offscreen. If there's a down note for me, it's that, ultimately, the film doesn't give enough weight to the dog and the Indian and their parts in the showdown. And maybe I'm guilty of the same thing. I didn't even mention the Indian until now.",4,"""You can call me Father, you can call me Jake.

269595,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,6301802330,JAG 2.0,"[0, 0]","Big Jake, an excellent John Wayne western movie - and produced by Wayne's own production company, Batjac - and has all the familiar elements we've come to expect from Wayne with a few wrinkles.The film begins during the turn of the 20th century at Jacob McCandles' ranch where a gang of kidnappers take the young grandson of ""Big Jake"" and demand the payment of one million dollars in return for the boy's life. The gang flees to Mexico with the young boy after ambushing the party of Texas Rangers that have gone after them. Jake, played by Wayne, is estranged from his family, living in the part of the west that is still wild when news comes of the kidnapping. His wife has summoned him for the purpose of taking the ransom to the kidnappers and bringing the boy back. As you can imagine, the kidnappers picked on the wrong man!The film brings together many of Wayne's costars from years past; Maureen O'Hara, Bruce Cabot, Harry Carey Jr. as well as Wayne's son Patrick and Christopher Mitchum, son of Robert Mitchum. The leader of the kidnappers is veteran actor Richard Boone. I thought the performances were excellent. There's still that on-screen chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara we see in the film's opening sequences.The film itself takes place during the period when the old ""Wild West"" is certainly dying, making way for progress and civilization. Yet, there is still enough wildness in the west to cause trouble. Mitchum, who plays a son of ""Jake"", employs modern weapons (an automatic pistol and scoped rifle) while Wayne and Cabot cling to the old ways. Automobiles are making inroads into the world still largely driven by horses.I thought the acting, score, cinematography, locations were all quite good. The script is solid, giving Wayne plenty of one-liners such as ""That'll be the day."" which Wayne growls each time someone tells him they thought he had already died. The direction by George Sherman is crisp and the film never seems to drag. The action sequences are very good for the time. Frankly, I prefer the staged violence of that era to the overly bloody special effects of today.This is a solid western that allows Wayne to be himself, the strong, tough man of action that always fights on the side of right.

It's probably one of John Wayne's most underappreciated films.  Not that it isn't popular, but critics don't put it in the same league as the John Ford or Howard Hawks classics.  Many elements of this movie stand out, though.  First, the cast is top-notch, and they make each character colorful and memorable.  Along with Wayne, you have Richard Boone, Maureen O'Hara, Bruce Cabot, Wayne's son Patrick, and Robert Mitchum's son Chris, among others.  It doesn't get much better than that.  Then you have the story of a kidnapped grandson, a hardened grandfather on the hunt with his estranged sons, and a proud and stubborn matriarch intent on getting justice.  And with Boone as the head villain opposing Wayne, I don't know what more you could want in a story.  Finally, you get some of Wayne's best lines ever, like the classic to his on- and off-screen son, Patrick, after throwing him down off of a horse and punching him in the face, ""You can call me Father, you can call me Jacob, you can call me Jake, you can call me a dirty son-of-a-bitch...but if you ever call me Daddy again, I'll finish this fight!""

269610,ABLOQZIL42W7I,6301802330,"kone ""kone""","[1, 2]","Big Jake came out in 1971.  John Wayne was 64 years old, and this is another role in which he, as the central character, is clearly aging, yet, still man enough to complete the task at hand. The plot centers around the kidnapping of Jake's grandson (Wayne's actual youngest son, Ethan Wayne, named after his character in The Searches, Ethan Edwards) by a gang of absolute evil cutthroats, led by the evilest of them all, artfully played by Richard Boone.  Jake is recruited by his estranged wife (Maureen O'Hara) to go and get his grandson back by paying the ransom demand.  Enlisting the help of his two sons, Patrick Wayne (his real son) and Chris Mitchum (son of Robert Mitchum), Big Jake sets off to turn the tables on the bad guys, repair damaged family relationships, and rescue his grandson.I found this movie had lots of initial potential, but falls far short of realizing this potential mostly due to poor casting, subplots that are inane at best, and a lack of gritty realism.  This film stretches the imagination in terms of believe-ability. First, the acting is downright suspect.  Chris Mitchum is absolutely flat and unappealing as Wayne's son, and the role of Indian Scout Sam Sharpnose, played by Bruce Cabot, is horribly miscast.  He is far too old and does not remotely resemble an Indian, but he was a friend of Wayne, so he got the part.  Patrick Wayne holds his own, but a scene where father and son trade punches to the jaw to see who is more macho is patently ridiculous and detracts from the main plot. I began to lose faith in the film at this point.  The final show-down is fairly exciting, but it comes it is too little, too late.  When I compare this movie to the classic ""The Searchers"", with its realistic fleshed-out characters and its brutal realism, Big Jake absolutely pales in comparison.  It is about half the film ""The Searchers"" is.  Wayne tries valiantly to save the film, and he is very good indeed, but even he cannot rescue the thin script and the poor supporting cast.I love John Wayne, but this not one of his best - it is average fare.kone",3,Big Jake Depicts Wayne as Aging Patriarch,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2084,"['Big', 'Jake', 'came', 'out', '1971', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', '64', 'years', 'old', 'role', 'central', 'character', 'clearly', 'aging', 'yet', 'still', 'man', 'enough', 'complete', 'task', 'hand', 'plot', 'centers', 'kidnapping', 'Jake', 'grandson', 'Wayne', 'actual', 'youngest', 'son', 'Ethan', 'Wayne', 'named', 'character', 'Searches', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'gang', 'absolute', 'evil', 'cutthroats', 'led', 'evilest', 'artfully', 'played', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Jake', 'recruited', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'go', 'get', 'grandson', 'back', 'paying', 'ransom', 'demand', 'Enlisting', 'help', 'two', 'sons', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'real', 'son', 'Chris', 'Mitchum', 'son', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Big', 'Jake', 'turn', 'tables', 'bad', 'guys', 'repair', 'damaged', 'family', 'relationships', 'rescue', 'grandson.I', 'found', 'movie', 'had', 'lots', 'initial', 'potential', 'far', 'short', 'realizing', 'potential', 'mostly', 'due', 'poor', 'casting', 'subplots', 'are', 'inane', 'best', 'lack', 'gritty', 'realism', 'film', 'imagination', 'terms', 'believe-ability', 'First', 'acting', 'downright', 'suspect', 'Chris', 'Mitchum', 'absolutely', 'flat', 'unappealing', 'Wayne', 'son', 'role', 'Indian', 'Scout', 'Sam', 'Sharpnose', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'not', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'Indian', 'was', 'friend', 'Wayne', 'got', 'part', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'own', 'scene', 'where', 'father', 'son', 'trade', 'punches', 'jaw', 'see', 'who', 'more', 'macho', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'detracts', 'main', 'plot', 'began', 'lose', 'faith', 'film', 'point', 'final', 'show-down', 'fairly', 'exciting', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'When', 'compare', 'movie', 'classic', 'Searchers', 'realistic', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'brutal', 'realism', 'Big', 'Jake', 'absolutely', 'comparison', 'film', 'Searchers', 'Wayne', 'valiantly', 'save', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'rescue', 'thin', 'script', 'poor', 'supporting', 'cast.I', 'love', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'average', 'fare.kone']",N/A

This film is directed by George Sherman, who first began doing Westerns back in the late 1930s, although Wayne is known to have directed some scenes as well.  In retrospect I would argue that this 1971 film is the first of a trio of film that Wayne made at the end of his career reflecting the passing of the Western.  The other two would be Wayne's next film, ""The Cowboys,"" and obviously his final film, ""The Shootist.""  Of that trio ""Big Jake"" is clearly the most fun and my biggest complaint about this film is that when it is shown on television they almost always have the first commercial break at the absolute worst moment.The film begins with a raid on the McCandles Ranch where Little Jake McCandles (Ethan Wayne, the Duke's youngest son, named for the character he played in ""The Searchers"") is kidnapped by a gang of cutthroats led by John Fain (Richard Boone).  Fain demands a ransom to be delivered across the border in Mexico.  The Texas Rangers are willing to do it, but Martha McCandles (Maureen O'Hara), the boy's grandmother, announces that this is a disagreeable task and needs to be done by a disagreeable man.  At this point we cut to an extreme close up of John Wayne peering down the barrel of a rifle.  It is a great introduction to Wayne's character in the film and a fitting counterpart to the moment in ""Stagecoach"" when we first see the Ringo Kid and his Winchester.  But television stations keep putting commercials before the cut because the film's opening sequence, in which narrator George Fenneman, who went from being Groucho Marx's announcer and straight man on ""You Bet Your Life"" to doing the narration for Jack Webb's ""Dragnet,"" introduces us to all of the members of the Fain gang runs on a bit before we have the raid and the decision of what to do next.  So Act I runs out for a bit and if there is a good reason to have this movie on DVD or VHS it is because that way you miss this horrendous commercial placement.""Big Jake"" is basically a chase story as the title character goes after his grandson, heading out with the ransom with only his trusted Native American friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot) and a dog named ""Dog.""  But there are several others things going on to make the proceedings more interesting.  Big Jake did not even know that he had a grandson, and while the boy's father Jeff (Bobby Vinton, the singer) is wounded, his two brothers James (Patrick Wayne, another of the Duke's son) and Michael (Christopher Mitchum, son of Robert Mitchum who co-starred with the Duke in ""El Dorado"").  Clearly Big Jake has been separated from his family for a while and there are issues, particularly with James, who makes the mistake of calling his father ""Daddy.""There is also a whole sub-text about relying on modern technology.  While Big Jake heads off with horses the Texas Rangers take off in new fangled motorcars.  Of course this is a mistake, but there is a recurring theme of the old ways being best.  Michael has a motorcycle and James has a new fangled pistol, but they are able to overcome their reliance on modern technology.  If the Old West is disappearing it is not disappearing until the Duke has his last fight.Then there is the running gag that everybody seems to think Big Jake is dead.  When we are treated to that great close up our hero is watching a group of cattlemen get ready to string up a sheep farmer.  Big Jake does not want to get involved, not wanting to make a mistake of his youth that almost cost him his life.  But then the leader of the lynch mob (Jim Davis) makes the mistake of kicking a boy (""Aw,"" says Big Jake, ""why'd he want to go and do that for?"").  There could be trouble but then it is discovered that the big man on the horse is Jacob McCandles, who apparently is not dead.  This happens so often that Big Jake swears he will kill the next man who says that and, of course, he does.Finally, this film has some great dialogue by Harry Julian Fink  and Rita M. Fink.  This was their first film together (he did ""Major Dundee"" and ""Ice Station Zebra"") and after this they created ""Dirty Harry"" for Clint Eastwood (no wonder the choice lines in this movie are so choice).  When James calls Big Jake ""Daddy,"" the Duke knocks his son on his can and announces: ""You can call Dad, you can call me Father, you can call me Jacob and you can call me Jake. You can call me a dirty old son-of-a-b***h, but if you EVER call me Daddy again, I'll finish this fight.""  But my favorite is when Fain first encounters Big Jake (not knowing who he is, of course) and gives a very serious warning.  At the climax of the film Big Jake repeats the warning word for word with a grim earnestness that is quite impressive.  That is why this is not a great film, but a great movie.",5,They made the mistake of kidnapping Big Jake's grandson,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,4851,"['Big', 'Jake', 'one', 'favorite', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'not', 'claim', 'classic', 'film', 'film', 'directed', 'George', 'Sherman', 'who', 'first', 'began', 'doing', 'Westerns', 'back', 'late', '1930s', 'Wayne', 'known', 'have', 'directed', 'scenes', 'well', 'retrospect', 'would', 'argue', '1971', 'film', 'first', 'trio', 'film', 'Wayne', 'made', 'end', 'career', 'reflecting', 'passing', 'Western', 'other', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'Wayne', 'next', 'film', 'Cowboys', 'obviously', 'final', 'film', 'Shootist', 'trio', 'Big', 'Jake', 'clearly', 'most', 'fun', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'when', 'shown', 'television', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'first', 'commercial', 'break', 'absolute', 'worst', 'moment.The', 'film', 'raid', 'McCandles', 'Ranch', 'where', 'Little', 'Jake', 'McCandles', 'Ethan', 'Wayne', 'Duke', 'youngest', 'son', 'named', 'character', 'played', 'Searchers', 'kidnapped', 'gang', 'cutthroats', 'led', 'John', 'Fain', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Fain', 'ransom', 'be', 'delivered', 'border', 'Mexico', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'Martha', 'McCandles', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'boy', 'grandmother', 'disagreeable', 'task', 'be', 'done', 'disagreeable', 'man', 'point', 'cut', 'extreme', 'close', 'John', 'Wayne', 'peering', 'down', 'barrel', 'rifle', 'great', 'introduction', 'Wayne', 'character', 'film', 'fitting', 'counterpart', 'moment', 'Stagecoach', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'Ringo', 'Kid', 'Winchester', 'television', 'stations', 'keep', 'putting', 'commercials', 'cut', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'narrator', 'George', 'Fenneman', 'who', 'went', 'being', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'announcer', 'straight', 'man', 'Bet', 'Life', 'doing', 'narration', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'Dragnet', 'members', 'Fain', 'gang', 'bit', 'have', 'raid', 'decision', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'So', 'Act', 'runs', 'out', 'bit', 'good', 'reason', 'have', 'movie', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'way', 'miss', 'horrendous', 'commercial', 'placement', 'Big', 'Jake', 'basically', 'chase', 'story', 'title', 'character', 'grandson', 'heading', 'out', 'ransom', 'only', 'trusted', 'Native', 'American', 'friend', 'Sam', 'Sharpnose', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'dog', 'named', 'Dog', 'are', 'several', 'others', 'things', 'going', 'make', 'proceedings', 'more', 'interesting', 'Big', 'Jake', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'had', 'grandson', 'boy', 'father', 'Jeff', 'Bobby', 'Vinton', 'singer', 'wounded', 'two', 'brothers', 'James', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Duke', 'son', 'Michael', 'Christopher', 'Mitchum', 'son', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'co-starred', 'Duke', 'El', 'Dorado', 'Clearly', 'Big', 'Jake', 'been', 'separated', 'family', 'while', 'are', 'issues', 'particularly', 'James', 'who', 'mistake', 'calling', 'father', 'Daddy', 'also', 'whole', 'sub-text', 'relying', 'modern', 'technology', 'Big', 'Jake', 'heads', 'off', 'horses', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'take', 'off', 'new', 'fangled', 'motorcars', 'course', 'mistake', 'recurring', 'theme', 'old', 'ways', 'being', 'best', 'Michael', 'motorcycle', 'James', 'new', 'fangled', 'pistol', 'are', 'able', 'overcome', 'reliance', 'modern', 'technology', 'Old', 'West', 'disappearing', 'not', 'disappearing', 'Duke', 'last', 'fight.Then', 'running', 'gag', 'everybody', 'think', 'Big', 'Jake', 'dead', 'When', 'are', 'treated', 'great', 'close', 'up', 'hero', 'watching', 'group', 'cattlemen', 'get', 'ready', 'string', 'up', 'sheep', 'farmer', 'Big', 'Jake', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'involved', 'not', 'wanting', 'make', 'mistake', 'youth', 'almost', 'cost', 'life', 'then', 'leader', 'lynch', 'mob', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'mistake', 'kicking', 'boy', 'Aw', 'Big', 'Jake', 'why', ""'d"", 'want', 'go', 'do', 'could', 'be', 'trouble', 'then', 'discovered', 'big', 'man', 'horse', 'Jacob', 'McCandles', 'who', 'apparently', 'not', 'dead', 'so', 'often', 'Big', 'Jake', 'will', 'kill', 'next', 'man', 'who', 'course', 'does.Finally', 'film', 'great', 'dialogue', 'Harry', 'Julian', 'Fink', 'Rita', 'M.', 'Fink', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'together', 'did', 'Major', 'Dundee', 'Ice', 'Station', 'Zebra', 'created', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'wonder', 'choice', 'lines', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'choice', 'When', 'James', 'Big', 'Jake', 'Daddy', 'Duke', 'son', 'can', 'announces', 'can', 'call', 'Dad', 'can', 'call', 'Father', 'can', 'call', 'Jacob', 'can', 'call', 'Jake', 'can', 'call', 'dirty', 'old', 'son-of-a-b***h', 'EVER', 'call', 'Daddy', 'again', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'fight', 'favorite', 'when', 'Fain', 'first', 'Big', 'Jake', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'course', 'very', 'serious', 'warning', 'climax', 'film', 'Big', 'Jake', 'warning', 'word', 'word', 'grim', 'earnestness', 'quite', 'impressive', 'why', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

269617,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6301802330,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This is an excellent western, one of the last John Wayne turned, as he would make only seven more films including five westerns before his death. I discovered it only recently and I liked it very much.Produced in 1971 ""Big Jake"" is a very interesting film, as it combines with considrable success two styles of turning westerns. A lot in this film remains faithful to the traditional westerns as they were turned between 1939 (""Stagecoach"" by John Ford) and 1965 (""The sons of Katie Elder"" by Henry Hathaway). But there are also elements which were clearly borrowed from the ""new western"" style (""Wild Bunch"" by Sam Peckinpah) and the ""spaghetti western"" (""The good, the bad and the ugly"" by Sergio Leone). Combined together in films like ""True Grit"" (1969), its sequel ""Rooster Cogburn"" (1974) and precisely ""Big Jake"" all those elements gave a quite pleasant mixture of good, strong dialogs, good dynamic action scenes, some pretty unusual elements (like the car and the motorcycle in ""Big Jake"" or Katherine Hepburn shooting the Gatling machine gun in ""Rooster Cogburn"") and a lot of (frequently dark) humor. Those films were also much more violent and also slightly more realistic than the traditional westerns.""Big Jake"" begins with the raid of a bunch of outlaws against the residence of a rich cattle barons family, the McCandle's clan, who own large land in Texas and New Mexico. The outlaws are commanded by a certain John Fain, a physically very powerful and particularly ferocious bandit, magistrally interpreted by Richard Boone. The wealthy family the bandits target is led by a formidable matriarch, Martha McCandle, played by Maureen O'Hara (who, although being 51 years old at that time was still hot like hell!). The raid against McCandle's mansion is a bloody and brutal business and at the end the bandits leave with a kidnapped child, Martha's grandson, Jacob ""Little Jake"" McCandle. To have him back the McCandle family will have to pay a one million dollars ransom, which must be delivered to a place beyond Mexican border...Even simply transporting such an incredible fortune through the border wildlands of Texas is a dangerous thing - and Martha McCandle has also intentions which differ slightly from the plan of the bandits. For those reasons she calls back home her estranged husband, Jacob ""Big Jake"" McCandle (John Wayne), the ""single harshest and most unpleasant man on Earth"", whom she kicked out years ago and refused even to acknowledge that he was still alive... He will have to take the ransom money to the bandits - and maybe do even more than that... On this quest ""Big Jake"" McCandle will have to take with him his two sons, James and Michael, played respectively by Patrick Wayne (son of John Wayne) and Christopher Mitchum (son of Robert Mitchum). He will also take with him a taciturn Indian tracker, Sam Sharpnose, played by Bruce Cabot (who in 1939 auditioned for the leading role in ""Stagecoach"" but lost to John Wayne...).The long trek is very well shown and it gave the director occasion to show difficult relations between ""Big Jake"" and his sons. There is quite a lot of humor in this film and dialogs are a pure delight! There are some action scenes during this time in the film, and they are all pretty well shown. Some of those scenes were clearly inspired by Sergio Leone's works...Ultimately, ""Big Jake's"" little band will have to deal with John Fain's larger group. For reasons which I will not explain here the transfer of ransom will be much, much more complicated than either of sides would believe...When the final credits rolled, I was very impressed. ""Big Jake"" is a very intelligent and well done film, with a solid scenario. A film to buy, watch and keep for the children, once they grow up.",5,"""The harshest and most unpleasant man on Earth must see to it - my husband...""",1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,3754,"['excellent', 'western', 'one', 'last', 'John', 'Wayne', 'turned', 'would', 'make', 'only', 'seven', 'more', 'films', 'including', 'five', 'westerns', 'death', 'discovered', 'only', 'recently', 'liked', 'very', 'much.Produced', '1971', 'Big', 'Jake', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'considrable', 'success', 'two', 'styles', 'turning', 'westerns', 'lot', 'film', 'faithful', 'traditional', 'westerns', 'were', 'turned', '1939', 'Stagecoach', 'John', 'Ford', '1965', 'sons', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'are', 'also', 'elements', 'were', 'clearly', 'borrowed', 'new', 'western', 'style', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Combined', 'together', 'films', 'True', 'Grit', '1969', 'sequel', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', '1974', 'precisely', 'Big', 'Jake', 'elements', 'gave', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'mixture', 'good', 'strong', 'dialogs', 'good', 'dynamic', 'action', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'unusual', 'elements', 'car', 'motorcycle', 'Big', 'Jake', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'shooting', 'Gatling', 'machine', 'gun', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'lot', 'frequently', 'dark', 'humor', 'films', 'were', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'also', 'slightly', 'more', 'realistic', 'traditional', 'westerns', 'Big', 'Jake', 'raid', 'bunch', 'outlaws', 'residence', 'rich', 'cattle', 'barons', 'family', 'McCandle', 'clan', 'who', 'own', 'large', 'land', 'Texas', 'New', 'Mexico', 'outlaws', 'are', 'commanded', 'certain', 'John', 'Fain', 'physically', 'very', 'powerful', 'particularly', 'ferocious', 'bandit', 'magistrally', 'interpreted', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'wealthy', 'family', 'bandits', 'target', 'led', 'formidable', 'matriarch', 'Martha', 'McCandle', 'played', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'being', '51', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'hot', 'hell', 'raid', 'McCandle', 'mansion', 'bloody', 'brutal', 'business', 'end', 'bandits', 'leave', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'Martha', 'grandson', 'Jacob', 'Little', 'Jake', 'McCandle', 'have', 'back', 'McCandle', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'ransom', 'must', 'be', 'delivered', 'place', 'Mexican', 'border', 'Even', 'simply', 'transporting', 'such', 'incredible', 'fortune', 'border', 'wildlands', 'Texas', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'Martha', 'McCandle', 'also', 'intentions', 'differ', 'slightly', 'plan', 'bandits', 'reasons', 'back', 'home', 'estranged', 'husband', 'Jacob', 'Big', 'Jake', 'McCandle', 'John', 'Wayne', 'single', 'harshest', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'man', 'Earth', 'whom', 'kicked', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'refused', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'ransom', 'money', 'bandits', 'maybe', 'do', 'even', 'more', 'quest', 'Big', 'Jake', 'McCandle', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'two', 'sons', 'James', 'Michael', 'played', 'respectively', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'son', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Christopher', 'Mitchum', 'son', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'will', 'also', 'take', 'taciturn', 'Indian', 'tracker', 'Sam', 'Sharpnose', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'who', '1939', 'auditioned', 'leading', 'role', 'Stagecoach', 'lost', 'John', 'Wayne', '.The', 'long', 'trek', 'very', 'well', 'shown', 'gave', 'director', 'occasion', 'show', 'difficult', 'relations', 'Big', 'Jake', 'sons', 'quite', 'lot', 'humor', 'film', 'dialogs', 'are', 'pure', 'delight', 'are', 'action', 'scenes', 'time', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'shown', 'scenes', 'were', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'works', 'Ultimately', 'Big', 'Jake', 'little', 'band', 'will', 'have', 'deal', 'John', 'Fain', 'larger', 'group', 'reasons', 'will', 'not', 'explain', 'here', 'transfer', 'ransom', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'sides', 'would', 'believe', 'When', 'final', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Big', 'Jake', 'very', 'intelligent', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'solid', 'scenario', 'film', 'buy', 'watch', 'keep', 'children', 'once', 'grow', 'up']",N/A

269620,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,6301802330,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","John Wayne remains the most famous icon of the west that has ever existed when it comes to film. His swagger and speech patterns have been copied by many a mimic and fellow actor and his collection of classic western roles has never been matched. During his final years Wayne continued to make westerns and the most amazing thing was that even at 64 years of age he made some that were highly entertaining such as BIG JAKE.Wayne stars as Big Jake McCandles, a man who does things his own way and who tamed the country that he lived in. When McCandles grandson is kidnapped by a group of mangy looking cutthroats led by John Fain (Richard Boone), McCandles wife Martha (Maureen O'Hara) sends for him. While still married, the two have separate lives due to the fact they both have head strong ways.A demand of $1 million is made and Jake is set to take the money in trade for his grandson, a child he's never laid eyes on. But this is a changing west and the sheriff and his men set out to catch them first in the newfangled cars that are the rage. Unfortunately the cars also can be easily dispensed with after being shot which happens in an ambush. Waylaid and with no way to get help, Jake leaves them water and tells them to head back while he continues on with his task.Accompanying Jake are his old Indiana friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot) and two of his sons James (Wayne's real life son Patrick) and Michael (Christopher Mitchum, son of Robert Mitchum). While Michael offers his father the respect he is due, James has a problem with him witnessed when Jake first got off of the train when he arrived home. As the story progresses, James learns to have more respect for his father.The foursome travel down the dusty trail, following the map left them by the kidnappers. One night after setting up camp, Fain rides in to make sure that they are following the instructions given and to provide them with new. As the two men eye each other down you know a final confrontation will eventually happen.The foursome head to a small town in Mexico where the kidnappers feel safe. But word of their cargo has preceded them and another group stands ready to take the money from them. Needless to say things don't go according to their plans.With this new trouble out of the way Wayne sets out to follow the final instructions. That showdown between the bad guys and the good guys is all set in motion and all we have to do now is wait to see just who will and who won't survive.What seems to be a simple story of a kidnapping has more layers to it than one would expect in a John Wayne film. Not only does it tell that story but it shows a world that is changing, much like Wayne's was at the time. The old law of the west was being replaced by real laws and horses were being replaced by machines. But men like McCandle still rode tall in the saddle and made sure that things were done proper.The movie also shows a character in McCandles that did what he had to do to survive but at the same time realizes what he missed in the process. A grandchild he never saw and sons he never had the chance to be a father for. But there is always time to repair broken walls and to be there for family.The blu-ray transfer of this film is beautiful, offering some tremendous scenery and some well styled photography. It might appear to be nothing more than what was done for most TV westerns of the time but it gives the viewer the chance to witness all the action that the screen can hold and more.As I've said before, it's great that these classic John Wayne films are being released in this format. One can only hope that they continue to do so. My guess is that event he black and white films would feel much improved with this format. Now all we can do is sit and wait.

This movie shows an older John Wayne with weaknesses such as needing glasses to read.  The best part of the movie, for me, is that John Wayne's character has been separated from his wife and family for nearly 10 years and has not been in anyone's eye.  This is the basis for the line the character is faced with throughout the movie, ""I thought you were dead."" Richard Boone's acting is superb and, at times, John Wayne's acting is especially good.  However there is so much hokey in this movie, that it is laughable.  There are also a great many mistakes and it is fun to watch for them.  One that I haven't heard mentioned is when John Wayne is browbeating the head of the Texas Rangers, and the head of Texas Rangers admits to having no water.  However, the three cards are shown on the road in a prior scene with a water bag on each side of the front bumper.This movie is a fantasy and to enjoy it, we must suspend disbelief.  If you have the right attitude, this is really a fun movie to watch.  If you must have a good plot, good acting, and good film cutting, this really isn't a movie for you.

He has occasionally depicted hard-bitten nobility, as his portrayal of General Sam Houston in ""The Alamo"" or the ageing cavalry officer in ""A Thunder of Drums""--but more often his grim, craggy features have led him to villainy...He was Randolph Scott's intelligent, embittered adversary, smooth as a rattlesnake and twice as treacherous, in the Tall T; he wrapped non-conforming farmers in barbed wire in Man Without a Star; as mean, sadistic Major Salinas, he persecuted Rory Calhoun in Way of a Gaucho; and he gave Paul Newman a rough ride in Hombre. In ""Big Jake,"" he was--as always--a powerful presence and one of the screen's most efficient scene-stealer...George Sherman's ""Big Jake"" was the Duke fifth and final film played opposite the lovely redheaded Maureen O'Hara who plays, here, his wife Martha McCandles...The movie opens in 1909 where nine men crossing the Rio Bravo into Texas... Their leader--a sadistic gunrunner--John Fain (Richard Boone) is ready for his bloody McCandles' raid where ten people were slaughtered and Big Jakes's grandson, the 8-year-old Little Jacob (Ethan Wayne) is kidnapped, and a ransom note is left demanding one million dollars in $20 Bills for Jacob's safe return...Martha--quite sure that this job requires an extremely harsh and special kind of man to attend it-- called back her husband, absent for many years, to pay the ransom, and take back home the little boy alive...Jacob McCandles (Wayne)--who has never seen his grandson--responds to his wife's call and organizes a hunting party to track down the dangerous and violent men...With his two sons, his faithful Indian scout (Bruce Cabot), his loyal dog, and with a large red strongbox packed to the back of a good mule, McCandles initiates his very daring hunt...There are some hard feelings among Wayne's resentful boys, and as the film progresses, Wayne's blue eyes were gentle and revealing a wonderful caring father but also his eyes turn to blue steel as he took that decision to get alive his grandson... The heart of the film is Wayne interacting with his wife and what he has in store for his sons next...Patrick Wayne plays Wayne's older son who is short on ears and long on mouth... Christopher Mitchum rides a 'crazy bicycle,' carries a Bergman 1911, and a rifle with one fancy new telescope...With great action scenes, great photography and with a terrific Elmer Bernstein musical score, ""Big Jake"" is one of Wayne best Westerns...",3,"""No matter what else happens, no matter who gets killed I'm gonna blow your head off.""",1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,2526,"['been', 'tougher', 'more', 'formidable', 'Western', 'heavy', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'occasionally', 'depicted', 'hard-bitten', 'nobility', 'portrayal', 'General', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'Alamo', 'ageing', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'A', 'Thunder', 'Drums', 'more', 'often', 'grim', 'craggy', 'features', 'have', 'led', 'villainy', 'was', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'intelligent', 'embittered', 'adversary', 'smooth', 'rattlesnake', 'twice', 'as', 'treacherous', 'Tall', 'T', 'wrapped', 'non-conforming', 'farmers', 'barbed', 'wire', 'Man', 'Star', 'mean', 'sadistic', 'Major', 'Salinas', 'persecuted', 'Rory', 'Calhoun', 'Way', 'Gaucho', 'gave', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'rough', 'ride', 'Hombre', 'Big', 'Jake', 'was', 'always', 'powerful', 'presence', 'one', 'screen', 'most', 'efficient', 'scene-stealer', 'George', 'Sherman', 'Big', 'Jake', 'was', 'Duke', 'fifth', 'final', 'film', 'played', 'opposite', 'lovely', 'redheaded', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'who', 'here', 'wife', 'Martha', 'McCandles', 'movie', '1909', 'where', 'nine', 'men', 'crossing', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'Texas', 'leader', 'sadistic', 'gunrunner', 'John', 'Fain', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'ready', 'bloody', 'McCandles', 'raid', 'where', 'ten', 'people', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'Big', 'Jakes', 'grandson', '8-year-old', 'Little', 'Jacob', 'Ethan', 'Wayne', 'kidnapped', 'ransom', 'note', 'left', 'demanding', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', '20', 'Bills', 'Jacob', 'safe', 'return', 'Martha', 'quite', 'sure', 'job', 'extremely', 'harsh', 'special', 'kind', 'man', 'attend', 'called', 'back', 'husband', 'absent', 'many', 'years', 'pay', 'ransom', 'take', 'back', 'home', 'little', 'boy', 'alive', 'Jacob', 'McCandles', 'Wayne', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'grandson', 'wife', 'call', 'hunting', 'party', 'track', 'down', 'dangerous', 'violent', 'men', 'two', 'sons', 'faithful', 'Indian', 'scout', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'loyal', 'dog', 'large', 'red', 'strongbox', 'packed', 'back', 'good', 'mule', 'McCandles', 'very', 'daring', 'hunt', 'are', 'hard', 'feelings', 'Wayne', 'resentful', 'boys', 'film', 'Wayne', 'blue', 'eyes', 'were', 'gentle', 'revealing', 'wonderful', 'caring', 'father', 'also', 'eyes', 'turn', 'blue', 'steel', 'took', 'decision', 'get', 'alive', 'grandson', 'heart', 'film', 'Wayne', 'interacting', 'wife', 'what', 'store', 'sons', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Wayne', 'older', 'son', 'who', 'short', 'ears', 'long', 'mouth', 'Christopher', 'Mitchum', ""'crazy"", 'bicycle', 'Bergman', '1911', 'rifle', 'one', 'fancy', 'new', 'telescope', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'great', 'photography', 'terrific', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'musical', 'score', 'Big', 'Jake', 'one', 'Wayne', 'best', 'Westerns']",N/A

However, ""Big Jake"" doesn't plan on letting these no-goods get away lightly.  He teams up with his sons James and Michael (played by Patrick Wayne and Chris Mitchum, respectively) and an old Indian friend named Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot) to distribute some rugged Western justice.  It has been many years since Jake has even seen his family; he doesn't even know about his grandson until his estranged wife (Maureen O'Hara) sends for him.  A man also out of his time, Jake is surprised with inventions such as the motor-car that has made horse-riding obsolete, and the automatic pistol Michael carries for protection.  Although it is 1909, he still prefers to use a horse and six-shooter, just like the old days. Whether they use ""advanced"" technology or not, Jake and his pals have a lot of trouble on their hands as they try to catch up with the men who have his grandson while fighting off local robbers who know about the alleged 1,000,000 dollars Jake possesses for his grandson's ransom.The action scenes are surprising violent (compared to some of Wayne's older films), but they're not extreme to the point of earning ""Big Jake"" an R-rating.  The dialogue, especially between Jake and his sons, is enjoyable and simple.  A cast of familiar Western actors only adds to the fun, as familiar faces appear throughout the film.

The story is about Jacob McCandles who is tracking down the gang who kidnapped his grandson in a bloody raid.  Joining him are his two sons and an old friend, Sam Sharpnose.  This is a quick-paced movie with good characters and snappy if cliched dialogue.  Obviously, this might not be the deepest plot, but it is still fun to watch.In a late role for him, John Wayne plays McCandles, an aging gunman refusing to admit that times are changing.  Richard Boone plays John Faine, the leader of the gang who kidnaps the Duke's grandson and actual son, Ethan Wayne.  Maureen O'Hara is very good in a early appearance, but she disappears too quickly.  Also notable are Patrick Wayne, Bruce Cabot, Christopher Mithchum, John Agar and many other recognizable faces from other Duke classics.  The widescreen presentation is great with an excellent soundtrack by Elmer Bernstein.  Otherwise, no other extras are offered.  A great John Wayne movie that will keep western fans pleased all around.",5,I thought you were dead; Not hardly,1052438400,"05 9, 2003",2003,1090,"['Big', 'Jake', 'one', 'great', 'westerns', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'story', 'Jacob', 'McCandles', 'who', 'tracking', 'down', 'gang', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'grandson', 'bloody', 'raid', 'Joining', 'are', 'two', 'sons', 'old', 'friend', 'Sam', 'Sharpnose', 'quick-paced', 'movie', 'good', 'characters', 'snappy', 'cliched', 'dialogue', 'Obviously', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'deepest', 'plot', 'still', 'fun', 'watch.In', 'late', 'role', 'John', 'Wayne', 'McCandles', 'aging', 'gunman', 'refusing', 'admit', 'times', 'are', 'changing', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'John', 'Faine', 'leader', 'gang', 'who', 'Duke', 'grandson', 'actual', 'son', 'Ethan', 'Wayne', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'very', 'good', 'early', 'appearance', 'too', 'quickly', 'Also', 'notable', 'are', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'Christopher', 'Mithchum', 'John', 'Agar', 'many', 'other', 'recognizable', 'other', 'Duke', 'classics', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'great', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'Otherwise', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'offered', 'great', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'western', 'fans', 'pleased']",N/A

269657,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6301802330,trebe,"[2, 2]","The western Big Jake (1971) is quest and revenge tale, featuring superstar John Wayne, as a tough, no-nonsense cowboy, looking to recover his kidnapped grandson.  This role is very familiar for the iconic Wayne, with some similarities to films like The Searchers (1956), and True Grit (1969).Wayne plays the abrasive and larger than life Jacob McCandles, a man used to having things done his way, who is surprised when his estranged wife Martha (Maureen O'Hara), informs him that a grandson he never knew existed, has been kidnapped.  A band of raiders led by John Fain (Richard Boone), attacked the McCandles' ranch, gunned down some of the staff, and grabbed the boy.Carrying a large wooden chest with the ransom, Big Jake heads out with his dog named Dog, and his native American friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot).  Martha hires a group of Texas Rangers, who travel via automobile, to also track down Fain's gang.  The scene of cowboys motoring across the desert in cars, at a time when few roads existed, is quite remarkable.  The convoy is ambushed by Fain, and easily put out of commission.  McCandle's estranged sons James (Patrick Wayne, John Wayne's son) and Michael (Christopher Mitchum), who had been travelling with the Rangers, reluctantly team up with their father.  There is plenty of melodramatic friction between Jake and his sons, particularly a surly James, who resents his father for abandoning the family.  An unsentimental Jake, just bulls his way along, slapping his sons in line.The reunited McCandles continue the quest which eventually leads them into Mexico.  Along the way, there is a tense meeting between the group and Fain, who drops by at night for a chat.  Richard Boone (TV's Paladin), is also an old hand at playing a cowboy, and as Fain, he is convincingly menacing.  The group practically invites trouble, when they stop in a Mexican town.  They have to fend off a band of thieves, blasting them to bits.  Fortunately law enforcement is non-existent, and the group heads off into the night, for a rendezvous in the desert with Fain.The final confrontation doesn't play very smoothly, and is a bit cartoonish.  Big Jake is wounded early, and spends most of the time taking cover behind a pile of hay, providing some screen time for grandson Jake (Wayne's son Ethan).  Big Jake is unable to help his buddy Sam, or loyal friend Dog, whose sacrifices are largely ignored.  The finale scene features McCandle and Fain, who are both wounded, covering some an amazing distance, in an unbelievable period of time, in order to face each other for the last time.Although the stakes are serious, the tone often much lighter.  Realism isn't a major factor in Big Jake, as the movie is mostly a showcase for Wayne, and an opportunity for him to work with his sons Patrick and Ethan.  This is also the fifth and last time, Wayne and Maureen O'Hara would appear in a film together.  The final film in the career of veteran director George Sherman, delivers enough action to satisfy most fans of the Duke.",3,fans of the Duke will love this...,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,3027,"['western', 'Big', 'Jake', '1971', 'quest', 'revenge', 'tale', 'featuring', 'superstar', 'John', 'Wayne', 'tough', 'no-nonsense', 'cowboy', 'looking', 'recover', 'kidnapped', 'grandson', 'role', 'very', 'familiar', 'iconic', 'Wayne', 'similarities', 'films', 'Searchers', '1956', 'True', 'Grit', '1969', '.Wayne', 'abrasive', 'larger', 'life', 'Jacob', 'McCandles', 'man', 'used', 'having', 'things', 'done', 'way', 'who', 'surprised', 'when', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Martha', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'grandson', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'band', 'raiders', 'led', 'John', 'Fain', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'attacked', 'McCandles', 'ranch', 'gunned', 'down', 'staff', 'grabbed', 'boy.Carrying', 'large', 'wooden', 'chest', 'ransom', 'Big', 'Jake', 'heads', 'out', 'dog', 'named', 'Dog', 'native', 'American', 'friend', 'Sam', 'Sharpnose', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'Martha', 'group', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'who', 'travel', 'automobile', 'also', 'track', 'down', 'Fain', 'gang', 'scene', 'cowboys', 'motoring', 'desert', 'cars', 'time', 'when', 'few', 'roads', 'existed', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'convoy', 'ambushed', 'Fain', 'easily', 'put', 'commission', 'McCandle', 'estranged', 'sons', 'James', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Wayne', 'son', 'Michael', 'Christopher', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'travelling', 'Rangers', 'reluctantly', 'up', 'father', 'plenty', 'melodramatic', 'friction', 'Jake', 'sons', 'particularly', 'surly', 'James', 'who', 'father', 'abandoning', 'family', 'unsentimental', 'Jake', 'just', 'bulls', 'way', 'slapping', 'sons', 'line.The', 'reunited', 'McCandles', 'continue', 'quest', 'eventually', 'Mexico', 'way', 'tense', 'meeting', 'group', 'Fain', 'who', 'night', 'chat', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'TV', 'Paladin', 'also', 'old', 'hand', 'playing', 'cowboy', 'Fain', 'convincingly', 'menacing', 'group', 'practically', 'trouble', 'when', 'stop', 'Mexican', 'town', 'have', 'fend', 'off', 'band', 'thieves', 'blasting', 'bits', 'Fortunately', 'law', 'enforcement', 'non-existent', 'group', 'night', 'rendezvous', 'desert', 'Fain.The', 'final', 'confrontation', ""n't"", 'play', 'very', 'smoothly', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'Big', 'Jake', 'wounded', 'early', 'most', 'time', 'taking', 'cover', 'pile', 'hay', 'providing', 'screen', 'time', 'grandson', 'Jake', 'Wayne', 'son', 'Ethan', 'Big', 'Jake', 'unable', 'help', 'buddy', 'Sam', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Dog', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'largely', 'ignored', 'finale', 'scene', 'features', 'McCandle', 'Fain', 'who', 'are', 'wounded', 'covering', 'amazing', 'distance', 'unbelievable', 'period', 'time', 'order', 'face', 'other', 'last', 'stakes', 'are', 'serious', 'tone', 'often', 'much', 'lighter', 'Realism', ""n't"", 'major', 'factor', 'Big', 'Jake', 'movie', 'mostly', 'showcase', 'Wayne', 'opportunity', 'work', 'sons', 'Patrick', 'Ethan', 'also', 'fifth', 'last', 'time', 'Wayne', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'would', 'appear', 'film', 'together', 'final', 'film', 'career', 'veteran', 'director', 'George', 'Sherman', 'delivers', 'enough', 'action', 'satisfy', 'most', 'fans', 'Duke']",N/A
