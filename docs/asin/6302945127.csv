346853,AKUGGJWVJ8QMQ,6302945127,"Edward C. Patterson ""Edward C. Patterson""","[13, 13]","From the first opening Clemensian Voice Over and the whimsical fight scene, Huck Finn brims with authenticity and focus. Sure, we've read the book and seen the many movie versions. But this one stands tall and comes to grips with Twain's not-so-juvenile hero as he grows along the river of life. Great allegory sublimates its symbols, so you take it like heroin, directly in the vein. And so it is with this film with a strong crop of performances and a sterling rendition by its star, Elijah Wood.The spirit of any great literary masterpiece translated to film is not the details a la BBC and Masterpiece Theater, but the distillation of ideas and moods into enduring messages and iconic scenes. Huck Finn is Elijah Wood's first foray into the literary character venue, a venue that would eventually lead him to Frodo Baggins. He does not approach the role as ""the lost child on the river,"" but as a growing cock-sure adolescent, more adult and intelligent for his age and station. His performance is rock solid, never flagging. He provides a variety of moods and is always maintaining a consistent arc with the material. No empty headed river rat here.Courtney Vance teams with Wood to make a most Twainly Jim. Jim is not the typical slave-he's literary and allegorical. His pain is real, but never obfuscating the themes of the novel; and so it blossoms in the film. Jason Robards Jr and Robbie Coltrane impress as the infamous scoundrels that represent American hypocrisy, while Ron Perlman charges the role as Papp Finn with rugged villainy emblazoned on the ass of white river trash. Anne Heche subtly wisps through as Mary Jane Wilks. But it is Elijah Wood that naturally carries the film. Twain would have been proud to see his creation in the hands of this veteran actor.Huck Finn keeps us laughing, almost weeping and gets us to think about the same things the original work got America to think about-so, much so as to get the book banned throughout the South. People ""be a-feared `bout der truth!"" But still, the truth is delivered through the antics and wisdom of a babe who finds his own faults forgiving and the world's most tolerable if taken with a ""stretcher"" or two. To this reviewer, Elijah Wood's portrayal of Huck Finn is definitive and this version of the novel, then in its centenary, is destined to become a classic.

346858,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6302945127,Monty Moonlight,"[32, 38]","Elijah Wood plays Huckleberry Finn, a young boy growing up in the pre-Civil War South. Huck's father is a drunken troublemaker, and is rarely around. The boy has been taken in by two kindly old women who are trying their best to civilize him, but aren't having an easy time of it. Huck lives for freedom and adventure, and the river is constantly calling his name. His best friend is a slave named Jim (Courtney B. Vance), and the two look out for each other, more-so with every passing day. When Huck's father Pap returns for the boy one night, having heard that he's inherited a nice some of money (for those days), the boy is desperate to escape. Trapped and left alone the next day in his father's run-down cabin, Huck escapes and fakes his own ""murder."" He takes a boat to Jackson's Island, where no one lives and hardly anyone visits, and there he runs into his old friend Jim! The two best friends go swimming, fishing, and have a generally great time, when Jim tells Huck that he's run away and is planning to head down river and then up to the free states. After a personal struggle with the idea of playing abolitionist, a dangerous thing to do, Huck agrees to help his friend escape slavery. The two soon find themselves heading down the river, but at a faster pace than they had expected. They have discovered that Jim is wanted not only for being a runaway, but also for being Huck's ""murderer."" Huck and Jim have several interesting experiences throughout their journey, including getting mixed up in a tragic family feud, nearly getting caught several times, and teaming up with a pair of con artists known as the King and the Duke (played wonderfully by Jason Robards and Robbie Coltrane). It's here where they meet three lovely sisters (Anne Heche, Laura Bundy, and a young, and very cute Renee O'Connor) and decide to help the girls at their own risk, rather than go on with the cruel scam they were being forced to act out by the two conmen.I'm soooo happy this wonderful film has come to DVD. This is a perfect film in so many respects. The casting is perfect, the camera work is gorgeous, and the spirit of adventure, friendship, drama, and fun is portrayed perfectly in every scene. True, this is not very similar to the book, Tom Sawyer isn't even mentioned. For a perfect interpretation of the book in the form of a wonderful film you need to get the version starring Patrick Day, which is only on VHS right now as far as I know. You'll want to get the 2 tape version if you can find it, rather than the edited 1 tape version. But while I love the Patrick Day version, this one is by far my favorite. It captures everything I feel a Huck film should, in a shorter, more exciting and to the point story than the book tells. True, it's been Disney-fied, but being a Disney fanatic, I don't mind at all. My feeling is they usually improve the stories they take on. This film is loaded with adventure and friendship, which is the main reason I'm such a Tom and Huck fan, and Elijah Wood really shines in the starring role. His chemistry with Courtney B. Vance is perfect! I had nearly worn my VHS out by the time this film came to DVD. The extras are nice, but there aren't THAT many. It could have delivered more in that department. But remember that this is a Disney DVD, and one they seem to have given low priority, so I'm just glad it's been released on DVD and has any extras at all. My favorite film of all time, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, was given zero extras, and Hocus Pocus, another fave, also had none if I recall correctly. Anyway, I definitely recommend this film for families, Tom and Huck fans, and just pretty much everybody! It's a perfect movie for a rainy Saturday night, baking something sweet and cuddling with someone special.",5,One of the Greatest movies ever made!!!,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,3768,"['Elijah', 'Wood', 'Huckleberry', 'Finn', 'young', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'pre-Civil', 'War', 'South', 'Huck', 'father', 'drunken', 'troublemaker', 'rarely', 'around', 'boy', 'been', 'taken', 'two', 'kindly', 'old', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'best', 'civilize', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', 'easy', 'time', 'Huck', 'freedom', 'adventure', 'river', 'constantly', 'calling', 'name', 'best', 'friend', 'slave', 'named', 'Jim', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'two', 'look', 'other', 'more-so', 'passing', 'day', 'When', 'Huck', 'father', 'Pap', 'boy', 'one', 'night', 'having', 'heard', 'inherited', 'nice', 'money', 'days', 'boy', 'desperate', 'escape', 'Trapped', 'left', 'alone', 'next', 'day', 'father', 'run-down', 'cabin', 'Huck', 'fakes', 'own', 'murder', 'boat', 'Jackson', 'Island', 'where', 'one', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'visits', 'there', 'old', 'friend', 'Jim', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'go', 'swimming', 'fishing', 'have', 'generally', 'great', 'time', 'when', 'Jim', 'Huck', 'run', 'away', 'planning', 'head', 'down', 'river', 'then', 'up', 'free', 'states', 'personal', 'struggle', 'idea', 'playing', 'abolitionist', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'do', 'Huck', 'help', 'friend', 'escape', 'slavery', 'two', 'soon', 'find', 'heading', 'down', 'river', 'faster', 'pace', 'had', 'expected', 'have', 'discovered', 'Jim', 'wanted', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'runaway', 'also', 'being', 'Huck', 'murderer', 'Huck', 'Jim', 'have', 'several', 'interesting', 'experiences', 'journey', 'including', 'getting', 'mixed', 'up', 'tragic', 'family', 'feud', 'nearly', 'getting', 'caught', 'several', 'times', 'teaming', 'up', 'pair', 'con', 'artists', 'known', 'King', 'Duke', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'here', 'where', 'meet', 'three', 'lovely', 'sisters', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Laura', 'Bundy', 'young', 'very', 'cute', 'Renee', ""O'Connor"", 'decide', 'help', 'girls', 'own', 'risk', 'rather', 'go', 'cruel', 'scam', 'were', 'being', 'forced', 'act', 'out', 'two', 'conmen.I', ""'m"", 'soooo', 'happy', 'wonderful', 'film', 'come', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'respects', 'casting', 'perfect', 'camera', 'work', 'gorgeous', 'spirit', 'adventure', 'friendship', 'drama', 'fun', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'scene', 'True', 'not', 'very', 'similar', 'book', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'perfect', 'interpretation', 'book', 'form', 'wonderful', 'film', 'need', 'get', 'version', 'starring', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'only', 'VHS', 'right', 'now', 'as', 'far', 'know', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', '2', 'tape', 'version', 'can', 'find', 'rather', 'edited', '1', 'tape', 'version', 'love', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'version', 'one', 'far', 'favorite', 'everything', 'feel', 'Huck', 'film', 'should', 'shorter', 'more', 'exciting', 'point', 'story', 'book', 'True', 'been', 'Disney-fied', 'being', 'Disney', 'fanatic', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'feeling', 'usually', 'improve', 'stories', 'take', 'film', 'loaded', 'adventure', 'friendship', 'main', 'reason', ""'m"", 'such', 'Tom', 'Huck', 'fan', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'really', 'starring', 'role', 'chemistry', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'perfect', 'had', 'nearly', 'worn', 'VHS', 'out', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'are', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'many', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'more', 'department', 'remember', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'one', 'seem', 'have', 'given', 'low', 'priority', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'extras', 'favorite', 'film', 'time', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'was', 'given', 'zero', 'extras', 'Hocus', 'Pocus', 'fave', 'also', 'had', 'none', 'recall', 'correctly', 'Anyway', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'families', 'Tom', 'Huck', 'fans', 'just', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'perfect', 'movie', 'rainy', 'Saturday', 'night', 'baking', 'something', 'sweet', 'cuddling', 'someone', 'special']",N/A

That is why this movie is so poignant-it teaches many lessons along the way, while not being so sweetly sugarcoated. We see African-Americans being beaten. We see our mischievous main character, Huck, being abused by his alcoholic father. We see thieves lying to gain a family fortune. But yet, we seem to laugh and cry throughout Huck's many adventures.Huck was way ahead of his time for a young kid. He is a great liar, and very cunning. He evens goes so far to fake his death so that he can run away from his foster parents and abusive father. He coincidentally meets up with Jim, a friend of his whom happens to be a slave.

346864,A1GIIPXONCEEHP,6302945127,Steve Vrana,"[0, 0]","I teach ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" to high school sophomores and have always included watching the film as well. For years I used the 1985 PBS adaptation (best known as the last film silent film star Lillian Gish appeared in). However, the PBS film ran nearly four hours and while it was fairly thorough, it simply was too plodding in its pace at times.This 1992 Disney film solves that problem. The story moves along quickly and it certainly holds my students' attention. It is not, however, without its flaws:X While the intent of the novel is maintained, there are a lot of scenes that have been cut. There is no mention of Tom Sawyer. And the entire ""Phelps"" episode is gone.X The Colonel Sherburn/Boggs episode is missing. I understand that it was easy to eliminate because it did not directly advance the story line, but it is one of my favorite scenes of the novel.X Two scenes that deepen Huck's relationship with Jim and help Huck see Jim as a person and not merely a slave are missing from the film. The first is where Huck fools Jim into thinking they were never separated in the fog, and the other is the heart-breaking story Jim tells of the time he slapped his daughter for not minding him only to find out later that she was deaf.X In addition, when I first saw this film, I thought Elija Wood played Huck a bit too smart-alecky. After twenty years, I've come to appreciate his portrayal. Although I should point out that Twain's manuscript notes indicate that Huck is fourteen, and Woods was ten when this was filmed.On the plus side, while the novel never has Jim discuss slavery, it becomes a talking point in the film.As to the bonus material:  The featurette ""Huck Finn: An American Classic"" is nothing special and runs less than five minutes. Likewise, the original trailer is of little interest. [Although it does include a clip of a scene that was cut from the final release.] And the audio commentary with the director and film editor is of marginal interest. Although they do mention a scene in the cave at the beginning of the film that was cut. (And the cave cost $23,000 to construct.) I would have been more interested in seeing that and any other deleted scenes.Overall, this film has much to recommend it. And as a companion to the novel, I will continue to show it in the classroom until the definitive edition is filmed.
