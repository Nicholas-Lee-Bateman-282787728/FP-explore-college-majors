Filled with passion, innocence, yet shrouded in mystery, 'Hugo' works well by its own merits, but, having seen it in 3-D, it can't be said enough how much the enchanting story unfolds like a flowing pop-up book.  (While 'Avatar' wins the prize for being elaborate, 'Hugo's 3-D experience is more worthwhile, my best to date.)It is the camera lens that gives us such a wide-eyed (pun intended) view about an orphaned boy who works the clocks at a Parisian train station while trying to uncode a message from his late father.  Besides his dire circumstances, he must contend with two nemeses:  One is from the toy vendor (Ben Kingsley) at one of the train's stands and a policeman (Sacha Baron Cohen) who patrols the depot and is fond of coralling wayward orphans.The story is embellished by some love interests, including an unlikely girl who becomes Hugo's companion, a flower vendor (Emily Mortimer), and the toy purveyor's wife.Not only do the 3-D effects unveil some breathtaking cinematography, but the way both the screenwriter and Scorsese unfold secret messages, secret identities, and secret hideaways, make for a treasure chest of a movie.As has been stated elsewhere, 'Hugo' is a tribute to moviemaking, but it does its best work by its own merits.  'Hugo' is a triumph of filmaking and antecedently a tribute to all the geniuses, particularly one early one, who have made films a worthy and sometimes thrilling art form.",5,Another 'Age of Innocence',1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,1557,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', ""'Hugo"", 'first', 'family', 'friendly', 'entertainment', 'just', 'endeavors', 'film', 'pays', 'dirt', 'Filled', 'passion', 'innocence', 'yet', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'works', 'well', 'own', 'merits', 'having', 'seen', '3-D', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'enchanting', 'story', 'unfolds', 'flowing', 'pop-up', 'book', ""'Avatar"", 'prize', 'being', 'elaborate', '3-D', 'experience', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'best', 'date', 'camera', 'such', 'wide-eyed', 'pun', 'intended', 'view', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'who', 'clocks', 'Parisian', 'train', 'station', 'trying', 'uncode', 'message', 'late', 'father', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'must', 'contend', 'two', 'nemeses', 'One', 'toy', 'vendor', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'one', 'train', 'stands', 'policeman', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'who', 'depot', 'fond', 'coralling', 'wayward', 'orphans.The', 'story', 'embellished', 'love', 'interests', 'including', 'unlikely', 'girl', 'who', 'Hugo', 'companion', 'flower', 'vendor', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'toy', 'purveyor', 'wife.Not', 'only', 'do', '3-D', 'effects', 'unveil', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'way', 'screenwriter', 'Scorsese', 'unfold', 'secret', 'messages', 'secret', 'identities', 'secret', 'hideaways', 'make', 'treasure', 'chest', 'movie.As', 'been', 'stated', 'elsewhere', ""'Hugo"", 'tribute', 'moviemaking', 'best', 'work', 'own', 'merits', 'triumph', 'filmaking', 'antecedently', 'tribute', 'geniuses', 'particularly', 'one', 'early', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'films', 'worthy', 'sometimes', 'thrilling', 'art', 'form']",N/A

Based on the best-selling Brian Selznick novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, the film stars Asa Butterfield as the titular boy, the orphaned son of a clockmaker who loved the films of Georges Melies. In his quest to repair the mysterious automaton that his late father left behind, Hugo befriends a young girl named Isabelle whose toymaker godfather may or may not be intimately connected to his father's automaton. Lavishly shot in 3D, Hugo evokes a strong sense of cinematic nostalgia, demonstrating Martin Scorsese's very personal love for the magic of the movies, and it's a delightful treat for all families, whether they're full of cinephiles or not. Now, it is available in Blu-ray 3D, but whether or not it will be able to duplicate the lush effects seen in theaters is still sort of up in the air; here's hoping they re-release it for a post-Oscar run.",5,Hugo,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,1080,"['84th', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'officially', 'collective', 'rear', 'view', 'mirror', 'Hugo', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'home', 'statues', 'top', 'honors', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'love', 'letter', 'cinema', 'did', 'score', 'solid', 'five', 'Oscars', 'Based', 'best-selling', 'Brian', 'Selznick', 'novel', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'film', 'stars', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'titular', 'boy', 'orphaned', 'son', 'clockmaker', 'who', 'loved', 'films', 'Georges', 'Melies', 'quest', 'repair', 'mysterious', 'automaton', 'late', 'father', 'left', 'behind', 'Hugo', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Isabelle', 'toymaker', 'godfather', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'intimately', 'connected', 'father', 'automaton', 'Lavishly', 'shot', '3D', 'Hugo', 'strong', 'sense', 'cinematic', 'nostalgia', 'demonstrating', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'very', 'personal', 'love', 'magic', 'movies', 'delightful', 'treat', 'families', ""'re"", 'full', 'cinephiles', 'not', 'Now', 'available', 'Blu-ray', '3D', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'duplicate', 'lush', 'effects', 'seen', 'theaters', 'still', 'sort', 'air', 'here', 'hoping', 're-release', 'post-Oscar', 'run']",N/A

We are all children of the film age (including Hugo and the other children who pop up in this film) and thus it was interesting to see as the ""plot"" unfolded how film began to be used the movies as a modern metaphor for humankind's imaginations, of its dreams and of the process of going from disbelief to the suspension of disbelief that is part of any film experience, including this film.As for the film itself, based on an adaptation of novelistic treatment of the wonder of discovery, of invention, and of pure fantasy inherent in trying to make dreams come to life it works pretty well. And to place that challenge in the hands of a child just adds to the effect. One might argue, and should, that the length of the film including its little redundancies (the constant background shots of the railroad station and it inhabitants) could reasonably have been shorter by about fifteen minutes. And, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that it really does take film's magical suspension of disbelief techniques to take a plot that is centered in Paris while the cast speaks the Queen's English making one think that we could have been in the center of London just as easily.

1374520,A2YW1SOKOLNG2,B003Y5H5H4,"Amazon Customer ""Movie Fan""","[5, 6]","I am a fan of movies.  Have been since I was 7, growing up in Spain where my entertainment choices were limited.  Some people think I may be a tad too fannish about the movies.  In any case, I see an average of at least 100 new (to me) movies a year, so I have more than just a passing interest in them.  I told you all that to say this:  Hugo is hands down the best movie of last year, and for a few years before.  Hollywood has been putting out some really bad sludge out there recently, and this is an example of what is great about movies.  I call it, in my case, a Willy Wonka moment.  When I first saw Willy Wonka when I was 4, I was transported to a new world that I didn't think was possible and everything was magical and fun and scary and thrilling, all in the space of about 2 hours.  It had a profound effect on me and started my lifelong thrill with the movies.  Occasionally, I get these moments, but not often.  Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future are but a few.Hugo is another.At first, from the ads I could not figure out for the life of me what it was about.  It was marketed terribly, and if I didn't have a friend who told me about the story, I would never have gone.  Without giving too much away, the story is about a young orphan named Hugo who lives in the Paris Rail Station, maintaining and winding the clocks, a job his uncle had before his father (a watchmaker) died in a fire.  His uncle, a drunk, took him in and showed Hugo the ropes and then died one day anonymously on the streets.  Hugo continues on with the work, and at the same time steals small machine parts from a toymaker to rebuild an automaton his father and he worked on before his father died.  The automaton draws something that pulls Hugo into the life of the toymaker who has been disappointed with his lot in life.  Without giving any more away, Hugo's interactions with all the characters collude together into a wonderful, life-affirming story of helping broken people gather their lives back together and go on living.  It is a story of friendship, love, and ultimately that we are here for each other and we never know the effect we may have on somebody's life.  The movie actually moved me to tears.The movie is also a primer on the birth of cinema with the historical backdrop where the story takes place.  Giants in the early movie industry show up in the movie and shows why the magical cinematograph became the art form of movies.  It celebrates the artistry and passion these early pioneers had for the craft and why artists do what they do.  This is where the movie took me away.  It reminded me of the wonder still possible in a well-told, artfully rendered story.  Scorsese is at his peak in this film.  If you get a chance to see it in 3D, watch what a master can really do with a 3D palate in his arsenal.  Avatar (and by extension James Cameron) was really good, but this is one of the best masters of the art form rendering an almost perfect picture.  You will not be disappointed, unless you are a fan of Scorsese's earlier, more violent works such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver.  This is totally different, another side.  This is the consumate artist at work.  Do yourself a favor and see this as soon as you can.  You'll thank me.  I know I thanked my friends who cajoled me into seeing it.",5,Truly the best movie of last year,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,3401,"['am', 'fan', 'movies', 'Have', 'been', 'was', '7', 'growing', 'up', 'Spain', 'where', 'entertainment', 'choices', 'were', 'limited', 'people', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'tad', 'too', 'fannish', 'movies', 'case', 'see', 'average', 'least', '100', 'new', 'movies', 'year', 'have', 'more', 'just', 'passing', 'interest', 'told', 'say', 'Hugo', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'few', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'putting', 'out', 'really', 'bad', 'sludge', 'there', 'recently', 'example', 'what', 'great', 'movies', 'call', 'case', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'moment', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'when', 'was', '4', 'was', 'transported', 'new', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'everything', 'was', 'magical', 'fun', 'scary', 'thrilling', 'space', '2', 'hours', 'had', 'profound', 'effect', 'started', 'lifelong', 'thrill', 'movies', 'Occasionally', 'get', 'moments', 'not', 'often', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Matrix', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Back', 'Future', 'are', 'few.Hugo', 'another.At', 'first', 'ads', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'life', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'marketed', 'terribly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'told', 'story', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'gone', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'story', 'young', 'orphan', 'named', 'Hugo', 'who', 'Paris', 'Rail', 'Station', 'maintaining', 'winding', 'clocks', 'job', 'uncle', 'had', 'father', 'watchmaker', 'died', 'fire', 'uncle', 'drunk', 'took', 'showed', 'Hugo', 'ropes', 'then', 'died', 'one', 'day', 'anonymously', 'streets', 'Hugo', 'work', 'same', 'time', 'steals', 'small', 'machine', 'parts', 'toymaker', 'rebuild', 'automaton', 'father', 'worked', 'father', 'died', 'automaton', 'something', 'Hugo', 'life', 'toymaker', 'who', 'been', 'disappointed', 'lot', 'life', 'giving', 'more', 'away', 'Hugo', 'interactions', 'characters', 'collude', 'together', 'wonderful', 'life-affirming', 'story', 'helping', 'broken', 'people', 'gather', 'lives', 'back', 'together', 'go', 'living', 'story', 'friendship', 'love', 'ultimately', 'are', 'here', 'other', 'never', 'know', 'effect', 'may', 'have', 'somebody', 'life', 'movie', 'actually', 'moved', 'tears.The', 'movie', 'also', 'primer', 'birth', 'cinema', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'where', 'story', 'place', 'Giants', 'early', 'movie', 'industry', 'show', 'up', 'movie', 'why', 'magical', 'cinematograph', 'became', 'art', 'form', 'movies', 'artistry', 'passion', 'early', 'pioneers', 'had', 'craft', 'why', 'artists', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'where', 'movie', 'took', 'away', 'reminded', 'wonder', 'still', 'possible', 'well-told', 'artfully', 'rendered', 'story', 'Scorsese', 'peak', 'film', 'get', 'chance', 'see', '3D', 'watch', 'what', 'master', 'can', 'really', 'do', '3D', 'palate', 'arsenal', 'Avatar', 'extension', 'James', 'Cameron', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'best', 'masters', 'art', 'form', 'rendering', 'almost', 'perfect', 'picture', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'fan', 'Scorsese', 'earlier', 'more', 'violent', 'works', 'such', 'Goodfellas', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'totally', 'different', 'side', 'consumate', 'artist', 'work', 'Do', 'favor', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'can', ""'ll"", 'thank', 'know', 'thanked', 'friends', 'who', 'cajoled', 'seeing']",N/A

1374526,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003Y5H5H4,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","Snuggling in for a night at the movies with my kiddos and a blanket was the name of the game last night; and `Hugo' was on my big screen.  Yup, I finally got around to watching this Oscar frontrunner (and winner of 5 Oscars) and I must say that I was wholly satisfied.  It is magically and charming and entertaining and really a very fun and inspired ode to filmmaking in general, and it is easy to see Martin Scorsese the man coming through in almost every frame.  This is a family film, for sure, but it has so much maturity and depth of spirit that it doesn't feel like a children's film.`Hugo' tells the story of orphan Hugo Cabret.  Hugo's father passed away and since his death Hugo has been living with his drunkard uncle and working the clocks at a train station.  His uncle has disappeared and Hugo has basically been stealing for his meals and stealing for his hobby.  You see, before his father died he found an unwanted automaton and both he and Hugo were attempting to fix it.  Hugo carried on this work, stealing from a toy merchant in the train station to find little mechanics needed to complete his task.  He's soon sniffed out by the merchant and punished, made to work off his thievery, and in the process he starts to uncover a greater truth in that little automaton he held so dear to his heart.The `message from his father' led him to an even greater discovery.Visually, `Hugo' is a feast.  The Oscar winning production design is truly eye catching.  You can't help but feel consumed by the flawlessly detailed train station and the simple yet heartwarming living arrangements.  The grandeur of the movies is captured in flashbacks and set pieces alike; and the grace of center stage illuminates the film's heart-tugging finale.  I did feel that the CGI embellishments were a tad overdone.  In some of the scenes I felt like I was watching a stop motion film, and I didn't like the way it took me out of the human appearance of the film.  Some of the sequences didn't work as intended (small moments, like when Isabelle falls in the station or the sudden `belief' in Rene's eyes) but overall there is a total emersion of grace and delight that overtakes nearly every frame of `Hugo'.  The acting is hit or miss, which is sad.  Chloe Moretz acts too hard.  You can always see her thinking about her next move.  Nothing is graceful and she holds her face in an awkward way that always tells us she's `in character'.  Asa Butterfield, on the other hand, is a wonderful actor.  While this performance was not as sincere as the one he gave in `08's `The Boy In the Striped Pajamas', he really understands how to convey emotion.  I felt that he botched his first teary outburst (pleading with Isabelle's god-mother for answers) but he nailed his final one; the most important.  Sacha Baron Cohen was awful, but Ben Kingsley was WONDERFUL.  You see, hit or miss.  It really is like that for everyone.As many have noted, this is Scorsese's homage to film restoration, which is his big charity these days.  I back him one hundred percent.  It is a shame when great films are lost to the rest of us.  That only breeds youth who are removed from the greatness that cinema has to offer.  I'm intent on my children growing up to appreciate film of all kinds, and so I truly appreciate the stance that Scorsese is making.  `Hugo' definitely touches upon that concern, especially in the final act.  It can get a little too direct (it almost felt like a script upheaval for a moment, to be honest) but Scorsese finds a way to balance it back out.In the end, `Hugo' is a delightful film.

1374541,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B003Y5H5H4,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 2]","Paris, 1931. Hugo Cabret is a young boy living in Gare Montparnasse, a railway station. He has no family and is trying to salvage parts to fix an automaton, believing it contains a message from his late father. Constantly hunted by the Station Inspector (who delights in finding orphan boys and sending them to the orphanage) and thwarted by a toy stall owner who takes his father's notebook, Hugo's quest seems doomed...until he discovers another piece of the puzzle.Hugo is director Martin Scorsese's tribute and love letter to the pioneering days of the cinema. The director's first family film and his first movie made in 3D, it's a bit of a new direction for him but also one that he embraces. Hugo is vibrant, colourful, entertaining and amusing, let down only by a slightly excessive running time.The movie hinges on the central performance of Hugo and actor Asa Butterfield (best known for playing the young Mordred in the British TV series Merlin) does great work in the role, nailing the loneliness of the young boy looking for a place in the world. Chlo Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass, Let Me In) is equally capable in the role of Isabelle, a young girl who befriends Hugo and encourages his quest. Older, more established actors like Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee also bring their A-games to the movie, with Kingsley particularly successful in his role as real-life movie pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. Arguably the biggest revelation is Sacha Baron Cohen, who leaves behind his increasingly predictable comedic roles (though not entirely his comedic talents) in the role of the Station Inspector, initially presented as a straightforward antagonist who becomes more nuanced as the film progresses.Visually, the film is a delight. Scorsese uses a combination of sets, CGI and illustrations to create a vivid, exaggerated version of the real world. Scorsese makes the slightly 'false' look of CGI into a virtue, using it imaginatively and contrasting it against the much more primitive effects of early 20th Century cinema, but which were equally groundbreaking in their day. Scorsese is well-known as a film historian and a keen preserver of old movies as well as a director, and he combines these interests with a solid storyline (adapted from an award-winning book by Brian Selznick) to create a film that is close to his heart. Crucially, however, he prevents the film from tipping into self-indulgence by ensuring that these elements are driven by the story rather than any kind of lecturing.Where the film stutters is its pacing. For a film meant to appeal to children as well as adults, the two-hour running time is a bit long for such a slight story, especially one where the writer and director have to keep contriving dramatic situations out of misunderstandings which could be solved in a single line of dialogue (why does Hugo never tell Georges that the notebook is his father's? Why doesn't he tell the Inspector that Georges is now looking after him?). This problem is accentuated by the presence of under-developed sideplots, such as the Inspector's faltering attempts to romance a flowergirl (a heavily under-used Emily Mortimer), Christopher Lee's lack of screentime and an amusing but very slight storyline involving two station workers (Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour). Perhaps expanding these storylines and dropping some of the repetitiveness of the main storyline might have been a better idea and could have filled the running-time more effectively.Still, despite this problem Hugo (****) is visually arresting and well-directed, with some educational value regarding the early days of cinema and some excellent use of emotion without descending into mawkishness (one shudders to think what an off-form Spielberg would have made of this script).",4,"Mostly excellent, but let down a little by pacing issues",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,3792,"['Paris', '1931', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'young', 'boy', 'living', 'Gare', 'Montparnasse', 'railway', 'station', 'family', 'trying', 'salvage', 'parts', 'fix', 'automaton', 'believing', 'message', 'late', 'father', 'Constantly', 'hunted', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'who', 'delights', 'finding', 'orphan', 'boys', 'sending', 'orphanage', 'thwarted', 'toy', 'stall', 'owner', 'who', 'father', 'notebook', 'Hugo', 'quest', 'doomed', 'piece', 'puzzle.Hugo', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'tribute', 'love', 'letter', 'pioneering', 'days', 'cinema', 'director', 'first', 'family', 'film', 'first', 'movie', 'made', '3D', 'bit', 'new', 'direction', 'also', 'one', 'Hugo', 'vibrant', 'colourful', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'let', 'down', 'only', 'slightly', 'excessive', 'running', 'time.The', 'movie', 'hinges', 'central', 'performance', 'Hugo', 'actor', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'young', 'Mordred', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'Merlin', 'great', 'work', 'role', 'nailing', 'loneliness', 'young', 'boy', 'looking', 'place', 'world', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Kick-Ass', 'Let', 'Me', 'equally', 'capable', 'role', 'Isabelle', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'Hugo', 'quest', 'Older', 'more', 'established', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'also', 'bring', 'A-games', 'movie', 'Kingsley', 'particularly', 'successful', 'role', 'real-life', 'movie', 'pioneer', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's.', 'Arguably', 'biggest', 'revelation', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'who', 'increasingly', 'predictable', 'comedic', 'roles', 'not', 'entirely', 'comedic', 'talents', 'role', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'initially', 'presented', 'straightforward', 'antagonist', 'who', 'more', 'nuanced', 'film', 'progresses.Visually', 'film', 'delight', 'Scorsese', 'combination', 'sets', 'CGI', 'illustrations', 'create', 'vivid', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'real', 'world', 'Scorsese', 'slightly', 'look', 'CGI', 'virtue', 'using', 'imaginatively', 'contrasting', 'much', 'more', 'primitive', 'effects', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'cinema', 'were', 'equally', 'groundbreaking', 'day', 'Scorsese', 'well-known', 'film', 'historian', 'keen', 'preserver', 'old', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'interests', 'solid', 'storyline', 'adapted', 'award-winning', 'book', 'Brian', 'Selznick', 'create', 'film', 'close', 'heart', 'Crucially', 'however', 'film', 'tipping', 'self-indulgence', 'ensuring', 'elements', 'are', 'driven', 'story', 'rather', 'kind', 'lecturing.Where', 'film', 'stutters', 'pacing', 'film', 'meant', 'appeal', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'bit', 'long', 'slight', 'story', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'keep', 'contriving', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'misunderstandings', 'could', 'be', 'solved', 'single', 'line', 'dialogue', 'why', 'Hugo', 'never', 'tell', 'Georges', 'notebook', 'father', 'Why', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Inspector', 'Georges', 'now', 'looking', 'problem', 'accentuated', 'presence', 'under-developed', 'sideplots', 'such', 'Inspector', 'faltering', 'attempts', 'romance', 'flowergirl', 'heavily', 'under-used', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'lack', 'screentime', 'amusing', 'very', 'slight', 'storyline', 'involving', 'two', 'station', 'workers', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'Perhaps', 'expanding', 'storylines', 'dropping', 'repetitiveness', 'main', 'storyline', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'filled', 'running-time', 'more', 'effectively.Still', 'problem', 'Hugo', '****', 'visually', 'arresting', 'well-directed', 'educational', 'value', 'regarding', 'early', 'days', 'cinema', 'excellent', 'use', 'emotion', 'descending', 'mawkishness', 'one', 'shudders', 'think', 'what', 'off-form', 'Spielberg', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'script']",N/A

It is the acting of Isa Butterfield that plays Hugo that makes it especially great.  He is a triffic actor. You know what he is feeling and thiking by his expressions and his bodily actions. He is a lonely boy that is looking for a real home away from the walls of the railroad station. He literally lived in the walls of the railroad station but all the action of the station was within his constant view. What he sees is like a silent movie but the actors are so good acting out their parts that you understand fully what is going on. Hugo met a girl his own age and they helped each other understand why their life was the way it was. Hugo sees the world as a huge machine with no extra parts. He says ""machines don't come with extra parts"". Therefore he believes that he and his friend have a definite purpose in the world.  If a machine or person isn't doing what it was intended to do then it is broken and that is sad and they needs fixing. He and his friend see Ben Kingsley as soneone who needed repairing and proceed to do just that. I think it was one of Ben Kingsley's best movie part. It is one of the most heart warming stories I have seen for a long time.  I wish there were more stories like this. I find most movies that have come out recently as uninteresting. There have been a few good ones like ""Tower Heist"", ""RED"", ""The King's Speech and ""Unstoppable"".  ""Hugo"" won many academy awards and deserved every one of them.

In the process of perusing the message he meets Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who may just have a message to change the reader's life.The book incorporated a lot of pictures to help tell the story. This is innovative and holds your attention. However it did not translate well into the film as the film was slow and dragged a lot in scenes and even dialog.  They lost the continuity and purpose of the story by incorporating the station inspector story that was a minor part of the book. It was too slapstick.  What was great graphics in the book translated in almost cartoonish graphics in the film.  However they did an excellent presentation of how the original films were designed to show us the stuff that dreams were made of.The flat screen version was well enough.

1374555,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B003Y5H5H4,Blago Jones,"[0, 0]","Pros: Granted, this movie is derived from a book, which has assumedly fleshed out the world in which the story takes place. I haven't read the book, but I've sampled some of the pictures within it, and there's just no comparison between the illustrations of the book and the visuals of the movie. Coupled with the wonderful visuals is a very deeply interwoven audio track. Each scene practically jumps off of the screen and draws you right into the world Scorsese created. The majority of the plot takes place in a train station in Paris, but given how thoroughly the filmmakers fleshed out that world, you can't help but want to explore more of it.We're all aware of how Hollywood is jumping all over the 3D bandwagon so that they can charge more for admission. But there are some instances where the technology is actually a useful tool and enhances the storytelling effect. This is one of those instances. The visuals become literally enveloping and greatly aid in the effect of pulling the viewer into the story. They are neither campy and in-your-face nor an afterthought, but instead they create a fully realized world that hugs the viewer in a magical blanket. (...Did I just use the word ""magical"" in something other than a very literal sense? I'm afraid I did.)Cons: The rather sizable problem with the movie, however, is that the compelling nature of technological achievements in storytelling is completely at odds with the more traditional storytelling devices, like the script and acting. The audio-visuals are busy sucking me into a world where the story and characters are trying to push me right back out. It's a very conflicting viewing experience, to say the least. The plot is one that I really couldn't care less about, but that could be remedied with a decent script. The main character, Hugo, rarely does anything other than flash those enchantingly bright blue eyes, cry, and say things that are completely void of substance. Little better can be said for the remainder of the ensemble.The cast sports the likes of Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, Sascha Baron Cohen, and Chloe Moretz, but in a vacuum, you would probably conclude that all of these people suck at movies. Moretz plays her character of a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed tyke to an aggravating tee. Cohen falls flat as the comic relief. Kingsley does an alright job, but he suffers from the same problem as the rest of the lot, and the movie as a whole, in that it's aiming to appeal to your average 10 year old. Don't get me wrong; there's a place for movies aimed at 10 year olds. I loved movies when I was 10. But I thought the median age of the Academy votership was 62, not 10. What is this doing as a Best Picture nominee?Overall: If you really want to watch this movie, I highly recommend forking out the extra cash to see it in 3D. It does the best job in recent memory of completely pulling the viewer into its world, and it's a great example for how 3D can enhance a story. The problem is that enhancing a story from ""bad"" still doesn't do a whole lot. This is another case where I get the sinking suspicion that the Academy saw a movie about the history of movies and leapt at the opportunity to heap it with praise, even if it was, in some cases, undeserved.

I took several of my younger children, ages 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. The 9 year old loved it, the middle ones were so so, and the teen hated it.I found the movie to be very slow and self indulgent in that only someone with Scorsese money and reputation could have destroyed a really good book and still have it hailed by critics. The acting was good, and the interwoven story about the two children (one looking for family, one looking for adventure, both orphans) was engaging. Another thread of the story, about the long lost history and people of early movie making was also engaging. Both could have been full movies in their own right. The thread about the train station police man and his extreme beliefs about duty was silly as were the thwarted attempts by the tea lady and her lover to get together and neither seemedHugoto belong to the overall story, other than as plot devices to create scenes or incidents.Everything was neatly linked together and tied up at the end, as is appropriate for a children's story, but that was another problem for me.

1374563,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B003Y5H5H4,Brian Driver,"[2, 2]","THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!You might have heard this once, even several times, before: ""Hugo"" is Martin Scorsese' love song to the movies.  If so, it was a menage a trois.The Invention of Hugo Cabret, written by Brian Selznick, is one of the most charming and sweet (and lengthy) children's books to have come along in a long time, and of course it, too, is a loving tribute to the early days of cinema and in particular the films of Georges Melies, an early master of stop-motion cinematography.  Melies was one of the real pioneers, serving as a producer and actor and cinematographer and editor and makeup and production designer and special effects--heck, he even wrote a soundtrack.But beyond all of that he was a director of--and I hope you're sitting--MORE THAN 500 FILMS.  While all of them were shorts, it is still a remarkable achievement.Yet for all his accomplishments his story is frequently a sad one, and it is to that end that Hugo directs a good deal of its later attention.But even if one were to throw this noble goal aside, ""Hugo"" is, first and foremost, a movie that will evoke in you the joy of watching a beautiful, moving, attentive, colorful and, above all, heartfelt emotion.  It is a tale that all of you--man, woman, boy, girl, old, young--will love.In a nutshell, an orphaned boy named Hugo (perfectly cast in the form of Asa Butterfield) is able to make a meager living keeping all the clocks ticking in a gorgeous old Paris train station during the 1930s--and here's the kicker--as long as no one realizes that his father has passed away some time ago and the boy has been running everything by himself ever since.  He is fully capable, but there are tight, tense moments when a deliciously petty and hilariously despicable station inspector (well played by Sacha Baron Cohen) gets closer and closer to discovering his secret.Hugo's one lasting connection to his father outside of the timepieces is a mysterious clockwork man, an intricate automaton that he is desperately trying to repair.  To this end he has found one friend and confidante in a young girl named Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), and together they work to discover its secrets.There are other great character actors here--Ben Kingsley, Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee, and Jude Law, to name several--but of equal or greater impact is the train station itself,  beautifully rendered and captured in all of its brass-y and steam-y splendor by director Scorcese and his fellow creators.  To this end, the movie won five Oscars (including Best Cinematography, Art Direction, and Visual Effects) and was nominated for six others (including Best Picture and Director).From its terrific opening shot--a faraway panoramic view of Paris swoops down, then inside the beautiful, gleaming Gare du Nord train station, sweeping along its gleaming tiles and rails until if finds its way into the intimate quarters of young Hugo.  It's a stunning piece of camera work and special effects, and it sets the tone for the technical mastery throughout.  But the beautiful thing is that Scorsese, despite all the technology  and inventive special effects, never loses sight of the characters the story is about, and the ultimate outcome is an is intimate, personal story about not only an orphaned boy trying to find his roots, but about the film industry as well, and its roots as well.As such, it represents the best things that a movie can do, and be: a conveyor of mass media that can still be astonishingly personal.

1374567,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B003Y5H5H4,Bruce G. Taylor,"[13, 16]","Since the  history of the art of motion pictures, along with the art of audio reproduction, have always been subjects of great interest to me, I would have expected this homage to the movies by Martin Scorsese to be at least engrossing if not emotionally involving.  Unhappily neither was the case.We have a story, which is a fantasy, set in the late 1920s to the middle 1930s taking place largely in a Parisian railway station in which, curiously, all of the characters not only exclusively speak English, but with a British accent.  Dramatically the film simply never takes off as one expects it to.  Even the action (chase) scenes are curiously static and uninvolving.  The acting style and delivery of the dialogue resemble to a very large degree the first Harry Potter picture -- utterly sleep inducing.A great effort is made to recreate the times in which the story takes place but that feeling never develops.  Visually, the film  looks very impressive and its sound recording is excellent.  Nearly every shot of Paris appears to be the result of CGI processing and everything about the ancient city looks absolutely new.  Nothing looks old or worn but appears to have been created only for this picture and intended to be discarded or erased when the film was completed.  Efforts were made to evoke the period between the Great War and World War II.  We see scenes of a group of musicians in the station with a guitarist apparently made up to resemble Django Reinhardt, but the music heard resembles romantic Parisian styles and bears no relation whatever to the jazz style for which Reinhardt was famous.  I had the distinct impression that no one in connection with the making of this film had ever heard one of Django Reinhardt's recordings.  Other recreations of historic figures pop up from time to time, as in Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" and it didn't work that well there either.When clips or recreations from the old movies of Harold Lloyd and Georges Melies are seen, they, as usual, are shown at the current sound projection speed of 24 frames per second, while having been originally shot at an average of 16 frames per second with the result that the characters are seen running around like jumping jacks and not the way they must have been seen in theaters of the times in which the films were made.  Scorsese makes an obvious appeal for the preservation of motion pictures, something with which I entirely sympathize.  But if one observes what has been achieved in film preservation in the last twenty or thirty years, I think he need have few fears.A few years ago I heard an interview I think on NPR, with a film screen writer or director whose name now escapes me.  He  made an interesting comparison between writing a novel and a screenplay.  He noted that when writing a novel, you can always go back and add more and more detail as the story requires, as in designing a building -- you just make it bigger if you have to.

But Hugo is full of enough magic, heart, and imagination to inspire anyone, young or old.Since the death of his father, twelve year old Hugo (Asa Butterfield) has lived in the train station and looked after winding the clocks. By day he keeps out of the clutches of the local inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen), who is intent on catching orphans and dispatching them off to the orphanage, and by night he works on the anamatron his father left him. The wind-up man has never worked and Hugo steals parts from a local toy shop to try and fix him. But one day, the owner of the shop, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (Ben Kingsley), catches him and absconds with Hugo's notebook full of sketches. This leads to an unlikely friendship with George's granddaughter Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), as the two are drawn into one another's worlds and discover unexpected delights along the way.Because this is a book adaptation, the plot is richer and more complex than usual. It unravels at a slow pace but has the luxurious quality of feeling like a book, as pages turn and events transpire and we learn things about everyone along the way. What stands out the most, however, is the vignettes that unfold in the background such as a romance between two people held at bay because of her aggressive dog, and the insecurities faced by the station inspector. These add an air of delight to a plot that in the second half surprises us with unexpected revelations. It does feel a trifle slow at times but the wonder of the world Scorsese creates makes up for it. I have rarely seen a more gorgeous film, full of beautiful exterior shots of France just after the first world war. Everything from snow-covered statues to the interior clockworks is breathtaking. The cast is made up of mostly British actors, many of whom will be familiar to the audience from everything from Hammer films to the Harry Potter series. (Christopher Lee, Jude Law, and others make guest appearances.) It has a wonderful musical score, and a truly tremendous main cast. The luminous eyes of Asa Butterfield often shine with unshed tears.The best stories linger with us no matter what age we are, and like a good book, Hugo is one of them.",3,Gorgeous on Blu-Ray,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,2390,"['Intelligent', 'family', 'films', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'surprise', 'one', 'would', 'come', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'who', 'better', 'known', 'sprawling', 'macabre', 'sagas', 'children', 'stories', 'Hugo', 'full', 'enough', 'magic', 'heart', 'imagination', 'inspire', 'anyone', 'young', 'old.Since', 'death', 'father', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'Hugo', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'lived', 'train', 'station', 'looked', 'winding', 'clocks', 'day', 'clutches', 'local', 'inspector', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'who', 'intent', 'catching', 'orphans', 'dispatching', 'off', 'orphanage', 'night', 'anamatron', 'father', 'left', 'wind-up', 'man', 'never', 'worked', 'Hugo', 'steals', 'parts', 'local', 'toy', 'shop', 'try', 'fix', 'one', 'day', 'owner', 'shop', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Hugo', 'notebook', 'full', 'sketches', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'George', 'granddaughter', 'Isabelle', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'two', 'are', 'drawn', 'one', 'worlds', 'discover', 'unexpected', 'delights', 'way.Because', 'book', 'adaptation', 'plot', 'richer', 'more', 'complex', 'usual', 'slow', 'pace', 'luxurious', 'quality', 'feeling', 'book', 'pages', 'turn', 'events', 'transpire', 'learn', 'things', 'everyone', 'way', 'What', 'out', 'most', 'however', 'vignettes', 'unfold', 'background', 'such', 'romance', 'two', 'people', 'held', 'bay', 'aggressive', 'dog', 'insecurities', 'faced', 'station', 'inspector', 'air', 'delight', 'plot', 'second', 'half', 'surprises', 'unexpected', 'revelations', 'feel', 'trifle', 'slow', 'times', 'wonder', 'world', 'Scorsese', 'creates', 'up', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'full', 'beautiful', 'exterior', 'shots', 'France', 'just', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'Everything', 'snow-covered', 'statues', 'interior', 'clockworks', 'breathtaking', 'cast', 'made', 'mostly', 'British', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'audience', 'everything', 'Hammer', 'films', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Jude', 'Law', 'others', 'make', 'guest', 'appearances', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'score', 'truly', 'tremendous', 'main', 'cast', 'luminous', 'eyes', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'often', 'unshed', 'tears.The', 'best', 'stories', 'linger', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'are', 'good', 'book', 'Hugo', 'one']",N/A

I also wasn't thrilled about the 3D element (as I'm not a big fan of 3D in movies anyway as they're often just gimmicky and can be annoying) but I can see where it was appropriate to make this particular film in 3D (since the story itself is a little bit of a commentary on the art of moviemaking).After many months, I finally got around to renting this movie and watching it with my kids.  I must say that the art of movie making was definitely alive here.  We didn't watch it in 3D and I was glad to say that even though there were numerous shots that were obviously taking advantage of the 3D elements, I didn't find these moments distracting or gimmicky.My fears with the Station Inspector were somewhat founded.  With Sacha Baron Cohen taking on the role of the Inspector, it was almost inevitable that the role would be larger than it was in the book.  This meant adding in plot elements and scenes that weren't part of the original story and trying to make them feel like natural appendages.  Again, I was glad to see the new treatment handled well.  I was mostly worried about the Station Inspector becoming so ""over the top"" and crazy as to distract from the subtler emotionally stirring threads of the story.  Fortunately even though the Station Inspector was quirky and intense, he wasn't so distracting as to break apart the other elements of the story.  I felt that the expanded scenes for the Inspector were well done and added fun new vignettes.I found the movie presentation of the story wonderfully endearing and heartfelt.  However it felt like it lost some of the immersive emotional nature that I felt in the book.  With the book the chapters were short and fast paced, interspersed with gorgeous artwork to complement the story.  The movie I think tried to do some of that with the great scenery and costume work as well as the 3D, but for some reason it just didn't draw me in as much as the book.  I felt like Ben Kingsley was great (granted, I've always enjoyed his acting) and I really liked the young actors who played Hugo and Isabelle.Overall I felt like the production value was great, the story was good and the acting and directing were good.  But in taking this movie from the page to the screen, it just didn't feel as  fresh and engaging to me.  I wonder if I might feel the same in re-reading the book...maybe so.  Still, I can recommend this as a touching and fun movie to watch.  It's family friendly, has some fun characters and adventure, and even mixes in some interesting educational and emotional twists.  For my money, I think I'd rather read the book.  But you wouldn't have to twist my arm too much to watch the movie again either.****3.5 out of 5 stars",4,"Great Production - Heartfelt, Stirring, Endearing",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,2985,"['Last', 'fall', 'read', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'A', 'couple', 'months', 'later', 'movie', 'version', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'trailers', 'perhaps', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'character', 'would', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'turn', 'different', 'type', 'story', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', '3D', 'element', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', '3D', 'movies', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'often', 'just', 'gimmicky', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'was', 'appropriate', 'make', 'particular', 'film', '3D', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'commentary', 'art', 'moviemaking', '.After', 'many', 'months', 'finally', 'got', 'renting', 'movie', 'watching', 'kids', 'must', 'say', 'art', 'movie', 'making', 'was', 'definitely', 'alive', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', '3D', 'was', 'glad', 'say', 'even', 'were', 'numerous', 'shots', 'were', 'obviously', 'taking', 'advantage', '3D', 'elements', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'moments', 'distracting', 'gimmicky.My', 'fears', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'were', 'somewhat', 'founded', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'taking', 'role', 'Inspector', 'was', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'larger', 'was', 'book', 'meant', 'adding', 'plot', 'elements', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'part', 'original', 'story', 'trying', 'make', 'feel', 'natural', 'appendages', 'Again', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'new', 'treatment', 'handled', 'well', 'was', 'mostly', 'worried', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'becoming', 'so', 'top', 'crazy', 'distract', 'subtler', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'threads', 'story', 'Fortunately', 'even', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'was', 'quirky', 'intense', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'distracting', 'break', 'apart', 'other', 'elements', 'story', 'felt', 'expanded', 'scenes', 'Inspector', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'added', 'fun', 'new', 'vignettes.I', 'found', 'movie', 'presentation', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'endearing', 'heartfelt', 'However', 'felt', 'lost', 'immersive', 'emotional', 'nature', 'felt', 'book', 'book', 'chapters', 'were', 'short', 'fast', 'paced', 'interspersed', 'gorgeous', 'artwork', 'complement', 'story', 'movie', 'think', 'tried', 'do', 'great', 'scenery', 'costume', 'work', 'as', 'well', '3D', 'reason', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'draw', 'as', 'much', 'book', 'felt', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'was', 'great', 'granted', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'really', 'liked', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Hugo', 'Isabelle.Overall', 'felt', 'production', 'value', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'directing', 'were', 'good', 'taking', 'movie', 'page', 'screen', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fresh', 'engaging', 'wonder', 'might', 'feel', 'same', 're-reading', 'book', 'maybe', 'so', 'Still', 'can', 'recommend', 'touching', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'family', 'friendly', 'fun', 'characters', 'adventure', 'even', 'mixes', 'interesting', 'educational', 'emotional', 'twists', 'money', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'read', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'twist', 'arm', 'too', 'much', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'either', '****3.5', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1374589,AN9J46667D80O,B003Y5H5H4,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[3, 4]","If you just looked at the trailers, you might think Martin Scorsese's latest film was about nothing more than a little boy living in the clockworks at a train station in Paris, having magical, vaguely steampunk, Harry Potter style adventures. You'd be mostly wrong. Hugo is, instead, at its heart, a film that's about films and the people who love them.The main character is a boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, like most of the French people in this movie, speaks with an English accent. He's been living at the train station ever since his father (a clockmaker), died, leaving him an orphan in the care of his drunken uncle, who maintains all the clocks at the station.Young Hugo takes over the job after his uncle disappears, though this is a secret that isn't known to the station denizens, including the local police chief (Sasha Baron Cohen). He spends his spare time stealing food and occasionally swiping bits of clockwork from an old toy maker (Ben Kingsley). This goes well for him until one day when the toy maker catches him in the act, and finds a notebook on Hugo detailing a clockwork automaton that his father was working on repairing.The toy maker goes a bit bonkers over this, and confiscates it, telling Hugo he's going to burn it. Then his young goddaughter (Chloe Grace Moretz, who thankfully doesn't kill anyone in this film), takes pity on the boy and tries to help him out. They're both surprised to realize that a key she wears around her neck fits into a keyhole on Hugo's clockwork man. They're even more surprised when the image the automaton draws is one of the Man in the Moon with a rocket sticking into his eye. That the girl's godfather is named Georges might start to give some in the audience pause for thought.I loved this film from start to finish, and it's by far the best film I've seen this year. It really does have everything, and oozes a love of film like nothing I've seen in a long time. The power of film to move the audience is explored here in ways I've never seen before, and like any good movie, it does an excellent job of showing me things I've never seen before.I also greatly enjoyed the fact that the movie takes time to slow down and explore all the supporting characters. The policeman, the flower girl, the newspaper seller, the woman at the cafe. They all get their own stories, and those add something wonderful to the film, and something sadly lacking in most movies that can't wait to get to the next explosion and haven't time for character development for their main characters, much less supporting ones.The 3D effects must be addressed. I'm not a fan of 3D, not even remotely. I find it a distraction, for the most part, and generally regard it as a way for movie studios to pad out their profits. It's generally unnecessary and adds nothing to the plot. Even in the best 3D film I've seen before this, Avatar, it wasn't that much more than a gimmick, though one used to good effect.In this film, though, it really does add something. It really does give a whole new dimension to the movie. I guess this isn't a surprise with a filmmaker like Scorsese. In his hands, this isn't a distraction, and it isn't a gimmick. I'm willing to bet that the film is just fine without 3D, but with it, it really becomes something unique and fascinating. If all 3D films were this good, I'd be less unhappy with them.Hugo is a masterpiece. Look for it to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars and for Ben Kinglesy as Best Actor. Yes, it's that time of the year again. :) Also, this movie is doing very poorly at the box office, so if you can, go see it in the theaters. You'll be happy you did.",5,Ignore the trailers.

Luckily for me in this case, it was a great thing. The Martin Scorsese-directed family movie ended up being a great time at the movies with a fascinating, and partly true, story.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a young orphan boy living alone after his father passes away (and later his uncle). He maintains the clocks within the walls of a Paris train station, stealing food as needed. He eventually meets a grumpy old man (Ben Kingsley) who owns a toy shop at the station as well as the man's goddaughter (Chlo Moretz). The two youngsters go on a few adventures, one including an automaton left by Hugo's father which he believes contains a message.The few facts I knew about the film were mainly revolving around the fact that it was a family adventure movie. About half way through the film though, the topics of early film production and preservation come into play. Much reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, Hugo has a lot of film spirit that any movie lover will appreciate. The scenes involving both clips of old movies and the characters' memories and thoughts on film make the viewer appreciate what the movies are really about.The acting is all-around well done. The surprise standout for me was Sacha Baron Cohen as the Station Inspector. The two young leads are just incredible and believable, and it goes without saying that Ben Kingsley did a wonderful job as the legendary Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. There are also a few characters placed around the train station that make everything so much more realistic and inviting. From an older fellow trying to swoon a woman (even though her dog doesn't approve) to a quiet and charming flower shop girl...there are small details and people that, while they seem minor, without them the movie wouldn't be the same.Hugo really is a fun movie and a great experience. I had no choice but to watch it in 3D at the theater, which I probably could have done without (though a few scenes did look awesome in 3D) but it still didn't take anything away form the whole experience. The music, classic film clips, and performances are not to be missed. It's got the spirit and enthusiasm that a family movie should have. This one really makes you not only appreciate film, but those close to you as well.Source: criticnic.com 25-January-2012",5,Fun and moving movie experience,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,2417,"['went', 'Hugo', 'knowing', 'very', 'little', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'really', 'fun', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Luckily', 'case', 'was', 'great', 'thing', 'Martin', 'Scorsese-directed', 'family', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'great', 'time', 'movies', 'fascinating', 'partly', 'true', 'story.Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'young', 'orphan', 'boy', 'living', 'alone', 'father', 'away', 'later', 'uncle', 'clocks', 'walls', 'Paris', 'train', 'station', 'stealing', 'food', 'needed', 'eventually', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'toy', 'shop', 'station', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'goddaughter', 'Chlo', 'Moretz', 'two', 'youngsters', 'go', 'few', 'adventures', 'one', 'including', 'automaton', 'left', 'Hugo', 'father', 'message.The', 'few', 'facts', 'knew', 'film', 'were', 'mainly', 'revolving', 'fact', 'was', 'family', 'adventure', 'movie', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'topics', 'early', 'film', 'production', 'preservation', 'come', 'play', 'Much', 'reminiscent', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'Hugo', 'lot', 'film', 'spirit', 'movie', 'lover', 'will', 'appreciate', 'scenes', 'involving', 'clips', 'old', 'movies', 'characters', 'memories', 'thoughts', 'film', 'make', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'about.The', 'acting', 'all-around', 'well', 'done', 'surprise', 'standout', 'was', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'are', 'just', 'incredible', 'believable', 'saying', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'legendary', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'characters', 'placed', 'train', 'station', 'make', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'inviting', 'older', 'fellow', 'trying', 'swoon', 'woman', 'even', 'dog', ""n't"", 'approve', 'quiet', 'charming', 'flower', 'shop', 'girl', 'are', 'small', 'details', 'people', 'seem', 'minor', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same.Hugo', 'really', 'fun', 'movie', 'great', 'experience', 'had', 'choice', 'watch', '3D', 'theater', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'few', 'scenes', 'did', 'look', 'awesome', '3D', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'form', 'whole', 'experience', 'music', 'classic', 'film', 'clips', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'got', 'spirit', 'enthusiasm', 'family', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'one', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'appreciate', 'film', 'close', 'well.Source', 'criticnic.com', '25-January-2012']",N/A
1374597,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Y5H5H4,C. Sawin,"[4, 6]","Martin Scorsese is a well respected director known for R-rated films usually revolving around crime or gangsters in some capacity. Saying the F-word nearly 300 times in one movie, stabbing someone with a pen, flushing a stash down the toilet, getting whacked, getting blown up, and getting your mind blown to such extremities in the last twenty minutes of a feature that you win an Oscar for it even though somebody already made that movie before; these are the things that come to mind when you think of Scorsese. Scorsese hadn't really worked with children much over his career or at least not to this extent. So that was interesting to keep in mind when Hugo started making the rounds. A family friendly Martin Scorsese film seems so surreal, but is more than a worthy addition to an already overflowing resume full of fantastic cinema.It takes a while for Hugo to really get going, but it's certainly beautiful in the meantime. The film is a visual spectacle while each frame is an absolute joy to look at. You're taken through the intricate insides of various clocks at a train station; seeing their gears move as the use of steam adds just the right amount of mystery. It's not so much the fact that Hugo is slow because it isn't. There's this veil of mystery that isn't lifted until Hugo (Asa Butterfield) finally caves and tells his story. The various clocks and train station setting keeps you occupied and the long introduction with no dialogue is extremely noteworthy. It's just for nearly half the film, you have all these elements (clocks, the train station, a notebook, an automaton, and Hugo's father) without much of a connection. But it does all come together in extraordinary fashion.The cast is really superb. Asa Butterfield is so passionate and emotional. Those blue eyes of his tell the story better than words ever could. Chloe Grace Moretz is so optimistic and eager for a chance at an adventure. You can't help but adore the Isabelle character. Sacha Baron Cohen seems to step way out of his element here. The Station Inspector seems like a complete 180 from Bruno or Borat, but his sense of humor is still in his performance. He just happens to have a bit more depth in comparison. Ben Kingsley's Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s goes through such a transformation in the film though that he's able to display such a wide range of emotion. He plays the broken old man impeccably.There are times when movies affect you in a way that let you know they are special. For me, it's like I'm suddenly overcome by a wide range of emotions that make me want to laugh, cry, scream at the top of my lungs, and the overwhelming sensation of never wanting that moment or the movie to end.

1374598,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B003Y5H5H4,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 3]","Martin Scorsese has a deep love for movie history and film preservation.  Both passions are imbued in Hugo, a charming tale of a child's personal search that leads to a treasure of memories and redemption.At a Paris train station in 1931 a young boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives a solitary existence.  The train inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) lurks about looking for stray children to send to the local orphanage.  One day Hugo notices an elderly watchmaker (Ben Kingsley) who sits lonely and silent.  Joined by a curious girl, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the two join forces to investigate the old man and learn that there is much more to him than meets the eye.  Add to this a mysterious mechanical man built by Hugo's father and known as an automaton whose cryptic writings may provide clues to the past.  But how to unlock these secrets?  What the young couple finds will lead them back to the old man as there seem to be a surprising connection, and through the old man, a remarkable past is rejuvenated that will harken back to the birth of movies.As the mysterious, old man, Ben Kingsley provides the gravitas to flesh out a character that at first seems dull and lonely, whose past catches up and reveals a lifetime of hope and genius heretofore forgotten by the public until Hugo and Isabelle rediscover it.  The kids are well cast although Hugo comes across a bit of an oddball whereas Isabelle is a sweet girl who compliments him.  Cohen, quite effective in a villainous role, is properly mean and threatening until he has a change of heart near the end, and you wish there had been more of him because his character evolves toward the end.In fact the whole heart concept permeates Hugo.  There is the budding love between Hugo and Isabelle, the old man's romance in his past, and even the hint of love from a flower girl.  There is the heart shaped key that unlocks the automaton's mechanism.  The automaton serves as a static character, a kind of Pinocchio in scenes where Hugo talks to it in the absence of his father.  Above all, it's all about a love for movies past and present.It is clear how much Scorsese loves movies in smaller, intimate scenes as when Hugo and Isabelle sneak into a Harold Lloyd film or when he shows snippets from earlier moving images.  The main thrust of Hugo's plot provides Scorsese the excuse to restage classic kinescope and film clips.  It's like reliving history.  Film buffs will love these moments as Scorsese lovingly and painstakingly recreates early silent film.  We see history and magic being made simultaneously!A minor problem with the film is that it feels a bit uneven at times, and you never feel fully engaged with the characters as much as you want to be.  Hugo and his friend Isabelle should be the focus all the way, but the film seems to occasionally stray from their journey.  As a couple, they are more tentative and reserved than Harry Potter and his friend Hermione in the Harry Potter series.  It lacks a strong emotional center.  One wonders how a director like Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton would have interpreted the story.Technical and production quality are superb.  This is a fully realized fantasy world especially with the overall design and art direction and costumes within the train station and immediate neighborhood.  Even the visual effects work well within the story without being a distraction.The film does works for both children and adults.  Hugo in a way represents the painful and joyous past that people keep hidden until it is released by patience and love.",4,A Genius Is Rediscovered in HUGO,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3561,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'deep', 'love', 'movie', 'history', 'film', 'preservation', 'passions', 'are', 'imbued', 'Hugo', 'charming', 'tale', 'child', 'personal', 'search', 'treasure', 'memories', 'redemption.At', 'Paris', 'train', 'station', '1931', 'young', 'boy', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'solitary', 'existence', 'train', 'inspector', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'looking', 'stray', 'children', 'send', 'local', 'orphanage', 'One', 'day', 'Hugo', 'elderly', 'watchmaker', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'lonely', 'silent', 'Joined', 'curious', 'girl', 'Isabelle', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'two', 'join', 'forces', 'investigate', 'old', 'man', 'learn', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'Add', 'mysterious', 'mechanical', 'man', 'built', 'Hugo', 'father', 'known', 'automaton', 'cryptic', 'writings', 'may', 'provide', 'clues', 'past', 'how', 'unlock', 'secrets', 'What', 'young', 'couple', 'finds', 'will', 'lead', 'back', 'old', 'man', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'surprising', 'connection', 'old', 'man', 'remarkable', 'past', 'rejuvenated', 'will', 'harken', 'back', 'birth', 'movies.As', 'mysterious', 'old', 'man', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'gravitas', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'first', 'dull', 'lonely', 'past', 'up', 'reveals', 'lifetime', 'hope', 'genius', 'heretofore', 'forgotten', 'public', 'Hugo', 'Isabelle', 'rediscover', 'kids', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'Hugo', 'bit', 'oddball', 'whereas', 'Isabelle', 'sweet', 'girl', 'who', 'Cohen', 'quite', 'effective', 'villainous', 'role', 'properly', 'mean', 'threatening', 'change', 'heart', 'end', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'character', 'end.In', 'fact', 'whole', 'heart', 'concept', 'Hugo', 'budding', 'love', 'Hugo', 'Isabelle', 'old', 'man', 'romance', 'past', 'even', 'hint', 'love', 'flower', 'girl', 'heart', 'shaped', 'key', 'automaton', 'mechanism', 'automaton', 'static', 'character', 'kind', 'Pinocchio', 'scenes', 'where', 'Hugo', 'absence', 'father', 'love', 'movies', 'past', 'present.It', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'Scorsese', 'loves', 'movies', 'smaller', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'when', 'Hugo', 'Isabelle', 'sneak', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'film', 'when', 'snippets', 'earlier', 'moving', 'images', 'main', 'thrust', 'Hugo', 'plot', 'Scorsese', 'excuse', 'restage', 'classic', 'kinescope', 'film', 'clips', 'reliving', 'history', 'Film', 'buffs', 'will', 'love', 'moments', 'Scorsese', 'lovingly', 'painstakingly', 'early', 'silent', 'film', 'see', 'history', 'magic', 'being', 'made', 'simultaneously', 'minor', 'problem', 'film', 'bit', 'uneven', 'times', 'never', 'feel', 'fully', 'engaged', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'want', 'be', 'Hugo', 'friend', 'Isabelle', 'should', 'be', 'focus', 'way', 'film', 'occasionally', 'stray', 'journey', 'couple', 'are', 'more', 'tentative', 'reserved', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'friend', 'Hermione', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'strong', 'emotional', 'center', 'One', 'how', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'would', 'have', 'interpreted', 'story.Technical', 'production', 'quality', 'are', 'superb', 'fully', 'realized', 'fantasy', 'world', 'especially', 'overall', 'design', 'art', 'direction', 'costumes', 'train', 'station', 'immediate', 'neighborhood', 'Even', 'visual', 'effects', 'work', 'well', 'story', 'being', 'distraction.The', 'film', 'works', 'children', 'adults', 'Hugo', 'way', 'painful', 'joyous', 'past', 'people', 'keep', 'hidden', 'released', 'patience', 'love']",N/A

1374603,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003Y5H5H4,DanD,"[14, 17]","Martin Scorsese is primarily known for two things: making gritty, true-to-life movies (usually set in New York City) that chronicle violence and human chaos in all its nasty forms; and loving, utterly treasuring, the art of cinema.  HUGO belongs firmly in the latter category.  It's a movie about movies; moreover, it's a movie about cherishing movies, a summation of an entire art form from one of its most devoted admirers.There is a plot here, of course: young Orphan Hugo hides in the walls of a train station, working the clocks and carrying for a robotic figure his father found in a museum.  He steals parts from a local toymaker to keep up the machine; when the toymaker catches Hugo in the act, he steals the boy's pocketbook, and Hugo sets out to get it back, with the aid of the old man's goddaughter, Isabelle.If you simply want a family movie, then HUGO will work sufficiently.  It has a plot; it moves along at a decent pace.  But to truly appreciate how magnificent this film is, you have to approach it from an entirely different point of view: that of a film lover.  This is, in effect, a very serious, very moving, very effective film.  The acting from the two child leads, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, is nothing short of wonderful; child actors are usually a sticking point for me, but Scorsese knows how to ring a fine performance from all of his actors (it doesn't hurt that both have already proven themselves to be talented up-and-comers).  Ben Kingsley delivers one of his best performances in years (perhaps of his entire career).  Other supporting players get to shine in their brief roles: Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Michael Stuhlbarg, Frances de la Tour, and Richard Griffiths (it's a whole HARRY POTTER reunion) all make significant, even if minor, contributions.  Sacha Baron Cohen, as the single-minded (and strongly anti-orphan) Station Inspector, provides some of the film's weaker moments; not Cohen himself, as his performance is dependably strong, but more the character, whose slapstick shenanigans try to remind us that this is a family film.  (Cohen is clearly aware of this, and provides decent bursts of humor elsewhere, and yes, some of it tends to lean towards the ""young adult"" spectrum of things; younger children, fortunately, probably won't catch on, and adults will get a good belly-laugh.)But the true heart of HUGO lies beyond the casting.  It's Oscar-winning effects are utterly dazzling (and I only saw it in 2D; when I finally see it in 3D, as it's intended, I think my heart will stop with pure joy).  The cinematography is also just spellbinding, and also Oscar-winning (the film took home five statues, all for more technical aspects, which is appropriate because this is one of those films where even more casual movie-goers will notice things like lighting and score). Everything comes back to Scorsese's lovelorn directing; he's a man with a crush, and he's writing a brilliant love note that goes far beyond ""check yes or no.""  HUGO may not be Scorsese's best film, but it is certainly his most special.  Anyone with a pulse can feel the love here--and it is real, genuine, and reciprocated in full.",5,Simply a beautiful piece of cinema.,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,3216,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'primarily', 'known', 'two', 'things', 'making', 'gritty', 'true-to-life', 'movies', 'usually', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'chronicle', 'violence', 'human', 'chaos', 'nasty', 'forms', 'loving', 'utterly', 'treasuring', 'art', 'cinema', 'HUGO', 'belongs', 'firmly', 'latter', 'category', 'movie', 'movies', 'moreover', 'movie', 'cherishing', 'movies', 'summation', 'entire', 'art', 'form', 'one', 'most', 'devoted', 'admirers.There', 'plot', 'here', 'course', 'young', 'Orphan', 'Hugo', 'hides', 'walls', 'train', 'station', 'working', 'clocks', 'carrying', 'robotic', 'figure', 'father', 'found', 'museum', 'parts', 'local', 'toymaker', 'keep', 'up', 'machine', 'when', 'toymaker', 'Hugo', 'act', 'boy', 'pocketbook', 'Hugo', 'out', 'get', 'back', 'aid', 'old', 'man', 'goddaughter', 'Isabelle.If', 'simply', 'want', 'family', 'movie', 'then', 'HUGO', 'will', 'work', 'sufficiently', 'plot', 'along', 'decent', 'pace', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'how', 'magnificent', 'film', 'have', 'approach', 'entirely', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'lover', 'effect', 'very', 'serious', 'very', 'moving', 'very', 'effective', 'film', 'acting', 'two', 'child', 'leads', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'nothing', 'short', 'wonderful', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'usually', 'sticking', 'point', 'Scorsese', 'how', 'ring', 'fine', 'performance', 'actors', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'have', 'already', 'proven', 'be', 'talented', 'up-and-comers', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'years', 'perhaps', 'entire', 'career', 'Other', 'supporting', 'players', 'get', 'shine', 'brief', 'roles', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'whole', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'reunion', 'make', 'significant', 'even', 'minor', 'contributions', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'single-minded', 'strongly', 'anti-orphan', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'film', 'weaker', 'moments', 'not', 'Cohen', 'performance', 'dependably', 'strong', 'more', 'character', 'slapstick', 'try', 'remind', 'family', 'film', 'Cohen', 'clearly', 'aware', 'decent', 'bursts', 'humor', 'elsewhere', 'yes', 'lean', 'young', 'adult', 'spectrum', 'things', 'younger', 'children', 'fortunately', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'belly-laugh', 'true', 'heart', 'HUGO', 'casting', 'Oscar-winning', 'effects', 'are', 'utterly', 'dazzling', 'only', 'saw', '2D', 'when', 'finally', 'see', '3D', 'intended', 'think', 'heart', 'will', 'stop', 'pure', 'joy', 'cinematography', 'also', 'just', 'spellbinding', 'also', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'took', 'home', 'five', 'statues', 'more', 'technical', 'aspects', 'appropriate', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'even', 'more', 'casual', 'movie-goers', 'will', 'notice', 'things', 'lighting', 'score', 'Everything', 'back', 'Scorsese', 'lovelorn', 'directing', 'man', 'crush', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'love', 'note', 'far', 'check', 'yes', 'HUGO', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Scorsese', 'best', 'film', 'certainly', 'most', 'special', 'Anyone', 'pulse', 'can', 'feel', 'love', 'here', 'real', 'genuine', 'reciprocated', 'full']",N/A

It was amusing to see Sacha Baron Cohen playing a role which was less outrageous than his typical characters.The part of the movie which is geared more toward adult audiences is the homage to Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, the great filmmaker. It was wonderful to see Scorsese bring elements of M&eacute;li&egrave;s's old movies to life. Watching some of the behind-the-scenes features included on the blu-ray, it was interesting to discover how much fact there is behind the movie. M&eacute;li&egrave;s really did end up forgotten and poor running a toy shop in a train station in Paris before someone re-discovered him by chance.In general I would recommend ""Hugo"" as a nice family film, despite its emotional shortcomings. Although the plot is largely predictable, the tale of redemption of Hugo and M&eacute;li&egrave;s is still entertaining. It shows how versatile a director Scorsese is, since one couldn't get much different from ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Departed"".",4,A family/children's movie by Scorsese,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1716,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'children', 'movie', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'would', 'be', 'wonder', 'more', 'Based', 'children', 'book', 'Hugo', 'much', 'simplicity', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'cinematography', 'art', 'design', 'amazing', 'not', 'Paris', 'scenery', 'was', 'real', 'generated', 'was', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'however', 'even', 'evaluated', 'level', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'little', 'more', 'feeling', 'Hugo', 'being', 'orphan', 'was', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'whole', 'lot', 'Maybe', 'was', 'Hugo', 'was', 'so', 'self-sufficient', 'even', 'rather', 'young', 'age', 'Hugo', 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'actor', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'general', 'acting', 'was', 'rather', 'good', 'was', 'amusing', 'see', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'playing', 'role', 'was', 'less', 'outrageous', 'typical', 'characters.The', 'part', 'movie', 'geared', 'more', 'adult', 'audiences', 'homage', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Scorsese', 'bring', 'elements', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'old', 'movies', 'life', 'Watching', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'included', 'blu-ray', 'was', 'interesting', 'discover', 'how', 'much', 'fact', 'movie', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'really', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'forgotten', 'poor', 'running', 'toy', 'shop', 'train', 'station', 'Paris', 'someone', 're-discovered', 'chance.In', 'general', 'would', 'recommend', 'Hugo', 'nice', 'family', 'film', 'emotional', 'shortcomings', 'plot', 'largely', 'predictable', 'tale', 'redemption', 'Hugo', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'still', 'entertaining', 'how', 'versatile', 'director', 'Scorsese', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'different', 'Goodfellas', 'Departed']",N/A

I can think of three primary goals Scorsese had in mind making ""Hugo"".  Firstly he wanted to advance the 3-D technological process but in turn he imbued it with heart that distinguishes ""Hugo"" from ""Transformers"" and their ilk.  Secondly he wanted to make a family film that not only engages the children but allows adults to appreciate the subtleties.  Lastly he wanted to promote his pet cause of film preservation and in turn resurrecting the legacy of French silent filmmaker George Melies.  Scorsese has assembled an impressive cast but special mention should be made for the youngest actors, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, whose work here belies their tender years.

Hugo evoked memories of the excitement of being young, impressionable and filled with wonder at the mysterious parts that make things work, both animate and inanimate. The movie progresses at a rather slow but steady pace at the beginning that may put off those who are looking for action in their movies. To me it did an effective job of identifying and defining Hugo with all of his dreams and aspirations; I felt a kinship with him that reminded me of certain aspects of my childhood. Gradually the clues that are given in the early part of the movie are put together and the viewer begins to see how it all fits together.The movie is visually somewhat overwhelming in its level of detail on the screen; one gets the feeling that one needs to watch it again to finish seeing all of the amazing and fascinating things being shown. This movie will be a feast for many boys and those men who have not lost their boyish sense of wonder. The role of Hugo is convincingly played by Asa Butterfield and the other lead roles are well done by such seasoned actors as Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, and many others.The movie is just over two hours long and seems to proceed at a leisurely, introspective pace.

Hugo is supposed to be a magical movie set in the 1920s about an orphaned boy who lives in a railway station clock who is seeking the secret contained in a badly rusted robotic writing machine his dead father was restoring before he died in a tragic museum conflagration. This does not sound magical. In fact, it sounds like a bit of a mess, and that's just the start of this film's problems. The script is simplistic and thoroughly unimaginative and yet, in the hands of a decent director and good cast, it might have been salvaged.Here we come to the next problem: the casting. It's bad. The main actors are not convincing, in part because they are asked to speak in plummy English accents. For some reason Scorcese must have thought this would add to the atmosphere but instead it's hugely irritating. Firstly, this movie is set in Paris, so why is everyone speaking in posh English accents? Asa Butterfield (who is English) just about gets away with it as Hugo but I'm afraid Atlanta-born U.S. actress Chlo Grace Moretz makes a horror show of her accent, which is stupendousy unconvincing. Sacha Baron Cohen's accent wanders all over the place, from the learned tone of an English professor to broad Cockney, so he also becomes a distraction.So the movie has three huge strikes against it from the start (bad script/bad acting/bad direction) and I'm afraid it doesn't recover. It's boring. No matter what supposedly innovative twist develops on the screen you're too bothered by the other irritations to pay much attention. The mystery of the robotic writing machine is solved about an hour in and the rest of the time c-r-a-w-l-s until the merciful end. Hugo is trying to be too clever and flops badly.

The last time I recall being really blown away by special effects was the 1977 STAR WARS. It seems that more often than not today, the effects either dominate or get in the way of the story. Scorsese has managed the difficult feat of hitting just the right balance. AVATAR was supposed to be the film experience that took movies to the next level, but frankly, it didn't do that much for me. But I viewed HUGO yesterday on the big screen and it was an absolutely stunning and magical movie experience! I saw it in 3D and was mesmerized from start to finish. Asa Butterfield is pitch perfect in the role of Hugo and everyone of the supporting cast all ring true. I'm not a big fan of Sasha Cohen, but he is riveting as the train station policeman. Christopher Lee and Ben Kingsley shine as well. As another reviewer stated...it's not for everybody. But as a person with an interest in the beginnings of films this movie resonated deeply with me. This is more than an homage to silent films...it is a sincere love story about them, lovingly crafted by Martin Scorsese. I often felt like I was living in a dream as I watched the story develop. In particular, I savored the scenes in the old book shop. This film was a revelation and a perfect fit for 3D (and Blu-Ray) presentation. Sure it can be predictable at times, but that is also part of the allure. Sit back and appreciate a movie master doing his best to take you on a two hour magic carpet ride.

In ""Hugo"" the effect was used in a subtle way to truly immerse you in the story, which really is the most important component to storytelling. Scorsese created magic. He took a beautiful story and full realized it for the screen. So well cast, well acted, shot beautifully. But it's all about the story. I absolutely loved it, and looked up the book it was based on (equally lovely, of course). But here's the strange thing. Coming out of the theatre, feeling a sort of quiet joy with what I had just experienced, I asked my Mom what she thought of it. She didn't like it at all. And we usually have similar tastes. So puzzling how one person can absolutely love something, and the very next person, not so much. Still, I really do recommend this film to everyone. It was great to see it in a theatre on a large screen, but it's so well done, it can still be enjoyed on our much smaller TV screens.",5,One of those rare perfect films!,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1217,"['was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'when', 'began', 'see', 'trailers', 'film', 'theatres', 'TV', 'So', 'went', 'see', 'Mom', ""'m"", 'adult', 'saw', '3D', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'used', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'films', 'tend', 'overuse', '3D', 'where', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'lot', 'weird', 'stuff', 'popping', 'out', 'screen', 'Hugo', 'effect', 'was', 'used', 'subtle', 'way', 'truly', 'immerse', 'story', 'really', 'most', 'important', 'component', 'storytelling', 'Scorsese', 'created', 'magic', 'took', 'beautiful', 'story', 'full', 'realized', 'screen', 'So', 'well', 'cast', 'well', 'acted', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'story', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'looked', 'up', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'equally', 'lovely', 'course', 'here', 'strange', 'thing', 'Coming', 'theatre', 'feeling', 'sort', 'quiet', 'joy', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'experienced', 'asked', 'Mom', 'what', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'usually', 'have', 'similar', 'tastes', 'So', 'puzzling', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'absolutely', 'love', 'something', 'very', 'next', 'person', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Still', 'really', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'theatre', 'large', 'screen', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'smaller', 'TV', 'screens']",N/A

However, there is something overly meticulous and dramatically inert in the execution that somehow makes the film miss its mark for me emotionally. As much as I admired all the technical achievements presented here, I felt a bit of a chill when it came to the emotional elements. Adapted by John Logan (The Aviator) from Brian Selznick's historic fiction novel,The Invention of Hugo Cabret(2007), the fanciful story centers on Hugo, a twelve-year-old urchin who lives within the walls of Paris' Gare Montparnasse railway station in 1931. His father was a master clockmaker who took Hugo to see the early films of cinematic pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (A Trip to the Moon (1902)) and was working on his most ambitious project, repairing a mechanical robot who could write with a pen, when he died suddenly in a fire.Hugo is taken away by his drunkard uncle, who took care of the main railway clock until he disappeared one night. All the while, the boy obsesses over finishing his father's project by pilfering gears and other parts he finds in the station toy shop run by none other than M&eacute;li&egrave;s who has fallen on hard times. Now an embittered man, he take's Hugo's prized notebook with all his father's notes and threatens to burn it as punishment. However, M&eacute;li&egrave;s decides to let the boy earn back the parts he stole by working in the shop. Hugo also meets M&eacute;li&egrave;s' precocious goddaughter, an orphan named Isabelle who is a bit older than him. They bond immediately with he taking her to the movies for the first time and she leading him to the key that unlocks the mechanical man's programmed capabilities. Through quite a few convolutions in the plot, including an elaborate dream sequence, the connection between M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his earlier groundbreaking work is finally recognized and celebrated.Finally back in a top-grade production, Ben Kingsley plays the gruff and mysterious filmmaker-turned-toyshop owner with the ideal mix of austerity and frustration. Chlo Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) is also winning and immensely likable as Isabelle. The same can't be quite said about Asa Butterfield's (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas) sullen performance in the title role. The young actor has the immense weight of the story on his shoulders, but he doesn't provide enough conviction to gravitate the heart to Hugo's plight. The most problematic performance is Sacha Baron Cohen's (Borat) slapstick-driven turn as the station inspector. It's not so much the stunt-casting aspect as it is the anomalous approach he takes in making the character strangely menacing with little redeeming value. Much smaller roles are taken by Jude Law as Hugo's father and Emily Mortimer as a flower girl.

1374644,A3A8P8IBH7L1WW,B003Y5H5H4,Edward,"[0, 3]","Martin Scorsese, with his portfolio of underworld epics, is not exactly your average fabulist, but his latest picture ""Hugo"" is the bittersweet fable of a broken man repaired by the devotion of a sensitive child. Scorsese's screenplay was written by John Logan, based on Brian Selznick's novel titled ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", but as I have not read the novel I can't compare the two. The story as Logan and Scorsese present it concerns a young boy living in the Montparnesse railroad station who tends the clocks and watches over a strange automaton left to him by his father. The automaton is disabled and needs mechanical parts for which the boy is willing to steal. (It also requires a special key right out of ""The Secret Garden"".) In pilfering parts for the robot the boy is caught by an old man who runs a toy/candy concession in the train station, and it is their relationship which reveals the plot's secrets. It turns out that the concessionaire is none other than Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, the master artist of the silent screen, who created ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" and dozens of other films, many of which are lost. From this point on ""Hugo"" is half ethereal fantasy and half realistic history, but Scorsese balances the two halves well. In an interesting flashback M&eacute;li&egrave;s tells how he began making his inventive films, enjoyed enormous popularity, but fell out of favor after the Great War. (The story seems to take place in the early 1930s; M&eacute;li&egrave;s died in 1938.) Scorsese and his cinematographer Robert Richardson decided to film their picture in 3D, an amusement to which I have become immune -- my initial thrill of watching Vincent Price stalk Phyllis Kirk through those deep dark streets is long gone -- but there are some lovely effects here, including an aerial view of a snowy Paris and stunning interior shots of a crowded theater. This is not Scorsese's masterpiece by any means (that, I think, is ""Goodfellas""), but ""Hugo"" is an imaginative and intelligent adventure. By the way, some of the publicity includes a picture of the little boy in a Harold Lloyd type situation, implying that this is a kids' movie; but the first half is awfully talky, and the general mood is a little sophisticated for the average child.",4,Scorsese's trip to the moon,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2279,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'portfolio', 'underworld', 'epics', 'not', 'exactly', 'average', 'fabulist', 'latest', 'picture', 'Hugo', 'bittersweet', 'fable', 'broken', 'man', 'repaired', 'devotion', 'sensitive', 'child', 'Scorsese', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'John', 'Logan', 'based', 'Brian', 'Selznick', 'novel', 'titled', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'story', 'Logan', 'Scorsese', 'present', 'young', 'boy', 'living', 'Montparnesse', 'railroad', 'station', 'who', 'clocks', 'watches', 'strange', 'automaton', 'left', 'father', 'automaton', 'disabled', 'mechanical', 'parts', 'boy', 'willing', 'steal', 'also', 'special', 'key', 'right', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'pilfering', 'parts', 'robot', 'boy', 'caught', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'toy/candy', 'concession', 'train', 'station', 'relationship', 'plot', 'secrets', 'out', 'concessionaire', 'none', 'other', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'master', 'artist', 'silent', 'screen', 'who', 'created', 'Le', 'Voyage', 'la', 'Lune', 'dozens', 'other', 'films', 'many', 'are', 'lost', 'point', 'Hugo', 'ethereal', 'fantasy', 'half', 'realistic', 'history', 'Scorsese', 'balances', 'two', 'halves', 'well', 'interesting', 'flashback', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'tells', 'how', 'began', 'making', 'inventive', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'enormous', 'popularity', 'fell', 'favor', 'Great', 'War', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'early', '1930s', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'died', '1938', 'Scorsese', 'cinematographer', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'decided', 'film', 'picture', '3D', 'amusement', 'have', 'become', 'immune', 'initial', 'thrill', 'watching', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'stalk', 'Phyllis', 'Kirk', 'deep', 'dark', 'streets', 'long', 'gone', 'are', 'lovely', 'effects', 'here', 'including', 'aerial', 'view', 'snowy', 'Paris', 'stunning', 'interior', 'shots', 'crowded', 'theater', 'not', 'Scorsese', 'masterpiece', 'means', 'think', 'Goodfellas', 'Hugo', 'imaginative', 'intelligent', 'adventure', 'way', 'publicity', 'picture', 'little', 'boy', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'type', 'situation', 'implying', 'kids', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'awfully', 'talky', 'general', 'mood', 'little', 'sophisticated', 'average', 'child']",N/A
1374645,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003Y5H5H4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","HUGO (2011, prod. Johnny Depp and Martin Scorsese, dir. Martin Scorsese, 127 minutes, based on the novelThe Invention of Hugo Cabretby Brain Selznick) is one of those films that makes me envy the very young, who are just old enough to have been taken to see it by their parents, and appreciate it. They will grow, and in middle age and beyond, will think back on it with nostalgia. And they will watch it repeatedly.It also reminded me of my childhood in a way that made me catch at my breath.Hugo Cabret (an enchanting, old-souled Asa Butterfield) is a lonely boy living inside the walls and the attic of the Paris train station. Having been taught by his watchmaker father (Jude Law) about all things mechanical, and by his uncle (Ray Winstone) to maintain all the clocks perfectly, he lives a lonely, spooked life. He steals his daily food, tends the clocks, and tries to bring an automaton back to life.This clockwork 'android' - discovered by his father in a museum shortly before his untimely death in a freak fire - holds a magical mystery that the boy must unravel. (It is based on The Jaquet-Droz automatons, built between 1768 and 1774 and still in working order today.)Set in a shop inside the station is a bitter old man (Ben Kingsley), who sells toys, magic tricks and repairs clockworks. Hugo steals from him regularly, because this man has the parts Hugo needs to finish fixing the automaton. This old man happens to be the legendary magician and filmmaker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s.I will spoil a little and tell you: the train station is the Gare Montparnasse. Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s did in fact work as a toymaker at that station after World War I. The spectacular derailment scene (in Hugo's dream) is a reference to the famous 1895 derailment at the station - and a reference to the great train crash from one of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' films.This rich, kinematic-cinematic joy will teach you first of all that there is life beyond HARRY POTTER. It will show you colors you thought you'd forgotten and make you feel what you thought you could no longer feel. It will make you laugh and cry. It will become a part of you. Set in the late 1920s, it is rich in visual flashes of our true history: the films of M&eacute;li&egrave;s, movie posters of everything fromJudex (Deluxe Edition)(see my review) toFANTOMASto Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd (famous scenes from their films are featured), the streets of Paris as you've never seen them.You will see Sir Ben Kingsley give his greatest performance sinceGandhi- and it will make you feel as warm as a mug of hot chocolate to see him in full, glorious action again. Things will puzzle you: who exactly was Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s? (He was very real and you'll see plenty of scenes from his movies.) Did they really make ladies' heels out of repurposed old film? What's the deal with Christopher Lee and Sacha Baron Cohen? - all reminiscent of questions kids ask after seeing a magic show.Trust me, you'll not have seen magic like this too often, and it is a darned shame we don't see it often enough. If only all films were like this - it even gives you the lineage of great magic: Robert Houdin, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (which leads to the unmentioned Harry Houdini). The ending cannot be spoilt, yet I have a feeling you might know what it is already.Get this. Please, get it and immerse yourself, treat yourself to it. History - and magic, and the history of magic and film - never so easy, so fun or so deep. Even the pointless 3D can be ignored if you fancy.With the delightful talents of Chlo Grace Moretz, Emily Mortimer, Helen McRory, Frances de la Tour, and Richard Griffiths.",5,"""If you lose your purpose, it's like you're broken.""",1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,3669,"['HUGO', '2011', 'prod', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'dir', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', '127', 'minutes', 'based', 'novelThe', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabretby', 'Brain', 'Selznick', 'one', 'films', 'very', 'young', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'see', 'parents', 'appreciate', 'will', 'grow', 'middle', 'age', 'will', 'think', 'back', 'nostalgia', 'will', 'watch', 'repeatedly.It', 'also', 'reminded', 'childhood', 'way', 'made', 'catch', 'breath.Hugo', 'Cabret', 'enchanting', 'old-souled', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'lonely', 'boy', 'living', 'walls', 'attic', 'Paris', 'train', 'station', 'Having', 'been', 'taught', 'watchmaker', 'father', 'Jude', 'Law', 'things', 'mechanical', 'uncle', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'maintain', 'clocks', 'perfectly', 'lonely', 'spooked', 'life', 'daily', 'food', 'clocks', 'tries', 'bring', 'automaton', 'back', 'life.This', 'clockwork', ""'android"", 'discovered', 'father', 'museum', 'shortly', 'untimely', 'death', 'freak', 'fire', 'magical', 'mystery', 'boy', 'must', 'unravel', 'based', 'Jaquet-Droz', 'automatons', 'built', '1768', '1774', 'still', 'working', 'order', 'today', 'Set', 'shop', 'station', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'toys', 'magic', 'tricks', 'repairs', 'clockworks', 'Hugo', 'steals', 'regularly', 'man', 'parts', 'Hugo', 'finish', 'fixing', 'automaton', 'old', 'man', 'be', 'legendary', 'magician', 'filmmaker', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's.I', 'will', 'spoil', 'little', 'tell', 'train', 'station', 'Gare', 'Montparnasse', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'did', 'fact', 'work', 'toymaker', 'station', 'World', 'War', 'spectacular', 'derailment', 'scene', 'Hugo', 'dream', 'reference', 'famous', '1895', 'derailment', 'station', 'reference', 'great', 'train', 'crash', 'one', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'films.This', 'rich', 'kinematic-cinematic', 'joy', 'will', 'teach', 'first', 'life', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'will', 'show', 'colors', 'thought', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'make', 'feel', 'what', 'thought', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'will', 'become', 'part', 'Set', 'late', '1920s', 'rich', 'visual', 'flashes', 'true', 'history', 'films', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'movie', 'posters', 'everything', 'fromJudex', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'see', 'review', 'toFANTOMASto', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'famous', 'scenes', 'films', 'are', 'featured', 'streets', 'Paris', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'them.You', 'will', 'see', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'give', 'greatest', 'performance', 'sinceGandhi-', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'as', 'warm', 'mug', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'see', 'full', 'glorious', 'action', 'again', 'Things', 'will', 'puzzle', 'who', 'exactly', 'was', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'was', 'very', 'real', ""'ll"", 'see', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'movies', 'really', 'make', 'ladies', 'heels', 'repurposed', 'old', 'film', 'What', 'deal', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'reminiscent', 'questions', 'kids', 'ask', 'seeing', 'magic', 'show.Trust', ""'ll"", 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'magic', 'too', 'often', 'darned', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'often', 'enough', 'only', 'films', 'were', 'even', 'lineage', 'great', 'magic', 'Robert', 'Houdin', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'unmentioned', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'ending', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'spoilt', 'yet', 'have', 'feeling', 'might', 'know', 'what', 'already.Get', 'Please', 'get', 'immerse', 'treat', 'History', 'magic', 'history', 'magic', 'film', 'never', 'so', 'easy', 'so', 'fun', 'so', 'deep', 'Even', 'pointless', '3D', 'can', 'be', 'ignored', 'fancy.With', 'delightful', 'talents', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Helen', 'McRory', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'Richard', 'Griffiths']",N/A
1374646,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B003Y5H5H4,Ehkzu,"[326, 369]","Few read reviews to find out whether the reviewer liked the film. They want to know whether THEY will like the film--to decide whether to see the movie or not, and whether to see it in the theater or wait and see the DVD (or the download). That's the task I'll take on here.As the Rottentomato website has already shown (it assembles and correlates scads of reviews from the press and the web, along with reader responses), the critics adore this film, the audience somewhat less so.Part of this has to do with managing expectations. The marketing presents Hugo as an Avatar-ish 3D fantasy with a C3P0 (StarWars)-type flying robot. this is actively misleading, though that's not the director's fault.What Hugo is, is a fable--not a fantasy--that's part tween adventure and part infomercial for the preservation and viewing of old silent movies. Most importantly--and this is a point that hasn't been made by most reviewers here and elsewhere--it's a film about ex-magician/early filmmaker Georges Meli&eacute;s that Scorsese made, to a degree, IN THE STYLE of a Georges Meli&eacute;s movie. That's part of the homage.Thus ""Hugo"" contains a lot of adventurous running-around, a brilliant exploitation of the best 3D filmmaking technology extant, and a leavening of slapstick elements--particularly from the surprisingly restrained Sascha Baron Cohen.It's a fable based on real events in the early history of movies. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" was a fable with no fantasy elements other than its happy-ending-inevitability, which you feel from beginning to end. That's the essence of a fable, not whether it has fantasy elements or not. A fable is a kind of ritual that reaffirms the tribe's values and faith in its vision of life.Hugo reaffirms faith in goodness--that even in many apparently hard-hearted people there's an ember that can be fanned into life by the right person. The movie's vibe from its first seconds tells you that you are riding towards a happy ending.Two Russian intellectuals that I saw the movie with hated that fact. They think a movie is unrealistic unless everyone's doomed, and if you'd grown up in the Soviet Union that was probably realistic. Especially since Soviet-era fable-movies did guarantee a happy ending--""happy"" as defined by Soviet ideology at least. So for my friends. fables aren't just false, but evil State Propaganda. And a lot of Americans who fancy themselves intellectual have a similarly jaundiced perspective about Hollywood's addiction to guaranteed by hook or by crook happy endings.I think this issue stems from not understanding the ritual validity of fable. I love realistic movies without this guarantee of happy outcomes, but I also love a good fable. I'm certain of my spouse's love for me and of my love for her. I'm certain of our relationship with our closest friends, as they are of us reciprocally. I'm certain of the law-abidingness of my society (especially compared to the third-world countries we've traveled in). Predictable good outcomes are, within reasonable constraints, reasonable to believe in, in many ways.So ""Hugo""'s ultimate predictability is a valid artistic choice. It's not a spoiler to say this because you know it from the start and you should know so you don't confuse this with a Sundance-type art film where everyone is confused and faces an uncertain future, usually alone. I apologize for ""Hugo"" not being a slit-your-wristsathon. I also like such films, and they usually set your expectations from the start as well, for that matter.So who will enjoy ""Hugo"" ?1. Bright tweens. It stars a pair of bright tweens, so this is a natural. Many younger kids will like it as well--it's visually a treat, and it is based on a kids' story. But duller/much younger/Disneyfied kids who want nonstop action and/or the relentless cheerful action of a Disney film will probably find their attention wandering in places.2. Everyone who's interested in the history of filmmaking--particularly right at the beginning.3. Everyone who's interested in modern filmmaking. This does represent the absolute state of the art in 3D cinematography--where its 3Dness is integral and almost taken for granted, not tacked on, not poke-you-in-the-eye, not several layers of 2D images.4. Everyone who's interested in good fable direction/screenwriting/acting. This is not to say anyone involved in this project can't do naturalistic films or fantasy films, or, in the case of Chloe Grace Moretz, naturalistic fantasy films (""Let me in""). So no negatives are proven here. That said, I believe the casting was spot on for the major and minor roles. This is one area where Scorsese didn't copy the stagy mugging of Meli&eacute;s' films (except during re recreations of those films). The large, intent close-ups of the major characters really exposed their acting chops, and all came through. The boy, who I'd never seen before, kept it subtle, as well as the other juvenile character, Isabelle (played by Moretz). The young actors in many youth-oriented films tend to mug--again, Disney movie style--and kids who expect that need to be prepped by their parents to look for more lifelike acting here.Who won't love it?1. It's not a Selena Gomez/Demi Lovato/Disney vehicle. It's nothing like Lindsay Lohan's wonderful ""Parent Trap,"" one of the best of the normal good-quality kids' film. It too is a fable, but it isn't overlaid with all the stuff about film history and suchlike. ""Hugo""'s ideal kid audience is going to be like Isabelle in the move--sweet, bookish, curious, and not locked into peer culture as the source of everything that could possibly be of interest to one.2. People who don't like the fable genre. The film embeds pretty naturalistic performances and note-perfect sets showing a Paris train station circa 1931, where most of the action takes place within a non-naturalistic film fable. There are lots of non-fable films. See one of those unless you really do want to see state of the art 3D cinematography and want to ratchet up your suspension of disbelief in order to watch this.3. People with zero interest in film history. This is where a lot of movie critics err. Of course nearly all of them are fascinated by early film history. But this film verges on being a high quality 2 hour infomercial for film preservation, and you know, reading this, whether such prolonged self-regard on the part of the filmmaker towards his medium will fascinate or annoy you.4. Adults who don't like films starring children. I detect this bias in people who criticize the performances of ""Hugo""'s two junior leads, who are both exemplary. Also, I hadn't seen the boy before, but I have seen Moretz costarring in the grim, critically acclaimed ""Let Me In,"" in which she portrays--with almost no dialogue and almost no special effects--a bloodthirsty (literally) yet profoundly conflicted child vampire, and in which those averse to sunny endings will get their wishes more than satisfied. And in which her appearance and performance have been compared favorably to a very young Ingrid Bergman. That is, she has gravitas. Of people in her age bracket, the only other actor I can think of who has that is Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit).My point here is that Moretz's acting chops are now an established fact. She has a far less complex character to portray in ""Hugo,"" yet even in Isabelle's wide-eyed pre-ingenue role she infuses her character with a kind of luminosity that holds its own even when she's sharing the screen with great adult actors like Ben Kingsley.5. Adults who only want to see heavily plot-driven films. It's not like ""Hugo"" is one of those kaleidoscopic non-narrative films. It tells a story, to be sure. But besides the child-centered narrative there's a biopic about Georges Meli&eacute;s (and his wife) here, told in flashback, along with excursions into film history. Some people will find that as rich as a multicourse meal; others will be annoyed by ""Hugo"" not being propelled by a singular narrative drive. Such people will sit there saying ""All right, Scorsese--get to the point!""6. Those who are really reluctant to pay to see the film in a theater, even if they're eager to see it on DVD. I agree with this feeling nearly all of the time. However, some films are so visually huge--and, especially, if they're 3D and do that well--you need to bite the bullet and see it in a theater, if only to compare what it's like in a theater in 3D with what it's like on your flat screen TV at home in 2D. Hey, you can always see it in a bargain matinee, as we did. But we'll probably get the DVD when it comes out as well, because it both makes and recalls film history.",4,No-Spoilers review of the 3D movie and the coming 2D DVD,1324252800,"12 19,

That is not what the movie is about. It is a fine movie but the concept is quite a bit different. It is more reality and less fantasy. Hugo, an orphaned boy in 1930s Paris, survives on his own at a train station and manages to wind up clocks regularly and to work on assembling a robot, in part to continue his father's work and in hope of getting a message from his father. He has to be continuously on guard as the station's trainmaster will quickly send any orphan to the orphanage. He develops a complicated relationship with a poor storekeeper and his god-daughter. The two children make fascinating discoveries about the shopkeeper's past.This is a movie lover's movie.

1374649,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B003Y5H5H4,ElectricMelody,"[18, 22]","**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 11/30/11**I'm an enormous fan of well-made ""kid movies,"" or as I like to think of them, movies for the uncynical and young at heart. I think one of the biggest reasons they appeal to me so much is that they cut to the core of things. Oftentimes, a coming-of-age or childlike film gets right down to who a filmmaker is at their essence. This happens more often when great writers and directors are at the helm of these movies. They feel very personal. That's one of the reasons why I consider this and JJ Abram's Super 8 to be my favorite movies of the year.Based on a children's book by Brian Selznick (which, it kills me to say, I actually haven't read), Hugo is a completely unique, almost dream-like fable. I went in with little knowledge of the story and no expectations, which I think is the best possible frame of mind to be in before you watch this movie. After about the first fifteen minutes (more of an introduction to the title character's world... which ends with a stunning reveal of 1930s Paris) I found myself utterly engrossed. Riveted, even. This feeling lasted through the entire movie and the weird thing is, it's not a wham bang action thriller with huge plot twists and explosions. It's not the kind of thing I'd expect to be riveted by... yet there I was.Now that I've given it some thought, I can put it down to several factors. First, the world of Hugo is utterly immersive. The color palette, the cinematography (the angles used to shoot inside the station are just thrilling to watch) and the side stories of the different goings on inside the station all add up to create a sense of place that's absolutely transportive. It's like a classic painting come to life. Story and character aside, it's beautiful to look at. But that's selling the story short. After awhile, you do know where it's going, but the journey to get there had me guessing. What's up with this strange boy's salvaged automaton? Or the mysterious toy seller, or the secrets his dead father seemed to know? I love a good mystery, especially when it pays off as well as this one did. I didn't expect the rich taste of history and filmmaking we get in the film's latter half. This is that deep, personal connection I was talking about earlier. It definitely feels like this is Scorsese's core. You almost expect the movie to head in a fantasy direction. What you get is quite different, and far more affecting.Finally, I'd be leaving a gaping hole if I didn't at least mention the acting. It's uniformly excellent... ""kid movie"" or not. I've loved everything that Chlo Grace Moretz's done, so it's no surprise that she's amazing here (and it's nice to see her playing against the Let Me In/Kick-Ass type). Sacha Baron Cohen hams it up a little much here and there, but turns in a performance that ends up to be much more layered than it first seems. Ben Kingsley has one of the tougher performances and plays a critical role in the central mystery. He carries it off brilliantly, of course. And Asa Butterfield, the youngest of the bunch, carries the movie on his shoulders with a pair of ultra-expressive blue eyes that often speak louder than any line he's been given. He's the heart of Hugo, and wouldn't be a total shocker come Oscar nomination time.The vague marketing isn't doing Hugo any favors, but if you like intelligent, engrossing, character driven movies (that just happen to star a child), you've got to check this out. Hell, if you're a fan of movies and moviemaking in general, I don't see how you could miss it!",5,A Masterpiece,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,3576,"['**Originally', 'posted', '1', 'Hits', 'Planet', '11/30/11**I', ""'m"", 'enormous', 'fan', 'well-made', 'kid', 'movies', 'like', 'think', 'movies', 'uncynical', 'young', 'heart', 'think', 'one', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'appeal', 'so', 'much', 'cut', 'core', 'things', 'Oftentimes', 'coming-of-age', 'childlike', 'film', 'right', 'down', 'who', 'filmmaker', 'essence', 'more', 'often', 'when', 'great', 'writers', 'directors', 'are', 'helm', 'movies', 'feel', 'very', 'personal', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'consider', 'JJ', 'Abram', 'Super', '8', 'be', 'favorite', 'movies', 'year.Based', 'children', 'book', 'Brian', 'Selznick', 'say', 'actually', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Hugo', 'completely', 'unique', 'almost', 'dream-like', 'fable', 'went', 'little', 'knowledge', 'story', 'expectations', 'think', 'best', 'possible', 'frame', 'mind', 'be', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'more', 'introduction', 'title', 'character', 'world', 'stunning', 'reveal', '1930s', 'Paris', 'found', 'utterly', 'engrossed', 'Riveted', 'even', 'feeling', 'lasted', 'entire', 'movie', 'weird', 'thing', 'not', 'wham', 'bang', 'action', 'thriller', 'huge', 'plot', 'twists', 'explosions', 'not', 'kind', 'thing', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'riveted', 'yet', 'was.Now', ""'ve"", 'given', 'thought', 'can', 'put', 'down', 'several', 'factors', 'First', 'world', 'Hugo', 'utterly', 'immersive', 'color', 'palette', 'cinematography', 'angles', 'used', 'shoot', 'station', 'are', 'just', 'thrilling', 'watch', 'side', 'stories', 'different', 'goings', 'station', 'add', 'up', 'create', 'sense', 'place', 'absolutely', 'transportive', 'classic', 'painting', 'come', 'life', 'Story', 'character', 'aside', 'beautiful', 'look', 'selling', 'story', 'short', 'awhile', 'do', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'journey', 'get', 'there', 'had', 'guessing', 'What', 'up', 'strange', 'boy', 'salvaged', 'automaton', 'mysterious', 'toy', 'seller', 'secrets', 'dead', 'father', 'seemed', 'know', 'love', 'good', 'mystery', 'especially', 'when', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'rich', 'taste', 'history', 'filmmaking', 'get', 'film', 'latter', 'half', 'deep', 'personal', 'connection', 'was', 'talking', 'earlier', 'definitely', 'Scorsese', 'core', 'almost', 'expect', 'movie', 'head', 'fantasy', 'direction', 'What', 'get', 'quite', 'different', 'far', 'more', 'affecting.Finally', ""'d"", 'be', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'hole', 'did', ""n't"", 'least', 'mention', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'kid', 'movie', 'not', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'everything', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'done', 'surprise', 'amazing', 'here', 'nice', 'see', 'playing', 'Let', 'Me', 'In/Kick-Ass', 'type', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'up', 'little', 'much', 'here', 'there', 'performance', 'up', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'layered', 'first', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'one', 'tougher', 'performances', 'critical', 'role', 'central', 'mystery', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'course', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'youngest', 'bunch', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'pair', 'ultra-expressive', 'blue', 'eyes', 'often', 'louder', 'line', 'been', 'given', 'heart', 'Hugo', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'total', 'shocker', 'come', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'time.The', 'vague', 'marketing', ""n't"", 'doing', 'Hugo', 'favors', 'like', 'intelligent', 'engrossing', 'character', 'driven', 'movies', 'just', 'happen', 'star', 'child', ""'ve"", 'got', 'check', 'out', 'Hell', ""'re"", 'fan', 'movies', 'moviemaking', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'miss']",N/A

1374656,A283JVPUGXOFAZ,B003Y5H5H4,Ermite,"[1, 2]","I wish it had won more awards.  This film about a desperate orphan, who finds a home, was so well made that it charmed some of the most jaded audiences and critics.  Time is one of the motifs.  Hiding in the Parisian train station, Hugo is the ghost in the machine who, unseen, keeps the giant clockwork lubricated and on-time.  Hugo is the boy in the moon, peeping out from the giant, white clock face to wonder at the small world beneath him; he watches the scurry of life and little romances.  Enhanced by its appropriate and charming score, the film succeeds on almost every note.I think there are a couple of things I would have made stronger or forecast better.  For example, Hugo should be seen actually learning to repair clocks from his father; and, sometimes you can't be subtle with audiences, though it may be intimated that he's running out of time before he's caught, why does he feel his last chance is with Papa Georges.  Maybe I'm the one who's missing it because I can be hypercritical.  Hugo, all alone, wonders about his purpose in the world.  In the end, Hugo's purpose is revealed.  He ""repairs"" the broken people around him, Papa Georges Meli&eacute;s and the Station Inspector, for example.  He finds a home.  The wonderful (magical?) automaton, a simulacrum of his father (and the actor who portrayed him), also comes home.I'm skeptical of 3D.  It's always been (and probably always will be) a gimmick.  The 3D version in theaters worked, however, because Scorsese played with it, worked with it, as a tool to tell the story, like Meli&eacute;s did with magic tricks.  One reviewer opined that Scorsese may have saved 3D.  Scorsese must have had great fun.The film is perfectly cast.  Without Sir Ben Kingsley and Sir Christopher Lee, the story is diminished.  Caught on the cusp of adolescence, Asa Butterfield and Cloe Moretz, are terrific.

1374662,A1AW35YVQ61AA3,B003Y5H5H4,Frank Leonidas,"[4, 8]","My favorite Scorsese films (Mean Streets; Taxi Driver; The King of Comedy; Goodfellas) have always felt 'non-Hollywood' to me; my least favorite (Gangs of New York; The Aviator; The Departed; Shutter Island) seem to be the most conventional and reliant on Hollywood formula. Not all formulaic films are bad. The King's Speech is one of the most typical Hollywood films to come along in years and it's still a pleasure to watch (though a bit sappy).No films are perfect, unless they are perfectly bad. Of course, there is something joyful about watching a perfectly bad film (Plan 9 from Outer Space; Attack of the 50 Foot Woman). When a film tries it's hardest to do more and fails considerably, it can become aggravating. Scorsese's Hugo is not technically a bad film. On the other hand, it's not a good one either. It falls short on so many levels it's hard to even give it a fair estimation without sounding like a cynic. For starters: it's clumsy. It's filled with more CGI than an average live-action outing and if it weren't for the human actors who populate it, I would say it felt almost totally animated along The Polar Express lines. For a kids film, there is little or no sense of wonder or adventure in it. Hugo gets chased by an orphan-obsessed station inspector (with a leg that symbolically reminded me of von Rauffenstein's neck brace in Grand Illusion) and that's about it. There are many symbolic references (intentional or otherwise) in Hugo. So much so, I began to wonder what was actually original about the film. I also began to wonder exactly how and why Scorsese sold out yet again to the establishment.A rough, challenging film like Taxi Driver or a sweet, introspective one like Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore aren't going to do well at the cineplex -- unless they are made by Martin Scorsese. There's the rub. Scorsese has a built-in audience (and critics cheering squad) regardless of what he does. He's also spent the better part of the last two decades making conventional, indirect films that seem like they could have been directed by, well...anyone. When he made Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, it stuck out as an anomaly in his early career because it had a central female protagonist. Hugo is another anomaly, simply because it's a kids film. The big difference between the two movies is Alice seemed to defy convention and refused to be a weepy women's issue picture. Hugo on the other hand strives to be a personal story of abandonment and redemption as well as grand historical fantasy. While it flirts relentlessly with these ambitions, it never really grabs on to any of them. It never really picks up enough steam. Worse yet, the film contains several moments that even an amateur film-maker might have rethought or simply avoided. There is a scene in which Chlo Grace Moretz gets knocked down in the train station and is almost trampled by a hoard of passengers. The problem occurs when her perspective changes to a bizarre camera angle looking directly up toward the ceiling as the shoes of the mob seemingly walk flatly over a sheet of glass on top of her. My only guess is this looked way less-effective in the 2D version I was watching than it did in the 3D manner for which it was shot. The argument for selling out or not seems to end right there. There were obvious '3D moments' in the far superior Tin Tin but they never distracted from that films story.There is a lot of talk about movies in Hugo. So much so that I began to forget about the titular protagonist altogether. Scorsese injects the film with a kind of remedial silent film history that can only be meant to enthrall an adult audience with the vaguest of notions regarding these staples of TCM and film class syllabi. I don't need a full-blown documentary on the subject (though it is one of the few things Scorsese actually seems to be artistically successful at these days, especially with his George Harrison: Living in the Material World) but I kept wondering: what does this much film history have to do with Hugo's story? Hugo is not the main character of this film like he is in the source book. That's fine, but changing horses like that midstream, from orphaned boy on a quest to bitter old reclusive film-maker (Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s) feeling unloved or jilted was more jarring than the conflicting CGI environments -- especially when Hugo does very little other than going through motions to inadvertently help the old filmmaker. The film struggles to find it's center and leans too heavily toward the cause of film preservation than it should. By the end, we are beat over our heads to death with it.The truth is, I still don't know if Scorsese has become a total sell-out. I'm also not going to begin telling you how Hugo could (or should) have been a better film. I will say that had they stuck to the tone of the book (even just in spirit) it might have been a more satisfying experience. Also, there's a little gimmick used in Hugo that I picked up on after seeing a Woody Allen film once -- if a character in a film says something like: ""Happy endings only happen in the movies"" -- you can best be sure that the film you are watching is going to contain one of those same patented happy endings. If anything, Hugo's greatest contribution would seem it's an excellent primer on the well-known and highly regarded work of Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. This film really only acts as a reminder that not all artists are as consistently and vigorously celebrated as Scorsese in their own day. I doubt that I will think too much about Hugo in the future. It's already sort of subsided into that 'curious failures' trunk in my mind. Like the unnatural-looking and awkwardly conceived CGI train-wreck that occurs in Hugo's dream -- Scorsese continues his streak of pure Hollywood hokum. As long as he keeps waving his baton to the masses, the longer his orchestra will seem out of tune.",2,"should have been called: ""Georges""",1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,5917,"['favorite',

However, I was quite surprised when I began playback to discover that the two stars of ""The Dictator"" - Sacha and Ben Kingsley - were also the stars of ""Hugo""! These movies were released around the same time, and they do a marvelous job of showing just how talented these actors are. The roles they adopted could not have been more different (especially those of Kingsley), yet they pull it off with astounding aplomb. Their acting styles are polar opposites (Kingsley is emotion driven and somber; Sacha radiates an idiocy that ranges from muted to over the top), but their personalities seem to offset one another quite nicely.The imagery of ""Hugo"" is magnificent, and it really captures the imagination. The setting of Paris in the 1930s is rendered beautifully, with particular emphasis, of course, being placed on the elaborate train station where the majority of the movie takes place. While the pace can be a bit plodding at times, what slowly reveals itself is a beautiful tale of finding one's place in the world, letting go of past failures, and moving on to embrace life in the present.

Scorsese presents a great modern Dickensian novel that is set in the little world of a grand, immense 1930s Paris train station. Shot in London, where a bounty of seasoned stage actors were available, the cast includes such luminaries as Christopher Lee [Lord Of the Rings, Dark Shadows],Sir Ben Kingsley [Schindler's List, Ghandi],Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour [The History Boys], Sascha Baron Cohen [Borat, Bruno], Jude Law [Sherlock Holmes,The Grand Budapest Hotel], and Emily Mortimer [Shutter Island], all of whom weave in and out of the picture as characters in the train station, each with a story of their own that is told more in actions rather than with much unnecessary dialogue.But the invention of young Hugo Cabret, an orphaned lad who lives secretly behind the facade of the station's interior walls, maintaining the many huge clocks in a lonely and clandestine existence, brings to life the eternal myth of a lost man [Kingsley's Georges Melies] guided back into life by the hands of a child. An avid film collector and historical cinema enthusiast, Scorsese honors here the work of the late 19th-century pioneering filmmaker Melies, whose experimental creations [over 500!] were forerunners of stop-motion photography and other visual effects still used today.The winsome, exceptionally talented Butterfield is joined in Hugo's adventures by Isabelle, Melies' ward [Moretz] in an enchanting collaboration that makes you believe that Hugo and his accomplice could almost be brother and sister.Don't miss this delightful, visually stunning film which is destined to become a CLASSIC!",5,"""Shoot The Moon"" - an homage to Georges Melies",1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,2150,"['Director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'ventures', 'accustomed', 'path', 'magical', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'means', 'limited', 'appeal', 'juvenile', 'audience', 'two', 'principal', 'actors', 'ARE', 'children', '[', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', '13', '-Ender', 'Game', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', '13', '-500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Carrie', 'Kick-Ass', ']', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'real', '13-year-olds', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'heart', 'story', 'association', 'machinery', 'creativity', 'even', 'fantastical', 'clockworks', 'are', 'magical', 'magnificent', 'Scorsese', 'presents', 'great', 'modern', 'Dickensian', 'novel', 'set', 'little', 'world', 'grand', 'immense', '1930s', 'Paris', 'train', 'station', 'Shot', 'London', 'where', 'bounty', 'seasoned', 'stage', 'actors', 'were', 'available', 'cast', 'such', 'luminaries', 'Christopher', 'Lee', '[', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Dark', 'Shadows', ']', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', '[', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Ghandi', ']', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', '[', 'History', 'Boys', ']', 'Sascha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', '[', 'Borat', 'Bruno', ']', 'Jude', 'Law', '[', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Grand', 'Budapest', 'Hotel', ']', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', '[', 'Shutter', 'Island', ']', 'whom', 'weave', 'picture', 'characters', 'train', 'station', 'story', 'own', 'told', 'more', 'actions', 'rather', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'dialogue.But', 'invention', 'young', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'orphaned', 'lad', 'who', 'secretly', 'facade', 'station', 'interior', 'walls', 'maintaining', 'many', 'huge', 'clocks', 'lonely', 'clandestine', 'existence', 'life', 'eternal', 'myth', 'lost', 'man', '[', 'Kingsley', 'Georges', 'Melies', ']', 'guided', 'back', 'life', 'hands', 'child', 'avid', 'film', 'collector', 'historical', 'cinema', 'enthusiast', 'Scorsese', 'honors', 'here', 'work', 'late', '19th-century', 'pioneering', 'filmmaker', 'Melies', 'experimental', 'creations', '[', '500', ']', 'were', 'forerunners', 'stop-motion', 'photography', 'other', 'visual', 'effects', 'still', 'used', 'today.The', 'winsome', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'Butterfield', 'joined', 'Hugo', 'adventures', 'Isabelle', 'Melies', 'ward', '[', 'Moretz', ']', 'enchanting', 'collaboration', 'believe', 'Hugo', 'accomplice', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'brother', 'sister.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'delightful', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'destined', 'become', 'CLASSIC']",N/A

I didn't really know what to expect, as I wasn't familiar with the storyline.The movie was a bit slow at the beginning - setting up the scenes, the backdrop, etc. seemed to take forever and didn't engage me at all, although I was fascinated with the cinematography, which was gorgeous.  The beginning of the movie did convey a wonderful sense of realism and fantasy at the same time - a perfect balance of the two, which is not easy to achieve.  I was impressed with that, even as I was bored with the story.As the movie developed, I became more engaged and was drawn more and more into the plotline.  By the end of the movie I was fully engaged and emotionally moved.  When I look back on the movie after seeing the whole thing, I have to say that I did enjoy it.

I just think the first 15-20 minutes could have been condensed into 5 minutes.My kids (ages 9 and 11) enjoyed the movie as well.

You can 3-D-ify a movie all you want but if the story is poorly written & lugubriously delivered it matters not a whit. This movie is striking in its visual effects & yet both my husband & I fell asleep during parts of the movie. The story moves sooooo slowly & it doesn;t get interesting until the last .........15 minutes or so. It's sweet, the acting is fine, I wanted to like this as it was very highly praised by almost every reviewer I read & yet it put me to sleep. So OK it is a fantasy & some leeway can be given for silliness in such a story but you have to at least care about the characters & want to follow them into the fantasy........again this didn;t happen for me. And just when the story would appear to pick up the pace a bit & start really moving forward........more trite dialogue or a chase scene with no purpose. The history behind the early movies is fascinating but is not well served by this movie.

1374675,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003Y5H5H4,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","HUGO is a strange film. It purports to be for children despite the fact that the screenplay written by Josh Logan based of the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick has more references to words and people and events that children would not relate to on the same level as adults. It is a spectacle in the order of director Martin Scorsese with some of the most beautiful contraptions and mechanical wonders ever filmed.  It seems in many ways to be an homage to the history of filmmaking in the manner in which the rather disjointed story is presented.  Likely it comes across better in 3D than on the small flat screen.  Not that the film is without special merits: there are many moments of impressive philosophical values, child/parent relationships, and a few comedic turns.  The cast is solid if somewhat underused in this visual mechanical Parisian extravaganza spectacle, but it well worth watching as pure entertainment  - and that is really OK!The story is well known: Hugo (Asa Butterflied) is a lad whose inventor father (Jude Law) salvaged a broken automaton from a museum to fix it but dies before accomplishing that: his Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a drunk, is let in charge of the lad.  Hugo is soon left alone in the bizarre train station in Paris where he tends to the multiple clocks, misses his beloved father, and fends for himself by shoplifting food and a few `parts'. He is caught by a rather glum Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (Ben Kingsley) who runs a toy store while bemoaning his current lack of the thrill of living, despite the nurturing he receives from his wife (Helen McCrory) and his adopted daughter Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz) who longs for adventures.  In time Hugo and Isabelle become fast friends and discover the secrets held by Georges and it is through their efforts that joy and the dreams of the aged filmmaker are resurrected.There are some sidebars - an injured WW I veteran who serves as Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who dreams of the attention of the flower lady Lisette (Emily Mortimer), Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour) who sips coffee while tending her dog and attracting the attention of the hefty Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), cinema devotee and historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) who opens the doors to the mysteries that have collected during the story), and the odd Rene Tabard (Christopher Lee) who part is questionable.The cast is strong - especially the children - and the special effects are very lovely to watch.  The film takes us to the land of fantasy and it is worthwhile trip. Though the film seems to be impressed with itself and the revelation of the history of cinema, it offers many pleasures. Not sure it is a DVD to buy, though.

1374677,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B003Y5H5H4,Gryphonisle,"[8, 18]","""Hugo"" is a delightful, big and slow moving film that manages to be interesting to watch, although very little happens through much of it.  Sort of like watching the workings of a fine watch.  Like too many modern films, it's about 30 minutes too long;  gives too much to special effects over good story telling; and is hampered by inconsistent performances by its child actors, although the secondary characters somewhat make up for it with their performances, and the little stories they bring to life in the margins.The film is as much about the orphan boy Hugo, who lives within the walls of Paris' Montparnasse station in the early 1930s, and keeps the stations clocks in time, as it is about the real life film pioneer Georges Melies, who is discovered by the boy, and Isabelle (god daughter to Melies), who becomes his confidante.  As such, the audience is given a crash course in cinema history, and then treated to a glorious recreation of Melies movie studio and its sets,  as he is shown filming scenes from some of his films.  As it turns out, Melies had a rather short career, which was brought to an abrupt end by the major US and French studios, with his films melted down to make boot heels for WWI, adding yet another absurdity to mankind's most absurd war.  He ended up selling toys in a Paris train station, which is where the film finds him, and tells his story more or less as it happened.Sadly, the kids, upon whom the movie is built, can't quite carry the load they're given.  Most of the time you can practically hear them thinking ""What do I do now?  How long must I stand here? Should I smile?  Can I scratch?"".  The other problem is that the background is a combination of sets and CGI, that with the 3D glasses, creates a world that is so detailed that it manages to seem too real, and utterly fake.  One gets the sense of the film as an animated feature with real life characters (which contrasts with trailers for the upcoming ""Tintin"" movie, with animated characters that are almost lifelike).  I can not see why 3D was necessary, or how it aided the film, when good cinematography would have been just as convincing.  That it cost me $27.00 for two tickets did not impress me one whit.An idiosyncrasy of the film, a throwback to the 1960's when Americans played themselves and Brits played all the foreign language roles, is that the movie is set in Paris and yet everyone in it is British, with pronounced British accents and often strictly British characters to boot.  Only Ben Kingsley looks even vaguely ""French"".  It would be interesting to see the film dubbed in French.Still, I found the film enjoyable, fun, and romantic.  It built up a certain level of restrained suspense and maintained it throughout the film, and the scenes of Melies sets were a real treat.  I'd buy the film and I can see myself watching it over and over again, perhaps not nearly as much as other films, but it easily bears repeated viewing.",3,"A Pleasant, Interesting, and Imaginative Film",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,2954,"['Hugo', 'delightful', 'big', 'slow', 'moving', 'film', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'very', 'little', 'much', 'Sort', 'watching', 'workings', 'fine', 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'modern', 'films', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'hampered', 'inconsistent', 'performances', 'child', 'actors', 'secondary', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'make', 'up', 'performances', 'little', 'stories', 'bring', 'life', 'margins.The', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'orphan', 'boy', 'Hugo', 'who', 'walls', 'Paris', 'Montparnasse', 'station', 'early', '1930s', 'stations', 'clocks', 'time', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'pioneer', 'Georges', 'Melies', 'who', 'discovered', 'boy', 'Isabelle', 'god', 'daughter', 'Melies', 'who', 'confidante', 'such', 'audience', 'given', 'crash', 'course', 'cinema', 'history', 'then', 'treated', 'glorious', 'recreation', 'Melies', 'movie', 'studio', 'sets', 'shown', 'filming', 'scenes', 'films', 'out', 'Melies', 'had', 'rather', 'short', 'career', 'was', 'brought', 'abrupt', 'end', 'major', 'US', 'French', 'studios', 'films', 'melted', 'down', 'make', 'boot', 'heels', 'WWI', 'adding', 'yet', 'absurdity', 'mankind', 'most', 'absurd', 'war', 'ended', 'up', 'selling', 'toys', 'Paris', 'train', 'station', 'where', 'film', 'story', 'more', 'less', 'happened.Sadly', 'kids', 'whom', 'movie', 'built', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'carry', 'load', ""'re"", 'given', 'Most', 'time', 'can', 'practically', 'hear', 'thinking', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'now', 'How', 'long', 'must', 'stand', 'here', 'Should', 'smile', 'Can', 'scratch', 'other', 'problem', 'background', 'combination', 'sets', 'CGI', '3D', 'glasses', 'world', 'so', 'detailed', 'seem', 'too', 'real', 'utterly', 'fake', 'One', 'sense', 'film', 'animated', 'feature', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'trailers', 'upcoming', 'Tintin', 'movie', 'animated', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'why', '3D', 'was', 'necessary', 'how', 'aided', 'film', 'when', 'good', 'cinematography', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'convincing', 'cost', '27.00', 'two', 'tickets', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'one', 'whit.An', 'idiosyncrasy', 'film', 'throwback', '1960', 'when', 'Americans', 'played', 'Brits', 'played', 'foreign', 'language', 'roles', 'movie', 'set', 'Paris', 'yet', 'everyone', 'British', 'pronounced', 'British', 'accents', 'often', 'strictly', 'British', 'characters', 'boot', 'Only', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'even', 'vaguely', 'French', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'film', 'dubbed', 'French.Still', 'found', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'romantic', 'built', 'up', 'certain', 'level', 'restrained', 'suspense', 'maintained', 'film', 'scenes', 'Melies', 'sets', 'were', 'real', 'treat', ""'d"", 'buy', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'perhaps', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'films', 'easily', 'repeated', 'viewing']",N/A

To see a director make a film just to may some sort of a tribute to his own profession, film - making, is just not that overwhelming.

Hugo is a primeval film about machines and man at the dawn of the cinema era. I don't blame myself entirely for not curbing my apathy towards this film. It is not a bad film - it is just ordinary and hardly moving.Watch this if you don't mind watching a two hour long film based in early 20th century about an orphan.I have a sinking feeling that M.S thinks he nailed crime/drama films after THE DEPARTED and won't be making a film with that bent again.

1374684,A20ENXS6R1N2L8,B003Y5H5H4,Harold,"[0, 1]","Hugo is one of those rare children's film that doesn't treat children like, well, children. The story is far from saccharine--even if it is a tad improbable, that is the idea of adventure. And, much like this year's The Artist, it is also a love story to film that is probably lost to kids, but very clear to adults. What is also very clear in the story is the open-eyed wonder of the world with which the children approach everything. For them, all is possible and should be. And the adults, in their various ways, encourage or otherwise enable that. Scorsese manages to create a near magical sense in a story that absolutely no real magic.Chloe Moretz continues to impress me. In many ways she's already becoming an adult actor as her child roles (e.g., Kick-Ass or Let Me In) are not exactly your typical children; they're very much adults in child bodies. This role is a partial exception in that her character's outlook is a bit naive, but she is still very much her own person and taking care of herself and others.And in the titular role, Asa Butterfield looks to be an excellent choice for the upcoming Ender's Game movie. He managed a subtlety of expression not often available to young actors and was as comfortable in silence as he was talking.Some of the strengths of the film were also some of its weaknesses, which is why this wasn't quite a 5 star film for me. Over time, and re-watch, I may change my mind on that, but initially it hasn't quite cleared that bar. The dual edge is that it is a children's film through and through. Where some films of similar quality manage that and still have rich dialogue and realistic action, both the direction and dialogue left it feeling like a children's story to me. The adults were somewhat thin and over-acted. The kids weren't far from Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney putting on a show in their attitude. That doesn't quite capture what I'm trying to put my finger on here, but it is as close as I can come at the moment. And, to be fair, that doesn't make it bad, it just doesn't make it something I needed to own right right away (though I eventually gave in just for the visuals). It has neither the pure escapist magic that makes a children's movie unavoidably endearing, nor is it quite adult enough that it speaks to my inner child in a compelling way that requires me to have it on-call for bad or confusing days where I need a vacation or guidance.Interestingly, for me, was that I've experienced something of what the Kingsley role went through. In my last major move across country, 20 years of photos from my years in theatre were lost due to exhaustion and bad judgement during packing. My entire identity felt ripped away, and still does, for that aspect of my life. But even with that direct connection, his story wasn't quite central enough for me to latch in whole-heartedly.This is an extraordinary movie and will be remembered for a long time--in fact, I suspect its success will grow over time as more people discover it now that the Oscars have graced it with so many statuettes. And who know that Marty had such a soft center underneath all that darkness and violence?",4,A unique children's movie from a master,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,3148,"['Hugo', 'one', 'rare', 'children', 'film', ""n't"", 'treat', 'children', 'well', 'children', 'story', 'far', 'saccharine', 'even', 'tad', 'improbable', 'idea', 'adventure', 'much', 'year', 'Artist', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'probably', 'lost', 'kids', 'very', 'clear', 'adults', 'What', 'also', 'very', 'clear', 'story', 'open-eyed', 'wonder', 'world', 'children', 'approach', 'everything', 'possible', 'should', 'be', 'adults', 'various', 'ways', 'encourage', 'otherwise', 'enable', 'Scorsese', 'manages', 'create', 'near', 'magical', 'sense', 'story', 'absolutely', 'real', 'magic.Chloe', 'Moretz', 'impress', 'many', 'ways', 'already', 'becoming', 'adult', 'actor', 'child', 'roles', 'e.g.', 'Kick-Ass', 'Let', 'Me', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'typical', 'children', ""'re"", 'very', 'much', 'adults', 'child', 'bodies', 'role', 'partial', 'exception', 'character', 'outlook', 'bit', 'naive', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'person', 'taking', 'care', 'herself', 'others.And', 'titular', 'role', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'be', 'excellent', 'choice', 'upcoming', 'Ender', 'Game', 'movie', 'managed', 'subtlety', 'expression', 'not', 'often', 'available', 'young', 'actors', 'was', 'comfortable', 'silence', 'was', 'talking.Some', 'strengths', 'film', 'were', 'also', 'weaknesses', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', '5', 'star', 'film', 'time', 're-watch', 'may', 'change', 'mind', 'initially', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cleared', 'bar', 'dual', 'edge', 'children', 'film', 'Where', 'films', 'similar', 'quality', 'manage', 'still', 'have', 'rich', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'action', 'direction', 'dialogue', 'left', 'feeling', 'children', 'story', 'adults', 'were', 'somewhat', 'thin', 'over-acted', 'kids', 'were', ""n't"", 'far', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'putting', 'show', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'what', ""'m"", 'trying', 'put', 'finger', 'here', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'come', 'moment', 'be', 'fair', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'something', 'needed', 'own', 'right', 'right', 'away', 'eventually', 'gave', 'just', 'visuals', 'pure', 'escapist', 'magic', 'children', 'movie', 'unavoidably', 'endearing', 'quite', 'enough', 'inner', 'child', 'compelling', 'way', 'have', 'on-call', 'bad', 'confusing', 'days', 'where', 'need', 'vacation', 'guidance.Interestingly', 'was', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'something', 'what', 'Kingsley', 'role', 'went', 'last', 'major', 'move', 'country', '20', 'years', 'photos', 'years', 'theatre', 'were', 'lost', 'due', 'exhaustion', 'bad', 'judgement', 'packing', 'entire', 'identity', 'felt', 'ripped', 'away', 'still', 'aspect', 'life', 'even', 'direct', 'connection', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'central', 'enough', 'latch', 'whole-heartedly.This', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'long', 'time', 'fact', 'suspect', 'success', 'will', 'grow', 'over', 'time', 'more', 'people', 'now', 'Oscars', 'have', 'graced', 'so', 'many', 'statuettes', 'who', 'know', 'Marty', 'had', 'soft', 'center', 'darkness', 'violence']",N/A

1374687,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Y5H5H4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","- Isabelle: ""We could get into trouble.""- Hugo: ""That's how you know it's an adventure.""So if you haven't read the book - Brian Selznick's THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET - then maybe you should know up front that the film adaptation, HUGO, isn't straight-up fantasy fare like Harry Potter or the Chronicles of Narnia. Yep, there is a heightened sense of reality in that the panoramic cinematography and the fabulous set designs evoke a childlike sense of wonder. There is a fairy tale ambiance of sorts. HUGO is a fable concerning an intrepid orphan boy and a long neglected artist, care worn and bitter and resigned to fading into obscurity.His pa deaders and his hard-imbibing uncle having amscrayed for parts unknown, young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) has been living in a post World War I Parisian train station, inhabiting the walls, navigating the catwalks and catacombs and precarious steps that make up the train station's dusty inner sanctum. Hugo keeps busy by doing his uncle's work. He's been secretly tending to the clocks in the sprawling train station. In his spare time, he strives to piece together a mysterious broken-down wind-up automaton that was abandoned in a museum. Hugo believes fervently that the little metal man, when functioning properly, will reveal a message from his father. But Hugo is stumped by a missing heart-shaped key which activates the automaton. Hugo perseveres, long as there's food to filch and his father's notebook to guide him and mechanical bits to steal from the toy salesman's booth.Hugo has an affinity for machinery, a knack for fixing gadgets. This serves him well when his luck runs out as a thief and he's nabbed by old Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), him what runs the toy booth. The furious Papa Georges nevertheless indulges in an act of kindness; he takes on Hugo as a booth assistant. Around this time Hugo meets Papa Georges' niece Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), and so we're introduced to the film's best performance in my opinion. Chlo Grace Moretz radiates a warmth and great charm. Her Isabelle is captivating and inquisitive and effortlessly rolls off literary references. I love that she savors them fanciful words, words such as ""reprobate"" and ""clandestine"" and ""covert lair"" lovingly tripping from her tongue. But Isabelle is tired of living vicariously thru books; she longs for an adventure of her own. And she embarks on one with Hugo. At one point, she's heard to remark: ""This is marvelous. I feel just like Jean Valjean."" Except that she's ever more lively than good old Prisoner #24601.It's interesting. The first half of HUGO tracks our scampering orphan's escapades and the tone is very much adventurous. But somewhere in the middle bits, it seems as if director Martin Scorsese finally put his foot down and decided to go ahead with what really drew him to this project. Scorsese loves cinema, and somewhere you must've seen him espousing a cause near and dear to his heart: the preservation of old films. His passion for old movies and the salvaging of them fold into this picture. I won't say what, but there is a huge reveal somewhere in the middle bits, and the tone alters some and the spotlight sort of veers away from Hugo, even though Hugo is still the catalyst to everything that happens hence.HUGO is a film for kids, but maybe not all kids. The visuals are dazzling and enthralling and whoever came up with them should be tapped for an Oscar nomination. For those who harbor love for silent pictures or are curious about the early days of cinema, the second half of HUGO is a marvel, as only an affectionate valentine by Scorsese could be. As in the source material, HUGO shines a light on a near-forgotten pioneer of cinema, a talent who once upon a time made over 500 films until the advent of the first world war and the movie audience's shifting tastes forced him to sell his films, of which celluloid were broken down to chemicals and refashioned into the heels of women's shoes. And you wonder why this old bloke is melancholy?I've isolated Chlo Grace Moretz as my favorite performer in this film. Doesn't mean that the rest of the cast sucks asphalt. This is a terrific cast, from Butterfield to Kingsley to a fantastic Helen McCrory (who makes the most of her minimal screen time) to Christopher Lee (who lends benevolent weight as the librarian Monsieur Labisse). Even Sacha Baron Cohen restrains himself and is fine and funny as Gustave Gaston, the bum-legged Station Inspector whose mission in life - when not wooing the shy flower lady - is to corral all runaway urchins and send them packing to the orphanage. Cohen's antics and his lanky build remind me in some ways of a Keystone Kop or maybe Tony Azito who played the cowardly police sergeant in THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Some effective slapstick moments provided by Cohen... and that police dog.If immortal folks like Chaplin, Keaton, and Fairbanks evoke fond memories or some recognition, then HUGO treats you very finely. Location-wise, this is as idealized a version of Paris as you and I can hope to see. The automaton is a steampunkish concoction of gears and coils and springs and thingamajigs, and, early on, is what drives the narrative, piques our curiosity. The kid actors contribute mature performances. And because this is the kind of film that delivers the goods, chances are solid that, by the closing moments, our forgotten filmmaking pioneer will take taken his bows, remembered once more. HUGO isn't fantasy in the mold of Harry Potter and such. But Scorsese introduces an enchantment of sorts, one somewhat anchored in reality. But I've always considered Scorsese magical, even when his subject matter is scurrilous mafiosos (which by the way sounds like a nasty medical condition). Scorsese again demonstrates his great craft. To lift from Hugo Cabret's vocabulary, Scorsese is like... clockwork.",4,"""This is marvelous.

Snyder,"[0, 0]","Hugo is the fictional story of an orphan (Asa Butterfield) who hides among the massive clocks of the Montparnasse Railway Station in Paris of the 1930s. In a corner of that station there is an obscure man who was once famous, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley), an actual historical figure, a magician who became a filmmaker in the 1890s. But by the 1930s he is a forgotten man, running a small toy store. Director Martin Scorsese, a movie history buff, uses Hugo's journey of discovery to entertain and enlighten us with a story that includes one of the earliest and most significant pioneers of the motion picture industry.Hugo Cabret is obsessed with an antique automaton, a clockwork robot of the sort popular in the 1800s, many of which were capable of performing amazing feats. Hugo wants to restore it to working order, a project he had been engaged in with his late father. He needs mechanical parts, and to get them he steals toys from Melies' store. Caught in the act, he is put to work in the store, and eventually meets the storekeeper's goddaughter, a girl about his own age. She provides the vital part to restore the automaton, and it begins to draw a picture. It creates the most famous image from Melies' silent movies, the face of the Man in the Moon. And so begins the children's discovery of the surprising world of the earliest films.The story often evokes a subtle dreamlike state, intentionally blurring the line between the dream sequences and those which depict reality. Scorsese skillfully weaves several plot threads, almost all confined within the walls of the railway station. Aside from the threads devoted to Hugo and Melies, foremost among these is that of the war-crippled Station Inspector, the bane of orphans or runaways who might seek shelter in the station. He is wonderfully portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen.This movie combines the best of modern film technology with a moving story about a time when the beginning of motion pictures was still in living memory. It will be enjoyed by most, from pre-teenagers on up. You won't board a train, but for two hours you will make a journey of discovery with Hugo in the Montparnasse Railway Station.",5,Hugo and the Magic of the Movies,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2174,"['Hugo', 'fictional', 'story', 'orphan', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'who', 'massive', 'clocks', 'Montparnasse', 'Railway', 'Station', 'Paris', '1930s', 'corner', 'station', 'obscure', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'famous', 'Georges', 'Melies', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'actual', 'historical', 'figure', 'magician', 'who', 'became', 'filmmaker', '1890s', '1930s', 'forgotten', 'man', 'running', 'small', 'toy', 'store', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'movie', 'history', 'buff', 'Hugo', 'journey', 'discovery', 'entertain', 'enlighten', 'story', 'one', 'earliest', 'most', 'significant', 'pioneers', 'motion', 'picture', 'industry.Hugo', 'Cabret', 'obsessed', 'antique', 'automaton', 'clockwork', 'robot', 'sort', 'popular', '1800s', 'many', 'were', 'capable', 'performing', 'amazing', 'feats', 'Hugo', 'restore', 'working', 'order', 'project', 'had', 'been', 'engaged', 'late', 'father', 'mechanical', 'parts', 'get', 'toys', 'Melies', 'store', 'Caught', 'act', 'put', 'work', 'store', 'eventually', 'storekeeper', 'goddaughter', 'girl', 'own', 'age', 'vital', 'part', 'restore', 'automaton', 'draw', 'picture', 'most', 'famous', 'image', 'Melies', 'silent', 'movies', 'face', 'Man', 'Moon', 'so', 'children', 'discovery', 'surprising', 'world', 'earliest', 'films.The', 'story', 'often', 'subtle', 'dreamlike', 'state', 'intentionally', 'blurring', 'line', 'dream', 'sequences', 'depict', 'reality', 'Scorsese', 'skillfully', 'several', 'plot', 'threads', 'almost', 'confined', 'walls', 'railway', 'station', 'Aside', 'threads', 'devoted', 'Hugo', 'Melies', 'foremost', 'war-crippled', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'bane', 'orphans', 'runaways', 'who', 'might', 'seek', 'shelter', 'station', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen.This', 'movie', 'best', 'modern', 'film', 'technology', 'moving', 'story', 'time', 'when', 'beginning', 'motion', 'pictures', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'memory', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'pre-teenagers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'board', 'train', 'two', 'hours', 'will', 'make', 'journey', 'discovery', 'Hugo', 'Montparnasse', 'Railway', 'Station']",N/A

I had heard that it was the story of a boy's fascination with movies and the film certainly takes its time getting to that part of the story.HUGO seemed painfully slow moving for the first 15 minutes as we see images of young Hugo's life in a train station in Paris. There is almost no dialogue in those 15 minutes and finally the title HUGO fills the screen.It didn't feel like an exciting story but finally we got to the story of Hugo and his relationship with his father and the ""automaton"" they are working to repair. An automaton is a robot-like figure with intrique workings and this one looks like his function is to write something. Tragedy strikes and Hugo ends up living behind the clocks in the train station. Hugo spends his days making sure the clocks in the station are running, stealing food to survive and stealing the parts he needs to repair the automaton. He's always one step away from being caught by the station inspector and sent to an orphanage.Hugo is wonderfully played by Asa Butterfield. At times Hugo seems to be a small child and at other times much older than he really is. Asa is totally charming and delightful and the orphaned Hugo.Hugo's life changes when he has a run in with Georges, the seeimingly-unplesant owner of the station toy store. Georges's goddaughter befriends Hugo and finally the adventure of the store begins. It's very far into the story before the fascination with motion picture begins. We eventually learn Georges identity and his history and his connection to the automaton. The story is contrived but somehow it works and we become involved in the silent era of motion pictures.HUGO is a visual feast of a magical world of clocks and mechanical devices. The train station setting is a appealing and we have a superb cast of characters. We get insight into their characters and begin to see why some have become broken and disheartened in life.

All I gained from the reviews was that it was about a boy and his father building an automaton (robot),... and yet, it was also about a passion for movies. I was like,... ""huh"". After seeing the film, I can tell you that it is an historical fiction piece. The primary story is that of one of the first film makers. His was not the first film made, but I believe he was the first to make an actual ""motion picture"" with a story, and the first SciFi film. Georges Melies was a French illusionist who found that film was a great medium with which he could create wonderous illusions. He was a prolific inventor and created many autotronic or robotic devices, built innovative cameras, and was perhaps the first cinematographer to use special effects of any sort. One of his best known films was ""A Trip to the Moon"", a true classic, well known to any student of film. This is the historical part of the film (this information is not all totally in the film but was included here for reader/filmgoer insight).The fictional part of the film takes place in France, a bit later, sometime in the 1920's and revolves around the boy, Hugo, whom happens upon Mr. Melies quite by mistake as he is trying to ""revive"" an automaton which he and his now deceased father had been working on. The film is both entertaining and educational - paying homeage to perhaps the first great film producer - and overall well done, with excellent acting by Ben Kingsley as Georges Melies, Asa Butterfield as Hugo, Chloe Moretz as Hugo's friend Isabella... and a not un-humourous role of station inspector by Sasha Cohen. I like to break movies down to their elements and examine each closely, but I also get an overall feel from a film when I walk away from it. My overall feel was a thumbs up five star rating... each item broken down warrents five stars as well,... humor, acting, story, set design, costume design, cinematography......

Chlo Grace Moretz steals the show as Isabelle.  She's already a heartbreaker at 14.  But, this is ostensibly Hugo's film, so we see it through his eyes, hiding up in the steel trusses of Paris' grand train station, where he tries to reassemble the missing pieces of an automaton left behind by his departed father.The story takes a number of complicated turns with Sacha Baron Cohen providing comic relief as the station inspector, ever vigilante of vagabond kids.  Ben Kingsley plays the noble Georges Melies, reduced to selling mechanical contraptions at a little kiosk.  Scorsese brings Hugo and Georges together through Melies' niece, Isabelle, resulting in a beautiful tribute to early French cinema, ultimately leading to the resurrection of Melies' masterpiece,A Trip to the Moon.

Foster ""movie lover""","[0, 1]","Martin Scorsese's paean to the pioneers of the motion picture industry and his message championing film preservation is a true masterpiece not to be missed by true lovers of the cinema.  Perfectly cast, Hugo represents storytelling at its very best, and I found myself thrice drawn back to the theatre to witness his spectacular foray into 3-D.  It was by far the finest presentation in that process these eyes have ever beheld.  This lifetime movie fan is at a loss to name a film in recent memory that he enjoyed more than Hugo, and I hastened to pre-order my DVD copy after watching it for the first time.Deservedly, Hugo received eleven Academy Award nominations.  Undeservedly, it failed to capture the Best Picture Oscar, The Artist winning instead.  Evidently, many Academy voters had never before seen a silent motion picture, and felt that moviemaking techniques abandoned in 1928 with the advent of sound to be revolutionary today.Of course, some modern moviegoers found Hugo not to their liking, having been weaned on glitzy special effects, car chases, splatter, and street language.  They considered it boring.  Used to be that a good story was all that was necessary to fill theatre seats, but, and sadly, no more.  But I am among those who still demand that of a motion picture, and can only say well done, Martin Scorsese; well done Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, and yes, you too, Sacha Baron Cohen.

Gilligan ""Overeducated culture vulture""","[2, 3]","The themes that Martin Scorsese addresses in this film--the thin line between self-recrimination and nostalgia, the effects of advancing technology on thriving art forms, and the lasting effects of a father's love--would seem misguided in a typical children's film. ""Hugo,"" however, a children's film directed by Scorsese--one of the greatest American film directors of all time (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Departed"")--is no typical children's film. Scorsese has made a children's film for adults who still experience the joys, wonders, mysteries, and painful epiphanies of childhood.First of all, the ""exotic"" setting of a 1930s Parisian train station establishes the wistful tone. The film is beautiful to behold--the colors, the cinematography, the set design, and the art direction are all stunningly beautiful. The plot itself focuses on the titular hero, a young boy who lives in the rafters and bowels of the station and spends his time adjusting the station's numerous clocks, evading the menacing pursuit of the Station Inspector (played by an appropriately surly Sacha Baron Cohen), and searching for parts that animate the automaton left to him by his dead father (played by Jude Law in an unfortunately brief appearance). Through the course of his quest, Hugo encounters an elderly shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley in another masterful performance), the shopkeeper's god-daughter, and a film historian. Through these connections, Hugo begins to piece together not only the mystery of the automaton but also the impact of the beginnings of cinema as an art form.The film is sumptuous, the plot is charming, the actors are magnificent--yet somehow the film amounts to far less than the sum of its parts. I found myself bored at many points during the film--the story seems to linger a bit too much, allowing the viewer to appreciate (almost excessively so) the aesthetic and nostalgic beauty of the film.

When I was browsing through the customer reviews on Amazon here it's the first thing I noticed.  There are a lot of 5 star reviews, and a lot of 1 star reviews.  How is that possible?  How could so many people watch the same movie and have such a different view of the it?  Well, I'm sure it's a combination of alot of things, namely it's not some mindless movie that you can plop yourself or your kids in front of and just take it in and not have to think, rather it's a movie that will cause you to think and appreciate the artistry of cinema.I love this movie!  It's one of the few I've seen in a long time, that when it was over I thought I need to see this again.  The movie has a lot of things going for it:Story:  The movie is an adaptation of the book by Brian Selznick, who funny enough is known more as an illustrator than a writer but his book ""THe Invention of Hugo Cabret"" is the book the movie is based on. The book published in 2007 won the Caldecott Award that year, the first novel to ever win the award.  If you read the book you knew that this was going to be a movie, and you were excited to see it knowing that it would not disappoint.What makes the story so good is that it tells a great story about the history of movies, and if you love movies then you will love this movie just for the story!Characters:  The characters in the movie are wonderful.  The movie has some notable supporting characters namely Christopher Lee(Count Dooku).  The movie has some amazing actors that really surprised me.  One being Sacha Baron Cohen, who I can't help but only see as Borat until this movie.  He truely is a good actor and I hope he will take on roles like this in the future.  Ben Kingsley has been in many movies and has always been a good actor among many in a great cast, this movie is no different. He is excellent in his role, but he's out shined by the children.  One is Chlo Grace Moretz, I first saw her in ""Diary of a Whimpy Kid"" and she was great, but recently she has done several other great films.  This girl is only 15 years old!  I look for many amazing roles for her in the future.  THe young man that plays Hugo is a relatively unknown actor named Asa Butterfield.  He reminded me a lot of the young man in the most recent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Production:  The imagery in this movie with the gears and clocks is awesome! While this seems an unlikely movie for Martin Scorsese to direct I remember that he is a master storyteller that needs and loves good stories to tell, Hugo by that criteria is a no-brainer.I loved this movie so much, and I wish everyone would watch it.  One interesting personal tidbit when I saw the movie and they referred back to the old historical movie ""To the Moon"" I kept thinking about the music video from the 1990s by Smashing Pumpkins, ""Tonight Tonight""  They recreated the film in their video, and for all the generation X'rs like myself this was my frame of reference for most of the movie.

It's no wonder the orphan boy charged with these marvels sees the world as a giant clockwork; his entire life centers around oil cans, counterweights, gears, flywheels, and mainsprings.Director (and Film Historian) Martin Scorsese (""The Departed"") brings us this wonderful cast:* Asa Butterfield (""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"") is our eponymous hero, striving to unlock the mystery of his father's death. He lives in the walls of the train station, stealing what he needs and living by his wits. He is apprenticed to his drunken uncle, thus he works on the clocks.* Jude Law (""Sherlock Holmes"") appears briefly as our hero's all-too-soon-dead father, but he was working on an automaton, which Hugo now sees as something he absolutely must complete.* Ben Kingsley (""Shutter Island"") is Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, the center- piece of this tribute to early French cinema. A magician turned cinematographer in 1895, this innovative pioneer was very nearly forgotten despite his almost 500 films made prior to WWI. This homage includes a moment when he is belatedly honored for his contributions.* Chlo Grace Moretz (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") is a girl who joins our young hero on an ""adventure!"" Her first taste of the cinema is the well-known clip of Harold Lloyd hanging from the face of that clock. This film is checkered with many such classics.* Helen McCrory (""The Queen"") is Jeanne M&eacute;li&egrave;s, wife of Georges. This actress was so convincing as an older woman, I was impressed by her makeup when she appeared younger. Silly me!* Emil Lager (""Cheerful Weather for the Wedding"") fooled us all. We thought he was Johnny Depp, doing a surprise cameo as a guitar player in the train station!* Sasha Baron Cohen (""Br&uuml;no"") is the gendarme determined to catch our boy and send him to an orphanage. Well, catch him he does!* Emily Mortimer (""Our Idiot Brother"") is a sweet flower vendor in the station. The gendarme gets tongue-tied around her.* Christopher Lee (""Season of the Witch"") is a librarian who directs our youngsters to books on topics they are researching.We were pleased to see the emphasis placed on the value of books. Courtesy of excellent 3D, we cringe from a horrific train wreck and struggle with the children as they try to push through a crowded train station. We revel in the discovery and restoration of many of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' well-known film clips and marvel at his ingenuity.This is an excellent film for film buffs, not for children and I'm sure Amazon.com will notify me as soon as it's available.",4,A Clockwork World,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,3355,"['NOT', 'repeat', 'NOT', 'children', 'movie', 'must', 'emphasize', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'misled', 'PG', 'rating', 'children', 'book', 'based', 'upon', 'been', 'fundamentally', 'changed', 'wonderful', 'heart-felt', 'visual', 'feast', 'dedicated', 'cinephiles', 'everywhere', 'Movie', 'lovers', 'are', 'rapturous', 'children', 'brought', 'along', 'well-meaning', 'parents', 'are', 'bewildered', 'bored.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'magnificent', 'deeply', 'dimensional', '3D', 'shot', 'massive', 'clockworks', 'traffic', 'headlights', 'encircling', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'aerial', 'view', '1930s', 'Paris', 'moment', 'knew', 'was', 'hands', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'are', 'scenes', 'walls', 'attic', 'huge', 'Parisian', 'train', 'station', 'where', 'see', 'how', 'maintain', 'clocks', 'oiling', 'winding', 'repairing', 'fine-tuning', 'wonder', 'orphan', 'boy', 'charged', 'marvels', 'world', 'giant', 'clockwork', 'entire', 'life', 'centers', 'oil', 'cans', 'counterweights', 'gears', 'flywheels', 'mainsprings.Director', 'Film', 'Historian', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Departed', 'wonderful', 'cast', '*', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'eponymous', 'hero', 'striving', 'unlock', 'mystery', 'father', 'death', 'walls', 'train', 'station', 'stealing', 'what', 'living', 'wits', 'apprenticed', 'drunken', 'uncle', 'thus', 'clocks', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'briefly', 'hero', 'all-too-soon-dead', 'father', 'was', 'working', 'automaton', 'Hugo', 'now', 'something', 'absolutely', 'must', 'complete', '*', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'center-', 'piece', 'tribute', 'early', 'French', 'cinema', 'magician', 'turned', 'cinematographer', '1895', 'innovative', 'pioneer', 'was', 'very', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'almost', '500', 'films', 'made', 'prior', 'WWI', 'homage', 'moment', 'when', 'belatedly', 'honored', 'contributions', '*', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'girl', 'who', 'young', 'hero', 'adventure', 'first', 'taste', 'cinema', 'well-known', 'clip', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'hanging', 'face', 'clock', 'film', 'checkered', 'many', 'such', 'classics', '*', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Queen', 'Jeanne', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'wife', 'Georges', 'actress', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'older', 'woman', 'was', 'impressed', 'makeup', 'when', 'appeared', 'younger', 'Silly', '*', 'Emil', 'Lager', 'Cheerful', 'Weather', 'Wedding', 'fooled', 'thought', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'doing', 'surprise', 'cameo', 'guitar', 'player', 'train', 'station', '*', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Br', 'uuml', 'gendarme', 'determined', 'catch', 'boy', 'send', 'orphanage', 'Well', 'catch', '*', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'sweet', 'flower', 'vendor', 'station', 'gendarme', 'tongue-tied', '*', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Season', 'Witch', 'librarian', 'who', 'youngsters', 'books', 'topics', 'are', 'researching.We', 'were', 'pleased', 'see', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'value', 'books', 'Courtesy', 'excellent', '3D', 'cringe', 'horrific', 'train', 'wreck', 'struggle', 'children', 'try', 'push', 'crowded', 'train', 'station', 'revel', 'discovery', 'restoration', 'many', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'well-known', 'film', 'clips', 'marvel', 'ingenuity.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'film', 'buffs', 'not', 'children', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Amazon.com', 'will', 'notify', 'as', 'soon', 'available']",N/A

I expected a fantasy story about a young orphan in Paris, with floating robots and mystery trains. Instead, I got a rather pedestrian tale about the orphan with little of the fantasy. Indeed - spoilers ahead! - the film became a biography of early cinematographer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, he of ""Voyager to the Moon"" fame. As sad as was the life of poor orphan Hugo, forced to wind clocks in the Montparnasse train station, the story of M&eacute;li&egrave;s (played by Ben Kingsley) was a much more compelling and could have been a film in itself. The Hugo material was too skimpy, making this part of the film tiresome. A couple of love stories between train station regulars might have made the film more bearable. As would a btter eye for comedy. I knew we were in trouble when an early scene, in which a character catches a leg brace in a train door, fell comedically flat. And Sacha Baron Cohen, as a brutal yet lovesick gendarme, was completely misdirected. His character was not given any motivation or his foul temper - the audience was left to imagine a war wound as the likely cause.I will say that Scorcese did a nice job of evoking 1920s Paris fashions, signage and technology. The train station was truly a bustling place full of thousands of stories every time a train arrived or departed. The Paris scenes were mostly done as matte paintings, and lacked realism. That might or might not be your cup of tea.""Hugo"" is a huge waste of money, except that it will bring more attention to M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his enormous output of wonderful early films.

1374731,A2T338D7CN0BQL,B003Y5H5H4,J.,"[4, 16]","When I saw the trailer for Hugo I was unmoved. I had heard that Scorsese was working on a mysterious project called ""Hugo Cabret"" and that it was a ""cubistic"" 3D film set in Paris in the early 20th century. Sounds cool. Well, the ""Cabret"" had been dropped for the more family-friendly, if not moronic sounding, ""Hugo""-- The new Pixar film about a baby Hippopotamus? Nope, but could be. Watching the trailer, I waited to be interested in something, anything, but it never came. The child star in the lead looked more suited to texting in the back of his parents luxury SUV than playing a 1930's waif. And don't tell me it can't be done: Charlie Korsmo (remember him?) actually looked like a kid from the 30's in Dick Tracy. There are just types more suited than others for certain things, but hindsight is 20/20, and Asa Butterfield was cast. Something about a creepy robot and a key and it all looked rather uninteresting from the trailer and I sort of wrote it off for what it was.Then when it came to theaters and people were raving, I had an afternoon free and I had never seen a 3D film in the theater yet, so I decided to give it a chance. Was my original impression from the trailer correct or wrong? Was it in fact a fabulous film that somehow just didn't translate to the truncated trailer form? Oh how I wish. Instead I was subjected to a 2 hour ride in a dentist chair. Asa Butterfield did exhibit some waif traits that were not apparent in the trailer, I'll give it that. But any real filmmaking qualities were quickly swallowed up by the synthetic CGI and 3D experience. The 3D was cool for awhile, but then it just became a distraction: little floating dust particles in the air, lots of scenes with snow; as with CGI, 3D just seems another distraction for the filmmakers who should be worried about making a good movie, not adding little digital bits here, there, and everywhere.And what are real filmmaking qualities? Well,let's start with the waif. The film inched oh so desperately toward entertaining when Sasha Baron Cohen started putting orphans into cages, but then it fell back exhausted to more floating dustparticles, animated clockworks, and snow. Remember the 70's? Does Martin Scorsese? Before CGI a director would have jumped all over orphans in cages and made it a centerpiece to the film. Now it's just an afterthought to frantic, frenetic CGI fakeness. CGI seems to effect the actors too, imbuing them by its proximity with a fakeness as well (anybody see The Phantom Menace?). And I did guffaw when Marty tried to add some genuine Scorsese passion with Hugo's emotional speech where he becomes so impassioned he strikes a period leather upholstered chair. Again, these attempts at making a real movie amid such digital kiddy games were just pathetic at best, laughable and sad at worst.Speaking of kiddy games, I suppose something should be said about Hugo's source material: it's based on a young adult's book aimed at the Harry Potter phenomenon. People who think this is ""Scorsese's love-letter to cinema"" are deluded.

The movie is basically a high quality overly long infomercial for film preservation.  And I was annoyed that it did not have any driving singular narrative.  Additionally, I thought the script was haphazard while trying to be mysterious but with a perpetual overwhelming boredom.  Ben Kingsley is still trying to prove that he's not Gandhi by playing another unlikeable character; and I found his motivation for his bitterness to be thoroughly unbelievable.  (Ben Kingsley is now officially the 'kiss of death' for any movie, for me.  I refuse to see any more of his films).  I do like movies that star kids (The Others; Neverland; The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas; Charlie & The Chocolate Factory; The City Of Lost Children; etc), but I do not like this one.  The fantasy genre is not in Scorecese's wheelhouse.  This should have been more in the realm of Alice In Wonderland, Harry Potter, or any Terry Gilliam film.  Scorcese is not the director for that kind of movie... and this is painfully evident by the stilted characters, bland dialogue, and uneventful meandering that goes on throughout.  Sacha Baron Cohen is the one highlight of the movie.  He seems to be the only one who understood what was going on and how to approach the movie.  The 3D is admittedly well done, but does not make up for the sloppy editing, the poor scripting, the lackluster directing, or the contrived plodding plotting.  How this movie was even nominated for Oscars is due only to the CGI and 3D effects.  I had great hopes for this movie.  They were exceedingly dashed to the ground, and I was more annoyed than I should have been, only because the movie had so much potential to be so much better.

1374741,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B003Y5H5H4,John Kwok,"[26, 34]","Martin Scorsese offers audiences a film absolutely like none of his others, a truly heart-felt valentine to the early history of cinema and of a young boy's indefatigable search for a hidden message from his deceased father in 1920s Paris; ""Hugo"", based on Brian Selznick's bestselling children's tale ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". It is Scorsese's most personal, and most poignant, film, and is certainly among those destined to be remembered as his finest in long, quite distinguished, star-studded cinematic career. Working with a talented team of actors led by Sir Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee, and a technical crew led by visual effects guru Rob Legato (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" and ""Avatar"") and film composer Howard Shore (""The Lord of The Rings""), Scorsese has rendered a cinematic vision of Paris as vividly magical as the futuristic worlds of ""Star Trek"" or the fantasy realm of ""Middle Earth""; a vision that is still most apt even in the two-dimensional version that I saw recently.The young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) runs afoul of toy store owner Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s  (Ben Kingsley) in the main Parisian railroad station, as he tries repairing an automaton found by his late father (played with utmost warmth and sincerity by Jude Law), believing it may disclose his father's hidden message. Winning the sympathy and friendship of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' goddaughter Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), and Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee), the train station's book seller, young Hugo soon makes an electrifying discovery of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' almost forgotten past as one of the world's greatest film directors in the early infancy of cinema. Moretz's warm, radiant, performance nearly steals every scene she is in, though there are great performances too from Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Michael Stuhlbarg (as the fictional film historian Rene Tabard), Helen McCrory (as M&eacute;li&egrave;s' wife Mama Jeanne), Emily Mortimer (Lisette, the train station's flower shop owner) and Sacha Baron Cohen (as the World War I-injured Station Inspector, with whom Hugo has problems with too). This is an emotionally riveting tearjerker of a film that will leave audiences spellbound, especially pre-adolescent children and adults; whose visual and musical styles are more similar to Hollywood classics from the 1930s and early 1940s than any contemporary family-oriented film in recent memory.",5,One of the Finest Family-Oriented Pictures in Recent Memory from a most unlikely source,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,2465,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'offers', 'audiences', 'film', 'absolutely', 'none', 'others', 'truly', 'heart-felt', 'valentine', 'early', 'history', 'cinema', 'young', 'boy', 'indefatigable', 'search', 'hidden', 'message', 'deceased', 'father', '1920s', 'Paris', 'Hugo', 'based', 'Brian', 'Selznick', 'bestselling', 'children', 'tale', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Scorsese', 'most', 'personal', 'most', 'poignant', 'film', 'certainly', 'destined', 'be', 'remembered', 'finest', 'long', 'quite', 'distinguished', 'star-studded', 'cinematic', 'career', 'Working', 'talented', 'team', 'actors', 'led', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'technical', 'crew', 'led', 'visual', 'effects', 'guru', 'Rob', 'Legato', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Avatar', 'film', 'composer', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Scorsese', 'rendered', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'Paris', 'vividly', 'magical', 'futuristic', 'worlds', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fantasy', 'realm', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'vision', 'still', 'most', 'apt', 'even', 'two-dimensional', 'version', 'saw', 'recently.The', 'young', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'afoul', 'toy', 'store', 'owner', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'main', 'Parisian', 'railroad', 'station', 'repairing', 'automaton', 'found', 'late', 'father', 'played', 'utmost', 'warmth', 'sincerity', 'Jude', 'Law', 'believing', 'may', 'disclose', 'father', 'hidden', 'message', 'Winning', 'sympathy', 'friendship', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'goddaughter', 'Isabelle', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Monsieur', 'Labisse', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'train', 'station', 'book', 'seller', 'young', 'Hugo', 'soon', 'electrifying', 'discovery', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'past', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'film', 'directors', 'early', 'infancy', 'cinema', 'Moretz', 'warm', 'radiant', 'performance', 'nearly', 'steals', 'scene', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'too', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Michael', 'Stuhlbarg', 'fictional', 'film', 'historian', 'Rene', 'Tabard', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'wife', 'Mama', 'Jeanne', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Lisette', 'train', 'station', 'flower', 'shop', 'owner', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'World', 'War', 'I-injured', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'whom', 'Hugo', 'problems', 'too', 'emotionally', 'riveting', 'tearjerker', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'audiences', 'spellbound', 'especially', 'pre-adolescent', 'children', 'adults', 'visual', 'musical', 'styles', 'are', 'more', 'similar', 'Hollywood', 'classics', '1930s', 'early', '1940s', 'contemporary', 'family-oriented', 'film', 'recent', 'memory']",N/A

1374747,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B003Y5H5H4,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 5]","HUGO begins from a high altitude perspective over Paris. After centering on a long-distance view of Montparnasse railway station, the lens zooms-in over the city's streets and rooftops, enters the station from the track side, swoops along a platform between two trains and among scurrying travelers, comes into the station's arrivals and departures hall, and finally comes to a stop in a close-up of a set of young eyes peering out from behind a large clock set high on the concourse wall. The alluring imagery of the film is immediate.Date stamped by one particular real event that takes place late in the plot, the year is no later than 1929, though an on-line summary of the movie places it in the early 1930s. Never mind, it's pretty much irrelevant to an appreciation of this bravura production.The story centers on the 12-year old orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, after a lifetime of familial misfortune, alone maintains the huge station's clocks while living inside the building's forgotten infrastructure. His presence has gone unsuspected by Station Inspector Gustav (Sacha Baron Cohen), a bitter and pitiless wounded war veteran who walks with the aid of a dodgy leg brace, and who dedicates his time-on-duty apprehending - with the aid of a big, black Doberman - parentless children wandering the great terminus and packing them off to an orphanage. Hugo's secret existence is precarious as he steals food from the Montparnasse's food vendors and tools and small gears from the owner (Ben Kingsley) of a toy repair booth located within the station. Young Cabret uses the stolen items from the repair shop to attempt to fix a non-functioning automaton from his deceased father's former clock shop. Once again operable, Hugo hopes the mechanical figure will do ... well, something ... that may somehow prove to be a message from his Dear But Dead Ol' Dad.HUGO is Martin Scorcese's tribute to the ground-breaking French illusionist-turned-film maker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who, between 1896 and 1913, directed - and often stared in - some 531 short (1-40 minute) silent films, most of which have since been lost. Georges himself, I suspect, is virtually unknown by most of the public except a knowledgeable few in the film industry, though any one may have seen, at some point in life, a scene from his film ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" (""A Trip to the Moon""), that of a canon-fired spaceship hitting a humanized Moon in the right eye.The visual presentation of HUGO is positively magical, especially as rendered in the 3-D format. Unusual camera perspectives linger lovingly on moving gears and machine parts, clock pendulums, abandoned labyrinthine spaces (within the Montparnasse infrastructure), as well as the chaotic and crowded ambiance of the station's public areas.Students of film will appreciate the significant inclusion of rescued, archival footage from M&eacute;li&egrave;s's silents.HUGO was the first of a cinematic doubleheader attended by my wife and I on Christmas Day, the second being the latest Mission Improbable episode, GHOST PROTOCOL. As gripping an action film as the latter is, I wouldn't bother to attend it again or review it. HUGO, however, I would see once more (at least) just for the utter delight it brought me - that same delight a child experiences on first gazing upon a fireworks display, or first holding a puppy, or perhaps first eating an ice cream. A delight that comes less often as we age. It's the purest reason for seeing any moving picture show, and the reason for their making that M&eacute;li&egrave;s understood and Scorcese understands.",5,"Enthralling, charming and, yes, even informative",1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,3609,"['HUGO', 'high', 'altitude', 'perspective', 'Paris', 'centering', 'long-distance', 'view', 'Montparnasse', 'railway', 'station', 'lens', 'zooms-in', 'city', 'streets', 'rooftops', 'station', 'track', 'side', 'platform', 'two', 'trains', 'scurrying', 'travelers', 'station', 'arrivals', 'departures', 'hall', 'finally', 'stop', 'close-up', 'set', 'young', 'eyes', 'peering', 'out', 'large', 'clock', 'set', 'high', 'concourse', 'wall', 'alluring', 'imagery', 'film', 'immediate.Date', 'stamped', 'one', 'particular', 'real', 'event', 'place', 'late', 'plot', 'year', 'later', '1929', 'on-line', 'summary', 'movie', 'early', '1930s', 'Never', 'mind', 'pretty', 'much', 'irrelevant', 'appreciation', 'bravura', 'story', 'centers', '12-year', 'old', 'orphan', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'who', 'lifetime', 'familial', 'misfortune', 'alone', 'huge', 'station', 'clocks', 'living', 'building', 'forgotten', 'infrastructure', 'presence', 'gone', 'unsuspected', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'Gustav', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'bitter', 'pitiless', 'wounded', 'war', 'veteran', 'who', 'aid', 'dodgy', 'leg', 'brace', 'who', 'time-on-duty', 'apprehending', 'aid', 'big', 'black', 'Doberman', 'parentless', 'children', 'wandering', 'great', 'terminus', 'packing', 'off', 'orphanage', 'Hugo', 'secret', 'existence', 'precarious', 'food', 'Montparnasse', 'food', 'vendors', 'tools', 'small', 'gears', 'owner', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'toy', 'repair', 'located', 'station', 'Young', 'Cabret', 'stolen', 'items', 'repair', 'shop', 'attempt', 'fix', 'non-functioning', 'automaton', 'deceased', 'father', 'former', 'clock', 'shop', 'Once', 'again', 'operable', 'Hugo', 'mechanical', 'figure', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'something', 'may', 'somehow', 'prove', 'be', 'message', 'Dear', 'Dead', 'Ol', 'Dad.HUGO', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'tribute', 'ground-breaking', 'French', 'illusionist-turned-film', 'maker', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'who', '1896', '1913', 'directed', 'often', 'stared', '531', 'short', '1-40', 'minute', 'silent', 'films', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'suspect', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'most', 'public', 'knowledgeable', 'few', 'film', 'industry', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'point', 'life', 'scene', 'film', 'Le', 'Voyage', 'la', 'Lune', 'Trip', 'Moon', 'canon-fired', 'spaceship', 'hitting', 'humanized', 'Moon', 'right', 'eye.The', 'visual', 'presentation', 'HUGO', 'positively', 'magical', 'especially', 'rendered', '3-D', 'format', 'Unusual', 'camera', 'linger', 'lovingly', 'moving', 'gears', 'machine', 'parts', 'clock', 'pendulums', 'abandoned', 'labyrinthine', 'spaces', 'Montparnasse', 'infrastructure', 'as', 'well', 'chaotic', 'crowded', 'ambiance', 'station', 'public', 'areas.Students', 'film', 'will', 'appreciate', 'significant', 'inclusion', 'rescued', 'archival', 'footage', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'silents.HUGO', 'was', 'first', 'cinematic', 'doubleheader', 'attended', 'wife', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'second', 'being', 'latest', 'Mission', 'Improbable', 'episode', 'GHOST', 'PROTOCOL', 'gripping', 'action', 'film', 'latter', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'attend', 'again', 'review', 'HUGO', 'however', 'would', 'see', 'once', 'more', 'least', 'just', 'utter', 'delight', 'brought', 'same', 'delight', 'child', 'experiences', 'first', 'gazing', 'fireworks', 'display', 'first', 'holding', 'puppy', 'perhaps', 'first', 'eating', 'ice', 'cream', 'delight', 'less', 'often', 'age', 'purest', 'reason', 'seeing', 'moving', 'picture', 'show', 'reason', 'making', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'understood', 'Scorcese', 'understands']",N/A

1374751,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003Y5H5H4,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[27, 33]","Hugo, the latest film from cinematic maestro Martin Scorsese, is both his first film geared for families and his first film shot in 3D. While many noteworthy directors have been weary of the new format, some greats have embraced it and been eager to try it. James Cameron, not the inventor of 3D but certainly a recent innovator, upon seeing Hugo, called it the best use of 3D he'd seen. No matter what your thoughts on 3D may be, this is no small feat coming from this man. The film, based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick and with a screenplay by John Logan, who also penned Scorsese's The Aviator, Hugo is largely billed as a family film but it's worth noting that the film's biggest fans will probably be adults, although there's enough whimsical fantasy to tug at the heartstrings of even the most jaded child.Hugo largely takes place in the early 1930s at a Paris railway station. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy whose father (Jude Law), a clockmaker, dies suddenly in a fire. His alcoholic Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone) is responsible for maintaining the clocks at the railway station and teaches Hugo how to do so before taking an indefinite leave of absence. Hugo, left all alone, lives within the walls of the train station, maintaining the clocks, acquiring food by stealing, and spending his free time trying to fix the automaton his father left behind. The automaton is a mechanical man that, once wound up, is supposed to write; his father found it difficult to fix and it's Hugo's mission to see that it finally works. To successfully accomplish this goal, Hugo steals mechanical parts from a toyshop owner named Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), a callused, angry old man who eventually catches Hugo and steals his blueprints that guide him in fixing the automaton. Hopeless, Hugo befriends Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), Georges goddaughter, and begins to uncover the mystery of Papa Georges cinematic past. The film co-stars Sacha Baron Cohen as the feared Station inspector, who will happily whisk Hugo away to the orphanage if he catches him and Christopher Lee as a generous librarian who specializes in finding a good home for books.Hugo is without a doubt the most visual film that Scorsese has ever directed. Armed with a large budget, the film is heavy on CGI yet moves with the grace of a silent film. The production design by Dante Ferretti and the art direction, credited to ten people, is luxurious and Oscar-worthy, although I confess that it's hard to differentiate between reality and CGI at times. The look, among other things, is completely different from anything Scorsese has made before. The man that directed such gritty films as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver has had a much smoother style in recent years with films like The Departed and Shutter Island, but until now Scorsese has never made a movie that could truly be described as a visual feast for the eyes. As for the story, it's easy to see what made Scorsese respond so strongly to it but taken at face-value it's a rich, lovely fairy tale with shades of Charles Dickens. Of course, in true Scorsese fashion, it's also a history of and love letter to cinema with the importance of film preservation being a theme at the forefront of it all.The performances are great all around, striking and heartbreaking. Butterfield carries the emotional weight of the character well, while Moretz continues to establish herself as one of the best child actors working today. Kingsley delivers a performance that is, at first, cold but gradually turns to sympathetic. Cohen is quietly hilarious but brings genuine pathos to his role. It's a memorable performance that proves what a gifted actor he is and it's worthy of an Oscar-nomination, although if anyone is nominated it will likely be Kingsley and deservedly so.As Hugo is very much a cinematic love letter to early cinema, young children may be bored by it. It has enough magical imagery, but I'm not sure how successfully it could capture some people's ADD-riddled attention spans. It's one of the most classic-feeling modern films I've seen, which could be good or bad depending on your perspective. However, it's a joyous film that both children and adults should give a fair shake.In my humble opinion, Hugo is one of the best films of the year. Who else but Scorsese, well-known as such an incredibly passionate lover of film, could make such a wondrous film about the wonder of film? It's a celebration of all that cinema can be, as well as where cinema came from. It illustrates the progression between cinema being made of dreams to becoming the thing dreams are made of. It's amazing that a major studio would release this film at a time when major studios are largely considered creatively bankrupt. In making a film that celebrates early, silent cinema Scorsese seems to be winking at the audience by creating a film that could not exist without modern technology. Hugo is a perpetually heartwarming and smile-inducing film. Beautiful, not just aesthetically, it's a triumph of spirit; a soulful, magical masterpiece that actually brought tears to my eyes.GRADE: AAs for the 3D; I've always preferred to see 3D used as the gimmick that it is rather than seeing an attempt to be artistic with it. I was not impressed by James Cameron's Avatar and have only seen it used with true purpose in Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Truth be told, I have not been particularly impressed with any use of it I've seen thus far. That changed with Hugo. Scorsese does not use it as a gimmick, but as a way to provide the film with an additional dimension and deepen one's immersion into the overall experience. Would this film still function as magically without it? Yes, it would. Does this use of 3D actually add something to the experience? Undoubtedly. While 3D is still not a fad that I'm particularly hip to, it's good to see a director trying to use it with purpose and actually succeeding.",5,"A Soulful, Magical Masterpiece",1325203200,"12 30,

Wright,"[10, 12]","Martin Scorsese's new film is many things:  A marvelous Dickensian tale of childhood wonder, a portrait of our enduring love of gadgets and gizmos, and, above all, a description of our intense relationship to those marvelous things we call moving pictures.  His lifelong love of film shines in every frame.  The tale is based on one true fact:  George Melies, who was one of the early movie pioneers in the 1900's, was largely forgotten when Hollywood was in full flower, and, at the end of his life was reduced to selling toys in a train station kiosk.  Only in 1929 was he fully recognized as one of the greats.  Scorsese, who has devoted much of his career to preserving and restoring our film history, clearly believes that Melies' surviving work (some of which shows up in a dazzling melange of clips at the end of Hugo) assures his position as the first true Auteur in film history.  In telling this story, Scorsese has pulled out all the stops in his formidable arsenal of cinematic tricks:  Awesome long tracking shots (especially at the beginning of the film), unusual camera angles, superb editing, and, best of all, formidable production design.  Every set is itself a veritable Cabinet of Wonders, full of fascinating mechanical contrivances, beautiful old books, etc.  The photography is just plain gorgeous (I saw the 2D version) - each detail as sharp and clear as I have ever seen in a Blu-ray disc.  I have never seen a more beautiful film.  Along the way, we see many interesting details of how Melies made and edited his films and the equipment he used.  And, of course, the Writing Automaton is a treasure.  Finally, to cap it all off, Ben Kingsley as Melies and the child who plays Hugo provide truly memorable performances and a 3-hankie weeper of an ending.

1374761,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B003Y5H5H4,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[5, 6]","""Hugo"" is director Martin Scorsese's foray into a more fantastic and family friendly film than most of his body of work from ""Mean Streets"" to ""The Departed"".""Hugo"" takes place in 1920's Paris, Hugo is an orphan played by Asa Butterfield whose father (Jude Law) is a watchmaker is killed in a museum fire and Hugo finds himself taken in by an Uncle who works keeping the clocks in the Paris train station. When the Uncle disappears Hugo keeps the clocks running and fends for himself in the train station, stealing what food he can to survive and mechanical parts for an automaton he started to repair with his father. Hugo's life, while it has obvious ""Oliver Twist"" overtones, is going along until one day he tries to steal a mechanical mouse from a toymaker in the train station, who turns out to be the forgotten early filmmaker Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley). Melies confiscates Hugo's notebook of drawings of the automaton and forces Hugo to work in his shop until he's repaid Melies.In an effort to get the notebook back and avoid Melies indentured servitude Hugo enlists Melies ward, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), to retrieve the notebook. The girl who up until now had only read about adventures, senses one in Hugo and agrees to help him and together they discover Melies secrets.There's a lot of whimsy and romanticism surrounding Hugo, the secret passages he uses to get around the Paris train station largely unseen, his love of the mechanical and his mastery of intricate work, as well as the discovery associated with Melies and the automaton, children will enjoy this and hopefully soak up some of the sense of wonder in the worlds discovered in this movie. It's also easily Scorsese's most whimsical movie with an eye towards some of the wonder and fantasy associated with Melies movies.There is one scene that seems a little out of place, when the characters learn the fate of most of Melies movies it seems almost a commercial from the American Film Institute for the need of film preservation, but the moment passes quickly and the audience is reimmersed in the plot of the movie.The casting and acting are great from beginning to finish, Asa Butterfield has the wide look of wonder that youth supplies. Ben Kingsley goes from grouchy old man, to menacing, and then world weary filmmaker. Sacha Baron Cohen plays Hugo's nemesis in the station inspector, a character that clearly could be the grandfather of Inspector Clouseau. Chloe Grace Moretz has the same innocent charisma and sense of wonder as a young Diane Lane in ""A Little Romance.""""Hugo"" is a parable with Melies life as an example of the need to preserve films, but it's also a very personal parable for Scorsese's life. Like Melies of ""Hugo"", a war changed the course of a movie industry, in ""Hugo"" after World War I Melies fantasies were no longer in fashion because audiences had seen too much and craved more realism in their films. Scorsese was part of the wave of post-Vietnam War filmmakers whose realism and naturalistic techniques were more in demand with audiences that were rejecting the studio produced fantasies and movies with an inevitable happy ending that they just didn't see in life.""Hugo"" is an entertaining movie that will awaken a sense of wonder in the viewer young or old.",5,Scorsese's Parable on Film,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,3277,"['Hugo', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'foray', 'more', 'fantastic', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'most', 'body', 'work', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Departed', 'Hugo', 'place', '1920', 'Paris', 'Hugo', 'orphan', 'played', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'father', 'Jude', 'Law', 'watchmaker', 'killed', 'museum', 'fire', 'Hugo', 'taken', 'Uncle', 'who', 'keeping', 'clocks', 'Paris', 'train', 'station', 'When', 'Uncle', 'Hugo', 'keeps', 'clocks', 'running', 'fends', 'train', 'station', 'stealing', 'what', 'food', 'can', 'survive', 'mechanical', 'parts', 'automaton', 'started', 'repair', 'father', 'Hugo', 'life', 'obvious', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'overtones', 'going', 'along', 'one', 'day', 'steal', 'mechanical', 'mouse', 'toymaker', 'train', 'station', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'forgotten', 'early', 'filmmaker', 'Georges', 'Melies', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Melies', 'Hugo', 'notebook', 'drawings', 'automaton', 'forces', 'Hugo', 'work', 'shop', 'repaid', 'Melies.In', 'effort', 'get', 'notebook', 'back', 'avoid', 'Melies', 'indentured', 'servitude', 'Hugo', 'enlists', 'Melies', 'ward', 'Isabelle', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'retrieve', 'notebook', 'girl', 'who', 'now', 'had', 'only', 'read', 'adventures', 'one', 'Hugo', 'help', 'together', 'discover', 'Melies', 'lot', 'whimsy', 'romanticism', 'surrounding', 'Hugo', 'secret', 'passages', 'get', 'Paris', 'train', 'station', 'largely', 'unseen', 'love', 'mechanical', 'mastery', 'intricate', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'discovery', 'associated', 'Melies', 'automaton', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'hopefully', 'soak', 'up', 'sense', 'wonder', 'worlds', 'discovered', 'movie', 'also', 'easily', 'Scorsese', 'most', 'whimsical', 'movie', 'eye', 'wonder', 'fantasy', 'associated', 'Melies', 'one', 'scene', 'little', 'place', 'when', 'characters', 'learn', 'fate', 'most', 'Melies', 'movies', 'almost', 'commercial', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'need', 'film', 'preservation', 'moment', 'quickly', 'audience', 'reimmersed', 'plot', 'movie.The', 'casting', 'acting', 'are', 'great', 'beginning', 'finish', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'wide', 'look', 'wonder', 'youth', 'supplies', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'grouchy', 'old', 'man', 'menacing', 'then', 'world', 'weary', 'filmmaker', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Hugo', 'nemesis', 'station', 'inspector', 'character', 'clearly', 'could', 'be', 'grandfather', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'same', 'innocent', 'charisma', 'sense', 'wonder', 'young', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'A', 'Little', 'Romance', 'Hugo', 'parable', 'Melies', 'life', 'example', 'need', 'preserve', 'films', 'also', 'very', 'personal', 'parable', 'Scorsese', 'life', 'Melies', 'Hugo', 'war', 'changed', 'course', 'movie', 'industry', 'Hugo', 'World', 'War', 'Melies', 'fantasies', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'fashion', 'audiences', 'had', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'craved', 'more', 'realism', 'films', 'Scorsese', 'was', 'part', 'wave', 'post-Vietnam', 'War', 'filmmakers', 'realism', 'naturalistic', 'techniques', 'were', 'more', 'demand', 'audiences', 'were', 'rejecting', 'studio', 'produced', 'fantasies', 'movies', 'inevitable', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'life', 'Hugo', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'will', 'awaken', 'sense', 'wonder', 'viewer', 'young', 'old']",N/A
1374762,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B003Y5H5H4,kacunnin,"[2, 2]","On one level, Martin Scorcese's HUGO is about French filmmaker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, who made hundreds of films between 1896 and 1913.  Anyone who has ever taken a film class in college will remember M&eacute;li&egrave;s's ""A Trip to the Moon.""  Film aficionados will delight in the story of M&eacute;li&egrave;s's life, his work in the industry, and his eventual disappearance into obscurity following World War I.  Ben Kingsley does a commendable job playing M&eacute;li&egrave;s as a disappointed man near the end of his life, believing his life's work has been forgotten.But on another level, HUGO is about our very human need for purpose.  Hugo himself (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy living in the walls and clock tower of the Montparnasse train station in Paris.  Hugo's father (Jude Law) has died, leaving him alone with a strange and magical ""mechanical man"" which his father found in a museum and was desperate to repair.  Hugo makes it his purpose to continue his father's work, believing that the mechanical man has a message for him from his dad.  When Hugo steals mechanical parts from a toy dealer in the train station (it's M&eacute;li&egrave;s of course, played by Kingsley), he inadvertently forms a connection between himself and the now-reclusive filmmaker.  The heart of the film, then, is in Hugo's gift to M&eacute;li&egrave;s - the recovery of the man's purpose, the resurrection of his belief in himself.What makes HUGO a wonderful film, however, really has little to do with either its message or its historical portrait of a French filmmaker.  M&eacute;li&egrave;s's work in film was all about the visuals, and so is Scorcese's HUGO.  This is a movie that explores what makes film a unique medium.  Books can tell stories; writers can even vividly describe images, but the reader is ultimately responsible for seeing them.  But film instantly grabs us out of ourselves and plunges us into time and place in a way that no book ever can.  HUGO is the train station, with its motley group of salespeople, commuters, and orphaned children.  It's the magnificent clock, filled with intricate gears and levers.  It's color and sound and motion, all happening at once.  There's a grandness to the visuals here, a magical beauty that is at once hypnotic and immediate.  This is what Scorsese was going for.  We experience film here the way people experienced M&eacute;li&egrave;s's work a century ago.  The images we see surprise and delight us.  This is why we love film today.  This is why it's magic.HUGO is best appreciated by those who delight in the artistic beauty of film itself, and what amazing feats can be accomplished with a camera and an artistic vision.  This is a film that plays with cinematic visuals in ways that are truly wonderful.  For that alone, it's worth five stars and multiple viewings.  I highly recommend it.",5,"A movie about the history of film, our purpose in life, and the magic of cinema",1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,2866,"['one', 'level', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'HUGO', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'who', 'made', 'hundreds', 'films', '1896', '1913', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'taken', 'film', 'class', 'college', 'will', 'remember', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'A', 'Trip', 'Moon', 'Film', 'aficionados', 'will', 'delight', 'story', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'life', 'work', 'industry', 'eventual', 'disappearance', 'obscurity', 'following', 'World', 'War', 'I.', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'commendable', 'job', 'playing', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'disappointed', 'man', 'end', 'life', 'believing', 'life', 'work', 'been', 'forgotten.But', 'level', 'HUGO', 'very', 'human', 'need', 'purpose', 'Hugo', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'young', 'boy', 'living', 'walls', 'clock', 'tower', 'Montparnasse', 'train', 'station', 'Paris', 'Hugo', 'father', 'Jude', 'Law', 'died', 'leaving', 'alone', 'strange', 'magical', 'mechanical', 'man', 'father', 'found', 'museum', 'was', 'desperate', 'repair', 'Hugo', 'purpose', 'continue', 'father', 'work', 'believing', 'mechanical', 'man', 'message', 'dad', 'When', 'Hugo', 'steals', 'mechanical', 'parts', 'toy', 'dealer', 'train', 'station', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'course', 'played', 'Kingsley', 'inadvertently', 'connection', 'now-reclusive', 'filmmaker', 'heart', 'film', 'then', 'Hugo', 'gift', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'recovery', 'man', 'purpose', 'resurrection', 'belief', 'himself.What', 'HUGO', 'wonderful', 'film', 'however', 'really', 'little', 'do', 'message', 'historical', 'portrait', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'work', 'film', 'was', 'visuals', 'so', 'Scorcese', 'HUGO', 'movie', 'what', 'film', 'unique', 'medium', 'Books', 'can', 'tell', 'stories', 'writers', 'can', 'even', 'vividly', 'describe', 'images', 'reader', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'seeing', 'film', 'instantly', 'grabs', 'ourselves', 'time', 'place', 'way', 'book', 'ever', 'can', 'HUGO', 'train', 'station', 'motley', 'group', 'salespeople', 'commuters', 'orphaned', 'children', 'magnificent', 'clock', 'filled', 'intricate', 'gears', 'levers', 'color', 'sound', 'motion', 'happening', 'once', 'grandness', 'visuals', 'here', 'magical', 'beauty', 'once', 'hypnotic', 'immediate', 'what', 'Scorsese', 'was', 'going', 'experience', 'film', 'here', 'way', 'people', 'experienced', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'work', 'century', 'ago', 'images', 'see', 'surprise', 'delight', 'why', 'love', 'film', 'today', 'why', 'magic.HUGO', 'best', 'appreciated', 'who', 'delight', 'artistic', 'beauty', 'film', 'what', 'amazing', 'feats', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'camera', 'artistic', 'vision', 'film', 'cinematic', 'visuals', 'ways', 'are', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'alone', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

My kids however, ages 5 and 7, were a bit young for it, and found it slow. The shots in old Paris are lovely, and the train station setting is wonderful and allows for some amazing shots, especially as the young Hugo works inside the clocks, and the trains race through the stations. Orphan Hugo works with a friend to discover the trick to getting an old automaton his father left him to work, and ends up discovering the world of early film making. This movie basically offers a brief history of film, with footage from pre-war movies both real and created, and I loved this.

I had heard such rave reviews, with one child going so far as saying it was the best movie of the year.  The story line had such potential, but the story just didn't flow.  There were a lot of moments where the movie just played but nothing happened.  So much storyline left untouched. It is a long movie which drags on and feels even longer than it really is.  Which is unfortunate because the potential is there for a really great movie.*Possible spoilers*... Yes we know the father dies from a great firey explosion, but how & why? How did the fire start? Anyone else die? What happened to the museum?  Then the Uncle appears out of nowhere, steals a watch from the fathers workshop, takes the boy to the clock tower and you never hear from or about him again. Wouldn't the child wonder where he went?  Then one day, as the story needs to wrap up, his body is found.  Men that were nasty mean to Hugo one minute, warm up to him in a very short time, and take him under their wings.  How & why was the robot made?  How does it work?  How did the father get it to write out his message?  There are just so many things left unanswered in this movie!  The way the script is written, Hugo is very vague when speaking and is frustratingly silent when asked very simple questions.  This movie is frustrating throughout because of these type of moments. The movie is slow and the story just drags.  There are so many dull moments where the security guard is trying to muster the courage to talk to a pretty lady, but yet it has nothing to do with the story.  I think the worst acting character is the security guard.  There are so many other actors who could have pulled it off so much better.Pulling the good from the movie, I found the visuals stunning, and the language clean.  It is a movie you can watch with a child or adult of any age, although the subject matter may be lost on the younger ones.  Also, the younger ones and those with ADD/ADHD may have a hard time sitting though the entire movie.On the bad side, one of the dumbest parts of the movie is a phone conversation the security guard has with a man whose wife is leaving him.  Later we hear another conversation he has with this man ""Oh she is is she. And you think it is yours? Well we will find out in 7 months!""  Was this really necessary?Overall I give Hugo 3 stars.

Paramount Pictures's film Hugo, was Co-Produced by Johnny Depp and the director Martin Scorcese (the `Godfather' director himself) - this is Scorcese's first film that didn't involve, the mob, gangsters or guns - this is actually a family film with a very big heart.Rated PG, for he subject matter - it tells the late 1930's tale of a young boy, HUGO (played convincingly by Asa Butterfield of `Nanny McPhee', `Wolfman' & the `Merlin' TV show) who loses his father and takes the place of his uncle (Played by the convincing Ray Winston of `Indiana Jones', &' Percy Jackson and the Olympians') - to do the task of keeping ALL the MANY clocks and their mechanisms working in the world famous and huge Paris railway station. His father, lovingly played by Jude Law (`Sherlock Holmes', `Aviator' & `Alfie'), finds an Automoton (Clock-work Android) that apparently has a special ability that after his fathers death, Hugo goes on his journey of discovery.The whole time Hugo is literally mentally tortured, teased, taunted and abused by one of Academy Award Winner - Sir Ben Kingsly's (`Gandhi', `Schindler's List' & `Prince of Persia') most amazing and heartfelt performances ever. He plays film maker and innovator George M&eacute;li&egrave;s, most noted for the silent film `A Trip To The Moon' - where an oversized bullet takes travelers to the moon and shoots the moon in the eye! `Hugo' although very visual in nature and making full use of the 3D process has beautiful imagery, soft warm tones and a very visual dynamic with all the clock, clock workings and cogs of the machines that tell time in Paris. Not to mention another incredible musical score by Howard Shore (`Lord of the Rings', `Phillidelphia' & `Ed Wood')Young Hugo also has one other problem - he is continuously being chased by the railways Inspector played by the impressive comedic talents of Sarah Baron Cohen (`Sweeney Todd, `Borat' & `Madagascar') who he himself has a malfunction mechanism attached to his leg to help him walk. He and his dog (with his witty smirks) torment Hugo and then unexpectedly gets help from Georges granddaughter - Isabelle (Played by Chloe Grace Moretz of ""Kick Ass' & ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid') they find their way to know the real story behind her Grandfather and his Father's `message'.The film is amazingly entertaining and might be a little slow for the younger crowd - but it has amazing performances, visuals and great `not in your face' 3D effects. It's also a great period film too with many details and intricacies.The film also has some impressive performances `sprinkled' throughout by the Bookstore owner played by Christopher Lee (`Star Wars: The Phantom Menace', `Lord of the Rings'), the Inspectors love interest played by Emily Mortimer (`Shutter Island', `Cars 2' & `The Pink Panther' 2008), a `blooming' love romance played ever so gently by Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour (From the Harry Potter films) and the most heartfelt and magical performance of Helen McCrory (the Harry Potter Films, `The Queen' & `Doctor Who') who plays George M&eacute;li&egrave;s's sympathetic and loving wife.This was refreshing 2 hours and 7 minute film and although the pace is slower that your average shoot-em-up....you really feel apart of Hugo's life.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[9, 11]","One of my favorite Oscar moments a few years ago came when after a highly distinguished career, fellow directors Spielberg, Lucas, and Coppola finally presented Scorsese with his first and long overdue directing Oscar for The Departed.Throughout an illustrious directing career, Scorsese has directed some of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, such as Raging Bull, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, and The Aviator, and many many more.Not only is he a great director, he is also a tremendous movie scholar, responsible for keeping in circulation classic movies such as Thief of Bagdad, a 1941 masterpiece, which influenced him, Coppola and Lucas, and the classic Red Shoes by Powell and Pressburger.In addition he lectures in University on the movies, and you can get his dvdA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies, which explores movies by well known directors of the past such as King Vidor, Fritz Lang, Cecil DeMille. Watching this made me realise the importance and contribution of the director.Hugo leads the Academy award nominations list this year with 11 nominations, closely followed by The Artist with 10, Warhorse, The Descendants, Midnight in Paris, all outstanding movies. Nominations for Hugo include Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.As the movie begins, in one extended shot we zoom through a bustling Paris railway station in 1931, and you become instantly aware that this is no ordinary movie. We meet a 12 year old urchin named Hugo who lives there. Circumstance has committed him to winding and repairing the clocks, and scrabbling for survival as a railway urchin, and we notice that he has a tremendous gift for repairing gadgets, be it watches, clockwork toys, or automatons. Although the story appears to be about a boy, it quickly morphs into a dual story as he comes into contact with a store owner in the station, from whom he steals, and his young granddaughter who befriends him. Secondary stories develop with various other characters at the station.The store owner played by Ben Kingsley is based on a real life character George Melies, and the story develops in simply amazing ways, and the urchin combines with a young girl to reveal a mystery to which she holds the key, a boy, a girl, an automaton, movie magic, and the story works in wonderful ways.I saw it in 3D and I believe this is the best way to watch, so see it if you can while it is still in the movies. As you watch the movie moves ticks along like clockwork, and we have extensive intricate imagery that I was at times simply in awe as I watched the movie, we have crosscutting between the events of the time, and silent movies, with parallellism and repetition from classic movies occurring in the actual story. This is where Scorsese's scholarship and love of the movies shows through, as the the two children meet a movie scholar who looks a little like Scorsese, and ultimately the movie becomes a homage to cinematic genius.Ben Kingsley does an extraordinary acting job, and I was particulaly gripped by one emotional moment few actors could do with the same effect. As you watch this movie, if you're like me you become totally transported, some of the imagery and ticking sound effects remain with me even as I write.Based on the bookThe Invention of Hugo Cabretby Brian Selznick, which explores storytelling with pictures, the author has also writtenThe Hugo Movie Companion: A Behind the Scenes Look at How a Beloved Book Became a Major Motion Picture, a book which I happen to own, as I wanted to read about the naking of the movie.One thing I notice about Hollywood movies set in France in France is the convention of hiring using English actors to play French parts, and using American actors with English accents. Interesting. It turns out that Martin Socrsese and I share the same birthday so we share a little more in common than a love of the movies. I highly recommend this movie.

We saw the 3D version, and it is visually stunning. I was mesmerized for the first 10 minutes.  Then I started looking for plot.  The film develops slowly, which does not bother me--I'm all about build up and character development--but at some point,the various threads need to come together in an engaging way. This film is only mildly engaging. Based on reviews, I knew it was about Georges Meilies, so no surprises there, but I WAS surprised that the only really interesting part of the story happens near the end when Mieles' career plays out.  Hugo's story, his journal, even the automaton left to him by his dead dad--they are all thinly tied together, mixed in with some unfunny side story featuring Sascha Baron Cohen. Hugo actor Asa Butterfield has wide, glossy, baby blue eyes, but little facial expression. My sons and niece were bored to tears. If you like technical virtuosity, see it in 3D because it is state-of-the-art.

1374812,A18NTI5V03ZD6Y,B003Y5H5H4,m4tch,"[1, 1]","I absolutely love this movie, however some viewers should prepare before watching Hugo. One, viewers need to understand that Martin Scorsese (the director) is a storyteller, and like all of his films he takes a keen interest in nurturing dialogue, characters and scenes from start to finish.  Personally, I love his style, it is natural and follows a familiar equation that life presents the unexpected. I find that many directors lack this form of storytelling and must reveal everything or leave it all predictable, which is most unnatural, but some viewers may connect best with these types of movies. Second, I highly recommend watching &#8220;A Trip To The Moon & The Extraordinary Voyage&#8221; by Georges Melies. The black and white original as well colour deluxe copy are both available free on Amazon Prime right now and I really advise taking advantage of this free viewing as it will give you a fonder appreciation for Hugo. &#8230;So you ask, what do the above statements have anything to do with Hugo? Well, the film is set in a 1930&#8217;s Parisian train station as we follow a young boy (Hugo) on his quest to complete his late father&#8217;s work. On this quest he forms a remarkable bond with the ex-magician and filmmaker Georges Melies, now a shop keeper at the train station. This is merely a brief overview of the movie&#8217;s premise, I will leave the rest of the details and twists and turns for the viewer to discover themselves. However, it is safe to say this: Scorsese beautifully and delicately bridges one character&#8217;s private turmoil with the disguised turmoil of others (as based from the novel &#8220;The Invention of Hugo Cabret&#8221;, 2007).Pros:Excellent use of 3D&#8216;Hidden&#8217; historical figures, my favourite being Salvador DaliExcellent storytelling that feels naturalRefreshing castGreat character development that reminds me of the effort that used to be put into Tin TinBeautiful cinematographyCons:There were just couple moments where the younger actors needed to be more realistic or profoundA little jolting turn of plot",5,All the elements that make film a lifetime love affair,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,2079,"['absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'however', 'viewers', 'should', 'prepare', 'watching', 'Hugo', 'One', 'viewers', 'need', 'understand', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'director', 'storyteller', 'films', 'keen', 'interest', 'nurturing', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'scenes', 'start', 'finish', 'Personally', 'love', 'style', 'natural', 'familiar', 'equation', 'life', 'unexpected', 'find', 'many', 'directors', 'lack', 'form', 'storytelling', 'must', 'reveal', 'everything', 'leave', 'predictable', 'most', 'unnatural', 'viewers', 'may', 'connect', 'best', 'types', 'movies', 'Second', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', '8220', 'Trip', 'Moon', 'Extraordinary', 'Voyage', '8221', 'Georges', 'Melies', 'black', 'white', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'colour', 'deluxe', 'copy', 'are', 'available', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'right', 'now', 'really', 'advise', 'taking', 'advantage', 'free', 'viewing', 'will', 'give', 'fonder', 'appreciation', 'Hugo', '8230', 'ask', 'what', 'do', 'above', 'statements', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'Hugo', 'Well', 'film', 'set', '1930', '8217', 'Parisian', 'train', 'station', 'follow', 'young', 'boy', 'Hugo', 'quest', 'complete', 'late', 'father', '8217', 's', 'work', 'quest', 'remarkable', 'bond', 'ex-magician', 'filmmaker', 'Georges', 'Melies', 'now', 'shop', 'keeper', 'train', 'station', 'merely', 'brief', 'overview', 'movie', '8217', 's', 'premise', 'will', 'leave', 'rest', 'details', 'twists', 'turns', 'viewer', 'discover', 'However', 'safe', 'say', 'Scorsese', 'beautifully', 'delicately', 'one', 'character', '8217', 's', 'private', 'turmoil', 'disguised', 'turmoil', 'others', 'based', 'novel', '8220', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', '8221', '2007', '.Pros', 'Excellent', 'use', '3D', '8216', 'Hidden', '8217', 'historical', 'figures', 'favourite', 'being', 'Salvador', 'DaliExcellent', 'storytelling', 'feels', 'naturalRefreshing', 'castGreat', 'character', 'development', 'effort', 'used', 'be', 'put', 'Tin', 'TinBeautiful', 'cinematographyCons', 'were', 'just', 'couple', 'moments', 'where', 'younger', 'actors', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'profoundA', 'little', 'jolting', 'turn', 'plot']",N/A
1374813,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B003Y5H5H4,MadMacs,"[1, 1]","Quite surprising for an American director to create an excellent Euro-styled production. Filmmakers crossing ponds and finding success is very rare in my cinema experience, very rare.A pair of examples of how unusual and difficult it is: 'Hulk' directed by Ang Lee. It sucked. And visa versa, 'Death at a Funeral' crafted by Frank Oz. Again, it sucked. These are highly regarded directors in their respective cultures - but translating that into a completely different cultural product is so very difficult. The style, temperament, and visual cues are often subtle and easily detectable if missed. And if not done correctly, will sink a film. Though to be fair, Lee's project immediately after the green disaster was a hugely successful movie.Point being: Few filmmakers can transfer and translate their abilities. Obviously Martin Scorsese is a member of that very elite club.Loved this film, and I was really impressed by wide-eyed newcomer Asa Butterfield, who played the all-important lead role of Hugo. So easy for a director to select a child actor who is inappropriate - either overrated or because they're simply incapable. Remember the atrociously plastic kid in the latter 'Star Wars' films? Or how about that ridiculously pretentious little prig in the recent stinker 'Real Steel'? Lots of kids just don't have ""it"" - and surprisingly, many of them still somehow con their way into films. I'm honestly amazed that Scorsese was able to cut through the blatherskite and find the right performer.Butterfield has just enough universal appeal to forgive the fact that he, and the other artists, were speaking English. A tough sell given that almost the entire cast were from the UK.I have to think the French would've been happier if Scorsese had utilized an authentic Franco cast. Sadly, many in the US don't speak another language or are incapable of reading subtitles - so it's completely understandable from a marketing perspective.

There is also a creepy picture of the moon appearing to spy on us and also aliens on the moon that live underneath the surface, with closer inspection of these 'aliens' we are shown the half cresent flag.  There are lots of other images, too many to mention, personally I dont want my child thinking images of the Devil are acceptable and 'entertaining'.

What seems to be the trouble is that this extremely detailed little picture was advertised as a big adventure film (which in its own way, it is), but those movie fans who go chiefly for that sort of thing were disappointed that it is actually a historical timepiece. It's an homage to cinema in which the main adventure is within a small story about the early days of movie making, the imagination and wonder of a child, and the awakening of a broken old man who was once a great artiste.  Far from being ""shallow"" as more than one reviewer complained, this film is quite the opposite.  Sometimes I think audiences have been spoiled by action pictures spiced with plenty of sex and violence (and Scorsese has directed his fair share of this kind of movie) -- this film has none of the former, and very little of the latter, yet if one just relaxes and lets it unfold at its own pace, there are layers of discovery available to an opened mind and heart. There are numerous visual references throughout, all of which anchor this story in a particular place and time, with literary and artistic characters planted among the crowds, that if one is either uneducated or inattentive might go unnoticed, and other character vignettes that have nothing to do with the main plot, but which give this unique picture its delicious flavors.  I did not see the movie in 3-D, and frankly, it's great without it, because it doesn't really need a gimmick!  There is a glorious, golden glow about this beautifully designed location, a train station in Paris, that is reminiscent of the animated picture, RATATOUILLE, and indeed, much of the scenery is digitally created or enhanced; however, much of the setting is real, built scenery, and the colors are hyped just enough to give it the magical look it has.The acting by all the principles is fine, if not outstanding, but the most surprising turn was made by Sacha Baron Cohen, an actor I'm not normally fond of.  As a policeman who was wounded in World War I and has a mechanical contraption supporting one leg, he is uncomfortable and stiff in his uniform, and seems to be unfamiliar with smiling.  Negative reviewers complained about Sacha's performance, but HE wasn't wooden, his CHARACTER was ... that is, until he is helped by another character to overcome his painful shyness and open up to a flower girl he's attracted to.  There is comedy in Cohen's performance, but I did not laugh AT the character, which is one reason this nuanced bit of acting deserves notice.  The lead actor, Asa Butterfield, has striking blue eyes, and the clothes the orphan he plays, Hugo, is still wearing, but has outgrown, were a wonderful, realistic touch.  Kingsley is his usual, brilliant self as Georges M&eacute;lies, and the other main character, the girl who befriends Hugo, Chlo Grace Moretz, is a real find.  Helen McCrory is truly charming as George's wife and former muse, as are three real dogs, who have as much character as any human -- yet, although this movie is based on a children's book, I found it to be sophisticated and adult.  Maybe this is why some reviewers were bored.

He puts everything on the line and gets outstanding  performances from his actors in every movie he makes, whether a masterwork like ""Goodfellas"" or an interesting-but-flawed detour like ""New York New York."" He does not beg for awards, pander to the box office, or make throw-aways for paychecks.After decades of sex, drugs, rock-n-roll and stunningly operatic violence, he proves himself master of yet another genre, the family fantasy. Hugo, an orphaned clock maker's son who's perhaps nine or ten years old, lives alone in the secret passages of the old Gare Montparnasse in Paris in the early 1930s. He keeps the station clocks running, steals bread off caterer's trolleys, and steals parts from a toymaker's shop in the station to try to complete the repairs his deceased father had started on an old automaton, all the while dodging the efforts of the station inspector and his Doberman to catch Hugo and send him to an orphanage. Hugo's struggle to survive and fix the automaton lead him into the world of the pioneers of silent film, particularly to the work of Georges Melies who essentially invented science fiction and fantasy movies. Scorcese's admirable passion for film history and preservation lead him into a bit of story-slowing pedantry, but it's a minor flaw in a gorgeous, charming film that sensitively captures the dreams, fears and longings of children.Observant adults will enjoy some visual surprises that pass so quickly they're almost subliminal. James Joyce is seated at a cafe in the station, and isn't that Johnny Depp playing in a Django Reinhardt style band? Children  will enjoy the child's-eye perspective and fast-paced adventure.

Its imaginative and beautifully done.  It is also one of the best looking blu-rays i have seen.It seems so many movies these days forget that some people still love good story telling.  You can tell whole those people are by reading the reviews.  All the people who say this movie was boring probably didn't even pay attention to the story.  They were probably expecting some amazing special effects or who knows what.  I will admit this story is not for those who do not enjoy actually paying attention and or dislike interesting characters.  This movie is for those who enjoy books and imagination.This story is about a young orphan who wants nothing more than to understand and rebuild this automated doll that his father was working on.  He believes that this object has left a hidden message from his father.  Along the way, he makes a friend and eventually he does get his answer, but i will not give that away.Even though most of the movie takes place at the train station, there is a sort of adventure and mystery involved in the clues this child follows.

Moore,"[11, 13]","Most of the reviewers here have been very careful to preserve the plot surprises in Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo,"" and I will be too, although by now many writers have spilled the beans. So all I will say is that ""Hugo"" is one of those very rare movies that lives up to the phrase, ""movie magic."" Scorsese has us in the palm of his hand from the first shot, a magnificent panoramic sweep of a Paris train station circa 1930, and keeps us there all the way to the expected happy ending. The basic story--Hugo (Asa Butterfield), a misprized Parisian orphan who keeps the station clocks running, even as he tries to evade capture by the officious station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen)--is one just about any child can relate and thrill to. But the story really opens up once it gets to Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), curmudgeonly proprietor of the station's toy shop, and his beloved goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).""Hugo"" can best be described as a voyage of discovery, using extraordinarily sophisticated cinematic techniques to create a marvelously sustained mood of childlike wonder. As Hugo and Isabelle, piece by piece, uncover the life story of Papa Georges, Scorsese pays glorious tribute to the early days of the cinema, and to the pioneers who created it. This is the first film I have ever seen in which the director uses 3D to advance the story, not just to provide chills and thrills to the audience. The effect is that of Scorsese, like Papa Georges within the movie, waving his magic wand to cast a spell of enchantment over the audience.Scorsese's usual crew is here--photographer Robert Richardson, designer Dante Ferretti and editor Thelma Schoonmaker--and their work is flawless. Also flawless is the cast; ""Hugo"" features a veritable honor roll of some of the best actors working today, including the aforementioned players as well as Helen McCrory, Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Griffiths, Frances de la Tour, and--in a brief, poignant cameo--Jude Law.If I were as curmudgeonly as Papa Georges, I could complain that the story of ""Hugo"" stretches a little thin toward the end.

The film received much critical acclaim at the 84th Academy Awards coming home with five Oscars--for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing out of the eleven nominations it was given.

Hugo's father has died leaving him and orphan.  His dad was a tinkerer of mechanical mechanisms at a museum and had taught Hugo an ability to repair wind up gadgets.  When his alcoholic uncle passes away Hugo lives in constant fear of being caught by the vigilant Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) and be put in an orphanage.Hugo has an automaton given him by his father and a notebook showing schematics on how to repair it so he pilfers small parts from the local toymaker Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley).  Hugo is caught and his treasured notebook is taken from him by Papa Georges who says he is going to take it home and burn it.The story unfolds as Hugo tries to retrieve the notebook and meets the myriad of characters that frequent or work at the train station.

1374847,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B003Y5H5H4,M. Oleson,"[7, 10]","In this wonderfully inventive film, director Martin Scorsese incorporates two different genres into one great story.  The first half of the film deals with a young boy who is orphaned and adopted by his drunken Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone).  Claude is responsible for keeping all of the clocks wound and in proper working order at a huge Paris train station.  Young Hugo (Asa Butterfield) learns how to do this and after his uncle disappears, manages to keep the clocks working.  He lives where he works deep in the belly of the station.  The only thing Hugo has from his father (Jude Law in flashbacks) is a robotic like machine called an automatron.  Since the inner workings of the machine function much like a windup clock, Hugo is constantly trying to get it to function again.  This requires guile, skill and stealing parts.  One of Hugo's victims is the owner of a trinket shop.  This grouchy old man named George is played by Ben Kingsley.  George and his wife however are the Godparents of another young orphan named Isabelle (Chloe Moretz).  She and Hugo create a bond and get into mischief and eventually detective work.  Both are enamored by magic and George was once a great magician as it turns out.  This set up segues to another creative style in which we discover that George is actually famed movie pioneer George Melies.Scorsese is one of the great film historians in addition to being an iconic director and puts in much time and effort into presenting Melies contribution to film.  He was instrumental in giving the new medium a sense of illusion.  Magic and trickery?  Of course.  Movies and magic.  Melies grumpiness is mostly attributed to his departure from the industry after WW I.  The reason is unclear, although the public's lack of interest as suggested seems overstated.  Hugo sets out to bring George the attention he deserves, if many years later.  He enlists the help of a film expert who knows Melies' work but believed he had died years earlier.  The ending is sweet and predictable but also a perfect conclusion to a magical film.  I saw this film in 3-D which was some of the best work this ""trickery"" has to offer.  A perfect partnership.The Blu ray version of this film is equal to the quality or the original.  The 1080p transfer is shown with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and frankly leaves nothing to be desired.

Oh dearie, dearie me.I'm not a 10-12 twelve year old, clearly the target audience for this appalling waste of $200million, but I coughed up my $20 and wore the glasses so here goes.Before I even saw HUGO my suspicions were aroused by the studio's hyberbolic PR trumpeting of the virtues of this 'Nouvelle Vague' of 3D wonderfulness, those suspicions were indeed confirmed after a mere two minutes of this movie.  The soulless camera work feels self conscious, obtrusive and sadly doesn't even begin to plaster over the sloppy acting and pedestrian script. It's like Scorsese was 'not at his desk' but had his hands full dealing with the sheer weight of technical nonsense involved. Whatever the reason the piece is devoid of his masterful touch. Anyhoo I hung in there but after forty minutes of eye watering 3D my heart finally sank into the bog of it's mediocrity, my cherished memories of Travis Bickle, Joey Santoro, Charlie, Johnny Boy etc etc tarnished forever. When Hugo mercifully finished, it felt shockingly forgettable. It just evaporated - no indelible quotes or haunting images, just a scrap of a $200 million discarded sweetie wrapper.And what of all the fine words spouted about the revelatory nature of the new sensitive 3D we're being so desperately flogged? Well, for me, there was scant proof of the lofty claims as to it's drama enhancing qualities - in fact it was more distracting nuisance than revelation or enhancement. I'm afraid from an adult perspective it was....well ummm, lame.The final insult of this 'homage' is that Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s was in love with the medium of FILM and the journey it took him on to create magic in the camera. HELLO! FILM, not a load of smart arsed CGI FX churned out on a digital camera pretending to be a film camera - for heaven's sake. HUGO is in fact the polar opposite of an homage, betraying the very essence of M&eacute;li&egrave;s passion.

Doyle ""film buff""","[2, 2]","HUGO is a magical treat from start to finish, beginning with its marvelous open tracking shot of a Paris railroad station in the '30s. From then on, there's a treasure of masterful photography involved in the telling of a boy who lives in a train station and, in the tradition of his inventive father, keeps the huge clock and its machinery working.The boy is played with great sensitivity by Asa Butterfield in what has to be one of the best child performances ever. He carries the film and never lets the momentum stop as he scurries around the train station trying to avoid the overzealous clutches of a crippled station master (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his fearsome dog. It's like watching Dicken's innocent Oliver Twist or David Copperfield trying to avoid the unscrupulous mishandling of a mistrustful adult.All of the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the whirling machinery inside the clock are an added visual treat, creating the illusion of suspense and danger whenever the plot demands it. As the girl whom Hugo befriends and shares his knowledge of the automaton with, Chlore Grace Moretz is equally charming and natural. Their chemistry helps the film's most pivotal moments work beautifully.A much needed sense of humor is helped enormously by the contribution of Sacha Baron Cohen, whose station master emerges as one of the story's most interesting characters. Emily Mortimer is touching as a woman he admires and Christopher Lee does a standout job as the librarian who takes an interest in furthering Hugo's education.The story's thread is slight, but the film is full of such complex images and turbulent events surrounding the boy's precarious situation that it remains an absorbing tale of an orphan who proves to be a most resourceful lad in keeping one step ahead of the authorities.Then too, it's a backstory of the famous cinema inventor Georges Melies, who had the imagination to become one film's most inventive craftsmen in the early 1900s.

After the death of his father Hugo believes that returning the automaton back to working order, which has a writing function, will contain a message from his dad, and he works tirelessly to achieve this.The automaton connects more than one broken heart and Hugo's comment that: ""machines don't come with spare parts...so as humans we have to assume that there are no spare parts in our world, and that we all have a purpose,"" is striking as philosophically poignant film dialogue.The viewer is presented with a stupendously crafted story, complemented by wonderful acting, and accompanied by breathtaking film shot selection and vivid colour.Nicholas R.W.

1374867,A2GP36FGLXD9T2,B003Y5H5H4,Oscar L. Colombo,"[4, 4]","This movie is fun to watch and easy on the eyes. It has great music and photography, a superb performance by Ben Kingsley, supported by an excellent British cast. (Including Frances de la Tour, who also appeared in two Harry Potter movies as Olympe Maxime, the giantess love interest of Rubeus Hagrid.)There are some amazing photographic tricks: an apparently endless tracking shot all along a train platform and into the main lobby of a huge railway station. Another, where a train that is coming in too fast cannot be stopped at the end of the track, and plows through the station and ends with the engine and the first carriage hanging from the sill of the large front glass window, over the street.That is a recreation of a famous train accident in that same Parisian station, the Gare du Nord, in Montmartre, where much of this movie takes place.The story is, in part, centered on an important event towards the end of the life of cinema pioneer and special effects inventor extraordinaire, Georges Melies, and on a mysterious key that will set in motion a mechanical man, an automaton. The key is missing, all right, but is not very mysterious: the look allowed to the movie watchers for a few seconds clearly suggests what the shape of the key is likely to be. When the key is finally seen, it is exactly what one would have expected. But two smart and mechanically skillful people, Hugo's father and Hugo himself, who had been seeing the same thing day after day, for months on end, as they worked hard to fix the automaton, apparently couldn't figure it out. Another thing I found disappointing in this ambitious big-budget movie is the oddly unnecessary liberty taken with the life of Melies: The wife he was living with at the time, contrary to what is shown in the movie, was his second, not his first wife and the actress in his films. That one was dead and buried, and had been so for a number of years already.In ""Hugo"", the story of Melies has been romanticized and prettified to appeal to children and sentimental grown ups, and for that a lot of nice shinning, moving objects have been piled on it, with 3-D, and a little romance. It makes for a good show: a mixture of outright fantasy, some (sort-of) reality, and some over the top drama.The real Georges Melies was a successful magician that, in the last years of the XIX century and the beginnings of the XX saw in the movies a new way of making tricks to impress his audience. Then he started making actual movies: Movies that told stories! Movies that showed impossible, beautiful, unforgettable, things! He brought them to the wider public, and help lay the foundation for the one true popular art of our age. He did not invent moving pictures: Edison in America and the brothers Lumiere in France did that. But their movies were about mundane happenings or else recreations of famous events: a train coming into a station, a dog barking and playing tricks, a horse galloping, a famous train wreckage, a buxom young woman dancing a naughty dance, that sort of thing.Melies brought fantastic, unreal stories to the screens, so people in big cities and small villages, everywhere, could see his gorgeous dreams with their very own eyes. Today, those movies look crude and simplistic; in their day, they were dynamite. And an invaluable inspiration to those film makers that came after him and improved on them.As to ""Hugo"": it left me pleased but unsatisfied, wishing for a different movie about Melies' life: one without fantastic adornments and thrills and spills. His life was fantastic and dramatic, and important, and singular enough. He was a great man, I think he deserves more. I hope he gets it, some day.",3,Nice movie.

I had heard good things about the movie, and yet, I delayed and put off going to this movie because... it's a kid's movie, right? Wrong!""Hugo"" (125 min.) is director Martin Scorsese's most unexpected movie ever (for me anyway), I mean how can you reconcile this gentle movie with the maker of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets, just to name those. The plot of ""Hugo"" has already been described in other reviews, so I won't go into it again. The movie really blossoms in the second half when instead of focusing on the young Hugo, the movie clearly becomes a ode to... the movies in general, and film preservation/restoration specifically, a cause near and dear to Scorsese's heart At that point you can really feel Scorsese's touch all over this.

There weren't any OOS (out of screen) effects that I could see but the 3D was outstanding nonetheless. From the sweeping views of Paris in the opening scenes to action shots in the train station with a dog and gendarme chasing Hugo to a train coming toward you, Martin Scorsese uses some of the best cinematography I've seen in the making of this film. The fact that it was originally filmed in 3D rather than having the effects added later is probably a reason that it looked so well done.  The scenes in Paris were beautiful.The story is about a young orphan, Hugo, played by Asa Butterfield, who lives in a train station in Paris in the 1930's and takes care of maintaining the clocks after his drunken uncle, Claude, played by Ray Winstone disappears. Hugo was close to his dad, played by Jude Law, before he is killed in a museum fire. He has to steal food from the local vendors in order to survive and he spends a lot of his time trying to repair an automaton, kind of a robot, that his dad brought home from the museum before he died. Papa Georges, played very convincingly by Ben Kingsley, puts Hugo to work for him to pay off his debt for stealing parts for the automaton. A girl his age named Isabelle, played by Chlo Grace Moretz, ends up helping Hugo. The acting is superb and the story, if a little predictable at times, is still a good one.My main reason for purchasing this movie was to try out the 3D using passive 3D lenses, with a new TV.

Saln-P...","[0, 0]","Weighing Scorsese film at this point in his virtuosity, would be a truism, I would say, for example, that is huge, like a mighty river flowing through the frames, musical patterns, and New York (the Italian of course). The metaphor of a stream flow of ideas, scenes, actors, extras and conjugations you do with these elements is comparable to George M&eacute;li&egrave;s, a dynamo therein as the Director that this film honors.  I would like to paraphrase to Isaac Newton about Scorsese, saying: ""We are standing on the cameras filming the giants who preceded us.""It is said that Hugo Cabret is playing in this transgression of time and space, the asthmatic child that was Martin, a situation which limited its output in street playgrounds with other kids an because that to invent other kind of  activities, fantasies, and read what ever was at hand, in that he was in semi-seclusion like the boy in his movie. Hugo serves various and giant gears that move the clocks in the train station. Full of people coming and going, but also merchants and their customers- All such  faces that are spy by Hugo, reading minds, gestures, learning in such a big behavior laboratory,  stands apart from the covers of Time Machines. Was Scorsese as a child watched the passers-by from his  home?The movie is also the story of the great George M&eacute;li&egrave;s, in part of his life in which he was in a small kind of estrangement from the joy that gave him the directing, acting, doing drawings (storyboards), for the scenes and scenarios, design mobile scaffolds in the first movie studio at Montreuil (the summer place of another small boy with asthma Marcel Proust  as Scorsese).That studio was like a greenhouse, to exploit sunlight as light, because the resources of artificial illumination were limited. M&eacute;li&egrave;s was originally from a merchant family in shoes, but its formation from the drawing to the humanities (spoke Latin, Greek and English), and his curiosity about the inventions (an element that adds to the child Scorsese to Hugo Cabret), and finally his training in sleight of learning in London and then in the theater of Robert Houdin, allows graduating from the University of Life, to be the equivalent of Mozart at the movies. He did not invent the cinema, but this activity has made the filming of people, parades, trains, waves and military parades, the narration of dreams.It was so banal everyday filming, those scenes that merchants traveling fairs, bought the footage per meter, as the fabrics. It's telling stories, people come and go, objects, hopes rise and fall, wanting to be deceived, opposite the silver screen, but with elegance and good trade, is something that develops, among other hundreds things M&eacute;lli&egrave;s, and some of them are still used, and they were only perfected.Hugo is the child who discovers metaphorically that great director who works in a toy and candy store, forced to be out of movies because the of Edison, like Bill Gates of his day, it has been marginalized and forced to sell everything. For me, the discovering of the old filmmaker, is the central metaphor of the film, along with the automats, which indeed they were the hobby that M&eacute;li&egrave;s inherited from the previous owner of the theater of magicians and illusionists which owner and director before was Robert Houdin. Scorsese would like to have him the discovered of that Director in real life, but Hugo is his alter ego in the film.The movie ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" with Ben Kingsley  as George M&eacute;li&egrave;s. has in him almost  an exact phenocopy  of the director M&eacute;li&egrave;s, it's amazing  to see photos of the latter after seeing Scorsese's film and tell that makeup is well characterized and acting by  Kingsley.The film was so superb directed and the actor's direction was so careful that even the hypomanic Sach Baron Cohen, was acting soft and nice, as ""The Station Inspector"" and also one of my favorite actors, speciallyin  my childhood fantasy, Dracula, as Christopher Lee, was there acting as the mythical bookseller of the  library.""The invention of Hugo Cabret"" did not win the Oscar, but this is a greatest film, compared with ""the Artist"".  This was another of the contenders, which highlights the actions and dramas of the actors in the transition from silent movies to talkies. If you used a metaphor between rock and blues guitarists and both directors, the director of ""The Artists"" Michel Hazanavicius, is for me as the guitarist of the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, a good interpreter of his instrument, he dreamed one night the tune of ""I can't get no Satisfaction"" and this was the song that catapulted to international fame with his band.While Martin Scorsese is for me like Stephen Ray ""Stevie"" Vaughan, who BB King and Eric Clapton, said that when he played blues guitar, the music flowed without repeating, natural, without pause, as if connected to a place from where it came all the phrasing of his instrument.Scorsese is the hallmark of all his films; he is like Fellini and Kurosawa, that deployed extras and cameras all over the scenario. For instance in ""Shining a Light"", with the Stones, he jokes with them, pretending to be angry, because they had not given the list of songs to play at the concert to be ready to shoot. But with 16 cameras covering and shooting everything (Yamamoto recommended that Kurosawa filmed with 100 camera because the real work of the Director was to be editor), Scorsese could be filming Mickey Jagger's uvula, rather that an act of superiority of Rolling Stones, as some critics cried as ""blasphemers head bangers addicts"", that was just a prefabricated joke between Jagger and ScorseseHugo, the movie is a tribute to George M&eacute;li&egrave;s, but at the same time, draw a line in the dream of the audience: ""You want to know of silent film and its brave men with their cameras and cranks? For this is the Lord's Prayer. Sweeteners are for ""The Artist"" just more saccharin for fat, tissues. But the real diabetics we watch this George M&eacute;li&egrave;s's! And we are not afraid and we like the glucose rises! ""The film of Scorsese did not win the Oscar, but when no one remember  ""The Artist"",  The Scorsese movies  will continued to bee watched, and the empathy for Hugo Cabret would be one important master movie about George M&eacute;li&egrave;s and of course indirectly by my admired Martin Scorsese.",5,"George M&eacute;li&egrave;s discovered by the dreams of Hugo Cabret, when he was the boy

In others, the studios substitute special effects for story and acting and theaters charge 30% more.  But I was intrigued when Martin Scorsese offered at 3D movie, a PG one! So I gave it a try.In the previews ""Hugo"" looked like a cartoon. It is not. It is real actors and real Paris, overlaid a golden memory of Paris of the early thirties. Special effects transform, take us back. There are sidewalk cafes, an orphaned boy Hugo  whose uncle had the job of winding and maintaining all the huge clocks in and around the Paris train station (Le Gare Saint-Lazare?) He abandons Hugo Cabret with the winding keys and goes on a very extended drunk. Poor Hugo winds and fixes, and feeds himself by stealing to occasional croissant and milk and sleeps in the bell tower. Comic martinet Sasha Baron Cohen plays Le Inspectuer, an injured WWI veteran who tries to catch the miscreants. Hugo meets Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz- in a much less violent role than ""Kick-ass"").  She is the bookish tomboy goddaughter of the mysterious old toyshop owner (Ben Kingsley). Hugo's watchmaker father (Jude Law) had a old robot and Hugo and Isabelle try to fix it.Like ""Midnight in Paris"" this movie is a paean to a prettier Paris of the past. Scorsese gives us his usual long tracking shots and 3D deep depth of field shots. Scorsese pulls at your heart.Without giving more plot away, while this is a kids movie, it's Scorsese, much will just fly over the heads of the kids. There are many nods to old silent movies. Charlie Chaplin as the little tramp, Mary Pickford as the poor flower girl, Harold Lloyd hanging from the large clock face, and many more. Scorsese uses 3D to show towers, gears, etc. A wonderfully pretty movie, a Chistmasy glaze over old Paris. The L'arc du Triomphe and Place de Etoile at night. Pretty lights and colors with 3D snowflakes. Even a street band with Django Reinhardt on guitar!  The boy playing Hugo (Asa Butterfield) rather has a limited range and occasionally flubs his lines... You ignore that and it's quite nostalgic.  Older and simpler times.Good family movie for Christmas if you want to avoid the usual seasonal junk.

Interesting sentiments that begin Hugo Cabret's (Asa Butterfield) journey towards understanding the world around him and the loss that he has endured after the death of his father, a clock-caretaker and an inspiration to Hugo's inquisitiveness to how things work, especially anything mechanical and most importantly clocks.  The movie takes place in the city of lights Paris within a train station where Hugo also lives.  With the opening scenes of the film, viewers have entered a world of mystery, mischief, and magic that looks like a combination of animation and like-action.Hugo becomes an orphan but somehow becomes independent and self-reliant.  His curiosity and persistence to understand the things that his father (Jude Law) left behind leads him to an experience like no other that a child his age could ever imagine.  And the key component that leads him to a world that he has been enthralled and fascinated with, his father's small sketch notebook; the notebook was one of the last objects along with the mechanical figure that his father had been working on that will help to spark Hugo's energy to unlock the mystery behind the drawings and the mechanical figure.  But before he and Isabelle area able to unlock the mystery, he encounters a disgruntled toy shopkeeper by the name of Georges (Ben Kingsley)and retrieves the notebook who inquires about the drawings; but as the film progresses more mysterious elements arise and the question of who exactly is Georges? But along the way, Hugo does not make his journey alone, and he befriends Georges's goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).  The drawings reveal much in terms of the love for film and its origins, which renowned and critically acclaimed Director Martin Scoresese helped to revive and unlock the mystery as well as the history of film-making within the main character of Hugo as well as other most recent films The Artist.  Both films recaptured the craft and innovation of what movies had first set out to accomplish - entertain but also make the filmgoer wonder after the last credits of the film have gone up.  But also most notably, the individuals that first made this world of wonderment happen and what Hugo's storyline centers upon, legendary filmmaker George M&egrave;li&eacute;s and the cinema.With the sudden resurgence of the history of film, the release of Hugo and The Artist are a welcoming aspect, especially during this rise of technology within the film industry and overall within the cinema.

While children - if my grandkids are any example - will love this film, it has appeal for all age groups and I believe will be enjoyed by the old and young equally. It won five Oscars at the recent Academy Awards; and director, Martin Scorsese, won a Golden Globe for his direction. One of the Oscars was awarded for visual effects and cinematography...and you will find them both to be stunning. It was shown in the theater in 3D and is available in 3D in DVD format...while I saw the Blu-ray version, it is probably more stunning yet in 3D. The tribute to early cinema contained in the film is based on fact...the characterization of Georges Melies, the enigmatic toy shop owner and former filmmaker, was based on the real pioneer filmmaker of the same name. That is a subplot: the main plot revolves around a young orphan, who lives alone, secretly, in Gare Montserrat, a Paris Railway station. He has learned watch and clock repair from his deceased father and how to maintain the clocks of the station from his uncle, who has disappeared. He maintains the clocks, steals food; and works on his father's favorite project, the repair of an automaton. The automaton becomes the connection to the toy shop owner...and the story develops from there. The wonderful child actor, Asa Butterfield is the orphaned boy, Hugo, and Ben Kingsley is Georges Melies, the film pioneer and toy shop owner. They both deliver masterful performances. The support cast is also superb, including another child star, Chloe Moretz, who plays Melies' adopted daughter and becomes Hugo's best friend; and Sacha Baron Cohen, as the sometimes-comical police inspector.

1374895,A39W3263A9HCMN,B003Y5H5H4,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[1, 2]","It may seem odd that a movie about the magic of cinema, in an age where cinema proved itself to be more than just a fad, the 1920s, would be made utilizing 3D, a gimmick that seems to be all the rage today. This gets lampshaded by one particular scene, where the audience watches a scene where a train pulls into a station and flips out, as they think the train is coming for them. Yet, given the subject matter, it only seems inevitable that a man like Martin would think up such an idea for such a plot, anyway.Based off the book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", which is a stunning mix of hand drawings and writing, and set in 1920s Paris, the film ""Hugo"" tells the story of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who works and lives in the clock tower of a train station, which is ruled by a ruthless inspector, and is also where he has been stealing several toys for their parts to fix a broken automaton, made for the movies of Georges M&eacute;il&egrave;s. One day, when caught trying to steal a toy, the owner notices Hugo's notebook, which contains conceptual sketches for the automaton, and steals it, to which Hugo tries to get back.But Hugo instead meets Uncle Georges' adoptive daughter, who helps him try to get the notebook back. But through all this, they both end up in the mystery surrounding the automaton, and movies. Isabelle hasn't seen a movie, and after a stint in a cinema, they find out that film itself is what keeps drawing them closer and closer in this spider's web... and so begins an adventure for the two where they discover themselves, the joy of movies, and the need to stick together in the face of adversity.Wow... What a film. Honestly, I don't think I've seen a movie like this at all. I always knew you could count on Marty to blow your mind, and here he really has outdone himself. I was left speechless after the movie- honestly I don't think I've been left with that feeling in ages.Everything about this movie is just brilliant. First, the acting is STELLAR. Asa Butterfield plays the titular character so heartbreakingly beautifully. He puts so much pain and emotion into his performance that it's as mesmerizing as it is heartbreaking. He is a great actor with the eyes too, and he really showed it here... Every melancholy expression of his had me on the verge of tears (and I'm a very manly guy!!!). Moertz... Well, we knew she was amazing when we saw her in Kick-Ass!, and she is especially brilliant here. Cohen is his usual funny self, let's face it: he was made for the comic roles. He does brilliantly here. But best of all is Kingsley... Oh man. Word to all directors ever: if you don't want your audience reduced to sobbing messes, never have Ben Kingsley play a broken old man, ever. We all know he's an amazing actor. But here, he gives his most devastatingly beautiful performance ever. I cried in a few places, he is that phenomenal.The plot? Well, you knew already it's great. But my synopsis does not do it justice, believe me. Absolutely beautifully done.The cinematography is perfect, and the 3D is amazing. This is the best 3D I've seen in any movie, ever. It helps tell the story, for once- it helps a movie about the magic of filmmaking, that should say something. This must be seen in a 3D cinema, I mean that. Every single detail is exposed, there's several moments where its like you're looking through a window. I think Scorsese made a wise choice to shoot in 1:85.1, too. That helped give the movie the old timey feel it aimed for. I will definitely add this film to my Blu ray collection, even if it's just to show off my HD equipment for family members visiting in the future.And another thing- the feel of the movie is perfect. This is a film made for us who go to a movie to immerse ourselves in it. To escape from reality and indulge in this world being brought forth to us. Not since TRON: Legacy have we gotten a film as magical as that, and I did not want this movie to end at all.In short, do not miss this film. If you're tired of brainless blockbusters and dialogue driven movies that turn them into videotaped plays, and want a film that sums up why we go to the cinema, see this movie.

1374909,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B003Y5H5H4,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","Hugo(released Nov/11) stars Ben Kingsley  as George Melies,Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret,Chlo Grace Moretz as Isabelle,Sacha Baron Cohen as Inspector Gustave,Jude Law as Hugo's father,Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse,and an astounding supporting cast of other actors.This is a nostalgic look back at film making's earliest days and how a young boy is the catalyst for one its most honoured creator's deserved return to the limelight.Beautifully photographed and set decorated,this piece almost immediately brings you into the film titled young boys life and world,and from there the adventure never stops building to its inevitable climax.The story takes place,I would guess,in the late 20s.Hugo is a young boy living with his father,who works in a museum.Hugo has become a tinkerer of sorts,like his father,and both work together on repairing and bringing back to life an automaton Hugo's father claimed from the museum's basement.One night his father is fatally caught in a conflagration at the museum and Hugo is forced to go and live with his inebriated uncle.The uncle tends the clock works at the Gare Montparnasse,the central train station in Paris.And when his uncle is away,which is quite often,it is left up to Hugo to pick up the slack.Eventually his uncle is found dead,and he is left an orphan.When Hugo has down time he works away at the automaton.He regularly scrounges parts from an old man who runs a small toy store in the train station.One day the man catches the boy and Hugo is forced to empty his pockets.Among the items the man confiscates is Hugo's diary which his father kept while working on the automaton.That night Hugo follows the man  home and speaks to his young god-daughter,who promises to keep her father from burning the book and to help him get it back.Next day Hugo is hired by the old man in the toy store to fix his toys.In return he says he will eventually return his book.One day Hugo takes the old mans god daughter to the movies(to which she has never been)and in return she introduces him to a local bookseller.Then Hugo introduces her to the automaton he has been trying to fix.In the process Hugo discovers she,coincidentally,has the heart shaped key that is needed to turn the machine on.The key is inserted and the machine comes to life.Hugo is expecting a message from his father but instead a drawing is made of a scene from an old film produced in the late 1800s by George Melies.They both return to the girls home and present the drawing to her god-mother who wants them to forget about it.Just then she hears her husband waking up and the children are shuffled into a side room.They search for the diary while in there and find a heavy box hidden in a secret drawer in the top of an old armoire.The chair she stands on collapses and the box and her come tumbling down.Papers scatter everywhere,but all have drawings from other scenes of Melies films.The old man enters the room and can only sit despondent at the supposed betrayal Hugo has perpetrated.The children return to the bookseller wanting to know the best place to find books on old film making.They end up at a specific area at the local library and while reading one particular chapter in a book about George Melies,it dawns on them that her god-father is none other than George Melies himself.Suddenly a stranger appears behind them,who turns out to be the very author of the book they are reading.He asks about their interest in Melies and she tells him her god father is he.The author is incredulous but nonetheless takes the chance and returns home with the children.As soon as her god mother opens the door the author,who met both her and Melies when he was a child,recognizes her instantly.He expresses his gratitude for Mr.Melies inspiration,who is at the moment sleeping.Before parting he gently asks whether she would like to see one of her husbands works.She acquiesces and before long the projector is ticking away,frame by magical frame,the only known remaining print of a George Melies film.They all sit in amazement and when the film ends Mr Melies walks in on them.He instantly starts recalling in brief his career in film making with his wife,and the calamity that led to him having to sell his films for scrap and burning all his sets.He thought no one cared any longer.Hugo excuses himself to return to the train station to retrieve the automaton.Along the way he gets arrested by a station gendarme who has been dogging him constantly.When Hugo fails to return promptly Mr Melies and his god daughter return to the station and rescue Hugo just in time.It turns out the automaton he and Hugos father work so judiciously on for so long,originally belonged to Melies himself,who was also a tinkerer and an inventor.He had donated the automaton to the museum,but when the fire destroyed it he assumed it has been lost also.The film ends as the author introduces Melies to a packed audience,who are there to watch again Melies works that have been rediscovered and lovingly restored.Hugo has found a new home and life with the Melies family and the film fades out as we stare at the automaton;the very thing that brought a man and his son close together and has now brought Hugo a whole new life.As much as the film is a children's adventure,it is also a marvelous educational tool.The film's own subject matter,the French film pioneer George Melie's and his works,which are on prominent display off and on throughout,are absolutely marvelous to look at.On top of this we have a myriad of references to stars of the 20s such as Douglas Fairbanks,Max Linder,Charly Chase,while we actually see Buster Keaton,Charlie Chaplin and especially Harold Lloyd doing his thing in Safety Last.We also get the point of the neglect of film over time and what we have lost,and what we need to do to protect it in order to ensure their longevity or just plain existence.The film also has some neat touches such as the guitar player in a band at the station,who more than likely is a Django Reinhardt reference.So much going on in this film,but all lovingly wrapped up in what essentially is a

1374915,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B003Y5H5H4,Robin Friedman,"[6, 7]","Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" is a beautiful to watch period piece of a movie.  Set in 1931 in a large Paris railroad station, the movie is a coming of age story for its young protagonist, Hugo Cabret and his friend, Isabelle.  Hugo is an orphan who lives in a garrett in the upper reaches of the train system and survives largely by petty thefts.  He also has great mechanical talent and is working on restoring a mysterious automaton that his father, before his death, had recovered from a museum where it had been stashed in a corner and ignored. Much of the movie centers on young Hugo and his friend arriving at a sense of where their lives will take them.""Hugo"" also is a celebration of the power of the imagination as displayed in the early history of the movies. As the story develops Hugo meets an old pioneer of the movies, Georges, who has been reduced to operating a toy stand in the station. In his young days, Georges had been a magician and then a producer of movies in a palace-like setting.  The movies frequently starred his wife, Mamma Jeanne.A third broad theme of the movie is redemption.  Georges, embittered by the loss of his film career and by the apparent indifference of the public towards his efforts receives through his acquaintance with Hugo a measure of recognition and understanding.The use of 3D movies, replete with the goggles, has all the elements of gimmickry but in Hugo the gimmick works. The goggles help capture the large scenes of clockwork and moving parts in the film as well as the several scenes filmed precariously far from the ground.  Through music and lighting as well, the film captures the ambience of Paris and a busy railway station replete with an officious police inspector and many of the shopkeepers at the station.  Subplots and love interests add much to the story.With all the excellent acting and effects in the movie, its main focus for me was in its director, Martin Scorsese.  Many of his movies, including ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", and ""The Gangs of New York"" with their focus on the raw, violent character of urban life moved me greatly over the years. In contrast to most of Scorsese's work, ""Hugo"" has an endearing lightness.  It is a movie of creativity, redemption, and hope.Robin Friedman",5,A Journey of Imagination,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,2260,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Hugo', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'period', 'piece', 'movie', 'Set', '1931', 'large', 'Paris', 'railroad', 'station', 'movie', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'young', 'protagonist', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'friend', 'Isabelle', 'Hugo', 'orphan', 'who', 'garrett', 'upper', 'reaches', 'train', 'system', 'largely', 'petty', 'thefts', 'also', 'great', 'mechanical', 'talent', 'working', 'restoring', 'mysterious', 'automaton', 'father', 'death', 'had', 'recovered', 'museum', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'stashed', 'corner', 'ignored', 'Much', 'movie', 'centers', 'young', 'Hugo', 'friend', 'arriving', 'sense', 'where', 'lives', 'will', 'take', 'Hugo', 'also', 'celebration', 'power', 'imagination', 'displayed', 'early', 'history', 'movies', 'story', 'Hugo', 'meets', 'old', 'pioneer', 'movies', 'Georges', 'who', 'been', 'reduced', 'operating', 'toy', 'stand', 'station', 'young', 'days', 'Georges', 'had', 'been', 'magician', 'then', 'producer', 'movies', 'palace-like', 'setting', 'movies', 'frequently', 'starred', 'wife', 'Mamma', 'Jeanne.A', 'third', 'broad', 'theme', 'movie', 'redemption', 'Georges', 'embittered', 'loss', 'film', 'career', 'apparent', 'indifference', 'public', 'towards', 'efforts', 'acquaintance', 'Hugo', 'measure', 'recognition', 'understanding.The', 'use', '3D', 'movies', 'replete', 'goggles', 'elements', 'gimmickry', 'Hugo', 'gimmick', 'goggles', 'help', 'capture', 'large', 'scenes', 'clockwork', 'moving', 'parts', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'precariously', 'far', 'ground', 'music', 'lighting', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'ambience', 'Paris', 'busy', 'railway', 'station', 'replete', 'officious', 'police', 'inspector', 'many', 'shopkeepers', 'station', 'Subplots', 'love', 'interests', 'add', 'much', 'story.With', 'excellent', 'acting', 'effects', 'movie', 'main', 'focus', 'was', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Many', 'movies', 'including', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'focus', 'raw', 'violent', 'character', 'urban', 'life', 'moved', 'greatly', 'years', 'contrast', 'most', 'Scorsese', 'work', 'Hugo', 'endearing', 'lightness', 'movie', 'creativity', 'redemption', 'hope.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A
1374916,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B003Y5H5H4,Robin Simmons,"[4, 7]","Martin Scorsese's beautiful film based on Brian Selznic's ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" (screenplay by Josh Logan) is full of gears and timepieces both large and small.  It's riddled with a rich, porous, dream-like fabric that in the end is a celebration of the birth of cinema itself.The story, set in 1930s Paris, is about Hugo, a fatherless boy whose drunken uncle brings him to the train station and teaches him how to run the giant clocks.  The kid is a natural, having learned the mechanics of maintenance and repair from his father.  So when his uncle disappears, Hugo keeps the clocks running.  Always on the run from a station inspector who collects strays and sends them to an orphanage, Hugo eventually becomes involved with an elderly toy merchant and discovers a secret about the man, birth of cinema as an art form and why movies are dreams made real (or at least reel).The 3-D, which I usually hate, is magnificent and most appropriate here.  It greatly enhances the film's extraordinary, multi-layered, dreamy patina from start to finish. And make no mistake, the 2-D version is more than fine.  Steam Punk fans will also find a vibe to enjoy in this sometimes slow, uneven, but heartfelt and beautiful celebration of why movies matter.

1374918,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003Y5H5H4,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Melding elements of both Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger into a single character, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a homeless orphan who lives surreptitiously inside a great train station in Paris circa 1931. To assuage his loneliness and to give some purpose to his life, he fixes and maintains the station's many elaborate time-pieces - and, to survive, he furtively steals food from the local vendors selling their wares there.A life-affirming departure for the normally dark and brooding Martin Scorsese, ""Hugo"" is such a beautifully crafted work of commercial cinema that I feel a trifle ungrateful for not actually liking it more - though, more accurately perhaps, I should say that I love the final third of the film but have some reservations about what comes before. It is certainly a wonder to behold in terms of its art direction and scenic design, which together help to create a never-never world of Art Deco architecture and breathtaking cityscapes, where the surreal and the real comfortably meet - a fitting visual correlative, as it turns out, for the theme of the film. And it goes without saying that the movie richly merited each of the many awards it earned for its visual accomplishments.Adapted by John Logan from the Brian Selznick novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" ""Hugo"" is at its most magical when it is reveling in and celebrating the pioneer days of filmmaking, particularly the fantastical works of magician and special effects wizard Georges Melies (""A Trip to the Moon""), who is an actual character in the movie (played by Ben Kingsley). It seems, according to the story, that Melies left filmmaking an embittered, forgotten has-been and now owns a toy booth in the very train station that Hugo calls home. One fateful day, Hugo and Melies' paths cross - and so the adventure begins...Given all these quality elements, what then are my objections to the film? Primarily, they rest in the fact that, as a central figure, Hugo is too lacking in fire and passion to generate much interest for the audience; that the secondary characters - particularly Sacha Baron Cohen as a war-ravaged security guard - come across more as live-action cartoon figures than as real people; and that the storytelling and pacing in the first half of the film often lag behind the visual stimulation. All these work as distancing devices that keep us from becoming as fully engaged in the plot and the world of the film as we perhaps would like to - until the last third, that is.And that final third winds up making all the difference, as it brings together the movie's disparate elements into a unifying theme of fixing that which is broken - be it a mechanical device or the human heart. This theme is reflected in the film's visual motif of endless machines, both those that are functional and those that are in need of repair.  And Scorsese's meticulous re-creation of Melies' classic works is indeed a wonder to behold.There is one glaring anachronism, however: though the story is set in 1931, Hugo at one point makes reference to having seen Errol Flynn in ""Robin Hood,"" a movie that wasn't released until 1938!

The movie is at its best when it focuses on M&eacute;li&egrave;s.

I loved how the ending tied everything together into one satisfying conclusion. After watching it, I learned that the movie did accurately portray M&eacute;li&egrave;s' life, including the fact that he was raising a granddaughter and that he was given a tribute later in his life.On the downside, the movie tries too hard to be whimsical and fantastical. Paris is portrayed as so gloomy and dark, and the scenery was a little too ""steam punk"" for my taste.

Not just a place to hide, it's his world, of comings and goings, gears and pulleys, staircases and hidden entrances.  But it has its own cast--a wicked police inspector, a couple trying to get to know each other, and a mysterious toymaker.As if this weren't enough, there's an even more mysterious ""automaton""--a mechanical man--that Hugo is trying to repair, mostly using parts pilfered from the toymaker.One day Hugo is caught stealing, and...away we go, into a world of adventure and lost dreams, visions and glory faded and brought back to life.I don't want to spoil the viewing experience by giving away too much; I'll just say that the movie effortlessly sweeps into a story about the early days of movies and one of its early pioneers (many of whose images are still with us today).But I will say that I was transported.

Sure, the film itself is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're just looking for reference quality, mind-blowing 3D? This movie will suck you in from start to finish. You are a part of the world of Hugo, from beginning to end. And, honestly, no 3D has been this engrossing since Avatar.

Most of the acting consists of close up shows of the boy's face and having him stare wide blue-eyed at something.  Characters in the movie are pretty flat.  Not sure if this is a result of the acting or of the writing.  Certainly, the inspector character is quite tiresome and very dully / poorly acted.  Additionally some of the periphery characters such as the two with dogs, or the flower girl are as about as cardboard cut-out as you can get.  Certainly a little better writing could have gone into these characters.  It is also a little disturbing that the movie was set in Paris, but everyone is speaking English.

1374946,A3AV2POFIQ7LEY,B003Y5H5H4,SoulThief,"[1, 1]","There is so much about this film that I love, and yet I imagine many would not. Other reviewers have explored the film's story-line and themes, its wonderful cinematography and such. Let me instead describe my family and our reception of this film and, if there is something of us in you, then perhaps this is a film you should buy and watch.My family consists of myself, my wife and my 8 year old daughter. I am a middle-aged man, well educated with a passion for history, art, science fiction. I love old science fiction (novels and film), visit museums, and enjoy family life. My wife, educated in accounting and computer science, also enjoys museums and art galleries, and loves shows such as Star Trek: the Next Generation, Doctor Who and the X-Files and so on. My young daughter, alas, has been indoctrinated into all things fantastic, from Lost in Space to fairies and the things we (her parents) love.For each of us the film was captivating. The colours in the film evoked the past in a manner that was quite magical. The music was subtle and compelling. The characters... I am not sure how to describe them. Each had little stories that were progressing through the film - stories that ultimately were about belonging or companionship. Somehow the manner in which these were portrayed evoked something of the mechanised panoramas sometimes seen in department stores at Christmas. I mean this in a good way. The construction of the film, from the juxtaposition of past and present (the film's past and present that is) to the use of cinematic effects, was marvellous.The principal story did pull at heart strings. It was all part of a very strong theme about loneliness and salvation from it.I also enjoyed the acting, though I have seen some reviews criticise it. The leads were excellent in my opinion. As an aside, Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the station security at times evoked humourous memories of the policeman in Allo Allo. Yet I enjoyed this because it was the perfect mask for the fragility he sometimes let us see in his character.Once the film was done, I meandered to my bookcases and pulled down some of my books on the history of science fiction and was able to show my family some pictures portrayed in the film. My daughter was delighted that much of it was based on truth.I know this sounds like I am engaging in some form of hubris and saying that you must be like my family to enjoy this film. But that is not so. I think any person who enjoys a simple but compelling tale told in a magical manner will love this film. However, if you are like us then I feel there is a good likelihood that you will enjoy it and therefore should buy it.",5,I just keep watching it,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2671,"['so', 'much', 'film', 'love', 'yet', 'imagine', 'many', 'would', 'not', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'explored', 'film', 'story-line', 'themes', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'such', 'Let', 'instead', 'describe', 'family', 'reception', 'film', 'something', 'then', 'perhaps', 'film', 'should', 'buy', 'watch.My', 'family', 'wife', '8', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'am', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'well', 'educated', 'passion', 'history', 'art', 'science', 'fiction', 'love', 'old', 'science', 'fiction', 'novels', 'film', 'visit', 'museums', 'enjoy', 'family', 'life', 'My', 'wife', 'educated', 'accounting', 'computer', 'science', 'also', 'museums', 'art', 'galleries', 'shows', 'such', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'X-Files', 'so', 'young', 'daughter', 'alas', 'been', 'indoctrinated', 'things', 'fantastic', 'Lost', 'Space', 'fairies', 'things', 'parents', 'love.For', 'film', 'was', 'captivating', 'colours', 'film', 'evoked', 'past', 'manner', 'was', 'quite', 'magical', 'music', 'was', 'subtle', 'compelling', 'characters', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'describe', 'had', 'little', 'stories', 'were', 'progressing', 'film', 'stories', 'ultimately', 'were', 'belonging', 'companionship', 'Somehow', 'manner', 'were', 'portrayed', 'evoked', 'something', 'mechanised', 'panoramas', 'sometimes', 'seen', 'department', 'stores', 'Christmas', 'mean', 'good', 'way', 'construction', 'film', 'juxtaposition', 'past', 'present', 'film', 'past', 'present', 'use', 'cinematic', 'effects', 'was', 'marvellous.The', 'principal', 'story', 'did', 'pull', 'heart', 'strings', 'was', 'part', 'very', 'strong', 'theme', 'loneliness', 'salvation', 'it.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'have', 'seen', 'reviews', 'criticise', 'leads', 'were', 'excellent', 'opinion', 'aside', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'portrayal', 'station', 'security', 'times', 'evoked', 'humourous', 'memories', 'policeman', 'Allo', 'Allo', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'perfect', 'mask', 'fragility', 'let', 'see', 'character.Once', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'meandered', 'bookcases', 'pulled', 'down', 'books', 'history', 'science', 'fiction', 'was', 'able', 'show', 'family', 'pictures', 'portrayed', 'film', 'daughter', 'was', 'delighted', 'much', 'was', 'based', 'truth.I', 'know', 'am', 'engaging', 'form', 'hubris', 'saying', 'must', 'be', 'family', 'enjoy', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'think', 'person', 'who', 'simple', 'compelling', 'tale', 'told', 'magical', 'manner', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'However', 'are', 'then', 'feel', 'good', 'likelihood', 'will', 'enjoy', 'therefore', 'should', 'buy']",N/A
1374947,A22QBZ3XB2ZS2Z,B003Y5H5H4,space&amp;time,"[41, 184]","Very dissapointing movie!  Classic paid off ""Hollywood Elite"".  I had read all the reviews before going with my family to see this long and very boring movie, and we all expected something incredible.  That was not the case.  My 3 kids fell asleep before the 1/2 way point.  My college son, asked if he could leave and see something else after 25 minutes.  This is the honest take on this movie.  You don't have to make up a bunch of B.S. to justify wasting your time sitting thru this movie.  This is not a kid's film or a family film.  You have to like long, drawn out, narrative, European-like documentaries in order to like this movie.Both my husband and I have read the book, along with our kids, and this director took way too many ""off-roads"" from the original story.  The boy was also younger in the book and numerous aspects were changed.  In addition, 1/2 way thru the story, the movie shifts away from Hugo's story to Ben Kingsly's character being the center of attention, and both of them didn't do a very good acting job.  I don't mind a director's twist on a story, but be honest and cop to it in a review...no one comments on that.  If you want to do an adaptation, then do it correctly or at the very least acknowledge your changing it for Hollywood.Also, this is a French story, why aren't the actors speaking French or at the very least have French accents!  That lost everything for me.  You go to a restaurant and order a steak but they give you chicken, ""hey that's o.k. cause it's artsy chicken and that justifies and substitutes for steak?""  I don't think so!  Sasha Cohen did a mediocre impersonation of Peter Sellers as inspector Clouseau. But at least Sellers had a French accent!Hugo Cabret is French, the actor who played him spoke ""British English"" so did all the other main characters...Wheres the great acting there?  At a cost of $180,000,000 dollars they couldn't hire a French accent coach?  Wheres the masterpiece of acting there? It isn't even true to character.  I don't quite get that.  If you realize and then accept the fact that all the main characters spoke heavy ""British English"" and everyone who comments positively on this movie, ignores that critical aspect entirely.  How can you justify yourself being an individual thinker if you can't even acknowledge that important aspect.Asa Butterfield was so monotone and un-engaging.  His performance was so ""ho hum"" they could have found a much better kid actor in Hollywood and not have to go to Great Britan to find this lousy kid actor.  Not once did any of us feel any compassion for this kid.  Not once did this kid actor engender a connection between his audience and himself.  Jude Law is in the movie for a ""blink"" of a moment.  Chloe Moretz is American, she doesn't speak British English, so if they had a coach, why wasn't she speaking with a French Accent?  Or did they hire her solely for her French last name?  That would have been real acting, as a French character if she actually spoke with a French accent.Everyone talks about how incredible the 3D is, well for $180,000,000.00 I would expect to see ""gold"" flying out of the screen.  Hey don't get me wrong, the animation sets are very pretty.  But this movie is all computer animated farce. Since when did artificiality become artistic?  And this your reviewers call ""artsy, fartsy"", cinema verte'?  How does that justifies so many major flaws and exclusions in the movie?  I don't think so. In a movie where the characters were born and live in France, why aren't they apeaking in a French Accent?  That's ridiculous.  That lost all credibility for me.In addition, I see nowhere that any of the Reviewers make one comment about the fact that for kids to see this movie where the main character spends 1/2 his time stealing food, toys, parts, etc., yet no reviewers comment on this?  This is what my kids should see and be told is great artistry?  Baloney!  In other movies where a kid is unlikeable because he behaves selfishly, the reviewers are all over it and spouting paragraphs about such a despicable character portrayal even if that is the character in the book.  But, with Hugo Cabret - directed by Martin Scorsese, if you put the lable ""artsy"" on a $180,000,000 dollar long and boring ""flop"" of a movie, then it's elevated to ""g_dlike status.  What a joke!If this was any other movie besides a Scorsese, your reviewers and professional reviewers would have attacked everything wrong about this movie and pointed out all these issues.  Instead most of you just ignored all of these important issues under the guise of ""masterpiece, artistry, Scorsese, etc, etc.etc.  But all of you who think it's just wonderful obviously can't think or react for yourselves.None of you make one comment about these important issues, which are very critical to the story itself.  Yet you rush to defend every sentence of your ""mind-blown"" experience of this movie.  Think about it.  This is Hollywood bought at it's best.  In 2 1/2 months the movie has barely made $55,000,000 dollars in revenue and it cost more than $180,000,000.00.  It was expected to be a big hit in Europe because of it's French story background and it has bombed overseas!!  So it has bombed in America and also in Europe.  So I guess that justifies Academy Award status for the Hollywood ""weirdo elite"".I would think twice about seeing this one before it comes out on DVD for 1/2 price.  And who said the Academy Awards weren't a bought off scheme of Hollywood.  Yeah, how does this movie get nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, but none of the actors are nominated for their acting?  How can you have a best movie based on the characters, but none of the characters were important enough to get nominated for an Academy Award?  Just more games  They understand it's just another way to increase revenue and payoffs!  I would expect that as much money has been spent on marketing this movie as the cost itself.  Look at the marketing games being played out on this movie which started more than 9 months ago.  Guess what, nominations and biased awards doesn't mean anything and definitely won't save this movie!",1,BOREDOM AND HYPOCRACY FOR A HUGE TICKET PRICE!,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,6144,"['Very',

A boy (Asa Butterfield) peers out through a clock at the goings-on in a railroad terminal in the 1930s. He is trying to survive by stealing food, but he's also trying to repair an automaton that his father (Jude Law) has brought home from the museum in which he works. The boy's life becomes intertwined with that of an old man (Ben Kingsley), who owns a toy shop, and his goddaughter (Chlo Grace Moretz). The boy also loves the films of the time and becomes interested in the first films, which were produced in France by the Lumi&egrave;re brothers and Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s at the turn of the twentieth century. The recreations of the efforts of these pioneers are breathtaking, as are examples of their films shown in Hugo.

Brian Selznick was raised in nearby East Brunswick, New Jersey where he went to high school. He became a successful children's book illustrator. With his own genius in illustrations, he has developed a story with beautiful visuals. Martin Scorsese's daughter wanted her father to adapt the book into a movie. It became an award winning hit with critics and audiences alike. This film is about 2 hours long with a terrific cast including Sir Ben Kingsley; Sir Christopher Lee; Richard Griffiths; Frances De La Tour; and Sasha Baron Cohen.The acting is great but the art direction is first rate with attention paid to every detail. The story takes place in a Parisian train station between World War I and World War II. Hugo encounters Georges Melies, a toy shop owner at the station. Their encounter leads to an unlikely friendship. Secrets, revelations, and truths emerge slowly but masterfully as always under Martin Scorsese.This film shows Scorsese's range as a film maker with an emphasis on details. Scorsese takes the audience to a magical place in film making where the audience can be captivated by the cinematic beauty onscreen.If I have one complaint, it is that this DVD doesn't have any extras like a behind the scenes or documentary style of adapting the book to the screen.

I do like the ""classic"" movies that are non-action / adventure, but I did not think Hugo would ever make it into that category.  My wife saw it in the theater with my two boys, and even her characterization of the movie was ""It was OK.""  She said ""I liked it, but I don't think you will.""  Thus, I did not make watching this movie a priority.  Then, after reading previews, reviews and descriptions about Hugo before watching it, I still thought this would be a movie I would not be overly interested in.  Wow, was I ever wrong!I finally watched it for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and Hugo is simply a brilliant movie.  I liked every minute and every aspect of the movie.  The plot is not overly complicated, but the attention to detail, the nuances of most every scene, the acting performances turned in by the cast make the movie very special.  Everything about the movie is outstanding and result in making the simple plot shine in its genius.The scenes in the train station have so many ""layers"" - you can play back each scene and pick things up you did not see the first or second time, and marvel at the attention to detail.  Each scene is well thought out and executed with a touch that makes it special.  There is literally something for everyone in this movie - no matter your age group - this movie appeals to those of all ages.  That in itself says a lot about the universal quality of this film.  It appeals to the younger generation since it has children in the lead role; and to the older generation due to it's historical aspect of movie making.I can see how some who go to the movies for action, adventure may not appreciate this film, but if you enjoy a movie that pays attention to detail, attempts to marvel the senses with interesting scenes and props, then you will thoroughly enjoy Hugo.  It is truly a special film.  Martin Scorsese shows his versatility with this film.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the cinema and it's history, and to anyone that enjoys innovative scenes and great acting.

1374986,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003Y5H5H4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","On the surface Martin Scorsese's latest film ""Hugo"" appears to be a family-oriented adventure film about a boy named Hugo following his dreams. In fact, ""Hugo"" is more like the director's love letter to cinema of old (silent movies) and new (3D technologies). And it is a very passionate one. If you remember Martin Scorsese's dedication to the movement of film preservation, it is not surprising.Having lost his father in a fire, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is brought to the station by his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a clock maintainer with a bottle in his hand. While living alone inside the walls of the station, Hugo dreams of fixing an old automaton, the only thing that connects the boy to his dead father, but to do so he needs a heart-shaped key. One day he meets the very person who literally holds the key, a girl named Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz).Set in the 1930s Paris, the story of ""Hugo"" slowly leads us to the past of one aged toyshop keeper and Isabelle's godfather played by Ben Kingsley. We eventually come to know who he is, uncovering his buried past memories through the eye of Hugo.This means you are invited to the spiritual journey of an orphan boy Hugo, but Scorsese's film is not about him; Hugo is there, together with incredible coincidences and contrived storyline, so that we can share his experiences of revisiting what is once thought lost, the cinematic imagination of Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, through the world of state-of-the-art special effects.Thus ""Hugo"" is not an adventure film. If you think story is slow-moving and dull, and characters flat (with two exceptions Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his wife played by excellent Helen McCrory), that is because the real star is not Hugo; it is cinema of old days, recreated by the newest technologies. Since I like old films (my favorite is Buster Keaton, though), I give four stars, but I also think paying more attention to characters of Hugo and Isabelle, and narrative structure is not a bad idea.",4,Martin Scorsese's Love Letter to the World of Cinema,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1999,"['surface', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'latest', 'film', 'Hugo', 'be', 'family-oriented', 'adventure', 'film', 'boy', 'named', 'Hugo', 'following', 'dreams', 'fact', 'Hugo', 'more', 'director', 'love', 'letter', 'cinema', 'old', 'silent', 'movies', 'new', '3D', 'technologies', 'very', 'passionate', 'one', 'remember', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'dedication', 'movement', 'film', 'preservation', 'not', 'surprising.Having', 'lost', 'father', 'fire', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'brought', 'station', 'uncle', 'Claude', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'clock', 'maintainer', 'bottle', 'hand', 'living', 'alone', 'walls', 'station', 'Hugo', 'dreams', 'fixing', 'old', 'automaton', 'only', 'thing', 'boy', 'dead', 'father', 'do', 'so', 'heart-shaped', 'key', 'One', 'day', 'very', 'person', 'who', 'literally', 'key', 'girl', 'named', 'Isabelle', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', '.Set', '1930s', 'Paris', 'story', 'Hugo', 'slowly', 'past', 'one', 'aged', 'toyshop', 'keeper', 'Isabelle', 'godfather', 'played', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'eventually', 'come', 'know', 'who', 'uncovering', 'buried', 'past', 'memories', 'eye', 'Hugo.This', 'are', 'invited', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'orphan', 'boy', 'Hugo', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'not', 'Hugo', 'there', 'together', 'incredible', 'coincidences', 'contrived', 'storyline', 'can', 'share', 'experiences', 'revisiting', 'what', 'once', 'thought', 'lost', 'cinematic', 'imagination', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'world', 'state-of-the-art', 'special', 'effects.Thus', 'Hugo', 'not', 'adventure', 'film', 'think', 'story', 'slow-moving', 'dull', 'characters', 'flat', 'two', 'exceptions', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'wife', 'played', 'excellent', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'real', 'star', 'not', 'Hugo', 'cinema', 'old', 'days', 'recreated', 'newest', 'technologies', 'like', 'old', 'films', 'favorite', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'though', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'also', 'think', 'paying', 'more', 'attention', 'characters', 'Hugo', 'Isabelle', 'narrative', 'structure', 'not', 'bad', 'idea']",N/A
1374987,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003Y5H5H4,Turfseer,"[4, 10]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who believe that 'Hugo' is all about the title character, think again. Martin Scorsese only uses a fanciful child's tale to arrive at his true intent: a tribute to film pioneer, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. Visually, one can argue that the film is a tour de force, with some fantastic special effects as well as a sumptuous score, but until we arrive at said tribute, Scorsese's tale lacks the requisite tension and charm.The film starts off rather nicely as Scorsese takes us into the heart of a Paris train station, circa 1930. We meet Hugo, an orphan, who's being raised by his alcoholic uncle, after Hugo's watchmaker father is killed in a fire. The uncle teaches Hugo how to maintain the vast array of clocks, hidden inside the station but their relationship remains completely underdeveloped. The real tension is supposed to be between Hugo and the autocratic station inspector (awkwardly played by Sacha Baron Cohen), who is bent on sending the orphan away to a reform school. Scorsese relies on a series of slapstick chase scenes between Hugo and the inspector to move the plot along, and adults should not find much interest in such shenanigans.The connection between Hugo and M&eacute;li&egrave;s is made through a keepsake bequeathed to Hugo from his father. It's an 'automaton', a mechanical man which the father could not get to work, and now Hugo has taken to stealing mechanical parts from a toy store owned by M&eacute;li&egrave;s, now a virtual recluse, in the hope that those parts will enable him to start the device up. M&eacute;li&egrave;s ends up confiscating Hugo's notebook, which contains drawings of the Automaton and his efforts to repair it. Eventually, M&eacute;li&egrave;s hires Hugo to work in the toy store, in order to pay off the debt for the mechanical parts he stole from the store.Hugo finally gets the Automaton to operate when he discovers that M&eacute;li&egrave;s' goddaughter, Isabelle, is wearing the key (that starts the device), around her neck. Wouldn't you know it but the Automaton draws a screen shot from M&eacute;li&egrave;s' most famous film, 'A Trip to the Moon', proving that the ""great man"" is still alive (unbeknownst to an indifferent public). The two kids manage (with the help of a kindly film historian), to bring M&eacute;li&egrave;s back into the public eye, and M&eacute;li&egrave;s ends up getting the recognition he ""deserves"", from the French film society.In the best part of the film, Scorsese shines, as he offers up a film hagiography of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' career. The flashback, which includes how M&eacute;li&egrave;s actually created 'A Trip to the Moon', features that glass house, where the pioneer's seminal feature film, was made. Nonetheless, one gets the feeling that Scorsese's embrace of the past, has gone too far. The reverence for M&eacute;li&egrave;s has gotten to the point where Scorsese has placed the film pioneer, on a saintly pedestal. Yes, he is an important figure in the history of cinema and he was extremely talented, especially in a day when film was in its infancy and no one had yet grasped the concept of film as spectacle --but M&eacute;li&egrave;s was still a product of his time, and those ancient images belong in the context of the times they were made in. If it was up to Scorsese, M&eacute;li&egrave;s would be placed in the same pantheon as Shakespeare and Dickens; but M&eacute;li&egrave;s' films were not designed to appeal to the intellect. M&eacute;li&egrave;s' appeal to Scorsese is on the technical level and that's why he admires him so much. To a certain extent, there's nothing wrong in that. But for Scorsese to expect the average film goer to worship M&eacute;li&egrave;s as some kind of film 'deity', I would suggest he's gone a little too far out on a limb.Karina Longworth, in her review of 'Hugo' in the Village Voice, sums it up best by arguing that the 'ticking clocks' are the true antagonist in the film: ""In the story of M&eacute;li&egrave;s's life as recounted by Scorsese--and by extension, the story of the movies--time is the enemy that alters the tastes of audiences, decays film prints, and turns today's fetish objects into tomorrow's relics.""'Hugo' in many ways, feels more like a documentary in parts than a clever children's story, fraught with conflict. The conflict here is manufactured and the two child actors end up with little to do except act as impresarios for the M&eacute;li&egrave;s main act. Relationships here are never really developed or explored and we're asked by Scorsese, to simply applaud the hagiography. If you were to take out all the spoken dialogue in the film and leave only the musical soundtrack, you wouldn't miss much. Perhaps, ironically, that's what Scorsese was really aiming for: a stunning visual tribute, to the technical wizardry of an early film pioneer.",2,"Scorsese's clever but sycophantic tribute to early

1374999,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B003Y5H5H4,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 5]","""Hugo"" based on the popular kid's novel is an odd film; its not a project I would expect Martin Scorsese to helm but I have to give him credit for trying such an unusual project given his past films (Taxi Driver [Blu-ray], GoodFellas [Blu-ray]) and stretching himself as an artist with a genre he's never tackled before--a fantasy children's film.SPOILERS:Hugo (Asa Butterfield) the orphaned son of a clockmaker (Jude Law) lives above the train station in Paris tending to the large clock. Hugo tries to unravel the mystery of an automaton that his father was working on just before his death and spars with the bitter owner of a small gift shop named Melies (Ben Kingsley)while on the run run from the station inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen). Hugo finds an unlikely ally in Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz from Let Me In [Blu-ray])as they search for the key that will wind up the automaton so they can discover what, exactly, it was designed for.END OF SPOILERS:A movie that is as much about the history of film, the redemption of Melies and who, exactly, build the automaton, Scorsese creates a lush, lovely looking film filled with some truly stunning set pieces (particularly a computer generated train crash that looks amazing)but is undone by the languid pacing of the film which fails to generate much suspense. While I didn't expect the attention deficit cutting style of, say, Michael Bay, I did expect a more involving experience.The screenplay by John Logan (based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick)fails to generate characters with much depth (beyond Melies and even then he comes across as just a grumpy ""get off of my lawn"" old man who wants nothing more than to nail Hugo). Certainly Hugo is portrayed sympathetically he is, after all, an orphan and, at times, a bit of a scamp always trying to find food and stay off the radar of the station inspector who is always looking to catch a stray kid.The truth is that I found little in ""Hugo"" to identify with and my kids just couldn't appreciate the fantasy elements of the film. Visually rich, ""Hugo"" only has the wisp of a plot to hang the rest of the film on. While the performances are solid throughout by the actors, Logan's script uses cliched characters that just don't draw us in.I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get a commentary track from director Scorsese. His insights on what appealed to him about the project, shooting it and the challenges of taking a popular children's book and adapting it to the big screen would have been interesting.We get four featurettes on the production of the film and a fifth one that's a bit of a joke about actor/comedian Sasha Baron Cohen. The making of featurette provides little insight into the making of the film. ""The Cinemagician, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s"" is the best of the featurettes giving us a bit of insight into the cinematic world of the talented, groundbreaking visionary and brilliant filmmaker who almost ended up forgotten by many due to the fact that his films weren't in circulation for a long period of time.The featurette on the visual effects is pretty fascinating glimpse into the creation of the train crash scene. Finally the featurette on the automaton and their popularity during the late part of the 19th and early part of the 20th century is a pretty interesting glimpse into these robotic devices.Given all the praise the movie received, I'm surprised that there aren't more special features as part of this set (given that most are produced prior to the release of a film).Rather than do a blind buy, I'd recommend renting ""Hugo"" first to see if it's a film that appeals to your sensibility. I would approach the film without expectations (given Scorsese's name that may not be possible but try) and, perhaps, you'll enjoy it a bit more than I and my kids did. With all the praise the film received (which honestly was difficult to ignore), perhaps I was blinded to the appeal of ""Hugo"". I suspect I'll have to try it again after a little while to see if my take on the material divorced of expectations were inaccurate and colored my view on the film.I'd recommend going with the Blu-ray if you decide to pick this up because although the DVD looks nice it just doesn't do justice to the rich, lush look of the film.",3,Spectacular imagery in story about the redemption of an old man and salvation of an orphaned boy,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,4288,"['Hugo', 'based', 'popular', 'kid', 'novel', 'odd', 'film', 'not', 'project', 'would', 'expect', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'helm', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'trying', 'unusual', 'project', 'given', 'past', 'films', 'Taxi', 'Driver', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'GoodFellas', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'stretching', 'artist', 'genre', 'never', 'tackled', 'before', 'fantasy', 'children', 'film.SPOILERS', 'Hugo', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'orphaned', 'son', 'clockmaker', 'Jude', 'Law', 'train', 'station', 'Paris', 'tending', 'large', 'clock', 'Hugo', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'automaton', 'father', 'was', 'working', 'just', 'death', 'spars', 'bitter', 'owner', 'small', 'gift', 'shop', 'named', 'Melies', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'run', 'run', 'station', 'inspector', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Hugo', 'unlikely', 'ally', 'Isabelle', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Let', 'Me', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'search', 'key', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'automaton', 'can', 'discover', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'designed', 'for.END', 'SPOILERS', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'history', 'film', 'redemption', 'Melies', 'who', 'exactly', 'build', 'automaton', 'Scorsese', 'lush', 'lovely', 'looking', 'film', 'filled', 'truly', 'stunning', 'set', 'pieces', 'particularly', 'computer', 'generated', 'train', 'crash', 'amazing', 'undone', 'languid', 'pacing', 'film', 'generate', 'much', 'suspense', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'attention', 'deficit', 'cutting', 'style', 'say', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'did', 'expect', 'more', 'involving', 'experience.The', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Logan', 'based', 'book', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Brian', 'Selznick', 'generate', 'characters', 'much', 'depth', 'Melies', 'even', 'then', 'as', 'just', 'grumpy', 'get', 'lawn', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'nail', 'Hugo', 'Certainly', 'Hugo', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'orphan', 'times', 'bit', 'scamp', 'always', 'trying', 'find', 'food', 'stay', 'radar', 'station', 'inspector', 'who', 'always', 'looking', 'catch', 'stray', 'kid.The', 'truth', 'found', 'little', 'Hugo', 'identify', 'kids', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'film', 'Visually', 'rich', 'Hugo', 'only', 'wisp', 'plot', 'hang', 'rest', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'actors', 'Logan', 'script', 'cliched', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'draw', 'in.I', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Scorsese', 'insights', 'appealed', 'project', 'shooting', 'challenges', 'taking', 'popular', 'children', 'book', 'adapting', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting.We', 'get', 'four', 'featurettes', 'production', 'film', 'fifth', 'one', 'bit', 'joke', 'actor/comedian', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'making', 'featurette', 'little', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'Cinemagician', 'Georges', 'M', 'eacute', 'egrave', 's', 'best', 'featurettes', 'giving', 'bit', 'insight', 'cinematic', 'world', 'talented', 'groundbreaking', 'visionary', 'brilliant', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'almost', 'ended', 'up', 'forgotten', 'many', 'due', 'fact', 'films', 'were', ""n't"", 'circulation', 'long', 'period', 'time.The', 'featurette', 'visual', 'effects', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'creation', 'train', 'crash', 'scene', 'Finally', 'featurette', 'automaton', 'popularity', 'late', 'part', '19th', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'glimpse', 'robotic', 'devices.Given', 'praise', 'movie', 'received', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'special', 'features', 'part', 'set', 'given', 'most', 'are', 'produced', 'prior', 'release', 'film', '.Rather', 'do', 'blind', 'buy', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'Hugo', 'first', 'see', 'film', 'appeals', 'sensibility', 'would', 'approach', 'film', 'expectations', 'given', 'Scorsese', 'name', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'try', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'bit', 'more', 'kids', 'did', 'praise', 'film', 'received', 'honestly', 'was', 'difficult', 'ignore', 'perhaps', 'was', 'blinded', 'appeal', 'Hugo', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'have', 'try', 'again', 'little', 'while', 'see', 'take', 'material', 'divorced', 'expectations', 'were', 'inaccurate', 'colored', 'view', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'going', 'Blu-ray', 'decide', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'nice', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'rich', 'lush', 'look', 'film']",N/A

1375002,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B003Y5H5H4,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[517, 569]","Different people go to the movies for different reasons.  Some of us want to be entertained. Some of us want to be dazzled. Some of us want to be engaged by a story, or by characters that stick in the mind after the film is done. Some of us want to be transported to a different time or place. And some of us want to see talented actors create a bit of magic in the hands of a masterful director. Martin Scorsese's Hugo does all of these things. It is, more than any other film I've seen this year, _why_ we go to the movies.The film is based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. If you've read the book, then you know the story already, but for everyone else I am going to be careful here and not reveal anything that might spoil the film. I will say that Hugo is about many things, but at its heart, it is about obsession, discovery and how one person's story can lead to - and become entwined with - another's.The film is set in Paris in the 1930's, in a railway station where an orphan boy named Hugo (engagingly played by Asa Butterfield) lives in the workspaces in the station walls and in the station's central clocktower. He spends most of his time keeping the station's clocks running (so that no one will come into the walls or the tower and discover his hiding places) and pursuing his obsession - fixing a man-shaped automaton designed to write with a pen which his father (Jude Law) had found in a museum and was trying to repair when he was killed in a fire. To feed himself, Hugo scrounges and pilfers food from the various food shops in the station, which draws the attention of the station  inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). To feed his efforts to repair the automaton, Hugo steals parts from a toy shop in the station, run by the elderly Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), who finally catches him in the act. He is befriended though by Papa Georges' god-daughter, a girl his age named Isabelle (Chlo Grace Moretz), who ends up helping Hugo pursue his obsession of fixing the automaton. Which, Hugo is convinced, has some secret message for him left by his late father. Where this ultimately leads... you'll have to see the film. Telling you here would only ruin the film's joy of discovery.There are so many good things about Hugo as a film that it's hard to know where to begin. I can at least start by saying that the look of the film itself is dazzling. Scorsese creates worlds within worlds, taking you first back to Paris in the 1930's and from there into Hugo's hidden world within the walls and clock tower of the train station. And from there, other places that are equally wondrous.  The 3D is not wasted here and truly adds to the feel of Hugo's world of narrow passages and massive time-keeping mechanisms with their enormous but intricate gears, springs and pendulums all in motion.  And Howard Shore's beautifully crafted musical score evokes the period throughout the film, adding to the feeling of being transported to a different time and place.Another thing that makes Hugo so worth seeing is that Scorsese is one of those directors who can bring out the best performance an actor has in them, which he does a magnificent job of here, from veteran actors like Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee to comparative newcomers like Asa Butterfield and Chlo Grace Moretz.And just as the look of the sets shows his attention to detail, the populating of the world with characters shows it as well as he makes the train station come alive with its regular denizens, from Sacha Boren Cohen's officious station inspector with his leg brace and the pretty young flower seller Lisette (Emily Mortimer) he secretly yearns for, to the comic attempts at romance between Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), an elderly newspaper seller who keeps attempting to woo Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour), a cafe owner who dotes on her dog who unfortunately attacks Monsieur Frick every time he comes near. Scorsese also works in some famous historical Parisian residents of the period into the background, like jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt (Emil Lager), artist Salvador Dali (Ben Addis) and writer James Joyce (Robert Gill).Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys movies, and an absolute must-see for anyone who loves movies and what they mean to us.",5,_This_ is why we go to the movies,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,4285,"['Different', 'people', 'go', 'movies', 'different', 'reasons', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'want', 'be', 'dazzled', 'want', 'be', 'engaged', 'story', 'characters', 'stick', 'mind', 'film', 'done', 'want', 'be', 'transported', 'different', 'time', 'place', 'want', 'see', 'talented', 'actors', 'create', 'bit', 'magic', 'hands', 'masterful', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Hugo', 'things', 'more', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'go', 'movies.The', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'Brian', 'Selznick', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'then', 'know', 'story', 'already', 'everyone', 'else', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'careful', 'here', 'not', 'reveal', 'anything', 'might', 'spoil', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Hugo', 'about', 'many', 'things', 'heart', 'obsession', 'discovery', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'story', 'can', 'lead', 'become', 'entwined', ""another's.The"", 'film', 'set', 'Paris', '1930', 'railway', 'station', 'where', 'orphan', 'boy', 'named', 'Hugo', 'engagingly', 'played', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'workspaces', 'station', 'walls', 'station', 'central', 'clocktower', 'most', 'time', 'keeping', 'station', 'clocks', 'running', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'walls', 'tower', 'discover', 'hiding', 'places', 'pursuing', 'obsession', 'fixing', 'man-shaped', 'automaton', 'designed', 'write', 'pen', 'father', 'Jude', 'Law', 'had', 'found', 'museum', 'was', 'trying', 'repair', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'fire', 'feed', 'Hugo', 'scrounges', 'pilfers', 'food', 'various', 'food', 'shops', 'station', 'attention', 'station', 'inspector', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'feed', 'efforts', 'repair', 'automaton', 'Hugo', 'steals', 'parts', 'toy', 'shop', 'station', 'run', 'elderly', 'Papa', 'Georges', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'finally', 'act', 'befriended', 'Papa', 'Georges', 'god-daughter', 'girl', 'age', 'named', 'Isabelle', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'who', 'up', 'helping', 'Hugo', 'pursue', 'obsession', 'fixing', 'automaton', 'Which', 'Hugo', 'convinced', 'secret', 'message', 'left', 'late', 'father', 'Where', 'ultimately', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'film', 'Telling', 'here', 'would', 'only', 'ruin', 'film', 'joy', 'discovery.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'about', 'Hugo', 'film', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'can', 'least', 'start', 'saying', 'look', 'film', 'dazzling', 'Scorsese', 'creates', 'worlds', 'worlds', 'taking', 'first', 'back', 'Paris', '1930', 'there', 'Hugo', 'hidden', 'world', 'walls', 'clock', 'tower', 'train', 'station', 'there', 'other', 'places', 'are', 'equally', 'wondrous', '3D', 'not', 'wasted', 'here', 'truly', 'feel', 'Hugo', 'world', 'narrow', 'passages', 'massive', 'time-keeping', 'mechanisms', 'enormous', 'intricate', 'gears', 'springs', 'pendulums', 'motion', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'musical', 'score', 'period', 'film', 'adding', 'feeling', 'being', 'transported', 'different', 'time', 'place.Another', 'thing', 'Hugo', 'so', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Scorsese', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'can', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'performance', 'actor', 'magnificent', 'job', 'here', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'comparative', 'newcomers', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz.And', 'just', 'look', 'sets', 'attention', 'detail', 'populating', 'world', 'characters', 'shows', 'as', 'well', 'train', 'station', 'come', 'alive', 'regular', 'denizens', 'Sacha', 'Boren', 'Cohen', 'officious', 'station', 'inspector', 'leg', 'brace', 'pretty', 'young', 'flower', 'seller', 'Lisette', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'secretly', 'comic', 'attempts', 'romance', 'Monsieur', 'Frick', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'elderly', 'newspaper', 'seller', 'who', 'attempting', 'woo', 'Madame', 'Emile', 'Frances', 'de', 'la', 'Tour', 'cafe', 'owner', 'who', 'dog', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'Monsieur', 'Frick', 'time', 'near', 'Scorsese', 'also', 'famous', 'historical', 'Parisian', 'residents', 'period', 'background', 'jazz', 'guitarist', 'Django', 'Reinhardt', 'Emil', 'Lager', 'artist', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'Ben', 'Addis', 'James', 'Joyce', 'Robert', 'Gill', '.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'absolute', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'what', 'mean']",N/A

I guess there just wasn't enough drug use, car crashes, rape, and disemboweling to hold the reviewer's attention.I have two not-unreasonable complaints. The story starts off as a tale about an orphaned child trying to recover his life, then turns into a biography of one of motion pictures' great pioneers. The forced, ""necessary"" quality of the latter doesn't sit well with the ""poetic"" quality of the former.

1375008,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003Y5H5H4,Z Hayes,"[6, 8]","Having read and loved Brian Selznick'sThe Invention of Hugo Cabret, I was eager to see the film adaptation, especially in the hands of uber director Martin Scorcese. He does not disappoint - this movie far exceeded my expectations, and I actually loved it even more than the book. It was like whatever I had imagined while reading the book (which has lots of graphics btw) was brought to life, only even better!My husband and I took our almost seven-year-old daughter to view this and she was riveted. It is difficult to imagine any child or adult not being captivated by the visuals in this movie. They are truly magical, and though my daughter is obviously too young to get some of the subtler undertones and themes in the movie, she was able to appreciate the visuals and follow the basic premise of the movie.The story itself is one that tugs at one's heartstrings and imagination. Young Hugo Cabret (finely nuanced performance by Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who has lost his father (played by Jude Law) in a fire and is now living on his wits, keeping the clocks running in a large train station in 1930s Paris. His uncle is the real timekeeper, but for a large portion of the movie, we do not know where the drunk has got to. Hugo's father was a clockmaker and had been restoring an old automaton, an object of fascination for both father and son. Upon his father's death, Hugo takes over the automaton, and tries to get it to work, using his dad's notebook as a guide. He steals parts from wherever he can, including the store of Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), who catches him in the act one day, and becomes irate with anger when he sees the notebook.Over a period of time, young Hugo forms a friendship with Papa Georges' goddaughter, the orphan Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), and the pair discover some of Papa Georges' long-buried secrets. Hugo is in peril though, as the station inspector, Gustaf (Sasha Baron Cohen) holds no tolerance for young orphans and makes it his mission to catch them and have them hauled off to the orphanage. Emily Mortimer plays flower seller Lisette, whom Gustaf pines for, but is afraid to make the first move for fear of rejection and self-consciousness at his crippled leg.There are several bit roles played by some recognizable actors which add to the charm of the movie, but the real appeal of this movie revolves around young Hugo's attempts to get his automaton to work, and how he eventually finds his way 'home'. Along his journey, Hugo discovers the history of cinema, and all the wonders associated with it. The director's love of films shines through in every frame, and the beauty of this film is that it truly dares us to dream and give flight to our imagination!This is a magical film, and a homage to the magic of film-making, that will capture the hearts and minds of viewers, both young and old. The film is rated PG, as there are some intense scenes, though I'd have to say Hugo's father's death is more subtly portrayed here, alluded to by a giant ball of fire. There are some scenes which younger viewers might find scary, such as the scenes of Hugo being chased through the train station by the Station Inspector, etc. but on the whole, the movie is great entertainment for the family.",5,"Surpasses the source work, a feast for the eyes!",1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,3248,"['Having', 'read', 'loved', 'Brian', ""Selznick'sThe"", 'Invention', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'film', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'hands', 'uber', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'not', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'actually', 'loved', 'even', 'more', 'book', 'was', 'whatever', 'had', 'imagined', 'reading', 'book', 'lots', 'graphics', 'btw', 'was', 'brought', 'life', 'only', 'even', 'better', 'husband', 'took', 'almost', 'seven-year-old', 'daughter', 'view', 'was', 'riveted', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'child', 'adult', 'not', 'being', 'captivated', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'truly', 'magical', 'daughter', 'obviously', 'too', 'young', 'get', 'subtler', 'undertones', 'themes', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'visuals', 'follow', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie.The', 'story', 'one', 'one', 'heartstrings', 'imagination', 'Young', 'Hugo', 'Cabret', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'orphan', 'who', 'lost', 'father', 'played', 'Jude', 'Law', 'fire', 'now', 'living', 'wits', 'keeping', 'clocks', 'running', 'large', 'train', 'station', '1930s', 'Paris', 'uncle', 'real', 'timekeeper', 'large', 'portion', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'drunk', 'got', 'Hugo', 'father', 'was', 'clockmaker', 'had', 'been', 'restoring', 'old', 'automaton', 'object', 'fascination', 'father', 'son', 'father', 'death', 'Hugo', 'automaton', 'tries', 'get', 'work', 'using', 'dad', 'notebook', 'guide', 'parts', 'can', 'including', 'store', 'Papa', 'Georges', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'act', 'one', 'day', 'irate', 'anger', 'when', 'notebook.Over', 'period', 'time', 'young', 'Hugo', 'friendship', 'Papa', 'Georges', 'goddaughter', 'orphan', 'Isabelle', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'pair', 'Papa', 'Georges', 'long-buried', 'secrets', 'Hugo', 'peril', 'though', 'station', 'inspector', 'Gustaf', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'tolerance', 'young', 'orphans', 'mission', 'catch', 'have', 'hauled', 'off', 'orphanage', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'flower', 'seller', 'Lisette', 'whom', 'Gustaf', 'pines', 'afraid', 'make', 'first', 'move', 'fear', 'rejection', 'self-consciousness', 'crippled', 'are', 'several', 'bit', 'roles', 'played', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'add', 'charm', 'movie', 'real', 'appeal', 'movie', 'young', 'Hugo', 'attempts', 'get', 'automaton', 'work', 'how', 'eventually', 'way', 'journey', 'Hugo', 'history', 'cinema', 'wonders', 'associated', 'director', 'love', 'films', 'shines', 'frame', 'beauty', 'film', 'truly', 'dream', 'give', 'flight', 'imagination', 'magical', 'film', 'homage', 'magic', 'film-making', 'will', 'capture', 'hearts', 'minds', 'viewers', 'young', 'old', 'film', 'rated', 'PG', 'are', 'intense', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Hugo', 'father', 'death', 'more', 'subtly', 'portrayed', 'here', 'alluded', 'giant', 'ball', 'fire', 'are', 'scenes', 'younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'scary', 'such', 'scenes', 'Hugo', 'being', 'chased', 'train', 'station', 'Station', 'Inspector', 'etc', 'whole', 'movie', 'great', 'entertainment', 'family']",N/A
