492130,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B000005PX6,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","This is a superb adaptation of a wonderful children's novel of the same name by Richard Adams.  As many others have noted, the tone can be a bit grim, and rather than a story about a bunch of cute little bunnies, it's a sometimes frightening tale of escape from a doomed warren, and another escape from a different warren where things are run along the lines of a police state.  The main characters are heroic archetypes, and the story, animation, and voice-acting performances are all first rate.One thing that surprises me somewhat is all the reviewers warning that the story may be a bit too dark for some children.  I have to wonder what sort of childhood these reviewers remember having themselves.  Did most of these reviewers not grow up on some of the fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm and others, where tragic things sometimes happened?  Did they not get exposed to Greek and Norse mythology, with all its grimmer aspects, including death?  I think adults sometimes imagine children to be far more mentally and emotionally fragile than they are.  While it's true that there are things in Watership Down that might be dark and even a bit scary for kids, it's really NOT that bad.  I don't think it harms children for them to learn that bad things happen and the world is not all sunshine and roses; indeed, it may be useful for them to be warned of this.  And I saw this movie at the age of 9 when it came out (and some people I know saw it even younger), and neither I nor anyone else I know who saw it was psychologically damaged by the darker aspects of the film.  Good triumphs in the end.  The dark and threatening things in the film are overcome by the courage, resourcefulness, loyalty, and heroism of the protagonists, and that, I think, is something that's good for kids to see.",5,Great adaptation of a classic children's novel,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,1795,"['superb', 'adaptation', 'wonderful', 'children', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Richard', 'Adams', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'tone', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'grim', 'rather', 'story', 'bunch', 'cute', 'little', 'bunnies', 'sometimes', 'frightening', 'tale', 'escape', 'doomed', 'warren', 'escape', 'different', 'warren', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'run', 'lines', 'police', 'state', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'heroic', 'archetypes', 'story', 'animation', 'voice-acting', 'performances', 'are', 'first', 'rate.One', 'thing', 'somewhat', 'reviewers', 'warning', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'children', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'sort', 'childhood', 'reviewers', 'remember', 'having', 'Did', 'most', 'reviewers', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'others', 'where', 'tragic', 'things', 'sometimes', 'happened', 'Did', 'not', 'get', 'exposed', 'Greek', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'grimmer', 'aspects', 'including', 'death', 'think', 'adults', 'sometimes', 'imagine', 'children', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'are', 'true', 'are', 'things', 'Watership', 'Down', 'might', 'be', 'dark', 'even', 'bit', 'scary', 'kids', 'really', 'NOT', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'children', 'learn', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'world', 'not', 'sunshine', 'roses', 'indeed', 'may', 'be', 'useful', 'be', 'warned', 'saw', 'movie', 'age', '9', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'people', 'know', 'saw', 'even', 'younger', 'anyone', 'else', 'know', 'who', 'saw', 'was', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'darker', 'aspects', 'film', 'Good', 'triumphs', 'end', 'dark', 'threatening', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'overcome', 'courage', 'resourcefulness', 'loyalty', 'heroism', 'protagonists', 'think', 'something', 'good', 'kids', 'see']",N/A

492134,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000005PX6,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[15, 15]","Richard Adams' classic on a band of rabbits leaving their secure warren after a prophecy of doom foretold by one of their number was quite a task to bring to the screen.  After Fiver sees a vision of their warren in danger and tells everyone to flee, his older brother Hazel and (in the movie version).  But I saw the movie on TV and read the book so many times and enjoyed it everytime.The rabbits encounter many perils away from the warren, and the scene in the woods in the dark is a perfect example of the perils they face.  They may be escaping to hopes of a better place, but they have to be on their guard, where their ears perk at any sound.A big crisis occurs later on and they enlist the aid of Kehaar, a wounded but wacky seagull (&quot;I come from the peeg vater&quot;) they nurse back to health, to help them make their new society a more solid founding.  That leads them to Efrafa, a militaristic warren under the ferocious claws of the gigantic General Woundwort.  He is drawn pretty scary and the little tykes might find him a wee bit frightening.Some of the rabbits have distinct personalities.  There's Hazel the strategist and nominal leader of the group, Fiver the visionary, Bigwig, a tough rabbit and fighter who's their muscle, Pipkin, the small and chubby fearful one, Dandelion the storyteller (who unfortunately doesn't get a chance to tell a story here), Blackberry the clever one, whose ideas save them more than once, and Silver, who's a larger rabbit whose presence seems to give them security.  One character that was never in the book is Violet, a doe, who unfortunately meets a tragic end, and her death has great consequences later on.It's virtually impossible to replicate Richard Adams' masterpiece on an animated level, but producer Martin Rosen and his team try.  The rabbit societies and their different outlook is made apparent.  There's the authoritarianism of the wanderer's home, the deceiving, untraditional Cowslip's warren, and the cruel militaristic totalitarianism of General Woundwort's warren, Efrafa.  Hazel's group is more democratic and the best way to live, as is the vision Fiver has of where they should be:  &quot;A high lonely place with dry soil where we can see and hear all around, and men hardly ever come.&quot;The animation is splendid, the rabbits made believable, such as the heroes.  The types of eyes play a difference here.  The heroes eyes seem normal, while the narrow eyes of Cowslip's rabbits give them a sense that they're a bit weird, and the dark circles around those in Woundwort's sociey give the officers a cruel look, and the others an oppressed look.A more lyrical set of sequences is given when we get an insight into how Fiver gets his visions.  But the image where a warren is destroyed by men is pretty disturbing.  From the latter, this movie is not for the younger kids, as there are some frightening and violent scenes.  Maybe junior high onward.And some of the Lapine language terms are used here without explanation, so I'll include them here:flayrah - very good food, e.g. the carrots at Cowslip's warrenHlessi - a solitary rabbit not part of a warrenHraka- rabbit word for excrement, also used as a swear wordhrududu- a motor vehicleinle - death.  Frith and inle is kind of like &quot;Oh my god.&quot; in rabbit languageLendri- a badgerOwsla- the officer class in a warren, in charge of defense and security.-rah - a suffix meaning prince or a token of respect. e.g. Hazel-rahsilflay - feeding timeTharn - going tharn means rabbits are going stupefied from fearThe voice actors do well in bringing personalities into the rabbits, especially John Hurt (Hazel), Richard &quot;Good Neighbours&quot; Briers (Fiver), Roy Kinnear (Pipkin), Michael Gruber-Fox (Bigwig), and Harry Andrews (Woundwort), but it's Zero Mostel's over-the-top Yiddish schitck as Kehaar that surpasses them all.Rabbits.  Prolific, hunted by humans, an invasive species, to use the ecological term, but they are animals.  The glory and triumph of the rabbit can be summed up in Frith's (the sun and God to the rabbits) message to El-ahrairah, the prince of rabbits:  &quot;All the world will be your enemy, prince witha  thousand enemies, and when they catch you they will kill you.  But first they must catch you, digger, runner, prince with the swift warning.

The intro almost had me turning the thing off--happily the animation improved once the ""legend"" was all through.  My problems with this film--it barely skims the surface of the depth of story found in the book.  We never see how Hazel and Bigwig at the start are at odds re. who should be chief rabbit.  We spend perhaps what seems, oh, the span of one morning in the warren of bones and snares--in the book the rabbits stayed there for many days at least.  We don't have Strawberry (I believe that was his name) from that same warren follow after our heros depart (after Bigwig escapes the snare), to join them.  We don't see that Clover and others of the hutch rabbits do manage to escape and join Hazel's group.  We never see the little mouse Hazel befriends--one of my favorite scenes in the book, or how that leads up to Hazel's idea to befriend other animals living on the hill--and the eventually befriending of the seagull.  We never see how long Bigwig stayed at Gen. Woundwart's (sp?) warren, how difficult it was for him to get to the point he could organize an escape.  We never see the doe who hurt her back jumping into the boat, die, and worst of all and in my opinion the other never sees were forgiveable, but not this--we never see how Hazel escapes the cat, we never see him go for the car ride that takes him back to the warren.  The other thing we never see that I would have liked to see--after Woundwart's (sp?) death we never see the joining of the two warrens--Hazel's vision, and how that comes true.So no I do not recommend this film.

Just reading the reviews brought back images from my  theater viewing 20 years ago.To reiterate what others have said, this  is not a film for small children; my two little ones will have to wait  several more years.  Death and killing are topics that are usually avoided  in animated movies, but life and death are part of the adult-oriented  subject matter in this engaging film.  The animation may be somewhat dated,  but the themes of this wonderful story (the longing for freedom and a  better life) are as relevant today as ever.  Hopefully this movie will make  its way to DVD soon.",5,"The cold, cruel world through the eyes of rabbits",940550400,"10 22, 1999",1999,977,"['reading', 'previous', 'reviews', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'almost', 'were', 'written', 'people', 'age', 'group', 'was', '10', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'where', 'sit', 'typing', 'can', 'see', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'bookshelf', 'convinced', 'mother', 'buy', 'shortly', 'seeing', 'film', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'made', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Just', 'reading', 'reviews', 'brought', 'back', 'images', 'theater', 'viewing', '20', 'years', 'ago.To', 'reiterate', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'not', 'film', 'small', 'children', 'two', 'little', 'ones', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'several', 'more', 'years', 'Death', 'killing', 'are', 'topics', 'are', 'usually', 'avoided', 'animated', 'movies', 'life', 'death', 'are', 'part', 'adult-oriented', 'subject', 'matter', 'engaging', 'film', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'themes', 'wonderful', 'story', 'longing', 'freedom', 'better', 'life', 'are', 'relevant', 'today', 'ever', 'Hopefully', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'way', 'DVD', 'soon']",N/A

It is absolutely NOT for kids. It is violent and gory, and it has a deep complex storyline and lots of talking.The movie starts off with a strange animated sequence explaining to us that the world and it's animals were created by a god called Frith. The animals lived happily, but soon the rabbits began to multiply, and Frith warned the Prince of rabbits named El-ahrairah to find ways to control his people, otherwise he will. When El-ahrairah makes an egotistical comment, Frith is angered and wants to get the better with him. He blesses each animal, making them all different. Then he creates the fox, dog, cat, hawk, and weasel, and many of the rabbits get eaten by them. Frith then blesses El-ahrairah's tail, which turns him into a swift rabbit with big feet. He then tells the Prince ''all the world will be your enemy, Prince with a thousand enemies. And whenever they catch you, they will kill you, but first they must catch you''.The scene then cuts to a beautiful and unique animation style which goes on for the rest of the film. We are introduced to rabbits named Hazel and Fiver. Fiver acts rather strange, and while they are eating, Fiver has a scary vision of the field covered in blood. When he snaps out of it, he feels that there is evil all around them, and he tells Hazel they must leave the warren immediately. They have to leave because there will be tractors that will ruin the field and kill the rabbits. We are then introduced to Bigwig, who directs them to the Chief rabbit, but the Chief doesn't feel that they should leave during mating season.Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and several other rabbits decide to secretly leave anyway. Throughout the film, the rabbits try to find the perfect place to settle, but they meet many dangers along the way.I really like this movie. I find the story is really interesting and the main characters are all unique and likable. This is a really good film, but it isn't for everyone. Some scenes are truly horrifying for an animated film. There is also a gory fight scene near the end.

492149,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000005PX6,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","Both me and my then 9 years old daughter we LOVED this 1978 British animated film, which can be watched with interest not only by children by also by adults. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Adapted from a children book (which I didn't read), this film begins in a comfortable rabbit warren somewhere in English countryside. In this story rabbits live in very well organized societies, with always a Warren Chief at the top of the hierarchy and a standing army/police force, called Owsla, to preserve peace and chase away intruders.One of the rabbits in this particular warren, a certain Fiver, is a seer - and he just had a terrifying vision which makes him urge the Warren Chief to abandon their homeplace and look for a new one. But as he is a kind of a runt-of-the-litter the chief refuses his advice - very bluntly. However Fiver's big brother Hazel, a very noble character, believes him immediately and so do some of their friends and relatives: Blackberry, Pipkin, Dandelion, Silver, Violet (the only girl) and last but not least a particularly huge and fierce rabbit warrior named Bigwig. Together they abandon their warren and go in exile, searching for a new home. And then the film really begins...This is an exceptionally good film, slightly similar in tone and at the same extraordinary level as the &#34;Secret of NIMH&#34; - although here the drawing style is different and frankly, for my personal taste, BETTER than in this great American classic. It is also suprisingly serious for a kids movie, with elements of rabbit warfare and religion included. Younger children will probably not understand it at all.PARENTAL WARNING: there is at least one scene which is absolutely NIGHTMARISH (it actually made me shudder - and I haven't been a child for a long time now) and also please be warned that some characters die a rather ugly and violent death in this film - and I am not talking here about bad guys... For all those reasons I would really NOT let children younger than 7 watch it...21 years later, in 1999, there were also 39 episodes TV series made based on the same story, but it was more kids friendly, with only the last episodes becoming darker and more serious. I watched only a couple of episodes, but my daughter, who went through almost oll of them, definitely preferred the original film.That being said, I found this film EXCELLENT. Actually, you don't really need to watch it with children - adults, especially those who are into fantasy and SF (like me) can find this film a very, very interesting and very pleasant thing to see. I certainly did.

492150,AXAT12OVCGZL2,B000005PX6,Mario Rodgers,"[13, 15]","A few days ago, I finally managed to watch the popular anime title Grave of the Fireflies. While I considered it to be a good animated movie, I was  disappointed by the apparent lack of true drama. With Watership Down,  however, we get something powerful. While I don't consider mindless  violence to be drama, here the violence actually works because it  represents the hardships these rabbits have to endure. Everybody acts  realistically, and everybody makes the experience enjoyable, especially the  haunting Fiver. And with this movie, you can't actually say the animation  is bad because the surrealistic quality makes the movie that much more  haunting. It just wouldn't be the same if the movie didn't have the  bleeding fields or Captain Holly's nightmare or the sad but powerful  &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; sequence. While uninitiated adults won't want to  see an animated movie, and this is certainly not a movie for kids, those  that have seen this movie have seen something, in my opinion, epic and  powerful and genuinely sad.

That the bad guys always miss and the good guys always win?  That just 'aint true, I'm afraid!I have to agree with the reviewers who say it's gory in places, but I think parents should show it, and stop if their children find it upsetting, rather than just not show it at all. The first viewing of this film is an occasion (and should be made an occasion!). I assure you your kids will remember it... and they'll also remember that they watched it with you.I saw the film myself at the cinema when I was nine one afternoon with my father and some likable crazy guy who'd brought along a toy rabbit called ""Tannoy"" which had ""saved his life"" he told me (long story!). I was 9, and had waited years to see it... The film was delayed for a long time due to difficulties behind the scenes, but when it was finally released it was hailed as ""the longest animated feature ever made"", and over 9 months after release was still playing at our local cinemas... beat THAT Disney! :-)""Watership Down"" is a story of escape from oppression, tyranny and deception, to a freedom won by conflict with those who would take it away by any means necessary, and a leader who earns his place rather than it being given without being deserved.The films opens with swaying grass at the top of Watership Down, and at the cinema this scene looked so real, that for a moment I thought it was a real film of grass being blown around!

He often said &quot;Watership Down&quot; blossomed from the many bedtime stories he told his children.  Regardless,  it is a brilliant introduction for young readers to some of the unpleasent  (as well as pleasent) realities of life.  The book is sensational in how it  establishes an entirely believable world as would be seen and lived by wild  rabbits (albeit rabbits with some very human traits, like intelligence, but  let's not be picky).  This fantasy world is complete with societies based  on organizational structure, discipline, and even religion (there's even a  leporidaen version of Noah's Ark...a real treat!)Sadly, it is impossible  to make an animated adapation of the novel without losing so many of the  wonderfully unique aspects of the book.  Yet, Martin Rosen does a faithful  job in reconstructing the basic story line so that fans are not likely to  be disappointed.  Children ages 6 and up should be able to watch and enjoy  the film (I first watched it when I was five).  However, I would urge  parents to be present with their youngest to help them understand some of  Watership Down's harsher elements.The movie's strongest attributes are  its beautiful music (scored by Angela Morley), fine character development,  and the unique animation style of the short story that opens the film.

I guess this is one of those movies that if you enjoy it you really enjoy it. Personally, I feel everyone should give it at least one look. They don't make movies anymore that can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike. It does have violence but not as gory as todays movies.

The quality of animation was really not the issue, as I didn't have a high expectation anyway and it was adequate, but the sound transfer was awful and was practically made the whole thing unwatchable.  The pitch and tones went from so quiet you couldn't hear, to blaringly loud (like an unwelcomed loud commercial).  I kept having to adjust the volume...and I was in a quiet room.  If you've heard the old saying that you shouldn't really be ""aware"" of the music, this one failed miserably at that.  The music so distracted and blared out so loud as to distract from anything going on and sometimes made it hard to hear the dialogue.Not to say all Brits are stuffy, but most of the script/screenplay was read in the stereotypical British aristocratic style---stodgy, stuffy, and boring, somewhat like a barrister would have read it.  Some of the parts seemed more like they were reading a dictionary, , instruction manual, or legal document or like they were narrating a documentary than a dramatic story. The voices just never quite felt right and lacked any serious dedication to empathy, feeling or excitement.  They added nothing to the story.Also, the cutting out of a great many sub-plots and societal points (as pointed out by a number of reviewers) really took away from the meaning of the book and thorough story-telling of the original novel.  Pretty much, it was watered down into an animated story about bunnies escaping a farmer to get to a safe place. That's it. The original story carries valuable social dialogue and stories, whereas there's nothing of value here if you're over about 3 years old...really.I would hope that someone someday does a revisit to this story and gets it right. This adaptation is simply terrible...and thus I revised my rating from 2 to 1 star.As for me, I got this at the library free and am very glad I didn't have to pay for this.  I would have felt a bit ripped off.  This one is strictly for the little kiddies, as all adult content has pretty well been water-shipped down.  *Since this review has been up, so many people say it isn't helpful.  I suggest you go and really take a good look at this film and make some comparisons to the book.

492167,A2BMDY4WJIDGG7,B000005PX6,S Tuffnell,"[2, 3]","Watership Down is an unsettling exercise in glorifying death and violence disguised as a kids film. It is very disturbing thanks to some surreal imagery that is mindbending and chilling. It is hard to forget the overall disturbing atmosphere, that is bleak, morbid and dark throughout. The story revolves around bunny Fiver who sees visions of a black rabbit, death personified, and believes they must leave their warren before they are destroyed. He manages to convince a few and they escape. The rest of the warren are destroyed by man, the real enemy of the film, who digs up the warrens with excavators, made to look like carnivorous monsters. There are surreal scenes of bunnies trying to escape their holes but they are blocked by dead bunnies in the entrance, blue and red eyed, a most unsettling sequence.Fiver leads the intrepid bunnies to the big big water where they meet an obnoxious seagull who swears and makes a lot of loud noise. They travel to a warren where there are a lot of other bunnies that seem strangely brainwashed, almost like a cult. They are being fed enormous amounts of food but Fiver senses they are going to be killed and are being fattened up like trapped lambs led to the slaughter. He is right, and the rabbits escape but there is a nasty encounter with a trap that causes blood and foam to drool down the mouth of the victim. They encounter one death struggle after another and everytime Fiver sees the black rabbit he knows one of them will be killed. We see bunny after bunny slaughtered, by car, by hawk, and by ravenous dogs.""There's a dog in the woods"" says Fiver ominously and a massive black dog mutilates one rabbit after another. It revels in the kill and has no mercy. It is the only animal that doesn't talk giving it a more sinister appeal. A cat catches one bunny and says sardonically ""Can you move, I think not, I think not."" The unremorseless slaughter of the innocent is horrifying but the theme of the film is that the bunnies will have many enemies as Frith (rabbit god) intended, as a form of punishment. But the rabbits are given gifts of enormous speed and agility so that it can survive ""digger, runner, swift of foot, prince of a thousand enemies"". And the narration makes it perfectly obvious this will be leak in the first scene, ""when they catch you they will kill you.""The film is blessed with an amazing song ""Bright Eyes"" by Paul Simon that is haunting and beautiful. The film clip that went with this featured many of Fiver's visions and it all made sense at the time. I saw this movie at the cinema and it certainly had an impact on my teenage mind. I thought about it often and my sister became obsessed with it, reading the novel, drawing the rabbits and buying a very lavishly illustrated book of the film.Overall, this is an enjoyable film made back before political correctness and severe censorship. Along with `Felidae' and `Plague Dogs' it is hailed as one of the more disturbing animated `kids' films. As such it is a real oddity that will entertain, but it is not really for kids. They can watch with parents of course but the nightmarish scenes may have a negative long lasting effect.",4,Not for kids but great dark saga on death.,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,3165,"['Watership', 'Down', 'unsettling', 'exercise', 'glorifying', 'death', 'violence', 'disguised', 'kids', 'film', 'very', 'disturbing', 'thanks', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'mindbending', 'chilling', 'hard', 'forget', 'overall', 'disturbing', 'atmosphere', 'bleak', 'morbid', 'dark', 'story', 'around', 'bunny', 'Fiver', 'who', 'visions', 'black', 'rabbit', 'death', 'personified', 'must', 'leave', 'warren', 'are', 'destroyed', 'convince', 'few', 'escape', 'rest', 'warren', 'are', 'destroyed', 'man', 'real', 'enemy', 'film', 'who', 'up', 'warrens', 'excavators', 'made', 'look', 'carnivorous', 'monsters', 'are', 'surreal', 'scenes', 'bunnies', 'trying', 'escape', 'holes', 'are', 'blocked', 'dead', 'bunnies', 'entrance', 'blue', 'red', 'eyed', 'most', 'unsettling', 'sequence.Fiver', 'intrepid', 'bunnies', 'big', 'big', 'water', 'where', 'meet', 'obnoxious', 'seagull', 'who', 'lot', 'loud', 'noise', 'travel', 'warren', 'where', 'are', 'lot', 'other', 'bunnies', 'seem', 'strangely', 'brainwashed', 'almost', 'cult', 'are', 'being', 'fed', 'enormous', 'amounts', 'food', 'Fiver', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'are', 'being', 'fattened', 'up', 'trapped', 'lambs', 'led', 'slaughter', 'right', 'rabbits', 'escape', 'nasty', 'encounter', 'trap', 'blood', 'foam', 'drool', 'down', 'mouth', 'victim', 'encounter', 'one', 'death', 'struggle', 'everytime', 'Fiver', 'black', 'rabbit', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'see', 'bunny', 'bunny', 'slaughtered', 'car', 'hawk', 'ravenous', 'dogs', 'dog', 'woods', 'Fiver', 'ominously', 'massive', 'black', 'dog', 'one', 'rabbit', 'kill', 'mercy', 'only', 'animal', ""n't"", 'talk', 'giving', 'more', 'sinister', 'appeal', 'cat', 'one', 'bunny', 'sardonically', 'Can', 'move', 'think', 'not', 'think', 'not', 'unremorseless', 'slaughter', 'innocent', 'horrifying', 'theme', 'film', 'bunnies', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'enemies', 'Frith', 'rabbit', 'god', 'intended', 'form', 'punishment', 'rabbits', 'are', 'given', 'gifts', 'enormous', 'speed', 'agility', 'so', 'can', 'survive', 'digger', 'runner', 'swift', 'foot', 'prince', 'thousand', 'enemies', 'narration', 'perfectly', 'obvious', 'will', 'be', 'leak', 'first', 'scene', 'when', 'catch', 'will', 'kill', 'film', 'blessed', 'amazing', 'song', 'Bright', 'Eyes', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'film', 'clip', 'went', 'featured', 'many', 'Fiver', 'visions', 'made', 'sense', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'cinema', 'certainly', 'had', 'impact', 'teenage', 'mind', 'thought', 'often', 'sister', 'became', 'obsessed', 'reading', 'novel', 'drawing', 'rabbits', 'buying', 'very', 'lavishly', 'illustrated', 'book', 'film.Overall', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'made', 'back', 'political', 'correctness', 'severe', 'censorship', 'Felidae', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'hailed', 'one', 'more', 'disturbing', 'animated', 'kids', 'films', 'such', 'real', 'oddity', 'will', 'entertain', 'not', 'really', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'parents', 'course', 'nightmarish', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'negative', 'long', 'lasting', 'effect']",N/A
