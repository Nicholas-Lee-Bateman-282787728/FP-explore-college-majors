It's more of a mild family movie (unlike Back To School which is geared more to the adult viewer), but Ladybugs will serve well to generate some good laughs.

Since it was 1am, I don't think many people were watching the movie, but I was rolling in the isle laughing with tears. Of course, the highlight of any Rodney movie are his one-line jokes. For example: He was involved in a heated exchange of words with a battle-axe-of-a-woman who was the coach of an opposing soccer team. They were throwing verbal jabs at eachother.

I watched it so many times I could recite whole chunks of dialog. (Yes I am a dork) I'm trying to figure out what I loved about it. It really has a rather grotesque plot, but being ten a lot of the jokes went over my head. Also, the plot is incredibly absurd.The movie is about a man named Chester Field (I think) who is always sucking up to his boss. He is desperate for a promotion so that he can marry his fiance Bess, and live happily ever after. One day, in his bosses office, trying to summon up the courage to request a promotion, his boss happens mention how much he likes soccer. Chester ends up lying about coaching a soccer team and is giving the position of coaching the team that his daughter plays on. Did I mention that Chester really likes to suck up?....Chester has a couple of problems with this, mainly his problem is that the soccer team is terrible and he doesn't know how to coach. Also, his boss is all about winning at everything. And so, Chester dresses up his fiance's son, who is talented at soccer as a girl to help the soccer team win. (Jonathan Brandis makes a very pretty girl, by the way). This has many disastrous and vaguely hilarious results.This movie is fun, and light and the plot is absurd and stupid enough to keep you watching. Unless you are ten.

But before he knows it, in his quest for a promotion, his boss Dave Mullen (Tom Parks) has made him coach for the company girl's soccer team, the Ladybugs! And since Chester doesn't know the first thing about soccer, he gets the help of his assistant, Julie Benson (Jackee Harry). But Chester needs someone else if they're going to win the championship, so what does he do? He gets his fiance's teenage son, Matthew (Jonathan Brandis) to dress up as a girl to join the Ladybugs! Matthew agrees only because he loves soccer and has a bad crush on player Kimberly Mullen (Vinessa Shaw). Of course nothing goes as smoothly as anybody would hope as Chester and Matthew scramble around to help the team, Chester's boss, and Matthew's mom.""Ladybugs"" is a very mediocre film with a pretty cheesy plot and some humor that you just can't seem to whole heartedly laugh at or even with. It does have its charming moments, like Matthew's sweet crush on Kimberly. The acting is pretty well done, mostly Rodney Dangerfield and Jonathan Brandis. But I must say my favorite character was Jackee Harry who was probably the most hilarious and funny character. The plot is nothing at all in a way spectacular, the usual feel good ending with everything working out better for everyone.The movie isn't really worth buying that much so I recommend that if you really wan to see it, rent it first.

He's in top form in this one as an engaged working class guy who agrees to coach the ""Ladybugs"" girls soccer team to finagle a promotion from his boss & better support his future wife (Ilene Graff). Soon, he discovers how deep over his head he's in---the team is a disaster. That is, until he convinces his teenage future son--who has natural skill as a player--to don drag as new member ""Martha"" & whip the team into shape. So it sort of functions as a ""Tootsie"" on a soccer field as both must keep up the charade in order to have a winning season & impress the boss with his coaching.Jackee Harry gives fine comic support as Rodney's sassy assistant, and even the late child actor Jonathan Brandis has some very good moments. Highlights: A scandalously hilarious bit in a girl's dressing room; Brandis frantically switching from boy clothes to drag (several times) when both his Mom and the girl on the team he likes are under the same roof; Rodney donning drag himself to rescue Brandis from a potentially disasterous ""skinny dipping"" session with the girls; Rodney rattling off some of his one-liners in traditional fashion; the soccer action sequences; Rodney finally standing up to his boss with the great line, ""What good is it to be the best when it brings out the worst in you?""; and Rodney's unforgettable closing gag (I won't spoil it for you!).A fun & breezy comedy, ""Ladybugs"" definitely scores!",5,Rodney finally gets respect...on the soccer field!,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,1489,"['early', '90', 'effort', 'arguably', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'last', 'truly', 'great', 'comedy', 'top', 'form', 'one', 'engaged', 'working', 'class', 'guy', 'who', 'coach', 'Ladybugs', 'girls', 'soccer', 'team', 'finagle', 'promotion', 'boss', 'better', 'support', 'future', 'wife', 'Ilene', 'Graff', 'Soon', 'how', 'deep', 'head', '-the', 'team', 'disaster', 'teenage', 'future', 'son', 'who', 'natural', 'skill', 'player', 'don', 'drag', 'new', 'member', 'Martha', 'whip', 'team', 'shape', 'sort', 'functions', 'Tootsie', 'soccer', 'field', 'must', 'keep', 'up', 'charade', 'order', 'have', 'winning', 'season', 'impress', 'boss', 'coaching.Jackee', 'Harry', 'fine', 'comic', 'support', 'Rodney', 'sassy', 'assistant', 'even', 'late', 'child', 'actor', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'Highlights', 'scandalously', 'hilarious', 'bit', 'girl', 'dressing', 'room', 'Brandis', 'frantically', 'switching', 'boy', 'clothes', 'drag', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'Mom', 'girl', 'team', 'are', 'same', 'roof', 'Rodney', 'donning', 'drag', 'rescue', 'Brandis', 'potentially', 'disasterous', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'session', 'girls', 'Rodney', 'rattling', 'off', 'one-liners', 'traditional', 'fashion', 'soccer', 'action', 'sequences', 'Rodney', 'finally', 'standing', 'up', 'boss', 'great', 'line', 'What', 'good', 'be', 'best', 'when', 'out', 'worst', 'Rodney', 'unforgettable', 'closing', 'gag', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', '.A', 'fun', 'breezy', 'comedy', 'Ladybugs', 'definitely']",N/A

I've been hoping and praying they would release it on DVD, especially since Rodney Dangerfield passed away. I will soon be ordering this. If you loved Dangerfield, you'll love him here. This movie is just plain fun. Dangerfield and his girlfriend's son Matthew (played by the late Jonathan Brandis) work together to achieve their goals. Dangerfield gets stuck coaching a girls' soccer team to get in good with his boss and Brandis just wants to play soccer. That's when Dangerfield hatches a plan to dress Matthew up as a girl to play on the soccer team and make the team better. Known as Martha to the girls, the web starts getting tangled here as Matthew/Martha and Dangerfield try to hide this from everyone else.I remember taking my cousin to see this in the movie theater when we were younger.

316104,ABLBRUT8DALNN,6302492009,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","We all have our own guilty pleasure, most of them we never admit to, however I will admit one now. I have loved this movie ever since I was a kid. Now that I've watched it as an adult, I can admit that it is one terrible movie, but it still had me laughing as hard as I did when I was 10 years old. In Ladybugs, Rodney Dangerfield plays a salesman who is asked to coach his company sponsored, girls soccer team, but he had no idea what he was in for. The other coaches are ruthless, the parents are insane, and worst of all his team is terrible, so what is a comedian to do? He gets his girlfriends, athletic, 14 year old son to dress up as a girl and join the team. The son is played by teen heartthrob Jonathan Brandis, who I became a huge fan of during the show Seaquest DSV. Brandis was absolutely hysterical as the teenage son, playing a teenage daughter. Some of his lines, along with his interactions with Dangerfield are pure comic genius. As for Dangerfield, while he was a legendary stand-up comedian, he was a terrible actor. The next logical step for a great stand-up comic is acting, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and while Dangerfield has some pretty funny lines, he is one of the worst acting comedians I have ever seen. The story here is a unique and interesting one, in a context that is most definitely not meant for younger kids. There are some funny lines and more laughs to be had at the ridiculousness of the situation, but besides that, this is not a great movie. I gave it an even rating, but when it comes to this film, I am biased by my admiration for the late Jonathan Brandis and my fondness for this film I have loved, since my childhood.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,1679,"['have', 'own', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'most', 'never', 'admit', 'however', 'will', 'admit', 'one', 'now', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'kid', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'adult', 'can', 'admit', 'one', 'terrible', 'movie', 'still', 'had', 'laughing', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'when', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'Ladybugs', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'salesman', 'who', 'asked', 'coach', 'company', 'sponsored', 'girls', 'soccer', 'team', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'other', 'coaches', 'are', 'ruthless', 'parents', 'are', 'insane', 'worst', 'team', 'terrible', 'what', 'comedian', 'do', 'girlfriends', 'athletic', '14', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'dress', 'up', 'girl', 'join', 'team', 'son', 'played', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'who', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'Seaquest', 'DSV', 'Brandis', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'teenage', 'son', 'playing', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'lines', 'interactions', 'Dangerfield', 'are', 'pure', 'comic', 'genius', 'Dangerfield', 'was', 'legendary', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'was', 'terrible', 'actor', 'next', 'logical', 'step', 'great', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'acting', ""n't"", 'Dangerfield', 'pretty', 'funny', 'lines', 'one', 'worst', 'acting', 'comedians', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'story', 'here', 'unique', 'interesting', 'one', 'context', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'meant', 'younger', 'kids', 'are', 'funny', 'lines', 'more', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'ridiculousness', 'situation', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'gave', 'even', 'rating', 'when', 'film', 'am', 'biased', 'admiration', 'late', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'fondness', 'film', 'have', 'loved', 'childhood']",N/A
