They're thoroughly entertaining, with just enough humor to keep you from taking it too seriously. One cares about the Creeper's victims and is interested in what they have to say. The Creeper, for all his demented temperaments, also has a sense of humor and, apparently, the ability to keep a truck running and to put the appropriate bumper sticker on it. There's also careful character development in it, and one learns to like the kids in both movies (which is fortunate, because you, the viewer, has to spend so much time with them). These are movies that you'll enjoy more with each telling, and even the commentaries are great and worth listening to.I consider a movie worthwhile if it'll keep my interest, and both movies excel in this. If I'm flipping through the movie channels and come across either, I'll tend to watch it even though I've seen both countless times. The acting is decent, storylines fully developed and dialog witty and racing.It's the kind of movies I wish I could see fresh again, because their types just don't come along very often. It's not for young children, but it's not the Jason Goes To Summer Camp-type movie full of guts and gore. If you haven't seen them, buy them. Chances are, you'll be watching them more often than you think.

I don't mean creepy in a good horror movie way, I mean creepy like odd and disconcerting.  First of all, ""Jeepers Creepers"" in an ""okay"" horror film I guess, nothing original.  But the thing that bothered me when I first saw these two movies is that there is a weird running theme that goes against normal movie convention.  In Part 1, Justin Long plays the male protagonist but assumes the role of the ""female victim"".  For some reason the creature becomes obsessed with him, starts stalking him and steals and sniffs his laundry.  Isn't this what normally  happens to the female protagonist in horror films?  Unless of course the creature is gay.  In Part 2, a bunch of high school football players and cheerleaders get stranded while traveling in a school bus.  For some reason, the football players use this opportunity to take off their clothes and sun bathe on top of the bus.  Huh??  How many men would do this?  Isn't this what female characters normally do in horror films to achieve the obligatory T&A shots?  Why aren't the slutty cheerleaders taking their clothes off?  It gives a strange, uncomfortable quality to both movies.  Later I found out the director was a convicted child molester who molested boys.  NOW IT ALL MADE SENSE!!

The slasher/stalker/monster/mutilator is well conceived with a good back story and excellently executed (as are the prerequisite youthful bodies piling up along the roadside).  The first one has Gina Phillips and Justin Long as brother and sister who first encounter our SSMM and have to deal with the outcome.  Their banter makes what could be a tedious pedestrian exercise in horror come alive and the ""Guy"" who trips their nightmares is scary enough to make Charlie Brown stay out of the Pumpkin Patch, believe me.  Look for the late great Eileen Brennan in one of her last roles making a nifty cameo-esque appearance in the first one.The second one ups the youthful bodies quotient by making the object of our ""Guy"" a school bus full of high school kids and stands out as a sequel by being less of a sequel and more of a stand alone. Jonathan Breck returns (I should have mentioned him for the first one because he does a 'bang up' job playing the SSMM)and wreaks more mayhem upon our hapless teens.

1064941,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000OPOARK,Robert Badgley,"[3, 4]","The Jeepers Creepers ""franchise"" of just two films so far produced,offer up a tantalizing and unique twist to the horror genre.At its' creepy core is a demon creature that seeks out and dines on human flesh for 23 days every 23 years.It is humanoid in appearance and wears a neck to foot black jacket with a wide brimmed black hat.It has highly developed olfactory senses which helps it to sniff out its' prey with precision.And oh yes,it flies and can snatch its' victims with unerring accuracy.The first movie involves a sister and brother(Gina Phillips and Justin Long) on their way home when they literally get run off the road by a fast moving truck.Farther along off road they spy said truck with its' driver throwing bodies down a large drainage pipe.After the truck driver/creature departs the scene they decide to investigate.The brother ends up at the bottom of the pipe which is directly below an old abandoned church.What he finds are hundreds of bodies stitched together which cover the walls and ceiling;a kind of a surreal tapestry.They go for help and are followed by the creature who dispatches the police who accompany them back.A local psychic tries to warn them about the danger they are in and all parties eventually end up at the local police station.A battle for their lives ensue but in the end the creature gets its' main target;the brother.The second movie is set just about four days after the first one and it is day 22 of the creatures eating spree;just one left.The movie starts out with a farmer who gets his small son abducted by the creature,who then sets on a quest to find and kill it.The scene switches to a school bus aboard which is a high school sports team,who become the demons' menu du jour.The coach,school bus driver and assistant coach all get taken,in that order.Then it's the students turns,who get terrorized for most of the film in the bus and in some most spectacularly scary ways(be ready to jump!).Eventually the teens make make a run for it and scatter throughout the local country side but some don't make it.The farmer shows up with a homemade harpoon he has fashioned on the back of his pick up and spears the creature more than once.It is finally brought down and ""killed"".It is more accurate to say the creatures' time has run out and it goes into a state of hibernation for 23 more years.The end of the film fast forwards 23 years minus a day and the farmer has the creature on display in his barn.He sits with gun in hand,beside his harpoon machine,ready for the creature's re-awakening which is now imminent.Screen to black.Jeepers Creepers(2001)is the lesser of the two films.While a great concept it is just too uneven a film to hold the tension steadily throughout and its' padding becomes evident after a time-on other words it tries to tell too much.The writers even try to use the old device of getting the audience in on the joke,where the brother and sister investigate the pipe.The sister says that this is the point in every scary movie where the people know they shouldn't be doing what they're doing,but do it anyways.It doesn't come off nor ring true.Jeepers Creepers 2(2003)is a step up and the better of two movies.The writers keep the details down to a minimum and the story flows much better.The majority of it revolves around the school bus with little extraneous activity intruding.The demon picks off its' victims in high scary fashion(which builds and keeps the tension running well),with the parallel story of the farmer and his ""quest"" only coming in when necessary.Technically speaking Creepers One includes both wide screen and full screen versions while Creepers Two is just wide screen.Both the films have been transferred very well and are generally crisp and clean throughout.In conclusion,I do recommend both of these films,with Creepers Two over One by a star, but you should really view both to get the full effect.The creature/demon in question is really something to behold and I guarantee,between the two movies,there are enough goosebumps and scary moments to have you either looking away or jumping out of your seats;more than a few times.",3,3 1/2 stars for a unique twist and journey into the horror genre!,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,4137,"['Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'franchise', 'just',
