856680,A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B00062IDZQ,Geminigirl,"[0, 0]","This was the first MTV reality series that I watched and I'd forgotten what a cute couple they were.  Hindsight being 20/20 vision, the idea was a good way to reintroduce the couple to the public and remind viewers that both were pretty good pop singers who were still struggling to reestablish themselves in the music world but the added scrutiny by basically the world that they allowed into their private lives served to destroy their marriage.  So I wonder if they'd agree to do this again knowing what they know now.It's such a shame that the marriage didn't last but these 10 episodes are as entertaining to watch now as they were just a few short years ago.  I loved how down to earth Nick was - hanging out with his brother, stubbornly moving his furniture into the house, fighting the bees and fretting about his music video and solo album.  Jessica seemed sweet & her hilarious observations were the perfect foil to Nick's ""straight man"" reactions.I remember that as the seasons went on they weren't as charming as this one because the tension between Nick & the entire Simpson family was so obvious that it became painful to watch.  My only complaint is in the editing of the discs it's odd that neither Nick or Jessica's actual songs were used during the episodes about the filming of their videos but overall I enjoyed reliving this first season and would recommend it to those who may have missed the series when it aired.",3,Newlyweds - Nick & Jessica - The 1st Season,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1436,"['was', 'first', 'MTV', 'reality', 'series', 'watched', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'what', 'cute', 'couple', 'were', 'Hindsight', 'being', '20/20', 'vision', 'idea', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'reintroduce', 'couple', 'public', 'remind', 'viewers', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'pop', 'singers', 'who', 'were', 'still', 'struggling', 'reestablish', 'music', 'world', 'added', 'scrutiny', 'basically', 'world', 'allowed', 'private', 'lives', 'served', 'destroy', 'marriage', 'wonder', ""'d"", 'agree', 'do', 'again', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'such', 'shame', 'marriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', '10', 'episodes', 'are', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'now', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'ago', 'loved', 'how', 'down', 'earth', 'Nick', 'was', 'hanging', 'out', 'brother', 'stubbornly', 'moving', 'furniture', 'house', 'fighting', 'bees', 'fretting', 'music', 'video', 'solo', 'album', 'Jessica', 'seemed', 'sweet', 'hilarious', 'observations', 'were', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Nick', 'straight', 'man', 'remember', 'seasons', 'went', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'charming', 'one', 'tension', 'Nick', 'entire', 'Simpson', 'family', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'became', 'painful', 'watch', 'only', 'complaint', 'editing', 'discs', 'odd', 'Nick', 'Jessica', 'actual', 'songs', 'were', 'used', 'episodes', 'filming', 'videos', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'reliving', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'series', 'when', 'aired']",Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica: Season 1

856688,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00062IDZQ,Nicholas Carroll,"[49, 58]","...than this!  When I heard that Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson agreed to allow the first year of their married life to be filmed for a reality TV show on MTV, I thought what a brilliant career move on both their parts, though I couldn't imagine why anyone famous would want their already media-focused lives to be further open for public consumption.  Its a move that paid off...as there aren't many options available for a former member of a boy band once he's married off and the band is disbanded.  As far as boy bands go, I thought 98 Degrees was the best of the bunch, but with Justin Timberlake of NSYNC stealing most of the limelight, there just isn't a whole lot of use for boy band alumni.You had to know a show like this was waiting to happen.  Nick and Jessica are the human equivalent of Ken and Barbie, and even their mansion resembles everything perfect and plastic about that perfect model of couplehood that Mattel peddles to the masses since the 1950s.  Nick and Jessica are a likeable young couple and one can't help but watch at episodes in their lives that make interesting viewing.  I didn't expect it to be so funny, with most of the humor coming from Jessica's bimbo moments, saying things you just can't believe a person that successful wouldn't know about (such as the much talked about ""chicken or tuna"", ""I don't eat buffalo"", and her not knowing about bears prowling for food at night or what rigor mortis is).  It must be frustrating for Nick to deal with some of her ""dumb blonde moments"", but as she said in a game they played during a campfire: who needs intelligence when they have a body like hers?Because this show is much funnier than I expected and I happen to like Nick and Jessica as a couple and enjoy seeing them live as normal a life as they can (despite the limos, mansion, luxury cars, exotic vacations, and invitations to exclusive parties), I find this show to be one of the better reality television shows out there.  The camping episode was the best one, as you don't expect a glamourous and famous couple like theirs to ""rough it"" in the wilderness or go shopping on a whim at Home Depot.I also enjoyed the episode with the bees and Jessica's birthday party.  By the end of ten episodes, I found myself charmed by Jessica Simpson, for despite her ditziness, she is simply sweet, charming and seductive.  I fully understand why Nick is so taken with her, and that moment for me came when she chides her husband for eating a piece of the honeycomb and laughs at him when he starts spitting.  The special features were really nice, with intercut interviews of them both about the key moments in their relationship.  They each also contributed a video for this dvd set, and Jessica's (""Sweetest Sin"")is far superior to her husband's (""Shut Up"").  She sings it in a very sultry, seductive style that's hard to beat, and the video almost borders on racy sensuality between the two of them that should be kept private.In the end, you have to know that while they might not be as superstar a couple like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears were at one point, they do have a little bit more realism in their lives and a great sense of career moves to allow such an intrusive look into the most difficult year of anyone's marriage.  It might be an indication of narcissism on their part, but I don't think so.  At any rate, I do hope theirs is a marriage that will last the test of time, but that remains to be seen.

Are we so devoid of entertainment on television that we'll waste 30 minutes watching two married pop singers go about their day-to-day goings on? First of all let's analyze things here a bit, shall we? Are Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey so egotistical and self-absorbed that they think everyone would be interested in their rich and spoiled lives? This is a very frustrating and infuriating show to watch. Jessica Simpson is the epitome of the dumb blonde (she's naturally a brunette, by the way). She cannot function normally like the rest of us folks who don't make millions of dollars per year. She is a rich and whiny spoiled brat who is nauseating to watch. It's like watching a ten-year-old child in an adult's body. All she seems to be good at is spending money on stupid things and saying unintelligent things and speaking in a whiny, annoying voice. One episode of this crap was more than enough. Nick just looks fed up with her most of the time. I cannot wait until this couple is separated and divorced. Then will we get to watch Nick And Jessica's divorce court trial on dvd?? The only reasons this show came about were because MTV deemed it necessary, and because the recording careers of both Nick and Jessica needed a boost. I really feel sorry for those who rated this as five stars.

856690,A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B00062IDZQ,Preston,"[3, 6]","I saw some of that first season of Nick and Jessica.  Many times it was funny.  Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson obviously saw their average music careers boost with this MTV reality show.  Although this is a modern show, it reminds me so much of the old I Love Lucy shows of the '50s with Lucy Ricardo's squabbles with her husband Ricky Ricardo.  This time, it's Nick telling Jessica to do the laundry, what with clothes all over the floor. And rather than have someone else do it, Nick goes to Home Depot and does some home improvements in the home.  He's probably one of the few celebrities to attempt this when most of them have to have bodyguards around them. He even watches his favorite Cincinnati sports teams on TV, even screamed at the TV when the college basketball team missed shots. Jessica can say the silliest things when she approaches Nick and others. But sometimes the show can be invasive. TOO invasive! I hope that this doesn't become a pattern for TV to show the private lives of celebrities too much by filming their activities in their homes. They did it too with Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown and Travis Barker and his wife. It's hard to believe that this show was on MTV from 2003 to 2005. I know that some celebrities are our favorite stars, but we don't need to see everything. Some shows I tended to back off; just focused on the funnier moments. Lachey and Simpson tend to argue too much in some places that it seems uncomfortable to watch it. Some cameras should have stayed away.
