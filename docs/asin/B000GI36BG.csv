After searching the internet found pixel protector.  Was very skeptical if it would work, but for less than 50.00 what did I have to lose.  I have run it 3 times at the recommended times and found the burn in has reduced by 75% is suspect after running it a few more times it will be gone.  The calibration section is good but the lack of instructions make it hard to understand what you are trying to do.  I bought the Bluray version which is easier the screen washes will run until you stop them so you don't have to babysit as they are running.I would recommend this to anyone who has burn in.  If it is light you may find it will be removed after the first use.  Mine was very bad could actually read the channel logo it was on for weeks I'm sure being a demo unit.  After using the calibration the picture was much clearer and setting the color was easy.  I ran it on my other smaller plasma and was surprised at the overall clarity and colors are more true to life.",4,Works just takes more time,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1063,"['purchased', 'demo', 'model', 'Panasonic', 'TC-P54G10', 'found', 'had', 'bad', 'screen', 'burn', 'searching', 'internet', 'found', 'pixel', 'protector', 'Was', 'very', 'skeptical', 'would', 'work', 'less', '50.00', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'lose', 'have', 'run', '3', 'times', 'recommended', 'times', 'found', 'burn', 'reduced', '75', '%', 'suspect', 'running', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'calibration', 'section', 'good', 'lack', 'instructions', 'make', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'bought', 'Bluray', 'version', 'easier', 'screen', 'washes', 'will', 'run', 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'babysit', 'are', 'running.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'burn', 'light', 'may', 'find', 'will', 'be', 'removed', 'first', 'use', 'Mine', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'could', 'actually', 'read', 'channel', 'logo', 'was', 'weeks', ""'m"", 'sure', 'being', 'demo', 'unit', 'using', 'calibration', 'picture', 'was', 'much', 'clearer', 'setting', 'color', 'was', 'easy', 'ran', 'other', 'smaller', 'plasma', 'was', 'surprised', 'overall', 'clarity', 'colors', 'are', 'more', 'true', 'life']",PixelProtector Edition V2

I have the same Pioneer unit with exactly the same flashing red pixel and thought I would have described the problem with my plasma in identical fashion. That being said, I spent over thirty hours attempting to achieve any improvement in either the flashing red pixel and/or picture quality. In the end, I was unable to achieve any improvement whatsoever.I sent an e-mail to the companies website and described my problem and asked for help and I did not receive any response.Fortunately, Amazon has a return policy so I returned this useless DVD.Any review reporting any positive improvement in picture from use of this ""Pixel Protector"" is more likely the result of a psychosomatic and hopeful perception rather than any objectively verifiable visual improvement.I could NOT recommend this product to others.",1,This Pixel Protector DVD did absolutely nothing,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,922,"['When', 'first', 'read', 'Amazon', 'top', 'review', 'gave', 'hope', 'product', 'would', 'actually', 'help', 'plasma', 'problem', 'have', 'same', 'Pioneer', 'unit', 'exactly', 'same', 'flashing', 'red', 'pixel', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'described', 'problem', 'plasma', 'identical', 'fashion', 'being', 'said', 'spent', 'thirty', 'hours', 'attempting', 'achieve', 'improvement', 'flashing', 'red', 'pixel', 'and/or', 'picture', 'quality', 'end', 'was', 'unable', 'achieve', 'improvement', 'whatsoever.I', 'sent', 'e-mail', 'companies', 'website', 'described', 'problem', 'asked', 'help', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'response.Fortunately', 'Amazon', 'return', 'policy', 'returned', 'useless', 'DVD.Any', 'review', 'reporting', 'positive', 'improvement', 'picture', 'use', 'Pixel', 'Protector', 'more', 'likely', 'result', 'psychosomatic', 'hopeful', 'perception', 'rather', 'objectively', 'verifiable', 'visual', 'improvement.I', 'could', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'product', 'others']",PixelProtector Edition V2
1004336,A3RA8EWNSA85H4,B000GI36BG,Michael McCann,"[13, 14]","I bought this because I had a ""stuck pixel"" on my somewhat older Pioneer Plasma monitor model 5030 HD.  This monitor was over 7 grand, so I must say I FREAKED OUT when there was a tiny red blinking star on the screen!  My eye went right to it EVERY time.  At first I thought this DVD was a ripoff (3 screen washers and various ""calibrators"").  I think patience is the key with this product....I first used a software called JScreen Fix (as the 50"" display is my pc monitor too!) This did not work on its own.  After running the various WASHERS on Pixel Protector, much of the plasma ghosting was gone.  After a few times, the stuck pixel was gone too.  Don't try to use this for a 1/2 hour and say it didn't work.  Patience is the key.  Let it run for the 6 to 7 hours, then try the other washers (2 & 3).  I did see an improventment and the red dot is thankfully gone!  Would it have gone away on its own?  Not sure.

Have LED LCD TVs in the house and at least once a month run each of the Pixel Washes for several hours. Brightens up the picture quality and sharpens the video as well, in the before and after reviewing. Have recommended this to many people. Only one person has ever gotten back to me, and he stated that he couldn't believe how the washes revived his old Sony CRT that he'd just about given up on, plus his new LED LCD as well. Several people have scoffed at me using it on LCD screens, but just told them to try it and see for themselves!
