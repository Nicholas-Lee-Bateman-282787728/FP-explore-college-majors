204114,AFFWO3PJ42SWK,630018384X,"AH ""Fight On Trojans""","[2, 2]","First of all, I won't even begin to say this is a GREAT movie.  Did I enjoy it when I was younger?  Of course!  But I was in my early teens, and this movie had some boobies.  That was about the only criteria for me back then.  But because I'm a nostalgic, I was thinking, &#34;you know, I wonder if &#34;The Wild Life&#34; is available on DVD.  Not thinking it would be, I was VERY surprised to see it.But I admit, I was also reticent to order it, because I noticed it was a DVD-R...and as we've all seen, many times a DVD-R disc has very 'average' quality at best.Boy was I wrong on this one!!!  Not only was it widescreen (figured it'd be a 4:3), but the quality was quite good!  Is it blu-ray?  No, but it's a VERY high quality DVD.  Especially for a movie that is so out-of-rotation that it probably shouldn't even have a DVD release.Again, am I recommending the movie?  Well, not really...because it is a rather silly mid-80's attempt to cash in on Fast Times At Ridgemont High (they even cast Chris Penn, Sean's brother, to play the same sort of lunkhead pot smoker that Sean played in FTARH).  But if you liked it back then, and would like a silly memory in your DVD collection, and actually enjoy the quality of the DVD, then by all means, buy this one!",5,Surprising quality!,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1261,"['First', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'say', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'Did', 'enjoy', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'course', 'was', 'early', 'teens', 'movie', 'had', 'boobies', 'was', 'only', 'criteria', 'back', 'then', ""'m"", 'nostalgic', 'was', 'thinking', '34', 'know', 'wonder', '34', 'Wild', 'Life', '34', 'available', 'DVD', 'Not', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'VERY', 'surprised', 'see', 'it.But', 'admit', 'was', 'also', 'reticent', 'order', 'noticed', 'was', 'DVD-R', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'DVD-R', 'disc', 'very', ""'average"", 'quality', 'best.Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'one', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'widescreen', 'figured', ""'d"", 'be', '4:3', 'quality', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'blu-ray', 'No', 'VERY', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Especially', 'movie', 'so', 'out-of-rotation', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'DVD', 'release.Again', 'am', 'recommending', 'movie', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'rather', 'silly', 'mid-80', 'attempt', 'cash', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'even', 'cast', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'Sean', 'brother', 'play', 'same', 'sort', 'lunkhead', 'pot', 'smoker', 'Sean', 'played', 'FTARH', 'liked', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'like', 'silly', 'memory', 'DVD', 'collection', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'quality', 'DVD', 'then', 'means', 'buy', 'one']","Wild Life, The VHS"

The picture is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  The film timed out for me in 96:30 and seemed complete.  There are no extras at all.  When I put the disc in my player, the film just started.  When it was done, the DVD stopped, sending the screen went back to the DVD player's default one.  One change noticed was in the music credits.  My VHS shows eleven song credits.  The DVD shows the same eleven with eight additional ones.  There was a note that the original soundtrack was available elsewhere.The film itself is a series of lightly linked stories filmed in greater Los Angeles.  Party boy Tom Drake (Chris Penn) has a summer job in a bowling alley working with studious high school graduate pal Bill Conrad (Eric Stolz).  Tom wants Eileen (Jenny Wright), who works the summer as a clothing salesperson for Harry (Rick Moranis), but wants more than Tom.  Bill has just broken up with Anita (Lea Thompson) but is still alarmed to learn that she may have a new boyfriend, David (Hart Bochner), who turns out to be a police patrolman.  Bill also plans to move out of his home to a glamorous apartment and live &#34;the wild life&#34;.  Bill's younger brother, Jim (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) obsesses over the Vietnam War and finds ways to reenact various aspects of that war vicariously.  He has a doting pal, Tony (Brin Berliner), and a possible veteran hero, Charlie (Randy Quaid), who has maybe too many problems for Jim to feel comfortable with.  The various stories all have happy-enough resolutions.  The acting was solid.The film is rated &#34;R&#34;.  There are no language issues.  Only one person has an explicit drinking or drug problem.  There are a few fist fights.  There are a couple of explosions damaging property.  There are various forms of bad, risk-seeking behavior, including wild parties and adultery.  Probably the key to the rating is the amount of skin shown.  We get Jim, Eileen, Bill, Tom, two female strippers, and a number of party people of both sexes giving the traditional T&A; shots.It's all good fun, without any particular insights.",3,DVD Edition of High School Summer Transitions,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,2259,"['review', 'Universal', 'made-to-order', 'DVD', 'edition', '34', 'Wild', 'Life', '34', '.The', 'film', 'picture', 'not', 'high-definition', 'big', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'edition', 'got', 'years', 'ago', 'picture', '1.85:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'film', 'timed', 'out', '96:30', 'seemed', 'complete', 'are', 'extras', 'When', 'put', 'disc', 'player', 'film', 'just', 'started', 'When', 'was', 'done', 'DVD', 'stopped', 'sending', 'screen', 'went', 'back', 'DVD', 'player', 'default', 'one', 'One', 'change', 'noticed', 'was', 'music', 'credits', 'VHS', 'shows', 'eleven', 'song', 'credits', 'DVD', 'same', 'eleven', 'eight', 'additional', 'ones', 'was', 'note', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'available', 'elsewhere.The', 'film', 'series', 'lightly', 'linked', 'stories', 'filmed', 'greater', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Party', 'boy', 'Tom', 'Drake', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'summer', 'job', 'bowling', 'alley', 'working', 'studious', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'pal', 'Bill', 'Conrad', 'Eric', 'Stolz', 'Tom', 'Eileen', 'Jenny', 'Wright', 'who', 'summer', 'clothing', 'salesperson', 'Harry', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'more', 'Tom', 'Bill', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'Anita', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'still', 'alarmed', 'learn', 'may', 'have', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'David', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'police', 'patrolman', 'Bill', 'also', 'move', 'home', 'glamorous', 'apartment', 'live', '34', 'wild', 'life', '34', 'Bill', 'younger', 'brother', 'Jim', 'Ilan', 'Mitchell-Smith', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'ways', 'reenact', 'various', 'aspects', 'war', 'vicariously', 'doting', 'pal', 'Tony', 'Brin', 'Berliner', 'possible', 'veteran', 'hero', 'Charlie', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'who', 'maybe', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'Jim', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'various', 'stories', 'have', 'happy-enough', 'resolutions', 'acting', 'was', 'solid.The', 'film', 'rated', '34', 'R', '34', 'are', 'language', 'issues', 'Only', 'one', 'person', 'explicit', 'drinking', 'drug', 'problem', 'are', 'few', 'fist', 'fights', 'are', 'couple', 'explosions', 'damaging', 'property', 'are', 'various', 'forms', 'bad', 'risk-seeking', 'behavior', 'including', 'wild', 'parties', 'adultery', 'Probably', 'key', 'rating', 'amount', 'skin', 'shown', 'get', 'Jim', 'Eileen', 'Bill', 'Tom', 'two', 'female', 'strippers', 'number', 'party', 'people', 'sexes', 'giving', 'traditional', 'T', 'A', 'shots.It', 'good', 'fun', 'particular', 'insights']","Wild Life, The VHS"

The only bloat in the present film is several hundred high schoolers marching and singing through the nighttime streets.This 1933 film has some sensational aspects about the warped justice system, gangsterism, shootings, and sexual abuse of a young woman--and snippets could surely add up to a hot preview. Though the Motion Picture Production Code had been adopted in 1930, it was not enforced until 1934, so this picture slipped through the crack.This Day and Age was the fifth of director DeMille's sound films--so no problem with that aspect. His direction is good and earnest--he doesn't just shrug off this ""minor"" assignment, while saving himself for Cleopatra (1934) and The Crusades (1935).As for the quality of the dvd image, I find it quite satisfactory for a vintage film.STRANGE BUT TRUEHigh school seniors assemble to hear the Principal (John Caradine, credited as John Peter Richmond) announce the several males who, as a civics project, will assume city offices such as mayor, district attorney, police chief. It's a casual concept until a warmly regarded  Jewish tailor is shot dead by protection-racketeer Charles Bickford--which student ""D.A."" Richard Cromwell witnesses (this actor is 23, so doesn't look boyish). When the court case is quashed by Bickford's mouthpiece, disillusioned Cromwell decides he and his buddies will strike back with their own unethical means. Caught up in this dangerous situation is Cromwell's girlfriend, Judith Allen (this actress is 22), who bravely endures the advances of a Bickford henchman and, cornered in a hotel room, is subjected to some impure innuendo. Bickford is finally kidnapped by senior boys, and crumbles under their noose and rat pit, and is paraded through the streets by the large ""manly"" chorus right into the judge's chamber.A LITTLE SURPRISEAs students surge up the high school stairs, several black students are included, one in a spiffy Reserve Officers Training Corps uniform. Later he assists in waylaying Bickford by masquerading as a shoeshine boy and rattling on like Step 'n Fetchit. I considered it a nice touch, not demeaning then or now.-----NO, I don't think this is a film of great merit. But it's a good example of DeMille's professionalism, and it's a curiosity as mob action led by kinda oblivious seniors saves the day.",4,"""The FIRST Great Spectacle of Modern Times""...",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,2449,"['vintage', 'poster', 'dvd', 'case', 'was', 'just', 'lure', 'public', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'mesmerized', 'Sign', 'Cross', '1932', 'only', 'bloat', 'present', 'film', 'several', 'hundred', 'high', 'schoolers', 'marching', 'singing', 'nighttime', 'streets.This', '1933', 'film', 'sensational', 'aspects', 'warped', 'justice', 'system', 'gangsterism', 'shootings', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'young', 'woman', 'snippets', 'could', 'surely', 'add', 'up', 'hot', 'preview', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Production', 'Code', 'had', 'been', 'adopted', '1930', 'was', 'not', 'enforced', '1934', 'picture', 'slipped', 'crack.This', 'Day', 'Age', 'was', 'fifth', 'director', 'DeMille', 'sound', 'films', 'so', 'problem', 'aspect', 'direction', 'good', 'earnest', ""n't"", 'just', 'shrug', 'off', 'minor', 'assignment', 'saving', 'Cleopatra', '1934', 'Crusades', '1935', '.As', 'quality', 'dvd', 'image', 'find', 'quite', 'satisfactory', 'vintage', 'film.STRANGE', 'BUT', 'TRUEHigh', 'school', 'seniors', 'assemble', 'hear', 'Principal', 'John', 'Caradine', 'credited', 'John', 'Peter', 'Richmond', 'several', 'males', 'who', 'civics', 'project', 'will', 'assume', 'city', 'offices', 'such', 'mayor', 'district', 'attorney', 'police', 'chief', 'casual', 'concept', 'warmly', 'regarded', 'Jewish', 'tailor', 'shot', 'dead', 'protection-racketeer', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'student', 'D.A', 'Richard', 'Cromwell', 'actor', '23', 'so', ""n't"", 'look', 'boyish', 'When', 'court', 'case', 'quashed', 'Bickford', 'mouthpiece', 'disillusioned', 'Cromwell', 'buddies', 'will', 'strike', 'back', 'own', 'unethical', 'means', 'Caught', 'up', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'Cromwell', 'girlfriend', 'Judith', 'Allen', 'actress', '22', 'who', 'bravely', 'advances', 'Bickford', 'henchman', 'cornered', 'hotel', 'room', 'subjected', 'impure', 'innuendo', 'Bickford', 'finally', 'kidnapped', 'senior', 'boys', 'crumbles', 'noose', 'rat', 'pit', 'paraded', 'streets', 'large', 'manly', 'chorus', 'right', 'judge', 'chamber.A', 'LITTLE', 'SURPRISEAs', 'students', 'surge', 'up', 'high', 'school', 'stairs', 'several', 'black', 'students', 'are', 'included', 'one', 'spiffy', 'Reserve', 'Officers', 'Training', 'Corps', 'uniform', 'Later', 'waylaying', 'Bickford', 'masquerading', 'shoeshine', 'boy', 'rattling', 'Step', 'n', 'Fetchit', 'considered', 'nice', 'touch', 'not', 'demeaning', 'then', 'now.', '-NO', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'great', 'merit', 'good', 'example', 'DeMille', 'professionalism', 'curiosity', 'mob', 'action', 'led', 'kinda', 'oblivious', 'seniors', 'day']","Wild Life, The VHS"
204123,A3L1JDO1MQ94GL,630018384X,J. Hudak,"[0, 0]","This is one of the more unusual films in Cecil B. DeMille's resume.  It was made before he devoted his entire career to fully mainstream entertainment and spectacle, a time when DeMille wasn't afraid to satirize modern culture and society as he did in entertaining oddities like &#34;Madame Satan&#34; and &#34;Four Frightened People&#34;--the latter which flopped and burned DeMille from attempting such risky ventures again.A previous review called this mere &#34;Depression-era rabble rousing.&#34;  While there might be a tiny grain of truth, there is nothing in this movie that suggested the unrest was caused by the Depression.  The real enemy of this film is an underworld boss that corrupted the local government to such a degree that even the mayor is on the take.  And this isn't one of those loveable Edward Brophy types of gang leaders that you kinda want to stay on top.  This one is a hard-core true to life gangster that kills innocent bystanders without so much as wincing and is able to spin the story in his favor.  Charles Bickford plays a superb antagonist in this, so contemptible that you can't help but to laugh at his plight once the students have their way with him.That's right, students.  The main protagonists are graduating seniors who dream of building a better tomorrow once they get out in the real world.  But once a local shop (and shopkeeper) gets blown to bits for refusing to pay protection money and one of the now-orphaned law students expects to see the great American justice system that they read so much about in school deliver some well-deserved justice.  Except he doesn't.  In fact, the student is so disillusioned by the injustice he just witnessed that he decides to hire some friends to sleuth for more clues Hardy Boys style.  But even this fails to the point of the unjust imprisonment of a student.This is where the satire really sets in, the sort of fantastic situation students and adults alike wish could happen in such a situation.  I won't spoil it much further but the students decide to take the law into their own hands and deliver some tried and true high-school justice to the town bully in a surprisingly unique way.  There are some serious laugh-out loud moments throughout.That same reviewer I mentioned earlier also states that the students marching was &#34;eerily similar to a Fascist rally.&#34;  Hardly.  About as much as a typical homecoming march could pass as a Nazi rally.  In fact, it would have been lambasted as Communist propaganda had it been released 10 years later with its depiction of the student intelligentsia leading a march on city hall.  Out of context, it seems that way but it much more in the vein of &#34;populism&#34;, local communities banding together against an identifiable force of tyranny, much like some Frank Capra films.  There are no pro-Red or pro-Nazi speeches in this, so any such label is up to very warped and strained (and mistaken) interpretation.This is certainly a pre-code film, but not in the usual sense.  Sure, there are skimpier outfits worn by the women in Bickford's night club but the bigger difference is how the American justice system is portrayed.  One year later, the Production Code of America would ban any depiction of a corrupt judge or an unjust trial in contemporary times, additionally strongly limiting depictions corruption or incompetence of the police department.  This ban remained until the PCA dissolved in the late 60s when coincidentally such depictions of the &#34;establishment&#34; were all the rage.The DVD transfer itself keeps this from getting 5 stars.  It's old, probably sourced from a laserdisc-era video print.  Satisfactory by 1990s standards, but pretty weak when viewing on anything larger than a 20&#34; TV screen.

204127,A14VQ55F6O49C1,630018384X,Tommy,"[12, 12]","In high school, I watched this movie every time it was on and it is still entertaining 22 years later. People assume this is a ""sequel"" To Fast Times At Ridgemont High. It was written by Cameron Crowe (who wrote Fast Times) and stars Chris Penn (Sean's brother). It was directed by Art Linson (who produced Fast Times) but it IS its own film. I like to think of it as a companion movie to Fast Times. What happens immediately AFTER high school? The Wild Life tackles that question and does a great job at it. The character of Jim (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) was me in high school. I was 15 when the Wild Life came out, so Jim was the character that I could relate to the most. I lived with my single mom and sister. I was obsessed with Vietnam (and WW2). I also wore camouflage pants to school about 3 days a week, hated authority figures and hung out in a bowling alley (as well as the mall arcade). The other characters are also interesting as well, but Jim was just the one that ""clicked"" with me. I assume Cameron Crowe based these people on real life versions just like he did with his Fast Times script and chances are, you will relate to someone in this film. I have always liked Eric Stoltz and in this he plays the straight guy to Chris Penn's obnoxious character. They work well together, but it's a friendship of necessity not choice. This is a much more serious film than Fast Times but still has some great, funny moments. Cool soundtrack with ORIGINAL songs by Bananarama and Eddie Van Halen. Release a dvd Universal. Don't underestimate the fan base for this film! A whole generation watched The Wild Life on cable over and over again.
