An amazing actor. An amazing performance. Granted, this is translated from the stage to the cinema, but it is quite affecting in expressing the character that was Huey P. Newton, and his explosive personality and his intellect. As great a character as Newton is, Guenveur Smith's intense and deeply expressed performance outdoes the imagery, the music, even the text. As an actor, this is a master class in deep and committed artistry.",5,Phenomenal performance of a powerful man,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,600,"['do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'Roger', 'Guenveur', 'Smith', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'other', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'joints', 'then', 'piece', 'will', 'introduce', 'amazing', 'actor', 'amazing', 'actor', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Granted', 'translated', 'stage', 'cinema', 'quite', 'affecting', 'expressing', 'character', 'was', 'Huey', 'P.', 'Newton', 'explosive', 'personality', 'intellect', 'great', 'character', 'Newton', 'Guenveur', 'Smith', 'intense', 'deeply', 'expressed', 'performance', 'imagery', 'music', 'even', 'text', 'actor', 'master', 'class', 'deep', 'committed', 'artistry']",A Huey P.

The simplicity of the frame, the silhouettes in the background and the passion of the actor, Roger Guenveur Smith, all pulled me into a story that I think deserves every ounce of this focus and talent.  This is the kind of drama that needs to be watched several times before making ""final"" judgment -but even after watching it only once you will be touched and want to learn more about Huey and the movement.

Up to the point when i seen this movie, if you told me the mans name I would have had no idea who he was, but now I do. I saw this movie the first time on tv. I was channel surfing and I came across this movie. After watching it for a sec. I could not turn the channel. Roger Guenveur Smith is absolutly wonderful in this movie. I was blown away. Such passion in his acting. I still don't know much about Huey P. Newton, but watching this movie has changed my perspective on what the Black Panthers were all about. Check this movie out.
