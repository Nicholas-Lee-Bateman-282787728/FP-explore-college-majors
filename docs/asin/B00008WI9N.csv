748342,A2N9OENVXDF643,B00008WI9N,Brian M. Benway,"[5, 7]","Love Liza, written with Philip Seymour Hoffman in mind, is a showcase for arguably one of the greatest contemporary actors working in film.  Hoffman portrays Wilson, whose wife unexpectedly took her own life, leaving him with only memories and a suicide note he is too afraid to read.  Unable to cope, Wilson turns to huffing gas to dull his senses, and it is a move that plunges his life further into ruin.  Along the way, the film explores the friendships Wilson has forged with his mother-in-law and an unusual RC toy enthusiast.With each cleverly-framed shot, director Todd Louiso effectively portrays the sense of isolation and solitude that the film's protagonist must be experiencing, and Hoffman's characterization of Wilson is absolutely devastating in its effectiveness.However, on some level, Love Liza fails.  Obviously meant as a character study, Love Liza loses a great deal of its effect in the fact that the supplementary characters don't really possess a lot of depth, nor do they help elucidate much depth in Wilson's character.  The plot is rather thin at times, and doesn't really explain how Wilson gets hooked on huffing.  Was this something he did before his wife's death, or something new he does to cope?However, the movie is redeemed in part by the denoument, which ends in a way both predictable and unexpected, though I won't divulge any details.All in all Love Liza, is an excellent showcase for Hoffman's talents, but it falls a little flat by underplaying its potential for emotional effect.",3,A Hoffman showcase,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,1522,"['Love', 'Liza', 'written', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'mind', 'showcase', 'arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'contemporary', 'actors', 'working', 'film', 'Hoffman', 'Wilson', 'wife', 'unexpectedly', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'leaving', 'only', 'memories', 'suicide', 'note', 'too', 'afraid', 'read', 'Unable', 'cope', 'Wilson', 'huffing', 'gas', 'dull', 'senses', 'move', 'life', 'further', 'ruin', 'way', 'film', 'friendships', 'Wilson', 'forged', 'mother-in-law', 'unusual', 'RC', 'toy', 'cleverly-framed', 'shot', 'director', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'effectively', 'sense', 'isolation', 'solitude', 'film', 'protagonist', 'must', 'be', 'experiencing', 'Hoffman', 'characterization', 'Wilson', 'absolutely', 'devastating', 'effectiveness.However', 'level', 'Love', 'Liza', 'Obviously', 'meant', 'character', 'study', 'Love', 'Liza', 'great', 'deal', 'effect', 'fact', 'supplementary', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'possess', 'lot', 'depth', 'do', 'help', 'elucidate', 'much', 'depth', 'Wilson', 'character', 'plot', 'rather', 'thin', 'times', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'how', 'Wilson', 'hooked', 'huffing', 'Was', 'something', 'did', 'wife', 'death', 'something', 'new', 'cope', 'However', 'movie', 'redeemed', 'part', 'denoument', 'way', 'predictable', 'unexpected', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'details.All', 'Love', 'Liza', 'excellent', 'showcase', 'Hoffman', 'talents', 'little', 'flat', 'underplaying', 'potential', 'emotional', 'effect']",Love Liza

Depressed and abusing himself.Unlike LLV, this one does have displays of caring and touching characters that help keep the movie entertaining. It's like a adventure movie to discovery of one's plight and characters that intermingle very well into the film.If I was to suggest this to anyone,I would say this:IF YOU ENTIRELY LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT &quot;LEAVING LAS VEGAS&quot;, then you should love everything about &quot;Love Liza&quot;.Has the same qualities and story telling as that classic.

It involves a character named Wilson Joel, played by Hoffman, and his inability to deal with his wife's recent demise by means of suicide.  He finds a letter left to him by his wife, presumably a suicide note, but is unable to find the strength to open it and read the letter.  Instead, he carries it around with him, maybe as a link to his wife, but also seeming to lack the courage to open the letter and see what his wifes last thoughts were.  He starts a slow, downward spiral as he becomes addicted to huffing gas, or taking a rag soaked with gasoline and putting up to his mouth and nose, deeply inhaling the fumes as a means to escape reality.Problems start developing when he starts having difficulty hiding this habit, and at one point he makes up a lie about being involved in radio control (RC) planes to cover the gas smell in his house.  A friend introduces Wilson to Denny, played by Jack Kehler, who is a true RC buff and they develop a tenuous friendship.  Wilson gloms on to Denny and his passion for RC, and the scene where they meet up at a RC competition is really very funny.Anyway, Wilsons' life keeps going sour due to his avoidance of the inevitable, and we're along for the ride.  His career, along with whatever personal relationships he has start to deteriorate.  The scenes where Wilson huffs the gas from the rags were pretty hard for me to watch, as they made me somewhat queasy.  There are some genuinely funny scenes, but ultimately this is one man's sad decent into his own person hell.  I thought Kathy Bates character as Wilson mother in law was quite good.This movie is not for everyone, as there are quite a few questions that never get answered, but then life can be like that.",4,A tragic comedy,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,1792,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'difficult', 'times', 'watch', 'character', 'named', 'Wilson', 'Joel', 'played', 'Hoffman', 'inability', 'deal', 'wife', 'recent', 'demise', 'means', 'suicide', 'letter', 'left', 'wife', 'presumably', 'suicide', 'note', 'unable', 'find', 'strength', 'open', 'read', 'letter', 'Instead', 'maybe', 'link', 'wife', 'also', 'seeming', 'lack', 'courage', 'open', 'letter', 'see', 'what', 'wifes', 'last', 'thoughts', 'were', 'slow', 'downward', 'spiral', 'addicted', 'huffing', 'gas', 'taking', 'rag', 'soaked', 'gasoline', 'putting', 'up', 'mouth', 'nose', 'deeply', 'inhaling', 'fumes', 'means', 'escape', 'reality.Problems', 'start', 'developing', 'when', 'having', 'difficulty', 'hiding', 'habit', 'one', 'point', 'up', 'lie', 'being', 'involved', 'radio', 'control', 'RC', 'planes', 'cover', 'gas', 'smell', 'house', 'friend', 'Wilson', 'Denny', 'played', 'Jack', 'Kehler', 'who', 'true', 'RC', 'buff', 'develop', 'tenuous', 'friendship', 'Wilson', 'gloms', 'Denny', 'passion', 'RC', 'scene', 'where', 'meet', 'up', 'RC', 'competition', 'really', 'very', 'funny.Anyway', 'Wilsons', 'life', 'keeps', 'going', 'sour', 'due', 'avoidance', 'inevitable', ""'re"", 'ride', 'career', 'personal', 'relationships', 'start', 'deteriorate', 'scenes', 'where', 'Wilson', 'gas', 'rags', 'were', 'pretty', 'hard', 'watch', 'made', 'somewhat', 'queasy', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'scenes', 'ultimately', 'one', 'man', 'sad', 'decent', 'own', 'person', 'hell', 'thought', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'character', 'Wilson', 'mother', 'law', 'was', 'quite', 'good.This', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'questions', 'never', 'get', 'answered', 'then', 'life', 'can', 'be']",Love Liza

748348,A84UFSF2SZS2W,B00008WI9N,"EriKa ""E""","[4, 12]","Love Liza is a bizarre little film, very slow moving and incomprehensible, as though the viewer is supposed to be as unclear and dazed as its main character, Wilson Joel (always excellent Philip Seymour Hoffman). Wilson Joel is aimlessly drifting, a grief-stricken widower. He lives in a state of perpetual denial, unable to cope with the fact that his wife has committed suicide without explanation (although she has left behind a letter he refuses to open, much to the anger and disappointment of his dead wife's mother, played by Kathy Bates). In ""coping"" (if you could call it that) with his grief, he neglects his work, becomes addicted to huffing gasoline, and obsesses about remote-operated vehicles. His friends and colleagues begin to worry about him, but also seem to have a certain disdain for his increasingly erratic behavior. Unfortunately this is a very real part of grief: the grieving party just is not ready to move on and feels like self-destructing but the rest of society expects grief to be contained and temporary, like you can put it on and take it off so simply. While Hoffman's performance here is solid, the story is a bit too bizarre and off the beaten path. While there is nothing inherently wrong with ""off the beaten path"", I would say this one gets a little lost in the woods. Though it might well portray accurately and sensitively the various stages of denial, loss, grief and acceptance as they occur, it meanders and lacks a certain concision. However, as a debut by director Todd Louiso, it is promising.

Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Bates are two great talents vastly wasted in this film. With careful pruning this would have made a fascinating short, both hilarious and heart breaking. As it is the extended scenes of Hoffman's exhibitions of grief, gas sniffing, waking up in various locales, staring into space or at the unopened envelope containing his wife's suicide note become quickly wearisome.Then there are touches of brilliance such as the two recurring gas sniffing teens lending a wonderful, bizarre, John Waters quality.Talented as Mr. Hoffman is, he has of late played a string of characters too similar in their compositional make-up and offering far to minimal variance. This necessitates doing that actor thing: substituting &quot;acting&quot; for emotion, drawing attention to the &quot;acting&quot; rather than the story, inspiring a certain type of audience to say - usually during the movie: What A Great Actor! He probably does a job than probably anyone else could have with this material, and therein lies the problem: the screenplay. Great monologues, dialogue, etc. are not always necessary to make great cinematic art, but a too heavy reliance on blank stares, forced smiles, odd characters, nervous laughter and long shots does not automatically equate great art either.

There is little in way of symbolism or lessons learned in this film, it merely tells of a man who tragically loses his wife to suicide and attempts to comment no further. If watching a movie that attempts to challenge your patience for the sadness is something you enjoy then Love Liza would be recommended, but the film simply lacks the meat that exists in so many films that are meant to entertain and/or to make you think.On the upswing we get to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a feature role where he is free to do what he does better than anyone...whine, gripe and look utterly disoriented. He is a fantastic actor and this role sharpens and showcases his talents brilliantly. Kathy Bates is also very enjoyable as his mother in law, the mother of his late wife.One thing is for sure, you'll be sad and wanting more from this film but part of that is intentional. It's a small movie in more ways than one but if you've enjoyed Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Boogie Nights or Happiness, this is his reprisal of those roles in some respects and we seem to get an even closer look as he takes it to another level here...that counts for something.

748357,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B00008WI9N,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[2, 7]","It is really, really difficult to know what to make of this film. On the one hand, it is a decent, honest, and well-acted character study of a man whose life spins out of control despite his best (?) efforts after his wife commits suicide. On the other hand, it can come off at times as a self-indulgent pity-party that you can't help but wonder why you are watching. As extreme as these two 'takes' are, the film is both of them.I won't be saying anything that hasn't been said when I tout Philip Seymour Hoffman's gut-wrenching portrayal of the protagonist; he conveys the loneliness and, one might say, futility that our main character, Wilson, must feel. Equally strong is Kathy Bates' portrayal of Wilson's mother in law - a woman trying both to come to terms with her daughter's suicide and her son-in-laws increasingly dangerous and irratic behavior. Together, these two alone make the film a good overall effort.But then there is the script and story. If all the above sounds unduly depressing, that is because it is. Now, dark films tend to work best when (a) you get to know the characters enough to care about them and (b) there is at least some bright spots or redeeming moments in the film. This film, I'm sorry to say, has neither quality. In fact, the major flaw seems to be that by the end of the film, we know precious little about Wilson and nothing about his deceased wife and their relationship. By the end, one can't help but wonder why, without having been provided any info on these characters by way of 'backstory,' we were supposed to care so much about them - obviously the intent of the film all along.As I tend to be a sucker for downtrodden films like this one, I came away liking &quot;Love Liza&quot; more than not. However, this is a film that I would literally be embarassed to show any of my friends because, in the end, it is simply a bit TOO dark and, if I may be so bold, lacking in tact or message.But I will give the film three stars, on the condition that, as other reviewers have stated, the prospective viewer knows what they are getting themselves into. If you liked films like 'Leaving Las Vegas,' and more recently, 'House of Sand and Fog,' then there is a chance that you will take to 'Love Liza' as well. (If you didn't enjoy those filsm, this one isn't for you). Just keep in mind that even the darkest of movie-lovers may, in the end, find the onslaught of this film, combined with its lack of depth, a bit too much in the end.

I can't think of a single other performer (perhaps maybe Billy Bob Thornton) who could have carried this off. Hoffman's pain is the audience's pain. His compulsion to dull the pain (by, of all things, huffing gasoline) is sadly understandable, even familiar. He's trapped. He can see no other acceptable way out.He sleeps on the floor because it's the only place in his home (the home where his wife committed suicide) where he CAN sleep. He should move out, buy a new place.His obnoxious mother-in-law (also grieving) only reminds him of his pain. He should reach out to her - they can help each other work through this pain. His mother-in-law understands their need for each other - he does not.A profession of attraction for him from a colleague only reminds him of his loss and desolation, causing him to sprint back to his increasingly grim, wood panelled abode where he huffs fumes to the point of delirium, ultimately taking off for days on a bizarre odyssey involving miniature boat racing and his only would-be friend, a hobbyist whose friendship he ultimately rejects.People who care about him are everywhere - yet he pushes each and every one of them away. Toward the end of the film, his desperation is palpable and his home has become a mausoleum - empty, desolate, full of fumes (can you smell them?), and his own, almost dead, soul. Almost.He can run. But he cannot hide, from himself, or from God. Hoffman's embarassment, cowardice and fear are achingly real. This intimate film makes us feel his pain yet not reject him for his failings. Who among us is unlike him? Do you dare to look down your nose at his suffering?The ending to this film is oddly satisfying.

Then it did come out, and very quickly faded from view. Those tracking it down these years later will quickly figure out why: while Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is, in fact, exceptional, there's not a single other thing about this movie to recommend it.Hoffman plays Wilson Joel, a web designer whose wife Liza (Runaway Jury's Annie Morgan) commits suicide. She leaves a note, which Wilson is afraid to open. Liza's mother Mary Ann (Kathy Bates) tries to find new ways to broach the subject with every conversation. Feeling cornered, Wilson turns to drugs, and his life quickly begins to spiral out of control. Adding to the pressure is co-worker Maura (That Thing You Do! beauty Sarah Koskoff), who's attracted to Wilson. He takes refuge in developing a new obsession with model aircraft, which only makes things worse.Hoffman does a fine job with what is, in essence, a really demented role. But so little of what goes on around him works that even that can't be counted a success. This was obviously meant as a comedy, however black it may be; its comic timing fails to fire every time. No, really, every time. Not a laugh to be had, however nervous or guilty that laugh might be. Instead, there's a vague sense of discomfort, the kind you get when someone's told a horribly offensive joke without in any way realizing there's an offensive component to it. **",2,"Hoffman is excellent as usual, but not enough to carry this.",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1492,"['Love', 'Liza', 'Todd', 'Louiso', '2002', 'Much', 'was', 'made', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'Love', 'Liza', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Then', 'did', 'come', 'out', 'very', 'quickly', 'faded', 'view', 'tracking', 'years', 'later', 'will', 'quickly', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'fact', 'exceptional', 'not', 'single', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'recommend', 'it.Hoffman', 'Wilson', 'Joel', 'web', 'designer', 'wife', 'Liza', 'Runaway', 'Jury', 'Annie', 'Morgan', 'suicide', 'note', 'Wilson', 'afraid', 'open', 'Liza', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'find', 'new', 'ways', 'broach', 'subject', 'conversation', 'Feeling', 'cornered', 'Wilson', 'drugs', 'life', 'quickly', 'spiral', 'control', 'Adding', 'pressure', 'co-worker', 'Maura', 'Thing', 'Do', 'beauty', 'Sarah', 'Koskoff', 'who', 'attracted', 'Wilson', 'refuge', 'developing', 'new', 'obsession', 'model', 'aircraft', 'only', 'things', 'worse.Hoffman', 'fine', 'job', 'what', 'essence', 'really', 'demented', 'role', 'so', 'little', 'what', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'counted', 'success', 'was', 'obviously', 'meant', 'comedy', 'however', 'black', 'may', 'be', 'comic', 'timing', 'fails', 'fire', 'time', 'No', 'really', 'time', 'Not', 'laugh', 'be', 'had', 'however', 'nervous', 'guilty', 'laugh', 'might', 'be', 'Instead', 'vague', 'sense', 'discomfort', 'kind', 'get', 'when', 'someone', 'told', 'horribly', 'offensive', 'joke', 'way', 'realizing', 'offensive', 'component', '**']",Love Liza

Wilson first finds himself unable to sleep in the same bed he used to share with his wife.  Then he returns to the place where they spent their honeymoon in a vain attempt to find some solace or answers there.  Then there's the turn towards self-destruction as he seeks escape from his pain by inhaling mass quantities of gasoline.  All along the way, well-meaning friends, colleagues and family members proffer what they can in the way of support and sympathy but, invariably, they find themselves ill-equipped to deal with grief at this level of intensity.  This is even the case with Mary Ann, Wilson's understanding mother-in-law, who is having to cope with her son-in-law's dysfunction while also dealing with her own grief at the loss of her daughter.The title of the film comes from a signed suicide note Liza left to Wilson under his pillow.  That letter, which Wilson cannot bring himself to open, only adds to the man's despair, for he fears it may reveal that he was somehow responsible for his wife's actions. Thus, wracked with guilt as well as grief, Wilson slides ever further into that deep dark hole of despair.  The filmmakers, in an effort to mitigate some of the misery inherent in the subject matter, invest the story with a number of sly, quirky touches, such as Wilson's sudden obsession with mechanized toy airplanes.  But the overwhelming sadness is never far from the film's surface.""Love Liza"" is, at its core, an actor's film - and the cast proves itself worthy of the challenge.  Hoffman's portrait of a man whose entire meaning for existence has been knocked out from under him is devastating in its understatement and power.  Kathy Bates turns in an equally fine and subdued performance as his grieving mother-in-law, and Sarah Koskoff and Jack Kehler offer fine support.Is ""Love Liza"" a ""dark"" film?  Absolutely.  But it is also a brave, insightful and compelling one for those willing to enter its world.

748366,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00008WI9N,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[4, 5]","I like this movie for what it tries to be and for its willingness to take big risks with a subject that audiences don't like to deal with -- grief. It is somehow unAmerican to linger long with feelings of loss. A whole grief counseling industry has sprung up around our need to achieve &quot;closure&quot; when someone we love dies. We are impatient with the person who makes us uncomfortable with their inability to get on with living, even replacing the lost loved one with someone new. This movie wants us to look at the deep emotional dislocation that death can bring, most especially when that death is the suicide of someone close to us.When the young widower in the film takes to inhaling gasoline fumes, he not only dulls the pain of his grief, but the slack, dazed expression on his face becomes the mask of grief itself. It suggests something of the overwhelming power of grief, to render us numbly out of touch with the rest of the world and beyond the entreaties of others who can't or won't understand. And like an addiction, grief can lead to behavior that looks irrational, impulsive and obsessive.You have to give this movie credit for tackling this subject without cliches or sentimentality. Hoffman's performance captures the total haplessness of a man in the grip of deep grief -- even to the extent of letting us see his behavior as near farcical. His sudden interest in motor-driven model planes brings him into the world of flying enthusiasts, who are as single-mindedly obsessed with their planes as he is by his grief. The wonky friend who takes him to a weekend meet is a comic version of himself -- unaware of his own self-absorbed quirkiness.The dead wife's mother (Kathy Bates, who can do no wrong) somehow deals with her daughter's death without going to pieces. She represents the audience's sensible acceptance of death and does what we expect, bravely soldiering on, even possessing the energy and will power to continually try pulling her son-in-law &quot;back to his senses.&quot; And I think the film actually wants us to wonder how she does this -- how she manages to escape from the valley of the shadow of death.Having continued downward in his spiral, losing a job for a software project he never begins, the main character eventually opens the suicide note left behind by his wife, signaling a step toward resolution. The note, of course, sheds little or no light on the reasons for her death and seems even indifferent to the devastating impact that it will have on her husband. The film ends as he &quot;crashes and burns,&quot; and it's difficult to read the closing image as a step back from the brink or over the edge.This is not going to be many people's idea of entertainment, although there are moments that are dramatically compelling or enjoyable for their unexpectedness. The performances are fine (Hoffman just never ceases to amaze me), and the script plays against movie conventions by being nicely unpredictable. Still, it requires patience and a stomach for difficult material. I recommend this one for those who want to take a risk on a risk-taking movie.",4,A film unafraid to take risks with a difficult subject,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,3112,"['like', 'movie', 'what', 'be', 'willingness', 'take', 'big', 'risks', 'subject', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'deal', 'grief', 'somehow', 'unAmerican', 'linger', 'long', 'feelings', 'loss', 'whole', 'grief', 'counseling', 'industry', 'sprung', 'up', 'need', 'achieve', 'quot', 'closure', 'quot', 'when', 'someone', 'love', 'dies', 'are', 'impatient', 'person', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'inability', 'get', 'living', 'even', 'replacing', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'someone', 'new', 'movie', 'look', 'deep', 'emotional', 'dislocation', 'death', 'can', 'bring', 'most', 'especially', 'when', 'death', 'suicide', 'someone', 'close', 'us.When', 'young', 'widower', 'film', 'inhaling', 'gasoline', 'fumes', 'not', 'only', 'pain', 'grief', 'slack', 'dazed', 'expression', 'face', 'mask', 'grief', 'something', 'overwhelming', 'power', 'grief', 'render', 'numbly', 'touch', 'rest', 'world', 'entreaties', 'others', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'addiction', 'grief', 'can', 'lead', 'behavior', 'irrational', 'impulsive', 'obsessive.You', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'tackling', 'subject', 'cliches', 'sentimentality', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'total', 'haplessness', 'man', 'grip', 'deep', 'grief', 'even', 'extent', 'letting', 'see', 'behavior', 'near', 'farcical', 'sudden', 'interest', 'motor-driven', 'model', 'planes', 'world', 'flying', 'enthusiasts', 'who', 'are', 'single-mindedly', 'obsessed', 'planes', 'grief', 'wonky', 'friend', 'who', 'weekend', 'meet', 'comic', 'version', 'unaware', 'own', 'self-absorbed', 'quirkiness.The', 'dead', 'wife', 'mother', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'somehow', 'deals', 'daughter', 'death', 'going', 'pieces', 'audience', 'sensible', 'acceptance', 'death', 'what', 'expect', 'bravely', 'soldiering', 'even', 'possessing', 'energy', 'will', 'power', 'continually', 'try', 'pulling', 'son-in-law', 'quot', 'back', 'senses.', 'quot', 'think', 'film', 'actually', 'wonder', 'how', 'how', 'escape', 'valley', 'shadow', 'death.Having', 'continued', 'downward', 'spiral', 'losing', 'job', 'software', 'project', 'never', 'main', 'character', 'eventually', 'suicide', 'note', 'left', 'behind', 'wife', 'signaling', 'step', 'resolution', 'note', 'course', 'little', 'light', 'reasons', 'death', 'even', 'indifferent', 'devastating', 'impact', 'will', 'have', 'husband', 'film', 'quot', 'crashes', 'burns', 'quot', 'difficult', 'read', 'closing', 'image', 'step', 'back', 'brink', 'edge.This', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'many', 'people', 'idea', 'entertainment', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'dramatically', 'compelling', 'enjoyable', 'unexpectedness', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Hoffman', 'just', 'never', 'amaze', 'script', 'movie', 'conventions', 'being', 'nicely', 'unpredictable', 'Still', 'patience', 'stomach', 'difficult', 'material', 'recommend', 'one', 'who', 'want', 'take', 'risk', 'risk-taking', 'movie']",Love Liza

If the viewer didn't know the film was likely to be bleak, not only were they going in blind, they should stick to Rob Schneider movies.Love Liza had the potential to be a great, depressing, heart wrenching film along the emotional lines of Ordinary People or About Schmidt.  The backbone of Hoffman's wife's suicide is a solid foundation for a film of true impact.  Even the strange, adult addiction of huffing gasoline isn't a bad idea but, regardless, this whole film was spotty at best.  I wanted the full frontal depression it should have delivered and all I got was, ""huh?""The three main components of the story; the husband's grief, huffing gasoline and model airplanes are thrown in a blender and what comes out is a movie without cohesion.  We get few glimpses at all what is going through Hoffman's head as he tries to come to grips with his wife's suicide.  Yes, he's into airplanes, apparently to hide his use of gasoline and not to be seen as a liar but where is this going?  Why does he care about this guy anyway?  They're not friends.  Is he spiraling into heavy addiction or is this huffing a way to kill momentary pain, and about half the film?There are a few good scenes that hammer home his agony (his odd, over-laughing at an office joke, sleeping on the floor) but they are few and far between.  Between a strong opening and solid ending, the viewer is subjected to what feels like a drifting waste of time.  He does this and that, sees one person and then another, goes here and there, buys gasoline at the same damn places every time as if there is no other stores in town, etc...  The whole thing would have made more sense had he fallen to his knees and screamed at the sky for those 50 minutes.  Or stood on a bridge somewhere, one leg over the side and thought about it.  I found the few scenes of him walking down the street alone more compelling than most in the film.Unlike bad movies that never had a chance but had a budget, this had a chance.  It had all the pieces of a great, grim puzzle of pain but no one spent time putting the pieces in the right place.",3,A Downer for all the Wrong Reasons,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,2208,"['are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'deriding', 'film', 'being', 'depressing', 'downer', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'worthy', 'criticism', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'was', 'likely', 'be', 'bleak', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'going', 'blind', 'should', 'stick', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'movies.Love', 'Liza', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'depressing', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'film', 'emotional', 'lines', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Schmidt', 'backbone', 'Hoffman', 'wife', 'suicide', 'solid', 'foundation', 'film', 'true', 'impact', 'Even', 'strange', 'adult', 'addiction', 'huffing', 'gasoline', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'regardless', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'spotty', 'best', 'wanted', 'full', 'frontal', 'depression', 'should', 'have', 'delivered', 'got', 'was', 'huh', 'three', 'main', 'components', 'story', 'husband', 'grief', 'huffing', 'gasoline', 'model', 'airplanes', 'are', 'thrown', 'blender', 'what', 'out', 'movie', 'cohesion', 'get', 'few', 'glimpses', 'what', 'going', 'Hoffman', 'head', 'come', 'grips', 'wife', 'suicide', 'Yes', 'airplanes', 'apparently', 'hide', 'use', 'gasoline', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'liar', 'where', 'going', 'Why', 'care', 'guy', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'not', 'friends', 'spiraling', 'heavy', 'addiction', 'huffing', 'way', 'kill', 'momentary', 'pain', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'hammer', 'home', 'agony', 'odd', 'over-laughing', 'office', 'joke', 'sleeping', 'floor', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Between', 'strong', 'opening', 'solid', 'ending', 'viewer', 'subjected', 'what', 'feels', 'drifting', 'waste', 'time', 'one', 'person', 'then', 'here', 'there', 'gasoline', 'same', 'damn', 'places', 'time', 'other', 'stores', 'town', 'etc', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'had', 'fallen', 'knees', 'screamed', 'sky', '50', 'minutes', 'stood', 'bridge', 'somewhere', 'one', 'leg', 'side', 'thought', 'found', 'few', 'scenes', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'alone', 'more', 'compelling', 'most', 'film.Unlike', 'bad', 'movies', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'had', 'budget', 'had', 'chance', 'had', 'pieces', 'great', 'grim', 'puzzle', 'pain', 'one', 'spent', 'time', 'putting', 'pieces', 'right', 'place']",Love Liza
