Crawford ""danielc_1978""","[2, 3]","After watching this movie, I'd have to say I don't know if I could do what this man did - sacrifice his son to save strangers who really don't care. In most cases they don't care about anyone else but themselves. I think I'd have to save my son, quit my job and move. If I did sacrifice my son, I'd be dead emotionally. This is a powerful movie that makes you think. You can look at it in a religious way or not. This is a perfect example of what God did for us when he sacrificed his son for us.",5,God and this man is stronger than me.,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,496,"['watching', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'do', 'what', 'man', 'did', 'sacrifice', 'son', 'save', 'strangers', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'most', 'cases', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'else', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'save', 'son', 'quit', 'job', 'move', 'did', 'sacrifice', 'son', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'movie', 'think', 'can', 'look', 'religious', 'way', 'not', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'God', 'did', 'when', 'sacrificed', 'son']",Most (The Bridge)

Which reminds me of another ""Father's love"" that He also was willing to give His Son's life as well and for the entire lost world; that, as many as would receive His Son's sacrifice, in their stead, that He would receive their penalty for their sins, then they would be acquitted from their sins, ""IF"" they would accept His Son's sacrifice, for each of them, that they then would be forgiven, but at the price of His Son's life.

The one many saw on youtube or at church comes with a salvation message &/or scripture subtitled on the film.

Unfortunately it said the name was &#34;The Bridge&#34; so I couldnt find.

The &#34;making of most&#34; was extremely impressive as it discusses the hard times they had making the movie as well as the times they feel God helped them along the way.God certainly was with this crew when this was made.  It will make you look into your heart and shows you that your choices matter and you may not understand at the time, but you do someday find out.
