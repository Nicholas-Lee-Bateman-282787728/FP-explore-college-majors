1529790,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,B007CBWWF6,Dad of Divas,"[0, 0]",What an enchanting story about a young Gruffalo and her father. Her father tells her of the Big Bad Mouse who lives in the forest and she wants to find out more. Her adventure leads her into the forest where she meets many creatures and of course the Mouse. She learns to be brave but also learns her father will protect her always.The DVD which tells the story is wonderful . It really makes the story come alive. You can see the facial expressions and the story is enhanced with more details as the young Gruffalo searches for the Big Bad Mouse.It is a nice family story that I know you and your children will enjoy watching.,5,A Great DVD!,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,627,"['What', 'enchanting', 'story', 'young', 'Gruffalo', 'father', 'father', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Mouse', 'who', 'forest', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'adventure', 'forest', 'where', 'many', 'creatures', 'course', 'Mouse', 'be', 'brave', 'also', 'father', 'will', 'protect', 'always.The', 'DVD', 'story', 'wonderful', 'really', 'story', 'come', 'alive', 'can', 'see', 'facial', 'expressions', 'story', 'enhanced', 'more', 'details', 'young', 'Gruffalo', 'searches', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Mouse.It', 'nice', 'family', 'story', 'know', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching']",The Gruffalo's Child  [Region 2] (2011)

A snow-filled winter evening deep in the forest makes a gorgeous setting for this fantasy-filled tale of a young fantastical creature, the young gruffalo, who sets off in search of the ""big, bad mouse.""  After evading a fox, a snake, and an owl, the young gruffalo finally comes across the clever little mouse, who outsmarts her in the end.  It is such a clever story and is sure to be loved by children of all ages.  I love it about as much as my three year old son.
