I grow weary of the Stilson storyline and especially the X-Files treatment of it. I guess the writers can go there whenever their creativity takes a break. That said I really liked season 4. Johnny meets a girl psychic, a good episode, and it closes with a bonus Christmas Episode that is my ALL TIME favorite episode of Dead Zone.

982188,A33G2XG1S5NSH1,B000F3UAE8,"Bryant Burnette ""Bryant Burnette""","[21, 42]","The first two seasons of ""The Dead Zone"" were terrific; the third season was uneven, but still pretty good.  However, with the fourth season, the series seems to have descended into tedium.  The writers don't seem to have any real interest in going anywhere with the Stillson/Armageddon story arc -- though there are several episodes that deal with that storyline, they do very little to advance it.  At the same time, almost all of the stand-alone episodes are poorly conceived, poorly written, and even -- I was shocked by this -- poorly acted.  Anthony Michael Hall, who was so deeply excellent on this show's first three seasons, seems in many of these episodes to be playing Johnny as a comic figure, whereas by all rights, he ought to be turning into an almost tragic figure.Want proof?  Check out ""A Very Dead Zone Christmas,"" which is not merely a bad episode of ""The Dead Zone"" . . . it is probably one of the worst hours of television I have ever seen.  Unredeemably, unbelievably awful, and it could not be further in tone from the rest of the series.  Whoever thought this episode would be a good idea ought to have their paycheck taken away.On the other hand, there's ""Double Vision,"" co-starring the excellent Jennifer Finnigan as a psychic whom Johnny bumps into.  This is a very good episode, but it is not enough to redeem a thoroughly lousy seasons.Buy it if you're a completist, like me.

Smith,"[15, 16]","I'm not sure why only 3 episodes of this season were committed to the ongoing storyline of Greg Stillson (Sean Patrick Flannery), but that was a mistake. The remainder of the stories are pure escapism; entertaining, but no more so than any other TV show. The writers need to do a better job tying individual episodes to the real story.One of the best reoccuring themes from seasons 2 and 3 was the appearance of Frank Whaley (futureman) and of Johny's future self. They ended this story with Johny's impromptu tossing of his cane into a river. In effect, the writers threw away a formula that was working in favor of a purely mediocre series of fill-in episodes.The Dead Zone is nearing it's last gasp and there doesn't appear to be any sign of recovery. The introduction of some evil cabal behind Stillson and Rev Purdie only fuels the derailment.

Some of the acting and character writing was a bit weak, but the sci-fi ideas surrounding Johnny's psychic powers were interesting and well-executed.  The first episode of this season has to be watched, and was probably mostly written and maybe even filmed along with the prior season.***Spoiler AlertAfter that, the Dead Zone goes downhill fast.  When Johnny threw away his cane, the writers threw away the interesting future-feedback device and slacked off that whole storyline.  When he and Rebecca threw each other and their relationship away, without reason or motivation, the writers threw away all respect for the audience's intelligence.After that, the show becomes a shallow anecdote of the week affair, and the writing keeps getting dumber.  An interesting new psychic love interest develops, and they throw that away too.  How can I get on board with a world where people are walking away from potential dream lovers without any explanation, presumably to go live by themselves in a hotel somewhere?  This is a world where people just trash amazing opportunities every day... just because?***End SpoilerMy impression is that some drastic change happened with the production and/or writing.

982194,AYTA6HX3WKL68,B000F3UAE8,KraftyKat,"[5, 8]","I agree with the previous reviewers that the fourth season of The Dead Zone is not as great as the previous three.  I'd even say that things began to fall apart at the end of the third season.  Maybe that is why the 4th season was short.  They realized it wasn't going anywhere good, so they ended it early.  I absolutely fell in love with The Dead Zone (and Anthony Michael Hall) during the first two seasons.  The stories were clever, well written and well acted.  The story line, in my opinion, began to slip when they introduced the Greg Stilson story arc.  I think there may be some confusion on the part  of the production as to how to end that story.  If you've read the book, you know that things end badly for Johnny because he tries to change the outcome of his visions of Greg Stilson.  So, as a fan of the clever series I first became enamored with, I was completely ticked to see Greg Stilson even come into play.  Maybe the writers, producers, etc. are trying to hash out a way that things don't end so badly and therefore end the series.  I'll probably still buy this set just for the sake of keeping my set complete, but I won't watch it nearly as much as the first two seasons.",3,The downhill slide begins,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,1194,"['agree', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'fourth', 'season', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'previous', 'three', ""'d"", 'even', 'say', 'things', 'began', 'fall', 'apart', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'Maybe', 'why', '4th', 'season', 'was', 'short', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'good', 'ended', 'early', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'stories', 'were', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'line', 'opinion', 'began', 'slip', 'when', 'introduced', 'Greg', 'Stilson', 'story', 'arc', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'confusion', 'part', 'production', 'how', 'end', 'story', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'know', 'things', 'end', 'badly', 'Johnny', 'change', 'outcome', 'visions', 'Greg', 'Stilson', 'So', 'fan', 'clever', 'series', 'first', 'became', 'enamored', 'was', 'completely', 'ticked', 'see', 'Greg', 'Stilson', 'even', 'come', 'play', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'producers', 'etc', 'are', 'trying', 'hash', 'out', 'way', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'so', 'badly', 'therefore', 'end', 'series', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'still', 'buy', 'set', 'just', 'sake', 'keeping', 'set', 'complete', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'seasons']",The Dead Zone: Season 4
982195,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F3UAE8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","I do not consider it to be a good sign that after having enjoyed commentary tracks on every third season episode of ""The Dead Zone,"" that there are only a pair of commentary tracks to be found on the DVDs for the fourth season.  I watched the fourth season right before the premier of the show's fifth season on the USA network, so I was easily struck by the way the show ended up where it started, with the love interest of Johnny Smith (Anthony Michael Hall) paying the price for being involved with a psychic.  At the start of season four we are talking about Rebecca Caldwell (Sarah Wynter), who wants to (finally) blow away Greg Stillson (Sean Patrick Flanery) for killing her sister Rachel, while at the end it is now Miranda Ellis (Laura Harris), the daughter of Senator Harlan Ellis (Don S. Davis), and Stillson's unwilling fiance.  By now it is clear that the Stillson question is not going to be resolved until the final episode of the series, and so that plot line is going to get strung out until the very end.  There are a few episodes that move things along slowly, such as when Johnny's brightest former student invents something that fits into Armageddon (""Vanguard""), and as Rev. Purdy (David Ogden Stiers) experiences some problems with his ministry (""Saved"").Most of the season is devoted to individual cases with the main difference that being that while Johnny Smith is not a household name there are a lot of people who know who he is and believe in his powers so that he does not have to prove it time and time again (although somebody finally does ask him why he does not use his powers to get the winning lottery number).  This creates a slightly different dynamic from the first couple of seasons of the show.  Another key factor is that there is no longer an attempt to work the entire supporting cast into each and every episode.  Consequently, one week Johnny is dealing with Walt Bannerman (Chris Bruno) and Sarah (Nicole de Boer), and the next they are not around and Johnny is teamed up with Bruce Lewis (John L. Adams) again.  Sarah shows up the least, and only if she is central to the plot, as when a friend disappears (""The Collector""), Johnny finds out her favorite rock star faked his death (""The Last Goodbye""), or she visits her father (""Coming Home"").  We even get to find out some things about Johnny's father that prove to be of interest (""Babble On""), but I find it somewhat surprising that they are not doing more about Johnny's son now that the truth is known.  The title sequence makes a big deal about the life Johnny has lost, but by the fourth season that really does not matter all that much anymore.The most interesting character from the season is Alex Sinclair (Jennifer Finnigan), another psychic, who runs into Johnny in ""Double Vision"" and comes back for the season finale ""A Very Dead Zone Christmas.""  Her powers are slightly different so when a vision pops up there is often a question as to whether it is her or him, but what makes the relationship fun is that even though they are attracted to each other they know this would never, ever work, and still manage to have some fun, especially when there is an amnesiac Santa involved.  As always, the ways they come up with new and interesting ways to represent Johnny's visions , and in ""Grains of Sand,"" where Johnny insists on taking care of the baby of an immigrant woman who dies, the visions get mixed up with daydreams.  So they keep on finding ways of making things visually interesting, even if the stories keep having to come up with obstacles to make it more difficult to Johnny to save the day.  ""The Dead Zone"" remains an interesting show (and USA has great promos involving Johnny Smith, Monk and the new guy from ""Psych""), but it not quite as good as it was early on.  But I am going to stick around until Stillson finally goes down for good.",4,"Johnny Smith's troubled love life continues in season four of ""The Dead Zone""",1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,3866,"['do', 'not', 'consider', 'be', 'good', 'sign', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'third', 'season', 'episode', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'are', 'only', 'pair', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'be', 'found', 'DVDs', 'fourth', 'season', 'watched', 'fourth', 'season', 'right', 'premier', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'USA', 'network', 'was', 'easily', 'struck', 'way', 'show', 'ended', 'up', 'where', 'started', 'love', 'interest', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'paying', 'price', 'being', 'involved', 'psychic', 'start', 'season', 'four', 'are', 'talking', 'Rebecca', 'Caldwell', 'Sarah', 'Wynter', 'who', 'finally', 'blow', 'away', 'Greg', 'Stillson', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'killing', 'sister', 'Rachel', 'end', 'now', 'Miranda', 'Ellis', 'Laura', 'Harris', 'daughter', 'Senator', 'Harlan', 'Ellis', 'Don', 'S.', 'Davis', 'Stillson', 'unwilling', 'fiance', 'now', 'clear', 'Stillson', 'question', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'resolved', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'so', 'plot', 'line', 'going', 'get', 'strung', 'very', 'end', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'move', 'things', 'slowly', 'such', 'when', 'Johnny', 'brightest', 'former', 'student', 'invents', 'something', 'Armageddon', 'Vanguard', 'Rev', 'Purdy', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'problems', 'ministry', 'Saved', '.Most', 'season', 'devoted', 'individual', 'cases', 'main', 'difference', 'being', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'not', 'household', 'name', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'who', 'believe', 'powers', 'so', 'not', 'have', 'prove', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'somebody', 'finally', 'ask', 'why', 'not', 'use', 'powers', 'get', 'winning', 'lottery', 'number', 'slightly', 'different', 'dynamic', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'show', 'key', 'factor', 'no', 'longer', 'attempt', 'work', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'episode', 'Consequently', 'one', 'week', 'Johnny', 'dealing', 'Walt', 'Bannerman', 'Chris', 'Bruno', 'Sarah', 'Nicole', 'de', 'Boer', 'next', 'are', 'not', 'Johnny', 'teamed', 'up', 'Bruce', 'Lewis', 'John', 'L.', 'Adams', 'again', 'Sarah', 'up', 'least', 'only', 'central', 'plot', 'when', 'friend', 'Collector', 'Johnny', 'out', 'favorite', 'rock', 'star', 'faked', 'death', 'Last', 'Goodbye', 'father', 'Coming', 'Home', 'even', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'Johnny', 'father', 'prove', 'be', 'interest', 'Babble', 'find', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'more', 'Johnny', 'son', 'now', 'truth', 'known', 'title', 'sequence', 'big', 'deal', 'life', 'Johnny', 'lost', 'fourth', 'season', 'really', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'season', 'Alex', 'Sinclair', 'Jennifer', 'Finnigan', 'psychic', 'who', 'Johnny', 'Double', 'Vision', 'back', 'season', 'finale', 'Very', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Christmas', 'powers', 'are', 'slightly', 'different', 'so', 'when', 'vision', 'often', 'question', 'relationship', 'fun', 'even', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'know', 'would', 'never', 'ever', 'work', 'still', 'manage', 'have', 'fun', 'especially', 'when', 'amnesiac', 'Santa', 'involved', 'always', 'ways', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'represent', 'Johnny', 'visions', 'Grains', 'Sand', 'where', 'Johnny', 'taking', 'care', 'baby', 'immigrant', 'woman', 'who', 'visions', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'daydreams', 'keep', 'finding', 'ways', 'making', 'things', 'visually', 'interesting', 'even', 'stories', 'keep', 'having', 'come', 'up', 'obstacles', 'make', 'more', 'difficult', 'Johnny', 'save', 'day', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'interesting', 'show', 'USA', 'great', 'promos', 'involving', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'Monk', 'new', 'guy', 'Psych', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'early', 'am', 'going', 'stick', 'around', 'Stillson', 'finally', 'down', 'good']",The Dead Zone: Season 4
