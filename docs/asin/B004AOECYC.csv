1393702,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B004AOECYC,Brent Butler,"[64, 64]","Andy Williams has been one of my favorite singers since I was a kid. Now decades away from seeing these specials as they aired, and since they were on when I was a kid, I certainly didn't remember many details about them. Thus I was quite interested when I saw this DVD available. I was not disappointed.The images on the DVD are not that sharp, which is not surprising since they were shot on tape for TV decades ago, and that is a low res format which is being shown on an almost 60"" wide-screen in our house. But the picture sharpness is irrelevant to this presentation. The sound is superb, and that is what you're looking for out of this DVD.The DVD starts out with a couple of complete numbers by Andy. Then for a few minutes I was worried, as they started into a biography of Andy's early career with his brothers, interspersed with song clips, and voicing over even some of those clips. Having been temporarily suckered into many such ""music shows"" on cable channels in recent years, I was concerned that this DVD was going to miss the point of what the audience wanted. To my relief, there were only a few minutes of that format. The rest of the DVD was full songs interspersed with brief reminiscences, primarily by Andy and Donny Osmond, and those brief sequences did add to the interest of the show.I was especially surprised by the performances of Andy and his brothers, something I didn't really recall from seeing these Christmas shows originally. Andy was the youngest of four brothers, and his three older brothers left the business, launching by default Andy's solo career. Andy was able to talk them into coming together for his Christmas show each year, and thereby left a wonderful legacy. It was remarkable to me how much Andy and his older brother Don looked and sounded alike. My wife and I were left with the impression that if Don had wished, he could well have had the solo career that fell to Andy. The harmony achieved by the four brothers in their spots on these shows makes for wonderful performances.The Osmond Brothers were a fixture on Andy's show for years, and are prominently featured in the selections here as well. Their scenes are amusing, charming, and of course will make you recall just why they were so popular.To my ear, the sound on the DVD is of studio album quality. Andy's voice as always exhibits his perfect pitch, broad range, and a resonance that makes it seem as if he's accompanying himself (and this in a day before that was actually done, as now artists lay down one track after another to do exactly that).There is a nice mix of traditional Christmas carols with seasonal songs, plus I seriously doubt that you'll find any show anywhere with a higher smile-time percentage ... from cast and viewer both!This one is an absolute winner.",5,Delightful walk back in time,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2792,"['Andy', 'Williams', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'singers', 'was', 'kid', 'Now', 'away', 'seeing', 'specials', 'aired', 'were', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'many', 'details', 'Thus', 'was', 'quite', 'interested', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'available', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.The', 'images', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'sharp', 'not', 'surprising', 'were', 'shot', 'tape', 'TV', 'decades', 'ago', 'low', 'res', 'format', 'being', 'shown', 'almost', '60', 'wide-screen', 'house', 'picture', 'sharpness', 'irrelevant', 'presentation', 'sound', 'superb', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'DVD.The', 'DVD', 'out', 'couple', 'complete', 'numbers', 'Andy', 'Then', 'few', 'minutes', 'was', 'worried', 'started', 'biography', 'Andy', 'early', 'career', 'brothers', 'interspersed', 'song', 'clips', 'voicing', 'over', 'even', 'clips', 'Having', 'been', 'temporarily', 'suckered', 'many', 'such', 'music', 'shows', 'cable', 'channels', 'recent', 'years', 'was', 'concerned', 'DVD', 'was', 'going', 'miss', 'point', 'what', 'audience', 'wanted', 'relief', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'format', 'rest', 'DVD', 'was', 'full', 'songs', 'interspersed', 'brief', 'reminiscences', 'primarily', 'Andy', 'Donny', 'Osmond', 'brief', 'sequences', 'did', 'add', 'interest', 'show.I', 'was', 'especially', 'surprised', 'performances', 'Andy', 'brothers', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'recall', 'seeing', 'Christmas', 'shows', 'originally', 'Andy', 'was', 'youngest', 'four', 'brothers', 'three', 'older', 'brothers', 'left', 'business', 'launching', 'default', 'Andy', 'solo', 'career', 'Andy', 'was', 'able', 'talk', 'coming', 'together', 'Christmas', 'show', 'year', 'thereby', 'left', 'wonderful', 'legacy', 'was', 'remarkable', 'how', 'much', 'Andy', 'older', 'brother', 'Don', 'looked', 'sounded', 'alike', 'My', 'wife', 'were', 'left', 'impression', 'Don', 'had', 'wished', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'solo', 'career', 'fell', 'Andy', 'harmony', 'achieved', 'four', 'brothers', 'spots', 'shows', 'wonderful', 'performances.The', 'Osmond', 'Brothers', 'were', 'fixture', 'Andy', 'show', 'years', 'are', 'prominently', 'featured', 'selections', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'are', 'amusing', 'charming', 'course', 'will', 'make', 'recall', 'just', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'popular.To', 'ear', 'sound', 'DVD', 'studio', 'album', 'quality', 'Andy', 'voice', 'always', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'broad', 'range', 'resonance', 'seem', 'accompanying', 'day', 'was', 'actually', 'done', 'now', 'lay', 'down', 'one', 'track', 'do', 'exactly', 'nice', 'mix', 'traditional', 'Christmas', 'carols', 'seasonal', 'songs', 'seriously', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'find', 'show', 'anywhere', 'higher', 'smile-time', 'percentage', 'cast', 'viewer', 'one', 'absolute', 'winner']",N/A

Gilliland ""Jatg""","[14, 14]","Some of my earliest childhood memories of Christmas include watching the annual Andy Williams Christmas specials, and I was delighted to find this program (which I think originally aired on PBS in the early 2000s) featuring performances from Andy Williams, The Williams Brothers, the Osmond Brothers, and the entire Williams family.  Remembering my anticipation for each holiday special during my early childhood, my initial viewing was a fun nostalgia trip, but on repeated viewings I also renewed my appreciation for the quality of the performances. A previous reviewer commented on the ""barbershop"" harmonies of the Williams and Osmond Brothers, but these arrangements performed by both sets of brothers were more complex and modern than the term ""barbershop"" suggests.  ""Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells"" is now a holiday standard recorded by many artists, but The Williams Brothers here sing in tribute to their former mentor, Kay Thompson, and the richness of their brotherly blend on this song (and on several others) is enough to take even the most jaded listener's breath away.  The Williams Bros./Osmond Bros. ""duet"" on ""Holiday Season"" (another Kay Thompson arrangement)/""Happy Holidays"" is equally memorable, and someone unfamiliar with the Osmonds' history might be taken aback by how vocally astute those boys were at such young ages.  Andy Williams is, of course, an impeccable performer, but what captured the audience's heart when the specials originally aired wasn't just the quality of the performances but the feelings of genuine warmth and family they effortlessly evoked.  Watching Andy Williams sing ""Mary's Little Boy Child"" to his infant son is poignant and raw, as any parent who has sung a lullaby to their child would attest, and only a rock wouldn't be touched by Andy's performance of ""White Christmas"", during which he shares a dance with his elderly mother. Another personal favorite is Andy's performance of ""O Holy Night"".The entire video is approximately one hour in length, and begins with a memorable production of ""Most Wonderful Time of the Year"".  As an introduction to the remainder of the program, Andy gives a brief history of how he began singing with his family, and later in the program, Donny Osmond offers a glimpse into the Osmonds' history with The Andy Williams Show.  All performances are interwoven with comments from Andy Williams, Donny Osmond, and Andy's son, Bobby Williams, which add insight and serve to remind the viewer that, even to Andy Williams, these shows had special meaning.The video and sound quality are surprisingly good, although I wish all of the Andy Williams Christmas shows (and the entire series, for that matter) would be remastered and released in their entirety.",4,More than a trip down memory lane....,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,2737,"['earliest', 'childhood', 'memories', 'Christmas', 'include', 'watching', 'annual', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'program', 'think', 'originally', 'aired', 'PBS', 'early', '2000s', 'featuring', 'performances', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'Williams', 'Brothers', 'Osmond', 'Brothers', 'entire', 'Williams', 'family', 'Remembering', 'anticipation', 'holiday', 'special', 'early', 'childhood', 'initial', 'viewing', 'was', 'fun', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'also', 'renewed', 'appreciation', 'quality', 'performances', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'barbershop', 'harmonies', 'Williams', 'Osmond', 'Brothers', 'arrangements', 'performed', 'sets', 'brothers', 'were', 'more', 'complex', 'modern', 'term', 'barbershop', 'Kay', 'Thompson', 'Jingle', 'Bells', 'now', 'holiday', 'standard', 'recorded', 'many', 'artists', 'Williams', 'Brothers', 'here', 'sing', 'tribute', 'former', 'mentor', 'Kay', 'Thompson', 'richness', 'brotherly', 'blend', 'song', 'several', 'others', 'enough', 'take', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'listener', 'breath', 'away', 'Williams', 'Bros./Osmond', 'Bros.', 'duet', 'Holiday', 'Season', 'Kay', 'Thompson', 'arrangement', '/', 'Happy', 'Holidays', 'equally', 'memorable', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'Osmonds', 'history', 'might', 'be', 'taken', 'aback', 'how', 'vocally', 'astute', 'boys', 'were', 'such', 'young', 'ages', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'course', 'impeccable', 'performer', 'what', 'captured', 'audience', 'heart', 'when', 'specials', 'originally', 'aired', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'quality', 'performances', 'feelings', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'family', 'effortlessly', 'evoked', 'Watching', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'sing', 'Mary', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Child', 'infant', 'son', 'poignant', 'raw', 'parent', 'who', 'sung', 'lullaby', 'child', 'would', 'attest', 'only', 'rock', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'touched', 'Andy', 'performance', 'White', 'Christmas', 'shares', 'dance', 'elderly', 'mother', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Andy', 'performance', 'O', 'Holy', 'Night', '.The', 'entire', 'video', 'approximately', 'one', 'hour', 'length', 'memorable', 'production', 'Most', 'Wonderful', 'Time', 'Year', 'introduction', 'remainder', 'program', 'Andy', 'brief', 'history', 'how', 'began', 'singing', 'family', 'later', 'program', 'Donny', 'Osmond', 'glimpse', 'Osmonds', 'history', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'Show', 'performances', 'are', 'interwoven', 'comments', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'Donny', 'Osmond', 'Andy', 'son', 'Bobby', 'Williams', 'add', 'insight', 'serve', 'remind', 'viewer', 'even', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'shows', 'had', 'special', 'meaning.The', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'wish', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'Christmas', 'shows', 'entire', 'series', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'remastered', 'released', 'entirety']",N/A
