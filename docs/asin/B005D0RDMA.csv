Ghostly appearances of Dad to a young boy who others think is crazy because he says he talks to his deceased father all the time.  It gets him in trouble at school, etc.  Finally Mom is able to contact her husbands spirit as well.  There is a nice ending to all of this as mom has her son seeing a school counselor who also lost his wife.  The two of them end up together making the boy happy.  To me it was very weird for the deceased father to be around his son all the time.
