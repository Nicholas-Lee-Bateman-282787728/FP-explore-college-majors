1395722,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B004BZ5AGY,David Bower,"[2, 2]","After reading the mixed reviews I really had no idea what would be shipped out to me when I ordered this set. You can imagine my pleased surprise when I opened the package and found there were four movies on four discs. I have no idea how I got lucky on this one but was pleased with what I got.I've played portions of all four discs and found they all have very satisfactory audio and video. The audio all seems to be surround sound and of good quality so I am very happy with that fact. For the record, I'm an audio/video hobbyist and really appreciate it when the audio and video are part of the solution and not part of the problem.All four discs are sandwiched on a single spindle so you would have to remove three discs if the movie you wanted to watch was the fourth one in the stack. I do not classify that as a major problem in view of the incredible bargain price for the set. Of the four we have only previously watched ""The Painted Veil"" but that one alone is worth the price of the set so I see the other three movies as a free bonus.For the record, I have uploaded a photograph of the four discs.",5,Four Different Movies on Four Discs,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,1110,"['reading', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'shipped', 'out', 'when', 'ordered', 'set', 'can', 'imagine', 'pleased', 'surprise', 'when', 'opened', 'package', 'found', 'were', 'four', 'movies', 'four', 'discs', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'lucky', 'one', 'was', 'pleased', 'what', 'got.I', ""'ve"", 'played', 'portions', 'four', 'discs', 'found', 'have', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'audio', 'video', 'audio', 'be', 'surround', 'sound', 'good', 'quality', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'fact', 'record', ""'m"", 'audio/video', 'hobbyist', 'really', 'appreciate', 'when', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'part', 'solution', 'not', 'part', 'problem.All', 'four', 'discs', 'are', 'sandwiched', 'single', 'spindle', 'would', 'have', 'remove', 'three', 'discs', 'movie', 'wanted', 'watch', 'was', 'fourth', 'one', 'stack', 'do', 'not', 'classify', 'major', 'problem', 'view', 'incredible', 'bargain', 'price', 'set', 'four', 'have', 'only', 'previously', 'watched', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'one', 'alone', 'price', 'set', 'so', 'see', 'other', 'three', 'movies', 'free', 'bonus.For', 'record', 'have', 'uploaded', 'photograph', 'four', 'discs']",4 Film Favorites - Epic Romances: (Affair of the Necklace / Dangerous Liaisons / Painted Veil / Silk)

What I didn't like so much were the two discs that had one movie on each side.  I know that it's a bargain-price movie package, but couldn't they at least have two movies on the same side?  It's annoying when you put in a movie only to realize that it's the wrong movie and then have to take out the DVD to flip it to the right side.  Otherwise, it's a good movie set, although, I would try to get these movies on their own.",3,"Cheap packaging scheme, terrifice movies!",1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,513,"['have', 'qualms', 'movies', 'fact', 'liked', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'best', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'much', 'were', 'two', 'discs', 'had', 'one', 'movie', 'side', 'know', 'bargain-price', 'movie', 'package', 'could', ""n't"", 'least', 'have', 'two', 'movies', 'same', 'side', 'annoying', 'when', 'put', 'movie', 'only', 'realize', 'wrong', 'movie', 'then', 'have', 'take', 'out', 'DVD', 'flip', 'right', 'side', 'Otherwise', 'good', 'movie', 'set', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'movies', 'own']",4 Film Favorites - Epic Romances: (Affair of the Necklace / Dangerous Liaisons / Painted Veil / Silk)
