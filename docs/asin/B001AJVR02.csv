1166164,A1Q62S1E5H3Q2A,B001AJVR02,Lisa R.,"[0, 0]",This was my first experience of WordWorld and I have to say I am impressed!  I really like the way everything is spelled out with letters.  Barn is built using the letters B-A-R-N  Even my brother in law who doesn't have kids commented on how cool it was.  Both of my bigger kids were entranced with the whole dvd.  At 30 minutes it is a quick watch and great for keeping tv time down to a minimum.  The kids really liked the Halloween episode too.  perfect for this time of year!,5,Halloween Fun while learning!,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,480,"['was', 'first', 'experience', 'WordWorld', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'impressed', 'really', 'way', 'everything', 'spelled', 'out', 'letters', 'Barn', 'built', 'using', 'letters', 'B-A-R-N', 'Even', 'brother', 'law', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'commented', 'how', 'cool', 'was', 'bigger', 'kids', 'were', 'entranced', 'whole', 'dvd', '30', 'minutes', 'quick', 'watch', 'great', 'keeping', 'tv', 'time', 'down', 'minimum', 'kids', 'really', 'liked', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'too', 'perfect', 'time', 'year']",N/A

The letters actually shape the words, so it helps prereaders to understand in a concrete way that letters form words. Additionally, this visual helps emerging readers to develop sight word recognition.  Kooky Spooky Halloween has two episodes. Both are fun to watch and I enjoy watching them with my kids.I received this DVD to review.
