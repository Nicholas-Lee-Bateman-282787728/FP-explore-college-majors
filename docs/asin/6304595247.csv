429141,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,6304595247,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[19, 22]","Emily Bronte's poetically bleak novel WUTHERING HEIGHTS is intensely involved, encompassing a span of almost thirty-five years, and taking in the likes of three generations.  Certainly it must take at least a good five hours to do this story notable justice on the screen.  I therefore kept any anticipation of a truly cohesive telling of this tale well in check as I approached it; most assuredly expecting shortcomings and, if I must say so myself, quite successfully sought and found whatever might be the finer qualities of such a story portrayed on film.  For though a number of movie adaptations had previously been made, it was not until this divine 1992 film that the whole poignant tale got told from the very beginning to the very end.Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are the ill-starred couple Cathy and Heathcliff.  Heathcliff is an orphan found in Liverpool and brought home as a young child by Cathy's father, Mr. Earnshaw, a Yorkshire farmer, to be raised within the family.  Cathy and Heathcliff develop a strong bond between them as they grow up.  After Mr. Earnshaw dies, and his estate is left in the hands of his heir, Cathy's older brother Hindley, Heathcliff is cast down from the place of a beloved adopted son to that of a servant and farmhand.  Then the ideal friendship that Cathy and Heathcliff had shared as children becomes further corrupted when Edgar Linton and his sister Isabella, son and daughter of a magistrate residing in a neighboring estate, enter the picture.  What follows is a battle of wills, marked by moments of feverish passion, jealousy, a marriage proposal, a disappearance, and a quest for revenge.  Fiennes and Binoche have their moments, and they lead a fairly well known cast - Janet McTeer as the maid Nelly, Simon Shepard as Edgar, Sophie Ward as Isabella, and Jeremy Northam as Hindley.Originally, in the novel, it is the Earnshaw's servant girl, Nelly, who narrates this story.  This movie, however, takes on a somewhat venturous liberty by casting Sinead O'Connor to tell the tale, in the personage of author Emily Bronte.  Wuthering Heights is a castle of sorts, a bit more grand than imagined in the novel.  Notwithstanding though, the artistic landscape imagery in this movie is exquisite.The role of Cathy is a difficult one, to be sure - and I've yet to see an actress wholly capture her tempestuous nature.  Truly Binoche is a very fine actress, as well as a rare beauty.  Her looks and mannerisms, however, are somewhat too exotically European - and her accent is markedly French.  She presents a rather mature, less impulsive Cathy, which does not at all strike one as a wild Yorkshire farm girl. In the whole of this film, there were only two scenes in which the intensity of her performance even came close to the power of the novel - that when she's telling Nelly about Edgar Linton's marriage proposal, and the scene where, in a fever after Heathcliff has run off with Isabella, she sends her soliloquy through an open window into the blustering night air.  Both these scenes take from the book some of Bronte's most beautiful language.Ralph Fiennes is also a very fine actor - and he's especially adept at playing brooding characters with a lot of pent up passion brewing under the surface.  He approaches Heathcliff in this same manner.  But Heathcliff in his younger years is something of a raging wild animal, too emotionally immature to keep his fury under wraps.  Indeed, I must say Fiennes' Heathcliff misses the mark by no small distance, especially in those scenes which take place before Cathy's death.  Like Binoche, he is simply too mature - his Heathcliff is just not believable as a farm hand who's only around the age of 20.  It is actually in the scenes that take place after Cathy's death that Fiennes' performance really kicks in:  despairing madman, obsessive necromancer - he plays it up to the fullest extreme of ruthless wickedness.  In administering revenge upon those he hates he's downright scary.I was rather disappointed that two major characters from the novel, Nelly and Hindley, were herein given so little attention.  A key scene from the book - in which Hindley, recruiting a rifle and some assistance from Isabella, tries to eliminate Heathcliff - was completely omitted in this movie.  Both Northam and McTeer put forth flawless performances for what little screen time they're given - but I believe that certain plot holes and transitional errors occurred due to the fact that these two were not fully drawn out.  The third generation - Hindley's son Hareton (Jason Riddington) is ruggedly good looking; Jonathan Firth (brother of Colin Firth) plays Heathcliff's decrepit son Linton with relish; however, the fact that Binoche took on dual roles - as both Cathy and, with a blond wig, her daughter Catherine Linton - rather made me cringe.  The scene in which Heathcliff exacts his revenge upon Catherine, who looks essentially the same as the supposed great love of his life, just didn't sit well with me at all.For a more accurate portrayal of Cathy and Heathcliff in the early years before their children are born, look to a 1971 version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS starring Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder-Marshall.  As for this version, I really must say that even with its various shortcomings, it's overall a very lovely, entertaining movie.",4,"""It's a rough journey, and a sad heart to travel

Juliette Binoche is luminous as Cathy (as well as her daughter in the latter part of the film), and though I do admit she lapses into a French accent from time to time, I don't think it minimizes her wonderful performance.The supporting cast is superb, with Janet McTeer as Ellen, Sophie Ward as Isabella, Simon Shepherd as Edgar, and Jeremy Northam as Hindley.Sinead O'Connor is effective as Emily Bronte, in the beginning and end of the film, and also narrating portions of the film, with her soft, misty voice.I find this a magical adaptation...a gloriously written and visually captivating gothic romance, a battle of wills and hearts, vengeance and a love that goes beyond the grave.

It is absolutely sodden in film-making cliches, shot in a completely unimaginative way, poorly adapted, poorly cast, poorly acted, and extremely poorly directed. The adaption makes a mockery of the fantastic language of the book by making it into a really overly dramatic cliche, with all the obvious things and extremes used. The casting is terrible - Fiennes does his best but is far too Shakespearian for Heathcliff, while Binoche, though a good actress, is a terrible choice for Cathy - with her French accent shining through, and her cute, totally un-wild nature. Also, the transition from children to adults in the film is a real jump and is totally unrealistic - they look about 35 when they are meant to be 15. I watched this with 10 other people who had all read the book and we all just laughed all the way through, because it is such a terrible film and so utterly cliched in the delivery of the lines, in the use of special effects, and so forth.

I had cried at, perhaps, let's say a total of three movies before watching this one night  on BRAVO - and never at a man's preformance. Ralph Fiennes produces a  gut-wrenching preformance as Heathcliff - hard, cruel, and yet a bit more  human than the author protrayed him in the book. Juliet Binoche adds light  to all her dark, dank scenes - and the film is mostly dark and dank - and  gives the added beauty to the cast. The casting of beautiful - startingly -  Sinead O'Conner as the author was plain genious, as the forlorn and yet  dazzling look of Bronte mirrors perfectly that of a perfectly costumed  O'Conner.This would still be my favorite movie if it had ended badly -  with Heathcliff dying, kaput, THE END. Sadly, many tradegy/dramas like this  end up ending miserably and leaving the viewer with the feeling of  &quot;What a perfectly good waste of film&quot;. No one wants to watch a  beautifully shot and acted film based on a heart-wrenching novel like that.  No matter HOW beautiful. Thankfully, you don't have to. You're left with a  sense of &quot;Wow&quot; instead of &quot;Well, now I'm off to buy more  Kleenex&quot;. First rule of a critique: never gush.

429145,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6304595247,Andrew Raker,"[1, 6]","Overview:Film is heavy on narration, with a female narrator. The narrator allows a large amount of action to be told rather than experienced. Additionally, the film is rather cheesy. Furthermore, this adaptation emphasizes the love story between Catherine and Heathcliff.I recommend the 1998 Masterpiece Theatre adaptation. Below, I have listed some points of comparison/contrast to show why I think the 1998 is better.1.Nelly's character is much better developed in 1998 adaptation. In fact, minor characters are overall better developed in 1998 adaptation.2.Heathcliff appears more sincerely distraught in 1998 adaptation. He appears more insane in 1992 adaptation.3.Class and historical, time-sensitive issues are covered better in 1998 adaptation than 1992 adaptation (ex: Catherine's desire to marry Edgar for money. Heathcliff's desire to have Catherine II marry Linton so he could obtain Thrushcross Grange).4.1998 adaptation shows the story better by visual sequences rather than just a narrator's voice. In other words, the 1998 adaptation is more interesting than the 1992 adaptation.5.1992 adaptation does keep two points that the 1998 adaptation does not. (1) It keeps the beautiful/stormy weather scene, and (2) The scene where Catherine tells Heathcliff that if he kisses her again, she will die.6.1992 adaptation is 16:9 aspect ratio. The 1998 adaptation is 4:3 ratio.

As I recall, I got a B on the book report because of Cliff Notes.Now that I've seen this movie, I will be giving the book another attempt. [Update:  Third time's the charm, as they say.]  Now I have faces to go with the names. Now I can keep the two Cathies separate. But there's one more thing: now I can put aside the adolescent question of who I am supposed to like, and who dislike. Because you can't watch this movie or read the book without deciding that the story does not depend on your liking for any of the characters. This is just as well, because they are all pretty flawed.Heathcliff is introduced to Cathy's family as the starving urchin her father found orphaned in Liverpool. He is to be adopted and treated as a brother. Cathy does her best to treat him like a brother at first, but the fact that he is not genetically her brother begins to matter as they grow older.

But, Fiennes portrays the despised, rejected, afflicted, dejected, conflicted, tormented, furious Heathclilff to a fault. The way he breaks through the door, and grabs up Catherine's corpse and weeps, leaves you crying right along with him. We see his passion, rage, deep seeded heartbreak and torment. That's true love, I say-- not being able to let go. And that's what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.Juliet Binoche polishes off Fienne's performance with her magnificent portrayal of the beautiful, lighthearted, frivolous, conflicted Catherine whose genuine love for two men leaves her in torment.

Having watched this beautiful and haunting adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time, I have to say that Ralph Fiennes has more than succeeded in bringing the aforementioned anti-hero to life.  Emily Bronte would have been proud.  Everyone who has read Wuthering Heights knows about the tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and how he becomes a dark, brooding, manipulative, diabolical man who takes his revenge on the people who he feels have wronged him and torn him away from Cathy, including her daughter and his own child and ward.  Fiennes brings out Heathcliff's many conflicting emotions flawlessly and his performance floored me.  Juliette Binoche as Cathy Linton/Catherine Earnshaw is great as well.  The supporting cast is quite splendid too -- no cardboard cutout performances here!  The backdrop of the moors is beautiful and gothic, just like Bronte described them in her book.  I am very impressed with this adaptation.  I haven't seen the 1939 film adaptation or the miniseries from Masterpiece Theater yet, but I wonder if they come close to this wonderful film.  The BBC will produce an adaptation some time next year and I think that Richard Armitage (North and South) would make a wonderful Heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances to his acting.

Unlike the other more popular older classic with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier in the roles of Cathy and Heathcliff, this adaptation does not end with Cathy's death by the open window in Heathcliff's arms.  The Juliette Binoche-Ralph Fiennes collaboration faithfully follows the course of the novel through the two generations of Heathcliffs, Earnshaws and Lintons and for this reason is extrememly helpful to anyone needing supplementation while reading the novel.Especially stirring is Ralph Fiennes as Heathcliff, although I would have liked to have seen his character without the slick-backed pitch-black hair.  As Wuthering Heights is a story of a sheltered community of few individuals where emotions run as wild as the ravaging weather and revenge and obsession are the confused results of a union mistakenly kept apart, I thought Fiennes' portrayal of the tortured antihero true to Bronte's vision.Fiennes as Heathcliff concentrates on and never forgets his storeroom of inner pain.  His inner scars sear through in his every word and deed especially in the hour following his Cathy's death. His anger smolders from within and one can quite believe that he is haunted by both inner and outer demons.  Any tangible softness is noticeable only when thinking or speaking of his lost love and this one-track intensity more than adequately demonstrates the character's obsession with destruction and revenge.  For all these reasons, Fiennes captures the literary Heathcliff magnificently.On the otherhand, his performance is hindered by Juliette Binoche's less than satisfactory portrayal of Cathy Earnshaw and her daughter Catherine Linton. Binoche is certainly no Cathy, at least not the Cathy envisioned while reading Emily Bronte's novel.  She is too reserved; there is a mischievious quality beneath the surface, but just barely beneath it, she doesn't blaze with the fire of soul like Bronte's heroine must in order to be Heathcliff's female equivalent.  Her dual role as Catherine Linton is off-putting as the quieter daughter is in essence played no differently by Binoche except for a change of haircolor.All in all the movie is entertaining.  I would have liked to see more romantic interludes between the younger Heathcliff and Cathy to further support their tempestuous connection instead of the silly, unnecessary and wasteful opening scene of Bronte walking her beloved moors in order to introduce the story.Best of all is the haunting score written by Ryuichi Sakamoto; he really captures Bronte's yearning and thirst for something that could never fully be.",4,Good Companion to Novel; Fiennes Blazes as Heathcliff,1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,2669,"['discovered', 'film', 'helping', 'son', 'understand', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'passionate', 'novel', 'other', 'more', 'popular', 'older', 'classic', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'roles', 'Cathy', 'Heathcliff', 'adaptation', 'not', 'end', 'Cathy', 'death', 'open', 'window', 'Heathcliff', 'arms', 'Juliette', 'Binoche-Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'collaboration', 'faithfully', 'course', 'novel', 'two', 'generations', 'Heathcliffs', 'Earnshaws', 'Lintons', 'reason', 'extrememly', 'helpful', 'anyone', 'needing', 'supplementation', 'reading', 'novel.Especially', 'stirring', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Heathcliff', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'character', 'slick-backed', 'pitch-black', 'hair', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'story', 'sheltered', 'community', 'few', 'individuals', 'where', 'emotions', 'run', 'as', 'wild', 'ravaging', 'weather', 'revenge', 'obsession', 'are', 'confused', 'results', 'union', 'mistakenly', 'kept', 'apart', 'thought', 'Fiennes', 'portrayal', 'tortured', 'antihero', 'true', 'Bronte', 'vision.Fiennes', 'Heathcliff', 'never', 'storeroom', 'inner', 'pain', 'inner', 'scars', 'sear', 'word', 'deed', 'especially', 'hour', 'following', 'Cathy', 'death', 'anger', 'smolders', 'one', 'can', 'quite', 'believe', 'haunted', 'inner', 'outer', 'demons', 'tangible', 'softness', 'noticeable', 'only', 'when', 'thinking', 'speaking', 'lost', 'love', 'one-track', 'intensity', 'more', 'adequately', 'character', 'obsession', 'destruction', 'revenge', 'reasons', 'Fiennes', 'literary', 'Heathcliff', 'magnificently.On', 'otherhand', 'performance', 'hindered', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'portrayal', 'Cathy', 'Earnshaw', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'Linton', 'Binoche', 'certainly', 'Cathy', 'least', 'not', 'Cathy', 'envisioned', 'reading', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'too', 'reserved', 'mischievious', 'quality', 'surface', 'just', 'barely', ""n't"", 'blaze', 'fire', 'soul', 'Bronte', 'heroine', 'must', 'order', 'be', 'Heathcliff', 'female', 'equivalent', 'dual', 'role', 'Catherine', 'Linton', 'off-putting', 'quieter', 'daughter', 'essence', 'played', 'differently', 'Binoche', 'change', 'haircolor.All', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'romantic', 'interludes', 'younger', 'Heathcliff', 'Cathy', 'further', 'support', 'tempestuous', 'connection', 'instead', 'silly', 'unnecessary', 'wasteful', 'opening', 'scene', 'Bronte', 'walking', 'beloved', 'moors', 'order', 'introduce', 'story.Best', 'haunting', 'score', 'written', 'Ryuichi', 'Sakamoto', 'really', 'Bronte', 'yearning', 'thirst', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'fully', 'be']",Wuthering Heights VHS

429156,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6304595247,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[1, 6]","Wuthering Heights was one of my favorite books -- when I was a mopey teenager. I loved Heathcliff, beaten like a dog, emotionally crippled, and dirt poor yet overcoming his enemies in the end. I was like the protagonist  in Jane Austen's &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; a young women with a fertile  (overactive) imagination caught up in romantic and gothic tales.  What the  writer didn't put in the book I made up in my head. My movie idols were  James Mason and Lawrence Olivier -- broody and dark.The film appears  to incorporate every chapter in Ms. Bronte's book, but her book is overly  long and overwrought. In the 19th century, the book appealed to middle  class women who could read, had servents to do much of their work, knew  little of the world outside their own homes, and wanted a cheap gothic  thrill, no matter how badly written, to lift their everyday constrained and  boring lives. Many of these stories were serialized in women's magazines so  there was a lot of redundancy for those who missed previous installments.The older &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; film with Olivier although an  extraction from the book is an integrated whole that sustains your  attention and omits no salient point. The newer film includes  most of the  text and is therefore unweildy. The world of the old film is true to the  gothic ideal (teasingly mysterious yet portentous of evil things to come).  The new film is &quot;in your face&quot; realism.  Brooding, melancholy  Heathcliff becomes an unlikeable abuser of women. &quot;It was a dark and  stormy night...&quot; becomes &quot;I knew I should have never taken that  ride on the moor and gotten lost because now I have to spend the night with  my clearly insane landlord...&quot;  When the newer film attmpts a gothic  touch it becomes silly. The story is much better when Heathcliff, in  payment for his sins, throws himself screaming, mad and in agony, on  Kathy's grave, than when he is found lying on his back on a day bed  following what can only be described as a commercial for rose-scented  fabric softener.I've seen most of Ralph Fiennes films, and his acting  has definitely improved. He was over the top in this film. Ms Binoche was  very good in some scenes, but she should not have been cast as both Kathy  and her daughter. It proved distracting. It's worth the price of the film  to see Janet MeTeer and compare her performance to the protagonist in the  new film &quot;Tumbleweeds.&quot;Although some would place Ms Bronte in  the same category as Jane Austen because they are both women, she did not  write nearly as well. Jane Austen is the best &quot;English&quot; writer  who has ever lived--bar none. Ms. Bronte's writing is closer to that of  Charles Dickens or her Gothic peer Edgar Allen Poe.",3,Bravo gave it two stars...,960249600,"06 6, 2000",2000,2772,"['Wuthering', 'Heights', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'when', 'was', 'mopey', 'teenager', 'loved', 'Heathcliff', 'beaten', 'dog', 'emotionally', 'crippled', 'dirt', 'poor', 'yet', 'overcoming', 'enemies', 'end', 'was', 'protagonist', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'quot', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'quot', 'young', 'women', 'fertile', 'overactive', 'imagination', 'caught', 'up', 'romantic', 'gothic', 'tales', 'What', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'book', 'made', 'up', 'head', 'movie', 'idols', 'were', 'James', 'Mason', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'broody', 'dark.The', 'film', 'incorporate', 'chapter', 'Ms.', 'Bronte', 'book', 'book', 'overly', 'long', 'overwrought', '19th', 'century', 'book', 'appealed', 'middle', 'class', 'women', 'who', 'could', 'read', 'had', 'servents', 'do', 'much', 'work', 'knew', 'little', 'world', 'own', 'homes', 'wanted', 'cheap', 'gothic', 'thrill', 'matter', 'how', 'badly', 'written', 'lift', 'everyday', 'constrained', 'boring', 'lives', 'Many', 'stories', 'were', 'serialized', 'women', 'magazines', 'so', 'was', 'lot', 'redundancy', 'who', 'missed', 'previous', 'installments.The', 'older', 'quot', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'quot', 'film', 'Olivier', 'extraction', 'book', 'integrated', 'whole', 'attention', 'salient', 'point', 'newer', 'film', 'most', 'text', 'therefore', 'unweildy', 'world', 'old', 'film', 'true', 'gothic', 'ideal', 'teasingly', 'mysterious', 'yet', 'portentous', 'evil', 'things', 'come', 'new', 'film', 'quot', 'face', 'quot', 'realism', 'Brooding', 'melancholy', 'Heathcliff', 'unlikeable', 'abuser', 'women', 'quot', 'was', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'quot', 'quot', 'knew', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'taken', 'ride', 'moor', 'gotten', 'lost', 'because', 'now', 'have', 'spend', 'night', 'clearly', 'insane', 'landlord', 'quot', 'When', 'newer', 'film', 'gothic', 'touch', 'silly', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'Heathcliff', 'payment', 'sins', 'screaming', 'mad', 'agony', 'Kathy', 'grave', 'when', 'found', 'lying', 'back', 'day', 'bed', 'following', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'commercial', 'rose-scented', 'fabric', 'softener.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'films', 'acting', 'definitely', 'improved', 'was', 'top', 'film', 'Ms', 'Binoche', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Kathy', 'daughter', 'proved', 'distracting', 'price', 'film', 'see', 'Janet', 'MeTeer', 'compare', 'performance', 'protagonist', 'new', 'film', 'quot', 'Tumbleweeds.', 'quot', 'would', 'place', 'Ms', 'Bronte', 'same', 'category', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'are', 'women', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'best', 'quot', 'English', 'quot', 'writer', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'bar', 'none', 'Ms.', 'Bronte', 'writing', 'closer', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Gothic', 'peer', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe']",Wuthering Heights VHS

The reason being that I began reading the book so many times only to put it down because I hated Cathy and Heathcliff - they were so selfish, vain, and cruel. I thought I would give the story another shot and watched the 1939 Oberon/Olivier version. Olivier was overly dramatic and unbelievable in his role. I pitied him, but couldn't stand the glaring overacting of Olivier(in his first film since transferring from the stage...On top of that, the ending was utterly depressing.So, when I saw this film at the rental store I almost passed it over - but my best friend and I were searching for a good chick flick. We decided to give it a shot and I'm so glad we did. I was very angry to learn that the 1939 film stopped in the middle of the story - it passed over the whole point of the book. I have amazing respect for the novel now and am glad that I rediscovered it through this mesmerizing film. Binoche is as hypnotic to watch as Audrey Hepburn and Fiennes is the perfect tormented soul, harboring unforgiveness and revenge in his heart like a disease. It is a tale of the heart and it's power to lift and sometimes destroy.

Ralph Fiennes & Juliette Binoche, then unknown, play the doomed lovers Heathcliff and Cathy. Very well made movie. The performances are much better than in the crappy 1970 movie version of this story, which was destroyed by a riduculous screenplay (not to mention also the utterly nonsensical ending). The chemistry between Fiennes and Binoche is very apparent, and sparks fly between them. As I haven't read the novel in several years (and given that this one tells the COMPLETE story), I got lost during the 2nd half of the film, but continued watching with absolute fascination...only towards the end did I begin to grasp the rest of the story. After seeing Fiennes in this movie, Steven Spielberg wanted Fiennes for the role of the villainous Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List""... and the rest is history. To see Fiennes go from playing a tormented hero to an evil man with no shred of human kindness is extraordinary. Binoche is doubly excellent in the movie. Sophie Ward, who plays Isabella Linton, also appeared as the ill-fated Elizabeth in ""Young Sherlock Holmes."" Best to watch the 1939 film version with Merle Oberon & Laurence Olivier first.

The film lacks the heavy morbidity that pervades the Emily Bronte's novel, and this is good.Heathcliff, a gutter waif, is brought to Wuthering Heights as a child by charitable Mr. Earnshaw who tells his son and daughter that from now on they should consider him their brother. Hindley, the brother, takes an immediate strong dislike to the boy, while his sister Cathy loves him. She and Heathcliff form a star crossed deep and stirring romance, swearing eternal fidelity. Earnshaw dies and Hindley forces Heathcliff to be the house servant. Cathy meets Linton, a rich young man, who falls in love with her and proposes marriage. Cathy, thinking that Heathcliff is not in listening, tells a servant that she is thinking of marrying Linton because a marriage to Heathcliff would degrade her. Heathcliff rushes off and does not hear her say that she loves Heathcliff; he is her heart and soul; in fact she is Heathcliff.Heathcliff is gone for two years during which time, since he is gone, she marries Linton.

I had seen other versions and even wrote a review I felt so strongly about the Timothy Dalton portrayal.  However, nothing really matches this rendition and Ralph Fiennes is absolutely Heathcliff.  You feel the pain, anger, hate, and obsessive love with every scene in this film and it truly follows the book more closely than any other version I have seen. Like I said in the past, this used to be my least favorite of the classics.  Now I must confess I believe it is my favorite.  I love this tragic love story and believe the Fiennes/Binoche performances exceed all others.  You become totally immersed in Heathcliff's suffering and his need to strike out at all who have hurt and abused him and kept him pushed down so that there was never any hope of his obtaining a position that would allow him to marry Cathy.  One of the strange things about this story to me is that Heathcliff is the bad guy throughout but I notice that his actions are really reactions to others' cruelty to him.  At least this seems true up to the time he is a young man at which point his major abusive behavior kicks in.  And, Cathy is always pointing out his ill-kempt appearance, seemingly forgetting that he is forced to live in the stables and has one set of rags to wear.  This is a part of this story that has always irritated me about Cathy and her taunting behavior and lack of compassion for his predicament.  Anyway, you must do yourself a big favor and get this movie.  You will not be disappointed believe me, and you wll find yourself choosing to watch this over and over again.

I finally gave in when Ralph Fiennes made a toss at it.Most people already know the story of Heathcliff; humiliated as a child, he gets even with his tormentors when he grows up and his revenge isn't so sweet, least of all Heathcliff. I'm just going to focus on Fiennes in this review. He is so hot, it's unbelievable. This is the film that put him in my NUMBER ONE CELEBRITY CRUSH position, a title he still holds to this day. The looks he gives, I guess some people would say he's overacting but noooooo, he isn't. He's just so super hot some people can't handle what a `true player for reals' he is. You should totally buy this movie. It's only like $1.00 used but if you do buy it, I swear to God you'll be crushing on Ralph just like me.And he's a really good actor, which you can tell because if you just watch him you can feel every word he says. He was trained at RADA and it's obvious he's a skilled actor, especially when he's beating on someone or slapping some chick or throwing dishes around. Also, I read that the girl that played Cathy, Juliette Binoche, had no formal training and was discovered working at Boots. I'm sorry but it shows.

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[9, 10]","When I saw this film in the theatrical release I thought it was beautifully done, but I was not happy with it.  I had been raised on the Merle Oberon/Lawrence Olivier version that is softer and more romantic.  So I finally read the book.  This version is publicized as ""a faithful adaptation"" of the book, and it is.  WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a venomous tale of two selfish, spiteful people obsessed with each other.  It shines a smokey lantern glare on how people do horrible things in the name of love.Ralph Fiennes strides away with this film in a rip-roaring, seething gothic performance as love's prison keeper, Heathcliff.  Juliette Binoche gives a lovely performance, but is miscast in a number of ways that hold her back.  Her accent is noticeable, and takes us away from her - really wonderful - performance.  Playing a dual role, she is later saddled with blonde hair and blue contacts which are unconvincing and really distracting.  This is just a bad match of actress and role.This simply makes the performance of Janet McTeer shine all the more.  Always a striking presence, her role as omnipresent viewer (the narrator of the book), and Cathy's confidante brings her to the center of our vision time and again, and she is always startlingly perfect.  McTeer is like the landscape used for much of the outdoor scenes.  Full, wild, solid, earthy and vast.The Lynton siblings are both surprisingly good.  Pretty, wan, and slightly pasty pawns of the demonic lovers.  The score lifts all this, the fine performances, the grand story, and sets it firmly into a place of haunting melancholy.But it is the landscapes that will be remembered long after any other portion of this film.  The locations are unique and interesting, and give the romantic scenes the visual austerity and dis-ease of an Edgar Allen Poe poem.  The beautiful filming of these vistas say as much as the story itself.

429174,A2DSXA1E02C86D,6304595247,Joseph Haschka,"[7, 16]","This is the second time I've seen a screen adaptation of Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS in the past month. It's not that I'm a Bronte fan. Decidedly not. But I wanted to compare this 1992 version starring Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes with the 1970 production starring Anna Calder-Marshall and Timothy Dalton. An intellectual exercise, if you will.OK, ok. I just wanted to ogle Juliette Binoche.I've never actually read WUTHERING HEIGHTS, and never will. So, my understanding of this 19th century soap comes entirely from the two films. A landed Yorkshire gentleman, Mr. Earnshaw, brings home a young orphan boy, whom he names Heathcliff, to live at WUTHERING HEIGHTS with his family, which includes daughter Cathy and son Hindley. Heathcliff and Cathy spend their formative years roaming the wild moors, and become devoted to each other. When the elder Earnshaw dies, Hindley, who hates Heathcliff, demotes him to servant status. In the meantime, Cathy picks up the ways of a lady during a lengthy stay in the manor house of the local magistrate, Mr. Linton, where she first meets his son, Edgar. Returning to WH, Cathy is put off by Heathcliff's roughness and poor hygiene. Now, in short order, Hindley's wife dies giving birth to son Hareton; Edgar proposes to Cathy; Heathcliff disappears; Cathy marries Edgar; Heathcliff returns after years ""on the road"", now cleaned up and moneyed; Heathcliff exacts vengeance on the Earnshaws and the Lintons.The most obvious difference between the '70 and '92 versions is that the former considerably foreshortens the original Bronte plot, and ends with the death of Cathy shortly after she gives birth to her daughter, Catherine Linton. In that interpretation, Heathcliff (Dalton) pines away from loss and soon joins her. In the more recent version, Heathcliff (Fiennes) lives on many years to make life miserable for the second generation, i.e. Catherine, Hareton, and his own son, Linton, by Edgar's sister, Isabella. (Why couldn't Heathcliff have named his son ""Bob"", just to keep the numerous Lintons straight in my mind?)The '92 WH suffers considerably from only superficially touching on the early years of Heathcliff and Cathy when they came to love each other while running wild over the Dales. It's that bond, broken by Cathy's marriage to Edgar, that causes Heathcliff to snap. Because the '70 version dwells more extensively on these ""missing"" years, this viewer felt a modicum of sympathy for Dalton's Heathcliff when he gets ugly. The Fiennes Heathcliff simply comes across as a psycho, though the intensity of the actor's portrayal makes his Heathcliff truly scary.I can't get enough of Juliette Binoche, so her dual roles as both Cathy and her daughter Catherine gave her enough screen time to satisfy even me. Well, perhaps casting her first as a brunette and then a blonde was a bit contrived. But Lady Clairol manages that thousands of times every day, so who am I to quibble?I'm giving this version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS three stars not because it's lacking in itself, but in relation to the '70 version, which gets the plot's message across in a simpler manner, and to which I gave four stars. Emily Bronte's storyline is just so depressing as it is. If I'm going to watch a chick flick, give me an amusing piece based on a frivolous Jane Austen book. At least it's sunnier in the south of England.And by the way. What did they farm at WUTHERING HEIGHTS, anyway? Sheep, I suppose.

429177,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6304595247,Lawyeraau,"[6, 10]","I have never seen a period piece that I did not like. I now have. This film was surprisingly bad. In fact, on top of being disappointed, I was shocked by how bad it was. It is hard to believe that such a great, gothic story of star cross lovers, Cathy and Heathcliff, and their doomed families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, has come to this, a travesty of a film. It conveys all of the abject misery contained in the novel, but none of its saving graces.While this is a film that attempts to tell the entire story, chapter and verse, unlike its 1939 predecessor with Laurence Olivier, it still fails. The main problem is the miscasting of Juliette Binoche. While Ms. Binoche is, undoubtedly, lovely looking and a fine actress, her portrayal of an English girl, Cathy Earnshaw, falls flat. She is unable to fashion a credible English accent. Her underlying French accent is very distracting. Moreover, cast in the dual role of her daughter, Catherine Linton, with the same jarring accent is maddening. One never forgets that she is Juliette Binoche. She also, unfortunately, plays both roles in the same fashion. There is no attempt at any characterization or differentiation between the two other than a blowsy, blonde wig. Like mother, like daughter, I suppose. The roles were a definite overreach for Ms. Binoche.Ralph Fiennes, on the other hand, is well suited to the role of Heathcliff, whom he plays with the intensity demanded of the character. Yet, he, an accomplished actor and worthy of the part, falls short of the mark. While there were glimmers of humanity and a certain poignancy to some of his babarous actions, it was not consistent enough to make the character come across as anything more than a cruelly depraved, miserable slob, rather than an anguished and passionate human being. In fact, his performance fails to make the viewer think anything but &quot;good riddance&quot; at the end. This, however, is the failure of the director, Peter Kosminsky. What was he thinking?It was, however, enjoyable to see Jeremy Northam in the small  role of Hindsley Earnshaw. Now, he would make an intriguing Heathcliff. If one has seen Northam in &quot;Voices From A Locked Room&quot;, one would know what I mean. He has definitely got what it takes.If you do not love period pieces, deduct one start from my review.

429178,A3J9V8R4PYA9GW,6304595247,"lisebouvier ""lisebouvier""","[9, 11]","The best thing about this adaptation was Ralph Fiennes' Heathcliff. He was frightening, abusive, unsympathetic one moment, yet the next could evoke my grudging sympathy.Juliette Binoche was an acceptable Cathy, although the fact that she's just &quot;acceptable&quot; isn't her fault, since the director excised some of Cathy's best scenes. I don't know if he was trying to make the female characters more &quot;conventionally&quot; feminine, or just throw the movie to Fiennes, but most of the scenes where Cathy shows her fire and will, and especially her anger, are gone. In their place she is given a rather annoying giggle.We miss her fits of temper when she invites Isabella and Edgar to Wuthering Heights, important because they show her true nature underneath the ladylike veneer.We do see the crucial scene where she asks Ellen whether she should marry Edgar, and describes how she loves (or rather doesn't love) him. However, Cathy's description of her dream, where she is thrown from heaven back to Wuthering Heights, is missing.Also missing is Cathy's magnificent temper tantrum following the argument between Edgar and Heathcliff, and her dramatic hallucinations following it, one of the most powerful points of the book. Instead, Cathy's wildness is inverted into depression.I felt sorry for Juliette Binoche, deprived of the challenge of these scenes. Leaving them out all but eviscerates the character of Cathy, and thus a significant part of the story.  In fact, I sometimes caught myself wondering just why Heathcliff felt so bonded to her.Still, there were many good things. In other respects the movie is true to the book, certainly more so than the 1939 version. It uses Bronte's own words as much as possible, which is refreshing, considering how often with classics directors invent their own dialogue, ignoring language that has stood the test of time.There is a definite energy between Catherine and Heathcliff. I particularly liked their early scenes on the moors. They do come across as a pair of kindred spirits.The movie also gives a good feel for life back then, in scenes of the servants at work, or the graphic childbirth scenes. I particulary liked McTeer's Ellen, and that the relationship between Ellen and the two Cathies is less Mistress to Servant and more woman to woman.Binoche gives a gifted performance as Cathy's daughter. She is believable even in the scenes with Heathcliff, which, considering that we've been seeing them as lovers for an hour before that, is quite an accomplishment.However, I did think the movie should have given us a little time between the deathbed scenes and Binoche's reappearance as Young Cathy. We've just barely gotten over the unforgettable sight of Heathcliff holding Cathy's body in his arms before he is confronting Binoche as her uncle.This is where another scene from the book could have come in handy: Isabella's escape from Heathcliff. After we see Isabella beaten down by Heathcliff's brutality, this is a satisfying moment, but the movie leaves it out.The director adds one idea, to do with Cathy and her daughter, that I liked and won't spoil for the viewer.

Juliette Binoche is simply  miscast as Catherine; as the 2nd generation one, she simply looks too old.  Ralph Feinnes, however, was a MAJOR disappointment.  I've always seen the  brooding actor as a perfect choice for Heathcliff, and he definitely  conveys Heathcliff's agony and vengeful, dark nature.  However, though it  is admirable that he depicts Heathcliff's villainy without any romantic  cushion, his depiction is nevertheless one-dimensional.  Fienne's  Heathcliff is either tortured or brutal.  There's little humanity in here  to suggest why he would have such a love for Catherine.  Honestly, he seems  more cartoon than a real man.  Without an equally passionate performance by  Binoche to balance his, their love seem merely perverse and almost funny in  its melodrama.Ironically, the pairing of the two works wonderfully in  the English Patient, when she is emotional but pleasant and he tortured but  with humor.

Emilie Bronte just doesn't not measure up to her sister Charlotte.  At least in ""Jane Eyre"" there is actual drama, tragedy, mystery.  None of that is present in ""Wurtherin Heights"".  It's a provincial laid-back coming of age story.First of all, the whole love element is very clumsily executed.  I just can't imagine how you can develop romantic feelings for someone who's been like a brother to you for over 10 years.Second, when Victorians try to experiment with multiculturalism, they fail miserably.  Who is Healthcliff after all?  Is he a gypsy or an Indian prince?  The ambiguity of his origin is quite laughable.  There is a good reason why you should write about what you know.  Emily Bronte obviosly did not know the difference between a gypsy and an Indian.  To her it was all the same.  As long as the man is not English, he can be a Maori, for all she cares.  Mr. Fiennes, the actor, is better off playing an English patient, who is actually a Hungarian nobleman, than an Indian-gypsy prince.Third, the actors in this particular movie are too old.

429182,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6304595247,Martin Asiner,"[41, 51]","Peter's Kosminsky's version of Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS is true to the angst-ridden torment that is Heathcliff's life.  In the 1939 version, Heathcliff was played by Sir Lawrence Olivier in a subdued and sympathetic way.  In this 1992 adaption, Heathcliff is Ralph Fiennes, who plays his character as more sadistic than tormented.  Comparisons to Olivier are both unfortunate and illuminating.  Olivier was cruel toward Catherine and Hindley, but his cruelty was tightly focused.  Fiennes' cruelty is more generalized, almost as if he is lashing out at the world of which Catherine and Hindley are but symbols.  Fiennes in his animus is so over the top that he very quickly loses the sympathy of the viewer.  How one sees the development of Heathcliff goes a long way toward determining how one sees the novel or the film.  In the novel, Bronte has pages aplenty to prepare the reader for the many and extended time jumps to account for the rounding of Heathcliff, Catherine, and others.  In the 1939 film, some judicious editing allowed the excising of extraneous material after the death of Catherine, that allowed the focus of that film to remain pure and undiluted.  Unfortunately, the 1992 version is so faithful to the novel that the horrendous nature of Heathcliff's inner demons remain at the forefront at all times.  Unlike Bronte, director Kosminsky does not have the luxury to gradually permit a believable segue from one plot complication to another.  What he does show are confusing time shifts, lack of character development (especially with Hindley and Hareton), and a bottled-up sense of agida that has no place to go to but implode.  Juliet Binoche in a double role of Catherine and Cathy is irritatingly whiny and uncertain of her feelings and motivations.  The primary fault of the 1992 WUTHERING HEIGHTS is that it tries too hard to replicate totally in less than two hours what Emily Bronte more successfully accomplished in nearly three hundred pages.",3,Fidelity to the Novel is Not Necessarily a Virtue,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1981,"['Peter', 'Kosminsky', 'version', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'WUTHERING', 'HEIGHTS', 'true', 'angst-ridden', 'torment', 'Heathcliff', 'life', '1939', 'version', 'Heathcliff', 'was', 'played', 'Sir', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'subdued', 'sympathetic', 'way', '1992', 'adaption', 'Heathcliff', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'character', 'more', 'sadistic', 'tormented', 'Comparisons', 'Olivier', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'illuminating', 'Olivier', 'was', 'cruel', 'Catherine', 'Hindley', 'cruelty', 'was', 'tightly', 'focused', 'Fiennes', 'cruelty', 'more', 'generalized', 'almost', 'lashing', 'out', 'world', 'Catherine', 'Hindley', 'are', 'symbols', 'Fiennes', 'animus', 'so', 'top', 'very', 'quickly', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'How', 'one', 'development', 'Heathcliff', 'long', 'way', 'determining', 'how', 'one', 'novel', 'film', 'novel', 'Bronte', 'pages', 'aplenty', 'prepare', 'reader', 'many', 'extended', 'time', 'jumps', 'account', 'rounding', 'Heathcliff', 'Catherine', 'others', '1939', 'film', 'judicious', 'editing', 'allowed', 'excising', 'extraneous', 'material', 'death', 'Catherine', 'allowed', 'focus', 'film', 'remain', 'pure', 'undiluted', 'Unfortunately', '1992', 'version', 'so', 'faithful', 'novel', 'horrendous', 'nature', 'Heathcliff', 'inner', 'demons', 'remain', 'forefront', 'times', 'Bronte', 'director', 'Kosminsky', 'not', 'have', 'luxury', 'gradually', 'permit', 'believable', 'segue', 'one', 'plot', 'complication', 'What', 'show', 'are', 'confusing', 'time', 'shifts', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'Hindley', 'Hareton', 'bottled-up', 'sense', 'agida', 'place', 'go', 'implode', 'Juliet', 'Binoche', 'double', 'role', 'Catherine', 'Cathy', 'irritatingly', 'whiny', 'uncertain', 'feelings', 'motivations', 'primary', 'fault', '1992', 'WUTHERING', 'HEIGHTS', 'too', 'hard', 'replicate', 'totally', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'what', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'more', 'successfully', 'accomplished', 'nearly', 'three', 'hundred', 'pages']",Wuthering Heights VHS

People often criticize the movie, but, I believe, the director was extraordinarily faithful to the original story.  All criticism was directed at how sadistic Heathcliff(Ralph Fiennes) was towards everybody. It is the director's right to add or omit whatever he finds necessary to make a movie version of the book. In this case, the director's choice was to have the characters semi identical to the book's original ones.It's very simple, if you loved the novel, you would love the movie and forgive the portions that were omitted, and admire the total focus on Heathcliff's anger, and evil side. It's not the movie/director/actors' fault that the novel original characters are actually defected, imperfect human beings.Even though Wuthering Heights is a great piece of literature, a wild emotional story that is written in a fascinating way, the characters always puzzled me. If everybody is calling Heathcliff a sadistic crazy man, what then is Catherine? I believe that Catherine is even more sadistic and cruel than any other character in the novel.Catharine was completely engaged in self worship and didn't care about any other human being.  The only thing she loved about Heathcliff was his love and devotion to her.  She enjoyed breaking his heart, breaking her husband's heart, and enjoyed torturing Edgar's sister with her sense of entitlement to Heathcliff and his love.""..Why did you betray your heart Catherine?....I forgive my murderer, but yours, I will never forgive..."" yeah, Fiennes got to me saying these words, but for the love of God, how delusional can people be? Nobody broke Heathcliff's heart but his Catherine, and no one killed Catherine.Five stars, to Wuthering Heights for its timeless depiction of human dark side, and when I say dark side, I mean every character in the movie except Catharine the daughter. To me, Catharine the daughter is the only character with some common sense and virtue.  I would give more than five stars to the movie if possible, simply because Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche captured so well, the darkest side of love and selfishness as the stars of a great novel.",5,"Fiennes and Binoche, simply outstanding",1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,2209,"['performance', 'Binoche', 'Finness', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'was', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'People', 'often', 'criticize', 'movie', 'believe', 'director', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'faithful', 'original', 'story', 'criticism', 'was', 'directed', 'how', 'sadistic', 'Heathcliff', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'was', 'towards', 'everybody', 'director', 'right', 'add', 'omit', 'necessary', 'make', 'movie', 'version', 'book', 'case', 'director', 'choice', 'was', 'have', 'characters', 'semi', 'identical', 'book', 'original', 'ones.It', 'very', 'simple', 'loved', 'novel', 'would', 'love', 'movie', 'forgive', 'portions', 'were', 'omitted', 'admire', 'total', 'focus', 'Heathcliff', 'anger', 'evil', 'side', 'not', 'movie/director/actors', 'fault', 'novel', 'original', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'defected', 'imperfect', 'human', 'beings.Even', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'great', 'piece', 'literature', 'wild', 'emotional', 'story', 'written', 'fascinating', 'way', 'characters', 'always', 'puzzled', 'everybody', 'calling', 'Heathcliff', 'sadistic', 'crazy', 'man', 'what', 'then', 'Catherine', 'believe', 'Catherine', 'even', 'more', 'sadistic', 'cruel', 'other', 'character', 'novel.Catharine', 'was', 'completely', 'engaged', 'self', 'worship', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'only', 'thing', 'loved', 'Heathcliff', 'was', 'love', 'devotion', 'enjoyed', 'breaking', 'heart', 'breaking', 'husband', 'heart', 'enjoyed', 'torturing', 'Edgar', 'sister', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'Heathcliff', 'love', '..Why', 'did', 'betray', 'heart', 'Catherine', '.I', 'forgive', 'murderer', 'yours', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'yeah', 'Fiennes', 'got', 'saying', 'words', 'love', 'God', 'how', 'delusional', 'can', 'people', 'be', 'Nobody', 'broke', 'Heathcliff', 'heart', 'Catherine', 'one', 'killed', 'Catherine.Five', 'stars', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'timeless', 'depiction', 'human', 'dark', 'side', 'when', 'say', 'dark', 'side', 'mean', 'character', 'movie', 'Catharine', 'daughter', 'Catharine', 'daughter', 'only', 'character', 'common', 'sense', 'virtue', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'five', 'stars', 'movie', 'possible', 'simply', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'captured', 'so', 'well', 'darkest', 'side', 'love', 'selfishness', 'stars', 'great', 'novel']",Wuthering Heights VHS

429193,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,6304595247,Noirdame,"[0, 1]","I love ""Wuthering Heights"" as a book and I enjoy comparing adaptations. What is it about this psychologically dark book written by a brilliant but ill-fated young mid-19th century parson's daughter that compels so many to read, watch and continually adapt it into films, or even write songs about it?  Is it just the need to try to capture the essence of this fascinating yet somewhat repellent story about revenge, twisted love, greed and hatred?  Or is a desire to top other productions, some kind of contest to come out the winner of the best interpretation of Emily Bronte's colossal (as described by her sister Charlotte) masterpiece?  After coming across the 1992 Peter Kosminsky film these questions came to mind even more so than before. Promoted on the back of the DVD cover as the only theatrical movie version to cover the novel's entirety (if only skimming the surface, as completely would be impossible), for me this interpretation of the Bronte novel fell short in many areas and had a less than authentic feel.  While the house representing the Heights is obviously fake and constructed specifically for the film, the locations, as appealing to the eyes as they were, did not seem to fit the description in the novel.  Along with the usual grumbles (the actors being too old, the timeline for when situations occured in the book), Ralph Fiennes, while undeniably a formidable presence in film, was miscast as Heathcliff - singled out by some as being too ""refined"" for the role, he comes across as being brutal but lacking the rough and uncouthness of Bronte's anti-hero - especially in the early sequences.  Juliette Binoche, as lovely and competant an actress as she is, was undone not only by her French accent, but the fact that she was saddled with playing two complex and difficult roles - that of the elder Catherine (Cathy) Earnshaw Linton, and her daughter, Catherine Linton Heathcliff Earnshaw - undermines the movie even more.  Was it done for budget reasons? The blonde wig she wears as the daughter is an irritating distraction, not to mention that the younger Catherine is not supposed to resemble her mother.Jonathan Firth as the sickly, annoying Linton Earnshaw is pretty much stuck with a thankless role as Heathcliff's effete son with the silly, and ultimately equally ill-fated Isabella (played by Sophie Ward). Edgar Linton (Simon Shepard) is even more weak and pitiable than in the book or any other film adaptation I've seen. But he still seems rather colorless (pardon the expression) and seems to be trying his mightiest to stay awake during the proceedings.Jeremy Northam as Hindley isn't seen nearly enough (add me to those who feel he should have played Heathcliff instead). Northam, Janet McTeer (as faithful servant Ellen ""Nelly"" Dean) and to a lesser extent, Jason Riddington as Hareton were the saving grace of this film for me.  I don't know if the rest of the cast tried too hard or if the director did (or perhaps a bit of both?), but for me their efforts, while admirable, can't elevate the project to what they were trying to achieve. It does seem that Fiennes himself has less than kind words for this production - an unpleasant experience, one that almost turned him off of working on films.To look at, the movie is pleasant enough. There is a feeling of a tight budget regarding costuming, hair (wigs) and interiors, but the absence of staginess that often prevailed in many of the earlier BBC televison productions is a plus, as is the music score and the interesting casting of Sinead O'Connor as Emily Bronte herself, taking over as narrator which in the novel was put to Lockwood and Nelly.I do feel that this interpretation of WH is overrated, and while it covers more of the book than the classic 1939 Olivier/Oberon picture and the 1970 Dalton/Calder-Marshall production, both of those earlier renditions (speaking for myself) were far more enjoyable and better paced.  If you want to see a better depiction of WH (especially the second generation comprised of younger Catherine, Hareton and Linton), check out the 1998 and 2009 Masterpiece Theatre presentations. (I'd recommend the BBC 1978 miniseries if I had seen it but it's unavailability on region 1 DVD makes it difficult). While both of those made-for-TV projects take liberties, for me they captured the book better in many respects.",2,"Overrated, but not necessarily ""terrible""",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,4353,"['love', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'book', 'enjoy', 'comparing', 'adaptations', 'What', 'psychologically', 'dark', 'book', 'written', 'brilliant', 'ill-fated', 'young', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'parson', 'daughter', 'compels', 'so', 'many', 'read', 'watch', 'continually', 'adapt', 'films', 'even', 'write', 'songs', 'just', 'need', 'try', 'capture', 'essence', 'fascinating', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'repellent', 'story', 'revenge', 'twisted', 'love', 'greed', 'hatred', 'desire', 'top', 'other', 'productions', 'kind', 'contest', 'come', 'out', 'winner', 'best', 'interpretation', 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'colossal', 'described', 'sister', 'Charlotte', 'masterpiece', 'coming', '1992', 'Peter', 'Kosminsky', 'film', 'questions', 'came', 'mind', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'before', 'Promoted', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'only', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'version', 'cover', 'novel', 'entirety', 'only', 'skimming', 'surface', 'completely', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'interpretation', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'fell', 'short', 'many', 'areas', 'had', 'less', 'authentic', 'feel', 'house', 'representing', 'Heights', 'obviously', 'fake', 'constructed', 'specifically', 'film', 'locations', 'appealing', 'eyes', 'were', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'description', 'novel', 'usual', 'grumbles', 'actors', 'being', 'too', 'old', 'timeline', 'when', 'situations', 'occured', 'book', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'undeniably', 'formidable', 'presence', 'film', 'was', 'miscast', 'Heathcliff', 'singled', 'out', 'being', 'too', 'refined', 'role', 'across', 'being', 'brutal', 'lacking', 'rough', 'uncouthness', 'Bronte', 'anti-hero', 'especially', 'early', 'sequences', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'lovely', 'competant', 'actress', 'was', 'undone', 'not', 'only', 'French', 'accent', 'fact', 'was', 'saddled', 'playing', 'two', 'complex', 'difficult', 'roles', 'elder', 'Catherine', 'Cathy', 'Earnshaw', 'Linton', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'Linton', 'Heathcliff', 'Earnshaw', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'Was', 'done', 'budget', 'reasons', 'blonde', 'wig', 'daughter', 'irritating', 'distraction', 'not', 'mention', 'younger', 'Catherine', 'not', 'supposed', 'resemble', 'mother.Jonathan', 'Firth', 'sickly', 'annoying', 'Linton', 'Earnshaw', 'pretty', 'much', 'stuck', 'thankless', 'role', 'Heathcliff', 'effete', 'son', 'silly', 'ultimately', 'equally', 'ill-fated', 'Isabella', 'played', 'Sophie', 'Ward', 'Edgar', 'Linton', 'Simon', 'Shepard', 'even', 'more', 'weak', 'pitiable', 'book', 'other', 'film', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'rather', 'colorless', 'expression', 'be', 'trying', 'mightiest', 'stay', 'awake', 'proceedings.Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Hindley', ""n't"", 'seen', 'nearly', 'enough', 'add', 'who', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'Heathcliff', 'instead', 'Northam', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'faithful', 'servant', 'Ellen', 'Nelly', 'Dean', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Jason', 'Riddington', 'Hareton', 'were', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'rest', 'cast', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'director', 'did', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'efforts', 'admirable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'project', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'achieve', 'seem', 'Fiennes', 'less', 'kind', 'words', 'production', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'one', 'almost', 'turned', 'working', 'films.To', 'look', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'feeling', 'tight', 'budget', 'regarding', 'costuming', 'hair', 'wigs', 'interiors', 'absence', 'staginess', 'often', 'prevailed', 'many', 'earlier', 'BBC', 'televison', 'productions', 'plus', 'music', 'score', 'interesting', 'casting', 'Sinead', ""O'Connor"", 'Emily', 'Bronte', 'taking', 'over', 'narrator', 'novel', 'was', 'put', 'Lockwood', 'Nelly.I', 'do', 'feel', 'interpretation', 'WH', 'overrated', 'more', 'book', 'classic', '1939', 'Olivier/Oberon', 'picture', '1970', 'Dalton/Calder-Marshall', 'production', 'earlier', 'renditions', 'speaking', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'better', 'paced', 'want', 'see', 'better', 'depiction', 'WH', 'especially', 'second', 'generation', 'comprised', 'younger', 'Catherine', 'Hareton', 'Linton', 'check', '1998', '2009', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'presentations', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'BBC', '1978', 'miniseries', 'had', 'seen', 'unavailability', 'region', '1', 'DVD', 'difficult', 'made-for-TV', 'projects', 'take', 'liberties', 'captured', 'book', 'better', 'many', 'respects']",Wuthering Heights VHS

429198,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6304595247,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[6, 7]","Wuthering Heights is an intense melodramatic tale which illustrates the tragic consequences of following greed instead of your heart.  The serene beauty of the misty coutryside, delicate sunlit ponds and peaceful sounds in nature contrast sharply with the inner turmoil of the characters.This is a story where no one has learned from the past and history repeats itself in an eerie fashion.  The architecture is fascinating, the scenes detailed, the acting delicious and the emotions seething.  Bitterness and undying love intermingle with immaturity and self-centeredness to create unbearable torture.  An emotional score brings brief glimmers of hope with uplifting noteswhich quickly vanish into the mist.The truth of their mutual devotion, which burns brightly in the hearts of the orphan Heathcliff and wealthy Catherine, is suppressed by their inability to consummate their passion for each other because of their very different stations in life.  This passion burns slowly into them, consuming them until it bursts from their hearts in torrid flames of anger.  Catherine and Heathcliff both choose their fates, although they blame each other.Heathcliff says it well: ""You of your own will did it."" The intensity of his green eyes reveals his cruel intentions and the display of physical abuse is a bit overplayed in some scenes.  His eyes do soften ever so slightly when they gaze upon Catherine, yet his actions leave you feeling that he does not deserve her.  Catherine does in a way repay the physical abuse with emotional abuse and acts in a very self-centered fashion at times.Juliette Binoche and RalphFiennes were perfect for the role of Catherine and Heathcliff.  While many would agree: Juliette playing both the part of Catherine and her daughter was slightly distracting.  Healthcliff also never seems to age which keeps him as sexy as ever in the viewers minds, and perhapsthis was the point.  His acting is superb!The lesson for me is to love deeply and listen to your heart when it is essential to your own happiness.  A series of poor logical choices could not make up for one well thought-out moral choice from the heart.  When Catherine says, ""He'll wait a while yet,"" we somehow hope Healthcliff will put aside his bitterness and learn to love again, while she will find it in her heart to quit making him wait.When you watch this movie, a cozy down comforter, a fire and a cup of hot tea are essential.  May I suggest candlelight to set a cold dark castle mood.  Watch this alone or maybe with a cat curled up on your lap.  You will not want to be distracted. The script is superb and memorable.

I thought perhaps since movies are more visual this might alter my opinion, but it did not.  I don't know why Cathy and Heathcliff are considered to have had such a grande tragic love.  I don't really understand the appeal of the Cathy character at all.  Why do the men in her life find her so irresistable?  She seems completely self-absorbed and brings most of her troubles on herself, and certainly doesn't exert herself to change any of the bad things that happen.  Also, this film seems to have really toned down the Cathy character.  In the book she was sort of fiery and volatile.  In this she's not much of anythng.  It drives me nuts.  Plus, Juliette Binoche who I ususally consider quite beautiful for some reason looked strange to me in this role.  Maybe her hair was too poofy, I don't know.

Such is Ralph Fiennes portrayal of Heathcliff  in this film.  I was not at all surprised that Spielberg chose him for  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; after watching this film--Fiennes' Heathcliff  is almost wholly unsympathetic (he is a wife---and child-- abuser) but  Fiennes lets us know the inner heartbreak that drives Heathcliff to such  meanness.  Previous Heathcliffs have been more stock romantic leads--the  original Moody Guys a' la' James Dean.I can't really understand the  extreme negativity of the &quot;official&quot; reviews--it appears that the  movie, as is the novel, its characters, the author, and her entire family  is a little off-center and out of the mainstream.  The Brontes were a bunch  of weird and wild kids in a weird and wild part of the world, and  &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a weird and wild book--not a proper  Victorian romance, as other reviewers have suggested.  Comparing Emily  Bronte to Jane Austen is like comparing William Faulkner to John Grisham  because they are both from Mississippi. None of Austen's characters could  survive in Bronte's Yorkshire, and the Brontes would probably be unwelcome  in Austen's stately Hampshire homes.I,too, liked this book as a  teenager, and now have the opportunity to teach it to high schoolers,and I  must say my students generally  prefer this novel and this film treatment  to most others in British Literature.  The film does have its flaws--but  not enough to make it unwatchable, and having spent a wild, rainy weekend  in the Bronte's hometown of Haworth, Yorkshire, I do believe the film aptly  captures the mood of that forbidding place.As for the choice of Sinead  O'Connor to play Emily &quot;framing&quot; the &quot;frame story&quot;--  all I can guess is that she does bear a passing resemblance to the portrait  of Charlotte Bronte that hangs over my computer (great, big, intense eyes).  Plus the Brontes were ethnically Irish.Watch this film to help your  English lit grade, to observe a truly artful nuanced acting performance, to  enjoy some beautiful scenery, or just enjoy a weepy gothic romance.

The highly talented pair of Juliette  Binoche and Ralph Fiennes play the doomed Cathy and Heathcliff, supported  by the equally fine Janet McTeer as Ellen Dean.  The performances are  exemplary--Fiennes' performance is said to have inspired Steven Spielberg  to cast him as the Nazi commandant in &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  And a  diabolical Heathcliff he is, indeed--Fiennes plays this intense role  faithful to Emily Bronte's original character.  He is tormented, sadistic,  manipulative, ruthless and brutal--and nonetheless hypnotically sexual and  alluring.  This is the genuine Heathcliff, with all apologies to the  brilliant Laurence Olivier, who portrayed Heathcliff as a much more  sympathetic character. Juliette Binoche plays both Cathy and Cathy's  daughter by the ineffectual Edgar Linton, and brings great depth and appeal  to both roles. The scenes of the bleak Yorkshire moors, and the haunting,  shadowy quality of the Wuthering Heights house, lend this film a truly  Gothic atmosphere. A jarring note is the casting of Sinead O'Connor (in a  wig) as Emily Bronte, but this is a minor flaw. I found this version every  bit as good as the original 1939 classic, to which this film has been  unfairly compared.  It is much more faithful to the brooding, doomed  quality of the book.  The scenes acted by Fiennes as the grief-stricken  Heathcliff just after Cathy's death are alone worth the price of the film.  For the many fans of these two brilliant actors, and of Bronte's novel,  this film is well worth seeing.

Each love in a passionate, wilful, and selfish way, perfectly willing to let the other suffer any measure of pain as it fits into their plans of advancement (on Cathy's part) or revenge (on Heathcliffe's part, and eventually Cathy's part as well.).Each of these parts is played well, Ralph Fiennes of course does an exceptional job of Heathcliffe, while Cathy is very annoying, but all in a true-to-the-book way.Into the story comes Edgar Linton, the docile, lamb-like rival lover of Cathy Earnshaw, who is really such an honourable sort you can't dislike him, but so timid and retiring you can't respect him either.  He is the perfect counter to Heathcliffe, who is passionate where Linton is incapable of very strong feelings at all, savage where Linton is refined, poor where Linton is brought up in luxury, and immoral where Linton is principled.  Linton is played as he should be, with an embarrassingly weak personality, which shrinks from violence even in protecting himself or his loved ones.The story for the most part consists of the various ways in which these three principle characters make each other completely miserable, especially Heathcliffe, whose goal in life after Cathy dies is to bring as much misery on Linton, who was the chosen rival, as is possible, which he does by convincing Linton and Cathy's daughter that she is in love with his son (her cousin), a carbon copy of Linton without the refinements and gentleness, a selfish, sickly sort of vermin.  In the end, the younger Cathy is forced to marry him, soon after he dies, leaving her to the care of Heathcliffe, whose chief aim is to use her as a means of fulfilling his revenge. The movie here is very good at portraying the squalid, hopeless misery in which Cathy (te younger)lives, turning her into a shrewish, bitter young woman, whose only friends in the world are Ellen Dean, the narrarator of the story, and her other cousin, who is in love with her, but is uneducated and coarse, and repulsive to her.  All ends well, however, with Heathcliffe dead, and Cathy falling in love after all with her cousin, who isn't really stupid at all, only brought up to be brutish.The movie is a for the most part true interpretation of the book, capturing the spirit as well as the facts of the story.",5,It'll depress your socks off!,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2434,"['story', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'eachother', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'love', 'eachother', 'save', 'very', 'loosest', 'sense', 'word', 'love', 'passionate', 'wilful', 'selfish', 'way', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'let', 'other', 'suffer', 'measure', 'pain', 'plans', 'advancement', 'Cathy', 'part', 'revenge', 'Heathcliffe', 'part', 'eventually', 'Cathy', 'part', 'as', 'well', '.Each', 'parts', 'played', 'well', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'course', 'exceptional', 'job', 'Heathcliffe', 'Cathy', 'very', 'annoying', 'true-to-the-book', 'story', 'Edgar', 'Linton', 'docile', 'lamb-like', 'rival', 'lover', 'Cathy', 'Earnshaw', 'who', 'really', 'such', 'honourable', 'sort', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'so', 'timid', 'retiring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'respect', 'either', 'perfect', 'counter', 'Heathcliffe', 'who', 'passionate', 'where', 'Linton', 'incapable', 'very', 'strong', 'feelings', 'savage', 'where', 'Linton', 'refined', 'poor', 'where', 'Linton', 'brought', 'up', 'luxury', 'immoral', 'where', 'Linton', 'principled', 'Linton', 'played', 'should', 'be', 'embarrassingly', 'weak', 'personality', 'violence', 'even', 'protecting', 'loved', 'ones.The', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'various', 'ways', 'three', 'principle', 'characters', 'make', 'other', 'completely', 'miserable', 'especially', 'Heathcliffe', 'goal', 'life', 'Cathy', 'bring', 'as', 'much', 'misery', 'Linton', 'who', 'was', 'chosen', 'rival', 'possible', 'convincing', 'Linton', 'Cathy', 'daughter', 'love', 'son', 'cousin', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Linton', 'refinements', 'gentleness', 'selfish', 'sickly', 'sort', 'vermin', 'end', 'younger', 'Cathy', 'forced', 'marry', 'soon', 'leaving', 'care', 'Heathcliffe', 'chief', 'aim', 'use', 'means', 'fulfilling', 'revenge', 'movie', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'portraying', 'squalid', 'hopeless', 'misery', 'Cathy', 'te', 'younger', 'turning', 'shrewish', 'bitter', 'young', 'woman', 'only', 'world', 'are', 'Ellen', 'Dean', 'narrarator', 'story', 'other', 'cousin', 'who', 'love', 'uneducated', 'coarse', 'repulsive', 'well', 'however', 'Heathcliffe', 'dead', 'Cathy', 'falling', 'love', 'cousin', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'stupid', 'only', 'brought', 'up', 'be', 'brutish.The', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'true', 'interpretation', 'book', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'facts', 'story']",Wuthering Heights VHS

429211,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6304595247,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","This 1992 adaptation of Bronte's classic novel is directed by Peter Kominsky and is most notable for his attempts to interpret the entire novel on-screen. Here, both the second generation of Earnshaws and Lintons are portrayed, and it is also interesting that the director chose to cast Juliette Binoche in a dual role, as Heathcliff's tortured love, and also her own daughter. Though this version has suffered at the hands of critics and purists alike, I consider this one of my favorite adaptations of ""Wuthering Heights"", mainly because of Ralph Fiennes' credible characterization of the tortured anti-hero. Heathcliff is such a complex character and one not easy to like, considering the cruel and callous way he treats those around him, even manipulating his own son for his twisted notions of revenge. But, despite all this, Fiennes' portrayal invites our sympathy - his deeply rooted love for Cathy and his insurmountable grief at losing her is so credibly conveyed that one can't help but sympathize with him and understand his motivations, however misguided they may be. The movie is beautifully filmed with stunning cinematography, and the score suits the somber storyline. This may not be considered a classic adaptation of Bronte's masterpiece, but it certainly was compelling for me.",4,Ambitious adaptation - Fiennes' smoulders as Heathcliff,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1296,"['1992', 'adaptation', 'Bronte', 'classic', 'novel', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Kominsky', 'most', 'notable', 'attempts', 'interpret', 'entire', 'novel', 'on-screen', 'Here', 'second', 'generation', 'Earnshaws', 'Lintons', 'are', 'portrayed', 'also', 'interesting', 'director', 'chose', 'cast', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'dual', 'role', 'Heathcliff', 'tortured', 'love', 'also', 'own', 'daughter', 'version', 'suffered', 'hands', 'critics', 'purists', 'alike', 'consider', 'one', 'favorite', 'adaptations', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'mainly', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'credible', 'characterization', 'tortured', 'anti-hero', 'Heathcliff', 'such', 'complex', 'character', 'one', 'not', 'easy', 'like', 'considering', 'cruel', 'callous', 'way', 'even', 'manipulating', 'own', 'son', 'twisted', 'notions', 'revenge', 'Fiennes', 'portrayal', 'sympathy', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'love', 'Cathy', 'insurmountable', 'grief', 'losing', 'so', 'credibly', 'conveyed', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sympathize', 'understand', 'motivations', 'however', 'misguided', 'may', 'be', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'score', 'suits', 'somber', 'storyline', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'adaptation', 'Bronte', 'masterpiece', 'certainly', 'was', 'compelling']",Wuthering Heights VHS
