I enjoy minimalist, small town, character driven movies, but in the end (and the middle) this one just didn't deliver.The plot was very thin. It tried to rely on the down home, small town atmosphere it created and the personal conflict of the characters...but it didn't work. The dramatic tension was limited to what Stormare produced in his fine performance, but these were isolated scenes that didn't carry over to the rest of the movie. It didn't play itself out in a compelling manner.The ""troubled cop with a past seeking redemption"" theme was not fully developed and was not brought to a satisfying end and it was pretty humdrum when it was all said and done.I could see the intention of the music and the chapter headings, but they were poorly executed and became an annoyance. Why so loud?I was excited about watching this movie, but find myself in closer agreement with the negative reviews than the positive.

I immediately got an album by Bruce Peninsula after seeing this movie, I was that impressed.  The movie itself is good but not great. It is a study of a small town Canadian cop whose professional side mixes with his personal love life because he suspects his ex lover's new boyfriend murdered a local girl.If you are looking for a scintillating murder mystery, this is not it.  If you are looking for a good character study of people in this Canadian backwater town, this is worth watching. You would never guess any of these people are even actors because they seem to be real life citizens of this town. Because of this, it almost has a documentary feel to it.  There are also a lot of Mennonites in this town so there is exploration of that lifestyle as well.To improve the grade on this movie, I'd say what its director needs to improve on is his or her pacing skills.

And he has more than his fair share of troubles with the case. Through brief encounters and off-hand comments of the town's citizens, we learn that Walter is the semi-shunned son of a local Mennonite community. Not to mention, he is not over a stormy relationship with a woman who is now bedding up with the natural uspect -- a complete sleazeball. Walter is desperately trying to shed his past violent ways by getting religion. The man is packed with more high explosives than a Fourth of July fireworks barge.Meanwhile, the murder of a yougn woman, dumped by the river, has the town in panic and blaming Walter for being too slow to solve the crime. Walter has no one to talk to but a local bubbleheaded waitress. He is a volcano of repressed feelings, rage and helplessness.Peter Stormare is awesome as wound-up Walter. He is simultaneously sympathetic and scary. The script is terrific, giving just enough information to piece together the story. The rugged soundtrack is sometimes overblown, but adds to the sense of isolation and depair.

After discovering a murdered girl in a field, Ottawa police officer Walter (Stormare) is put in charge of trying to find the killer.  When the pressure of the case starts to get to him will he act like the officer he is, or will his past catch up with him first?  This is another movie that has a very deliberate pace, it does drag a little in spots, but overall a very good movie.  The best way to describe this is slowly watching a man who has it all together begin to lose it.  All the while you begin to feel sorry for him, and you feel like you shouldn't.  This is the best Coen Brothers movie that they haven't directed.  This movie has the pacing and feel of one of thier movies, even though they had nothing to do with this one.  The acting is excellent and is a joy to watch Walter try to stay calm in the midst of the pressure he is facing.  This is a great choice if you are looking for a movie. I liked it a lot.  Overall, a very good movie filled with great acting.  The music used in this movie is excellent, and it really adds to the feel of the movie.
