It's usually a bet that pays off (Philomena,The Queen,Dirty Pretty Thingsare among many worthwhile viewings).  That trust pays off here in spades.  I really enjoyed this small little movie, which screenwriter Moira Buffini adapted from Posy Simmonds' excellent graphic novel.  The cast is superb, starting of course with the fabulous Gemma Arterton, whose classic beauty is in full flower here.  The only problem with her casting is that one of central plot points is that we need to swallow the idea that her pre-nose job character was unknown and ignored by the men in her hometown.  As if.Arterton's Drewe balances three lovers in this tale.  The always underrated Dominic Cooper is perfectly cast here as Drewe's bad-boy band boyfriend, Ben Sergeant.  If you've seen the movie, you know that the songs his 'band' sings are, well, surprisingly good! ""This is a Low"" from the soundtrack (it's the one that starts ""This is a call for a domestic dispute..."") is very catchy. As is the song that Cooper himself adds at the end of the movie called ""Jailbait Jody."" It plays through the latter-half of the credits. Definitely check it out. I enjoyed it a lot.One of the pivotal scenes in the movie is that one where Cooper's character's band, Swipe, ""breaks up"" on-stage. I remember thinking, wow, they really got a big crowd for such a small movie. That's because the filmmakers did a little guerrilla thing putting the band on-stage at a real festival called End of the Road ('EOTR'). Reading some forums I see that not everyone caught what was going on. These folks were no doubt stunned when Cooper emerged from behind the drums to start whaling away at his bandmate! Now that's some inspired filmmaking.Also good here is Roger Allam, as blowhard novelist, Nicholas Hardiment (another of Drewe's three lovers).  To the great irritation of other writers, Hardiment's novels - dismissed as pap by other more supposedly learned hands - is infuriatingly popular with the masses.  How Allam portrays this success is a feat of acting - you're miffed at his character in some stretches, then have yourself thinking ""okay, he's not a bad guy underneath"" during others.All in all, great viewing.  This movie was seriously under-appreciated in the US, where it garnered half-a-million dollars in box office.  It did well in the UK and France, pulling in over seven million dollars between those two countries, not at all bad for a film of this size.  Let's hope more US film-lovers discover this nice little film in on-demand viewing.",5,"I really enjoyed this under-appreciated movie - love Gemma, Dominic and Roger Allam",1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,2574,"[""'ll"", 'watch', 'anything', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'usually', 'bet', 'Philomena', 'Queen', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Thingsare', 'many', 'worthwhile', 'viewings', 'trust', 'here', 'spades', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'small', 'little', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'Moira', 'Buffini', 'adapted', 'Posy', 'Simmonds', 'excellent', 'graphic', 'novel', 'cast', 'superb', 'starting', 'course', 'fabulous', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'classic', 'beauty', 'full', 'flower', 'here', 'only', 'problem', 'casting', 'one', 'central', 'plot', 'points', 'need', 'swallow', 'idea', 'pre-nose', 'job', 'character', 'was', 'unknown', 'ignored', 'men', 'hometown', 'if.Arterton', 'Drewe', 'balances', 'three', 'lovers', 'tale', 'always', 'underrated', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'here', 'Drewe', 'bad-boy', 'band', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'Sergeant', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'songs', ""'band"", 'sings', 'are', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Low', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'call', 'domestic', 'dispute', 'very', 'catchy', 'song', 'Cooper', 'end', 'movie', 'called', 'Jailbait', 'Jody', 'latter-half', 'credits', 'Definitely', 'check', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'lot.One', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'where', 'Cooper', 'character', 'band', 'Swipe', 'breaks', 'up', 'on-stage', 'remember', 'thinking', 'wow', 'really', 'got', 'big', 'crowd', 'such', 'small', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'little', 'guerrilla', 'thing', 'putting', 'band', 'on-stage', 'real', 'festival', 'called', 'End', 'Road', ""'EOTR"", 'Reading', 'forums', 'see', 'not', 'everyone', 'caught', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'folks', 'were', 'doubt', 'stunned', 'when', 'Cooper', 'emerged', 'drums', 'start', 'whaling', 'away', 'bandmate', 'Now', 'inspired', 'filmmaking.Also', 'good', 'here', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'blowhard', 'novelist', 'Nicholas', 'Hardiment', 'Drewe', 'three', 'lovers', 'great', 'irritation', 'other', 'writers', 'Hardiment', 'novels', 'dismissed', 'pap', 'other', 'more', 'supposedly', 'learned', 'hands', 'infuriatingly', 'popular', 'masses', 'How', 'Allam', 'success', 'feat', 'acting', ""'re"", 'miffed', 'character', 'stretches', 'then', 'have', 'thinking', 'okay', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'underneath', 'others.All', 'great', 'viewing', 'movie', 'was', 'seriously', 'under-appreciated', 'US', 'where', 'garnered', 'half-a-million', 'dollars', 'box', 'office', 'did', 'well', 'UK', 'France', 'pulling', 'seven', 'million', 'dollars', 'two', 'countries', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'size', 'Let', 'hope', 'more', 'US', 'film-lovers', 'discover', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'on-demand', 'viewing']",N/A

Filled to the brim with excellent actors this strange little story has many levels of meaning, but the main story is very well served.Tamara Drewe (Gemma Arterton) was historically a face to forget in the town of Ewedon, but she leaves for the city and plastic surgery and returns with a new nose and facelift that makes her as attractive as any lass in the town. She plays on the talents of married highly successful crime novelist Nicholas (Roger Allam) to polish her writing skills - the cost is an affair that leaves Nicholas ready to divorce his perfect wife (Tamsin Grieg).  She also attracts the interest of her childhood solid friend Andy (Luke Evans) and the rather superficial and silly rock star Ben (Dominic Cooper) and eventually, with the running of interference by two loathsome little girls (Charlotte Christie and Jessica Barden), and it all turns out with many surprises!  It is a dissection of relationships a la Thomas Hardy and Frears know how to make it all work very well.It is always a pleasure to be in the company of fine British actors in a lovely English countryside setting and this is no exception.  Everyone in the cast is excellent - and it continues to be a pleasure to watch the very talented Dominic Cooper grow in the challenging roles he assumes.  There are many reasons to enjoy this film, and among them is the sheer craftsmanship of the British cinema.

A farm transformed into a guesthouse for writers and all it means to be able to write in the peace and quiet of the countryside with only the chirping of birds and the stampeding of cows around you. And yet the village is big enough to have a nice pub and a few other fundamental entertainments of that type, but it's true nothing else. Then he adds the writers themselves. In fact two are standing out. The husband of the farmer's wife is a detective thriller writer, which makes the farmer's wife a writer's wife and the farmer a writer, then who is the farmer? The second one that counts is the American university professor on a sabbatical to write a book on Thomas Hardy. The first one is unfaithful by principle and his wife is as blind as mole. The second one is unmarried and as shy as an old bat. The wife of whatever he is, farmer or writer, is blind for one and is nave for two. Then throw into that set of stiff quibbles, and we all know why the males are stiff, a young chick from the press, Fleet Street, on a mission with a brand new surgical nose and the whole little microcosm of this world explodes, especially when she brings a rock star in the picture with a dog that hates cows. You can imagine the stampeding of males at the door of the young woman, and of the little girls who want to touch the rock star, and of the cows in the fields. There will be some victims, essentially a man and a dog but I won't tell you which man and whose dog. But it is hilarious because it is a case of perfect English slightly black humor, and blacker does not exist. To be Shakespearian only a few boys dressed as girls and vice versa are missing, and maybe a play in the play, like some puppets playing their own string and rod story. And everything ends well with the police and a burial, with some tears and some solace, with some peace after the battle and battles to come after the respite.

Having watched and listened to all of the special features on this BD I cannot see how any fan of the series would be disappointed in this adaption. There was quite a bit of work put into getting the story right, and the Blu preserved the scenery and indoor sets perfectly. The picture is pristine throughout, with even the infrequent split-screens looking flawless. The outdoor night sequences were colorful and without grain. The DTS was clear, with a few nice surrounds in the cattle scenes and gunshot sequence. The special features:* Making of TD, 13:39 minutes. An interview heavy piece with lots of film clips, mostly talking about the characters.* Reconstructing TD, 10:20 minutes. A much better supplement that features Frears and Arterton comparing the original artwork panels with the resulting film.* Commentary with the two leads, full length with subtitles available. This was actually a fun and worthy commentary. They both gave great tidbits of trivia about filming and kept the whole thing enjoyable. If you sit on the fence about ever listening to these sometimes tedious supplements, give this one a chance to hear how interesting the commentary can be; Finally an actor being honest about not wanting his mom in the audience for a hot scene (42:00 minute mark).I felt the ending was a little rushed but it could only go in one direction anyway. The 2.40 ratio was perfect for this film's landscapes and outdoor beauty. English and French 5.1 with subs in same and Spanish. Region coded A.
