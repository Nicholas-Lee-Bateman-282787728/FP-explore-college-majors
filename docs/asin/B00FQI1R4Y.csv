The reason I can't stand this film is because of Mewtwo's gender change! Mewtwo was a guy in the late 1990s. The guy Mewtwo everyone grew up with. I watched this on its premiere on Cartoon network and the first moment it I heard Mewtwo talking with a girl voice.I was SHOCKED and disappointed. It was like...when I first saw Mewtwo before...she talked, all this happy music was ringing in my ears, after all these years Mewtwo is back...yay!But when I heard the female voice...my happy music just went depressing and slow, like a record player breaking. The fact Mewtwo was changed into a girl in this one, REALLY gives Pokemon a bad name.Someone at the company better do some serious explaining to the fans because this isn't right. They just tainted over 10 years of history on Mewtwo, history the fans followed and believed. Aside from the girl Mewtwo completely ruining the film, the rest of the film wasn't all that great. i was falling asleep through it even, and I'm a HUGE Pokemon fan, I got a huge collection, I watch it, play the games, big fan thats been a fan since it first came out in America.But this...this was just a huge let down. If you're a recent Pokemon fan, it won't bother you as much, but if you're a 90s fan like me, don't watch it.

MEWTWO IS NOT A FEMALE, HE IS MALE, and he doesn't even remember Ash and Ash doesn't remember. If you're going to use a legendary pokemon in a movie and it was already in one then they need to stick to the previous movie. Mewtwo was so ugly with a female voice. The male voice it originally had was perfect,I would go as far as to say it made him seem regal. Don't buy this movie whatever you do, yeah the story line was pretty good and had potential if they had followed the story.(EDITED)I will say that perhaps children who've never seen the first 2 movies that featured Mewtwo will like it or they may like it despite those movies, it is after all a kids anime. But for old school Pokefans I don't reccomend this movie. I've seen all the Pokemovies and loved them but I absolutely hated this one. All because what they did with Mewtwo ruined it for me. As the person who gave it a 2 star rating said, it was a big middle finger to the first 2 movies.",1,WTF???!!!!,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,1055,"['Ok', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'THANK', 'GOD', 'saw', 'TV', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'pissed', 'MEWTWO', 'NOT', 'A', 'FEMALE', 'HE', 'IS', 'MALE', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'Ash', 'Ash', ""n't"", 'remember', ""'re"", 'going', 'use', 'legendary', 'pokemon', 'movie', 'was', 'already', 'one', 'then', 'need', 'stick', 'previous', 'movie', 'Mewtwo', 'was', 'so', 'ugly', 'female', 'voice', 'male', 'voice', 'originally', 'had', 'was', 'perfect', 'would', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'made', 'seem', 'regal', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'do', 'yeah', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'had', 'potential', 'had', 'followed', 'story', 'EDITED', 'will', 'say', 'perhaps', 'children', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'featured', 'Mewtwo', 'will', 'like', 'may', 'like', 'movies', 'kids', 'anime', 'old', 'school', 'Pokefans', 'do', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Pokemovies', 'loved', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'one', 'what', 'did', 'Mewtwo', 'ruined', 'person', 'who', 'gave', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'said', 'was', 'big', 'middle', 'finger', 'first', '2', 'movies']",Pokemon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened

1672677,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00FQI1R4Y,E. David Swan,"[5, 5]","They say if it ain&#8217;t broken don&#8217;t fix it. Genesect and the Legend Awakened was the 10th highest grossing film in Japan in 2013 and the Pok&eacute;mon movies generally tend to do very well in their home country. Unfortunately the formula is getting really stale. What I won&#8217;t say is that it&#8217;s a bad looking film. The design and animation are often stunning but Pok&eacute;mon just doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to produce a story worthy of the visuals. The story can be summed up very simply. Five genetically created Genesect escape and decide to set up residence in the power plant of New York City (I thought Pok&eacute;mon always used fictional cities). The Genesect attack dozens of non-legendary Pok&eacute;mon in Central Park (Pok&eacute;mon Hills) until MewTwo arrives to defend the other Pok&eacute;mon and an all out Pok&eacute;mon on Pok&eacute;mon battle ensues. The damage done by the Genesect threatens to blow up the power plant so Ash and friends show up to save the day and thanks to the power of friendship everything turns out well. If anyone considers this a spoiler they haven&#8217;t seen another Pok&eacute;mon movie because this is literally the end of every movie.If someone had this playing in the background and isn&#8217;t really paying attention it probably looks like a decent movie. It certainly looks good but there really is almost no story. It&#8217;s just endless scenes of Pok&eacute;mon unleashing blasts from their mouths or kicking up sandstorms or releasing balls of energy. Team Rocket appears but as always have no impact on the story and are completely superfluous. Even Ash and friends do almost nothing except gawk at the battling and Ash, as always, tries to talk everyone into being friends. In this case it&#8217;s not even Ash who saves the day and events would likely have preceded exactly the same even if he hadn&#8217;t put in an appearance. Most of the voice actors are from the television show but there are some unfortunate additions. Mewtwo being voiced by a female doesn&#8217;t bother me but the voice actress is terrible and gives no gravitas to arguably the most powerful of all Pok&eacute;mon. One of the Genesect befriends Ash and has the most irritating baby voice, constantly whining about &#8216;going home&#8217;.I had been giving the Pok&eacute;mon movies better and better ratings but with the last three movies it seems like the writers have completely run out of ideas. The whole story could be written on a napkin. An argument could be made that the movie is made for kids but there are many kids movies that also appeal to adults and have some actual substance. Just look at the movies of Hayao Miyazaki. I&#8217;m not complaining because I dislike Pok&eacute;mon, quite the opposite. I&#8217;d like to see the series continue indefinitely but if they want to expand the audience beyond Japanese and children below the age of 10 they&#8217;re really going to need to add a story to the beautiful animation. I gave Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice three stars because the story was so shallow but this one is even worse and doesn&#8217;t have the benefit of the awesome Kyurem. I&#8217;ll give this one three stars also but only on the strength of the animation.",3,"Great Animation, No Story",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,3256,"['say', 'ain', '8217', 'broken', 'don', '8217', 'fix', 'Genesect', 'Legend', 'Awakened', 'was', '10th', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'Japan', '2013', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'movies', 'generally', 'tend', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'home', 'country', 'Unfortunately', 'formula', 'getting', 'really', 'stale', 'What', 'won', '8217', 't', 'say', '8217', 's', 'bad', 'looking', 'film', 'design', 'animation', 'are', 'often', 'stunning', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'produce', 'story', 'worthy', 'visuals', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'very', 'simply', 'Five', 'genetically', 'created', 'Genesect', 'escape', 'decide', 'set', 'up', 'residence', 'power', 'plant', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'thought', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'always', 'used', 'fictional', 'cities', 'Genesect', 'attack', 'dozens', 'non-legendary', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'Central', 'Park', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'Hills', 'MewTwo', 'defend', 'other', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'out', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'battle', 'ensues', 'damage', 'done', 'Genesect', 'blow', 'up', 'power', 'plant', 'Ash', 'friends', 'show', 'up', 'save', 'day', 'thanks', 'power', 'friendship', 'everything', 'out', 'well', 'anyone', 'spoiler', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'movie', 'literally', 'end', 'movie.If', 'someone', 'had', 'playing', 'background', 'isn', '8217', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'probably', 'decent', 'movie', 'certainly', 'good', 'really', 'almost', 'story', '8217', 's', 'just', 'endless', 'scenes', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'unleashing', 'blasts', 'mouths', 'kicking', 'up', 'sandstorms', 'releasing', 'balls', 'energy', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'always', 'have', 'impact', 'story', 'are', 'completely', 'superfluous', 'Even', 'Ash', 'friends', 'do', 'almost', 'nothing', 'gawk', 'battling', 'Ash', 'always', 'tries', 'talk', 'everyone', 'being', 'friends', 'case', '8217', 'not', 'even', 'Ash', 'who', 'day', 'events', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'preceded', 'exactly', 'same', 'even', '8217', 'put', 'appearance', 'Most', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'television', 'show', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'additions', 'Mewtwo', 'being', 'voiced', 'female', 'doesn', '8217', 'voice', 'actress', 'terrible', 'gravitas', 'arguably', 'most', 'powerful', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'One', 'Genesect', 'Ash', 'most', 'irritating', 'baby', 'voice', 'constantly', 'whining', '8216', 'going', 'home', '8217', 'had', 'been', 'giving', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'movies', 'better', 'better', 'ratings', 'last', 'three', 'movies', 'writers', 'have', 'completely', 'run', 'ideas', 'whole', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'written', 'napkin', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'made', 'kids', 'are', 'many', 'kids', 'movies', 'also', 'appeal', 'adults', 'have', 'actual', 'substance', 'Just', 'look', 'movies', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', '8217', 'not', 'complaining', 'dislike', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'quite', 'opposite', '8217', 'd', 'see', 'series', 'continue', 'indefinitely', 'want', 'expand', 'audience', 'Japanese', 'children', 'age', '10', '8217', 'really', 'going', 'need', 'add', 'story', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'gave', 'Kyurem', 'Sword', 'Justice', 'three', 'stars', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'shallow', 'one', 'even', 'worse', 'doesn', '8217', 'have', 'benefit', 'awesome', 'Kyurem', '8217', 'give', 'one', 'three', 'stars', 'also', 'only', 'strength', 'animation']",Pokemon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened

1672681,A2FF11D7REYZMX,B00FQI1R4Y,"PlanetHell ""EmbraceThatSmothers""","[1, 2]","With the simple overall theme of ""finding out where you belong,"" this is another great Pok&eacute;mon movie. We are introduced to a five-team with a red leader, the genosect, created by humans like Mewtwo was back when the franchise started branching out into film. They see no one as their friends and seek to find their home, despite the world having changed (obviously) a lot in 300 million years.The Mewtwo in this movie is certainly not the same one from the first film or the returns special. This one is obviously female, and has a second transformation form. It has similar origins, created by humans, but it is obvious as the backstory shows it being tortured and eventually breaking free, where the original, ""male"" Mewtwo simply rejected and killed it's creators before anything like ""tests"" ever happened.This one film's flaw is not acknowledging the past Mewtwo. Ash seems to realize it's a Mewtwo but it never goes further than that. Basically this new female Mewtwo understands how the genosect feel, and does whatever it can to try to help. But the red geneosect leader is destructive and can also control the others. They end up in a created eco-system in the middle of a city. Huge pluses are deserved for the look of the city-it looks like a combination of Tokyo and New York. It is no way identical to the tons of same-looking cities from prior movies (heroes and Illusions towns/cities looked the same, original and darkai also looked the same).After some pretty cool battles and differences being set aside, and the terror of the entire city exploding, things turned out well as expected. There is fire, water, genosect seeds/trees growing, and a plummeting to the earth-it's all well animated too.I'd leave it at that but the hatred for this new Mewtwo should be addressed further. Yes, she's not the same one from prior films. She was made in a similar fashion, probably with the same idea in mind, with pretty much the same results (save not trying to destroy the world like the male Mewtwo from the first Pok&eacute;mon movie). Some complain this means ""anyone can make a Mewtwo."" For one, it's been told that Porygon was a human created Pok&eacute;mon, and that was one of the original 150 from when the series has it's beginnings. Since the creation of the original Mewtwo we've seen resurrections of many pre-historic Pok&eacute;mon in many different fashions, ranging from cloning to machines/magic, and more. It is hardly ""impossible"" to make clones or to resurrect Pok&eacute;mon in the world Pok&eacute;mon has created. Considering the makers of the series themselves have stated it's supposed to have been over five years in the ""series timeline,"" it's no wonder someone else made a Mewtwo or tried it with other Pok&eacute;mon (the genosect are more advanced, they added weapons on their shoulders/backs). Of course some scientists would try it again, why not? The answer is because they are obviously not all there and just want to create life and feel they can do whatever they want with it, we know that never works out.Now what I'd like to really see; female Mewtwo meets male Mewtwo. This would be awesome, and we all know it. Move past the silliness of hating on female Mewtwo, who is truly awesome and beautiful, and enjoy this movie as one of the better ones in the long series.",5,An excellent Pokemon movie simply about finding out where you belong...,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,3321,"['simple', 'overall', 'theme', 'finding', 'out', 'where', 'belong', 'great', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'five-team', 'red', 'leader', 'genosect', 'created', 'humans', 'Mewtwo', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'franchise', 'started', 'branching', 'out', 'film', 'see', 'one', 'friends', 'seek', 'find', 'home', 'world', 'having', 'changed', 'obviously', 'lot', '300', 'million', 'years.The', 'Mewtwo', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'same', 'one', 'first', 'film', 'returns', 'special', 'one', 'obviously', 'female', 'second', 'transformation', 'form', 'similar', 'origins', 'created', 'humans', 'obvious', 'backstory', 'being', 'tortured', 'eventually', 'breaking', 'free', 'where', 'original', 'male', 'Mewtwo', 'simply', 'rejected', 'killed', 'creators', 'anything', 'tests', 'ever', 'one', 'film', 'flaw', 'not', 'acknowledging', 'past', 'Mewtwo', 'Ash', 'realize', 'Mewtwo', 'never', 'further', 'Basically', 'new', 'female', 'Mewtwo', 'how', 'genosect', 'feel', 'whatever', 'can', 'try', 'help', 'red', 'geneosect', 'leader', 'destructive', 'can', 'also', 'control', 'others', 'end', 'up', 'created', 'eco-system', 'middle', 'city', 'Huge', 'pluses', 'are', 'deserved', 'look', 'city-it', 'looks', 'combination', 'Tokyo', 'New', 'York', 'way', 'identical', 'tons', 'same-looking', 'cities', 'prior', 'movies', 'heroes', 'Illusions', 'towns/cities', 'looked', 'same', 'original', 'darkai', 'also', 'looked', 'same', '.After', 'pretty', 'cool', 'battles', 'differences', 'being', 'set', 'aside', 'terror', 'entire', 'city', 'exploding', 'things', 'turned', 'out', 'well', 'expected', 'fire', 'water', 'genosect', 'seeds/trees', 'growing', 'plummeting', 'earth-it', 'well', 'animated', 'too.I', ""'d"", 'leave', 'hatred', 'new', 'Mewtwo', 'should', 'be', 'addressed', 'further', 'Yes', 'not', 'same', 'one', 'prior', 'films', 'was', 'made', 'similar', 'fashion', 'probably', 'same', 'idea', 'mind', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'results', 'save', 'not', 'trying', 'destroy', 'world', 'male', 'Mewtwo', 'first', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'movie', 'complain', 'anyone', 'can', 'make', 'Mewtwo', 'one', 'been', 'told', 'Porygon', 'was', 'human', 'created', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'was', 'one', 'original', '150', 'when', 'series', 'beginnings', 'creation', 'original', 'Mewtwo', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'resurrections', 'many', 'pre-historic', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'many', 'different', 'fashions', 'ranging', 'cloning', 'machines/magic', 'more', 'hardly', 'impossible', 'make', 'clones', 'resurrect', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'world', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'created', 'Considering', 'makers', 'series', 'have', 'stated', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'five', 'years', 'series', 'timeline', 'wonder', 'someone', 'else', 'made', 'Mewtwo', 'tried', 'other', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'genosect', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'added', 'weapons', 'shoulders/backs', 'course', 'scientists', 'would', 'try', 'again', 'why', 'not', 'answer', 'are', 'obviously', 'not', 'there', 'just', 'want', 'create', 'life', 'feel', 'can', 'do', 'want', 'know', 'never', 'what', ""'d"", 'like', 'really', 'see', 'female', 'Mewtwo', 'meets', 'male', 'Mewtwo', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'know', 'Move', 'silliness', 'hating', 'female', 'Mewtwo', 'who', 'truly', 'awesome', 'beautiful', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'long', 'series']",Pokemon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened
