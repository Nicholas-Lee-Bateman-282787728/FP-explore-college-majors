482890,A8EDTKSPOMRWK,6305907161,hyperbolium,"[12, 12]","Applegate's stripper-by-night/motel-laundress-by-day life spiral is apparently motivated by her troubled past.  A past that includes a stern military father, a brother who killed himself on his 16th birthday, and a step-mother still living in the family's Southern mansion.  Unfortunately these elements are only hinted at in Applegate's exposition, and the viewer is left to wonder what sort of childhood they add up to.The arc-free plot involves an Italian drifter, hired as the motel's handyman, who becomes smitten with the laundress.  Unfortunately, Applegate's character has intimacy issues (or perhaps bi-polar disorder), and the couple embark on a series of push-me-pull-you encounters.  There are plenty of content-free subplots - including porn films being shot at the motel, and a lesbian affair - none of which pay off.  There's also a big helping of artistic lighting, framing and freewheeling camera work, none of which further the film.Applegate's short erotic dancing sequences are the sort that provide good copy (and a still) for the tape's packaging, but are not the sort of blockbuster performance one might expect in light of the turns made by Demi Moore and Elizabeth Berkeley.  In fact, it's Applegate's dramatic scenes that show off her actual talent - acting.  Too bad there's so little content for her to work with.",2,Hmph?  What?  The movie's over?

482891,A1VFCX7D378LXO,6305907161,Lana Durbin,"[0, 0]","The first thing that shocked me about ""Kiss of Fire"" was Christina Applegate's performance. I mean, WOW. She just MADE this movie.The storyline was actually very strong. The director handled it well. Claudine (Applegate), a beautiful free-spirited young woman, is desperately trying to escape her awful past. She is a laundry girl by day and an exotic dancer by night. When claudine meets Stephano (Dionisi), a man who changes her life, she learns about real love and decides to confront the secrets that haunt her. Everything seems wonderful...but all good things usually come to an end.""Kiss of Fire"" is powerful, captivating, and intensely riveting.A truly beautiful film.I searched and searched and searched and FINALLY found it on DVD. It only includes a chapter selection (1-29) and captions (english subtitles or none). The main menu has a gorgeous picture of Christina Applegate on it with some fireworks in the background.If you've seen ""Kiss of Fire"" and you're looking for the DVD, I found mine at the Virgin Mega Store in Westside Downtown Disney in Orlando, FL.

482892,AD10RWNINTPV0,6305907161,"Mark Murray ""Boomer-Creak""","[0, 0]","Now this is an outstanding  example of independent style film-making.  While the subject matter and characters wildly swing from eccentric, impish, passionate to spiritual, the easiest conflict to recognize is the tormented love-affair of Claudine Van Doozen (played by Christina Applegate of Married with Children fame) and Stefano Marui (Stefano Dionisi).  To add to this complex mix of emotions, Claudine has tendencies to be openly self-envolved, including AC-DC tendencies. This then relegates Stefano as simply an escort, as Claudine routinely shares herself with her other female acquaintances.  Nevertheless, Stefano is like a moth-to-the flame, spell-bound by Claudine's physical beauty, moodiness, spiritual insights, inner-conflicts, plus deep personal scars.  By conjecture, this film supposedly depicts a fringe element of southern society that may shock you.  But like Stefano, you become ever-intrigued to see how it all plays out, and who will ultimately win Claudine---if at all possible.  Truly, this film is a sleeper-classic that will likely never be aired on network TV...at least not during the kiddy-hour!",4,Kiss of Fire (aka: Claudine's Return),1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,1128,"['Now', 'outstanding', 'example', 'independent', 'style', 'film-making', 'subject', 'matter', 'characters', 'wildly', 'swing', 'eccentric', 'impish', 'passionate', 'spiritual', 'easiest', 'conflict', 'recognize', 'tormented', 'love-affair', 'Claudine', 'Van', 'Doozen', 'played', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Married', 'Children', 'fame', 'Stefano', 'Marui', 'Stefano', 'Dionisi', 'add', 'complex', 'mix', 'emotions', 'Claudine', 'tendencies', 'be', 'openly', 'self-envolved', 'including', 'AC-DC', 'tendencies', 'then', 'Stefano', 'simply', 'escort', 'Claudine', 'routinely', 'shares', 'other', 'female', 'acquaintances', 'Nevertheless', 'Stefano', 'moth-to-the', 'flame', 'spell-bound', 'Claudine', 'physical', 'beauty', 'moodiness', 'spiritual', 'insights', 'inner-conflicts', 'deep', 'personal', 'scars', 'conjecture', 'film', 'supposedly', 'fringe', 'element', 'southern', 'society', 'may', 'shock', 'Stefano', 'become', 'ever-intrigued', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'who', 'will', 'ultimately', 'win', 'Claudine', '-if', 'possible', 'Truly', 'film', 'sleeper-classic', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'aired', 'network', 'TV', 'least', 'not', 'kiddy-hour']",Kiss of Fire
482893,A3TPRIFSQVXY5H,6305907161,"William Neely ""Will""","[3, 5]","I bought this DVD because I am a HUGE fan of Christina Applegate, and it was well worth the price. The film is really beautiful, but the standout thing here is Christina's performance. She does an amazing job as Claudine, a woman trying to escape her past. Now, we come to one of the reasons I gave the film four stars: What past was Claudine trying to escape? That was never really said in the movie, and it would have been better if it was. Claudine is a laundry-girl by day and exotic dancer by night. Christina has a really good dance sequence early in the film. A young Italian man, Stefano, begins to work at the inn that Claudine works at during the day, and he goes to the club where she dances one night. Claudine and Stefano form a relationship, but problems come along, and their relationship is tested. This is a very dramatic, dark movie, and it makes me sad every time I Watch it, but sad in a good way. Christina proves here that she really is one of the best actresses of this generation (one of the best ever, in my opinion). I would reccomend this film to anyone who wants to see a beautiful drama, or anyone who likes Christina. In the end, there are a few questions that the viewer will have, though. I found that watching it a second time helped me understand, and I noticed a lot of things that I missed the first time, but that is another reason I gave it four stars, because there are still a few unanswered questions in the end.",4,Beautiful film...
