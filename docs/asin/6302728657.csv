329894,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302728657,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","The Golden Globes are ridiculous.  The fact that this was nominated under the Comedy category and then went ahead and won two acting awards (for the least engaging performances in the film) is just preposterous.  This is not a comedy.  It is not funny.  I'm not saying that it isn't a good film (not great, but it is good) but what I'm saying is that the marketing for this film is off.This is one of your more mellow and relaxed examples of period film; a film that takes it time developing some themes that don't quite fully connect (that rushed ending was ill-advised) and yet it definitely holds your attention despite the slow pacing.The film, adapted from the novel written by Elizabeth Von Arnim, tells the story of two unhappily married women (Lottie and Rose) who pool their money together to take a vacation for a month alone in Italy.  They rent a villa and convince two other women (a grumpy old woman and a man-eating socialite) to accompany them in order to split expenses.  The villa has a positive effect on the women (all four of them) and soon their troubles at home seem almost trivial to the point where both Lottie and Rose are inviting their husbands to join them.  Love is in the air, even for the elderly Mrs. Fisher who's heart softens for her housemates, and soon everything is joyous and wonderful and...then it ends.Seriously.I loved the look and feel of the film and the collective performances (except for Josie Lawrence who was awful) are great but the progression of story leaves a lot to be desired.  In hearing that it was originally made for British TV explains a lot, for there are parts where it actually feels like a poorly spliced together television mini-series.  I wasn't a fan of the multiple narrative voices and I felt like the film's conclusion was far too rushed and underdeveloped, especially with regard to the triangular relationship of Rose, Frederick and Caroline and the surprise love interest found in George.  It just kind of told you this was all happening and then BAM, the credits started to roll.Plowright is funny but nothing more than a gimmick and Richardson is somewhat dull (especially considering her other two roles that very same year).  Broadbent is engaging and Polly Walker is certainly best in show here.I wanted to love this but I felt like it just couldn't tie all the loose ends together and at the end of the day it was a poor man's Merchant Ivory production.",3,Mildly amused more than enchanted...,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,2433,"['Golden', 'Globes', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'fact', 'was', 'nominated', 'Comedy', 'category', 'then', 'went', 'ahead', 'won', 'two', 'acting', 'awards', 'least', 'engaging', 'performances', 'film', 'just', 'preposterous', 'not', 'comedy', 'not', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'marketing', 'film', 'off.This', 'one', 'more', 'mellow', 'relaxed', 'examples', 'period', 'film', 'film', 'time', 'developing', 'themes', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fully', 'connect', 'rushed', 'ending', 'was', 'ill-advised', 'yet', 'definitely', 'attention', 'slow', 'pacing.The', 'film', 'adapted', 'novel', 'written', 'Elizabeth', 'Von', 'Arnim', 'story', 'two', 'unhappily', 'married', 'women', 'Lottie', 'Rose', 'who', 'pool', 'money', 'together', 'take', 'vacation', 'month', 'alone', 'Italy', 'rent', 'villa', 'convince', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'grumpy', 'old', 'woman', 'man-eating', 'socialite', 'accompany', 'order', 'split', 'expenses', 'villa', 'positive', 'effect', 'women', 'four', 'soon', 'troubles', 'home', 'seem', 'almost', 'trivial', 'point', 'where', 'Lottie', 'Rose', 'are', 'inviting', 'husbands', 'join', 'Love', 'air', 'even', 'elderly', 'Mrs.', 'Fisher', 'who', 'heart', 'housemates', 'soon', 'everything', 'joyous', 'wonderful', 'then', 'loved', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'collective', 'performances', 'Josie', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'was', 'awful', 'are', 'great', 'progression', 'story', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'hearing', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'British', 'TV', 'lot', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'actually', 'poorly', 'spliced', 'together', 'television', 'mini-series', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'multiple', 'narrative', 'voices', 'felt', 'film', 'conclusion', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'rushed', 'underdeveloped', 'especially', 'regard', 'triangular', 'relationship', 'Rose', 'Frederick', 'Caroline', 'surprise', 'love', 'interest', 'found', 'George', 'just', 'kind', 'told', 'was', 'happening', 'then', 'BAM', 'credits', 'started', 'roll.Plowright', 'funny', 'nothing', 'more', 'gimmick', 'Richardson', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'especially', 'considering', 'other', 'two', 'roles', 'very', 'same', 'year', 'Broadbent', 'engaging', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'certainly', 'best', 'show', 'here.I', 'wanted', 'love', 'felt', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'tie', 'loose', 'together', 'end', 'day', 'was', 'poor', 'man', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'production']",Enchanted April VHS

An advertisement in the paper promising &quot;Wisteria and Sunshine&quot; at an Italian castle catches her eye.  She seeks out another forlorn soul, Rose Arbuthnot, and convinces her to share this villa for the month of April.  Because of expenses, they are forced to also take in two strangers to share the load.  Joining them will be Mrs. Fisher, an elderly woman who is hoping to remember &quot;better times and better men,&quot; and the beautiful Lady Caroline who is tired of the constant attention she receives and longs for a restorative quiet time.  When they arrive it is still raining, but at least as one of them so aptly puts it, &quot;This is Italian rain.&quot;  When morning dawns, the sun comes out and remains with them for the month.Enchanted with the peace and tranquility of her new surroundings, Lottie longs to share her joy with her husband.  When he arrives, Lottie urges Rose to invite her husband as well, but Rose fears that her husband, an author of racy novels under a pen name, will not come.  Imagine her surprise when he shows up immediately.  Of course, the catch is that he had no idea his wife was there but was hoping to have a dalliance with Lady Caroline.In the peaceful Italian sun, marriages heal, new love blossoms, and unlikely friendships are born.  The movie is light, filled with delicious humor and profound sentiments to stir your heart and soul.Most enchanting of all may be the beautiful scenes filmed on location in Portofino.

I've had music CD's transport me like this but I'm just trying to remember if there is another movie that makes me feel this way, but nothing comes to mind.  Enchanted April explores the tension and desperation that rules the lives of  two of the main characters.  You find yourself longing for them to be free from their confining lives.  All four women in this film are badly in need of change (although one is too obstinate to realize that she needs change) and finally find themselves going through a magical transformation when they share an Italian villa named San Salvatore for a few weeks in April.  This movie has charm, humor and most of all magic.Set in the 1920's a time of huge change from women's repressed attitudes and dress we witness the changes come about in Rose and Lottie (played by Miranda Richardson and Josie Lawrence) who initiate the getaway but find they need financial assistance to pull it off. Rose is a wife whose husband (Jim Broadbent) writes risque novellas much to her dismay.  This causes a riff between them especially since her husband spends much of his time way from her.  Alfred Molina plays Lottie's tight fisted husband who oversees her every move to make sure she is the model wife to advance his business ventures. Lottie and Rose decide to solicit two other women to share in the adventure but get more than they bargain for when rich continually sought after Flapper, Lady Caroline  (Polly Walker)  joins in along with Mrs.  Fisher, an overbearing older woman (Joan Plowright) whose only friends are the great dead authors who her family knew as she was growing up.  Although Rose and Lottie find Lady Caroline intriguing and awe inspiring because of her free thinking attitudes, bobbed hair, short hemline and  modern actions, it soon becomes evident that there will be a collision of personalities when old and new (Mrs. Fisher and Lady Caroline) refuse to mix just like water and oil.  The personality clashes are laced with many funny yet charming exchanges within the group.Somehow, someway the beautiful San Salvitore and it's springtime allure cushions the conflicts and eases the minds of all of the women one by one. Opposites in fortunes and attitudes become equals and their hopes, wishes and longings seem to come to fruition.  All of their harried thoughts, troubles and memories that have confined and confused them are coaxed away.  It's almost as if you are taking in the fresh air yourself and infinite beauty right along with the women and those they come to love and rekindle their love with.  The entrancing, picturesque film is enhanced by the high strings and soothing oboe solos in this very pretty soundtrack.  I adore watching this movie on cool sunny spring mornings with a light breeze blowing through my open windows.

Watching this film is like watching a beautiful flower bloom from the most miniscule, dew-covered bud. There is a charm and warmth found here that is sadly missing in film today.When an ad is placed in the paper offering a vacation of wisteria and sunshine at a castle by the sea in Italy, two Englishwomen with only a passing acquaintance from church, Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Rose (Miranda Richardson), leave their mates behind to join two other women for an April to remember.The two other women are as different as night and day, yet will be affected by their surroundings in the same magical way. Joan Plowright is delightful as the elderly Mrs. Fisher, who begins to live again under the spell of wisteria and sunshine. But it is beautiful Polly Walker's portrayel of Caroline Hester, with her magic eyes and Louise Brooks look, that nearly steals the show.The internal musings of Lottie and Rose, meanwhile, prompt both women to do the unthinkable and send for their husbands. This brings about some humorous and unexpected events to this April on the Riviera.Just as in the gentle and beautiful novel, each will begin to find inner happiness and a rebirth of love. Very few films have the ability to refresh the soul and leave you feeling good about life like this magical film. Those in need of a region two format will find something special here.

And because it had received, as far as I know, very little publicity, I wasn't expecting much. But my word how it surprised me!Two young women, Lottie Wilkins (Josie Lawrence), and Rose Arbuthnot (Miranda Richardson), bored with their unappealing husbands and feeling trapped in a dreary, smoky1920's London, in which it never seems to stop raining, decide to get away from it all to a castle on the Mediterranean - the very castle in fact in which the original novel on which the film is based was written. Advertising for two others to go with them in order to defray expenses, they find themselves having to settle for Mrs Fisher (Joan Plowright), an irascible old woman who claims to have been the friend of many distinguished writers all now dead (""Did you know Keats?"" asks the rather simple-minded Lotti while Rose cringes in the background. ""No! I didn't."" shouts Mrs Fisher. ""I didn't know Shakespeare or Chaucer either"" ), and Lady Caroline Dester, a glamourous socialite who sick and tired of men and their grabbing attentions, just wants, like Garbo, to be alone.On the first morning when Lottie opens her bedroom shutters, the incredible beauty of the place with its sun, ocean, fresh-air and flowers, bursts upon her and instantly begins to work its therapeutic magic, not only on her but on all of them. From arriving dull, depressed and querulous, they become within hours, hopeful, optimistic and far more loving. Lottie startles and pleasantly surprises Mrs Fisher by actually kissing her, and even begins to remember what it was about her husband that she loved. She decides to send for him and persuades Rose to do the same. Lottie's husband comes - though not in answer to her letter but to see Lady Dester, he being one of the men she is trying to get away from. Finding his wife there comes as a complete surprise.However, both husbands respond to their wives' now happy, loving natures and, as a consequence, again become lovable themselves. The owner of the castleGeorge Briggs, (Michael Kitchen) pays a visit and falling for Rose, is disappointed when her husband turns up. But he is not miserable for long. The magic of the place has also cast its spell on Lady Dester and seeing George's distress she seeks him out to offer sympathy - with predictable results. I am giving nothing away when I say that all are paired off at the end - except for lonely, irascible Mrs Fisher who now of course is lonely and irascible no longer.Everything about this film seems to me perfect. I can think of nothing to carp about. There is much humour in the dialogue and everyone acts supremely well although I was most impressed by Josie Lawrence and Michael Kitchen. So subtle are the changing expressions that move across the face of Lawrence that you can almost read her thoughts. This is indeed a little gem of a film. It is certainly the best ...

Lottie and her friend Rose Arbuthnot (Miranda Richardson) who is just as unhappy in her marriage to Frederick the author of racy novels (Jim Broadbent) who is not above flirting - or even more - with other women. It is drab and rainy, in post-WWI London, and the two women want to get away for a holiday from the rain, their dreary lives and unhappy marriages. And like a miracle, they discover an advertisement for a castle for rent; but to make it work, they must invite two more people to share expenses. They find the elderly widow, Mrs. Fisher - living on memories of better days, when she was not relatively poor, and was friends with many of the literary figures of that day - but not Keats, as she acidly points out to the other ladies. The final member of their quartet is the beautiful socialite, Lady Caroline Dester (Polly Walker), who wants to get away from the exhausting social whirl - but mostly away those men in it.So this odd and apparently incompatible quartet are off to Italy, and a month-long stay in a picture-perfect mellowed-stone castle, set in a marvelous garden, overlooking the sea - and the remainder of the plot unfolds at a leisurely pace. The castle is as magical as Lottie and Rose had hoped, and over the weeks it works on all of them: Mrs. Fisher's prickly nature mellows, as she becomes a kind of matriarch. Lady Caroline, astonishingly enough, finds love in the form of the castle's eccentric musician owner. Rose and her husband renew their own affections, and Lottie - initially rather pathetic and ineffectual - emerges as a serene and wise presence, at the very heart of this odd and self-selected family. The sense of place and time is impeccable, and the castle itself is almost another character.This movie is highly recommended for anyone like me, who is sick to death of movies containing car-chases, massive explosions and endless rounds of machine-gun fire.The only extra included is a commentary by director Mike Newell and producer Ann Scott.",5,"Wisteria, Sunshine and Renewal",1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2354,"['Based', 'novel', 'popular', 'turn', 'last-century', 'author', 'Elizabeth', 'von', 'Arnim', 'gentle', 'tale', 'four', 'women', 'spring', 'holiday', 'charming', 'small', 'castle', 'Italian', 'Riviera', 'place', 'full', 'wisteria', 'sunshine', 'renewal.Lottie', 'Wilkins', 'Josie', 'Lawrence', 'fussy', 'down-trodden', 'married', 'overbearing', 'Mellersh', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Lottie', 'friend', 'Rose', 'Arbuthnot', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'who', 'just', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'Frederick', 'author', 'racy', 'novels', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'not', 'flirting', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'women', 'drab', 'rainy', 'post-WWI', 'London', 'two', 'women', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'holiday', 'rain', 'dreary', 'lives', 'unhappy', 'marriages', 'miracle', 'discover', 'advertisement', 'castle', 'rent', 'make', 'work', 'must', 'invite', 'two', 'more', 'people', 'share', 'expenses', 'find', 'elderly', 'widow', 'Mrs.', 'Fisher', 'living', 'memories', 'better', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'relatively', 'poor', 'was', 'friends', 'many', 'literary', 'figures', 'day', 'not', 'Keats', 'acidly', 'out', 'other', 'ladies', 'final', 'member', 'quartet', 'beautiful', 'socialite', 'Lady', 'Caroline', 'Dester', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'who', 'get', 'away', 'exhausting', 'social', 'whirl', 'mostly', 'away', 'men', 'it.So', 'odd', 'apparently', 'incompatible', 'quartet', 'are', 'Italy', 'month-long', 'stay', 'picture-perfect', 'mellowed-stone', 'castle', 'set', 'marvelous', 'garden', 'overlooking', 'sea', 'remainder', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'castle', 'as', 'magical', 'Lottie', 'Rose', 'had', 'hoped', 'weeks', 'Mrs.', 'Fisher', 'prickly', 'nature', 'mellows', 'kind', 'matriarch', 'Lady', 'Caroline', 'astonishingly', 'enough', 'love', 'form', 'castle', 'eccentric', 'musician', 'owner', 'Rose', 'husband', 'renew', 'own', 'affections', 'Lottie', 'initially', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'ineffectual', 'emerges', 'serene', 'wise', 'presence', 'very', 'heart', 'odd', 'self-selected', 'family', 'sense', 'place', 'time', 'impeccable', 'castle', 'almost', 'character.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'sick', 'death', 'movies', 'containing', 'car-chases', 'massive', 'explosions', 'endless', 'rounds', 'machine-gun', 'fire.The', 'only', 'extra', 'included', 'commentary', 'director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'producer', 'Ann', 'Scott']",Enchanted April VHS

Instead, I will write about how I feel about this amazing film. I remember years ago, when I was in my early 20's working in a video store, a man came in to return the video saying it was the worst film he had ever seen. My jaw dropped, because I was totally entranced by this same film, which I had gone to the movies to see three times when it was out the year before.Now, at 41, I am still awed by its beauty. Since its release, I have always looked to 'Enchanted April' to take me away. And it always does. The acting is superb (or course, look at the cast!) and the cinematography is gorgeous (OK, so what if they used fake wisteria). To quote from the movie: ""This place makes me feel flooded with love."" Just replace the word 'place' with 'film' and there you have it.Made primarily for BBC TV, I am still amazed this film was transferred into enhanced Widescreen. In doing so, we seem to lose a bit of image. A perfect example is when Polly Walker's character bumps into Rose's husband, who just arrived and is climbing the stairs to the castle. In the regular version, we see Polly wearing the typical 1920's strapped shoes. This scene remains on my mind because I remember thinking at the time how tightly (uncomfortably so) strapped around her ankles they were. These are not seen in the widescreen version as they are cut off from the screen.

329930,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6302728657,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[24, 25]","In 1922, Elizabeth von Arnim, a British novelist famous for many novels which include the 1898 novel ""Elizabeth and Her German Garden"" and the 1917 novel ""Christine"" (or Alice Cholmondeley) wrote the 1922 novel ""The Enchanted April"".  The novel would inspire a play and would have its first film adaption in 1935.But in 1992, director Mike Newell (""Donnie Brasco"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and the upcoming ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"") and screenwriter Peter Barnes adapted the novel to a film  and in 1993, the film would go on to win two Golden Globe Awards (Best Actress - Miranda Richardson and Best Supporting Actress - Joan Plowright) and nominated for three Academy Awards.And now as part of MIRAMAX's ""Award Winning Collection"", the DVD release of ""ENCHANTED APRIL"" is now finally here.VIDEO & AUDIO:""ENCHANTED APRIL"" is presented in Widescreen (1:85:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  The picture quality does show its age and there is a tremendous amount of grain and dust and scratches are quite evident.  So, I was a bit surprised this film didn't get a digital remastered treatment.Despite the film's picture quality, there are a few things that really standout.  Moreso for the cinematography.  For one, the overall location of where the film was shot is absolutely beautiful.  The lush vegetation, the flowers, the blue skies and blue ocean and also to keep the 1920's style and feel courtesy of Sheena Napier's costume design.As for audio, the feature sports a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The film is dialogue heavy with the occasonal music to showcase the mood and beauty of the villa but audio is primarily dialogue driven.  Dialogue is clearly heard.SPECIAL FEATURES:Unfortunately, there is only one feature and that is the feature's commentary with Director Mike Newell and Producer Ann Scott.  You can tell its been a long time since these two have seen the film and it's like they are seeing it for the first time.  Both talk about the challenge of getting the film financed but also the challenges of filming at the villa and getting the beautiful shots.There are periods of no commentary as both Newell and Scott are just delighted by the acting of the talent.  But since 17 years have passed since the film was released, some scenes are difficult for Director Newell to recall.JUDGMENT CALL:""ENCHANTED APRIL""is a story that has enchanted many readers and also viewers for decades.  A film about four women who want to escape their own reality, even if it is just for a little time to reflect on their own personal lives and to realize what they want, what makes them happy and if anything, an act of independence.The film does showcase such a beautiful location and to see each of the four women transformed, revitalized and most of all, to see how the location changes them and their thoughts was nice to see.  Lottie who is seen desperately wanting to get away from her drab life and living a life of mostly being a servant, is instantly transformed to a woman who wants to make her own decisions but invites the very person she was trying to get away from.  Both instantly find each other.And of course, without having to spoil the film, to see how each of the women find themselves is the film's strongest point.Having not read the 1922 novel, one of the positive remarks by those who have read the original novel and have seen the 1993 film, have said the film follows the novel closely.  No director's change of interpretation of Elizabeth von Arnim's popular novel but keeping consistent.But I will have to be truthful that many fans of this film have awaited its DVD release and hoping for it to look a lot better than their old VHS copy.  The film does look good on DVD, especially during the outdoor scenes showcasing the villa but for some reason, I was amazed by the amount of grain, scratches and dust that appeared on the final DVD cut of the film. For it to be part of the MIRAMAX AWARD WINNING COLLECTION, I was hoping that like other collections being released on DVD, their would be digitally remastering for a classic film like this.Another thing I was hoping was to see more special features.  Especially new interviews with the cast and their feelings of the film after all these years, for a film on DVD that people have been waiting for, I just wished there was more than the commentary included.  But at least, fans do get a commentary track by Director Mike Newell and Producer Ann Scott.Overall, an enchanting and entertaining film makes its long-awaited debut to DVD and for fans of this film, definitely a film worth checking out.",4,"The long awaited release on DVD, ""Enchanted April"" is an enchanting story but I take one star off for picture quality",1241568000,"05 6,

I crave violence, guns, fast cars, hot chicks, and super expensive Special Effects!So why am I reviewing this movie that has absolutely nothing to do with any of the above? Because I also looooove a good vacation!! And even though this movie is about two women who take a holiday in Italy, that's not what I was referring to. ACTUALLY WATCHING this little movie is literally like taking a mini-vacation!!I've seen this movie in theatres and had it on VHS at one time (recorded from cable) and I came on here hoping to find it available on DVD. Sadly, tragically it's not, but hopefully it will be soon. I read some of the reviews of this and I must say every single one (positive one anyways) is spot on. If you're wondering whether or not to get this, I'd say trust what you read here and take a chance. You won't be sorry. In this review I wont give any spoilers or much plot details. Because this movie is so much more than a mere plot...Whether it's a cold rainy day, or too much is going on in life, or you've watched one too many action movies lately, or for ANY reason at all, grab a bowl of popcorn, a pillow and your favorite blankey, have a seat and pop this movie in. And then prepare to be healed! ;)The experience of watching this movie is like this: It starts of gray and dreary, kinda like how things in your life may be going. The plot is wonderfully simple and very easy to follow, while engaging enough to immediately cause you to be concerned and interested about the main characters. Basically two &quot;friends&quot; are sick of how things are going and want to get away. Then after a while you are whisked away to this scenic, majestic world of peaceful serenity and mysterious beauty, and to this ancient Italian chateau, which actually becomes one of the stars in the movie. Once you're there, you are comforted, catered to, entertained, intrigued, and overally refreshed! The movie's slower than snail pace in this colorful otherworld, while retaining it's magical engagement suddenly casts a spell on you before you even know it, and you find yourself absorbed, relaxed, and essentially ON VACATION! As the movie winds up and things get resolved, the rest of the cast of characters comes in and things get a little rompous. But it never breaks its hold on you and you really get a kick out of some of the resulting scenes! And at the end what seals the whole experience before returning you back to your life is a small bit of the only special effects in the movie concerning a certain &quot;tree&quot;. The last bit of magic in a fully magical movie. As you return to life you feel as though your soul has taken a holiday and you feel supremely good!Now for me, that's about the time to pop in another 007 DVD!!This movie, as you can see, is a rare treat and has an even rarer enchantment within it. There is simply no other movie like it and you owe yourself at least a viewing! You will be enchanted...

Imagine my surprise when I discovered, upon seeking for a DVD copy to gift a friend who has been ignorant of it all these years, that DVDs of this excellent little gem are not to be had. That seems to be a trend, as several movies that are must-haves in my collection have not been released to DVD.

I have wanted to go to Italy in the Springtime since I saw this movie in an art cinema when it first came out. It has always worked as a sinecure for depression for me (I found a $20 bill in the lobby the day I went to see it at the cinema!); the personifications of the four women at the heart of the story are absolutely superb. Lottie and Rose, the two caged-up housewives in post-war London, struggling to find some answer to the whys of life in charity work; the lonely old woman (played with great style by Joan Plowright), clinging to her memories of long-dead poets; and the bored, titled socialite (played well by Polly Walker), looking for a stimulus away from her stagnant, well-bred life full of ennui. They all stumble into an unlikely partnership in the renting of an Italian villa for a month and in that time learn more about themselves and the world they must live in than they ever thought possible. And the backdrop is stunning. I so want to visit this place.With every viewing of this movie I feel a deep peace and contentment. Everyone within the confines of the story blooms. The setting - and the personal discoveries - are pure magic. I always feel rather as if I have just gone on holiday when I watch it.

She is one of an unlikely quartet of women who have rented the villa, perched on a cliff above the Tyrrhenian Sea, for the month of April. Each of the others has her own reasons for escaping: a repressive marriage, the relentlessly thankless responsibilities of doing good works, and just plain willfulness--all of which are exacerbated by the seemingly endless downpour of London rain. All of their respective problems, however, boil down to an essential loneliness, for which the Ligurian coast of Itlay provides the antidote.In this high-calibre ensemble cast, Joan Plowright stands out as the sour, embittered bluestocking, Mrs. Fisher, who has staked a claim of having been the confidant of the 19th-century literary illuminati (but not Keats!); her main problem is that they are all dead. Josie Lawrence plays the awkwardly outspoken Lottie, who persuades a slight acquaintance, Rose--a devout woman with a philandering husband--to go halves and answer an advert, which promises wisteria and sunshine. Miranda Richardson, who with her smooth  red hair looks as if she belongs in a Pre-Raphaelite painting,  endows her character with a tranquil charm, which quite captivates the owner of the villa, Mr. Briggs, a myopic First-World-War veteran. Michael Kitchen is at his most engaging in the role of the solitary man who finds solace in playing the oboe. Polly Walker, who seemingly floats on air, is convincing as the world-weary Lady Caroline.As the setting works its spell on the women, one almost wishes that they not spoil it by inviting their menfolk (Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent) to stay; but all that is part of the enchantment, and to say any more would spoil it for you.""Enchanted April"" is not only beautiful to view, but it also has its moments of high comedy, especially in scenes with Plowright, Molina, and Broadbent. And while the film will make one feel awfully good, it is never syrupy. If I have a criticism, it is one of omission. I wanted to see more of the story after the husbands and Mr. Briggs arrived.

Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone.Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, ""Enchanted April"" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love.

This is a quiet movie that unfolds gently and will probably appeal more to a female audience.Enchanted April is the story of two British women who are tired of the cold and the gloom and the rain in London...and they seem to be equally tired of their restricted lives.  Lottie is one women, whose husband seems only interested in how he can get ahead in business and thinks his wife is pretty uninteresting.  Lottie ropes Rose into joining her on their adventure in renting a vila/castle in Italy for a whole month.  Rose also is pretty lost, being that her husband writes the trashy sex novels of the day and spends his time chasing after pretty young things.They can't afford this grand vila among the wisteria, so they get two other women to join them.  Mrs Fisher who spends her days pretty much living in the past, among her photos and letters, and Lady Caroline who is weary of the grand life of a pretty young thing much in demand and just wants to go someplace quiet and relax.  Together, they venture into the Italian landscape, the wild gardens and the rocky seashore of San Salvatori...and re-discover not just themselves but romance itself.Yes, its a quiet and even slow movie at times, but the pacing is perfect for the story.  This is a movie about enchantment, about being quiet enough to hear your own heart, and about the kindling or re-kindling of love.

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[5, 5]","This film is a beautiful and extremely faithful rendering of a lovely book.It begins with a cast that is talented and dead perfect.  Josie Lawrence as the somewhat loopy romantic, Miranda Richardson as the ""disappointed Madonna,"" Joan Plowright as the stuffy, controlling dowager, and Polly __ as the lovely Lady Caroline, searching, even though she doesn't know it.The story takes you from the humdrum, drizzly life of the city to the luxurious splendor of an Italian villa on the sea.  Reading the book is like taking a vacation, and so is the film.  But it is not only the location which refreshes, it is the gradual infusion that Josie Lawrence spreads, of hope, and the feeling that no good thing is impossible if people would just believe in it.Personally, at one twilight moment when ""In the glow of twilight"" is playing on a gramaphone, I always cry, because it is a beautiful moment of reconciliation, but also because my grandfather used to whistle and hum that song.  Now that I have heard the words, I realize he must have been singing it for/to my grandmother.The production values are top notch in every respect, from the crowded ""art parties"" where Lady Caroline is cloistered, to the suffocating Victorian darkness of the home of Miranda Richardson's character and Joan Plowright's.The men are equally stupendous.  You may recognize the star of PBS's Foyle's War, as the suprise love interest that sweeps us away with his mistakes and his nearsightedness.  Alfred Molina blossoms from gruff to sexy as Lottie's stiff husband.  This ultimately is about regular everyday love... not just between mates, but between ""mates"" - friends.

Italy at its best has always had a way of smoothing out the rough edges that normal life imposes.The time period for ""Enchanted April"" is almost a hundred years ago, after World War I (when it was known as The Great War and nobody imagined there'd be another).  Four London women rent an Italian palazzo from a musician, Mr. Briggs, to get away from the miserable weather and their boredom.  Two of the women, Lottie and Rose, are not very happily married--the third (Lady Caroline) is a wealthy, beautiful party girl who needs a break from all her fawning suitors--and the fourth (Mrs. Fisher) is a stern older widow who lives grimly in the past.Within a few days of arrival, they all begin to mellow out, and Lottie and Rose decide to invite their husbands to enjoy the paradise they've stumbled onto.  Lottie is a bit psychic and starts to predict what will happen to all of them (only good things).  The two dreary husbands even flourish in the Italian air.  Then the handsome and near-sighted Mr. Briggs appears to see how they're all doing, and one thing leads to another.It's a movie that is molto bello and delizioso.

I strongly encourage you to see it if you have not.Josie Lawrence leads a strong cast as Lottie Wilkins, a dowdy London housewife who we meet in the film's first frames trudging through post-WW I London.  We meet Alfred Molina as her overbearing husband, Mellersh, who eyes all relationships as potential business opportunities, and sees his wife as not much more than a pet.Lottie is riding on the bus in the dreary rain one day when she sees an advertisement on the back of the paper for an Italian Castle to be let for the month of April among the ""Wisteria and Sunshine"".  Lottie's life hasn't allowed her much love or friendship, but she decides that she MUST take this April Holiday at San Salvatori.  She approaches Rose Arbuthnot, who she barely knows, but has seen looking sad at Church services.Rose is played by Miranda Richardson in a performance that suggests, if anything, that she has had her happiness even more suppressed than Lottie.  Her husband, Arthur, is played by Jim Broadbent in full ruddy-faced glory.  Arthur is a hedonistic author who writes pulpy trash novels with names like ""Theodocia, the Slave Princess"".  He also chases after other young women who come closer to meeting his ideal of fun than his pious wife.Lottie and Rose secure the rent of the villa and decide to advertise for a couple of other ladies to share the expense.  Joan Plowright plays Mrs. Fisher, an older lady who grew up bouncing on the knee of the great English Poets of the day.  Blundering Lottie asks ""Oh, did you know Keats?"" a century and a half after Keat's day.""No"", Mrs. Fisher replies with disdain.  ""And I didn't know Shakespeare or Chaucer either.""Polly Walker is the poster-girl of the group as Lady Caroline Dester, daughter of an extremely rich and aristocratic English Lord.  Caroline moves in the most social of circles, but she has grown tired of being around men who paw and grab after her.  She just wants a little time to ""smooth her feathers"".Michael Kitchen plays George Briggs, the owner of the Italian Castle.  Mr. Briggs is something of a mystery, as it appears that he is a wealthy English businessman, but he is also a gifted musician in addition to owning an Italian Castle, complete with a full staff.  He is extremely short-sighted and doesn't bother to keep his immediate surroundings tidy.  His few scenes are among the best of the movie.These 4 ladies converge upon the Italian Castle and there... magic happens.  I could go into detail, but I'd spoil you the pleasure of finding out for yourself.  There are several times when the plot throws a wrench into the works, and in a different, lesser story, the movie would have degenerated into hysterical ""drama"".  The way this film reveals and resolves these confrontations is like.... a breath of fresh Italian breeze through the Wisteria.  I would ask only that you consider the shots of the moon in the penultimate scene - consider what the size and location of the moon means with regard to the tone of what is happening in the scene in the foreground.  It is delightful.If you can watch ""Enchanted April"" and not be charmed I feel truly sorry for you.  It is on my very short list of very favorite films.After years inexplicably not in release on DVD, it is finally available.

No blockbuster, just a soft and gentle romance of the kind the Brits do better than anybody elsep; not trivial as it has a solid story of various separate lives that all intertwine for a month. No violence, no sex, no gratuitous bad language. Mostly middle-aged Englishwomen on holiday in an Italian villa in April. Nothing for them to do but sit around. Perfect formula for a perfect yawn... but the film begins on a wet and dull afternoon in period London at the end of winter and gradually transforms into a sunlit film, full of excellent English character actors, and gently weaves a web that entrances the viewer. We bought this film on video over a decade ago and I guess we've seen it half a dozen times. It is the perfect film for when you don't want violence, sex and bad language, just a delightful light romance. But don't take this categorizing by me wrong, the acting is superb, and the gradual transformation of each character  generally surprising and welcome. Jim Broadbent is a joy and Alfred Molina his usual great self. The women are all magnificent. We eagerly expected the film to be issued on DVD ages ago, and can only suppose that there must be distribution contractual problems that have held it up.

The story revolves around four women - two unhappily married women [played by Josie Lawrence & Miranda Richardson], a curmudgeon of a widow [Joan Plowright], and an upper-class disenchanted beauty [a luminous Polly Walker, most recently seen in the HBO mini-series Rome]...all four co-rent a beautiful Italian palazzo for a month circa the 1920s. Josie Lawrence acts so convincingly in her role that you truly believe in the magic of the place & time, and that life does not have to be complicated unless one wants it to be. Miranda Richardson plays her role as the uptight wife of an author quite well, with great facial expressions that give us a glimpse into her emotional upheaval. Joan Plowright is delightful as the grumpy widow, and Polly Walker is convincing in her role as a jaded aristocrat.The men in this movie are definitely just supporting characters, but each one, from the guy that plays the owner of the palazzo, to Jim Broadbent's author, and finally Alfred Molina's stuffy solicitor are significant in enhancing the plot.
