1252226,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0026ZQJT8,calvinnme,"[45, 45]","This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R with no extras other than a trailer and no chapter stops. You may only go forward and backwards in ten minute increments.Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre were terrific in the films they made together, this being the best of the ones I've seen so far. Best known for their appearance together in supporting roles in The Maltese Falcon, they also did a series of films together during and immediately after World War II in which they starred, since many of the Warner Brothers A list stars were serving in the military.The year is 1890. Greenstreet plays the superintendent of police of Scotland Yard, George Edward Grodman, who has just been to the execution of a man he arrested for the crime of murdering an elderly woman. He arrives back at his office to discover that the man is in fact innocent, as the clergyman that the man claimed as an alibi has finally surfaced. Disgraced, he is forced to resign in favor of his subordinate, John Buckley (George Coulouris).Grodman is a man of means, so the loss of a paycheck doesn't seem to be a problem, but his nightmares about sending an innocent man to the gallows are. He seems to be recovering, and even making plans for writing a book about his past cases, when a neighbor from across the street is murdered. The crime seems to be a perfect one - the murderer apparently killed the man from inside his own locked room and escaped without detection or leaving any clues behind. However, the brash and boorish new superintendent Buckley will not accept that, and continues seeking a suspect, although in the manner of a bull in a china shoppe. In the meantime, there are a multitude of suspects that intersect with a multitude of witnesses, and Grodman along with the help of his friend, illustrator Victor Emmric (Peter Lorre) decide to do some investigating themselves on their own time.Greenstreet and Lorre are terrific together as always, with a timing and chemistry that makes them great at these kinds of films. You never know if the likable exteriors displayed by each is the truth or a lie in either or both cases, usually up to the end. This one will keep you guessing right up to the final scene, and I highly recommend it.The video and audio quality on this film are very good. It's too bad it wasn't put on a pressed DVD with commentary so deserving of such an artfully done film. The only negative thing I can say about the product itself is that it says it contains a trailer. When I play what is supposed to be the trailer, what I in fact get are the first few minutes of the film itself. Such is typical of the worst thing about the Warner Archive products so far - the extremely variable quality and outright mistakes made during the manufacturing of the individual discs themselves.",5,Terrific film noir,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,2801,"['Warner', 'Archive', 'product', 'DVD-R', 'extras', 'other', 'trailer', 'chapter', 'may', 'only', 'go', 'forward', 'backwards', 'ten', 'minute', 'increments.Sydney', 'Greenstreet', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'were', 'terrific', 'films', 'made', 'together', 'being', 'best', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'Best', 'known', 'appearance', 'together', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'also', 'did', 'series', 'films', 'together', 'immediately', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'starred', 'many', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'A', 'list', 'stars', 'were', 'serving', 'military.The', 'year', '1890', 'Greenstreet', 'superintendent', 'police', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'George', 'Edward', 'Grodman', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'execution', 'man', 'arrested', 'crime', 'murdering', 'elderly', 'woman', 'back', 'office', 'discover', 'man', 'fact', 'innocent', 'clergyman', 'man', 'claimed', 'alibi', 'finally', 'surfaced', 'Disgraced', 'forced', 'resign', 'favor', 'subordinate', 'John', 'Buckley', 'George', 'Coulouris', '.Grodman', 'man', 'means', 'loss', 'paycheck', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'problem', 'nightmares', 'sending', 'innocent', 'man', 'gallows', 'are', 'be', 'recovering', 'even', 'making', 'plans', 'writing', 'book', 'past', 'cases', 'when', 'neighbor', 'street', 'murdered', 'crime', 'be', 'perfect', 'one', 'murderer', 'apparently', 'killed', 'man', 'own', 'locked', 'room', 'escaped', 'detection', 'leaving', 'clues', 'However', 'brash', 'boorish', 'new', 'superintendent', 'Buckley', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'seeking', 'suspect', 'manner', 'bull', 'china', 'shoppe', 'meantime', 'are', 'multitude', 'suspects', 'intersect', 'multitude', 'witnesses', 'Grodman', 'help', 'friend', 'illustrator', 'Victor', 'Emmric', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'decide', 'do', 'investigating', 'own', 'time.Greenstreet', 'Lorre', 'are', 'terrific', 'together', 'always', 'timing', 'chemistry', 'great', 'kinds', 'films', 'never', 'know', 'likable', 'exteriors', 'displayed', 'truth', 'lie', 'cases', 'usually', 'end', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'put', 'pressed', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'so', 'deserving', 'such', 'artfully', 'done', 'film', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'product', 'trailer', 'When', 'play', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'trailer', 'what', 'fact', 'get', 'are', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'Such', 'typical', 'worst', 'thing', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'products', 'so', 'far', 'extremely', 'variable', 'quality', 'outright', 'mistakes', 'made', 'manufacturing', 'individual', 'discs']",The Verdict

1252229,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B0026ZQJT8,David R. Eastwood,"[0, 0]","THE VERDICT (1946) is an engaging murder mystery movie starring Peter Lorre as a somewhat creepy artist and Sidney Greenstreet as his close friend, a brilliant police detective. Greenstreet, in the opening minutes, is forced to resign because evidence he gathered led to the conviction and execution of an innocent man. Greenstreet's replacement as chief detective (George Coulouris), a nasty subordinate who had been bucking for his job for years, gloats that HE will never make such an error.The very next morning, a wealthy young gentleman is found murdered in his bed in his apartment whose windows are all latched and whose only door was locked and bolted from  the inside. Is the same killer to blame? Can the new chief detective solve this puzzle? Or will he, too, make a major mistake, perhaps causing the unjust conviction and sentencing of another innocent person?Sufficient clues to the mystery's solution ARE there for viewers to spot, but this Fair-Play Puzzle is NOT an easy one to solve.In my own case, sadly, I could not play the game. I knew within the first 7 or 8 minutes where THE VERDICT was going, not because I'm any sort of great detective, but because I began noticing dozens of resemblances between this film and an 1891 detective novel I'd read 14 years ago -- THE BIG BOW MYSTERY by the little known author Israel Zangwill.At least 85 percent of this movie's general plot and 100 percent of its &#34;locked-room mystery&#34; plot are based on this late Victorian mystery novel. And by the way, I very highly recommend this nearly forgotten novel, which is excellent in its humor and its human psychology, as well as in its very skillful puzzle construction.",4,"AN EXAMPLE OF ""THE PERFECT CRIME"" ...

1252231,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0026ZQJT8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[16, 16]","This is THE VERDICT that doesn't star Paul Newman and James Mason. This is THE VERDICT that sets its tale in a foggy and gaslit Victorian London, in the year 1890. The atmosphere is appropriately noirish and even gothic, a stylish backdrop to complement the theatrical antics of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, as odd a couple as you'll ever set eyes on.Greenstreet was an expansive man, in girth and in acting prowess. Shame it is that he waited until he was 61 before making his cinematic debut. As it were, he was featured in quite a few memorable roles, none more incandescent than his casting of the eloquent ""Kasper Gutman"" in THE MALTESE FALCON. Still, his performance in 1946's THE VERDICT as Scotland Yard's cocksure Superintendent Grodman can't be dismissed.Except that the film opens with the puncturing of Superintendent Grodman's ego and credibility, as evidence surfaces which exonerates a man he'd just swung on the gallows. Grodman retires in abject shame, forfeiting his position to a loathed rival, the insufferable Inspector John R. Buckley who doesn't shy from crowing about his superior detecting skills. He lectures Grodman: ""There's always a clue...""The narrative picks up some time later as the ex-Superintendent Grodman and his good friend, the macabre artist Victor Emmric (Lorre), get embroiled in a locked room murder mystery. Superintendent Buckley lands the investigation but when called upon to deliver on his sleuthing chops, he doesn't quite. There are a number of sketchy suspects to choose from, not the least of which is that same Victor Emmric, a practically decadent character who persists in lobbing amusing asides and lurking in shadows. And since Peter Lorre also plays him with his trademark twitchiness, no wonder your suspicious eyes first flicker over to him.Don Siegel directs his first feature film, and he does it with confidence and vigor and enviable craftsmanship, demonstrating promise and potential. Ernest Haller's cinematography lends oodles of texture and mood. I don't know that the mystery itself is so engrossing or elegant, although there is a delectable swerve at the end. Mostly, the draw to this film is whenever the majestic Greenstreet and the droll (and just a bit effete) Lorre share the camera. THE VERDICT is their ninth and final movie together, and they've got their patter and their synchronicity perfected, this pair exhibiting a respective flair for dialogue. Not to mention it's always intriguing to gaze at the contrast of their physiques. See them in this one and soak in, too, the evocative Victorian setting and a well-acted tale ultimately fueled by hubris, by fatal oneupmanship.",4,"""The air is full of sinister currents tonight.""",1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,2664,"['THE', 'VERDICT', ""n't"", 'star', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'James', 'Mason', 'THE', 'VERDICT', 'tale', 'foggy', 'gaslit', 'Victorian', 'London', 'year', '1890', 'atmosphere', 'appropriately', 'noirish', 'even', 'gothic', 'stylish', 'backdrop', 'complement', 'theatrical', 'antics', 'Sydney', 'Greenstreet', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'odd', 'couple', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'set', 'eyes', 'on.Greenstreet', 'was', 'expansive', 'man', 'girth', 'acting', 'prowess', 'Shame', 'waited', 'was', '61', 'making', 'cinematic', 'debut', 'were', 'was', 'featured', 'quite', 'few', 'memorable', 'roles', 'none', 'more', 'incandescent', 'casting', 'eloquent', 'Kasper', 'Gutman', 'THE', 'MALTESE', 'FALCON', 'Still', 'performance', '1946', 'THE', 'VERDICT', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'cocksure', 'Superintendent', 'Grodman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'dismissed.Except', 'film', 'puncturing', 'Superintendent', 'Grodman', 'ego', 'credibility', 'evidence', 'surfaces', 'man', ""'d"", 'just', 'swung', 'gallows', 'Grodman', 'abject', 'shame', 'forfeiting', 'position', 'loathed', 'rival', 'insufferable', 'Inspector', 'John', 'R.', 'Buckley', 'who', ""n't"", 'shy', 'crowing', 'superior', 'detecting', 'skills', 'Grodman', 'always', 'clue', 'narrative', 'up', 'time', 'later', 'ex-Superintendent', 'Grodman', 'good', 'friend', 'macabre', 'artist', 'Victor', 'Emmric', 'Lorre', 'get', 'embroiled', 'locked', 'room', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Superintendent', 'Buckley', 'investigation', 'when', 'called', 'deliver', 'sleuthing', 'chops', ""n't"", 'quite', 'are', 'number', 'sketchy', 'suspects', 'choose', 'not', 'least', 'same', 'Victor', 'Emmric', 'practically', 'decadent', 'character', 'who', 'lobbing', 'amusing', 'asides', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'also', 'trademark', 'twitchiness', 'wonder', 'suspicious', 'eyes', 'first', 'flicker', 'him.Don', 'Siegel', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'confidence', 'vigor', 'enviable', 'craftsmanship', 'demonstrating', 'promise', 'potential', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'cinematography', 'oodles', 'texture', 'mood', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'mystery', 'so', 'engrossing', 'elegant', 'delectable', 'swerve', 'end', 'Mostly', 'draw', 'film', 'whenever', 'majestic', 'Greenstreet', 'droll', 'just', 'bit', 'effete', 'Lorre', 'share', 'camera', 'VERDICT', 'ninth', 'final', 'movie', 'together', ""'ve"", 'got', 'patter', 'synchronicity', 'perfected', 'pair', 'exhibiting', 'respective', 'flair', 'dialogue', 'Not', 'mention', 'always', 'intriguing', 'gaze', 'contrast', 'physiques', 'See', 'one', 'soak', 'too', 'evocative', 'Victorian', 'setting', 'well-acted', 'tale', 'ultimately', 'fueled', 'hubris', 'fatal', 'oneupmanship']",The Verdict
