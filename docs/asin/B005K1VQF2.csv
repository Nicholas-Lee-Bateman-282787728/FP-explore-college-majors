1463504,AX93URVYM33YI,B005K1VQF2,"Arthur Sido ""But who are you, O man, to answe...","[3, 5]","We bought and finally got around to watching a movie last night that we have more than simply an entertainment interest in. The movie is Alleged and is a look at what is known as the Scopes Monkey Trial. This is the trial, back in 1925, in Tennessee that focused on the teaching of evolutionary theory in public schools. As Alleged shows, there is a lot more to the story than that! There are worldviews and motivations underlying this event that are rarely addressed, or at least addressed honestly and in a balanced way. Even the trial itself, famously portrayed in the movie Inherit The Wind, went quite differently in real life.Unlike a lot of privately produced films in the family friendly genre, Alleged has some heavy hitters in the cast. Most notable on this list are Fred Thompson, Colm Meaney (who has been in quite a few films but is best known to me as Chief O'Brien from Star Trek:TNG and Deep Space Nine!) and Brian Dennehy, all major film stars and solid actors. Because of this, the acting and production quality of this film is substantially higher than other films like Facing the Giants that target the same audience. The film is also less overtly religious although clearly the film is not only very family friendly, it is also sympathetic to people of faith. As part of the special features, the DVD includes a series of discussion questions making this a great film to watch and discuss with a church gathering, especially in a small group study or a youth setting since they are often on the front lines of the debate over evolution and creation.What was most interesting about this movie is that it looked at a crucial moment in American culture in a way that pushes through the cultural nostalgia of a principled defender of education and knowledge pitted against the hordes of uneducated religious fundamentalists. The reality is far more complex. For example, William Jennings Bryant was hardly a fire breathing fundamentalist, he didn't even hold to a six 24 hour day creationism. The newspaper reporters of the day were not nearly as noble as made out to be. Most importantly, the driving forces behind this event on the ""evolution side"" held to some terribly abhorrent views of human beings, views that are repugnant but also a natural result of an evolutionary worldview.Certainly Alleged is approaching this highly charged topic and event from a particular worldview but I didn't find that it beat you over the head with it. This wasn't a feature length film clamoring about six day creationism. What it seems to be setting out to do, and I think it accomplished, was to look more at the worldview of those on the defense team, defending Mr. Scopes from charges that may not have even been true, and doing so more to push a point rather than out of a sense of justice and fairness. Regardless this event from nearly 100 years ago is still a hot issue today in our culture, educational systems and the church. Alleged is a great way to look at a crucial topic while also being an entertaining film to watch with the entire family.",4,A thought provoking film for the entire family,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,3062,"['bought', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'more', 'simply', 'entertainment', 'interest', 'movie', 'Alleged', 'look', 'what', 'known', 'Scopes', 'Monkey', 'Trial', 'trial', 'back', '1925', 'Tennessee', 'focused', 'teaching', 'evolutionary', 'theory', 'public', 'schools', 'Alleged', 'shows', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'are', 'worldviews', 'motivations', 'underlying', 'event', 'are', 'rarely', 'addressed', 'least', 'addressed', 'honestly', 'balanced', 'way', 'Even', 'trial', 'famously', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Inherit', 'Wind', 'went', 'quite', 'differently', 'real', 'lot', 'privately', 'produced', 'films', 'family', 'friendly', 'genre', 'Alleged', 'heavy', 'hitters', 'cast', 'Most', 'notable', 'list', 'are', 'Fred', 'Thompson', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'who', 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'best', 'known', 'Chief', ""O'Brien"", 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'major', 'film', 'stars', 'solid', 'actors', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'film', 'substantially', 'higher', 'other', 'films', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'target', 'same', 'audience', 'film', 'also', 'less', 'overtly', 'religious', 'clearly', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'also', 'sympathetic', 'people', 'faith', 'part', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'series', 'discussion', 'questions', 'making', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'discuss', 'church', 'gathering', 'especially', 'small', 'group', 'study', 'youth', 'setting', 'are', 'often', 'front', 'lines', 'debate', 'evolution', 'creation.What', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'movie', 'looked', 'crucial', 'moment', 'American', 'culture', 'way', 'cultural', 'nostalgia', 'principled', 'defender', 'education', 'knowledge', 'pitted', 'hordes', 'uneducated', 'religious', 'fundamentalists', 'reality', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'example', 'William', 'Jennings', 'Bryant', 'was', 'hardly', 'fire', 'breathing', 'fundamentalist', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'hold', 'six', '24', 'hour', 'day', 'creationism', 'newspaper', 'reporters', 'day', 'were', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'noble', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Most', 'importantly', 'driving', 'forces', 'event', 'evolution', 'side', 'held', 'terribly', 'abhorrent', 'views', 'human', 'beings', 'views', 'are', 'repugnant', 'also', 'natural', 'result', 'evolutionary', 'worldview.Certainly', 'Alleged', 'approaching', 'highly', 'charged', 'topic', 'event', 'particular', 'worldview', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'beat', 'head', 'was', ""n't"", 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'clamoring', 'six', 'day', 'creationism', 'What', 'be', 'setting', 'out', 'do', 'think', 'accomplished', 'was', 'look', 'more', 'worldview', 'defense', 'team', 'defending', 'Mr.', 'Scopes', 'charges', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'true', 'doing', 'so', 'more', 'push', 'point', 'rather', 'sense', 'justice', 'fairness', 'Regardless', 'event', 'nearly', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'hot', 'issue', 'today', 'culture', 'educational', 'systems', 'church', 'Alleged', 'great', 'way', 'look', 'crucial', 'topic', 'also', 'being', 'entertaining', 'film', 'watch', 'entire', 'family']",N/A

1463506,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B005K1VQF2,C. Long,"[1, 2]","Let's start with the bottom-line of this movie: It's not grandly entertaining, but should hold your interest fine and has some worthwhile things to say that can be excellent discussion points.It's a mix of true and fictional. For instance, there's a whole subplot of a young reporter with his on, then off, then on-again fianc&eacute;, where he misleads people with his stories about the Scopes trial in order to try to be seen as successful in the world's eyes. To my knowledge this was a fictional part of the movie in the sense that it was written for the movie, although my guess is that there probably were such reporters at the time (that's just human nature). But several other parts of the trial itself seem to be grounded, at least partially, in true events.This movie makes a strong link between evolution and eugenics (which was very popular in some circles at this time) and portrays the problem with both, though they are both portrayed in rather simplistic terms. You don't get a grand defense of Creationism in this movie, but it does clearly showcase two different worldviews: an atheistic one where there is no God and thus He didn't create us but that we are rather the product of evolution, and the Biblical one where there is a God and He did create us. And the evolution side is the one showcased by the movie as being foolish (though again, not because of any grand defense of Creationism that the movie portrays - more just by the ""attitude""/""tone"" of the movie).It does showcase how the whole trial was started under very questionable pretenses and showcases that some testimony used was scripted, etc. It also lightly touches on the problems with some of the evolution ""evidence"" used such as ""Nebraska man"".This movie is a great family or small-groups movie with lots of worthwhile discussion topics brought forth by the movie's focus on evolution, eugenics, Creationism (for instance, a main character in the movie talks of how he doesn't believe it was a literal 6-day creation), the importance of the Bible - taking God at face value, lying/deceit, the problem with trying to please the ""world"" vs. how we should do what's right before God, difference in atheistic vs. Christian worldviews, etc. There's even a discussion guide included on the disc that gives some Bible verse references, etc. relating to a few of these discussion topics (mostly on the lying/deceit/personal integrity themes).Production quality was ""good enough"", but wasn't anything to get excited about - and actually the stylistic choice to try to make it look like the 1920's in the soft/hazy look and color tones, started to get to me a bit by about the half-way mark in the movie on the Blu-ray I watched (by the way, the Blu-ray quality was nothing to get too excited about - you could probably watch on DVD and not see much difference). The acting was fine - I must say I thought Fred Thompson did a pretty good job. I would generally put the overall quality level in the ""good made-for-t.v. movie"" type category.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",4,Could be a worthwhile family movie,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,3088,"['Let', 'start', 'bottom-line', 'movie', 'not', 'grandly', 'entertaining', 'should', 'hold', 'interest', 'fine', 'worthwhile', 'things', 'say', 'can', 'be', 'excellent', 'discussion', 'points.It', 'mix', 'true', 'fictional', 'instance', 'whole', 'subplot', 'young', 'reporter', 'then', 'then', 'on-again', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'where', 'people', 'stories', 'Scopes', 'trial', 'order', 'try', 'be', 'seen', 'successful', 'world', 'eyes', 'knowledge', 'was', 'fictional', 'part', 'movie', 'sense', 'was', 'written', 'movie', 'guess', 'probably', 'were', 'such', 'reporters', 'time', 'just', 'human', 'nature', 'several', 'other', 'parts', 'trial', 'seem', 'be', 'grounded', 'least', 'partially', 'true', 'events.This', 'movie', 'strong', 'link', 'evolution', 'eugenics', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'circles', 'time', 'problem', 'are', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'terms', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'grand', 'defense', 'Creationism', 'movie', 'clearly', 'showcase', 'two', 'different', 'worldviews', 'atheistic', 'one', 'where', 'God', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'are', 'rather', 'product', 'evolution', 'Biblical', 'one', 'where', 'God', 'did', 'create', 'evolution', 'side', 'one', 'showcased', 'movie', 'being', 'foolish', 'again', 'not', 'grand', 'defense', 'Creationism', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'attitude', '/', 'tone', 'movie', '.It', 'showcase', 'how', 'whole', 'trial', 'was', 'started', 'very', 'questionable', 'pretenses', 'showcases', 'testimony', 'used', 'was', 'scripted', 'etc', 'also', 'lightly', 'problems', 'evolution', 'evidence', 'used', 'such', 'Nebraska', 'man', '.This', 'movie', 'great', 'family', 'small-groups', 'movie', 'lots', 'worthwhile', 'discussion', 'topics', 'brought', 'forth', 'movie', 'focus', 'evolution', 'eugenics', 'Creationism', 'instance', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'talks', 'how', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'literal', '6-day', 'creation', 'importance', 'Bible', 'taking', 'God', 'face', 'value', 'lying/deceit', 'problem', 'trying', 'please', 'world', 'how', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'God', 'difference', 'atheistic', 'vs.', 'Christian', 'worldviews', 'etc', 'even', 'discussion', 'guide', 'included', 'disc', 'Bible', 'verse', 'references', 'etc', 'relating', 'few', 'discussion', 'topics', 'mostly', 'lying/deceit/personal', 'integrity', 'themes', '.Production', 'quality', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'get', 'excited', 'actually', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'try', 'make', 'look', '1920', 'soft/hazy', 'look', 'color', 'tones', 'started', 'get', 'bit', 'half-way', 'mark', 'movie', 'Blu-ray', 'watched', 'way', 'Blu-ray', 'quality', 'was', 'nothing', 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'could', 'probably', 'watch', 'DVD', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'must', 'say', 'thought', 'Fred', 'Thompson', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'would', 'generally', 'put', 'overall', 'quality', 'level', 'good', 'made-for-t.v', 'movie', 'type', 'category.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

A fun love story with great actors that incorporates a strong ""do the right thing"" message in a meaningful and relevant way.There are fictional lines in this historical setting, but they are reasonable for their context and they help keep the screenplay engaging and entertaining. They also flesh out the issues of that day including media bias, civil liberties, and eugenics. It is also refreshing to see the events surrounding the ""Monkey Trial"" presented in a more historically accurate way.What a great medium to discuss important yet complicated social issues! The ensuing discussions with my children are certain to be meaningful, with tangible examples of real-life questions and challenges.I originally purchased this film expecting to compare its historicity of it with that of ""Inherit the Wind."" It is no secret that the public perception of the Scopes trial was highly influenced by the media's portrayal and the play, RATHER than the facts of the case and the historical context. Although ""Inherit the Wind"" is an entertaining play (and screenplay), it gives a highly biased and blatantly incorrect account of the context and events surrounding the trial that has left most of the public with an incorrect perception...though a politically correct one.But instead of merely contrasting historicity, I was surprised and delighted to discover an entertaining and well-done film.Although the ""Monkey Trial"" is certainly the focal point of the movie, no doubt there is much more history that could be corrected...but how to do this in a short yet entertaining movie?",5,Great cast.

1463508,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B005K1VQF2,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[4, 5]","Yes, the setting for this movie is the Scopes Monkey Trial. Yes, it's taken from an anti-evolution viewpoint. I'll get to that later. In reality, though, this movie deals with a young man who has the apple of fame and fortune dangled in front of him, a prize that threatens to cost him his friends, fiance, and conscience.The focal point is Charles Anderson (Nathan West), a young reporter who wants to make it big-time like H. L. Menken (Colm Meaney). He gets the chance at the above mentioned trial, with Menken arriving. He learns, though, that some see journalism not as much as reporting the facts as influencing the reader.I've recently read John Truby's Anatomy of Story. This book does an excellent job of following his advice in the writing of the story. The acting is strong enough to make it as well, with West a great lead, Meaney a human villain and Ashley Johnson being doing a great job as the love interest. Fred Thompson and Brian Dennehy fill the shoes of the big names of the trial, William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow. Thompson did a fair job, and I'm a Dennehy fan, but in this rendition they're the supporting cast.This movie does have an agenda on the issue. There is no question it takes an anti-evolution stand. Note I did not say creationist, which most equate with a six day view -- It sites Bryan allowing for a long day interpretation. However, it does show some of the weakness in evolutionary evidence (effectively with Darrow questioning ""witnesses"" for evolution). It also shows the tie in between evolution and eugenics/forced sterilization, which I've noted in a novel dealing with the creation/evolution debate (The Shadowed Mind by Julie Cave).That being said, the only person who may be considered villainized is Menken. Darrow here is a good antagonist, one you root against but also has some redemptive qualities. Scopes is seen more as the innocent bystander that gets hit by the train. Bryan is showed very favorably, ignoring some of his weaknesses such as racism, but the reality is that Bryan was beloved and respected and while losing three elections himself also had a hand in the election and re-election of Woodrow Wilson.On this video is a discussion guide, dealing with six or seven topics for a discussion of a church or home group.

1463509,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005K1VQF2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 22]","As the first release of the faith based film label Slingshot Pictures, ""Alleged"" certainly tackles one of the largest subjects imaginable.  In 1925, the Scopes ""Monkey Trial"" (famously depicted in Inherit the Wind) unfolded in a small Tennessee town and debated whether evolution should be allowed to be taught in public schools.  A massive confrontation that pitted science against theology and two of the most famed orators/lawyers of the period (Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan) against one another, the case was branded as ""The Trial of the Century.""  I, for one, think it's an inspired idea to revisit the Scopes Trial from a modern vantage point as the play ""Inherit the Wind"" was written in 1955 and didn't really evoke all of the complexities inherent in the situation.  But while ""Alleged"" does offer some insight into the background of this notorious event, it really doesn't attempt to be a definitive and comprehensive study of it either.  The movie really centers on an ambitious local reporter who faces difficult decisions about his values and principles when pressed by an unscrupulous editor.Likable Nathan West plays our intrepid young reporter, and Ashley Johnson is his equally appealing gal pal.  As the Scopes trial is being engineered by local dignitaries to bring tourism and prosperity to the dying town, West also sees it as an opportunity to achieve big city success and notoriety.  But at what cost?  When Brian Dennehy (as Darrow) and Fred Dalton Thompson (as Jennings Bryan) square off, Colm Meaney (as Baltimore Sun editor H.L. Mencken) pushes him to dish the dirt for maximum provocation.  But being enticed to the dark side has its price, and right wills out every time.  The film lacks a bit of subtlety as Meaney is practically evil incarnate and the lead actors are too sweet and modernly sensible to be awarded anything but a happy ending.  The film throws in a haphazard sideplot about eugenics and forced sterilization that happens to be dramatically and conveniently timed for maximum impact.  It is just one of many important topics that take a backseat to the central gentle love story.""Alleged"" is certainly at its most effective when the trial is front and center.  Dennehy and Dalton Thompson are a pleasure and their interactions with one another bring a livelihood to the proceedings.  This being a family film, however, it paints a rather pretty picture of our past.  Although racism is mentioned, no one in this little town seems the least bit prejudiced.  Johnson's sister, in fact, is half black and there is relatively no reaction to that whatsoever (except by the evil character).  Even though a certain character is slated for sterilization (as was common practice), a last minute injunction saves the day.  Whew!  Difficult topic over, never to be mentioned again.  Few things can be more incendiary or heated than evolutionary debate, but most of the actual townsfolk don't seem to have an opinion one way or another.  It's like they're gathering for an ice cream social.Again, ""Alleged"" hints at a lot of topics without digging too deep.  As an introduction, it's fine--but at 90 minutes (and most of that devoted to young lovers), important issues are given short shrift.  The Special Features of the DVD include a Discussion Guide to be utilized in possible church or school settings.  So that kind of gears you toward the targeted audience for the film and its intentions.  It's all gently likable without being too challenging.  I enjoyed the movie, but I still think there is a great film yet to be made that really digs into the Scopes trial in a relevant way.  For my taste, the film rates about 3 1/2 stars for pleasantness.  A good introduction, but strictly family fare--I'll round up for good intentions.

1463510,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005K1VQF2,Mark Turner,"[5, 7]","It seems that the knowledge people have these days comes from the easiest source and that more often than not is the television. The sales of newspapers are down and it seems the art of discussion is rare these days. Fortunately the internet has changed some of this but even there a ton of misinformation can be found. So imagine what it must have been like years ago when the only source of information was the newspaper.That's the basis of the story found in ALLEGED, a different takes than we've witnessed before concerning the Scopes monkey trial. For years the only way to learn about this trail was through the film INHERIT THE WIND. I've always loved that film, in particular the acting done by both Spencer Tracy and Frederick March. But that movie made it seem as if the trial was the result of the people's wills often depicting anyone who was religious as fanatical.This time around we have a different story. Instead of the trial being brought about by a teacher who has a fire burning inside of him to teach students about Darwin we instead have a town that's slowly fading that needs a hook to get folks into town again. They recruit the local science teacher into saying he believes in Darwin so that they can get people riled up about the question of creationism versus evolution.Pulled into the midst of this whole circus is Charles Anderson (Nathan West), a reporter for the local newspaper whose father was the owner years ago. He wants to move on to better things, to the big city where he can achieve fame like his idol, H.L.Menken (Colm Meaney). Menken was the leading journalist of his time and one of the most read. Getting him involved means more folks hearing about the town and then coming for the trial.To make it an even bigger event, the townsfolk get the best speaker they can find for the prosecution, Williams Jenning Bryan (Fred Dalton Thompson). Bryan has already decried the idea of evolutionism and the trial seems like a slam dunk. But then Menken and his paper bring in noted lawyer Clarence Darrow (Brian Dennehy) for the defense. What seemed like a slam dunk is now a case that will be viewed and used across the country.In the middle of it all is the story of Charles. He becomes caught up in the spectacle of the entire situation more interested in impressing Menken than in reporting facts. And while hanging around with Menken he is tutored in the art of twisting a phrase or creating a story where none exist. This was the state of journalism at that time and is represented much more here than in INHERIT. Charles becomes so invested in the lines and way of life Menken presents him that he nearly loses the most important thing in his life, his fianc&eacute; Rose (Ashley Johnson). It isn't until a crisis slaps Charles in the face where he must decide to either tell the truth or become a part of the bigger world where truth is not told but created.The movie is well made but appears to settle into the made for TV format in feel and appearance. This movie would not have made much released to the box office. But it does offer a nice evening's entertainment as well as offer a new look at an old story.It also has the ability to make you think differently when looking at the news. How much of what we are told these days is the truth and how much of it is twisted to suit the needs of those in charge of dispensing the news? Many claim that FOX is little more than this but the fact of the matter is that in these days EVERY news network has their own agenda when it comes to the news they disseminate. It is rare to find the absolute truth without digging deeper to find it.Perhaps it is this reason that more people are turning away from the major news networks we all grew up watching and trusting. Too many fake stories, too many stories that turned out to be twisted and too many stories that were ignored to support one side or the other. I think that's a good thing. People need to look deeper than the surface no matter what the outcome. And with movies like this at least getting made, perhaps more people will take the time to do so.",3,PERFECT TIMING,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4096,"['knowledge', 'people', 'have', 'days', 'easiest', 'source', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'television', 'sales', 'newspapers', 'are', 'down', 'art', 'discussion', 'rare', 'days', 'Fortunately', 'internet', 'changed', 'even', 'ton', 'misinformation', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'So', 'imagine', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'only', 'source', 'information', 'was', 'newspaper.That', 'basis', 'story', 'found', 'ALLEGED', 'different', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'concerning', 'Scopes', 'monkey', 'trial', 'years', 'only', 'way', 'learn', 'trail', 'was', 'film', 'INHERIT', 'THE', 'WIND', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'film', 'particular', 'acting', 'done', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Frederick', 'March', 'movie', 'made', 'seem', 'trial', 'was', 'result', 'people', 'wills', 'often', 'depicting', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'religious', 'fanatical.This', 'time', 'have', 'different', 'story', 'Instead', 'trial', 'being', 'brought', 'teacher', 'who', 'fire', 'burning', 'teach', 'students', 'Darwin', 'instead', 'have', 'town', 'slowly', 'fading', 'hook', 'get', 'folks', 'town', 'again', 'recruit', 'local', 'science', 'teacher', 'saying', 'Darwin', 'can', 'get', 'people', 'riled', 'up', 'question', 'creationism', 'versus', 'evolution.Pulled', 'midst', 'whole', 'circus', 'Charles', 'Anderson', 'Nathan', 'West', 'reporter', 'local', 'newspaper', 'father', 'was', 'owner', 'years', 'ago', 'move', 'better', 'things', 'big', 'city', 'where', 'can', 'achieve', 'fame', 'idol', 'H.L.Menken', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Menken', 'was', 'leading', 'journalist', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'read', 'Getting', 'involved', 'more', 'folks', 'hearing', 'town', 'then', 'coming', 'trial.To', 'make', 'even', 'bigger', 'event', 'townsfolk', 'get', 'best', 'speaker', 'can', 'find', 'prosecution', 'Williams', 'Jenning', 'Bryan', 'Fred', 'Dalton', 'Thompson', 'Bryan', 'already', 'decried', 'idea', 'evolutionism', 'trial', 'slam', 'dunk', 'then', 'Menken', 'paper', 'bring', 'noted', 'lawyer', 'Clarence', 'Darrow', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'defense', 'What', 'seemed', 'slam', 'dunk', 'now', 'case', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'used', 'country.In', 'middle', 'story', 'Charles', 'caught', 'up', 'spectacle', 'entire', 'situation', 'more', 'interested', 'impressing', 'Menken', 'reporting', 'facts', 'hanging', 'around', 'Menken', 'tutored', 'art', 'twisting', 'phrase', 'creating', 'story', 'where', 'none', 'exist', 'was', 'state', 'journalism', 'time', 'represented', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'INHERIT', 'Charles', 'so', 'invested', 'lines', 'way', 'life', 'Menken', 'nearly', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Rose', 'Ashley', 'Johnson', ""n't"", 'crisis', 'slaps', 'Charles', 'face', 'where', 'must', 'decide', 'tell', 'truth', 'become', 'part', 'bigger', 'world', 'where', 'truth', 'not', 'told', 'created.The', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'settle', 'made', 'TV', 'format', 'feel', 'appearance', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'released', 'box', 'office', 'offer', 'nice', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'as', 'well', 'offer', 'new', 'look', 'old', 'story.It', 'also', 'ability', 'make', 'think', 'differently', 'when', 'looking', 'news', 'How', 'much', 'what', 'are', 'told', 'days', 'truth', 'how', 'much', 'twisted', 'suit', 'needs', 'charge', 'dispensing', 'news', 'Many', 'claim', 'FOX', 'little', 'more', 'fact', 'matter', 'days', 'EVERY', 'news', 'network', 'own', 'agenda', 'when', 'news', 'disseminate', 'rare', 'find', 'absolute', 'truth', 'digging', 'deeper', 'find', 'it.Perhaps', 'reason', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'turning', 'away', 'major', 'news', 'networks', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'trusting', 'Too', 'many', 'fake', 'stories', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'twisted', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'were', 'ignored', 'support', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'People', 'need', 'look', 'deeper', 'surface', 'matter', 'what', 'outcome', 'movies', 'least', 'getting', 'made', 'perhaps', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'do', 'so']",N/A
