882216,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B0007LPS0Y,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[1, 2]","The concert portion of this dvd was filmed at the ""Omni"" in Atlanta, before a packed crowd. The documentary portion was filmed at one of his ranches in Montanna and at his farm in Tenneesee. Hank Jr. and his band perform outstanding before this packed Atlanta crowd. It begins with his band being on stage, then he walks onto the stage and starts performing ""My name is Bocephus"". He performs some songs with his band and some without his band. His band is very impressive, you get ""Animal"" playing a big red double necked guitar,saxaphone players, Steel guitar, drums, and bass guitar. His classic hits are performed. Some highlights include ""Young Country""- ""ole Hank would be proud and Elvis would too"". Others include ""Born to Boogie"", ""Family Tradition"", and a ""Country Boy can Survive"". Also, he performs a ""fun song"" near the beginning portion of his concert which is ""Buck Naked"". I didn't realize he could be so humorus.It's really funny. He's a great entertainer.The concert ends with the performance of ""If the South Would Have Won, We'd had it Made"". This is very upbeat. The entire band is at their best! He sings the song to ""Ronnie Van Zant"" - ""Ronnie, we'd had it made in the Shade"". ""Made in the Shade"" was a Ronnie Van Zant song. In the song he declares that everyday would be ""Fat Tuesday"", and the band switches to a mardi gras beat, as Hank holds an Umbrella and does the New Orleans Mardi Gras Strut. He would put Hank Williams picture on $100 bills, and the day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday, and the day young Skynyrd died, you don't know how much we cried. The performance is outstanding. During the song, he mentions something good about every southern state. Outstanding!!!!  The documentary portion shows a very mature, very sober, and very responsible businessman - Hank Jr. You get to see him on one of his ranches in Motanna, taking care of chores, and then at a BBQ at his farm in Tenneesee. Merle Kilgore from the old ""Louisian Hayride"" is in the documentaty. The documentary is not separate from the concert. The documentary and concert are mingled together. Sometimes it seems the documentary portion drags on too long, especially after the performance of an excellent song. I wish the two portions were more separated. Overall, it is an excellent Dvd, well worth the inconvience of the mixed portions.",4,"Hank Williams Jr. ""Full Access""",1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2355,"['concert', 'portion', 'dvd', 'was', 'filmed', 'Omni', 'Atlanta', 'packed', 'crowd', 'documentary', 'portion', 'was', 'filmed', 'one', 'ranches', 'Montanna', 'farm', 'Tenneesee', 'Hank', 'Jr.', 'band', 'perform', 'outstanding', 'packed', 'Atlanta', 'crowd', 'band', 'being', 'stage', 'then', 'stage', 'performing', 'name', 'Bocephus', 'songs', 'band', 'band', 'band', 'very', 'impressive', 'get', 'Animal', 'playing', 'big', 'red', 'double', 'necked', 'guitar', 'saxaphone', 'players', 'Steel', 'guitar', 'drums', 'bass', 'guitar', 'classic', 'hits', 'are', 'performed', 'highlights', 'include', 'Young', 'Country', 'ole', 'Hank', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'Elvis', 'would', 'too', 'Others', 'include', 'Born', 'Boogie', 'Family', 'Tradition', 'Country', 'Boy', 'can', 'Survive', 'Also', 'fun', 'song', 'beginning', 'portion', 'concert', 'Buck', 'Naked', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'humorus.It', 'really', 'funny', 'great', 'entertainer.The', 'concert', 'performance', 'South', 'Would', 'Have', 'Won', ""'d"", 'had', 'Made', 'very', 'upbeat', 'entire', 'band', 'best', 'song', 'Ronnie', 'Van', 'Zant', 'Ronnie', ""'d"", 'had', 'made', 'Shade', 'Made', 'Shade', 'was', 'Ronnie', 'Van', 'Zant', 'song', 'song', 'everyday', 'would', 'be', 'Fat', 'Tuesday', 'band', 'mardi', 'gras', 'beat', 'Hank', 'Umbrella', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'Strut', 'would', 'put', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'picture', '100', 'bills', 'day', 'Elvis', 'passed', 'away', 'would', 'be', 'national', 'holiday', 'day', 'young', 'Skynyrd', 'died', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'cried', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'song', 'something', 'good', 'southern', 'state', 'Outstanding', 'documentary', 'portion', 'very', 'mature', 'very', 'sober', 'very', 'responsible', 'businessman', 'Hank', 'Jr.', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'ranches', 'Motanna', 'taking', 'care', 'chores', 'then', 'BBQ', 'farm', 'Tenneesee', 'Merle', 'Kilgore', 'old', 'Louisian', 'Hayride', 'documentaty', 'documentary', 'not', 'separate', 'concert', 'documentary', 'concert', 'are', 'mingled', 'together', 'Sometimes', 'documentary', 'portion', 'drags', 'too', 'long', 'especially', 'performance', 'excellent', 'song', 'wish', 'two', 'portions', 'were', 'more', 'separated', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'Dvd', 'well', 'inconvience', 'mixed', 'portions']",N/A
