981289,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B000F1IO3E,A. Hickman,"[19, 25]","Asia Argenta's ""Heart"" is from the grand guignol school of film making.  She deserves credit for attempting to film J.T. LeRoy's cult novel, and her own performance, along with those of the boys who play Jeremiah, is indeed brave, but I am disappointed by the result.  To begin with, the story arc of the novel is lost.  We are simply thrust into Jeremiah's sick world without any sense of context.  Given the fact that this ""true"" story is anything but, perhaps Argenta was right to leave out the frame story of teenage Jeremiah's penchant for S&M, but others of the stories are missing as well.  That the focus has shifted from Jeremiah to Sarah is not so much an indictment of Argenta's own ego as it is a tribute to her failure to deal with some of the more unsavory aspects of the orginal story.  Finally, the packaging of the DVD demands some comment.  Apparently, a lot of celebrities and others who were duped by the LeRoy saga are now saying they were entertained by the hoax.  So be it.  But it's unconscionable of the producers to exploit that fact as a marketing ploy.  To sum up, this is not a bad movie, but it represents an opportunity lost.

But that doesn't mean that the imagination that created him didn't conjure up a fascinating wealth of material that a talented auteur couldn't turn into a trippy, dark and entertaining film.I had never heard of Asia Argento before seeing this film, but she is clearly a talented director and actress. As a director, she manages to make the tale of an abused and exploited young boy both disturbing and entertaining. She does this by keeping the tone of the film trippy and surreal, as opposed to gritty and realistic, which suits the bizarre life that Jeremiah's punk/hooker/stripper/drug-addict mother drags him into. As an actress, Argento is also impressive: she portrays Sarah as a wild, damaged, fearless mess, who occasionally, with her husky voice and brash sexuality, bears a creepy resemblance to Courtney Love.Although Argento's performance carries the film, all three of the child actors who portray Jeremiah are excellent.

I appreciated that the disturbing scenes were mostly left up to your imagination and there was very little violence or ""gore"". The subject matter was not pleasant, but neither is life sometimes.

981298,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000F1IO3E,Grady Harp,"[5, 8]","J.T. LeRoy or Laura Albert or whoever wrote the collection of stories that created Jeremiah would probably take umbrage with Screenwriter/Director Asia Argento for turning Jeremiah's life of abuse and angst into a biography of Sarah, the mother who gave birth to Jeremiah at age 14 only to relinquish him to foster homes while she lead her life as a truck stop lizard and drug addict.  While Asia Argento has impressive credentials as both actress and filmmaker in Italy, her on screen performance in this self-directed film is excessively focused on her and leaves the child of the stories as a mere sidebar.Much of the story line that ran through the book has been abandoned, probably due to the fact that few child actors could be asked to enact the bizarre and distorted things that Jeremiah did.  Gone is the cross-dressing, the prostitution, and much of the other behavioral defects that peppered the pages of the novel.  Instead we see a child claimed from a satisfactory foster home by a mother who jumps from one abusive lover to the next, leaving Jeremiah to fend for himself by eating out of garbage cans, living in slums and being at the beck and call of Sarah's consistently disgusting paramours.  When Jeremiah is raped by one of Sarah's men he is sent to live with his crazed Bible belt grandparents where he is brainwashed into a zealot along with his cousins.  He eventually is 're-rescued' by Sarah and once again the pointless existence presses on.  There is no ending as there were/are further books to come.Asia Argento creates a fairly one-dimensional portrait of Sarah, that of a wasted bit of scum obedient only to her libido and drug needs.  Yes, she fled from her parent's religious suffocation, but other than that we have no insight as to her behavior.  The boys who portray Jeremiah (Jimmy Bennett, Cole and Dylan Sprouse) are just a bit too scrubbed and proper for the role and again we see little in the way of depth of character as Argento adapted the book.  There are very brief bit parts by a number of fine actors (one wonders why they wanted to do this) such as Kip Pardue (as buff as you'll ever see him!), Winona Ryder, Michael Pitt, Peter Fonda, Marilyn Mason, Ben Foster, Jeremy Renner, and Jeremy Sisto but their appearances are strong despite the fleeting seconds in which they inhabit the screen.The 'form follows function' rule certainly applies here: the story is shot is choppy, rancid colored, disorienting pieces that follow the style of the storytelling.  The music is, well, loud and for the most part covers the dialogue (not always a bad thing).  This is an 'art film' and one that takes patience to endure, but considering the great hoopla that accompanied the discovery of the 'J.T LeRoy' scandal, it probably merits watching.  For this viewer the film should have just been called 'Sarah - a tour de force for Asia Argento'. Incidental information: the opening of the DVD is a multi-actor plea for support for ONE.org, a group of actors speaking out against poverty.  It proves to be the most inspiring part of the disc!

981300,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B000F1IO3E,Jessica Lux,"[53, 59]","Note to consumers:  The original release of this DVD contains an authoring error, resulting in an abrupt jump that bypasses the ""explosion"" scene (which can be seen in the previews).  Palm Pictures has been very responsive to email requests for replacement versions of the DVD, and if you purchased a defective item, you should contact them via their web site.J.T. Leroy's ""true"" life tale about a teenaged truck stop prostitute and her son was first told in a collection of short stories by the same name.  The movie follows the early years of Jeremiah, a boy who experiences child rape, has gender confusion, lives as a scavenger, is brainwashed by evangelical Christians, and experiences a revolving door of his mother's boyfriends and tricks.  The big screen version follows the written version closely; however, I highly recommend that viewers also pick up a copy of the book (and Leroy's earlier work Sarah) to answer any questions about the backstory, the red bird metaphor, the story of Sarah's own youth, the inner strength of Jeremiah, and more.Director/Actor Asia Argento is brilliant, pure and simple.  She portays child rape and the harrowing seduction of a grown man (Marilyn Manson) by a teenaged boy in drag with artistic genius.  Viewers don't need to see the ""monster"" in full light, and their imagination of the rest of the scene is far more disturbing.  As an actor, she portrays Sarah as a chameleon who shifts from a drop-dead looker to a trashy stripper to a drug-addicted junkie to a loving mother to a hateful creep in mere minutes (and then shifts back again).  She is both drop-dead gorgeous and completely hideous.  Three young actors portray Jeremiah as a stoic boy who grows up in this chaotic environment, and all of them are excellent.Some reviewers find this movie depressing, and I couldn't disagree more.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  This movie is what you make of it.  Viewers can easily find a commentary of the child welfare system, insight into the results of a repressed childhood, social commentary on hypocrisy, and insight into the scarring effects of child abuse if they scratch beneath the surface.  It's no pick-me-up, but this is in no way the most horrific film I've ever seen (try Baise Moi or Irreversible for that).  It's also not an exploitation film by any means.  It is brutally honest about events and situations which go on every day in America.Is the story a hoax?  Once again, the authenticity of the movie is open to interpretation.  J.T. Leroy has been exposed as the pen name for a woman who was never a truck-stop prostitute, which recasts the short story collection as a work of fiction instead of non-fiction.  Literary magazines and critics have engaged in a never-ending debate about the hoax (especially in the light of the James Frey controversy).  The primary criticism is that the story loses its authenticity--how can the reader/viewer trust the insight to such sensitive topics if the author never experienced them?  For a play-by-play of the backlash and controversy about Leroy's identity, refer to the Wikipedia article on the subject.The Palm Pictures promotional web site has embraced the controversy in a fun way, which is how I encourage consumers to view it.  Yes, the story is larger-than-life.  On the other hand, it is far from the outrageous film every made.  I truly believe that the statement made by the film is a strong one that is undiluted by the author's credibility with personal experience.  (Hoaxes like Go Ask Alice, with its socio-political agenda, are far more dangerous than this story.)Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Watch this movie with an open mind and look beneath the surface.  Develop your own opinions about the news that the story is actually a work of fiction.",5,"Which is worse: Drug-addicted mom?

981301,A3R906AZJ9VANS,B000F1IO3E,John Black,"[0, 0]","There is a very noticeable continuance error about five minutes into the film, it is not really a big problem just very noticeable. Sarah is sitting on the couch wearing a tee-shirt and panties. When she first sits down the tail of her shirt stops at her waist and her legs are spread apart fully exposing her panties. The scene switched briefly to Jeremiah then back to Sarah, she has not changed the way she is sitting but her tee-shirt is now stretched out over her left knee. After another quick switch to Jeremiah and back to Sarah she is still sitting in the same position, but her shirt tail is back off of her knee, but she now has her hand pulling down the center of her shirt tail over the front of her panties. The camera zooms in a little each time it switches back to Sarah therefore showing less of her panties but I do not consider that a continuance error, only the moving shirt tail.A bigger problem for me was that I could not understand all lines of dialog in the movie. I think it was intentional for Jeremiah to mumble from time to time, both while played by Bennett and by the Sprouse twins, but I would still like to know what he was saying. If the DVD had either closed captions or subtitles it would not be as big a problem, however, the DVD has neither closed captions nor subtitles.But my biggest problem with this movie comes from a what I believe was a reliance by the screenplay writer and director (Asia Argento) on the audience having already read the books.I never read the books, nor did I even read a summary or review of them before purchasing this DVD. I did hear the news stories of the hoax when it was discovered that J.T. LeRoy never existed, however, since I had never before then heard of him or his books, I quickly forgot about the story. I did not realize that this movie was related to that hoax and remember the news story until I watched the extras on the DVD.The first part of the movie (while Jimmy Bennett is playing Jeremiah) is easy enough to follow, and to a large extent is the most emotional part of the movie. The emotion coming mainly from the empathy the viewers have for the innocent seven year old boy while watching what he is going through. From what I have read since watching the movie, this section of the movie covers about two years. The passage of that much time is not clear from just watching the movie.After the Sprouse twins assume the role of Jeremiah the relationship between Jeremiah and his mother changes and this is where the movie does not get the full story across. I can not really explain it but somehow the new relationship does not come across on an emotional level. The commentary track on the DVD fills in some of the blanks, but that is not the same.One other thing worth noting, despite the subject matter of the movie, no sex, abuse nor nudity by the actors is shown in the movie. There is a brief shot of a wall papered with cutouts from an adult magazines but even most of these pictures did not show full nudity. Asia Argento pushes the limit on how close she can come to being nude without technically being nude, but is never actually seen nude. When Jeremiah is being abused, both physically and sexually, and even when the doctors stitch up the damage from the sexual abuse, the movie switches to imagery of red crows to signify the abuse. I rather liked the red crow imagery, however, I felt that the movie may have used the imagery to be a little over conservative in what was actually shown.There is also a sequence where Jeremiah (played by one of the Sprouse twins) dresses like his mother and pretends to be his mother. In the early part of this sequence when Jeremiah looks in the mirror he sees his mother (the reflection is Asia). This I considered good imagery, however as the sequence continues Asia takes over the roll of Jeremiah. I felt it would have been better to have one of the Sprouse twins continue with the sequence and just use Asia as the mirror image he sees.",3,"Fast moving, heartbreaking yet interesting, but also disappointing in some aspects",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,3981,"['very', 'noticeable', 'continuance', 'error', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'big', 'problem', 'just', 'very', 'noticeable', 'Sarah', 'sitting', 'couch', 'wearing', 'tee-shirt', 'panties', 'When', 'first', 'down', 'tail', 'shirt', 'stops', 'waist', 'legs', 'are', 'spread', 'apart', 'fully', 'exposing', 'panties', 'scene', 'switched', 'briefly', 'Jeremiah', 'then', 'back', 'Sarah', 'not', 'changed', 'way', 'sitting', 'tee-shirt', 'now', 'stretched', 'out', 'left', 'knee', 'quick', 'switch', 'Jeremiah', 'back', 'Sarah', 'still', 'sitting', 'same', 'position', 'shirt', 'tail', 'back', 'knee', 'now', 'hand', 'pulling', 'down', 'center', 'shirt', 'tail', 'front', 'panties', 'camera', 'little', 'time', 'back', 'Sarah', 'therefore', 'showing', 'less', 'panties', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'continuance', 'error', 'only', 'moving', 'shirt', 'tail.A', 'bigger', 'problem', 'was', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'lines', 'dialog', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'intentional', 'Jeremiah', 'mumble', 'time', 'time', 'played', 'Bennett', 'Sprouse', 'twins', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'DVD', 'had', 'closed', 'captions', 'subtitles', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'big', 'problem', 'however', 'DVD', 'closed', 'captions', 'subtitles.But', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'what', 'believe', 'was', 'reliance', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'director', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'audience', 'having', 'already', 'read', 'books.I', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'did', 'even', 'read', 'summary', 'review', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'did', 'hear', 'news', 'stories', 'hoax', 'when', 'was', 'discovered', 'J.T', 'LeRoy', 'never', 'existed', 'however', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'then', 'heard', 'books', 'quickly', 'forgot', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'movie', 'was', 'related', 'hoax', 'remember', 'news', 'story', 'watched', 'extras', 'DVD.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'playing', 'Jeremiah', 'easy', 'enough', 'follow', 'large', 'extent', 'most', 'emotional', 'part', 'movie', 'emotion', 'coming', 'mainly', 'empathy', 'viewers', 'have', 'innocent', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'watching', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'watching', 'movie', 'section', 'movie', 'two', 'years', 'passage', 'much', 'time', 'not', 'clear', 'just', 'watching', 'movie.After', 'Sprouse', 'assume', 'role', 'Jeremiah', 'relationship', 'Jeremiah', 'mother', 'changes', 'where', 'movie', 'not', 'get', 'full', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'explain', 'new', 'relationship', 'not', 'come', 'emotional', 'level', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'fills', 'blanks', 'not', 'same.One', 'other', 'thing', 'noting', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'sex', 'nudity', 'actors', 'shown', 'movie', 'brief', 'shot', 'wall', 'papered', 'cutouts', 'adult', 'magazines', 'even', 'most', 'pictures', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'full', 'nudity', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'limit', 'how', 'close', 'can', 'come', 'being', 'nude', 'technically', 'being', 'nude', 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'nude', 'When', 'Jeremiah', 'being', 'abused', 'physically', 'sexually', 'even', 'when', 'doctors', 'stitch', 'up', 'damage', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'movie', 'imagery', 'red', 'crows', 'signify', 'abuse', 'rather', 'liked', 'red', 'crow', 'imagery', 'however', 'felt', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'used', 'imagery', 'be', 'little', 'over', 'conservative', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'shown.There', 'also', 'sequence', 'where', 'Jeremiah', 'played', 'one', 'Sprouse', 'twins', 'mother', 'pretends', 'be', 'mother', 'early', 'part', 'sequence', 'when', 'Jeremiah', 'mirror', 'mother', 'reflection', 'Asia', 'considered', 'good', 'imagery', 'however', 'sequence', 'Asia', 'roll', 'Jeremiah', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'one', 'Sprouse', 'twins', 'continue', 'sequence', 'just', 'use', 'Asia', 'mirror', 'image']",The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things
981302,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000F1IO3E,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 7]","""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things"" is based on a novel by JT Leroy and is co-written and directed by Asia Argento, daughter of Dario Argento.I'd never heard of the book, I've never heard of JT Leroy...But what I've gathered was, Leroy published this novel as a memoir only to reveal years later that it's fictional. Well, good things it's fictional because this movie is several kinds of screwed up. Very few times have I had a hard time watching a film, but this is one of those movies. It's very effective, very disturbing, very well acted, and, somehow, very entertaining. Asia Argento (who was Vin Diesel's love interest in ""XXX"") stars as Sarah, a drugged out cliche for the term ""white trash"". Sarah had a son when she was 15, the son has lived with foster parents and she finally gets custody of the child. The child is Jeremiah (who's played by Jimmy Bennet, Cole Sprouse, & Dylan Sprouse).Jeremiah is quiet, his lack of dialogue is huge throughout the movie, but he is frequently subjected to abuse and neglect at both the hands of his mother and her various boyfriends. When he's molested by one of her boyfriends (Jeremy Renner, who played Jeffrey Dahmer in ""Dahmer""), he is sent to live with his grandparents. Turns out this little group of religious fanatics aren't much better than Sarah, in fact the abuse factor gets worse here. Grandfather is played by Peter Fonda who is marvelously sadistic. But, anyways, after living with the grandparents for three years...Sarah returns to get the boy back and she's not in much better shape than she was originally. There's not much more to say about the plot, except a makeup-less Marilyn Manson turns up as Jackson, another boyfriend, and is onscreen for only a few moments but actually proves his chops as an actor (something ""Party Monster"" hardly gave him the chance to do). The movie has a great cast that ranges from Michael Pitt (The Village, The Dreamers), Jeremy Sisto (May, Thirteen), Kip Pardue (Thirteen), and even at one point a chick I would swear is Winona Ryder but apparently isn't. Anyway, despite that this movie is fictional (as I said) it is extremely effective. The movie covers grounds on abuse that few books would go over. It's not for everybody, but if you're looking for an intense and dark film...It's right here.GRADE: A-",5,Haunting,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2314,"['Heart', 'Deceitful', 'Above', 'All', 'Things', 'based', 'novel', 'JT', 'Leroy', 'co-written', 'directed', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'daughter', 'Dario', 'Argento.I', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'book', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'JT', 'Leroy', 'what', ""'ve"", 'gathered', 'was', 'Leroy', 'published', 'novel', 'memoir', 'only', 'reveal', 'years', 'later', 'fictional', 'Well', 'good', 'things', 'fictional', 'movie', 'several', 'kinds', 'screwed', 'up', 'Very', 'few', 'times', 'have', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'movies', 'very', 'effective', 'very', 'disturbing', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'somehow', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'who', 'was', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'love', 'interest', 'XXX', 'Sarah', 'drugged', 'out', 'cliche', 'term', 'white', 'trash', 'Sarah', 'had', 'son', 'when', 'was', '15', 'son', 'lived', 'foster', 'parents', 'finally', 'custody', 'child', 'child', 'Jeremiah', 'who', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Bennet', 'Cole', 'Sprouse', 'Dylan', 'Sprouse', '.Jeremiah', 'quiet', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'huge', 'movie', 'frequently', 'subjected', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'hands', 'mother', 'various', 'boyfriends', 'When', 'molested', 'one', 'boyfriends', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'Dahmer', 'sent', 'live', 'grandparents', 'out', 'little', 'group', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'Sarah', 'fact', 'abuse', 'factor', 'worse', 'here', 'Grandfather', 'played', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'who', 'marvelously', 'sadistic', 'anyways', 'living', 'grandparents', 'three', 'years', 'Sarah', 'get', 'boy', 'back', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'shape', 'was', 'originally', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'plot', 'makeup-less', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'up', 'Jackson', 'boyfriend', 'onscreen', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'actually', 'chops', 'actor', 'something', 'Party', 'Monster', 'hardly', 'gave', 'chance', 'do', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Village', 'Dreamers', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'May', 'Thirteen', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'Thirteen', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'chick', 'would', 'swear', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'Anyway', 'movie', 'fictional', 'said', 'extremely', 'effective', 'movie', 'grounds', 'abuse', 'few', 'books', 'would', 'go', 'not', 'everybody', ""'re"", 'looking', 'intense', 'dark', 'film', 'right', 'here.GRADE', 'A-']",The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things

If your one of them, than you'll never appreaciate this movie. This is an indy flick, low budget, cult classic. The acting and directing is amazing, and the story is fabulous. Even the soundtrack (Subhumans, Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, Sex Pistols) is great. The actors, Peter Fonda, Asia Argento, Marilyn Manson, Jeremey Sisto, Michael Pitt, and Winona Ryder are all verry good in this movie. If you know good movies, than you'll love this film. If your amongst the silly ones who only watched this movie because Marilyn Manson is in it, than your wasting your time...go watch Ghost Rider instead.",5,Either you get it or you don't.,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,868,"['people', 'are', 'complaining', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'movie', 'em', 'face', 'are', 'probably', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'excited', 'when', 'Ben', 'Affeleck', 'new', 'movie', 'out', 'blockbuster', 'mega', 'studio', 'production', 'movie', 'can', 'attend', 'one', ""'ll"", 'never', 'appreaciate', 'movie', 'indy', 'flick', 'low', 'budget', 'cult', 'classic', 'acting', 'directing', 'amazing', 'story', 'fabulous', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'Subhumans', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'great', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'Jeremey', 'Sisto', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'are', 'verry', 'good', 'movie', 'know', 'good', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', 'amongst', 'silly', 'ones', 'who', 'only', 'watched', 'movie', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'wasting', 'time', 'go', 'watch', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'instead']",The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things

It sounded like it had a really good plot, so I ordered it. It was a really good and interesting movie that dealt with drug addiction, child abuse, and child rape! I probably wouldn't recommend that you watch this with your parents. A drug-addict/hooker named Sarah takes her son, Jeremiah back, but he doesn't like her, so he runs away. Sarah finds him and gets with an abusive guy that rapes and beats Jeremiah. Jeremiah is sent to live with Sarah's God-obsessed parents. After three years, Sarah is back and takes Jeremiah with her again. Sarah soon realizes that if she is going to keep her men, then she cannot say Jeremiah is her son, so she persuades him to cross dressing. It's too bad that Marilyn Manson only had a 5 minute cameo, because he was really good. Sarah and Jeremiah go into hiding because she thinks everyone is after them. She makes him think that certain foods are poisoned and makes him drink ipecac. Asia Argento, and the Sprouse brothers did an awesome job. Asia also did a great job at directing.

981308,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000F1IO3E,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[11, 12]","The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (Asia Argento, 2004)I've watched a lot of horror movies over the years. Most have all the horror of a dull toothache. Some are disturbing in various degrees. A select few have actually managed to scare me. As with all things, though, the truly scary films-- Johnny Got His Gun, for example-- are not traditional horror films. I say this by explanation of the statement that the opening scene of The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, in all its banality, before we have any idea who these people are or any idea of their relationship beyond what we can infer from their sexes and ages, is arguably the most terrifying scene I have ever watched. In comparison, a couple of hours previously I'd watched Jenifer, a short film by Asia Argento's father Dario. In my Jenifer review, I was planning on calling it one of the most disturbing experiences I'd ever had with a movie. Then I watched the first five minutes of this flick, and that went out the window.Argento (Asia, this time) shoots the scene with the documentarian feel of a Lindsay Anderson or an Errol Morris-- there's no camera trickery, no out-of-the-ordinary dialogue, no weird set design, there are just two people, whom we assume (rightly, we find out) are mother and son. The fear-- the pure, visceral ugliness that telegraphs in no uncertain terms that neither of these two characters will survive this movie in any real sense (and as I write this, to head off spoiler comments, I will say that I have not finished the movie; I was so affected by the first scene, and some of those that followed, I had to stop watching halfway through, and will finish it tonight)-- comes solely from the mundanity of the set, which could be any messy little house in any part of the country, and the raw power displayed by Asia Argento and Jimmy Bennett playing two people who loathe each other to depths that most of us can't begin to comprehend, and yet realize that they're supposed to love one another. And the movie gets worse from there.Argento plays Sarah, mother to Jeremiah, played by Bennett as a boy and Dylan and Cole (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody-- and how traumatic is THAT?) Sprouse as an adolescent. Sarah is emotionally bereft, an alcoholic and drug addict who lives only to find the next boyfriend and the next score, who views Jeremiah as a weight around her neck but feels compelled to act as his mother because she knows it's what's expected of her. Even when Sarah's parents intervene after Jeremiah ends up in the hospital and keep him at their compound (a vastly disturbing experience in itself) for three years, Sarah comes back for him. Not that being in any one situation is worse than any other for Jeremiah; with the exception of one early scene when he runs away and is temporarily sheltered at a police station, there's no safe place; adults, on the whole, exist in this world for the sole purpose of abusing, exploiting, and destroying children. The movie is relentless in its nihilism; I can't remember seeing a movie this overwhelmingly dark since the first time I saw Guinea Pig 2: The Flower of Flesh and Blood.This is not a movie you will enjoy. At all. In fact, you'll probably come to hate it on levels you weren't even aware you had. But there is no surer indication that a movie is doing its job, and doing it exceptionally well, when you hate the movie because the movie wants you to hate it. This is a scary, scary movie. ****",4,Quite possibly the scariest movie I have ever seen.,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,3463,"['Heart', 'Deceitful', 'Above', 'All', 'Things', 'Asia', 'Argento', '2004', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'years', 'Most', 'have', 'horror', 'dull', 'toothache', 'are', 'disturbing', 'various', 'degrees', 'select', 'few', 'have', 'actually', 'managed', 'scare', 'things', 'though', 'truly', 'scary', 'films', 'Johnny', 'Got', 'Gun', 'example', 'are', 'not', 'traditional', 'horror', 'films', 'say', 'explanation', 'statement', 'opening', 'scene', 'Heart', 'Deceitful', 'Above', 'All', 'Things', 'banality', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'idea', 'relationship', 'what', 'can', 'infer', 'sexes', 'ages', 'arguably', 'most', 'terrifying', 'scene', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'comparison', 'couple', 'hours', 'previously', ""'d"", 'watched', 'Jenifer', 'short', 'film', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'father', 'Dario', 'Jenifer', 'review', 'was', 'planning', 'calling', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'experiences', ""'d"", 'ever', 'had', 'movie', 'Then', 'watched', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'flick', 'went', 'out', 'window.Argento', 'Asia', 'time', 'scene', 'documentarian', 'feel', 'Lindsay', 'Anderson', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'camera', 'trickery', 'out-of-the-ordinary', 'dialogue', 'weird', 'set', 'design', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'whom', 'assume', 'rightly', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'mother', 'son', 'fear', 'pure', 'visceral', 'ugliness', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'two', 'characters', 'will', 'survive', 'movie', 'real', 'sense', 'write', 'head', 'off', 'spoiler', 'comments', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'finished', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'affected', 'first', 'scene', 'followed', 'had', 'stop', 'watching', 'halfway', 'will', 'finish', 'tonight', 'solely', 'mundanity', 'set', 'could', 'be', 'messy', 'little', 'house', 'part', 'country', 'raw', 'power', 'displayed', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'playing', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'loathe', 'other', 'depths', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'comprehend', 'yet', 'realize', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'love', 'one', 'movie', 'worse', 'there.Argento', 'plays', 'Sarah', 'mother', 'Jeremiah', 'played', 'Bennett', 'boy', 'Dylan', 'Cole', 'Suite', 'Life', 'Zack', 'Cody', 'how', 'traumatic', 'Sprouse', 'adolescent', 'Sarah', 'emotionally', 'bereft', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'only', 'find', 'next', 'boyfriend', 'next', 'score', 'who', 'Jeremiah', 'weight', 'neck', 'feels', 'compelled', 'act', 'mother', 'what', 'expected', 'Even', 'when', 'Sarah', 'parents', 'intervene', 'Jeremiah', 'up', 'hospital', 'keep', 'compound', 'vastly', 'disturbing', 'experience', 'three', 'years', 'Sarah', 'back', 'Not', 'being', 'one', 'situation', 'worse', 'other', 'Jeremiah', 'exception', 'one', 'early', 'scene', 'when', 'away', 'temporarily', 'sheltered', 'police', 'station', 'safe', 'place', 'adults', 'whole', 'exist', 'world', 'sole', 'purpose', 'abusing', 'exploiting', 'destroying', 'children', 'movie', 'relentless', 'nihilism', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'overwhelmingly', 'dark', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Guinea', 'Pig', '2', 'Flower', 'Flesh', 'Blood.This', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'come', 'hate', 'levels', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'had', 'surer', 'indication', 'movie', 'doing', 'job', 'doing', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'when', 'hate', 'movie', 'movie', 'hate', 'scary', 'scary', 'movie', '****']",The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things
981309,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B000F1IO3E,Thomas M. Sipos,"[4, 10]","An ugly film about lowlifes.  Young boy is taken from his foster parents and raised by a ""white trash"" mother.  She becomes a prostitute, performs as a stripper, steals, does drugs and booze.  She gives him drugs, lies to him, abuses him, and dresses up up like a girl.  He's also whipped.  He's briefly taken by his Christian conservative grandparents, where the boy witnesses more whipping.Long periods of boredom, punctuated by moments of intense distaste.What's the rational for filming this story?  Well, it's based on a true story; how the boy eventually had a sex change ... oh wait, that's right.  The ""true story"" turned out to be a HOAX.  The author was born a female, and her book is a lie.Which brings me to the funniest part in this DVD -- the special features, wherein director/star Asia Argento, when asked if she's bothered by filming a hoax (they discovered this two months into filming), says, ""Oh, no.  Everything's a lie.  What's truth?  I'm lying to you now.  We all lie.""And all the other participants go on about how ""it's even better that it's based on a lie,"" yada, yada.I don't believe them.  They sound like the clueless band on Spinal Tap.  Ian Smith comes out with the dreadful black album cover, and they're all saying, ""It's like a black mirror,"" and ""How much more black can it be, and the answer is, none.""Only one band member has the brains to say, ""Is that good?  You all sound like you're rationalizing, like this is something you did on purpose.  I think we're stuck with a very dismal, stupid album cover.""Likewise, I think the filmmakers found out, to their horror, that the basis for their film was a lie, but the money was spent; they were already filming.  So all the lawyers and agents and executives huddled, and after threats of lawsuits were bandied about, everyone came to a settlement about how they'd spin this to the public.  So now the lying author, and director Asia Argento, and everyone else is spinning from the same page, pretending that this is all wonderful and the film is ""even better"" that it's not true.Excuse me, but much of the power of SCHINDLER'S LIST and GLORY is that they are based on truth.  If those stories were to be hoaxes, the films would lose much power.  So too this film.  That's how truth works.Marilyn Manson fans have expressed disappointment over Manson's brief cameo.  I can empathize.  I only got this film because Winona Ryder is listed at the IMDB as being in it.  And she is -- for all of about two minutes.  Tellingly, while Ryder is in the DVD insert promo booklet, her name is not on the film's credits.  Perhaps she was so embarrassed that she demanded her name be removed?",1,"boring and distasteful film, but the ""Spinal Tap"" special feature is funny",1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2664,"['ugly', 'film', 'lowlifes', 'Young', 'boy', 'taken', 'foster', 'parents', 'raised', 'white', 'trash', 'mother', 'prostitute', 'performs', 'stripper', 'steals', 'drugs', 'booze', 'drugs', 'up', 'up', 'girl', 'also', 'whipped', 'briefly', 'taken', 'Christian', 'conservative', 'grandparents', 'where', 'boy', 'more', 'whipping.Long', 'periods', 'boredom', 'punctuated', 'moments', 'intense', 'distaste.What', 'rational', 'filming', 'story', 'Well', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'boy', 'eventually', 'had', 'sex', 'change', 'oh', 'wait', 'right', 'true', 'story', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'HOAX', 'author', 'was', 'born', 'female', 'book', 'lie.Which', 'funniest', 'part', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'wherein', 'director/star', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'when', 'asked', 'bothered', 'filming', 'hoax', 'discovered', 'two', 'months', 'filming', 'Oh', 'Everything', 'lie', 'What', 'truth', ""'m"", 'lying', 'now', 'lie', 'other', 'participants', 'go', 'how', 'even', 'better', 'based', 'lie', 'yada', 'yada.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'sound', 'clueless', 'band', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Ian', 'Smith', 'out', 'dreadful', 'black', 'album', 'cover', ""'re"", 'saying', 'black', 'mirror', 'How', 'much', 'more', 'black', 'can', 'be', 'answer', 'none', 'Only', 'one', 'band', 'member', 'brains', 'say', 'good', 'sound', ""'re"", 'rationalizing', 'something', 'did', 'purpose', 'think', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'very', 'dismal', 'stupid', 'album', 'cover', 'Likewise', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'found', 'out', 'horror', 'basis', 'film', 'was', 'lie', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'were', 'already', 'filming', 'lawyers', 'agents', 'executives', 'huddled', 'threats', 'lawsuits', 'were', 'bandied', 'everyone', 'came', 'settlement', 'how', ""'d"", 'spin', 'public', 'So', 'now', 'lying', 'author', 'director', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'everyone', 'else', 'spinning', 'same', 'page', 'pretending', 'wonderful', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'not', 'true.Excuse', 'much', 'power', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'GLORY', 'are', 'based', 'truth', 'stories', 'were', 'be', 'hoaxes', 'films', 'would', 'lose', 'much', 'power', 'So', 'too', 'film', 'how', 'truth', 'works.Marilyn', 'Manson', 'fans', 'have', 'expressed', 'disappointment', 'Manson', 'brief', 'cameo', 'can', 'empathize', 'only', 'got', 'film', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'listed', 'IMDB', 'being', 'two', 'minutes', 'Tellingly', 'Ryder', 'DVD', 'insert', 'promo', 'booklet', 'name', 'not', 'film', 'credits', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'so', 'embarrassed', 'demanded', 'name', 'be', 'removed']",The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things

And as I've heard from a couple of sources, Sarah is not as powerful book as this one. With that in mind, I have to say that the movie was incomplete, in the sense that many details were missing, i.e. the children of Lot Lizards were completely eliminated from the movie. Most of the scenes were short and independent, and it was sometimes difficult to make out the transition between the scenes. On top of that, most scenes were kinda cut in the end, unclear, as if incomplete or left me with ""huh?"" It took me two times of reviewing to figure out who was actually sitting on Manson's lap. Should've just let the kids do it. I also did not find this movie as horrifying as people described the book. Honestly, I bought this DVD because Sprouse Twins were in it. And given the subject matter and all that comes with it, it was very interesting to see how they will play the movie out. They were great -- all the actors were pretty good including Jimmy Bennett.
