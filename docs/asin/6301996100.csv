All credibilty goes out the window five minutes into the movie when it becomes clear the bad guys are comic relief villains. The ""rape"" sequence, meant to set up the story plays like a rejected scene from an old sitcom, thus the viewer is not given the opportunity to have any emotional involement with Hannie.For those of you who are still interested, Robert Culp mentors Welch so she can get revenge; and Christopher Lee shows up in yet another movie which wastes his talents. Pretty routine stuff, but at least its better than Welch's MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. (Is it possible for movies to get any WORSE than that?)

289356,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,6301996100,Charismatic Creature,"[14, 19]","I caught this on the tube, having not seen it in over 30 years. I was expecting something very campy, in keeping with Raquel Welch's overall film oeuvre and was rather pleasantly surprised. Despite flaws, this is an above average western with the unusual addition of a strong female protagonist.Hannie Caulder is raped and left for dead by a gang of three outlaws (Strother Martin, Jack Elam and Ernest Borgnine...reprising roles that each of them played over the years many times). She hooks up with a bounty hunter (Robert Culp) who teaches her how to shoot so she can get revenge on the rapists.Certainly there are some aspects of this film that are severely dated: Raquel Welch hangs around in a poncho for the first half of the film...a kinda mini-dress with apparently nothing underneath, so you find yourself looking salaciously to see some flesh. This is a Playboy magazine-like detail that is more distracting than anything else...it plays off of Ms. Welch's beauty (and she is absolutely at the peak of her loveliness here) and the image of her in nothing-but-a-short-poncho is quite iconic. But it's dumb...how on earth can she ride a horse in the desert with NOTHING on the lower half of her body? Ouch! Later, she acquires a pair of super-tight deerskin slacks, which is equally ridiculous. No woman of the 1800's would have been caught dead in men's clothing. Neither would one have worn her hair long and straight or tons of black mascara. This superimposing of modern styles on a period drama is particularly badly handled and quite unnecessary, as Ms. Welch was more than beautiful enough to handle this role in proper period attire.Robert Culp is delightful in an unexpected turn as a be-spectacled bounty hunter with a gentlemanly demeanor. The budding romance between his character, Price, and Hannie is nicely handled. This is a good example of how unexpected characters often blend better romantically than ""conventional"" stock characters. Christopher Lee has a nice supporting role as a grisly old gunmaker -- further evidence that he's a fine actor who deserved a lot better than the typical horror movie roles he often got stuck with.The worst of this film is the comedic treatment of the three gangsters. If they had been treated more seriously, the rape would be more devastating (Price wants Hannie to forget about it and go off with him) adn it's aftermath more understandable. The attitudes about rape here are very simplistic and dated, unfortunately, but if you watch other movies about rape victims from the same era, you will see it was a standard treatment. However, comedic villains are not frightening nor do they warrant being killed off, so the ""Three Stooges"" quality defeats much of the thrust of the plot.Despite these flaws, ""Hannie Caulder"" is consistently interesting and generally well-acted, with good cinematography. It represents a very rare attempt to show  a western with a female protagonist, let alone an ""action hero"" type who gets to ride and shoot and defend herself! The budding feminism that produced this still had a long way to go in terms of understanding the psychology of rape, but compare ""Hannie Caulder"" to such otherwise excellent modern westerns such as ""Unforgiven"" or ""Open Range"" where the female parts are limited to prostitutes or schoolmarms.It would be fascinating to see this remade today with some of these elements addressed (the rape, the ""funny"" rapists). However, this is a nicely done and unusual western drama from a period where corny Spaghetti Westerns were the norm. It took some guts and creativity to break that mold and ""Hannie Caulder"" is the interesting result. Hopefully, they will get this out on DVD one of these days...it would be fascinating to hear commentary from the surviving cast members about this film.",3,Above average 70s western drama,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,3805,"['caught', 'tube', 'having', 'not', 'seen', '30', 'years', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'very', 'campy', 'keeping', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'overall', 'film', 'oeuvre', 'was', 'rather', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'flaws', 'above', 'average', 'western', 'unusual', 'addition', 'strong', 'female', 'protagonist.Hannie', 'Caulder', 'raped', 'left', 'dead', 'gang', 'three', 'outlaws', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'reprising', 'roles', 'played', 'years', 'many', 'times', 'up', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'who', 'how', 'shoot', 'can', 'get', 'revenge', 'rapists.Certainly', 'are', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'severely', 'dated', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'hangs', 'poncho', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'kinda', 'mini-dress', 'apparently', 'nothing', 'underneath', 'find', 'looking', 'salaciously', 'see', 'flesh', 'Playboy', 'magazine-like', 'detail', 'more', 'distracting', 'anything', 'else', 'Ms.', 'Welch', 'beauty', 'absolutely', 'peak', 'loveliness', 'here', 'image', 'nothing-but-a-short-poncho', 'quite', 'iconic', 'dumb', 'how', 'earth', 'can', 'ride', 'horse', 'desert', 'NOTHING', 'lower', 'half', 'body', 'Ouch', 'Later', 'pair', 'super-tight', 'deerskin', 'slacks', 'equally', 'ridiculous', 'woman', '1800', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'dead', 'men', 'clothing', 'would', 'one', 'have', 'worn', 'hair', 'long', 'straight', 'tons', 'black', 'mascara', 'superimposing', 'modern', 'styles', 'period', 'drama', 'particularly', 'badly', 'handled', 'quite', 'unnecessary', 'Ms.', 'Welch', 'was', 'more', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'handle', 'role', 'proper', 'period', 'attire.Robert', 'Culp', 'delightful', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'be-spectacled', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'gentlemanly', 'demeanor', 'budding', 'romance', 'character', 'Price', 'Hannie', 'nicely', 'handled', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'unexpected', 'characters', 'often', 'blend', 'better', 'romantically', 'conventional', 'stock', 'characters', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'nice', 'supporting', 'role', 'grisly', 'old', 'gunmaker', 'further', 'evidence', 'fine', 'actor', 'who', 'deserved', 'lot', 'better', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'often', 'got', 'stuck', 'with.The', 'worst', 'film', 'comedic', 'treatment', 'three', 'gangsters', 'had', 'been', 'treated', 'more', 'seriously', 'rape', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'devastating', 'Price', 'Hannie', 'forget', 'go', 'off', 'adn', 'aftermath', 'more', 'understandable', 'attitudes', 'rape', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'simplistic', 'dated', 'unfortunately', 'watch', 'other', 'movies', 'rape', 'victims', 'same', 'era', 'will', 'see', 'was', 'standard', 'treatment', 'However', 'comedic', 'villains', 'are', 'not', 'frightening', 'do', 'warrant', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'quality', 'defeats', 'much', 'thrust', 'plot.Despite', 'flaws', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'generally', 'well-acted', 'good', 'cinematography', 'very', 'rare', 'attempt', 'show', 'western', 'female', 'protagonist', 'let', 'alone', 'action', 'hero', 'type', 'who', 'ride', 'shoot', 'defend', 'budding', 'feminism', 'produced', 'still', 'had', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'terms', 'understanding', 'psychology', 'rape', 'compare', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', 'such', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'modern', 'westerns', 'such', 'Unforgiven', 'Open', 'Range', 'where', 'female', 'parts', 'are', 'limited', 'prostitutes', 'schoolmarms.It', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'see', 'remade', 'today', 'elements', 'addressed', 'rape', 'funny', 'rapists', 'However', 'nicely', 'done', 'unusual', 'western', 'drama', 'period', 'where', 'corny', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'were', 'norm', 'took', 'guts', 'creativity', 'break', 'mold', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', 'interesting', 'result', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'get', 'out', 'DVD', 'one', 'days', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'commentary', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'film']",Hannie Caulder VHS
289357,AUDIJM3VUULS7,6301996100,Charles Tatum,"[0, 0]","The ""rape revenge"" story has been told many times in the past, but I doubt few films have ever portrayed it with comedic elements.The villainous trio of Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam, and Strother Martin can never seem to rob banks right. After another failed attempt, they happen upon Raquel Welch after they murder her husband in cold blood. After raping her, they leave her for dead, burning down her home. She escapes wearing just a blanket, and meets up with bounty hunter Robert Culp. He agrees to show her how to shoot, so she can exact her revenge. Her gunfighting technique is tested when she helps Culp fight off bandits while they are visiting Christopher Lee, a gunsmith who fashions Caulder a custom revolver. Eventually, Culp and Welch meet up with the three villains, and a lot of people die.To highlight the good first, Robert Culp is such a natural actor, it is a shame he has had to resort to trash like the ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" series as of late. His Thomas Price character is sympathetic and tough, without being another superhero cowboy who never gets hurt or never has a feeling. Christopher Lee is a revelation as the gunsmith Bailey. Taken out of his usual horror film, he shows he can really act without having to pop fangs in his mouth or wrap himself in toilet paper and limp after turn of the century archaeologists. His role is brief, but good. Burt Kennedy, a veteran Western director, knows his stuff. The gunfight at Lee's home is as well shot as any action sequence today, without relying on special effects or CGI. The obligatory romance between Welch and Culp is also handled very well, as they tentatively fall for each other.The three brother rapists, played by the usually reliable Martin, Elam, and Borgnine, are written like they just stepped out of a Marx Brothers or Three Stooges movie. They spend most of their scenes either arguing like five year olds, or blowing innocent people away. As a viewer, you already hate them enough for their crimes without the screenwriter having to resort to weak ""funny"" scenes to show how awful they are. I was not sure if this was a drama, or a weak Western comedy along the lines of ""Dirty Dingus Magee,"" especially when the soundtrack sometimes does the ""funny music,"" accentuating the ""funny"" rapists' actions.Poor Raquel Welch. She is gorgeous, but the director and writer did not have enough confidence in her to fully write a character for her. In her first few scenes, she does not have any dialogue! Most of her scenes involve a peek-a-boo game of showing various parts of her body without resorting to full nudity. Fine for a comedy, but I did not think we should be ogling a recent rape victim and widow.The introduction of a mysterious man in black (no, not Johnny Cash) to help Caulder was probably supposed to bathe the film in an air of mysticism, but the stunt feels weak and half thought out. His presence is never explained, as if the writer wanted the viewer to draw their own conclusions. As Welch begins gunning for her prey, she keeps having flashbacks to her rape and hearing Culp's advice in her ears during the gunfights. The screenwriter hits us over the head with this over and over again, but decides we are smart enough to analyze a character who shows up for no other reason than to get Welch out of a jam. Poor judgement on the writer's part.Due to the aforementioned positives, I do slightly recommend ""Hannie Caulder,"" but do not watch this for a positive Western female role model. This is definitely a chauvinistic idea of a vengeful, beautiful female gunfighter.This is rated (R) for some physical violence, strong gun violence, strong sexual violence, gore, profanity, very brief female nudity, and sexual references.",3,Burt Kennedy's Hannie Caulder,1022112000,"05 23, 2002",2002,3737,"['rape', 'revenge', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'doubt', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'comedic', 'elements.The', 'villainous', 'trio', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'rob', 'banks', 'right', 'failed', 'attempt', 'happen', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'murder', 'husband', 'cold', 'blood', 'raping', 'leave', 'dead', 'burning', 'down', 'home', 'wearing', 'just', 'blanket', 'up', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'show', 'how', 'shoot', 'can', 'exact', 'revenge', 'gunfighting', 'technique', 'tested', 'when', 'Culp', 'fight', 'off', 'bandits', 'are', 'visiting', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'gunsmith', 'who', 'Caulder', 'custom', 'revolver', 'Eventually', 'Culp', 'Welch', 'meet', 'up', 'three', 'villains', 'lot', 'people', 'die.To', 'good', 'first', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'such', 'natural', 'actor', 'shame', 'had', 'resort', 'trash', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', 'series', 'late', 'Thomas', 'Price', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'tough', 'being', 'superhero', 'cowboy', 'who', 'never', 'never', 'feeling', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'revelation', 'gunsmith', 'Bailey', 'Taken', 'usual', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'having', 'pop', 'fangs', 'mouth', 'wrap', 'toilet', 'paper', 'limp', 'turn', 'century', 'archaeologists', 'role', 'brief', 'good', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'veteran', 'Western', 'director', 'stuff', 'gunfight', 'Lee', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'shot', 'action', 'sequence', 'today', 'relying', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'obligatory', 'romance', 'Welch', 'Culp', 'also', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'tentatively', 'fall', 'other.The', 'three', 'brother', 'rapists', 'played', 'usually', 'reliable', 'Martin', 'Elam', 'Borgnine', 'are', 'written', 'just', 'stepped', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'movie', 'spend', 'most', 'scenes', 'arguing', 'five', 'year', 'olds', 'blowing', 'innocent', 'people', 'away', 'viewer', 'already', 'hate', 'enough', 'crimes', 'screenwriter', 'having', 'resort', 'weak', 'funny', 'scenes', 'show', 'how', 'awful', 'are', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'drama', 'weak', 'Western', 'comedy', 'lines', 'Dirty', 'Dingus', 'Magee', 'especially', 'when', 'soundtrack', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'music', 'accentuating', 'funny', 'rapists', 'actions.Poor', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'gorgeous', 'director', 'writer', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'confidence', 'fully', 'write', 'character', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'not', 'have', 'dialogue', 'Most', 'scenes', 'involve', 'peek-a-boo', 'game', 'showing', 'various', 'parts', 'body', 'resorting', 'full', 'nudity', 'Fine', 'comedy', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'ogling', 'recent', 'rape', 'victim', 'widow.The', 'introduction', 'mysterious', 'man', 'black', 'not', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'help', 'Caulder', 'was', 'probably', 'supposed', 'bathe', 'film', 'air', 'mysticism', 'stunt', 'feels', 'weak', 'half', 'thought', 'out', 'presence', 'never', 'explained', 'writer', 'wanted', 'viewer', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Welch', 'gunning', 'prey', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'rape', 'hearing', 'Culp', 'advice', 'ears', 'gunfights', 'screenwriter', 'head', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'analyze', 'character', 'who', 'up', 'other', 'reason', 'get', 'Welch', 'jam', 'Poor', 'judgement', 'writer', 'part.Due', 'aforementioned', 'positives', 'do', 'slightly', 'recommend', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'positive', 'Western', 'female', 'role', 'model', 'definitely', 'chauvinistic', 'idea', 'vengeful', 'beautiful', 'female', 'gunfighter.This', 'rated', 'R', 'physical', 'violence', 'strong', 'gun', 'violence', 'strong', 'sexual', 'violence', 'gore', 'profanity', 'very', 'brief', 'female', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'references']",Hannie Caulder VHS

And it wasn't much.This isn't a bad film (though there is some bad stuff in it) but it just doesn't bring anything new to the genre. It's a revenge flick. Jack Elam, Struther Martin and Ernest Borgnine play outlaw brothers who are inept bank robbers. While being chased by Federales after a bungled bank job they happen upon a ranch where they figure to steal fresh horses. They end up killing the owner and raping his wife, played by Raquel Welch.

He does, reluctantly, and tries to let her know that it's a bad path she's traveling down.All of this is OK but it's so middle of the road. We've seen it before many times and seen it better. It's directed OK, it's acted OK (accept for Ernest Borgine who is so terrible you wonder how he ever won an Oscar), it's shot OK, the music is OK. It's just OK.The 3 Stooges routine between the brothers gets tired fast and, as best I could tell, there is absolutely no reason for the mysterious stranger.

Hannie ask Price if he would teach her how to use a gun and he says no and leaves. However, Hannie follows him and while she is sleeping, she starts having nightmares about what those three animals did to her. Hannie wakes up in tears and Price asks her how many where there and she tells him 3. What about your husband and Hannie tell him his dead. Therefore, after hearing her story Price agrees to help her and her to see Christopher Lee who is a blacksmith and make Hannie a special gun.QUESTIONS: Why did the Clemens brothers attack Hannie Caulder? Why did they leave her for dead? How far did Hannie walk before she came across the farm? Who showed up at lee place? What did the person want? Who else showed up at Lee place? What did they want? Where did Price and Hannie go after they were finish at Lee place?MY THOUGHTS: I thought this movie was fantastic. I thought that the three actors who played the role of the Clemens Brothers did a very good job. Robert Culp also did a good job playing the role of the gunfighter. However, this movie was about one person and one person only. Raquel Welch! Her role as Hannie Caulder was excellent. When she came out of the fire, all she had on was a blanket. Then they turned around and designed the blanket into a Mexican pullover, which made her more beautiful. Raquel Welch displayed her beauty and her talents with any problems what so ever. Based on Raquel Beauty and Talent alone I give this movie the highest amount of weasel stars I can give and that are 5.",5,WELCH IS FANTASTIC,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,2946,"['TITLE', 'HANNIE', 'CAULDER', 'opened', 'theaters', 'July', '1', '1971', 'movie', 'took', '85', 'minutes', 'watch', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', '1971', 'Western', 'movie', 'starring', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Robert', 'Culp.SUMMARY', 'movie', 'Clemens', 'Brothers', 'riding', 'Mexican', 'Town', 'riding', 'up', 'bank', 'dirt', 'road', 'Mexican', 'Freda', 'sleeping', 'taking', 'break', 'Clemens', 'Brothers', 'are', 'trying', 'rob', 'bank', 'one', 'tellers', 'handle', 'bell', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'gunfight', 'Clemens', 'brothers', 'head', 'town', 'Mexican', 'Army', 'Clemens', 'Brothers', 'come', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', 'husband', 'farm', 'Hannie', 'Husband', 'Clemens', 'Brothers', 'shot', 'kill', 'One', 'Clemens', 'house', 'fine', 'food', 'when', 'Hannie', 'Clemens', 'Brothers', 'take', 'turn', 'Hannie', 'raping', 'repeatedly', 'Then', 'have', 'fun', 'torch', 'place', 'leave', 'Hannie', 'dead', 'Hannie', 'out', 'only', 'fine', 'husband', 'dead', 'down', 'stable', 'use', 'hold', 'horses', 'Hannie', 'husband', 'only', 'blanket', 'walking', 'Hannie', 'old', 'Mexican', 'Farm', 'well', 'when', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'name', 'Thomas', 'Price', 'Hannie', 'Price', 'out', 'barrel', 'rifle', 'leave', 'only', 'change', 'mind', 'stays', 'Hannie', 'Prices', 'revolver', 'practicing', 'shoot', 'Hannie', 'ask', 'Price', 'would', 'teach', 'how', 'use', 'gun', 'However', 'Hannie', 'sleeping', 'having', 'nightmares', 'what', 'three', 'animals', 'did', 'Hannie', 'up', 'tears', 'Price', 'how', 'many', 'where', 'there', '3', 'What', 'husband', 'Hannie', 'tell', 'dead', 'Therefore', 'hearing', 'story', 'Price', 'help', 'see', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'who', 'blacksmith', 'make', 'Hannie', 'special', 'gun.QUESTIONS', 'Why', 'did', 'Clemens', 'brothers', 'attack', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', 'Why', 'did', 'leave', 'dead', 'How', 'far', 'did', 'Hannie', 'walk', 'came', 'farm', 'Who', 'showed', 'up', 'lee', 'place', 'What', 'did', 'person', 'want', 'Who', 'else', 'showed', 'up', 'Lee', 'place', 'What', 'did', 'want', 'Where', 'did', 'Price', 'Hannie', 'go', 'were', 'finish', 'Lee', 'place', 'MY', 'THOUGHTS', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'thought', 'three', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'Clemens', 'Brothers', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'gunfighter', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'person', 'one', 'person', 'only', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'role', 'Hannie', 'Caulder', 'was', 'excellent', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'fire', 'had', 'was', 'blanket', 'Then', 'turned', 'around', 'designed', 'blanket', 'Mexican', 'pullover', 'made', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'displayed', 'beauty', 'talents', 'problems', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'Based', 'Raquel', 'Beauty', 'Talent', 'alone', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'amount', 'weasel', 'stars', 'can', 'give', 'are', '5']",Hannie Caulder VHS

289368,APCUHWVKWROT4,6301996100,"Lost In Kansas ""James Corbett""","[6, 9]","Hannie Caulder is a very frustrating film for an Italian western addict.  When it came out Italian westerns were winding down and Italy was trying to find a way to revive them.  Hollywood being slow and stupid decided it was time to make copies of Italian westerns which were copies of U.S. westerns.  We got Hang'em High, A Man Call Sledge, and this one.  Hannie Caulder is best of the American Italian clones.  At the time,  audiences and critics hated it.  Welch was just a body, a beautiful one, and not an actress.  To Italian western fans, this movie didn't have enough blood or guts, no nudity, and was a bust as far as they were concerned.  I found it interesting at the time because of the writing and pacing.  Robert Culp and Christopher Lee were memorable to me.  I have watched this movie several times on tv and I have grown to really like this movie for what it wasn't it, an Italian western.  All you have to do is look at the cast and it is full of talented character actors and each one is given screen time to make their character rich and full.  I found the movie to be thought full in its scenes with Welch and Culp.  The time in Mexico learning to to shoot, is interesting in the methods to shoot.  The details show here with the rock and the string are handle quickly but you remember them.  The quiet scenes at night when Culp talks to Welch about about quiting her idea of revenge are tender and passoinated.  Lee's building of Hannie's pistol is a delight to any gun nut and is spot on.  It is here that one of the stranges scenes takes place, the Preacher. This gunfighter drifts in and has Lee fix his gun.  Culp warns Hannie to stay away from him. The Preacher glances at Hannie and Culp and rides off.  The actor who plays tis part is not listed in credits and for the life of me I can't remember his name, Stephen Boyd?, but I know he made several popular movies in the 70's.  I have not mentioned the demented three stooges Elam, Borgnine, Martin.  These veteran actors are sick, funny, and dangerous.  THe gunfights are a thing of beauty because they are realistic in the action and sans gore.  The ending is the predictable shootout and Hannie wins.  BUT during the shootout the Preacher shows up, but doesn't help Hannie in her fight. When everything is over and Hannie has killed the men who raped her and killed the man she loved, Culp, the Peacher offers his had to her and she rides off with him.  I can't explain it but this ending sort of fits.  I don't know why but I was statisfied with it.  Hannie Caulder is a solid western that deserved more that it got the first time around.The key to the success of this movie goes to its director Burt Kenndy.

Hannie Caulder, although not a ""spaghetti"" western, has the same sort of flavor. As a movie, to me, it really fell short of the mark.The movie is filled with acting talent that appeals to me: Robert Culp, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam. With these guys in a film, one would think it's a sure fire winner. However, both the Ernest Borgnine and Jack Elam characters are reduced to clowns, and Robert Culp's character doesn't seem to reach his full potential. What this film does provide is multiple opportunities to view Welch's cleavage (at the beginning of the film), her dental work (as she is ""screaming""), her legs and butt - and the image of her naked under the blanket that she ultimately wears while scramblng around in the desert until she finds Culp. Oh, and her wind-tossled hair blowing seductively around her face. And a shot of her bum in tight, wet pants, that was totally gratuitous. HO-HUM...I think the idea was to show Ms. Welch as some sort of strong, female character. It just didn't work for me. It was the same as with 10,000 BC. Just as in that movie it was Raquel Welch in a furry bikini, in this movie it was Raquel Welch, topless under a blanket (she never does get a shirt/blouse), running around in the desert. She never looks as though she is IN the 1880's old west.

The 5 stars are a kind of ""what took you so long"" for an official Region 1 release! I bought an import version (Korean I think) of this movie several years ago because I got tired of waiting, but I have no idea yet how it compares to this upcoming release.This movie is a strange bird. I find it a very enjoyable ""revenge"" Western. But there IS something jarring about the slapstick way the gang of rapists (Elam, Martin and Borgnine) are portrayed. There is also something stupid about the way the ""mysterious stranger"" is introduced into the plot towards the end of the movie - I have often wondered if some part of the story line was just left out through bad editing, or if the director was just manifesting contempt for the audience. Maybe this release, if it includes commentary, will clear up the matter.Anyhow, neither of these two criticisms ultimately detract from my overall enjoyment of Hannie Caulder.

The killers are played by veteran character actors (and perennial Western movie actors)Ernest Borgnine, Strother Martin, and Jack Elam.Tracking the three men, she crosses paths with a sage bounty hunter, played by Robert Culp, who teaches her how to shoot and the ins and outs of gunfighting. Together, they take off in pursuit of the three men.This movie had a lot of potential, but wastes it in several ways. The script can't find a balance between her being too hard or two soft, so she seems both, negating the believability of the premise. The three men, as directed by veteran Western director Burt Kennedy, also tries to have it both ways with them being savage and cartoonishly humorous. Culp is fine in his role, but can only do so much when the focus is supposed to be on Welch's character.This is a film that could be remade and redone better.",3,Lukewarm Welch Western Wastes Potential,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,1050,"['Hannie', 'Caulder', 'Western', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'Welch', 'woman', 'husband', 'killed', 'killer', 'rape', 'burn', 'down', 'house', 'killers', 'are', 'played', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'perennial', 'Western', 'movie', 'actors', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Jack', 'Elam.Tracking', 'three', 'men', 'paths', 'sage', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'played', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'who', 'how', 'shoot', 'ins', 'outs', 'gunfighting', 'Together', 'take', 'off', 'pursuit', 'three', 'men.This', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'several', 'ways', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'balance', 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'two', 'soft', 'negating', 'believability', 'premise', 'three', 'men', 'directed', 'veteran', 'Western', 'director', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'also', 'have', 'ways', 'being', 'savage', 'cartoonishly', 'humorous', 'Culp', 'fine', 'role', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'focus', 'supposed', 'be', 'Welch', 'character.This', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'remade', 'redone', 'better']",Hannie Caulder VHS

289384,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6301996100,T O'Brien,"[15, 16]","Hannie Caulder is a surprisingly good western with a very good cast.  After a failed bank robbery, three bumbling brothers come upon a lone house in the desert.  They kill the man of the house and rape his wife, Hannie.  The trio burns the house and leaves her for dead.  However, Hannie survives hoping to one day get her revenge on the three gunmen.  She runs into a bounty hunter who begins to teach her how to handle and fire a gun with some sort of accuracy so she will be able to exact her revenge on the brothers.  In a way, this is the female version of Nevada Smith with Hannie chasing after three gunmen just like Steve McQueen's character, Max, did in Nevada Smith.  The gunfights are well choreographed with blood squibs, ala The Wild Bunch.  Hannie Caulder is a very good revenge western that is well worth a watch.Raquel Welch stars as frontier wife turned gunfighter, Hannie Caulder, who teams up with a bounty hunter so she can kill the men who raped her and killed her husband.  She does a lot with so little, and it doesn't help that she never looked better than she did in this movie.  Much of the first half hour has her in a poncho and nothing else.  Robert Culp is also excellent as infamous bounty hunter, Thomas Luther Price, who teaches Hannie how to handle a gun.  The bumbling Clemens brothers, Emmett, Frank, and Rufus, are played by Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam, and Strother Martin.  For such despicable people, this movie gives them lots of comedic moments.  Christopher Lee stars in a small part as a gunmaker, Bailey, who makes a specialized gun for Hannie.  The movie also stars Stephen Boyd and Aldo Sambrell in uncredited roles.  It is a shame there is no DVD release for Hannie Caulder since it is such a beautifully shot movie.

She proved this with 'FATHOM', one of the best female secret agent movies ever made and her trio of westerns ,'BANDOLERO' in which she played a grieving widow with teeth, '100 RIFLES' playing Burt Reynolds girlfriend of the Revolution and could handle a gun and Jim Brown as well as her bandit team, and 'HANNIE CAULDER' the best role of her career and one of the most underrated films in the Western genre.  Written and Directed by Burt Kennedy , this was a British, Spanish,co-production which is in the company of Edward Dmytryk's 'SHALAKO' with Sean Connery and Don Medford's 'THE HUNTING PARTY' with Oliver Reed and Gene Hackman and could almost pass as a Spaghetti Western but not quite.  Not only does it give Raquel a pivotol role as the heroine obsessed with revenge but it has a stunning cast.  Robert Culp shines as Thomas Price , a bounty hunter who takes Raquel under his wing and teaches her the way of the gun, Sir Christopher Lee licking his acting chops in the great role of Bailey, a lethal gunsmith who creates the perfect weapon for Raquel's vengeance and the targets of her revenge, three of the greatest character actors : Ernest Borgnine, Strother Martin, and at his leering best, Jack Elam.  Add Stephen Boyd in a special cameo and you have an incredible mix.  A rousing music score by Ken Thorne and beautifully photographed by Edward Scaife , 'HANNIE CAULDER' is a masterpiece and along with 'FATHOM', demonstrates the underrated acting ability of Raquel Welch who deservedly had the mantle as the most beautiful woman ever to grace the screen.
