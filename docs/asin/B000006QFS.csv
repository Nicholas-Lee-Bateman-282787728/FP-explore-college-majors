He played golf while the nation dug bomb shelters. Grade-schoolers ducked under their desks in drills as if they would shield them from hydrogen bombs. Elvis Presley fathered modern music and the Sexual Revolution. Eisenhower's chief contribution was the Interstate Highway System. Interstates changed everything. Even numbers like I-40 run east and west. Odd numbers like I-65 run north and south.,4,Dwight Eisenhower,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,486,"['Being', 'big', 'General', 'Europe', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'Eisenhower', 'two', 'terms', 'played', 'golf', 'nation', 'dug', 'bomb', 'shelters', 'Grade-schoolers', 'ducked', 'desks', 'drills', 'would', 'shield', 'hydrogen', 'bombs', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'fathered', 'modern', 'music', 'Sexual', 'Revolution', 'Eisenhower', 'chief', 'contribution', 'was', 'Interstate', 'Highway', 'System', 'changed', 'everything', 'Even', 'numbers', 'I-40', 'run', 'east', 'west', 'Odd', 'numbers', 'I-65', 'run', 'north', 'south']",N/A

But, given that problem, to my taste entirely too much time and space was devoted in this presentation to ""talking heads"" giving their opinions and perspectives on Eisenhower---most of whom had never met the man.  I'm sure there are miles of newsreel film and hundreds of photographs of Eisenhower available, especially during WWII and his presidency, which would have made this biography a far more interesting and complete portrayal of the extraordinary man that he was.

It captured it in essence but if this dvd had been lengthened out to 2 dvds, looking into his cabinet, his style as a President, etc. it might have been a great set.  It seemed before you knew it, the 100 minutes was gone and you didn't get a more in-depth sense of the significance of his presidency. I'm sure someone will put another dvd out.",3,Pleasant biographic overview,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,711,"['got', 'dvd', 'supplement', 'PBS', 'box', 'set', 'Presidents', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'dvd', 'Eisenhower.This', 'dvd', 'A', 'E', 'Biography', 'series', 'so', 'take', 'overall', 'view', 'Eisenhower', 'life', 'hitting', 'maybe', 'more', 'familiar', 'highs', 'lows', 'members', 'family', 'co-workers', 'offering', 'views', 'etc', 'fell', 'short', 'Eisenhower', 'Presidency', 'captured', 'essence', 'dvd', 'had', 'been', 'lengthened', '2', 'dvds', 'looking', 'cabinet', 'style', 'President', 'etc', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'set', 'seemed', 'knew', '100', 'minutes', 'was', 'gone', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'in-depth', 'sense', 'significance', 'presidency', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'will', 'put', 'dvd', 'out']",N/A
