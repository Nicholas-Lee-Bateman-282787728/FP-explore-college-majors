Do NOT get so wrapped up in it until you've known the person face to face. I loved the characters as well. The woman who played the wife of Thomas is such a good actress in this movie. I highly recommend this.,5,True Story At Its Finest,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,335,"['so', 'true', 'internet', 'lot', 'relationships', 'are', 'just', 'lies', 'Simple', 'straight', 'are', 'Do', 'NOT', 'get', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', ""'ve"", 'known', 'person', 'face', 'face', 'loved', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'wife', 'Thomas', 'such', 'good', 'actress', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1603804,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B00A1O0G7M,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[7, 8]","This psychological thriller is based on the true story of the ""Marine Sniper Case"" as it has come to be called.  The film wonderfully portrays the allure of a different and more exciting life; escape from the seeming boredom of the everyday humdrum existence.  Fifty-year-old Thomas Montgomery works at a factory in Michigan, has a loving but sometimes preoccupied wife and two young daughters.  Once a month, Thomas joins the guys from his work in a game of poker.  When the men invite Thomas to play poker with them online, he is immediately intrigued.  Accessing the site, Thomas is distracted by an invitation from a high school teenager to chat.  Online flirtation slowly but inexorably builds to an explosive and heartwrenching obsession that will destroy many lives and reveal a twisted web of lies and manipulation too cruel to be imagined.This movie is riveting in its unflinching portrayal of obsession.  I particularly appreciate that the story did not resort to shameful titillation or that glorification of infidelity was not shown.  Too many movies revel in imorality, and, though some scenes in this production are sexually charged, the context must be taken into account.  Garrett Dillahunt is superb as Thomas, showing great vulnerability that can escalate into irrational fury.  He is likable even if the viewer longs to scream at him in frustration.  The other performers are excellent as well, particularly Laura Jacomo, the woman who portrays Thomas' wife.Please give this movie a chance.  I'd also recommend the excellent documentary based on the case which goes by the same title.  It's very informative and chilling as well.  God bless you all and happy viewing.",5,Gripping: a Graphic Depiction of Obsession and Delusion,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,1686,"['psychological', 'thriller', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Marine', 'Sniper', 'Case', 'come', 'be', 'called', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'allure', 'different', 'more', 'exciting', 'life', 'seeming', 'boredom', 'everyday', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'Fifty-year-old', 'Thomas', 'Montgomery', 'factory', 'Michigan', 'loving', 'sometimes', 'preoccupied', 'wife', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Once', 'month', 'Thomas', 'guys', 'work', 'game', 'poker', 'When', 'men', 'invite', 'Thomas', 'play', 'poker', 'online', 'immediately', 'intrigued', 'Accessing', 'site', 'Thomas', 'distracted', 'invitation', 'high', 'school', 'teenager', 'chat', 'Online', 'flirtation', 'slowly', 'inexorably', 'builds', 'explosive', 'heartwrenching', 'obsession', 'will', 'destroy', 'many', 'lives', 'reveal', 'twisted', 'web', 'lies', 'manipulation', 'too', 'cruel', 'be', 'imagined.This', 'movie', 'riveting', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'obsession', 'particularly', 'appreciate', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'resort', 'shameful', 'titillation', 'glorification', 'infidelity', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'revel', 'imorality', 'scenes', 'production', 'are', 'sexually', 'charged', 'context', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'account', 'Garrett', 'Dillahunt', 'superb', 'Thomas', 'showing', 'great', 'vulnerability', 'can', 'escalate', 'irrational', 'fury', 'likable', 'even', 'viewer', 'longs', 'scream', 'frustration', 'other', 'performers', 'are', 'excellent', 'well', 'particularly', 'Laura', 'Jacomo', 'woman', 'who', 'Thomas', 'wife.Please', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'based', 'case', 'same', 'title', 'very', 'informative', 'chilling', 'as', 'well', 'God', 'happy', 'viewing']",N/A
