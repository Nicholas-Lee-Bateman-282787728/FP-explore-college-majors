967306,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000E3L78C,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 7]","Lady Vengeance, the third installment in Park Chan-Wook trilogy of vengeance is some notches below the masterpiece that was Old Boy (I have not seen the first movie, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) but it is still a well-made film, worth seeing. In this case, as the title suggests, is a woman who seeks revenge, Lee Geum-Ja, after being held in prison for thirteen years for the murder of a child he did not commit (but was involved in the kidnapping). She was forced to confess to the murder after the murderer, a teacher called Mr. Baek, held her daughter hostage, threatening to kill her. Once in prison (after the murder being covered feverishly by the sensationalist press), she presented herself as a model prisoner, always helping her fellow inmates with a supposedly angelic demeanor. Once she finished her sentence, and she was released from prison, her personality reverted to her true self: that of a cold avenger seeking the death of Mr. Baek. To achieve that, she recruits the help of her former inmates, who owed her for her actions in prison in a variety of ways. Filmed stylishly, the movie works through a complicated scheme of flashbacks and dream sequences, though unlike Old Boy, it is clear from the start who wants revenge from whom (and Lee is so dedicated, we never doubt that she will succeed in her mission). The first hour and a half of the film is really gripping; the last twenty minutes are a complete letdown: the scenes of the parents of other children murdered by Baek discussing justice is really dreadful (as are all the scenes of Lee reuniting with her daughter, in which the film does not shy away from saccharine sentimentality). Still, I recommend this film, with reservations.",3,"Good film, with some reservations",1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,1713,"['Lady', 'Vengeance', 'third', 'installment', 'Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'trilogy', 'vengeance', 'notches', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'Old', 'Boy', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'still', 'well-made', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'case', 'title', 'woman', 'who', 'revenge', 'Lee', 'Geum-Ja', 'being', 'held', 'prison', 'thirteen', 'years', 'murder', 'child', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'was', 'involved', 'kidnapping', 'was', 'forced', 'confess', 'murder', 'murderer', 'teacher', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'held', 'daughter', 'hostage', 'threatening', 'kill', 'Once', 'prison', 'murder', 'being', 'covered', 'feverishly', 'sensationalist', 'press', 'presented', 'model', 'prisoner', 'always', 'helping', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'supposedly', 'angelic', 'demeanor', 'finished', 'sentence', 'was', 'released', 'prison', 'personality', 'reverted', 'true', 'self', 'cold', 'avenger', 'seeking', 'death', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'achieve', 'help', 'former', 'inmates', 'who', 'owed', 'actions', 'prison', 'variety', 'ways', 'Filmed', 'stylishly', 'movie', 'complicated', 'scheme', 'flashbacks', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Old', 'Boy', 'clear', 'start', 'who', 'revenge', 'whom', 'Lee', 'so', 'dedicated', 'never', 'doubt', 'will', 'succeed', 'mission', 'first', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'really', 'gripping', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'complete', 'letdown', 'scenes', 'parents', 'other', 'children', 'murdered', 'Baek', 'discussing', 'justice', 'really', 'dreadful', 'are', 'scenes', 'Lee', 'reuniting', 'daughter', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'saccharine', 'sentimentality', 'Still', 'recommend', 'film', 'reservations']",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)

967308,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000E3L78C,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[2, 3]","Park Chanwook proved genius with Oldboy. His master-film-work and slow, suspenseful storytelling methods drove the viewers of that film to the brink, all the way up to the terrible twist of an ending. Before that, we had Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, as gritty a revenge flick as there is outside of Deathwish. And now, we have Lady Vengeance....Before I parade off on the glorifications of this film, I will simply say that this isn't what one would expect from a revenge film. There are no killing sprees, no thug-like menaces that suddenly pop up to show us what our hero is capable of. Lady Vengeance just has one angry woman who wants to get her revenge on the man who ruined her life. Sure, she does have to do a bit of searching and a bit of protecting herself--those are needed plot elements in any revenge film--but more or less the movie was something akin to the mystical journey plot archetype. It even has a theme!!!That's not to say you can't associate Lady Vengeance with the other two films in the Revenge Trilogy. Lady Vengeance has just as many memorable moments as the first two. Without spoiling much, I will say that the ending was possibly the best in all of the revenge films. It's a little more subtle, and leaves room for a lot of reflection on the viewer's part (it even has a theme!!!). Besides that, there are a couple moments between the beginning and the middle that will leave you chuckling at the screen. That's another thing that separates Lady Vengeance from the other two; it doesn't take itself as seriously. It doesn't mind throwing in some comedy, even if it offsets the suspense of the revenge-flick-archetype.Now, I won't go much into the story. Revealing too much can ruin the experience. Simply read the synopsis on the case and that's all you should need. This movie does a lot of speaking for itself. It needs to be seen to be believed, and preferably after you've already seen Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy. By itself, Lady Vengeance is great, but as an epilogue to the Vengeance Trilogy, it proves that a) Park Chanwook is a director that should be followed, and b) these films truly are masterpieces of their genre.",5,Completing a Trilogy...,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,2168,"['Park', 'Chanwook', 'proved', 'genius', 'Oldboy', 'master-film-work', 'slow', 'suspenseful', 'storytelling', 'methods', 'drove', 'viewers', 'film', 'brink', 'way', 'terrible', 'twist', 'ending', 'had', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'gritty', 'revenge', 'flick', 'Deathwish', 'now', 'have', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', '.Before', 'parade', 'off', 'glorifications', 'film', 'will', 'simply', 'say', ""n't"", 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'revenge', 'film', 'are', 'killing', 'sprees', 'thug-like', 'menaces', 'suddenly', 'up', 'show', 'hero', 'capable', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'just', 'one', 'angry', 'woman', 'who', 'get', 'revenge', 'man', 'who', 'ruined', 'life', 'Sure', 'have', 'do', 'bit', 'searching', 'bit', 'protecting', 'are', 'needed', 'plot', 'elements', 'revenge', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'akin', 'mystical', 'journey', 'plot', 'archetype', 'even', 'theme', 'not', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'associate', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'Revenge', 'Trilogy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'first', 'two', 'spoiling', 'much', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'possibly', 'best', 'revenge', 'films', 'little', 'more', 'subtle', 'room', 'lot', 'reflection', 'viewer', 'part', 'even', 'theme', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'beginning', 'middle', 'will', 'leave', 'chuckling', 'screen', 'thing', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'other', 'two', ""n't"", 'take', 'as', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'mind', 'throwing', 'comedy', 'even', 'suspense', 'revenge-flick-archetype.Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'story', 'Revealing', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'ruin', 'experience', 'Simply', 'read', 'synopsis', 'case', 'should', 'need', 'movie', 'lot', 'speaking', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'preferably', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'Oldboy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'great', 'epilogue', 'Vengeance', 'Trilogy', 'Park', 'Chanwook', 'director', 'should', 'be', 'followed', 'b', 'films', 'truly', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'genre']",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)

967313,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000E3L78C,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","Park Chan-Wook concludes his ""Vengeance Trilogy"" with another top-rate revenge thriller, this time placing a woman scorned at the head of the film. The beautiful Geum-Ja is released from prison after serving 13 years for the murder of a young boy. These 13 years have not been served in vain, however, as every minute was spent building allegiances and plotting her revenge against the man that framed her for the crime. Now, her years of planning will finally pay off as she tracks down the child-killer and instills 13 years of anger and rage into his punishment! LADY VENGEANCE is a stylistic deviation from Park's two previous films, one that touches on his more feminine expressionism. The story structure is also varied, jumping between the events of the present and the back stories of each of the characters that aid Geum-Ja in her quest for revenge. Lee Yeong-Ae puts forth a quiet and unassuming front, but beneath it lies a powerful, intelligent, and emotionally-strong woman that Lee captures perfectly in her performance. Fans of the series will recognize many familiar faces from both OLDBOY and the original SYMPATHY, with the brilliant Choi Min-Sik crossing over into the role of the sadistic villain in this entry. LADY VENGEANCE is notably lighter when it comes to the amount of action, but the humor has never been darker, the violence has never been as beautiful, and the underlying theme has never been as sinister throughout the three films.

967314,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000E3L78C,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 6]","Oldboy, while admittedly a great movie, became a lightning rod for ""overrated"" reviews when everybody started to pay attention to it. It happens all the time from popular TV shows(Lost) to music(Nirvana), there's always something that people just don't get simply because the expectations went higher than the actual film can pull off. So how do you follow it then? Easy. You do another one that can be judged on its own merits. And so we have Lady Vengeance, Chan-Wook Park's concluding film in his Vengeance trilogy. While it doesn't top Oldboy, it's still a great film that hopefully gets attention.Geum-Ja Lee was 19 when she was incarcerated for the murder of a 5 year old boy. Released 14 years later, she has her mind set on revenge. Utilizing some help from fellow prison inmates she befriended, she finds the real culprit: Mr. Baek, a schoolteacher who has some disturbing videos. Doesn't help that Geum-Ja Lee has a daughter and she has some religious implications to what she does.In watching Lady Vengeance, I never really got the feeling that I was seeing Oldboy part II. While the plot is slightly similar, I never got the feeling that there was a shameless attempt to copy that previous film since it had been so successful. In fact that's what makes the trilogy successful is that each film has unique ideas and its own niche while still carrying the same mood and approach as the others. If there is one thing the film doesn't have is certain moments like Oldboy's 3 minute fight scene or Oh Dae Su eating a live octopus or its controversial twist reveal but on a whole Lady Vengeance is a great watch.Much of what makes the film great to watch rests with Yeong-ae Lee, who shows a bit more of a tortured side than Min-sik Choi did, who was more manic and intense.  Speaking of which, he also appears as Mr Baek who carries an atypical calm about him and even manages to somehow look sympathetic, even when his crimes are revealed. The rest of the cast is pretty solid as well although one character has one of those Adam's apples you just end up staring at. Not an acting thing, but boy did it bug me.First, is it a violent film? Oddly enough, not really. Sure it does have its moments, including an offscreen shooting of a puppy and feet and a face, but most of it is either implied or shown offscreen. It is however a gorgeously shot film and the final scene and its location are very memorable. It's also got some little surreal moments such as a translated speech she gives which has some odd backgrounds and an image overlap. It's not camera trickery just for the hell of it and it helps the film have a unique look.If you loved Oldboy, or Mr Vengeance or just looking for a good drama, you can't go wrong here.",5,A great movie that hopefully doesn't get ignored,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,2734,"['Oldboy', 'admittedly', 'great', 'movie', 'became', 'lightning', 'rod', 'overrated', 'reviews', 'when', 'everybody', 'started', 'pay', 'attention', 'time', 'popular', 'TV', 'shows', 'Lost', 'music', 'Nirvana', 'always', 'something', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'simply', 'expectations', 'went', 'higher', 'actual', 'film', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'follow', 'then', 'Easy', 'do', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'so', 'have', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', 'concluding', 'film', 'Vengeance', 'trilogy', ""n't"", 'top', 'Oldboy', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'hopefully', 'attention.Geum-Ja', 'Lee', 'was', '19', 'when', 'was', 'incarcerated', 'murder', '5', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Released', '14', 'years', 'later', 'mind', 'set', 'revenge', 'Utilizing', 'help', 'fellow', 'prison', 'befriended', 'real', 'culprit', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'disturbing', 'videos', ""n't"", 'help', 'Geum-Ja', 'Lee', 'daughter', 'religious', 'implications', 'what', 'does.In', 'watching', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'seeing', 'Oldboy', 'part', 'II', 'plot', 'slightly', 'similar', 'never', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'shameless', 'attempt', 'copy', 'previous', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'successful', 'fact', 'what', 'trilogy', 'successful', 'film', 'unique', 'ideas', 'own', 'niche', 'still', 'carrying', 'same', 'mood', 'approach', 'others', 'one', 'thing', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'certain', 'moments', 'Oldboy', '3', 'minute', 'fight', 'scene', 'Oh', 'Dae', 'Su', 'eating', 'live', 'octopus', 'controversial', 'twist', 'reveal', 'whole', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'great', 'watch.Much', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'watch', 'rests', 'Yeong-ae', 'Lee', 'who', 'bit', 'more', 'tortured', 'side', 'Min-sik', 'Choi', 'did', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'manic', 'intense', 'Speaking', 'also', 'Mr', 'Baek', 'who', 'atypical', 'calm', 'even', 'manages', 'somehow', 'look', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'when', 'crimes', 'are', 'revealed', 'rest', 'cast', 'pretty', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'character', 'one', 'Adam', 'apples', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'staring', 'Not', 'acting', 'thing', 'boy', 'did', 'bug', 'me.First', 'violent', 'film', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'not', 'really', 'Sure', 'have', 'moments', 'including', 'offscreen', 'shooting', 'puppy', 'feet', 'face', 'most', 'implied', 'shown', 'offscreen', 'however', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'location', 'are', 'very', 'memorable', 'also', 'got', 'little', 'surreal', 'moments', 'such', 'translated', 'speech', 'odd', 'backgrounds', 'image', 'overlap', 'not', 'camera', 'trickery', 'just', 'hell', 'film', 'have', 'unique', 'look.If', 'loved', 'Oldboy', 'Mr', 'Vengeance', 'just', 'looking', 'good', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'here']",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)

Enter this film with the impression that is a whole new film experience and you will enjoy it......But mind you, this is a wonderful effort and a fantastic conclusion to the revenge trilogy....The DVD -2:35:1 Anamorphic WidescreenKorean Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Surround tracksEnglish and Spanish subtitlesTheatrical trailer, and some preview trailersThe rest of the extras are still not released....

967317,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000E3L78C,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 4]","Lady Vengeance is the third and final installment in Park Chan-Wook's revenge trilogy that began with Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy, and to me, the best in the series.  And all thanks to Lee Young-Ae as Lee Gum-Jaa, exuding a calm, sad, but elegant beauty.  Love that red eyeshadow, long black coat and boots!  The vengeance is justified, plotted more strategically, created like a cake per the wondrous artistic opening sequence, and the emotional poignancy more than that of Park's first two films.  And the mostly melancholy music, highlighted by the theme ""Mareta Mareta"" adds to the film's ambience.  But this movie makes more of a case for justified revenge and killing than the other two films.In the story, told with recurring flashbacks, Lee Gum-Jaa has finished serving a thirteen and a half year sentence for murdering a 5-year old boy.  Turns out though that she was forced to take the rap or else her own daughter would be murdered.  During her incarceration, she spends her time hatching up a scheme against the actual killer, Mr. Baek, the elementary school English teacher who took her in when she was pregnant, and blackmailed her by threatening to kill her daughter if she didn't take the rap.For her grand scheme, she does favours for or uses certain people.  She gives a kidney to an inmate suffering from chronic kidney disease.  She also slowly poisons the Witch, a horrible, obese predatory inmate who has a penchant for chubby females and is a terror among the other inmates.  Creating a wonderful cake out of some pathetic ingredients wows the baker Mr. Chang, who gives her a job at a bakery after her release.  And becoming Christian is just a way to reduce her sentence to show how reformed she is.  Indeed, her cold response to the warm welcome given her by the preacher who ""converted"" her at the train station is, ""Why don't you go sc--w yourself?""She finds her cute daughter Jenny living in Australia with foster parents.  Jenny can't speak a word of Korean, but nevertheless wants to go to Korea--check out the brief scene where she forces Lee Gum-Jaa to take her there.  Jenny though is a bit disgruntled, wondering why she was dumped.The turning point in the film is when Gum-Jaa is about to kill Baek and discovers he has killed other children.  It's not now a point of personal vengeance but giving the parents of the murdered children their bit of vengeance to this serial murderer.There are highly emotional bits, where Lee Gum-Jaa explains her past to Jenny, with Mr. Baek translating at gunpoint.  More disturbing is the scene where the parents of the murdered children react after seeing videos of Baek killing their offspring.It's not only the search for revenge that's key but also redemption.  Although Lee Gum-jaa's life stemmed from a great mistake she made in her youth, she perceives this pessimistic indelible brand of a sinner.  My sins are too great and deep She says of Baek, ""he made a sinner out of me,"" and when Jenny asks if she wasn't happy to meet her, Lee tearfully says ""Too happy for a sinner like me.""  She tells an inmate in her ""Christian phase"" that ""Prayer is like a scrubbing towel.  It scrubs off all your sins, then your skin will become as new as a baby's a**.""  Seems she didn't take her own advice, because she is too hard on herself.Lady Vengeance is the most stylish of the three revenge films, although maybe with some over-elaborate and indulgent bits.  The pistol made for her only shoots at very short distances, but the double barrels and ornate carvings are clearly for aesthetic purposes, but in one scene, she has enough wits to run and shoot the hand off the knife-wielding thug who's abducted Jenny.  Why not use an automatic?Symmetry:  at the beginning, the Christian preacher waiting for her encourages to eat the block of white tofu so she won't sin again.  At the end, she holds a cake with white frosting and tells her daughter to live white.  Falling snow symbolizes purity, a new start, and makes for one poignant ending to a film I've watched over and over again.",5,A tale of revenge and redemption for Lee Gum-Jaa,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,4064,"['Lady', 'Vengeance', 'third', 'final', 'installment', 'Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'revenge', 'trilogy', 'began', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'Oldboy', 'best', 'series', 'thanks', 'Lee', 'Young-Ae', 'Lee', 'Gum-Jaa', 'exuding', 'calm', 'sad', 'elegant', 'beauty', 'Love', 'red', 'eyeshadow', 'long', 'black', 'coat', 'boots', 'vengeance', 'justified', 'plotted', 'more', 'strategically', 'created', 'cake', 'wondrous', 'artistic', 'opening', 'sequence', 'emotional', 'poignancy', 'more', 'Park', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'mostly', 'melancholy', 'music', 'highlighted', 'theme', 'Mareta', 'Mareta', 'film', 'ambience', 'movie', 'more', 'case', 'justified', 'revenge', 'killing', 'other', 'two', 'films.In', 'story', 'told', 'recurring', 'flashbacks', 'Lee', 'Gum-Jaa', 'finished', 'serving', 'thirteen', 'half', 'year', 'sentence', 'murdering', '5-year', 'old', 'boy', 'out', 'was', 'forced', 'take', 'rap', 'else', 'own', 'daughter', 'would', 'be', 'murdered', 'incarceration', 'time', 'hatching', 'up', 'scheme', 'actual', 'killer', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'elementary', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'took', 'when', 'was', 'pregnant', 'blackmailed', 'threatening', 'kill', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'rap.For', 'grand', 'scheme', 'favours', 'certain', 'people', 'kidney', 'inmate', 'suffering', 'chronic', 'kidney', 'disease', 'also', 'slowly', 'poisons', 'Witch', 'horrible', 'obese', 'predatory', 'inmate', 'who', 'penchant', 'chubby', 'females', 'terror', 'other', 'inmates', 'Creating', 'wonderful', 'cake', 'pathetic', 'ingredients', 'baker', 'Mr.', 'Chang', 'who', 'job', 'bakery', 'release', 'becoming', 'Christian', 'just', 'way', 'reduce', 'sentence', 'show', 'how', 'reformed', 'Indeed', 'cold', 'response', 'warm', 'welcome', 'given', 'preacher', 'who', 'converted', 'her', 'train', 'station', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'sc', 'w', 'cute', 'daughter', 'Jenny', 'living', 'Australia', 'foster', 'parents', 'Jenny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'Korean', 'nevertheless', 'go', 'Korea', 'check', 'out', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'Lee', 'Gum-Jaa', 'take', 'there', 'Jenny', 'bit', 'disgruntled', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'dumped.The', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'Gum-Jaa', 'kill', 'Baek', 'discovers', 'killed', 'other', 'children', 'not', 'now', 'point', 'personal', 'vengeance', 'giving', 'parents', 'murdered', 'children', 'bit', 'vengeance', 'serial', 'are', 'highly', 'emotional', 'bits', 'where', 'Lee', 'Gum-Jaa', 'past', 'Jenny', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'translating', 'gunpoint', 'More', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'where', 'parents', 'murdered', 'children', 'react', 'seeing', 'videos', 'Baek', 'killing', 'offspring.It', 'not', 'only', 'search', 'revenge', 'key', 'also', 'redemption', 'Lee', 'Gum-jaa', 'life', 'stemmed', 'great', 'mistake', 'made', 'youth', 'pessimistic', 'indelible', 'brand', 'sinner', 'sins', 'are', 'too', 'great', 'deep', 'Baek', 'made', 'sinner', 'when', 'Jenny', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'meet', 'Lee', 'tearfully', 'Too', 'happy', 'sinner', 'inmate', 'Christian', 'phase', 'Prayer', 'scrubbing', 'towel', 'scrubs', 'off', 'sins', 'then', 'skin', 'will', 'become', 'as', 'new', 'baby', 'a**', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'own', 'advice', 'too', 'hard', 'herself.Lady', 'Vengeance', 'most', 'stylish', 'three', 'revenge', 'films', 'maybe', 'over-elaborate', 'indulgent', 'bits', 'pistol', 'made', 'only', 'shoots', 'very', 'short', 'distances', 'double', 'barrels', 'ornate', 'carvings', 'are', 'clearly', 'aesthetic', 'purposes', 'one', 'scene', 'enough', 'wits', 'run', 'shoot', 'hand', 'off', 'knife-wielding', 'thug', 'who', 'abducted', 'Jenny', 'Why', 'not', 'use', 'automatic', 'Symmetry', 'beginning', 'Christian', 'preacher', 'waiting', 'encourages', 'eat', 'block', 'white', 'tofu', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sin', 'again', 'end', 'cake', 'white', 'frosting', 'daughter', 'live', 'white', 'Falling', 'snow', 'symbolizes', 'purity', 'new', 'start', 'one', 'poignant', 'ending', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'over', 'again']",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)

After serving a long sentence during which she makes many friends among the inmates with her kind-hearted nature, she emerges with a thirst for vengeance on the true murderer.Director / co-writer Chan-wook Park has crafted an exhilarating, shocking conclusion to his Vengeance trilogy.  This time, the severing of parent-child bonds inspires the mayhem, and perhaps that is the most powerful motivation of all.  The richly deserving target is a serial killer of young children.  If you have young kids yourself, it may be difficult for you to watch a scene in which some of the killer's snuff films are revealed.  My son was three years old when I saw it, and I found it impossible to watch without thinking of my own child.

The film centers on the life of Geum-ja (Yeong-ae Lee); who has been convicted and sentenced to prison for murdering a child. However, there is more to the story than meets the eye. The usual unpredictable storytelling of director Park Chan-Wook has weaved another masterful revenge film. This film cannot, and should not be compared to the other two films in the trilogy. Each is different and diverges into the dark recesses of the human soul in its own way. I happen to think that this film deserves praise for its originality, and the depth of the characters in the film. Many of the actors you will recognize as those who portrayed both the protagonist's and antagonist's in the other films of the trilogy,  ""Oldboy"" and ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance.""When Geum-ja is finally released from prison after 13 years, she has appeared to have gone through a transformation in her life by converting to Christianity and earning the nickname 'The kindhearted Geum-ja."" However, while in prison she has had only one thought in her mind: REVENGE. The object of her obsession for the past 13 years has been Mr. Baek (Min-Sik Choi). Furthermore, it is her friends from prison that she enlists in her quest to seek vengeance. Yeong-ae Lee gives a tremendous performance in the film, and the films success is due in great part to her great acting. Although this film is not as violent as the first two, the story itself is very good. However, the films nuances are great, and both Geum-ja, and the rest of the characters in the film pull off great a performance in their respective roles.Also, the cinematography in this particular episode is magnificent. The array of colors and beautifully shot scenes are just terrific. Moreover, the film is more subtle than the previous two films of the trilogy, and this works well within the film. As this film has a different sort of twist on those seeking revenge, than the other two previous films had. I don't wish to spoil the film for those of you who have not seen this great film, however, its is a great film, and if you liked either of the other films, or any film with great suspenseful dramatic acting, then you will definetly like this film. However, do not go into this film expecting an ""Oldboy""' type film, this one is different. I know many who do no like ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" [even though it had a more realistic and plausible plot than ""Oldboy""] and as a result, they wound up disliking that particular film. Each of these films is a gem in its own right. I like ALL of them, each has a different story to tell, and each is uniquely great. The film is highly recommended.

967324,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000E3L78C,General Zombie,"[0, 0]","If you're reading this, odds are that you've seen some of Park Chan-Wook's other films, particularly 'Oldboy'.  Suffice to say, if you liked 'Oldboy' I can't imagine why you wouldn't like 'Lady Vengeance' as well, nor do I believe that this movie will convert you if you aren't already a fan.  A few people will try and tell you that this is actually quite different from Park's last film, but I really don't know where they get this conclusion. 'Lady Vengeance' has unusual, stylish and artfully composed shots, surrealist inserts, skewed chronology and storytelling, themes of revenge, loss, family and reunification and an unpredictable mix of abrupt violence, black humor and surprising pathos.  In short, it has all the stylistic trademarks that defined 'Oldboy'.  It does, as the film moves along, eventually venture into more purely bleak pastures somewhat reminiscent of 'Sympathy...' in tone, but overall it still reminds far more of it's direct predecessor than of that other film.  Arguably, it isn't much of a step forward from `Oldboy' in terms of style or content, but few people can pull off a film like this the way that Park can, so he's allowed to spin his wheels a bit if he so desires.`Lady Vengeance' follows the exploits of Geum-ja, a convicted child-killer who is just, as the film opens, released from prison after 13 years.  She seemed to undergo a miraculous transformation in prison, converting to Christianity and earning herself the nickname, `The kindhearted Geum-Ja.  This proves not to be a ruse, however, and upon her release Geum-ja immediately begins a quest for vengeance against one Mr. Baek, calling upon her various prison `friends' for help.  Needless to say, it gets a lot more specific than that, but I don't want to give it away, even if it is more impressive in how it is shown, rather than the particular story which is being told`Lady Vengeance' is strikingly well made and slick, particularly for a non-Hollywood film.  It's just gorgeous looking, with strong performances all around and a fine, seemingly inappropriate score which is alternately ironic and legitimately emotional. Though it's often violent and bleak, `Lady Vengeance' is simply a ton of fun to watch, particularly for the first hour or so.  It has so much energy, style and humor that it's irresistible, and more flat-out watchable and entertaining than just about anything else I've seen this year.  Furthermore, when they later go for a more serious, emotional tone, Park and company pull it off beautifully, and with out totally abandoning the flash and humor which made the first 2/3 of the movie so entertaining.  Many people will tell you that Park's films are hollow and devoid of humanity, but I don't agree.

The three films work off each other beautifully, and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance is far from a disappointment.The acting is top-notch, with cameos from Park Chanwook's first two films intermingling with new talent. The directing is superb, not quite eclipsing Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance or Oldboy but coming quite close. Park's directing style is solid and distinctive; he builds off earlier films and ideas to give an air of intensity surrounding the most innocent of scenes.SFLV cuts back on the violence and focuses on personal turmoil, a welcome change from the beginning of his revenge trilogy. My favorite elements of this movie are the use of flashbacks to tell the witty, yet complicated story, and that the film sticks to its theme of vengeance with a die-hard, unwavering dedication.  The only thing holding back from a perfect score is a slow ending, one which is necessary to bring the trilogy to a close but still slightly treading.All in all, this film represents a master finishing his masterpiece, should be viewed by everyone, and works perfectly as a separate film and not a piece of a trilogy. Violence is minimal compared to Park's first two films, but is graphic.

967328,AVGX4BYF7J559,B000E3L78C,"Jer ""kingjer151""","[1, 2]","SynopsisThe director is Park Chan-wook and he doesn't disappoint. A woman is falsely accused of murdering a boy. She spends several years in jail planning the perfect plan to murder the man that blackmailed her. Now that she's out she's out for vengeance and with the help from her friends that she made in prison she WILL carry it out.Plot RatingI've seen revenge movies and they've been good but there was something about this movie. For me it was probably her trying to reconnect with her daughter and her attitude at getting what she wants. There's always something about a double barreled gun that needs to be used at close range that lights up my crotch. I like the flashbacks that they did to show how she was before she got out of jail and the connections she's made in order to get to blackmailer. I give the plot a 9 out of 10.Actors/ActressesI'm only going to focus on one person because the movie is mainly about her. Yeong-ae Lee plays Geum-ja Lee and she carries the movie. We see her as a hurt, vengeful woman who will stop at nothing to kill the person who sent her to jail. There are also flashbacks of a sweet, kind, nice woman who is friends to all. We also have a woman who is trying to reconnect with the daughter she lost so many years ago. All of these roles are played very well and incorporated into the story at the right moment.I give the acting a 10/10DVD ExtrasThe DVD comes to us from Tartan Video and the extras are very enjoyable. We've got an interview with the director. ""The making of Lady Vengeance."" A commentary by the director, art director, and cinematographer. A commentary by Richard Pena and international and U.S trailer. So in all, we have a a lot of stuff to watch and keep us entertained. I give the extras a 10/10Personal ThoughtsLady vengeance is one of those movies that you can watch again and again. The story is great for a revenge movie and the ending is interesting. Something that I didn't expect but oh so very nice. The relationship that Geum-ja Lee forms with her daughter is touching and you can see that she tries to be a good mother. The relationships that she forms are interesting  and play a key role in her getting her man.This movie is top class and one of Park Chan-wooks finest. That's why this movie gets a 29/30.

Lady Vengeance is definitely not the best of the three but it was still one sick flick. Let's set it off, the film starts out just a little slow and a little weird and even more weird than the other two. Lee Geum-ja who was wrongly put in prison for murder is finally getting out. While inside she basically goes from a sweet and innocent girl to a rather cold and vengeful nutcase. Though she has developed a much thicker skin over the years she still holds a bit of a soft spot but trust me when I say just a bit.Geum-ja has nothing but time to think of all that has happened and of course it has driven her crazy. She wants to see her daughter that she has not seen since she was an infant. Most of all she wants revenge on the man that locked her away for 13 years. Not the cop that put her away but the man that basically brainwashed her into taking the case for him. Mr. Baek who was well I guess you could say Geum-ja's much older boyfriend is the spawn of her insanity. He is slowly revealed as a very sick and sadistic man and wait until you find out what he does for a living. Baek has been on Geum-ja's mind everyday since she went in. It's weird how their relationship began but trust me when I say that it ends on some pretty cold terms but nobody ever said vengeance is a warm meal, right?Honestly I don't want to say much more about the movie cause I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Chan-wook is definitely a mastermind at making a film build to its climax. In all three of these films some could maybe figure out what's going to happen and most likely you will in this one. The thing is that the movie ending is written and executed so well that you are not disappointed at all. I loved the actors, some of them were even in one or two of the other films. Lee Young Ae who played Geum-ja was amazing playing her character. I don't know if you can find anyone else who could have played a such a cold blooded woman who still had a bit of a warm heart so well. The entire time you still felt sorry for her character but still wanted her to do whatever to get her revenge because she deserved it.I give ""Lady Vengeance"" 4 stars for a couple of reasons. One reason is that I hated but loved the pacing. I say pacing but it could have been the music and overall settings that some scenes become a bit boring. That look Geum-ja had on her face got to be a little bit of a pain. Unlike the main character from Oldboy, that mystery missing from this one made the movie a little less interesting. Basically the only thing you're waiting for from the film is to see how she gets her revenge. I guess after seeing this from two others you want some new stuff.Now the movie is still very good but it is not on the level of the other two, at least not to me. The positives are that the acting is very good and the ending is crazy good. I say that if you're a fan then definitely get it cause you have to but for you starters out there, start from the beginning. At least you will know what you're dealing with instead of just being thrown into the crazy mind of Park Chan-wook.",4,Those Are The Eyes Of Revenge,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,3183,"['last', 'Vengeance', 'Trilogy', 'also', 'last', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'three', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'three', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'sick', 'flick', 'Let', 'set', 'off', 'film', 'out', 'just', 'little', 'slow', 'little', 'weird', 'even', 'more', 'weird', 'other', 'two', 'Lee', 'Geum-ja', 'who', 'was', 'wrongly', 'put', 'prison', 'murder', 'finally', 'getting', 'out', 'basically', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'girl', 'rather', 'cold', 'vengeful', 'nutcase', 'developed', 'much', 'thicker', 'skin', 'years', 'still', 'bit', 'soft', 'spot', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'just', 'bit.Geum-ja', 'nothing', 'time', 'think', 'happened', 'course', 'driven', 'crazy', 'see', 'daughter', 'not', 'seen', 'was', 'infant', 'Most', 'revenge', 'man', 'locked', 'away', '13', 'years', 'Not', 'cop', 'put', 'away', 'man', 'basically', 'brainwashed', 'taking', 'case', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'who', 'was', 'well', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'Geum-ja', 'much', 'older', 'boyfriend', 'spawn', 'insanity', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'very', 'sick', 'sadistic', 'man', 'wait', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'living', 'Baek', 'been', 'Geum-ja', 'mind', 'everyday', 'went', 'weird', 'how', 'relationship', 'began', 'when', 'say', 'pretty', 'cold', 'terms', 'nobody', 'ever', 'said', 'vengeance', 'warm', 'meal', 'right', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'Chan-wook', 'definitely', 'mastermind', 'making', 'film', 'build', 'climax', 'three', 'films', 'could', 'maybe', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'ending', 'written', 'executed', 'so', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'disappointed', 'loved', 'actors', 'were', 'even', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'Lee', 'Young', 'Ae', 'who', 'played', 'Geum-ja', 'was', 'amazing', 'playing', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'find', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'such', 'cold', 'blooded', 'woman', 'who', 'still', 'had', 'bit', 'warm', 'heart', 'so', 'well', 'entire', 'time', 'still', 'felt', 'sorry', 'character', 'still', 'wanted', 'do', 'get', 'revenge', 'deserved', 'it.I', 'give', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', '4', 'stars', 'couple', 'reasons', 'One', 'reason', 'hated', 'loved', 'pacing', 'say', 'pacing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'music', 'overall', 'settings', 'scenes', 'become', 'bit', 'boring', 'look', 'Geum-ja', 'had', 'face', 'got', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'pain', 'main', 'character', 'Oldboy', 'missing', 'one', 'made', 'movie', 'little', 'less', 'interesting', 'Basically', 'only', 'thing', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'revenge', 'guess', 'seeing', 'two', 'others', 'want', 'new', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'level', 'other', 'two', 'least', 'not', 'positives', 'are', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'ending', 'crazy', 'good', 'say', ""'re"", 'fan', 'then', 'definitely', 'get', 'cause', 'have', 'starters', 'there', 'start', 'beginning', 'least', 'will', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'thrown', 'crazy', 'mind', 'Park', 'Chan-wook']",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)
967332,A215P8Z08ZXN79,B000E3L78C,knvmxi,"[1, 3]","the premise of the movie is great. the way the director opens up the story and builds the history and narrative is very interesting. the characters are interesting. It could have been a lot tighter though because I think there are sentimental distractions - like the reappearance of her daughter. It would have been better if the missing child remained missing and she was sort of a mystery that really fuelled her vengeance and the audience would be carried along with that feeling - it would create a sense of tension with the audience that was more authentic. I think that the catharsis he creates with the parents of dead children killing the teacher is okay. They're a little too emotional - my favourite was the grandmother who was the final vengeance taker because I felt that through her lack of histrionics she was more compelling and evinced greater authentic emotion than the other parents who were crying or having emotional fits. I would say less is more. You cannot ever really know the mix of feelings such a context would cause, and trying to outline them via acting comes out a bit superficially which why the external stoicism of the grandmother seemed more genuine. I think of an actress like Gong Li in Raise the Red Lantern. She was able to evince so much internal turmoil with great subtlety and finesse - she is an amazing &#34;less is more&#34; actor. I think it that the film is quite silly sometimes, like when the director tries to show the main character is struggling morally. She seems like 5 different people in one and the director can't really decide which she is suppose to be and while I think that she should be portrayed in all her complexity, I'm not sure it was done well here. Perhaps it was the way the film flashed back and forth between her history and present, reality and fantasy. I think of a director like Darren Aronofsky who is amazing at this but creates a very tight and cohesive narrative eve, and I think it was just done less well here. The one thing about this director is that I think he builds a great story but really falls short when it comes to the &#34;reason&#34; for why such a crazy story exists. Like in Old Boy, the story was so great and you were like what is the mystery, why is this happening to him.

Sympathy was my favorite of them all that was a fantastic movie and also my 2nd favorite Korean film. Lady Vengeance didn't bring me into the story so much and I don't know why. It's strange and kind of reminds me of a Quentin Tarantino film and I absolutely have never enjoyed his cartoonish movies. I've seen a lot of them (how can you not) but of them all, none have I ever liked(don't worry I never review his movies just because I know I don't like his work so you Tarantino fans can rest).I've been trying to finish this movie for almost a year now, and I just don't care to see the rest. The movie floats around between serious,ridiculous,humorous, and WTF is going on? This movie just didn't seem real to me. Even if a movie is a movie and it can be fantasy,fiction,sci-fi or whatever. What makes it a good movie is when you can make those subjects seem real and almost possible to the viewer. When you show someone something that's just unbelievable or really out of place it just makes you feel like you're watching a movie.

Out of the trilogy I have seenOldboy (Three-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition), which i liked very much, i found this to be superior in every way, a masterpiece.I will not go into any detail or spoil anything this movie is a rare treat and I wouldn't want to spoil any minute so I will give you the basic premises a beautiful woman Geum-ja Lee played perfectly by Yeong-ae Lee is wrongly imprisoned at the age of 18 for 13 years, so begins her plan of 13 years for revenge on the real criminal.I believe this movie is all about choices and what is right and wrong.  Are gods laws right?  Are mans laws right?  Lady Vengeance let's you analyze and decide that for yourself well after the credits roll.On the cover it says ""The best revenge thriller since Kill Bill.""  Kill bill was very good and entertaining movie, this movie goes deeper like all great movies it stays with you, you experience this film, it seeps into your subconscious, becomes one of your memories.  I also enjoyed the Kill Bill's and as a drama and a thriller i believe it is better than both of them combined, however Kill Bill is superior on the action side of things.This film is something you could debate and analyze it has deep meanings but it is also just a great story which keeps you guessing and at times can shock you while others make you laugh.The score is beautiful to match the movie, the cinematography, and the transfer.  Geum-ja Lee is referred to as an angel i believe she was an angel of vengeance and wrath.  There is a beautiful shot at the end we get a god's eye view camera angle as snow falls onto three faces 2 open there mouths as if to receive communion from the white pure snow, but who doesn't?  Was justice served?  I think so.Lady Vengeance was also on Reel's website on their top 10 of 2006, Was also on one of the editors at IFC's.  It also has me rethinking which movie to drop from my personal top 10 of 2006 to make room for this gem.Thanks for reading, share any thoughts.DVD Special features (from the back of the dvd)-Interview with director Park Chan-Wook-The making of Lady Vengeance-Audio Commentary by Director Park Chan-Wook-Audio Commentary by Director, Cinematographer, and art dirctor-Audio Commentary by Richard Pena- Program Editor, film society of Lincoln -Center, and associate professor of film, Columbia University-International and U.S. theatrical Trailers-English and Spanish subtitles",5,**Justice and choices**  There are no spoilers in this review.

967337,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,B000E3L78C,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[7, 9]","Park Chan-Wook has been exploring the ramifications of vengeance and its ability to tear people apart as they quest to heal past wrongs in four films now--from _Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance_ to _Oldboy_, to ""Cut"" (his contribution to _Three Extremes_) and finally this one, full title _Sympathy for Lady Vengeance_.The full title is aptly reminiscent of the first of this series, for while its style seems to continue ideas like_Oldboy_ and ""Cut,"" _Lady Vengeance_ definitely takes its issues and pathos from the first film.  _Oldboy_ and ""Cut"" are more of an examination of the victimization vengeance creates, as well as the psychological drives towards vengeance, especially when there is no great cause to rectify.  In those films, the drives for vengeance are based more in psychological deficiencies rather than a righteous sense of justice.  In _Oldboy_, Oh is kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, and the movie then examines what this plan of vengeance against him is and what it does to his life.  The crime he supposedly committed is, in the end, small, and so the concept of vengeance is handled in that film as a conduit to outwardly express other psychological needs.  ""Cut"" is much in the same vein, with a famous pianist subjected to an elaborate plan of revenge for a relatively insignificant crime.  Both films are very fancy in their cinematic approaches.But _Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance_ takes a much more pared down and immediate route of relating to events, and the plot involved more righteous vengeance, if you will.  And more than that, it explored the relationships among several people who all have reason to want to take vengeance on each other, which makes that film one of the more superior takes on vengeance, and _Lady Vengeance_ follows much in this vein.  Geum-Ja is incarcerated for 15 years for kidnapping and killing a young boy, but claims she is not truly guilty and instead has someone to take vengeance on for her prison time.  While in prison, she fashions together a network of supporters who will help her carry out her plan when free.But of course, her plan proves to be much more complex and intricate as the movie continues.  It turns out that Geum-Ja had a daughter who was given away for adoption, has met a boy who is of the same age as the boy she was jailed for killing, and her target has a lot more people who would like to get their licks in as well.While very stylized in its approach, with some intriguing visual effects, _Lady Vengeance_ takes a page more from the first of its series, where resolution is not so easy, and characters are wonderfully troubling in how they are justified in action but troubled and punished for their righteous action.  The two _Sympathy_ movies are clearly the height of Park Chan-Wook's powers for exploring a theme as old as _Hamlet_: the intricacies and problems with vengeance.",5,A height of Park's powers,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,2874,"['Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'been', 'exploring', 'ramifications', 'vengeance', 'ability', 'tear', 'people', 'apart', 'quest', 'heal', 'past', 'wrongs', 'four', 'films', 'now', '_Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance_', '_Oldboy_', 'Cut', 'contribution', '_Three', 'Extremes_', 'finally', 'one', 'full', 'title', '_Sympathy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance_.The', 'full', 'title', 'aptly', 'reminiscent', 'first', 'series', 'style', 'continue', 'ideas', 'like_Oldboy_', 'Cut', '_Lady', 'Vengeance_', 'definitely', 'issues', 'pathos', 'first', 'film', '_Oldboy_', 'Cut', 'are', 'more', 'examination', 'victimization', 'vengeance', 'as', 'well', 'psychological', 'drives', 'towards', 'vengeance', 'especially', 'when', 'great', 'cause', 'rectify', 'films', 'drives', 'vengeance', 'are', 'based', 'more', 'psychological', 'deficiencies', 'rather', 'righteous', 'sense', 'justice', '_Oldboy_', 'Oh', 'kidnapped', 'imprisoned', 'fifteen', 'years', 'movie', 'then', 'what', 'plan', 'vengeance', 'what', 'life', 'crime', 'supposedly', 'committed', 'end', 'small', 'so', 'concept', 'vengeance', 'handled', 'film', 'conduit', 'outwardly', 'express', 'other', 'psychological', 'needs', 'Cut', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'famous', 'pianist', 'subjected', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'revenge', 'relatively', 'insignificant', 'crime', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'fancy', 'cinematic', 'approaches.But', '_Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance_', 'much', 'more', 'pared', 'down', 'immediate', 'route', 'relating', 'events', 'plot', 'involved', 'more', 'righteous', 'vengeance', 'will', 'more', 'explored', 'relationships', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'reason', 'want', 'take', 'vengeance', 'other', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'superior', 'vengeance', '_Lady', 'Vengeance_', 'much', 'vein', 'Geum-Ja', 'incarcerated', '15', 'years', 'kidnapping', 'killing', 'young', 'boy', 'claims', 'not', 'truly', 'guilty', 'instead', 'someone', 'take', 'vengeance', 'prison', 'time', 'prison', 'together', 'network', 'supporters', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'carry', 'out', 'plan', 'when', 'free.But', 'course', 'plan', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'intricate', 'movie', 'out', 'Geum-Ja', 'had', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'adoption', 'met', 'boy', 'who', 'same', 'age', 'boy', 'was', 'jailed', 'killing', 'target', 'lot', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'licks', 'well.While', 'very', 'stylized', 'approach', 'intriguing', 'visual', 'effects', '_Lady', 'Vengeance_', 'page', 'more', 'first', 'series', 'where', 'resolution', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'troubling', 'how', 'are', 'justified', 'action', 'troubled', 'punished', 'righteous', 'action', 'two', '_Sympathy_', 'movies', 'are', 'clearly', 'height', 'Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'powers', 'exploring', 'theme', 'as', 'old', '_Hamlet_', 'intricacies', 'problems', 'vengeance']",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)

967340,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000E3L78C,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Lady Vengeance (Chan-wook Park, 2005)In 2000, Chan-wook Park, a relatively obscure director, and Yeon-ae Lee, a young actress, teamed up for JSA: Joint Security Area, the movie that shot both of them to stardom in their native Korea. Park was to explode onto the international scene with Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the multiple-award-winning Oldboy; Lee continued being popular in Korea, but not so much outside it. All that changed when Park brought her back in to be the lead in Lady Vengeance, the final installment of his revenge trilogy. Poof--instant international stardom!As with the other revenge films, Lady Vengeance has as its main character a person who has been wrongly imprisoned. In this case, it's Geum-Ja (Lee), who went to prison for kidnap and murder for thirteen years. Now she's out, and she wants revenge. In order to get it, she enlists the help of a number of previously-released prison inmates who'd grown fond of her while they were incarcerated together, and the bunch put together an elaborate plan for the real killer's demise.It's a fun movie, as long as you're not turned off by a pervasive suggestion of violence (not a great deal of which is actually shown, in contrast to Oldboy). It's very straightforward, which lends the movie a somewhat deliberate pace; there aren't any red herrings being tossed around. We just have Geum-Ja's single-minded devotion to revenge, her plan, and its execution, on the plot side of things. This gives Park time to develop a number of the characters in interesting ways, especially Geum-Ja; interwoven with the flashback scenes of prison life are a number of earlier scenes that give us a sense of who she is as a person, and the extent to which prison changed her. Or did it? Were all her selfless acts in prison, where she was known as an angel, geared towards making allies to help her with her plan (which, at one point, she said began the day she went to prison)? We're never explicitly told, but in the end, it's a secondary consideration; the revenge is what matters.

Unfortunately, she is actually innocent of the crime, but confessed to keep her own child safe from the real kidnapper and murderer. She became infamous as a monster with an angelic face. While in jail, she very publicly found religion and helped many other women. When she was released from jail, she takes steps to put her life back together and exact her revenge against Mr. Baek, the man who kidnapped and threatened her child. Geum-Ja slowly and carefully puts together her revenge by calling in as many favors as she can with the inmates she helped while reconnecting with her daughter.Geum-Ja is viewed and judged by many people throughout the film, but few know her for who she really is. First, she is known as a monster after confessing to the kidnapping and murder of the little boy. The case is sensationalized, shown by the particular vigor and excitement the press had when she re-enacted the murder scene and the way the public romanticizes her by mimicking her fashion. Of course, she is characterized in this way because of the stereotypical view of women as meek, maternal, and loving and because of her beauty and air of innocence. This crime flies in the face of all of that and would not have made such a splash if a man been charged of the same crime. The public is obviously both fascinated and appalled with Geum-Ja and her heinous crime.Once in jail, Geum-Ja turns her entire image around. After finding religion and publicly advocating for the healing power of prayer in jail, she helps many of her fellow inmates in significant ways. She poisons the prison bully with bleach over the course of three years to save the women she harrassed; a heartsick inmate finds solace, healing, and a kidney with her; she takes care of an elderly ex-spy with Alzheimer's when no one else wants to; and she comforted and supported other women as well. Her new nickname became ""Kind Hearted Geum-Ja"" and she is widely viewed as a saint. Another inmate even remembers her serene face radiating divine light. All of Geum-Ja's kind acts seem selfless, but she carefully gained these women's favor in order to call in favors after she got out of prison.Once out of prison, Geum-Ja's image changes again. Outside the prison, she rejects and alienates the religious that see her as a role model. She wears blood red eyeshadow and dresses in black to destroy her kind hearted reputation. Her beatific smile and all pretense of serenity are gone. Every single person she sees comments on either her change of dress or demeanor because it is so vastly different than the saintly persona she adopted in prison. Geum-Ja tries to put together some semblance of a life by working at a bakery and reconnecting with her daughter while putting together her long planned revenge by calling on the help of the women in her debt. Revenge is within her grasp when she realizes there was more than one child victim. She gets the families together, shows them proof that Mr. Baek killed their children, and offers them the chance to either turn him in to the police or exact a more personal vengeance.Through most of the film, Geum-Ja is defined by the perception of those around her, but she actually isn't completely good or evil. She is a flawed person who makes mistakes, but does what she thinks is right. Her 14 year vengeance plan worked, but in a different way than she envisioned. She sacrificed her own need for vengeance so that the people most hurt by him could exact theirs. This is the moment where she truly commits a selfless act of kindness. Afterwards, her new life is started with a clean slate, symbolized by the white cake she buries her face in.Everything in the film works together beautifully. Yeong-ae Lee's performance as Geum-Ja is amazing. She captures each stage of Geum-Ja's story perfectly captures the emotions of each scene with her facial expressions. I was blown away by her range and depth as she carried much of the film on her own. The score, both the adapted baroque pieces and newly composed, adds an elegance that matches the beautiful cinematography. I highly recommend this brutal, but ultimately hopeful film.",5,Beautiful and brutal film,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,4268,"['19', 'year', 'old', 'Geum-Ja', 'Lee', 'kidnapping', 'murder', 'young', 'boy', 'thirteen', 'half', 'years', 'prison', 'Unfortunately', 'actually', 'innocent', 'crime', 'confessed', 'keep', 'own', 'child', 'safe', 'real', 'kidnapper', 'murderer', 'became', 'infamous', 'monster', 'angelic', 'face', 'jail', 'very', 'publicly', 'found', 'religion', 'helped', 'many', 'other', 'women', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'jail', 'steps', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'exact', 'revenge', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'man', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'threatened', 'child', 'Geum-Ja', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'together', 'revenge', 'calling', 'as', 'many', 'favors', 'can', 'inmates', 'helped', 'reconnecting', 'daughter.Geum-Ja', 'viewed', 'judged', 'many', 'people', 'film', 'few', 'know', 'who', 'really', 'First', 'known', 'monster', 'confessing', 'kidnapping', 'murder', 'little', 'boy', 'case', 'sensationalized', 'shown', 'particular', 'vigor', 'excitement', 'press', 'had', 'when', 're-enacted', 'murder', 'scene', 'way', 'public', 'mimicking', 'fashion', 'course', 'characterized', 'way', 'stereotypical', 'view', 'women', 'meek', 'maternal', 'loving', 'beauty', 'air', 'innocence', 'crime', 'face', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'splash', 'man', 'been', 'charged', 'same', 'crime', 'public', 'obviously', 'fascinated', 'appalled', 'Geum-Ja', 'heinous', 'crime.Once', 'jail', 'Geum-Ja', 'entire', 'image', 'around', 'finding', 'religion', 'publicly', 'advocating', 'healing', 'power', 'prayer', 'jail', 'many', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'significant', 'ways', 'prison', 'bully', 'bleach', 'course', 'three', 'years', 'save', 'women', 'harrassed', 'heartsick', 'inmate', 'solace', 'healing', 'kidney', 'care', 'elderly', 'ex-spy', 'Alzheimer', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'comforted', 'supported', 'other', 'women', 'well', 'new', 'nickname', 'became', 'Kind', 'Hearted', 'Geum-Ja', 'widely', 'viewed', 'saint', 'inmate', 'even', 'serene', 'face', 'radiating', 'divine', 'light', 'Geum-Ja', 'kind', 'seem', 'selfless', 'carefully', 'gained', 'women', 'favor', 'order', 'call', 'favors', 'got', 'out', 'prison.Once', 'prison', 'Geum-Ja', 'image', 'changes', 'again', 'prison', 'religious', 'see', 'role', 'model', 'blood', 'red', 'eyeshadow', 'dresses', 'black', 'destroy', 'kind', 'hearted', 'reputation', 'beatific', 'smile', 'pretense', 'serenity', 'are', 'gone', 'single', 'person', 'comments', 'change', 'dress', 'demeanor', 'so', 'vastly', 'different', 'saintly', 'adopted', 'prison', 'Geum-Ja', 'tries', 'put', 'together', 'semblance', 'life', 'working', 'bakery', 'reconnecting', 'daughter', 'putting', 'together', 'long', 'planned', 'revenge', 'calling', 'help', 'women', 'debt', 'Revenge', 'grasp', 'when', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'child', 'victim', 'families', 'together', 'proof', 'Mr.', 'Baek', 'killed', 'children', 'chance', 'turn', 'police', 'exact', 'more', 'personal', 'most', 'film', 'Geum-Ja', 'defined', 'perception', 'actually', ""n't"", 'completely', 'good', 'evil', 'flawed', 'person', 'who', 'mistakes', 'what', 'right', '14', 'year', 'vengeance', 'plan', 'worked', 'different', 'way', 'envisioned', 'sacrificed', 'own', 'need', 'vengeance', 'so', 'people', 'most', 'hurt', 'could', 'exact', 'moment', 'where', 'truly', 'commits', 'selfless', 'act', 'kindness', 'Afterwards', 'new', 'life', 'started', 'clean', 'slate', 'symbolized', 'white', 'cake', 'face', 'in.Everything', 'film', 'together', 'beautifully', 'Yeong-ae', 'Lee', 'performance', 'Geum-Ja', 'amazing', 'stage', 'Geum-Ja', 'story', 'perfectly', 'emotions', 'scene', 'facial', 'expressions', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'range', 'depth', 'carried', 'much', 'film', 'own', 'score', 'adapted', 'baroque', 'pieces', 'newly', 'composed', 'elegance', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'highly', 'recommend', 'brutal', 'ultimately', 'hopeful', 'film']",Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005)

Trying to take Old Boy and Sympathy for Mr. V. and group the three does make the tale weaker in ways, but the tale also has its strong points and is a different tale altogether. It deals with threats and missing children, and with a woman that networked while behind bars in order to become the thing she needed to be. While behind bars she was a model of transformation, becoming everything that was asked of her. She also made friends by taking up for the weak and the needy, doing some fairly terrible things in order to seutre friendships. and, when she found herself released, she called upon these people because she needed something. She needed something she designed in jail, and way to make herself untouchable after her plan went into effect, and other things that were unexpected from such a great person.The mask must have been heavy, I kept thinking, and the years must have been long. In some ways that made me pity the person that she was thinking about taking her frustrations out on.As far as the movie goes, the script was great, the twists were superb, and the end was one that I really didn't see coming. The counterpart to our Lady was equally well-acted, as were the people that we ran across during our tale. Considering the reviews i saw in the newspapaer this surprised me, but more surprising was the way the story was touching and made you side with Lady V. The staging of all the horrible things that the movie provies are equally as good, and - taken by itself - it is a great watch. In fact, it could be argued that this movie spoke in a different tone than the other movies spoke in, and this was why some people different understand that it was a different taste altogether.If you liked the two other movies, check this out and make sure not to copmpare these. See it as stand-alone and compare it to itself, and you'll see something that it transfixing and beautifully done. I say this because i started out doing exactly what I am saying not to do, and I think I missed out on the stand-alone portion of the movie because of that. Even if you did not like the other movies for some reason, you might find this to your liking. It has violence and it has blood, but the horrors seen here are not as gruesome as some of the things I saw before. Instead of being a machine, our lead was a widow waiting in the web, and all the little fibers are beautiful to see as they are spun.I really recommend the movie - it isn't a third movie but is instead a thing unto itself.

As with OLDBOY, I'm left with a curious predicament after watching LADY VENGEANCE. I've found another movie I LOVE, yet I can't recommend it to anyone I know. With OLDBOY, this was because of the violence, the sustained intensity, and because of a scene involving sushi.  (each of these elements, I argue, were ESSENTIAL to the story being told) Now, with LADY VENGEANCE, it's because of the harrowing, unblinking depiction of kidnapped children and their parents. (And the violence, of course.)  And for the director's use of humor and the absurd.  He always manages to pull it off, even when my initial reaction is shock and uncertainty, I almost always end up admiring his choices. Almost everything about this film is spot-on- the performances, the pace, the flashbacks, the subversion of expectations, the use of silence, the use of sound, the editing choices... almost never becoming style over substance. My only gripes are with the special effects in a dream sequences, which jolted me out of the spell cast by the rest of the film. However, a disturbing dream DOES jolt the dreamer out of established patterns. A sound choice which just didn't work for me b/c I was distracted figuring out how the dream image was created, and whether or not it looked fake. I also questioned the use of the characters of the adoptive parents. I'm sure there was a point but it didn't present itself to me and instead I was distracted. One of the things I most admired about this film is there WAS no ultraviolent payoff. This was a different view(s) of grief, loss and vengeance. I can see where some gorehounds might feel cheated by this, but, I found it rewarding. I was reminded of how I've felt watching certain Hitchcock films for the first time- being led to wonder if I really WANTED to see someone meet a violent end and, if so, how did I FEEL about wanting that.

967346,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000E3L78C,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[8, 8]","LADY VENGEANCE (aka. Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) is the third installment in Park Chan-Wook's ""vengeance"" trilogy, among of which my favorite is the terrific ""Oldboy"" and the first film """"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"".  These three films have different plotlines and characters; the only thing that ties them together is their similar themes about suffering, revenge and redemption (or the goal for redemption). Fans of the franchise will undoubtedly compare this to ""Oldboy"" since it cemented Park Chan-Wook's status as a frontrunner of Korean cinema and catapulted him to international stardom beside Kim Ki-Duk and Hong Sang-Soo.  One thing with Oldboy and Lady Vengeance (in my opinion are the two best ones of the series); Oldboy is like a shot of the finest Tequila and Lady Vengeance is similar to a shot of the smoothest cognac. Oldboy is scorching fire while Lady Vengeance is ice cold.Plot synopsis derived from DVD back cover:After being wrongfully convicted of kidnapping and murdering a young child, a beautiful young woman (Lee Young-ae) is imprisoned for 13 years and forced to give up her own daughter. While in prison, she gains the respect and loyalty of her fellow cellmates. While in prison, she plots her vendetta on the man responsible for her imprisonment. A man called Baek (Oldboy's Choi Min-Sik). Upon her release she sets in motion an elaborate plan of retribution, but what she discovers is a truth so horrifying, even revenge doesn't seem punishment enough...Park Chan-Wook has the skill to shock and disturb audiences and Korean critics alike with his style and themes, but he doesn't resort to such exploitative lengths as most Japanese film-makers. Lady Vengeance expands more of subtle character study of Geum-ja (Lee Young-ae, she plays goody character in Dae Jang Geum). I believe the film is divided into 3 parts of a whole.  First, with a series of flashbacks, Geum-ja is shown as a woman who has found religion while in prison. She becomes well-liked by other inmates and a model prisoner during her 13-year tenure. She is seen as kind, and develops superb baking skills during this period. Finally, she is revealed to be planning an elaborate revenge against Mr. Baek and enlists the aid of her fellow inmates in orchestrating the plan. The 2nd part is Geum-ja pulls a 180 turn from her reputation in prison; she begins to implement her plan into action with the aid of a retired cop. The 3rd part is the emotional/spiritual aftermath of her vengeance against Mr. Baek.Geum-ja's character is very calculating but very reserved. Her goal for redemption is expressed with her search for her daughter (adopted by an Australian couple); one may say that her child embodies the good things left in her. She is alluring, cool but sorrowful. Lee Young-Ae's performance is excellent; she does a sort of ""femme fatale"" portrayal of her character. Geum-ja embodies the sheer determination of a person in a difficult situation who has a vision for redemption, but not after she has ""closure"" from the wronged done her. Geum-ja has become her own mission. She admits her sins and looks for atonement while at the same time plots sheer revenge. Two contrasting human characteristics are explored, which is the real Geum-ja?Park Chan-Wook's direction is the work of an artist; evolves before our very eyes while improving the finesse and style of the screenplay itself. Fans may complain that Lady Vengeance may lack the sheer intensity, grittiness and toughness of its predecessors but I think it would unfair to expect Park to repeat the raw impact of Oldboy with its uncompromising twists. Lady Vengeance may be a bit slower paced and ""gentler"" with its style. Park also uses some subtle symbolism embodied with a man-faced dog with a bullet entering its brow and exiting its ""vital"" genitalia. It has a great, even feel and the proceedings stay grounded. Choi Min-Sik's performance is also note-worthy; he establishes a truly sadistic but pitiable portrayal of Baek. He plays it with a disturbing normalcy despite the character's twisted nature.The film has its potential flaws; some may feel that the different tone in the 3rd act steers the screenplay a bit off course. It changes its focus to many; some viewers may see the 3rd act as equivalent to an ""AA"" gathering. However, I rather think it is meant as an expression of Geum-ja's realization that her selfish vengeance should not be that important nor her main focus. The third act is both darkly funny and engrossing. Viewers will have to keep in mind that this is a character study (of sorts) up till its closing credits.It is to be noted that the film's way of handling violence is a different from its predecessors; much of it occurs off-camera than full view. I think this approach is handled well and delivers a more profound effect. Park considers the situation and succeeds in delivering the violence on a more personal level. I will stop here because with this film, the less you know about the proceedings then the more you'll appreciate its vision.LADY VENGEANCE successfully closes Park's vengeance trilogy. This trilogy will definitely find its mark as one of the most engaging bits of film-making. I've read that Park is usually accused of making films mostly with his brain and not his heart, I guess that's why he made ""I'm a Cyborg, and that's ok"". Park is now assured that every film he makes will be anticipated by fans and critics alike.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  + stars]",5,Vengeance is a dish best served COLD!
