485635,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6305971196,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Scandal, 1989 filmThis is based on a true story from Great Britain in 1963. The story begins in 1959 London. There is a theater with showgirls. Dr. Ward dances with a girl. He drives by Christine Keeler's parents home. [Background check?] Ward brings Christine to an aristocrat's mansion, the famous Cliveden. Christine works as a dancer. Ward offers her a room in his cottage. A crowd celebrates the Conservative Party election victory. There is a party at Ward's cottage. ""You're the doctor."" There is another dancer on the stage. They meet high society and visit exclusive clubs. Their activities are being observed. A man from MI-5 offers suggestions to Ward. Christine meets Profumo. A typical weekend at Cliveden? Ivanov notes that Profumo, a Cabinet minister, cheats at games. Ward asks Christine about her night with Eugene. Ward reports the events to Mr. Woods at MI-5.These people visit a new place. Later Christine meets Profumo at her place, Ward's cottage. Then Ivanov visits her. Later there is another party. Mandy has a boyfriend. Christine visits Profumo again. He wants to find a new place for her away from Dr. Ward (who talks too much). Christine has another boyfriend. There is a disturbance. Then a shooting at Dr. Ward's cottage. This attracts newspaper publicity and Ward's anger. ""Take me home."" ""It's over."" A newspaper reporter talks to her. This story creates a scandal among the high and mighty. ""She must be stopped."" Will someone have to take the blame? Christine's friends warn her against Ward. Christine talks to the press again - about Profumo. Profumo tells Parliament ""there was no impropriety"". Scotland Yard investigates Ward's friends. Now his friends drop him. Ward is evicted from his low-rent cottage. The police question Christine. Profumo resigns because of the scandal. ""I lied."" Ivanov is recalled to Moscow.Was there a security risk? [This was after the Cuban Missile Crisis.] Who will be blamed as a scapegoat? Ward tells Christine of his schoolboy past, blamed for something he didn't do. His rich and powerful friends now avoid him. The police have 147 witnesses against Ward. Mandy tells the court about her sex partners; Lord Astor paid her rent. ""Well he would, wouldn't he?"" Christine is advised to tell the truth. She does. Her newspaper story was written by a journalist. ""This is not fair!"". Dr. Ward is repelled by the unwanted attention. He writes a note and swallows a lot of pills. His cigarette falls to the wood floor. Ward was convicted of living from the earnings of a prostitute. Later Prime Minister MacMillan resigned, a new government was elected.Would there have been a scandal if that Government official dallied with a girl from his own class? This scandal received attention in America. Was there a high government official who could have been compromised by his involvement with actresses and showgirls? Wasn't there a Governor who died in the presence of a young woman who was not a relative? Would Hollywood make a movie about this? Does the phrase ""Society Doctor"" refer to someone who will treat a disease and not report it to the health authorities? Or perform an operation that was illegal then?",3,The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,3176,"['Scandal', '1989', 'filmThis', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Great', 'Britain', '1963', 'story', '1959', 'London', 'theater', 'showgirls', 'Dr.', 'Ward', 'girl', 'Christine', 'Keeler', 'parents', 'home', '[', 'Background', 'check', ']', 'Ward', 'Christine', 'aristocrat', 'mansion', 'famous', 'Cliveden', 'Christine', 'dancer', 'Ward', 'room', 'cottage', 'crowd', 'Conservative', 'Party', 'election', 'victory', 'party', 'Ward', 'cottage', ""'re"", 'doctor', 'dancer', 'stage', 'meet', 'high', 'society', 'visit', 'exclusive', 'clubs', 'activities', 'are', 'being', 'observed', 'man', 'MI-5', 'offers', 'suggestions', 'Ward', 'Christine', 'Profumo', 'A', 'typical', 'weekend', 'Cliveden', 'Ivanov', 'Profumo', 'Cabinet', 'minister', 'cheats', 'games', 'Ward', 'Christine', 'night', 'Eugene', 'Ward', 'events', 'Mr.', 'Woods', 'MI-5.These', 'people', 'visit', 'new', 'place', 'Later', 'Christine', 'meets', 'Profumo', 'place', 'Ward', 'cottage', 'Then', 'Ivanov', 'Later', 'party', 'Mandy', 'boyfriend', 'Christine', 'Profumo', 'again', 'find', 'new', 'place', 'away', 'Dr.', 'Ward', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'Christine', 'boyfriend', 'disturbance', 'Then', 'shooting', 'Dr.', 'Ward', 'cottage', 'newspaper', 'publicity', 'Ward', 'anger', 'Take', 'home', 'over', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'talks', 'story', 'scandal', 'high', 'mighty', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'Will', 'someone', 'have', 'take', 'blame', 'Christine', 'friends', 'warn', 'Ward', 'Christine', 'talks', 'press', 'again', 'Profumo', 'Profumo', 'Parliament', 'was', 'impropriety', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Ward', 'friends', 'Now', 'friends', 'drop', 'Ward', 'evicted', 'low-rent', 'cottage', 'police', 'question', 'Christine', 'Profumo', 'scandal', 'lied', 'Ivanov', 'recalled', 'Moscow.Was', 'security', 'risk', '[', 'was', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', ']', 'Who', 'will', 'be', 'blamed', 'scapegoat', 'Ward', 'Christine', 'schoolboy', 'past', 'blamed', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'rich', 'powerful', 'friends', 'now', 'avoid', 'police', 'have', '147', 'witnesses', 'Ward', 'Mandy', 'court', 'sex', 'partners', 'Lord', 'Astor', 'paid', 'rent', 'would', 'would', ""n't"", 'Christine', 'advised', 'tell', 'truth', 'newspaper', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'journalist', 'not', 'fair', 'Dr.', 'Ward', 'repelled', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'note', 'lot', 'pills', 'cigarette', 'wood', 'floor', 'Ward', 'was', 'convicted', 'living', 'earnings', 'prostitute', 'Later', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'MacMillan', 'resigned', 'new', 'government', 'was', 'elected.Would', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'scandal', 'Government', 'official', 'dallied', 'girl', 'own', 'class', 'scandal', 'received', 'attention', 'America', 'Was', 'high', 'government', 'official', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'compromised', 'involvement', 'actresses', 'showgirls', 'Was', ""n't"", 'there', 'Governor', 'who', 'died', 'presence', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'relative', 'Would', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'movie', 'phrase', 'Society', 'Doctor', 'refer', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'treat', 'disease', 'not', 'report', 'health', 'authorities', 'perform', 'operation', 'was', 'illegal', 'then']",N/A

485639,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6305971196,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 6]","In terms of pop culture, 1963 was a good year for the UK, as that's when the Beatles first exploded on the scene.  For Harold Macmillan and the Conservative Party, it was the opposite, as a scandal involving Russian spies, his Secretary of State for War, John Profumo, and two callgirls named Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, led to the collapse of his government in October due to the national security issues.  However, of the two girls, Keeler was crucified by the press and ended up in obscurity, while Rice-Davies made it big, even appearing in the movie Absolute Beginners.  And the man who introduced Keeler to Profumo, Stephen Ward, became the scapegoat of the whole affair and committed suicide.  Scandal tells of the rise and fall of the three central characters:  Keeler, Profumo, and Ward.After a brief shot of Keeler being mobbed and manhandled by journalists following her testimony at court, the movie takes the viewer back to 1959, when Keeler was a dancer in a revue at a West End club, wearing all sorts of daring costumes.  It's there that she catches Ward's highly-trained eye.  It takes looks or money to enter the privileged world of the elite, and to Ward, and given her looks, Keeler is a racehorse.  He promises to introduce her to all sorts of important people, but that she needs to be wild, liberated.  The two share the same apartment and a special relationship grows between them.  Ward is quite the libertine, saying that the ""trouble with everyone is they're too ashamed to enjoy themselves.""  However, he is seen by others to be vain, shallow, and empty-headed.Keeler is introduced to Eugene, a Soviet naval attache, and in a very sexy moment at Lord Astor's mansion, to Profumo, who is quite taken by her.  He's quite the shy soul, and at first, he just talks with her.  Later, well, the rest is history.  But she finds herself stifled, preferring men her own age instead of the older men Ward introduces her to.  She complains ""You pull the strings.  I'm what you make me.""As for Mandy, she ends up working at the same club as Keeler, and at first the two butt heads.  Mandy though upstages Keeler during a sizzling dance number where they are wearing Native American feathers and costumes, with the loss of her top apparently not hindering her.  The two become friends later on.It's amusing to hear Profumo's address to the House of Commons regarding Keeler.  Initially he says there was no impropriety whatsoever.  Fast forward to another politician, an American president no less, who said ""I did not have relations with that woman.""  Hmm....The scenes that caused a ballyhoo during its release isn't as explicit as all that, unless one counts the scene of a client being turned on by Christine and Mandy together before he ends up joining them--other than that, nothing beyond softcore.Joanne Whalley-Kilmer radiates a sizzling cuteness as Christine Keeler.  She's quite expressive, from those winning smiles to the tearful looks of heartbreak when she is forced to betray her mentor.  Bridget Fonda's Rice-Davies isn't a warm or appealing character.  John Hurt (Stephen Ward) radiates an aura of excitement and self-destructive behaviour in one of his best roles yet, with Ian McKellan (yes, Gandalf himself) doing quite well as the shy yet doomed Profumo.And the guy who plays Johnny, the Jamaican lover of Keeler who is later described as a ""lovesick jungle bunny,"" is none other than Roland Gift, lead singer of the Fine Young Cannibals.  Was it Whalley-Kilmer he was thinking of when he sang ""She Drives Me Crazy?""The fact that Macmillan and Profumo got honours later on shows how forgiving the UK could be.  But it's also interesting how a scandal can affect one's successors.  Sir Alec-Douglas Home inherited the scandals and problems of Macmillan and lost to Harold Wilson's Labour Party a year later, the same way Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 due to his associations with Nixon and inheriting the high inflation of his predecessor.One wonders if Keeler wasn't exactly chuffed to be reminded of an episode in her life she'd rather forget, but if Scandal shows that she became a victim and object of scorn, then it has served its purpose.",4,"The war minister, the model, and the Russian spy.",1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,4203,"['terms', 'pop', 'culture', '1963', 'was', 'good', 'year', 'UK', 'when', 'Beatles', 'first', 'exploded', 'scene', 'Harold', 'Macmillan', 'Conservative', 'Party', 'was', 'opposite', 'scandal', 'involving', 'Russian', 'spies', 'Secretary', 'State', 'War', 'John', 'Profumo', 'two', 'callgirls', 'named', 'Christine', 'Keeler', 'Mandy', 'Rice-Davies', 'led', 'collapse', 'government', 'October', 'due', 'national', 'security', 'issues', 'However', 'two', 'girls', 'Keeler', 'was', 'crucified', 'press', 'ended', 'up', 'obscurity', 'Rice-Davies', 'made', 'big', 'even', 'appearing', 'movie', 'Absolute', 'Beginners', 'man', 'who', 'introduced', 'Keeler', 'Profumo', 'Stephen', 'Ward', 'became', 'scapegoat', 'whole', 'affair', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Scandal', 'rise', 'fall', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'Keeler', 'Profumo', 'Ward.After', 'brief', 'shot', 'Keeler', 'being', 'mobbed', 'manhandled', 'journalists', 'following', 'testimony', 'court', 'movie', 'viewer', 'back', '1959', 'when', 'Keeler', 'was', 'dancer', 'revue', 'West', 'End', 'club', 'wearing', 'sorts', 'daring', 'costumes', 'Ward', 'highly-trained', 'eye', 'looks', 'money', 'enter', 'privileged', 'world', 'elite', 'Ward', 'given', 'looks', 'Keeler', 'racehorse', 'introduce', 'sorts', 'important', 'people', 'be', 'wild', 'liberated', 'two', 'share', 'same', 'apartment', 'special', 'relationship', 'grows', 'Ward', 'quite', 'libertine', 'saying', 'trouble', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'too', 'ashamed', 'enjoy', 'However', 'seen', 'others', 'be', 'vain', 'shallow', 'empty-headed.Keeler', 'introduced', 'Eugene', 'Soviet', 'naval', 'attache', 'very', 'sexy', 'moment', 'Lord', 'Astor', 'mansion', 'Profumo', 'who', 'quite', 'taken', 'quite', 'shy', 'soul', 'first', 'just', 'talks', 'Later', 'well', 'rest', 'history', 'stifled', 'preferring', 'men', 'own', 'age', 'instead', 'older', 'men', 'Ward', 'pull', 'strings', ""'m"", 'what', 'make', 'Mandy', 'up', 'working', 'same', 'club', 'Keeler', 'first', 'two', 'butt', 'heads', 'Mandy', 'upstages', 'Keeler', 'sizzling', 'dance', 'number', 'where', 'are', 'wearing', 'Native', 'American', 'feathers', 'costumes', 'loss', 'top', 'apparently', 'not', 'hindering', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'later', 'on.It', 'amusing', 'hear', 'Profumo', 'address', 'House', 'Commons', 'regarding', 'Keeler', 'Initially', 'was', 'impropriety', 'whatsoever', 'Fast', 'forward', 'politician', 'American', 'president', 'no', 'less', 'who', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'relations', 'woman', 'Hmm', '.The', 'scenes', 'caused', 'ballyhoo', 'release', ""n't"", 'as', 'explicit', 'one', 'scene', 'client', 'being', 'turned', 'Christine', 'Mandy', 'together', 'up', 'joining', 'other', 'nothing', 'softcore.Joanne', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'sizzling', 'cuteness', 'Christine', 'Keeler', 'quite', 'expressive', 'winning', 'smiles', 'tearful', 'looks', 'heartbreak', 'when', 'forced', 'betray', 'mentor', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'Rice-Davies', ""n't"", 'warm', 'appealing', 'character', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Stephen', 'Ward', 'aura', 'excitement', 'self-destructive', 'behaviour', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'yet', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'yes', 'Gandalf', 'doing', 'quite', 'well', 'shy', 'yet', 'doomed', 'Profumo.And', 'guy', 'who', 'Johnny', 'Jamaican', 'lover', 'Keeler', 'who', 'later', 'described', 'lovesick', 'jungle', 'bunny', 'none', 'other', 'Roland', 'Gift', 'lead', 'singer', 'Fine', 'Young', 'Cannibals', 'Was', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'sang', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'fact', 'Macmillan', 'Profumo', 'got', 'honours', 'later', 'shows', 'how', 'forgiving', 'UK', 'could', 'be', 'also', 'interesting', 'how', 'scandal', 'can', 'affect', 'one', 'successors', 'Sir', 'Alec-Douglas', 'Home', 'inherited', 'scandals', 'problems', 'Macmillan', 'lost', 'Harold', 'Wilson', 'Labour', 'Party', 'year', 'later', 'same', 'way', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'lost', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', '1976', 'due', 'associations', 'Nixon', 'inheriting', 'high', 'inflation', 'predecessor.One', 'wonders', 'Keeler', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'chuffed', 'be', 'reminded', 'episode', 'life', ""'d"", 'rather', 'forget', 'Scandal', 'became', 'victim', 'object', 'scorn', 'then', 'served', 'purpose']",N/A

485643,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6305971196,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[3, 3]","The historic scandal that literally embarrassed during a decade the highest spheres of the British politic, was not more than a simple reflect of a state of things originated perhaps, by the collective reaction to forty years of war. The social behavior works out as a big pendulum: it can prove its huge ability to resist. Along those hard years, four generations gave the best of themselves but the fifth generation simply said no more and somehow the pendulum took the opposite direction: in fact having reached the peak, the psychological answer was evasion and funny diversion, breaking the rules vertical and horizontally. It is not a mere coincidence the presence of so many good movies in the comedy genre. That  is a remarkable evidence and somehow it reminds the same behavior of the last period of the Greeks or any other example. The comedians appear many times at the end of the expansion of any society: epic, tragedy and comedy.Profumo's scandal was perhaps, the last downstairs push, a real shock for the Victorian gaze, a slap in the face of the body social that curiously assists to the birth of the British rock & roll.  Michael Caton Jones made to my mind his best achievement to date with this movie, revealing carefully the most intimate insights and details around this scandal that overcame the politic sphere to become a very hard punch, not only for the Conservators, but besides all the British citizenship.Fabulous performances.

Defense Minister Profumo's attempt to refute allegations of his involvement with Christine Keeler ultimately brought down the 10 year Conservative Party government back in the mid-1960's. ""Scandal"" recreates these events and gives the viewer a glimpse into the personalities and possible motives of the main players in this political soap opera.But recreating history is a secondary consideration in this film whose theme is about individuals who live in a fairy tale world until they fall victim to the grim forces that take life more seriously. The main player is Stephen Ward (John Hurt), a osteopath and recreational artist whose main goal is to be part of the right crowd, not so much immersed in this kind of society as in a position to observe it closely for his amusement. His method for doing so involves discovering ravishing young women from the poor side of town and doing a Henry Higgins number on them. The film begins with his discovery of Keller (Joanne Whalley) who he begins grooming and introducing to prominent members of his in-crowd.The two soon fall in love, but theirs is not a physical relationship. Stephen delights in seeing his prot&eacute;g&eacute; work her magic on men in authority. This eventually leads to their doom, since no one quite understands such an unconventional relationship they have no credibility when an attempt is made to make Stephen a scapegoat for the government scandal.In retrospect the process of attacking Ward to contain the widening scandal was one of the two most shameful abuses of the judicial system in post war Britain. Coincidentally Hurt played the victim in the other one as well; ""10 Rillington Place"" (1971), in which Hurt is wrongly executed for a murder committed by his landlord, the now notorious serial killer John Christie.""Scandal"" is a powerful and arresting film with solid performances. Whalley has the biggest role and is a bit too intelligent looking to be completely believable as a character like Keeler. But she is so nice to look at that almost anyone would willingly trade credibility for scenery-and she is otherwise entirely convincing in an excellent performance. I first noticed her in ""Willow"", the film she made just before ""Scandal"". She had a secondary part but her scenes were the most memorable in the entire film. Hurt somehow sells you on the fact that his character derives an innocent joy from simply seeing a beautiful young woman walking down the street on a nice day.Then again, what do I know?

485652,A2K3UTNW0783U6,6305971196,Phillip Kay,"[3, 4]","Scandal was released in 1989. It was directed by Michael Caton-Jones, written by Michael Thomas and stars John Hurt as Stephen Ward, Joanne Whalley as Christine Keeler, Bridget Fonda as Mandy Rice-Davies and Ian McKellen as John Profumo, four characters who embarrassed a British government into resigning in the early 1960s.There are many things this film could have been: a study of the last period when British aristocracy arrogantly maintained its privileged position; exploration of post WWII British politics, rise of the Cold War and the fall of Macmillan's successful Conservative Party government; investigation of social changes that bought the 'Swinging Sixties', made London the pop capital of the world and stirred a fearful reaction in older generations. These elements are present in the film but they are in the background. In the foreground are a subtle study of personal relationships in a particular milieu and a condemnation of the destructive power of the press in creating and feeding 'scandal' to boost circulation.The film spends much of its time exploring the relationship between Christine Keeler and Stephen Ward, and can be presumed to be freely inventing much of what transpires: quite legitimate for something that's drama not documentary.The film gets our attention immediately by showing a love affair between an attractive man and a beautiful young girl which is not sexually based. This is pretty rare in the movies where getting the girl/guy is really all that happens (aside from serial killers, monsters, natural disasters, war and so on of course). So what's going on? Is Ward just a gay guy using girls as pawns in his game? The film doesn't suggest this, and forces us to think a little harder. Behind the love that holds these two together is recognition: both are members of the lower classes who have crossed social boundaries and are on the defensive in 'swinging' society.This was a time, we are reminded, when the most admired four people in Britain were the Beatles, who couldn't even speak proper, and the most feared were probably the five Rolling Stones, butterflies broken on the wheel (said the Times) by an unfairly severe punishment for a drug offense not long after this period.Illegal drugs were being used recreationally by many people under 20. Pop music and fashion was developing a market of its own. People were talking of 'free love'. The fabric of society was breaking down and conservative people were very unhappy. Looking back on this one can see a heartbreaking innocence, both in those who experimented and those who disapproved.The film switches back and forth between events and reportage so we can see the difference between what happens and how it is reported.At a review a showgirl loses her top and (gasp!) you can see her breasts. White people consort with people from Jamaica who have shady skins! Both take marijuana and other drugs and have fun! There's an orgy and people have sex where other people can see them! People sleep around, and one of them has sex with both a Russian diplomat and a British politician!This is the first trendy generation we're looking at, and they aren't too sure of themselves. In the film nobody is a degenerate. In the newspapers there were lurid accounts of SM/BD practices. In the film there is no suggestion that the diplomat and the politician were spies passing on information to rival governments, just people who saw each other at parties and shared girlfriends. In the newspapers there was a security leak that forced a minister and then a government to resign. In the film there is a teenage girl taking drugs and practising free love because it's the thing to do. In the newspapers she's a sordid and mercenary prostitute. What's more important than reporting the news? Protecting the Establishment. What's more important than protecting the Establishment? Selling newspapers. Gone are the crusading reporters of films of the forties: these guys are schmucks looking for bucks.So the scandal turns out to be not so much what happened but what could have happened. It's a Caesar's wife situation.And that brings us around to the relationship between Ward and Keeler, because scandal is Ward's social currency. Arranging things that are just a bit naughty gets him into all the right places, and the game proves just a little too addictive for him. Forced to choose, he thinks, between the game of scandal and Keeler, he casts her off and brings about his own downfall. Without making a big thing of it there is the suggestion that that bit of shallowness was his only wrong doing.Once the naive Keeler was paid to say what the reporters thought would sell papers Ward found himself in the same position as Oscar Wilde when he laid charges against the Marquess of Queensberry in 1895. Again the Establishment closed ranks and suddenly it was all Ward's fault.The film offers a superbly acted tragedy of people meeting at the wrong time and place who could have made each other happy but who just as surely could only have met at that wrong time and place. And for the curious there's the vista of 50 years in which the times have changed so much (not least in the effect the media now has on us all) and yet the same human nature causes the same tragedies over and over again.Scandal. As someone once said, let those without faults throw the first stone.",5,Scandal: reporting what people want to be true,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,5372,"['Scandal', 'was', 'released', '1989', 'was',

Our linchpin is Stephen Ward, a bon vivant whose sole aim in life was to drift in the right circles by finding young girls to groom and convert, and then introducing them to the reflected glow of his aristocratic chums.If his innocuously misguided orchestrations for rolling in &quot;high society&quot; were unsavory, the film minces no words that parties on either side of the bargain never really complained until they had their faces slapped on the front pages of news dailies. All of this comes to a tumbling end when one of the girls, Ms. Keeler, is exposed because of an unfortunate two-timing between a British Cabinet official and a Russian agent. There is a suggestion of romantic tension between this character and Ward, which is quite interesting.It was my first time to see the actress who plays Keeler but she struck a fabulous balance in the paradox of her character: radiantly innocent on one hand, but amorous with an abandon on the other, believing there to be little difference between sleeping with powerful men and a stranger whom she called boyfriend.Therein lies the beauty of this film. Behind its (inevitably) smoldering sauciness, it is surprisingly wise about the complexity of the human heart. The saddest moment in the movie comes in the final courtroom scene, when Keeler is called as a witness and ruthlessly hammered by the prosecutor's questions, until Ward flails his arms from the defendant's box and cries &quot;That is not fair!&quot; Which quite aptly sums up the wail of this riveting film.",4,THE BITTERSWEET COMPLEXITIES OF THE HUMAN HEART,1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,2043,"['Scandal', 'theme', 'universal', 'peccadilloes', 'men', 'waking', 'up', 'wrong', 'beds', 'political', 'covert', 'tensions', 'governments', 'hinged', 'political', 'scandal', 'startling', 'human', 'dimension', 'maintaining', 'even', 'keel', 'note', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'indignance', 'hypocricy', 'toffs', 'had', 'thrive.The', 'plot', 'based', 'actual', 'turn', 'events', 'harking', 'back', 'notorious', 'scandal', 'misconduct', 'ranks', 'British', 'government', 'few', 'decades', 'ago', 'linchpin', 'Stephen', 'Ward', 'bon', 'vivant', 'sole', 'aim', 'life', 'was', 'drift', 'right', 'circles', 'finding', 'young', 'girls', 'groom', 'convert', 'then', 'introducing', 'reflected', 'glow', 'aristocratic', 'chums.If', 'innocuously', 'misguided', 'orchestrations', 'rolling', 'quot', 'high', 'society', 'quot', 'were', 'unsavory', 'film', 'words', 'parties', 'side', 'bargain', 'never', 'really', 'complained', 'had', 'slapped', 'front', 'pages', 'news', 'dailies', 'tumbling', 'end', 'when', 'one', 'girls', 'Ms.', 'Keeler', 'exposed', 'unfortunate', 'two-timing', 'British', 'Cabinet', 'official', 'Russian', 'agent', 'suggestion', 'romantic', 'tension', 'character', 'Ward', 'quite', 'interesting.It', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'actress', 'who', 'Keeler', 'struck', 'fabulous', 'balance', 'paradox', 'character', 'radiantly', 'innocent', 'one', 'hand', 'amorous', 'abandon', 'other', 'believing', 'there', 'be', 'little', 'difference', 'sleeping', 'powerful', 'men', 'stranger', 'whom', 'called', 'boyfriend.Therein', 'beauty', 'film', 'inevitably', 'smoldering', 'sauciness', 'surprisingly', 'wise', 'complexity', 'human', 'heart', 'saddest', 'moment', 'movie', 'final', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'when', 'Keeler', 'called', 'witness', 'ruthlessly', 'hammered', 'prosecutor', 'questions', 'Ward', 'arms', 'defendant', 'box', 'cries', 'quot', 'not', 'fair', 'quot', 'Which', 'quite', 'aptly', 'up', 'wail', 'riveting', 'film']",N/A

The nature of the ""scandal"" seems somewhat tame and run of the mill, seen through modern eyes; we have seen many John Profumo's since and Miss Keeler was a prototype for many a foxy minx on the make, De Sanchas, Lewinski, Hall and Clark to name but a few.Look a little closer and it is not hard to see why the corruption of vulnerable young women, the decodance of rich socialites and the arrogance of government was so shocking to early 60's Britain, a country still reeling from it's battering by Warfare and experiencing waves of social change and unrest it had no notion of coping with. The whole Profumo affair, disrupted and questioned long held values and certainties about British society and raised the fear of foriegn infiltration.Whalley captures the fun loving essence and vulnerability of a pretty teenager way out of her depth superbly, Hurt is fabulously decadent and niave, Fonda is high octane and engagingly frivalous.The sum total of the film leaves you feeling saddenend, corrupted and used which is the experience of most of the key players, but more over there is a sense of innocence and certainty lost and an anxiety about what will replace that which is lost. Highly educational and sadly emotive, this film is so much more than it's chronology of events.",5,A lot of current resonance...,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,1432,"['very', 'well', 'made', 'often', 'overlooked', 'film', 'Scandal', 'seen', 'many', 'slightly', 'farcical', 'best', 'tradition', 'British', 'theatre', 'based', 'bedroom', 'romps', 'nature', 'scandal', 'somewhat', 'tame', 'run', 'mill', 'seen', 'modern', 'eyes', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'John', 'Profumo', 'Miss', 'Keeler', 'was', 'prototype', 'many', 'foxy', 'minx', 'make', 'De', 'Sanchas', 'Lewinski', 'Hall', 'Clark', 'name', 'few.Look', 'little', 'closer', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'corruption', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'women', 'decodance', 'rich', 'socialites', 'arrogance', 'government', 'was', 'so', 'shocking', 'early', '60', 'Britain', 'country', 'still', 'reeling', 'battering', 'Warfare', 'experiencing', 'waves', 'social', 'change', 'unrest', 'had', 'notion', 'coping', 'whole', 'Profumo', 'affair', 'disrupted', 'questioned', 'long', 'held', 'values', 'certainties', 'British', 'society', 'raised', 'fear', 'foriegn', 'infiltration.Whalley', 'fun', 'loving', 'essence', 'vulnerability', 'pretty', 'teenager', 'way', 'depth', 'superbly', 'Hurt', 'fabulously', 'decadent', 'niave', 'Fonda', 'high', 'octane', 'engagingly', 'frivalous.The', 'sum', 'total', 'film', 'feeling', 'saddenend', 'corrupted', 'used', 'experience', 'most', 'key', 'players', 'more', 'sense', 'innocence', 'certainty', 'lost', 'anxiety', 'what', 'will', 'replace', 'lost', 'Highly', 'educational', 'sadly', 'emotive', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'chronology', 'events']",N/A

Why, class up the joint by sticking a bunch of stage actors in tuxedos and evening gowns and making them talk in those nasally, affected British accents, of course.  Oh, and it'll help if you base the story on a true event and tell it in an ironic, tragic sort of way.  That's about what ""Scandal"" does, though not with particular style or grist.  Purporting to delve into the so-called Profumo Affair in the 1950s that led to mayhem for the British government, it's more about skin than politics, titillation than character.  Joanne Whalley stars as a cat-faced party girl and professional homewrecker, not above any kink or good time with her crowd of over-the-hill frat boys (including Sir Ian McKellan, looking rather ridiculous with a partially shaved head, and a kooky John Hurt).  She cruises the fast-track to success by bedding every London politico in sight until predictably, inevitably, things go wrong.  It isn't that ""Scandal"" doesn't at times grab the viewer's attention; it's that it uses exactly the same T & A as the cheapest of cable TV softcore to do so.  The stuff in between seems just a sham to add the faintest air of respectability to it all . . . just like the cheapest of cable TV softcore.  Controversial when it was made in the late 1980s--(Gasp!) this white vixen even sleeps with black men!--the film's sexuality will seem somewhat quaint today.  If you want to see reasonably attractive people get naked or pretend to have a threesome, then ""Scandal"" is for you.

The montage is pure early-Sixties erotica as these contrasting beauties are fastening their merry widows and applying their frosted lipstick, with the rolling rhythm of the music propelling the delectable visuals. Slipping into their party dresses, with a final command of, ""Wet your lips,"" the girls are stunning, and all eyes are on them.Cut to: rustling satin sheets and the ecstatic cooing and moaning of two women making very vocal love. The ""ooohhhing"" and ""aaahhhing"" is intense and limbs are flailing as the camera travels over the bed, settling on the faces of Christine and Mandy. A final unified sigh of orgasmic lust and the girls dissolve into uncontrollable laughter as their passion is revealed as a charade, and the camera pans to their catch of the evening, a very aroused matinee idol, who, unable to contain himself, blows a battle cry and swan-dives into bed with them.

The cover boasts that the version it contains is ""uncut & uncensored""; however, that claim is false. Inexplicably missing is the entire ""nightgown"" scene with Bridget Fonda, which should appear just after the orgy.  I'm pretty sure that this scene appears in every other version of the movie.  I'm almost certain it was in the R-rated general release, I know it is in the ""uncut"" VHS tape, and part of it even appears in the broadcast televsion version.  In fact, watching the censored TV cut of that segment on BBC America a month or so ago is what inspired me to order the DVD in the first place.  Now I just feel ripped off.
