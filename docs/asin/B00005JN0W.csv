Of course everything falls to hell, and he is left seeking revenge on a kidnapping syndicate.The movie is a revenge story, and that is made clear when Crazy declares ""Revenge is a meal best served cold,""  which of course is not how the line is traditionally said (think ""dish"" not ""meal"").

625730,A379SAP75SPDHD,B00005JN0W,Alec Solomita,"[1, 1]","Man On Fire is one of the better action and revenge films to come along in a while. The story is simple: Denzel Washington plays an ex CIA operative who visits a friend in Mexico, played by Christopher Walken. His friend sets him up with a job as a bodyguard for a little girl for a semi-wealthy family. The little girl softens the hard heart of the bodyguard, and when everything is going great, she is kidnapped. The rest of the film is about what the bodyguard will do to settle the score and figure out what happened. Denzel Washinghton delivers another amazing performance as a broken down drunk, who slowly rediscovers happiness, only to have it taken away. Once that happens, we see his angry, but extremely efficient side, as he sets a plan in motion, that he carries out to perfection. Dakota Fanning is also amazing, as the bright little girl who shows Denzel life can still be good. The direction by Tony Scott is very stylish and effective, as it is gritty looking, much like the feel of the film. The action scenes are staged to perfection as well. This is one of the better action thrillers you will see all year.

Paulsen ""AlexP""","[1, 1]","Denzel Washington certainly made his bones here as an action - adventure star thus proving that he is one of the most versatile actors in todays market. Had it not been for Denzels deep and powerful performance this would have been not much more than another blood and guts over-stylized kill-em-all flick.Denzel plays a mystery man ex-assasin John Creasy urged to get back to work by this friend Rayburn played by Christopher Walken. Creasy takes a job as a body guard for a little girl Pita, daughter of wealthy Mexican factory owner down on his luck. Creasy has his ghosts and the girl ends up ( of course ) helping bring back from the abyss. Dakota Fanning is a gifted child actress and makes Pita come alive on the screen.Then the girl is kidnapped and Creasy kills 4 of the kidnappers including 2 Mexican cops during the attempt.The ransom exchange goes wrong and Creasy is out for revenge when the girl is reported as killed.This is good film with powerful performaces all around. It was good to Rachel Ticotin ( Total Recal ) again, and the Mexican cast is all magnificent.Filmed on location in Mexico City this is unfortunately an overstylized film with loads of dizzying ""MTV"" style scenes, fast edits, discordant music, and solarization. I didn't see this nonsense as adding anything to the film. The director should have taken a more consistently serious tone though the movie. I tink he was trying to offset the dark quality of the other scenes, but random images of Pita did a much better job of balancing out the depressing elements of the more violent scenes.It was gory, bloody, violent and graphic, but the director made sure you didn't feel the least bit of pity for any of Creasy's victims. Especially the cop he abducted who was direclt involved in Pita's snatch. YOu'll grimace but cheer the cops punishment. All the while Creasy has this relaxed almost nonchalant attitude and mannerism. Washington pulled this off very well indeed.The ending was predictable, but made really no sense and served no purpose when you consider the rest of movie's theme. I won't give it away here but you'll pretty much figure it out midway through Creasy's bloodfest. You'll hope you're wrong but you won't be.Don't blame Denzel for the movies shortcomings.

The first half moved at such a slow pace that Tony Scott had to make the camera work intensfy every moment, and he pulled it off flawlessly. I have heard much complaints about how it was filmed with the camera jittering all over all spastically and the often unnecessary subtitles, but I felt they were a must, or at least a bonus!This tells the story of John Creasy(Washington) an ex-CIA assassin turned wash-up alcoholic who comes to Mexico City to visit his old pal an Co-Op(Walken). While there he recommends him finding a job as a bodyguard, which shouldnt be too hard due to the mass kidnappings of wealthy families going on within the city(The movie's intro credits give us a terrifying example of every day life of these kidnappings). Meanwhile, Samuel(Marc Anthony) is convinced by his lawyer(Mickey Rourke) to hire a bodyguard for him and his Wife(Radha Mitchell)'s daughter, Pita(Dakota Fanning). Thus Creasy becomes the girl's bodyguard. For the first hour we see the development of Creasy in Mexico City, adapting to it all as well as the cheery little girl, whom he pushes away from his emotions. Creasy is a coldhearted killer who knows nothing best but to kill and now he has no left to kill but himself, and Denzel shows this flawlessly. He stands a cold-hearted man, but throughout their time spent together, they form a unique bond, kind of like a Master & Apprentice sort of thing. Creasy soon finds himself somewhat of a second father to Pita, and she teaches him to live again, but amongst once this happens, so does the worst, and soon Creasy finds Pita and himself in danger by abductors, who Creasy puts his all into fighting off to rescue Pita, but no avail. She is kidnapped & Creasy is hospitalized. The Mexican Mob want payment, and Creasy, royally pissed off, is ready to deliver it to them, whether it not be the way they expected or not...Denzel delivers yet another pwoerful performance. His character, Creasy, reminds me of a (somewhat)good version of Alonzo Harris from Training Day, though he's still full of no remorse. You really feel what he feels throughout the film, you feel his cold bitterness as it turns into happiness, you see as his passionate vengeance turns back into the passionless killing you never saw before.The film was a great introduction to Dakota Fanning, I can tell she is going to be one excellent actress, hell she is already is one! Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, & Mickey Rourke give brief, but great performances as the supporting cast as well. Walken gives a key line in the film about Creasy, stating ""Everyman is an artist at something. Creasy's art is death, and he is about to paint his masterpiece"", and boy does he ever...This movie is all about character development. I actually walked in expecting a typical popcorn action flick and got something way completly different. I think thats why I love it so much. I want to own this film the day it comes out for sure, I just hope that's not too far off.",5,Tony Scott revolutionizes cinematography!,1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,3038,"['absolutely', 'love', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'first', 'half', 'moved', 'slow', 'pace', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'had', 'make', 'camera', 'work', 'intensfy', 'moment', 'pulled', 'off', 'flawlessly', 'have', 'heard', 'much', 'complaints', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'camera', 'jittering', 'spastically', 'often', 'unnecessary', 'subtitles', 'felt', 'were', 'must', 'least', 'bonus', 'story', 'John', 'Creasy', 'Washington', 'ex-CIA', 'assassin', 'turned', 'wash-up', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'Mexico', 'City', 'visit', 'old', 'pal', 'Co-Op', 'Walken', 'finding', 'job', 'bodyguard', 'shouldnt', 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'due', 'mass', 'kidnappings', 'wealthy', 'families', 'going', 'city', 'movie', 'intro', 'credits', 'give', 'terrifying', 'example', 'day', 'life', 'kidnappings', 'Meanwhile', 'Samuel', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'convinced', 'lawyer', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'hire', 'bodyguard', 'Wife', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'daughter', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Thus', 'Creasy', 'girl', 'bodyguard', 'first', 'hour', 'see', 'development', 'Creasy', 'Mexico', 'City', 'adapting', 'as', 'well', 'cheery', 'little', 'girl', 'whom', 'away', 'emotions', 'Creasy', 'coldhearted', 'killer', 'who', 'nothing', 'best', 'kill', 'now', 'left', 'kill', 'Denzel', 'flawlessly', 'cold-hearted', 'man', 'time', 'spent', 'together', 'form', 'unique', 'bond', 'kind', 'Master', 'Apprentice', 'sort', 'thing', 'Creasy', 'soon', 'somewhat', 'second', 'father', 'Pita', 'live', 'again', 'amongst', 'once', 'so', 'worst', 'soon', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'danger', 'abductors', 'who', 'Creasy', 'fighting', 'off', 'rescue', 'Pita', 'avail', 'kidnapped', 'Creasy', 'hospitalized', 'Mexican', 'Mob', 'want', 'payment', 'Creasy', 'royally', 'pissed', 'off', 'ready', 'deliver', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'expected', 'not', 'Denzel', 'delivers', 'yet', 'pwoerful', 'performance', 'character', 'Creasy', 'somewhat', 'good', 'version', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'Training', 'Day', 'still', 'full', 'remorse', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'film', 'feel', 'cold', 'bitterness', 'happiness', 'see', 'passionate', 'vengeance', 'back', 'passionless', 'killing', 'never', 'saw', 'before.The', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'introduction', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'can', 'tell', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'excellent', 'actress', 'hell', 'already', 'one', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'give', 'brief', 'great', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'Walken', 'key', 'line', 'film', 'Creasy', 'stating', 'Everyman', 'artist', 'something', 'Creasy', 'art', 'death', 'paint', 'masterpiece', 'boy', 'ever', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'actually', 'walked', 'expecting', 'typical', 'popcorn', 'action', 'flick', 'got', 'something', 'way', 'completly', 'different', 'think', 'thats', 'why', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'own', 'film', 'day', 'out', 'sure', 'just', 'hope', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'off']",N/A

But then, this is a film driven to absolute hatred and rage. Why should you expect him to be nice and non-violent. This is a story about what death dealing is really about. It's not about cartoon violence as found in Kill Bill. It's not about, ""hey you looked at me funny so now I gotta beat you up."" It's about, ""for what you mutha [bleepers] have done, I'm gonna butcher every last [bleeping] one of you!"" This movie is about what could bring a man to that point and what he would do afterwards.Creasy (Denzel Washington) is not a nice man. He's a cold hearted killer. The movie has him pondering will he ever be forgiven for his past sins. He hates himself for what he's become and tries to end his life, but something intervenes and he is spared. Then this child becomes sort of a savior for Creasy; bringing him back to the world of humanity again. When she dies, inside he dies with her. He becomes nothing more than an avenging angel wreaking death to those who brought it to her.The end, without giving too much away, is about Creasy doing what he has to do, and what he knows needs to be done. He makes a sacrifice to save the one he loves.This film is dirty and violent and disgusting, but in some ways it is also beautiful. Washington and Fanning give fantastic performances.

Tony Scott's directing, while it has the frantic, jittery pace of an MTV video, is a great vehicle for telling this violent and somewhat fractured story.My only real complaints are the 2 or 3 times when characters lapse into the tired old one-liners that seem more fitting for 80s action flicks.

It's kind of scary to know that stuff like what happens in this movie is probably going on around you. Denzel Washington puts on easily his best acting yet. He's always been a phenominal actor but this movie puts him on an all new plateau. Marc Anthony, surprisingly, pulls off his role excellent. His portrayal of a father battling his inner demons is right on. Dakota Fanning was casted perfectly in my opinion. The bright-eyed youngster trying to be friends with her bodyguard. Christopher Walken steals every scene he's in. As always, he's suave and injects a bit of humor in at the appropriate times. And let's not forget Radha Mitchell, the extremely troubled mother.This movie revolves around Creasy (Washington), a man hired by Samuel (Anthony) to act as his daughter's (Fanning) bodyguard. Creasy is timid towards the job but takes it, refusing to be Pita's friend, he's her bodyguard nothing else. It's odvious from the opening scene that this part of Mexico is not, by any means, a nice part of town. It doesn't seem safe in the least but this accusation is backed up towards the middle of the movie. While protecting Pita, Creasy is shot twice and put in the hospital. What happens when he leaves the hospital to revenge the kidnapping is shear brilliance. He doesn't care who you are, but if you were involved in the kidnapping you're going to wish you never were. His take no prisoner style is very admirable.The camera work featured in this is amazing. It's very raw and portrays the feeling of the film perfectly. Tony Scott did an excellent job in every aspect of this movie. Kudos should also be given to the special effects people. Without compromising any of the film's integrity, they capture the brutality of the killings, and everything in between, very well.Overall this is definitely a movie worth seeing at least once. The overall message is very good, and features some of the best acting in recent memory. Everyone in this movie is worthy of being included and brought their 'A' game. This also has a great ending, while never answering the odvious question that you're left asking.

625757,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JN0W,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[1, 1]","Man on Fire is an entertaining action flick starring Denzel Washington in the lead role as John Creasy- a former CIA employee who has been hired to act as the bodyguard for a young girl in Mexico City. The city has seen an increase in kidnappings and Washington's character has been hired by the parents of the little girl to keep her out of harm's way.This movie offers some good suspense and a plot that is less predictable than other films, making it more entertaining to watch. It seems like a large number of Hollywood films as of late offer plots that can be predicted in the first ten or fifteen minutes. With Man on Fire, you find yourself predicting the outcome but not really knowing what will happen until the end.One thing about this movie that might turn off some viewers is the level of violence. There are some gruesome, bloody scenes depicted in this movie and the director definitely pushes the limits of censorship on more than one occasion. The movie received an ""R"" rating, but this could have easily been changed to ""NR"", ""NC-17"" or some other rating with a little more visible violence. To keep the rating down to ""R"", the director wisely decided to keep the violence on screen from crossing the threshold that would have changed it. You know what is going on, but in many cases you cannot see the violence directly.Denzel Washington is the main star of this film and his performance is excellent, like always. He is tough, mostly cool, and most certainly a seeker of justice who shows no remorse for hurting someone who he feels deserves it. His supporting cast, which includes the likes of Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, and others, is only mediocre and they come across as only semi- believable. Young Dakota Fanning- the girl who Denzel is hired to protect- is the only person in the supporting cast who performs above average.Man on Fire is worth a look, and it will appeal mostly to those who like suspenseful drama. The violence can get a little carried away at times and some of it will shock the average viewer. But this movie is a good one with an unpredictable plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end.",4,Former CIA Agent Seeks Justice in Mexico City,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,2145,"['Man', 'Fire', 'entertaining', 'action', 'flick', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'lead', 'role', 'John', 'Creasy-', 'former', 'CIA', 'employee', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'act', 'bodyguard', 'young', 'girl', 'Mexico', 'City', 'city', 'seen', 'increase', 'kidnappings', 'Washington', 'character', 'been', 'hired', 'parents', 'little', 'girl', 'keep', 'harm', 'way.This', 'movie', 'good', 'suspense', 'plot', 'less', 'predictable', 'other', 'films', 'making', 'more', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'large', 'number', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'late', 'offer', 'plots', 'can', 'be', 'predicted', 'first', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Man', 'Fire', 'find', 'predicting', 'outcome', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'end.One', 'thing', 'movie', 'might', 'turn', 'off', 'viewers', 'level', 'violence', 'are', 'gruesome', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'depicted', 'movie', 'director', 'definitely', 'limits', 'censorship', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'movie', 'received', 'R', 'rating', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'changed', 'NR', 'NC-17', 'other', 'rating', 'little', 'more', 'visible', 'violence', 'keep', 'rating', 'down', 'R', 'director', 'wisely', 'decided', 'keep', 'violence', 'screen', 'crossing', 'threshold', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'many', 'cases', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'violence', 'directly.Denzel', 'Washington', 'main', 'star', 'film', 'performance', 'excellent', 'always', 'tough', 'mostly', 'cool', 'most', 'certainly', 'seeker', 'justice', 'who', 'remorse', 'hurting', 'someone', 'who', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likes', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'others', 'only', 'mediocre', 'come', 'only', 'semi-', 'believable', 'Young', 'Dakota', 'Fanning-', 'girl', 'who', 'Denzel', 'hired', 'protect-', 'only', 'person', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'average.Man', 'Fire', 'look', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'who', 'like', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'violence', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'carried', 'away', 'times', 'will', 'shock', 'average', 'viewer', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'unpredictable', 'plot', 'guessing', 'way', 'end']",N/A

The movie has alot of appeal for many reasons: Denzel's character is easily relatable for many people out there because he does have trouble communicating with others, and prefers to be alone. Dakota Fanning is one heck of an actress, and she is going to the top!! I've never scene such a great performance from any kid. She really makes you love her, and that is good acting. She is a born star and I can't wait to see her in more touching roles like this one! To be honest, I didn't even know Marc Anthony acted before this, I thought he was just a singer. Oh well, after that performance, he should probably just stick to singing. I wasn't impressed at all. And who doesn't love to see Christopher Walken in yet another flick? He is just such an enjoyable actor with great chemistry in the film, and it really showed! The movie is violent in the second half, but it does have a message about love, and how powerful it is. Love changes you, no matter how big a villain you are, love can change you like it did to Denzel's character. It made him love that girl and that's what made it fun in the second half, after he believed she was dead, he decided to take out his revenge. And that was cool!!The film is filled with top-notch acting(excluding Marc Anthony), an explosive and entertaining second half, and a just plainly happy first half. Denzel and Dakota have great chemistry in their scenes and it really works!! Though some parts might be a little cheesy, for the most part, it's realistic and entertaining!

Despite this, they always seem to work. All three of those I've listed above are some of my favorite action movies, but Scott's latest, Man On Fire, is better than all of them.As far as action movies go, this one is atypical in that nothing of any real excitement happens for the first 45-50 minutes of the film. We're introduced to Creasy, who's got some problems with his past and a drinking problem (kind of like the character Denzel played in Courage Under Fire, with a harder edge). Once again, Washington is perfect. Considering that many of the movies he's been in lately have only had average scripts, I'm amazed at how he's always able to elevate the level of the material he's working with. He does it again here, making Creasy a sympathetic character, even when he's cutting off people's fingers. Dakota Fanning, as Pita, the girl he's hired to protect, makes a strong case for being the best child actor the world has to offer these days. She comes off with just as much charm as she did in I Am Sam. The supporting actors, however, add little to the picture. Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell are nothing special as Pita's parents and the roles of most of the other minor characters could have been played by most anyone. Even Christopher Walken (a personal favourite of mine, ever since I first saw The Prophecy) who turned in an excellent performance in the ridiculous movie The Rundown, doesn't do much for this picture, though it might just be because he's underused.Scott does some intense camera work throughout the movie, and though it's hardly anything innovative, it keeps things tense.

As John was released from the hospital, he makes a promise to Pita's mother that he will stop at nothing to track down everyone that is involved in the girl's kidnapping will pay.  With the help of Pita's diary, he was able to track down the suspects left and right and torture them to get the truth before killing them.  We discover some shocking news in all of this such as Pita's father approved of the kidnapping and took some of the money to help his father pay off some gambling debts and that Pita was still alive.  With the help of a news reporter who wanted to see the suspects be brought to justice just as bad as he did, John was able to track down ""The Voice"".  They make a deal to meet by a bridge where they exchange a life for a life.  That means that Pita would be released if he gave him his brother and his life.  Even thought John ended up getting killed, he saved Pita's life and brought the suspects to justice and helped the police kill ""The Voice"".  It seems like Pita did bring back a side of John that has been missing for a while.  This movie reminded me alot like John Q as in Denzel's character made some mistakes but has good intentions to see that a child life was safe.

It is dark, challenging and the performances are great.Denzel Washington plays a hired bodyguard and former assassin named Creasy who is to protect an adorable little girl named Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. There relationship is phenominal. Denzel slowly warms to her personality and finds a new purpose in life behind her.Denzel, once again, proves that he is one of, if not THE finest actor in hollywood. In MAN ON FIRE, he takes on 3 personalities and he flawlessly transforms from one to the next with ultimate believability.Revenge is ugly.Everything about the movie is entertaining and engrossing. Yet, one thing really set me off. That one thing was an MTV, flash image story-telling that frequently left me wishing they would just STOP and SHOW THE IMAGES! At times, it was okay, but at times it was frustrating and confusing.Is it art? Is there a point to it? Or is it just a way to be different? I don't know. From what I saw, much of it served no purpose other than to be artsy and NEW AGE.You know that instance where you GET IT? Where you're watching a scene and you know what is happening and you know what is going to happen? Many of these scenes were dragged on excrutiatingly long and longer to the point of frustration by bizarre closeups, flashes, overdramatization and slow motion.The movie's good.

But he eventually gets involved in training her for swimming competitions. This gives him a new purpose and happiness in his life. Their blossoming friendship is tragically cut short when Pita is kidnapped. The movie then shifts from story mode to pure action as Creasy embarks on a campaign of intense violence to revenge the apparent death of the innocent Pita. I won't ruin the ending for you. But this movie is elevated by several intriguing plot twists, including a major one involving Pita's father, Samuel.""Man On Fire"" far surpasses your run of the mill action movie for several reasons. First of all the script is very well written and the characters are emotionally involving. The plot is relatively believable and high energy.

He aimlessly travels to Mexico to visit ex-comrade Christopher Walken, a mover and shaker down there.  Walken recommends Washington for a job as a bodyguard protecting the vivacious 9 year old Dakota Fanning daughter of wealthy businessman Marc Anthony and attractive wife Radha Mitchell.The aloof and alcoholic Washington gets the job but tries to keep his distance from the friendly and charming child.  Gradually Fanning wears down Washington's resistance and they forge a very solid and caring relationship.  The child is ultimately kidnapped in a plot orchestrated by corrupt policemen with Washington getting severely wounded.By this juncture, Washington had given up the bottle and as he recuperates he commences to exact vengeance against the kidnappers.  In a remorseless reign of terror Washington pulls out all stops to find the young girl.This flick is not recommended for the feint of heart and there are some extremely graphic scenes.

I'm going to kill them all.""So begins Creasy's (Washington's) quest for revenge and annihilation of a kidnapping ring that has created havoc and misery in Mexico City.Creasy's passion is due to the kidnapping of a young girl he was guarding, Pita.  Her presence in his life has transformed this one-time assassin from attempted suicide and whiskey drinker to a man who appreciates life and reads the Bible.The story is thrilling and from the begining has a high level of suspense.  It is incredibly violent, as it shows the cruelty of the kind of people that prey on children and their parents.  The revenge Creasy takes is equally violent but seems reasonable for those kind of people.In the midst of the violence is redemption for Creasy and salvation for others.  The subject of this movie is disturbing but it is very well done I think.  The supporting characters are all played well, and Washington offers a very convincing performance.Definitely entertaining!

At first Creasy is cold, distant even towards Pita, but they soon form a very close friendship and that is slashed to pieces when Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is hospitalized.  While Creasy is under there is a deal made that goes sour and Creasy is informed that young Pita is now dead.

Of course it doesn't last long. Kidnappers are determined to us the girl to gain a ransom.Denzel Washington is a fantastic actor, and in this movie he once again proves how good he is.  This was a tough role to play. He had to do a lot of non-speaking acting in this one - often portraying anguish, edge-of-happiness, and genuine fear of where he may be heading in his life, over and over again.  He pulled it off every time.I enjoyed the entire cast in this movie, and I believe Brian Helgeland did an excellent job on the screenplay.  The film flows really well, reminding me of a documentary - director Tony Scott is amazing at what he does.I have heard some critics say this movie is too violent.  I say no way!  Heck, it had Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken as cast members, and they never killed anyone - that's a non-violent film for those guys!Dakota Fanning performs magnificently as the girl Denzel's character is asked to protect.

The video quality of the DVD is beautiful as well.Back to the movie - I won't give away plot details, but let's just say it's an original approach to the kidnapping/thriller concept.  I really enjoyed the tone of the film and thought it was paced perfectly.  There are two (or three) distinct acts of the script, and after the transition from act one to act two, you're hooked.  One word of caution to those turned off by violence:  there is not a good amount of it in this film, but the violence here is gritty and realistic.  However, based on the context of the violence in the film I thought it was perfectly acceptable and was not in bad taste at all.One minor complaint: I thought the exaggerated subtitles got a bit annoying.  You'll know what I mean after watching the film.  At first I really liked the way they employed this, but there was a point where I thought ""OK, I get it"", but it just kept happening.

Now comes ""Man on Fire"", a film that received less fanfare but generally dismissed by the critics for it's brutality.  This film is enigmatic because it prescribes to the serious issue of kidnapping in Latin America that the solution is brutal vigilanteism.  On the flip side, this film is so well crafted and entertaining that ultimately you just dimiss such concerns and say it's only a movie.  Director Tony Scott surehandedly directs this film from a script by Brian Helgeland(""L.A. Confidential"").  The film's best moments come at the beginning as the relationship unfolds between ex-CIA [...] John Creasy(Denzel Wasington) and the child he his hired to guard, Pita Sanchez(Dakota Fanning).  Washington also does a good job at showing a man whose demons are enveloping him.  It's in the film's second half when Creasy ferrets out the child's kidnappers that you take pause.  It's the methods that border on the sadistic that make you jump back.  But the film does overcome these excesses through the strength of the story and the acting.  There is a strong supporting cast here with Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and Giancarlo Giannini.  I would like to note especially the fine work of Radha Mitchell who plays the girl's mother.

625790,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JN0W,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[12, 13]","Man on Fire is the film The Punisher should've been. Raw and unflinching, it's a gripping story of revenge that doesn't pull any punches - anchored by an electrifying performance from Denzel Washington. Director Tony Scott - never one to shy away from cinematic pyrotechnics - is particularly hyperactive here, pummeling us with rapid cuts and various other Oliver Stone-esque camera tricks. But Scott's short attention span serves the story well, giving the film a slightly off-kilter feel (and effectively mirroring Washington's character's state of mind).The film's setup is straight-forward and direct, with Washington playing John Creasy - an ex-mercenary hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Obviously, something goes wrong at a certain point, and Creasy finds himself forced to revive his long-since dormant military training for revenge purposes. Supporting roles are filled by reliable character actors including Christopher Walken (playing a longtime friend of Creasy's) and Mickey Rourke (as a sleazy lawyer, a character he inhabits with ease).About the only negative thing one can say about Man On Fire - aside from the overlong running time, which doesn't feel terribly oppressive - is that it takes a really long time to get used to Scott's over-the-top directorial decisions (if at all). Certain plot points are somewhat obvious (ie Creasy's relationship with the girl goes from purely business to father figure awfully fast), but such things are expected out of a movie like this. What really matters is whether or not we believe Creasy's attachment to Pita (Dakota Fanning), the girl, and there's no denying that the film excels in that regard. Brian Helgeland's screenplay allows for an unusual amount of character development - it's around an hour before anything sinister happens - which gives us ample time to watch the two characters interact with each other.But when the bad stuff does go down, Creasy's sudden change from cuddly teddy bear to violent man-with-a-mission is completely believable. Like Payback, another Helgeland scripted story, Man on Fire proves to be surprisingly brutal when it comes to onscreen violence. And because we're just as angry as Creasy, it's hard not to root for the man - even when he's stuffing bombs up the rear ends of perpetrators. The single-mindedness of Washington's character propels the story forward, even though the plot essentially vanishes somewhere around the one-hour mark; once the movie becomes about revenge, that's literally all it's about. There's some stuff about police corruption and a journalist that provides Creasy with info, but really, the film devotes itself to Creasy's quest.Man on Fire is entering a marketplace that's crowded with similar films - ie The Punisher, Walking Tall, and Kill Bill: Volume 2 - and though it's not quite up there with the latter, it's surely far better than the former two titles. Washington convincingly sheds his nice guy image to become this gritty character (a character that's far less charismatic than Alonzo Harris, his Training Day persona), delivering a performance that's far different from anything he's done before. It's a film that will likely turn off a lot of viewers - primarily because of Scott's direction and the unforgiving nature of the story - but for those willing to stick with it, Man on Fire is one of the more intelligent and compelling thrillers to come around in a while.4.5 outta' 5.",4,Man on Fire (DVD),1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,3449,"['Man', 'Fire', 'film', 'Punisher', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Raw', 'unflinching', 'gripping', 'story', 'revenge', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'anchored', 'electrifying', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'never', 'one', 'shy', 'away', 'cinematic', 'pyrotechnics', 'particularly', 'hyperactive', 'here', 'pummeling', 'rapid', 'cuts', 'various', 'other', 'Oliver', 'Stone-esque', 'camera', 'tricks', 'Scott', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'story', 'well', 'giving', 'film', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'feel', 'effectively', 'mirroring', 'Washington', 'character', 'state', 'mind', '.The', 'film', 'setup', 'straight-forward', 'direct', 'Washington', 'playing', 'John', 'Creasy', 'ex-mercenary', 'hired', 'protect', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'Obviously', 'something', 'wrong', 'certain', 'point', 'Creasy', 'forced', 'revive', 'long-since', 'dormant', 'military', 'training', 'revenge', 'purposes', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'reliable', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'playing', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Creasy', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'character', 'ease', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'Man', 'Fire', 'aside', 'overlong', 'running', 'time', ""n't"", 'feel', 'terribly', 'oppressive', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'Scott', 'over-the-top', 'directorial', 'decisions', 'Certain', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'somewhat', 'obvious', 'ie', 'Creasy', 'relationship', 'girl', 'purely', 'business', 'father', 'figure', 'awfully', 'fast', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'expected', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'matters', 'not', 'believe', 'Creasy', 'attachment', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'girl', 'denying', 'film', 'excels', 'regard', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'screenplay', 'unusual', 'amount', 'character', 'development', 'hour', 'anything', 'sinister', 'ample', 'time', 'watch', 'two', 'characters', 'interact', 'other.But', 'when', 'bad', 'stuff', 'go', 'down', 'Creasy', 'sudden', 'change', 'cuddly', 'teddy', 'bear', 'violent', 'man-with-a-mission', 'completely', 'believable', 'Payback', 'Helgeland', 'scripted', 'story', 'Man', 'Fire', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'brutal', 'when', 'onscreen', 'violence', ""'re"", 'just', 'as', 'angry', 'Creasy', 'hard', 'not', 'root', 'man', 'even', 'when', 'stuffing', 'bombs', 'up', 'rear', 'ends', 'perpetrators', 'single-mindedness', 'Washington', 'character', 'story', 'forward', 'even', 'plot', 'essentially', 'vanishes', 'somewhere', 'one-hour', 'mark', 'once', 'movie', 'revenge', 'literally', 'about', 'stuff', 'police', 'corruption', 'journalist', 'Creasy', 'info', 'really', 'film', 'Creasy', 'quest.Man', 'Fire', 'entering', 'marketplace', 'crowded', 'similar', 'films', 'ie', 'Punisher', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Volume', '2', 'not', 'quite', 'there', 'latter', 'surely', 'far', 'better', 'former', 'two', 'titles', 'Washington', 'convincingly', 'nice', 'guy', 'image', 'become', 'gritty', 'character', 'character', 'far', 'less', 'charismatic', 'Alonzo', 'Harris', 'Training', 'Day', 'persona', 'delivering', 'performance', 'far', 'different', 'anything', 'done', 'before', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'turn', 'off', 'lot', 'viewers', 'primarily', 'Scott', 'direction', 'unforgiving', 'nature', 'story', 'willing', 'stick', 'Man', 'Fire', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'compelling', 'thrillers', 'come', 'around', 'while.4.5', 'outta', '5']",N/A

Only a great one can pull it off.  Man on Fire definitely does not have a complicated plot.  There are few surprises and one can easily predict what will happen in the next scene.  This film includes the expected sweet little girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), who is guaranteed to pull at your heart strings.  She is adorable, innocent, and all that other mushy stuff.  Denzel Washington (John Creasey) portrays the conventional former American secret agent who one upon a time ruthlessly dealt with our country's enemies.  Reading the Bible helps to unburden Creasey's guilty soul, but alcohol helps him get through the day. He is traveling through Mexico when a buddy from the old days, Rayburn (Christopher Walken), persuades him to earn some money as the body guard of Pita.  Abductions are an everyday event in this one step above a third world country.  Corrupt police are a ho-hum reality.  The well-to-do are constantly targeted, and Pita's family will be no exception.  Criminals grab her, something goes wrong during the exchange of money for the child, and you should be able to figure out the rest for yourself.Now comes what you really desire to see in this movie: John Creasey exacting revenge on the bad guys.  The dude punishes the evil doers in some unpleasant ways.  It's gory, brutal---and very satisfying.  Gratuitous violence can sometimes be rewarding.  Hey, we all can't be another Mahatma Ghandi!

It has a little gory split, but still the plot is the most important thing.I want to say I'm definitively for Denzel Washington. He has convinced me at least. So far, I was wondering why he had received an Oscar for a nasty film as ""Training Day"". I wanted to see him involved in a good role and a good plot. But now I see he is a genius. He shows all features in this film: cold, warm, impassible, tender, mischevious, struggler. A superb performance.Good words are also for the director, the writer and the director of photography. I think they have gathered together in a very interesting group. The story is fantastic and localizations are very close to reality. I was impressed also for the correct performance of the best-known-as-singer Marc Anthony. I'm very little confident in every singer who makes a film (remember Madonna?) but in this case he, at least, passes.Finally, I had to mention little Dakota. I don't know how can so many good little girls appear in our times. In my previous reviews I have mentioned the good performances of girls in ""Jersey Girl"" and ""In America"". But Dakota is not only a good actress. She is lovely, charming and delicious. Where will all of these girls go? I wonder.I left out the fifth star because of the absence of additional stuff in the DVD, but regarding to the film, I also think there were some moments of gratious violence.I liked the story, some parts are memorable, as everybody is saying: ""a bullet always tells the truth"".

Washington plays Creasy, a former marine that is haunted by the those things he had to do in service to his country.  He struggles with God and agonizes over his past.  This malaise has manifested in a drinking problem.  On a trip to Mexico, Creasy meets up a comrade named Rayburn, played by Christopher Walken.  Rayburn encourages Creasy to take a job in Mexico City.Apparently, there is a severe kidnapping problem in Mexico.  Many prominent businessmen take out kidnapping policies on themselves and their families.  One of the requirements of the insurance policy is that they hire a bodyguard.  Creasy is hired by Samuel, played by Marc Anthony, at a discounted rate due to Creasy's drinking problem.  Samuel has a daughter named Pita, played by Dakota Fanning, that Creasy is hired specifically to protect.At first, Creasy resists developing a friendship with Pita.  However, he soon softens and develops a mentor role with the young lady.  This mentorship helps redeem Creasy...and then Pita is kidnapped while under Creasy's watch...As mentioned earlier, this is a dark film.  Washington's role is considerably darker than many of his other roles with notable exception of his role in 'Training Day.'  The difference is that despite what Creasy is capable of, he is still likeable.  What Creasy is capable of is some monstrous acts of revenge.Walken, although his role is limited, is also superb.  Unlike some of his recent roles, his performance in this film is comprehenisble and first rate.  Marc Anthony and Dakota Fanning also perform admirably.This movie is about redemption and revenge.  The themes are not subtle in the least.  Fans of revenge flicks will probably enjoy this film.  Those that like action may be a bit disappointed by the pace.  There is some predictability to this film as far as the story goes, but not in the acting.

Any movie headlined by Denzel Washington translates into an instant spellbinder; Washington puts an extra gear into all of his roles.  Yet the gritty, malevolent, gratuitous violence of this film transcends Washington's powerful acting--and it's violence enhanced, yet ultimately punished, by director Tony Scott's eery cinematography.The plot is certainly nothing original:  A man with emotional baggage befriends a youngster (a precocious Dakota Fanning), then embarks on a one-man apocalyptic quest to avenge a kidnapping gone awry.  Yet this is not your grandmother's quest for vengeance; Washington punishes the bad guys until your stomach flip-flops, and his brooding protagonism is amplified by camera shots and angles and blurs and stop-motion and hand-held sequences. . .compelling cinematography so dominant it eventally interferes with the story itself.  And because much of this movie (set in a very urban Mexico City) is in Spanish, director Scott dubiously inserts subtitles--even when the dialogue is in broken English.Scott is also the star of this DVD's extra features; he tells us, gleefully, about shooting the auto smash-ups, dusting off and using an old 1910-ish winding camera--he even recalls a delightful story about his bodyguard getting beaten up by gangbangers during a late-night filmmaking session in the bowels of Mexico City.  This is all good stuff, and only enhances the ""ick"" factor of this most troubling film.

It's refreshing, frankly, to see a good guy who wastes every villain he can get his hands on, with brutality and an utter lack of remorse. No namby pampy political correctness here. Good to see bad guys die horribly. The problem here is the film's length. Way too much set up of the hero's thawing-out at the hands of the little girl. Very slow moving first hour; desperately needed a 20-30 minute cut.

625805,A1XY3SJZLJIXSI,B00005JN0W,"D. Ross ""http://directorblue.blogspot.com""","[4, 4]","This screen adaptation of the A.J. Quinnell novel has received mixed reviews, but I found it remained generally true to the spirit of the book.Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a broken-down, alcoholic, ex-special forces assassin.  Visiting his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) in Mexico City, he ends up taking a job as a bodyguard to make ends meet.  A kidnapping spree has spread throughout Latin America and a wealthy young couple hires Creasy to protect their young daughter.  Less concerned with her safety, their primary reason for hiring him is to fulfill the terms of a kidnap-insurance policy.Pita (Dakota Fanning)'s spunk and unabashed friendliness slowly penetrate Creasy's veil of pain and alcoholism.  Soon, he's not only protecting her, but is also coaching her at swimming and helping with studies.  Then, in the turning point of the film, despite Creasy's quick-witted defense, Pita is kidnapped from her piano lesson and Creasy left for dead with multiple gunshot wounds.Corrupt cops, mobsters, and other officials are all taking their cuts from the kidnapping game.  As Creasy begins to recover, he sets off on the ultimate roadtrip of revenge.  And all hell breaks loose.I rated this film four stars.  Tony Scott has to tone down the nausea-inducing quick cuts, fades, over-exposures, and other tricks of the trade.  When he gets into story-telling mode, he does his best work, as Fanning and Washington are nearly perfect in their roles.  Do yourself a service and read the books.

625806,A2TI8XP8GY1RO1,B00005JN0W,DukeOfEarl,"[1, 1]","This movie surpassed my expectations since I didn't hear too much about it, or even a lot of praise from critics while it was in theatres. I am glad I picked this one up. We're used to seeing Denzel in dramatic movies, and I won't go any further than stating that Denzel is my favorite actor to watch and study as an aspiring dramatic actor myself. Anyhow, his performance here harks back to most recently ""Training Day."" It's mind-boggling to think which of his performances this year should be nominated for an Oscar (this one or his ""Manchurian Candidate"" performance).This was a pretty enthralling and watchable film, although it started hitting some speed bumps after the first hour. I really enjoyed the story up until about 50 minutes into the film, when a major event happens (I won't reveal). I like how Creasy (Washington) was impenetrable at first to the family and girl he bodyguards for, but then he starts taking an interest in little Dakota. Dakota plays Pita, and gives quite a memorable performance for a young actress. The first scene between Creasy and Christopher Walken's character was too formal and conventional, but both really start turning up the heat not long after. Even J. Lo's Marc Anthony (as Pita's father) gives a good performance but ends up shooting himself because of how being married to J. Lo this long has boggled his mind! Just kidding.Needless to say, Creasy goes on a relentless tear of vengence in the second half of the film, and I like it because there is a real emotional cause behind it unlike a lot of action movies. You know there is a point to all the violence and something drastic will emerge at the ending. Denzel is more than smooth and believable on his rampage (similar to his ""Training Day"" invulnerabity). He was just beginning to get his appreciation for life back, and the very thing that caused that was taken from him. There are a couple twists in the plot, and a heartfelt ending. However, they never bothered to show where Creasy was living out of and where he kept getting a change of clothes in the second half of the movie. Oh well...""Man On Fire"" has a pretty fresh plot, an excellent performance from the lead (what else could you expect from Denzel?), an extended period of action and revenge with a reason, yet this movie is almost ruined. I think the director (Tony Scott) had some nice, fresh ideas going for him, but he takes it too far with all the schizoid camera shots, color-changes, and hard-rock music. It ends up being way, way too overbearing. It seems like he's trying too hard to make it modern and cutting-edge. This aside, you have a solid movie, that I think of more highly now than when I was actually watching it. Those camera and directing quirks still can't take away from what this film has going for it. It may not be among the best of movies that Denzel has been a part of, but ""Man On Fire"" shall satisfy fans of many different genres. Denzel fans, drama fans, action fans, (even violence fans) check this one out!

I was pleased with the outcome. The movie was sad, action-packed, always interesting, and greatly acted. The film stars Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Dakota Fanning, and Radha Mitchell. In brief, ""Man on Fire"" is about a man who is the bodyguard of a young girl, and when she is kidnapped, he will stop at nothing to get her back, and find the people who did it, and kill them. But it is much more than that. It is a look at the affect that people could have on others, and a look at corruption, greed, and other things that could kill a man's spirit. At a running time of 146 minutes, ""Man on Fire"" is an epic look into what a man would do to save another person.Denzel Washington plays John Creasy. He has just been hired to be the bodyguard to young Pita, the daughter of Samuel and Lisa Ramos, after his friend Rayburn convinced them to interview him for the job. Creasy has a drinking problem, and he tells this to Samuel before getting the job. Pita thinks that Creasy is a friend, a point that he tells her after too much friendly talk. The two eventually bond when she asks for help from him for her swimming races. Then, a problem occurs. While waiting for her to finish her piano lession, corrupt Mexican cops, and other people come and kidnap her, wounding Creasy, and leaving him under arrest for the murder of two cops. Mexican investigator Miguel Manzano knows that Creasy did not kill the cops, and with the help of him and news reporter Mariana, Creasy goes off to find revenge on the people who kidnapped Pita, and who is now reported dead.""Man on Fire"" is not a great film, but it is very entertaining and includes some powerful preformances. Denzel Washington should be nominated for an Oscar from his preformance as John Creasy, and in some scenes young Dakota Fanning steals some of the scenes from him. In reguard to the twist at the end, I did not see anything coming. It is an epic that does not actually feel long. I would see ""Man on Fire"" again, but I don't recommend it to all. There is some gritty, dark violence, but that is not a problem. The problem is the way the film is shot. It is always moving around, and that got a little annoying at some times.

This was an awesome movie with excellent acting (mostly). Denzel Washington was awesome and was pretty much the whole movie, but I felt Christopher Walken was underused here.

She is such a good actress, and is so young.Now to the plot of the film. Creasy (Washington) is a burnt out acholic who travels down to Mexico City to visit his friend Rayburn (Walken). Rayburn tells him of a job involing protecting Samuel Ramos' (Marc Anthony) daughter Pinta(Fanning). At first Creasy is very serious and unsocial, but then begins to care for the girl. Once she is kidnapped it causes serious problems.In closing this movie is awesome (I've said this like three times now). Denzel Washington is excellent (wow is there an echo).

625812,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JN0W,Erik North,"[0, 1]","Based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel of the same name, MAN ON FIRE, despite some flaws, is one of the better ation movies of recent times, thanks to superlative performances from Denzel Washington (no surprise there) and 10 year-old Dakota Fanning.In it, Washington plays a former counterinsurgency agent now down on his luck and prone to drinking Jack Daniels like they're going to reinstate Prohibition tomorrow.  But he is offered a chance from a longtime friend (Christopher Walken) to redeem himself by protecting the young daughter (Fanning) of a prominent Mexico City businessman (Marc Antony).  Although he finds both the job and Fanning onerous to be around at first, he eventually develops a bond with the young girl, whose talents involve swimming and playing the piano.  It is that bond that will drive him to get back in the killing business when he is shot twice outside the house where Fanning takes piano lessons, and the young girl is kidnapped.  Fueled by rage and disgusted at the corruption of Mexican officials who not only allowed the kidnapping to happen but even may have taken part in it, Washington works his way up the chain of command in a kidnapping gang known as ""La Hermanindad"" (The Brotherhood) to get Fanning back.MAN ON FIRE is flawed to a certain degree by the hyperactive directing style of Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), which involves herky-jerky camera work, different film stocks, and mind-warping editing, techniques that are not really new to him (and which had been perfected by Oliver Stone in JFK and NATURAL BORN KILLERS).  Also, the stereotyping of Mexicans here as evil and vicious killers and/or kidnappers is a bit much.  And yet, what makes MAN ON FIRE work as well as it does is that bond that develops between Washington and Fanning early on.  It gives Washington's subsequent killing spree a greater meaning than just another 21st century DEATH WISH bloodbath.

625821,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005JN0W,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","My Bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Man On Fire"" starring Denzel Washington. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was quite a good movie, but not for the squeamish. The movie came in two very different parts. The first part was a relatively quiet introduction in which a burned-out ex-CIA agent (Washington) was hired to be the bodyguard of a charming little girl (Dakota Fanning). The locale was Juarez, Mexico, and there had been problems with kidnappers. The first part introduced the family, Washington and his contacts, the city and the Mexican environment where all of this took place. This first part was rather charming and low keyed.The introduction ended abruptly with the kidnapping of the little girl under watch in a bloody gun fight in which Washington was badly wounded. A demand for a pile of money was made in exchange for the girl's safe return. Well, that was a major mistake on the part of the perpetrators. When Washington recovered from his gunshot wounds, he turned into one tough hombre who would make Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" episodes look like a children's Sunday-school picnic. Ruthless? Oh, yeah. Police procedures were out the window. Washington tracked down the kidnappers one by one and their arrest, trial, sentencing and punishment were carried out right there on the spot. You may find it difficult to watch. In any case, almost everyone was corrupt in one way or another, even the little girl's father, but the sweet little girl was safely returned to her mother, sadder but wiser.The movie is well acted and directed. The action of the second half is brisk and very violent.

625828,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JN0W,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","MAN ON FIRE is a brilliant film for many reasons: the script by Brian Helgeland is right up  there with his 'Mystic River' and 'LA Confidential', the direction by Tony Scott delivers an almost unbearable exposition of violence and evil while equally metering that aspect with some of the finest moments of acting from his cast that they have ever given, the cinematography is color saturated and creatively shot and edited in a way that propels the force of the story in a Grand Guignol manner, and last - the acting by the principals (and the supporting roles) is first rate.  Briefly, Creasy (Washington) is a burned out alcoholic victim of sensory devastation from being a special ops assassin for the US Intelligence and is called by his old comrade in arms Rayburn (Christopher Walken - in a dynamically rich characterization) to take on the role of bodyguard in Mexico City for a wealthy family's (Marc Anthony ad Radha Mitchell) precocious daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning, who continues to mature into a very fine actress).  Mexico City is seeing kidnapping at an all time high and the 'police force' is so corrupt that everyone is in jeopardy.  Yes, Pita is kidnapped and Creasy, despite severe bodily injury at the time he attempts to abort the kidnapping, recovers and spends his life 'on fire' with revenge, destined to kill everyone who had anything at all to do with what he feels is the death of Pita.  The reason this story works so very well is the powerful, though slow, process of Creasy allowing himself to find spiritual redemption in the love of Pita, a child with more healing powers in her indomitable nature than a legion of nuns and priests.  This relationship as created by Washington and Fanning through Scott's cautious eye is one of the more beautiful definitions of 'friendship' ever filmed.The supporting cast is peppered by both luminaries and newcomers and each gives full throttle performances that never fall into excess:  Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin, and the already mentioned Chistopher Walken, Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell.  Yes, this is a violent film: our world is a violent place and when money reigns over right/wrong situations, impossibly terrible things can happen.  Yet, violent though this film is, I feel that violence and the way in which it is depicted and manipulated by the camera is justified to shake the audience into accepting facts we don't want to see.  If Oscars have not been pre-decided, then Washington and Fanning are definitely candidates.

So devoted that, when she dies [I erred here; she does not die -- it is Hollywood, duh!!!] at the hands of kidnappers, Washington goes on a killing rampage in Mexico City. Of course, Denzel zips around Mexico City like he's a native. He buys weapons like he's a native. In a matter of hours he's found the killers and the manipulators.This is truly the Ugly American in Mexico City.He is withdrawn and surly. He is reluctant to talk. He broods and drinks. Why doesn't he just go back to his native New Jersey where there is no violence, no bad guys and no one worth saving? Where there are no crooked cops?Here is the problem with this story/film: there is a heavy element of racism. A dead American necessitates the killing of countless Mexicans. Bad guys, yes, but killed in the streets. He's the judge and executioner. And in heinous ways. So what makes Denzel's character any better? Well, he has miliary op training, so that gives him a license to kill. Especially ""foreigners"" in their own country.So, what are the prospects of sparks between the mom, played by Radha Mitchell, and Washington? There is a moment in the movie when it seems possible, but then I thought back to Washington's quotes years back that indicated he would not kiss a white woman on the screen, saying Hollywood does not make black women desireable on the silver screen, I just knew that would not happen.And he once told Will Smith to NEVER kiss a man on the silver screen. So there goes the chance of sparks between he and Marc Anthony, who plays the dad.As to Dakota Fanning, the movie makes her into am adult child.She talks and flirts like a 20-year-old. Her vocabulary is excellent. She has wisdom of a 50-year-old. In other words a child who is not believable. And it is creepy the way Fanning flirts with Washington.This film has one thing going for it. Extreme violence: Explosions. Knifings. Gunfire. Mutilations. It's a great film for 20-year-olds who like never-ending violence.And what's with the bloated Denzel Washington? Did he gain 30 pounds to be the alcoholic he acts out? Does he need more fiber in his diet to ease his inner turmoil?Like I said, maybe his character needs to go back to Jersey. But when he bonds with another child and if that child is hurt, will he go on a killing spree in jersey to avene that death? hardly.See the movie for yourself.

He plays John Creasy, once at the top of his game in the CIA, but now he's an alcoholic that takes a job as a bodyguard in Mexico City, where there are so many kidnappings that it made me feel very depressed and sad. He is to protect young Pita, played beautifully by Dakota Fanning. The movie is so powerful and sweet though thanks to the first half of the movie. In this section, Creasy becomes nicer and nicer thanks to Pita, and he falls in love with this little girl. They are now best friends, and now Creasy is no longer an alcoholic thanks to his great friendship with Pita. But when Pita gets kidnapped and Creasy gets shot, things go awry. Creasy awakens in the hospital and he is accused of having killed two cops who helped kidnap her. Creasy is released and is informed that Pita is supposively dead because the ransom exchange went awry. Creasy now is really mad and is bent on revenge. He gets some big guns and declares that he will kill everyone that was involved with the kidnapping. This section is very violent as Creasy chops off people's fingers, and wires bombs to one guy's but. Creasy is determined to show no mercy. This movie is very powerful and emotional. I almost cried because this is based on atrue story and kidnappings do occur sooooooooo very often in places like this. Washington and Fanning are both very powerful and the movie is built around them and their bond until the kidnapping. It shows that Creasy fears not his death but only wants to get revenge even if this means his death. The movie will have you laughing, maybe even crying or just staring in awe at what Creasy does.

He plays the bodyguard of a nine-year-old girl who lives in Mexico City, and he can be thoughtful during the softer moments of the movie, and rough during the more violent moments. This is a good movie to see if you're into intense action scenes. The violence in the movie mostly involves people with blood all over their bodies, severed body parts, and people getting shot. You might also want to see this movie if you like watching films that make references to spirituality. Christianity plays a role in Denzel's life, as well as Pita's mom's life after he daughter disappears.While those are all good aspects of the film, I didn't like the special effects and cinematography. When Denzel's character is searching for the people responsible for Pita's disappearance, the producers run special effects to show emphasis on his actions. I'm sure the producers had good intentions, and wanted to use these techniques to make the movie more suspenseful, but I think the movie could be much better without it. Since it's important to pay attention to the rapidly changing situations in the movie, the special effects bog you down, and after they've been used again and again, they really become more of a headache than anything else.Even though the special effects of the movie should have been edited out, much of the rest of the movie shines.

And without anyunnecessary ""love interest"". Which was your favourite scene? Mine wasthe moment before ""crossing the bridge"" near the end *(can't say morefor obvious reasons). Like in Gladiator, but probably creating far better empathyfor it's more related to ""something we could all eventually do"". The scene with ""Fuentes"" (the Mexican chief of the brotherhood) is alsovery good, even funny in a sick sort of way. The kind of image youremember long after the film is gone.The script is perfect, just following Poe's ""rule"" of ""not one word in vain"". Thanks to Amazon Ijust learnt the auteur is Brian Helgeland (Mystic River, L.A.Confidential). A good story can make or break a movie, no better proofthan this one! Unlike in Gladiator, here our hero has a black past toexpiate, no family to be lost and then revenged. He's got to overcomehimself. As the film presupposes a religious view, we sort of know howthings have to turn out. Notice the importance of religion: Casey'sknowledge by heart of the Bible, and even Samuel's plush sanctuary athis home, full of candles, obviously built for bargaining with theGuadalupana Virgin.The fight at the shanty town isVERY real. The film is not (where did all the dwellers go? How didthe dirty copper get caught by a single man?) but we don't want ""reality principle"" to be part of our films, right :)?Characters: Casey, a ""philosophical copper"" who can learn to feel sorry for somethingexternal to himself steals the movie, the rest of characters are justfilling up space, making things happen. He's no dumbkilling machine, notice how he deals with ""Samuel"" among others. G.Giannini plays a small yet pivotal role. Pita is lovable, but doesn'toverdo it or get sticky. Such gift for acting is rarely seen. Lisa isethereal but not as stupid as we'd expect from her stereotyped role.Walken and Rourke act as naturally as we breathe.""Sociology"": Daniel Sanchez""family first"", Lisa's passivity & machismo and the whole contrastbetween the isolated ultra rich and the numerous very poor is what setsthis film apart from Chuck Norris, Stallone, Van Damme and all theother blockbusters with the same disregard for ""society"" and goodtaste. The phrase: ""I-I'm a professional"" shows how when the system iscorrupt, no individual action could bring lasting change. I think for those of us who inhabit a third world country, this film just shows the future, if not the present if we open our eyes.Director:Judging from his filmography, this is definitely Tony Scott's Masterpiece! It's hardto believe somebody who made films from Spy Game downwards couldachieve something really well done but it's good to remain open minded.Luckily I didn't pay attention to who the director was when I saw it, Ihumbly recommend the viewer to to the same.  I suspect the brothers mustn't be very nice people...""Philosophically"" this filmis of course dangerous: ""Justice by your own hands"" leads to an anomicsociety, and probably even a corrupt state is relatively better than""might makes right"" alla Thrasymachus (Plato's Republic's). JeffShannon on Amazon is as usually accurate: ""both repellently violent andviscerally absorbing"".What glues all together: Music is fine (I couldn't help crying in the end), moving but not overbearing.Photography is just the best, finding beauty where there is none.Edition is alluring but a bit overdone, ""it borrows heavily from MTVvideos"" as ""Flagrant-Baronessa"" on IMDb writes on another of Tony'slesser films, ""Domino"".Remember: ""there's no such thing as tough"".The sheep that got lost.PS: By the way, this film ""endures a 2nd viewing"" as J. L. Borges would quip. In fact I just saw it for the third time on air TV, dubbed into Spanish, and I also felt for Casey, so I guess this proves what a good product it is.",5,Superb action film with a running sociological analysis and redemption story.,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,3958,"['Leave', 'reason', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'relentless', 'justice', 'whatever', 'cost', 'enforcer', 'time', 'wellfilmed', 'acted', 'woman', 'can', 'hold', 'gun', 'anyunnecessary', 'love', 'interest', 'Which', 'was', 'favourite', 'scene', 'Mine', 'wasthe', 'moment', 'crossing', 'bridge', 'end', '*', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'morefor', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Gladiator', 'probably', 'creating', 'far', 'better', 'empathyfor', 'more', 'related', 'something', 'could', 'eventually', 'do', 'scene', 'Fuentes', 'Mexican', 'chief', 'brotherhood', 'alsovery', 'good', 'even', 'funny', 'sick', 'sort', 'way', 'kind', 'image', 'youremember', 'long', 'film', 'gone.The', 'script', 'perfect', 'just', 'following', 'Poe', 'rule', 'not', 'one', 'word', 'vain', 'Thanks', 'Amazon', 'Ijust', 'learnt', 'auteur', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'Mystic', 'River', 'L.A.Confidential', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'movie', 'better', 'proofthan', 'one', 'Gladiator', 'here', 'hero', 'black', 'past', 'toexpiate', 'family', 'be', 'lost', 'then', 'revenged', 'got', 'overcomehimself', 'film', 'religious', 'view', 'sort', 'know', 'howthings', 'have', 'turn', 'out', 'Notice', 'importance', 'religion', ""Casey'sknowledge"", 'heart', 'Bible', 'even', 'Samuel', 'plush', 'sanctuary', 'athis', 'home', 'full', 'candles', 'obviously', 'built', 'bargaining', 'theGuadalupana', 'Virgin.The', 'fight', 'shanty', 'town', 'isVERY', 'real', 'film', 'not', 'where', 'did', 'dwellers', 'go', 'How', 'didthe', 'dirty', 'copper', 'get', 'caught', 'single', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reality', 'principle', 'be', 'part', 'films', 'right', 'Characters', 'Casey', 'philosophical', 'copper', 'who', 'can', 'learn', 'feel', 'sorry', 'somethingexternal', 'movie', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'justfilling', 'up', 'space', 'making', 'things', 'happen', 'dumbkilling', 'machine', 'notice', 'how', 'Samuel', 'others', 'G.Giannini', 'small', 'yet', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Pita', 'lovable', 'get', 'sticky', 'Such', 'gift', 'acting', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Lisa', 'isethereal', 'not', 'as', 'stupid', ""'d"", 'expect', 'stereotyped', 'role.Walken', 'Rourke', 'act', 'as', 'naturally', 'breathe', 'Sociology', 'Daniel', 'Sanchez', 'family', 'first', 'Lisa', 'passivity', 'machismo', 'whole', 'contrastbetween', 'isolated', 'ultra', 'rich', 'numerous', 'very', 'poor', 'what', 'setsthis', 'film', 'apart', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Stallone', 'Van', 'Damme', 'blockbusters', 'same', 'disregard', 'society', 'goodtaste', 'phrase', 'I-I', ""'m"", 'professional', 'how', 'when', 'system', 'iscorrupt', 'individual', 'action', 'could', 'bring', 'lasting', 'change', 'think', 'who', 'inhabit', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'film', 'just', 'future', 'not', 'present', 'open', 'eyes.Director', 'Judging', 'filmography', 'definitely', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Masterpiece', 'hardto', 'believe', 'somebody', 'who', 'made', 'films', 'Spy', 'Game', 'downwards', 'couldachieve', 'something', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'good', 'remain', 'open', 'minded.Luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'who', 'director', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'Ihumbly', 'recommend', 'viewer', 'same', 'suspect', 'brothers', 'must', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'nice', 'people', 'Philosophically', 'filmis', 'course', 'dangerous', 'Justice', 'own', 'hands', 'anomicsociety', 'probably', 'even', 'corrupt', 'state', 'relatively', 'better', 'might', 'right', 'alla', 'Thrasymachus', 'Plato', 'Republic', 'JeffShannon', 'Amazon', 'usually', 'accurate', 'repellently', 'violent', 'andviscerally', 'absorbing', 'together', 'Music', 'fine', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'crying', 'end', 'moving', 'not', 'overbearing.Photography', 'just', 'best', 'finding', 'beauty', 'where', 'none.Edition', 'alluring', 'bit', 'overdone', 'heavily', 'MTVvideos', 'Flagrant-Baronessa', 'IMDb', ""Tony'slesser"", 'films', 'Domino', '.Remember', 'such', 'thing', 'tough', '.The', 'sheep', 'got', 'lost.PS', 'way', 'film', '2nd', 'viewing', 'J.', 'L.', 'Borges', 'would', 'quip', 'fact', 'just', 'saw', 'third', 'time', 'air', 'TV', 'dubbed', 'Spanish', 'also', 'felt', 'Casey', 'guess', 'what', 'good', 'product']",N/A

625840,A1KHWLUBS5IK4Q,B00005JN0W,janebbooks,"[1, 1]","MAN ON FIRE is a 2004 American thriller film and the second adaptation of A. J. Quinnell's 1980 first of five Creasy novels. The first film based on the novel was released in 1987 by a French/Italian company and starred Scott Glenn, Joe Pesci and Brooke Adams.Actors: Denzel Washington, DAkota Fanning, Christopher Walken, Radha Michell, Marc Anthony, Mickey Rourke, Giancarlo GianniniDirector: Tony ScottWriters: A.J. Quinnell, Brian HelgelanRated: R (Restricted)DVD Release Date: September 14, 2004Run Time: 146 minutesPLOT: Because of the extremely high rate of kidnappings in Mexico City for ransom money, businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) seeks a bodyguard through a Mexican security firm run by Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) and hires Rayburn's buddy, a former U.S. Special Operations soldier officer John Creasy (Denzel Washington) to guard his nine-year-old daughter ""Pita"" (Dakota Fanning). At first Creasy distances himself from the young girl, but the two soon develop a friendship. After Pita is kidnapped and the ransom of $10M is hijacked, Creasy vows to kill all involved in Pita's abduction and murder, including members of two Mexican crime syndicates and a few corrupt police.TRIVIA:...Tony Scott, the director, tried to have a version of the film made in 1983, but since the film would have been his second after The Hunger, Paul Davies, a journal article author, theorized that movie producers thought Scott lacked the experience to direct the film....At the time of the first film, Italy was the major center of kidnapping in the world. After Scott persisted and 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to MAN ON FIRE for him, they wanted the film to be set in Italy. An early draft of the film script was set in Naples. Scott argued that if the setting would be Italy, then the film would have to be a period piece, since by the 2000s kidnappings became a rare occurrence in Italy. And so Mexico City, still having a high kidnapping rate, became the setting of the 2004 film. The characters' names were changed from Italian to Mexican ones....Robert De Niro was originally offered the role of Creasy....Dakota Fanning was nominated for best young actress 2005 for a Critics Choice Award....Scott's adaption was very successful (cost $70 million to make...had box office of over $130 million worldwide) despite the fact that MAN ON FIRE was released in theaters just one week after two other revenge genre films: Kill Bill Volume 2 and The Punisher.A. J. Quinnell was very pleased with the 2004 film adaption for it used many of the quotes from his novel. Here's a sample:CREASY:. Okay, my friend. It's off to the next life for you. I guarantee, you won't be lonely.. Revenge is a meal best served cold.. Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.RAYBURN:. A man can be an artist ... in anything... It depends on how good he is at it. Creasy's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece.. He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals. Just stay out of his way.. A bullet always tells the truth.DIALOGUESamuel: Your resume is quite impressive. 16 years of military experience, extensive counter-terrorism work. I'm surprised anyone could afford you, what's the catch?Creasy: I drink.Samuel: How does that affect you?Creasy: Coordination, reaction time. Top professionals try to kidnap your daughter I'll do the best I can but the service will be on par with the pay.MY REACTION: 4 stars out of 5. Bored the other night and channel-surfing, WGN TV at 8:03pm was beginning this movie with a scene between Rayburn and Creasy about the ""bodyguard"" job. I like these two guys....and spent a pleasant 2 1/2 hours often standing up and cheering (those were some serious bad guys). The cinematography was impressive...nice scenes of Mexico...settings from homes of the wealthy to squalor for the bad guys. I wonder why they didn't make a sequel? Quinnell published five novels featuring his character, Creasy: Man on Fire (1980), The Perfect Kill (1992), The Blue Ring (1993), Black Horn (1994), Message from Hell (1996). He was working on a sixth, tentatively titled Priests of a Dead God, at the time of his death in 2005.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",4,A timeless revenge movie...,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,4299,"['MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', '2004', 'American', 'thriller', 'film', 'second', 'adaptation', 'A.', 'J.', 'Quinnell', '1980', 'first', 'five', 'Creasy', 'novels', 'first', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'was', 'released', '1987', 'French/Italian', 'company', 'starred', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Brooke', 'Adams.Actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'DAkota', 'Fanning', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Radha', 'Michell', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Giancarlo', 'GianniniDirector', 'Tony', 'ScottWriters', 'A.J', 'Quinnell', 'Brian', 'HelgelanRated', 'R', 'Restricted', 'DVD', 'Release', 'Date', 'September', '14', '2004Run', 'Time', '146', 'minutesPLOT', 'extremely', 'high', 'rate', 'kidnappings', 'Mexico', 'City', 'ransom', 'money', 'businessman', 'Samuel', 'Ramos', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'bodyguard', 'Mexican', 'security', 'firm', 'run', 'Paul', 'Rayburn', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Rayburn', 'buddy', 'former', 'U.S.', 'Special', 'Operations', 'soldier', 'officer', 'John', 'Creasy', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'guard', 'nine-year-old', 'daughter', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'first', 'Creasy', 'distances', 'young', 'girl', 'two', 'soon', 'develop', 'friendship', 'Pita', 'kidnapped', 'ransom', '10M', 'hijacked', 'Creasy', 'kill', 'involved', 'Pita', 'abduction', 'murder', 'including', 'members', 'two', 'Mexican', 'crime', 'syndicates', 'few', 'corrupt', 'police.TRIVIA', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'director', 'tried', 'have', 'version', 'film', 'made', '1983', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'second', 'Hunger', 'Paul', 'Davies', 'journal', 'article', 'author', 'theorized', 'movie', 'producers', 'thought', 'Scott', 'lacked', 'experience', 'direct', 'film', 'time', 'first', 'film', 'Italy', 'was', 'major', 'center', 'kidnapping', 'world', 'Scott', 'persisted', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'acquired', 'rights', 'MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'set', 'Italy', 'early', 'draft', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'set', 'Naples', 'Scott', 'argued', 'setting', 'would', 'be', 'Italy', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'period', 'piece', '2000s', 'kidnappings', 'became', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'Italy', 'so', 'Mexico', 'City', 'still', 'having', 'high', 'kidnapping', 'rate', 'became', 'setting', '2004', 'film', 'characters', 'names', 'were', 'changed', 'Italian', 'Mexican', 'ones', '.Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'originally', 'offered', 'role', 'Creasy', '.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'young', 'actress', '2005', 'Critics', 'Choice', 'Award', '.Scott', 'adaption', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'cost', '70', 'million', 'make', 'had', 'box', 'office', '130', 'million', 'worldwide', 'fact', 'MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'just', 'one', 'week', 'two', 'other', 'revenge', 'genre', 'films', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Volume', '2', 'Punisher.A', 'J.', 'Quinnell', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', '2004', 'film', 'adaption', 'used', 'many', 'quotes', 'novel', 'Here', 'sample', 'CREASY', 'Okay', 'friend', 'next', 'life', 'guarantee', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'lonely..', 'Revenge', 'meal', 'best', 'served', 'cold..', 'Forgiveness', 'God', 'job', 'arrange', 'meeting.RAYBURN', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'artist', 'anything', 'how', 'good', 'Creasy', 'art', 'death', 'paint', 'masterpiece..', ""'ll"", 'deliver', 'more', 'justice', 'weekend', 'ten', 'years', 'courts', 'tribunals', 'Just', 'stay', 'out', 'way..', 'bullet', 'always', 'truth.DIALOGUESamuel', 'resume', 'quite', 'impressive', '16', 'years', 'military', 'experience', 'extensive', 'counter-terrorism', 'work', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'anyone', 'could', 'afford', 'what', 'catch', 'Creasy', 'drink.Samuel', 'How', 'affect', 'Coordination', 'reaction', 'time', 'Top', 'professionals', 'try', 'kidnap', 'daughter', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'can', 'service', 'will', 'be', 'par', 'pay.MY', 'REACTION', '4', 'stars', '5', 'Bored', 'other', 'night', 'channel-surfing', 'WGN', 'TV', '8:03pm', 'was', 'beginning', 'movie', 'scene', 'Rayburn', 'Creasy', 'bodyguard', 'job', 'two', 'guys', '.and', 'spent', 'pleasant', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'often', 'standing', 'up', 'cheering', 'were', 'serious', 'bad', 'guys', 'cinematography', 'was', 'impressive', 'nice', 'scenes', 'Mexico', 'settings', 'homes', 'wealthy', 'squalor', 'bad', 'guys', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sequel', 'Quinnell', 'published', 'five', 'novels', 'featuring', 'character', 'Creasy', 'Man', 'Fire', '1980', 'Perfect', 'Kill', '1992', 'Blue', 'Ring', '1993', 'Black', 'Horn', '1994', 'Message', 'Hell', '1996', 'was', 'working', 'sixth', 'tentatively', 'titled', 'Priests', 'Dead', 'God', 'time', 'death', '2005.']",N/A

Whereas some may go in opposition of their nice-guy faade for a sappy, genre-bridging attempt at drama (I'm talking to you Jim Carey), others, like Denzel Washington, have embraced the dark side of his repertoire, and taken on roles in which their characters are disturbed at best, and borderline maniacal at worst.Man on Fire is part revenge, part crisis, a movie that plays upon humanity's protective nature and sympathies for children.  John W. Creasy (Washington) is a former soldier whose expertise is in death-dealing; he is a firearms, demolitions, and battle expert who has many notches on his belt of death.  Unfortunately, his propensity for alcohol has diminished his skills and marketability, and has led him to Mexico to work as a bargain-bin bodyguard for a wealthy family.  His mission is to protect Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of Samuel (Marc Anthony) and Lisa (Radha Mitchell).  As Pita is quick to point out - and quote stats - there are a bunch of kidnappings in Mexico City, especially when there are unprotected children of prosperous foreign families running around.Sure enough, Pita is kidnapped, and the Pandora's Box of Creasy's vengeance is opened.  I can't really blame the abductors; Creasy didn't look imposing.  However, his worn-down but determined visage belies the cauldron of vindictive sadism ready to explode on anyone and anything that gets in his way.From there the direction of the movie uses a jerky, staccato filming style to convey the internal grief of the characters and the impending chaos that Creasy is about to unleash as he uncovers those responsible for the kidnapping.  I especially like the interactions between Creasy and the Spanish-speaking criminals, as the translation is shown on-screen in a very unique manner, adding to the frantic feel that the window of opportunity to save Pita may be eroding.  Along the way he receives help from a friendly journlist (Rachel Ticotin) hell-bent on removing the veil from the face of police corruption.  He also gets assistance from a former soldier buddy (Chrisopher Walken), who refers to Creasy's skill as a soldier and a killer by stating that Creasy is an artist of death about to paint a masterpiece.I love the film,, but had trouble feeling any remorse for Creasy.  The film sets up for redemption, and plays upon the audience's pathos, but the effort (which works for Pita) just doesn't work well for Creasy - possibly a direct result of his passion for revenge and muder juxtaposed against his seemingly pious regret aimed at his carnage-filled past.

We can believe that Denzel recovers from a emotionally dead state to caring about life because of his relationship with a little girl. The movie is dark and it should be. The plot is simple, but proceeds with energy. You know what Denzel's character is going to do next, but how he does it is never boring. All the characters are drawn well. The movie uses some symbolism and images very well to tie the plot together and to reveal Denzel's mental states.The bad points are the editing and the flashbacks. The movie uses a variety of techniques with light and film speed. The flashbacks or imaginings are done with hundreds of almost static images thrown at the screen in no particular order. It is confusing at times, although at other times it works. The other point is the lighting. Many of the faces are obscured by shadows.

Justice?  Nope.  Immediate, bloody revenge.  Still, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the cinematography and exciting storyline which reminds us, once again, that Mexico City is not a nice place.  And despite what the critics of this film might say--hey, maybe they should go visit MC for awhile, not in the polished sections, but in the actual city, come back and leave a few comments.  If they survive, of course!This film starts out as a nightmarish descent into the psyche of a man of who has done very bad things during his life in the service of the U.S. Government, one of the chief flaws being that we never discover exactly what they were or why.  Hints are dropped but the theme of ""redemption through finger flaying/anal tube bombs"" would have worked out a lot better if we knew *who* John Creasy really was before the adorable little Dakota Fanning, daughter of a rich Mexican construction bigwig and a sort of blonde statue of a wife (Radha Mitchell was terrible in this movie, mechanical as Johnny Five with no voice) was kidnapped under his watch as drunk bodyguard.  The implications in these movies is that if someone was in the CIA, they must have monstrous MacGyver moves up their sleeves and a lot to regret.  I believe the former, since this was made during the reign of Bush/Cheney.When the girl is taken, what seems to be a straightforward tale of vengeance veers into something much more grisly and mysterious.  People are involved who definitely shouldn't be involved a la Jon Benet Ramsey.  This fuels Creasy's rage, as puzzles pop up (Mickey Rourke, one of the best actors out there today, helps make the movie playing the family's slimeball lawyer) which point in an unpleasant direction.Creasy's methods for extracting information are not bashful.  They seem expressly designed, in fact, to depersonalize their targets and rob them of their criminal pride, so bad are they.  Without screwing up the plot for anyone, though the ""hidden ending"" about the girl's welfare isn't too hard to understand, this is about a very capable man who feels as though his only reason for living, an innocent with joy the world has yet to take from her, is gone.  And worse.  What follows is a nightmare with a *tinge* of redemption.It succeeds.  Still, as a nation, we should sometimes wonder what it is that relishes revenge so much and not straight forward redemption.  It'd save us a lot of senseless wars.",4,"""You. What about you?

They've also done this for The Day After Tomorrow and I, Robot in order to promote Fantastic Four in theaters. Fox is also re-releasing Dodgeball on DVD with one minute of extra footage, but no new features. There are also rumors that Fox will be re-releasing Die Hard Collector's Edition sometime this year or next to tie in to the release of Die Hard 4.0 (whenever it finally gets made, that is). It seems Fox has reversed -- they used to release Special Editions first (Fight Club, Big Trouble in Little China), then stop making those and release one-disc versions. Now, they do the opposite. They release one-disc versions and then months later release two-discs. Europe does not. Here in the UK, I Robot and Man on Fire were given two-disc treatments from the very beginning.Also, Miramax is releasing a barebones, no special features edition of SIN CITY in August, but they've already confirmed that a Special Edition is planned for Christmas '05. That's four months after the initial release.

625862,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JN0W,Joseph Haschka,"[13, 13]","American audiences love their Silver Screen heroes that wreak vengeance on the Bad Guys. In MAN ON FIRE, Denzel Washington makes Stallone's Rambo and Eastwood's Dirty Harry look like altar boys. I don't recall either of the latter two lopping off fingers.Washington is Creasy, who, haunted by his past as a counter-insurgency assassin employed by the U.S. government, drinks to excess and contemplates suicide. On a social call to a pal from the old days, Rayburn (Christopher Walken), Creasy rhetorically asks, &quot;Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?&quot; Rayburn, now living the good life in Juarez, Mexico, would like to see Creasy pull out of his self-destructive funk. So, he puts his friend in touch with Mexican businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), who lives with his American wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) and daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, where kidnapping offspring of the rich and famous is a growth industry. Samuel and Lisa are in the market for a new bodyguard for their daughter.Creasy, of course, takes the job. At first, he rebuffs the overtures of young Pita, who's an only child in need of a new friend. Slowly, though, he falls under her thrall. Indeed, Pita's innocence and youthful zest for life make Creasy want to live again. So, after she's ultimately kidnapped in a bloody street shootout (that leaves her protector gravely wounded) and ostensibly killed after a ransom attempt gone awry, Creasy vows apocalyptic revenge against all those involved in her abduction. And Rayburn, with his useful contacts, supplies enough firepower to single-handedly topple another Third World despot.MAN ON FIRE has been criticized because Washington, one of Hollywood's finest dramatic actors, supposedly deserves a better role than that of a formula action/special FX Neanderthal. The point seems to be missed that Denzel brings to Creasy's persona a depth of character, albeit an emotionally and psychologically tortured one, rarely seen in the lantern-jawed superheroes of screen legend. Indeed, Denzel's performance is eminently watchable, as is that of each of the major players in the production. Dakota Fanning, at age 10, is incorrigibly engaging as the kid who wins the Tough Guy's heart. Mitchell, whom I've not seen before, is completely convincing as the gorgeous Mom who holds her child dearer than anything. And how about that Christopher Walken, huh? Here, soon after THE RUNDOWN, we have another notable supporting performance.In my mind, the film falls short on two minor points. First, it wasn't clear what happened to Samuel's lawyer - poor scripting or bad editing, perhaps. Second, the casting director apparently bent over backwards to make the Ramos family appeal to WASP audiences. I mean, why not Salma Hayek and some adorable Latino girl instead of the Nordic blonde Lisa and the precocious Pita (who had all the Latino attributes of Shirley Temple in her Cute Phase)? And, as an aside, Mexico City desperately needs a PR makeover after MAN ON FIRE dwells on its police corruption and slums - I wouldn't now go there on a bet.MAN ON FIRE is a violent and gritty shoot-'em-up that transcends most of the genre because of Denzel presence.

625870,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JN0W,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 2]","With a story that appears to have been ripped directly from the headlines, director Tony Scott reteams with his ""Crimson Tide"" star, Denzel Washington, and delivers what is possibly one of the most suspenseful, well-written, well-directed and acted revenge tales ever committed to film.  In ""Man on Fire"", Tony Scott chose to shed some light on the terrible tragedy of kidnappings that occur almost daily in Mexico.  Even though I generally despise movie studios that re-release movies to DVD less than a year after the intial release, this All-Access edition of ""Man on Fire"" gives the movie the proper treatment it deserves.""Man on Fire"" is the story of a former C.I.A. agent, John Creasy (Denzel Washington), who takes on the role of bodyguard and mentor for the young daughter of a wealthy family in Mexico City.  However, when the young girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), is kidnapped for ransom, the kidnappers unwittingly bring about a firestorm of unbridled fury from inside Creasy.  Now, Creasy embarks on a quest to rescue Pita, and God be with anyone who gets in his way, because no one else will be.""Man on Fire"" accomplishes something many other revenge tales never even aspire to, that is actually delivering a story of substance, and not just violence.  The scenes between Denzel and Dakota are touching, and paint a brilliant portrait of the love Creasy is beginning to feel for this young girl, and how she is showing him that it is ok to live and feel again.  Once she's kidnapped the movie really kicks into overdrive and never lets up.  With outstanding performances from Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington, and terrific supporting actors like Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke, this movie is top-notch all the way.  Definitely not a movie to be missed!""Man on Fire"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,Creasy's Art is Death...He's About to Paint His Masterpiece...,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,1823,"['story', 'have', 'been', 'ripped', 'directly', 'headlines', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'star', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'delivers', 'what', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'well-written', 'well-directed', 'acted', 'revenge', 'tales', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'chose', 'shed', 'light', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'kidnappings', 'occur', 'almost', 'daily', 'Mexico', 'Even', 'generally', 'despise', 'movie', 'studios', 're-release', 'movies', 'DVD', 'less', 'year', 'intial', 'release', 'All-Access', 'edition', 'Man', 'Fire', 'movie', 'proper', 'treatment', 'Man', 'Fire', 'story', 'former', 'C.I.A', 'agent', 'John', 'Creasy', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'role', 'bodyguard', 'mentor', 'young', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Mexico', 'City', 'However', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'kidnapped', 'ransom', 'kidnappers', 'unwittingly', 'bring', 'about', 'firestorm', 'unbridled', 'fury', 'Creasy', 'Now', 'Creasy', 'quest', 'rescue', 'Pita', 'God', 'be', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'Man', 'Fire', 'something', 'many', 'other', 'revenge', 'tales', 'never', 'even', 'aspire', 'actually', 'delivering', 'story', 'substance', 'not', 'just', 'violence', 'scenes', 'Denzel', 'Dakota', 'are', 'touching', 'paint', 'brilliant', 'portrait', 'love', 'Creasy', 'beginning', 'feel', 'young', 'girl', 'how', 'showing', 'ok', 'live', 'feel', 'again', 'kidnapped', 'movie', 'really', 'overdrive', 'never', 'up', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'movie', 'top-notch', 'way', 'Definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'missed', 'Man', 'Fire', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

I just felt the Denzel Washington character was not fully developed.  He was conflicted and drank because he had difficulty in accepting the fact that he had failed in protecting some person in his past.  The reason why he started to have feelings for the child in this movie when it was only supposed to be an assignment was nice for the story, but it compromised the integrity of his character (cold, unfeeling which are traits you have to have for the job).  And it also contradicted the feel of the movie (don't give me warm and fuzzy in the same movie that you've got fingers being cut off in exchange for information).I understand the whole angle where he came to terms with his inner demons and had some sort of redemption with the way he's lived because he sacrificed his life for the little girl's life and all.I felt the cinematography was great and stylish, and Denzel is always fun to watch.  Dakota Fanning is a natural child actress and gave a moving performance.  It's just that I wasn't too taken by the story in general; nor by the premise of having one of the greatest bodyguards in the business who suddenly becomes a softie and cares about the person he's supposed to protect.  The fact that his character died at the end, that alone wasn't what soured me on the movie.  Even if Denzel's character had lived at the end of the movie - say, he foiled that entire kidnapping ring, returned the child to her Mom and said he had to go because having him around would put them in further jeopardy, so he left - having that kind of alternate end, I still would not have enjoyed the movie because of the overall premise - the bad guys get away with so much, yet so little is done back to them.  And because the girl's own father had something to do with the kidnapping and things didn't turn out the way he thought they would, he kills himself out of guilt.  Ooh-fah.Also the overall tone of the movie was very dark, which in itself is not a bad thing (loved ""Dark City"" & ""The Crow"").  But the point of the title of my review, as referenced in the movie, is that kidnappings are a very common occurrence in Mexico in real life, and those parents never see their children returned.  Sometimes I don't like to be reminded about the harsh reality of life in my movies because reality can, at times, be depressing.  If I want depressing, all I have to do is turn on the news.  I like for there to be some venue of entertainment where I can temporarily suspend my belief.  I don't consider watching something depressing as an enjoyable form of entertainment.  And if you're going to reference reality in a movie, would it kill you to throw in just a little bit of fantasy to make me feel good for at least a couple of hours?  It's a movie; it's a make-believe story, so you have the power to do that.For the acting, cinematography and couple of funny parts = 4 stars; the story itself = 2 stars.

It's all frenetic and annoying and totally distracted me from the story. It wasn't a bad story, so why all the silly useless garnish, Tony? Seriously. I haven't read many other reviews yet, but obviously that Dakota girl is the gem of the whole movie. Totally natural in front of the camera.

625874,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,B00005JN0W,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[47, 51]","This is a dark, clever and very surreal kind of movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I got the chance to see a preview of it at a UK movie theatre this week.It starts off as it means to go on, with the kidnapping of a teenage boy, his torture by his kidnappers, the payment of the ransom by his family and his release, a broken shell of the happy go lucky youth he used to be.It is after this introduction we meet Creasy, played to perfection by the actor Denzel Washington.  He is the tormented killer-come-bodyguard who is slowly drinking himself to death, a man who has forgotten how to live for as his friend Rayburn, the glorious Christopher Walken points out to a Police Officer, ""Creasy is a man who has made an art out of killing...""Dakota Fanning gives an excellent performance as Pita, the half Mexican, half American child who gets under Creasy's skin and into his heart and teaches him that it is okay to care and love another person.When Pita is kidnapped and then murdered (or so Creasy thinks), a rage is born inside of Creasy that will only be quenched by the total annihilation of all those involved in her abduction.With the help of a crusading reporter Mariana, the wonderful Rachel Ticotin and the cynical Manzano, a delicious Giancarlo Giannini, Creasy sets about enacting his vow and he does it in style!This is not violence for the sake of violence, and though there is plenty of blood and guts flying, what surprised me was how well it was done!  I am really quite squeamish and though there were a couple of times when I went, ""OH YUCK"" it certainly wasn't as bad I expected it to be and it fitted in TOTALLY with the plot.Mickey Rourke plays the charming but sleazy lawyer Jordan and I was most impressed by Radha Mitchell who played Lisa, Pitas' mother, she reminded me of Tea Leoni, but with more class whilst Marc Anthony gives a solid performance as Sammy, Pita's weak but loving father and last but not least, Angelina Pel&aacute;ez who only has a bit part as the nun Sister Anna but who is able to see in to Creasy's soul and know he is a fallen angel.""Man on Fire"" is not an easy film to get your head around, the plot is quite complex, the cinematography is utterly surreal in parts, flickering in an out as we are treated to images both real and imagined and in the background there is the ever menacing present of corrupt public officials and a man know only as the ""The voice"" who has kept Mexico in thrall with his constant murderous kidnappings for profit.The director Tony Scott has done a great job; I love this film with all its twists and turns, its many complex characters, the good but tormented soul, (Creasy), the innocent (the child Pita) the bad, (Fuentes a corrupt cop) the ugly (Manzano the good cop), the weak (Sammy Pita's father), the sleaze ball (Jordan the lawyer) the beautiful, (Mariana the crusading reporter), the tragic (Lisa, Pita's mother), the stupid, (Bruno the rather stupid Rave Master) and the downright evil (the Voice).The film score is also a crackingly good example of how you can put music in a film and make it part of the whole visual experience.In fact the music was SO good in my opinion I am breaking one of my rules, I'm buying the CD! I only do buy a soundtrack when I really LOVE the music; this is one of those rare occasions!The whole film is quality on celluloid, and all the actors/actresses are perfect to the parts.A film worthy of many Oscar nominations in my humble opinion but then quality has never been an Oscar trademark so I am not holding my breath in that department!",5,Enter the world of Creasy a man about to redeem his soul...,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,3568,"['dark', 'clever', 'very', 'surreal', 'kind', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'preview', 'UK', 'movie', 'theatre', 'week.It', 'off', 'go', 'kidnapping', 'teenage', 'boy', 'torture', 'kidnappers', 'payment', 'ransom', 'family', 'release', 'broken', 'shell', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'youth', 'used', 'be.It', 'introduction', 'meet', 'Creasy', 'played', 'perfection', 'actor', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'tormented', 'killer-come-bodyguard', 'who', 'slowly', 'drinking', 'death', 'man', 'who', 'forgotten', 'how', 'live', 'friend', 'Rayburn', 'glorious', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'out', 'Police', 'Officer', 'Creasy', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'art', 'killing', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Pita', 'half', 'Mexican', 'half', 'American', 'child', 'who', 'Creasy', 'skin', 'heart', 'okay', 'care', 'love', 'person.When', 'Pita', 'kidnapped', 'then', 'murdered', 'so', 'Creasy', 'thinks', 'rage', 'born', 'Creasy', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'quenched', 'total', 'annihilation', 'involved', 'abduction.With', 'help', 'crusading', 'reporter', 'Mariana', 'wonderful', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'cynical', 'Manzano', 'delicious', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Creasy', 'enacting', 'vow', 'style', 'not', 'violence', 'sake', 'violence', 'plenty', 'blood', 'guts', 'flying', 'what', 'surprised', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'done', 'am', 'really', 'quite', 'squeamish', 'were', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'went', 'OH', 'YUCK', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'expected', 'be', 'fitted', 'TOTALLY', 'plot.Mickey', 'Rourke', 'charming', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'Jordan', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Pitas', 'mother', 'reminded', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'more', 'class', 'whilst', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'solid', 'performance', 'Sammy', 'Pita', 'weak', 'loving', 'father', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Angelina', 'Pel', 'aacute', 'who', 'only', 'bit', 'part', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Anna', 'who', 'able', 'see', 'Creasy', 'soul', 'know', 'fallen', 'angel', 'Man', 'Fire', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'get', 'head', 'plot', 'quite', 'complex', 'cinematography', 'utterly', 'surreal', 'parts', 'flickering', 'out', 'are', 'treated', 'images', 'real', 'imagined', 'background', 'ever', 'menacing', 'present', 'corrupt', 'public', 'officials', 'man', 'only', 'voice', 'who', 'kept', 'Mexico', 'thrall', 'constant', 'murderous', 'kidnappings', 'profit.The', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'love', 'film', 'twists', 'turns', 'many', 'complex', 'characters', 'good', 'tormented', 'soul', 'Creasy', 'innocent', 'child', 'Pita', 'bad', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'ugly', 'Manzano', 'good', 'cop', 'weak', 'Sammy', 'Pita', 'father', 'sleaze', 'ball', 'Jordan', 'lawyer', 'beautiful', 'Mariana', 'crusading', 'reporter', 'tragic', 'Lisa', 'Pita', 'mother', 'stupid', 'Bruno', 'rather', 'stupid', 'Rave', 'Master', 'downright', 'evil', 'Voice', '.The', 'film', 'score', 'also', 'crackingly', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'can', 'put', 'music', 'film', 'make', 'part', 'whole', 'visual', 'experience.In', 'fact', 'music', 'was', 'SO', 'good', 'opinion', 'am', 'breaking', 'one', 'rules', ""'m"", 'buying', 'CD', 'only', 'do', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'when', 'really', 'LOVE', 'music', 'one', 'rare', 'occasions', 'whole', 'film', 'quality', 'celluloid', 'actors/actresses', 'are', 'perfect', 'parts.A', 'film', 'worthy', 'many', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'humble', 'opinion', 'then', 'quality', 'never', 'been', 'Oscar', 'trademark', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'department']",N/A

625878,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JN0W,Kaya Savas,"[5, 7]","STORY: Ex-Assassin John Creasy is looking for a place to start over.  His friend played by Christopher Walken helps him out by hooking him up as a body guard.  The film takes place in Mexico City where kidnaping has become a profession.  The first half of the movie is spent on the connection of the relationship between Creasy and Pita, a little girl.  I have to admit here that I thought this movie was gonna blow, but then I remembered that I was seeing a Scott film.  And even though Ridley and Tony differ in style they are very similar in some ways.  I wasn't expecting anything to analyze in this film, but there was plenty.  Once the kidnaping takes place and Pita is announced dead we see the once loving John Creasy take a transformation into what he was in his past.  Pita unlocked what was previously locked within him, and that was the John Creasy that isn't a ruthless killer.  As usual when you walk into a Tony Scott film you have some expectations, and they are all there.  His trademark ""stop and go"" (as I like to call it) camera shots that flitter in different shades of light and dark, and then Harry Gregson-Williams.  I tell you, Harry and Tony seem meant for each other.  Harry's music accompanies Tony's vision so perfectly, and you can see that similarly in Spy Game.  The only thing lacking here is the ""believability"".  For me I did see the connection that Creasy and Pita had but as I was watching I really didn't see how she was able to make that much of an impact on him that it caused him to kill everybody who took place in her death.  The ending for me was my favorite part, it connects to several other parts of the film, mostly lines said by Creasy, and I won't say anything else that may spoil It for you.  The movie also has some pretty graphic violence but it's done in a way where you don't see much and that allows for your mind to create the graphic image.  The movie is long but it needs to be that way, and for me it was not boring at all.  I never once detracted from the film and started criticizing the film in my head, I was with it all the way through.ACTING: The acting, along with Tony's directing are what makes the movie so powerful.  Denzel Washington played this role perfectly and I really couldn't see anybody else in the role.  Christopher Walken was fantastic as well and finally we get to see him back in a serious role rather than comedic like Joe Dirt, The Rundown, and the recent Envy.  Mickey Rourke plays his typecast role, but he does it good.  Even Marc Anthony (yes, the singer) is good as Pita's father, and let's not forget Dakota Fanning as Pita.  The little child actress did a phenomenal job in my opinion and her acting did not feel forced or rehearsed like most child actors, it was truly genuine.BOTTOM LINE: The overall structure of the plot lacks the emotional connection that's supposed to be there, but the superb acting seems to fill it in fictitiously rather than authentically that works out for the overall effect.  Tony Scott has a distinct style that differs tone wise from his brother but there are similarities.  Man on Fire while isn't a masterpiece, is an emotional evoking film that is both poignant and thrilling at the same time.  For some, that weak emotional connection may be the factor that kills the movie for you and will result in you not liking it, but if you put that aside and allow the well-crafted visuals of the movie to do their job then you'll find the experience well worthwhile.",4,A Brilliant Performance & A Suprisingly Good Film That Works,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,3488,"['STORY', 'Ex-Assassin', 'John', 'Creasy', 'looking', 'place', 'start', 'over', 'friend', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'out', 'hooking', 'up', 'body', 'guard', 'film', 'place', 'Mexico', 'City', 'where', 'kidnaping', 'become', 'profession', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'spent', 'connection', 'relationship', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'little', 'girl', 'have', 'admit', 'here', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'blow', 'then', 'remembered', 'was', 'seeing', 'Scott', 'film', 'even', 'Ridley', 'Tony', 'differ', 'style', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'ways', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'analyze', 'film', 'there', 'was', 'plenty', 'kidnaping', 'place', 'Pita', 'announced', 'dead', 'see', 'once', 'loving', 'John', 'Creasy', 'take', 'transformation', 'what', 'was', 'past', 'Pita', 'unlocked', 'what', 'was', 'previously', 'locked', 'was', 'John', 'Creasy', ""n't"", 'ruthless', 'killer', 'usual', 'when', 'walk', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'film', 'have', 'expectations', 'are', 'there', 'trademark', 'stop', 'go', 'like', 'call', 'camera', 'shots', 'flitter', 'different', 'shades', 'light', 'dark', 'then', 'Harry', 'Gregson-Williams', 'tell', 'Harry', 'Tony', 'seem', 'meant', 'other', 'Harry', 'music', 'Tony', 'vision', 'so', 'perfectly', 'can', 'see', 'similarly', 'Spy', 'Game', 'only', 'thing', 'lacking', 'here', 'believability', 'did', 'see', 'connection', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'had', 'was', 'watching', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'much', 'impact', 'caused', 'kill', 'everybody', 'who', 'took', 'place', 'death', 'ending', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'several', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'mostly', 'lines', 'said', 'Creasy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'may', 'spoil', 'movie', 'also', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'violence', 'done', 'way', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'mind', 'create', 'graphic', 'image', 'movie', 'long', 'be', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'boring', 'never', 'once', 'detracted', 'film', 'started', 'criticizing', 'film', 'head', 'was', 'way', 'through.ACTING', 'acting', 'Tony', 'directing', 'are', 'movie', 'so', 'powerful', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'played', 'role', 'perfectly', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'anybody', 'else', 'role', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'was', 'fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'back', 'serious', 'role', 'rather', 'comedic', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'Rundown', 'recent', 'Envy', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'typecast', 'role', 'good', 'Even', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'yes', 'singer', 'good', 'Pita', 'father', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Pita', 'little', 'child', 'actress', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'opinion', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'forced', 'rehearsed', 'most', 'child', 'actors', 'was', 'truly', 'genuine.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'overall', 'structure', 'plot', 'emotional', 'connection', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'superb', 'acting', 'fill', 'fictitiously', 'rather', 'authentically', 'out', 'overall', 'effect', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'distinct', 'style', 'tone', 'wise', 'brother', 'are', 'similarities', 'Man', 'Fire', 'while', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'emotional', 'evoking', 'film', 'poignant', 'thrilling', 'same', 'time', 'weak', 'emotional', 'connection', 'may', 'be', 'factor', 'movie', 'will', 'result', 'not', 'liking', 'put', 'aside', 'allow', 'well-crafted', 'visuals', 'movie', 'do', 'job', 'then', ""'ll"", 'find', 'experience', 'well', 'worthwhile']",N/A
625879,A2JRDHU1D0S0TE,B00005JN0W,Keith Thompson,"[7, 13]","A.J. Quinnell's  'Man on Fire' is one of my all-time favorite books.  The author takes you to interesting places you've never heard of and introduces you to fascinating characters that you  come to really care about.  The novel is emotionally engrossing, suspenseful, the plot unfolds in a logical, intriguing way, and most of all, it tells a STORY--something Tony Scott, the director of the movie, obviously considers of minor importance.  The first half of the movie, detailing the bonding of Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning's characters, is taken pretty much straight from the book, and the interplay between the two is clearly the highlight of the film.  But of course, Hollywood can't leave well enough alone and stick to the story.  No, Scott has to change everything in the second hour and the book's fascinating characters and intriguing plot twists becomes just a jumbled mish-mash of Denzel Washington walking around and killing people.  The Mexican police apparently have no APBs out for this 6'2"" black guy (leaking blood from the 4 bullet wounds he took just a few days before) as he walks openly through the streets in pursuit of his next target.  There are gun fights and explosions and kidnappings, but no cops ever bother to respond, and tracking down the next link to Mr. Big is always just a matter of making a phone-call to a local reporter who can get secret banking information etc. at the drop of a hat.  [...] The last hour of the movie is just a mindless blur  of confusing chases and senseless violence, which I suppose would be okay, if it wasn't for the fact that A.J. Quinnell had given Tony Scott a great STORY he could have told, but which was discarded in favor of this pointless crap.Anyway, if you enjoyed the first half of the movie and felt let down by the second, then I heartily recommend that you READ THE BOOK, and see what a great movie they might have made.",2,Read the book instead,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,1904,"['A.J', 'Quinnell', ""'Man"", 'Fire', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'books', 'author', 'interesting', 'places', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'introduces', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'come', 'really', 'care', 'novel', 'emotionally', 'engrossing', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'logical', 'intriguing', 'way', 'most', 'STORY', 'something', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'director', 'movie', 'obviously', 'considers', 'minor', 'importance', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'detailing', 'bonding', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'characters', 'taken', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'book', 'interplay', 'two', 'clearly', 'highlight', 'film', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'stick', 'story', 'No', 'Scott', 'change', 'everything', 'second', 'hour', 'book', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'twists', 'just', 'jumbled', 'mish-mash', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'walking', 'around', 'killing', 'people', 'Mexican', 'police', 'apparently', 'have', 'APBs', 'out', '6', '2', 'black', 'guy', 'leaking', 'blood', '4', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'took', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'before', 'openly', 'streets', 'pursuit', 'next', 'target', 'are', 'gun', 'fights', 'explosions', 'kidnappings', 'cops', 'ever', 'bother', 'respond', 'tracking', 'down', 'next', 'link', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'always', 'just', 'matter', 'making', 'phone-call', 'local', 'reporter', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'secret', 'banking', 'information', 'etc', 'drop', 'hat', '[', 'last', 'hour', 'movie', 'just', 'mindless', 'blur', 'confusing', 'chases', 'senseless', 'violence', 'suppose', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'A.J', 'Quinnell', 'had', 'given', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'great', 'STORY', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'was', 'discarded', 'favor', 'pointless', 'crap.Anyway', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'second', 'then', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'READ', 'BOOK', 'see', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'made']",N/A

These films have been of various quality, and in Man on Fire the audience can experience another journey down the Avenger Lane.  However, the director Tony Scott provides a new angle on the revenge theme through guilt and alcoholism as it will go full circle through the life of Creasy (Denzel Washington).  Denzel Washington gives a strong performance as he depicts the initial lost soul to the changed man who found life again in order to return to his former self, a ruthless killer.The burden of a man lies upon him in the light in which he sees himself, or at least that is how one could perceives Creasy, a former Special Forces operative.  Creasy is heavily burdened by himself as he reflects upon his past and the things he has done, which he tries to drown in the haze of alcoholic slumber and forgetfulness.  However, reality always returns to Creasy as he slowly resurfaces from the dark depths where he tries to hide his consciousness.  The answer to Creasy's painful memories is to once again fill his belly with Jack Daniels and let the alcohol perform magic on his awareness.  Creasy maintains this alcoholic haze as he travels by cab from United States to Mexico to visit his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), which may be a call for help.Rayburn is a caring person that lives like a king in Mexico, but it pains him to see Creasy in an internal misery.  In order to help Creasy Rayburn gets him a job as a bodyguard for girl in a rich family in Mexico City where there are at least four kidnappings per day.  Creasy's subject is a clever and perceptive young girl by the name Pita (Dakota Fanning), who immediately discovers that she likes him.  When Creasy begins to work there is at tension between him and Pita, as she wants to befriend him and he wants to only do his job.  This is the beginning for a long and detailed character development, which leads Creasy into again finding a purpose in life as he protects Pita.The day comes when someone tries to kidnap her, as most viewers probably can predict, and Creasy will seek his revenge upon those who are involved in the kidnapping.  Creasy becomes the avenging angel that slays those responsible for the kidnapping and it seems as if he seeks redemption from the pain that he is experiencing.  This leads the viewer into a long series of action packed sequences that contain some gruesome scenes as Creasy methodically seeks the guilty people.Scott applies quick jump-cuts to the film in a way which has been seen in film such as Infernal Affairs (2002) and City of God (2003).  The method of using the quick jump-cut induces stress, which elevates the suspense in the film.  The jump-cuts are fused together with grainy photography, which is suppose to provide an authentic experience, much like documentaries, which together provokes further tension between characters in the story.Man on Fire is a troubling story about vengeance where the audience will experience relief when justice has been served by Creasy.  Yet, vengeance functions as a doubled edged sword hurting Creasy as he returns to his former ways, which drove him into deep feelings of guilt and grave alcoholism to begin with.  This notion should be pondered as he systematically progresses through Mexico City's corrupt elements and assassinates those involved in the kidnapping.  There are some interesting scenes that support this idea when Denzel Washington swims in a pool between the killings, as if he was purging himself of what he has done.  However, it seems as if he could not get himself rid of the blood as the blood continues to return.",4,Resurrected Lost Soul Seeks Vengeance...,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,3721,"['have', 'been', 'several', 'revenge', 'films', 'made', 'past', 'such', 'Death', 'Wish', '1974', 'Kill', 'Bill', '2003', 'Punisher', '2004', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'various', 'quality', 'Man', 'Fire', 'audience', 'can', 'experience', 'journey', 'down', 'Avenger', 'Lane', 'However', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'new', 'angle', 'revenge', 'theme', 'guilt', 'alcoholism', 'will', 'go', 'full', 'circle', 'life', 'Creasy', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'strong', 'performance', 'initial', 'lost', 'soul', 'changed', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'life', 'again', 'order', 'return', 'former', 'self', 'ruthless', 'killer.The', 'burden', 'man', 'light', 'least', 'how', 'one', 'could', 'perceives', 'Creasy', 'former', 'Special', 'Forces', 'operative', 'Creasy', 'heavily', 'burdened', 'past', 'things', 'done', 'drown', 'haze', 'alcoholic', 'slumber', 'forgetfulness', 'However', 'reality', 'always', 'Creasy', 'slowly', 'dark', 'depths', 'where', 'hide', 'consciousness', 'answer', 'Creasy', 'painful', 'memories', 'once', 'again', 'fill', 'belly', 'Jack', 'Daniels', 'let', 'alcohol', 'perform', 'magic', 'awareness', 'Creasy', 'alcoholic', 'haze', 'cab', 'United', 'States', 'Mexico', 'visit', 'old', 'friend', 'Rayburn', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'may', 'be', 'call', 'help.Rayburn', 'caring', 'person', 'king', 'Mexico', 'see', 'Creasy', 'internal', 'misery', 'order', 'help', 'Creasy', 'Rayburn', 'job', 'bodyguard', 'girl', 'rich', 'family', 'Mexico', 'City', 'where', 'are', 'least', 'four', 'kidnappings', 'day', 'Creasy', 'subject', 'clever', 'perceptive', 'young', 'girl', 'name', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'immediately', 'When', 'Creasy', 'work', 'tension', 'Pita', 'befriend', 'only', 'do', 'job', 'beginning', 'long', 'detailed', 'character', 'development', 'Creasy', 'again', 'finding', 'purpose', 'life', 'Pita.The', 'day', 'when', 'someone', 'kidnap', 'most', 'viewers', 'probably', 'can', 'predict', 'Creasy', 'will', 'seek', 'revenge', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'kidnapping', 'Creasy', 'avenging', 'angel', 'responsible', 'kidnapping', 'redemption', 'pain', 'experiencing', 'viewer', 'long', 'series', 'action', 'packed', 'sequences', 'contain', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'Creasy', 'methodically', 'guilty', 'people.Scott', 'applies', 'quick', 'jump-cuts', 'film', 'way', 'been', 'seen', 'film', 'such', 'Infernal', 'Affairs', '2002', 'City', 'God', '2003', 'method', 'using', 'quick', 'jump-cut', 'induces', 'stress', 'suspense', 'film', 'jump-cuts', 'are', 'fused', 'together', 'grainy', 'photography', 'suppose', 'provide', 'authentic', 'experience', 'much', 'documentaries', 'together', 'further', 'tension', 'characters', 'story.Man', 'Fire', 'troubling', 'story', 'vengeance', 'where', 'audience', 'will', 'experience', 'relief', 'when', 'justice', 'been', 'served', 'Creasy', 'vengeance', 'functions', 'doubled', 'edged', 'sword', 'hurting', 'Creasy', 'former', 'ways', 'drove', 'deep', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'grave', 'alcoholism', 'begin', 'notion', 'should', 'be', 'pondered', 'systematically', 'Mexico', 'City', 'corrupt', 'elements', 'assassinates', 'involved', 'kidnapping', 'are', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'support', 'idea', 'when', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'pool', 'killings', 'was', 'purging', 'what', 'done', 'However', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'rid', 'blood', 'blood', 'return']",N/A

I also hate to admit but, I love Denzel Washington his performance in Training Day was so cool. Renting this I expected a mixture of drama meets thriller. Man On Fire failed to deliever.Watching it made me feel sick and it wasn't the bloody scenes it was the horrible shaky gronchy camera work which ruined the movie for me. From the first fifteen minutes into it I felt sick from the constant movement on the screen. Which also made the movie a little more confusing. The soundtrack also ruined it for me- sometimes I felt as though Denzel had to shout over it.The movie starts in Mexico city- there have been recent kidnappings of wealthy children leading many parents to panic. That is when Washington comes into play- he is a former CIA agent who is bored and needs something to do when, he is hired by Fanning's family to protect the little girl. Pita the little girl takes an instant liking to Creasy her new body-guard. Only Creasy sees her more as a job then, a friend. But, before Creasy knows it finds a certain liking to Pita. When, Pita is kidnapped and presumed dead Creasy makes his own agenda to go out and kill everyone involved. With bloody and horrific scenes that follow he gains more clues into the people involved.While many reviewers claim this movie moved them deeply- I can't understand why- Washington despite seeming to enjoy his time with Fanning on set really there wasn't any connection between the two and I found myself wondering why he went out and killed for her. While, the blood scenes are really graphic and look very real I really didn't feel it was worth it in the end that Fanning was still alive- if she had been killed maybe, I would have felt the need for such a violent and horrible revenge. Yes, the killing brought the clues for Creasy but, stilll I needed to feel like that killing was jusitified with a horrofic act- in fact, I was kind of disappointed Fanning was alive for it made Washington look like a nasty guy. While Fanning was needed to change Creasy- i would have believed the change was more geniune had I seen more scenes of the two together but,so it didn't feel like the change was drastic or geniune.All in all Washington is not on fire on this movie.

Creasy, a man who accepts a job as a bodyguard to a wealthy family. Denzel Washington plays the same character with the same name as the Scott Glenn character in the original. It also has the same plot as the original. But this remake looks better than the original. The movie runs at nearly 2 1/2 hours long, which is pretty long, but, it is still an excellent movie with style and charisma, thanks to Denzel. His performance is a possible Oscar nomination for Best Actor at next year's Oscars, he is excellent in this performance. Dakota Fanning, stars as Pita Ramos, the daughter of the wealthy family he protects. Her performance is as excellent as Denzel's is. Creasy, at first, resents life, but, then, something unexpected happens. Creasy and Pita strike up a friendship. Then she gets kidnapped and Creasy is shot, trying to protect her. Then the story revolves around him trying to find her, hence the title ""Man On Fire"". Christopher Walken, stars as Rayburn, Creasy's friend who helps him in his journey of getting Pita back. Tony Scott's directing is excellent and has made a well done movie. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by A.J. Quinnell, is excellent. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is excellent. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is excellent. The film editing by Christian Wagner is excellent.

625892,AB4MB7S796GNJ,B00005JN0W,Larkenfield,"[5, 5]","This is a high impact film that puts the viewer through the emotional torment of what a parent would inevitably go through if their child was unexpectedly wrenched from their lives for ransom. In this story the situation is so corrupt that even the child's family (I won't say how) is in on the kidnapping plot (gone terribly wrong), and the insidious corruption of certain factions of the police and gov't officials is accurately portrayed. For these reasons, I do not view the intention of this film as nothing but an entertaining ""thriller"" for the viewer to just chew the cud about whether ""the director should have done that,"" ""the camera angle should have been this, etc."" from the nice safe harbor of their living rooms and not give enough weight to the worthiness of the theme being tackled here and the reality of this emotional and financial nightmare going on in Mexico City and elsewhere - film in and film out...next!This movie makes one contemplate the virtues of heroism in the face of extreme odds, and goes into great painstaking detail about how things work on the dark side when a child is taken. The long nature of the film and the way everything is so deliberately built and drawn out is an accurate portrayal of how heavy time can be when one feels powerless and is forced to wait and wait and wait for clues and information about a loved one. Creasy's actions end up empowering those who remain in the end.Though I'm not one to advocate violence, here is a film where there is something satisfying to see the tables turned on the kidnappers, and Creasy was willing to put his life on the life to win back the life of the child he was hired to protect and grew to love. After all, how many films, good or bad, have dramatized the terrible kidnapping situation in Mexico City with people as committed to their role as Denzel Washington? And the film is entirely committed to bring the story back home to every parent and every child who luckily hasn't had to face this kind of an emotional wrench.Right or wrong, individual heroism does exist in life when society breaks down beyond a certain point and the matter becomes personal. Violent yes, but every one in the film experiences the consequences of his or her actions, including Creasy, who reclaims himself spiritually and emotionally by coming back to life through his love of this child. Consequences define justice, and there's plenty of it here according to each person's own virtues, or lack of same. This is another great movie dramatization of the eternal theme: that one person _can_ make a difference.

The character 'Joe Miller' in ""Philadelphia,"" the character 'Matt Lee Whitlock' in ""Out of Time,"" and the character 'John Creasy' in ""Man on Fire""  . . . what's their racial background?See, it's tricky to ask that question and it may appear insensitive and boorish. People look at you as though you just got caught opening a can of beer in the parking lot of a chrome shop and your name is Cooter or Bubba.But I submit to you that Denzel Washington, like myself a Fordham University man (regrettably the comparison ceases there) is so good at what he does that three lines into the script or 40 seconds after the movie begins you forget that he is an African American actor. You are mesmerized (again) by viewing the craft of one of the best actors of our time.Like other African American men and women, Ashe, Jeter, Winfrey, Powell, the skill at which they do and did their jobs becomes the only point of focus. And that's the way it should be. And if an actor can show it to us and speed the process, more power to him.The plot of ""Man on Fire"" is oft used and simple. Burned out service man, cowboy, boxer, assassin, Knight of the Round Table, Priest, is rescued by a little guy, girl, pet, his girlfriend's sister, and wants to return to a ""normal"" life. Well not necessarily normal but at least not self destructive with occasional suicidal thoughts.For John Creasy was the CIA and alcohol that started it all. Now his friend Christopher Walken is getting him perhaps the last job he can ever hope to hold, bodyguarding a 10 year old blond girl of wealthy parents. When their relationship develops he finds himself with little experience becoming a sort of surrogfate father, and his 'raison d'etre' is returned to him by the precocious Dakota Fanning.His job is to protect her; when he fails at that she is kidnapped and he begins a journey of retribution, punishing those that took from him the person who gave him the gift of wanting to live again.In that regard it's not an unordinary film. It's heavy handed in the violence department, and while that doesn't detract from Washington's consummate skills, it does point the movie towards ""pulpdom."" But Denzel Washington brings to the character of John Creasy a depth heretofore unseen in ""tortured, wounded, dark heroes.""

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","I do not understand why you would pay out big bucks to have Denzel Washington do your movie, give him a decent script, and then explore the postmodernist notion of hyper-reality with the way the film is shot and edited, but that is what director Tony Scott ends up doing with ""Man on Fire.""  We are talking bleaching out the film, jump cuts, smash cuts, shaky hand held shots, and pretty much every bag in the trick.  Take all those away and you would find one of Washington's better performances and you can still see it, but you have to get past the visual garbage.Washington plays Creasy, a former C.I.A. assassin who drinks because he cannot find forgiveness for his past sins.  He shows up in Mexico to see Rayburn (Christopher Walken), an old military buddy, who agrees with the idea that God will never forgive them for what they have done, and who gets him a gig as a bodyguard.  It seems that south of the border there is one kidnapping an hour by gangsters seeking to extort money.  We are given a graphic example of how the practice works at the start of the movie and told that 70% of kidnapped victims are killed.  Because he has a drinking problem Creasy is available at a cut rate, but his anti-terrorism experience makes him a good value.The body Creasy is guarding belongs to young Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his American bride Lisa (Radha Mitchell), which explains the little blonde girl with a Mexican name.  She is cute and smart (it is Dakota Fanning; what were you expecting?), and insists on forming a friendship with her bodyguard.  Creasy resists, primarily for the practical concerns of being better able to protect her if they are not chatting about everything under the sun while he is driving her to and from school or piano lessons.  But she wears him down and he clearly becomes a father figure her, using his Marine Corps experience to teach her how to get off to a good start in her swimming races and suggesting a way of getting out of future piano lessons.  Of course, she is kidnapped just as their bond is strongest, mainly because she refuses to leave her friend behind when he is being shot to pieces in a gunfight.The kidnappers make two mistakes.  The first and most obvious one is that they do not kill Creasy, because he vows to kill all of them.  The second is that the kidnappers never change the license plate on one of their cars.  Creasy and Pita see it tailing them earlier in the film and it appears again during the kidnapping.  My first thought was that they were stupid and did not understand how to be smart about such things.  But then I thought that maybe there was an element of arrogance to their actions.  After all, they have some of the judicial police in their pockets and to these thugs this is just another day at the office.  That is it was until they took Pita away from Creasy.Creasy displays a ruthless efficiency as he tracks down ""the Voice,"" the man who gave the ransom instructions over the phone and is behind Pita's kidnapping.  His interrogation technique will make you grateful for the excesses of stylistic editing but each one does get him closer and closer to his goal.  Creasy has a newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) and an honest police official (Giancarlo Giannini) providing help in connecting the dots and getting him closer to his target.  As Rayburn tells the cop: ""A man can be an artist in anything...Ceasey's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece. Stay out of his way.""  Unfortunately besides that burst of eloquence Rayburn tends to lay it on a bit thick, declaring Creasy will ""deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals"" and the grand overstatement ""Creasy's gonna make them wish they hadn't touched one hair on her head.""One thing I liked about ""Man on Fire"" was that when Creasy leaves the hospital to go track down the kidnappers he is still recovering from his wounds, which keep bleeding throughout the last act of the film.  I also liked that while the thought of Pita would stay his hand from killing one particular person, he was still able to ensure that person died as they deserved.  Those who are expecting this film to have a happy ending are going to have to rethink what a happy ending might be under the circumstances here.  Even with all of the bangs in this one the film is going to end with more of a whimper.  The idea of finding redemption through a blood bath mind seem strange, but Washington's powerful performance carries the logic of the film, even thought the director's bag of tricks often gets in the way.",4,Gangsters take Dakota away from Denzel and he gets mad,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,4617,"['do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'pay', 'out', 'big', 'bucks', 'have', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'do', 'movie', 'give', 'decent', 'script', 'then', 'explore', 'postmodernist', 'notion', 'hyper-reality', 'way', 'film', 'shot', 'edited', 'what', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'up', 'doing', 'Man', 'Fire', 'are', 'talking', 'bleaching', 'out', 'film', 'jump', 'cuts', 'smash', 'cuts', 'shaky', 'hand', 'held', 'shots', 'pretty', 'much', 'bag', 'trick', 'Take', 'away', 'would', 'find', 'one', 'Washington', 'better', 'performances', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'have', 'get', 'visual', 'garbage.Washington', 'plays', 'Creasy', 'former', 'C.I.A', 'assassin', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'forgiveness', 'past', 'sins', 'up', 'Mexico', 'see', 'Rayburn', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'old', 'military', 'buddy', 'who', 'idea', 'God', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'who', 'gig', 'bodyguard', 'south', 'border', 'one', 'kidnapping', 'hour', 'gangsters', 'seeking', 'extort', 'money', 'are', 'given', 'graphic', 'example', 'how', 'practice', 'start', 'movie', 'told', '70', '%', 'kidnapped', 'victims', 'are', 'killed', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Creasy', 'available', 'cut', 'rate', 'anti-terrorism', 'experience', 'good', 'value.The', 'body', 'Creasy', 'guarding', 'belongs', 'young', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'daughter', 'Samuel', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'American', 'bride', 'Lisa', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'little', 'blonde', 'girl', 'Mexican', 'name', 'cute', 'smart', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'insists', 'forming', 'friendship', 'bodyguard', 'Creasy', 'primarily', 'practical', 'concerns', 'being', 'better', 'able', 'protect', 'are', 'not', 'chatting', 'everything', 'sun', 'driving', 'school', 'piano', 'lessons', 'down', 'clearly', 'father', 'figure', 'using', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'experience', 'teach', 'how', 'get', 'off', 'good', 'start', 'swimming', 'races', 'suggesting', 'way', 'getting', 'future', 'piano', 'lessons', 'course', 'kidnapped', 'just', 'bond', 'strongest', 'mainly', 'leave', 'friend', 'when', 'being', 'shot', 'pieces', 'gunfight.The', 'kidnappers', 'make', 'two', 'mistakes', 'first', 'most', 'obvious', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'kill', 'Creasy', 'kill', 'second', 'kidnappers', 'never', 'change', 'license', 'plate', 'one', 'cars', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'see', 'tailing', 'earlier', 'film', 'again', 'kidnapping', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'were', 'stupid', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'be', 'smart', 'such', 'things', 'then', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'element', 'arrogance', 'actions', 'have', 'judicial', 'police', 'pockets', 'thugs', 'just', 'day', 'office', 'was', 'took', 'Pita', 'away', 'Creasy.Creasy', 'ruthless', 'efficiency', 'down', 'Voice', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'ransom', 'instructions', 'phone', 'Pita', 'kidnapping', 'interrogation', 'technique', 'will', 'make', 'grateful', 'excesses', 'stylistic', 'editing', 'one', 'get', 'closer', 'closer', 'goal', 'Creasy', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'honest', 'police', 'official', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'providing', 'help', 'connecting', 'dots', 'getting', 'closer', 'target', 'Rayburn', 'cop', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'artist', 'anything', 'Ceasey', 'art', 'death', 'paint', 'masterpiece', 'Stay', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'burst', 'eloquence', 'Rayburn', 'lay', 'bit', 'thick', 'declaring', 'Creasy', 'will', 'deliver', 'more', 'justice', 'weekend', 'ten', 'years', 'courts', 'tribunals', 'grand', 'overstatement', 'Creasy', 'gon', 'make', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'touched', 'one', 'hair', 'head', 'One', 'thing', 'liked', 'Man', 'Fire', 'was', 'when', 'Creasy', 'hospital', 'go', 'track', 'down', 'kidnappers', 'still', 'recovering', 'wounds', 'keep', 'bleeding', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'also', 'liked', 'thought', 'Pita', 'would', 'stay', 'hand', 'killing', 'one', 'particular', 'person', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'ensure', 'person', 'died', 'deserved', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'film', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'rethink', 'what', 'happy', 'ending', 'might', 'be', 'circumstances', 'here', 'Even', 'bangs', 'one', 'film', 'going', 'end', 'more', 'whimper', 'idea', 'finding', 'redemption', 'blood', 'bath', 'mind', 'seem', 'strange', 'Washington', 'powerful', 'performance', 'logic', 'film', 'even', 'thought', 'director', 'bag', 'tricks', 'often', 'way']",N/A

625898,A2O91YORQH16L5,B00005JN0W,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[3, 3]","MAN ON FIREStarring Denzel Washington, Dakota FlemingFor me, this was quite a violent & yet sensitive action-filled movie.First, the backdrop: A wave of kidnappings had swept through Mexico city, feeding a growing sense of fear & panic among its wealthier citizens. In one six-day period, there were twenty-four abductions, leading many to hire bodyguards for their children.Next, a former CIA Black Ops operative, John Creasy (played by Denzel Washington), with extensive work experience in counter-terrorism, now burnt out, disillusioned & almost drunk, was introduced to a rich industrialist in Mexico city. His job: act as bodyguard to a lovable 9-year-old girl, Pita Ramos (played by Dakota Fleming).Creasy, who had recently quit the business, was seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he had committed. So far, he had been looking for answers in a bottle & the Bible, & not doing all that well with either. Creasy was not interested in being a bodyguard, especially to a youngster, but for lack of something better to do, he accepted very reluctantly the assignment, following the recommendation from a good friend (played by Christopher Walken).In the first part of the movie, Creasy began his growing friendship with Pita, who slowly but surely, worked her way into his initially hardened heart. She changed the behaviour of the cold Creasy, making him alive & smile again, & he felt a great affection for her. He also felt a newly found sense of purpose in his life & even encouraged her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempted to deal with the demons of his own past.I love the part where she taught her how to deal with the starting gun shot during a swimming contest:Creasy: ""The gun shot holds no fear, say it.""Pita: ""The gun shot holds no fear.""Creasy: ""You welcome the sound. In fact it's the sound that sets you free. You are a prisoner on this block until that sound sets you free.""The second part of the movie covered the blatant kidnap attempt on the girl, in broad daylight, by a gang of gun-blazing thugs. Creasy was badly wounded. As he sworn in front of the girl's mother: ""I'm gonna kill 'em all. Anyone that was involved. Anybody who profited from it. Anybody who opens their eyes at me.""All hell started to break loose from then as Creasy embarked on his personal vendetta. This was covered in the third part of the movie, which was the most violent & gruesome part.With the help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter, Mariana (played by Rachel Ticotin), who was all out to expose ""La Hermanidad"" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for the girl's abduction, Creasy systematically tracked down all parties, directly as well as remotely connected to the incident, including some corrupt elements in the local police/security unit.He was merciless & ruthless as he tortured one by one all those bad guys he encountered in the criminal chain of command.As he confronted one bad guy, whose hands were wired to the steering wheel of a car, Creasy said: ""I am going to ask questions. If you don't answer fully & truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have to. I'm going to cut your fingers off. One by one, if I have to.""As he inserted a small plastic explosive into the anus of the one of the bad guys, who was spread-eagled on to the boot of a car:The bad guy pleaded: ""A last wish, please, please. Please."" Creasy said to him: ""Last wish? I wish you had more time.""To another bad guy, Creasy said: ""Okay, my friend. It's off to the next life for you. I guarantee you, you won't be lonely.""Creasy added: ""I got all the time in the world. You don't, but I do.""Finally, he managed to come close to the ringleader, known as ""The Voice"", after having intercepted the latter's rogue brother & sister-in-law in the ensuing pursuit:Creasy said, after pumping a bullet into the brother's hand, via his handphone: ""I'm gonna take your family apart, piece by piece, you understand me? Piece by piece.""With singled-minded rage, Creasy had transformed himself into the terrifying killing machine he was originally trained to be.For me, the fourth & final part of the movie was really poignant.Creasy decided that the only way for him to secure the final release of the girl, he had to be prepared to sacrifice himself. In other words, he would exchange his own life for the life of the girl, whom he had promised to protect at the beginning. Even though he had vowed to avenge the girl's abduction by killing all those who stood in his way, I reckon this final unselfish deed more or less exonerated him. This really makes this movie stands out from the rest of the ""revenge movies"" which seem to be the craze of the day.On the whole, this has been a very good movie to watch, even though some parts have been quite violent & gruesome. Nevertheless, it has also something worthwhile for all of us to learn.Both Denzel Washington & Dakota Fleming acted very well in the movie. Unfortunately, two other good actors, Christopher Walken (`The Deer Hunter', `Dogs of War', `Catch Me if You Can'), who played Creasy's good friend, & Mickey Rourke (`The Year of the Dragon', `Johnny Handsome', `Domino'), who played the conniving lawyer to the industrialist, had rather understated roles in the movie.",5,LESSONS FROM THE MOVIES: THE POWER OF PURPOSE & SELF SACRIFICE,1192665600,"10

That's until he meets his long-time friend in Mexico (sorry, cannot remember the name), played by Christopher Walken, who hooks him up with a job- playing the bodyguard who guards a 9-year-old girl named Pita (Dakato Fanning) from kidnappings, which is happening a lot in Mexico (according to Pita, 4 kidnappings happened in one day, 24 in a year to be approximate). At first, Creasy doesn't think much of the job but later comes to his mind and takes it. As he spends more time with the girl, he befriends Pita and soon teaches her a lot of things like the meaning of life and swimming. But things get out of place when a furious mob and corrupt cops ruins their relationship. In retaliation, Creasy vows to get revenge on the ones who kidnapped Pita because he thinks that they've killed her (it was Pita who showed Creasy the way of life, it was her who taught him to live again).The storyline is full of surprises and the picturing, itself, is twisting. You'll find most movies are predictable but that is one thing you will not find here. I was surprised to find a lot by this movie because it was unpredictable. Everything is everything here, I'd be brave enough to say that this is one of the best movies of 2004.Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors of all time, he always puts 100% into his work and that is what I liked about him.

Man on Fire is incredibly dark and violent, leading you into the underground world of organized kidnappings in Mexico City.Denzel Washington is John Creasey, an ex-operative who is now an admitted alcoholic.  He takes a job protecting a wealthy young couple's little girl named Pita (Fanning).  Pita breaks through Creasey's tough exterior and gives him a reason to live.  Now I know what you are thinking.  This sounds so Pollyanna-ish.  Lord help me, it is not.Pita is kidnapped.  The drop of the ransom money is compromised, as a third party, not related to the kidnappers, steals the ransom.  When the girl's mother begs the ""voice"" on the phone to spare Pita, he says it is too late.So begins Creasey's one-man war on the corrupt order of Mexican police know as El Hermandad (The Brotherhood).

These kidnappings have become culturally endemic, a source of enormous profit for clever criminals who have bribed the appropriate officials to extort money from terrified parents, with no real assurance that they will see their children alive after the ordeal.One family hires an ex-Black ops specialist, John Creasy, now a despondent alcoholic, to act as bodyguard for their daughter to qualify for the necessary insurance. From the start, it is abundantly clear that no one is to be trusted, not the police investigators, nor the insurance brokers. Creasy steps into a landmine without any idea of the challenges that await him.The hard-boiled, cynical Creasy has no illusions about himself, seeking temporary solace in a bottle, a few vague hours of peace in a life gone wrong. Yet the bodyguard (Denzel Washington), looking every bit the dissipated has-been, is slowly thawed by the irrepressible Pita (an endearing Dakota Fanning), gradually losing his fight against an emotional entanglement. When the girl is kidnapped, Creasy is gravely wounded, but determined to revenge the child's loss, although told she is dead.Then begins a brutal foray through the poverty-riddled barrios of Mexico in search of the culprits, anyone involved in Pita's kidnapping. Creasy is virtually unstoppable in his determination and takes advantage of the help of a newspaper reporter who wants to see the corrupt politicians destroyed. While the first half of Tony Scott's visually stunning Man on Fire is a set up for Creasy's unintentional attachment to Pita, the second half is action-packed and bloody, pulling no punches in a race against time. Grainy, jumpy sequences support the accelerating tension as Creasy moves closer to his target, a man so well-protected that he is known only as ""the voice"". The rough-cut cinematography intensifies the sinister brutality of a city that is morally compromised by opportunistic crime.Washington is intense and brooding, his single-mindedness contrasted against the chattering of enterprising families who struggle for space in a chaotic city, but there are equally strong supporting actors, Christopher Walken as an old Black-ops friend, now retired with a family and a distaste for murder and Mickey Rourke, in a small but believable bit as a corrupt broker. The real beauty of the film is the attachment between Creasy and Pita, the little girl who chips away at the frozen heart of a world-weary man on a downhill slide, his final chance at redemption. Like a wounded elephant, Creasy follows his instincts, utterly merciless in his quest for the head of the kidnapping ring. Honor wins out against senseless violence for one brief moment, before the city sinks back into the mire of corruption.

Dakota Fanning is a cute kid who has no difficulty delivering precocious lines as a child actor.  In movie after movie in her brief career she has played essentially the same role: the little blonde girl who is smarter than the average little blonde girl.  In ""Man on Fire"" the aspect that works most effectively is the mentor/protege relationship between Denzel and young Miss Fanning as Pita.Like the Sound of Music this film features a child who is all but neglected by her powerful father.  Someone is hired to be with the child - (now that I think about it, this movie shares that quality with another of Miss Fanning's recent features, Uptown Girls, doesn't it?) But rather than hiring Julie Andrews, a spirited singing Nun, Pita's parents need a bodyguard and hire Denzel's Creasy, a burned-out alcoholic ex-special forces killer.You don't know exactly what Creasy did in his previous life, but you know it haunts him.  Early in the film he is reunited with his old service buddy, Rayburn, played by Christopher Walken.""Do you think God will forgive us for the things we've done?"" he asks.""No"", says Rayburn.""Me either"", says Creasy succinctly.Creasy is initially all business with young Pita.  ""I was hired to be your bodyguard, not your friend"", he tells her when she tries to chat him up on the way to school.  But they form a believable bond and mutual respect over several weeks and some of the better scenes of the film are of Creasy acting as Pita's swimming coach.Then Pita is kidnapped in a scene that leaves Creasy with a couple of bullet wounds through his chest.  Creasy takes a bullet through the chest better than most people, though, and soon after he is striding through Mexico with a killer bravado that outdoes Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"".  There is even a scene where Walken's character persuades the Mexican authorities to let Creasy go after the bad guys that reminded me of a very similar one in Death Wish.  ""He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals,"" says Rayburn.  I wasn't expecting to suddenly find myself in a vigilante movie - and you, the prospective viewer, have to decide for yourself whether or not you'd enjoy such a thing.  Do you LIKE the idea of a well-armed civilian wading into the bad guys and blowing them away.... or do you prefer ""traditional"" justice, with cops and trials?If the story had partnered Creasy with the authorities in any kind of believable fashion I would have probably given a 4-star rating.

While there don't seem to be many decent African-American actors out there, Denzel Washington has proven to follow in the footsteps of other great actors such as Morgan Freeman, Samuel Jackson, James Earl Jones, Ossie Davis, Danny Glover, Lawrence Fisbourne, Terrence Howard and many others. Denzel has taken the role of John Creasy and made it his own.Not only does Denzel take on the role of John Creasy, a disillusioned ex-CIA Agent, but actually makes the character more three dimensional than the other cardboard characters that seem to appear in many of Hollywood's movies. Man of Fire is the consummate revenge movie. This movie also comes packaged in a 'back-to-back' Blu-ray packaging with Out of Time. Great bargain, if you can find it.While the movie is almost two and a half hours long, once the plot sets itself up, it jumps right into the action and doesn't fail to impress either. Some may have problems with the violent tendencies that John Creasy commits to. However, it shows the depths of what people will do to protect those they care about. This movie is about the kidnapping of Pita Ramos, whom he is hired to protect. However, after she's kidnapped, John Creasy discovers that the kidnappers may have killed her over a failed ransom attempt.He takes it upon himself to kill everyone involved with her kidnapping. Whether they were involved with her abduction, profited from it or 'looked at him,' he plans son exacting retribution against anyone and everyone involved with her abduction, no matter their level of participation. John Creasy is portrayed as a flawed character but as his relationship with Pita grew, that's when she gets abducted.

Samuel L. Jackson puts his life on the line for Gina Davis in ""Long Kiss Goodnight;"" Denzel saves Julia Roberts in ""The Pelican Brief"" and bails out Angelina Jolie in ""The Bone Collector."" Morgan Freeman constantly saves Ashley Judd in spate of flicks, and how can we forget classics like ""Lillies of the Field""? There are more, but here's the point: why are these brothers worthy of protecting her but never showing any romance? We know why.Now comes ""Man on Fire"" and the white female is but a tot. But she wins over this man who is supposed to be her body guard. He puts it all on the line for her when she is kidnapped and, in fact, gives his life for her.I don't want to divulge the plot but here is something to consider: people of color have to stick together. There are some of us who are lighter than others and some of us who look damn near white. But we know what's going on and we know who is who. And we also know that men of color are getting locked up, getting murdered by cops, or are increasingly finding out htey are gay. This skewed male-female reality is further exacerbated by movies such as these, which really send a clear message: spend your time and energy, and risk your life, defending the mate of the oppressor.That may be cool for some, perhaps many.

625916,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JN0W,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","""Man on Fire"" is an odd thriller. It seems to be appealing to two different audiences - kids seeking thrills and violence, and adults looking for intelligent entertainment, a la its director, Tony Scott's, ""Spy Game"" [2001]. In trying to play both ends against the middle, the movie fails to satisfy either audience. At nearly 2  hours long, it is too long and convoluted for kids. Beginning in the second half, there is violence so surreal and unexpected that it turns off most adults. Finally, the ending, which I anticipated early in the movie, is so gimmicky it tends to make BOTH audiences feel cheated.Denzel Washington, who plays Creasy, a has-been former CIA operative, leads a cast of consummate professionals. Down on his luck, alcoholic and suicidal, he finds himself in Mexico City. He meets an old buddy [Christopher Walken] who secures him a job as a bodyguard for the young daughter [Dakota Fanning] of a rich couple [Marc Anthony and Rhada Mitchell]. At first Creasy plays his usual, all business self, but soon the girl wins his heart. They bond in the movie's most moving scenes. When the girl is kidnapped, Casey is nearly killed trying to save her. While he is hospitalized, the kidnapping goes terribly wrong, and the kidnappers declare they have killed her. When he recovers, Creasy goes on a revenge rampage of Biblical proportions. It's not a pretty picture, and only an actor of Washington's abilities could sustain our empathy with the character.Supporting actors include such greats as Giancarlo Giannini and Rachel Ticotin. I can imagine all the actors on the set begging the director to tell them where their characters were going. How Scott responded, I will never know, but I also imagine the set as being rather chaotic.Adding to the chaos of ""Man on Fire"" was the decision to film most of it in a jarring, MTV-style mode. There is nothing in particular wrong with this editing technique, if used sparingly. If used over the course of 2 hours, though, it's the equivalent of writing a book using all caps.",3,Odd thriller targets two different audiences,1095552000,"09 19, 2004",2004,2037,"['Man', 'Fire', 'odd', 'thriller', 'be', 'appealing', 'two', 'different', 'audiences', 'kids', 'seeking', 'thrills', 'violence', 'adults', 'looking', 'intelligent', 'entertainment', 'la', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Spy', 'Game', '[', '2001', ']', 'trying', 'play', 'ends', 'middle', 'movie', 'satisfy', 'audience', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'too', 'long', 'convoluted', 'kids', 'Beginning', 'second', 'half', 'violence', 'so', 'surreal', 'unexpected', 'off', 'most', 'adults', 'Finally', 'ending', 'anticipated', 'early', 'movie', 'so', 'gimmicky', 'make', 'BOTH', 'audiences', 'feel', 'cheated.Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'Creasy', 'has-been', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'cast', 'consummate', 'professionals', 'Down', 'luck', 'alcoholic', 'suicidal', 'Mexico', 'City', 'old', 'buddy', '[', 'Christopher', 'Walken', ']', 'who', 'job', 'bodyguard', 'young', 'daughter', '[', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', ']', 'rich', 'couple', '[', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Rhada', 'Mitchell', ']', 'first', 'Creasy', 'usual', 'business', 'self', 'soon', 'girl', 'heart', 'bond', 'movie', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'When', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'Casey', 'nearly', 'killed', 'trying', 'save', 'hospitalized', 'kidnapping', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'kidnappers', 'declare', 'have', 'killed', 'When', 'Creasy', 'revenge', 'rampage', 'Biblical', 'proportions', 'not', 'pretty', 'picture', 'only', 'actor', 'Washington', 'abilities', 'could', 'sustain', 'empathy', 'character.Supporting', 'actors', 'include', 'such', 'greats', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'can', 'imagine', 'actors', 'set', 'begging', 'director', 'tell', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'going', 'How', 'Scott', 'responded', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'also', 'imagine', 'set', 'being', 'rather', 'chaotic.Adding', 'chaos', 'Man', 'Fire', 'was', 'decision', 'film', 'most', 'jarring', 'MTV-style', 'mode', 'nothing', 'particular', 'wrong', 'editing', 'technique', 'used', 'sparingly', 'used', 'course', '2', 'hours', 'though', 'equivalent', 'writing', 'book', 'using', 'caps']",N/A

No way, Pita is persistent and charming. Creasy's defenses melt and a warm relationship ensues.Creasy quits drinking.Pita conquers a swimming prize.A Kidnappers Team ends this happy association: Pita is abducted and Creasy left bleeding and loaded with lead.Without recovering from his wounds Creasy starts a wild revenge chase, picking one suspect after other with the help of a journalist.Until the bitter end, a blood full cavalcade ensues.When judged as an action film: it is a great movie.Starts a little morosely, but setting very clearly the scenery. After Pita's kidnapping action explodes ceaselessly. Nicely filmed, each photogram is framed with great care.When judged appreciating playacting: it is outstanding.Denzel Washington gives, once more, a very impressive impersonation. He is one of my all times favorite actor. He fleshes with equal success historical characters as Malcolm X (""Malcolm X"" 1992) or Steve Biko (""Cry Freedom"" 1987), investigators as Grantham (""The Pelican Brief"" 1993) or Hobbes (""Fallen"" 1998) as in the present role as Creasy.There are not enough words to describe Dakota Fanning's performance: enticing, self-possessed, very expressive and realistic. 10 point to the young lady!Christopher Walken as Rayburn, Radha Mitchell as the child's mother and Giancarlo Giannini as Manzano give the audience very good acting pieces.Special mention must be done for Rachel Ticotin as journalist Mariana, sober but full of stamina acting. She deserves to receive more important personages to flesh up. She is a very fine actress, still underestimated by producers and directors.When judged taking into account ethical values: here is where issue is in doubt.Is Creasy entitled to ruthlessly torture, mutilate and kill? Even if the ""Bad Guys"" are really bad and wicked as in this film, is it ok to apply such barbaric measures?IMO: no. He or anyone else is not entitled to do such things. There are always other means to obtain justice and give retribution to evil-doers.I consider this an intelligent film that may be enjoyed by action movies lovers.

Trapp,"[1, 2]","In the first half of ""Man on Fire"" the audience gets a brief glimpse of true redemption for Denzel Washington's character, who is haunted by unspecified acts of violence that he committed as an assassin. We see him, for example, reading his Bible and wondering if God could ever forgive him for what he has done. In the second half of the movie, that plotline is demolished as Washington's character abandons his struggle for the salvation of God and embraces his nature as a creature of violence, going on a brutal rampage of justice against equally brutal criminals who have harmed someone he loves. I at once admired the artistry of the film in its portrayal of a man fighting a great battle within himself and loathed the confused Hollywood morality. Director Scott portrays the cycle of violent vengeance as the same type of activity that caused the character to need redemption in the first place, but also portrays it as the only way that the little girl that he loves could be saved. At any rate, the portrayal of the eventual fate of Washington's character is perhaps the most potent ending I've seen in a movie this year.",4,A valiant attempt at being both beautiful and brutal ...,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,1131,"['first', 'half', 'Man', 'Fire', 'audience', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'true', 'redemption', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'character', 'who', 'haunted', 'unspecified', 'acts', 'violence', 'committed', 'assassin', 'see', 'example', 'reading', 'Bible', 'wondering', 'God', 'could', 'ever', 'forgive', 'what', 'done', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'plotline', 'demolished', 'Washington', 'character', 'struggle', 'salvation', 'God', 'nature', 'creature', 'violence', 'going', 'brutal', 'rampage', 'justice', 'equally', 'brutal', 'criminals', 'who', 'have', 'harmed', 'someone', 'once', 'admired', 'artistry', 'film', 'portrayal', 'man', 'fighting', 'great', 'battle', 'loathed', 'confused', 'Hollywood', 'morality', 'Director', 'Scott', 'cycle', 'violent', 'vengeance', 'same', 'type', 'activity', 'caused', 'character', 'need', 'redemption', 'first', 'place', 'also', 'only', 'way', 'little', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'saved', 'rate', 'portrayal', 'eventual', 'fate', 'Washington', 'character', 'perhaps', 'most', 'potent', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'year']",N/A

I thought I was in for a standard, well done, Hollywood action picture with a slightly shopworn premise. After about 30 minutes, I had high hopes for something more. By the closing credits I knew I had seen a great picture, many cuts about the average.The basic plot has a more-than-slightly burned out ex-agent (Washington) hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy businessman during a wave of child kidnappings in Mexico City. Despite the initial coldness of the agent, he develops an emotional attachment to his ""client."" This basic outline has more than a little moss on it (The Bodyguard, The Transporter, The Professional) and the results have been mixed at best. The nature of the story lends itself to the sort of generic sap that Hollywood producers settle for to please the widest audience possible. Man on Fire, for several reasons, seems almost like a new species of action film. There is an edge to it that I haven't seen in a mainstream film in a long time.Director Tony Scott has produced a dark, taut film that is almost skeletal in its hardness. The images come at a breakneck pace, and not one of them seems clich&eacute;d or standard. The scenes and shot selection seem almost random, until you realize that the overall effect has been one of great power. The director has chosen a somber tone, completely unromantic, and it fits the story beautifully.The writing is excellent throughout. No long speeches, no fluff, and everything sounds painfully true to life. I never had the feeling of any of the actors laboring with a line, or delivering a painful ""clinker,"" where it's clear a writer somewhere was patting themselves on the back for a line that is impossible to deliver without posing.The real triumph of the film, though, is the acting of Denzel Washington. This guy just gets better and better. How many films have you seen where the main character was supposed to be ""burned out"" but in fact looked, well, like a Hollywood actor - young, well fed, and at worst maybe a little artfully sullen? Think Tom Cruise trying to act like a world-weary ex-soldier in The Last Samurai. Well, Denzel Washington looked truly burnt, both physically and spiritually. He seemed really to be a slightly jittery, slightly ragged shell of a man. In short, he creates a character of great depth, and every move is believable. Importantly, when the movie turned to violence, his character was without the politically correct ""misgivings"" so many action film leads suffer with, and his attachment to his client was developed beautifully and completely believable.I bought this DVD the day after renting it and plan to watch it again when it is delivered.

The use of comic book graphics throughout the film, even when you knew what people were saying was another distracting element.  All this flash and artsy fartsy nonsense overshadows good performances from Denzel Washington as the assassin/bodyguard; Dakota Fanning, marvelously realistic in her role as Pita; Radha Mitchell as the child's tormented mother; and Christopher Walken's role as Washington's buddy.  Mark Anthony needs to stick to singing, and the almost unrecognizable Mickey Rourke's role was useless.The movie is graphic in its portrayal of violence, and also sadomasochistic.  Sure, these guys deserved what they got, but Denzel's relentless revenge is not satisfying to watch.  The ending...well, it was to be expected, but didn't serve this viewer.  It's all too long, as well; but if Scott had shown more restraint in his overblown direction, it may have moved faster.  Not a diamond in Washington's career, but it's not his fault.  Give Tony Scott some Zoloft or something, and maybe he'll become a director again instead of an MTV clone.",3,DARK ASHES,1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,1283,"['would', 'have', 'liked', 'MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'someone', 'else', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'flashy', 'cinematography', 'quick', 'jumps', 'only', 'served', 'derail', 'action', 'key', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'lost', 'cinematic', 'mayhem', 'use', 'comic', 'book', 'graphics', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'knew', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'saying', 'was', 'distracting', 'element', 'flash', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'nonsense', 'good', 'performances', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'assassin/bodyguard', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'marvelously', 'realistic', 'role', 'Pita', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'child', 'tormented', 'mother', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'role', 'Washington', 'buddy', 'Mark', 'Anthony', 'stick', 'singing', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'role', 'was', 'useless.The', 'movie', 'graphic', 'portrayal', 'violence', 'also', 'sadomasochistic', 'Sure', 'guys', 'deserved', 'what', 'got', 'Denzel', 'relentless', 'revenge', 'not', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'ending', 'well', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'did', ""n't"", 'serve', 'viewer', 'too', 'long', 'well', 'Scott', 'had', 'shown', 'more', 'restraint', 'overblown', 'direction', 'may', 'have', 'moved', 'faster', 'Not', 'diamond', 'Washington', 'career', 'not', 'fault', 'Give', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Zoloft', 'something', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'become', 'director', 'again', 'instead', 'MTV', 'clone']",N/A
625925,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JN0W,Michael Crane,"[219, 233]","""Man On Fire"" is an intense action thriller that takes you through hell and back.  This is not a ""happy"" movie, and it's not pretty.  It's extremely violent at times and the storyline is a reflection of a parent's worst nightmare--the kidnapping and possible murder of their child.  While it can be over-stylish at times with fancy editing and camera work, it proves to be a more than effective thriller.John Creasy used to work for the CIA, but now he's an alcoholic who doesn't think there's much to live for.  This is due to the terrible things he has done in his line of work (we never know exactly what he did, but there are more than enough hints).  Starting a new life in Mexico, his best friend finds him a job as a bodyguard to a nine-year-old girl since the family is worried about all of the kidnappings that have taken place in Mexico.  The girl, Pita, takes a liking to Creasy right away, but he doesn't allow her in and treats her as nothing more than a job.  Amazingly, he starts to get attached to Pita and finds a new reason to live.  Not only is he her bodyguard, but he is almost like a second father to her.Things drastically change when Pita gets kidnapped.  Creasy does his best to take out the kidnappers when it happens, but is outnumbered and has been shot multiple times.  While recovering in the hospital, he learns that the ransom for little Pita has gone sour and that her captors have most likely executed her.  This sets off a rage inside Creasy like he has never experienced before.  He checks himself out of the hospital and wages his own war against everybody who was involved in the kidnapping/murder of Pita.  And he vows to kill every single one of them.Tony Scott directs this intense and emotional thriller.  He does a great job with the material and he knows how to get the performances that he wants from his actors.  My complaint is that he goes a little overboard with the fancy camera work and editing at times, but that is something that can be overlooked.  Denzel Washington gives one of his most powerful performances since ""Training Day.""  He really makes you feel for his character, and his absolute hatred towards the people involved with the horrible kidnapping is done in an extremely realistic and convincing way.  Dakota Fanning does a great job in her role of ""Pita"" and does well by playing opposite of Denzel.  And, we cannot forget the great Christopher Walken who also does a superb job on his part.  He plays it perfectly and does not try to steal any scenes from Washington.It must be said, this is a vicious movie.  It's not for people with weak stomachs.  There is one scene in particular that makes the ear-cutting scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" look like absolutely nothing.  Denzel's  character doesn't only want to murder the bad guys... he wants to make them suffer in the most horrific ways, and he does that many times.  It's not a happy or cute movie.  It will disgust a lot of people, so it's not for everyone.  Make sure you keep that in mind if you decide to rent this.  Other than the option to watch the movie in DTS and two commentary tracks, the DVD has no special features.  It looks and sounds great.  It would've been nice if they did more with the DVD in the special features department, though.""Man On Fire"" is a powerful and unforgiving thrill ride that will keep your heart pumping and your forehead sweating.  Other than some of the flashy and fast editing/camera work, the movie really works.  Again, this is not for anybody with weak stomachs.  It is very disturbing and unsettling.  If you're looking for a powerful thriller with a lot of ""bang"" and real emotion, then this is something to check out.  As dark and brutal as this movie is, I really enjoyed watching this. -Michael Crane",4,"""Last wish?  I wish... you had... more time!""

625944,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00005JN0W,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 3]","Denzel Washington is a force to be reckoned with in Man on Fire, featuring some glossy and overly stylistic direction courtesy of director Tony Scott; something which hurts the film as well as propels it.  Washington plays a burned out assassin/secret agent type who takes a job being a bodyguard for the daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy couple (Radha Mitchell, Marc Anthony) in Mexico.  Soon enough, the two form a predictable bond which leads our hero to go on a bloody, revenge filled rampage when the girl is kidnapped and presumed dead.  Were it not for Washington's magnetic performance and the surprisingly realistic interplay between him and Fanning, Man on Fire would be a derivative mainstream revenge flick, but it works for the most part despite some mis-steps by Scott.  The visual style is different from anything Scott has done with his more recent projects, but the frequent unnecessary subtitles are more of a distraction than anything else.  Not to mention that the story is predictable, but despite this Man on Fire still manages to be satisfying.  Also featuring Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin, and Hannibal's Giancarlo Giannini; Man on Fire isn't the finest work you'll see from any of the party's involved, but you could do a lot worse.",3,Very stylistic and routine revenge trip,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1283,"['Denzel', 'Washington', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Man', 'Fire', 'featuring', 'glossy', 'overly', 'stylistic', 'direction', 'courtesy', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'something', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'propels', 'Washington', 'burned', 'out', 'assassin/secret', 'agent', 'type', 'who', 'job', 'being', 'bodyguard', 'daughter', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Mexico', 'Soon', 'enough', 'two', 'form', 'predictable', 'bond', 'hero', 'go', 'bloody', 'revenge', 'filled', 'rampage', 'when', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'presumed', 'dead', 'Were', 'not', 'Washington', 'magnetic', 'performance', 'surprisingly', 'realistic', 'interplay', 'Fanning', 'Man', 'Fire', 'would', 'be', 'derivative', 'mainstream', 'revenge', 'flick', 'most', 'part', 'mis-steps', 'Scott', 'visual', 'style', 'different', 'anything', 'Scott', 'done', 'more', 'recent', 'projects', 'frequent', 'unnecessary', 'subtitles', 'are', 'more', 'distraction', 'anything', 'else', 'Not', 'mention', 'story', 'predictable', 'Man', 'Fire', 'still', 'be', 'satisfying', 'Also', 'featuring', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'Hannibal', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Man', 'Fire', ""n't"", 'finest', 'work', ""'ll"", 'see', 'party', 'involved', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse']",N/A
625945,A2UM70SXX6TY30,B00005JN0W,"Ned K. Wynn ""EKW""","[9, 9]","Man On Fire is simply one of the best pure action/revenge movies I've ever seen. The familiar story where the hero, his life destroyed, decides to wreak Old Testament justice on the responsible parties is a mythical tale as old as Greek drama, a samurai fable brought up-to-date and which, in this case, seems peculiarly American even though it takes place in Mexico and the director is a Brit.Tony Scott is firing on all cylinders here, and to my mind this is his best movie to date. It ranks with Unforgiven for its sheer, unapologetic demand for retribution. It's writer, Brian Helgeland (Mystic River, A Knight's Tale, L.A. Confidential), also did the lean, cool, violent (and often funny) Payback with Mel Gibson. This film eschews humor for the most part except when we experience the lightness of the banter and play between Creasy and Pita. There is no fuzziness here, no lenient judgment, no forgiveness. The best of these kinds of films are stringent and deeply, mercilessly moral. Do me bad, I'll do you double bad. This is one of those films.Caution, SPOILERS: Once it is clear that the girl has been kidnapped and is probably dead, hand-wringing is astutely absent and dilemma is off the menu - at least in Creasy's case (and, eventually, in the mother's as well. She is played with intelligence and soul by the quietly gorgeous Rhada Mitchell).We know going in that something bad is going to happen, and it does. And we also know that the hero will not stop in his efforts to bring justice to the bad guys. And he doesn't. Washington and Fanning are the stars of this film, and they are both superb. This is some of Washington's best work, and the young girl is an astonishing, instinctive actress. Her actual maturity is almost freakish, but it never feels anything but natural in her work. Be sure and listen to her on the bonus disc.As to the film's look and feel, Scott and his DP, Paul Cameron (Collateral), pull out all the stops. The camera captures the moods and the moments with exquisite exactness. From Washington's character, Creasy - sitting in the dark, a defeated, weary drunk - to Fanning's  Pita, impossibly happy, utterly vulnerable, exposed in the bright sun and spotlight glare of the rippling, light-dancing swimming pool - to Creasy again, no longer the protector but the avenger now...through all these changes Cameron's palette, his choice of filters, of lighting and framing, change as well. He continuously puts us into a fundamental matrix of color and shadow which seizes us and pushes our emotions to the brink. We can't help but scrutinize every wrinkle in Washington's ragged face and start at the sudden flare of light exploding off of every dark-windowed car gliding quietly and menacingly through the claustrophobic streets of Mexico City.If you like a revenge flick that doesn't hold back on the revenge (as many films do), but that also contains time to build real people and to feel real emotions, where we see a man redeemed: once by a little girl's love and then again by blood, you can't help but like this movie.",4,Tony tops up,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,3067,"['Man', 'Fire', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'pure', 'action/revenge', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'familiar', 'story', 'where', 'hero', 'life', 'destroyed', 'decides', 'wreak', 'Old', 'Testament', 'justice', 'responsible', 'parties', 'mythical', 'tale', 'as', 'old', 'Greek', 'drama', 'samurai', 'fable', 'brought', 'up-to-date', 'case', 'peculiarly', 'American', 'even', 'place', 'Mexico', 'director', 'Brit.Tony', 'Scott', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'here', 'mind', 'best', 'movie', 'date', 'Unforgiven', 'sheer', 'unapologetic', 'demand', 'retribution', 'writer', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'Mystic', 'River', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'also', 'did', 'lean', 'cool', 'violent', 'often', 'funny', 'Payback', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'film', 'humor', 'most', 'part', 'when', 'experience', 'lightness', 'banter', 'play', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'fuzziness', 'here', 'lenient', 'judgment', 'forgiveness', 'best', 'kinds', 'films', 'are', 'stringent', 'deeply', 'mercilessly', 'moral', 'Do', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'do', 'double', 'bad', 'one', 'films.Caution', 'SPOILERS', 'clear', 'girl', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'probably', 'dead', 'hand-wringing', 'astutely', 'absent', 'dilemma', 'menu', 'least', 'Creasy', 'case', 'eventually', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'played', 'intelligence', 'soul', 'quietly', 'gorgeous', 'Rhada', 'Mitchell', '.We', 'know', 'going', 'something', 'bad', 'going', 'happen', 'also', 'know', 'hero', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'efforts', 'bring', 'justice', 'bad', 'guys', ""n't"", 'Washington', 'Fanning', 'are', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'superb', 'Washington', 'best', 'work', 'young', 'girl', 'astonishing', 'instinctive', 'actress', 'actual', 'maturity', 'almost', 'freakish', 'never', 'anything', 'natural', 'work', 'Be', 'sure', 'listen', 'bonus', 'disc.As', 'film', 'look', 'feel', 'Scott', 'DP', 'Paul', 'Cameron', 'Collateral', 'out', 'stops', 'camera', 'moods', 'moments', 'exquisite', 'exactness', 'Washington', 'character', 'Creasy', 'sitting', 'dark', 'defeated', 'weary', 'drunk', 'Fanning', 'Pita', 'impossibly', 'happy', 'utterly', 'vulnerable', 'exposed', 'bright', 'sun', 'spotlight', 'glare', 'rippling', 'light-dancing', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Creasy', 'again', 'no', 'longer', 'protector', 'avenger', 'now', 'changes', 'Cameron', 'palette', 'choice', 'filters', 'lighting', 'framing', 'change', 'as', 'well', 'continuously', 'fundamental', 'matrix', 'color', 'shadow', 'pushes', 'emotions', 'brink', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'scrutinize', 'wrinkle', 'Washington', 'ragged', 'face', 'start', 'sudden', 'flare', 'light', 'exploding', 'dark-windowed', 'car', 'gliding', 'quietly', 'menacingly', 'claustrophobic', 'streets', 'Mexico', 'City.If', 'revenge', 'flick', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'revenge', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'also', 'time', 'build', 'real', 'people', 'feel', 'real', 'emotions', 'where', 'see', 'man', 'redeemed', 'once', 'little', 'girl', 'love', 'then', 'again', 'blood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie']",N/A

The daughter (Pita) played by Dakota Fanning [who is going to be one of the greatest actresses the world has ever seen] gives the performance of her life. Unbelievably believeable!!! Enter a host of other actors : Marc Anthony, Mickey Rourke (looking good) and Christopher Walken (always eerie and dependable - one of those actors you don't know if you like, but can't stop watching).The story is that of the relationship that bonds Creasy and Pita and how a man who has done so much killing ; finds redemption in protecting the innocent child. The bond almost becomes that of father and daughter because Pita's father is never around. Even the nickname she gives him, ""Creasy Bear"" indicates her love and dependability on him.Of course, she is kidnapped and Creasy left for dead and when Creasy finds out ""she's dead"" he wages WAR on all involved.In a Scene Washinghton asks Walken : ""Do you think God'll forgive us for what we've done?"" and Walken replies, ""No!""Once the revenge starts and all hell breaks loose, the answer is understood. The violence is excessive and gratuitous but essential in this tale...Creasy stops at nothing in order to bring the guilty to justice and he has absoluetly no remorse whatsoever... ""Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.""The movie has some awesome dialogue and quotes that are going to be remembered for years to come.Pita's mother asks Creasy : ""What are you going to do?"" And he replies :  ""What I do best. I'm gonna kill 'em. Anyone that was involved. Anybody who profited from it. Anybody who opens their eyes at me.""At over 2 hours, the movie takes us on an incredible journey... with a few surprises and an ending that will have you in tears. But at the end of the film, Walken's statement about Creasy is proven 100% true : ""He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals!"" and we know it... we've just watched him do it.THIS IS THE BEST ACTION/THRILLER OF 2004 and a MUST SEE / MUST OWN!!!",5,STUNNING VISUAL MASTERPIECE - AWESOME MOVIE!!!,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2419,"['TV', 'SPOT', 'movie', 'was', 'what', 'had', 'waiting', 'official', 'release', 'course', 'fact', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'were', 'driving', 'force', 'it.Incredibly', 'gut-wrenching', 'dark', 'frenetic', 'film', 'story', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Creasy', 'who', 'horrific', 'past', 'trying', 'move', 'away', 'body-guard', 'daughter', 'business', 'man', 'Mexico', 'City', 'daughter', 'Pita', 'played', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', '[', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', ']', 'performance', 'life', 'Unbelievably', 'believeable', 'Enter', 'host', 'other', 'actors', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'looking', 'good', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'always', 'eerie', 'dependable', 'one', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', '.The', 'story', 'relationship', 'bonds', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'killing', 'redemption', 'protecting', 'innocent', 'child', 'bond', 'almost', 'father', 'daughter', 'Pita', 'father', 'never', 'around', 'Even', 'nickname', 'Creasy', 'Bear', 'love', 'dependability', 'him.Of', 'course', 'kidnapped', 'Creasy', 'left', 'dead', 'when', 'Creasy', 'out', 'dead', 'WAR', 'involved.In', 'Scene', 'Washinghton', 'Walken', 'Do', 'think', 'God', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Walken', 'replies', 'No', 'revenge', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'answer', 'understood', 'violence', 'excessive', 'gratuitous', 'essential', 'tale', 'Creasy', 'nothing', 'order', 'bring', 'guilty', 'justice', 'absoluetly', 'remorse', 'whatsoever', 'Forgiveness', 'God', 'job', 'arrange', 'meeting', 'movie', 'awesome', 'dialogue', 'quotes', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'remembered', 'years', 'come.Pita', 'mother', 'Creasy', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'What', 'do', 'best', ""'m"", 'gon', 'kill', 'Anyone', 'was', 'involved', 'Anybody', 'who', 'profited', 'Anybody', 'who', 'eyes', '2', 'hours', 'movie', 'incredible', 'journey', 'few', 'surprises', 'ending', 'will', 'have', 'tears', 'end', 'film', 'Walken', 'statement', 'Creasy', 'proven', '100', '%', 'true', ""'ll"", 'deliver', 'more', 'justice', 'weekend', 'ten', 'years', 'courts', 'tribunals', 'know', ""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'do', 'it.THIS', 'BEST', 'ACTION/THRILLER', '2004', 'MUST', 'SEE', '/', 'MUST', 'OWN']",N/A
625949,A3UH3X6PZ7WCWG,B00005JN0W,"Nicholas Rog ""Zombie Fearer""","[1, 3]","""MAn on Fire"" stars Denzel Washington as 'Cresey' an ex-assasin for the United States Military, who now has a drinking problem and pretty much regrets his entire life work.  He meets up with his old co-worker played by Christopher Walken and is given a job as a body-guard for young Lupita Ramos(Dakota Fanning).  The Ramos family is a very wealthy one and with the kidnapping rate in Mexico CIty being as high as it is, a bodyguard is necessary for the Ramos family in order to get life insurance(I wonder if that is legitimate).Anyway, as cliche as a film plot can get, Cresey, normally an unsocial man, starts to create a strong bond with young Lupita or 'Pita' as she is called during the film and nearly dies, trying to prevent the kidnapping of her. A kidnapping the viewer knows is going to happen from the moment the movie starts.While Cresey is nursing his wounds in the hospital, the Ramos family puts up the ransom money($10 million) and attempts to get their daughter back.  Things go wrong, people are killed during the exchange and the ransom money is stolen by some 3rd party.  Lupita is killed.  Cresey hears of this and vows to the Ramos family that he ""will do what I(he) does best.  Kill them all, all involved, all who profited and all who open their eyes at me.""The next hour and a half of the movie are about his tracking down and killing of all involved.This movie is pretty entertaining, but so predicatable!  There are twists and turns along the way, but nothing that I was surprised with and nothing I think any of the viewers will be surprised with.  Denzel gives his usual excellent performance, but there is nothing new or different about this role than the last 10 or so he has played.Christopher Walken has a smaller role in the film and, as usual, dominates the screen when shown.Dakota Fanning is surprisingly really good n this role.  She speaks SPanish in some scenes and is very believable as a young rich girl, whose parents are not as close to her as they should be, naturally leaving her to want to form a bond with her bodyguard.Good movie, worth a watch, not a buy.  Not suitable for younger children or the squemish, as this movie gets very bloody and violent in the second half.Enjoy!",3,"""Killing is his art.

Marc Anthony first acting gig wasn't too bad either.  Truth be told, I expected less from him and I'm always thrilled when I'm proven wrong.  Christopher Watkins looks like he just showed up for an easy check and Micky Rouke seemed reduced to wallpaper.But it's all about the story, right?

It's rather pointless elaborating on Man on Fire's strengths given how fatally the film is debilitated by Tony Scott's empty post-MTV visual sensibilities, his camera stuttering and jerking its way through distracting fast cuts on its way to telling a conventional revenge story that could ultimately probably have been better served by a less pretentious journeyman director (where were you Andrew Davis?). Scott's of course already demonstrated his uniquely incompetent knack for being unable to tell a story sensibly (in the De Niro / Snipes suspenser The Fan - in which he discovered the apparently novel technique of flashily cutting to something distracting whenever things threatened to become suspenseful!) If anything, the evidence here indicates he is even further beyond the control of anyone able to restrain him from his own egoistic creative excesses. And, not being a Polanski or a Coppola, his misjudgements don't even rise to the level of the interesting or ambitious. Instead, like Cherry Coke, the consumption experience - and the creative impulse driving it - is distasteful and crass (not much unlike, interestingly enough, the equally-stylised emptiness of brother Ridley's vacuous fascist jerk-off, Black Hawk Down).

Too innocent to understand the depths of his troubled soul, she is nevertheless sharp enough to see that Creasy is sad.  Perhaps his life as a mercenary has led him down a road toward apathetic self-destruction.  Probably, his previous (dubious) achievements left him feeling a deep emptiness within himself.  He keeps a Bible with him, and can quote scripture.  He is haunted by the question if he can ever pay for ""the things that he's done"" If ever a man required redemption, it is Creasy, and as if God provides an outlet, it seems to come in the form of his role as a bodyguard for Dakota Fanning.  Fanning, taken for granted by her parents, latches onto Creasy.  Her bright, loving spirit re-ignites Creasy -- to much more than a glimmer of his former self.  When Fanning is kidnapped, Creasy becomes an atomic reactor.  With a no-holds-barred approach toward finding the girl, Creasy morphs into an unstoppable force, a juggernaut who doesn't dilly dally with such trifles as working within the confines of the law or moral compunction.  Even Interpol sits back, flummoxed at Creasy's progress.  The violence is there, but not nauseatingly graphic or gratuitous or ""cool"" (think of ""Reservoir Dogs).  This will only appeal to an audience that enjoys gritty action motion pictures.  The first 15 minutes of the film feel slow, but are necessary for character development.

In Mexico City, former CIA assassin John Creasy (Washington) is hired by a wealthy Mexican businessman (Marc Anthony) to protect his daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). As Creasy forms a close friendship with the child, she helps him recover some of his humanity. When Pita is kidnapped and her ransom attempt goes wrong, Creasy resorts to brutal methods to punish those responsible for the kidnapping. ""Man on Fire"" is a gripping thriller from director Tony Scott (Crimson Tide & Enemy of the State). Despite the film's lengthy running time, the storyline holds out well and features some good twists. There are some pretty good action sequences and intense scenes of Washington's character torturing criminals to uncover the truth behind the kidnapping. Denzel Washington's top-notch performance is the film's biggest highlight. ""Man on Fire"" also stars Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken.Like many previous Blu-Ray releases from Twentieth Century Fox, ""Man on Fire"" falls short. The 2004 thriller is presented in a fine 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Despite the presence of grain in some scenes, the video transfer offers rich natural colors, great detail and notable resolution. The DTS-HD audio is dynamic with some good surround effects. Unfortunately, the only extras in this Blu-Ray are the theatrical trailers for ""Man on Fire"" and other Twentieth Century Fox releases. If you're looking for special features, the 2-disc Collector Edition DVD is a better choice.

625970,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JN0W,RMurray847,"[1, 5]","I have to admit right here that I found the movie annoying.  There is much to admire, particularly a stellar cast all doing a great job.  I also have a strong stomach (and love stuff like RESERVOIR DOGS, KILL BILL, etc. etc. in which the bad guys are dispatched in ""creative"" ways) and appreciation for well done violence.But there were too many things that bothered me...Director Tony Scott's directing style for starters.  If you haven't seen it, I can't really explain the jitteriness of it.  Most of the scenes have tricky editing, in which the picture jumps around or changes colors, or little snippets of things we've seen in the past are thrown in.  I think it's all supposed to make us feel on edge.  It works in bits and pieces, but the WHOLE DARN MOVIE!!!  Please!  The editor, director and cinematographer were having a bit too much fun for their own good.  You shouldn't be aware CONSTANTLY that you're watching a filmed image that is being heavily manipulated.  I felt constantly pulled away from my efforts to ""suspend disbelief.""  A movie like TRAFFIC, for example, played around with film stock and was a bit ""tricky"" in the same way.  But it actually helped us keep track of the myriad story lines, and at least the camera stayed still!And despite this gloss of ""artistry,"" the movie is really nothing more than a simple revenge flick...which I have NO problem with by the way.  But there are bits of dialogue that try to have great import to them...and there's a recurring bit with a bullet that doesn't fire when expected that's simply too FRAUGHT WITH MEANING to be anything but vaguely laughable.  If only the people behind the scenes could have realized that with a cast like they had to work with...they didn't need to work so hard.As you probably know, the film deals with the ""damaged"" bodyguard/former assassin Denzel Washington, and his relationship with his young charge, played by Dakota Fanning.  She helps make him feel alive again (in some scenes this is done VERY effectively...others are just cloying).  But when misfortune strikes, and Washington lets her down in a major way, he goes on a rampage of revenge that makes his character in TRAINING DAY look like a boy scout.  He not only is merciless, he seems to revel in coming up with creative ways to kill off everyone involved in the plot.  That's all well and good, and is the real reason to see the film.Washington is very good.  His naturally clipped manner works well, and when he dons his sunglasses, he exudes NO friendliness whatsoever.  Dakota Fanning is, of course, a fine young performer and is very good here.  Rhadha Mitchell plays her mother very well.  Marc Anthony is the dad (I won't discuss what happens to him, except to complain that the events Mom sets into motion might be frowned upon by little Dakota later!).  Christopher Walken plays an old friend of Washington's...and low and behold, he can still play a ""normal"" guy.  No quirks, no vacant stare. He's engaged in his role and feels like a real person.  Not that I don't LOVE his quirky characters, but it's good to remember that he is a skilled actor.  Mickey Rourke has a small role that suits him well.I just couldn't warm up to the film.  It's a bit too long for starters...the plot doesn't really required 2 hours and 15 minutes.  The ending lacks the emotional kick I'm sure it thought it had.  And again, there's the annoying filming style.

He travels to Mexico City where he hooks up with his long time friend and fellow agent, Rayburn (Christopher Walken).  Rayburn fixes him up with a job as body guard for a 9 year old girl, Pita Ramos (Dakota Fanning).  He knows It's going to be a tough job as there are many many kidnappings for ransom in Mexico.  For some criminals, it's a ""profession"".Pita likes Creasy so much, she names her teddy bear, ""Creasy bear"" but Creasy resists her friendliness.  But at last, she wins him over and he teaches her how to win at competitive swim meets.In a fierce gun battle, Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is severely wounded trying to save her.  The actual perpetrators are those she trusts, her father, Samuel (Marc Anthony) his lawyer, and high up members of the Mexican police.  The brotherhood, ""La Hermanidad""  takes Pita to a secret place.  The ransom exchange goes sour and Creasy believes she has been killed because the extortion attempt could not be completed.The now recovering Creasy vows revenge on those involved.  He tells Pita's mother, Lisa (Radha Mitchell) he is going to get those responsible.  Creasy then arms himself like a one man army and with unmatched brutality, he finds and kills, with the help of Mariana (Rachel Ticotin) all those involved in the crime.  When questioned about what Creasy is about to do, Rayburn states that Creasy is an ""Artist"".  His art is death, and he is about to paint his ""masterpiece"".This is a very powerful yet sensitive film.  All the acting and actors are excellent.  The extreme brutality seems justified considering what Creasy is up against.  These are not choir boys he's after.  The film portrays the realities of life in Mexico city, as many kidnappings do occur.  The movie is long at 146 minutes, but fast paced with no boring or uninteresting spots.

Zwick,"[1, 1]","***1/2You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys!Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, ""Man on Fire"" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed.  So far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either.  As the movie opens, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community.  Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety.  The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge, Pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections.  The last two-thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama, as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, ""Man on Fire,"" astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter.  It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people.  These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative.  Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie.  Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually.  In addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini.  But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.""Man on Fire"" would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller.",3,flawed but gripping thriller,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2744,"['***1/2You', 'know', ""'re"", 'something', 'different', 'when', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'playing', 'part', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', ""n't"", 'even', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'could', 'do', 'judicious', 'trimming', 'here', 'there', 'Man', 'Fire', 'generally', 'effective', 'crime', 'drama', 'tone', 'openly', 'sentimental', 'downright', 'brutal', 'just', 'tone', 'imaginable', 'between.Denzel', 'Washington', 'Creasy', 'former', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'who', 'recently', 'quit', 'business', 'seeking', 'sort', 'redemption', 'sins', 'committed', 'So', 'far', 'been', 'looking', 'answers', 'bottle', 'Bible', 'not', 'doing', 'well', 'movie', 'Mexico', 'City', 'been', 'ravaged', 'series', 'kidnappings', 'aimed', 'powerful', 'well-to-do', 'possibly', 'perpetrated', 'very', 'police', 'force', 'assigned', 'keep', 'law', 'order', 'community', 'Creasy', 'position', 'bodyguard', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'business', 'owner', 'who', 'rightly', 'safety', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'devoted', 'growing', 'friendship', 'Creasy', 'charge', 'Pita', 'sweet', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'slowly', 'surely', 'way', 'Creasy', 'initially', 'hardened', 'heart', 'affections', 'last', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'Avenging', 'Angel', 'melodrama', 'Creasy', 'systematically', 'out', 'responsible', 'tragedy', 'early', 'story.Based', 'novel', 'A.J', 'Quinnell', 'Man', 'Fire', 'astutely', 'written', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'flashily', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'coolly', 'efficient', 'action', 'picture', 'never', 'away', 'raw', 'brutality', 'subject', 'matter', 'risk', 'asking', 'identify', 'man', 'who', 'intents', 'purposes', 'achieving', 'redemption', 'torturing', 'murdering', 'admittedly', 'disreputable', 'people', 'scenes', 'carnage', 'violence', 'are', 'intense', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'do', 'times', 'border', 'exploitative', 'Even', 'better', 'are', 'quiet', 'intimate', 'moments', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'early', 'parts', 'movie', 'Washington', 'wonderful', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'establish', 'natural', 'easygoing', 'rapport', 'set', 'stage', 'chaos', 'turmoil', 'follow.Washington', 'movie', 'quality', 'stoic', 'righteousness', 'making', 'understand', 'character', 'emotional', 'level', 'even', 'what', 'doing', 'eludes', 'intellectually', 'addition', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'solid', 'performances', 'Walken', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Washington', 'delightful', 'Ms.', 'Fanning', 'who', 'steal', 'show', 'Man', 'Fire', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'half', 'hour', 'taken', 'out', 'running', 'time', 'still', 'better-than-average', 'crime', 'thriller']",N/A

Not that I wouldn't or shouldn't expect that level of performance from Washington, but that this was a good role for him, and he performs well.  This certainly would not have been a role for  Sylvester Stallone or Vin Diesel! In Man on Fire, a related series of kidnappings in Mexico City leads everybody who can afford it to hire a bodyguard.  Washington plays John Creasy, a bodyguard to nine-year old Pita Ramos.  As you might expect, Pita is kidnapped, and there is the movie.The cinematography is excellent, the directing intentionally choppy at times for (great) effect, and the plot makes sense, from the quid pro quo relationship of the top cop with the top reporter to how Creasy is so comfortable about weapons.My two complaints?

I stumbled upon this masterpiece while in serious need of having my faith in the magic of Hollywood replenished. After being dissapointed by many of Hollywood's latest titles sporting unrealistic situations and unbelievable special effects I was more than satisfied with this marvelous jewel of a film. I could tell you that the film is intended for mature audiences but that's what ratings are for. I could tell you that this film is graphically violent but it is an essential ingredient of the gripping storyline and marvelous story-telling.The film is not only made spectacular by magnificent performances by some of Hollywood's elite but the captivating editing techniques used manage to get right down to the nitty-gritty of a good revenge flick. The originality of subtitling techniques allows one to feel more in touch with a language spoken during the film that one might not understand. A brillinat soundtrack gives one an emotional attachment to the situations and the environment the story is set in. I was deeply moved by this film and I would highly recommend it to anyone, no matter what sort of genre you prefer. This is the type of film that has major re-watch value and one always finds something new to enjoy with each veiwing of this cinematic masterpiece.

When I seen the poster of this movie, I didn't think much at all. After I was force to go see it by my friends I realised how brilliant it was. It wasn't just your average action/thriller but it was more drama/revenge on a basis that you actually want to see it been taken. I found that Denzel Washington Character John Creasy was different as he wasn't prefect he had problems like all of us, expect he had a dark side which he tried to hide. The relationship that starts off between Creasy and Dakota Fanning character is pure class as it seems so real on the basis of the whole storyline. With the other characters like Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke this movie has a very pleasing cast to see together. I feel that this movie wasn't just another useless piece of garbage from Hollywood but something that will be remembered.

625984,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JN0W,Samuel McKewon,"[8, 10]","""Death is his art. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.""That is the right line for this movie, spoken by Christopher Walken, the right actor. Obsessed with the grandeur of bloodshed, ""Man On Fire"" is apocalyptic, spun from the roughest parts of the Old Testament. Tony Scott's movie is a kidnapping drama set in Mexico City - a ""special place"" according the end credits. Special indeed - take the film at its word, and half the cops are corrupt and in competition with kidnappers for ransom money. The corrupt judicial unit, dubbed ""La Hermandad,"" is impenetrable. Unless you're Denzel Washington.In a performance that melds elements of his Oscar-winning turn in ""Training Day"" and his work in ""Courage Under Fire,"" Washington is John Creasy, a suicidal alcoholic ex-Marine offered a job through war-buddy Rayburn (Walken) to protect the daughter of a sweatshop industrialist (Marc Anthony). This daughter, Pita, played by the increasingly skilled Dakota Fanning - who's given dialogue and mannerisms better suited to a 16-year-old - charms Creasy out of his shell, makes him become her swim coach. Fanning is, in a sense, a peculiar little girl, so far beyond her years in gestures that when she laughs at a joke of Rayburn's that she'd have no way of understanding, we begin to wonder if her maturity has been misused.So then - Pita's snatched in a setup, Creasy's shot, and after he recovers, his counterpunch makes ""Deathwish"" look like a cakewalk.""Kill them all,"" Pita's mother (a glammed-out Radha Mitchell) whispers as Creasy holds his Bible. This vengeance either invigorates you or it doesn't. As these films go, ""Man On Fire"" is among the most violent and malevolent. The script, by Brian Helgeland, pretends to ask the larger questions about sacrifice and morality, but it isn't into sparing lives. There is torture, then more of it, then death. When a nightclub is blown up, the crowd roars. That's quite a bit unlike the recent fire in Rhode Island.The most controversial scene involves a rectum bomb set to Creasy's digital pager. ""I wish - you had more time,"" Creasy intones ironically. A corrupt cop, stripped to his underwear and bent over a car under a freeway, has no more time.Cynical and a bit beefier, Washington is good as the tough hombre with a rocket launcher. The mark of a good actor is to want what he wants even when we shouldn't. Washington's that guy. Walken shuffles around with his offbeat cadence, utters the movie's best line, and disappears. Anthony is jittery in a limited role. Mickey Rourke makes a cameo using his real, non-sandpaper voice. Mitchell isn't much of an actor, but she's platinum gorgeous, and a perfect trophy wife she makes. Between her and Anthony's character, you wonder where Pita got her smarts.Mexico City, when we can get a clear view of it from Scott's dizzying camera, is a bright, messy backdrop. Scott's editor on ""Spy Game,"" Christian Wagner, achieves the feat making sense out of chaos and vice versa, though an early scene featuring a drunk, bawling Creasy could have been pieced together more clearly. Helgeland adapts A.J. Quinnel's novel, and it's not his best work - the plot holes are big enough to drive Hummers through. Scott resorts to flashing dialogue, both Spanish and English, on the screen in a pop-art, free-verse-poetry presentation that's at first unique, then distracting, then annoying. Notice, too, that it doesn't start happening until Fanning's offscreen.As it unfolds on a desolate bridge near a Biblical tree in the middle of Mexico, the end of ""Man On Fire"" is the kind of preordained, wide-shot-to-show-significance material Scott has loved since ""Enemy of the State,"" the first of his ""import"" trilogy that hopefully ends with this film. Prior to that Will Smith vehicle, Scott made hard-boiled, straight-ahead popcorn flicks - ""Days of Thunder,"" ""Top Gun,"" ""The Last Boy Scout"" ""Crimson Tide"" - that were shallow, lurid, painfully macho but, at the very least, aware of themselves and fun. ""Man On Fire"" is enamored with its potential greatness when it's really a B-movie playing with an A-list star and budget.",3,"Makes ""Deathwish"" look like a cakewalk.",1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,4111,"['Death', 'art', 'paint', 'masterpiece', 'right', 'line', 'movie', 'spoken', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'right', 'actor', 'Obsessed', 'grandeur', 'bloodshed', 'Man', 'Fire', 'apocalyptic', 'spun', 'roughest', 'parts', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'movie', 'kidnapping', 'drama', 'set', 'Mexico', 'City', 'special', 'place', 'according', 'end', 'credits', 'Special', 'indeed', 'take', 'film', 'word', 'cops', 'are', 'corrupt', 'competition', 'kidnappers', 'ransom', 'money', 'corrupt', 'judicial', 'unit', 'dubbed', 'La', 'Hermandad', 'impenetrable', ""'re"", 'Denzel', 'Washington.In', 'performance', 'elements', 'Oscar-winning', 'turn', 'Training', 'Day', 'work', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'Washington', 'John', 'Creasy', 'suicidal', 'alcoholic', 'ex-Marine', 'offered', 'job', 'war-buddy', 'Rayburn', 'Walken', 'protect', 'daughter', 'sweatshop', 'industrialist', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'daughter', 'Pita', 'played', 'increasingly', 'skilled', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'given', 'dialogue', 'mannerisms', 'better', 'suited', '16-year-old', 'charms', 'Creasy', 'shell', 'become', 'swim', 'coach', 'Fanning', 'sense', 'peculiar', 'little', 'girl', 'so', 'far', 'years', 'gestures', 'when', 'joke', 'Rayburn', ""'d"", 'have', 'way', 'understanding', 'begin', 'wonder', 'maturity', 'been', 'misused.So', 'then', 'Pita', 'snatched', 'setup', 'Creasy', 'shot', 'counterpunch', 'Deathwish', 'look', 'cakewalk', 'Kill', 'Pita', 'mother', 'glammed-out', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'whispers', 'Creasy', 'Bible', 'vengeance', ""n't"", 'films', 'go', 'Man', 'Fire', 'most', 'violent', 'malevolent', 'script', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'ask', 'larger', 'questions', 'sacrifice', 'morality', ""n't"", 'sparing', 'lives', 'torture', 'then', 'more', 'then', 'death', 'When', 'nightclub', 'blown', 'up', 'crowd', 'roars', 'quite', 'bit', 'recent', 'fire', 'Rhode', 'Island.The', 'most', 'controversial', 'scene', 'rectum', 'bomb', 'set', 'Creasy', 'digital', 'pager', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'Creasy', 'intones', 'ironically', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'stripped', 'underwear', 'bent', 'car', 'freeway', 'more', 'time.Cynical', 'bit', 'beefier', 'Washington', 'good', 'tough', 'hombre', 'rocket', 'launcher', 'mark', 'good', 'actor', 'want', 'what', 'even', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'Washington', 'guy', 'Walken', 'shuffles', 'offbeat', 'cadence', 'movie', 'best', 'line', 'disappears', 'Anthony', 'jittery', 'limited', 'role', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'cameo', 'using', 'real', 'non-sandpaper', 'voice', 'Mitchell', ""n't"", 'much', 'actor', 'platinum', 'gorgeous', 'perfect', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Between', 'Anthony', 'character', 'wonder', 'where', 'Pita', 'got', 'smarts.Mexico', 'City', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'clear', 'view', 'Scott', 'dizzying', 'camera', 'bright', 'messy', 'backdrop', 'Scott', 'editor', 'Spy', 'Game', 'Christian', 'Wagner', 'feat', 'making', 'sense', 'chaos', 'vice', 'versa', 'early', 'scene', 'featuring', 'drunk', 'bawling', 'Creasy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pieced', 'together', 'more', 'clearly', 'Helgeland', 'A.J', 'Quinnel', 'novel', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'Hummers', 'Scott', 'flashing', 'dialogue', 'Spanish', 'English', 'screen', 'pop-art', 'free-verse-poetry', 'presentation', 'first', 'unique', 'then', 'distracting', 'then', 'annoying', 'Notice', 'too', ""n't"", 'start', 'happening', 'Fanning', 'offscreen.As', 'desolate', 'bridge', 'Biblical', 'tree', 'middle', 'Mexico', 'end', 'Man', 'Fire', 'kind', 'preordained', 'wide-shot-to-show-significance', 'material', 'Scott', 'loved', 'Enemy', 'State', 'first', 'import', 'trilogy', 'hopefully', 'film', 'Prior', 'Will', 'Smith', 'vehicle', 'Scott', 'made', 'hard-boiled', 'straight-ahead', 'popcorn', 'flicks', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Last', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'were', 'shallow', 'lurid', 'painfully', 'macho', 'very', 'least', 'aware', 'fun', 'Man', 'Fire', 'enamored', 'potential', 'greatness', 'when', 'really', 'B-movie', 'playing', 'A-list', 'star', 'budget']",N/A
625985,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B00005JN0W,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[6, 8]","Revenge movies are so popular because we all like to feel that warm fuzzy of satisfaction when the guilty reprobate responsible for causing all that pain to our hero is finally blown up into tiny bloody pieces.  It's a comfortable feeling of validation that makes us glow with a delightful feeling of righteous fulfillment.  Right?Man On Fire is not necessarily a great movie, but it is a great revenge movie, unique in its choice of location, actors, and resolution; and that makes it worthy of a peek.Denzel Washington plays John W. Creasy, an ex-assassin from some sort of special ops group, who has retired from his work with Death to become an aimless and hopeless alcoholic.  He travels to Mexico City to visit his old friend Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) who has settled into a comfortable life there.Rayburn sets Creasy up with an easy job as a bodyguard to nine-year old Pita Ramos (expertly played by young Dakota Fanniing) daughter of well-off plant owner Samuel Ramos.  Creasy does not like people, but young Pita manages to wiggle her way into his heart.  Creasy is almost killed when she is kidnapped for ransom, and finds out through Rayburn that the ransom drop went bad.  Creasy then teams up with tenacious and levelheaded reporter Mariana Guerrero (talented Rachel Ticotin) and sets out to do what he does best; dish out death to everyone involved in the kidnapping.In Rayburn's words, ""A man can be an artist, food or whatever, it depends on what he's good at.  Creasy's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece.""Watch out for some stellar performances by Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Rahda Mitchell (I am so glad to see this talented actress get another leading role besides Pitch Black, she was great in that movie too), Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and (surprise) Marc Anthony.  Yes, he can act, and plays his part of Samuel Ramos with a style and substance that is missing in his singing career.There is wonderful scenery from Mexico City, a tight plot, a wonderful musical score, and a unique and bittersweet climax which all allow Man On Fire to rise up above the ""just another revenge movie"" it could have been.  The movie itself was a pleasure to watch and IMHO, worthy of purchase.  The only part of the actual movie that I didn't like was using too much of what I call Stutter-Flash scenes; jumpy, flashing scenes that alternate slow-mo and sped-up photography.  While adding to the surrealism of Creasy's world, a little goes a long way, and I think the movie over-uses this effect.What I didn't like about the DVD version was that the only special features available were the running commentaries that seem to have become popular with directors and actors.  To me, this is like having people blathering on annoyingly in the theater while you are trying to watch the movie.  I prefer interviews and behind-the-scenes features to the commentaries.  Also, the subtitles on the screen during the Spanish speaking parts were tiny, forcing blind-ol-me to sit closer to the TV than I wanted to in order to be able to read them.All in all, Man On Fire is a great movie; suspenseful and well acted with a little twisty surprise at the end that actually squeezed a tear from my withered and dried up soul.

Denzel deserves an oscar nom but i think Jesus will win, Dakota is also very good in this movie and might get herself a nom, just goes to show kids CAN ACT.  The story is well done and the dialogue is great.  The style is original and adds a little more to the movie(though sometimes that zooming and spazing get a little annoying), the music is sometimes off for the mood of the scene but doesn't take too much away from the feel, its also very powerful because the relastionship between creasy bear and pita is heartwarming and the ending is also very sad, its got some very funny humor early on to show how they grow on eachother, but soon things get serious.  Don't expect some big huge action sequence, there are some creative killings and some explosions but thats about all the action.  Mostly its a charater drama, a well done one, and for that i think it deserves some oscar noms, i give it a 9 out of a 10, the spaztic camera use and some of the music could have been worked on, but other then that its a brilliant movie.

Quinnell and previously filmed as a 1987 vehicle for Scott Glenn, this re-make starts out with a random kidnapping in Mexico City of a well-off, young teen boy,  flash-film storytelling of the kidnapper's dirty deed of graphically cutting off of the boy's ear that is subsequently sent to the boy's father, and a ransom drop being set up and accomplished...Flash forward and enter Denzel Washington arriving in crime-ridden Mexico City as drunkard, burned out and severely depressed bodyguard, Creasy and Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam & Uptown Girls) as Creasy's young client and soon-to-be kidnapping victim, 9 year-old Pita.After Creasy reticently accepts the bodyguard job he and Pita soon develop a close relationship, much to the chagrin and surprise of Creasy. During a shootout with corrupt police officers & other ""bad guys"", Creasy is shot within an inch of his life. Pita is abducted during the shooting and soon a ransom drop is coordinated but then terribly botched. Pita is presumably killed although no body is found.Creasy avows to revenge the death of his young friend who made him live again, stop his drinking and made him truly happy just when Creasy was hitting rock-bottom.Latino pop singer and Mr. Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony turns in a surprising and quite adequate performance as Pita's father, Samuel, Christopher Walken as understated Rayburn, Creasy's best friend and confidant and even Mickey Rourke as Samuel's bottom-feeding, family lawyer, Jordan. All turn in believable performances.I am not an action film lover by any means but I truly enjoyed the story with it's ever twisting and turning plotline; no matter how predicable, the directing talents of Tony Scott (Top Gun, Crimson Tide and Mr. Ridley Scott's little brother), the flash image storytelling, overall cinematography and of course, the excellent performances from the actors - especially young Dakota Fanning's and Washington's rapport and chemistry between their two characters.Happy Watching!",4,"""A Bullet Always Tells The Truth...""

625997,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B00005JN0W,SteakSalad101,"[4, 4]","It is an absolute rarity that a movie comes along like the 2004 remake of Man On Fire. Set in Mexico City, Man on Fire takes on the dramatic and dark plot line of ransom kidnapping, violent revenge, and how horrible a shattered family can be all put into a blender and coming out as a well made, fruitful smoothie. Denzel Washington takes on the gritty role as Creasy, an ex-CIA assassin who's burnt out and completely given up on life. Reluctantly he assumes the role of a bodyguard for a 9-year-old girl in Mexico City, the daughter of a very rich couple, as kidnapping in Mexico City is at an all-time high. Dakota Fanning, my favorite actress and one of the best in Hollywood--assumes the role of 9-year-old Pita, the girl whom Creasy is protecting. They start out on the wrong foot--Pita tries to get close to Creasy, yet afflicted by his past, he is an anti-social person who stands alone. Eventually, though, he softens and the two become very good friends and Creasy begins to realize that maybe life could be worth living. Suddenly, the charming and touching moments are shattered when Pita is kidnapped by gangsters and Creasy mortally wounded. Convicted of killing two cops during the kidnapping, Creasy goes on the run and his life is once again broken when his newfound best friend has been kidnapped and there is no sign of her. With nothing to lose, Creasy embarks on an objective to kill all people who were involved with the kidnapping in any way, shape, or form. The movie is beautifully executed, punishingly brutal, disturbingly realistic, excruciatingly violent, and just may be the best movie I've seen in a WHILE. All the plot summaries on the Internet for this film, including mine, are misleading: the film is NOT about revenge...it's about something much more deeper and emotional than that. The execution of the film is seamless: you experience every ounce of love, hatred, and vengeance right along with Creasy through the entire movie.

They are truly believable and it's good to see them get what they deserve as the story winds down.The only possible miscasting could be that of Dakota Fanning. Although I loved her in the part of Pita, an anglo mother with a Mexican husband (Spanish & Indian) would most likely give birth to a child of darker features than those of Dakota's. But this is an extremely minor critique and certainly won't stop me from my own purchase of this fine movie.Being a former resident and kidnapping survivor of Mexico D.F, watching this film gave me the same feeling I experienced during my own ordeal.

626000,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00005JN0W,Steve Douglas,"[0, 0]","I don't write reviews of acting, or my opinions about the significance of a film, but this film is certainly one of Denzel Washington's best and is a high quality emotional roller coaster about love and personal redemption. Violence is throughout so if you have kids, be forewarned.Thus, this review will only be about the quality of the disc itself.  I did not have the standard def release but just a burned copy of it so this will not be a comparison.It is a single Blu Ray disc with no extras of any kind other than the trailer for Man on Fire and 3 other movie previews.  I hate it when BluRays, or any DVD, puts previews for other films on a disc as it makes you pay for advertising and the amount of room these previews take up on the disc just means that the producers simply have to compress the main film even more to make room for them.The video transfer is an interesting one.  I really am not sure whether they really remastered the film at all.  While it is not bad or disturbing, there is grain throughout the entire film.  This grain is something many like as it provides some depth.  Many parts of the film are heavily color graded and this brings in even more grain.  The blacks have also been crushed so that you do not see details in many of the darker areas.  This might have been done on purpose and I am not judging here, just making the observation.  Most of the film transfer to BR appears to be warmly color corrected and some of the tans appeared to be a touch too much.  A strange image comes in for a very brief moment at 8:45 in the beginning of the film.  Denzel is in the back of a car and there is a 'weird zoom' that I cannot properly describe here, it is almost as if they were making a correction to the aspect ratio.  I had to play that one section a few times and it was consistent.  Other than what I have mentioned I noticed no aliasing or artifacts for the duration of the movie.The DTS HD 5.1 audio is the star of the transfer with excellent use of all 5 channels. The lossless audio is as clear as a bell with all audio levels properly set so there will be no adjusting volumes during your watching of the film once you have set the volume you are comfortable with.  Your sub will be in constant use and there really was some deep LFE work on this the audio track and not just from explosions either.  The Linda Ronstadt soundtrack fully envelops you from all channels quite nicely.  There is some fine panning between channels and plenty of discreet directionality from the rear channels  providing not only a good front stage but the rear stage as well.Thus, I give the video transfer a 3.5, the audio transfer a 5 and the movie itself a 5.  The movie is a good one and, despite its age, retains strong legs and would make a good addition to your blu ray collection.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Man on Fire-Blu Ray,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,3152,"['do', ""n't"", 'write', 'reviews', 'acting', 'opinions', 'significance', 'film', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'best', 'high', 'quality', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'love', 'personal', 'redemption', 'Violence', 'so', 'have', 'kids', 'be', 'forewarned.Thus', 'review', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'quality', 'disc', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'standard', 'def', 'release', 'just', 'burned', 'copy', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'comparison.It', 'single', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'extras', 'kind', 'other', 'trailer', 'Man', 'Fire', '3', 'other', 'movie', 'previews', 'hate', 'when', 'BluRays', 'DVD', 'previews', 'other', 'films', 'disc', 'pay', 'advertising', 'amount', 'room', 'previews', 'take', 'up', 'disc', 'just', 'producers', 'simply', 'have', 'compress', 'main', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'make', 'room', 'them.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'interesting', 'one', 'really', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'remastered', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'disturbing', 'grain', 'entire', 'film', 'grain', 'something', 'many', 'depth', 'Many', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'heavily', 'color', 'graded', 'even', 'more', 'grain', 'blacks', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'crushed', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'details', 'many', 'darker', 'areas', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'purpose', 'am', 'not', 'judging', 'here', 'just', 'making', 'observation', 'Most', 'film', 'transfer', 'BR', 'be', 'warmly', 'color', 'corrected', 'tans', 'appeared', 'be', 'touch', 'too', 'much', 'strange', 'image', 'very', 'brief', 'moment', '8:45', 'beginning', 'film', 'Denzel', 'back', 'car', ""'weird"", 'zoom', 'can', 'not', 'properly', 'describe', 'here', 'almost', 'were', 'making', 'correction', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'had', 'play', 'one', 'section', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'consistent', 'Other', 'what', 'have', 'mentioned', 'noticed', 'aliasing', 'artifacts', 'duration', 'movie.The', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'audio', 'star', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'use', '5', 'channels', 'lossless', 'audio', 'as', 'clear', 'bell', 'audio', 'levels', 'properly', 'set', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'adjusting', 'volumes', 'watching', 'film', 'once', 'have', 'set', 'volume', 'are', 'comfortable', 'sub', 'will', 'be', 'constant', 'use', 'really', 'was', 'deep', 'LFE', 'work', 'audio', 'track', 'not', 'just', 'explosions', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'soundtrack', 'fully', 'channels', 'quite', 'nicely', 'fine', 'panning', 'channels', 'plenty', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'rear', 'channels', 'providing', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'front', 'stage', 'rear', 'stage', 'well.Thus', 'give', 'video', 'transfer', '3.5', 'audio', 'transfer', '5', 'movie', '5', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'age', 'strong', 'legs', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'addition', 'blu', 'ray', 'collection.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

It is a visually-dazzling film anchored by a bevy of fine performances.Ex-CIA operative Creasy (Denzel Washington) heads to Mexico to visit his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) and to find employment.  His skills land him a job as the personal bodyguard of Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of a Mexican businessman.  As fate would have it, the young girl is soon abducted while under his care.  When Creasy recovers from the wounds he sustained in the kidnapping, he embarks on a vengeance-fueled quest to punish those responsible for taking Pita.""Man on Fire"" has an uncompromising tone that many studio films shy away from these days.  It is a welcome throwback to the savage revenge flicks from prior decades that were made with little concern for those viewers with delicate sensibilities.  Washington turns in a tour-de-force performance that is filled with passion and ire.  You cannot take your eyes off of him when he is on screen.  Fanning distinguishes herself also and serves notice that she is an actress with a bright future ahead of her.  Furthermore, the supporting cast sparkles as Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, and Walken all hit the right notes.  Walken in particular is outstanding in a part that contrasts sharply with the more eccentric roles he usually finds himself in.  ""Man on Fire"" does have some problems with its ending but the film as a whole is still immensely watchable.  A bullet always tells the truth indeed.",3,"""Forgiveness is between them and God.

Ruiz ""Tell Me a Story""","[5, 5]","stars Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning in made-for-them roles, this movie is a definite highlight in both their careers.  I watched it in the theatre, I'm just now getting it on DVD (had to wait to find the special edition, refuse to spend money on those no-feature DVDs).  It is an awesome movie - the first half has the feel of a sweet father/daughter story, the second half like a revenge story, yet it all flows together into a wonderful, touching, (and yes tear-jerker) film.Dakota Fanning is Pita, the only daughter of Samuel and Lisa Ramos (her father is played by Marc Anthony, who is brilliant in his role as the tortured father).  Denzel plays Creasy, the bodyguard hired to protect Pita as kidnappings of wealthy children in Mexico City is on the rise.  He has his demons, and resists Pita's charms for a while, but is soon won over by her sweet disposition and unconditional love.  Pita loves Creasy, how could he not love her back.  With her parents gone so much on business, Creasy becomes a second father to her.  And then the unthinkable - a kidnapping attempt.Not saying another word, other than Mickey Rourke as the lawyer and Christopher Walken as Denzel's ex-military friend Rayburn are brilliant casting decisions, and this is an awesome movie.  Very cool effects in some of the action scenes, you often feel you are in Creasy's head.As to the special features on this DVD - bravo.  This is the way special features should be done.  On disk 1 is the main feature along with a choice of 2 commentaries - one by the director, the other by the writer, the producer, and Dakota Fanning.  She is adorable to listen to on her take throughout the movie.  The writer and the producer do their jobs well both putting in other relevant information and guiding her through the thought process so she shares what we'll be interested in.  The only thing that could have been added was to include Denzel on the commentary, even if they had to edit him in rather than have him on site while they recorded.  On disk 2 are 33 minutes of deleted scenes, with option director commentary, a 6 part documentary on the making of the film which includes cast interviews (and even Denzel is interviewed), an alternate ending, a series of camera angles for the kidnapping scene, music video, and other production features such as storyboarding.

626013,A3PCIH7XDZGLHL,B00005JN0W,TheFracturedCritic,"[3, 3]","It's a well known fact that deep at the heart of a large quantity of movies is revenge. One certain character gets done wrong so they, in turn, feel the need to go on some type of rampage to exact their revenge. In the process they violently destroy one person after another until we're left with the long awaited showdown between the 'good' guy and the 'bad' guy. Often times in these movies the hero will encounter betrayal and loss and rise from a near death point to conquer.Que Man On Fire; a story about a drunken, amatuer bodyguard yet qualified in his own way, named John Creasy. Set up by Rayburn, an old friend of his, he accepts the job of gaurding of the young girl Pita. In the beginning Creasy is adamant on the fact that he is being payed by Pita's parents to be her body guard and not her friend. After her parents leave on a trip, however, Creasy takes up the job on improving Pita's swimming skills and begins to teach her the ropes. This springs a relationship between the two that is torn when Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is not only shot and hospitalized, but arrested for the murder of two cops. With the aid of a cop, a reporter and his friend Rayburn, Creasy is able to get back on his two feet. Out of his depression and anger and instructed by Lisa, Pita's mom, Creasy then goes on a vengence rampage to kill everyone involved in the abduction of Pita.So what makes Man On Fire different from every other revenge film out there? Well to start off you can actually make an emotional connection with Creasy (the hard-broiled 'good' guy), something that is often left out of revenge movies. Another major hit is when Pita is kidnapped, you realize it. You can't just write it off as some girl getting kidnapped by some guys. With a well acted scenario of murder, kidnapping and betrayal the characters actually seem like real people and now pawns of the writer's guilty pleasure. Another major differentiation is the wonderfully crafted view which the director sets us up with. Instead of being a straighforward, standard editing movie, there are many camera, editing and visual tricks used to enhance the viewing pleasure (think Traffic plus five). All these add for a nice change in the scenario and a movie that puts a spin on the over cliched genre.So what are the cons? This is a long, long sit. There's a lengthy period before any of the 'action' gets started. This was most likely used to establish the emotional connection between the characters, but one can only wish that they would've used shorter methods to reach the destination. In fact, I don't know if I could sit through the entire thing again knowing all that is there before they start getting down to the action.So does all this put it at a higher position than other revenge movies or am I just a blood thirsty viewer who loved seeing Denzel Washington with a sawed off shotgun? Who knows, but watch the movie on your own and see what you think. Liking it more now than I did when I watched it, I give Man On Fire a 7 out of 10 (or 4 stars).",4,Man On Fire,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,3036,"['well', 'known', 'fact', 'deep', 'heart', 'large', 'quantity', 'movies', 'revenge', 'One', 'certain', 'character', 'done', 'wrong', 'turn', 'feel', 'need', 'go', 'type', 'rampage', 'exact', 'revenge', 'process', 'violently', 'destroy', 'one', 'person', ""'re"", 'left', 'long', 'awaited', 'showdown', ""'good"", 'guy', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'Often', 'movies', 'hero', 'will', 'encounter', 'betrayal', 'loss', 'rise', 'near', 'death', 'point', 'conquer.Que', 'Man', 'Fire', 'story', 'drunken', 'amatuer', 'bodyguard', 'yet', 'qualified', 'own', 'way', 'named', 'John', 'Creasy', 'Set', 'up', 'Rayburn', 'old', 'friend', 'job', 'gaurding', 'young', 'girl', 'Pita', 'beginning', 'Creasy', 'adamant', 'fact', 'being', 'payed', 'Pita', 'parents', 'be', 'body', 'guard', 'not', 'friend', 'parents', 'leave', 'trip', 'however', 'Creasy', 'up', 'job', 'improving', 'Pita', 'swimming', 'skills', 'teach', 'ropes', 'relationship', 'two', 'torn', 'when', 'Pita', 'kidnapped', 'Creasy', 'not', 'only', 'shot', 'hospitalized', 'arrested', 'murder', 'two', 'cops', 'aid', 'cop', 'reporter', 'friend', 'Rayburn', 'Creasy', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'two', 'feet', 'depression', 'anger', 'instructed', 'Lisa', 'Pita', 'mom', 'Creasy', 'then', 'vengence', 'rampage', 'kill', 'everyone', 'involved', 'abduction', 'Pita.So', 'what', 'Man', 'Fire', 'different', 'other', 'revenge', 'film', 'there', 'Well', 'start', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Creasy', 'hard-broiled', ""'good"", 'guy', 'something', 'often', 'left', 'out', 'revenge', 'movies', 'major', 'hit', 'when', 'Pita', 'kidnapped', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'write', 'off', 'girl', 'getting', 'kidnapped', 'guys', 'well', 'acted', 'scenario', 'murder', 'kidnapping', 'betrayal', 'characters', 'actually', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'now', 'pawns', 'writer', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'major', 'differentiation', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'view', 'director', 'up', 'Instead', 'being', 'straighforward', 'standard', 'editing', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'camera', 'editing', 'visual', 'tricks', 'used', 'enhance', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'think', 'Traffic', 'five', 'add', 'nice', 'change', 'scenario', 'movie', 'spin', 'over', 'cliched', 'genre.So', 'what', 'are', 'cons', 'long', 'long', 'sit', 'lengthy', 'period', ""'action"", 'started', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'used', 'establish', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'used', 'shorter', 'methods', 'reach', 'destination', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'sit', 'entire', 'thing', 'again', 'knowing', 'start', 'getting', 'down', 'action.So', 'put', 'higher', 'position', 'other', 'revenge', 'movies', 'am', 'just', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'viewer', 'who', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'sawed', 'shotgun', 'Who', 'watch', 'movie', 'own', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'Liking', 'more', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'watched', 'give', 'Man', 'Fire', '7', '10', '4', 'stars']",N/A

626018,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JN0W,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[3, 5]","Director:  Tony ScottCast:  Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini, Rachel Ticotin, Jesus Ochoa, Mickey Rourke.Running Time:  146 minutesRated R for language and strong violence.Tony Scott, mastermind behind thrillers such as ""Crimson Tide"", ""The Last Boy Scout"", and ""Enemy of the State"", creates this extremely dark, violent portrayal of a man who has nothing to lose takes his rage out on the filth of society.  Washington plays Creasy, a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption. He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past. It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed. With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before. But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does. Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose ""La Hermanidad"" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, ""Man on Fire,"" astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.  Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. While the two leads carry the film, there are only mediocre performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini.  ""Man on Fire"" is saved by Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.'Man on Fire' had potential to be an outstanding film, being based on a great novel but Scott and Helgeland ultimately cut short on the relationship in order for action. Dizzying, MTV-like editing is used for many of the action scene and it feels as if Scott is trying to emulate both his brother, Ridley and filmmaker Oliver Stone. In 1994 Stone released ""Natural Born Killers"" which used aesthetics as a focal point to the narrative of the film including some hyper-real scenes. Scott seemed to favor using a similar technique in ""Man on Fire"" however the negatives outweigh the positives. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is at once ferocious, especially considering his work on films like 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Swordfish'. Christian Wagner (True Romance, Mission: Impossible II) edits with the same kind of speed but instead of adding to the film it also subtracts. The action scenes feel unnecessarily disruptive and it's when the violence on screen happens that Scott actually gains momentum. These scenes last more in the memory than the relationship. Helgeland's script dramatically makes cuts to the novel, and frankly it's uncertain that he even read it! Characters are made into two-dimensional pawns, the setting is changed from Italy to Mexico City, and whole chapters of character development are swiftly cut.  In the end 'Man on Fire' gives into the typical formula. The visuals can be arresting, the action is entertaining, and the leads are worthwhile but the mess created by the filmmakers ultimately drags it down.",3,Man on Fire  (2004),1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,4452,"['Director', 'Tony', 'ScottCast', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'Jesus', 'Ochoa', 'Mickey', 'Rourke.Running', 'Time', '146', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'strong', 'violence.Tony', 'Scott', 'mastermind', 'thrillers', 'such', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'Last', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'Enemy', 'State', 'extremely', 'dark', 'violent', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'lose', 'rage', 'out', 'filth', 'society', 'Washington', 'Creasy', 'down-on-his-luck', 'ex-mercenary', 'who', 'now', 'stooped', 'drinking', 'flash', 'Jack', 'Daniels', 'old', 'partner', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'chance', 'redemption', 'hired', 'bodyguard', '10', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Mexican', 'businessman', 'Marc', 'Antony', 'American-born', 'wife', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Fanning', 'work', 'oil', 'water', 'first', 'not', 'mixing', 'very', 'well', 'really', 'form', 'bond', 'encouraging', 'do', 'better', 'swimming', 'same', 'time', 'attempts', 'deal', 'demons', 'past', 'very', 'bond', 'will', 'force', 'Washington', 'back', 'old', 'line', 'work', 'when', 'Fanning', 'kidnapped', 'held', '10', 'million', 'ransom', 'nearly', 'killed', 'almost', 'other', 'stock', 'action', 'hero', 'Schwarzenneger', 'Segal', 'etc', 'subsequent', 'bloodbath', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'repetitive', 'schlock', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'Washington', 'character', 'killing', 'reason', 'not', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'what', 'Still', 'help', 'very', 'intrepid', 'Mexican', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'expose', 'La', 'Hermanidad', 'Brotherhood', 'kidnap', 'gang', 'responsible', 'Fanning', 'abduction.Based', 'novel', 'A.J', 'Quinnell', 'Man', 'Fire', 'astutely', 'written', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'flashily', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'coolly', 'efficient', 'action', 'picture', 'never', 'away', 'raw', 'brutality', 'subject', 'matter', 'risk', 'asking', 'identify', 'man', 'who', 'intents', 'purposes', 'achieving', 'redemption', 'torturing', 'murdering', 'admittedly', 'disreputable', 'people', 'scenes', 'carnage', 'violence', 'are', 'intense', 'suspenseful', 'even', 'do', 'times', 'border', 'exploitative', 'Even', 'better', 'are', 'quiet', 'intimate', 'moments', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'early', 'parts', 'movie', 'Washington', 'wonderful', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'establish', 'natural', 'easygoing', 'rapport', 'set', 'stage', 'chaos', 'turmoil', 'follow', 'Washington', 'movie', 'quality', 'stoic', 'righteousness', 'making', 'understand', 'character', 'emotional', 'level', 'even', 'what', 'doing', 'eludes', 'intellectually', 'two', 'leads', 'carry', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'Walken', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Man', 'Fire', 'saved', 'Washington', 'delightful', 'Ms.', 'Fanning', 'who', 'steal', 'show', ""'Man"", 'Fire', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'outstanding', 'film', 'being', 'based', 'great', 'novel', 'Scott', 'Helgeland', 'ultimately', 'cut', 'short', 'relationship', 'order', 'action', 'Dizzying', 'MTV-like', 'editing', 'used', 'many', 'action', 'scene', 'Scott', 'trying', 'emulate', 'brother', 'Ridley', 'filmmaker', 'Oliver', 'Stone', '1994', 'Stone', 'released', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'used', 'aesthetics', 'focal', 'point', 'narrative', 'film', 'including', 'hyper-real', 'scenes', 'Scott', 'seemed', 'favor', 'using', 'similar', 'technique', 'Man', 'Fire', 'however', 'negatives', 'outweigh', 'positives', 'cinematography', 'Paul', 'Cameron', 'once', 'ferocious', 'especially', 'considering', 'work', 'films', ""'Gone"", 'Sixty', 'Seconds', ""'Swordfish"", 'Christian', 'Wagner', 'True', 'Romance', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'II', 'same', 'kind', 'speed', 'instead', 'adding', 'film', 'also', 'action', 'scenes', 'feel', 'unnecessarily', 'disruptive', 'when', 'violence', 'screen', 'Scott', 'actually', 'gains', 'momentum', 'scenes', 'last', 'more', 'memory', 'relationship', 'Helgeland', 'script', 'dramatically', 'cuts', 'novel', 'frankly', 'uncertain', 'even', 'read', 'Characters', 'are', 'made', 'two-dimensional', 'pawns', 'setting', 'changed', 'Italy', 'Mexico', 'City', 'whole', 'chapters', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'swiftly', 'cut', 'end', ""'Man"", 'Fire', 'typical', 'formula', 'visuals', 'can', 'be', 'arresting', 'action', 'entertaining', 'leads', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'mess', 'created', 'filmmakers', 'ultimately', 'down']",N/A

I know some would have loved that aspect but I got annoyed with it.The final plot, not really a spoiler so read on...when Washington phones up The Voice he negotiates to give him The Voice's brother in return for the girl, but he must die. I'm sure given the option The Voice would easily give up the girl when you consider the state Washignton had his family in, why agree to be killed aswell? This seems like the plot writers jus added it in to create a sad ending.Also I never felt Washington was a 'hard man', compared to say Training Day. I'm not sure if this was intended, maybe he is deliberately portrayed as a mere human with his weaknesses.On the upside Washington certainly shined, the plot was great up until the end, but even that wasn't a major let down.

Horribly over-directed in places, true, but nowhere near as irritating as Domino, which is the closest ADDS filmmaking has come to projectile vomiting at the audience to date. It helps that Scott has a decent script and a good cast to keep his worst excesses in check, and it has to be said that some of the stylistic touches (such as the very active subtitling) are really pretty good. He's better at framing the surrounding scenes than some of the big moments, which are fairly tension and adrenaline-free for all their imagination, but he's prepared to get his hands far dirtier than you'd expect from a mainstream studio picture, and he even manages a couple of moments of emotional resonance as well. It's certainly much better than the dire original, which only had a good John Scott score (part of which turned up in Die Hard) going for it (aside from the film's change of location from Italy to Mexico, the song has changed from Someone to Watch Over Me - well, Ridley beat him to that one - to Linda Ronstadt's infinitely less relevant cover of Blue Bayou).

One day his close friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) decides to get Creasy a job as a bodyguard for a man (Marc Anthony), his wife and their daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning)who all live in Mexico City, which at the time is a hotbed for kidnappings and police corruption.At first Creasy is reticent in taking the job but ultimately accepts the position. Pita tries to strike up a friendship with Creasy but gets blocked intensely.  As time passes Creasy breaks down the wall and begins to develop a mentoring relationship with Pita while regainig his soul piece by piece.All that changes when an attack goes off that results in Creasy killing a pair of corrupt police officers while being wounded himself and Pita being kidnapped.  When the kidnappers get in touch with the parents and demand a ransom for the girl's safe return, a drop is made but suddenly gets severely botched when the kidnapper's brother is murdered in an ambush by police.While recovering, Creasy gets word of the kidnapping and screwed drop and automatically assumes that Pita has been killed.  The darkness that he had pushed out of his soul returns with a vengeance (literally) as he begins a plan to find Pita's kidnappers using a little resourfulness of a reporter and a good police officer in a quest for a serious level of payback.What Creasy finds is a web of deceit, double-crosses, and corruption that sends the entire story almost full circle and reveals that the ones that destroy us the worst are those that are the closest to us.Washington shows amazing range with the role of Creasy, stepping from darkness to light and back again in extremely convincing fashion, as does Christopher Walken playing a character seemingly less off the beaten path than most of the characters he has played in past movies.  The biggest surprises to me in the movie have to be the performances from Dakota Fanning, showing how amazingly near the level of an adult actress she plays for being such a little kid, and Marc Anthony showing that his range can definitely go far beyond his singing career and the fact that he is married to Jennifer Lopez.The only thing that might bother some people with the film is that it seems a little too stylized like something you would see in an MTV documentary (fast moving cameras, super-imposed subtitles when they seem unnecessary) and the fact that the movie doesn't have a nice and neat happy ending.Man on Fire is an action/revenge film that seems true to life wiht just a slight touch of Hollywood style thrown in for texture but still is definitely a movie that can be thought-provoking as well.",4,Shows how the darkness can reveal a suprising light,1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,3023,"['Man', 'Fire', 'study', 'how', 'humans', 'can', 'redeem', 'return', 'light', 'only', 'darkness', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'right', 'reasons.Denzel', 'Washington', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', 'twice', 'amazing', 'career', 'playing', 'Creasy', 'burned-out', 'dangerous', 'former', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'gotten', 'business', 'allowed', 'life', 'take', 'severe', 'downward', 'spiral', 'drinking', 'excessively', 'One', 'day', 'close', 'friend', 'Rayburn', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'get', 'Creasy', 'job', 'bodyguard', 'man', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'live', 'Mexico', 'City', 'time', 'hotbed', 'kidnappings', 'police', 'corruption.At', 'first', 'Creasy', 'reticent', 'taking', 'job', 'ultimately', 'position', 'Pita', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'Creasy', 'blocked', 'intensely', 'time', 'Creasy', 'breaks', 'down', 'wall', 'develop', 'mentoring', 'relationship', 'Pita', 'regainig', 'soul', 'piece', 'piece.All', 'changes', 'when', 'attack', 'results', 'Creasy', 'killing', 'pair', 'corrupt', 'police', 'officers', 'being', 'wounded', 'Pita', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'When', 'kidnappers', 'get', 'touch', 'parents', 'demand', 'ransom', 'girl', 'safe', 'return', 'drop', 'made', 'suddenly', 'severely', 'botched', 'when', 'kidnapper', 'brother', 'murdered', 'ambush', 'police.While', 'recovering', 'Creasy', 'word', 'kidnapping', 'screwed', 'drop', 'automatically', 'Pita', 'been', 'killed', 'darkness', 'had', 'pushed', 'soul', 'returns', 'vengeance', 'literally', 'plan', 'find', 'Pita', 'kidnappers', 'using', 'little', 'resourfulness', 'reporter', 'good', 'police', 'officer', 'quest', 'serious', 'level', 'payback.What', 'Creasy', 'web', 'deceit', 'double-crosses', 'corruption', 'entire', 'story', 'almost', 'full', 'circle', 'reveals', 'ones', 'destroy', 'worst', 'are', 'are', 'closest', 'us.Washington', 'shows', 'amazing', 'range', 'role', 'Creasy', 'stepping', 'darkness', 'light', 'back', 'again', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'fashion', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'playing', 'character', 'seemingly', 'less', 'beaten', 'path', 'most', 'characters', 'played', 'past', 'movies', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'movie', 'have', 'be', 'performances', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'showing', 'how', 'amazingly', 'level', 'adult', 'actress', 'being', 'such', 'little', 'kid', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'showing', 'range', 'can', 'definitely', 'go', 'far', 'singing', 'career', 'fact', 'married', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez.The', 'only', 'thing', 'might', 'bother', 'people', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'stylized', 'something', 'would', 'see', 'MTV', 'documentary', 'fast', 'moving', 'cameras', 'super-imposed', 'subtitles', 'when', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'nice', 'neat', 'happy', 'ending.Man', 'Fire', 'action/revenge', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'wiht', 'just', 'slight', 'touch', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'thrown', 'texture', 'still', 'definitely', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'thought-provoking', 'well']",N/A
626026,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JN0W,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","It's the cast, and their great acting that saves 'Man on Fire' from being on B-movie list.  See, the director is Tony Scott, the guy behind 'Top Gun' and 'True Romance' which means that you cannot get round characters or anything deep in here.  To be honest, the script by Brian Helgeland (who should have slowed down his pace after 'Mystic River') is full of holes, made out of cliched set-pieces.However, you get real professionals here -- this time, Denzel Washington as our anti-hero Creasy, ex-government special agent how is hired for protecting a little girl 'Pita' in Mexico, where, the film claims, kidnapping became no longer an unusual event.  As this long film (2hrs 26 mins) unfolds, Creasy confronts the crime syndicate alone, who attempt a violent kidnap plan on the little girl.Little girl Pita is played by Dakota Fanning, who had been  incidentally a kidnapped girl in 'Trapped' before, and like that previous so-so film, she easily shows that she is just amazing among the B-action film, especially the amusing bantering humor with Denzel's Creasy, whose job, he supposes at first, doesn't include being friendly.After the slow-moving first half, which concentrates on the relations between the man and the girl, the latter half changes the tone in a drastic way, with the furious Creasy who is bent on revenge, or in plain words, killing.  Denzel Washington manages to get more violent -- I mean, very graphic violence -- than the cop in Oscar-winning 'Training Day,' and some of you may find what he does very questionable.  Well, but that's what Creasy does, the man on fire.The film scores bonus points thanks to the great supports -- Christopher Walken and Giancarlo Giannini are real standout, while Rhada Mitchell, Rachel Ticotin, and Mickey Rourke are all effective.  Believe me or not, Chris is not a bad guy.  Really.The film's total results are, however, hampered by its own overdone cameraworks -- fast-cutting, slow motions, double exposures, and so on and on, all of which are irritating to  us.  While we know that more traditional images would be more effective in creating the mood of the city in Mexico, the MTV style camara only prevents the actions from going on smoothly.

But unlike ""The Punisher"" movie, ""Man on Fire"" turns out better than I expected it to be. In this movie, Denzel becomes a ruthless Frank Castle-like anti-hero. But his character makes The Punisher look like Robin. Yes, he becomes one ruthless mofo once the plot begins to unfold, severely punishing those that committed a heinous act upon himself and others around him. ""Man on Fire"" is a great, bloody, merciless, and emotional action flick that requires several viewings to really soak up the story.As you all know from the previews (and then some), Denzel plays Creasy, an ex-CIA assassin hired by a family in Mexico City to protect a young girl named Pita (played by Dakota Fanning). Creasy has a drinking problem and mostly avoids socializing with the young girl. But it isn't until later on when he then begins to gradually becomes ""friends"" with the young girl. He becomes attached and treats her like the daughter he never had. But then things get cut short when a group of thugs shoot Creasy and take the young girl, leaving him to die.But he manages to survive. Once he fully recovers, he shifts into Frank Castle-mode, punishing and killing those who were involved from simple low-life thugs, to corrupted officials, leading up to the movie's climatic and emotional ending.This movie is nothing short of stunning and amazing. Denzel yet again pulls off another amazing performance as the troubled man who had little to live for. The young Dakota Fanning seems to have a promising career ahead of herself, making her one of the best child actors around since Haley Joel Osment. The chemistry between the two is there. Even though it took a while for it to develop between the characters, you then sense emotion that wasn't seen much between the girl and her parents. The other actors such as Marc Anthony and Christopher Walken do fine jobs, even with roles that aren't very big. The movie score kinda resembles what was heard on ""Gladiator,"" but it nonetheless still sounds beautiful.""Man on Fire"" is one of the best action movies of recent times. It's the kind of action flick that keeps you thrilled until its climatic ending. It contains many twists amd turns that'll just boggle your mind. It contains many gory and action-packed scenes to keep you entertained. Tony Scott has made a movie that I dare call a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2004.

Marshall,"[3, 11]","For a film with such worthy actors and an interesting storyline one would expect this movie to really be on fire...sadly its embers don't last very long.Denzel Washington plays an aging alcoholic body guard who finds a job protecting the child of a wealthy couple in Mexico. The young girl is played beautifully by Dakota Fanning who is the one breath of fresh air in this movie! Washington does his best to protect Fanning while becoming her unexpected mentor and friend along the way. The story has touching moments that could have lapsed into great ones had this film been directed by someone who cared about the outcome and not the quirky artsy movements of his camera lens instead. Despite all the ""fire"" this movie was supposed to contain it was hard to see its true meaning through all the smoke and awkward camera angles. If you like ""who-dun-its"" this one leaves little mystery; the culprit is obvious from the first few scenes.I found myself sorely disappointed in this movie because I had high expectations. The director Tony Scott has done excellent movies in the past but this one should have been left on the cutting room floor until he adapted his camera styles and strange moving sub-titles to a more traditional sequence. I found myself far too distracted by all the darkness and movement in the film when in reality the story itself would have sufficed. Scott never allowed Washington's mystery character to reveal himself; for instance the camera catches severe scarring on his hands many times in the movie but the viewer never finds out where they came from or why the scars were sometimes important. Dakota Fanning gets lost in this film as well. I felt her character would have had more impact had Scott allowed us to see what she was experiencing. It is a good film for action junkies but people who enjoy substance will walk away wondering what just happened to them and reaching for aspirin to correct the overactive camera damage to their eyes.",2,Easily Extinguished,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,1971,"['film', 'such', 'worthy', 'actors', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'fire', 'sadly', 'embers', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long.Denzel', 'Washington', 'aging', 'alcoholic', 'body', 'guard', 'who', 'job', 'protecting', 'child', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'Mexico', 'young', 'girl', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'one', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'movie', 'Washington', 'best', 'protect', 'Fanning', 'becoming', 'unexpected', 'mentor', 'friend', 'way', 'story', 'touching', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'lapsed', 'great', 'ones', 'had', 'film', 'been', 'directed', 'someone', 'who', 'cared', 'outcome', 'not', 'quirky', 'artsy', 'movements', 'camera', 'instead', 'fire', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'contain', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'true', 'meaning', 'smoke', 'awkward', 'camera', 'angles', 'like', 'who-dun-its', 'one', 'little', 'mystery', 'culprit', 'obvious', 'first', 'few', 'scenes.I', 'found', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'director', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'done', 'excellent', 'movies', 'past', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'adapted', 'camera', 'styles', 'strange', 'moving', 'sub-titles', 'more', 'traditional', 'sequence', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'distracted', 'darkness', 'movement', 'film', 'when', 'reality', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'Scott', 'never', 'allowed', 'Washington', 'mystery', 'character', 'reveal', 'instance', 'camera', 'severe', 'scarring', 'hands', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'viewer', 'never', 'out', 'where', 'came', 'why', 'scars', 'were', 'sometimes', 'important', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'lost', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'felt', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'had', 'Scott', 'allowed', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'experiencing', 'good', 'film', 'action', 'junkies', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'substance', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'wondering', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'reaching', 'aspirin', 'correct', 'overactive', 'camera', 'damage', 'eyes']",N/A

Red,"[2, 6]","When told that the Bible (a book the hero of this film reads often) counsels forgiveness, John Creasy replies blandly (something like), ""Forgiveness: That's between a man and his maker; it's my job to arrange the meeting."" A great line, but it points to what disturbs me about this film: its glorification of justice meted out by one man operating outside the law. First the film sentiimentalizes the character of Creasy; then just as we come to like him, we watch him brutally torture one character after another (in ways that really do not bear repeating here). Is this the moral center of this film?Adding to the film's ethical confusion is the overly stylized cinematography, making it feel at times like a violent videogame and distancing the viewer further from the film's savagery. It's true that it's mesmerizing -- and that both Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning are well cast and excellent in two demanding parts. But to the extent that the film draws us into its anarchic world, it becomes increasingly problematic. The violence here really feels quite corrupting, and the film's mawkishness (Creasy's obsession with the innocence of the small girl whose death he believes he is revenging) illuminates the link between violence and sentimentality.

Both Dakota Fanning and Christopher Walken do kind of steal the movie away from the other performers with their wonderful acting,not to mention their interaction with Denzel Washington.  Still, it is the relationship between Pita (Fanning) and Creasy (Washington)that ultimately carries the movie.  I'm not ashamed to admit that tears flowed when Creasy is shot several times and Pita runs back to help him, only to be taken hostage by the kidnappers.  The ending is also a real tearjerker, but I'm not going to give it away.  If you're an old softy like me, then be sure to have plenty of tissues at your side.  Having watched the movie so many times, however, I'm beginning to wonder if maybe Radha Mitchell's character (Pita's mother)was coming onto Creasy just a little bit before the kidnapping actually takes place in the movie?

626033,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JN0W,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","At the heart of Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire"" is Creasy (Denzel Washington) a tortured  alcoholic and emotionally scarred former Marine and CIA agent who's haunted by his past. Creasy finds work guarding nine-year-old Pita (Dakota Fanning) of  rich Mexican industrialist Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his American-born wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) at the recommendation of one of his old collegues (Christopher Walken). With so many family members ""disappeared"" south of the border and a major deal pending to manufacture cars, there's concern that Pita might be a target of kidnappers. Creasy expresses no interest in bonding with the girl because it reminds him to much of an incident from his past but Pita breaks through Creasy's hardened exterior reminding him of his humanity.  When Pita is taken, the wounded Creasy makes it his business to find her before she's killed.This is the second time ""Man on Fire"" has been adapted for the big screen. The first adaptation in 1987 featuring Scott Glenn, Jonathan Pryce, Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams and Jade Malle and directed by Elie Chouraqui disappeared without a trace when it was released. Since Tony Scott was originally on tap to direct the 1987 version, he looked to the past when looking for his next project after the well received ""Spy Game"". With Marlon Brando completely out of the picture for the role (he was considered for Scott's planned version in 1987), Bruce Willis, Will Smith and Robert De Niro all taking passes on the role, Denzel Washington stepped into the role after a chance meeting with director Scott. Washington plays the role to perfection. His Creasy although a burned out husk of a man, has just enough spark of humanity left so that he can be touched by Pita. Fanning once again gives an incandescent performance and the other members of the supporting cast including Radha Mitchell (""Pitch Black""), singer Marc Anthony, Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke all give marvelously detailed performances. Although Scott becomes a bit obsessed with technique over story once the abduction occurs, his showy directorial style doesn't overwhelm the strong emotional material at the core of the story. Although it runs about 20 minutes too long, ""Man on Fire"" is a perfect action thriller and compliments Scott's best work (""Crimson Tide"", ""The Hunger"", ""True Romance"") avoiding the cliches of his hack work (""Beverly Hills Cop II"", ""Top Gun"", ""The Last Boy Scout"").Another top notch transfer from Fox, ""Man on Fire"" looks very good on DVD with most of its disc space devoted to the feature itself. The grainy look of the film, unusual textures and the muted colors that represent Creasy's emotional state are all captured remarkably well. The explosive 5.1 sound mix also grabs your attention. Scott and his sound mixer do a stellar job at reproducing the atmosphere of Mexico City in the detailed surround mix. There's a considerable amount of texture and detail that's well reproduced for the DVD.When it comes to extras ""Man on Fire"" runs cold. We only get a Fox advertisement ""Inside Look"" that gives us a glimpse at the trailer for the forthcoming thriller ""Hide and Seek"" and a brief behind-the-scenes promo for ""Taxi"".We get two wonderful commentary tracks. The first features director Tony Scott solo discussing what attracted him to the story in the first place both in 1986 and in 2002 when he chose to direct screenwriter Brian Helgeland's (""Mystic River"", ""L.A. Confidential"", ""The Order"" and ""A Knight's Tale""). Writer Helgeland, producer Foster (""Walking Tall"", ""Crimson Tide"") and actress Fanning all vie for your attention on a second audio commentary track. All three discuss Scott's edgy direction, the performances and the changes the script when through from inception to production. Surprisingly, Fanning more than holds her own with these two seasoned veterans. Hearing these three discuss Scott's approach to the film and their candid assessment of what works and doesn't is also a highlight.A taunt, well directed thriller ""Man on Fire"" provides Denzel Washington to investigate the haunted world of Creasy. Filled with a number of marvelous performances, edgy direction and a well written script, ""Man on Fire"" received an undeserved critical drubbing by many critics (probably because of Scott's association with the project).

But this is a movie review, not a Denzel review, so back to the movie.This movie is one of the best action/thriller/drama films that I've ever seen. It is also one of the most emotional movies I've ever seen, probably in my top ten.  The story brings you in and you truly feel for each individual character.  Dakota Fanning probably has her best performance so far in this movie.  She is a great choice to play Pita, and the connection between her and Creasy seems absolutely real.This connection is what makes the film work so well.  When Pita is kidnapped, Creasy, as well as the audience, feels crushed. This is when the movie begins to earn its R-rating, though. Up until this moment, there had been no violence and there were MAYBE two curses.  Creasy goes on a path of revenge, killing everyone involved in this kidnapping.  He, at this point, believes Pita is dead.  When he finds out she's alive, he is even more ambitious.The action scenes in this movie are great.  They are definitely Tony Scott's.  You can tell by the non-stop flashing and multiple pictures/frames on the screen.  This is the only part in the movie where I would mark it down, but it isn't that bad.  It's just that in some scenes it's flashing so fast and it doesn't stop.  I got a headache for a few minutes.  But besides that, this movie delivers with a powerful punch. It really isn't too graphic of a movie. For example, when he is cutting off the fingers of one man, all you see is him putting the knife up to his fingers, and the rest is assumed (although later you can briefly see his 'nubs).To wrap up, I again say that this movie is amazing.  Every single character in the movie does simply great.  Each one makes you feel some kind of emotion for them, especially Creasy, obviously.  This is probably, in my opinion, Tony Scott's best film.  I don't think any of his others were close to this.

If only it kept the promise of the early passages, which showcase fine performances by Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning.The setting is Mexico City, where, we're told, ""a kidnapping occurs every 60 minutes and only 70% of the hostages survive."" Ex-CIA operative John Creasy (Washington) is hired by a Mexican industrialist (Marc Anthony) and his American wife (Radha Mitchell) to serve as a bodyguard for their nine-year-old daughter, Pita (Fanning). Tormented by his past, Creasy is initially standoffish towards the young girl, but she manages to spark his long-dormant humanity, and in many ways he becomes a surrogate parent. When Pita is kidnapped, Creasy goes berserk, vowing revenge on everyone connected with the abduction.Washington and Fanning are shown to best advantage during the first third of the film, as their characters are fleshed out and create a credible bond. Then, once she's kidnapped, it's as though we're thrust into another movie; in fact, it plays like DEATH WISH 6, with Washington filling in for Charles Bronson. The mood turns ugly quick, as Creasy tracks down the culprits and sadistically tortures them to extract information. Putting a child in harm's way is just about the cheapest kind of theatrics there is, yet MAN ON FIRE milks it for all its worth. To his credit, Denzel Washington delivers a strong, sincere performance, but the script is riddled with so many loopholes and inconsistencies that even Rob Schneider would have demanded a rewrite. The film is also overloaded with supporting characters, many of them superfluous to the main plot. Regardless, Christopher Walken is always a welcome presence and his role here (as a former associate of Creasy) may be the closest thing to a normal human being that the actor has ever played.After forcing us to sit through this 142-minute diatribe on what a hellhole Mexico City is, the filmmakers have the nerve to end the picture with a thanks to ""Mexico City, a Very Special Place.""

626043,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JN0W,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","In Hollywood, ""redemption"" is a character arc that plays very well in the cinemas.  One would be hard-pressed to create a more intense, emotional story of redemption than what can be found in ""Man on Fire"".For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on the character of Creasy (Denzel Washington), an alcoholic with a troubled, violent past.  After visiting old buddy Rayburn (Christopher Walken), Creasy gets hooked up as a bodyguard for a family in Mexico City.  While at first quite distant, Creasy eventually lets down his stern persona for a bit and forms a relationship with the little girl he is supposed to be protecting, Pita (Dakota Fanning).If you have seen the movie ""Taken"", then you already have a rough idea of how the plotline goes.  Yet, under the direction of Tony Scott, ""Man On Fire"" is actually a better, more intense/emotional film due to its gritty undertones.  This is a movie that does not pull any punches, so to speak, when it comes to portraying the kidnappings that so often occur in the big cities of Mexico.  It is just a very emotional topic and is nailed so perfectly by Scott.Of course, the hallmark of this film is its acting from Washington and Fanning.  I would argue that Denzel gives his greatest performance EVER, while Fanning (as usual) shows acting talent light-years beyond her age.  The way those two characters interact with each other truly carry the emotional burden of the movie and provide the reason to ""care"" about what is going on.  Plus, in typical fashion, the fiery side of Washington's acting persona is able to be revealed on more than one occasion.Thus, I consider ""Man on Fire"" to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is equal parts intense and emotional, and great acting performances abound.  It is still difficult for me to believe that this flick was not nominated for any major awards (perhaps the graphic violence had something to do with it), because it would have been very much deserved in the acting, direction, and adapted screenplay categories.",5,A Story Of Redemption,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,2028,"['Hollywood', 'redemption', 'character', 'arc', 'very', 'well', 'cinemas', 'One', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'create', 'more', 'intense', 'emotional', 'story', 'redemption', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Man', 'Fire', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'character', 'Creasy', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'alcoholic', 'troubled', 'violent', 'past', 'visiting', 'old', 'buddy', 'Rayburn', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Creasy', 'hooked', 'up', 'bodyguard', 'family', 'Mexico', 'City', 'first', 'quite', 'distant', 'Creasy', 'eventually', 'down', 'stern', 'persona', 'bit', 'relationship', 'little', 'girl', 'supposed', 'be', 'protecting', 'Pita', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', '.If', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Taken', 'then', 'already', 'have', 'rough', 'idea', 'how', 'plotline', 'direction', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Man', 'Fire', 'actually', 'better', 'more', 'intense/emotional', 'film', 'due', 'gritty', 'undertones', 'movie', 'not', 'pull', 'punches', 'so', 'speak', 'when', 'portraying', 'kidnappings', 'so', 'often', 'occur', 'big', 'cities', 'Mexico', 'just', 'very', 'emotional', 'topic', 'nailed', 'so', 'perfectly', 'Scott.Of', 'course', 'hallmark', 'film', 'acting', 'Washington', 'Fanning', 'would', 'argue', 'Denzel', 'greatest', 'performance', 'EVER', 'Fanning', 'usual', 'acting', 'talent', 'light-years', 'age', 'way', 'two', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'truly', 'carry', 'emotional', 'burden', 'movie', 'provide', 'reason', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'typical', 'fashion', 'fiery', 'side', 'Washington', 'acting', 'persona', 'able', 'be', 'revealed', 'more', 'one', 'occasion.Thus', 'consider', 'Man', 'Fire', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'equal', 'parts', 'intense', 'emotional', 'great', 'acting', 'performances', 'abound', 'still', 'difficult', 'believe', 'flick', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'major', 'awards', 'perhaps', 'graphic', 'violence', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'much', 'deserved', 'acting', 'direction', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'categories']",N/A

GREAT, AWESOME movie. you will all be happy you did...September 14th cant come soon enough.....5 stars isnt a good enough rating for this movie but its all i can give itGO SEE THIS",5,Absolute Masterpiece,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,621,"['movie', 'far', 'once', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'One', 'guy', 'made', 'comment', 'Denzel', 'didnt', 'have', 'character', 'was', 'believeable', 'couldnt', 'be', 'anymore', 'further', 'truth', 'movie', 'great', 'opening', 'credit', 'closing', 'credits', 'Denzel', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'only', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'also', 'Anybody', 'hasnt', 'seen', 'movie', 'really', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'GREAT', 'AWESOME', 'movie', 'will', 'all', 'be', 'happy', 'did', 'September', '14th', 'cant', 'come', 'soon', 'enough', '..5', 'stars', 'isnt', 'good', 'enough', 'rating', 'movie', 'i', 'can', 'give', 'itGO', 'SEE', 'THIS']",N/A
