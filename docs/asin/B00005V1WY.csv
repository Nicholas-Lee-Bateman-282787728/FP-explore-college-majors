686731,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005V1WY,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[29, 29]","One always wonders what might have happened to both Barabbas and Pontius Pilate, and this is a fanciful tale about the fate of the man who was chosen to live, based on the novel by Par Lagerkvist (winner of a Nobel prize for Literature in 1951).The scourging and crucifixion are shown, but mostly, Jesus is seen through His followers, and the faith that endures in them throughout the film. A solar eclipse apparently happened during the filming, and it is the backdrop for the darkened sky at the crucifixion, used to great effect.Anthony Quinn is perfect as Barabbas, and heads a fine international cast, with Silvana Mangano as his former girlfriend who has become a follower of Jesus, Arthur Kennedy as Pontius Pilate, Harry Andrews as Peter, Valentina Cortese as the wife of a high-ranking Roman, Ernest Borgnine as a Christian in Rome, and Katy Jurado (at the time Mrs. Borgnine) as one of the raunchy women in Barabbas' Jerusalem gang.Two of the best performances come from Jack Palance as a sadistic gladiator, and especially, Vittorio Gassman as a young Christian who shares the latter part of Barabbas' life.Richard Fleischer keeps the pacing so that the dark nature of the story doesn't get too gloomy, and the film is also helped by Mario Nascimbene's score, and Aldo Tonti's Technicolor cinematography.The script has some inspirational touches, and the scenes I found fascinating were the ones in the ""school of gladiators"", where the physical feats are astounding, and the arena itself, especially at the conclusion when Jack Palance makes his entrance in a chariot.Interesting as both an historical supposition, and an interpretation of that era of Roman rule, as well as for its excellent acting, this is probably the grimmest of the big sword and sandal religious epics of its era, but well worth watching.

686736,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B00005V1WY,C McGhee,"[4, 4]","Hollywood excelled at this in earlier days. They start with a passage of scripture about the man, a murderer, which was released at the request of a crowd. His release sent Jesus to the cross to die for mankind's sin. The Bible leaves you there which becomes the start of this movie & high drama.Starring Anthony Quinn, Silvana Mangano (I always admire her & Irene Papas work), Arthur Kennedy, Katy Jurado, Harry Andrews, Ernest Borgnine & Jack Palance in a role he was born to play. Quinn as Barabbas is perfect as a filthy, crude & violent Jew. His life dedicated to the destruction of Romans it is strange that he has been chosen as the recipient of Roman mercy. Having been condemned to die & then freed he cannot be sentenced to death again. ""You cannot kill me."" as Barabbas screams. This becomes the foundation of our plot as he moves from one confrontation with the Christians to another with the Romans & then on as Rome seeks a solution to the problem they set free.What is interesting here is that the story really revolves around Barabbas' fight to understand why he is free while someone whose name is starting to spread across his world was condemned in his place. He wants to know more. Was the man evil? Did he hurt people too? Why does everyone seem to know this man died while he Barabbas lived? Is Barabbas cursed? Remember Zorba the Greek? Quinn is an actor that shows his passions well. That was needed here.Don't get me or the movie wrong. This is a great Sword & Sandal show. I always think of Spartacus when this movie comes up. It's the gladiatorial schools & that's where you find Jack Palance as the Top Dog gladiator. Who could play it better? I would go without supper to see him in that role. You should too. Not since 1954's The Silver Chalice has Palance got the chance to play a maniacal antagonist this crazy. Those two roles cemented him as my favorite insane character actor. These are the best Gladiatorial Arena scenes you'll find.An interesting look at what was available to Rome to punish a criminal it had to let live. This is all well done & the movie should be on your to watch list. It is not historical. This is Hollywood. Its only a movie but its a great one. By the way, Horseback was the world land speed record during the period of this movie. The show won't have computer graphics & the scenes won't change 3 times in 10 seconds. If you need those things don't watch this one.

So much for the good news. Unfortunately, Barabbas hasn't been granted the same deluxe treatment of other equally deserving epics of the 50's and 60's. I mean going to huge epic movies back then was quite an experience not unlike going to the Opera and you got treated to an introductory musical Overture, an Intermission with Entre'act music and sometimes even Exit music. In line with this treatment for other epics (now restored on Laser Disc/DVD versions), Barabbas was no exception. It originally included a Bolero-like overture of Mario Nascimbene's main theme, an Intermission at the end of the Mines sequence (you can see the abrupt cut into the next scene at the fields where the intermission has been deleted from the all versions of the movie currently available), and an Intermezzo (on the theme for the arrival to Rome)previous to the continuation of the second part of the movie. Until Mario Nascimbene's innovative score is restored, we should still wait for a definitive restored version of Barabbas. The Circus scenes are probably the best ever filmed, and are up there with similar sequences of Ben-Hur and Gladiator. (Spartacus is a great movie but does not include Circus action).

I became excited several months ago when I saw this edition was to be relased on DVD. So here I am on March 5th ordering my copy. I own the VHS version which distracts from the excellent photogarphy.  There are some important things to know about the production of this film: the crucifixion sequece was filmed during an actual eclipse, a one shot scene. The sets were constructed three dimnesional so the streets of Jerusalem and Rome appear real.  Anthony Quinn was a perfect choice for Barabbas. If you've read the book this film will provide a quality visual to the fine, simple telling of a man's life, the man who was spared crucifixion and free'd instead of our Lord.  Also if you've read the book you'll know what Barabbas is thinking most of the time.  Quinn is excellent, his eyes ever roaming in thought of survival. This is a big movie shot in a down to earth realistic way.  A fine study in seeking truth, arriving on it's doorstep only to turn away.  Because of the book, when Baabbas is helping set fire to Rome, I am aware of how truly emotional this last scene in the film is. (I hope am not giving anything way in the film). Barabbas finally makes an open commitment, acting out on a belief system that he's denied since Christ's crucifixion, only to discover in the end it was Nero who set fire to Rome and not the Christians.  It's really all there.  The muscal score is unsual and unique.  I have the old mono 33 1/2 rpm version which gives musical examples at the end of how Mario Nascimbene wrote and orchastrated the incedibe score.  Sadly enough this old recording is far supeior to the new CD issue which edited cuts and left out the 5 minute + prologue. I rate this movie 5 stars.

686747,A1BATHNY2QAZI2,B00005V1WY,"Jaime Contreras ""donjaime""","[0, 0]","This Italian-made biblical drama differs from most in that it takes a darker view.  The movie is visceral, violent and melodramatic in its treatment of the life of Jesus Barabbas, the jewish zealot who was freed in exchange for Jesus of nazareth.  International star, Anthony Quinn mumbles and fumbles his way through this emotion heavy film. Quinn grows into the role as the movie progresses. Interestingly, he wears a pant-like outfit during the first half of  the movie and then switches to a tunic outfit. Throughout the movie, Barabbas' character interacts with several early-Christians: a former prostitute-turned-Christian Rachel (Silvana Mangano)l; Simon Peter (Harry Andrews), the apostle who denied Jesus; Lazarus (Michael Gwynn) who was raise from the dead; Sahak (Vittorio Gassman), a former sailor-now-slave in the sulfur mines; and  Lucius (Ernest Borgnine), a Christian servant in the gladiator school.  We see barabbas go from a prisoner, freed slovenly thief, a slave in the sulfur mines of Sicily, a gladiator, a freed man, and a Christian.  His journey covers almost 30 years and we see him struggle to understand his purpose in life and the Christian faith. The character also sees the underbelly of Jerusalem society in Sara, the tavern owner and his lover (Katy Jurado); Rufio, an ambitious senator (Norman Wooland); Scorpio, a traitor (Guido Solano); Torvald, a ruthless gladiator (Jack Palance); Emperor Nero (Ivan Triessault) and many others. In time, Barabbas overcomes his confusion, tormented mind and heart and accepts that jesus' sacrifice on the cross was for him and all sinners.The movie is masterfully directed by Richard Fleischer and includes strong dramatic scenes like the cruxifiction of Jesus, the stoning of Rachel, the sulfur mine collapse, the gladiator fight scenes and the burning of Rome. First, an extended sequence between Palance and Quinn fighting in the coliseum. There is no dialogue, just brutal violence and action. The film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis is evident in the sets, photography, close-ups and use of foreboding music. The dramatic score is composed and conducted by Mario Nascimbene.I would recommend this movie to people who like the dramatic and emotionally charged epic.",4,The journey of a violent man to Christian,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,2240,"['Italian-made', 'biblical', 'drama', 'differs', 'most', 'darker', 'view', 'movie', 'visceral', 'violent', 'melodramatic', 'treatment', 'life', 'Jesus', 'Barabbas', 'jewish', 'zealot', 'who', 'was', 'freed', 'exchange', 'Jesus', 'nazareth', 'International', 'star', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'mumbles', 'fumbles', 'way', 'emotion', 'heavy', 'film', 'Quinn', 'role', 'movie', 'Interestingly', 'pant-like', 'outfit', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'then', 'switches', 'tunic', 'outfit', 'movie', 'Barabbas', 'character', 'interacts', 'several', 'early-Christians', 'former', 'prostitute-turned-Christian', 'Rachel', 'Silvana', 'Mangano', 'l', 'Simon', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'apostle', 'who', 'denied', 'Jesus', 'Lazarus', 'Michael', 'Gwynn', 'who', 'was', 'raise', 'dead', 'Sahak', 'Vittorio', 'Gassman', 'former', 'sailor-now-slave', 'sulfur', 'mines', 'Lucius', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Christian', 'servant', 'gladiator', 'school', 'see', 'barabbas', 'go', 'prisoner', 'freed', 'slovenly', 'thief', 'slave', 'sulfur', 'mines', 'Sicily', 'gladiator', 'freed', 'man', 'Christian', 'journey', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'see', 'struggle', 'understand', 'purpose', 'life', 'Christian', 'faith', 'character', 'also', 'underbelly', 'Jerusalem', 'society', 'Sara', 'tavern', 'owner', 'lover', 'Katy', 'Jurado', 'Rufio', 'ambitious', 'senator', 'Norman', 'Wooland', 'Scorpio', 'traitor', 'Guido', 'Solano', 'Torvald', 'ruthless', 'gladiator', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Emperor', 'Nero', 'Ivan', 'Triessault', 'many', 'others', 'time', 'Barabbas', 'confusion', 'tormented', 'mind', 'heart', 'accepts', 'jesus', 'sacrifice', 'cross', 'was', 'sinners.The', 'movie', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Fleischer', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'cruxifiction', 'Jesus', 'stoning', 'Rachel', 'sulfur', 'mine', 'collapse', 'gladiator', 'fight', 'scenes', 'burning', 'Rome', 'First', 'extended', 'sequence', 'Palance', 'Quinn', 'fighting', 'coliseum', 'dialogue', 'just', 'brutal', 'violence', 'action', 'film', 'producer', 'Dino', 'DeLaurentiis', 'evident', 'sets', 'photography', 'close-ups', 'use', 'foreboding', 'music', 'dramatic', 'score', 'composed', 'conducted', 'Mario', 'Nascimbene.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'dramatic', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'epic']",N/A

686751,A2EERM752BMSQD,B00005V1WY,just some guy,"[7, 7]","I've seen just about all of the Biblical epics, but this one has always been my favorite because of the deeper character development. Except for the beginning of the movie, where Barabbas has been released instead of Jesus, the story is completely speculative. But the journey the story takes is quite moving and unpredictable and thought-provoking. It's probably the only older Biblical movie that actually touches upon the struggle for faith in Christ and the consequences of advertising that faith in a society that outlaws it. Barabbas is a man in anguish, full of guilt and indecision, but tries hard to repress his emotions and his humanity when he's imprisoned and enslaved in a mine for many years. When he's partnered later with another slave, this time a devout Christian, Barabbas resents and then envies this other man's joy in the face of hardship. Is life nothing but hard work and then death, with nothing to look forward to? Nothing to sustain you? Just a bleak end? It's the sort of questions Barabbas faces, even when trying to remain detached. He's a simple man throughout the movie, almost stupid and barbaric, but you can see that deep down he's trying to be a good man. Trying! So, compared to other Biblical movies, this one really touches upon what it means to be human, what it means to have faith, rather than dealing with cardboard cutout characters and flashy special effects. Not to say that the movie is lacking spectacle. The sets are wonderful and massive, and the gladiator fights are huge and violent. As you watch the crowds moving and cheering in the background, you can't help but think: Everyone is real back there. No CGI, no computer manufactured people. It's amazing how they were able to make such large sets and fill them with so many people.As for the DVD itself, it's beautifully transfered and in its original widescreen aspect ratio. Very sharp and clear, one of the best looking DVDs I own. No special features, which is only a slight disappointment. After all, this has been a favorite movie of mine for years, so I was cautiously celebrating when I haerd the DVD was going to be released. &quot;Cautiously&quot; only because I worried they might cut corners and release a cheap looking DVD. But I was pleasantly surprised that it looks better than I expected.Bottom line: If you want depth with your spectacle, this is the best choice. And the DVD quality is superb!

No, this is quite different, a film dealing with human doubt and brutality as well as Christian hope.  The plot is dark throughout which honestly seems to add more realism to the film.  The acting is good and many scenes are memorable such as Christ's crucifixion (partly filmed during a real solar eclipse), the stoning scene, the first gladiator fight, and the Great Fire of 64 A.D.  Perhaps the most haunting visual shot is the forrest of crosses near the picture's conclusion.Quinn does a good job at protraying the protagonist, one unusual because of his dark nature.  The last lines Barabbas speaks are somewhat ambigous and can be interpred in different ways.  Palance gives a sinister performance as a sadistic gladiator that ranks right up there with his performance as hired killer Jack Wilson in ""Shane.""Overall, I enjoyed the picture.  There are some historical inaccuracies such as the way Roman helments are depicted and the fact the Flavian Ampitheatre hadn't been constructed yet (neither flaw takes much from the film).

The film is not the polished Hollywood style one finds in 'Ben Hur' or 'The Ten Commandments' but is supported by a strong script and decent acting by Anthony Quinn in the main role, as well as Jack Palance and Ernest Borgnine in secondary roles.The story operates on the postulation of what Barabbas' life would have been like if he felt guilt or doubts in his being freed over Jesus.  The story follows his life from his liberation to his returning to a life of crime.  Arrested again, he's informed that he can't be killed or it would violate Jewish law that no man freed on a holy festival can be put to death.  Barabbas is instead made a slave and sent to the sulphur mines and later trained as a gladiator.  Throughout his odyssey, Barabbas encounters many Christians such as Peter and Lazarus who add to his doubts as to who the true Saviour is in life as in death.The film presents the emotions of a tormented conscience well; Quinn's performance is great in showing Barrabas' doubts, sense of guilt, and desire for some divine absolution.  The film tries to bring realism to its scenes as opposed to the excessively stylized ones prevalent in biblical films of the 1950s such as 'The Ten Commandments', 'Ben Hur', and 'The Robe.'  The script is quite good and many aspects of the film are rather faithful as to Roman culture: particularly the scenes in the mines and those involving the gladiators.  It has some good gladiatorial scenes too which are second only to Spartacus which was released the year before.  One of the downsides is that many aspects of Roman customs and dress are completely off.  Roman legionaires are dressed in Hellenic helmets carrying circular shields and spears which is completely incorrect for Imperial Rome.  A Roman noble would never wear brown clothing or the rags shown in the film.  Also, the actor playing Nero was too old as he seemed much older than 30 whereas Nero died at that age.Despite its limitations, this is one of the better films from the 50s and 60s which offers something for everyone whether they are religious or not.

686767,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00005V1WY,Robin Simmons,"[6, 6]","The late Anthony Quinn delivers a powerful, understated performance as the title character in ""BARABBAS.""  Released on DVD with no fanfare, perhaps because of the overtly Christian theme, this sharp-looking widescreen transfer does justice to an overlooked epic that came on the heels of ""Ben Hur,"" a much bigger budgeted production that also dealt with a provocative spiritual story (a hate-filled Jew on the road to revenge stumbles across the Christ).Based on Nobel Prize winner Par Lagervist's acclaimed novel, the story is a fictional look at the real historical figure who was released when the angry, blood thirsty Jerusalem mob responds to Pilate's offer to free either Barabbas or Jesus.The metaphor of Jesus dying for all is made real in the life of the one literal man He replaced on the cross.  A daring idea that becomes fully realized in Christopher (""Ben Hur"") Fry's thoughtful screenplay as directed by Richard Fleischer.In many ways, this material was rehashed in ""Gladiator"" but without the Christian motif (the hints of Christians dying in the arena by Rome's edict were filmed for ""Gladiator"" but left on the cutting room floor).Quinn's Barabbas is a troubled brute who is haunted by his undeserved gift of life and freedom and especially the resulting notoriety.  His journey of faith and the discovery of his own worth is arguably as profound and poetic as his great Zorba interpretation.The arena scenes with a gleefully sadistic Jack Palance are as good as anything in ""Gladiator.""

686771,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B00005V1WY,Simon Davis,"[6, 6]","In among the glut of biblical epics from the late 1950's and early 1960's the Dino De Laurentiis production of ""Barabbas"", is undoubtedly one of the least well known of this particular genre that proved so popular at this time. Indeed it can be assumed that it basically got lost in among all the hype surrounding such super productions of the same period as ""Ben Hur"", and ""Cleopatra"". ""Barabbas"", enjoyed regular screenings during the Easter period while I was growing up but what always struck me about this particular epic was the very unique and darker slant it took on its religious storytelling compared to such films as ""The Robe"" etc. History and the bible in fact gives little information about the thief and con man Barabbas who was spared crucifixtion in place of Jesus Christ however writer Christopher Fry has weaved a fascinating fictional story full of intelligent dialogue and believable characters in his telling of the life of Barabbas in the years after he was spared execution on the cross by the last minute replacement of Jesus. Not your typically pious or colourful religious epic ""Barabbas"", takes a very non sentimental slant in its storytelling that makes it a standout among the other similiar efforts of this golden period of the biblical film.The fictional story created around the real-life Barabbas begins with the well known New Testament story of Pontious Pilate asking the mob who they wish to see executed; the loutish thief and murderer Barabbas, or a young Nazarene called Jesus who it is claimed is spreading rebellion among the cities residents. The crowd calls for the crucifixion of Jesus and so Barabbas is set free. He witnesses the quiet dignity of Jesus dying on the cross on Calvary however he soon goes back to his old drunken and debauched ways. Barabbas soon discovers the wide following that Jesus had when his former love Rachel is revealed as one of his followers and is stoned by the local authorities. He however still refuses to mend his ways and returns to his thieving however he is arrested again when he and his band of murderers attack a group of Jewish Clerics and he is sentenced to a lifetime of servittude in the ghastly sulfur mines which is a death sentence in itself. Many years pass and Barabbas finds himself shackled with a young upright christian by the name of Sahak (Vittorio Gassman), who he first despises but then grows to admire. After a serious cave at the mine the two men are conscripted for land clearing duties together where they catch the eye of the wife of a Roman Senator and the two become her good luck charms and are taken to Rome to be trained as Gladiators. Barabbas runs  a foul of the gladiator school's resident champion Torvald (Jack Palance), and after Sahak is executed for his beliefs by Torvald's own hands Barabbas swears to revenge his friend and gets his opportunity when he comes face to face with his old nemesis during the games before the Emperor in the arena. Barabbas out smarts Torvald in their deadly competition and manages to kill him and he is rewarded with his freedom however when he retrieves Sahak's hastily buried body and takes it to the catacombs for a decent christian burial he is rejected by the other followers who do not believe in his sincerity and blame him for Sahak's death. Furious, Barabbas emerges from the catacombs just as the great fire of Rome begins to break out and the out cry is that the christians are responsible for it. In his rage he then assists in spreading the fire to other buildings and is arrested by the authorities who put him on trial. Accused of being responsible for the fire and for being a christian Barabbas is condemmed to death but in prison he again encounters the calming presenses of Peter (Harry Andrews) who sets him on his course of inner peace and salvation. This in turn gives him the strength to endure the eventual crucifixion he now faces which he avoided all those years earlier when Jesus took his place on the cross.Playing the title role of the drunken thief who only finds salvation at his own crucifixion years after he escaped death in place of Jesus, Anthony Quinn has the perfect role as Barabbas and makes the most of creating a realistic character who has been a rogue and a con man all his life. He brings a starkly realistic persona to the title character, free of the usual biblical sentiment or pious regret for his life long misdeeds. It is a masterful piece of acting that should have received more attention from the critics of the time than it did. Quinn's large, rough physique, and deep gravely voice also seem perfect casting for the largely unlikeable character of Barabbas and help make him a memorable addition to 1960's historical characters (of course largely fictionalised here) on screen. While the film naturally focuses on the Barabbas character many of the supporting cast get to shine in their respective roles as well. The big standout for me was the usually bland Jack Palance as Torvald the champion gladiator who holds a grudge against Barabbas and the almost crazed playing by Palance especially in the scene depicting the two men's big show down in the arena where they must fight to the death is one of the film's absolute highlights. It was interesting how in this not traditional biblical epic that some of the casting also took a decidely non traditional turn in displaying some veteran performers in roles outside their usual ""type"". Ernest Borgnine as Lucius, the sympathetic worker at the gladiator school and Vittorio Gassman as the Christian Sahak who succeeds in changing Barabbas' life by sacrificing his own deliver most interesting work which is at variance with the types of characters these two gifted actors normally took on screen. Arthur Kennedy as Pontius Pilate, Harry Andrews as Peter, and  Katy Jurade as Rachel fill out fairly traditonal characters from the bible that nevertheless have important places in this story. Visually ""Barabbas"", is one of the more interesting epics from this period with superb cinematography courtesy of the gifted Aldo Tonti who creates vivid landscapes for the scenes in the grimy sulfur mines, and in the brutal games to the death in the arena. The two crucifixion scenes at both the beginning and end of the film are however his master work as he blends design and colour like old master paintings to great effect. The recreation of the period flavour around the period of Jesus' crucifixion by master art director Mario Chiari are also second to none and one of the strong points of ""Barabbas"", and his work doesn't shy away from depicting the squalor and deprivation of the cities and their inhabitants at this time.While I personally love all of the great epics produced in the 1950's and 60's, this particular film has a distinct feel to it that makes it a standout among your standard Hollywood epics. In a way I often feel ""Barabbas"", really makes a serious attempt to show the life and personalities of the time as they possibly were. Anthony Quinn was ideal for Barabbas, being not your typical Hollywood hero type like Richard Burton or Charlton Heston and that in itself really works for both the character and the whole mood of this piece of filmmaking. Not well known in the ""epic stable"", of cinema classics from this period ""Barabbas"", is well worth viewing for it's performances, and for it's gritty look at the truly harsh life existing in the time of Christ.

Anthony Quinn is very good and so are his co-stars.  The script drags somewhat, with the second part being more interesting than the first.  However, if you are wanting to look at this film in the sense of whether it portrays the message of Christianity well, then this movie is less than average.  It portrays early Christians well, but the problem is with the portrayal of Barabbas.  There is no complexity in the character of Barabbas, he simply ""goes with the flow.""  There is never true repentence on his part, never a true understanding of the meaning of Christ and Christianity.  It is simply not a film you would want to show your children if you want them to have a deeper understanding of their faith.  For great classical gladiatoral action, this is a great movie (Jack Palance is wonderful), but it fails in portraying any deeper spiritual message.",3,"Not bad, but not a great movie",1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,950,"['Barabbas', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'are', 'watching', 'simply', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'are', 'co-stars', 'script', 'somewhat', 'second', 'part', 'being', 'more', 'interesting', 'first', 'However', 'are', 'wanting', 'look', 'film', 'sense', 'message', 'Christianity', 'well', 'then', 'movie', 'less', 'average', 'early', 'Christians', 'well', 'problem', 'portrayal', 'Barabbas', 'complexity', 'character', 'Barabbas', 'simply', 'flow', 'never', 'true', 'repentence', 'part', 'never', 'true', 'understanding', 'meaning', 'Christ', 'Christianity', 'simply', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'want', 'show', 'children', 'want', 'have', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'faith', 'great', 'classical', 'gladiatoral', 'action', 'great', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'wonderful', 'portraying', 'deeper', 'spiritual', 'message']",N/A
686775,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005V1WY,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","""Barabbas"" is an Italian film released in 1961 and directed by Richard Fleischer (""The Vikings""). It's a sword & sandal epic that begins where more popular biblical epics leave off, like ""Ben-Hur,"" ""King of Kings"" and ""The Passion of the Christ.""THE STORY: Anthony Quinn plays the titular character, a murderous lout and insurrectionist condemned to die at the time of the trial of Christ. Barabbas' first name was Jesus, so Roman governor Pilate was essentially asking the crowd to choose between Jesus Barabbas and Jesus Christ, the guilty or the innocent, to be put to death or set free. They of course choose to condemn the innocent so Barabbas is set free. Throughout the rest of his life Barabbas is haunted by Christ's sacrifice and struggles with guilt over his unmerited salvation. His ex-girlfriend is stoned to death for her Christian beliefs, he spends twenty years as a slave in the notorious sulfur mines and then becomes a gladiator. His life is a constant struggle -- with himself, with others, with his beliefs, with his various predicaments and mostly with God Himself.No one knows what really happened to Barabbas after he was set free; this is a fictional account based on the novel by Par Larverkvist.WHAT WORKS: The picture was filmed entirely in Italy, including Sicily, and the locations & sets are great and very authentic-looking. The Colosseum scenes were filmed at real Italian amphitheaters, so these sequences have a genuine feel as opposed to the fake-looking CGI Colosseum scenes in ""Gladiator."" The stoning scene is heart-wrenching. This is the first and only film I've ever seen that; it shows what a real-life stoning was like, and it's not pretty.Silvana Mangano plays Barabbas' ex-girlfriend Rachel. Unfortunately her natural beauty is played down here. Be sure to catch Silvana in Kirk Douglas' ""Ulysses"" (1954) where she plays both Penelope and the witch/siren Circe. Silvana's beauty is absolutely captivating in ""Ulysses,"" which has more pizazz than the comparatively boring ""The Odyssey"" (1997).The sulfur mine sequences have a realistic feel. So much so it may occur to you that, no matter how bad you have it, at least you're not a slave in a sulfur mine.Jack Palance plays the lead gladiator. He lives for one purpose only: to entertain spectators by killing people in the arena. He thrives on the accolades he receives. What will happen when Barabbas faces him in a duel to the death? The gladiatorial scenes are pretty much on a par with similar scenes in ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" (although, of course, nothing can ever top the spectacular chariot race).Ernest Borgnine is also on hand in a small role. You can never go wrong with Borgnine.The score by Mario Nascimbene is solemn and potent.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The picture starts off slowly and doesn't really capture your full attention until the stoning sequence, which is a full 40 minutes into the story. In other words, be prepared to persevere for about 45 minutes or so. At the 50-minute mark the mine scenes start and the story finally becomes compelling (the film runs 2 hours and 17 minutes).FYI: The Almighty (apparently) provided an actual total solar eclipse February 15, 1961 to enhance the eerie scenes of darkness, which mysteriously fell across the land after Jesus' crucifixion. The score during this scene is simple, almost non-existent, but very ominous.FINAL ANALYSIS: ""Barabbas"" successfully depicts every man or woman's struggle with sin, guilt, redemption, suffering and the search for ultimate reality or truth. This is not a fun, adventurous or action-packed film, although there's some good action in the gladiatorial scenes. Barabbas' journey is torturous at best, but worthwhile if you're in the proper brooding mood for such a picture.COMPARISON: Although ""Barabbas"" isn't as great as other biblical epics like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""The Ten Commandments"" or sword & sandal epics like ""Troy,"" it's better than the melodramatic ""The Robe"" (a horrible film) and the ridiculously boring ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (how about ""The Boring-est Film Ever Made""?). It's roughly on par with films like ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""King of Kings"" and ""Spartacus,"" even though I give ""Samson"" and ""Spartacus"" the edge.GRADE: B-",4,"The struggle with sin, guilt, redemption, people, belief, suffering and God",1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,4232,"['Barabbas', 'Italian', 'film', 'released', '1961', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Fleischer', 'Vikings', 'sword', 'sandal', 'epic', 'where', 'more', 'popular', 'biblical', 'epics', 'leave', 'off', 'Ben-Hur', 'King', 'Kings', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'titular', 'character', 'murderous', 'lout', 'insurrectionist', 'condemned', 'die', 'time', 'trial', 'Christ', 'Barabbas', 'first', 'name', 'was', 'Jesus', 'so', 'Roman', 'governor', 'Pilate', 'was', 'essentially', 'asking', 'crowd', 'choose', 'Jesus', 'Barabbas', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'be', 'put', 'death', 'set', 'free', 'course', 'choose', 'condemn', 'innocent', 'so', 'Barabbas', 'set', 'free', 'rest', 'life', 'Barabbas', 'haunted', 'Christ', 'sacrifice', 'struggles', 'guilt', 'unmerited', 'salvation', 'ex-girlfriend', 'stoned', 'death', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'twenty', 'years', 'slave', 'notorious', 'sulfur', 'mines', 'then', 'gladiator', 'life', 'constant', 'struggle', 'others', 'beliefs', 'various', 'predicaments', 'mostly', 'God', 'Himself.No', 'one', 'really', 'happened', 'Barabbas', 'was', 'set', 'free', 'fictional', 'account', 'based', 'novel', 'Par', 'Larverkvist.WHAT', 'WORKS', 'picture', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'Italy', 'including', 'Sicily', 'locations', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'very', 'authentic-looking', 'Colosseum', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'real', 'Italian', 'amphitheaters', 'sequences', 'have', 'genuine', 'feel', 'opposed', 'fake-looking', 'CGI', 'Colosseum', 'scenes', 'Gladiator', 'stoning', 'scene', 'heart-wrenching', 'first', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'what', 'real-life', 'stoning', 'was', 'not', 'pretty.Silvana', 'Mangano', 'Barabbas', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'Unfortunately', 'natural', 'beauty', 'played', 'down', 'here', 'Be', 'sure', 'catch', 'Silvana', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Ulysses', '1954', 'where', 'Penelope', 'witch/siren', 'Circe', 'Silvana', 'beauty', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'Ulysses', 'more', 'pizazz', 'comparatively', 'boring', 'Odyssey', '1997', '.The', 'sulfur', 'mine', 'sequences', 'have', 'realistic', 'feel', 'So', 'much', 'may', 'occur', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'have', 'least', ""'re"", 'not', 'slave', 'sulfur', 'mine.Jack', 'Palance', 'lead', 'gladiator', 'one', 'purpose', 'only', 'entertain', 'spectators', 'killing', 'people', 'arena', 'accolades', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'Barabbas', 'duel', 'death', 'gladiatorial', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'similar', 'scenes', 'Spartacus', 'Ben-Hur', 'course', 'nothing', 'can', 'ever', 'top', 'spectacular', 'chariot', 'race', '.Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'also', 'hand', 'small', 'role', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'wrong', 'Borgnine.The', 'score', 'Mario', 'Nascimbene', 'solemn', 'potent.WHAT', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'picture', 'slowly', ""n't"", 'really', 'capture', 'full', 'attention', 'stoning', 'sequence', 'full', '40', 'minutes', 'story', 'other', 'words', 'be', 'prepared', 'persevere', 'about', '45', 'minutes', 'so', '50-minute', 'mark', 'mine', 'scenes', 'start', 'story', 'finally', 'compelling', 'film', '2', 'hours', '17', 'minutes', '.FYI', 'Almighty', 'apparently', 'provided', 'actual', 'total', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'February', '15', '1961', 'enhance', 'eerie', 'scenes', 'darkness', 'mysteriously', 'fell', 'land', 'Jesus', 'crucifixion', 'score', 'scene', 'simple', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'very', 'ominous.FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'Barabbas', 'successfully', 'man', 'woman', 'struggle', 'sin', 'guilt', 'redemption', 'suffering', 'search', 'ultimate', 'reality', 'truth', 'not', 'fun', 'adventurous', 'action-packed', 'film', 'good', 'action', 'gladiatorial', 'scenes', 'Barabbas', 'journey', 'torturous', 'best', ""'re"", 'proper', 'brooding', 'mood', 'picture.COMPARISON', 'Barabbas', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'other', 'biblical', 'epics', 'Ben-Hur', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'sword', 'sandal', 'epics', 'Troy', 'better', 'melodramatic', 'Robe', 'horrible', 'film', 'ridiculously', 'boring', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'how', 'Boring-est', 'Film', 'Ever', 'Made', 'roughly', 'par', 'films', 'Samson', 'Delilah', 'King', 'Kings', 'Spartacus', 'even', 'give', 'Samson', 'Spartacus', 'edge.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A
