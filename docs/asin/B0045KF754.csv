In very different ways, the series covers all of the real details. The subject of wars, why there's evil in the world, why good people have to suffer. It's all here. Also the best explanation of the Trinity I've ever come across. Amazingly well made, especially when you consider the budgets and intentional refrain from going Hollywood.

It is moreChristmas like, with trees, nativity at a church, but that is not to take awayfrom the The Perfect Stranger or Another Perfect Stranger.  The Perfect in all ofthe movies refers to The Perfect Jesus Christ.  Instead of Santa Clause appearingto certain individuals, Jesus does so, but in a honorable fashion.
