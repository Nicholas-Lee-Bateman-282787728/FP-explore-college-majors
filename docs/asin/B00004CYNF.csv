films may not be to your liking. some may even go as far as to call it a mess. i can say i am personally a big fan of surreal cinema, it is my favorite, & jodorowsky is quite possibly my favorite director. his style of filmmaking is unlike nor will ever be like anything else ever made. each of his films, including el topo aredirected in such a why to strike such blissful illusion into the viewer's imagination, its as if each frame is flow after flow of a dream.though there is barely a plot, one may say it is a very abstract ""western"".my personal version*spoilers* about a gunslinger dressed in black leather raoming a vast desert with his young, innocent son in tow on horseback. he comes across a village completely slaughtered & for no aparent reason, except out of rage, treks after & defeats the gang of wacked bandits at a franciscan monk mission where they are in the midst  committing the same act. after being tempted by the bandit leader's mistress, the gunslinger abandons his son with the monks & sets ride with the woman, who convinces him he must become the best world's best gunman.it seems that in order to become the world's best gunman, the gunslinger must travel all different parts of the world to find the four master gunmen & defeat all of them. through this journey, there is much abstract symbolic imagery shown. the gunslinger also finds himself in scenes where the fellow ""master"" gunmen share peaceful moments before their duel, where respectfully, he is enlightened by them in some way. near the beginning of this journey, he crosses paths with another woman, fellow gunslinger who seems to recognize the male gunslinger as having greater potential than her, and shadily requests she direct him to the next gunslinger, she ends up staying for the whole journey to find the four masters. eventually, though through sinister ways, the gunslinger defeats the four master gunmen, but instead of being grateful of his victory, instead he is disturbed & regretful & eventually falls to his knees in what seems to be a power he thought he wanted but does not. at this precise moment of weakness, woman gunslinger seduces the other woman into taking the gun & shooting the gunslinger, who appraoches the constant gunfire, as if making a martyr of himself. he is thought dead & the women ride off.now here's where the movie takes an even more outlandish turn. what seems an incredibly long time(at least between 15-25 years). the gunslinger awakens, in what seems to be an underground cave layer. for this time he has been taken care of & worshiped by a group of deformed subterainian cave people. they all revere him as a messiah/christ-like figure & upon his awakening, grant him the task of finding a way for them to escape the cave & find a safe home on the land where they coexist in harmony with the people above land.the messiah takes to this new way of life and seems to have a rebirth or sense of redemption, in which he really does become their leader of peace. accompanied by a dwarf maiden who had looked after him for years. he heads to the surface to find civilization. they surface & eventually come across a near town that is not very peaceful at all. in fact its like a western town (literally) from hell. townspeople follow a bizarre religious cult, as well as joyfully watch sadistic obstacle course games where they kill what appears to be slaves. the town seems to be riddled with sex, violence & disgrace. as the messiah & his maiden become street performers to raise money to help them, eventually they fall in love & want get married, but the monk who they want to marry them turns out to be the messiah's son & with rage beats on the man. after they explain about the cave people, he agrees to help only under the condition that he is allowed to kill his father afterwards.eventually they free the cave people but as they surface, the townspeople panic, pulling out arms, they massacre every last one of the cave people. enraged, the messiah/gunslinger grabs an automatic rifle & kills all of the villagers, & then (imitating the infamous monk who burnt himself in protest) sits on the ground, douses himself in oil & lights himself on fire, till he burns to ash. around the same time the dwarf maiden gives birth to the late gunslinger's 2nd child. after they give him & honorable burial, the gunslinger's son(now dressed just like his father was for the first part of the film), the handmaiden & her child, ride off out of town, ending the film .*end spoilers*now like i said before the film is not for everyone. it is a beautiful piece of surreal art & should be appreciated for that exact reason, amongst others. sure the film often doesnt make sense, but it really isnt supposed to.",5,there is nothing out there like this & its a masterpiece,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,4883,"['i', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'right', 'bat', 'are', 'more', 'linear', 'straightforward', 'filming',

Jodorowsky is another undisputed cinematic god & El Topo is his crowning work of art. For anyone not familiar with the man's work, here is a fantastic place to start. Trust me, there are not enough wonderful things to say about the film without totally spoiling the entire experience for you. Let's just say that there is nothing like it & probability suggests never will be.For those who like a straight-forward story with loads of action & gore, the first half of the film will most likely appeal to you. The first half is comparable to the new testament as both are full of excitement & should hold an audience's attention for the most part. Here we have just your basic shoot-em-up style atmosphere which is not heavy-handed nor ultr-philosophical. No, it's not John Wayne but it's still entertaining nonetheless.The second half of El Topo takes off in a completely different direction & will most likely loose a great deal of it's audience who enjoyed the first half. This is the old testament so to speak. The pacing is a bit slower, the ideas are more allegorical, & the story takes on a spiritual note if one can digest all the symbolism which is thrown at the viewer like french fries. El Topo's saving grace now may it's oddball characters which keep everything afloat like ice cream in a glass of coke.Easily the strangest spaghetti western ever made, El Topo was a pure pleasure for me to watch & I loved the soundtrack as well. I have read through the years that Jodorowsky was going to make a sequel but somehow I fail to see that ever surfacing.

547384,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00004CYNF,Carl Manes,"[1, 2]","The road to enlightenment is paved in blood in EL TOPO, the feature film that brought Alejandro Jodorowsky to the public for the first time and single-handedly started the ""midnight movie"" craze! In it, a mystical gunslinger enters the desert to confront the Four Masters, warriors of legend who hold the keys to personal enlightenment. After defeating each of them, he is betrayed by his followers and left to die in a small desert town. Years later, El Topo awakens as the prophet and savior to a group of misshapen inbreeds who have become trapped in a perilous cavern. He then begins a noble quest to tunnel his people out, not knowing that the outer world is not ready to accept them. EL TOPO is a postmodern religious allegory set in an ultra-violent Western setting that is sure to blow your mind! Jodorowsky stars as the mysterious lead, a chauvinistic New Age messiah clad in black that progresses through each new stage of personal understanding through the barrel of a gun. Like in each of his films to follow, Jodorowsky creates a surreal cinematic landscape that is not unlike the works of Salvador Dali. His symbolism and cynical humor can often be difficult to deconstruct, but they amount to a viewing experience unlike any other. Hailed by leaders in the counterculture movement such as John Lennon and Dennis Hopper, EL TOPO is an important piece of world cinema from one of Mexico's most profound directors.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,ILHM Reviews: El Topo,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1457,"['road', 'enlightenment', 'paved', 'blood', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'feature', 'film', 'brought', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'public', 'first', 'time', 'single-handedly', 'started', 'midnight', 'movie', 'craze', 'mystical', 'gunslinger', 'desert', 'confront', 'Four', 'Masters', 'warriors', 'legend', 'who', 'hold', 'keys', 'personal', 'enlightenment', 'defeating', 'betrayed', 'followers', 'left', 'die', 'small', 'desert', 'town', 'Years', 'later', 'El', 'Topo', 'prophet', 'savior', 'group', 'misshapen', 'inbreeds', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'trapped', 'perilous', 'cavern', 'then', 'noble', 'quest', 'tunnel', 'people', 'out', 'not', 'knowing', 'outer', 'world', 'not', 'ready', 'accept', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'postmodern', 'religious', 'allegory', 'set', 'ultra-violent', 'Western', 'setting', 'sure', 'blow', 'mind', 'Jodorowsky', 'mysterious', 'lead', 'chauvinistic', 'New', 'Age', 'messiah', 'clad', 'black', 'new', 'stage', 'personal', 'understanding', 'barrel', 'gun', 'films', 'follow', 'Jodorowsky', 'surreal', 'cinematic', 'landscape', 'not', 'works', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'symbolism', 'cynical', 'humor', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'difficult', 'deconstruct', 'amount', 'viewing', 'experience', 'other', 'Hailed', 'leaders', 'counterculture', 'movement', 'such', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'important', 'piece', 'world', 'cinema', 'one', 'Mexico', 'most', 'profound', 'directors.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",El Topo VHS
547385,AP1RICQOPPTQ1,B00004CYNF,C.,"[1, 1]","I first heard of Alejandro Jodorowsky after I read the book the &#34;Dune&#34; by Frank Herbert and saw the eventual film adaptation made by master surrealist filmmaker David Lynch. From watching that movie, I learned that some time before Lynch's adaptation was made, another filmmaker by the name of Alejandro Jodorowsky was set to adapt Herbert's story to film. Interested, I looked into the films of this Jodorowsky fellow and found out about &#34;El Topo,&#34; which was described as being like a &#34;Spaghetti Western.&#34; Already being an aficionado of the Spaghetti Western genre, I looked into &#34;El Topo&#34; to discover it's not in fact a 'true' Spaghetti Western, but what they call an &#34;Acid Western,&#34; which is a movie with Old West themes keeping the excesses and absurdities that is typical of a Spaghetti Western.That said, &#34;El Topo&#34; is a film unlike anything you've ever seen. It tells the tale of a wandering gunslinger who over the course of the first half of the movie fights four 'masters' and then finds himself in a cave of deformed people in the second act, where he becomes a monk who must help them make a tunnel from their cave to the adjacent town, which is full of religious nuts and sex fiends. That's all I really need to say about the movie, if you want to see it, you either will or won't. As for the release itself, I must say, it looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-Ray, it's hard to tell that it was forty three years ago. The use of colors and camerawork are brilliant, the acting is over the top, but in a good way. It's a film filled with absurd images and acts that make you wonder what exactly it all means, but there is an underlying message in the madness.

Many people point out that John and yoko were proponents of this film....but then again they could sit in bed for a week at a time.

This film has only been available in North America in bootleg form, and these bootlegs ran from from passable to abominable.  My personal copy was a VHS dub of a Japanese laserdisc, which had the film optically censored (you can't show pubic hair in Japan, but just about everything else), Japanese subtitles, and it was dubbed in English (it is supposed to be in Spanish).  Now we will get it as the great Alejandro meant it to be seen.  This film is really astounding at times, considering Jodorowsky was mainly known as a theater director, and he had only directed one previous feature (the little seen and frequently banned Fando y Lis).  His films have a truly hallucinatory quality that is magnificent to behold.  This was reportedly John and Yoko's favorite movie.  They recommended that Allen Klein pick up the rights to it, and he did.  Allen and Alejandro have been feuding for the last 30 years over this film and who owns the rights, but luckily, they've made peace (let's hope it stays that way).  El Topo, along with The Holy Mountain, are Jodorowsky's best films.  Many thanks to ABKCO films for finally releasing this masterpiece.Just to let you know, the above is a review of El Topo.

After he kills the Four Masters of the desert he can not avoid the feeling of desperation and he decides to kill himself . Eventually he will resurrect on a new person - the redemption - to rectify all the injustices in his previous existence .Obviously the film owns multiple angles and perspectives . It is a western but it is still more than that ; you may argue the Seven Samurais influence and to remind the four Apocalypse riders and conclude it is a religious picture ; wrong choice , you have to find the roots in the heart of the mythology and redefinite the real meaning of the Twelve works of Hercules and understand the significance of the word hero so close in spirit and in building to eros which means love as you know .There is an example that it may be well sound a little exaggeration but in this new stage of a new life , the hero seems to effect a turn to the mysticism you find in the last quartets of Beethoven in which you may conclude the suffering is necessary to reach the last step of the fulfillment demanded by the heroism .In this stage you would acquire a wisdom and experience innocence to become a child as you beware in the last shot of 2001 .The redemption to be true is the last stage of the human journey  but definitively not even related with the real hero . The moral and ethics are human creations , the hero knows nothing about these human inflections due he is a nature force and the nature is not good or bad ; it is simply . Beware when a natural event occurs (an earthquake , for instance) the nature is merciless , kids , young and old people are involved in the process with any scruple or negotiation .The film has a obvious Bu&ntilde;uelian breeze . It is deeply introspective it is absorbing and haunting ; it is a feast for your eyes and a remarkable statement . Love it or hate it as you will but one thing is certain .

547393,A2Q4VD8TERJU6K,B00004CYNF,James Koch,"[2, 4]","Before there was the Wild wild west with weird little characters like Dr.Loveless running around there was this film,El Toppo.What is El Toppo?- it would presumably be Western, but that still doesn't give you any idea of the film's content whatsoever. Within the first ten minutes alone, things occur that are already too weird to mention (like grown men shooting at women's shoes and bandits dancing and kissing  monks in what one would guess is someplace in the old west while the gunfighter El Toppo is assisted by his very cute and naked 7 year old son who at times cares a gun as well and actually shoots a man to death.Well, I'd love to summarize the main story lines, but the truth is that I didn't understand one iota of it all. The pivot character El Topo, portrayed by the director himself, rides through the desert with a 7-year-old naked kid in tow.The little boy is truly cute and offers one point of tenderness to the film but before long El Toppo (The mole) abandons the little boy for ""spirtual enlightenment""...Hmmm.... He exchanges the kid for a beautiful woman after defeating a gang of thugs and goes on a quest to visit four ""masters"" of the desert. Subsequently, he joins a community of mountain people and fervently helps them coming out of their dark habitat and into the open world. Yes, it's a very vague description, but that's because I didn't know what was going on anyway. Most likely, you won't either and that's not an insult to your personal intellect! It's just a messed up movie that you mainly just need to watch for its visual brilliance, symbolism and extremely stylish choreography. Every single character that walks through the screen is a demented & complex individual, and the protagonist is the absolute biggest weirdo of them all. He actually claims to be God himself - and really believes it, too - and does the most unpredictable things imaginable. Admittedly, this film isn't suitable for entertainment purposes. It's an intense and demanding experience that you should approach with an open state of mind and loads of patience. Purely elite cinema that can't be compared to anything else ever made.It is a shame at the end of El Toppo there is not a showdown between El Toppo and Billy Jack or have El Toppo realize that his son was his true master.",4,The Weird Weird West,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,2297,"['was', 'Wild', 'wild', 'west', 'weird', 'little', 'characters', 'Dr.Loveless', 'running', 'around', 'was', 'film', 'El', 'Toppo.What', 'El', 'Toppo', 'would', 'presumably', 'be', 'Western', 'still', ""n't"", 'give', 'idea', 'film', 'content', 'whatsoever', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'alone', 'things', 'occur', 'are', 'already', 'too', 'weird', 'mention', 'grown', 'men', 'shooting', 'women', 'shoes', 'bandits', 'dancing', 'kissing', 'monks', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'guess', 'someplace', 'old', 'west', 'gunfighter', 'El', 'Toppo', 'assisted', 'very', 'cute', 'naked', '7', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'times', 'cares', 'gun', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'shoots', 'man', 'death.Well', ""'d"", 'love', 'summarize', 'main', 'story', 'lines', 'truth', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'one', 'iota', 'pivot', 'character', 'El', 'Topo', 'portrayed', 'director', 'desert', '7-year-old', 'naked', 'kid', 'tow.The', 'little', 'boy', 'truly', 'cute', 'one', 'point', 'tenderness', 'film', 'long', 'El', 'Toppo', 'mole', 'little', 'boy', 'spirtual', 'enlightenment', 'Hmmm', 'exchanges', 'kid', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'defeating', 'gang', 'thugs', 'quest', 'visit', 'four', 'masters', 'desert', 'Subsequently', 'community', 'mountain', 'people', 'fervently', 'coming', 'dark', 'habitat', 'open', 'world', 'Yes', 'very', 'vague', 'description', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'anyway', 'Most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'either', 'not', 'insult', 'personal', 'intellect', 'just', 'messed', 'up', 'movie', 'mainly', 'just', 'need', 'watch', 'visual', 'brilliance', 'symbolism', 'extremely', 'stylish', 'choreography', 'single', 'character', 'screen', 'demented', 'complex', 'individual', 'protagonist', 'absolute', 'biggest', 'weirdo', 'actually', 'be', 'God', 'really', 'too', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'things', 'imaginable', 'Admittedly', 'film', ""n't"", 'suitable', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'intense', 'demanding', 'experience', 'should', 'approach', 'open', 'state', 'mind', 'loads', 'patience', 'Purely', 'elite', 'cinema', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'anything', 'else', 'ever', 'made.It', 'shame', 'end', 'El', 'Toppo', 'not', 'showdown', 'El', 'Toppo', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'have', 'El', 'Toppo', 'realize', 'son', 'was', 'true', 'master']",El Topo VHS
547394,A1Z7U8S9R8HUSF,B00004CYNF,Jay,"[0, 2]","I saw this movie when it first opened at the Elgin Cinema in NYC. In fact, I saw it several times at the Elgin because there was so much visual imagery in this movie, that I could not totally grasp it all in one sitting. Like so many others, I waited years for this movie to come out on video. As you've heard, it was held up roughly 30 years. As you also see, some love the movie and some hate it. I personally think it is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. It's an ""eastern western"" or a western with a strong eastern philosophical bent.I'll summarize the story for those who do not understand it or cannot get beyond the violence within it. (SPOILER ALERT)The main story line concerns a man, who is called El Topo (the mole). He is called that name because his behavior is like that of the mole.  The mole is an animal that spends most of its life in darkness, searching for the light. However, should it by chance see the light of day, it is blinded by the sun.  This person, El Topo, spends his life in spiritual darkness searching for true enlightenment, true understanding of the world.  But, like the animal, when he achieves his ultimate goal, it will be too difficult for him to grasp.El Topo is a good western man who tries to live a good western life - helping people, righting wrongs.  The gunfighter analogy is used because when he sees wrong, he uses his guns to make things right.  He is like a Western hero.  He is quite skilled with guns. The movie opens with him assisting his son in the passage towards adulthood.  His son is naked to symbolize his purity and honesty.They come across a mass murder.  El Topo sets out to avenge the crime.  He sees himself as being the avenging angel of God.  Numerous symbols are interspersed to show the false power and personality of the criminals.After El Topo avenges these murders, Mara, a woman who worked for the criminals asks to go with El Topo.  She tells him that she loves him. In fact, it is obvious that what she seeks is power.  She hopes that she will be able to manipulate and control him so that the power he has will transfer to her. He realizes this almost instinctively, and tries to avoid her.  But she uses her sexuality to entice him.  Finally, he gives in despite the fact that he realizes that what he is about to do is wrong, and will likely destroy him.  But he is weak in the face of her sexual power.  He leaves his son with the priests, so that they will protect him.  He tells his son that what he is doing is wrong, but that he can not help himself - he is weak, and that his son should pray for him.  In the next image, we see that the son is now dressed in the robes of the priests.  El Topo leaves with the woman, abandoning his son.  El Topo is being lead astray.  All he wants at this point is to live with her and live a contented life.  But after a few days, she starts making demands. She demands power, luxuries. She threatens that she will leave him unless he is the best, the most powerful person around.How is he to prove that he is the best?  She explains that there are several levels of masters who live in the desert.  When he has defeated them all, then he will be the best, and Mara states that, only after he has defeated all masters will she love him forever.Reluctantly, to ensure that he will keep her love, El Topo goes along with her plans...continuing to go further astray.The masters are all very holy people, who do not seek to hurt anyone. They are masters of life, each having mastered a certain aspect of how life should be lived.  Each master that he meets is at a higher level than the previous master.  Each succeeding master that he meets has fewer and fewer possessions.  The final has only a loin cloth and a butterfly net. El Topo realizes that it is wrong to challenge and attempt to defeat/destroy these holy people, but he must do this to make Mara happy and keep her love. He also realizes that these people, besides being very holy, are both extremely powerful and smart....far more powerful and smart than he is.  Therefore, the only possible way that he can defeat them is by using deception, trickery.  The masters are each incredibly good and honest people.  In the end, Topo kills them all, through trickery.  But when you win through trickery, have you really won anything?  For example, when he attempts to kill the final master, who is dressed in a loin cloth and carried a butterfly net, El Topo takes out his gun.  The final master, laughing, waves his butterfly net.  When El Topo shoots at the master, the master uses the butterfly net to return the bullet into the sand.  ""Come, try to shoot me again,"" says the Master.  ""The next bullet that you fire I will return to your heart."" El Topo throws down his gun, crying.  He realizes that he has been defeated.  The master attempts to comfort him.  ""Why are you crying?"" he says, ""I have nothing that you could have taken from me.""  ""I could have taken your life,"" says El Topo, weeping.  ""My life?"" laughs the final master, ""My life is unimportant.  Here, give me your gun.  I will show you.""  El Topo gives the final master his gun.  The master takes the gun and shoots himself in the mouth.  As he lies dying, he whispers to El Topo, ""You lose.""  The final master is dead.El Topo's goal had been to win back Mara's love by defeating the masters. However, after achieving this goal, it tears at his soul.  Meanwhile, Mara, who never truly loved El Topo and just used him to increase her own power, is now attracted to another person who has been riding near them.  It is a young, attractive woman dressed in Western gear, in black, just as El Topo.  She speaks in a deep male voice.  The power has been transferred. Mara has no further need of him. So, she matter of factly takes his own gun and shoots him, and then leaves with the woman in black.El Topo's body is carried away by members of the local leper colony.  They bring him to their cave.  Their magic woman performs incantations and has him eat magic beetles.  His hair turns all white.  He is being purified, cleansed.  Finally, he is reborn through loving care and magic.  He is appreciative to them for saving his life. He decides to dedicate himself to helping these people.  He shaves his head.  He wears plain brown, simple clothes.  He will not carry a gun ever again.  These lepers have been banished to living in dark caves far from the city.  (note the analogy again of living underground, wanting to see the light of day).  They want to be allowed back into society, into the world.  They have been ostracized by society and have been placed here to live. El Topo will try to assist them in their efforts at freedom. However, the lepers are very unwelcome by the townspeople, who are incredibly selfish, evil people.  El Topo decides that he will meet with the townspeople, work for them (in order to earn money for both himself and the lepers) and to make friends with them, so that his friends, the lepers and disabled, will be able to again become full fledged members of the town.  With the money that he makes, he will buy equipment that will assist him and them in digging a hole from their underground leper colony to the surface, and freedom. (note the mole analogy again)El Topo works hard and makes little money, but he plods on.  We see the cast of characters of the town, and they are almost all invariably bad people.  We see charlatans, false religious leaders, etc.El Topo marries one of the leper ladies who has been the kindest to him since his arrival. She is very happy. He asks her to go with him to the local priest in town to be married.  However, when they arrive at the church, El Topo is shocked to see that it is his son, now grown up, who is the local priest.  He recognizes his son immediately.  Similarly, his son recognizes El Topo immediately, despite his very different appearance.  Rather than being happy to see his father, the priest is filled with rage. He says that he wants to kill El Topo for abandoning him.  He begins beating him with his fists.  El Topo does not fight back, does not resist the attack because he feels guilty for abandoning his son. He is bloodied and on the ground.  The woman pleads with the priest to stop his attack.  She explains that El Topo has changed...that he is a very good man now, doing good work....trying to assist the lepers in obtaining their freedom.  The son listens and finally agrees to the following - he will permit his father to complete his work in helping the lepers.  However, after his work with the lepers is complete, he will kill him. In the meantime, he agrees to marry his father and this leper woman.We see that the three - El Topo, the woman and the son  are now all working in town to earn money for the leper colony's freedom.  The son becomes impatient.  How long will this take?  He says that he can't wait any longer and that he will kill his father now. El Topo's response to grow stronger.  He uses this strength not to attack his son or to run away.  Instead, he uses it to dig harder in helping the lepers.  His new found strength allows him to complete the opening of the cave.  The lepers now have their tunnel to freedom, their tunnel to what they see as enlightenment, their tunnel to the light of day.When he finishes the digging, the son says that he will now kill his father.  El Topo stands straight, prepared to die. But the son begins crying.  ""I cannot kill my master,"" he says.  He throws down his gun.El Topo realizes that his next goal is to prepare the town for the lepers, to gain their acceptance. He must go to town and talk with them.  When they are ready to accept the lepers, he will tell them to enter the town.  But the lepers are not in a patient mood.  They can no longer wait to see the light of day. They want to come into the light now.  The minute they realize that the path to the surface has been completed, they run out of the cave, and walk towards the town.  They intend to become citizens of the town.  That is their goal. That will be their ultimate happiness.But El Topo knows that the townspeople aren't yet ready to receive these people. If they go into town now, the townspeople will destroy them.  When he learns that they have journeyed to town, he runs there as fast as he can.  When he arrives, he sees that he is too late.  The townspeople, using their guns, have killed all of the lepers.El Topo falls on the ground, crying loudly.  He is devastated.  He is then filled with rage at the townspeople for what they have done.  He walks towards them.  They all shoot at him but the bullets bounce off him. He takes a gun from one of the townspeople and begins shooting at them.  Eventually, he kills them all.After they are all dead, he sits on the ground in a lotus position.  He pours oil from an oil lamp all over himself.  He then sets himself on fire.  He will immolate himself in protest for what has taken place here.  He hopes that this action will make the world a better place.  After a few minutes, all that is left of El Topo is a skeleton.  Then, even the skeleton has been consumed.  When the fire finally goes out, we see that his body has been transformed not to dust but to pure honey...with all of the bees of the world gathering there......We now see that Brontis, his son, has now changed his garb from priest to gunslinger.  He is now dressed all in black, just like his father was.  He walks with El Topo's wife and young son.  They get on a black horse, just as El Topo rode on,  and move on to the next town.  We see now that the son must follow the same path as the father.  For such is life.  It continues in a circle, and must be self-taught.My favorite line from the movie is ""Too much perfection is a mistake.""",5,Brilliant Movie,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,11757,"['saw', 'movie',

547395,A1HXR6PIRTO0UO,B00004CYNF,J_J_Gittes,"[6, 9]","This has over the years really become a cult object, and though it is today by many considered a classic, its notorious history still hasn't come to an end, as the availability of the film is very limited, and there seem to be various edited versions in screen time and screen size. I saw a widescreen version with washed-out colors, which was a bit cut I believe.Nevertheless the power and vision of this film came through my 16:9 TV screen and I experienced enough of its magic to glimpse its greatness.The film was made as an underground project in the Mexico of the late 60s, and had difficulty finding distributors, probably because Jodorowsky had already caused a scandal with his previous film ""Fando y Lis"" in 1967 which was (reportedly after a notorious run in Mexican cinemas, where numerous fights broke out over it) banned by the Mexican government. This film too has in time become a cult object all over the world, and is available on DVD in the US along with an audio commentary by Jodorowsky himself and a documentary on its making. Though I haven't seen it yet myself, I don't think fans of surreal films would be disappointed if they took a chance with it. Because all of this Jodorowsky had difficulties with El Topo, but after John Lennon urged a friend to buy distribution rights, it got a world wide release and was heralded all over the world for its weirdness and strange philosophical take. If one considers a statement by Jodorowsky where he said that he asks of film what most North Americans ask of psychedelic drugs, one can see why the hippie-generation all over the world got enthusiastic about it. But while for example a film like ""2001 - A space Odyssey"" (which also got a lot of negative press on its original release, and commercial success through stoned audiences) became later regarded as a great cinematic achievement, El Topo hasn't yet gotten the same academic ""beatification"", for better or for worse.So a modern viewer commonly approaches it not expecting a demanding work of art, but more something along the lines of 70s pseudo-intellectual Eurotrash, spiced with some gore and sex scenes.I must confess, that this was also my own approch, when I borrowed it from a local videostore, but I was soon to be disabused.The film features Jodorowsky himself as the main character El Topo, a gunslinger in search of himself. At the beginning he has a young son with him, but he leaves him alone in a village after finding a woman who is willing to accompany him on his travels. From this point on things start to go downwards for him, as the woman stirs up his ambitions to become something. On his search for fame and money he becomes more and more unscrupulous killing and torturing people, and even aquiring a second wife. The mission he finds himself on is a mixture of a spiritual search and a killing spree, on which he has to find four master gunmen of the desert (each with a personal philosophical stance) which he wants to defeat. After completing his task (not in an honest way that is), he is left alone in the desert to die by the two women who have apparently bscome a couple.After this many a viewer (and critic) would have liked the film to end, but Jodorowsky is more interested in his philosophical vision, and the expression of a humanist view of the world, and adds a final chapter to this film, which is imo crucial for its understanding and the overall quality of the film. In the last part (which is the strongest) El Topo awakes in a cave where he has been worshipped for many years as a saint who is going to rescue the clan of deformed outcasts living there. Felling guilty of his former sins, he starts digging a tunnel, to connect the cave with the outer world, represented by a nearby town. Here Jodorowsky gets deeply allegorical and crafts a pessimistic commentary about the state of things in present day Mexico. I'll only tell, that in the following El Topo encounters his son, and that the union of all people is a task that can't be easily completed. The ending shows a bit hope for the human race as a whole, though it is far away from happy. It personally reminded me of the end of Jean Renoirs ""La grande illusion"", with whom the director shares his love for the common people and his ambivalent belief in and love of mankind, though both know what horrible things it is capable of.But above all the films quality rests in its subversive take on film and society, which has put many viewers of, and is also the most responsible factor for the films strange reputation.Jodorowsky uses elements from all over the world, mixing western and eastern philosophies, using film styles as different as the western and the slapstick comedy (where Jodorowskys knowledge of film history gleams), and dialogues and a use of language that seem to come from everywhere. The use of camera-angles contrasts beautiful panoramas with repulsive stagings of human decadence, and from gore to sex scenes, to a lrelationship between a dwarf and a ""normal"" person, there seem to be few topics the film doesn't have something to say about. But this eclectisicm isn't just a show-off, but at the very center of the films whole concept.As a whole the only satisfying comparison I found, would be to Glauber Rocha's brazilian masterpiece ""Black God, white Devil"" (which was - made in '64 - surely a huge influence), with added philosophical grounding.Jodorowsky has afterwards made only a handful of films (some also classics), but with this film alone he has left an important mark in film history.",5,Classic Film,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,5548,"['over', 'years', 'really', 'become', 'cult', 'object', 'today', 'many',

Between watching it the first and second times you need to Google and Wikipedia it. It's just better that way.I'd never heard the term ""Acid Western"" before researching El Topo but that's the best description of the film genre it belongs to. I don't know from personal experience but there's no doubt that you could drop some acid and maybe appreciate/understand this movie even more.Here's the Reader's Digest review version. There are two parts to this movie. This is the summary of the first part. Crazy cowboy kind of guy meets good looking Bi-Polar girl in the desert, things move along pretty well, and then she wants him to kill four other crazy gunmen to prove his love or something. You know how good looking Bi-Polar girls are. They didn't have credit cards back in El Topo's time so the girl had to screw up something. Great scenery. Great camera work. Crazy things happen.In part two El Topo is in a cave where a bunch of midgets and misfits have kept him alive after being shot in part one. El Topo has a completely different look and acts different to the point you start to question if part two is the same movie and storyline. It is. El Topo falls in love with a nice looking midget girl and also meets up with his son who wants to kill him. More great scenery. Great camera work. Crazy things happen.If you are a regular movie, Will Smith, kind of fan you are going to hate this. If you like finding cult movie crazy stuff that is just off the wall you will love it. It's not really fair to compare El Topo to Mondo Cane because El Topo is much deeper and has a story but parts of it are Mondo Canesque.Watch the DVD extra interview with Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo).

547397,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,B00004CYNF,JLR,"[5, 13]","In the early 1970s, Alejandro Jodorowsky made a resounding splash on American cinema with ""El Topo"", a surrealistic Western that combined graphic violence and nudity with Christian symbolism, Eastern philosophy, Zen Buddhism and counterculture sentiment. Even though it garnered poor reviews, the movie became a sensation when it was released in the midnight screenings, even earning praises by the likes of John Lennon, Bob Dylan and Peter Gabriel. However, the movie disappeared from public domain due to a custody battle between Jodorowsky and the film's original distribution company and was rarely to be found until Anchor Bay released it on DVD in 2007 in the box set, ""The Films of Alejandro Jodorowsky"".Unfortunately, time has not been kind to ""El Topo"". What was once shocking and provocative now looks puerile, pretentious and even sexist. In a bizarre scene smacked with misogyny, the Mole takes Mara out to a desert and proceeds to sexually assault her. Although the director claims in his commentary that it was used to teach the woman ""miracles"", contemporary moviegoers will look at it as an endorsement of rape. In one sequence that showcases the director`s limitations as an editor, Jodorowsky kills one of the gun masters, which precedes a series of sloppy jump cuts showing a deformed accomplice screaming and running and getting shot by Mara. The duels themselves between the Mole and the gun masters are poorly directed - action is clearly not the director's forte.Furthermore, the blatant use of symbols, particularly the second half, become tiring and tedious: when a woman screams, she blurts out a bird's chirps. When the Mole kills all the four gun masters, their graves are covered in bees. The climatic sequence comes when the Mole is being unned down by the townspeople, only to magically recover and shoot back before setting himself on fire in a scene that recalls the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc in 1963. Today, these sequences feel more like presentations of art house clich&eacute;s than of spiritual enlightenment as the director intended.As dated as a psychedelic rock concert (and just as boring), ""El Topo"" will only appeal to midnight movie audiences and moviegoers fascinated with the countercultural movies of the early 1970s.Recommended for cult fans; not recommended for everyone else",1,"Dull, pretentious and hopelessly old-fashioned",1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,2334,"['early', '1970s', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'made', 'resounding', 'splash', 'American', 'cinema', 'El', 'Topo', 'surrealistic', 'Western', 'combined', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nudity', 'Christian', 'symbolism', 'Eastern', 'philosophy', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'counterculture', 'sentiment', 'Even', 'garnered', 'poor', 'reviews', 'movie', 'became', 'sensation', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'midnight', 'screenings', 'even', 'earning', 'praises', 'likes', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'However', 'movie', 'disappeared', 'public', 'domain', 'due', 'custody', 'battle', 'Jodorowsky', 'film', 'original', 'distribution', 'company', 'was', 'rarely', 'be', 'found', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'released', 'DVD', '2007', 'box', 'set', 'Films', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', '.Unfortunately', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'El', 'Topo', 'What', 'was', 'once', 'shocking', 'provocative', 'now', 'puerile', 'pretentious', 'even', 'sexist', 'bizarre', 'scene', 'smacked', 'misogyny', 'Mole', 'Mara', 'desert', 'proceeds', 'sexually', 'assault', 'director', 'claims', 'commentary', 'was', 'used', 'teach', 'woman', 'miracles', 'contemporary', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'look', 'endorsement', 'rape', 'one', 'sequence', 'director', 's', 'limitations', 'editor', 'Jodorowsky', 'one', 'gun', 'masters', 'series', 'sloppy', 'jump', 'cuts', 'showing', 'deformed', 'accomplice', 'screaming', 'running', 'getting', 'shot', 'Mara', 'duels', 'Mole', 'gun', 'masters', 'are', 'poorly', 'directed', 'action', 'clearly', 'not', 'director', 'forte.Furthermore', 'blatant', 'use', 'symbols', 'particularly', 'second', 'half', 'become', 'tiring', 'tedious', 'when', 'woman', 'screams', 'out', 'bird', 'chirps', 'When', 'Mole', 'four', 'gun', 'masters', 'graves', 'are', 'covered', 'bees', 'climatic', 'sequence', 'when', 'Mole', 'being', 'unned', 'down', 'townspeople', 'only', 'magically', 'recover', 'shoot', 'back', 'setting', 'fire', 'scene', 'self-immolation', 'Thich', 'Quang', 'Duc', '1963', 'Today', 'sequences', 'feel', 'more', 'presentations', 'art', 'house', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'spiritual', 'enlightenment', 'director', 'intended.As', 'dated', 'psychedelic', 'rock', 'concert', 'just', 'boring', 'El', 'Topo', 'will', 'only', 'appeal', 'midnight', 'movie', 'audiences', 'moviegoers', 'fascinated', 'countercultural', 'movies', 'early', '1970s.Recommended', 'cult', 'fans', 'not', 'recommended', 'everyone', 'else']",El Topo VHS
547398,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00004CYNF,K. Driscoll,"[21, 29]","El Topo is the classic Mexican film hailed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono enough that it was shown at midnight in many cinemas for years. It is often credited as starting the midnight movie countercultural that helped bring attention to, and build cult film audiences for movies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and David Lynch's Eraserhead.  In that respect it is far from a mainstream film but it got enough attention that it is celebrated even today.  I feel that this is with good reason, as El Topo is one of best films ever made.  Alejandro Jodorowsky directs and stars as the title character.El Topo begins with its eponymous character in the desert with his son.  He tells the boy to bury a picture of his mother and his toy in the sand as now it is time for him to become a man.  The boy is vulnerable but El Topo leads him by example while protecting him in their various interactions with others.  The film understands the western genre and the machismo that often accompanies it.  El Topo is one bad cowboy who can guarantee protection for anyone he cares about.  So it really sucks when he soon leaves his son behind with a bunch of monks after emasculating some evil banditos.  He leaves with a girl he saved and he names her Mara.  Mara loves El Topo for being the alpha male that he is, so she convinces him to kill the four best gunslingers so he can be baddest cowboy of them all.  He manages to defeat them in various significant ways.  These scenes are rich in biblical and other religious references and operate allegorically to show that being a bad cowboy isn't really all it's cracked up to be.  Nevertheless, for better or worse, El Topo kills all four of them and begins to learn four specific lessons along the way.  He begins to feel guilty and while he is caught off guard during the beginning stages of his enlightenment, he is defeated by the unknown woman who followed El Topo and Mara during their journey.  Viewing El Topo as vulnerable, Mara betrays him and leaves with this unknown woman gunslinger.  El Topo's battered and shot up body is taken away to a cave by a multitude of unseemly characters.Macrocosmically, the journey for El Topo overall suggests that his travels represent the rise and trials of Judeo-Christian theologies, with the son representing new Judeo-Christianity and El Topo representing the old philosphies.  The second half of the film seems to comment on more contemporary dealings and even anticipates what will happen in the future.  How will El Topo's son grow?  How will he react to the father who abandoned him but who has himself grown? How will the dominant faith evolve?  How will it maintain its truth and purity with humanity at the wheel?In the literal sense, the second half of El Topo forwards to a few years later after he is brought to a cave by this band of deformed pariahs.  When he wakes up we soon realize that El Topo is a different man.  He shaves off his beard and head and dresses as a monk.  He makes a plan to free these people from their cave so they can join the community outside.  He plans to fund the building of a tunnel to free these people.  He does this by going to the town with his dwarven girlfriend to entertain them with comedy and dancing, among other small jobs.  The town itself is by no means a utopia as it is wrought with slavery and violence.  A new priest at the church in town is revealed to be El Topo's own son who he abandoned years earlier.  El Topo's son plans to kill him but he decides not to do so until the tunnel is complete.  The tunnel gets finished and El Topo's son decides not to kill him.  Meanwhile, the deformed people are free and as they head to the town the villagers there begin to shoot and kill all of them, to El Topo's dismay.  El Topo unleashes his vengeance on the villagers, killing them all and in the process freeing their slaves.  El Topo then lights himself on fire, which was a timely parallel to the Buddhist monks who did the same in protest of the Vietnam War.  During his death, El Topo's new son is born to his dwarven girlfriend.  If the Buddhist references are consistent then this would suggest that El Topo is reincarnated as his own son and religious truth will continue to surface again.I think it is important to note that the content in El Topo could be perceived as both perplexing and offensive to many movie-goers.  Alejandro Jodorowsky kills real animals, uses real deformed and dwarfed people, and liberally applies nudity and violence throughout.  It doesn't offend me at all but I knew my wife wouldn't like it and I understand why, so I mention it here just in case.El Topo is a complex story with many odd details as well as many religious references and metaphors that comment on a larger scale as I noted earlier.  I've seen it many times and in my first few viewings I didn't understand it and thought it was entertaining but pretentious.  It is not pretentious.  Microcosmically, El Topo is a film about a human being finding himself, and finding out all alone what it means to be alive. It is about independently becoming a good man as a good man is defined in the eyes of Alejandro Jodorowsky.  It is obviously a deeply personal film for its director and it may not touch on elements personal to everyone in its audience, but it definitely did for me.  Jodorowsky invokes religious references as a vehicle to express his own torments and challenges and how the enlightment experience for El Topo is merely mirroring his own experiences.  It's commentary addresses oceans of issues in many layers. Conjuring up the imagination to produce this web of ideas so alive is indeed an ambitious undertaking.  I find El Topo to be profoundly inspiring in a way that few films are.  Its significance alone should at least justify one viewing for you and I hope you get the same satisfaction that I did.  Perhaps you will like it enough to enjoy El Topo again and again.",5,Complex Mexican Religious Allegory,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,5929,"['El', 'Topo', 'classic', 'Mexican', 'film', 'hailed',

547399,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00004CYNF,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","NOTE: For the purpose of this review, I will be addressing the new Blu-Ray editions of ""El Topo"" and its sequel ""The Holy Mountain"" together. I viewed them back to back and feel that it is easy to see the two films as one experience.Blu-Ray specs: If all you care about is how the new discs stack up, let's get that out of the way. Both films have received new HD transfers and look better and crisper than any other version that I've seen. That day-glo blood is potently orange! El Topo is in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio (won't be in widescreen), while The Holy Mountain is anamorphic. Most notable special features on El Topo are Jodorowsky commentary and an additional interview. Most notable special features on The Holy Mountain are a commentary track, deleted scenes, and insight into the film restoration. Both have traditional extras like the trailer, photo gallery, and script excerpts.Madman or genius? Pretentious hokum or revolutionary cinema? Alejandro Jodorowsky is a film maker whose vision brooks very little middle ground. It seems to be a love it or hate it proposition. In truth, I'm a fan--but his work is definitely not for everyone. I may get into trouble with the most ardent of Jodorowsky enthusiasts when I say that I get more visceral satisfaction from the madcap imagery in his films than to any purported deep meaning. As two of his trademark films hit Blu-Ray, I was pleased to get an opportunity to check out his landmark films ""El Topo"" and ""The Holy Mountain"" again after about ten years. Experimental, controversial, provocative, disturbing--these demented films helped define the cult movie scene in the early seventies. ""El Topo,"" in fact, played as a midnight movie in New York City for seven straight months. Today, they are still bizarrely fascinating but, once again, their divisive nature is likely to garner as many (if not more) detractors than admirers.Of the two films, El Topo is closer to my heart. Starting out as a deranged western, the film morphs into a bloody existential quest, and ends as a struggle for redemption. The early scenes of this film always trap me into a full viewing! The central hero, played by Jodorowsky himself, is a gunfighter who becomes corrupted. Searching for meaning within his new existence, he tracks down four opponents with advanced battle skills and enlightened viewpoints. But these battles don't offer the solutions he had hoped for. Another chance at salvation comes about with a clan of misfits, but do they really require saving? Absurd, funny, and always intriguing--this is an incredible journey to nowhere and I love it!The Holy Mountain has much loftier goals--but, to my mind, bigger isn't always better. A direct sequel, although relatively unrelated except for the central character, it picks up in the aftermath of the first film. Our hero now embraces a Christ-like countenance and the first third of the film presents some of the grimmest religion related spectacles you're likely to encounter on film. (In fact, the was a huge uproar at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival). Achieving a heightened state of being, he assembles a collection of powerful individuals--each representing a different planet. Stripping them down, the gang embarks on a lengthy existential quest to take a place among the gods. Strong religious allegory, mystical symbolism, and ideological iconography are brought together and are inherent parts of this film--but philosophical points tend to be hammered home. Sometimes ""The Holy Mountain"" loses me, it can be very heavy handed and message oriented. But still, an intriguing example of avant garde film making.Again, the most arresting aspects of both films for me are most assuredly the visual qualities. If you like the gruesome and provocative imagery of Bunuel or Pasolini, you'll definitely want to check the films out. For entertainment, my easy choice is ""El Topo."" (4 stars) If you're searching for something fraught with meaning, try ""The Holy Mountain."" (3 1/2 stars) Or catch them together as I did.

547401,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004CYNF,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","What if Federico Fellini made a spaghetti western?  Such a rhetorical question misses the mark because director Alejandro Jodorowsky is not Fellini (and visa versa) and lives in his own little private universe, but there was a point when I finally got to watch ""El Topo"" where thinking of the movie as a cross between ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Satyricon"" made perfect sense.  Then things got even more surreal and I had to cling to the fact that Jodorowsky was indeed, as he proclaims in the brief inteview that accompanies the film on this DVD, the father of the Midnight Movie.  As such, ""El Topo"" is off in a cinematic corner along with ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Pink Flamingos,"" ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" and the like.I first read about ""El Topo"" in some magazine I bought when I was in college.  The magazine is probably somewhere in a box around here (most things I own are), but the one thing I remember is Jodorowsky talking about a scene in which the title character, whom he was playing, was going to rape a woman.  He ordered the actress to hit him to prepare for the moment and she cracked a couple of his ribs.  That particular scene is quite short and rather inconsequential in the grand scheme of things when you watch this film, which has two main acts.  In the first, El Topo ditches his seven-year-old naked son and rides off into the desert with a woman he names Mara (Mara Lorenzio), who convinces him to become the greatest gunslinger around by taking out four master gunmen.  El Topo succeeds, but ends up a victim himself.  In the second part of the film, El Topo meditates for many years on what has happened before becoming ""reborn,"" and undertaking a quest to free the deformed outcasts who live underground and who have cared for him all these years.That gives you a bare outline of the film and it would be a disservice to say more because ""El Topo"" is one of those films that you have to see for yourself and make up your own mind.  Clearly this film wants to you to question it and ask yourself, ""What does it all mean?""  I could feign that my unwillingness to play along is simply a sign of old age, but I know full well that I would not have played the game when I was in college either.  This is mainly because I would not have been stoned when I watched the film, but more simply because my ability to handle surrealism is pretty much limited to deconstructing the paintings of Salvador Dali.

My review may, therefore, be of necessity both of limited value but perhaps helpful. To wit: latin american artistes are well aware of the cross currents in their political and social culture, which are very strong. MUCH stronger than their cross cultrual counterparts in more soporific cultures like the US of A. As a result, the only way to really rationalize them--unite those currents, if you will--is through a bent for surrealism. Seems that Latinos LOVE to view their culture as in some very way surreal. I refer you to, for example, the author Gabriel Garcia Marquez' creation of ""Macondo"", which is, of course, Colombia and Cartagena specifically. So, view this movie not only with an appreciation for whatever qualities it may possess ipso facto, but for the cultural constraints which define, in an ever more pedestrian and predcatable manner, its development. Sadly, until that lovely hemisphere springs free of its own cultural self-obsessions will we see simple things--like everone being able to buy bread--a reality.

Amazon tells you what it's about adequately in it's review but what is the film saying?  In Roger Ebert's 4 star review he says the movie leaves you with two impulses.  ""One is to accept it on its own terms, as a complex fantasy that uses violence as the most convenient cinematic shorthand for human power relationships. The other is to reject it as the work of a cynic, who is simply supplying more jolts and shocks per minute than most filmmakers.""  He goes with the first one.I'm going to skip for a moment analyzing this film for hidden meanings and let you know what you will see.Extreme violence, religious references- Christianity, Zen, black magic, disembowelments, torture, genocide, nudity, sadomasochistic behavior, deformed and incestuously mutated cripples, hangings, suicide, a blind gunfighter, a cripple with no legs that piggy backs a cripple with no arms, sex, lesbianism, slavery, lots and lots of bright red blood, landscapes, boilings, rape, and some Russian roulette to name just some of what you will see.  All that and this is a Western, although i would say by the way of Space Odyssey 2001.As i said in the title this is for the open minded who want to see something they've never seen something deep and far out there.So back to the hidden meanings and interpretations, I had some while watching now I'm not so sure you can get to one by watching this just once.

It is not a traditional movie by any means but very well worth watching for those with an open mind and familiar with the religious and philosophical allusions alluded to. For example, the Biblical idea of Original Sin where Satan tempted Eve with the fruit and Plato's allegory of the Cave. Sometimes I felt the allusions were a little gratuitous and clumsily incorporated but for the most part, they were appropriate and had the intended effect.The movie is extremely violent and unforgettable for its surreal, disturbing images. But within that violence and surrealism is a sensitivity; it contains several surprisingly touching moments. Also surprisingly, it contained (unintended?) some hilarious moments. The leading character played by the director, Jodorowsky himself, is on a mission for enlightenment as the eponymous gunslinger ('El Topo' or 'The Mole'). He tries to free people from oppression and fear but ends up usually causing harm to them in unforeseen ways. He is anguished by his failure as a seeker of enlightenment and as a person and eventually finds himself in a cave living as a ascetic monk among deformed people. He tries to free them from the cave but as always, tragedy ensues. The allegory of the mole, as something that digs around in darkness and when it finds itself on the surface of the earth, is ""blinded by the sun"" serves as a metaphor for human history and its own search for enlightenment and truth.",4,Quite good,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,1521,"['think', 'western', 'classic', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'traditional', 'western', 'not', 'traditional', 'movie', 'means', 'very', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'open', 'mind', 'familiar', 'religious', 'philosophical', 'allusions', 'alluded', 'example', 'Biblical', 'idea', 'Original', 'Sin', 'where', 'Satan', 'tempted', 'Eve', 'fruit', 'Plato', 'allegory', 'Cave', 'Sometimes', 'felt', 'allusions', 'were', 'little', 'gratuitous', 'clumsily', 'incorporated', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'appropriate', 'had', 'intended', 'effect.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'violent', 'unforgettable', 'surreal', 'disturbing', 'images', 'violence', 'surrealism', 'sensitivity', 'several', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'moments', 'Also', 'surprisingly', 'contained', 'unintended', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'leading', 'character', 'played', 'director', 'Jodorowsky', 'mission', 'enlightenment', 'eponymous', 'gunslinger', ""'El"", 'Topo', ""'The"", 'Mole', 'free', 'people', 'oppression', 'fear', 'up', 'usually', 'causing', 'harm', 'unforeseen', 'ways', 'anguished', 'failure', 'seeker', 'enlightenment', 'person', 'eventually', 'cave', 'living', 'ascetic', 'monk', 'deformed', 'people', 'free', 'cave', 'always', 'tragedy', 'ensues', 'allegory', 'mole', 'something', 'around', 'darkness', 'when', 'surface', 'earth', 'blinded', 'sun', 'serves', 'metaphor', 'human', 'history', 'own', 'search', 'enlightenment', 'truth']",El Topo VHS
547406,A15ZZDKRKP7L4R,B00004CYNF,Nick Tropiano,"[3, 5]","Having read about this film for decades, and only recently having seen it, I am guilty of prejudging this film. Didn't think I'd like it, but I had to satiate my curiosity. First off, I thought it would have had far lower production values because it's always described as a low budget affair.  Actually, this film was shot (according to IMDB) in Mexico in 1969 for $400,000 1969 dollars. No - not a blockbuster budget, but certainly not shoestring stuff I had expected, given the era it was shot and the country where it was lensed.I expected something much more amateurish, and was prepared to give it some latitude in terms of production values and acting.  This was unnecessary. It is beautifully shot, on location, with vivid colors and the compositions and locations are excellent - perfect. Every penny is on screen, and it is as gorgeous as any big budget Western I've ever seen, perhaps more so. The performances, the costumes, everything is spot on.There are those who call this film self-indulgent, and I suppose it is as much as any modern art in other media.  I find it ironic that experimental jazz artists, painters of modern art, and experimental stage works escape such criticism , but if filmmakers endeavor down similar ""semi-linear"" or surreal paths, their work is derided as being ""self-indulgent"" and written off.However, this is a film you will likely not soon forget.  Image after image, scene after scene - from frame one, till its end, will be seared into your memory - forever. Some say the shock value of this work has worn off over the years, I don't think so - at least not for me.  Perhaps it has attenuated to a degree but this works more in the films favor, as you can watch the film on its own merits, rather than the surface-level shock value of /most/ of its imagery.  Like it or hate it, if you make it through, you will not forget this film or its depravity, perversity, strangeness, and unrelenting ultra-violence. If you're not up for such a cinematic event, stay away.  It's more perverse than anything ever put on screen that's reached a mass audience.  Forget about making sense of the mish-mosh of symbolism. These are undiluted scenes straight from the  imagination and subconscience of its creator, Alejandro Jodorowsky, who allowed these vision to ""bubble up"" to the surface and pulled no punches in sharing them with an audience via the medium of film. And, he did this with great care and skill.  This is the beauty and genius of this film, El Topo.  Don't try to psychoanalyze it or figure it out.  It's not a puzzle. Just sit back and take it in.Few films can lay claim to being unforgettable and have as much disturbing and oddly beautiful imagery. This is one of them. It's ultra-violent even by today's standards, perverse, and surreal - a surreal Western and a sick and strange little dream recreated on film.  Perhaps its not entertaining in the traditional sense of the word, but it is, to the right audience, unique, facinating, disturbing, and unforgettable.",5,Mind Altering,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,3017,"['Having', 'read', 'film', 'decades', 'only', 'recently', 'having', 'seen', 'am', 'guilty', 'prejudging', 'film', 'Did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'had', 'satiate', 'curiosity', 'First', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'far', 'lower', 'production', 'values', 'always', 'described', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'Actually', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'according', 'IMDB', 'Mexico', '1969', '400,000', '1969', 'dollars', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'budget', 'certainly', 'not', 'shoestring', 'stuff', 'had', 'expected', 'given', 'era', 'was', 'shot', 'country', 'where', 'was', 'lensed.I', 'expected', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'amateurish', 'was', 'prepared', 'give', 'latitude', 'terms', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'location', 'vivid', 'colors', 'compositions', 'locations', 'are', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'penny', 'screen', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'big', 'budget', 'Western', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'performances', 'costumes', 'everything', 'spot', 'are', 'who', 'call', 'film', 'self-indulgent', 'suppose', 'as', 'much', 'modern', 'art', 'other', 'media', 'find', 'ironic', 'experimental', 'jazz', 'artists', 'painters', 'modern', 'art', 'experimental', 'stage', 'escape', 'such', 'criticism', 'filmmakers', 'endeavor', 'down', 'similar', 'semi-linear', 'surreal', 'paths', 'work', 'derided', 'being', 'self-indulgent', 'written', 'off.However', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'Image', 'image', 'scene', 'scene', 'frame', 'one', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'seared', 'memory', 'forever', 'say', 'shock', 'value', 'work', 'worn', 'off', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'least', 'not', 'Perhaps', 'attenuated', 'degree', 'more', 'films', 'favor', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'rather', 'surface-level', 'shock', 'value', '/most/', 'imagery', 'hate', 'make', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'film', 'depravity', 'perversity', 'strangeness', 'unrelenting', 'ultra-violence', ""'re"", 'not', 'up', 'such', 'cinematic', 'event', 'stay', 'away', 'more', 'perverse', 'anything', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'reached', 'mass', 'audience', 'Forget', 'making', 'sense', 'mish-mosh', 'symbolism', 'are', 'undiluted', 'scenes', 'straight', 'imagination', 'subconscience', 'creator', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'who', 'allowed', 'vision', 'bubble', 'up', 'surface', 'pulled', 'punches', 'sharing', 'audience', 'medium', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'care', 'skill', 'beauty', 'genius', 'film', 'El', 'Topo', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'psychoanalyze', 'figure', 'out', 'not', 'puzzle', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'take', 'in.Few', 'films', 'can', 'lay', 'claim', 'being', 'unforgettable', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'disturbing', 'oddly', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'one', 'ultra-violent', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'perverse', 'surreal', 'surreal', 'Western', 'sick', 'strange', 'little', 'dream', 'recreated', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'entertaining', 'traditional', 'sense', 'word', 'right', 'audience', 'unique', 'facinating', 'disturbing', 'unforgettable']",El Topo VHS
547407,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00004CYNF,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","El Topo (The Mole) (Alejandro Jodorowsky, 1971)[originally posted 10Apr2000]El Topo is a film that's taken on almost mythical dimensions, thanks to an almost thirty-year-long custody battle between Jodorowsky and the film's original distribution company that's kept it out of the public eye almost since its release in 1971 [ed. note 15Aug2013: things were finally settled, and the movie was released in the Western hemisphere on DVD for the first time in 2007]. Thankfully, in 1996, a copy found its way into wide release in Japan, and Republic Video, never one to shirk an idea that will make them a buck, have imported the Japanese release of the movie and started distributing it in the west. So these days, if you get a copy of El Topo, you've either got a bootleg or a copy with subtitles in Japanese and blurring over the naughty bits. (One wonders what the Japanese censors envision happening to society if they're able to see a two-second clip of four men getting spanked.)As is the way of such things, the inability of the public to see El Topo has elevated it to near-mythical status, and the extremely high quality of Jodorowsky's more widely-released output (see my recent review of Santa Sangre) has churned the waters into an almost fever pitch over the film. As is also the way of such things, it's next to impossible for any film to live up to that kind of hype, and El Topo is no exception. Yes, it's a good film, and yes, Jodorowsky fans will enjoy the thick symbolism laced with sex and violence (none of which, as usual, is gratuitous).More scholarly folk than I will be able to trace the many metaphors of various religions in El Topo's quest to destroy the four masters and become the master himself, and his son's quest to free the beggars in the underground city, but I ended up thinking that El Topo is actually the blueprint for the oft-parodied ""art film"" that actually makes no sense to anyone. (If you've gone to the movies recently, you've probably seen the new moviefone.com ad that features the ersatz Polish film ""Look at My Potato."" You get the idea.)Still, the camerawork is fine, what symbolism there is to be deciphered by the rank and file is profound enough for any other three films, it's got its share of laughs, and it's worth seeing for all those reasons (and because it's Jodorowsky). But be cautious when listening to the hype. It's not the be-all and end-all of filmmaking, as many would have you believe. ** ",3,The Seven-Bullet Mountain,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,2456,"['El', 'Topo', 'Mole', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', '1971', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '10Apr2000', ']', 'El', 'Topo', 'film', 'taken', 'almost', 'mythical', 'dimensions', 'thanks', 'almost', 'thirty-year-long', 'custody', 'battle', 'Jodorowsky', 'film', 'original', 'distribution', 'company', 'kept', 'public', 'eye', 'almost', 'release', '1971', '[', 'ed', '15Aug2013', 'things', 'were', 'finally', 'settled', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Western', 'hemisphere', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', '2007', ']', 'Thankfully', '1996', 'copy', 'found', 'way', 'wide', 'release', 'Japan', 'Republic', 'Video', 'never', 'one', 'shirk', 'idea', 'will', 'make', 'buck', 'have', 'imported', 'Japanese', 'release', 'movie', 'started', 'distributing', 'west', 'days', 'get', 'copy', 'El', 'Topo', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'subtitles', 'Japanese', 'blurring', 'naughty', 'bits', 'One', 'what', 'Japanese', 'censors', 'envision', 'happening', 'society', ""'re"", 'able', 'see', 'two-second', 'clip', 'four', 'men', 'getting', 'spanked', 'way', 'such', 'things', 'inability', 'public', 'see', 'El', 'Topo', 'elevated', 'near-mythical', 'status', 'extremely', 'high', 'quality', 'Jodorowsky', 'more', 'widely-released', 'output', 'see', 'recent', 'review', 'Santa', 'Sangre', 'churned', 'waters', 'almost', 'fever', 'pitch', 'film', 'also', 'way', 'such', 'things', 'next', 'impossible', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'kind', 'hype', 'El', 'Topo', 'exception', 'Yes', 'good', 'film', 'yes', 'Jodorowsky', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'thick', 'symbolism', 'laced', 'sex', 'violence', 'none', 'usual', 'gratuitous', '.More', 'scholarly', 'folk', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'trace', 'many', 'metaphors', 'various', 'religions', 'El', 'Topo', 'quest', 'destroy', 'four', 'masters', 'become', 'master', 'son', 'quest', 'free', 'beggars', 'underground', 'city', 'ended', 'up', 'thinking', 'El', 'Topo', 'actually', 'blueprint', 'oft-parodied', 'art', 'film', 'actually', 'sense', 'anyone', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'movies', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'new', 'moviefone.com', 'ad', 'ersatz', 'Polish', 'film', 'Look', 'My', 'Potato', 'get', 'idea', 'Still', 'camerawork', 'fine', 'what', 'symbolism', 'be', 'deciphered', 'rank', 'file', 'profound', 'enough', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'got', 'share', 'laughs', 'worth', 'seeing', 'reasons', 'Jodorowsky', 'be', 'cautious', 'when', 'listening', 'hype', 'not', 'be-all', 'end-all', 'filmmaking', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'believe', '**']",El Topo VHS

The films, originally made in the 1970's in Mexico, were restored and remastered under the supervision of Jodorowsky himself.  That same year both titles were featured in the Cannes Classics section at Cannes International Film Festival.  EL TOPO was shown to a black-tie audience at Salle Bunuel in the Palais des Festivals and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN was honored with the prized ""Centerpiece Screening,"" which was held on the beach at sundown.Now, at long last and in response to Jodorowsky fans, these two films are available for the first time on Blu-ray starting April 26.Both films have been remastered for their HD release and include the bonus material from their previous DVD release.EL TOPO was first released theatrically in 1969 and it made Jodoowsky a household name with the hip, the hep, the art and counterculture crowd.  It screened seven nights a week at midnight for seven straight months at the infamous Elgin Cinema in New York.  Paradoxically, the film was thoroughly panned by the film critic of the New York Times but was praised by the same paper's art critic who said it was ""a monumental work of filmic art.""  To call EL TOPO a ""cult classic"" is an understatement in light of its surprisingly broad acceptance fueled, in part, by the resounding endorsements from John Lennon and Yoko Ono that made it a commercial success in it's own time.The film is an amalgam of classic American western and avant-guarde European sensibilities with a healthy dose of Zen Buddhism and Biblical allusions thrown into the mix.  The story follows master gunfighter and mystic El Topo (played by writer/director Jodorowsky) as he attempts to defeat four sharp-shooting rivals on a bizarre path to self-awareness and resurrection.  What makes it so engaging is the blurred lines between allegory, metaphor and reality.Beware watching this fever dream under the influence of any mind altering chemicals.",3,A MAD FEVER DREAM,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,2449,"['EL', 'TOPO', 'THE', 'HOLY', 'MOUNTAIN', 'ground-breaking', 'cult', 'classics', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'are', 'most', 'sought-after', 'film', 'titles', 'yet', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'credited', 'starting', 'Midnight', 'Movie', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'Even', 'today', 'movies', 'are', 'staples', 'art', 'houses', 'museums', 'film', 'festival', 'world.In', '2006', 'following', 'restoration', 'remastering', 'films', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'THE', 'HOLY', 'MOUNTAIN', 'were', 'shown', 'Special', 'Events', 'section', 'prestigious', '44th', 'Annual', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Festival', 'films', 'originally', 'made', '1970', 'Mexico', 'were', 'restored', 'remastered', 'supervision', 'Jodorowsky', 'same', 'year', 'titles', 'were', 'featured', 'Cannes', 'Classics', 'section', 'Cannes', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'was', 'shown', 'black-tie', 'audience', 'Salle', 'Bunuel', 'Palais', 'des', 'Festivals', 'THE', 'HOLY', 'MOUNTAIN', 'was', 'honored', 'prized', 'Centerpiece', 'Screening', 'was', 'held', 'beach', 'sundown.Now', 'long', 'last', 'response', 'Jodorowsky', 'fans', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'available', 'first', 'time', 'Blu-ray', 'starting', 'April', '26.Both', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'HD', 'release', 'include', 'bonus', 'material', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release.EL', 'TOPO', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theatrically', '1969', 'made', 'Jodoowsky', 'household', 'name', 'hip', 'hep', 'art', 'counterculture', 'crowd', 'screened', 'seven', 'nights', 'week', 'midnight', 'seven', 'straight', 'months', 'infamous', 'Elgin', 'Cinema', 'New', 'York', 'Paradoxically', 'film', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'panned', 'film', 'critic', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'was', 'praised', 'same', 'paper', 'art', 'critic', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'monumental', 'work', 'filmic', 'art', 'call', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'cult', 'classic', 'understatement', 'light', 'surprisingly', 'broad', 'acceptance', 'fueled', 'part', 'resounding', 'endorsements', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'made', 'commercial', 'success', 'own', 'time.The', 'film', 'amalgam', 'classic', 'American', 'western', 'avant-guarde', 'European', 'sensibilities', 'healthy', 'dose', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'Biblical', 'allusions', 'thrown', 'mix', 'story', 'master', 'gunfighter', 'mystic', 'El', 'Topo', 'played', 'writer/director', 'Jodorowsky', 'defeat', 'four', 'sharp-shooting', 'rivals', 'bizarre', 'path', 'self-awareness', 'resurrection', 'What', 'engaging', 'blurred', 'lines', 'allegory', 'metaphor', 'reality.Beware', 'watching', 'fever', 'dream', 'influence', 'mind', 'altering', 'chemicals']",El Topo VHS

547410,A6FIAB28IS79,B00004CYNF,Samuel Chell,"[16, 21]","Notorious as ""the"" cult movie between ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" ""El Topo"" certainly deserves a new, commercial DVD edition no less than the aforementioned cult hits and the contemporaneous ""Pink Flamingoes.""  The film is primarily Jodorowsky's private allegory, often inscrutable but nonetheless thought-provoking and conducive to productive discussion--perhaps more than any independent film prior to ""Eraserhead.""There's something for everyone in this film.  The alternative, cultist crowd will enjoy the striking, often daring, imagery--the nude child who accompanies the mole, the wife impaled on a lofty stake towering over a pool of blood, the lust in the dust scenes, the mutilated bodies, the homoerotic images, etc.  The philosophic and theologic-minded will have a field day with the film, drawing as it does on all three of the world's major religions with a good deal of ""magic realism"" thrown in.  (El Topo's mortification and transformation into a clown recalls both St. Paul's ""you must become a fool for Christ"" and the privileged and sacred role of the clown in Eastern religions; his self-immolation summons up television imagery of Buddhist monks in Viet Nam during the time of the film's production.)  The archetypologists will no doubt interpret the film as a variation on the Campbell monomyth, beginning with the hero's departure and--following numerous tests, descent into the belly of the whale, and resurrection--concluding with his return home.But for a true film buff, ""El Topo"" deserves to stay around because of its clear indebtedness to a film tradition of cutting-edge, innovative movies--Bunuel's surrealist ""Un Chien Andalou,"" ""Simon of the Desert,"" and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie""; Godard's ellipsist editing in ""Breathless"" and ""Contempt""; Peckinpah's over-the-top, cleansing violence in ""Straw Dogs"" and ""The Wild Bunch.""My major problem with the film concerns the ubiquitous, practically non-stop gun play. At some moments the story makes it clear that ""El Topo"" cannot be a master of selfish fear until he renounces the gun, but more often than not the gun serves the cause of both justice and the assertion of personal will.  When even as a clown he returns to the gun, I find it difficult to muster any sympathy for him.  Perhaps the final image of his self-demise (a return to the earth echoing and building on the opening image of interment) is meant to be the story's major apocalypse, but I doubt that most of the 1970's' ""midnight movie"" crowd ever saw it that way.",4,Unearth the mole--bring it into the light of day.,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,2561,"['Notorious', 'cult', 'movie', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'El', 'Topo', 'certainly', 'new', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'edition', 'no', 'less', 'aforementioned', 'cult', 'hits', 'contemporaneous', 'Pink', 'Flamingoes', 'film', 'primarily', 'Jodorowsky', 'private', 'allegory', 'often', 'inscrutable', 'nonetheless', 'thought-provoking', 'conducive', 'productive', 'discussion', 'perhaps', 'more', 'independent', 'film', 'prior', 'Eraserhead', 'something', 'everyone', 'film', 'alternative', 'cultist', 'crowd', 'will', 'enjoy', 'striking', 'often', 'daring', 'imagery', 'nude', 'child', 'who', 'mole', 'wife', 'impaled', 'lofty', 'stake', 'towering', 'pool', 'blood', 'lust', 'dust', 'scenes', 'mutilated', 'bodies', 'homoerotic', 'images', 'etc', 'philosophic', 'theologic-minded', 'will', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'film', 'drawing', 'three', 'world', 'major', 'religions', 'good', 'deal', 'magic', 'realism', 'thrown', 'El', 'Topo', 'mortification', 'transformation', 'clown', 'St.', 'Paul', 'must', 'become', 'fool', 'Christ', 'privileged', 'sacred', 'role', 'clown', 'Eastern', 'religions', 'self-immolation', 'summons', 'up', 'television', 'imagery', 'Buddhist', 'monks', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'time', 'film', 'production', 'archetypologists', 'will', 'doubt', 'interpret', 'film', 'variation', 'Campbell', 'monomyth', 'beginning', 'hero', 'departure', 'following', 'numerous', 'tests', 'descent', 'belly', 'whale', 'resurrection', 'concluding', 'return', 'home.But', 'true', 'film', 'buff', 'El', 'Topo', 'stay', 'clear', 'indebtedness', 'film', 'tradition', 'cutting-edge', 'innovative', 'movies', 'Bunuel', 'surrealist', 'Un', 'Chien', 'Andalou', 'Simon', 'Desert', 'Discreet', 'Charm', 'Bourgeoisie', 'Godard', 'ellipsist', 'editing', 'Breathless', 'Contempt', 'Peckinpah', 'over-the-top', 'cleansing', 'violence', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'ubiquitous', 'practically', 'non-stop', 'gun', 'play', 'moments', 'story', 'clear', 'El', 'Topo', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'master', 'selfish', 'fear', 'gun', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'gun', 'cause', 'justice', 'assertion', 'personal', 'will', 'When', 'even', 'clown', 'gun', 'find', 'difficult', 'muster', 'sympathy', 'Perhaps', 'final', 'image', 'self-demise', 'return', 'earth', 'echoing', 'building', 'opening', 'image', 'interment', 'meant', 'be', 'story', 'major', 'apocalypse', 'doubt', 'most', '1970', 'midnight', 'movie', 'crowd', 'ever', 'saw', 'way']",El Topo VHS
