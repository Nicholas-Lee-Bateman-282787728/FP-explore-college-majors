If there's one thing I've learned over the years it's that most film reviewers don't know what they're talking about. If movie reviewers know so much why don't they make their own films? Be your own judge when it comes to movies. I've seen alot of great films get thrown in the crapper because of bad reviews.Not watching this film would have been a big mistake on my part. Ali G Indahouse was full of laughs from the opening scene. Sure it's not the most intelligent film but it sure as hell ranks up there with the best comedy flicks of the past 10 years. I don't think I've seen a film that made me laugh this hard in a long time. I'm sure the people who hated this film loved the lame American Pie trilogy or the completley unfunny and unorigional Old School.Even the deleted scenes in this film are hilarious. There's one deleted scene that made me cry laughing. It was a parody of west side story involving a booger fight.Take it from me (a comedy writer), Ali G Indahouse is a funny movie worth watching.

853711,AAOMG1YP0VNP9,B0002ZMITY,Chris 'raging bill' Burton,"[22, 29]","Ali G is, in my opinion, one of the best icons of British comedy to come out in the past 10 years. Taking the Mickey out of wannabe ghetto kids, white guys who pretend to be black and ignorant meatheaded idiots all at once whilst winding people up who think his politically incorrect and often stupid comments are serious, he has often reduced me to a fit of laughter on the living room floor. However, this full length film severely misses the mark.First off, the humour lacks any subtlty. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't really a gangster. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't well-endowed and that he didn't really get loads of girls. We didn't need to know that he lived with his mum. We knew he was stupid. Having it all spelt out ruins the image.Secondly, due to the lack of real life situations, there is no opportunity for Sacha Baron Cohen to utilise his quick wit and annoy people. Every joke is pre-planned for the film and rather than being an extension of the hilarious TV show, the film simply takes his character and puts it into a ridiculously unrealistic situation that, although may raise a smile, certainly won't make you laugh out loud.If this is all you've seen of Ali G then do yourself a favour and find some episodes of The 11 O'Clock Show or Da Ali G Show (the latter can be found on his Ali G Aiiiiii video). This film could be worth a watch if you like Ali G, but be warned: the quick wit and comedy genius is replaced with purile humour not much better than The Bloodhound Gang.

This could so easily have been a half hour television programme over-extended to fill a film's running time, but by teaming up with the ever professional writers directors and producers at Working Title, Sacha Baron Cohen has produced a film that really feels like a film. The plot works well, and although there is a small problem over whether Ali G is really cool, or really a bit of a wally (the writing is inconsistent here), he is never an unsympathetic character, even when being selfish or misogynistic. Some of the humour is crude, ppeurile, or even embarrassing, but this is in keeping with the whole Ali G thing, and if you're a fan I doubt you would be offended. The scenes set in the gang land of L.A. are excellent, and wouldn't look out of place in a Steven Segal movie, and believe it or not, these fit in well with the urban decline of Staines and its environs.There is some good support playing by Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, who look a little out of place, but are nevertheless convincing. It was a good idea for Gambon's Prime Minister to be a good guy, so different from the cynicism we normally expect from political comedy. There is a dreadful guest performance from fashion model Naomi Campbell, who looks great but can't act, so it's no surprise that the majority of this ends up in the 'deleted scenes' extra.The soundtrack is superb, clearly having been put together by someone with a good knowledge of Rap and Hip Hop classics of the last twenty years, and this complements the action enormously by lending it some much needed credibility. The extras are good, especially as Ali himself presents the excised scenes with the introduction that they were cut because they were no good!

Gags and storyline take the place of Ali G's unique trademark... interviewing the top talking heads of our generation and getting them to say the most ridiculous things imaginable (My first dose of him was he was interviewing an expert on terrorism and managed to get him to complate how the government could prepare for terrorists crashing a train into the White House...) His victims think they're interviewing a new type of young journalist in touch with the young generation...  the ongoing question being is are they playing along, or really victims of the joke.  That said...As stupid as the concept would seem, this movie is hillarious to the point of brilliance... and by hillarious I mean that even after multiple watchings its still funny.  Beyond the low ANIMAL HOUSE/Howard Stern type humor (which IS funny in itself ) the film is conceptually held together by simply presenting Peter Seller's BEING THERE charactor as a wannabe b-boy - - In doing so, the film is able to have MTV Jackass type humor with a coherent story to boot... the film never ceases to be hllarious.  Contrary to the misconception of some that Ali G is parodying hip hop culture, the film sets asides all doubts of who is charactor really is....  a white boy who lives with his mum, and who's entire world is an MTV music video fantasy.  Cohen's parody sheds ridiculous light on the phenomena of (often) spoiled and bratty suburban white kids pretending to be black and from the hood...  If you've ever wittnessed the strange phenomena of 14 year old suburban mallrats who are just about as gangsta as teflon and Lawrence Welk and unlike a real ""gangsta"" could easily be tamed with a good dose of ridlin and a nice slap across the face (causing their oversized boxer shorts to fall down) this film will crack you up.  - -  The only worse than this are the over-aged30/lives with mum breakdancing old school hip hop fan/wannabe's of which Ali G's is also ""representin'"" - - I wouldn't call the film better than Austin Powers or Wayne`s World, but the parody and satire are way up there...

The series on HBO is spectacular, as Cohen feeds on the Andy Kaufman style of comedy, walking the line between comedy and downright irritation.  Discussing intellectual subjects with experts, Cohen plays Ali G as an ignorant and poorly spoken talk show host, always putting his guests in awkward spots of conversation.  It's brilliant and hilarious to watch, I have not missed an episode yet.That said, this movie is a travesty, and should be skipped by anyone who truly appreciates Cohen's gift.  His style of comedy is best presented in a live situation with off-the-cuff comments and queries.  In this movie, the humor is almost too forced, it lacks spontenaity and more often than not falls into cliched humor and tired jokes.  The plot is not only weak but super predictable.  I do give this two stars instead of one, as there are 3 or 4 jokes that actually did make me laugh.
