Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I did see it.I think it's one of Spike Lee's best movies.  ""He Got Game"" covers lots of issues: interracial dating, black stereotypes, the college athlete, corruption in college athletics, the politics behind sports, the incarceration of Black men, and most of all, a father trying to make amends with his son.""He Got Game"" is loaded with symbolism, each time you see it, you will pick up something new (the kids names: &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot;; the last basketball shot, etc.).Most of all, I recommend this movie to you because I find it touching, and felt emotions that I certainly did not expect from a Spike Lee movie.

445665,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305066345,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","In 2001 Denzel Washington finally won his `Leading Actor' Oscar despite the fact that three of the four remaining nominees put in better performances than he did (those three would be, in descending order, Wilkinson, Crowe and Smith).  I'm not saying that Washington's portrayal of Alonzo in `Training Day' was bad or even mediocre.  He was a pistol, really electrifying the screen with his commanding presence, and he scores major points for taking himself away from the `dead eye stare' I see him give all too often (watch `American Gangster') and really igniting his face.  That said, he still was not the best of the year.I bring up this point, not because I want to raise my voice in disapproval, but because I want to draw a major comparison in character between Alonzo and Washington's character Jake Shuttlesworth in `He Got Game'.  Both characters have that swagger, that jive and that fire, yet Jake is a much deeper and more emotionally complicated character than Alonzo, and Washington plays to his strengths in such a fierce way that I am baffled he wasn't even considered in the running for this performance, yet was handed an Oscar for basically doing the same thing three years later to a less impressive extent.  Washington grabs your attention here, not only with his blunt abrasiveness but also with his human and tortured rawness.`He Got Game' may on the outset look like just another teen sports story.  It centers around Jesus (pronounced like the son of God) Shuttlesworth, a brilliant athlete who is being harassed by every state in the area trying to rally him to their basketball team.  Jesus is not your typical teenager though.  He has been raising his young sister since their father killed their mother and was sent to prison.  Their father is Jake.  Now, Jake is presented with a strange and inviting opportunity; namely to convince his son to join Big State University and in return he'll receive a lighter sentence.  The problem is that since Jake has been locked up Jesus has refused to speak to him, and he has no plans of changing his mind on the matter.  Still, Jake decides that it is worth a try.The underlying story within `He Got Game' is about the path leading to redemption and the sacrifices that we make to get there.  As Jake tries to reestablish some grounds with his son we can see that he needs this; more than freedom he needs the forgiveness that only his son can extend.  Spike Lee brilliantly continues his moral lessons by exposing the corruption and greed within the striving for fame, but Lee never strays away from the purity and admirableness of those who have a clear head and a strong will.So, like I mentioned, Washington is Oscar worthy here, but the rest of the cast is more hit or miss for me.  Ray Allen comes off a little stiff in areas but for the most part he delivers a strong performance alongside Washington.  He has some pristine moments where you can see his internal struggle.  Rosario Dawson is breathtaking as Jesus' girlfriend Lala, but even more than breathtaking she is a wonderful actress here.  She really understands her character and exploits her weaknesses effortlessly.  Milla Jovavich is a little miscast here, and she seems to be `acting' too much, which sadly comes off amateurish in many scenes.  Zelda Harris is also a weaker link, but she was young and so I won't lay into her too hard.  She wasn't a central character and so her few flaws are not detrimental to the film.`He Got Game' is not a masterpiece, I won't go that far, but it is an extremely well crafted vehicle for Lee and Washington to shine as brightly as they are able.  Lee has done better work (`25th Hour' for one) and Washington has done better work (`Malcolm X') but to say that these two men are at the top of their game here would be an understatement.",4,Moving and deep; far more than your average sports film...,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,3815,"['2001', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'finally', 'won', 'Leading', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'fact', 'three', 'four', 'remaining', 'nominees', 'put', 'better', 'performances', 'did', 'three', 'would', 'be', 'descending', 'order', 'Wilkinson', 'Crowe', 'Smith', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Washington', 'portrayal', 'Alonzo', 'Training', 'Day', 'was', 'bad', 'even', 'mediocre', 'was', 'pistol', 'really', 'electrifying', 'screen', 'commanding', 'presence', 'major', 'points', 'taking', 'away', 'dead', 'eye', 'stare', 'see', 'give', 'too', 'often', 'watch', 'American', 'Gangster', 'really', 'igniting', 'face', 'said', 'still', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'year.I', 'bring', 'up', 'point', 'not', 'want', 'raise', 'voice', 'disapproval', 'want', 'draw', 'major', 'comparison', 'character', 'Alonzo', 'Washington', 'character', 'Jake', 'Shuttlesworth', 'Got', 'Game', 'characters', 'have', 'swagger', 'jive', 'fire', 'yet', 'Jake', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'emotionally', 'complicated', 'character', 'Alonzo', 'Washington', 'strengths', 'such', 'fierce', 'way', 'am', 'baffled', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'considered', 'running', 'performance', 'was', 'handed', 'Oscar', 'basically', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'less', 'impressive', 'extent', 'Washington', 'attention', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'blunt', 'abrasiveness', 'also', 'human', 'tortured', 'rawness.', 'Got', 'Game', 'may', 'outset', 'look', 'just', 'teen', 'sports', 'story', 'Jesus', 'pronounced', 'son', 'God', 'Shuttlesworth', 'brilliant', 'athlete', 'who', 'being', 'harassed', 'state', 'area', 'trying', 'rally', 'basketball', 'team', 'Jesus', 'not', 'typical', 'teenager', 'been', 'raising', 'young', 'sister', 'father', 'killed', 'mother', 'was', 'sent', 'prison', 'father', 'Jake', 'Now', 'Jake', 'presented', 'strange', 'inviting', 'opportunity', 'namely', 'convince', 'son', 'join', 'Big', 'State', 'University', 'return', ""'ll"", 'receive', 'lighter', 'sentence', 'problem', 'Jake', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'Jesus', 'refused', 'speak', 'plans', 'changing', 'mind', 'matter', 'Still', 'Jake', 'try.The', 'underlying', 'story', 'Got', 'Game', 'path', 'leading', 'redemption', 'sacrifices', 'make', 'get', 'there', 'Jake', 'reestablish', 'grounds', 'son', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'freedom', 'forgiveness', 'only', 'son', 'can', 'extend', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'brilliantly', 'moral', 'lessons', 'exposing', 'corruption', 'greed', 'striving', 'fame', 'Lee', 'never', 'away', 'purity', 'admirableness', 'who', 'have', 'clear', 'head', 'strong', 'will.So', 'mentioned', 'Washington', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'here', 'rest', 'cast', 'more', 'hit', 'miss', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'off', 'little', 'stiff', 'areas', 'most', 'part', 'strong', 'performance', 'Washington', 'pristine', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'internal', 'struggle', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'breathtaking', 'Jesus', 'girlfriend', 'Lala', 'even', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'here', 'really', 'character', 'weaknesses', 'effortlessly', 'Milla', 'Jovavich', 'little', 'miscast', 'here', 'be', 'acting', 'too', 'much', 'sadly', 'off', 'amateurish', 'many', 'scenes', 'Zelda', 'Harris', 'also', 'weaker', 'link', 'was', 'young', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lay', 'too', 'hard', 'was', ""n't"", 'central', 'character', 'so', 'few', 'flaws', 'are', 'not', 'detrimental', 'film.', 'Got', 'Game', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'extremely', 'well', 'crafted', 'vehicle', 'Lee', 'Washington', 'shine', 'as', 'brightly', 'are', 'able', 'Lee', 'done', 'better', 'work', '25th', 'Hour', 'one', 'Washington', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'say', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'understatement']",N/A

Ray Allen is terrific in his lead role and, despite what everybody else says, is a natural actor. On the other hand, Denzel Washington is being Denzel every minute. It gets old and repetitive. There is a lot of rip-off scenes in He Got Misogyny from Hoop Dreams. That's typical of Spike Lee for being the hack he is. At least, he doesn't attempt to push the race card in this one although it is interesting to note how badly women are treated and are viewed as sexual objects (Spike's misogyny?) in his picture. Certainly, there is a good message in He Got Misogyny, but Hoop Dreams is perfect in doing it so. If critics and viewers alike hated He Got Misogyny, it's because they got jealous by the sex scenes and how many women (read that as porn stars) the ballplayers were getting. I think it was just too much for a film, and I get the message already. The weakest subplot of the film is the relationship between the father and the hooker. Eventually, without a doubt, he will be tested positive for at least five different types of sexually transmitted disease. No matter how many times I see He Got Misogyny, I will never understand why Jesus signed the letter of intent. It makes more sense if he had forsaken his father for the rest of his life considering that he was extremely hard on him and also killed his mother. Of course, everybody was taking advantage of Jesus, so it doesn't matter anyway. All in all, He Got Misogyny is not bad of a film since I kept an open mind after I initially hated it back in 1998.",4,He Got Misogyny Is a Hoop Dreams Rip-off.,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1640,"['Viewed', '8/13Rate', '88/13', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'awful', 'films', 'Got', 'Misogyny', 'one', 'few', 'better', 'ones', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'terrific', 'lead', 'role', 'what', 'everybody', 'else', 'natural', 'actor', 'other', 'hand', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'being', 'Denzel', 'minute', 'old', 'repetitive', 'lot', 'rip-off', 'scenes', 'Got', 'Misogyny', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'typical', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'being', 'hack', 'least', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'push', 'race', 'card', 'one', 'interesting', 'note', 'how', 'badly', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'are', 'viewed', 'sexual', 'objects', 'Spike', 'misogyny', 'picture', 'Certainly', 'good', 'message', 'Got', 'Misogyny', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'perfect', 'doing', 'so', 'critics', 'viewers', 'alike', 'hated', 'Got', 'Misogyny', 'got', 'jealous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'how', 'many', 'women', 'read', 'porn', 'stars', 'ballplayers', 'were', 'getting', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'get', 'message', 'already', 'weakest', 'subplot', 'film', 'relationship', 'father', 'hooker', 'Eventually', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'positive', 'least', 'five', 'different', 'types', 'sexually', 'transmitted', 'disease', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'Got', 'Misogyny', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'Jesus', 'signed', 'letter', 'intent', 'more', 'sense', 'had', 'forsaken', 'father', 'rest', 'life', 'considering', 'was', 'extremely', 'hard', 'also', 'killed', 'mother', 'course', 'everybody', 'was', 'taking', 'advantage', 'Jesus', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anyway', 'Got', 'Misogyny', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'kept', 'open', 'mind', 'initially', 'hated', 'back', '1998']",N/A

445669,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,6305066345,Birdman,"[13, 14]","Spike Lee is such a talented filmmaker, one wonders why he took sucha fine script, marvelous cinemotography, thematic complexity and consistently fine performances -- then perforated everything with gratuitous sex.Certainly, professional scouts lure college athletes with excess, but the manner in which Lee drops sex into the action here limits the audience for an otherwise outstanding film and interrupts the emotional resonance its characters evoke.The film recounts a convicted father's effort to free himself from  prison for accidently killing his wife. He does so by trying to persuade his son, a gifted basketball player,to attend the governor's university, ""Big State,"" because governor is a fan.The film has layers of plot and meaning woven together seamlessly. There is a father's effort to redeem himself in his son's eyes , to do penance in memory of his beloved wife. In all, Lee recounts the process of forgiveness with compassion and accuracy.Beneath these layers, Lee explores the Faustian drama of professional athletics in a corrupt society.  He exposes the manner in which business corporations and big education elevate athletic talent for their selfish ends, often asting aside decency and ethical sensibility.The score, combining the music of Aaron Copland and Public Enemy, is oddly moving, without a trace of affectation.Gratuitous sex aside -- this film confirms Spike Lee as one of our most moral filmmakers.  While his output is inconsistent, his great films are just that. They are permanent and well-crafted, ethically sound and constructive.In his role as Jake, Denzel Washington turns out one of his greatest performances.

Denzel Washington was superb as always, as the jailed father of a basketball player, who is allowed out of jail to help convince his semi-estranged son to attend a certain university. Washington is convincing. His sexual escapades with the relatively untalented Milla Jovovich are not all that believable, although I guess if I had been in prison for so long I might consider Jovovich also. The real life basketball player who plays the basketball star who has to choose his path is all right.

The mother is dead, killed accidentally in a temper but the father. The father is in prison for a very long time. The son hates his father and has to learn how to get over his hatred. The daughter is missing her father but her brother is isolating her. The uncle and aunt only see the money the son represents. He is a high school star in basketball and he can get directly into making a lot of money if he joins the NBA or he can go to some university and have a scholarship. One more tricky element: the governor wants the kid for the team of his university, the one he sponsors and likes. So why not use the father, give him a week of semi freedom and force him thus to negotiate his son's signing the right papers. What's more the basketball star is invited by some schools to come and visit and there he is provided with everything he may desire, including the girls and the useless other entertainments. The NBA is offering a car to the uncle, though in fact it is for the son to run it. And the high school coach is able to put ten thousand dollars on the table for him to join, guess what, the NBA of course. Immoral. The film is saved from this muddy marshlandish country by the son choosing the only moral solution, the one that will help his father to get out faster, the one that is going to cure him from his hatred, even if that is slightly idealistic, frankly utopian.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,Inner strife and self hatred are the worst enemies,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,1641,"['film', 'real', 'crossroads', 'where', 'Blacks', 'are', 'America', 'say', 'Blacks', 'call', 'Blacks', 'not', 'Afro-Americans', 'African', 'Americans', 'mother', 'dead', 'killed', 'accidentally', 'temper', 'father', 'father', 'prison', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'son', 'father', 'learn', 'how', 'get', 'hatred', 'daughter', 'missing', 'father', 'brother', 'isolating', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'only', 'see', 'money', 'son', 'high', 'school', 'star', 'basketball', 'can', 'get', 'directly', 'making', 'lot', 'money', 'NBA', 'can', 'go', 'university', 'have', 'scholarship', 'One', 'more', 'tricky', 'element', 'governor', 'kid', 'team', 'university', 'one', 'likes', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'use', 'father', 'give', 'week', 'semi', 'freedom', 'force', 'thus', 'negotiate', 'son', 'signing', 'right', 'papers', 'What', 'more', 'basketball', 'star', 'invited', 'schools', 'come', 'visit', 'provided', 'everything', 'may', 'desire', 'including', 'girls', 'useless', 'other', 'entertainments', 'NBA', 'offering', 'car', 'uncle', 'fact', 'son', 'run', 'high', 'school', 'coach', 'able', 'put', 'ten', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'table', 'join', 'guess', 'what', 'NBA', 'course', 'Immoral', 'film', 'saved', 'muddy', 'marshlandish', 'country', 'son', 'choosing', 'only', 'moral', 'solution', 'one', 'will', 'help', 'father', 'get', 'out', 'faster', 'one', 'going', 'cure', 'hatred', 'even', 'slightly', 'idealistic', 'frankly', 'utopian.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

445688,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,6305066345,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[15, 20]","I love Denzel Washington. I mean, I absolutely adore this man...he never gives a less than credible performance in any role he plays. Once again, he delivers as a less-than-perfect father in ""He Got Game"". This is more than a story about basketball - it's about human relationships, the bond between a father and son, and how that prevails even in the worst of circumstances.The story, set in the Coney Island housing projects in Brooklyn, NY (where it was also filmed), surrounds Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel) who has been imprisoned in Attica for the accidental murder of his wife. His son, Jesus (Ray Allen), a high school basketball star who is being hotly pursued to either go into college or sign with the NBA, has nothing but contempt and disgust for his father. If Jake can convince his estranged son to attend a certain university and sign a letter of intent, then his time will be reduced significantly, since this school also happens to be the governor's alma mater.It starts off with a lot of promise, when Jake is allowed out of prison for a week to try to talk to his son. But after a while, the plot starts to wear thin when Jake keeps approaching Jesus, and Jesus is always telling Jake to leave him alone. How long can this be stretched out before you get tired of the whole thing? Okay, you can throw in flashbacks of Jesus as a child and how his father pushed him hard to play ball; a scheming, opportunistic girlfriend (Rosario Dawson); money-hungry friends and relatives; and plenty of tempting offers to either take money, sign with the NBA, go to this college and so forth to thicken the plot. Everyone seems to want something from Jesus, and as a result he has very little trust for anyone around him, and understandably so. But even that tends to get monotonous because you keep hearing the same type of dialogue, only from different characters. But stay with it.This movie does show realistic situations that face talented high-school prospects that can play basketball, so Spike was on point with this. However, it is not the first film that touched upon this subject. There was also ""Blue Chips"" that had Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee (Penny) Hardaway in it as students/basketball players being heavily recruited for colleges and how they were being paid off, depending on what their decision would be. (At the time this movie was out, both Shaq and Penny were members of the Orlando Magic.)Ray Allen is an NBA basketball player in real life, but he is NO ACTOR, just like Shaq and Penny aren't actors, either. Whatever scenes Allen appeared in were kind of painful to watch because the man just has no skills in that area. He does try, though. And the rest of the cast aren't much better, most notably Milla Jovovich. She plays a grimy and pathetic prostitute who is repeatedly abused by her pimp. I found it difficult to believe that Denzel or any man would find her to be desirable. But then again, Denzel as Jake was just coming out of prison, so...I also disliked the fact that Spike had to throw in so many sex scenes. I normally enjoy Spike's films, but why must he exploit women? He makes them look like they are nothing more than lowlife sexual playthings who are out to use men for what they have. ""He Got Game"" runs rampant with this, even casting porn star Heather Hunter in one of many (unnecessary) sex scenes! What the hell?! Although Spike does it on a smaller scale in his other movies, and always has, it didn't bother me as much as it did in this film. It was excessive. I understand the point that Spike was trying to make, but come on - couldn't he leave a little SOMETHING to the imagination?""He Got Game"" is definitely worth watching. Not perfect, but not a waste of time, either.

He is released on parole, but with one condition - he must persuade his son, genius basketball player Jesus to sign with the governor's alma mater university, Big State. And Jake only has a week to do it. Spike Lee's He Got Game is a beautifully shot and well-executed exploration of the role that the sport of basketball plays in the relationship between a father and his estranged son. The definitive sense of Spike's style that was quite apparent throughout this movie.

This was easily Lee's best film since Malcolm X in 1992.At first, moviegoers may be inclined to think that He Got Game will be little more than a slam-dunk fest that will showcase the athletic talent of its lead actor, Ray Allen (one of the NBA's premier players). Truth be told, however, He Got Game is more a sentimental drama than a sports movie, and the film focuses primarily on the behind-the-scenes pressures, temptations, and betrayals that often confront athletes as they are recruited by major universities or establish their professional careers.  Spike Lee does a nice job of poignantly depicting the complex issues of money, sex, groupies, and greedy agents who prey on aspiring young athletes.Although not a professional actor, Ray Allen does a splendid job in his role as Jesus Shuttlesworth - a high school senior who is faced with the difficult, high-pressure decision of which college he will attend the following fall. Denzell Washington delievers a spectacular performance as always, this time playing Jesus's father (Jake Shuttlesworth) who is serving a prison sentence for involunarity killing his wife. His mother's accidental death fuels Jesus's intense hatred for his father, but now his father is under pressure from the state governor to persuade Jesus to play basketball for the governor's alma mater. If Jesus agrees to do so, the governor has agreed to commute Jake's sentence. The beautiful Rosario Dawson is quite convincing as Jesus's gold-digging girlfriend with ulterior motives.Fans of Spike Lee's films will notice several of Spike's regulars returning in cameo appearances in He Got Game, including John Turturro, Lonetta McKee, and Bill Nunn. Basketball personalities such as Dick Vitale, John Thompson, and Rick Fox also appear in the film, adding a sense of realism to the plot.Much more than a simple basketball film, He Got Game tackles issues of race, class, exploitation, and family relationships. Interestingly enough, Spike Lee employs much more sex in this film than he usually does - porn star Heather Hunter appears in a cameo and Rosario Dawson delivers a sex scene of her own. The most graphic sex scene involves a menage-a-trois between Jesus and two blonde groupies during a recruiting visit to a prospective college.Ultimately, Jesus discovers that the man he hates most is the cares most for him. Jake does not exploit his son, nor does he manipulate Jesus for personal gain.He Got Game is a sentimental drama that should appeal to any sports fan, and the acting is complemented by a great soundtrack. Unfortunately, the DVD lacks extras - only a theatrical trailer is provided. An interview with the director or Ray Allen (discussing real-life experiences with the issues dealt with in the film) would have been a great addition.",4,One of the best basketball dramas,1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,2919,"['producing', 'mediocre', 'stuff', 'Crooklyn', 'Bamboozled', 'mid-1990s', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'rebounded', 'strongly', '1998', 'Got', 'Game', 'was', 'easily', 'Lee', 'best', 'film', 'Malcolm', 'X', '1992.At', 'first', 'moviegoers', 'may', 'be', 'inclined', 'think', 'Got', 'Game', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'slam-dunk', 'fest', 'will', 'showcase', 'athletic', 'talent', 'lead', 'actor', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'one', 'NBA', 'premier', 'players', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'however', 'Got', 'Game', 'more', 'sentimental', 'drama', 'sports', 'movie', 'film', 'primarily', 'behind-the-scenes', 'pressures', 'temptations', 'betrayals', 'often', 'confront', 'athletes', 'are', 'recruited', 'major', 'universities', 'establish', 'professional', 'careers', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'nice', 'job', 'poignantly', 'depicting', 'complex', 'issues', 'money', 'sex', 'groupies', 'greedy', 'agents', 'who', 'prey', 'aspiring', 'young', 'not', 'professional', 'actor', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'splendid', 'job', 'role', 'Jesus', 'Shuttlesworth', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'faced', 'difficult', 'high-pressure', 'decision', 'college', 'will', 'attend', 'following', 'fall', 'Denzell', 'Washington', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'always', 'time', 'playing', 'Jesus', 'father', 'Jake', 'Shuttlesworth', 'who', 'serving', 'prison', 'sentence', 'involunarity', 'killing', 'wife', 'mother', 'accidental', 'death', 'fuels', 'Jesus', 'intense', 'hatred', 'father', 'now', 'father', 'pressure', 'state', 'governor', 'persuade', 'Jesus', 'play', 'basketball', 'governor', 'alma', 'mater', 'Jesus', 'do', 'so', 'governor', 'agreed', 'commute', 'Jake', 'sentence', 'beautiful', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'quite', 'convincing', 'Jesus', 'gold-digging', 'girlfriend', 'ulterior', 'motives.Fans', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'films', 'will', 'notice', 'several', 'Spike', 'regulars', 'returning', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Got', 'Game', 'including', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Lonetta', 'McKee', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Basketball', 'personalities', 'such', 'Dick', 'Vitale', 'John', 'Thompson', 'Rick', 'Fox', 'also', 'appear', 'film', 'adding', 'sense', 'realism', 'plot.Much', 'more', 'simple', 'basketball', 'film', 'Got', 'Game', 'tackles', 'issues', 'race', 'class', 'exploitation', 'family', 'relationships', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'much', 'more', 'sex', 'film', 'usually', 'porn', 'star', 'Heather', 'Hunter', 'cameo', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'sex', 'scene', 'own', 'most', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'menage-a-trois', 'Jesus', 'two', 'blonde', 'groupies', 'recruiting', 'visit', 'prospective', 'college.Ultimately', 'Jesus', 'man', 'most', 'cares', 'most', 'Jake', 'not', 'exploit', 'son', 'manipulate', 'Jesus', 'personal', 'gain.He', 'Got', 'Game', 'sentimental', 'drama', 'should', 'appeal', 'sports', 'fan', 'acting', 'complemented', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'extras', 'only', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'provided', 'interview', 'director', 'Ray', 'Allen', 'discussing', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'issues', 'dealt', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'addition']",N/A
