1136593,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B0012EI8BQ,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","The Lone Ranger was one of the truly iconic shows from the early day of television, and thrilled kids and adults alike from 1949 through the early 60s, although for many of those years nothing but re-runs were shown (there were only five seasons of original episodes produced). In the process, Clayton Moore became a beloved figure for the rest of his life, making a good living from personal appearances as the Lone Ranger for most of the rest of his days.All but one of the episodes in this product are from 1949, and they are in amazingly good shape for TV from that era. I docked a star because the opening and closing were cut from most of the episodes. They frame the episodes on each DVD, rather than each episode itself. That was disappointing, since frankly the opening and closing to each episode were salient features of the series.In appreciating this series, you have to get yourself in the frame of mind of audiences in the middle of the last century. ""The Lone Ranger"" had thrived through the 30s and 40s as radio and movie serials before coming to TV, and the TV show retained much of the spirit of the radio broadcasts, with stylized dialogue and imposing voice-overs. Tonto speaks in stereo-typical ""Indian speak"", with contrived poor grammar and often stilted delivery. The Lone Ranger often speaks with exaggerated enunciation in a ""heroic"" manner. LOLHowever, most of the acting is surprisingly natural and good, particularly since most of the supporting cast were veterans of years of the myriad westerns shot in the 30s and 40s.For its time, ""The Lone Ranger"" had a remarkably advanced attitude towards ""Indian"" relations. At a time when many westerns were still portraying ""Indians"" as savage murderers preying on simple defenseless settlers, in ""The Lone Ranger"" they are depicted with dignity, and often as victims of unscrupulous ""white men"".The price on this set is trivial to get a taste of the early days of this series. It includes the three part ""origin"" story, and during its course you'll even get the treat of seeing DeForest Kelly in one of his many western roles before his ""name role"" as Doctor McCoy on Star Trek.I'll never forget watching The Lone Ranger myself, then heading into the back yard as a 4 year old to ride the teeter totter like crazy while exclaiming, ""Hi Yo Silver ...

1136614,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0012EI8BQ,Only-A-Child,"[81, 83]","The 221 episodes of ""The Lone Ranger"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication.  For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming.This new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 Sept-29 Dec 1949) and for some unknown reason episode 22 from the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain).  These sets pretty much render ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases.These early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voiceover narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments.The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance.  The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started out Texas Ranger John Reid.  The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to Lone Ranger status, his partnering with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the taming of his horse ""Silver"".There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode.  The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil.  While a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an Indian was distrusted, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil.  One persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value.  The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: ""who was that masked man?"".To really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be.  If you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated.Then again, what do I know?

And did it all very well.On thing about seeing the series compilation is that it's obvious that he did his bounding onto Sliver, fight/stuntwork himself. His sort of (now) corny style and morals I think reflected his own character.There have been many parodies about such TV characters taking their roles too serious; Moore took it just right.Re mom and the Long Ranger: They dated briefly. Then mom made a big mistake. Sher brought him home to meether room mate, Sally. Kismet or just a BOINGGG!, Clayton and Sally clicked. They were quickly happily married andlived happily ever after. Don't know what happened to Silver, or Tonto, for that matter.These episodes are, incidentally, REALLY entertaining, more so than I remembered them to be. Action, Western ethics,social commentary, insight into people, times then (both in Hollywood and in the fictional West). In both casts, oftenunintentionally funny.
