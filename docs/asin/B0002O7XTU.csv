I was just going to check it out, thinking it would be a trashy re-hash of a formerly great original movie and I would probably shut it off after the first twenty minutes, but I was really surprised.Berenger, always a great looking guy in my book, definitely WAS heavier, and somewhat 'lumbering'  but oddly, looked pretty good in the face for his age...and didn't look 'facelifted.""I would love to see this guy with another 20 pounds off--he would, I swear, look VERY close to how he used to, 25 years ago.  Regardless, there  has always been something about him, even now,  in that he can always hold your interest on the screen, with a kind of no-nonsense, sexy tough guy with a heart, the character that he always plays.And the fact that he was the first choice for this mission to Asia still made sense, because, due to his former relationship with the target from 30 years before during the Vietnam war, he was the one who could get closest to him.  So that part was not really a problem for me.The young asian cop was EXCELLENT...sorry I don't have his name here.  He was taut, believeable, charismatic, had the looks, charm and the hard edge..and he really was a good foil for the older Berenger.And the twists and turns of the plot kept me interested thru the whole movie.

842203,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B0002O7XTU,moviemusicbuff,"[12, 14]","This time around Thomas Beckett is sent out by NSA to track down and kill a druglord in Vietnam who happens to be his good friend whom he fought alongside in the war.  Beckett is in for surprises as he finds out more details about his mission and about the reasons why he is sent there.  He also partners with a local cop in Ho Chi Minh City, who is trained in martial arts.Like Sniper 2, this movie looks low budget and features unknown actors, whose acting are just adequate (except the Vietnamese cop, who did a good job). Tom Berenger, however, is always good and makes up for the bad acting done by some of the others.There are some things in this movie that are different:a) It reveals more about Beckett's personal life than the other two films (e.g. his past, his friendships, his emotional side, etc.)b) Some of the action is influenced by the Hong Kong action style, with the shoot-outs done in slow motion, and Beckett's partner getting to use his martial arts expertise to eliminate some of the bad guys.c) Tom Berenger has gained a few more pounds since Sniper 2 and he seems to lumber rather than run. (He needs to shed some weight in order to be believable as a Marine Sniper.)  However, to the script's credit, Beckett gets in trouble with his superior for his drinking and his lack of physical fitness.I gave this movie 3 stars because it could have been a lot better, given a bigger budget, better story, well-known actors and accomplished directors that we recognize.

842207,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002O7XTU,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","For those who still remember the terrific acting of Tom Berenger in Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' it is painful to watch him in 'Sniper 3' (which is also set in Vietnam).  Not that the film is a complete failure.  Actually, Tom Berenger's performace as the veteran sniper Thomas Beckett is fairly good, if not his best.  But the film's lazy direction (from the director of 'From the Dusk till Dawn: 3' ... no wonder) is too conspicous, killing the potential that some of the actions and characters might have.Not much can be called original about the script of 'Sniper 3.'  Thomas Beckett is sent to Vietnam, where he fought his war with his buddy during the war 30 years ago.  But Beckett is informed that the friend who is supposed to be dead is now ruling the underground community as druglord (the idea inspired by 'Apocalypse Now').  And Beckett's assignment is to kill him.Byron Mann appears as Sgt. Beckett's partner from Vietnam, and Thailand provides the convincing locations for the backdrop.  Both actors did good acting, and the film tries to show the deeper characterization about Beckett, who talks about his old days, and even attends a wedding party (not drunk for that matter).  The results of the efforts are not bad.But the actions are so-so at best, with shoddy editing that often makes me wonder what is going on.  For example, after Beckett's first 'hit,' a shoot-out scene at the rooftop begins, but as the film fails to show who is shooting (at) who, the sequence only shows alternately the confusing images of men shooting guns and men who got shot.  And I still do not fully understand what happened in the last chapter, the terribly hurried and awfully incoherent wrap-up that comes with bamboo impalement.  Excuse me, but I thought this is about a sniper's story...right?Though the film is watchable thanks to the actors and locale, 'Sniper 3' reminds us of the fact that we really need somebody who can save Tom Berenger from this Grade B straight-to-video hell.",2,Give Tom Berenger a Chance; He Deserves a Better Film Than This Badly Told B-Movie,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,1987,"['who', 'still', 'remember', 'terrific', 'acting', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Oliver', 'Stone', ""'Platoon"", 'painful', 'watch', '3', 'also', 'set', 'Vietnam', 'Not', 'film', 'complete', 'failure', 'Actually', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'performace', 'veteran', 'sniper', 'Thomas', 'Beckett', 'fairly', 'good', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'lazy', 'direction', 'director', 'Dusk', 'till', 'Dawn', '3', 'wonder', 'too', 'conspicous', 'killing', 'potential', 'actions', 'characters', 'might', 'have.Not', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'original', 'script', '3', 'Thomas', 'Beckett', 'sent', 'Vietnam', 'where', 'fought', 'war', 'buddy', 'war', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Beckett', 'informed', 'friend', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'dead', 'now', 'ruling', 'underground', 'community', 'druglord', 'idea', 'inspired', ""'Apocalypse"", 'Now', 'Beckett', 'assignment', 'kill', 'him.Byron', 'Mann', 'Sgt', 'Beckett', 'partner', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand', 'convincing', 'locations', 'backdrop', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'acting', 'film', 'tries', 'show', 'deeper', 'characterization', 'Beckett', 'who', 'old', 'days', 'even', 'wedding', 'party', 'not', 'drunk', 'matter', 'results', 'efforts', 'are', 'not', 'actions', 'are', 'so-so', 'best', 'shoddy', 'editing', 'often', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'example', 'Beckett', 'first', ""'hit"", 'shoot-out', 'scene', 'rooftop', 'film', 'show', 'who', 'shooting', 'who', 'sequence', 'only', 'alternately', 'confusing', 'images', 'men', 'shooting', 'guns', 'men', 'who', 'got', 'shot', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'last', 'chapter', 'terribly', 'hurried', 'awfully', 'incoherent', 'wrap-up', 'bamboo', 'impalement', 'thought', 'sniper', 'story', 'right', 'film', 'watchable', 'thanks', 'actors', 'locale', '3', 'reminds', 'fact', 'really', 'need', 'somebody', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Grade', 'B', 'straight-to-video', 'hell']",Sniper 3
