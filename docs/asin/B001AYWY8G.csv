1169101,A3KMMXLJFQENDZ,B001AYWY8G,Alex A. Fintonis,"[0, 0]","I have seen numerous bad horror films in my life, and I have to say there are many that are so bad they are great.  This film is so bad it is bad.  Bad acting in horror films can be overcome with good gore effects, an original idea, or just an over the top script, but this film had none of that.Firstly the camera work was just horrendous.  It was so muddy I could hardly see a darn thing.  But the worst part was how jittery it was I couldn't focus on anything or anyone.  Now when a film is shot in the first person I still my not like it but I can understand it.  Films such as Blair Witch, Cloverfield, etc. are some examples, it worked for the story. But in this movie there is not one character with a video camera, so the shaking of the camera was beyond annoying, it gave me a major headache.As far as the characters are concerned, where should I begin, firstly the screaming between the girls through out the film is constant.  Each girl does not stop screaming at the other until the film ends or they die.  There really is not much to say about this I recommend if one watches this film the do so with the mute button.  Trust me you will not miss anything.  The plot is that bad as well.I do not have a problem with amateur film making.  I have seen many amateur films I have enjoyed.  This film however was below anything amateur at all.  It was if bunch of kids took their dad's camcorder from 1993 and their mom's mini van and drove out into a rural area and just shot the whole film off the top of their heads.This film should not have been made.  To call it anything above garbage would be giving this film a complement.",1,"beyond bad, way beyond",1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1637,"['have', 'seen', 'numerous', 'bad', 'horror', 'films', 'life', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'bad', 'Bad', 'acting', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'good', 'gore', 'effects', 'original', 'idea', 'just', 'top', 'script', 'film', 'had', 'none', 'that.Firstly', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'just', 'horrendous', 'was', 'so', 'muddy', 'could', 'hardly', 'see', 'darn', 'thing', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'how', 'jittery', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'focus', 'anything', 'anyone', 'Now', 'when', 'film', 'shot', 'first', 'person', 'still', 'not', 'can', 'understand', 'Films', 'such', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Cloverfield', 'etc', 'are', 'examples', 'worked', 'story', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'character', 'video', 'camera', 'shaking', 'camera', 'was', 'annoying', 'gave', 'major', 'headache.As', 'far', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'where', 'should', 'begin', 'firstly', 'screaming', 'girls', 'film', 'constant', 'girl', 'not', 'stop', 'screaming', 'other', 'film', 'die', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'recommend', 'one', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'mute', 'button', 'Trust', 'will', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'plot', 'bad', 'well.I', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'amateur', 'film', 'making', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'amateur', 'films', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'anything', 'amateur', 'was', 'bunch', 'kids', 'took', 'dad', 'camcorder', '1993', 'mom', 'mini', 'van', 'drove', 'out', 'rural', 'area', 'just', 'shot', 'whole', 'film', 'top', 'heads.This', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'call', 'anything', 'garbage', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'film', 'complement']",N/A
1169102,A26HD3S38PLD5A,B001AYWY8G,"BO BO BOB ""WESLEY""","[2, 3]","A laborious attempt at a psycho stalker flick. This movie should have been called, ""Five Across My Last D*&^ Nerve.""  While this movie may have been more reallistic as for how normal people would react if put in such a situation, all the screaming, crying and confusion made for one irritating movie. Jamie's crying in particular pounced on  my last nerve. The scenery was also too limited with poor lighting. This movie obviously had no budget as everything happened either in or just outside the van . In such a case, with limited sets the personalities of the actors beomes more important. And since these five girls, who did  a good acting job, were crying most of the time, their wasn't much room to really get to know/like them. There was also no rhyme or reason why the psycho was after them and no clue who the other dead people were in the psycho's vehicle. I do like the way that once they starting wacking the pshyco chick, they didn't stop wacking her the way most stupidly do in most horror flicks. The movie was just an exercise in terror. This movie easily could have been better. For instance, what if two young guys, about the girls age, had seen their lights and stopped to help , only to be injured by the pshyco. There could have been a romantic angle with at least one of the girls. This would have made the movie more interesting. Also, for all that torture and stalking, the killer did not kill any of the girls. Who cared about the dead people in the back of the psycho's vehicle?  We did not even get to see their faces. Now what if the girls had run across those people at the store. At least their would have been some connection. If the idea was woman power, it took a long time to get to that point. And that point got lost in all the crying and confusion. Just like all the crying and confusion I am now exhibiting since I cannot get a refund at Wal-Mart.This movie was not very good, but it deserves maybe a 1.5 After all, Ben Afflek and George Clooney movies have a patten on a -1- rating.",1,"Shut Up, Shut Up, Shut Up  Somebody Kill Somebody",1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,2021,"['laborious', 'attempt', 'psycho', 'stalker', 'flick', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Five', 'Across', 'My', 'Last', 'D*', '^', 'Nerve', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'reallistic', 'how', 'normal', 'people', 'would', 'react', 'put', 'such', 'situation', 'screaming', 'crying', 'confusion', 'made', 'one', 'irritating', 'movie', 'Jamie', 'crying', 'particular', 'pounced', 'last', 'nerve', 'scenery', 'was', 'also', 'too', 'limited', 'poor', 'lighting', 'movie', 'obviously', 'had', 'budget', 'everything', 'happened', 'just', 'van', 'such', 'case', 'limited', 'sets', 'personalities', 'actors', 'more', 'important', 'five', 'girls', 'who', 'did', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'were', 'crying', 'most', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'room', 'really', 'get', 'know/like', 'was', 'also', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'why', 'psycho', 'was', 'clue', 'who', 'other', 'dead', 'people', 'were', 'psycho', 'vehicle', 'do', 'way', 'once', 'starting', 'wacking', 'pshyco', 'chick', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'wacking', 'way', 'most', 'stupidly', 'do', 'most', 'horror', 'flicks', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'exercise', 'terror', 'movie', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'instance', 'what', 'two', 'young', 'guys', 'girls', 'age', 'had', 'seen', 'lights', 'stopped', 'help', 'only', 'be', 'injured', 'pshyco', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'romantic', 'angle', 'least', 'one', 'girls', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'Also', 'torture', 'stalking', 'killer', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'girls', 'Who', 'cared', 'dead', 'people', 'back', 'psycho', 'vehicle', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'Now', 'what', 'girls', 'had', 'run', 'people', 'store', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'connection', 'idea', 'was', 'woman', 'power', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'got', 'lost', 'crying', 'confusion', 'Just', 'crying', 'confusion', 'am', 'now', 'exhibiting', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'refund', 'Wal-Mart.This', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'maybe', '1.5', 'Ben', 'Afflek', 'George', 'Clooney', 'movies', 'have', 'patten', '-1-', 'rating']",N/A
1169103,AJLPBMAJKIKOK,B001AYWY8G,Christopher Thomas Rennirt,"[3, 5]","Five Across the Eyes is a truly horrible movie.  However, before you interpret that, stop and think.  Shouldn't all good horror movies be horrible?  Well, Five Across the Eyes is indeed truly horrible in just about every way.  As I watched the movie, I wanted to dislike it, but somehow I couldn't.  Somehow, I liked it anyway, despite its flaws, its sometimes annoying dialogue, its frequent sub-par acting, and other nauseating, stomach-churning acts of depravity.What's it about?  It's simple.  A group of five teenage girls are out, driving on a remote Tennessee road called The Eyes (hence, Five across the Eyes).  They become hopelessly lost, and that's just the start the horror to come.  There's car chases and car chases (yes, I repeated that on purpose), lots of screaming, yelling, cursing, vomiting, and violence (violence which may not be gratuitous, under the circumstances), and overkill unlike overkill you've seen before (I guarantee it!).  Truly appreciating this movie requires watching it till the end; trust me on that!  Here, the climax of revenge is what we always wish for in such movies but rarely see.  In an odd and sick, but well-earned way, the ending is one of the most well-thought ways to solve a problem.  Yes, rarely do we see such morbid intelligence in a movie of this kind.  Compared to the typical dumb victims in most horror films, the girls in this movie are geniuses.The film is certainly as low budget as low budget gets, but that's the charm here.  The acting is bad at times, but the actors have the excuse of likely never having acted before.  The dialogue is sometimes bad, but likely no worse than what real people (in this case, teenagers) really say when they're out driving, at night, lost, in the middle of nowhere.  The film is dark and grainy, sometimes making it difficult to know what's going on, even when the camera is on it; however, as the viewer, we get the feeling that we're lucky to be seeing it at all.  The camerawork is a shaky mess of ultra-realistic, real-time action that could arguably be called more coincidence than planning, but again, that's the charm.  With such frenetic movement (car chases and running on foot), the viewer becomes as nauseated as the victims in the movie.  It's what we see and don't see, sometimes by chance, through the lens of a handheld camera that, again, gives this movie its charm.  Yes, the charm is often in what we don't see but nonetheless know and see too well if not better in our own minds.  (The scene with the toolbox dental job comes to mind here quite vividly.)  As the voyeur in this movie, we are treated to more or less, for better or worse.  One often wants to see more of what one shouldn't see, sometimes forced to settle for ample off-screen screams and groans, while other times seeing what is arguably too much.  Yes, this is all nonetheless ""horrible"", as again, maybe good horror films certainly should be.  Just to know what is happening should be enough; however, we often feel not just bad for watching it, but even worse to want a front row seat.  Yes, this movie actually makes horror fans feel bad about being horror fans.  Imagine that!Considering the simple plot, carried mainly by realism, realism, and more realism, any such movie polished by Hollywood could not have sustained itself beyond the first few minutes.  Hollywood would have made it look too well-planned and ineffective for its ultimately base and brutal purposes.  Yes, this movie has but one purpose--to be brutally horrible, for the pure and simple sake of being brutal and horrible.  There are no redeeming moments; there is nothing to be learned; there is nothing to make any normal person feel good about having watched it.  It is purely and simply a vile and disgusting film.  However, a ""vile and disgusting"" horror film may not be as bad as it sounds.  That can be the greatest compliment, as may well be the case here.I suspect that most people will not like this movie.  Most people will not admit that they like it, even if they do.  Surely, some will even curse me later for giving them enough interest to watch it at all, to spend even a moment considering it, even a pittance of money renting it, let alone buying it.  So, if you do watch this movie, don't say I didn't warn you of more than a few things that could make you wish you hadn't.  Yes, somehow, I liked Five Across the Eyes, despite the fact that it's a horrible movie about horrible things that people probably shouldn't be watching anyway.  However again, I suppose that the best horror movies should actually be as horrible as this one, if not worse.Five Across the Eyes is a true feast only for the most devoted horror junkies--those unconcerned about the little things that make a movie less than perfect, less than Hollywood, and perhaps, more refreshingly, far from predictable.  If you are one of the uncommon fans who fall into this niche, then sit back and enjoy (with guilty pleasure aplenty) this movie that goes off-the-beaten-path, literally and figuratively, into places you may never want to go again.",3,Horror in the Eyes of the Beholder (An Excellent Horrible Movie!),1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,5091,"['Five', 'Eyes', 'truly', 'horrible', 'movie', 'However',

1169104,A4O0L1OAJM6I2,B001AYWY8G,C. Lockwood,"[13, 20]","So far this film has gotten positive reviews from everyone. One amazon reviewer stated that this movie was only for the HARDCORE. I would love to know exactly what that means, but for now we will just stick with my take on it.Horror fans like myself go into films and come out 70% of the time disappointed. Five Across Eyes is in that 70% category. The only reason this even gets a one star rating was because they had good gore ideas. An example being one of the girls becomes so scarred in the van they were driving in, that she had an accident. To try and stop the maniac who was  running them off the road they threw the feces at her windshield. The biggest problem with that scene was it was really hard to understand what she threw because to many things were happening at once. The acting was atrocious. The camera work was like they were sitting on top of an earth quake the whole time they were filming. Honestly I have taped better home videos. And the script seemed like it was written by the five teenage girls in the van. Now because the film was written and directed by a no name it gets high appraise. If it were directed by someone of the highest caliber, it would instantly be thrown in garbage. Why is it that we base our opinion on who wrote, directed, and starred in it? We should base our opinions soley on how good the film was no matter who was responsible for making it.Five Across Eyes starts out with five teenage girls driving home from a high school football game. Lo and behold they try to take a short cut on the back roads of Tennessee, which the locals call "" The Eyes"" only to get lost in the process. We didn't see that one coming did we? They stop at a gas station to get directions. When going to drive away they hit a parked SUV. Panicking about not wanting to get in trouble by the girl who was drivings parents they  decided to drive away. A few minutes later the Suv with a psychotic woman behind the wheel starts trying to run the girls off the road. The things she does to the teens are revolting and very disturbing. We never find out why the woman is so crazy or where she comes from. Which I could have handle if the movie was good and made a little more sense.A lot of the film does not add up in the end or make much sense. To point out any of those things would ruin it for those individuals who are willing to watch this. I highly recommend leaving this one on the shelf. The people who do end up watching it, GOOD LUCK.",1,The title is the only thing interesting about this film,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,2469,"['So', 'far', 'film', 'gotten', 'positive', 'reviews', 'everyone', 'One', 'amazon', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'HARDCORE', 'would', 'love', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'now', 'will', 'just', 'stick', 'take', 'it.Horror', 'fans', 'go', 'films', 'come', 'out', '70', '%', 'time', 'disappointed', 'Five', 'Eyes', '70', '%', 'category', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'had', 'good', 'gore', 'ideas', 'example', 'being', 'one', 'girls', 'so', 'scarred', 'van', 'were', 'driving', 'had', 'accident', 'try', 'stop', 'maniac', 'who', 'was', 'running', 'off', 'road', 'threw', 'feces', 'windshield', 'biggest', 'problem', 'scene', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'threw', 'because', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'once', 'acting', 'was', 'atrocious', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'were', 'sitting', 'top', 'earth', 'quake', 'whole', 'time', 'were', 'filming', 'Honestly', 'have', 'taped', 'better', 'home', 'videos', 'script', 'seemed', 'was', 'written', 'five', 'teenage', 'girls', 'van', 'Now', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'name', 'high', 'appraise', 'were', 'directed', 'someone', 'highest', 'caliber', 'would', 'instantly', 'be', 'thrown', 'garbage', 'Why', 'base', 'opinion', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred', 'should', 'base', 'opinions', 'soley', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'matter', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'making', 'it.Five', 'Across', 'Eyes', 'out', 'five', 'teenage', 'girls', 'driving', 'home', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'game', 'Lo', 'behold', 'try', 'take', 'short', 'cut', 'back', 'roads', 'Tennessee', 'locals', 'call', 'Eyes', 'only', 'get', 'lost', 'process', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'did', 'stop', 'gas', 'station', 'get', 'directions', 'When', 'going', 'drive', 'away', 'hit', 'parked', 'SUV', 'Panicking', 'not', 'wanting', 'get', 'trouble', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'drivings', 'parents', 'decided', 'drive', 'away', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'Suv', 'psychotic', 'woman', 'wheel', 'trying', 'run', 'girls', 'road', 'things', 'teens', 'are', 'revolting', 'very', 'disturbing', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'woman', 'so', 'crazy', 'where', 'Which', 'could', 'have', 'handle', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'sense.A', 'lot', 'film', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'end', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'point', 'out', 'things', 'would', 'ruin', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'watch', 'highly', 'recommend', 'leaving', 'one', 'shelf', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'GOOD', 'LUCK']",N/A

Scenes go in and out of focus and it has the picture quality of a home video. On top of that the five girls that star in the film don't mesh together as real friends it seems, at least in the begining. Their acting is mostly tacky and the dialoug sounds extremely scripted. You may be wondering why I still gave Five Across The Eyes a 5 star rating. Well, because despite the flaws, this film explodes within the genre it was meant to live- Horror. Through the nauseating bounce of a hand-held camera, Five Across The Eyes shocks us with pure original horror. Since watching this movie I've become hooked on its ability to bring something new and interesting to the bland horror movie rut that Hollywood seems to be in currently. Unlike most movies meant to scare that I've seen recently this one didn't become forgotten in a blur of cheap $20 million budget horror pictures (Prom Night Remake), it still to this day stands out as a symbol for what it really is like to be shocked by a movie. The violence is original. The maniac stalking these girls is refreshing. It's just all around great to see a movie that breaks the formula for what is proven to work and dares to try something new.

1169111,A1NKJJCBBYVP4V,B001AYWY8G,"Philip C. Perron ""Philip""","[2, 2]","Okay, so what type of film do we have here you ask?  To be honest, we have a bunch of horror clich&eacute;s, a few bad one liners, a lot of false performances, and a whole lot of unrealistic behavior by the characters.  This film may have one of the coolest titles for a film but not all that much else.  So what is this about and why is it so disappointing?Well, it's the story of five girls, maybe college but most likely high school (since one says she is the only one with a license), coming back from a football game.  Making sure they are on the right road, they stop at some general store in the rural part of Tennessee known as the Eyes.  Unfortunately while goofing around they have a fender bender with a parked SUV leading them to panic and flee the accident.  And so the setup for our film begins.Suddenly the film becomes a chase film.  The girls land up fleeing but only getting caught by our mysterious driver of the SUV.  After some various disregard for human dignity, this maniac begins to do both psychological but most certainly physical harm to our five protagonists.  This includes some pretty vile stuff but nothing out of the ordinary for the most recent torture horror you'd see.  But our movie has way too many ridiculous items to make it compelling.To begin with, the screenplay is just plain awful.  Our would-be killer/maniac is not much of a scare.  To be honest, she's just a nut, seeming to scream things about how the girls are killing her baby and that they aren't anything more than loose woman.  Had our killer been a sociopath seeking revenge for the accident or some other psychopathic reason, it would have been compelling, instead she's more of an over the top caricature.Also we have the typical overplayed horror moments:  the cellphones don't work, we run out of gas, we get a flat tire, even though our maniac has a shotgun it seems to be forgotton too often.  Our protagonists are really just cartoons.  We have a running joke about a cremated father to the point of ridiculous (yeah, sure, people carry cremated remains in cars to football games).  The girls bodily fluids seems to be main plot points.  Though the maniac has a gun, the girls don't seem to keep their distance (as if the shotgun won't be used).  And the last line of the movie was so pathetic, it made me just shake my head in disgust for its typical b-movie preposterousness.Okay, so the acting is pretty bad or over the top ridiculous, the music for the film is out of place and should be elimated for this type of film, and the camera and filming techniques are like your little cousin filming in the dark, and so you'd think that alone would be reason enough not to watch this film.  But that's just the beginning since had the story been good and the protagonists weren't cartoons, we'd have had a decent film either way.  As a result, I cannot really recommend much here.  It isn't all that frightening, its not well done, and the characters are terribly written with too many artificial or silly moments.For the DVD there are no extras and so that itself makes it even more of a disappointment.  For the folks that are big fans and into the exploitation part of horror there is no nudity here.  So this movie really seems to be for no one.",2,Fantastic film title but not much else here.,1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,3259,"['Okay', 'what', 'type', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'here', 'ask', 'be', 'honest', 'have', 'bunch', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'few', 'bad', 'one', 'liners', 'lot', 'false', 'performances', 'whole', 'lot', 'unrealistic', 'behavior', 'characters', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'coolest', 'titles', 'film', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'else', 'So', 'what', 'why', 'so', 'disappointing', 'Well', 'story', 'five', 'girls', 'maybe', 'college', 'most', 'likely', 'high', 'school', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'license', 'coming', 'back', 'football', 'game', 'Making', 'sure', 'are', 'right', 'road', 'stop', 'general', 'store', 'rural', 'part', 'Tennessee', 'known', 'Eyes', 'Unfortunately', 'goofing', 'have', 'fender', 'bender', 'parked', 'SUV', 'leading', 'panic', 'flee', 'accident', 'so', 'setup', 'film', 'begins.Suddenly', 'film', 'chase', 'film', 'girls', 'land', 'up', 'fleeing', 'only', 'getting', 'caught', 'mysterious', 'driver', 'SUV', 'various', 'disregard', 'human', 'dignity', 'maniac', 'do', 'psychological', 'most', 'certainly', 'physical', 'harm', 'five', 'protagonists', 'pretty', 'vile', 'stuff', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'most', 'recent', 'torture', 'horror', ""'d"", 'see', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'items', 'make', 'compelling.To', 'begin', 'screenplay', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'would-be', 'killer/maniac', 'not', 'much', 'scare', 'be', 'honest', 'just', 'nut', 'seeming', 'scream', 'things', 'how', 'girls', 'are', 'killing', 'baby', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'more', 'loose', 'woman', 'Had', 'killer', 'been', 'sociopath', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'accident', 'other', 'psychopathic', 'reason', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'compelling', 'instead', 'more', 'top', 'caricature.Also', 'have', 'typical', 'overplayed', 'horror', 'moments', 'cellphones', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'run', 'out', 'gas', 'get', 'flat', 'tire', 'even', 'maniac', 'shotgun', 'be', 'forgotton', 'too', 'often', 'protagonists', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'cartoons', 'have', 'running', 'joke', 'cremated', 'father', 'point', 'ridiculous', 'yeah', 'sure', 'people', 'carry', 'cremated', 'remains', 'cars', 'football', 'games', 'girls', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'be', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'maniac', 'gun', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'distance', 'shotgun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'pathetic', 'made', 'just', 'shake', 'head', 'disgust', 'typical', 'b-movie', 'preposterousness.Okay', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'top', 'ridiculous', 'music', 'film', 'place', 'should', 'be', 'elimated', 'type', 'film', 'camera', 'filming', 'techniques', 'are', 'little', 'cousin', 'filming', 'dark', 'so', ""'d"", 'think', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'beginning', 'had', 'story', 'been', 'good', 'protagonists', 'were', ""n't"", 'cartoons', ""'d"", 'have', 'had', 'decent', 'film', 'way', 'result', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'recommend', 'much', 'here', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'are', 'terribly', 'written', 'too', 'many', 'artificial', 'silly', 'moments.For', 'DVD', 'are', 'extras', 'so', 'even', 'more', 'disappointment', 'folks', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'exploitation', 'part', 'horror', 'nudity', 'here', 'So', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'one']",N/A
1169112,A3BVHPDNG36WO1,B001AYWY8G,"Phillip Royer ""sitenoise""","[5, 10]","Every frame of this real time 90 film is shot from inside the van. Yes, it's grainy and hand-held, but it's creatively envisioned and executed. You are the camera, along for the ride. When filming the girls changing a flat tire you can only get the shot via the side-view mirror. Priceless. Most of the humor in the film is achieved by being that omniscient, yet part of the mix, set of eyes. The one-liners are eaves-dropped upon, not thrown in your face.This isn't gore, though there is a fair amount of blood splashed around. There is nothing supernatural. There is just waiting for the next horrible thing in store for these girls at the hands of the soccer mom. Then something really horrible happens and it's downplayed, like pulling a screwdriver from between the legs of one of the girls, or watching from inside the van as another girl appears to get a shotgun up the butt. Another girl gets her mouth taped shut after after being loaded with fish hooks. But these 'gorable' moments aren't the focus. You really have to see this film to see how subtle and understated it is.What I found most entertaining was the emotional back-and-forth between dread-filled screaming teenagers and dead-pan humor--which is NOT AT ALL like cheap horror comedy humor. This is not a send-up and it's not meant to be satire. The humor is achieved through the comic timing of the director and editor and the choices they make. There is no setup to the punches, you catch them peripherally and that's what makes them good.A soccer mom with a big, perfectly white teeth smile haunts these girls. Genius. How many more hillbillies can a horror fan take?The sound design of the dialog was a little sub-par. I really want to watch this again with subtitles. It seems that the soccer mom terrorist is charging the girls with ruining her family and she scolds them over and over at extremely high volume. It's as if she is taking the role of uber-mom to all these girls. She's rather large physically, not fat, and has a very big mouth (filled with perfect white teeth, as I mentioned before ... and they almost glow, adding to the surreal nature of things). That we can't really discern what her motives are puts us in the same state of mind as the girls.The girls themselves go back and forth between bitching at one another to last-rites declarations of love and apology as they sense the end may be near.Forget Blair Witch, if you saw the Spanish horror film REC and liked it, give this one a shot. I thought it was going to be a cheap exploitation flick. The fact that the first thing the soccer mom does when she catches the girls is make them take all their clothes off and put them in a pile and make one of the girls pee on them, well ... I thought, yep, exploitation it is. But then the crazy lady just drives off.

1169116,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001AYWY8G,trebe,"[0, 0]","The low budget suspense thriller Five Across the Eyes (2005) has some decent ideas, and features some edgy and scary situations, but it suffers from some major technical shortcomings.  Shot at exclusively at night, apparently with mini DV camcorders, image quality is not very good, colors are dull, and the video is often indistinct, and difficult to watch.  The story is presented more or less in real time, with minimal editing.  The video is shot from perspectives that often give you the feeling that you are there in the middle of the action, however the view of the situation presented is often so limited and restricted, that you feel you are missing things, which along with the grainy images, can be frustrating.  While some may regard this production as an edgy artistic statement, others may consider it simply extremely crude low budget moviemaking.Five high school girls are driving home late at night, and stop off at a convenience store.  Their van accidentally bumps into a parked SUV and breaks its headlight.  The girls leave without notifying the owner, and soon find themselves being chased by a vehicle with a single headlight.  They try to run, but are forced to stop when they reach a dead end.An agitated woman (Veronica Garcia) carrying a shotgun emerges from the pursuing SUV, and forces the girls out of their vehicle.  She's highly emotional and apparently mistaking the girls for someone else, forces them to strip off their clothing and humiliates them before leaving.  The whimpering traumatized girls manage to get back on the road, but they soon find that they are again being pursued by the vehicle with one headlight.Supposedly not trained actors, the unpolished performances of the five teens give the movie a raw edge.  The dialog is often irritating, filled with senseless banter and constant infighting, mixed with lots of shouting.  Much of the movie is shot in tight inside the van, putting you right beside the girls, which can be exciting, but not usually a comfortable place to be.The girls are lost, have no idea where they should go, and their phones don't work.  Often in a state of panic, smart decision making and clear thinking are in short supply.  The film examines how they react to stress, and what they will do to survive, such as when one of the group cowers in fear hiding, rather than help her friend who is being brutalized by the driver.  The primal choice between flight and fight comes up again and again, until finally the girls strike back decisively.Veronica Garcia gives an inspired performance as the source of the mayhem, as she repeatedly finds the girls wherever they are, and puts them through several varieties of hell, in a night that they will never forget.  The lack of graphic violence early on, is made up for by a frenzied explosion at the finish, culminated by an animalistic and ceremonial rite of passage for the traumatized teens.With a miniscule budget, the production isn't very pretty to look at, and is difficult to endure at times, but writer Marshal Hicks, writer/co-director Greg Swinson, and co-director Ryan Thiessen, deserve some credit for taking their effort to the edge, and not backing away.
