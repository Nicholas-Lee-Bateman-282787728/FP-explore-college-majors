The end made me cry, even as a kid and I think it had a lot to do with influencing me to work with kids in rough neighborhoods. I highly recommend it!",5,Sweet Story!,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,295,"['found', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'was', 'thrilled', 'parents', 'recorded', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'TV', 'siblings', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'end', 'made', 'cry', 'even', 'kid', 'think', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'influencing', 'work', 'kids', 'rough', 'neighborhoods', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
983169,A3R906AZJ9VANS,B000F4RHWA,John Black,"[0, 0]","The basic concept of the movie is that Will (who is in his late teens and was adopted) inherits the family farm and the care for his mentally challenged older sister. In order to get help for himself on the farm, and someone for his sister to play with, Will kidnaps two children who need a better life and tells them they died and that the farm is a little piece of heaven. This, of course, does not work out as planned.The movie is not fancy, but is well made and the acting is good. The closest thing to special effects is the special effects Will puts on to aid in his agenda, which is &#34;homemade by a teenager&#34; special effects. The movie is probably best suited for the preteen children but can be enjoyed by the whole family. I don't want to give too much away, but the happy ending is almost fantasy, which the preteen children will be happy to accept.Suspend reality and accept the movie on its terms and it is fun.",4,Light humorous drama; a bit simplistic with an unrealistic but happy ending,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,930,"['basic', 'concept', 'movie', 'Will', 'who', 'late', 'teens', 'was', 'adopted', 'family', 'farm', 'care', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'older', 'sister', 'order', 'get', 'help', 'farm', 'someone', 'sister', 'play', 'Will', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'need', 'better', 'life', 'died', 'farm', 'little', 'piece', 'heaven', 'course', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'planned.The', 'movie', 'not', 'fancy', 'well', 'made', 'acting', 'good', 'closest', 'thing', 'special', 'effects', 'special', 'effects', 'Will', 'puts', 'aid', 'agenda', '34', 'homemade', 'teenager', '34', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'suited', 'preteen', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'happy', 'ending', 'almost', 'fantasy', 'preteen', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'accept.Suspend', 'reality', 'accept', 'movie', 'terms', 'fun']",N/A
