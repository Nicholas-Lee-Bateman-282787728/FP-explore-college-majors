480661,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,6305838208,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[5, 6]","Our Town was adapted from Thorton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize winning play.  It has three acts, each about a different aspect of life in Grovers Corner, New Hampshire as seen through the life of two neighbors, the Gibbs and the Webbs.  On stage, there were virtually no sets.  The film had full sets.  The one truly theatrical feature the film retained was Stage Manager, who narrates the film. The film version featured some early performances from future Oscar winners.The first act is A Day in the Life (June 7, 1901).  We get to see a day in the life of the two families.  The Gibbs are Julia (Fay Bainter), Dr. Frank (Thomas Mitchell), George (William Holden) and Rebecca.  The Webbs are Myrtle (Beulah Bondi), Editor Charles (Guy Kibbee), Emily (Martha Scott) and Wally.  This is the ordinary life of ordinary families.  George and Emily are the same age and they have a crush on each other but they are too shy to express it.  Most of the act revolves around this.The second act is Love and Marriage (three years later).  George and Emily are about to be married and each has their own pre-wedding jitters.  But before the wedding we see a flashback on the day that George and Emily finally admitted their feelings for each other.The third act is Death (nine years later).  Emily has complications with child birth and dies.  The souls of those who passed converse.  Emily finds out that she go back and relive a day.  Which makes her realize how much we take for granted.  The one change that the film makes is here.  In the film, Emily does not actually die but comes back to life to be with George and the baby.This change in the ending actually lessens the film.  But what is even worse is the cinematography.  In the cemetery scene, Emily's head is often out of frame.  And as she about half the lines, its very disconcerting.  This framing error happens often throughout the film.  Also the contrast of black, white and grey is often murky.  You might say that it is the transfer for the DVD but I also have a copy of the film from Turner Classics and it is as murky and poorly framed.  Therefore, it was probably the original print.This is a wonderful play and it's interesting to see a very young William Holden.  The best filmed version of this was the NBC production in 1978 with Sada Thompson and Barbara Bel Geddes but this is not available.  So if you want Our Town, it's either this one or the Showtime production with Paul Newman.DVD EXTRAS: None",4,American Theatre Classic goes Hollywood,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,2464,"['Town', 'was', 'adapted', 'Thorton', 'Wilder', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'play', 'three', 'acts', 'different', 'aspect', 'life', 'Grovers', 'Corner', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'seen', 'life', 'two', 'neighbors', 'Gibbs', 'Webbs', 'stage', 'were', 'virtually', 'sets', 'film', 'had', 'full', 'sets', 'one', 'truly', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'film', 'retained', 'was', 'Stage', 'Manager', 'who', 'film', 'film', 'version', 'featured', 'early', 'performances', 'future', 'Oscar', 'winners.The', 'first', 'act', 'Day', 'Life', 'June', '7', '1901', 'get', 'see', 'day', 'life', 'two', 'families', 'Gibbs', 'are', 'Julia', 'Fay', 'Bainter', 'Dr.', 'Frank', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'George', 'William', 'Holden', 'Rebecca', 'Webbs', 'are', 'Myrtle', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'Editor', 'Charles', 'Guy', 'Kibbee', 'Emily', 'Martha', 'Scott', 'Wally', 'ordinary', 'life', 'ordinary', 'families', 'George', 'Emily', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'have', 'crush', 'other', 'are', 'too', 'shy', 'express', 'Most', 'act', 'this.The', 'second', 'act', 'Love', 'Marriage', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'George', 'Emily', 'are', 'be', 'married', 'own', 'pre-wedding', 'jitters', 'wedding', 'see', 'flashback', 'day', 'George', 'Emily', 'finally', 'admitted', 'feelings', 'other.The', 'third', 'act', 'Death', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'Emily', 'complications', 'child', 'birth', 'dies', 'souls', 'who', 'passed', 'converse', 'Emily', 'out', 'go', 'back', 'relive', 'day', 'Which', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'take', 'granted', 'one', 'change', 'film', 'here', 'film', 'Emily', 'not', 'actually', 'die', 'back', 'life', 'be', 'George', 'baby.This', 'change', 'ending', 'actually', 'film', 'what', 'even', 'worse', 'cinematography', 'cemetery', 'scene', 'Emily', 'head', 'often', 'frame', 'lines', 'very', 'disconcerting', 'framing', 'error', 'often', 'film', 'Also', 'contrast', 'black', 'white', 'grey', 'often', 'murky', 'might', 'say', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'also', 'have', 'copy', 'film', 'Turner', 'Classics', 'murky', 'poorly', 'framed', 'Therefore', 'was', 'probably', 'original', 'print.This', 'wonderful', 'play', 'interesting', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'William', 'Holden', 'best', 'filmed', 'version', 'was', 'NBC', 'production', '1978', 'Sada', 'Thompson', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'not', 'available', 'So', 'want', 'Town', 'one', 'Showtime', 'production', 'Paul', 'Newman.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

480665,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305838208,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","Our Town (Sam Wood, 1940)Sam Wood's 1940 film adaptation of Our Town was a missed opportunity from the very start. ""Ill-conceived"" is a great way to describe it. For why would you take a play whose main draw is its complete lack of sets--it makes the audience rely on their imaginations in order to fill in the blanks--and provide it with those very sets? You've cut out a great deal of what makes the play so distinctive. The other side of the coin is that Wood stocked the film with a number of fine actors, and the caliber of the performances lessens the blow somewhat.In case you've been living under a rock since 1938 and have somehow managed to avoid being exposed to Our Town at all, the plot: ...well, there really isn't a plot. Our Town is a slice-of-life film that takes place at the turn of the 20th century. The main storyline has to do with the romance of George Gibbs (Sunset Blvd.'s William Holden), the son of the town doctor (It's a Wonderful Life's Thomas Mitchell), and girl-next-door Emily Webb (the film debut of Martha Scott, reprising her Broadway role). But, as is usually the case with films like this, there are any number of other storylines that loom large in the background, ready to take over the narrative at any time--the lonely, repressed life of the town's choirmaster, Simon Stimson (Room Service's Philip Wood, another stage actor, who died a few months before the film's release); family drama at the Gibbs household; George's impending baseball career; etc., etc.Underneath the film's bucolic exterior is a rather nasty heart, and whether you are going to end up enjoying it relies entirely on whether you assume (as I did) Wilder meant that as a criticism, or whether he meant to celebrate it. You get the first stirrings of this very early on (the narrator tells us that the town's population ""is two thousand, six hundred forty-two, not counting about five hundred Polish immigrants""), but the real nastiness, that casts a pall over the entire film, is the town's treatment of Stimson, who is both gay and alcoholic. The latter, presumably, growing out of his need to keep the former secret. All of the town's wonderfully fridnly ladies, who wouldn't think of locking their doors at night (even with all those Polacks so close by!), treat Stimson with the barest veneer of civility covering their scorn, even when he's supposed to be commanding them at choir practice. It might be a minor spoiler to say that, for the careful viewer, this storyline does take over the plot during Act 3, though in such a way as to preserve deniability on the part of everyone involved. (To say how, on the other hand, would constitute a major spoiler; all I can say is that Stimson and Emily briefly become best buds.)Normally I'd take such a critical attitude as a given, but if so--and this is a problem with the source material, not the film, I rush to add--Wilder pulled his punches at the end, which tacks on a cheese-puff moral that has sweet FA to do with all that underlying criticism of turn-of-the-century American heartland life, and effectively hamstrings it, leading me to even have to ask this otherwise ridiculous question. Rather than ponder it, I'm going to take the turn-of-the-century American heartland attitude towards it, assume that my assumption is correct, and stop thinking about it, because otherwise this watchable, if minor, film becomes an offensive mess that you're better off never knowing existed. (For the record, to lend credence to my interpretation of things, Wilder is widely considered to have been homosexual, albeit closeted in much the same way Stimson is [link removed for Amazon consumption]). ***",3,"Some questionable directorial choices, but otherwise fine.",1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,3665,"['Town', 'Sam', 'Wood', '1940', 'Sam', 'Wood', '1940', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Town', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'very', 'start', 'Ill-conceived', 'great', 'way', 'describe', 'why', 'would', 'take', 'play', 'main', 'draw', 'complete', 'lack', 'sets', 'audience', 'rely', 'imaginations', 'order', 'fill', 'blanks', 'provide', 'very', 'sets', ""'ve"", 'cut', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'what', 'play', 'so', 'distinctive', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'Wood', 'stocked', 'film', 'number', 'fine', 'actors', 'caliber', 'performances', 'blow', 'somewhat.In', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', '1938', 'have', 'somehow', 'managed', 'avoid', 'being', 'exposed', 'Town', 'plot', 'well', 'really', ""n't"", 'plot', 'Town', 'slice-of-life', 'film', 'place', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'main', 'storyline', 'do', 'romance', 'George', 'Gibbs', 'Sunset', 'Blvd', 'William', 'Holden', 'son', 'town', 'doctor', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'girl-next-door', 'Emily', 'Webb', 'film', 'debut', 'Martha', 'Scott', 'reprising', 'Broadway', 'role', 'usually', 'case', 'films', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'storylines', 'loom', 'large', 'background', 'ready', 'take', 'over', 'narrative', 'time', 'lonely', 'repressed', 'life', 'town', 'choirmaster', 'Simon', 'Stimson', 'Room', 'Service', 'Philip', 'Wood', 'stage', 'actor', 'who', 'died', 'few', 'months', 'film', 'release', 'family', 'drama', 'Gibbs', 'household', 'George', 'impending', 'baseball', 'career', 'film', 'bucolic', 'exterior', 'rather', 'nasty', 'heart', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'entirely', 'assume', 'did', 'Wilder', 'meant', 'criticism', 'meant', 'celebrate', 'get', 'first', 'stirrings', 'very', 'early', 'narrator', 'town', 'population', 'two', 'thousand', 'six', 'hundred', 'forty-two', 'not', 'counting', 'five', 'hundred', 'Polish', 'immigrants', 'real', 'nastiness', 'pall', 'entire', 'film', 'town', 'treatment', 'Stimson', 'who', 'gay', 'alcoholic', 'latter', 'presumably', 'growing', 'need', 'keep', 'former', 'secret', 'town', 'wonderfully', 'fridnly', 'ladies', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'locking', 'doors', 'night', 'even', 'Polacks', 'so', 'close', 'treat', 'Stimson', 'barest', 'veneer', 'civility', 'covering', 'scorn', 'even', 'when', 'supposed', 'be', 'commanding', 'choir', 'practice', 'might', 'be', 'minor', 'spoiler', 'say', 'careful', 'viewer', 'storyline', 'take', 'plot', 'Act', '3', 'though', 'such', 'way', 'preserve', 'deniability', 'part', 'everyone', 'involved', 'say', 'how', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'constitute', 'major', 'spoiler', 'can', 'say', 'Stimson', 'Emily', 'become', 'best', 'buds', 'Normally', ""'d"", 'take', 'such', 'critical', 'attitude', 'given', 'so', 'problem', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'film', 'rush', 'add', 'Wilder', 'pulled', 'punches', 'end', 'cheese-puff', 'moral', 'sweet', 'FA', 'do', 'underlying', 'criticism', 'turn-of-the-century', 'American', 'heartland', 'life', 'effectively', 'hamstrings', 'leading', 'even', 'have', 'ask', 'otherwise', 'ridiculous', 'question', 'Rather', 'ponder', ""'m"", 'going', 'take', 'turn-of-the-century', 'American', 'heartland', 'attitude', 'assumption', 'correct', 'stop', 'thinking', 'otherwise', 'watchable', 'minor', 'film', 'offensive', 'mess', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'never', 'knowing', 'existed', 'record', 'lend', 'credence', 'interpretation', 'things', 'Wilder', 'widely', 'considered', 'have', 'been', 'homosexual', 'albeit', 'closeted', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Stimson', '[', 'link', 'removed', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', '***']",N/A

Crawford,"[4, 6]","This is the kind of art that snobs like to look down on - nostalgic, sentimental, simple - yet there is a great beauty and sensitivity in this production.  One of the great surprises for me was the young William Holden, whom I remember from his hard bitten later roles; here he is young, handsome, and sincere in his love for the girl next door.  Beyond that, you witness the intricacies of a small town in the early 1900s, when there were fewer choices and the limits and simplicity did not seem to disturb most of the residents.  At the center is, of course, a story of love, the most basic story of all.That being said, the play portrays the span of time and examines life in a novel way.  It skips to crucial episodes, even viewed beyond death.  The most amazing thing is that it works and, at least for me, is very moving in its universality.  It brought tears to my eyes, which my adolescent daughter noticed with curiosity before hugging me in empathy.  (She was putting up with yet another weird film that dad wanted to introduce to her at that point.)The only thing that didn't work for me was the presence of an ageless narrator, who talked directly to the camera.  He was a bit too stylized for my taste and didn't add to the drama so much as explained things.Warmly recommended.

480667,A34D9Q0JTF7N7K,6305838208,Susan,"[16, 22]","I just recently watched this DVD; borrowed from my daughter's friend. It's from Family Classics...it came in a set of DVD's with 50 classic films. This version tends to cut off the top of the frame and so every so often, people's heads are cut off at the forehead. But otherwise, it was an okay print. Sound not the best, but understandable if you are really paying attention. I have watched many films with worse prints, so this wasn't a real problem for me. Now to the movie: It was beautiful! I am 42 yrs. old and had never read the play or seen the film. I have enjoyed William Holden in many films and so wanted to see him in an early film. Was I surprised! To tell the truth, we were 1/4 of the way thru the film and I asked my daughter, ""When is William Holden going to show up?"" Honestly, I didn't even recongize him at first! He was so very young, so very different. He did great in this role; I was impressed with his performance of a somewhat shy and nervous school boy. His youthful beauty and innocence really shone out here. It took me 3 watches of this film to finally ""see"" William Holden in this film. Very weird! My favorite scenes with him were of course all the times he was talking with Emily, and also the talk with his father about chopping the wood for mother. It was so nice to see these 2 young people talking of their love for each other without ever using the word love! The film's style is very unique, having a narrator, and at first seemed very strange but then with the 2nd and 3rd watches, I really liked it. There was some good filming; clever film cuts/scene changes that I liked, such as Emily's bed quilt becoming the landscape, the little girl's feet cutting to chickens walking the same way... More than anything I just liked the simplicity of the story...the ordinary-ness of it, the truthfulness of it. I agree with another viewer here, how nice it would be to crawl into this film for a while and spend some time with these nice folks in this quiet little town. You just feel good watching this film. It makes you wish your own childhood could have been, and even your adult life could be so simple and nice, spent with such people. I smiled at lines like the one saying how the 2 mothers cooked hundreds of meals 3 times a day, etc. and never had a nervous breakdown. And what a nice ""piece of his mind"" father gave to his son (Holden's character)...gentle and loving, to the point, no anger or threats. Spoken so to even bring the son to tears of sorrow!  All of this film is just so very beautiful, the words spoken are just restful and beautiful. All the actors and actresses were so good for their roles. I am fine with the fact that Emily lives in the film. I am glad Holden's character didn't have to face such sorrow so early in his life. I suppose the dream was a bit strange, for I don't believe that is how dead people are, just talking like that, but it was a movie from long ago, and it was a dream so I don't mind it really. I think everyone should watch this film to just experience the beauty of it. I got the play from the library and it is nice to read these simple yet beautiful words, and picture the actors and actresses from the film as I read it. It is nice someone out there wrote a play that wasn't about strange weirdo people with weird perverse problems. This film and play are a breath of fresh air. So glad I watched it! It will definitely find a place in my list of 100 all time favorite films.",5,"Five stars for story, beauty, and the Golden Boy",1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,3466,"['just', 'recently', 'watched', 'DVD', 'borrowed', 'daughter', 'friend', 'Family', 'Classics', 'came', 'set', 'DVD', '50', 'classic', 'films', 'version', 'cut', 'off', 'top', 'frame', 'so', 'so', 'often', 'people', 'heads', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'forehead', 'otherwise', 'was', 'okay', 'print', 'Sound', 'not', 'best', 'understandable', 'are', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'films', 'worse', 'prints', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'problem', 'Now', 'movie', 'was', 'beautiful', 'am', '42', 'yrs', 'old', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'play', 'seen', 'film', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'William', 'Holden', 'many', 'films', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'early', 'film', 'Was', 'surprised', 'tell', 'truth', 'were', '1/4', 'way', 'film', 'asked', 'daughter', 'When', 'William', 'Holden', 'going', 'show', 'up', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'recongize', 'first', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'young', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'did', 'great', 'role', 'was', 'impressed', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'nervous', 'school', 'boy', 'youthful', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'really', 'shone', 'out', 'here', 'took', '3', 'watches', 'film', 'finally', 'see', 'William', 'Holden', 'film', 'Very', 'weird', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'course', 'times', 'was', 'talking', 'Emily', 'also', 'talk', 'father', 'chopping', 'wood', 'mother', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'see', '2', 'young', 'people', 'talking', 'love', 'other', 'ever', 'using', 'word', 'love', 'film', 'style', 'very', 'unique', 'having', 'narrator', 'first', 'seemed', 'very', 'strange', 'then', '2nd', '3rd', 'watches', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'good', 'filming', 'clever', 'film', 'cuts/scene', 'changes', 'liked', 'such', 'Emily', 'bed', 'quilt', 'becoming', 'landscape', 'little', 'girl', 'feet', 'cutting', 'chickens', 'walking', 'same', 'way', 'More', 'anything', 'just', 'liked', 'simplicity', 'story', 'ordinary-ness', 'truthfulness', 'agree', 'viewer', 'here', 'how', 'nice', 'would', 'be', 'crawl', 'film', 'while', 'spend', 'time', 'nice', 'folks', 'quiet', 'little', 'town', 'just', 'feel', 'good', 'watching', 'film', 'wish', 'own', 'childhood', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'adult', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'simple', 'nice', 'spent', 'such', 'people', 'smiled', 'lines', 'one', 'saying', 'how', '2', 'mothers', 'cooked', 'hundreds', 'meals', '3', 'times', 'day', 'etc', 'never', 'had', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'what', 'nice', 'piece', 'mind', 'father', 'gave', 'son', 'Holden', 'character', 'gentle', 'loving', 'point', 'anger', 'threats', 'Spoken', 'so', 'even', 'bring', 'son', 'tears', 'sorrow', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'very', 'beautiful', 'words', 'spoken', 'are', 'just', 'restful', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'roles', 'am', 'fine', 'fact', 'Emily', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'Holden', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'face', 'such', 'sorrow', 'so', 'early', 'life', 'suppose', 'dream', 'was', 'bit', 'strange', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'dead', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'talking', 'was', 'movie', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'dream', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'really', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'experience', 'beauty', 'got', 'play', 'library', 'nice', 'read', 'simple', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'words', 'picture', 'actors', 'actresses', 'film', 'read', 'nice', 'someone', 'there', 'wrote', 'play', 'was', ""n't"", 'strange', 'weirdo', 'people', 'weird', 'perverse', 'problems', 'film', 'play', 'are', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'glad', 'watched', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'place', 'list', '100', 'time', 'favorite', 'films']",N/A
