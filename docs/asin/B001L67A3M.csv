Some of the acting is okay but most of it is terrible, the dub over matches the lip movement but sounds extremely weird and akward, the fight scenes are not beleivable because you can tell that if you got hit by the little 65 lb girl who stars in it, it would be like getting hit by a fly swatter.  The story line..... wow, there's a fail. I mean, autistic people have serious disabilities with imitating behavior, the whole idea of her picking up martial arts from observation is just stupid.I'm not being critical either. I'm a martial arts fan and I could kind of appriciate the choreography (which is actually very good, besides being almost entirely ripped from other movies) but it's just this tiny girl tapping people with her feet and them flying across the room, I don't know how you could beleive it.I say watch it though, if you have amazon prime and get it for free.

Then the Yakuza retaliates, and all heck breaks loose.The Good Things*Video quality is almost perfect; it's very clean, sharp, and colorful, with only a couple of grainy scenes.  The sound quality is pretty good.*Includes a short 8-minute making-of featurette and a few trailers for other movies.*Includes both English dubbing and the original Thai language track with optional subtitles.*The movie has a lot of phenomenal fight scenes.  They are extremely well-choreographed and distinctive.  Judging from the outtakes, it also looks like they were made to be completely authentic, and the actors sustained some serious injuries in the process.  Even though the fighting is fantastic, it's also very real.*The movie is also very well-filmed, with lots of good camera angles and unique colors.*Production design is good.  Sets are interesting, costumes are good, props are good.  Look out for one or two unique motifs.*It looks like there were one or two homages to earlier films by Prachya Pinkaew (""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector"").*The storyline is good and easy to follow.  Aside from the action, it has some drama and emotional parts, but it's nothing too sappy.  It's actually quite invoking, and seems to carry a strong message about love (believe it or not).*The characters are excellent.  The main character, aside from performing so many amazing stunts, shows some good compassion and emotion and makes the character believable.  Other characters are great too.*Music is good.The Bad Things*Not very many special features; it's especially dissapointing since the region-free British import seems to have deleted scenes and featurettes and other stuff.  Oh well...*Not for the squeamish; contains brutal violence, some blood, and some brief sensuality.Thailand seems to be pumping out some of the coolest martial arts films these days, and ""Chocolate"" is probably my favorite of them all so far.  Aside from boasting some incredible fight scenes and stuntwork, it is a surprisingly emotional story with strong characters.

1213639,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B001L67A3M,Anticlimacus,"[117, 127]","Chocolate is the perfect ""acid test"" to determine who are fans of action movies and who are not. How so? Let me explain. A true fan of action movies has the ability to overlook some flaws in film-making (e.g., script, acting, character development, etc.) if the action sequences are exceptional enough to make up for them. This is no different from fans of art-house dramas who can overlook minimal content if the film can portray everyday life in interesting ways. With that said, Chocolate is one of the best examples of an action movie that has such extraordinary fight sequences that they easily overpower any deficiencies in the script.An autistic girl with martial arts skill attempts to collect on the debts of her sick mother. This movie is not well written, and requires some patience from the viewer to slug through the early moments. Once the 30 minute mark arrives, however, the viewer is treated to one of the most amazing displays of asskicking by a female protagonist in the history of action cinema. Virtually all of the remaining 50 minutes is devoted to high quality choreography and bone-crunching maneuvers. The settings and scenarios change frequently, thereby avoiding any feel of repetition or monotony. This is brainless action at its very finest. JeeJa Yanin - an amazing specimen with her fluid moves and hard strikes - catapults herself into the upper echelon of female action stars with this single movie. Her punches and kicks start off rather basic, but get increasingly more complex until they peak during the jaw-dropping finale that lasts a whopping 20 minutes. Lots of fun to be had here.Now, a snobby moviegoer will cry about the negatives without even considering the positives. Anyone who does not enjoy the action in this movie seriously needs to get their pulse checked, or at least schedule for a re-alignment of their action movie tastes. There's nothing more scintillating than watching a cute girl kick the living hell out of hundreds (quite literally) of stuntmen in a variety of environments. Basically, if you're not entertained by this, you're not a fan of action movies. (You probably didn't like So Close or Azumi either, right?) Stop fooling yourself and go watch another Tsai Ming-liang film.Some critics have claimed that this movie ""ripped off"" other movies. It didn't. There are a few homages that last a few minutes at most (a few Bruce Lee references, a locker scene reminiscent of Jackie Chan, and some footage from Tony Jaa's movies). These few scenes are only a drop in the bucket, because 95% of the action is independent of any references to other movies. The sign-post battle on the apartment complex balconies is one glaring example of a completely novel (and breathtaking) sequence that pays homage to no one but itself.This is definitely worth a blind buy. True fans of martial arts mayhem will end up re-watching the action scenes about a thousand times.",5,"Poorly Written, But the Action Is Everything You Want It To Be!",1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,2920,"['Chocolate', 'perfect', 'acid', 'test', 'determine', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'action', 'movies', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'How', 'so', 'Let', 'explain', 'true', 'fan', 'action', 'movies', 'ability', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'film-making', 'e.g.', 'script', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'etc', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'exceptional', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'different', 'fans', 'art-house', 'dramas', 'who', 'can', 'overlook', 'minimal', 'content', 'film', 'can', 'portray', 'everyday', 'life', 'interesting', 'ways', 'said', 'Chocolate', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'action', 'movie', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'fight', 'sequences', 'easily', 'overpower', 'deficiencies', 'script.An', 'autistic', 'girl', 'martial', 'arts', 'skill', 'attempts', 'collect', 'debts', 'sick', 'mother', 'movie', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'patience', 'viewer', 'slug', 'early', 'moments', '30', 'minute', 'mark', 'however', 'viewer', 'treated', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'displays', 'asskicking', 'female', 'protagonist', 'history', 'action', 'cinema', 'Virtually', 'remaining', '50', 'minutes', 'devoted', 'high', 'quality', 'choreography', 'bone-crunching', 'maneuvers', 'settings', 'scenarios', 'change', 'frequently', 'thereby', 'avoiding', 'feel', 'repetition', 'monotony', 'brainless', 'action', 'very', 'finest', 'JeeJa', 'Yanin', 'amazing', 'specimen', 'fluid', 'moves', 'hard', 'strikes', 'catapults', 'upper', 'echelon', 'female', 'action', 'stars', 'single', 'movie', 'punches', 'kicks', 'start', 'rather', 'basic', 'get', 'increasingly', 'more', 'complex', 'peak', 'jaw-dropping', 'finale', 'whopping', '20', 'minutes', 'Lots', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'here.Now', 'snobby', 'moviegoer', 'will', 'cry', 'negatives', 'even', 'considering', 'positives', 'Anyone', 'who', 'not', 'enjoy', 'action', 'movie', 'seriously', 'get', 'pulse', 'checked', 'least', 'schedule', 're-alignment', 'action', 'movie', 'tastes', 'nothing', 'more', 'scintillating', 'watching', 'cute', 'girl', 'kick', 'living', 'hell', 'hundreds', 'quite', 'literally', 'stuntmen', 'variety', 'environments', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'not', 'entertained', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'action', 'movies', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'So', 'Close', 'Azumi', 'right', 'Stop', 'fooling', 'go', 'watch', 'Tsai', 'Ming-liang', 'film.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'claimed', 'movie', 'ripped', 'off', 'other', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'few', 'homages', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'most', 'few', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'references', 'locker', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'footage', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'movies', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'drop', 'bucket', '95', '%', 'action', 'independent', 'references', 'other', 'movies', 'sign-post', 'battle', 'apartment', 'complex', 'balconies', 'one', 'glaring', 'example', 'completely', 'novel', 'breathtaking', 'sequence', 'homage', 'one', 'itself.This', 'definitely', 'worth', 'blind', 'buy', 'True', 'fans', 'martial', 'arts', 'mayhem', 'will', 'end', 'up', 're-watching', 'action', 'thousand', 'times']",Chocolate

In fact, there are huge chunks of the film that where the viewer may become lost in a fog over where the story is going or who the characters are, but that quickly gives way to a sense of awe once Zen starts fighting. From that point on there is no point - only the battle. And the battles are amazing!If you are a fan of martial arts films then you must watch this film just to experience the amazing fights. The final battle on the side of a five story building, with no wires or stuntmen, jumping up and down levels, fighting and then moving onto and off marquees is one of the most amazing sets ever seen in an action film.

Eastwood,"[5, 6]","CHOCOLATE, named for its protagonist's favorite snack, is about an autistic young Thai girl who is a martial arts savant--parallel to the compensatory abilities of Dustin Hoffman's character in RAINMAN. Early in the film she takes on and defeats a gang of nasty kids. Next, she demolishes an array of deadbeats, who owe her sick mother money. Finally, as we can easily foresee, the evil gangsters who have split up her parents are going to be no match for her. (Telling you this is not ""spoiling"" the story--anyone who can count to three can see it coming.)The excellently choreographed fight scenes have a sweet and fairly touching story around them. If you enjoy watching women ""kick butt,"" Yanin Vismitananda (Jeeja Yanin), the star of this film, is sort of a tiny female Jackie Chan.

It contains all the basics of a martial arts film from Thailand.  The fight sequences are similar in style and execution.  The only difference is that the lead character is played by a female.  The plot is about a gang feud and a family member in trouble.

Just beware that the fight scenes don't really start until 30 minutes into the movie and you have to sit through an atrocious story line that doesn't make sense.

Well, the girl can do some awesome fight scenes.  Using no stunt doubles and no wires, the only fake stuff in this move are the baseballs she catches (you can tell that it's 3D effects there).  If she makes another movie, she could become as big of an icon as Tony Jaa.As for the fight scenes, there are mainly around 4 really good leangthy ones, with the last one being really long and nonstop, taking place in multiple areas of a building, one inside with guns and samurai swords, another on the roof against a transvestite, a couple of women (the only women who actually fight the main character), and one other sequence that has to be seen to be believed, on the side of a building where Chocolate and the never-ending bad guys (seriously, there were too many, but that can be forgiven since it's a martial arts flick) duke it out on narrow ledges, big street signs sticking out of the walls of the building, and the side of a subway line only a couple yards away from the structure, easily connected by the street signs.  3 stories of 2D fighting goodness, and the people who fall take hits that will make you cring, including, but not limited to, a guy falling 3 stories straight down, while others hit a few obstacles on the way down (ouch).It's also funny to see scenes from Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong (also great movies) on a television Chocolate watches, as well as hearing sound effects from Bruce Lee movies (supposedly).  It's great in the first fight scene hearing her immitate Bruce Lee's hoowaaah-ooo! voice.

(....Except that the ending scenes totally ignored the wonderful character of Moom, Zen's friend/adopted brother, and his central, pivotal role in the plot - I wanted to see the father acknowledge him, and the final contented scene of father and daughter include her friend/brother Moom, without whose dedication and persistence, none of this would have happened)....Great acting by the three lead roles (Zen, played by Yanin Vismitananda, a.k.a. ""Jeeja"" Yanin, Zin her mom(Ammara Siripong) and Moom (Taphon Phopwandee); also the too-brief parts of Zen's father Masashi(Abe Hiroshi). The bad guy roles and actors were pretty good, too......[Hm, is her father's name a take-off on the name ""Musashi"" of the over-rated  ""Book of Five Rings""? (from perspective of some who likes zen philosophy)?].....Plotwise as I watched, I thought at first that the bad guy leader was going to abduct the mom and use her to force Zen to fight for crime and profit one way or  the other, but this was more about the simple theme of standing up to bullies and getting what's owed... I was also waiting for yakuza Dad to come in earlier, but that's ok, the ending fight made up for that late entrance......The [...] blog site says ""There is a version of the movie, the Malaysian one, that has good English subtitles ...[from]...[...]. I highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of female martial artists."".....Some  have criticized that a couple of the fight scenes borrow choreography concepts from Bruce Lee films and Jackie Chan film (this one's locker scene). Who cares - consider it a respectful nod of inspiration which was woven into good fight choreography and story......Jeeja was trained in taekwondo (good foundation for elbow and knee strikes, kicks, leaps and acrobatic grace), and was 14 when she made this movie. The movie was by the same team that did Ong Baak, and Jeeja trained hard in muay thai techniques under Panna Rittikrai, plus some coaching from Tony Jaa......The only thing in the story that bugged me was that the muay thai teacher who was running the school next door would have eventually noticed the little girl imitating them daily and perhaps have taken her under his wing... but maybe not, if he was traditional in his perceptions and sexist in his values. [Hmm, will have to look up online if there have been well-known female muay thai practitioners in thailand over the years?].....Anyway, I will now look for more films with lead roles by these actors - Jeeja as well as Ammara Siripong, Taphon Phopwandee, and Hiroshe Abe......This one is a keeper. Now I have to decide between getting the region-1, dubbed blu-ray version or the uncut, english-subtitled, region-2, (is it uncut? there's at least one version that is...), malaysian version (I have region-free dvd player, will travel :).....ENJOY!",5,"Great of this type, especially with petite young female; and with good acting, filming, & choreography",1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,3046,"['..Very', 'action', 'movie', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'disregard', 'slightly', 'autistic', 'kid', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'adaptively', 'dynamically', 'fight', 'so', 'effectively', 'real', 'situations', 'Who', 'story', 'was', 'SO', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'scenes', 'totally', 'ignored', 'wonderful', 'character', 'Moom', 'Zen', 'friend/adopted', 'brother', 'central', 'pivotal', 'role', 'plot', 'wanted', 'see', 'father', 'acknowledge', 'final', 'contented', 'scene', 'father', 'daughter', 'include', 'friend/brother', 'Moom', 'dedication', 'persistence', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'happened', '.Great', 'acting', 'three', 'lead', 'roles', 'Zen', 'played', 'Yanin', 'Vismitananda', 'a.k.a', 'Jeeja', 'Yanin', 'Zin', 'mom', 'Ammara', 'Siripong', 'Moom', 'Taphon', 'Phopwandee', 'also', 'too-brief', 'parts', 'Zen', 'father', 'Masashi', 'Abe', 'Hiroshi', 'bad', 'guy', 'roles', 'actors', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', '[', 'Hm', 'father', 'name', 'take-off', 'name', 'Musashi', 'over-rated', 'Book', 'Five', 'Rings', 'perspective', 'who', 'likes', 'zen', 'philosophy', ']', '..Plotwise', 'watched', 'thought', 'first', 'bad', 'guy', 'leader', 'was', 'going', 'abduct', 'mom', 'use', 'force', 'Zen', 'fight', 'crime', 'profit', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'was', 'more', 'simple', 'theme', 'standing', 'up', 'bullies', 'getting', 'what', 'owed', 'was', 'also', 'waiting', 'yakuza', 'Dad', 'come', 'earlier', 'ok', 'ending', 'fight', 'made', 'up', 'late', 'entrance', '[', 'blog', 'site', 'version', 'movie', 'Malaysian', 'one', 'good', 'English', 'subtitles', '[', ']', '[', ']', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'female', 'martial', 'artists', '..Some', 'have', 'criticized', 'couple', 'fight', 'scenes', 'borrow', 'choreography', 'concepts', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'films', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'one', 'locker', 'scene', 'Who', 'consider', 'respectful', 'nod', 'inspiration', 'was', 'woven', 'good', 'fight', 'choreography', 'story', 'Jeeja', 'was', 'trained', 'taekwondo', 'good', 'foundation', 'elbow', 'knee', 'strikes', 'kicks', 'leaps', 'acrobatic', 'grace', 'was', '14', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'same', 'team', 'did', 'Ong', 'Baak', 'Jeeja', 'trained', 'hard', 'muay', 'thai', 'techniques', 'Panna', 'Rittikrai', 'coaching', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'only', 'thing', 'story', 'bugged', 'was', 'muay', 'thai', 'teacher', 'who', 'was', 'running', 'school', 'next', 'door', 'would', 'have', 'eventually', 'noticed', 'little', 'girl', 'imitating', 'daily', 'perhaps', 'have', 'taken', 'wing', 'maybe', 'not', 'was', 'traditional', 'perceptions', 'sexist', 'values', '[', 'Hmm', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'up', 'online', 'have', 'been', 'well-known', 'female', 'muay', 'thai', 'practitioners', 'thailand', 'years', ']', '..Anyway', 'will', 'now', 'look', 'more', 'films', 'lead', 'roles', 'actors', 'Jeeja', 'as', 'well', 'Ammara', 'Siripong', 'Taphon', 'Phopwandee', 'Hiroshe', 'Abe', 'one', 'keeper', 'Now', 'have', 'decide', 'getting', 'region-1', 'dubbed', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'uncut', 'english-subtitled', 'region-2', 'uncut', 'least', 'one', 'version', 'malaysian', 'version', 'have', 'region-free', 'dvd', 'player', 'will', 'travel', '..ENJOY']",Chocolate

1213670,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001L67A3M,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Straight out of Thailand comes yet another pulverizing martial arts film to bedazzle the bejesus out of you, and also make you wince in sympathy as dudes get viciously elbowed and kneed in their special places. If you've been suffering from Tony Jaa withdrawal, well, he's not in this one, but the central character here is almost just as good, just as unstoppable, and... is a girl. Jeeja Yanin (a.k.a. Yanin Vismitananda) plays the lead role and, looking at her all girly and petite and unassuming, it's an eye-opener when she begins to demonstrate to sundry hooligans that her kung-fu makes their kung-fu look like patty-cake (but, actually, her predominant discipline seems to be Muay Thai). The film is titled CHOCOLATE, and it is the bonafide shiznit!At its heart, CHOCOLATE is about a girl who loves her mother. Jeeja Yanin plays Zen, a mildly autistic girl blessed with hyper-acute senses. Her sensitive hearing allows her to pluck out of the air any item hurled at her (and this without her looking, natch!). She's also an uncanny muscle mimic, able to absorb martial arts moves and techniques merely by watching them on television and observing practitoners of the next door kick-boxing academy. In time Zen develops into a fighting virtuoso. She is also crazy about chocolate candy.To backtrack a bit, Zen's mom - whose name is Zin - had formerly been in a crime syndicate, but then was romanced by a member of the Yakuza. When Zin learned she was pregnant, she decided to go straight and also break up with her lover. Raising an autistic child is tremendously challenging, and it didn't get easier for Zin when years ago she decided to take in a chubby street urchin named Moom, who would grow up to be Zen's honorary big brother.Cut to the present, where life could be better. We learn that Zin had contracted a form of cancer but is unable to afford the expensive treatments. One day Moom stumbles into Zin's old accounts book which lists the names of people she used to shake down for money. Moom, desperate to help out and not realizing that Zin used to be crooked, assumes that these names still owe Zin money and off he goes to collect, taking Zen along. The debtors naturally aren't too eager to pony up and they dismiss the two teens, which is the wrongest wrong move they could've gone for. It's at this stage that we find out that Zen the autistic girl can seriously layeth down the smack.CHOCOLATE is a low down, gritty film. We've seen this same lack of polish before in director Prachya Pinkaew's other venturesOng-Bak - The Thai Warriorand TOM YUM GOONG (The Protector (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)), and their flaws ultimately didn't matter a bit, not when Tony Jaa was off doing his brilliant thing (and, by the way, the ONG-BAK 2 trailer looks all kinds of good). So forget about CHOCOLATE's perfunctory plot, forget the lazy script, the rawness of the filmmaking. And also that it takes about half an hour for this thing to get going. This movie instead hangs its rep and its watchability on two things, intrinsically linked: the bone crunching fight scenes and she who serves up all that bone-crunching, newcomer Jeeja Yanin, who was 24 years old when CHOCOLATE came out in 2008. While the overall acting won't impress a cast of a middle school play, it turns out that Jeeja Yanin, putting aside the action stuff, does well even in the more introspective moments. I don't know too much about autism, so I'm not sure how believable she is as an autistic girl, but her performance made me like her and care about what happens to her. The actress (Ammara Siripong) who plays her mom is also good, although I did think that giving her character cancer may have been too contrived a way for the film to try to gain her even more sympathy with the audience.There's a certain repetitiveness to how the film introduces Zen to her fighty fights (she starts out demanding money for her mom but always ends up violently encroaching the personal space of various goons). Basically that's the bare bones plot, there basically to string together a series of jaw-dropping smackdowns, each one progressively escalating in magnitude and audacity. Showcase sequences number brutal beatdowns in an icehouse (in which Zen channels Bruce Lee) and in a slaughterhouse, which offers up some funny bits. Near the end, there's the showdown featuring Zen taking on wave after wave of baddies, including a deadly glasses-wearing kid with some sort of neurological disorder. But the showstopper is the final sequence, which takes place on a series of high-up, very narrow ledges, first on elevated train tracks, then on a building overlooking a steep drop. As revealed in the 9-minute Making Of featurette and during the film's closing credits, those stunts generated some very real, very painful injuries. Jeeja Yanin is not easy on her stuntmen and, because Jeeja herself does her own stunts, she accrues her own share of hurt. She spent two years training in gymnastics and kickboxing to prep for this film, and then two additional years of training while CHOCOLATE was being shot. So it's no surprise that Jeeja Yanin is able to sell her fight scenes, makes you believe that this little bit of girl can take out mean-intentioned heavies slinging meat cleavers and swords. She's no Tony Jaa... but, seriously, do you really wanna run into her in a dark alley and you don't have her momma's money?

But you're not usually looking for superb acting when it comes to Thai martial arts movies. The action sequences here are daredevil stunts that even chinese kung fu movies of Jackie Chan or Jet Li (no disrespect to these guys as I like them so much) doesn't come close! The main character Zen (Yanin Vismitananda) is great at portraying an autistic girl who absorbs her martial arts prowess by watching it on TV. When her mother Zin gets sick, Zen and her cousin Moom go out of their way to help by letting Zen perform her superb skills at catching balls from all sides and angles without looking. It is here where they discovered that several people owed Zen's mother money that they went to collect and also here where Zen's martial arts prowess came out. Very impressed by the fight scenes. It is all flowing smoothly with very little slow motion effects to hide anything. Zen's fight scenes were very impressive in the sense that all scenes were smoothly carried out. It makes no mince-meat as far as fight scenes are concerned especially the sign post fight scene, it was truly breath-taking, all original fight scene.

I kept expecting another stage but it stops with her as a teen. So I watched a movie about an autistic teen girl who teaches herself how to fight and beats the crap out of dozens of Thai gangsters. The stunt work isn't as good as the two Tony Jaa movies I mentioned above, but it's still quite strong. It also has all the story and character development -- at least for the lead character -- that those two movies were missing. This humble reviewer was really moved by the lead character.I've already said too much. I need lots of people to see this. NOW. I've been affected by this movie. I'm going to think about it for a long time.

1213679,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B001L67A3M,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 2]","Let's start by ignoring the title.  The chick likes M&M;'s.  That's it.  That's the whole purpose of the title.  Let's instead call it LITTLE THAI WARRIOR CHICK BLOWS MY MIND.  Then this review will make more sense...Zen (Jeeje Yanin) is a special little Thai girl with special needs.  Mimicking students at a nearby Muay Thai school, she started kicking support pillars and conditioning herself like a little Tong Po (Kickboxer) in the making.  Later we find her watching Tony Jaa in The Protector.  So naturally she becomes mistress knee-and-elbow.  We discover her combat talents early in the movie when a group of hoodlums try to get rough.  I have seen VERY little fighting choreography including children that I thought was impressive.  While brief, it was GOOD.  [Okay, they're all really adults, but they are portraying children.]The filming style allowed you to see that multiple techniques were filmed together and not individually filmed and then edited together for a more choppy, weak fight scene.  There is also a little Jackie Chan in there.  Some of her dodges are regular, every-day motions which happen to result in avoiding being hit, so it appears as if she wasn't even trying to dodge the attack.So Zen, with mad M&M; popping skills and a mean Ong Bak jump kick, realizes that her mother will remain sick in a hospital unless she can get some unsavory folks to pay back debts to her mother.  At first she was a bit unready to fight for her family.  But thank Buddha the spirit of Tony Jaa came to her in a vision so that she could kick some ass.  [This really is how the movie progresses.]This youngun' fights like Jaa, utilizes improvised prop weapons like Chan, and stunts about like both.  At times the stunts are a little slow, if not forced upon us, but overall the sequences are long, nearly continuously filmed, well-choreographed and, most importantly, just plain fun to watch.  Lots of flaired corkscrews, 720's and 540 kick-fake-kick's.  At first I was a little annoyed at just how affected some of these goons seemed to be by a skinny little girl's kick to the stomach or head.  But hey, she's not kicking them through walls and the fighting seems to use no wire assistance EVER.  This combat actress will have one Hell of a future if she has a chance to tone up a bit to sharpen her acrobatics.The closing action sequence, which is way-awesome-long, reminded me of longer fight scenes in The Matrix: Reloaded or the opener from Jet Li's Fist of Legend or, to beat a dead horse, a Tony Jaa movie closer.  It was inspired, exquisitely done, and had one of the most painful looking sets (for a bad guy) I've seen in a while.  Lots of nasty looking falls.The fights are quite creative, just as much as those reserved by choreographers for Jaa himself.  If you can tolerate action movies with subtitles without getting a headache then do yourself a favor and watch this movie--especially if you enjoy Tony Jaa or Zhang Ziyi movies!  If you fear that seeing a young girl (actually she'll be 27 in a few months) generate as much kicking power as she does will upset you, stop whining and see it anyway...and LOVE IT!  Just consider this movie her interview to earn your action movie fanfare.  She hasn't done much, but I want to see more of her.P. S. Beware the Thai Boy-Girl Gang and autistic kids.  You'll find out what I mean.For those who watch and love this I'd point you to The Protector, Ong Bak, District B13, Mr. Nice Guy...catch the hint?",5,Tiny Thai chick blows my mind with a heaving spoonful of awesome!,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,3474,"['Let', 'start', 'ignoring', 'title', 'chick', 'M', 'M', 'whole', 'purpose', 'title', 'Let', 'instead', 'call', 'LITTLE', 'THAI', 'WARRIOR', 'CHICK', 'BLOWS', 'MY', 'MIND', 'Then', 'review', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'Zen', 'Jeeje', 'Yanin', 'special', 'little', 'Thai', 'girl', 'special', 'needs', 'Mimicking', 'students', 'nearby', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'school', 'started', 'kicking', 'support', 'pillars', 'conditioning', 'little', 'Tong', 'Po', 'Kickboxer', 'making', 'Later', 'find', 'watching', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'Protector', 'So', 'naturally', 'mistress', 'knee-and-elbow', 'discover', 'combat', 'talents', 'early', 'movie', 'when', 'group', 'hoodlums', 'try', 'get', 'rough', 'have', 'seen', 'VERY', 'little', 'fighting', 'choreography', 'including', 'children', 'thought', 'was', 'impressive', 'brief', 'was', 'GOOD', '[', 'Okay', ""'re"", 'really', 'adults', 'are', 'portraying', 'children', ']', 'filming', 'style', 'allowed', 'see', 'multiple', 'techniques', 'were', 'filmed', 'together', 'not', 'individually', 'filmed', 'then', 'edited', 'together', 'more', 'choppy', 'weak', 'fight', 'scene', 'also', 'little', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'there', 'dodges', 'are', 'regular', 'every-day', 'motions', 'happen', 'result', 'avoiding', 'being', 'hit', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', 'dodge', 'attack.So', 'Zen', 'mad', 'M', 'M', 'popping', 'skills', 'mean', 'Ong', 'Bak', 'jump', 'kick', 'mother', 'will', 'remain', 'sick', 'hospital', 'can', 'get', 'unsavory', 'folks', 'pay', 'back', 'debts', 'mother', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'unready', 'fight', 'family', 'thank', 'Buddha', 'spirit', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'came', 'vision', 'could', 'kick', 'ass', '[', 'really', 'how', 'movie', ']', 'youngun', 'fights', 'Jaa', 'improvised', 'prop', 'weapons', 'Chan', 'stunts', 'times', 'stunts', 'are', 'little', 'slow', 'not', 'forced', 'sequences', 'are', 'long', 'nearly', 'continuously', 'filmed', 'well-choreographed', 'most', 'importantly', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch', 'Lots', 'flaired', 'corkscrews', '720', '540', 'kick-fake-kick', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'annoyed', 'just', 'how', 'affected', 'goons', 'seemed', 'be', 'skinny', 'little', 'girl', 'kick', 'stomach', 'head', 'hey', 'not', 'kicking', 'walls', 'fighting', 'use', 'wire', 'assistance', 'EVER', 'combat', 'actress', 'will', 'have', 'one', 'Hell', 'future', 'chance', 'tone', 'up', 'bit', 'sharpen', 'acrobatics.The', 'closing', 'action', 'sequence', 'way-awesome-long', 'reminded', 'longer', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'opener', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Fist', 'Legend', 'beat', 'dead', 'horse', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'movie', 'closer', 'was', 'inspired', 'exquisitely', 'done', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'looking', 'sets', 'bad', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Lots', 'nasty', 'looking', 'falls.The', 'fights', 'are', 'quite', 'creative', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'reserved', 'choreographers', 'Jaa', 'can', 'tolerate', 'action', 'movies', 'subtitles', 'getting', 'headache', 'then', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'movie', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'movies', 'fear', 'seeing', 'young', 'girl', 'actually', ""'ll"", 'be', '27', 'few', 'months', 'generate', 'much', 'kicking', 'power', 'will', 'upset', 'stop', 'whining', 'see', 'anyway', 'LOVE', 'IT', 'Just', 'consider', 'movie', 'interview', 'earn', 'action', 'movie', 'fanfare', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'her.P', 'S.', 'Beware', 'Thai', 'Boy-Girl', 'Gang', 'autistic', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'mean.For', 'who', 'watch', 'love', ""'d"", 'point', 'Protector', 'Ong', 'Bak', 'District', 'B13', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'catch', 'hint']",Chocolate

They are blown in by the north wind to a quaint, French village, full of church-going strict Catholics.  The year is 1959.Vianne is part Mayan, and carries her mother's ashes as she moves from place to place in a Mayan clay pot.  Vianne is an unwed mother that respects the Mayan Pagan religion as well as chocolate, which was an important part of Maya and Aztec life.  It was part of religious events, with Mayan Priests offering chocolate drinks during sacred ceremonies.  Vianne leases a small shop right across from the church during Lent and sells rich, delightful, sensuous chocolate desserts.  This opens the door to happiness and love.  At first this upsets and scandalizes the town, but one by one they succumb to the tasty treat.Both Vianne and her daughter, Anouk, refuse to attend church but remain good-natured during attacks by the conservative mayor, The Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) and the straight-laced, helicopter mother Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) who has disowned her own mother and refuses to let her son see his grandmother.  Judi Dench plays the grandmother, and is also Vianne's landlady.  It is a sweet, smart story and dashes of spice are added with the supporting actors (Lena Olin and Johnny Depp).The film has beautiful cinematography, colors, and the milieu of rural France.

1213686,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B001L67A3M,Mantis,"[1, 3]","If you have read any previous reviews of this film and wish to see it, you may suffer from great expectations.  Not only the worst thing Dickens ever wrote but the easiest way to kill what might otherwise have been an enjoyable romp at the movies.  I'm not sure that lowering one's expectations would've helped this one too much.  Even in bad movies, one can still enjoy themselves by feeling ""involved"".  I found it very hard to relate to the main character.The film starts with forbidden love between a Thai mafia women named Zin (Ammara Siripong) and a Yakuza (Hiroshi Abe) that results in an autistic baby girl.  The Thai mafia separates the couple and Zin raises the girl, Zen (newcomer JeeJa Yanin).  Zen grows up watching martial arts films and running from flies.  She has an uncanny ability to mimic the intricate moves she sees on the screen, in addition to other skills.  When her mother falls ill and cannot afford the treatment, Zen and her friend find a diary that list many people who owe money to Zin.  Zen then goes about retrieving said cash.I have been super-geeked about seeing this ever since I watched the trailer last year sometime.  To call it a letdown would be an understatement.  I expected the plot to be crap, so I wasn't too upset about that.  I wanted to see the cool fights that everyone was talking about.  Other than the last 20 minutes of the film, the fights suck.  Zen goes to place after place demanding cash.  She is then laughed at and attacked.  She fights dude after dude until the boss is scared and hands over the money.  These fights consist of being attacked one by one, with every dude throwing one punch (that's so slow a statue could dodge it) before getting kicked in the face.HOWEVER I will admit that the finale is AWESOME!  The last 20 minutes will induce more than its fair share of cringes as stunt-men earn their money the old-fashioned way:  Brutally!  The whole bag of tricks is emptied here.  Some fantastic Muay Thai moves with a little Tae Kwon Do thrown in.JeeJa Yanin is more than capable of performing some sweet moves and I can't wait to see her in more stuff.  This, however, I probably could've done without.  The presentation from the Magnolia DVD is stellar with a widescreen picture and the option of an English dub or subtitles.

This is truly a martial arts classic. JeeJa Yanin was incredible in this role of an autistic youngster who is able to learn martial arts simply by seeing it on videos she watches at home. Incredible indeed. This film shows the talent of this martial artist turned actress who trained for years to prepare for this role. She worked hard to achieve what amounts to the near impossible in martial arts that is rarely this astounding on film. The work she does here is absolutely incredible. Indeed the martial arts stunts in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. Setting a new precedent for a truly remarkable kind of martial arts wizardry. Her hard work in preparation for this movie paid off in spades. The result is one of the most impressive martial arts films in recent memory. There are plenty of respectable influences here, not withstanding the obvious connection with the Kill Bill saga, complete with a House of blue leaves styled fight sequence. And a nice addition was that I noticed JeeJa Yanin resembled Angela Mayo ying during some fight segments. Ying played Bruce Lees sister in Enter the dragon, who later attempted to become a Kung Fu star her self when she got the leading role in Lady Kung Fu which became something of a flop( look hard and you'll notice the resemblance), leading to Yings short lived acting career.

1213705,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B001L67A3M,shaun brammer,"[0, 1]","In my constant search for good kung fu popcorn movies I came across the name Yanin &#34;Jeeja&#34; Vismitananda. She is a Thai actress who was being compared to the action star Tony Jaa, of Ong-Bak fame. I watched one of her films earlier this year, This Girl is Bas-ass, and disliked it greatly. The film was an embarrassment to my wife. &#8216;See,&#8217; she told me, &#8216;Thais, we don&#8217;t make good movies.&#8217; I disagree with her on that, but in this case I made an exception. However, This Girl is Bad-ass is not what made Jeeja famous, that was her role as Zen, in Chocolate. I finally sat down to watch this film the other day, and it is vastly better than This Girl is Bad-ass, but not the best martial arts film either.Chocolate is the story of a young girl with a mental disability, in this case autism, but this is movie autism. Zen, while not very talkative is talented in hand-eye coordination. Bouncing pieces of chocolate off tables and walls and catching them in her mouth, for example. Zen, like me, has a love of martial arts films and watches them constantly. It is from these films that she learns martial arts. Zen is the product of two organized criminals; one who is with the Yakuza in Bangkok, Masashi, her father, played by Hiroshi Abe and her mother Zin, played by Ammara Siripong, who is a member of the local chapter of the Thai mafia. This love affair is frowned about by Zin&#8217;s boss No.8, played by Pongpat Wachirabunjong. The up shot is Masashi has to flee back to Japan, and Zin raises their daughter Zen by herself and a young boy she ends up adopting, Moom, played by Taphon Phopwandee.When Zen is older, and has watched a ton of martial arts films, her mother grows sick with some unknown, but curable, disease. I think nit might be cancer. Of course, the sickness can be easily treated with medicine that they can&#8217;t afford. Zen and Moom accidentally discover that Zin was in the mafia once, and a lot of people own her money. So, the two go off to collect what is owed Mama. Of course, these folks are not willing to pay their debts, who is? That is when Zen begins to put to the test what she has learned from Master Bruce Lee&#8217;s filmography.The fight scenes in Chocolate are fun, even funny at times. They are more like the scenes that one finds in Ong-Bak. This is not a surprise as Chocolate is directed by Prachy Pinkaew, and choreographed by Panna Rittikrai, the same men behind the hit Ong-Bak. The fights happen in various warehouses of different industries, so there are a lot of deadly objects that get involved in the close quarters combat. There are plenty close calls that make you hold your breath, one including a spinning ban saw. If you watch the outtake reel that rolls during the credits, you will see plenty of times when these stunts didn&#8217;t work out so well. During the fights Jeeja adds a sense of humor to Zen. Since she learned martial arts from movies Zen adds little nods to the heros she watched, like her own impersonation of Bruce Lee&#8217;s signature yell, as well as moves. There is also a vulnerable element to Zen, as she does not act like a spirit of vengeance, so much as a person forced to fight. She tries to get away, sometimes with a little fear, until she sees how she can best her attacker.As in most martial arts movies the plot is horribly thought out, and the acting is not all that great, hell at times it is down right bad. The film also takes too long to get to the end and the end scene is way over the top. It mimics the Crazy 88 fight scene in Kill Bill, but with melodrama! In the end I had a lot more fun watching this Chocolate than I did watching This Girl is Bad-ass. However, this film still paled in comparison with Ong-Bak, and seeing how Jeeja was being billed as the female Tong Jaa, Chocolate should have been at least as good as Ong-Bak. Jeeja is a talented person, and I suspect there is more acting talent buried in her performances then the director is allowing to come out. If she were able to work with a different director, and a well written script, she could take the world by storm. Seeing as though she keeps working with the same director, and most recently in Tom Yum Goong 2 (The Protector 2) under the shadow of Tony Jaa, she may never get that chance.",4,Semi-Sweet Muay Thai,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,4298,"['constant', 'search', 'good', 'kung', 'fu', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'came', 'name', 'Yanin', '34', 'Jeeja', '34', 'Vismitananda', 'Thai', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'compared', 'action', 'star', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'Ong-Bak', 'fame', 'watched', 'one', 'films', 'earlier', 'year', 'Girl', 'Bas-ass', 'disliked', 'greatly', 'film', 'was', 'embarrassment', 'wife', '8216', 'See', '8217', 'told', '8216', 'Thais', 'don', '8217', 't', 'make', 'good', 'movies.', '8217', 'disagree', 'case', 'made', 'exception', 'However', 'Girl', 'Bad-ass', 'not', 'what', 'made', 'Jeeja', 'famous', 'was', 'role', 'Zen', 'Chocolate', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'other', 'day', 'vastly', 'better', 'Girl', 'Bad-ass', 'not', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'either.Chocolate', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'mental', 'disability', 'case', 'autism', 'movie', 'autism', 'Zen', 'not', 'very', 'talkative', 'talented', 'hand-eye', 'coordination', 'Bouncing', 'pieces', 'chocolate', 'tables', 'walls', 'catching', 'mouth', 'example', 'Zen', 'love', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'watches', 'constantly', 'films', 'martial', 'arts', 'Zen', 'product', 'two', 'organized', 'criminals', 'one', 'who', 'Yakuza', 'Bangkok', 'Masashi', 'father', 'played', 'Hiroshi', 'Abe', 'mother', 'Zin', 'played', 'Ammara', 'Siripong', 'who', 'member', 'local', 'chapter', 'Thai', 'mafia', 'love', 'affair', 'frowned', 'Zin', '8217', 'No.8', 'played', 'Pongpat', 'Wachirabunjong', 'up', 'shot', 'Masashi', 'flee', 'back', 'Japan', 'Zin', 'daughter', 'Zen', 'young', 'boy', 'up', 'adopting', 'Moom', 'played', 'Taphon', 'Phopwandee.When', 'Zen', 'older', 'watched', 'ton', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'mother', 'sick', 'unknown', 'curable', 'disease', 'think', 'nit', 'might', 'be', 'cancer', 'course', 'sickness', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'treated', 'medicine', 'can', '8217', 'afford', 'Zen', 'Moom', 'accidentally', 'Zin', 'was', 'mafia', 'once', 'lot', 'people', 'own', 'money', 'So', 'two', 'go', 'collect', 'what', 'owed', 'Mama', 'course', 'folks', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'pay', 'debts', 'who', 'when', 'Zen', 'put', 'test', 'what', 'learned', 'Master', 'Bruce', 'Lee', '8217', 'filmography.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Chocolate', 'are', 'fun', 'even', 'funny', 'times', 'are', 'more', 'scenes', 'one', 'Ong-Bak', 'not', 'surprise', 'Chocolate', 'directed', 'Prachy', 'Pinkaew', 'choreographed', 'Panna', 'Rittikrai', 'same', 'men', 'hit', 'Ong-Bak', 'fights', 'happen', 'various', 'warehouses', 'different', 'industries', 'are', 'lot', 'deadly', 'objects', 'get', 'involved', 'close', 'quarters', 'combat', 'are', 'plenty', 'close', 'calls', 'make', 'hold', 'breath', 'one', 'including', 'spinning', 'ban', 'saw', 'watch', 'outtake', 'reel', 'credits', 'will', 'see', 'plenty', 'times', 'when', 'stunts', 'didn', '8217', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'fights', 'Jeeja', 'sense', 'humor', 'Zen', 'learned', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'Zen', 'little', 'nods', 'heros', 'watched', 'own', 'impersonation', 'Bruce', 'Lee', '8217', 's', 'signature', 'yell', 'as', 'well', 'moves', 'also', 'vulnerable', 'element', 'Zen', 'not', 'act', 'spirit', 'vengeance', 'so', 'much', 'person', 'forced', 'fight', 'get', 'away', 'sometimes', 'little', 'fear', 'how', 'can', 'best', 'attacker.As', 'most', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'plot', 'horribly', 'thought', 'out', 'acting', 'not', 'great', 'hell', 'times', 'down', 'right', 'bad', 'film', 'also', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'end', 'end', 'scene', 'way', 'top', 'mimics', 'Crazy', '88', 'fight', 'scene', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'melodrama', 'end', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'watching', 'Chocolate', 'did', 'watching', 'Girl', 'Bad-ass', 'However', 'film', 'still', 'paled', 'comparison', 'Ong-Bak', 'seeing', 'how', 'Jeeja', 'was', 'being', 'billed', 'female', 'Tong', 'Jaa', 'Chocolate', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'Ong-Bak', 'Jeeja', 'talented', 'person', 'suspect', 'more', 'acting', 'talent', 'buried', 'performances', 'then', 'director', 'allowing', 'come', 'out', 'were', 'able', 'work', 'different', 'director', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'could', 'take', 'world', 'storm', 'Seeing', 'working', 'same', 'director', 'most', 'recently', 'Tom', 'Yum', 'Goong', '2', 'Protector', '2', 'shadow', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'chance']",Chocolate

I'm not being critical of the negative reviewers because in a way it is a problem with the film.  They made a high quality martial arts film while at the same time trying hard to send a positive message (in my opinion) about people on the spectrum, and for many the two don't mix.  I would think it might make a good date movie with both people coming away happy having seen a different film. :)  My son is on the spectrum, and we felt they did a great job in how they portrayed the autistic girl, and also the fight scenes were awesome.  I would think that anyone who is a fan of martial arts films (especially the classics) would love this one.

1213710,A1DV6NTPQRWZE3,B001L67A3M,thepete8,"[1, 2]","Chocolate is a very good but rather off-kilter martial arts movie. The hero, Zen, is a 14 year old autistic girl with an uncanny ability to instantly learn martial arts simply by watching. Zen kicks ass to collect money owed to the family so she can pay for her mother's chemotherapy. Meanwhile the mother's ex, a possessive gang lord served by a posse of armed and dangerous transsexuals, is trying to keep her from reconnecting with Zen's father. I'm totally not kidding; that really is the plot.The set-up of this bizarre plot takes the first 20-30 minutes of the movie but, fear not, what's not off-kilter about this movie are the fight scenes. They absolutely rock! When star Yanin Vismitananda gets going, she displays definite skills. She's not as sharp as Tony Jaa or Jet Li or their kind, but she more than delivers. And once the action starts, the fight scenes come fast and furious. There's even a bit of ick factor thrown in for extra giggles. And despite the fact that I usually find guns disruptive in martial arts films, I felt they actually add to the action here rather than detract.Another reviewer that suggested this movie is a good test of who's really into the genre. I agree. The plot for the movie admittedly requires substantial suspension of disbelief if you're going to swallow it (I mean, really???). However, while I feel an inventive plot can be a plus in the genre, the main reason these movies exist is for the martial arts skills being displayed. So if you watch Chocolate and spend your whole review complaining about the weirdness of the plot or the lack of acting chops or the minimal plot development, then you clearly shouldn't even be watching the movie to begin with.Of course, the premise means that there's very little of the martial arts spirit to be found in Chocolate. That's a loss, but what we ultimately have here is a very well-made martial arts movie full of off-beat elements that set it apart. For example, to cap off the big fight scene inside the restaurant near the finale, Zen faces off against another 'special needs' martial arts prodigy. As I write this, I am fully aware of how totally ridiculous this sounds, but it worked! I recommend this movie.On a random note, this is the second movie directed by Prachya Pinkaew that makes prominent use of transsexuals as total bad asses (see The Protector). It's certainly interesting to see transsexuals playing characters like this, especially as the movie presents them as if there's no reason in the world to explain their presence. I like that, but I still wonder about their prominent presence. Are transsexuals more accepted in Thai culture than in the US? I saw other reviews of the movie where the reviewer didn't object to the violence in the movie, but seemed to be wigged out by the transsexuals (?).

The Thai-based director's latest effort ""Chocolate"" stars another incredibly fast and agile newcomer, the difference being that this time the star is a 24-year-old woman who, according to the director, trained for this film for four years.Yanin ""JeeJa"" Vismitananda (her debut) plays Zen, an autistic teenage girl and fighting martial artist. She can pick up every martial arts move just by observing it. Starting with Muay Thai (she happens to live near the martial arts school) Zen slowly learns the necessary skills, which she has to use to survive when her mother Zin becomes ill. Together with an orphaned boy Mangmoom (Taphon Phopwandee), Zen, who needs cash for expensive medicine, goes to her mother's debtors to collect money. They refuse and her bone-crunching action starts.""Chocolate"" is virtually a showcase for the ability of amazing Vismitananda and the stunt people who did a fine job here. It must be said that the choreography with props, great as it is, looks sometimes familiar as if borrowed from other martial arts films such as Jackie Chan films, but it is also true that the heroine displays a unique fighting style especially when she jumps and kicks high in the air. The film's thrilling climax features our heroine's long, bloody battles against the horde of henchmen on the facade of the building. In some sequences wires are used, but the film's stunts and actions are a real thing.To be honest, the story and characters do not convince. As Zen's father (and yakuza) popular Japanese actor Hiroshi Abe appears - to Japanese viewers, however, this is as convincing as Keanu Reeves playing a gangster. While watching the jaw-dropping actions of the heroine, however, you will stop complaining and be amazed by the incredible skills of Yanin Vismitananda. So, please forget the story and enjoy the actions.Hiroshi Abe said in his interview with the press in Japan that his sword fight scenes were not in the original take.

I don't know whether to laugh, turn it off or what.In the first 34 minutes, you will get to enjoy watching this young Asian girl ATTEMPT to play an autistic child. Her sidekick is a very chubby Asian boy her same age who helps develop some motor skills with M&Ms; and flies. This young girl yells and moans a LOT, in a tantrum type way. It is one of the world's worst acting jobs. Really. If you do not believe me, just watch. And the worst part, the bad acting does not stop once the action starts. She attempts to extract money from this group of guys in a warehouse and after she goes into an autistic haze induced by memories from watching Kung Fu on TV. After a very poor fighting scene, she ends up jumping up and down while being in a special needs outrage. ""Money! Money! Money!""The first 34 minutes are very boring. The most interesting thing is where her chubby sidekick tries to make money from her ""catching"" skills at the mall.Second action scene is at 40 minutes, in another warehouse, same scenario, better fighting this time. When I say better fighting, its an attempt to do some Jackie Chan fight scenes. She really doesn't fight, the camera pans away just at the last moment to make it appear as if she is doing something. The stunt men make it appear as if she has done something. Every time she makes a Kung Fu move, she makes this horrific, high pitched autistic squeal.At this point in the movie, the only word the girl utters is ""Money!"" She is attempting to take money from people that owe her family some money. She is still moaning and throwing autistic tantrums.At 47 minutes, she starts a job in a meat factory and the flies freak her out. More moaning and yelling ""Money!"" which sticking her hand out expecting money. The manager has had enough of her whining, and I don't blame him. So, he smarts off to her and she goes into another fit from watching a dead fly tumbling through the air in slow motion.Get the idea? If you don't believe me, just watch it. The fight scenes are super fake. The only positive comment I can make is that the stunt men do a fair job of TRYING to make her look movie worthy. However, even they are not good enough to pull this off.At 53 minutes, I turned it off.
