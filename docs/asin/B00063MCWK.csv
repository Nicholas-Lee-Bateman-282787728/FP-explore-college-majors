Acting is superb by all and pirotechnics are used for explosions/bombings rather than the dreaded CGI as in most of the newer movies. With this show you feel like you are there experiencing what our WW2 military must have gone through. Some actual WW2 stock film footage is used at times, but for the most part they use real tanks and other vehicles at the time of filming. Now they need to release the WW2 TV series 12 O'Clock High, which was another great TV series, although not quite as good as Combat.",5,One of the best TV shows for its time.,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,650,"['have', '5', 'seasons', 'Combat', 'not', 'bad', 'episode', 'be', 'found', 'like', 'WW2', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'will', 'definitely', 'Combat', 'Acting', 'superb', 'pirotechnics', 'are', 'used', 'explosions/bombings', 'rather', 'dreaded', 'CGI', 'most', 'newer', 'movies', 'show', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'experiencing', 'what', 'WW2', 'military', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'actual', 'WW2', 'stock', 'film', 'footage', 'used', 'times', 'most', 'part', 'use', 'real', 'tanks', 'other', 'vehicles', 'time', 'filming', 'Now', 'need', 'release', 'WW2', 'TV', 'series', '12', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'was', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Combat']",N/A

Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting and some time co-operating with the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs.

858175,A276M3NSIY9B82,B00063MCWK,Harry Brewer,"[1, 1]","Season two of Combat! is an improvement over the previous season. The producers & directors were now on the same page as to what direction the series should take. This makes it more focused & the story lines are tighter. As a child I watched Combat! because it was such an action packed show. The explosions, the bullets flying, the jockeying for position. But Combat! was an excellent drama also. Watching these episodes proves that. There was a lot of focus on the repercussions of war, the human conflict, the triumphs & tragedies. Many times we would get to see some of the inner conflict or the emotional results of what war did to men.Combat! had many major guest stars in the first season but season two seems to have kicked that up a notch. Some of these include Lee Marvin, James Caan, James Coburn, Eddie Albert, Nick Adams & Richard Basehart. It's sad that the episodes aren't in the order they were originally telecast but that's show business. What is arguably the best episode of Combat! is in this set. ""The Bridge at Chalons"" guest stars Lee Marvin as a demolition expert. The conflict between him & the squad, especially Saunders, gives the show an incredibly suspenseful edge. ""Doughboy"" guest stars Eddie Albert that is something of a stretch but is enjoyable. albert portrays a WWI veteran who has married a French Woman & has remained in France. He seems to have a permanent case of battle fatigue because he keeps having flashbacks. ""Bridgehead"" guest stars Nick Adams as a jazz drummer who doesn't want to be a soldier. ""Masquerade"" features James Coburn as a GI but who is, in reality, a German soldier. Saunders becomes aware that Coburn is not all he appears to be. ""The Party"" is a comedy relief episode that has Kirby in charge. Caje & Nelson are with him as they compete with three American sergeants for the attention of three beautiful French women. ""Anatomy of a Patrol"" is another one of Combat's best episodes. It guest stars James Caan as a German sergeant. Saunders & his squad are sent out to recover the camera from an observation plane that has crashed. A German patrol is sent there for the same reason. What makes this episode so unique is Caan's thoughtful portrayal; he's a soldier that thinks. The episode becomes a contest between Caan & Morrow as to who will out think the other.There are bonus features on each disc that include audio commentaries on three episodes, ""The Bridge at Chalons"", ""Bridgehead"" & ""Anatomy of a Patrol"" Two interviews are included, one with Vic Morrow & the other with Pierre Jalbert (Caje). The last one contains a lot of insights into Combat!

858176,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B00063MCWK,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[1, 1]","I grew up watching Combat on Sunday mornings. My brother and I would get up early on Sunday morning and watch an episode of The Little Rascals, then The Lone Ranger, then Combat!, and then an old Johny Weismueller Tarzan movie. I was in a pawn shop the other day and could not believe what I saw. The complete second season of Combat. A flood of great memories from my childhood came rushing back to me. After watching TV on Sunday mornings, my brother and I would go out in the woods and reenact the Combat episode we had seen. The woods in Sarasota, Florida were protected at all times from Nazis on Sunday afternoons.Combat is without question one of the best shows to ever be on television. It is as realistic as can be. Every story is believable, exciting, and you are fully engaged in each and every episode. Of course Sgt. Saunders was my favorite character, he wore the cool camoflagued helmet and his Tommy gun was always at the ready. Rick Jason who played the lieutenant must have been in the military. I am in Iraq now and lietenants have not changed a bit since World War II, maybe even before.This whole set is great and every episode is action packed. But my two favorite episodes from this set are 'The Doughboy' and 'The Bridge'. In 'The Doughboy', Eddie Albert gueststars as an old shell shocked veteran of World War I. He actually goes through the woods in a World War I doughboy uniform and has a 1903 Springfield Rifle with a two foot bayonette. He captures Sgt Saunders thinking he's a German!'The Bridge' gueststars one of my all time favorite actors, Lee Marvin. Lee plays Sgt Turk, a demolition engineer who's mission is to blow up a bridge. Sgt Turk and Sgt Saunders do not get along at all, but in the final minute fo the episode, you see how both men have grave respect for each other.Combat was an awesome show and now that I know it is out on DVD, I am looking forward to buying many more sets.",5,I'm so glad I found this!!!!,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,1924,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Combat', 'Sunday', 'mornings', 'brother', 'would', 'get', 'up', 'early', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'watch', 'episode', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'then', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'then', 'Combat', 'then', 'old', 'Johny', 'Weismueller', 'Tarzan', 'movie', 'was', 'pawn', 'shop', 'other', 'day', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'what', 'saw', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'Combat', 'flood', 'great', 'memories', 'childhood', 'came', 'rushing', 'back', 'watching', 'TV', 'Sunday', 'mornings', 'brother', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'woods', 'reenact', 'Combat', 'episode', 'had', 'seen', 'woods', 'Sarasota', 'Florida', 'were', 'protected', 'times', 'Nazis', 'Sunday', 'afternoons.Combat', 'question', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'be', 'television', 'as', 'realistic', 'can', 'be', 'Every', 'story', 'believable', 'exciting', 'are', 'fully', 'engaged', 'episode', 'course', 'Sgt', 'Saunders', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'wore', 'cool', 'camoflagued', 'helmet', 'Tommy', 'gun', 'was', 'always', 'ready', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'who', 'played', 'lieutenant', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'military', 'am', 'Iraq', 'now', 'lietenants', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'bit', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'maybe', 'even', 'before.This', 'whole', 'set', 'great', 'episode', 'action', 'packed', 'two', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', ""'The"", 'Doughboy', 'Bridge', ""'The"", 'Doughboy', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'old', 'shell', 'shocked', 'veteran', 'World', 'War', 'actually', 'woods', 'World', 'War', 'doughboy', 'uniform', '1903', 'Springfield', 'Rifle', 'two', 'foot', 'bayonette', 'Sgt', 'Saunders', 'thinking', 'German', 'Bridge', 'gueststars', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Lee', 'Sgt', 'Turk', 'demolition', 'engineer', 'who', 'mission', 'blow', 'up', 'bridge', 'Sgt', 'Turk', 'Sgt', 'Saunders', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'final', 'minute', 'fo', 'episode', 'see', 'how', 'men', 'have', 'grave', 'respect', 'other.Combat', 'was', 'awesome', 'show', 'now', 'know', 'out', 'DVD', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'buying', 'many', 'more', 'sets']",N/A
858177,AVH5WF1IVZ18X,B00063MCWK,J P Falcon,"[47, 49]","When I reviewed the first season DVD set of COMBAT, I said that it truly warranted a 3 1/2 star rating....now however we are getting into the swing of what COMBAT was to become....the second season is so chock full of terrific episodes that it is hard to know where to begin....I'll highlight a few episodes from this season:1. Bridge at Chalon - Lee Marvin stars as a demolition expert who is attached to Saunder's squad in order to blow up a bridge..Marvin chews nails in this episode, and we get to see clumsy Little John in action...2. Doughboy - Eddie Albert is a shell shocked WWI soldier who mistakes Saunders for the HUN3. Long Way Home - Richard Basehart plays a sadistic German Officer who captures the Squad..Simon Oakland excels in a broken prisoner, who does not want Saunders to make waves...4. The Wounded Dont Cry - COMBAT tried to be fair and show that there were German soldiers who were humane, and not depict all of them as stereotypically evil, and this episode, regarding a German Medic, illustrates this point...5. Anatomy of a Patrol - A classic in my opinion, as James Caan plays the Seargent of a German Squad who tries to outwit Saunders...think of how Kirk and Khan played a game of cat and mouse in Star Trek II as well as Robert Mitchum and Kurt Jurgens in the WWII submarine movie The Enemy Below, and you have the comparisons to this episode....6. What Use are Bugles Blowing For? - A great 2 part episode of a Britsh Squad protecting a Railroad station that will soon be encircled by the Germans...it is up to Saunders to convince the officer to abandon the station...great action and a very good character study of USA and UK soldiers...7. Gideon's Army - a very poignant episode concerning Saunders squad discovering a concentration camp...very sensitively handled...Those are are few of the fantastic episodes of the second season, and actually I only can think of one episode that I thought was totally awful. It was called Infant Of Prague and was concerned with a bunch of stupid nuns, who by the end of the episode, you were starting to root agianst them...anyway that's it....enjoy....highly recommended!!!",5,Second Season of Combat Greatly Improved!!!,1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,2147,"['When', 'reviewed', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'COMBAT', 'said', 'truly', 'warranted', '3', '1/2', 'star', 'rating', '.now', 'however', 'are', 'getting', 'swing', 'what', 'COMBAT', 'was', 'become', '.the', 'second', 'season', 'so', 'chock', 'full', 'terrific', 'episodes', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', ""'ll"", 'highlight', 'few', 'episodes', 'season:1', 'Bridge', 'Chalon', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'demolition', 'expert', 'who', 'attached', 'Saunder', 'squad', 'order', 'blow', 'up', 'bridge..Marvin', 'chews', 'nails', 'episode', 'get', 'see', 'clumsy', 'Little', 'John', 'action', '2', 'Doughboy', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'shell', 'shocked', 'WWI', 'soldier', 'who', 'Saunders', 'HUN3', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'sadistic', 'German', 'Officer', 'who', 'Squad..Simon', 'Oakland', 'excels', 'broken', 'prisoner', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'Saunders', 'make', 'waves', '4', 'Wounded', 'Dont', 'Cry', 'COMBAT', 'tried', 'be', 'fair', 'show', 'were', 'German', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'humane', 'not', 'depict', 'stereotypically', 'evil', 'episode', 'regarding', 'German', 'Medic', 'point', '5', 'Anatomy', 'Patrol', 'classic', 'opinion', 'James', 'Caan', 'Seargent', 'German', 'Squad', 'who', 'outwit', 'Saunders', 'think', 'how', 'Kirk', 'Khan', 'played', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'as', 'well', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Kurt', 'Jurgens', 'WWII', 'submarine', 'movie', 'Enemy', 'Below', 'have', 'comparisons', 'episode', '.6', 'What', 'Use', 'are', 'Bugles', 'Blowing', 'great', '2', 'part', 'episode', 'Britsh', 'Squad', 'protecting', 'Railroad', 'station', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'encircled', 'Germans', 'Saunders', 'convince', 'officer', 'abandon', 'station', 'great', 'action', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'USA', 'UK', 'soldiers', '7', 'Gideon', 'Army', 'very', 'poignant', 'episode', 'concerning', 'Saunders', 'squad', 'discovering', 'concentration', 'camp', 'very', 'sensitively', 'handled', 'are', 'are', 'few', 'fantastic', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'actually', 'only', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'episode', 'thought', 'was', 'totally', 'awful', 'was', 'called', 'Infant', 'Prague', 'was', 'concerned', 'bunch', 'stupid', 'nuns', 'who', 'end', 'episode', 'were', 'starting', 'root', 'agianst', 'anyway', '.enjoy', '.highly', 'recommended']",N/A

If you enjoyed the first season, then you will be thoroughly satisfied with the second year of the series.  This was high quality television. As I noted in a review of COMBAT's first season, the show was made at a time when more than 30 one-hour episodes were produced each year.  Compare that accomplishment against the pitiful 22 half-hour episodes available from most contemporary television shows.Actors and crew worked exceedingly hard to complete these high quality episodes.  In fact, there are so many episodes that shows from the second season, much like the first, are sold in two separate sets.As with the first set, expect well written stories, great direction, and outstanding battle sequences.

Lots of action and guest stars, Lee Marvin, James Colburn as a german inflitrator, Richard Basehart as a sadistic SS prison commander, James Caen as a german patrol leader.  The episodes that they were in were all excellent.The doc now played by colan carter is the doc that I remember and all the regulars are there, cage, littlejohn, kirby.  The best episodes in the season 2 mission one in my opinion were the long way home with richard basehart (a two parter), anatomy of a patrol with james caen(excellent move and counter move plot) the two parter what are the bugles blowing for.  In this one the squad deals with british pride and stubborness, well done.  The bridge at Chalons and masquerade with james colburn.

858180,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B00063MCWK,Mike  Silverman,"[0, 0]","Every moment of life is precious.  Every lungful of air, every beat of the heart, priceless and limited and worth protecting. Combat is a series that re-affirms how precious life is, and how quickly it can be cut away. While all the episodes in this epic series are spectacular and worth the price of admission, I'll point out one... one of many... that takes the theme to heart. The episode I have in mind is called The Glory Among Men.  Vic Morrow directed it himself.It takes place in an area that is probably about the size of a football field. The type of area similar to where a lot of the smaller battles of the war were fought , a muddy, filthy area strewn with fallen dead trees, a bleak open expanse of ankle-deep water and a bombed-out fortified wall at one side.  Sergeant Saunders and his men are on reconnaissance looking for where the Germans have dug in.  They come across this small bleak little stretch of land and slowly begin to cross it.  They don't know that a German gunnery crew is watching them from behind the wall with a mounted heavy machine gun aimed at them. When the Americans draw near enough the German Lieutenant gives the command to open fire, and a blanket of bullets rains down on them. Saunders and his men manage to just barely get away from the barrage by ducking behind some fallen logs nearby, but one man wasn't so lucky. His name is Mason, and he was badly injured in the attack.  He is laying in the middle of the expanse , face down groaning in agony, an equal distance away from where his fellow troops lay hidden and where the German guns are positioned.  The Germans could kill him off easily but they don't, they leave him alive and moaning , hoping to use him as bait to lure the hidden Americans into the open for a resuce attempt. Now, here is the catch that makes it even more dramatic.  The wounded soldier is one that everyone in his troop hates. He is a newcomer to the troop, a selfish, self-serving, loud mouthed antagonist who only cares about himself. Some of his fellow soldiers believe he abandonded his post on a prior patrol when the action got too heavy. Needless to say, there aren't a lot of hands going up for men willing to run out there to save him.  What ensues next is a genuine struggle of the heart, as the men who are pinned down by heavy fire try to decide if that man's life is worth almost certain death to try to rescue. After some intense argument among them, two initial attempts are made to resuce him, and both times the soldiers who tried were shot dead in the attempt. It brings the moment to a toppling point. Do they abondon him there, or risk more deaths in yet another resuce attempt?This is the kind of heavy, intense drama that highlights much of this series. It's less about the war itself, and more about the struggle of the people who are in the midst of it, trying to stay alive and trying to make some sense out of it while trying to do the right thing.The disks worked perfectly, the video image quality and audio quality were perfect, and this has what is probably the best designed storage case of any DVD set I've ever purchased, very easy to remove the disks from and to slide them back into, and comes with a paper listing of all the episodes and chapters.Also this series comes with some great commentary tracks that you can choose to listen to or not.  I especially found the comments by one of the directors , Ted Post, to be very insightful as he discusses the reality of a soldier's life in the war, he being in the war himself.- Mike S.",5,TELEVISION  DRAMA  AT  IT'S  BEST,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,3545,"['moment', 'life', 'precious', 'lungful', 'air', 'beat', 'heart', 'priceless', 'limited', 'worth', 'protecting', 'Combat', 'series', 're-affirms', 'how', 'precious', 'life', 'how', 'quickly', 'can', 'be', 'cut', 'away', 'episodes', 'epic', 'series', 'are', 'spectacular', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', ""'ll"", 'point', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'many', 'theme', 'heart', 'episode', 'have', 'mind', 'called', 'Glory', 'Men', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'directed', 'place', 'area', 'probably', 'size', 'football', 'field', 'type', 'area', 'similar', 'where', 'lot', 'smaller', 'battles', 'war', 'were', 'fought', 'muddy', 'filthy', 'area', 'strewn', 'fallen', 'dead', 'trees', 'bleak', 'open', 'expanse', 'ankle-deep', 'water', 'bombed-out', 'fortified', 'wall', 'one', 'side', 'Sergeant', 'Saunders', 'men', 'are', 'reconnaissance', 'looking', 'where', 'Germans', 'have', 'dug', 'come', 'small', 'bleak', 'little', 'stretch', 'land', 'slowly', 'begin', 'cross', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'German', 'gunnery', 'crew', 'watching', 'wall', 'mounted', 'heavy', 'machine', 'gun', 'aimed', 'When', 'Americans', 'draw', 'German', 'Lieutenant', 'command', 'open', 'fire', 'blanket', 'bullets', 'rains', 'down', 'Saunders', 'men', 'manage', 'just', 'barely', 'get', 'away', 'barrage', 'ducking', 'fallen', 'logs', 'nearby', 'one', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'lucky', 'name', 'Mason', 'was', 'badly', 'injured', 'attack', 'laying', 'middle', 'expanse', 'face', 'down', 'groaning', 'agony', 'equal', 'distance', 'away', 'where', 'fellow', 'troops', 'lay', 'hidden', 'where', 'German', 'guns', 'are', 'positioned', 'Germans', 'could', 'kill', 'off', 'easily', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alive', 'moaning', 'hoping', 'use', 'bait', 'lure', 'hidden', 'Americans', 'open', 'resuce', 'attempt', 'Now', 'here', 'catch', 'even', 'more', 'dramatic', 'wounded', 'soldier', 'one', 'everyone', 'troop', 'hates', 'newcomer', 'troop', 'selfish', 'self-serving', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'antagonist', 'who', 'only', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'believe', 'abandonded', 'post', 'prior', 'patrol', 'when', 'action', 'got', 'too', 'heavy', 'Needless', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'hands', 'going', 'up', 'men', 'willing', 'run', 'out', 'there', 'save', 'What', 'next', 'genuine', 'struggle', 'heart', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'pinned', 'down', 'heavy', 'fire', 'try', 'decide', 'man', 'life', 'worth', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'try', 'rescue', 'intense', 'argument', 'two', 'initial', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'resuce', 'times', 'soldiers', 'who', 'tried', 'were', 'shot', 'dead', 'attempt', 'moment', 'toppling', 'point', 'Do', 'abondon', 'there', 'risk', 'more', 'deaths', 'yet', 'resuce', 'attempt', 'kind', 'heavy', 'intense', 'drama', 'much', 'series', 'less', 'war', 'more', 'struggle', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'midst', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing.The', 'disks', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'video', 'image', 'quality', 'audio', 'quality', 'were', 'perfect', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'designed', 'storage', 'case', 'DVD', 'set', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'purchased', 'very', 'easy', 'remove', 'disks', 'slide', 'back', 'paper', 'listing', 'episodes', 'chapters.Also', 'series', 'great', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'can', 'choose', 'listen', 'not', 'especially', 'found', 'comments', 'one', 'directors', 'Ted', 'Post', 'be', 'very', 'insightful', 'reality', 'soldier', 'life', 'war', 'being', 'war', 'himself.-', 'Mike', 'S']",N/A

This was an incredibly well produced and acted WWII drama. Each episode is a taut human drama within the context of men under the incredible stress of war. Vic Morrow was amazing in this as tough guy Sgt Saunders and the regulars in the squadron he leads were all good. The guest appearances by a ton of 60's stars and future stars add to the quality. The overall effect of rewatching ths is like rediscovering something of lasting quality. In my opinion TV doesn't get better than this. One more comment - there is so much action packed into each episode that it also reminds me of how many more commercials interrupt programming today.
