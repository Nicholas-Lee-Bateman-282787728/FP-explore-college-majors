918432,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B000A1IL8M,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","Not a bad little horse piece, and pretty safe for children (as long as you don't object to a few gambling themes).This was a fairly low-budget movie, so there are no slick special effects. Horse movies shouldn't need them, either! There are still some lovely shots of Thoroughbreds doing what they do best: run their hearts out. Horse lovers (and racing lovers) will think this is great; the general public might not. Those who like this movie will keep liking it and those who hate it probably won't change their minds. The cinematography is straightforward and will look dated by now, but this isn't a deal-breaker for me. The scripting isn't awful, but not especially edgy or clever (in other words, rather ""middle ground"" among horse films). The music is pleasant, though a bit repetitive (again, probably due to the modest budget). As a child, I personally thought the plotting in this movie was actually pretty original and a somewhat gentle way to give children insights about the dark side of the glittering world of horse racing (without actually getting horrendously bleak - after all, it has a perfectly happy ending). Someone else will always disagree, though. People need to remember two things when considering movies: the intended audience (children's movies are seldom done in the same style as non-children's movies) and the filming techniques of the time when the movie was made (in this case, 1995 will be quite foreign to those who weren't yet alive or those who are expecting every movie in the world to be thrill-a-minute action/horror/mystery).I've always thought that Leelee Sobieski has a very distinctive appearance and acting method, and this was clear even in this 1995 work. Considering she was only about 12 when this movie was made, she's not bad (many people think her first screen appearance was in ""Jungle 2 Jungle,"" ""Deep Impact,"" or the ""Joan of Arc"" miniseries, but that's simply not true). Minor flaws in the dialogue (hollow lines) are the problem of the scripting, not the actors.In general, I have no particular opinion about Robert Urich (I'm merely unfamiliar with him), but he's a strong casting choice in this case and is a good way to tie the rest of the cast together.",4,"Sweet horse movie, early Leelee Sobieski work, pretty safe for kids",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,2215,"['Not', 'bad', 'little', 'horse', 'piece', 'pretty', 'safe', 'children', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'object', 'few', 'gambling', 'themes', '.This', 'was', 'fairly', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'are', 'slick', 'special', 'effects', 'Horse', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'either', 'are', 'still', 'lovely', 'shots', 'Thoroughbreds', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'run', 'hearts', 'out', 'Horse', 'lovers', 'racing', 'lovers', 'will', 'think', 'great', 'general', 'public', 'might', 'not', 'who', 'like', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'liking', 'who', 'hate', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'minds', 'cinematography', 'straightforward', 'will', 'look', 'dated', 'now', ""n't"", 'deal-breaker', 'scripting', ""n't"", 'awful', 'not', 'especially', 'edgy', 'clever', 'other', 'words', 'rather', 'middle', 'ground', 'horse', 'films', 'music', 'pleasant', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'again', 'probably', 'due', 'modest', 'budget', 'child', 'personally', 'thought', 'plotting', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'original', 'somewhat', 'gentle', 'way', 'give', 'children', 'insights', 'dark', 'side', 'glittering', 'world', 'horse', 'racing', 'actually', 'getting', 'horrendously', 'bleak', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'ending', 'Someone', 'else', 'will', 'always', 'disagree', 'though', 'People', 'need', 'remember', 'two', 'things', 'when', 'considering', 'movies', 'intended', 'audience', 'children', 'movies', 'are', 'seldom', 'done', 'same', 'style', 'non-children', 'movies', 'filming', 'techniques', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'case', '1995', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'foreign', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'yet', 'alive', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'movie', 'world', 'be', 'thrill-a-minute', 'action/horror/mystery', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'very', 'distinctive', 'appearance', 'acting', 'method', 'was', 'clear', 'even', '1995', 'work', 'Considering', 'was', 'only', 'about', '12', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'bad', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'first', 'screen', 'appearance', 'was', 'Jungle', '2', 'Jungle', 'Deep', 'Impact', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'miniseries', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'Minor', 'flaws', 'dialogue', 'hollow', 'lines', 'are', 'problem', 'scripting', 'not', 'actors.In', 'general', 'have', 'particular', 'opinion', 'Robert', 'Urich', ""'m"", 'merely', 'unfamiliar', 'strong', 'casting', 'choice', 'case', 'good', 'way', 'tie', 'rest', 'cast', 'together']",A Horse for Danny
