Get it at Amazon.]Is Marie (Caroline Ducey) perverted because she wants to be used and abused, or is it her boyfriend Paul (Sagamore St&eacute;venin) who is perverted because he denies her the love she craves because of his need to control?  Or is it Robert (Franois Berl&eacute;and) who has spent a lifetime chasing and seducing women?  Or is it director Catherine Breillat herself who in France is sometimes known as a ""porno auteuriste""?Or, better yet, is it the debased mind of the censor, the prude and the hypocrite who would deny the range of human sexuality?From Breillat's point of view, it is the censors who create the concept of obscenity.I have to say however that some movies are so graphically sexual that it is difficult to watch them without being aroused, and this is such a movie, the most pornographic movie that I have ever seen that was not pornography per se.Candor about sexuality is not what most people want.  Even rarer is it for a woman to be candid about her sexuality in a forum that might include men.  The fact that Catherine Breillat directed this film does not mean in any way that the sexuality of the central character is Breillat's sexuality, but it does mean she understands that sexuality; and since it is presented in a sympathetic manner, it means that she believes it is true at least for some women, at least some of the time.In effect the movie asks the politically incorrect question, do women want to be used and abused?  Breillat's cinematic answer is a bit of equivocation.  I think what she is saying is, it depends.  For even asking such questions Breillat has experienced hatred and been denied funding.  But she says ""All true artists are hated. Only conformists are ever adored.""Marie's boyfriend who is pretty and very attractive to most women will not have sex with her.  Not completely.  He frustrates her for no apparent reason.  He seems almost pathological in his disinterest in her.  She feels not just rejected but inadequate and of course frustrated.  She is crazy about him and does everything she can to interest him, but to no avail.  A game begins: but we see only her side of the game.  His side is hardly present, but there is this blond-haired male friend that he likes to hang out with.  Perhaps Paul is gay and doesn't know it or doesn't want to admit it.Marie first tries a guy in a bar.  It doesn't work out because there is no feeling on her part aside from...aside from what?  From a desire to hurt Paul?  To prove to herself that she is attractive?  Then there is Robert the older man who claims to have had sex with 10,000 women although he is anything but handsome.  This reminds me of the French novelist Georges Simenon who made the same claim in much the same way.  Incidentally 10,000 women is approximately one a day for thirty years, which (pre Viagra) is sometimes thought of as the length of a man's sexually active life.  Some readers may recall these lines from the poem ""Go and Catch a Falling Star"" by John Donne:""Ride ten thousand days and nights,Till age snow white hairs on thee,Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,All strange wonders that befell thee,And swear,No whereLives a woman true, and fair.""Or the reader may be reminded of the ""ten thousand things"" from the East.  In other words, ten thousand is a number that means ""many,"" but many in a very human way.At any rate, this man Robert is past the time in his life when he can, shall we say, perform.  But he knows women and he discerns Marie's desires which are to be taken completely.  He ties her up and she finds that she likes it, etc.Well, what's the resolution?  How should this end?  Should Paul wake up and really love her?  Or will she finally get completely disgusted with him and leave?  Or will he wake up and then be found boring.  Is that what he is afraid of?The way Breillat chooses to end the film is both a bit too easy and yet seems apt.  Notice that the title ""Romance"" is a kind of sardonic take on the ""pornography"" of romance novels.  Romance novels fulfill the wishes of the feminine reader but in a euphemistic and unspecific way.  The ""hard"" sex that Breillat presents (in a mostly soft way) in this film is only hinted at in romance novels.On the other hand, clearly in keeping with a good ending from a woman's point of view (in so far as a ""good"" ending is possible in this film) is the fact that Marie ends up with what in evolutionary psychology is called having her cake and eating it too.  She receives superior genes (or at least very attractive genes) for reproduction while winning the support of the man who will take care of her and her child.  In this case these are two different men.  Guess which one is which.Be forewarned that this is a MOST explicit film sexually speaking and will offend many viewers.One final question: did she have to kill the cat?",4,Who's perverted?,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,4985,"['[', 'Note', '500', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'book', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote', 'Get', 'Amazon', ']', 'Marie', 'Caroline', 'Ducey', 'perverted', 'be', 'used', 'abused', 'boyfriend', 'Paul', 'Sagamore', 'St', 'eacute', 'venin', 'who', 'perverted', 'love', 'need', 'control', 'Robert', 'Franois', 'Berl', 'eacute', 'who', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'chasing', 'seducing', 'women', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Breillat', 'who', 'France', 'sometimes', 'known', 'porno', 'auteuriste', 'better', 'yet', 'debased', 'mind', 'censor', 'prude', 'hypocrite', 'who', 'would', 'deny', 'range', 'human', 'sexuality', 'Breillat', 'point', 'view', 'censors', 'who', 'create', 'concept', 'obscenity.I', 'have', 'say', 'however', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'graphically', 'sexual', 'difficult', 'watch', 'being', 'aroused', 'such', 'movie', 'most', 'pornographic', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'not', 'pornography', 'se.Candor', 'sexuality', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'Even', 'rarer', 'woman', 'be', 'candid', 'sexuality', 'forum', 'might', 'include', 'men', 'fact', 'Catherine', 'Breillat', 'directed', 'film', 'not', 'mean', 'way', 'sexuality', 'central', 'character', 'Breillat', 'sexuality', 'mean', 'sexuality', 'presented', 'sympathetic', 'manner', 'true', 'least', 'women', 'least', 'time.In', 'effect', 'movie', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'question', 'do', 'women', 'want', 'be', 'used', 'abused', 'Breillat', 'cinematic', 'answer', 'bit', 'equivocation', 'think', 'what', 'saying', 'even', 'asking', 'such', 'questions', 'Breillat', 'experienced', 'hatred', 'been', 'denied', 'funding', 'true', 'artists', 'are', 'hated', 'Only', 'conformists', 'are', 'ever', 'adored', 'Marie', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'pretty', 'very', 'attractive', 'most', 'women', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'Not', 'completely', 'apparent', 'reason', 'almost', 'pathological', 'disinterest', 'not', 'just', 'rejected', 'inadequate', 'course', 'frustrated', 'crazy', 'everything', 'can', 'interest', 'avail', 'game', 'see', 'only', 'side', 'game', 'side', 'hardly', 'present', 'blond-haired', 'male', 'friend', 'hang', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'Paul', 'gay', ""n't"", 'know', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'it.Marie', 'first', 'guy', 'bar', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'feeling', 'part', 'aside', 'aside', 'what', 'desire', 'hurt', 'Paul', 'prove', 'herself', 'attractive', 'Then', 'Robert', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'sex', '10,000', 'women', 'anything', 'handsome', 'French', 'novelist', 'Georges', 'Simenon', 'who', 'made', 'same', 'claim', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Incidentally', '10,000', 'women', 'approximately', 'one', 'day', 'thirty', 'years', 'Viagra', 'sometimes', 'thought', 'length', 'man', 'sexually', 'active', 'life', 'readers', 'may', 'recall', 'lines', 'poem', 'Go', 'Catch', 'Falling', 'Star', 'John', 'Donne', 'Ride', 'ten', 'thousand', 'days', 'nights', 'Till', 'age', 'snow', 'white', 'hairs', 'thee', 'Thou', 'when', 'thou', ""return'st"", 'wilt', 'tell', 'strange', 'wonders', 'befell', 'thee', 'swear', 'No', 'woman', 'true', 'fair', 'reader', 'may', 'be', 'reminded', 'ten', 'thousand', 'things', 'East', 'other', 'words', 'ten', 'thousand', 'number', 'many', 'many', 'very', 'human', 'rate', 'man', 'Robert', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'can', 'shall', 'say', 'perform', 'women', 'Marie', 'desires', 'are', 'be', 'taken', 'completely', 'up', 'etc.Well', 'what', 'resolution', 'How', 'should', 'end', 'Should', 'Paul', 'wake', 'up', 'really', 'love', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'completely', 'disgusted', 'leave', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'then', 'be', 'found', 'boring', 'what', 'afraid', 'way', 'Breillat', 'end', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'easy', 'yet', 'apt', 'Notice', 'title', 'Romance', 'kind', 'sardonic', 'take', 'pornography', 'romance', 'novels', 'Romance', 'novels', 'fulfill', 'wishes', 'feminine', 'reader', 'euphemistic', 'unspecific', 'way', 'hard', 'sex', 'Breillat', 'presents', 'mostly', 'soft', 'way', 'film', 'only', 'hinted', 'romance', 'other', 'hand', 'clearly', 'keeping', 'good', 'ending', 'woman', 'point', 'view', 'so', 'far', 'good', 'ending', 'possible', 'film', 'fact', 'Marie', 'up', 'what', 'evolutionary', 'psychology', 'called', 'having', 'cake', 'eating', 'too', 'superior', 'genes', 'least', 'very', 'attractive', 'genes', 'reproduction', 'winning', 'support', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'child', 'case', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'men', 'Guess', 'one', 'which.Be', 'forewarned', 'MOST', 'explicit', 'film', 'sexually', 'speaking', 'will', 'offend', 'many', 'viewers.One', 'final', 'question', 'did', 'have', 'kill', 'cat']",N/A
545169,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00003JRAR,D. Mok,"[127, 133]","The words of Emmanuelle Beart (referring to her nude scenes in La Belle Noiseuse) came back to me as I watched Romance: ""I wasn't baring my ass, I was baring my soul.""So it is for Romance, a drama that has been called everything from ""sexiest movie ever made"" to ""pornography"". And on a strictly technical viewpoint, the terms apply -- with graphic depictions of fellatio, copulation, childbirth and all manners of sexual behaviour both conventional and alternative, Romance walks the fragile line between art and exploitation.What makes this film a great story instead of a series of sex scenes is its emotional approach. Director Catherine Breillat, who explored the subject of teenage sexuality in 36 Fillette with frankness and earnesty, applies the same approach to the sexual frustrations depicted in Romance. The graphic nudity, then, becomes not exploitation but attention to detail, and Breillat's choice of covering scenes with a series of sequence shots (the average running time of singular shots in this film is in minutes, not seconds) gives this film a painfully immediate, real-time feel. The use of long takes without cuts could not have been easy given the graphic sexual acts the actors have to simulate in the film. And the sequence shots are highly appropriate to the performances, capturing the actors' every beat. Caroline Ducey gives a brave performance as Marie, the frustrated teacher who tries to rediscover sex within a stifling relationship. The pressure of the graphic scenes and the character's staggering vulnerability give her performance a charge, and it is to Ducey's credit that her character's heart says much more than her oft-displayed body. By the end of the film the ironic, seemingly exploitative slug line comes true: ""Love is desolate, romance is temporary, sex is forever"". The final sequence of the film actually proves this to be a sincere statement in a sly, but also emotive way.This film could never have been made on American soil -- pointing to the cultural difference between the Gallic and American film scenes. From this difference also comes explanation of why Romance, despite its sincerity and the depth of the characters, was received with such outrage here. In France, nudity has been naturalized -- it is no longer a shock to see frontal nudity and frank depictions of sex. In America, on the other hand, onscreen nudity is considered a special occasion, the ""last resort"". It is quite frankly unimaginable to me that an American actress would have consented to doing what Ducey does here -- the eternal question being ""What can we get away with?"" Well, sometimes you can't think in terms of what you can ""get away with"". Breillat and Ducey, by opting to expose the character as they must for her to come alive, make the question moot. Imagine Romance as an airbrushed Hollywood product, with artfully executed Nicolas Roeg-style montages and dissolves for the sex scenes, and the story will fall apart.

This line could probably be used to sum up the whole theme of this film, which serves as a surreal metaphor for modern romantic relationships.This film hypothesizes that, during initial courtship, men have all the power in a relationship. They have a constant need to chase and conquer (to paraphrase a line spoken by Marie's vain boyfriend Paul), which opposes a woman's need to attach and commit. Once the initial chase has ended, the man loses interest. The result is that the woman finds herself degraded. And yet, when pregnancy enters the picture, the balance of power changes. In the film, Marie's boyfriend is literally destroyed at the moment she conceives his child.

In fact, it is rather redundant to call her work challenging because once the name Breillat is mentioned, you automatically assume it's challenging.  Many American critics are uncomfortable with her work because, methinks, that American critics are uncomfortable with sex.  If this film was made in the 1970's, it would have gotten more respect.  While the American general public would stay away from a film like this regardless of critical opinion, I get annoyed when critics dismiss her work as pretentious porn.  Quite often, reviews of her work (this film and Anatomy of Hell in particular) are usually hatchet jobs on her, not on the films itself.  The reviewers usually mention certain scenes, but never mention the context or their relationship to the whole film.  They don't seem really interested in understanding her work.  They seem uncomfortable with her, and essentially their reviews are reduced to name calling and bewilderment.  She really gets at the heart and soul of relationships.  The insight she has is rare in any age.  This film had numerous censorship problems worldwide (including an outright ban in Australia), which to me is absurd.  I have seen many of Breillat's films, and I recommend seeing them all.

However, like many other critics here I feel that if you take away the sex you are left with a deeply uninspiring film that coasts along on cod philosophy without courage or depth to explore true emotions.It's not that I disagree with the director's take on cinema, in many ways she is doing brave and important things. I just wish that she would do them better, and put them in a more relevant context. Breaking the boundaries of cinema should always be done; we should rail against a system which finds the thought of an erect penis shocking while the gore of a thousand horror films is commonplace. However, can't you have an interesting story as well?The acting is uniformly wooden. The actors are given admittedly little to work with, but the long lingering stares and fixed expressions fail to convey any emotion other than an ennui which I found affected the message of the film. How can this woman talk about passion, she doesn't look as though she has experienced a moment of passion in her life. Even the imagery was uninspired, though admittedly beautiful and very well done. A woman in a red dress in the center of a room, a white bedroom, accompanied with white cat. All are attractive to see, but so predictable they are empty signifier.Perhaps too much thought has gone into this film, perhaps too little. It seems to be little more than a manifesto for pushing back the boundaries, and only a film which connects to people on more levels will ever be truly successful in that objective.While I appreciate that this is a very stylized piece of cinema, I found the experience of watching people behave so unrealistically is quite boring.

Maybe it is my fault because I had the English sub-titles on with the French speaking... First off the sub-title font is old fashion block and the color of the subtitles is white well half of the movie's background is in white so you can't read the subtitles. If you should choose the dubbing then be prepared that it sounds like a really bad porn movie or even the old fashioned Karate films where it sounds like the dubbing was done in a echoed hallway and they don't even come close to matching the lip movement of the actors.The story the female is in a relationship with a boyfriend that doesn't have sex with her on the jacket cover it says she is fulfilled in everyway but this with him..... that is never clearly shown in the movie they have no connection what-so-ever. This movie is very French it drones on and on with metaphors and just a lot of blah, blah, blah of the female {Marie} talk about her views on sex and her female private parts . This is a very explicit movie I saw the unrated version and they showed a scene where she got a pap smear and the hospital was using her as a ""test subject"" so like (I think) 10 men performed a pap on her, they showed a rape scene that really (in my opinion) wasn't rape, 2 bondage scenes (reminded me of {The Secretary} and she from time to time tries to perform oral sex on her boyfriend to which they show his genitalia.The female in the movie played by Caroline Ducey decides to go out and find sex for herself since her boyfriend is not having any with her and (unless I missed it) it is never explained why he chooses not have sex with her. She has rules like no kissing, she doesn't want to look at the face of the person she is having sex with etc. etc. The policeman from the movie {Transporter} Franois Berl&eacute;an, is a coworker of hers whom she ends up with for some S&M; and she has a albeit brief interlude with a widower played by International porn star Rocco Siffredi.I would recommend that you rent this movie first before purchasing maybe it was so French that it was above my head and me being a American I lost what I was supposed to get from the dialogue.

545193,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00003JRAR,Robert J. Crawford,"[4, 4]","This is a very good, very French film.  From the reviews, it seems to have confused a great many people:  not only are the protagonists bizaarely unfathomable, but the young lady maintains this unbearably insipid dialogue going about what she is experiencing and why, a kind of cheesy left-bank philosophy that is off-putting.  However, these things should not be taken at face value, in my opinion, but as ironic view into the characters:  they are indeed lost idiots, clueless about how to live their lives without inflicting cruelties on anyone close to them, and thinking way too much in the self-important manner of pompous, dim-witted narcissists.  Those are the characters involved.  Breillat is painting a tableau, not talking directly to the audience via the confused young woman.The plot involves the retaliation of a pretty young woman against her boyfriend.  For whatever reason, he has lost all sexual interest in her and is abruptly cruel while openly flirting with other women.  She observes this in a heartbroken way, continually trying to seduce him - all graphically acted out - and yet she cannot bring herself to leave him.  This is odd because there is absolutely nothing interesting about him (or her for that matter), there is no emotion or warmth on display from either of them, and the passion if it ever existed is long dead.  So instead of leaving him, she decides to get even by seeking a series of ever more degrading sexual encounters.  It is horribly explicit, strange, and empty.This is not pornography because it is not meant to titillate.  The girl is sullen and blank in every one of the situations, never showing the slightest pleasure or interest in her partners.  Indeed, the only pleasure she shows is a fit of despairing auto-satisfaction, all the time describing to herself what she is feeling in a detached and idiotic voice, without real insight. Another artful twist is the long, unexplained sequences, when the viewer must guess what is happening.  They don't always make sense and are not tied off as you would expect in a hollywood film; this creates gaps that the viewer must fill in, must work to interpret.  That too is a trait of many good French films.  The funeral ending, for example, must be placed into the context of the film; it is not an obvious denouement.I enjoyed this on re-viewing, even if it is sad and cruel.

In an allegedly free society it is pretty much agreed that ""snuff"" films and ""kiddie porn"" are not acceptable, but where exactly do  depictions of actual sexual encounters belong when they are marketed in art house cinemas and on DVD, not as porn, but as elements of legit feature films?Sex has always been a staple of movies.  One way or another, all films are exploitation.  Voyeurism is why we watch movies. Recently, a handful of feature films have played with our fascination with observing human sexuality whether it be manifest as control, intimacy or rage.Strong reactions have followed in the wake of these movies.  Is it art, obscenity, porn or trash?  Does it lift the human spirit and inform? Does it titillate and entertain? Or does  incite and debase?The ironically titled ""ROMANCE"" has been available on DVD in an R-rated version for over a year.  It's a simple story about an ordinary looking young woman, a teacher, who looks for anonymous encounters when her model boyfriend won't have sex with her. However, director Catherine Breillat's much more sexually explicit unrated director's cut, is an altogether different film, emotionally anyway, that's a more jolting exploration of a neurotic schoolteacher's search for, well, it's not really sex, but validation via humiliation. It's finally a sad and depressing story that has not an iota of romance or even sensuality.  The sentiently detached sexual encounters with unattractive men are discomforting in their blunt visualization.  In fact, we are more inclined to feel for the humiliation of the actor playing the teacher. And when the suspension of disbelief is gone and it enters real life it's not particularly pleasant. That crossover of emotional empathy is perhaps the whole purpose, or trick,  of the movie.

Take a boring French movie about a woman looking for sex  or love or something like that (she never shuts up so you get kind of  confused as to what she's talking about) that is advertised as the explicit  sex movie and then take out all the scenes where she's doing it. I was told  that there was penetration. I didn't see any penetration. I fast forwarded  through most of this thing, but the 15 minutes that I did see in real time  were excrutiating. Actually the fast forwarded no-dialogue scenes were  fairly dull as well.It's the USA station of art flicks to watch the R  rated version.Many reviewers chide American movies for not making  movies like this. We do, they are called pornos and if you want a movie  like the R rated version you watch Spice Pay-Per-View. THere is one  difference, the bad dialogue between sex scenes is entertaining in  places.I don't care if French people have a &quot;mature&quot; attitude  towards nudity and sexuality. Since it leads to utterly dull movies like  this one, &quot;maturity&quot; is vastly overrated. I prefer Groucho Marx's  answer to the question &quot;Is sex dirty?&quot;. His response: &quot;Only  if you are doing it right.&quot;They definitely don't do it right in  this movie.If you like pretentious movies with hardcore sex, watch  either Realm of the Senses or Betty Blue (the latter of which they might  not be doing it for real but it sure looks like it). If you want arty sex  movies, watch either Unberable Lightness of Being or Henry &amp; June.
