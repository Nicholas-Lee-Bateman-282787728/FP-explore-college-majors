This ""Power of Myth"" series is a great landmark of American television. Few are as charismatic and knowledgeable of this subject matter and as natural a teacher as Campbell. It is a pleasure just listening to the old man recount the old stories and make them come alive. Imagine sitting at a campfire with Campbell as your storyteller. Something in you would be touched as you participate in a ritual older than civilization and as old as our race. The Power of Myth is as close as you can get to being with Campbell at the campfire. But he mostly gets asked a lot of good questions. Questions you'd want to ask him about what it all means, after you hear his retelling of a great tale. Recorded in the late 1980s, shortly before Joseph Campbell's death, it is the culmination of his long, influential life as our society's greatest teacher of the old myths, spiritual traditions, and folklore. It is also one of the great accomplishments in the long and remarkable career of arguably one of America's greatest journalists Bill Moyers.To this day people are discovering this series and being inspired and it will continue to inspire for many years to come. *Power* of myth. There is power here. Campbell was primarily interested in how these stories could empower YOU. He talked much about societal functions these myths had, but what is best about Campbell seems to me, now years after discovering him, is the inspirational aspect of his work -to the individual- and the delight it provides to your imagination. Worlds open up. Ancient and seemingly eternal. Many have gone before you and many will come after you. You relate to this chain and do not feel alone. Reading Campbell is *fun*. The guy has been accused of being right-wing. Don't know about that. Don't care. Campbell is a humanist. Maybe he'd disagree? But his work is humanistic. Yes, there are debates about Campbell's interpretation of myths and religions. I actually agree with some fundamental criticisms, but I still appreciate this series and very much value my experience of it and I value Campbell's work.",5,story time,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2135,"['Highly', 'recommended', 'Get', 'rent', 'library', 'Power', 'Myth', 'series', 'great', 'landmark', 'American', 'television', 'Few', 'are', 'charismatic', 'knowledgeable', 'subject', 'matter', 'natural', 'teacher', 'Campbell', 'pleasure', 'just', 'listening', 'old', 'man', 'old', 'stories', 'make', 'come', 'alive', 'Imagine', 'sitting', 'campfire', 'Campbell', 'storyteller', 'Something', 'would', 'be', 'touched', 'participate', 'ritual', 'older', 'civilization', 'as', 'old', 'race', 'Power', 'Myth', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'being', 'Campbell', 'campfire', 'mostly', 'asked', 'lot', 'good', 'questions', 'Questions', ""'d"", 'want', 'ask', 'what', 'means', 'hear', 'retelling', 'great', 'tale', 'Recorded', 'late', '1980s', 'shortly', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'death', 'culmination', 'long', 'influential', 'life', 'society', 'greatest', 'teacher', 'old', 'myths', 'spiritual', 'traditions', 'folklore', 'also', 'one', 'great', 'accomplishments', 'long', 'remarkable', 'career', 'arguably', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'journalists', 'Bill', 'Moyers.To', 'day', 'people', 'are', 'discovering', 'series', 'being', 'inspired', 'will', 'continue', 'inspire', 'many', 'years', 'come', '*Power*', 'myth', 'power', 'here', 'Campbell', 'was', 'primarily', 'interested', 'how', 'stories', 'could', 'empower', 'YOU', 'talked', 'much', 'societal', 'functions', 'myths', 'had', 'what', 'best', 'about', 'Campbell', 'now', 'years', 'discovering', 'inspirational', 'aspect', 'work', '-to', 'individual-', 'delight', 'imagination', 'Worlds', 'open', 'up', 'Ancient', 'seemingly', 'eternal', 'Many', 'have', 'gone', 'many', 'will', 'come', 'relate', 'chain', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'alone', 'Reading', 'Campbell', '*fun*', 'guy', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'right-wing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Campbell', 'humanist', 'Maybe', ""'d"", 'disagree', 'work', 'humanistic', 'Yes', 'are', 'debates', 'Campbell', 'interpretation', 'myths', 'religions', 'actually', 'agree', 'fundamental', 'criticisms', 'still', 'appreciate', 'series', 'very', 'much', 'value', 'experience', 'value', 'Campbell', 'work']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS
378090,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,6303503381,Andrew Parodi,"[17, 17]","THE POWER OF MYTH is one of my favorite programs. In this six-part series of interviews with Bill Moyer, Joseph Campbell comes across as an incredibly gentle and insightful man with an extraordinary way of demonstrating how the different cultures of the world have much in common. He notes that many themes and myths can be found in varying forms throughout the world and throughout time. (I think it is important to know that by ""myth"" Joseph Campbell means ""sacred teaching,"" not ""untrue belief or superstition."" Myths themselves may not be true, but they demonstrate principles that are true.)The aspect of THE POWER OF MYTH that has had the most profound impact on me is the discussion on women and nature. Bill Moyers comments that in many myths it is woman who is blamed for the difficulties in life. Campbell explains that this is because woman represents life, and life, in the Judaic and Christian view, is something that is wrong ... unless one has been baptized or circumcised. Campbell elaborates to say that the Judaic and Christian view is based on the insights into the duality of life - ""good and bad,"" ""right and wrong,"" ""life and death,"" ""sin and atonement"" - and that when you have a culture based on insights into duality, you get a mythology that tends to be ethical. ""The whole thing started with a sin,"" Campbell says to Moyers, referring to Eve's mistake in the Garden of Eden. Man, of course, does not enter this world of dualities, with all its potential for pain, but by woman, hence the blame often heaped on womankind.Campbell seems to indicate that in the Western worldview life is seen as a battle against nature (with which woman is inevitably linked), and that, surprisingly, Eastern cultures do not generally hold this view. Or at least they do not believe this as strongly as we do in the West. In the East, nature is not generally seen as something that must be fought against.I love THE POWER OF MYTH, and I love Joseph Campbell!",5,Changed my perception of myself and the world,1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,1966,"['POWER', 'OF', 'MYTH', 'one', 'favorite', 'programs', 'six-part', 'series', 'interviews', 'Bill', 'Moyer', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'across', 'incredibly', 'gentle', 'insightful', 'man', 'extraordinary', 'way', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'different', 'cultures', 'world', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'many', 'themes', 'myths', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'varying', 'forms', 'world', 'time', 'think', 'important', 'know', 'myth', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'sacred', 'teaching', 'not', 'untrue', 'belief', 'superstition', 'Myths', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'demonstrate', 'principles', 'are', 'true', 'aspect', 'THE', 'POWER', 'OF', 'MYTH', 'had', 'most', 'profound', 'impact', 'discussion', 'women', 'nature', 'Bill', 'Moyers', 'comments', 'many', 'myths', 'woman', 'who', 'blamed', 'difficulties', 'life', 'Campbell', 'woman', 'life', 'life', 'Judaic', 'Christian', 'view', 'something', 'wrong', 'one', 'been', 'baptized', 'circumcised', 'Campbell', 'say', 'Judaic', 'Christian', 'view', 'based', 'insights', 'duality', 'life', 'good', 'bad', 'right', 'wrong', 'life', 'death', 'sin', 'atonement', 'when', 'have', 'culture', 'based', 'insights', 'duality', 'get', 'mythology', 'be', 'ethical', 'whole', 'thing', 'started', 'sin', 'Campbell', 'Moyers', 'referring', 'Eve', 'mistake', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'Man', 'course', 'not', 'enter', 'world', 'dualities', 'potential', 'pain', 'woman', 'hence', 'blame', 'often', 'heaped', 'womankind.Campbell', 'indicate', 'Western', 'worldview', 'life', 'seen', 'battle', 'nature', 'woman', 'inevitably', 'linked', 'surprisingly', 'Eastern', 'do', 'not', 'generally', 'hold', 'view', 'least', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'as', 'strongly', 'do', 'West', 'East', 'nature', 'not', 'generally', 'seen', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'fought', 'against.I', 'love', 'THE', 'POWER', 'OF', 'MYTH', 'love', 'Joseph', 'Campbell']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS

(Sinatra's Concert for the Americas and Doo Wop revivals are big in my area.)The charismatic, enthused and quite brilliant Campbell taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 38 years. I would've loved to have attended his courses. He has a way of making the most abstract concepts easily understood, seems to relish recounting fables first spoken by ancient teachers and shamans, and always returns to his main theme: find your bliss, and do it in the here and now.Journalist and ex-LBJ staffer Bill Moyers interviews Campbell from the proper position of  student to teacher. ""Joe"" as Moyers calls him, reacts happily when his pupil grasps what he's saying, and rephrases a thought when he doesn't. Teacher is patient when Moyers doesn't agree on the meaning of life or divinity, but he never goes off-message, instead pointing out  examples from his own past that powerfully support his views..The sixth and final chapter has a moment that really resonates for me. It was taped just a few months before 83-year-old Campbell's death.At one point during this discussion of eternity, the professor mentions that he's lost many friends and his parents, yet realizes that they still live within him. I'm more black & white on this. A memory is an intangible, untouchable thing. No matter how vivid, it's not the same as seeing, hearing or being with lost ones. Yet, I recognize that they do sometimes surface in my most powerfully emotional dreams. In that subconscious realm, they truly exist.I suppose Campbell would've refuted my view in his good-natured way and left me to reassess.  And that is the true joy of this series of talks: they cause you think about things you'd never even considered and appreciate more those that have long been a part of your life..CONTENT--#1 - ""The Hero's Adventure"" - Citing George Lucas'STAR WARSand ancient folktales in this hour interview, the professor illustrates that the hero's striving is metaphor for struggles that occur within us all.#2 - ""The Message of the Myth"" - Common themes across the ages oin God and creation. Religions change as the world does. The four functions of myths.#3 - ""The First Storytellers"" - Native American myths. Cave paintings in America and France. Manhood rituals of primitive tribes.#4 -  ""Sacrifice and Bliss"" - Plant mythology. Stages of marriage. Legend of Gawain and the Green Knight. ""Follow your bliss!""#5 - ""Love and the Goddess"" - Tristan & Isolde. The goddess cults. Christian themes in earlier religions.#6 - ""Masks of Eternity"" - The energy of the Universe.

378096,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6303503381,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[204, 215]","When I first watched the Moyers-Campbell exchange in the early 1990s on PBS, I understood very little of what Campbell said. I was still &quot;seeing&quot; myths, etc. from the &quot;disciplined&quot; perspectives of religion or science (psychology, structural anthropology, etc.) and I tried to fit his comments into &quot;my&quot; world view.I have just finished rewatching the DVD version of these taped interviews, and I now understand more of what Campbell is saying. I've been watching this series with another person who is &quot;searching&quot; and he keeps saying &quot;I don't get that.&quot;  I want to help him &quot;get it&quot; and I sometimes feel I must appear like Burt Reynolds in one of his films where he took a &quot;New Age&quot; course and rolled on the floor and said &quot;I've got it!!&quot; Campbell says, when you think you've got it you haven't. So all I can say is--I feel I've got something more than I had.Campbell says human beings will die for a metaphor. We are like the 10 blind men with the elephant--each with a part of the whole, interpreting it through our cultural spectacles. And many of us will die for our interpretation of what &quot;God&quot; is.  Even the word &quot;God&quot; is connotive of a belief system. One has only to look at the ideological conflicts the world over to see the results of differing world views. And, it isn't just &quot;religion&quot; either. Beliefs systems underlie economic behaviour as well. Everyone has a belief system--the alternative is madness, which is probably yet another belief system of some sort.For those raised in a religious tradition (most of us) the notion of giving up the idea of a personal god is painful. And yet, Campbell says one must give up this idea--and that is all it is--an idea. Something you have conceived and believe. Think about it -- &quot;personal god&quot; -- the divine as interpreted by a human (person). Who can do that??Our metaphors (idea of the divine) form the organizing priciples we address through myths. These myths are the communal poetry of our group, and do what plain old language cannot --approach the divine. Still, singly they fall short.Campbell compiled and studied myths from around the world and he said these myths reflect the human experience of the divine--or whatever you want to call IT. Of course, I can hear my old anthropology professor saying you cannot lift a &quot;myth&quot; like a sack of flour. The best any of us can do regarding other people's myths is interpret them via our own myths.At any rate, Campbell has studied myths and seems to think they are like the many strands of fiber in a tapestry--each reflecting a particular aspect of an attribute of the divine and togther they form a whole cloth. He says these reflections or threads and even the cloth should not be confused with the &quot;thing that stands behind.&quot;By what authoritiy does any of us call another's religion &quot;savage&quot; &quot;backward&quot; &quot;barbaric&quot; or worse? Oh I admit, I find some &quot;old time&quot; religions pretty scary and some modern ones too. Campbell says we should not judge...but it is hard not to judge, and if I judge, I use my own interpretation of what is true and good for me.Campbell was not a religious man at the end of his life, although he began life as a Roman Catholic. One might describe him as a spiritual man. He seems to have believed in a higher power or a divine--something. I think he felt it permeated everything and belonged to everyone and to no one and that no human could fully apprehend it.

Jung in College and was introduced to Campbell's written work at that time. It was all very intriguing, but for whatever reason, I never followed up with it then. Not too long after that, my local PBS station ran the entire ""Power of Myth"" series one weekend as a marathon, complete with pledge breaks. I taped it then and for reasons I can't now imagine, I didn't bother watching the series until some years later when I was trying to sort through my tapes. But when I did, it changed me.In the series, Campbell was able to easily articulate so many ideas that I knew were true, but never knew how to truly grasp or say myself. They also gave me inspiration and courage I didn't know I had in me. I've since then watched the series (or listened to the outstanding CD audio release) many, many, many times. I've read Campbell's ""Hero with a Thousand Faces"" cover to cover a few times over and I'm still making my way through his ""Masks of God"" books.""The Power of Myth"" forced me to really examine myself, what I was doing with my life, and how I was living it. Five years or so after first seeing the series, I left my very comfortable, very glamorous, very secure corporate job and set out to take the risk and ""follow my bliss."" And now, two years after that, I'm in the midst of following my bliss and while it isn't always easy, there's no question that I'm on the right path and I'm happy and stimulated in ways that I only fantasized about before. Campbell's body of work - and ""The Power of Myth"" specifically - really did change my life for the better and its a reference point which I return to time and again.The DVD release of ""The Power of Myth"" is vastly superior to the old VHS release simply for convenience and durability's sake alone. As an extra, the DVD also adds a bonus Bill Moyers interview with George Lucas in which Lucas discusses mythology. It's a welcome addition to be sure, but why not release the entire hour long ""Mythology of Star Wars"" interview which this interview was excerpted from? I'm glad I still have my PBS taped VHS of that one!Anyway, I'm certainly not complaining. Perhaps ""The Power of Myth"" won't have the same effect on others that it has had on me, and that's fine. Go ahead...live your life...you don't need Joseph Campbell interviews to do that. But ""The Power of Myth"" changed - and continues to change - the course of my life for the better and I'll be forever grateful for that.",5,A Life Changing Series,1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,2619,"['know', 'sound', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'even', 'trite', 'say', 'television', 'series', 'truly', 'changed', 'life', 'case', 'Power', 'Myth', 'really', 'true.I', 'studied', 'C.G', 'Jung', 'College', 'was', 'introduced', 'Campbell', 'written', 'work', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'reason', 'never', 'followed', 'up', 'then', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'ran', 'entire', 'Power', 'Myth', 'series', 'one', 'weekend', 'marathon', 'complete', 'pledge', 'breaks', 'taped', 'then', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'now', 'imagine', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'series', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'sort', 'tapes', 'when', 'did', 'changed', 'me.In', 'series', 'Campbell', 'was', 'able', 'easily', 'articulate', 'so', 'many', 'ideas', 'knew', 'were', 'true', 'never', 'knew', 'how', 'truly', 'grasp', 'say', 'also', 'gave', 'inspiration', 'courage', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', ""'ve"", 'then', 'watched', 'series', 'listened', 'outstanding', 'CD', 'audio', 'release', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Campbell', 'Hero', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'cover', 'cover', 'few', 'times', ""'m"", 'still', 'making', 'way', 'Masks', 'God', 'books', 'Power', 'Myth', 'forced', 'really', 'examine', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'life', 'how', 'was', 'living', 'Five', 'years', 'so', 'first', 'seeing', 'series', 'left', 'very', 'comfortable', 'very', 'glamorous', 'very', 'secure', 'corporate', 'job', 'set', 'out', 'take', 'risk', 'follow', 'bliss', 'now', 'two', 'years', ""'m"", 'midst', 'following', 'bliss', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'question', ""'m"", 'right', 'path', ""'m"", 'happy', 'stimulated', 'ways', 'only', 'fantasized', 'before', 'Campbell', 'body', 'work', 'Power', 'Myth', 'specifically', 'really', 'did', 'change', 'life', 'better', 'reference', 'point', 'return', 'time', 'again.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'Power', 'Myth', 'vastly', 'superior', 'old', 'VHS', 'release', 'simply', 'convenience', 'durability', 'sake', 'alone', 'extra', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'Bill', 'Moyers', 'interview', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Lucas', 'mythology', 'welcome', 'addition', 'be', 'sure', 'why', 'not', 'release', 'entire', 'hour', 'long', 'Mythology', 'Star', 'Wars', 'interview', 'interview', 'was', 'excerpted', ""'m"", 'glad', 'still', 'have', 'PBS', 'taped', 'VHS', 'one', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'complaining', 'Perhaps', 'Power', 'Myth', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'others', 'had', 'fine', 'Go', 'ahead', 'live', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'interviews', 'do', 'Power', 'Myth', 'changed', 'change', 'course', 'life', 'better', ""'ll"", 'be', 'forever', 'grateful']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS

This collection of videos provides the most accessible view of Joseph Campbell's contribution to modern thought.  Inspired by psychology, religion, anthropology, poetry, and most importantly, mythology, Joseph Campbell set out to teach the world to seek their spot in the world alive with magic and myth.  &quot;Follow Your Dream&quot; is the resounding message of his philosophy, not some intellectually dull and world negating philosophy that is only understandable to philosophy professors.Bill Moyers does a decent job of presenting Joseph Campbell in these videos, though his questions are sometimes banal and ethnocentric.  This may work to the viewers advantage however, for we get to see Joseph Campbell explain the joy and the wonder of life in many different aspects.  The series expands to speak of love, ancient religions, and the mythologies of all corners of life.  The deities of the Greeks, Celts, Native Americans, Indians and more are all discussed in the context of their importance to the human relationship to the divine.The advantage of these videos is to actually see and hear Joseph Campbell, whose attitude is refreshingly energetic and joyful.

378101,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,6303503381,Earl Hazell,"[127, 129]","Of my two favorite memories of Campbell's talks with Bill Moyers of PBS in this video, the one that comes to mind is an introduction between Campbell and a Catholic Priest, perhaps a Cardinal, that he retells. After they are introduced and the Priest is told who Dr. Campbell is and a little about his life, he asks him, ""Are you still Catholic?"" To which he replies ""No, Father."" He then asks--and Campbell was impressed by his specificity--""Do you believe in a *personal* God?"" To which Campbell replies, ""No, Father.""The Priest then replies, almost as if to engage in a debate and denigrate the atheist's worship of the rational mind uber alles simultaneously (and an atheist is what you are led to assume he thinks Campbell is), ""Well, I guess there is no way to logically prove the existence of God."" And Campbell answers, calmly, ""If there were Father, what would be the value of faith?""""It's been a pleasure meeting you Dr. Campbell, have a nice day.""Regardless of your faith, interest, background or education, you will find yourself in the same shoes of that Priest when you watch this incredibly enjoyable DVD set. Campbell's erudition and knowledge of the many ideas, subtexts and similarities inherent in the world's treasure trove of mythology is daunting to say the least, and his approach is designed to have it all make sense to the modern human heart.  And Bill Moyers, whose worst day as a journalist surpasses many in the business' finest, is at the compassionate and intuitive top of his intellectual game here; he conintuously asks the kind of transcendentally-inspired questions that don't just allow Campbell to riff on the oceanic themes of his knowledge, but make their interview-turned-conversations as joyful and illuminating to watch as Miles and Coltrane playing the blues is to listen to.THE POWER OF MYTH, the book, may be the best book written to serve as a doorway to the eternal wisdom of mythology, as it manifests itself in the wisdom, theology, art and entertainment of every culture--not to mention our personal lives.  But the very popular book is simply a printing of chunks of this all-inclusive video set, recorded as it appeared on PBS some fifteen years ago, now digitally recorded on this DVD set.  As such, they are a must have.To say these DVDs will make you think is almost denigrating it; it will make you ponder. It will lead you (after quite possibly confusing the hell out of you, as you try to absorb it into a preexisting way of thinking that may become obsolete via what Campbell teaches) to wonder, the way children wonder. And in the end, I was understating its power in the title of my review; it will make you smile from the soul, not just from the heart.I highly recommend this as an introduction to the fascinating and redemptive world of mythology in general and the labyrinthian mind of Joseph Campbell in particular.

He has the prodigious breadth of knowledge to see universal themes where many see only bizarre cultural differences.  He discusses what the cave paintings at Lascaux have in common with Chartres cathedral, why the paintings of Picasso and Klee, and the writings of Joyce and Mann, serve the same role in society as the rituals of Native Americans and Australian Aborigines, and how western society has become largely estranged from nature and thereby from authentic culture, mythology, and ritual.  His central point is that all genuine myths lead us to an understanding of the divine; that the divine is perhaps best defined as the experience available to each one of us of the sheer rapture and existence; and that each moment of consciousness is also an experience of eternity.

I was always confused about religions, myths, spiritualism, and even life, and the inspiration found by this series helped me to better find myself and my place in the world. Campbell had a truly rare understanding of myth, the unconscious self, and spiritual existence I think. Watching this series for the first time, his words were like hammers pounding upon my brain with simple, easy truths that I think I've always known deep inside, but hadn't realized through all the complex and demanding materialism of the adult world. This is it. This is life. The adventure. You can be the &quot;hero&quot; of the adventure, or the dragon which plagues your world. (So to speak, of course the &quot;dragon&quot; tends to represent the threat of the ego (in the western world.)Keep in mind, I am totally bias towards Campbell. He was the only person in my life who ever really moved me, and changed my life. Looking at this material objectively, I can say that it deals with our perceptions of life, of how the old stories speak to us of wisdom, if we can open our ears, so to speak. Myth is a beautiful but mystical thing. One can hear the words and receive the example, or even get the point, and miss the inspiration. Language is after all just a vessel to get across an idea (cargo.) We so often focus on the vessel and miss the cargo. Myth carries with it a fantastic yet simple vessel, but without getting the cargo one could never take in its purpose. By that I mean to say that if you do not have an open dock (open mind), then stay clear of this vessel. (It's too big for you.)WHAT IS IT?This is a series of talks, a casual interview between Bill Moyers and Professor Joseph Campbell. It was filmed (in part) by George Lucas' studio, and some interviews were conducted in Lucas' home. The talks are about the origins and intentions of myth, their value to us, and myths of our world today -- mainly &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Ancient myths are the biggest topic however, and these range from Japanese to Native American to Egyptian to Greek to Mayan myths, and more. The topics here -- birth, life, danger, adulthood, loss, death -- could be overwhelming, but Campbell has a genius for simplifying it for those of us who haven't studied mythology all are lives can understand. Part of the reason for that is that Campbell truly gets what he says, and so he doesn't require arrogance or manipulation to move us. He speaks the revealed, skinless truth about who we are, how we live, and how we should live -- according to myth, and just basic wisdom.Ultimately &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; is about wisdom, and believe me, it can help you to find your natural path in life. There are no answers here however -- as Campbell says: &quot;A teacher can only serve as a lighthouse, and say &quot;Careful, rocks over here.'&quot;This DVD set also features an interview with George Lucas, biographies of both Campbell and Moyers, weblinks, and a 'selected videography'.

378109,A2RNUPVSNW1ZXX,6303503381,Heather Walton,"[3, 3]","Joseph Campbell was an amazing man full of insight and understanding of the religions of the world and how they all are the same metaphorically, and they all share common themes since the dawn of time. I will share some of his perceptions and thoughts that are reoccurring throughout this 6-hour DVD. Every chapter is spellbinding, delightful and distinctive. There is a wealth of information here that will inspire anyone to a spiritual life and the wonders of the great mysteries of life and God as Campbell sees him. Joseph Campbell was an enlightened man full of the wonder and joy of life. Just watching him I feel a deep sense of connection to God and the mysteries of the universal cosmic truths.Myths and dreams are transformations of consciousness and are the way to a deep rich life of mystery; transforming thought. The Ego is the dragon holding you in and keeping you small. Following your bliss by doing what brings you vitality within yourself saves the world. The Buddha says that Nirvana is a psychological state of mind that is not compelled by desire, fear or social commitments or acting out of our own center. We are all seeking an experience of being alive; we are not seeking meaning of life since there is none really. It's the inner value we seek and it is not in what we do. The ultimate mystery of being transcends thought and cannot be understood. God is transcendent and God is within our world, others and us. Eternity is here and now. This is it and we must get it from within ourselves not out there and not after we die!  We cannot concretize that symbols as fact. Jesus did not ascend up but within us. All the symbols are metaphors and are not fact. We are all manifestations of Buddha consciousness. Jesus is within us all just as are heaven, and Hell and all the Gods. Inward we are the source. All religions are true for their time. Open up to the mysteries of life of all things, and make a choice to stay in your life and realize the truth and depth of your experience of your own being through consciousness and bliss. Experience it here and now.Do not judge. Open-up and love thy enemy. These, Campbell says, are Jesus' greatest teachings.We need to shift the perception to joyful participation in the sorrows of life and everything changes. Find the immoveable center within yourself and we can survive anything and float down the stream of life. To save the world we must save ourselves. The influence of a vital person vitalizes the world. The world is a wasteland and we cannot save the world by shifting it around. Bring it to life by being alive yourself.Choose to affirm life. Life is great say yes to it. It is a childish way of thinking to say no to life with all its pain. We all participate in evil. No matter what we do it's evil to somebody. If all the universe is Divine how can we say no to anything in the world? Brutality, stupidity, thoughtless ness and suffering; we must say yes. Affirm the world and life. We are not to judge anything. This is the greatest teaching of Jesus. Affirm both good and evil. Do not withdrawal from the world when you realize how horrible it is, but see the horror as the foreground of a wonder. Come back and participate in it.To be spiritual we need a deep sense of mystery of the dimension of the universe that is not available to the senses. Divinity is the realization of wonder that is much larger then the human dimension. Divinity is just what we think. God is a metaphor of what is guiding you and comes from within. The transcendent mystery is where we come from and we do not have to identify it. I am the vehicle radiant of the spirit, as we all are. The virgin birth is the symbol of the birth of the heart to the awakening of the spiritual life in accord with another or a principle. To not be driven by the lower centers of lust, greed, power and wanting but to be driven from the compassion of the heart to open-up to the realization that God is within the other and us; a whole new life comes.The ultimate mystery is finding God within you. That God is within us just as he is within the earth and all of nature and everything. God is everywhere. This is the real truth- He is not up in the sky separate from us, but within us and around us supporting us always, and we just need to become awake to this fact. I can see why the goal is to die before we die. To die to our animal and material nature and become reborn to the spiritual nature, which is our true nature.And he often mentions how we are to live our lives in accord with nature and to worship nature just as most of the world does. Western Christian thought sees nature as fallen and our religion is one of exile that nature is fallen and evil. This is ridiculous Campbell says because what else do we have to worship then nature? All other religions but Christianity, teach to live in accord with nature and the God's are much more elemental of the earth. We come from the earth and are a part of the Earth not separate from it.Here is a quote from Chief Seattle that Campbell dictates and lives by:""Will you teach your children what we teach our children, that the earth is our mother? What befalls the earth befalls all the sons of the earth. Earth does not belong to man; Man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. What he does to the web he does to himself. One thing we know, our God is also your God. The earth is precious to him and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator. Your destiny is a mystery to us. What will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered? The wild horses tamed? What will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of man? When the view of the ripe hills is blocked by talking wires? Where will the thicket be? Gone. Where will the eagle be? Gone. What is it to say goodbye to the swift pony and the hunt? The end of living and the beginning of survival.""",5,A gift from above that transformed my life,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,6001,"['Joseph', 'Campbell', 'was', 'amazing', 'man', 'full', 'insight',

A man of vision, unpretentious, strong in his convictions but compassionate in our journey into the unconscious.In Joseph Campbell's association with George Lucas in the ""Star Wars Trilogy"", we can experience the plight of our humanity, birth, death and resurrection.  We are all heroes if we can experience this transformation.  This is not an easy journey and we can choose to go through these stages or at times we are forced to take these steps.  It is more painful to be unprepared for a change in our lives and Joseph Campbell helps us to focus on the small things so that we can be prepared for the larger changes.Sooner or later we have to face up to our unconscious.  We have to detach ourselves from ourselves and not take things at face value.  There is so much more that needs to be experienced and dealt with so that we can transcend to our next life.  We have to die to our ego and look inward in our deepest self because this is where and what we are made of;  not our successes in our jobs, not the way we look on the outside, not our money, our prestigious homes and cars, these things shall pass away but our soul/spirit shall live forever.We need to find the courage to change the things we can and let go and accept the things that we cannot change and ask God to give us the wisdom to know the difference.Other books that I would recommend are Morton Kelsey's ""The Other Side of Silence: Meditation for the Twenty-First Century (Revised)"" and Carl Jung's ""Memories, Dreams, Reflections"".

I had run headlong not only into culture shock but also the fact that, for a non-Christian country, the Japanese seemed to be embodying Christian ideals far better than the West.In walked Campbell. Amazing. I have watched these videos over the years literally hundreds of times and have always enjoyed them. Campbell's story-telling is elegant and always a balm for the day-tired soul seeking solace in the living room reclined before a television.I really cannot commend the tapes highly enough. They are preferable to the other videotapes in which Campbell flies solo, usually before a crowd which is either mildly hostile or hasn't done its homework. The cordial and informed interaction with Bill Moyers in George Lucas' elegant private library, and the frequent segues to cinema, artwork, and beautiful clips of foreign locales, make the programs a delight again and again.The first program deals with the hero's  adventure, and is liberally laced with Star Wars' scenes. The second discusses the significance of denotation versus connotation in Christian theology, and includes one Star Wars scene (Vader's death). The remaining episodes range all over the world and hammer home Campbell's (and Moyers') thesis that all religions are true in this sense: They are true as metaphorical of the inner spiritual potentialities of men and women. This is more or less identical to J.R.R. Tolkien's view of mythology, of course.Particularly fascinating is the footage of a South Pacific cannibalistic ""horror society"" re-enacting THE myth and Campbell's interpretation of it - the death and eating of the god. The male-female pair to be consumed engage in a public, ritual sexual intercourse, are slain in flagrante dilicto, and are immediately cooked and eaten. ""That's the sacrifice of the Mass"", Campbell points out.""There [in Roman Catholic ritual] you are taught that this IS the body and blood of the Saviour."" One is reminded of Campbell's elsewhere quoting St. Paul: ""Those forms which were merely mythological forms are now incarnate in our Saviour.""Is there a proviso to my bubbling over about this fascinating six-hour master class in Humanities? Yes. Definitely. My personal opinion is Campbell never received instruction in the Aristotelian-Thomist tradition of the Roman Catholic religion he forsook, as his thinking is not so much clear as agnostic, Modernist, and idiosyncratic. He knows less theology than the cat. But if you are willing to ignore Campbell's unsurpassed non-comprehension of theology and his conviction that all religions are true and no religion is true, and can content yourself with focusing on his expertise in Humanities, he's a stellar teacher.",5,This is it!

378116,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,6303503381,JR Pinto,"[15, 16]","The problem with studying philosophy is that it gives a lot of theories, tears down a lot of ideas, and teaches you to ask a lot of questions.  The problem arises when one wants the answers to those questions.  The wrong answer is, ""Don't ask those questions anymore.""  That is the answer of Analytic Philosophy.  Since (the last time I checked) they hold sway in the philosophical community - I've left current philosophy behind.  Joseph Campbell, on the other hand, demands that we ask those questions and (through his works) will act as a mentor for us to finding the answers.The answers not only can be found, but they have ALWAYS been there - and they are revealed through religion and mythology.  Campbell, who spent his life studying the religions of the world, will say that ""All religions are the same and all religions are true!""  He says, in order to find the inherent truth in the religion, one must look for the MEANING behind the METAPHOR and give that priority over the actual nuts and bolts of one's religion (like the way Christ criticized the Pharisees for following ""the Letter of the Law, but not the Spirit of the Law."").  The myths act as a guide through life - they tell us what to do, what not to do, what to believe, and what values to hold.  It is important because, much of Campbell's advice goes against popular wisdom.  ""Follow your bliss,"" not ""try to make money.""  If you don't do want you want to do...if you don't risk anything and do what you think you are SUPPOSED to do, you probably won't be a very happy person.The emphasis is definitely on the practical application of the myth, as embodied by all the cultures of the world.  To that end, Campbell's favorite subject is The Hero.  All the heroes of mythology have certain characteristics and, from them, we learn to live our lives.  It is well known that George Lucas was a disciple of his and Star Wars owes much to Campbell.  It is only fitting that Campbell (in these interviews) talks about Star Wars and how it embodies these myths for a new generation.

Schultz ""msthoth""","[211, 243]","This series of videos is a true eye-opener and life-changer for anyone who is serious about seeking after the Divine, no matter what religion you may practise.  Joseph Campbell examines the sacred symbolic stories that have existed in every culture, all over the world, with respect for all of them and denigrating none.  At the same time he also strives to drive home the idea that these links to the Divine are not divine in themselves but are paths to knowledge and enlightenment.  One segment, Masks of Eternity, talks about the many ways in which God speaks to us or appears to us-- some of them silly, some of them scary, some of them profound-- all of them simply masks.  The mask of God, or our perception of Him, is often the hardest thing of all to get past in a true search to touch the Divine.  In a sense it gives us permission and encouragement to study and appreciate all forms of religious practise, without ever asking one to give up one's deeply-held beliefs. Indeed, no matter what where one goes to worship or what label one claims to denote one's religious philosophy, this series will help you appreciate your own beliefs even more.  Watch this series and free your mind; remember that God is infinite and none have grasped His Magnificence in all of its myriad forms-- setting your attitudes free will make Him visible in more ways than ever before.

How should we view myth? What sort of approach should we take towards our religion? Our Faith?I think the most important thing I was taught here was that the whole world pondered and still ponders over these questions, and answer them sometimes very similarly, and sometimes very differently. This gave me so much perspective in regards to my own set of beliefs and made me feel like I belong to an entire world that asks the very basic questions, over and over again.If you are interested in myth, and are not afraid to open your mind to different points of view, do yourself a favor and sit down to watch this charming, sweet and admirable man talking about the most profound and fundamental topics ever discussed in such perfect balance between seriousness and humor.",5,Perspective is bliss,1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,1217,"['bought', 'item', 'reading', 'book', 'simply', 'wanted', 'hear', 'see', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'quote', 'pearls', 'wisdom', 'feel', 'purchase', 'really', 'enhanced', 'experience', 'book.Moyers', 'wonderful', 'narration', 'directs', 'Campbell', 'disclose', 'not', 'only', 'extraordinary', 'wealth', 'depth', 'knowledge', 'possessed', 'also', 'summarize', 'really', 'important', 'stuff', 'how', 'Campbell', 'view', 'should', 'view', 'life', 'How', 'should', 'view', 'myth', 'What', 'sort', 'approach', 'should', 'take', 'towards', 'religion', 'Faith', 'think', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'was', 'taught', 'here', 'was', 'whole', 'world', 'pondered', 'still', 'ponders', 'questions', 'answer', 'sometimes', 'very', 'similarly', 'sometimes', 'very', 'differently', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'perspective', 'regards', 'own', 'set', 'beliefs', 'made', 'feel', 'belong', 'entire', 'world', 'very', 'basic', 'questions', 'again.If', 'are', 'interested', 'myth', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'open', 'mind', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'do', 'favor', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'charming', 'sweet', 'admirable', 'man', 'talking', 'most', 'profound', 'fundamental', 'topics', 'ever', 'discussed', 'such', 'perfect', 'balance', 'seriousness', 'humor']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS
378124,A5ZUZ49YRDPCV,6303503381,Rachel Garret,"[7, 7]","1988: Joseph Campbell died in 1987. Two years earlier, then novice journalist Bill Moyers interviewed him for six hours, covering every subject imaginable. Joseph Campbell's philosophy paved the way for New Age thought today. His motto ""Follow your bliss"" became an anthem for individuality. He was a professor of mythology and religion, highly esteemed and intellectual, with a keen perception on human nature and the origins of many of the things that have become part of our consciousness as a human society.This DVD features those six hours into two discs, plus the bonus footage of the interview with Star Wars creator, George Lucas, who was directly inspired and influenced by Joseph Campbell's teachings. From your DVD system will come a wealth of information, a bright new way to look at the world. Mythology in our society may become extinct, if not for new modern myths or variations of an old myth. Joseph Campbell covers a hero/heroine journey (clearly representing you or the self) in a path of discovery and exploration in the journey of your life in ""The Hero's Adventure"", recalling the great heroes of myth- the Norse Siegfried and his defeat of Falfner, King Arthur, Luke Skywalker and religious figures such as the Buddha and Jesus Christ- who overcame personal weaknesses and contributed to humanity a lasting legacy.In ""The Message Of The Myth"", the observations on human life and nature are pointed out from several myths, and there is a lot Campbell draws from-  Native Americans, Japanese culture, the Mayas, the Vikings, the Africans and extractions from the Christian Bible. The ""First Storytellers"" deals with the primitive human society, cave-dwellers and hunters and gatherers, who told stories and painted images of their world through cave paintings. ""Sacrifice and Bliss"" deals with the higher level of spirituality, the chakras, the goal to which every hero/heroine aspires- sacrifice of the self to attain a bliss. Humanity benefits from such individuals.My favorite sections are ""Love and the Goddess"" and ""Masks Of Eternity"". In ""Love and the Goddess"" Campbell explains to Moyers that love and our search for true, lasting monogamous love was fueled by the Christian-influenced troubadours and medieval knights who followed the code of chivalry. He makes reference to the Holy Grail and sounds a lot like New Age writer/historian Laurence Gardner who wrote ""Bloodline Of The Holy Grail""- the grail, a feminine symbol, becomes a code to which humans aspire, especially in communion with another partner for romantic love for the benefit of others. ""The Goddess"" is the most beautiful part of the entire series, nostalgically recalling a time when male sex did not dominate the world, but the mother figure. Egyptians and ancient Mesopotamians venerated the female, giver of life, and such respect was lost over time when patriarchal, male dominated society took over. This is still true today, although the Goddess has barely survived through such figures as the Virgin Mary. ""Masks Of Eternity"" centers around the various religions and the paths to that eternal that is time, neither being right or wrong, each a mask of the same life force of the cosmos- eternity.This DVD is a must get for fans of Joseph Campbell and for those who wish to seek a deeper level of understanding about myths and fairy tales, which have more to say than meets the eye.",5,A New Consciousness: The Campbell Legacy On DVD,1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,3386,"['1988', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'died', '1987', 'Two', 'years', 'earlier', 'then', 'novice', 'journalist', 'Bill', 'Moyers', 'interviewed', 'six', 'hours', 'covering', 'subject', 'imaginable', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'philosophy', 'paved', 'way', 'New', 'Age', 'thought', 'today', 'motto', 'bliss', 'became', 'anthem', 'individuality', 'was', 'professor', 'mythology', 'religion', 'highly', 'esteemed', 'intellectual', 'keen', 'perception', 'human', 'nature', 'origins', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'consciousness', 'human', 'society.This', 'DVD', 'features', 'six', 'hours', 'two', 'discs', 'bonus', 'footage', 'interview', 'Star', 'Wars', 'creator', 'George', 'Lucas', 'who', 'was', 'directly', 'inspired', 'influenced', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'teachings', 'DVD', 'system', 'will', 'come', 'wealth', 'information', 'bright', 'new', 'way', 'look', 'world', 'Mythology', 'society', 'may', 'become', 'extinct', 'not', 'new', 'modern', 'myths', 'variations', 'old', 'myth', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'hero/heroine', 'journey', 'clearly', 'representing', 'self', 'path', 'discovery', 'exploration', 'journey', 'life', 'Hero', 'Adventure', 'recalling', 'great', 'heroes', 'myth-', 'Norse', 'Siegfried', 'defeat', 'Falfner', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'religious', 'figures', 'such', 'Buddha', 'Jesus', 'Christ-', 'who', 'overcame', 'personal', 'weaknesses', 'contributed', 'humanity', 'lasting', 'legacy.In', 'Message', 'Myth', 'observations', 'human', 'life', 'nature', 'are', 'pointed', 'out', 'several', 'myths', 'lot', 'Campbell', 'from-', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Mayas', 'Vikings', 'Africans', 'extractions', 'Christian', 'Bible', 'First', 'Storytellers', 'deals', 'primitive', 'human', 'society', 'cave-dwellers', 'hunters', 'gatherers', 'who', 'told', 'stories', 'painted', 'images', 'world', 'cave', 'paintings', 'Sacrifice', 'Bliss', 'deals', 'higher', 'level', 'spirituality', 'chakras', 'goal', 'hero/heroine', 'aspires-', 'sacrifice', 'self', 'attain', 'bliss', 'Humanity', 'benefits', 'such', 'individuals.My', 'favorite', 'sections', 'are', 'Love', 'Goddess', 'Masks', 'Eternity', 'Love', 'Goddess', 'Campbell', 'Moyers', 'love', 'search', 'true', 'lasting', 'monogamous', 'love', 'was', 'fueled', 'Christian-influenced', 'troubadours', 'medieval', 'knights', 'who', 'followed', 'code', 'chivalry', 'reference', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'lot', 'New', 'Age', 'writer/historian', 'Laurence', 'Gardner', 'who', 'wrote', 'Bloodline', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'grail', 'feminine', 'symbol', 'code', 'humans', 'aspire', 'especially', 'communion', 'partner', 'romantic', 'love', 'benefit', 'others', 'Goddess', 'most', 'beautiful', 'part', 'entire', 'series', 'nostalgically', 'recalling', 'time', 'when', 'male', 'sex', 'did', 'not', 'dominate', 'world', 'mother', 'figure', 'Egyptians', 'ancient', 'Mesopotamians', 'venerated', 'female', 'giver', 'life', 'such', 'respect', 'was', 'lost', 'over', 'time', 'when', 'patriarchal', 'male', 'dominated', 'society', 'took', 'over', 'still', 'true', 'today', 'Goddess', 'barely', 'survived', 'such', 'figures', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'Masks', 'Eternity', 'centers', 'various', 'religions', 'paths', 'eternal', 'time', 'being', 'right', 'wrong', 'mask', 'same', 'life', 'force', 'cosmos-', 'eternity.This', 'DVD', 'must', 'get', 'fans', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'who', 'wish', 'seek', 'deeper', 'level', 'understanding', 'myths', 'fairy', 'tales', 'have', 'more', 'say', 'eye']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS

As you view Bill Moyers trying to understand the absolute intellectual bliss Joseph Campbell is engaged in, you can't help but wonder how anyone could maintain the wealth of knowledge swirling in ecstasy in their mind. Joseph Campbell fits each piece of information into a richly woven spiritual tapestry.Suddenly life becomes much more simple when the universe is explained in a myth. We all see the similarities of the Hero's Adventure in books and movies, but why is this such a prevalent theme and are we all taking this journey? Joseph Campbell believes we are on our own spiritual journeys in which our consciousness is transformed through trials. If life seems like a struggle to you, then the first section about the Hero's Adventure will explain why we must slay our dragons by overcoming fear and other primal inclinations.Myths can be clues to spirituality and in all cultures, stories of creation and death encourage an understanding of our beginning and end. But are we really ever in any state other than Eternity itself? Joseph Campbell explains why good and evil are temporal apparitions and explores living life as a poem.During the taping of these interviews, Joseph Campbell had just purchased a computer and has some interesting observations about his interactions.In this six-part, six-hour interview style journey, you will learn about the yin/yang symbol, why people sacrifice their ego in marriage, why love is the perfect kindness and how libido can be an impulse to life itself.Other topics of interest: Star Wars, The Holy Grail, Romantic Love, Nirvana, Inner Mythology, the Virgin Birth, Agricultural Societies and the Goddess, Biblical Complexities, Spiritual Rebirth, Rituals as enactments of myths, the Soul as a Circle, Archetypes, Insight into the Human Psyche, Deep Mystery, Chakras, Mysteries of Creation, Compassion, James Joyce and Epiphanies, Monsters and Dragons, Poetry, Heaven and explanations of Brahma.If you have any interest in World Religions, this will take you to new levels in your understanding of universal desires, our search for a relationship with God and this may even help you understand your relationship with your life partner. Essential viewing for anyone interested in Myths, Buddhism or Christianity.When you think that this was recorded two years before Joseph Campbell's death, you cannot help but be amazed at the fluidity of his mind and the way in which he weaves concepts into eternal verbal bliss. He not only explains spiritual concepts, he takes you through amazing myths from Japanese, Native American, Egyptian and Mayan cultures. While he speaks, they present beautiful artwork illustrating the stories. He explains the difference between Amore, Eros and Agape and then explains how we can reach Nirvana by reaching a psychological place where we are unattached to desire and fear.At times Moyers seems to play with words as well as Joseph Campbell, but then at other times he seems to be asking for more information so the viewer can enjoy the depth of knowledge only an extremely perceptive interviewer could extract. At times he reads myths from one culture and Joseph reads them from another culture. The similarities are astonishing.The Hero's AdventureThe Message of the MythThe First StorytellersSacrifice and BlissLove and the GoddessMasks of EternityBonus Features: An Art Gallery and Selections from the video Sukhavati. Joseph Campbell narrates beautiful nature scenes. I found my six hour experience to be intellectually exhilarating. Half the fun of life is finding all the puzzle pieces needed to explain your very existence. This DVD set takes you beyond a basic understanding of mythology, it literally presents a pathway you could follow to spiritual bliss. I watched both DVDs in one day and was completely captivated by this intellectual tapestry.~The Rebecca Review",5,An Intellectual Tapestry,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,3951,"['Follow', 'Bliss', '~Joseph', 'Campbell', '1904-1987', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'mind', 'fascinating', 'view', 'Bill', 'Moyers', 'trying', 'understand', 'absolute', 'intellectual', 'bliss', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'engaged', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'maintain', 'wealth', 'knowledge', 'swirling', 'ecstasy', 'mind', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'piece', 'information', 'richly', 'woven', 'spiritual', 'tapestry.Suddenly', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'when', 'universe', 'explained', 'myth', 'see', 'similarities', 'Hero', 'Adventure', 'books', 'movies', 'why', 'such', 'prevalent', 'theme', 'are', 'taking', 'journey', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'are', 'own', 'spiritual', 'journeys', 'consciousness', 'transformed', 'trials', 'life', 'struggle', 'then', 'first', 'section', 'Hero', 'Adventure', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'must', 'slay', 'dragons', 'overcoming', 'fear', 'other', 'primal', 'inclinations.Myths', 'can', 'be', 'clues', 'spirituality', 'cultures', 'stories', 'creation', 'death', 'encourage', 'understanding', 'beginning', 'end', 'are', 'really', 'ever', 'state', 'other', 'Eternity', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'why', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'temporal', 'apparitions', 'living', 'life', 'poem.During', 'taping', 'interviews', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'had', 'just', 'purchased', 'computer', 'interesting', 'observations', 'interactions.In', 'six-part', 'six-hour', 'interview', 'style', 'journey', 'will', 'learn', 'yin/yang', 'symbol', 'why', 'people', 'sacrifice', 'ego', 'marriage', 'why', 'love', 'perfect', 'kindness', 'how', 'libido', 'can', 'be', 'impulse', 'life', 'topics', 'interest', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Romantic', 'Love', 'Nirvana', 'Inner', 'Mythology', 'Virgin', 'Birth', 'Agricultural', 'Societies', 'Goddess', 'Biblical', 'Complexities', 'Spiritual', 'Rebirth', 'Rituals', 'enactments', 'myths', 'Soul', 'Circle', 'Archetypes', 'Insight', 'Human', 'Psyche', 'Deep', 'Mystery', 'Chakras', 'Mysteries', 'Creation', 'Compassion', 'James', 'Joyce', 'Epiphanies', 'Monsters', 'Dragons', 'Poetry', 'Heaven', 'explanations', 'Brahma.If', 'have', 'interest', 'World', 'Religions', 'will', 'take', 'new', 'levels', 'understanding', 'universal', 'desires', 'search', 'relationship', 'God', 'may', 'even', 'help', 'understand', 'relationship', 'life', 'partner', 'Essential', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Myths', 'Buddhism', 'Christianity.When', 'think', 'was', 'recorded', 'two', 'years', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'amazed', 'fluidity', 'mind', 'way', 'concepts', 'eternal', 'verbal', 'bliss', 'not', 'only', 'spiritual', 'concepts', 'amazing', 'myths', 'Japanese', 'Native', 'American', 'Egyptian', 'Mayan', 'cultures', 'present', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'illustrating', 'stories', 'difference', 'Amore', 'Eros', 'Agape', 'then', 'how', 'can', 'reach', 'Nirvana', 'reaching', 'psychological', 'place', 'where', 'are', 'unattached', 'desire', 'fear.At', 'times', 'Moyers', 'play', 'words', 'as', 'well', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'then', 'other', 'times', 'be', 'asking', 'more', 'information', 'viewer', 'can', 'enjoy', 'depth', 'knowledge', 'only', 'extremely', 'perceptive', 'interviewer', 'could', 'extract', 'times', 'myths', 'one', 'culture', 'Joseph', 'reads', 'culture', 'similarities', 'are', 'astonishing.The', 'Hero', 'AdventureThe', 'Message', 'MythThe', 'First', 'StorytellersSacrifice', 'BlissLove', 'GoddessMasks', 'EternityBonus', 'Features', 'Art', 'Gallery', 'Selections', 'video', 'Sukhavati', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'beautiful', 'nature', 'scenes', 'found', 'six', 'hour', 'experience', 'be', 'intellectually', 'exhilarating', 'fun', 'life', 'finding', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'needed', 'explain', 'very', 'existence', 'DVD', 'set', 'basic', 'understanding', 'mythology', 'literally', 'pathway', 'could', 'follow', 'spiritual', 'bliss', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'completely', 'captivated', 'intellectual', 'tapestry.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS
378126,AFYLH06U69HKY,6303503381,"R. G. Villalobos ""Luminarrative""","[1, 1]","Joseph Campbell was a teacher of the great spiritual truths from all of the world's religions.  Campbell shows us the difference between connotation and denotation and invites us to read the mythology of the world as a field of reference that refers directly to the transcendent.  Mythology is a complicated language built on metaphors that can stump the ill-advised.  In this series of interviews we learn that the organs of the body are in conflict with one another and the conflict is externalized by the creative power of our mythic imagination.  The interviews are sprinkled with clips of fascinating footage from cultures around the world as well as works of art and brief illustrated stories set to music.Bill Moyers asks Campbell questions in a sometimes rigid and stilted voice but his heart is in the right place and he is certainly barking up the right tree.  Together they explore difficult questions about the state of the world and the continuing relevance of mythology in rapidly changing times.  Campbell as a teacher is gentle and inspires us to move forward along the course of our own lives armed with the tools of perception, wisdom and reflection.  Along the way there are warnings about the dangers of rigid adherence to systems that threaten to overpower our own humanity.  There are also invitations to see what is beautiful.  Man has struggled over the ages to come to terms with a world that is at once both nurturing and threatening.  In this modern world we wait for men like Joseph Campbell to come along and offer us the historical perspective and mental architecture that will help us build a healthy and functioning world view.  We are challenged to do nothing less than bring forth the full potential of our beings for our own benefit and for the benefit of those around us.

At first I dismissed it, but over the years I have come to believe its truth.  Above all else, we seek meaning and definition to our existence.  Stories -- and I include movies, books and songs -- give us that validation of universally shared experiences, fears and desires.  It's the picture on the ragged tapestry of our lives that we discern when we step back far enough to see the pattern of our collective stories.What makes this an exceptional show is Campbell has no agenda and nothing to sell.  He's just sharing a fundamental truth about our collective human experience.  Since our lives are filled with lies and propaganda, from politics, religion and advertisers, here is a welcome opportunity to detox.The six episodes:  ""The Hero's Adventure"" in which the mythical, heroic life is linked with the stages of our own mortal lives; ""The Message of the Myth"" is about the failure of ancient Creation stories to satisfy our modern need for scientific proof of origins; ""The First Storytellers"" emphasizes the need for ritual, the role of shaman in rites of passage and death as rebirth; ""Sacrifice and Bliss"" reveals how our contemporary needs require new concepts of the mythic modes of sacrifice; ""Love and the Goddess"" shows romance to be relatively new but eroticizing the female is old; ""Masks of Eternity"" grasps the big questions of God and spirituality as expressed by several world religions.Take again this exhilarating journey into mind, meaning and myth as expressed by a truly extraordinary man and brilliant storyteller.  Hosted by TV journalist Bill Moyers, this great show was originally seen as a highly-regarded PBS series.Bonus features include:  Never before released conversations with Campbell; selections from Moyers' interview with George Lucas; a 12 page viewer's guide; excerpts from the film SUKHAVATI and more.

378129,A2P98KLVOIWKI,6303503381,Stephen M. Kopian,"[9, 21]","In high school I was turned on to Joseph Campbell by George Lucas's remarks about how he used The Hero With a Thousand Faces while working on the original Star Wars stories. Reading that book I found it was a rush to see how so many patterns were repeated in myths.  It then sent me off reading the various myths and stories of various cultures and I largely left Campbell behind because the source material was better.When PBS ran the series the Power of Myth a few years later I once again dove back into the world of Joseph Campbell only this time I was much less enamored. The trouble was that Campbell was picking and choosing the pieces of myths to show the universal nature of the points he wanted to get across, leaving out the parts of the story that kind of worked against his hypothesis. If a similar story didn't follow his pattern he left it out. I completely understand why he did that and I don't really mind except that he rallies too much a case for across the board universality when it really isn't there.Campbell, for a brief time, became a media darling and even in colleges his take on myths and legends became the way to go. What's frustrating is that no one was really going back and reading the myths and legends he was talking about, or more importantly not talking about. If you watch the series with any critical eye you see how he tends to choose some belief systems over others.Don't get me wrong its a very good series, but you can't just let the series be the be all and end all of your quest to know the subject. I had several college professors who handed out copies of various episodes and said this was what we had to know and that was it. It was a lazy thing to do and something that was very one sided (and it stifled what was suppose to be a discussion of religion). You have to start here and go on from it, this series doesn't have all of the answers, it only really starts asking some of the questions. If you make the effort to really go beyond the programs and look into the myths and legends he talks about and those he doesn't, I think you'll find yourself getting a better understanding of the world.I've rated the series two stars because even though it's a good thing to get the mind going its not the be all and end all. As I've said its Campbell's view and not really the way all myths are, all you have to do is actually start reading the stories to see that.",2,If you use it as a launching point for a discussion it's great but its not the be all and end all.,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2411,"['high', 'school', 'was', 'turned', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'George', 'Lucas', 'remarks', 'how', 'used', 'Hero', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'working', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'stories', 'Reading', 'book', 'found', 'was', 'rush', 'see', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'patterns', 'were', 'repeated', 'myths', 'then', 'sent', 'off', 'reading', 'various', 'myths', 'stories', 'various', 'cultures', 'largely', 'left', 'Campbell', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'better.When', 'PBS', 'ran', 'series', 'Power', 'Myth', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'once', 'again', 'dove', 'back', 'world', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'only', 'time', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'enamored', 'trouble', 'was', 'Campbell', 'was', 'picking', 'choosing', 'pieces', 'myths', 'show', 'universal', 'nature', 'points', 'wanted', 'get', 'leaving', 'out', 'parts', 'story', 'kind', 'worked', 'hypothesis', 'similar', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'pattern', 'left', 'out', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'too', 'much', 'case', 'board', 'universality', 'when', 'really', ""n't"", 'there.Campbell', 'brief', 'time', 'became', 'media', 'darling', 'even', 'colleges', 'take', 'myths', 'legends', 'became', 'way', 'go', 'What', 'frustrating', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'back', 'reading', 'myths', 'was', 'talking', 'more', 'importantly', 'not', 'talking', 'watch', 'series', 'critical', 'eye', 'see', 'how', 'choose', 'belief', 'systems', 'others.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'let', 'series', 'be', 'be', 'end', 'quest', 'know', 'subject', 'had', 'several', 'college', 'professors', 'who', 'handed', 'out', 'copies', 'various', 'episodes', 'said', 'was', 'what', 'had', 'know', 'was', 'was', 'lazy', 'thing', 'do', 'something', 'was', 'very', 'one', 'sided', 'stifled', 'what', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'discussion', 'religion', 'have', 'start', 'here', 'go', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'only', 'really', 'asking', 'questions', 'make', 'effort', 'really', 'go', 'programs', 'look', 'myths', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'getting', 'better', 'understanding', 'world.I', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'series', 'two', 'stars', 'even', 'good', 'thing', 'get', 'mind', 'going', 'not', 'be', 'end', ""'ve"", 'said', 'Campbell', 'view', 'not', 'really', 'way', 'myths', 'are', 'have', 'do', 'actually', 'start', 'reading', 'stories', 'see']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS

Burrows,"[1, 1]","I am sorry to see that, of this writing, this almost legendary (well it is legendary in terms of the subject, but in terms of the quality too) 5 1/2 hour interview is only available as an absurdly overpriced used item.  I am sure it will be available again.  Perhaps Criterion or someone will touch up the video and add some previously unreleased footage and re-release it.  The version I have is marred by hotspots, a lack of sharpness, and poor color, but that in no way held this viewer back from drinking in every fascinating minute.  Other reviewers have made a lot of useful comments about the content, so I won't harp on that subject.  I will say that, if you have any serious interest in the narrative arts, or the development of human thought, or mythology, or attempts by the human race to represent and comprehend life in any way, then you will find this video to be an invaluable viewing experience.  Of course, a serious perusal of Campbell's writings, some of which were illustrated, like this video was (with short clips and still images), would give you more information.  Campbell had a Jungian approach to the study of world mythology, and he had the gift of communicating this subject in a way that is engaging but not watered down.  One of the pleasures of this masterpiece is watching the appreciative back and forth between a gifted interviewer, Bill Moyers (who was often lobbing softballs to his subject, but so what), and the charismatic and down-to-earth scholar, Professor Campbell.

He is a master teacher and is utterly engaging. Everything he talks about is immediately at hand for him and he  has obviously immersed himself in religion and myth, their similarities and  the symbolism behind them.The one weakness from this video is the  interviewer Bill Moyers who often times is out of his depth and asking dumb  questions when Campbell has just explained it to him. Despite this, Moyers  was obviously prepared and pulls all the right things out of Campbell who  tells the greatest stories, since he has the greatest material to pull  from.Campbell doesn't pick one mythology more than any other, he wanders  though Native North American, East Indian, Christian and Buddism and is  equally at ease with any and many more. He is such a joy to listen to and  gives so much in this video series.In total, there are 6 videos of about  1.5 hours each.

It doesn't matter what religion or denomination you are - the truths expressed by Professor Campbell are universal and he proves it.This six part series covers and explains the history and focus of comparative mythology and religion sometimes specificly, sometimes broadly - always fascinatingly.This is not some stale piece of opinion but a lively and rich conversation between two seekers of Truth and beauty in life. It will appeal to everyone. While some background in comparative religion would be helpful it is not necessary. Let this be your starting point as it was for me. Moyers does an admirable job in asking most of the right questions, when he hasn't touched on a point Campbell steers the discussion to it.It's a pleasure to know that this is back in print again; the world would be a better and more enlightened place if everyone saw it. I only hope this new Athena 2010 edition will maintain the same high quality picture and sound as the Mystic Fire OOP version, though it seems the bonus interview with George Lucas will not be included. The older version is 360 minutes and this new one is 342.Still, fans of Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Arthurian legends and the Chronicles of Narnia should especially take note - Professor Campbell was a walking encyclopedia of the knowledge of heroic legends and after viewing this series you will agree that few men in our time have had as firm a grasp on what life is about than he and have expressed themselves with such generous humanity and clarity.PS - while not necessary, I would recommend the Christopher Isherwood translation of the ""Bhagavad Gita"" with the introduction by Aldous ""Brave New World"" Huxley (see my review) as a philosophical companion to this series. Within a very few pages Huxley describes what religion is for and how it's traditional role has been subverted my modernity. His sentiments dovetail perfectly with those of Professor Campbell and enhance the reader/viewers understanding of both works.The ""Gita"" itself, while Hindu, has a tremendous quantity and quality of objective and universal Truth to offer - a ""self-help"" book like no other, but I insist on this particular translation as others can be misleading for reasons that this copy will address in it's foreword.Enjoy!",5,Mystic Fire/Winstar copy - content,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2449,"['conversation', 'Professor', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'Bill', 'Moyers', 'most', 'concise', 'clear', 'explanation', 'what', 'religion', 'how', 'achieved', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'religion', 'denomination', 'are', 'truths', 'expressed', 'Professor', 'Campbell', 'are', 'universal', 'it.This', 'six', 'part', 'series', 'history', 'focus', 'comparative', 'mythology', 'religion', 'sometimes', 'specificly', 'sometimes', 'broadly', 'always', 'fascinatingly.This', 'not', 'stale', 'piece', 'opinion', 'lively', 'rich', 'conversation', 'two', 'seekers', 'Truth', 'beauty', 'life', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'background', 'comparative', 'religion', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'not', 'necessary', 'Let', 'be', 'starting', 'point', 'was', 'Moyers', 'admirable', 'job', 'asking', 'most', 'right', 'questions', 'when', ""n't"", 'touched', 'point', 'Campbell', 'discussion', 'it.It', 'pleasure', 'know', 'back', 'print', 'again', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'enlightened', 'place', 'everyone', 'saw', 'only', 'hope', 'new', 'Athena', '2010', 'edition', 'will', 'maintain', 'same', 'high', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'Mystic', 'Fire', 'OOP', 'version', 'bonus', 'interview', 'George', 'Lucas', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'included', 'older', 'version', '360', 'minutes', 'new', 'one', '342.Still', 'fans', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'should', 'especially', 'take', 'note', 'Professor', 'Campbell', 'was', 'walking', 'encyclopedia', 'knowledge', 'heroic', 'legends', 'viewing', 'series', 'will', 'agree', 'few', 'men', 'time', 'have', 'had', 'firm', 'grasp', 'what', 'life', 'about', 'have', 'expressed', 'such', 'generous', 'humanity', 'clarity.PS', 'not', 'necessary', 'would', 'recommend', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', 'translation', 'Bhagavad', 'Gita', 'introduction', 'Aldous', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'Huxley', 'see', 'review', 'philosophical', 'companion', 'series', 'very', 'few', 'pages', 'Huxley', 'what', 'religion', 'how', 'traditional', 'role', 'been', 'subverted', 'modernity', 'sentiments', 'dovetail', 'perfectly', 'Professor', 'Campbell', 'enhance', 'reader/viewers', 'understanding', 'works.The', 'Gita', 'Hindu', 'tremendous', 'quantity', 'quality', 'objective', 'universal', 'Truth', 'offer', 'self-help', 'book', 'other', 'insist', 'particular', 'translation', 'others', 'can', 'be', 'misleading', 'reasons', 'copy', 'will', 'address', 'foreword.Enjoy']",Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers Six Pack  VHS
