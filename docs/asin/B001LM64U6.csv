With the lack of quality programming nowdays this has become a classic. Chris Wiggins reminds me so much of Donald Pleasence...either of those two could have played Jack Marshack, and either could have played Dr. Loomis (Halloween). I might be getting off-track here, but let me say that I consider Louise Robey to be quite a beautiful woman. I cannot imagine any other female taking her place in this program. The director may have gone a bit overboard with some of Robey's outfits in the first season, but that didn't detract from her beauty; and in the second season the outfits were all very tasteful. I won't list favorite episodes since I consider all of them to be great and I don't want to detract from the entire package. I have bought the first two seasons already and I hope the third season is also released since the only other way of getting it is to buy the whole set from the bootleggers.

1214814,A39C66NHY99BR1,B001LM64U6,Gary M. Miller,"[2, 3]","""Friday the 13th: The Series"" is one of my favorite shows of all time; let's get that out of the way first. I rated the first season's DVD release low because of poor video quality, the absence of the 'saga sell' at episode's start, and the threadbare extras. So how did this release, just months after the previous one, fare?The good news is that the video quality is better than in the previous set. (The last set looks better when you watch it on Chiller than on the DVDs!) The bad news is that the 'saga sell' (""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil, to sell cursed antiques..."") is still nowhere in sight, and this set has even *fewer* extras than the previous one.On the plus side, the episodes here are better than in the last set, and I'm happy to say the episode ""Mesmer's Bauble"" is intact, music and all. It was feared to be missing from this set because of guest star Vanity's condemnation of her appearance (leading to the show's not having aired in the U.S. for some time).I still think Paramount can get it right with the third and final set, whenever it appears. I already sent my letter to their DVD division voicing my displeasure for this and the previous set. Surely we can hope for the saga sell to be restored on the intact, two-hour ""The Prophecies"" (season 3's premiere episode)?Rating: Three stars (average).~G.",3,"On the right track but no, still not quite right",1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,1340,"['Friday', '13th', 'Series', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'time', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'first', 'rated', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'release', 'low', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'absence', ""'saga"", 'sell', 'episode', 'start', 'threadbare', 'extras', 'how', 'did', 'release', 'just', 'months', 'previous', 'one', 'fare', 'good', 'news', 'video', 'quality', 'better', 'previous', 'set', 'last', 'set', 'looks', 'better', 'when', 'watch', 'Chiller', 'DVDs', 'bad', 'news', ""'saga"", 'sell', 'Lewis', 'Vendredi', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'sell', 'cursed', 'antiques', 'still', 'nowhere', 'sight', 'set', 'even', '*fewer*', 'extras', 'previous', 'plus', 'side', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'better', 'last', 'set', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'episode', 'Mesmer', 'Bauble', 'intact', 'music', 'was', 'feared', 'be', 'missing', 'set', 'guest', 'star', 'Vanity', 'condemnation', 'appearance', 'leading', 'show', 'not', 'having', 'aired', 'U.S.', 'time', '.I', 'still', 'think', 'Paramount', 'can', 'get', 'right', 'third', 'final', 'set', 'whenever', 'already', 'sent', 'letter', 'DVD', 'division', 'voicing', 'displeasure', 'previous', 'set', 'Surely', 'can', 'hope', 'saga', 'sell', 'be', 'restored', 'intact', 'two-hour', 'Prophecies', 'season', '3', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Rating', 'Three', 'stars', 'average', '.~G']",Friday the 13th the Series: Season 2

Ran tests on the picture quality starting with a standard DVD player/recorder and a blu-ray player.  On my 42 inch plasma, the picture looked fine on both players with a slight improvement with the blu-ray upscaling.  The opening title was nice and sharp (based on the text) but right toward the end the smoke that appeared rendered the picture somewhat soft.  This series uses an over-abundance of smoke/haze/fog which makes the picture grainy.  In fact, the antique shop is always smoky in the background.  Sharpening this haze won't improve the picture.  Also tested the picture quality with a standard DVD player connected to a late-80's 31 inch tube TV by an old video cable from the 80's.  Watching a late 80's program on a late 80's TV was a nice nostalgia trip but the picture was grainy esp. in the hazy parts.
