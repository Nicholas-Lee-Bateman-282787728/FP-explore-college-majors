Alexander ""once met........................""","[3, 5]","A wonderful performance by All the Players taking part in this chunk of history, as astonishing as; ""The Prisoner of Shark Island."" To quote from James Swanson's informative and meticulously researched book 'Manhunt' - Asia Booth's (John Wilkes Booth's sister) loving memory to her brother closes with a graveside elegy: ""But, granting that he died in vain, yet gave his all on earth, youth, beauty, manhood, a great human love, the certainty of excellence in his profession,a powerful brain, the strength of an athlete, health and great wealth, for 'his cause.' This man was noble in life, he periled his immortal soul, and he was brave in death. Already his hidden remains are given Christian burial, and strangers have piled his grave with flowers.""

802640,A3O2ZH7MA7Q0GE,B0001ENX4A,James M. Russell,"[2, 2]","In the 1970's and 1980, the hotel I worked for had 12 movie crews, staying there. Some great movie stars, and a few great actors. ""The Ordeal of Dr. Mudd"", was a very good movie, and I especially love the scenes I saw shot. Guy Del Russo, was the makeup artist on the film, and a good friend of mine, who died shortly after filming. That makes this movie very special. If you want to know how much this movie means to me. I paid a private individual $99.00, for my copy of the DVD. I say, it was a bargain. This movie, in my opinion, was one of the best performances, by Dennis Weaver, a great actor, who is missed. Also the acting in the best tradition, were Richard Dysart, and Susan Sullivan. I say, get this movie, and see the injustice, this government, imposed on one very great man, played by a great man.

Dennis Weaver as Dr. Mudd and Susan Sullivan as his wife are virtually flawless in their respective roles. I've only had it for 2 months and have watched it twice; once myself and again when friends came over a week later and wanted to see it and THEY loved it so much that they ordered a copy.
