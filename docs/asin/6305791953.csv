A lot of comic twists and turns in this one.  My nine year-old son says it was a good chase movie!  There were some good chases towards the end of the film. Pretty good acting and lots of belly laughs.,4,Good,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,294,"['fun', 'family', 'movie', 'Imagine', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'date', 'president', 'daughter', 'lot', 'comic', 'twists', 'one', 'nine', 'year-old', 'son', 'was', 'good', 'chase', 'movie', 'were', 'good', 'chases', 'end', 'film', 'Pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'lots', 'belly', 'laughs']",My Date With the President's Daughter VHS

Schoth,"[3, 5]","Disney - the genius of family entertainment, guaranteed to please the entire family!Will Friedle is a wonderful actor, that I've enjoyed watching in Boy Meets World, and am pleased to find him in several movies now.  My daughters were actually a little young for this one (ages 4 and 5), but they liked the action scenes that involving the car theft and the pool hall scenes.  However, I loved this movie and I think in a couple more years, they will find it more interesting to sit through.  So this one is better for children about 8 years and up.The scene where Will is looking for his date's home... then realizes it's the White House... well, that's just hilarious!
