Silas (William V. Mong) is not that dumb and has sent for the police.He still goes forward with the reading of his will, surrounded by relatives, associates, and the police. They all give him dirty looks and if looks could kill... Just before he signs the will Silas keels over. Everyone closes in with genuine concern that he is still alive.Detective-Sergeant Mitchell (Regis Toomey) is assigned the case. And who should stick her nose in but a news paper gal 'Nosey' Toodles (June Clyde). She is determined to be the first to discover who dispatched Silas.If you ask me there seems to be something going on between the two.One of my favorite scenes is where the servant Jeff (Fred 'Snowflake' Toones) is confronted by a phantom waving its arms.Another plus is that all the actors are displayed with their real names, instead of just a bunch of disembodies names scrolling on the screen.They also hurried the story or this could have been an excellent case.",4,Silas Wayne is about to read his will,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1087,"['However', 'secretary', 'anticipated', 'reading', 'already', 'switched', 'soon', 'be', 'inherited', 'diamond', 'paste', 'substitute', 'Silas', 'William', 'V.', 'Mong', 'not', 'dumb', 'sent', 'police.He', 'still', 'forward', 'reading', 'will', 'surrounded', 'relatives', 'associates', 'police', 'give', 'dirty', 'looks', 'looks', 'could', 'kill', 'Just', 'signs', 'will', 'Silas', 'keels', 'Everyone', 'genuine', 'concern', 'still', 'alive.Detective-Sergeant', 'Mitchell', 'Regis', 'Toomey', 'assigned', 'case', 'who', 'should', 'stick', 'nose', 'news', 'paper', 'gal', ""'Nosey"", 'Toodles', 'June', 'Clyde', 'determined', 'be', 'first', 'discover', 'who', 'dispatched', 'Silas.If', 'ask', 'there', 'be', 'something', 'going', 'two.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'where', 'servant', 'Jeff', 'Fred', ""'Snowflake"", 'Toones', 'confronted', 'phantom', 'waving', 'arms.Another', 'actors', 'are', 'displayed', 'real', 'names', 'instead', 'just', 'bunch', 'disembodies', 'names', 'scrolling', 'screen.They', 'also', 'hurried', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'case']",N/A

Some day you'll find I'm always right."" -- Toodles to MitchellMonogram's ""B"" studio, one of the infamous Poverty Row lots, was well known for cranking out forgettable mystery programers. Everything clicked once in a while, however, and fun little time killers such as this one hit movie houses to entertain audiences before the main attraction hit the screen. Just enough stock footage, a fine cast, and a pretty fun story make this one an easy to take distraction for a weekend or late at night when you're up and there's nothing to do.Old Silas Wayne, disliked by nearly everyone for good reason, is about to sign his will while all his relatives, gathered like vultures at feeding time, hoping for a few morsels, await their due. But it's a nasty will, and before he can sign it into law, he drops dead of murder! Detective Sergeant Mitchell (Regis Toomey) is called out to the mansion to investigate the hottest story in town. ""Nosy Toodles"" (June Clyde) of The Morning Journal isn't about to pass up a great story like the Wayne murder, and sneaks in to get the scoop. The two have one of those cop-reporter relationships which, of course, always leads to a fun ""B"" romance.There are some suspicious relatives, a cursed diamond, and a second murder before a very fun ending where Mitchell not only outs the killer, but discovers he's making some headway with his sweetie after all. The pacing of director Phil Whitman is deliberate, but you become involved after a bit and just go with it. Some pretty good atmosphere is provided by flashlights in the dark and a hooded figure which has the butler, Jeff (Snowflake), heading back to Alabama. Nadine Dore is quite nice as Gloria Druden, the one nice relative, and could easily have been the lead. June Clyde and Regis Toomey have fun and make sort of a cute couple in this above average ""B"" from Monogram. Recommended with a bowl of popcorn on a rainy night.",5,"A Pleasant ""B"" Distraction",1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,1944,"['Can', 'help', ""'re"", 'blind', 'day', ""'ll"", 'find', ""'m"", 'always', 'right', 'MitchellMonogram', 'B', 'studio', 'one', 'infamous', 'Poverty', 'Row', 'lots', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'cranking', 'out', 'forgettable', 'mystery', 'programers', 'Everything', 'clicked', 'once', 'while', 'however', 'fun', 'little', 'time', 'killers', 'such', 'one', 'hit', 'movie', 'houses', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'main', 'attraction', 'hit', 'screen', 'Just', 'enough', 'stock', 'footage', 'fine', 'cast', 'pretty', 'fun', 'story', 'make', 'one', 'easy', 'take', 'distraction', 'weekend', 'late', 'night', 'when', ""'re"", 'up', 'nothing', 'do.Old', 'Silas', 'Wayne', 'disliked', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'good', 'reason', 'sign', 'will', 'while', 'relatives', 'gathered', 'vultures', 'feeding', 'time', 'hoping', 'few', 'morsels', 'await', 'due', 'nasty', 'will', 'can', 'sign', 'law', 'dead', 'murder', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Mitchell', 'Regis', 'Toomey', 'called', 'out', 'mansion', 'investigate', 'hottest', 'story', 'town', 'Nosy', 'Toodles', 'June', 'Clyde', 'Morning', 'Journal', ""n't"", 'about', 'pass', 'up', 'great', 'story', 'Wayne', 'murder', 'sneaks', 'get', 'scoop', 'two', 'have', 'one', 'cop-reporter', 'relationships', 'course', 'always', 'fun', 'B', 'romance.There', 'are', 'suspicious', 'relatives', 'cursed', 'diamond', 'second', 'murder', 'very', 'fun', 'ending', 'where', 'Mitchell', 'not', 'only', 'killer', 'making', 'headway', 'sweetie', 'pacing', 'director', 'Phil', 'Whitman', 'deliberate', 'become', 'involved', 'bit', 'just', 'go', 'pretty', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'provided', 'flashlights', 'dark', 'hooded', 'figure', 'butler', 'Jeff', 'Snowflake', 'heading', 'back', 'Alabama', 'Nadine', 'Dore', 'quite', 'nice', 'Gloria', 'Druden', 'one', 'nice', 'relative', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'lead', 'June', 'Clyde', 'Regis', 'Toomey', 'have', 'fun', 'make', 'sort', 'cute', 'couple', 'above', 'average', 'B', 'Monogram', 'Recommended', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'rainy', 'night']",N/A

Steigman ""Movie fan from silents to now""","[2, 2]","The DVD I have is from Alpha & it its the usual slightly hazy/ transfer (they don't remaster their movies)heavy on the Grey tones. The print is not too terribly bad..The movie is about a group of family/relatives who are all accused of killing the patriarch Mr Silas Wayne,who gets murdered when he is about to read his will to his family who dislike him. One of them hated him enough to kill him. Of interest this has Dwight Frye (Dracula) and Regis Toomey (he was in tons of movies)Regis is the detective to find out who killed Silas Wayne and why. The whole family wanted him dead. There are a few twists and turns,a nosy reporter. It isnt too bad,it is a harmless one hour movie that moves in a methodical pace -slow & no music. And there is a goofy phantom running around. Pretty good for its type. I thought it was better than other who done it movies from Alpha.Good to curl up & watch on a foggy or rainy day,or in the evening when you have an hour to kill :) 99% of the movie takes place inside the Silas house, and 1% just outside.

818766,A10RGJ0NVVGODV,B0001ZMXAE,Ron Wise,"[0, 1]","""Wayne Murder Case"" is a plodding, static Poverty Row melodrama. There has very little action and it has all the earmarks of a very dated stage play.Dwight Frye fans will be disappointed to find him looking very uncomfortable in a suit while he sits stiff-backed in the drawing room with almost no dialogue throughout the film. If you had hoped to see him in all his wild-eyed, fly-eating, Dracula's assistant glory, forget it. He's just one of a roomful of dull murder suspects.Regis Toomey plays the equally dull, and disinterested detective assigned to find the murderer of Old Man Wayne. We wonder midway through this very long 62 minute film if Wayne really died from that knife in his chest or was it boredom?The only bright spot in this dreary little film is blond, perky actress June Clyde who plays a wisecracking girl reporter named ""Nosey"" Toodles. Miss Toodles bounces through the old mansion looking for clues. Her clod of a boyfriend, detective Regis Toomey, chases her around the house... not to kiss her, but to make sure she doesn't solve the mystery before he does.To find out if Toomey catches the murderer and kisses Toodles, and if Toodles gets to call in her big scoop, and if this film ever fades to black, you'll just have to buy the DVD and see for yourself.",2,This movie is murder,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,1283,"['Wayne', 'Murder', 'Case', 'plodding', 'static', 'Poverty', 'Row', 'melodrama', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'earmarks', 'very', 'dated', 'stage', 'play.Dwight', 'Frye', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'find', 'looking', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'suit', 'stiff-backed', 'drawing', 'room', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'film', 'had', 'hoped', 'see', 'wild-eyed', 'fly-eating', 'Dracula', 'assistant', 'glory', 'forget', 'just', 'one', 'roomful', 'dull', 'murder', 'suspects.Regis', 'Toomey', 'equally', 'dull', 'disinterested', 'detective', 'assigned', 'find', 'murderer', 'Old', 'Man', 'Wayne', 'wonder', 'midway', 'very', 'long', '62', 'minute', 'film', 'Wayne', 'really', 'died', 'knife', 'chest', 'was', 'boredom', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'dreary', 'little', 'film', 'blond', 'perky', 'actress', 'June', 'Clyde', 'who', 'wisecracking', 'girl', 'reporter', 'named', 'Nosey', 'Toodles', 'Miss', 'Toodles', 'old', 'mansion', 'looking', 'clues', 'clod', 'boyfriend', 'detective', 'Regis', 'Toomey', 'house', 'not', 'kiss', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'solve', 'mystery', 'does.To', 'find', 'out', 'Toomey', 'murderer', 'kisses', 'Toodles', 'Toodles', 'call', 'big', 'scoop', 'film', 'ever', 'black', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'buy', 'DVD', 'see']",N/A
