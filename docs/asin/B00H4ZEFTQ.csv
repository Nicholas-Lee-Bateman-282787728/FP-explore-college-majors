Some of the most intelligent British women during WWII were brought to Bletchley as code breakers. They helped win the war. At that time it was a secret, hidden operation, and remained a national secret for decades afterward. This dramatic series reveaed some of the history and aftermath. In the early 1950s Bletchley gals have moved on to marriage and kids. However, the stellar code breaking abilities are yet keen in the minds of these women. That can't be forgotten so easily. And now, they operate independently, without protection of the British forces.The second season expanded to four episodes, one more than season 1. The story continued from one episode to a second. That pattern was repeated for a second lengthy two-part drama. The suspense never slowed, so expect no difference in series two. The women that found themselves caught between wartime and post-war normalcy were tough, smart, strong, and determined. Yes, it is a female focused series, but content is for all who enjoy strong thriller/suspense and a challenge to never being sure of the conclusion. Code breaking revolved around patterns, and a pattern could change in a heartbeat. So could lives. A realistic look at what it was probably like for the gals who worked at wartime Bletchley, followed by their struggle to blend into the subdued British lifestyle after the war.It's intense period suspense with costumes, sets, and props doing the appropriate 1950s era.

1683648,A3KBCYZ4VX0HN7,B00H4ZEFTQ,"J. lacy ""clean food cook""","[0, 0]","Like Season 1, The Bletchley Circle has the five main characters - all women who worked at Bletchley Park as code breakers during World War II trying to find contentment back in civilian life sans the importance and excitement of making such a vital contribution to winning the war against Hitler. Imagine all that these women did and how significant their lives must have seemed only to be relegated to being a &#34;housewife&#34; or teacher, or sales clerk afterwards? To make matters worse, they were obligated to sign and comply with The Official Secrets Act of 1939, which prevented these ladies from even telling their own husbands and/or family members what they did and how they contributed toward saving the world from a deranged human monster.The stories center around a mystery typically involving a murder or murders and the women using their extraordinary skills to detect patterns and garner clues that even professional police inspectors did not have the ability or insight to do.I can't say that I've seen a finer and more entertaining show - especially one so centered around true events (and I'm comparing this with shows such as Breaking Bad, Downton Abbey, Mad Men, Mr. Selfridge's, and Call The Midwives). The actors are superb, and the Directors, set styling and scenes are top notch.This time around there are 4 excellent episodes (instead of three in the 1st season) with two episodes focusing on two different stories - both equally compelling mysteries involving murders and featuring the fascinating way each woman brings her special skill to help solve the crime.We lose the considerable talents of Anna Maxwell Martin as Susan Gray in the fifth episode as she and her husband, Timothy (played by Mark Dexter) and their children relocate to Australia for his work. I imagine in real life that Susan just had too many other role opportunities to turn down in order to do the entire 4 episodes. But our loss is compensated by the introduction of another woman who worked at Bletchley with the women, Hattie Morahan as Alice Merren. Alice is actually embroiled in the 1st episode of this series as a suspect in a murder which we learn she did not commit, but she refuses to prove her innocence (except to the other women) as she is protecting someone dear to her.As I said in my review of Bletchley Circle Season 1, this show is intriguing and entertaining on so many levels since it's based on real historical events and it shows women characters in strong inspiring roles who are attractive FOR their characters and yet easy to relate to.Before this show, I've never taken time to write or petition for a show to be continued but I actually did that in hopes that some smart producer and distributor would be wise enough to produce a 3rd season. I'd love to see a third season as there is such a shortage of really, really good programming.One additional note of interest: Kate Middleton, a.k.a. Duchess of Cambridge, and wife of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge visited Bletchley Park in June in Buckinghamshire, where her paternal grandmother Valerie Glassborow was a &#34;Duty Officer&#34; during World War II.

What adds dimension to this show is portraying the position of women in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Women who contributed their intellectual talent at Bletchley Park during WWII were expected to revert to being housewives or clerks who were not respected by even their husbands.The show seems to blame the British Official Secrets Act that prohibit people who had secret clearance jobs during WWII, including the women who worked at Bletchley Park, to say where they worked during the war, even to their husbands and fathers. No doubt that Act did not help the important men in their lives to recognize the talent and effort of the women, to change their view of the women. That seemed to indicate that the men and a male-dominated society somehow knew during the war that the women were smart, and recruited them to help win the war, but somehow the women became dumb after the war.I know from history that this really happened so it's good of this show to point that out, peripherally.

1683662,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00H4ZEFTQ,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","Series 2 of ""The Bletchley Circle"" picks up in 1953 the story of four women who worked together at Bletchley Park HQ during World War II. Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin) is shaken by her last adventure and reluctant to get involved in any more crime-solving, her anxiety compounded by her inability to explain her fears and frustrations to husband Timothy (Mark Dexter). Flamboyant Millie (Rachel Stirling) is putting her linguistic talents to use as a German translator. Lucy (Sophie Rundle) is now a clerical support officer at Scotland Yard. Jean, researcher and a kind of den mother to the younger women, still works as a librarian. The series has a new production designer but retains its even, muted lighting and brown tones that enhance the ""period"" look. Guy Burt has written two mysteries in four hour-long episodes this season. The mysteries are better than the hackneyed deviant serial killer of Series 1, though the characters suffer a little. The episodes are:In ""Blood on Their Hands"", Jean is disturbed to learn that a woman who worked under her at Bletchley Park, Alice Merren (Hattie Morahan), has been convicted of the murder of another former colleague, biologist John Richards (Paul McGann). Jean visits Alice in prison and comes away suspicious that Alice hasn't told what she knows about Richards' death and is protecting someone by refusing to defend herself in court. Jean enlists Lucy and Millie's help in investigating the murder case, which leads them to the apartment of 17-year-old Lizzie Lancaster (Faye Marsay), where they find some classified documents that Lancaster claims never to have seen before. Meanwhile, Susan's husband has gotten a promotion that may entail a 2-year posting abroad. Jean needs her help, but Susan feels she cannot get involved in an investigation that may place her family in danger. This is an interesting mystery, though Susan's character seems strained and a bit distasteful.""Uncustomed Goods"" sees Alice Merren trying to find work in spite of her notoriety. Millie has lost her job and is selling black market perfumes and stockings to make ends meet. Business takes a scary turn, however, when Millie is abducted by Maltese gangsters and detained until her boss in the black market goods business, Jasper (Rob Jarvis), comes up with the money that he owes his supplier, a criminal matriarch named Marta (Brana Bajic). Millie is further disturbed to learn that this crime family is in the white slavery business, luring young women from behind the Iron Curtain to come to Great Britain with promises of jobs as chambermaids, then selling the women as sex slaves to various hoteliers. Millie feels it is her responsibility to ensure that the crime ring is busted and the women freed. Millie seems uncharacteristically emotional, and the ruse she carries out with Jean strains credibility. The mystery plays into the current British moral panic over ""trafficking"".",4,"Still Stylish.

Each of them very intelligent, great insight and able to see through any clue in minute detail. They had all worked at a secret installation, Bletchley Park, during World War 2. These mysteries take place in the early '50s after WWII, and this new season gives us some years after the first season ended.The Bletchley Circle shows us  the frustrations and issues women faced in their workplace with the sexism and limits placed on them. Their talent was based on how fast they could type and what they looked like in a tight skirt. They have become mothers, secretaries and librarians. And, in their off time they solve mysteries and often murders.This is a four-episode season, with two episodes related to each other.  Susan, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, remains traumatized after a close encounter in the first season with a murderer. She takes part in the first two episodes, and then leaves with her family for a foreign posting. We follow the women as they try to prove the innocence of a former colleague. Rachel Stirling plays Millie the most adventurous and beautiful of the group. She shines in the third and fourth episodes as the ladies try to solve the puzzle of strange codes and young girls for sale.I enjoyed this series,but at times it seems as if the writers are stretching.

1683671,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00H4ZEFTQ,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[43, 44]","During the Second World War, Bletchley Park was the headquarters of the UK's decryption organization, where various codes and cyphers were translated by a staff that was made up of 80% women. When the war came to a close they went back to ordinary life, keeping their activities during the war a secret even from their closest family members. They were extraordinary women, who not only saved lives with their diligence but were some of the world's first computer programmers.Although ""The Bletchley Circle"" (rather sadly) takes place well after the war has come to a close, the protagonists are all former-Bletchley members who use their puzzle-solving skills to ferret out answers to various mysteries. Inthe first seriesSusan Grey, a wife and mother, was feeling stifled by her current life-style and eager to recapture what she considered the glory years by catching a serial killer. Alongside her former comrades (outspoken Millie, quiet Lucy, no-nonsense Jean) they managed to hunt him down, though not without a significant psychological toll.As with the first series, the second begins with a brief prologue that takes place in the midst of the war before moving forward ten years. Another of their old colleges is in serious trouble - having been found guilty of murdering her former lover, Alice Merren now faces execution for his murder. Having gone to see her in prison, Jean is certain that she's not only innocent, but also hiding something - but what on earth would you keep secret when you're about to be hanged?This time it's Jean who rounds up the old crew, finding it easy enough to bring Lucy and Millie on board, but discovering that after her traumatic experience in series one, Susan wants nothing to do with the investigation, especially when she thinks it'll threaten her own family.Unlike the last series, which dealt with the fairly straightforward hunt for a serial killer, series two has the women embroiled in espionage, where military secrets and government cover-ups form the basis of the first two episodes. The final two involve Millie getting into trouble over her under-the-table business dealings. She ends up kidnapped as a result, leaving Alice, Jean and Lucy to track her down before all four women try to bring down the cartel that's profiteering off stolen goods and young prostitutes.On that note, the format of series two is a little different: whereas the first series was a straightforward three-part miniseries, this has two storylines divided over the course of four episodes. Furthermore, the last two episodes do not involve Susan, with the focus shifting to Millie and Alice instead.Along with the attention to detail in visualizing the 1950s (the fashions, the cars, the lingo), I hugely appreciated the emphasis that's put on paperwork. These women don't have access to computers or databases; if they want information they have to sit down and trawl through endless files in order to get it. There's a real sense of the intelligence and patience of these women, traits that would have served them well during the war years.Personally I was not quite as riveted by the second series as I was by the first, but ""The Bletchley Circle"" continues to be a unique crime-drama starring compelling and sympathetic female characters.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[52, 56]","First off, it you have not already seen Season 1, I recommend that you do as you'll learn the background on the characters. (You can find my review on Amazon.) With that said, I will proceed with my review of this wonderful ""series"" but I should also point out that this is a review of the DVD version (from PBS home Video - which they sent to me) which includes bonus features. Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL review of all formats of a show (broadcast, streaming and DVD and BD). You should always sort reviews by ""newest first"" and then look at format the reviewer is commenting on.A bit of background on what is here. Unlike US TV series which go on for at least 13 episodes, British TV series can be much shorter. The first season of The Bletchley Circle (TBC) was a three part story running 135 minutes. This ""Season Two"" DVD contains two independent ""stories"" (each divided into two 45 minute ""episiodes""). The show was created, and aired, in the UK on the commercial ITV network (not the non-commercial BBC) and later aired on PBS in the US. To my knowledge these are the ITV originals. I did not see the US-PBS broadcast version but they are usually edited for some graphic images of violence.I do not believe in ""spoilers"" and you won't find any here. Just some basic info: Season One took place in 1951 or 1952 after giving us scenes from their 1940s war years.  This season bring the characters - a group of female ""code breakers"" who were based in Bletchley, England during World War II - up to 1953 when they are now in civilian lives during the Cold War. (There is a brief sojourn back to 1943 at the beginning to set up the story - but I can't say much more about that either. In each of the two stories this time, one of the women is a victim of a crime and the others band together to solve it.The script is written by a male but nearly all the actors (and the directors - there are two) are female.The DVD has one bonus feature and it's well done. It's a 27 minute featurette featuring interviews with all the cast and production crew (with a few clips from the show, but - thankfully - not many). It is bookended with a  new interview with one of the actual Bletchley Project members. And for those following the series, the interview with the director of the second story on this DVD, will bring some real surprises (I said NO ""spoilers"" from me, remember?).From what I can tell, there will be a third season though, as I noted above, the two stories in Season Two each can stand on their own with no ""cliffhangers:.Another fine British TV ""mystery"" drama.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Season Two of this series moves us into the Cold War years with two two-part 90 minute episodes and nice bonus on the DVD,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2672,"['First', 'off', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'seen', 'Season', '1', 'recommend', 'do', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'background', 'characters', 'can', 'find', 'review', 'Amazon', 'said', 'will', 'proceed', 'review', 'wonderful', 'series', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'review', 'DVD', 'version', 'PBS', 'home', 'Video', 'sent', 'bonus', 'features', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'review', 'formats', 'show', 'broadcast', 'streaming', 'DVD', 'BD', 'should', 'always', 'sort', 'reviews', 'newest', 'first', 'then', 'look', 'reviewer', 'commenting', 'on.A', 'bit', 'background', 'what', 'here', 'US', 'TV', 'series', 'go', 'least', '13', 'episodes', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'shorter', 'first', 'season', 'Bletchley', 'Circle', 'TBC', 'was', 'three', 'part', 'story', 'running', '135', 'minutes', 'Season', 'Two', 'DVD', 'two', 'independent', 'stories', 'divided', 'two', '45', 'minute', 'episiodes', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'aired', 'UK', 'commercial', 'ITV', 'network', 'not', 'non-commercial', 'BBC', 'later', 'aired', 'PBS', 'US', 'knowledge', 'are', 'ITV', 'originals', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'US-PBS', 'broadcast', 'version', 'are', 'usually', 'edited', 'graphic', 'images', 'violence.I', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'Just', 'basic', 'info', 'Season', 'One', 'took', 'place', '1951', '1952', 'giving', 'scenes', '1940s', 'war', 'years', 'season', 'bring', 'characters', 'group', 'female', 'code', 'breakers', 'who', 'were', 'based', 'Bletchley', 'England', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'up', '1953', 'when', 'are', 'now', 'civilian', 'lives', 'Cold', 'War', 'brief', 'sojourn', 'back', '1943', 'beginning', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'two', 'stories', 'time', 'one', 'women', 'victim', 'crime', 'others', 'band', 'together', 'solve', 'it.The', 'script', 'written', 'male', 'nearly', 'actors', 'directors', 'are', 'two', 'are', 'female.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'well', 'done', '27', 'minute', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'cast', 'production', 'crew', 'few', 'clips', 'show', 'thankfully', 'not', 'many', 'bookended', 'new', 'interview', 'one', 'actual', 'Bletchley', 'Project', 'members', 'following', 'series', 'interview', 'director', 'second', 'story', 'DVD', 'will', 'bring', 'real', 'surprises', 'said', 'NO', 'spoilers', 'remember', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'will', 'be', 'third', 'season', 'though', 'noted', 'two', 'stories', 'Season', 'Two', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'cliffhangers', 'fine', 'British', 'TV', 'mystery', 'drama.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Bletchley Circle: Season 2

As someone else said, it was lackluster and seemed forced.  I was especially disappointed with not only the change in the Susan character, but that she was written out of the series completely.  IMO, she was the main character and the glue that held the group together so to speak.  If by some change there is another season, I won't be purchasing it until after I see it on TV.

Though interesting at first it soon degenerated from an intellectual exercise into a melodramatic murder mystery.The second season basically continued this emphasis on a standard murder mystery and ended up being no different from Foyle's War except that it involves four women after World War II whereas Foyle's War involved Foyle and his driver during World War II.Nevertheless, the second season somewhat redeemed itself in the fourth and last episode by reverting back to codebreaking.  The girls needed a German Enigma code machine to decode encrypted messages used by a villain who had once apparently worked for British intelligence.  It seems that these codebreaking skills are essentially limited to actual codebreaking but I thought the best idea came from the first episode of season one when the girls used these skills to analyze the train travel habits of a serial killer.This second season has also toned down the political correctness.  It spends less time attacking men and the police.  It also goes so far as to make the villains in the second part an ethnic minority, a criminal gang from Malta (including a wartime British intelligence recruit).  It even presents its first female villain as the woman who runs the criminal enterprise.  While the chances of a woman running a Maltese criminal gang in the early 1950s must be zero, it is a step forward.One of the most interesting parts of this series is that it portrays the early 1950s in Britain.  But I remember the 1950s and there were no women with the hair style and tight-fitting dresses that Millie wears.  If there were we would have had no reason to move on from that era.
