Even though PBS comes in with lots of ghosting and static, I watched the first five episodes, then bought the DVD to watch the rest. My father was a carrier pilot, but beyond that personal connection, it is interesting to see the different military mindsets up and down the ranks. To some extent, our American class structure replicates itself on board the Nimitz. Non-commissioned support grades are highly integrated while command is still largely, though not entirely, white and male. Command staff are generally gung-ho patriotic; Lower ranks are often just as intense but some express, ""It's just a job"" or, ""We're here for the oil"" opinions, too. If Carrier is any indication, the Navy offers full employment, hard work, intense supervision and the sort of camaraderie you don't always find on dry land. That so many of these folk admitted they needed all that is a sad commentary on parenting, schooling and society.The documentary is definitely character-driven, with some personal revelations drawing gasps from my wife, who identified all too well with the working class element on board. One episode featured a good ol' OK boy that tragically couldn't (or wouldn't) get past his racist upbringing. Another sad moment was the fallout from an inebriated sexual encounter, while on liberty, between two shipmates that barely even knew each other.Update: I think I can see why some have complained about the personal stories. Whereas the first five or six hours struck a good balance between the requirements of the mission and the personal stories of the crew, the last three or four hours focused almost entirely on personal situations. To some extent this is understandable since the primary mission was completed, but as much as I connected with their stories, all that personal griping did become a bit tedious.",5,American Society in Miniature,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,1855,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'documentaries', 'Even', 'PBS', 'lots', 'ghosting', 'static', 'watched', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'then', 'bought', 'DVD', 'watch', 'rest', 'father', 'was', 'carrier', 'pilot', 'personal', 'connection', 'interesting', 'see', 'different', 'military', 'mindsets', 'up', 'ranks', 'extent', 'American', 'class', 'structure', 'board', 'Nimitz', 'Non-commissioned', 'support', 'grades', 'are', 'highly', 'integrated', 'command', 'still', 'largely', 'not', 'entirely', 'white', 'male', 'Command', 'staff', 'are', 'generally', 'gung-ho', 'patriotic', 'Lower', 'ranks', 'are', 'often', 'just', 'intense', 'express', 'just', 'job', ""'re"", 'here', 'oil', 'opinions', 'too', 'Carrier', 'indication', 'Navy', 'offers', 'full', 'employment', 'hard', 'work', 'intense', 'supervision', 'sort', 'camaraderie', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'find', 'dry', 'land', 'so', 'many', 'folk', 'admitted', 'needed', 'sad', 'commentary', 'parenting', 'schooling', 'society.The', 'documentary', 'definitely', 'character-driven', 'personal', 'revelations', 'drawing', 'gasps', 'wife', 'who', 'identified', 'too', 'well', 'working', 'class', 'element', 'board', 'One', 'episode', 'featured', 'good', 'ol', 'OK', 'boy', 'tragically', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'racist', 'upbringing', 'sad', 'moment', 'was', 'fallout', 'inebriated', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'liberty', 'two', 'shipmates', 'barely', 'even', 'knew', 'other.Update', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'have', 'complained', 'personal', 'stories', 'first', 'five', 'six', 'hours', 'struck', 'good', 'balance', 'requirements', 'mission', 'personal', 'stories', 'crew', 'last', 'three', 'four', 'hours', 'focused', 'almost', 'entirely', 'personal', 'situations', 'extent', 'understandable', 'primary', 'mission', 'was', 'completed', 'as', 'much', 'connected', 'stories', 'personal', 'griping', 'did', 'become', 'bit', 'tedious']",Carrier

Depicted the aduous life of 5500 sailors aboard a warship on overseas deployment.The ten episodes profile many of the officers and Enlisted, both men and women, from lowest ranking to highest crewmember.  The mixture of fighter pilots to Aviation Boatswain's Mates to Mess Management Specialists to Petty Officers to the Chiefs, is all here.The only thing missing, quite naturally, was much if anything about the below desks Nuclear Reactors and those highly secretive, wonderous ship's propulsion operations.  Suffice to say, a nuclear carrier, at 90,000+ tons displacement, can operate underway without refueling for decades.Surprisingly, the U.S. Navy has found a way for the crew, both men and women, straights and gays, to perform some of the most dangerous jobs imaginable.  They work side by side, 24/7, while air ops are underway, but still keep their ""off duty"" personal lives separate; a feat easier said than done under such congested living conditions.  The aircraft carrier and airwings' daily routine are in complete harmony and about efficient as any large organization possibly can be.I believe this is the best documentary depicting in great detail, what it is really like to be in the Navy, in the history of documentary films.

1153016,A2YLX1IY5FGAZX,B00169E5JQ,Erin Campbell,"[50, 53]","I just finished watching ""Carrier"" on PBS and was extremely impressed by the honest, warts-and-all portrayal of life aboard a carrier.  The producers did an outstanding job providing compelling human-interest storylines and showing the diversity of attitudes among the sailors, airmen, and Marines regarding their military service.  The show captures the real ambivalence some have regarding our strategy on ""the war on terror"" and yet how they continue to serve professionally in fulfilling their duties.

I think that story is yet to be told. It does work when it concentrates on the various views of the officers and crew, but when it starts to focus on certain sailors, that is when it loses its way, at least for me.On the positive, there are some great shots of life on the Nimitz, the ones they can show you. There are parts of the ship I know they would not allow cameras. Overall, the cinematography was excellent and so was the camerawork.

I was expecting and hoping for a detailed viewing of the ship itself, its airplanes and all the gizmos that make the marvel of technology work. Instead the ten hours focused on the people, the crew from the guy who mopped the floors to the men and women flying aircraft into combat zones, the deck crew, the cooks, the hundreds of occupations it takes to make this colossus function.Above all, I am surprised that this was on PBS: it wasn't anti-war, anti-American, didn't celebrate left-wing dictators. It was a paean to the United States of America in it is wonderful.Little time (unfortunately in a way) is spent on the ship and its operations. Most of the time is spent in interviews and voiceovers with the crew. It is stunning that so many of the crew are so young. Teenagers or barely out of their teens. Many tell the stories of their short lives, stories they freely admit could have turned out horribly. Kids moving down the wrong paths in life - and entering the Navy helped them straighten out their lives.There are personal stories of how some of these people go off on a months long deployment, leaving families and loved ones behind with sometimes hurtful circumstances. How do you react when your wife miscarries while you are thousands of miles away in the Arabian Gulf? Your pregnant girlfriend doesn't communicate with you. Your divorced spouse is fighting with you over the custody of the kids and won't send you photographs of your youngest child's first day at school.And yet these people serve. They do their jobs for their nation and for their families: their real families and their Navy family.There are so many stories in ""Carrier"", not a one of which ultimately comes up empty or trite. The directors and editors have done their job extremely well. The story that ultimately comes across is not of the ship itself, but of these heroes - yes, they are heroes - who serve their country.As the Admiral says ""Count your blessings as Americans"".

In thirty plus years, nothing has changed, with exception of women on board warships now days.  At sea, it was a 24/7 operation.  On a Med cruise, once the carrier left the pier in Norfolk, you never tied up at a pier again until you returned to the states.  Always anchored out, and the always enjoyable boat ride to the dock.  The constant cleaning, the enjoyable 3 months spent `mess cooking', and like they pointed out in the show, the ship was like a huge high school.

Marsano ""Gerade aus Brooklyn""","[103, 108]","Owing to a childhood fascination, I've watched pretty much every documentary on carriers produced in the last ten years. A few of them have been Nat Geo productions, and the latest rounds play all the time on the Discovery Channel and the Military Channel. This series beats them all, hands down.The problem with most documentaries on this subject--or virtually any 'mainstream' docu on military topics, is that the filmmakers get distracted by the whistles, bells, and blinking lights of all the technology. As a result, the documentary lens becomes clouded by all the 'gee-whiz' of the technology and machines. Granted, this sort of perspective has its place. What gets lost, or uncovered, however, is something far more compelling, and that's the human element. A carrier is, as the old saying goes, a city at sea, and it's the lives of the crew that make for real storytelling, not more of the same file footage of missile launches or facts about the latest blocks of the CIWS and the takeoff thrust of an F/A-18 at full military power.This series focuses on the stories of the crew, and many of them are quite moving. It's hard not to get a lump in the throat when watching how hard these (predominantly) 18- and 19- year olds have to work in order to send aircraft over the bow, or how they're trying to meet the demands of family life from thousands of miles away at sea. Their personal struggles and hopes are the meat of this series.Production values on this series are quite high. I met the producers at a sneak preview and found that they had shot over 3,000 hours of HD video over the course of a six-month deployment. Working over that time, and with a 17-member production and shooting team, they found the real stories in the nooks and crannies of the ship. The editing, which was done by a team, is also quite good, as is the music design. The net result is a series that has the look and feel of a modern reality series, without any of the sensationalism. In short, it's filmmaking by adults. The assistance of the Navy was also nothing short of remarkable--here on the series some of the characters speak openly about how hard their jobs are, or how they work with gay crewmembers, or how they don't understand the war they're supporting. This internal confliction and confusion, from the words of servicemen and women, makes for real storytelling and makes this  series worth recommending above any other on the same topic.",4,The best documentary series on modern US Carriers,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,2442,"['Owing', 'childhood', 'fascination', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'pretty', 'much', 'documentary', 'carriers', 'produced', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'Nat', 'Geo', 'productions', 'latest', 'rounds', 'play', 'time', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Military', 'Channel', 'series', 'down.The', 'problem', 'most', 'documentaries', 'subject', 'virtually', ""'mainstream"", 'docu', 'military', 'topics', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'distracted', 'whistles', 'bells', 'blinking', 'lights', 'technology', 'result', 'documentary', 'becomes', 'clouded', ""'gee-whiz"", ""'"", 'technology', 'machines', 'Granted', 'sort', 'perspective', 'place', 'What', 'lost', 'uncovered', 'however', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'human', 'element', 'carrier', 'old', 'saying', 'city', 'sea', 'lives', 'crew', 'make', 'real', 'storytelling', 'not', 'more', 'same', 'file', 'footage', 'missile', 'launches', 'facts', 'latest', 'blocks', 'CIWS', 'takeoff', 'thrust', 'F/A-18', 'full', 'military', 'power.This', 'series', 'stories', 'crew', 'many', 'are', 'quite', 'moving', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'lump', 'throat', 'when', 'watching', 'how', 'hard', 'predominantly', '18-', '19-', 'year', 'olds', 'have', 'work', 'order', 'send', 'aircraft', 'bow', 'how', ""'re"", 'trying', 'meet', 'demands', 'family', 'life', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'sea', 'personal', 'struggles', 'hopes', 'are', 'meat', 'series.Production', 'series', 'are', 'quite', 'high', 'met', 'producers', 'sneak', 'preview', 'found', 'had', 'shot', '3,000', 'hours', 'HD', 'video', 'course', 'six-month', 'deployment', 'Working', 'time', '17-member', 'production', 'shooting', 'team', 'found', 'real', 'stories', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'ship', 'editing', 'was', 'done', 'team', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'music', 'design', 'net', 'result', 'series', 'look', 'feel', 'modern', 'reality', 'series', 'sensationalism', 'short', 'filmmaking', 'adults', 'assistance', 'Navy', 'was', 'also', 'nothing', 'short', 'remarkable', 'here', 'series', 'characters', 'speak', 'openly', 'how', 'hard', 'jobs', 'are', 'how', 'work', 'gay', 'crewmembers', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'war', ""'re"", 'supporting', 'internal', 'confliction', 'confusion', 'words', 'servicemen', 'women', 'real', 'storytelling', 'series', 'recommending', 'other', 'same', 'topic']",Carrier

While my ships were much smaller than the Nimitz this program still brought me back to those Navy days. I think the production crew did a great job of showing life aboard the carrier. I was so pleased with the series that I actually watched it a second time after a two year break from the first watching.I wish a different view could have been exposed of life aboard the ship though. This series seemed to heavily focus on the lower level of jobs aboard the ship. Mentions were made of the middle level jobs such as radar operators, communications technicians, and other jobs, but the series painted too bleak a picture of ship life.My experience was much better as I was an Electronics Technician on a ship with a crew of about 250 men. I only mention this so others who watch this series doesn't get a tainted picture of the Navy. My personal experience led to a lifelong career that I fully credit to my Navy schooling. It also left me with a love for the sea and many happy years sailing, SCUBA diving, and jet skiing on the ocean.The many shots of carrier take-offs and landings were great too. I highly recommend this series. For those who have had no military exposure this is also a great way to see the way our tax dollars are used to protect our country.

Still, it is effective in providing a portrait of what motivates US Navy Personnel today.  Perhaps overly long at 10 episodes, the length of the series does give some ideal of the monotonous nature of modern naval service.  The Carrier USS Nimitz seems to provide a modern US Gunboat diplomacy for our gov.  Why this is necessary is never quite explained, although some of the crew do question what the purpose of their mission is.  The Carrier seems to bounce around various potential trouble spots, while pulling in for various ports of call to amuse the crew and provide some needed diversion.  All of this would seem to be very expensive for today's US tax payer!At length the ship arrives off the Persian Gulf to provide back-up for on-going sundry operations against Insurgents in Iraq.  Again, it seems excessive to have such a powerful vessle supporting various small unit actions on the ground.  In fact the Nimitz F-16s are never called upon once to provide direct ground support and spend most of their time hovering overhead.  Again, a huge waste of money.  In fact ths mis-placed use of the Nimitz serves as a mirror for virtually the whole Iraqi operation.  Presumptiously called Op Iraqi Freedom.  The Freedom remains an open question to this day.  Still, the majority of the crew seem to feel they are doing right in their mission and one can't help admiring their trust in the system.In looking at this series one can see that the navy is different things for different people.  On the upper level are the officers and highly trained navy pilots who seem to get the most out of the service.  On the lower level are the younger members of the crew providing various grunt work to support the whole effort.  For many of these kids the navy is a stop-gap for what could be a far worse life on the streets of urban America.  The service provides a degree of stability and discipline that many American youth lack and desperately need.While a bit preechy at times, and venturing a bit into Realty TV realms, this series is none the less a fascianting look at today's US navy and the crew who make it work.

The endless 'interviews'  with - mostly - the same individuals fails to provide a true overall picture of the thinking of the crew - which numbered over 5,000 souls.Far to many of those interviewed made me, personally, ashamed to be proud of a Navy and seriously doubtful whether some of the crew of this vast Carrier would perform adequately in times of a 'real' war. The tremendous naivety of more than a few crew members was compounded by the demonstrated ignorance of 'normal' everyday life and living. In this, it must be stressed, it was largely the 'lower deck' and younger crew members who caused this perspective to become most evident. The Officers and Senior Ranks certainly appeared a much better educated and cosmopolitan group of individuals.The whole programme could have been contained, without loss of interesting or important comment, in a three hour - maximum four hour - programme/DVD.The actual working life of those aboard was very interesting - but seriously curtailed.Sadly, for I was keenly anticipating viewing the DVD, I found myself glad it was over!  2 stars out of 5 is the maximum I can, with any conscious, accord this DVD.Incidentally, the BBC did a similar programme some 30 or so years ago.
