CBS/Paramount better get on the ball and offer up the rest before the entire generation who saw Gunsmoke from 55-75 are ""Up on Boot Hill"".  May I suggest selling the first 7 seasons (I believe they were B/W and 30 minutes pershow) as a set for $149.99???  Or the entire 20 year series for $350??  I think that makes a reasonable profit for the studio, while giving options to those Gunsmoke lovers of various financial means.  All I've seen are some ""questionable"" websites claiming to have the ENTIRE SERIES available, but one wonders if the whole series is out there then why isn't the 20 year series  available on Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, etc.?????

1071270,A268TJ88VHO5IP,B000PHX5KU,Arbitrator,"[3, 5]","Good questions! I have some too based on the first season episodes.How come Matt handcuffs a bad guy but doesn't bother to cuff him TO some object, thereby allowing the prisoner to conk him on the head and try to escape?How come he sometimes leaves his empty office unlocked, only to return and find some stranger sitting at his desk, with ready access to a rack full of rifles? (Sure, there's a lock on the rack but, seriously, how hard would it be to shatter that lock?)How come he gets shot in the gut more than once and seems to shake it off like the proverbial ""flesh wound""? Sure, the writers might want to have him get shot once in a while for dramatic effect but maybe it would work better if he got ""winged"" in the arm or leg with a ""thru-n-thru""? Gut wounds in the Old West were pretty dangerous, especially Doc Adams has to dig the slug out of your chest!How come Matt's got so much time to wander around Boot Hill?!Why was poor ole Chester never deputized? Wouldn't that have made his ""job"" (whatever it was!) much easier, especially when he's ostensibly ""in charge"" when Matt's on one of his mysterious week-long trips ""out of town""?When I had only seen the later hour-long episodes, I used to wonder why Matt never settled down with Miss Kitty; indeed never even kissed her. Now that I realize she started her days as a saloon prostitute, I have a better understanding!How come Dodge City citizens have such a pro-Confederacy bias that some of them want to hang a Yankee veteran passing through? Kansas entered the Union as a free state and Kansas military veterans served in the Union Army. Dodge City itself wasn't even in existence until after the Civil War.How come Matt pays for everything with one coin, looks to be a silver dollar, from his shirt pocket? Does everything cost a dollar, or does he round up everything to a dollar leaving the change as a tip? One episode seems to indicate he was paid $100 a month. A U.S. marshal was probably paid decently, so say a modern lawman makes at least $50k. If that's comparable in buying power, Matt Dillon's silver dollar is worth 40 of today's dollars. 40 bucks for a shot of whiskey and a beer for Chester?? 40 bucks for two plates of eggs & biscuits? I guess Matt was a classic Ole West ""Big Spender!"" (A lot of Westerns seem to play it very loosely with the comparative buying power of the dollar. Check out the wanted posters in and outside Matt's office. The ransom on one bad guy is $2000! That's almost two years of Matt's pay. He'd be better off resigning and tracking down ""owlhoots"" for the reward money, if being a U.S. marshal wasn't in his blood!)Fun to raise questions like these but it's all in fun.

Yes, I know that a complete set of ALL the episodes does not exist at this time and yes, I know that this wish also implies a means to watch it, electricity or batteries, etc, but just go with me on this one for a minute, k?I only started watching Gunsmoke a little more than ten years ago. As it happens, by NYC parenting standards I was a little strict with my kids about t.v. content and so after supper we'd have family t.v. time and watch Little House on the Prairie. When we'd exhausted all the aired episodes of that on TV Land, as a slight variation on the theme we decided to watch Gunsmoke. This was no little house on the prairie; this was a whole different side of the west. The untamed part. The part watched over by none other than U.S. Marshall Matt Dillon. From my first episode was I hooked - simply put, James Arness plays this role to utter perfection.I had only seen the years aired on TV Land up until a couple of years ago, but when those became reruns for me I got a Netflix subscription to be able to see more of the series. If you've only seen them in color or the later years on t.v., these first episodes in the series are startling by contrast. Visually the black and white images+filming techniques have a unique dimensional quality that the color does not. If you remember those those 3-D postcards when you were a kid and how it looked like you could fall right into them, that's the *feeling* I got when watching that first episode in black and white. In the first episode you'll see Matt on his horse by a tree looking down on a posse below - this image is an example of this 2D/3D effect. Literally gives another dimension to enjoying the program.Then, there's the stories.... the characters.... the acting.I could go on here but we've all read (or could read) the synopsis and lengthier reviews. I won't go into a lot of detail because others have said it better than I could but I will add my two cents.Opie Tater - an episode not to be missed and IMO, this episode is quintessentially Gunsmoke. Of the 20 years worth of episodes, honestly, I've seen about 14 years worth and this one definitely stands out among my favorites as having the essence of what the show is like, what it's about, and the standards of story and acting to expect.Again, could go on here too but with twenty years of programs, that's a lot of waxing poetic and that time would be better used by actually seeing an episode or two.I can't recommend the series enough.

Hornaday,"[216, 219]","I applaud this release of the entire first season of Gunsmoke on DVD, and hope the remainder of the best TV western ever made will also be released.Gunsmoke, the longest running western in TV history (or TV drama for that matter at 20 years and 635 episodes), is complex and textured, dealing with mature themes and unforgettable characters that became part of our culture. It was billed as the first `adult western.'I grew up watching the series, which debuted in 1955 as a half-hour black and white show then progressed to an hour in its seventh season, and began being produced in color in 1966.The original opening depicted the Marshall in a fast-draw gunfight against a villain he killed, but this was toned down years later after groups complained of violence. As a result, rather than seeing the villain fall dead, the camera instead stayed only on Dillon as he drew his `peacemaker.' In the 70's, the opening eliminated the gunfight altogether and depicted Dillon riding quickly across the range. In the 1960's, early episodes of the series were rebroadcast as `Marshall Dillon.'The much-honored and beloved show went off the air in 1975. Thirty-nine glorious black and white half-hour shows comprise this incredible set.Few need to be told what his western depicted: It's the story of Marshall Matt Dillon (played to perfection by James Arness) who tamed the lawless Dodge City, Kansas, in 1873. He did so not only with his six-shooter but with his courage, sense of honor, justice and irreproachable integrity behind the badge.A radio show predated the TV series and aired from 1952 to 1961. The radio Marshall was voiced by William Conrad (who later portrayed the lead role of the portly private investigator `Cannon' in the 1970's.) When CBS decided to produce a TV series, Conrad wanted the role, but wasn't chosen because of his girth. The rumor that western icon John `Duke' Wayne was offered the pivotal role of Dillon, but he turned it down and instead recommended his good friend Arness, has largely been debunked.In addition to Dillon, the core characters are Miss Kitty Russell (Amanda Blake), owner of the Longbranch Saloon and Matt's long-time love and lover; the crusty but sensitive Doctor Galen Adams (Milburn Stone); and Deputy Chester Goode (Dennis Weaver). Burt Reynolds also had a recurring role as Quint Asper from 1962-1965. Ken Curtis replaced Goode as `Matthew's' Deputy Festus Haggen, who portrayed the loveable deputy who couldn't read from 1959 through the end of the series. Gunsmith then deputy Newly O'Brien (portrayed by Buck Taylor) moved to Dodge City in 1967 and remained until the show went off the air. Pat Hingle portrayed hard-nosed Doctor John Chapman for six episodes in 1971 when Milburn Stone left briefly for health reasons.Arness and Stone remained through the series entire 20-year run, while Blake brilliantly portrayed the red-headed Kitty for 19 seasons.Weekly guest stars represented the cream of the acting crop for decades! Here's an example: Bette Davis, Victor French, Morgan Woodward, Jack Elam, Denver Pyle, Jeanette Nolan, Jim Davis, Warren Oates, Jacqueline Scott, George Kennedy, Ed Nelson, Michael Learned, Forrest Tucker, Paul Fix, Slim Pickens, Bruce Dern, Harry Morgan, Steve Forfest, Richard Kiley, Beverly Garland and Leonard Nimoy.Here are the episodes included in this boxed set: Matt Gets It (Debut);

1071292,A2ENJGKZZCVNKK,B000PHX5KU,"Henry-Clyde ""cLaSsIc MoViE lOvEr AnD bOoK rEaDeR""","[4, 4]","""GUNSMOKE"" premiered in 1955 and was canceled in 1975, for a total of 20 seasons and 635 episodes. It is one of the best, if not the best, television series of all time. Originally, it was in the black and white half hour format, then it went to black and white full hour, and finally to the beloved color full hour programming. The episodes in color are probably the best known to today's audiences. But I guarantee you that the episodes from the original black and white programming are just as good, and the first season is no exception. This great show also had an excellent cast. James Arness was Marshal Matt Dillon of Dodge City, Kansas, Amanda Blake was Miss Kitty Russell, a prostitute at first, and then later the full owner of The Long Branch. When the show first started out, Kitty was just a madame, or, as the show so cleverly disguised it, a ""saloon girl"". Over time, the many fans of the show began to see her profession as awkward, because how could she work in the saloon when there was a certain special relationship between her and Matt? Since the show was so strongly devoted to its fans, the writers changed Miss Kitty to at first half owner, and then later, full owner. However, the show never took Kitty and Matt's relationship to a higher level. It would be strange to see Marshal Dillon come home to a house full of kids, now wouldn't it? Also in the main cast were Dennis Weaver as Chester Goode, and Milburn Stone as Galen ""Doc"" Adams. Chester was not a deputy, but more of a helper to Matt. He was best known for his straight legged limp and his high pitched cries of ""Mr. Dillon"". Doc was a crusty and cantankerous old coot on the outside, but had a very good heart on the inside. The constant friendly badgering between Doc and Chester was always hilarious, so much that they eventually became somewhat of a comedy act. Unfortunately, Weaver left the show in 1964 to pursue other things. This is when the newer and more familiar to modern audience age of ""Gunsmoke"" was ushered in. When the show brought in Ken Curtis as Festus Haggen in 1959, Roger Ewing as Thad Greenwood in 1965, and Buck Taylor as Newly O'Brien in 1967. But I am not picky, and love any episode just as much as another. I shall look forward to all those episodes, some of which I have never seen. Other wonderful characteristics of this show were its impeccable use of guest stars, and transitioning the Western genre from the old serials of the 1940's to the adult Western. This show was actually the first adult television Western. The writers and producers attempt was to break away from the cliche-laden Lone Ranger to the realistic West. No masked men found here! The first season of ""Gunsmoke"" did not feature as much as it would later in the way of special guest stars, because it was just viewed as another Western. However, this first season did have several guest stars, such as John Dehner, Royal Dano, Aaron Spelling, Charles Bronson, and Strother Martin. The guest stars can be found more abundantly in later seasons, but it did not take long for the producers to realize the jackpot they had found for television.

Remember, if they go the distance and complete the entire series that will be 20 box sets and at a release rate of 2, maybe 3 sets a year, it will take at minimum the better part of eight years to release the entire series. And if past history is any indication, sometimes studios aren't committed to staying the course with releasing long-running TV series in season by season box sets. An example of this would be ""Hill Street Blues"" which ran seven seasons but Fox Home Entertainment so far has only released seasons 1 (in 2004) and 2 (in 2005) and seems to have lost interest in proceeding with releasing that remainder of the series. The seem to have also gotten cold feet with releasing any more than the first four seasons of the Bob Newhart Show which ran a total of 8 seasons but their last release was Season 4 and that was over two years ago. PHV has also committed ""Perry Mason"" to DVD in it's entirety and that series ran 9 seasons. They're releasing it in 2 volumes per season sequence, two sets a year. At that rate it will take nine years for them to release the whole series.

1071297,ANRTCX6S5BNUY,B000PHX5KU,Jean,"[3, 4]","Other TV westerns have been good but non of them matched up to Gunsmoke.  I was just starting high school when it came on the air and watched it all of the years it was on.  I had forgotten that it was originally a half hour show, but even then all of the episodes are so well written and the actors great. The later expansion to an hour enabled the stories to have more depth and am looking forward to those.  It is easy to see why the show was on the air for over 20 years.  Imagine an actor/actress today being told they have to film 39 episodes for a show for one season when they complain about being over worked with the few they do now for a half hour show.I hope they don't wait too long between the release of seasons so it does not take forever to get them all.  It would also be nice if there could be an interview of James Arness and/or Dennis Weaver while they are still with us.  Last winter I saw an interview of James Arness and the show was discussed  and it was good to see him and he still looks great although he is in his 80's now.

I always preferred the 30 minute version of Gunsmoke to the 1 hour version that came later in the series.  I enjoy Dennis Weaver as Chester Good.  This is a show that my father and I watched every Saturday evening for several years.  It came on at 10 PM and was followed by a 30 minute show called ""Highway Patrol"" with Broderick Crawford.  My Mom was always fussing because it kept me up late on Saturday evening and she said it made me cranky when she was trying to get me ready for Sunday School and church the next morning.  My Dad always defended me, saying, ""Has she ever missed a Sunday School lesson or a church service because she was tired on Sunday?"" And, the answer was always no.

I know it's been out for some 6 years now, but i'm not up to date with this new DVD technology stuff lol (I stuck to VHS tapes until about 3 years ago). I purchased season 1 because I never saw any of these episodes before. This is the debut season from 1955-1956. That's way before my time watching TV, but I swear to you I must have watched all of the colorized episodes in the late 60s and 70s. I recall some black and whites, but Festus was Matt's partner by then. I never saw this Chester character before on the show so this DVD is great start to getting into Gunsmoke. This season (and the next 5) are half hour episodes, something else I never knew. I grew up watching full 1 hour episodes. These half hours seem to fly by and get the plot in much faster, which I find interesting. The actors look so young in this one too. As it turn out, the series is now released in half seasons box sets, so I invested in a home-made version of the entire series (don't tell anyone!!!). This home-made set turned out great and it has all these older episodes too, so i'm through with these half seasons. Nonetheless, I have season 1 on store DVD. While i'd recommend a home-made set, many people would rather wait for the official releases, but I find them too expensive, though this is the only full season, so grab this one and then decide what's best for you.",5,My favorite childhood show's roots!,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,1394,"[""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'Gunsmoke', 'DVD', 'know', 'been', 'out', '6', 'years', 'now', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'up', 'date', 'new', 'DVD', 'technology', 'stuff', 'lol', 'stuck', 'VHS', 'tapes', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'purchased', 'season', '1', 'never', 'saw', 'episodes', 'before', 'debut', 'season', '1955-1956', 'way', 'time', 'watching', 'TV', 'swear', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'colorized', 'episodes', 'late', '60s', '70s', 'recall', 'black', 'whites', 'Festus', 'was', 'Matt', 'partner', 'then', 'never', 'saw', 'Chester', 'character', 'show', 'so', 'DVD', 'great', 'start', 'getting', 'Gunsmoke', 'season', 'next', '5', 'are', 'half', 'hour', 'episodes', 'something', 'else', 'never', 'knew', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'full', '1', 'hour', 'episodes', 'half', 'hours', 'seem', 'fly', 'get', 'plot', 'much', 'faster', 'find', 'interesting', 'actors', 'look', 'so', 'young', 'one', 'too', 'out', 'series', 'now', 'released', 'half', 'seasons', 'box', 'sets', 'invested', 'home-made', 'version', 'entire', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'home-made', 'set', 'turned', 'out', 'great', 'older', 'episodes', 'too', 'i', ""'m"", 'half', 'seasons', 'Nonetheless', 'have', 'season', '1', 'store', 'DVD', 'i', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'home-made', 'set', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'wait', 'official', 'releases', 'find', 'too', 'expensive', 'only', 'full', 'season', 'so', 'grab', 'one', 'then', 'decide', 'what', 'best']",Gunsmoke: Season 1
1071301,A3LVLDQW7N1HWN,B000PHX5KU,John Robinson,"[13, 14]","James Arness portrayed Marshall Matt Dillon with a ""quiet-cool"" that has gone unmatched in the history of television. Arness himself had that ""quiet-cool"" quality in real life as well. When you pick up any show-biz/gossip magazine these days, you see the same old faces in EVERY magazine - they mug, they pose, they appear places just to get their pictures taken, they have ""entourages"", blah-blah-blah. Not James Arness. He didn't like the Hollywood party scene and only appeared in places he was expected to be. His picture in magazines was a rarity, but when we saw one, it was a real treat! Arness didn't have to pretend or try to be a star.....this man WAS a star, in the truest fashion of the term.All right, on to this DVD package. There are only a couple of extras, those being original show sponsors. Imagine Marshall Dillon and Doc Adams talking about the great smoke you get with L&M; cigarettes! John Wayne himself introduces the premiere GUNSMOKE episode, taking note that Jim Arness is going to be a huge star (he was right).And get a load of this list of partial guest stars: Aaron Spelling, Barry Atwater (the vampire of ""The Night Stalker""), Brett Halsey, Charles Bronson, Chuck Connors, Claude Akins, Dabbs Greer, Dan Blocker, DeForest Kelley, Ed Platt (the Chief on ""Get Smart""), Howard McNear (Floyd on ""The Andy Griffith Show""), James Drury, John Carradine, John Dehner, Keye Luke, Lola Albright (WOW!), Raymond Bailey (Mr. Drysdale on ""The Beverly Hillbillies""), Robert Vaughn, Royal Dano, Sebastian Cabot, Strother Martin and William Hopper! (I wonder if guest star Raymond Bailey remembered his appearance on GUNSMOKE and got the name for ""Milburn Drysdale"" from Milburn Stone who played Doc? Just a thought.....)Adding to the great guest line-up are a few episode screenplays written by future film director Sam Peckinpah.Amanda Blake looks incredible in this season...it's a wonder why Marshall Dillon didn't take her up on her advances...or did he? As the episodes progress, you'll notice how Miss Kitty gradually adds more makeup. She also makes it known (more than once) to Matt that she'd like to be his wife - something that would continue throughout her stay on the show.In this season, we get no clue as to what Chester is. Is he a deputy? He wears no badge. Is he just a sidekick? Whenever Matt introduces him to someone it's always as plain old ""Chester Goode,"" never as ""deputy"" or any other title.....so what the heck is he? It's not even revealed what caused the limp in his leg...or is it wooden? Sometimes the leg is so stiff (especially when he's runnin'), it looks like it's supposed to be wood!Milburn Stone dives right in as Doc Adams, all crusty & blustery right from the get-go.This first season has the familiar GUNSMOKE theme but with the added ""clip-clop"" effect that was later dropped.Bloopers left in include the gravestones at the beginning of most of the episodes; they wobble when the wind blows.....and listen for an airplane flying overhead in the episode ""The Hunter."" By the way, the opening to almost every show where Matt walks through Boot Hill was so identifiable with the show, it was even parodied in MAD (before it became a magazine, when it was still a comic book).The last time I saw these first GUNSMOKE shows was when it was syndicated under the title ""Marshall Dillon"" and the shows were fuzzy. Now, it's like discovering lost episodes! The clarity is so crisp and clean, it's absolutely extraordinary.The stories are not what you'd expect - Marshall Dillon doesn't always save the victims in time, he doesn't always have the right answer, the wrong people get killed and there are plot twists that you won't see coming - this is NOT one of those predictable 50's TV programs! No wonder this show lasted 20 years! There's even a show about drug addiction - opium, to be exact - that you wouldn't think they would even dare to do in sterile 50's television.....but GUNSMOKE did!If you're alert, you may catch a few historical innaccuracies, but who really cares? This is extremely enjoyable stuff...so if one of the characters mentions a certain year that doesn't sound correct, just ignore it...IT DOESN'T MATTER...IT'S ONLY A TV SHOW!I noticed some similarities between GUNSMOKE and ""The Andy Griffith Show;"" both programs had the wise-but-tough marshall/sheriff and the goofy-but-lovable sidekick/deputy. Even the episode titled ""Chester's Mail Order Bride"" could've easily been re-written as an Andy Griffith episode. In fact, I think it was! Watch it and see for yourself.....and I wish I had a dollar for every time some bad guy said ""this ain't nunna yore bizness marshall,"" ""stay out of this marshall,"" ""you'll be sorry, marshall"" or ""just try and stop me, marshall!"" I'd be rich.I can't say enough good things about this set.

The action is almost nonstop.  Sure, there's some jawin' at The Long Branch (have to get Miss Kitty in somehow), however, there's very little of that. I've alway's liked Amanda Blake, however, Matt and Chester are too busy out gettin' the bad guys and doc is too busy stichin' people up to be doin' a lot of sittin' around jawin'.As much as many of you probably like Festus from 1963 onward, you're going to love Chester. There's been some misinformation out there. Chester was never Marshall Dillon's Deputy. He'd help the marshal around the office, many times around town, and quite often would ride out of town with Matt on official business, however, I believe that Dennis Weaver said on a recent DVD set that he was never a deputy. When you look carefully at the episodes when they come out in July you won't see a deputy star on Chester. I believe that Festus did become a deputy.Personally, I'll probably just purchase all eight seasons that have Chester. Dennis Weaver was just that tremendous as Chester and he and James Arness had such good chemestry together.At The Long Branch you'll see some kidding between Chester and Doc that will remind you of the kidding between Festus and Doc, you'll see Matt sitting there and, of course Miss Kitty. However, you won't see as much of all of the jawin' because Doc has some stichin' up to do in his office and Matt and Chester have some bad guys to get!Dennis Weaver, as Chester, has some great funny lines, however, the emphasis is on action and it's action that you'll get!

1071303,AKQM58BHRSXC7,B000PHX5KU,LastRanger,"[1, 1]","In the mid 1800's on the dusty main-street of Dodge City, Kansas, a lawman and an outlaw face each other in a six-gun duel that only one of them can survive.  In 1955 John Wayne made a rare television appearance to introduce what was to become America's defining TV western.  In its first season Gunsmoke would break all  the traditional molds for the squeaky-clean lawman that always gets his man.  Instead what the viewers got was a gritty, sweaty, tour de force of the Wild West.  In Matt Dillon America found a tough, honest, lawman that could stand up to an angry mob yet knew when it was time to back down for the greater good.  With a stellar cast of relatively unknown actors the show boasted fine performances by James Arness, Amanda Blake, Milburn Stone and Dennis Weaver along with a strong supporting cast and host of top name guest stars.  People like Chuck Connors, Keye Luke, Charles Bronson and Sebastian Cabot make guest appearances in many episodes. The scripts were outstanding and ran the gamete from intense drama to light hearted comedy, with several done by future director Sam Peckinpah.  The story lines were just as diverse; a crooked sheriff's reign of terror in a small Kansas town, a bulling professional boxer out for revenge, the problems with Chester's mail-order bride.  Charles Bronson is outstanding as a serial killer who can't be stopped.  How far will Keye Luke go for revenge when two men cut off his queue?  Chuck Connors and James Arness square off in a fist-fight that's not to be missed.  Not all of the stories turn out the way you might think, sometimes the bad-guys just walk away and there are times when you're not sure just who is the bad-guy.  Gunsmoke had an incredibly long run as a top rated TV series and this first season will show you why.  If, like me, you grew up watching the show then this is a great way to revisit Matt, Kitty, Doc and Chester for a reunion and a look back at how it all started.LastRanger",5,An American Tradition.,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1967,"['mid', '1800', 'dusty', 'main-street', 'Dodge', 'City', 'Kansas', 'lawman', 'outlaw', 'face', 'other', 'six-gun', 'duel', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'survive', '1955', 'John', 'Wayne', 'made', 'rare', 'television', 'appearance', 'introduce', 'what', 'was', 'become', 'America', 'defining', 'TV', 'western', 'first', 'season', 'Gunsmoke', 'would', 'break', 'traditional', 'molds', 'squeaky-clean', 'lawman', 'always', 'man', 'Instead', 'what', 'viewers', 'got', 'was', 'gritty', 'sweaty', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Wild', 'West', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'America', 'found', 'tough', 'honest', 'lawman', 'could', 'stand', 'up', 'angry', 'mob', 'yet', 'knew', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'back', 'down', 'greater', 'good', 'stellar', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actors', 'show', 'boasted', 'fine', 'performances', 'James', 'Arness', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'host', 'top', 'name', 'guest', 'stars', 'People', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'make', 'guest', 'appearances', 'many', 'episodes', 'scripts', 'were', 'outstanding', 'ran', 'gamete', 'intense', 'drama', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'several', 'done', 'future', 'director', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'just', 'diverse', 'crooked', 'sheriff', 'reign', 'terror', 'small', 'Kansas', 'town', 'bulling', 'professional', 'boxer', 'revenge', 'problems', 'Chester', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'outstanding', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'stopped', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'go', 'revenge', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'cut', 'off', 'queue', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'James', 'Arness', 'square', 'off', 'fist-fight', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Not', 'stories', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'might', 'think', 'sometimes', 'bad-guys', 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'are', 'times', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'just', 'who', 'bad-guy', 'Gunsmoke', 'had', 'incredibly', 'long', 'run', 'top', 'rated', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'show', 'why', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'then', 'great', 'way', 'revisit', 'Matt', 'Kitty', 'Doc', 'Chester', 'reunion', 'look', 'back', 'how', 'started.LastRanger']",Gunsmoke: Season 1

There is plenty of drinking in it, but even that is nothing compared to what things are today.Chester, Doc, and Ketty are just as important as Matt Dillon.  Though he gets top billing, he wouldn't be anything without his supporting cast!  There are several great episodes in this episode.

For me the hour long episodes sometimes seemed slow and over stretched. One of the joys of the first season is that James Arness gives an opening narration in some of the episodes, as Matt Dillon is seen walking around Boot Hill expressing his thoughts about his job as Marshall. Gunsmoke was not an action led western and this first season offers some thoughtful stories with each episode making good use of it's 25 minute running time. It was described at the time as an adult western which meant it was high on drama and sometimes low on action. But it was one of the first quality TV westerns which offered a wide range of stories instead of the &#34;shoot em up&#34; content of other westerns of the time.

1071315,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B000PHX5KU,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[3, 3]","The television series ran from September 10, 1955 to March 31, 1975 on CBS for 635 episodes. Until 2005, it was the longest run of any scripted primetime series with continuing characters in American primetime television.Conrad was the first choice to play Marshal Dillon on TV, having established the role, but his increasing obesity led to more photogenic actors being considered. Losing the role embittered Conrad for years, though he later starred in another CBS television series, Cannon (1971-1975). Denver Pyle was also considered for the role, as was Raymond Burr who was ultimately seen as too heavyset for the part. According to a James Arness interview, John Wayne was offered the role, but wouldn't do it; Wayne was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, and at that time, working in television was seen as a huge step down in prestige for a star actor.In the end, the primary roles were all recast, with James Arness taking on the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon upon the recommendation of John Wayne, who also introduced the first episode of the series; Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode; Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. Galen ""Doc"" Adams; and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell, owner of the Long Branch Saloon. MacDonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer. Arness, in his role on Gunsmoke, achieved what no other actor at the time had ever matched: he played the same character on the same scripted series for 20 years - at the time the longest uninterrupted period a primetime actor had played the same role in the same show.In 1963, singer/character actor Ken Curtis did a guest role as a shady ladies' man. After Weaver left the series to venture out as the lead in his own TV series, Kentucky Jones, Curtis was added to the show's lineup. He played the stubbornly illiterate Festus Haggen, a character who came to town (in an episode titled ""Us Haggens"") to avenge the death of his twin brother, Fergus Haggen, and another brother, Jeff Haggen, and who decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially existing on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus Haggen was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick to Matt Dillon and was eventually made a deputy. Interestingly, his twin was never again mentioned on the show. In the episode ""Alias Festus Haggen,"" he is mistaken for a robber and killer whom he has to expose to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a comic relief episode (""Mad Dog""), another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. Other actors who played Dillon's deputies for two and a half to three-year stints included Roger Ewing (1966-1968) as Thad Greenwood and Burt Reynolds (1962-1965) as Indian/white Quint Asper. Buck Taylor, who played gunsmith Newly O'Brien from 1967-1975, also served as one of Dillon's deputies.While Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly had a close personal relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002 Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, ""If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with."" The nearest that Matt and Kitty had to a romantic encounter was in a comic episode (""Quiet Day in Dodge""), where Matt, tired from a long day of settling disputes, was about to have dinner with Miss Kitty. However, she was distracted and found poor Matt sound asleep. Kitty ended up storming out of the room, furious. In another episode (""Hostage!"", Season 18, Episode 13, December 11, 1972) Kitty was gravely injured. Matt spent hours at Kitty's side in Doc's office, holding her hand before she stirred and he knew he would not lose her. The Marshal took off his badge to pursue the bad guy as a personal vendetta. When Kitty awoke and Doc told her of Matt's mission she feared for his safety. As Doc reassured her, ""The sun hasn't come up on the day that Matt can't take care of himself,"" Kitty answered, ""I couldn't live without him.""In an episode (""Waste"") featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist ""at the law's discretion"" (meaning the Marshal's).The character Miss Kitty was written out in 1974, when Blake decided not to return for the the show's 20th (and final) season.",5,THE KING OF ALL TV  WESTERNS,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,4468,"['television', 'series', 'ran', 'September', '10', '1955', 'March', '31', '1975', 'CBS', '635', 'episodes',

1071316,ANUJUFRP6RNA2,B000PHX5KU,O'Dryden,"[2, 3]","In my humble opinion, Gunsmoke may very well be the best television show ever created. I don't say this because I am partial to westerns. My assessment is based on the quality of the production, the realism of the show, the acting of the main characters and supporting actors, the locations for shooting the scenes, and finally, the writing of the scripts. In all cases I give Gunsmoke five stars in each category. I have never seen a show on American television that can bring it all together in such perfection. I have always been a big fan of the Gunsmoke radio show because I believed that for its time, it was unsurpassed for quality and realism. I was skeptical that the television version of Gunsmoke could be as great as the radio show but I was proven wrong. The first season of Gunsmoke (1955/1956) did not finish in the top 15 for ratings but by the next season it jumped to number 8 and then by the 1957/1958 season it was the number one show on television for the next 4 seasons. John Wayne was right when he said that James Arness is the only man who could play Matt Dillon. Arness' imposing height of 6 feet 7 inches and his rugged appearance make him the perfect marshal to enforce law and order. The supporting cast of the show provides some great acting as well. Amanda Blake as Miss Kitty and Dennis Waver as Deputy Chester Goode compliment the superb performance of James Arness. The plots are often hard to predict which makes the show even more enjoyable. The dialogue that occurs between the characters is entertaining, realistic, intense, and sometimes humorous in its abruptness. For example, Matt Dillon is trying to determine who shot a prisoner in the jail cell. When he asks the sheriff of a nearby town the sheriff replies, ""I might have done it. Maybe I didn't like the way he looked."" Matt Dillion then knocks the sheriff to the ground with a hard right and says, ""Maybe I don't like the way you answer questions."" Parents be forewarned. This show is very realistic and somewhat brutal at times. There is usually at least one fatality before the show ends. I can't wait for season two to be released.

And in comparison with other TV westerns of the period, this one was very good.  There was something downright comfortable about it.  But there are a few things that I con't quite understand.What exactly was Miss Kitty's source of income?  She wore some pretty fancy low cut gowns.  Was she a ""soiled dove,"" in the parlance of the Old West?  Was she Matt's main squeeze or did she go upstairs with any of the boys who had the price, like Laurie in ""Lonesome Dove?""Why was there never any horse manure in the street?  And how did they keep those streets unrutted with packed sand?How come the town and the Long Branch Saloon didn't look anything like the pictures of Dodge City from the 1800s?  The real Long Branch was a narrow and dark hole of a place.Why doesn't the countryside around Dodge look anything like the topography and flora around the real Dodge City?  The plants we see appear to be more native to California than Kansas.Oh, there are just lots of questions, but these will suffice.  The answers have to do with what viewers and censors would tolerate when this series was made, and with where studios could film.  The Dodge City we see here is an idyllic place, a place of myth, of the imagination, not of reality.

1071325,A1D50XFXDM24A1,B000PHX5KU,Samuel E. Spear,"[26, 27]","CBS-Paramount has finally released the entire first season of ""Gunsmoke"" on DVD.  Speaking as a long-time fan of the series (particularly the heretofore seldom-seen half hour episodes), I couldn't be more pleased with this set.  I unhesitatingly give it five stars and believe that it's a fantastic value for the price.  All 39 first-season episodes are here and all 15 that I've viewed so far look exceptionally good, with crystal clear video and audio.  The back of the box includes a disclaimer ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.""  However, I have yet to spot any instances of missing material and I believe that CBS-Paramount made a genuine good faith effort to include all surviving footage.  All 15 episodes that I've viewed so far ""timed out"" between 26:10 and 26:30.  In addition, fans who already own the previously released DVDs sold by Columbia House will note that footage missing from several episodes on those discs IS included on this set.  They will also notice that the original (and correct) ""Matt on Boot Hill"" introductions have been restored and included with the episodes on this set.  The only very minor flaw I've noticed is that some of the episodes are slightly mislabeled on the individual disc menus.  ""Night Incident"" is labeled as ""Night Visitor"", ""Unmarked Grave"" is labeled as ""Unknown Grave"", and ""The Big Broad"" is labeled as ""Big Broad"".  I would also note that the  only ""extras"" consist of original sponsor spots.  However, I personally found the L & M cigarette ads with James Arness and Milburn Stone to be far more fascinating than the interviews or ""The Making of"" featurettes that are included with most DVDs.  Any fan of ""Gunsmoke"" will be thrilled with this set, and fans who've never seen the half-hour episodes (or those who haven't seen them in a long time), will be especially enthusiastic.

The show didn't last 20 years without capturing the imaginations of a lot of viewers. Back in 1955, CBS thought viewers were ready to see an adult Western - one that was not created and written for kids, but one that intended to tap into the large audiences that were rushing to theaters to see Gary Cooper, James Stewart, John Wayne, and Henry Fonda on the prairie.Casting Wayne protege James Arness as Dodge City, Kansas US Marshal Matt Dillon, Gunsmoke set the stage for all of the great television Westerns that came after it, like Bonanza, The Rifleman, Cheyenne, and others. First, the hero or heroes were stalwart, salt-of-the earth types that resonated humanity and virtuosity, like Arness' Dillon (and also set the stage for very tall leading men like Chuck Connors of The Rifleman and Clint Walker's Cheyenne Bodie). Next, stock the show with a spectacular supporting cast - Milburn Stone as Doc, Amanda Blake as Kitty, and Dennis Weaver as deputy Chester Goode. Add a weekly blend of terrific guest stars, throw in superb writing and directing, and the Western television series had its blueprint. And television had one of its best shows of any genre.",5,Longest Running Episodic American Television Series Finally Makes It To DVD  In A Full Season Package,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,1503,"['waiting', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'being', 'teased', 'three', 'compliation', 'releases', 'Gunsmoke', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'complete', 'season', 'package.By', 'releasing', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'DVD', 'Gunsmoke', 'finally', 'being', 'accorded', 'honor', 'due', 'first', 'given', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'and/or', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', '20', 'years', 'capturing', 'imaginations', 'lot', 'viewers', 'Back', '1955', 'CBS', 'thought', 'viewers', 'were', 'ready', 'see', 'adult', 'Western', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'created', 'written', 'kids', 'one', 'intended', 'tap', 'large', 'audiences', 'were', 'rushing', 'theaters', 'see', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'James', 'Stewart', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'prairie.Casting', 'Wayne', 'protege', 'James', 'Arness', 'Dodge', 'City', 'Kansas', 'US', 'Marshal', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Gunsmoke', 'set', 'stage', 'great', 'television', 'Westerns', 'came', 'Bonanza', 'Rifleman', 'Cheyenne', 'others', 'First', 'hero', 'heroes', 'were', 'stalwart', 'salt-of-the', 'earth', 'types', 'resonated', 'humanity', 'virtuosity', 'Arness', 'Dillon', 'also', 'set', 'stage', 'very', 'tall', 'leading', 'men', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Rifleman', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'Cheyenne', 'Bodie', 'Next', 'stock', 'show', 'spectacular', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'Doc', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'Kitty', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'deputy', 'Chester', 'Goode', 'Add', 'weekly', 'blend', 'terrific', 'guest', 'stars', 'throw', 'superb', 'writing', 'directing', 'Western', 'television', 'series', 'had', 'blueprint', 'television', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'genre']",Gunsmoke: Season 1

I was 5 years old when this first aired. We watched them on the 1st tv my parents ever bought, a Firestone table model that came from the Firestone store in Ft Walton Beach Fla. The reviews posted here before the set's release reminded me of the early introductions with Matt walking through Boot Hill. I hadn't thought abought that in years but it was just like I remembered. I have too many thoughts to share concerning the series but some of the high points or surprizes for me are:-Though the episodes don't seem to have been aired in the same order as filmed, it is interesting seeing the evolution of some of the main characters.-Has anyone else noticed that the 1st episode on Disc 5, ""Hack Prine"", looks different and maybe is the pilot? Check the differences in the exterior and interior shots of Matt's office and the interior of the Long Branch. These are both different from every other episode.-In the episode with Aaron Spelling, ""The Guitar"", a gentleman appears to be the owner of the Long Branch but he is never mentioned again in this season. I thought the owner was never mentioned, at least not before Kitty became the owner. Of course, I'm not an expert on Gunsmoke history.-Enjoyed seeing many of the ususal and not so common guest stars of the day but really enjoyed the bigger surprizes like Dan Blocker as the Army Lt in the last episode of the season and the aforementioned Mr Spelling.-Loved the episode, ""Yorky"", that shows the origin of the buckskin horse Matt rode for so long. Again, because the episodes seemed to have aired in random order, he is not always on the buckskin later in the season.I can't wait for the rest of the half-hour seasons to be released. Now if CBS would just get back to releasing the rest of Have Gun Will Travel all will be right with the world",5,Best ever,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1937,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'set', 'am', 'absolutely', 'heaven', 'chance', 'see', 'again', 'such', 'quality', 'was', '5', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'watched', '1st', 'tv', 'parents', 'ever', 'bought', 'Firestone', 'table', 'model', 'came', 'Firestone', 'store', 'Ft', 'Walton', 'Beach', 'Fla', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'set', 'release', 'reminded', 'early', 'introductions', 'Matt', 'walking', 'Boot', 'Hill', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'abought', 'years', 'was', 'just', 'remembered', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'thoughts', 'share', 'concerning', 'series', 'high', 'points', 'surprizes', 'are', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'aired', 'same', 'order', 'filmed', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'evolution', 'main', 'characters.-Has', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', '1st', 'episode', 'Disc', '5', 'Hack', 'Prine', 'different', 'maybe', 'pilot', 'Check', 'differences', 'exterior', 'interior', 'shots', 'Matt', 'office', 'interior', 'Long', 'Branch', 'are', 'different', 'other', 'episode.-In', 'episode', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'Guitar', 'gentleman', 'be', 'owner', 'Long', 'Branch', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'season', 'thought', 'owner', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned', 'least', 'not', 'Kitty', 'became', 'owner', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'Gunsmoke', 'history.-Enjoyed', 'seeing', 'many', 'ususal', 'not', 'so', 'common', 'guest', 'stars', 'day', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'bigger', 'surprizes', 'Dan', 'Blocker', 'Army', 'Lt', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'aforementioned', 'Mr', 'Spelling.-Loved', 'episode', 'Yorky', 'origin', 'buckskin', 'horse', 'Matt', 'rode', 'so', 'long', 'Again', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'have', 'aired', 'random', 'order', 'not', 'always', 'buckskin', 'later', 'season.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'rest', 'half-hour', 'seasons', 'be', 'released', 'Now', 'CBS', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'back', 'releasing', 'rest', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'world']",Gunsmoke: Season 1
