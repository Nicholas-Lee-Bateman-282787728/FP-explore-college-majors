577232,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B00005ALLV,Amber,"[1, 2]","This is absolutely hilarious! I love it! Everyone in Tokyo is depressed because Kenshin left, and you almost want to cry with them(especially when Ayame and Suzume realize that he is gone). Then, Kenshin meets Makimachi Misao and craziness ensues! The ninja girl is totally hyper, and she never shuts up. But she's really funny, and makes a wide variety of cute faces. She's even cute and funny when she's cussing at Kenshin! Wai!In addition to Misao, Aoshi comes back! He was one of my favorite characters from the first season (and considering that I liked almost everyone but the villains, that's saying a lot). So, he's back, and I can't wait to see what happens when he and Misao (not to mention he and Kenshin) meet up again.The animation is wonderful, and the fights are still majorly cool. Kenshin doesn't get to fight much in this one, but I'm still recovering from his awesome fight with Saito in the last volume, so I didn't feel the loss too much. And I am looking forward to seeing more Misao-action.Like always, the subbed version is magnificent and the English dubbed version needs to be destroyed. I cannot get over how HORRIBLE the English voice actors are!I recommend this to any and every Rurouni Kenshin fan!",5,Way cool quartet of episodes!,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,1228,"['absolutely', 'hilarious', 'love', 'Everyone', 'Tokyo', 'depressed', 'Kenshin', 'left', 'almost', 'want', 'cry', 'especially', 'when', 'Ayame', 'Suzume', 'realize', 'gone', 'Then', 'Kenshin', 'Makimachi', 'Misao', 'craziness', 'ensues', 'ninja', 'girl', 'totally', 'hyper', 'never', 'shuts', 'up', 'really', 'funny', 'wide', 'variety', 'cute', 'even', 'cute', 'funny', 'when', 'cussing', 'Kenshin', 'Wai', 'addition', 'Misao', 'Aoshi', 'back', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'first', 'season', 'considering', 'liked', 'almost', 'everyone', 'villains', 'saying', 'lot', 'So', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'Misao', 'not', 'mention', 'Kenshin', 'meet', 'up', 'again.The', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'fights', 'are', 'still', 'majorly', 'cool', 'Kenshin', ""n't"", 'get', 'fight', 'much', 'one', ""'m"", 'still', 'recovering', 'awesome', 'fight', 'Saito', 'last', 'volume', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'loss', 'too', 'much', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'Misao-action.Like', 'always', 'subbed', 'version', 'magnificent', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'needs', 'be', 'destroyed', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'how', 'HORRIBLE', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'recommend', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'fan']",N/A
577233,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B00005ALLV,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[9, 9]","The first major step into the Kyoto Arc, following the catastrophic arrival of Saitoh, and Kenshin's subsequent abandonment of his gang. He meets his first companion, 16-year-old Misao Makimachi, a member of the Oniwabanshu who has been searching for her friends--the same crew Kenshin obliterated in earlier in the series. Tensions are high as Kenshin knows Shishio could very well strike anywhere at anytime.To recap for newbies, the Rurouni Kenshin series follows Himura Kenshin, once the most feared Hitokiri or assassin of the Bakumatsu, a violent era in feudal Japan where power was up for grabs. He has and continues to wander Japan keeping his vow not to kill and fighting with a reverse-edged sword.This is the first dark step in the series as the chance upon the bloodied corpse of a man, his unconscious younger brother in his arms. Kenshin, Saito and Misao get to confront Shishio, but only get to fight the beast left in the village, a tights-clad, axe-knuckles-wearing hulk named Senkaku. We are also first introduced to Shishio's right hand man, and perhaps the most dangerous of his Ten Swords, Soujiro.This is a complete emotional volume from a complete series. The light-hearted moments in the beginning are tempered by the serious and heartbreaking scenes in the middle; the tension is on a constant high throughout all the episodes featured here. Kenshin's urge to return to his darker, killing side doesn't quite surface yet, but the young, talented Soujiro, will create a tremendous obstacle during their first swordfight.Highly recommended and necessary for Kenshin fans; there's also enough of flashbacks and information for you to view this DVD on its own, and have some, but not a complete idea, of what is going on.

But having to watch Ice Blue Eyes after what Shadow of the Wolf was like... i mean seriously... here we have Kenshin entering his Revolution days... a repeat of the Kurogassa event, and then he leaves, a big dramatic moment, ok lets shed a few tears... (sob... sob)  Alright now for a slap in the face with the Japanese and their habit of Alternating Serious with the Commical...  Well this time was it SuperSerious and dramatic Shadow of the Wolf against he willy-nilly and slap stick silly, almost annoying Ice Blue eyes.  They made eachother more of an extreme in their own catagories just by being back to back.  Ok... every Kenshin is worth seeing and if you are a Kenshin fan then yes, do get this.  But i'm just giving you fair warning, do not end your night with it.  Continue on or stop just before it... it'll ruin the end.

They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.Kenshin has left for the fight in Kyoto. He meets a girl named Misao. She has a connection to Shinomori. Realizing that Kenshin is the last person that saw him, she tags along hooping Aoshi will show up. Kaoru and Sano also decide to follow Kenshin and do what they can to help him.Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative.
