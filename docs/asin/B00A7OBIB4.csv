1606404,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B00A7OBIB4,Compay,"[6, 7]","Abducted is about what you would expect for a movie made for TV.  The film was first broadcast on Lifetime as ""Layover"", but the name was updated apparently so that the DVD might appeal to a broader audience. The DVD cover features a member of the cast (Tara Erica Moore), but it in no way reflects any parts of this movie. For the most part, Abducted is a cross between ""Taken"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada.""Abducted follows the story of a pampered executive of a luxury hotel chain who constantly mistreats her personal assistant. After her plane trip is diverted by bad weather, the mean-spirited exec ends up at a cheap hotel in Detroit. She becomes tangled up with Russian sex traffickers, and it's up to her assistant, her security chief, and the FBI to save her.The good news about Abducted is that it's actually shot fairly well by a first time director, with good lighting and color correction.  Which is a surprise considering this was a film by Asylum, responsible for such past gems as ""Snakes on a Train"", ""Transmorphers"", and ""Titanic II"" (I'm not making this up). Film veteran Lauren Holly does a decent job as the snarky executive, and most comments from women I've read seem to be excited by Joe Lando being cast as the exec's security chief.The bad news about Abducted is that it isn't any different from most low-budget movies that go straight to DVD. The story isn't very memorable, most of the acting is average at best, and a great deal of what happens in the movie is laughably unrealistic (the clues about the abductor's hideout in particular).As a Lifetime Network movie, Abducted is noticeably geared towards a woman audience, but I think guys like myself could still enjoy. Amazon doesn't list the rating, it's TV-14 for violence (no nudity, occasional b-word). Overall, it was shot better than I would expect, but it's still not remotely what you would expect to see in theaters. It's solidly average, yet worth watching once. Just don't expect a fast-paced or very memorable hostage flick.",3,Okay for Made-for-TV Movie but DVD Cover is Misleading,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2016,"['Abducted', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'Lifetime', 'Layover', 'name', 'was', 'updated', 'apparently', 'so', 'DVD', 'might', 'appeal', 'broader', 'audience', 'DVD', 'cover', 'member', 'cast', 'Tara', 'Erica', 'Moore', 'way', 'parts', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'Abducted', 'cross', 'Taken', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Abducted', 'story', 'pampered', 'executive', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'chain', 'who', 'constantly', 'personal', 'assistant', 'plane', 'trip', 'diverted', 'bad', 'weather', 'mean-spirited', 'exec', 'up', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'Detroit', 'tangled', 'up', 'Russian', 'sex', 'traffickers', 'up', 'assistant', 'security', 'chief', 'FBI', 'save', 'her.The', 'good', 'news', 'Abducted', 'actually', 'shot', 'fairly', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'good', 'lighting', 'color', 'correction', 'Which', 'surprise', 'considering', 'was', 'film', 'Asylum', 'responsible', 'such', 'past', 'gems', 'Snakes', 'Train', 'Transmorphers', 'Titanic', 'II', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up', 'Film', 'veteran', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'decent', 'job', 'snarky', 'executive', 'most', 'comments', 'women', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seem', 'be', 'excited', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'being', 'cast', 'exec', 'security', 'chief.The', 'bad', 'news', 'Abducted', ""n't"", 'different', 'most', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'go', 'straight', 'DVD', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'most', 'acting', 'average', 'best', 'great', 'deal', 'what', 'movie', 'laughably', 'unrealistic', 'clues', 'abductor', 'hideout', 'particular', 'Lifetime', 'Network', 'movie', 'Abducted', 'noticeably', 'geared', 'towards', 'woman', 'audience', 'think', 'guys', 'could', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'list', 'rating', 'TV-14', 'violence', 'nudity', 'occasional', 'b-word', 'Overall', 'was', 'shot', 'better', 'would', 'expect', 'still', 'not', 'remotely', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'theaters', 'solidly', 'average', 'yet', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fast-paced', 'very', 'memorable', 'hostage', 'flick']",Abducted

I thought it was a bit choppy in sections but it wasn't a total mess like some television movies can be. I mostly turned in because Joe Lando was in it. But I decided to purchase the DVD,even though the name was changed and the front cover picture has nothing to do with the plot.  I have to say I am glad I bought the DVD. The chopped out scenes were added back and it made the movie flow and more interesting to me. Things about the kidnapping and character attitudes in places were made to fit more easily.

1606409,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00A7OBIB4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 3]","This one had me scratching my head. It is an Asylum film, but didn't have the usual screw ups. It seemed like a Lifetime film then I found out this was a made for TV movie called ""Layover."" However using a picture of a pretty girl in a cage and calling it ""Abduction"" appeals to my perv factor, and that is what makes money.Suzanne Hollingsworth (Lauren Holly) is a rich luxury hotel owner is forced to stay in Detroit, a city she loathes. She happens to be in a room next to the proverbial Russian sex traders who abduct her. Rebecca (Kaylee DeFer), Suzanne's thrice fired kickboxing assistant springs into action. Add a few more girls to the mix, water down the story for TV, apply the abduction formula and presto you have a mediocre film where Lauren Holly visibly struggles with the poorly written role.Could we add a gay gut to this too? They are so in vogue. Maybe we could trash Detroit some more too. In a good way, it is better than most of Asylum films, but then that is not why we watch them.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Rated TV-14 for topical material. They could have at least had one of the girls in a cheerleader outfit. What did I do with my D.E.B.S.
