The two stars have great chemistry, I have seen this film so many times and it is still a treat after all these years. Directed by Ron Howard, Splash continues to entertain even though the premise is far-fetched, definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the '80s.

You see, it really has it all: funny jokes, tender moments, romance, an intelligent script, and a very charismatic cast.In &quot;Splash&quot; we can see a very young Tom Hanks (in his comedic period), a promising Darryl Hannah (she didn't quite reach stardom, but in this movie she is great), a hilarious John Candy (in one of his finest and funniest performances), and Eugene Levy, he plays a wacky and clueless scientist.&quot;Splash&quot; is a movie that effectively combines comedy with romance and fantasy, perhaps the movie succeeded so well because the people involved in the film were youthful and energetic, and they put their hearts in the making of &quot;Splash&quot;.

I must've seen it at least 10 times on cable and as many times on DVD and it never gets boring. This is Tom Hanks first big movie and I believe it was there all Hannah's first big movie as well. As I said it's a fun movie to watch not just for Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah but also the supporting cast and the story as well. Not to mention this is a great movie from Ron Howard and his company. Overall I would give splash in 8.5 out of 10. It's something you'll remember and make sure you stay till the end there's about 4 or 5 seconds that are worth watching. I won't ruin the surprise but it's worth watching till the start of the credits. So enjoy splash and have a great day.

It didn't hurt the careers of Daryl Hannah, John Candy, or Ron Howard, either. Allen Bauer (Hanks) is on the rebound when a mermaid (Hannah) comes to New York looking for him. She saved him from drowning twice, although his memories of being saved are a bit hazy. He falls in love with her, of course, without realizing exactly what he's in for, because her tail changes into legs when dry. Add in Allen's playboy brother (Candy) and a zany scientist seeking to prove the existence of mermaids, and you have all the necessary ingredients for a very funny movie.My problem was how to rate this movie. I don't really consider it to be quite a classic like &quot;Tootsie&quot;, &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; or some of the others I have rated 5 star comedies here. On the other hand, it is a personal favorite, I own a copy, and I have enjoyed watching it many times. So consider it about a 4 3/4 star movie (I rounded off).

240222,A2OLW9CB7K11A2,6300275213,"B. Mah ""Bill""","[5, 7]","This is an excellent romantic comedy about a man and a mermaid who fall in love for each other in a modern fairy tale. This film was one of Tom Hanks' earliest hits that made him the huge superstar that he is today. Co-star Daryl Hannah, who plays Madison the mermaid, became herself a huge star from this film, but now times have changed in her film career, which has faded during the 1990s, which is sad. She is a great actress.John Candy plays Tom Hanks' older brother with Eugene Levy playing a crazy scientist who tries to prove that mermaids exist. These two provide some of the film's hilarious comedic moments.The romantic chemistry between Hanks' Allen Bauer and Hannah's  Madison are just well done. Their characters' relationship just becomes true romance throughout the entire film. When Madison eventually gets caught as her mermaid fish body, Allen realizes that Madison is the one true love that he can never lose. Allen, along with his brother and the crazy scientist, band together to rescue her. Later, Allen realizes that Madison was the little girl mermaid that rescued him when he was a young boy in the film's opening flashback sequence. Madison and Allen were fated to be with each other!Splash was directed by Ron Howard, who is, of course, one of Hollywood's great filmmakers. A movie about a mermaid has to be good, and Splash does this so well. Tips off to the crew of this movie who made it so real. The underwater sequences are well done, as well as Daryl Hannah herself as the mermaid. She is just utterly believable as a mermaid! I must say that she is just so sexy in the rubber mermaid tail suit. She swims in it so well! I really thought that she played Madison to perfection!This movie really brought a fairy tale type story to life. A must see for everyone. I guess this film obviously makes for a great date movie.On one other note, most people probably don't know this, but Splash was followed up by a Disney TV movie sequel in 1988 that aired in two parts on the ABC network on what used to be  a show called &quot;The Disney Sunday Movie&quot;. The sequel was called Splash, Too and starred Todd Waring as Allen Bauer and Amy Yasbeck (movies &quot;Problem Child&quot; 1 and 2, &quot;The Mask&quot;, and TV's &quot;Wings&quot;) as Madison Bauer, now married from a Neptune ceremony. This sequel has Allen and Madsion come back to New York from their island hideaway to help Allen's brother Freddie (played by Donovan Scott) save Bauer Produce from going out of business. Madison has her own agenda later on as she finds a dolphin she knows from her past, named Salti, captured by another crazy scientist for study.Not a great sequel of course (as sequels usually are) but it was sort of nice to know that Allen and Madison had another adventure. There were some funny moments in the movie. It was  particularly challenging to see Madison cope with suburban life and trying to understand how to be a housewife. I wasn't bothered that much with the recasting of new actors as these characters either. I did like Amy Yasbeck's portrayal of Madison in this sequel.

To this date, I still can't resist watching Splash, which is why I own both the video and DVD.  This romantic fantasy starring Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah is my all-time favorite movie.  The story begins when Allen was a little boy.  He saw a young mermaid when he jumped off a Cape Cod ferry and has been fascinated with fish ever since.  Twenty years later, he meets a beautiful stranger on the same Cape Cod beach.  She follows him to New York and they have a wonderful time.  She does not tell him that she is a mermaid -- the same mermaid he saw when he was a kid -- and tells him that she cannot stay with him longer than six days.  What follows is a sweet and funny love story with timeless quality.Darryl Hannah's portrayal of Madison (named after Madison Avenue) is kind of subdued at times, but she is quite funny in various scenes, especially the scenes where she blows off the TVs and devours a lobster with ths skin and shell still on.  She and Tom Hanks had great chemistry and I loved their romantic scenes.  The ones that keep the comedy great are Tom Hanks, John Candy and Eugene Levy.  I loved the scenes with Hanks and Candy.  They had excellent comic timing.  A lot of scenes are fat-fetched, especially the one where Madison learns the entire English language by watching six hours of television at Bloomingdale's, but the film threw reality out the window with the whole mermaid thing, so reality is not an issue here.  Most films aren't realistic anyway.  The ending is absolutely beautiful.  It still touches me when I watch it.  I recommend this DVD.  It has bonus features that you won't want to miss!

240245,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,6300275213,drqshadow,"[0, 0]","Tom Hanks breaks out in this light, charming, modestly funny fish-out-of-water comedy (har har) about a man's lifelong encounters with a lustily enamored mermaid. It can be tremendously naive at times, and the plot is about as telegraphed as they come, but there's something intangible about this picture that manages to gloss over many of those shortcomings. The central performance of Hanks is key, working as the plucky everyman he'd embody in most of his early repertoire, though this time it's dosed with a few fits of sharply possessive, unsettling anger. Maybe those shades just look bad in retrospect, as the film's a full generation old now, but it's tough not to cringe at such puzzling spots in the modern climate. I think the humor falls into a similar trap, in that it was probably more relevant at the time than it is today. A handful of comedies from the same era still serve as timeless examples of great humor (Ghostbusters, also released in 1984, springs to mind), and though a few of its gags and one-liners still connect, Splash isn't even in that ballpark after thirty years on the shelf.

240249,A146D2LYLICNLS,6300275213,eric_f,"[3, 4]","""Splash"" is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then. I actually saw this movie when it was first released, which is rare for me since I was only a kid back in the 80's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days. I first bought it on VHS, eventually upgraded to the bare-bones DVD, and now have upgraded yet again to this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD. I just can't get enough of this movie.Both Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah have excellent chemistry together and make a great screen couple. What's also believable in this movie is Daryl Hannah's mermaid costume, which looks so authentic that one almost believes she's really a mermaid. And let's not forget the movie's ending, which is absolutely perfect. There's one thing about this movie that I've never understood though: how did it ever manage to escape a PG-13 rating? In the scene where Daryl Hannah arrives at the Statue of Liberty buck naked we get to see quite a substantial (and may I add, very nice) shot of her buns. Definitely not material for a PG rated movie. In any event, I guess that will always be a mystery.All in all, ""Splash"" is a true classic film that never gets old no matter how many times one sees it. Everyone is great to watch, including hilarious supporting roles by the late John Candy (R.I.P.) and Eugene Levy.

It still has me laughing out loud and makes me want to weep over the romantic scenes.A young Tom Hanks plays Allen Bauer, a fruit wholesaler who has just been dumped by his girlfriend. He goes off to Cape Cod one evening after getting drunk and is rescued by a naked beautiful girl (Daryl Hannah) when he falls into the sea. The naked beautiful girl later arrives in New York at the Statue of Liberty in search of Allen whom  she also saved from drowning many years ago when they were children. Allen immediately falls for her and spends the happiest days of his life steaming up his appartment and seeing the sights of New York. The only problem is the naked beautiful girl (now named Madison) is in fact a mermaid but Allen doesn't know this.She has six whole days to stay with Allen and then she must return to the sea. Allen thinks that Madison is an illegal immigrant and offers to marry her so that she can stay with him. She refuses at first and then accepts his offer but before she can tell him her big secret she is exposed to the whole world by a scientist (Eugene Levy) that she is a mermaid. Allen is shocked and backs away from Madison but later realises his mistake and with his brother (John Candy) and the help of Eugene Levy they save her from imprisonment by the scientists.John Candy who plays Allen's playboy brother is absolutely hilarious. His character is literally larger than life. The comic timing between Tom Hanks and John Candy is spot on. Daryl Hannah is also great as the mermaid who learns to be human in literally a few days. There are some brilliant laugh out loud scenes such as when Daryl Hannah is at Bloomingdales watching television for 6 hours to educate herself in the English language and when she's in a restaurant eating lobster including the shell. There are some great lines aswell such as when Allen mentions about getting married and having children and Madison innocently asks what kind.Splash is a timeless comedy and is highly recommended to all those who love a bit of romance along with a good laugh.Lealing",5,Hilarious romantic comedy,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,2193,"['just', 'watched', 'Splash', 'weekend', 'video', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'comedies', 'still', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'want', 'weep', 'romantic', 'scenes.A', 'young', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Allen', 'Bauer', 'fruit', 'wholesaler', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'one', 'evening', 'getting', 'drunk', 'rescued', 'naked', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'when', 'sea', 'naked', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'later', 'arrives', 'New', 'York', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'search', 'Allen', 'whom', 'also', 'saved', 'drowning', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'Allen', 'immediately', 'happiest', 'days', 'life', 'steaming', 'up', 'appartment', 'seeing', 'sights', 'New', 'York', 'only', 'problem', 'naked', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'now', 'named', 'Madison', 'fact', 'mermaid', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'know', 'this.She', 'six', 'whole', 'days', 'stay', 'Allen', 'then', 'must', 'return', 'sea', 'Allen', 'Madison', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'marry', 'can', 'stay', 'first', 'then', 'accepts', 'offer', 'can', 'tell', 'big', 'secret', 'exposed', 'whole', 'world', 'scientist', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'mermaid', 'Allen', 'shocked', 'away', 'Madison', 'later', 'mistake', 'brother', 'John', 'Candy', 'help', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'save', 'imprisonment', 'scientists.John', 'Candy', 'who', 'Allen', 'playboy', 'brother', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'character', 'literally', 'larger', 'life', 'comic', 'timing', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'John', 'Candy', 'spot', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'also', 'great', 'mermaid', 'who', 'be', 'human', 'literally', 'few', 'days', 'are', 'brilliant', 'laugh', 'loud', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Bloomingdales', 'watching', 'television', '6', 'hours', 'educate', 'English', 'language', 'when', 'restaurant', 'eating', 'lobster', 'including', 'shell', 'are', 'great', 'lines', 'aswell', 'such', 'when', 'Allen', 'mentions', 'getting', 'married', 'having', 'children', 'Madison', 'innocently', 'what', 'kind.Splash', 'timeless', 'comedy', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'love', 'bit', 'romance', 'good', 'laugh.Lealing']",N/A

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[35, 39]","Tom Hanks had done a couple of TV shows and the producers of ""Splash"" really wanted a bigger name actor in their movie.  Daryl Hannah had made a favorable impression in a bit part in ""Blade Runner"" but the big ""name"" in the announced cast of Splash was John Candy, who was probably paid as much as the rest of the cast combined in the role of brother Freddy.It would have been very easy for the movie to become a broad farce with Candy and Eugene Levy in the love story of the man and the mermaid, but writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel found the right note between love story and comedy, and the cast pulls off both.  The comedy varies between clever and slapstick, and seeing the film again 20 years later still made me laugh at parts.  As expected, Candy and Levy do the heavy lifting in the comedy department, and they are both hilarious in their respective scenes.  The whole movie wouldn't work at all, though, if we didn't believe in the central love story - and Hanks and Hannah make it work.Hannah is a mermaid apparently not unlike Disney's Ariel.  She has a tail when wet, and legs when dry.  Hanks is Allen Bauer, who has inherited his father's wholesale produce business along with brother Freddy.  As a child Allen suddenly jumped into the water off Cape Cod, where the child mermaid rescues him until the adults can fetch him from the water.As an adult Allen has commitment issues and admits he doesn't love his girlfriend.  After a friend's wedding he returns to Cape Cod for a little nostalgia.  Another boating accident results in another mermaid rescue, but the ""girl"" runs away as Allen regains consciousness on shore.The mermaid fetches Allen's wallet from the ocean floor and follows a map to track Allen down in New York City.  She climbs onto dry land at the statue of liberty - lacking a tail and clothes - and is taken into custody by the police.  They call the guy who owns the wallet she's carrying.  (The mermaid, of course, can't speak English...)So Allen and the Mermaid are united again, where the attraction is powerful and mutual.  The Mermaid learns English watching television for an afternoon (this makes the rest of the movie easier!) and she decides to make her American name ""Madison"" while looking at a street sign for Madison Avenue.  (Many Americans subsequently chose ""Madison"" for their daughters after this movie.)Allen only knows Madison is ""foreign"".  Madison's time on land is limited.  (For reasons that aren't exposed in the film.) Levy portrays a renegade pseudo-scientist who has been searching for a mermaid his entire career.  When one swims past while he's diving at Cape Cod he is startled.  Then he sees a newspaper photo of a nude girl at the Statue of Liberty that looks a lot like the mermaid...The plot isn't difficult to guess, but the performances are full of funny and touching flourishes that make you laugh and care about these characters.  This isn't really a 5-star movie - but I couldn't choose 4 1/2.

240288,A228JH8V9Y700G,6300275213,MortensOrchid,"[5, 6]","This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  I thought Daryl Hannah was the prettiest thing on earth and I wanted to be just like her.  I used to swim in pools with my feet together and pretend I was a mermaid in the hopes that I could talk to marine life, sun myself on rocks, and be the object of mystery and myth.  Seeing it again just recently with the commentary made it a new and wonderful experience all over again.Tom Hanks, an unknown, in Ron Howard's directorial debut, plays Alan, a happless, somewhat bumbling EveryMan who was rescued by a mermaid as a child.  He jumped off a boat in Cape Cod, and met the mermaid (later named Madison) underwater.  Years later, she once again rescues him from drowning, and comes to New York City in search of him.  As he and Darryl Hannah were unknowns, most of the heavy comedy routines were preformed by John Candy and Eugene Levy, who pay off everytime.  Part of the hilarious and sweet nature of this movie is Madison's innocence in the meanest city in America, New York.  Turning up naked at the Statue of Liberty and smiling so innocently at the crowd is just one of the hilarious scenes.  Watching it again with the commetary is a wonderful experience, as they tell tales of near mishaps, story outline, and how they did the special effects (the mermaid tale).  And even today, everytime I hear that a couple has named their new baby Madison, I remember that the name became so popular because of this movie.This was made in an age where there was an E.T. formula for a lot of movies.  In that the lead (Tom Hanks) takes on a poor, helpless creature and tries to introduce said helpless creature into their world.  Eventually, like in E.T., an evil government force takes the helpless creature from the lead and they suffer.  The lead rescues the helpless creature from the clutches of the evil government force, and releases them to their natural habitat.  Unlike E.T., however, the lead goes with the creature.  Perhaps because E.T. was a movie staring children characters and Splash was a movie with adult characters, but Ron Howard reveiled in their commentary that in the original ending Alan didn't go with Madison to the sea.  But, his wife and others insisted to him that he had to change it and go with her.Something that really hit home with me was something that John Candy said about love in this movie.  Tom says to him that he was angry and disappointed that the woman he loved more than anything was a fish.  People fall in love everyday, and look what he got!  John Candy says ""Oh yeah, look what you got! People fall in love everyday?! Most people will never be that happy! I'll never be that happy!"".  And that is certainly true.  People throw things away.  People make mistakes.  And, the world's full of lonely people.  Things don't always work out the way you want them to, especially with love.  So what if the woman's a fish?  Tom was pretty annoying too and she accepted him for what he was.  Too bad some people don't feel the same way.Enjoy it.

When I got home I had a--baffling to my parents--need to take a bath where I began the tests to see if I too was a mermaid.  I could smile underwater. I could hold my breath for a long time, and I had really long hair.  But as long as I stayed in the water...no fins.  Well this was obviously because I was not in sea water.  It was good that we were going to visit my grandparents in Florida soon.Well vacation time came, and we were obliged to take the mandatory day at the beach trip.  I was nervous about my new underwater life to come.  I vowed not to shed tears when I told my family that I was leaving them to find my mermaid family under the sea.  My after transformation goodbye speech was prepared and I was going to be sure to tell them that it was awfully kind of them to watch me for my mermaid family but that it was time for me to go home.  I gave them a hug and headed for the water.The transformation didn't occur right away so I waded deeper and deeper.  I waited and waited.  Kept myself deep underwater, held my breath (I tried to breathe but choked) for as long as possible.  Still nothing.  Then it occured that I was wearing a swim suit and that was impeding my transformation.  So off it went.Hence the most embarrasing moment of my life.  Being caught naked at an emotionally fragile time.Oh well, just see this movie, you won't regret it.  It doesn't age.  I miss John Candy.  The twin towers also get a few picture frames.

John Candy costars as Tom's blithering idiot brother, whose one desire is to see his name published in Penthouse magazine. Ah, ambition! How does it all end? With anyone other than director, Ron Howard, it might have been superficial tripe.
