(His character is based loosely on Lester Young and Bud Powell, but mainly it is all Dexter.) A young Frenchman (Francois Cluzet) idolizes him and later befriends him. Dex has problems, mainly booze, and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink. The cliche of the self-tortured jazz musician who's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is, of course, the main focus of the film. (That this is the ONLY way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform. But it sells.) Dex gets homesick for New York, returns, falls into his old habits, misses the flight back to Paris, and soon dies. The movie is overly long, but Gordon is mesmerizing. Dexter speaks slowly, as if from behind a veil (Gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in Mexico when he agreed to do the movie); he had much input on the film, creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy. The picture has faults, to be sure, but it's a mighty achievement nonetheless.

Somewhere beyond the fields and seas lies a little street in Paris.

More than that the film touches on many topics dealing with alcohol addiction, and the love that one gives another. One would say that the big theme in this film is about one man being the bruised and beaten saved by a savior. What is Jazz? What does it mean?

He befriends a young Frenchman who tries to help him but ultimately such friends will always be the givers in a relationship with a jazz artist.  There is dialogue in this movie that is always the first thing I remember about it.  Gordon's character wonders why people always expect that by escaping to somewhere else, that they will find a new life.  &quot;But you're still yourself when you land there,&quot; he adds, &quot;You'd have to be a different person inside if you wanted to escape into a new life.&quot;  These are prophetic words because although race-blind Paris will offer yet another jazz opportunity to this American black musician, he will never escape from himself. He ultimately sees a French psychiatrist when he can't stay away from booze and drugs.  &quot;I can't turn off the music in my head,&quot; he says, &quot;It is always playing.&quot;  Perhaps no truer words have ever been spoken by an artist because even those with smaller gifts in the fine arts see images or hear music in their heads.  They might be able to turn it off at times but a huge talent won't be able to do so.  As they say, there is no free lunch.

237198,A315K47GRB024C,6300271145,Daniel C. Markel,"[11, 11]","This review is for the 2001 Warner Brothers DVD.It's 1959 in Paris with jazz saxophonist Dale Turner (Dexter Gordon) playing in the Blue Note Club.  His stage presence seems sedated as he sits rather than stands and holds the sax rigidly through most of set, but his music is mesmerizing.  His biggest fan, Francis Borler (Franois Cluzet) isn't inside the club, but outside in the rain, listening to every note as though his life depended on it.  As a struggling graphic artist, Francis doesn't have enough money to be inside the club, but one night after Turner leaves the Blue Note, he bumps into Francis and asks the Frenchman if he'll buy him a beer and Francis gladly accommodates Turner even though it will probably cost him all the money he has to his name.Later it becomes clear that Turner has a drinking problem and all his close friends including his landlady try to isolate him from alcohol.  The film moves on with more great sessions inside the club, but one night Dale is picked up for public intoxication and from that point on Francis takes on the role as Dale's personal caretaker and even cajoles Turner into moving in with him and his young daughter into their small apartment.  The close-knit friendship continues with Turner being clean and sober.  Near the end of the film, Turner goes to back to America with Francis tagging along but Francis' visit is short lived as he decides to return to France.The movie is the best jazz film I've seen, and it works magic because the main character is a real professional jazz musician and not an actor and the music is live and not piped in.  Having the movie take place in this small lounge in Paris, adds international appeal, warmth and a very personal connection to this brilliant art form.  As wonderful as the movie is, too much time was devoted to Borler's obsessive relationship with Turner.  This could have been the quintessential jazz film if it had focused more on Turner's relationship with other musicians with more discussions about the mechanics of the music.  By far, the best off-stage scene in the movie is when Turner has dinner with an attractive female singer whose been a longtime friend and she reminds Dale in a voice of gratitude, ""You were the one that taught me to listen to the bass and not the drums"" and Turner quickly replies back, ""You would have figured it out in 10 or 15 years anyway"".  The other thing that makes this film so special is the intimacy of the nightclub in a time when jazz musicians seemed far more accessible.  The final scene of the movie is many years later on a large stage of an amphitheater which is commonplace for today's jazz concerts and gives older jazz fans a longing for that golden age of bebop in those small clubs with special musicians who played like Dale Turner.  This is a must-have DVD for any serious jazz fan.The DVD presentation is does the film justice.  The color widescreen presentation is immaculate and most importantly the stereo soundtrack sounds fantastic.Movie: A-DVD Quality: A",5,An authentic showcase of bebop jazz in a perfect setting.,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,3026,"['review', '2001', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'DVD.It', '1959', 'Paris', 'jazz', 'saxophonist', 'Dale', 'Turner', 'Dexter', 'Gordon', 'playing', 'Blue', 'Note', 'Club', 'stage', 'presence', 'sedated', 'rather', 'stands', 'sax', 'rigidly', 'most', 'set', 'music', 'mesmerizing', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Francis', 'Borler', 'Franois', 'Cluzet', ""n't"", 'club', 'rain', 'listening', 'note', 'life', 'depended', 'struggling', 'graphic', 'artist', 'Francis', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'be', 'club', 'one', 'night', 'Turner', 'Blue', 'Note', 'Francis', 'Frenchman', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'beer', 'Francis', 'gladly', 'Turner', 'even', 'will', 'probably', 'cost', 'money', 'name.Later', 'clear', 'Turner', 'drinking', 'problem', 'close', 'friends', 'including', 'landlady', 'try', 'isolate', 'alcohol', 'film', 'moves', 'more', 'great', 'sessions', 'club', 'one', 'night', 'Dale', 'picked', 'up', 'public', 'intoxication', 'point', 'Francis', 'role', 'Dale', 'personal', 'caretaker', 'even', 'cajoles', 'Turner', 'moving', 'young', 'daughter', 'small', 'apartment', 'close-knit', 'friendship', 'Turner', 'being', 'clean', 'sober', 'end', 'film', 'Turner', 'back', 'America', 'Francis', 'tagging', 'along', 'Francis', 'visit', 'short', 'lived', 'return', 'France.The', 'movie', 'best', 'jazz', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'magic', 'main', 'character', 'real', 'professional', 'jazz', 'musician', 'not', 'actor', 'music', 'live', 'not', 'piped', 'Having', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'small', 'lounge', 'Paris', 'international', 'appeal', 'warmth', 'very', 'personal', 'connection', 'brilliant', 'art', 'form', 'As', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'Borler', 'obsessive', 'relationship', 'Turner', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quintessential', 'jazz', 'film', 'had', 'focused', 'more', 'Turner', 'relationship', 'other', 'musicians', 'more', 'discussions', 'mechanics', 'music', 'far', 'best', 'off-stage', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Turner', 'dinner', 'attractive', 'female', 'singer', 'been', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Dale', 'voice', 'gratitude', 'were', 'one', 'taught', 'listen', 'bass', 'not', 'drums', 'Turner', 'quickly', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'figured', '10', '15', 'years', 'anyway', 'other', 'thing', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'intimacy', 'nightclub', 'time', 'when', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'seemed', 'far', 'more', 'accessible', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'large', 'stage', 'amphitheater', 'commonplace', 'today', 'jazz', 'concerts', 'older', 'jazz', 'fans', 'longing', 'golden', 'age', 'bebop', 'small', 'clubs', 'special', 'musicians', 'who', 'played', 'Dale', 'Turner', 'must-have', 'DVD', 'serious', 'jazz', 'fan.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'film', 'justice', 'color', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'immaculate', 'most', 'importantly', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'fantastic.Movie', 'A-DVD', 'Quality']",N/A

Everything was flawless.Dexter Gordon's performance was breathtaking. Here is everything every jazz musician faces, every demon that must be conqured.The music is a world in itself. The masters themselves playing their own music.The Francois character had his own demons too. He abandoned his wife, and nearly abandoned his daughter, to chase his own muse that came to him in the form of the music and the people who played it.

237201,A3MSUAN2IXUC7G,6300271145,Denis L. Baggi,"[12, 12]","I state unequivocally that this is the greatest movie on Jazz ever made. It has the depth of that music and illustrates the internal drama of an artist, and thus succeeds far better than other attempts (such as  &quot;Bird&quot; by Clint Eastwood, even &quot;Mo' Better Blues&quot; by  Spike Lee). Perhaps that's because Tavernier, instead of applying  pre-conceived (if not racist) ideas on the music and the musicians, just  let Dexter Gordon talk freely about what he knows, jazz music. Perhaps it's  because, at least in respect to jazz, Europeans have been in the past more  respectful and have consistently applied the highest musicological criteria  and critical metholodology.The plot is patterned on a true story, the  friendshpid between the French jazz lover Francis Paudras and Bud Powell -  perhaps the greatest pianist of the 40's - who suffered from artistic and  personal lapses and was living in Paris. There are also some aspects of  saxophonist Dale Turner (Dexter Gordon) borrowed from the tragic destiny of  Lester Young, who died in New York at the age of 49.The recreation of  the &quot;Blue Note&quot;, a jazz club in Paris, is great, and some of the  ancient ones (Pierre Michelot, a bass player who was member of the rhythm  section with Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke) can be seen and heard. Also the  scenes in New York, e.g. the hotel on Times Square (Lester for instance  spent years at a window of a room like that drinking gin) are above  criticism.The only criticism is with some scenes that have little  relevance: Francis' invitation of the jazzman to his parents' place in Lyon  (Tavernier's home town), and their excursion on a beach in Northern France.  This is perhaps a fantasy of the movie director, some interjection of his  own life in something that has to do with jazz, a weakness that ought to be  forgiven.Therefore this is a great movie for jazz lovers, as well as an  accurate rendition that music for the general public, especially that which  does not suspect its depth. As Dexter says, Monet, etc., it's all be bop.  Yes, I have been with a woman, he answers the shrink, and he caresses his  woman, his tenor sax. Touchy moments in the development of that friendship.

Dexter Gordon, a real (and real good) jazz-musician-turned-actor stars as Dale Turner, an alcoholic saxophone player who moves to Paris and rediscovers his music and life. His world-weary voice and vibrant music talent help him to carry the role, deemed good enough to have been nominated for an Academy Award. Herbie Hancock wrote the music, obtaining a sound track that is sprinkled with Hancockian licks and solid jazz classics, apparently performed by a number of famous jazz musicians, such as Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson and Pierre Michelot. With their support and the convenience of having a number of hit tunes to use in the sound track, it's no wonder Herbie won the Academy Award for best score for this movie. It's wonderful. Where the movie disappoints, though, is in the story, which is convoluted and unconvincing. It is supposedly based on things that happened to Bud Powell and Lester Young, but because it is not a biopic of either one of those guys, it ends up being about nobody. The frenchman who befriends Dexter Gordon's character is just not believable, especially when he says things like ""Your music changed my life"" to a fictional guy who doesn't play an original tune in the entire movie. I can't get wrapped up in somebody's life when I don't know who they are, and while some attempt is made to sway the audience to care about these forlorn characters, ultimately, the audience is left feeling detached and empty. For a peek into the world of 1960's jazz, though, the movie is adequate, and the sound track is first rate and pretty much worth the price of admission.

He is regenerated by a fan of his, a French graphic artist who takes him to his home, and his young daughter and integrates him in his family. Dale promises to stop drinking and he does. He recaptures his capability to compose music and finds a new life and youth in this late period of his life. He goes back to New York where he is received very favorably, but he can't stay there because New York is full of bad recollections and he feels it lacks some human atmosphere. So he goes back to Paris but life is never forever and he passes away one night, just like going to sleep a little bit too long. A very sensitive and emotional film in many ways. Tavernier directs it with tact and taste. The Paris of the 50s-60s is perfectly recreated, without its cars and with people in the streets that care for what is happening around them. He avoids emotions for the sake of emotions and builds up some deeply thought and felt situations.

That's a tribute to the good acting of Dexter Gordon and the direction of Bertrand Tavernier, who I understand is Swiss.  The tight close-ups of the 1959 Blue Note reverberate with sweat and reality.  Recently I had the chance to watch this film in tandem with Michael Curtiz YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN and I saw some similarities in the way Gordon is photographed with the John Alton shadows and stripes across his handsome face, just as Juano Hernandez was given almost the noir treatment in the earlier film, in the heated nightclubs where everyone wears a cigarette out the side of their mouth and the smoke makes feverish patterns across the whitewashed walls..  I wish the DVD had included some memories of the film makers, including some testimony from Tavernier to see if he had really studied earlier American jazz films or not.A young French jazz buff grows close to Dale who then becomes his idol, and shares acting duties in the film, just as Dale sweats out his addiction to liquor but what he can't shake his love/hate affair with New York City and with America as a whole.  That ambivalence is a factor the young Frenchman just can't understand; it goes way over his head and leaves him standing on the far shores of love even on the banks of the East River.  I suppose if this movie had been made in the USA this character (Francis) would have been played by a woman (like Doris Day) in YOUNG MAN WEITH A HORN, for in the USA men aren't allowed to give each other the adoring looks that Francois gives Dale in this one.  Given the time period (1986) perhaps the part would have been offered to Robin Givens or Lisa Bonet?  As it is we get the incandescent Lonette McKee at her finest, and singing beautifully too.  The film goes to great lengths to prove Francis solidly heterosexual, and pro-family, with his parents and a cute little daughter.

The movie is an enbodiement of the life that jazz musicians in the 40's and 50's struggled with.  Shunned in their homeland, reviered in France and other areas of Europe who appreciated the music.  Dexter Gordon really was the title character. His acting was real. He spent time in Europe where he was appreciated and loved.  Many people in the United States never heard of him until this movie was released.  To me, Gordon should have won the Academy Award (Unfortunately, Paul Newman won it for a role that should have been given to him in 1961 for ""The Hustler"".).  The characters in the movie were also real.  Herbie Hancock, Oscar winner for the movie's soundtrack acts in the film as well as musicians that included Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard and Ron Carter.

If you like jazz that's probably all you need to know to make you go see it.It's a loving recreation of Paris in the 1950s when many of the best American jazz musicians liked to hang in and around the Blue Note caf&eacute;, a venue which, if I only had a time machine is probably where I would most want to spend my evenings. There we find Dale Turner (Gordon) who is in France playing his tenor and drinking himself to death. Turner is based on a kind of amalgam of Bud Powell and Lester Young. His self-destructiveness and bizarre speech habits (all his male friends are nicknamed ""Lady"" something or other) are pureYoung. The friendship with a young Frenchman Francis (Francois Cluzet) with forms the film's dramatic centre is based on an episode in the life of Powell.Cluzet's character is perhaps one of the weaker aspects of the film. His conversations with Turner are a bit unsuccessful in getting very far past fanspeak, You are so wonderful, I love your music so much, etc., etc., which I confess I started finding a little tiresome. But generally it's a really delightful movie and one it is possible to enjoy even if you aren't a jazz nut.But the music is certainly a huge treat. The scene where Gordon and Lonette McKee's Darcey Leigh (clearly based on Billie Holiday) perform ""How Long Has This Been Going On"" is one of the most unforgettable and mesmerizing musical moments in any film.Music aside, it's a rather quiet, low key drama about how Turner befriends Francis and his young daughter who must then struggle to help him control the drink habit which is inexorably killing him. It's fairly slow moving. Not a lot happens. But it's a touching and likeable movie, slow and tender like much of its soundtrack, and is kept interesting mainly by Dexter Gordon's marvellous performance as Turner, a heartbreaking mixture of poetry and kindness on the one hand and hopeless alcoholic desperation on the other. He acts almost as well as he plays and he plays, well, he plays like Dexter Gordon.",5,"Friendship, music and far too much whisky",1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,2174,"['movie', 'Dexter', 'Gordon', 'features', 'others', 'Herbie', 'Hancock', 'Billy', 'Higgins', 'John', 'McGlaughlin', 'Wayne', 'Shorter', 'Tony', 'Williams', 'Freddie', 'Hubbard', 'Ron', 'Carter', 'like', 'jazz', 'probably', 'need', 'know', 'make', 'go', 'see', 'it.It', 'loving', 'recreation', 'Paris', '1950s', 'when', 'many', 'best', 'American', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'liked', 'hang', 'Blue', 'Note', 'caf', 'eacute', 'venue', 'only', 'had', 'time', 'machine', 'probably', 'where', 'would', 'most', 'want', 'spend', 'evenings', 'find', 'Dale', 'Turner', 'Gordon', 'who', 'France', 'playing', 'tenor', 'drinking', 'death', 'Turner', 'based', 'kind', 'amalgam', 'Bud', 'Powell', 'Lester', 'Young', 'self-destructiveness', 'bizarre', 'speech', 'habits', 'male', 'friends', 'are', 'nicknamed', 'Lady', 'something', 'other', 'are', 'pureYoung', 'friendship', 'young', 'Frenchman', 'Francis', 'Francois', 'Cluzet', 'forms', 'film', 'dramatic', 'centre', 'based', 'episode', 'life', 'Powell.Cluzet', 'character', 'perhaps', 'one', 'weaker', 'aspects', 'film', 'conversations', 'Turner', 'are', 'bit', 'unsuccessful', 'getting', 'very', 'far', 'past', 'fanspeak', 'are', 'so', 'wonderful', 'love', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'confess', 'started', 'finding', 'little', 'tiresome', 'generally', 'really', 'delightful', 'movie', 'one', 'possible', 'enjoy', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'jazz', 'music', 'certainly', 'huge', 'treat', 'scene', 'where', 'Gordon', 'Lonette', 'McKee', 'Darcey', 'Leigh', 'clearly', 'based', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'perform', 'How', 'Long', 'Has', 'Been', 'Going', 'one', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'mesmerizing', 'musical', 'moments', 'film.Music', 'aside', 'rather', 'quiet', 'low', 'key', 'drama', 'how', 'Turner', 'Francis', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'must', 'then', 'struggle', 'help', 'control', 'drink', 'habit', 'inexorably', 'killing', 'fairly', 'slow', 'moving', 'Not', 'lot', 'touching', 'likeable', 'movie', 'slow', 'tender', 'much', 'soundtrack', 'kept', 'interesting', 'mainly', 'Dexter', 'Gordon', 'marvellous', 'performance', 'Turner', 'heartbreaking', 'mixture', 'poetry', 'kindness', 'one', 'hand', 'hopeless', 'alcoholic', 'desperation', 'other', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'well', 'Dexter', 'Gordon']",N/A

Yes, this movie moves slow, but I think that it's meant to mimic the pace of our own daily experiences.  Dale and Francois are meant to be, perhaps, uncomfortably real, hence they each have their disturbing flaws.  (Incidently, I don't count Dexter Gordon's voice as a flaw... it came with the great musician.  Get over it.) Still, I found myself endeared to both. Lots of metaphores thorughout the movie between music, music making and living.  The music is great, if not something of an anachronism.  There are many scenes that seem unecessary, but I think they are unexplained elements that are, perhaps, meant for us to interpret for ourselves. This move is constructed differently than most, so I urge you not to apply the same criteria you would other movies.
