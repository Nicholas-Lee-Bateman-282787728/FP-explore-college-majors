Surprising display of violence, nudity and male emotion dominates much of the story.  If you are looking for a man-to-man video I would recommend this purchase.  If you are looking for scenes of violence and blood like you find in the Hostel and Saw movies this one is not quite up to that level.",4,tell it like it is,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,451,"['purchased', 'whole', 'set', 'scenes', 'are', 'sometimes', 'lengthy', 'boring', 'series', 'get', 'message', 'prison', 'not', 'place', 'be', 'Surprising', 'display', 'violence', 'nudity', 'male', 'emotion', 'much', 'story', 'are', 'looking', 'man-to-man', 'video', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'are', 'looking', 'scenes', 'violence', 'blood', 'find', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'movies', 'one', 'not', 'quite', 'up', 'level']",Oz: The Complete Seasons 1-6
998970,ATRI22S5MAVLB,B000G6BL42,"Badr ""o-0""","[39, 43]","About the show:Wow. From the first episode you feel as if you are hooked in, although I dont want to dive too much into the show itself (just skim it) you find that this show, apart from its hard hitting grit and honesty (maybe it is? I dont know, ive never been to prison) dealing with drugs, ethnic grouping, racist attacks, homosexuality, violence and spiritual guidance, this show has something for everyone to walk away with and contemplate as it does dictate a lot of what our soceity is like, even if we have to look at a test subject that is criminal and locked up.Few warnings though:Not for the faint hearted: If you are conservative in nature, I would not suggest watching this show, as some of what happens is REALLY harsh (especially as seasons go on)Not for children: I personally dont believe that people who are under the age of 17 should be watching this show, as it contains graphic sexual scenes and nudity.Dont watch this if you are a devote prison break fan: This show just makes it look like a joke! Although only the first season of the show was in prison, the realism (if they even tried for that) just doesnt compare to how hard up prisoners really have it, which i feel OZ may convey much better. Tea bag? More like hand bag! Compared to characters like Shillinger and Ada Beisi he is TAME.On the continual arguments with pricing and dvd quality:Despite claims in these previous reviews, I have yet to find a problem with this six season set.Although, I have to admit, the menu's are seemingly primative and quite long in loading up (panning through computer graphics etc which gets annoying) but the quality is still great.I also dont see how this boxset is seen as expensive. At the time fo this review (28/7/07) the entire show in this offer costs $208, If you look to buy all seasons seperatly, it will cost you an extra $8 dollars, which you could just spend on getting a better delivery service.When I bought this show (about 4 months ago) I payed about $170. So at this point in time I do find it a bit pricey and would suggest watching it since prices go up and down. I personally feel though even at 208 USD, its still worth it.",5,"putting prison break to shame nearly a decade earlier, this show rocks!",1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,2163,"['show', 'Wow', 'first', 'episode', 'feel', 'are', 'hooked', 'dont', 'want', 'dive', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'just', 'skim', 'find', 'show', 'apart', 'hard', 'hitting', 'grit', 'honesty', 'maybe', 'dont', 'know', 'ive', 'never', 'been', 'prison', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'ethnic', 'grouping', 'racist', 'attacks', 'homosexuality', 'violence', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'show', 'something', 'everyone', 'walk', 'away', 'contemplate', 'dictate', 'lot', 'what', 'soceity', 'even', 'have', 'look', 'test', 'subject', 'criminal', 'locked', 'up.Few', 'warnings', 'Not', 'faint', 'hearted', 'are', 'conservative', 'nature', 'would', 'not', 'suggest', 'watching', 'show', 'what', 'REALLY', 'harsh', 'especially', 'seasons', 'go', 'Not', 'children', 'personally', 'dont', 'believe', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'age', '17', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'show', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'nudity.Dont', 'watch', 'are', 'devote', 'prison', 'break', 'fan', 'show', 'just', 'look', 'joke', 'only', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'prison', 'realism', 'even', 'tried', 'just', 'doesnt', 'compare', 'how', 'hard', 'prisoners', 'really', 'have', 'i', 'feel', 'OZ', 'may', 'convey', 'much', 'better', 'Tea', 'bag', 'More', 'hand', 'bag', 'Compared', 'characters', 'Shillinger', 'Ada', 'Beisi', 'continual', 'arguments', 'pricing', 'dvd', 'quality', 'claims', 'previous', 'reviews', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'problem', 'six', 'season', 'set.Although', 'have', 'admit', 'menu', 'are', 'seemingly', 'primative', 'quite', 'long', 'loading', 'up', 'panning', 'computer', 'graphics', 'etc', 'annoying', 'quality', 'still', 'great.I', 'also', 'dont', 'see', 'how', 'boxset', 'seen', 'expensive', 'time', 'fo', 'review', '28/7/07', 'entire', 'show', 'offer', '208', 'look', 'buy', 'seasons', 'seperatly', 'will', 'cost', 'extra', '8', 'dollars', 'could', 'just', 'spend', 'getting', 'better', 'delivery', 'service.When', 'bought', 'show', '4', 'months', 'payed', '170', 'So', 'point', 'time', 'do', 'find', 'bit', 'pricey', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'prices', 'go', 'up', 'down', 'personally', 'feel', 'even', '208', 'USD', 'still']",Oz: The Complete Seasons 1-6
998971,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B000G6BL42,David Seaman,"[2, 3]","""Oz"" is an American television drama series created by Tom Fontana, who also wrote or co-wrote all of the series' 56 episodes. It was the first one-hour dramatic television series to be produced by premium cable network HBO. ""Oz"" premiered on July 12, 1997 and ran for six seasons. The series finale aired February 23, 2003. The show was filmed in New York City, New York and later Bayonne, New Jersey.""Oz"" is the nickname for the Oswald State Correctional Facility, formerly Oswald State Penitentiary, a fictional maximum-security prison (level 4). The nickname is a reference to the classic film ""The Wizard of Oz"", which is notable for popularizing the phrase: ""There's no place like home""; in contrast, the series has used the tagline: ""It's no place like home"".In 2008, the show was placed at #73 on Entertainment Weekly's ""New TV Classics"" list.The majority of Oz's plot arcs are set in ""Emerald City,"" also a concept from The Wizard of Oz. In this experimental unit of the prison, unit manager Tim McManus emphasizes rehabilitation and learning responsibility during incarceration, rather than carrying out purely punitive measures. Emerald City is an extremely controlled environment, with a carefully managed number of members of each racial and social group, with the hope of easing tensions among these various groups.Under McManus and Warden Leo Glynn, all inmates in Em City struggle to fulfill their own needs. Some fight for power - either over the drug trade or over other inmate factions and individuals. Others, corrections officers and inmates alike, simply want to survive, some long enough to make parole and others even just to see the next day. The show offers a no-holds-barred account of prison life. All plots, subplots and conflicts are given context and explanation by the show's wheelchair-using narrator, Augustus Hill.""Oz"" is primarily narrated by inmate Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau, Jr.), former drug dealer, convicted murderer and former drug addict. Now paralyzed from the waist down and wheelchair-bound, he appears in surreal segments and introductions that usually relate to each episode's overall theme. He also sets up scenes, introduces characters and adds epilogues. When necessary -- usually when a character is introduced -- Hill appears as an omniscient narrator. Used as a literary device of the writers, he narrates details of characters' crimes, their inmate identification numbers and their sentences. Perineau performs from within a glass cube always in his wheel chair. He is a wise man because he delivers his monologues in character. He's human and like everyone else (with one exception) he is guilty of his crime.The cast is nothing short of remarkable- at this point you will recpognize star after star, from classic Rita Moreno and B.D. Wong to Harold Perineau and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, both of whom became network famous on ABC's infamous ""LOST."" The show is plot driven and we are left out of elements if we miss an episode, though we'll catch up. But the character development that occurs with absolutely every actor is something that is rarely seen on television.There are some graphic, violent scenes involving the manipulation, degradation and even murder of inmates. As we watch this series and become more and more enthralled, we have the feeling that this may well be what it's like inside a maximum security prison. Typical of cable produced television each episode is a full hour in length and each season consists of only eight episodes (for some reason, season four produced twice that amount) but there was never a moment when the viewer feels cheated in comparison to the 24 episode network season. When one compares this show, created by Tom Fontanna, to the formulaic works of Dick Wolf (CSI and it's extended family to include NCIS) one is tempted to laugh. CSI begins, always, with a death ort discovery of a body and then a comercial break. We come back and the investigation begins. The facilities in these police headquarters are futuristic and without the sets, the hackneyed scripts and shallow characters are obvious. The set for ""Oz"" is remarkable and largely produced on location. The Emerald City is a brilliantly designed experimental ward of the prison in which the inmates feel lucky to be housed. We are taken out to ""gen. pop"" (General Population"" from time to time  and realism is such that the viewer feels less protected in Gen Pop than in Em City.Despite this, the characters are all human. There are bad guards, evil politicians; there are prisoners for whom you feel deeply sorry (we begin episode one by following the character played by Lee Tergessen, an innocent and frightened white collar business man who made the mistake of driving home drunk one evening and killing a you ng girl. He more than pays the price for this and, in fact, by the end of the first episode- his first two days, yuou feel as though he's been wrpongly placed. At the same time we meet characters who are simply evil and then, as time passes we begin to see they are capable of love and compassion. There are characters for whom we feel nothing but hatred and it doesn't change, even as the most horrific of things happen to them.This is s show you should purchase in one fell sweep. I bought it season by season nine years ago and paid per season what Amazon is asking now for the entire series. You'll watch the entire series; you may well watch it straight through the way many of us did with ""LOST"". You will be moved every episode and though this is without question one of the finest ensembles shows in television history, the glory belongs to Tom Fontanna and HB O, who was brave enough to make history with this.If you are squeamish; if you are offended by male frontal nudity, if you aren't strong enough to witness rape, blood, beatings or emotional abuse then be prepared. Many of the weaker reviews this show has garnered have been a result of critics who are uncomfortable with intense tension (It leaves the gang fights of ""West Side Story""- speaking of Rita Moreno - far behind) and the violence- there are some triggering rape scenes - and those critics who can't objectively watch a romance between two men or a group of men doing heroin. Fontanna doesn't lie to us.The show has been shown in a number of foreign countries on open air network without editing- so it sincerely isn't as bad as what most of you pay $14 to see at the local Cineplex. But in the context of television, I can see how people are surprised.See this. On the biggest screen you can. The second time you watch begin to delve into character development and then begin to search for literary parallels, historical parallels and through out consider the always present need for prison reform.",5,"Captivating, brilliant, intelligent and emotional; START HERE",1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,6761,"['Oz', 'American', 'television', 'drama', 'series', 'created', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'who',

998972,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B000G6BL42,D. C. Obraztsov,"[3, 4]","Oz gets overshadowed a lot by other HBO hits, such as The Sopranos, Deadwood, and The Wire (which was overshadowed by The Sopranos).  However, Oz is actually the show that started it all.  Without it, you wouldn't have your Tony Soprano or Al Swearengen.  Oz was kind of like a experimental project, where the creators had the unusual power to do *anything* they wanted.  HBO hardly gave them any kind of boundaries and so they pushed the envelope further than any show in the past.  The result?  A completely revolutionary, gritty drama that isn't perfect or necessarily as good as the above shows, but is skipped in conversation way too often when talking about the HBO greats.Obviously, don't watch if you are sensitive to blood, rape and violence.  It is heavily piled on and continuously gets worse throughout the seasons.  However, it's a lot more than just that.  The quality of storylines and dialogue are often a little ahead of its time and there are a lot of genius twists and turns.  It also has the advantage of taking place in where new characters can be introduced as often as they want.  You'd be surprised though how much they continue to rely on core characters throughout the years though, which is the sign of a strong show.One of the most interesting things about this show, is that if you are a TV BUFF you will be thrilled to recognize so many faces.  This is where Edie Falco (Carmela from The Sopranos) got her real start, and they actually let her leave for the bigger role on the Sopranos.  She plays hardened correctional officer Diane, who has had a pretty rough life. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Simon Adebisi, an incredibly huge and scary inmate, and the actor later became quite famous in his portrayal as Mr. Eko in Lost.  Lauren Velez, known well for her role in Dexter as LaGuerta plays Dr. Gloria Nathan.  Christopher Meloni, most known for his lead role in Law & Order: SVU and brief appearance last season in True Blood enters in the second season as Chris Keller.  J.K. Simmons, known for lots of roles, most notably as Dr. Skoda in Law & Order plays Nazi Vern Schillinger.  B.D. Wong, the psychiatrist in Law & Order: SVU plays a priest.  Kirk Acevedo, who played Charlie Francis in Fringe, plays inmate Miguel Alvarez.  Harold Perrineau Jr., who became quite famous for his role as Michael in Lost, plays narrator and inmate Augustus Hill.  Dean Winters, the ""Beeper King"" from 30 Rock or the ""Mayhem"" guy from the Allstate commercials plays inmate Ryan O'Reily.  Mark Margolis, a critically acclaimed actor and most recently for his role as Hector Salamanca is an inmate for awhile. There are also a lot of interesting guest appearances like LL Cool J, real-life retired NBA player Rick Fox playing a convicted professional athlete, one episode has the guy that plays Alby Grant in Big Love, and Luke Perry and Bobby Cannavale in the later seasons.The show starts to go downhill a little in the fourth season.  I don't want to spoil much, but you may notice the decline in quality as well.  However, overall this is a brilliant show with a hugely talented and creative group of writers and actors.",5,Underrated and Revolutionary Show,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,3142,"['Oz', 'overshadowed', 'lot', 'other', 'HBO', 'hits', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'Deadwood', 'Wire', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'Sopranos', 'However', 'Oz', 'actually', 'show', 'started', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'Oz', 'was', 'kind', 'experimental', 'project', 'where', 'creators', 'had', 'unusual', 'power', 'do', '*anything*', 'wanted', 'HBO', 'hardly', 'gave', 'kind', 'boundaries', 'so', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'further', 'show', 'past', 'result', 'completely', 'revolutionary', 'gritty', 'drama', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'necessarily', 'as', 'good', 'above', 'skipped', 'conversation', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'when', 'talking', 'HBO', 'greats.Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'are', 'sensitive', 'blood', 'rape', 'violence', 'heavily', 'piled', 'continuously', 'worse', 'seasons', 'However', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'quality', 'storylines', 'dialogue', 'are', 'often', 'little', 'ahead', 'time', 'are', 'lot', 'genius', 'twists', 'turns', 'also', 'advantage', 'taking', 'place', 'where', 'new', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'introduced', 'as', 'often', 'want', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'continue', 'rely', 'core', 'characters', 'years', 'sign', 'strong', 'show.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'show', 'are', 'TV', 'BUFF', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'recognize', 'so', 'many', 'where', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'Carmela', 'Sopranos', 'got', 'real', 'start', 'actually', 'let', 'leave', 'bigger', 'role', 'Sopranos', 'hardened', 'correctional', 'officer', 'Diane', 'who', 'had', 'pretty', 'rough', 'life', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'plays', 'Simon', 'Adebisi', 'incredibly', 'huge', 'scary', 'inmate', 'actor', 'later', 'became', 'quite', 'famous', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Eko', 'Lost', 'Lauren', 'Velez', 'known', 'well', 'role', 'Dexter', 'LaGuerta', 'Dr.', 'Gloria', 'Nathan', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'most', 'known', 'lead', 'role', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'brief', 'appearance', 'last', 'season', 'True', 'Blood', 'enters', 'second', 'season', 'Chris', 'Keller', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'known', 'lots', 'roles', 'most', 'notably', 'Dr.', 'Skoda', 'Law', 'Order', 'Nazi', 'Vern', 'Schillinger', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'psychiatrist', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'priest', 'Kirk', 'Acevedo', 'who', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Francis', 'Fringe', 'inmate', 'Miguel', 'Alvarez', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'Jr.', 'who', 'became', 'quite', 'famous', 'role', 'Michael', 'Lost', 'narrator', 'inmate', 'Augustus', 'Hill', 'Dean', 'Winters', 'Beeper', 'King', '30', 'Rock', 'Mayhem', 'guy', 'Allstate', 'commercials', 'plays', 'inmate', 'Ryan', ""O'Reily"", 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'actor', 'most', 'recently', 'role', 'Hector', 'Salamanca', 'inmate', 'awhile', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'interesting', 'guest', 'appearances', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'real-life', 'retired', 'NBA', 'player', 'Rick', 'Fox', 'playing', 'convicted', 'professional', 'athlete', 'one', 'episode', 'guy', 'Alby', 'Grant', 'Big', 'Love', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'later', 'seasons.The', 'show', 'go', 'downhill', 'little', 'fourth', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'much', 'may', 'notice', 'decline', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'overall', 'brilliant', 'show', 'hugely', 'talented', 'creative', 'group', 'writers', 'actors']",Oz: The Complete Seasons 1-6

There is a lot of great acting in this show and it keeps you on your seat waiting to see what is going to happen next. The show can drag a little bit when the prisoners are in counseling and the scenes with the prison staff don't captivate me as much as the stories about the prisoners, but everything is related in the story and it becomes difficult to separate the prison staff from the prisoners themselves.This show is excellent and complex.

998980,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B000G6BL42,Larry Benjamin,"[1, 1]","&#34;Oz&#34; was the first &#34;serious&#34; HBO drama, predating &#34;The Sopranos&#34; by a year. It had many of the same elements - multiple story lines, compelling and clearly drawn characters, and brutal, unrelenting violence. The setting - an experimental unit within a prison - gave the writers great latitude in setting up the various situations and interactions.Knowing several people who have been incarcerated, and having worked briefly in the R. J. Donovan Correctional Facility, and the federal Otay Detention Facility, I am not ignorant of what goes on within those walls. While some would say that the presentation of prison life in &#34;Oz&#34; was realistic, I would respond that it went beyond realism to gratuity in its clearly gleeful depiction of sadistic violence. I heard an interview with creator Tom Fontana, where he admitted that he and the writers competed to subject the characters to the most brutal and humiliating degradations imaginable. Nothing was off limits, and it showed - &#34;Oz&#34; quickly progressed from intensity to unbelievability. That's not to say that many of the events in the series had not actually happened to someone in real life - I'm sure that they had - but the center of those scenes was not the act of finding the inherent horror in violence, but approaching it from the other direction - starting with the horror and building a story around it. In this way it was like pornography, where the sex act is the entire point, and the story is only an excuse to set it up - the opposite of drama, where the story is at the center, that sometimes leads to dangerous and unexpected places.That's not to say that &#34;Oz&#34; didn't have sympathetic and engaging characters. Beecher, the attorney &#34;made an example of&#34; for his drunk-driving manslaughter of a little girl, is the terrified law-abiding citizen thrust in with vicious thugs. The wheelchair-bound Hill is the narrator, invisible and therefore able to observe all. Schillinger, a brutal white supremacist, is continually peeved by everyone's repeated mispronunciation of his name. O'Reily, the merciless hoodlum who cares for his mentally disabled brother. Idzik, who is bent on assassinating the man who with a casual, offhand comment, inadvertently shattered his entire worldview and plunged him into despair. The continually-bewildered Busmalis, who cannot seem to understand that his repeated efforts to escape are only prolonging his sentence. Different groups vie for power, individual characters build and break trust in an endless struggle for survival.* * SPOILER ALERT * *The ending, in which everyone is rounded up into buses and removed from the premises to avoid death by poison gas, is both symbolic (everyone finally &#34;escapes&#34;), and at the same time, they are all going to be &#34;new fish&#34; again, in an unknown prison with its own unpredictable and uncontrollable environment. As the bus leaves, everyone is quiet, and frightened again, as they must have been on their first day in Oz, so long ago.It may be unfair to fault &#34;Oz&#34; for not being &#34;The Sopranos&#34; or &#34;Six Feet Under,&#34; as there hadn't really been anything like it before. It proved that people would pay for premium cable in order to watch a strongly written, character-driven drama - so it paved the way for what followed, which turned out to be the &#34;golden age of cable television&#34; of the 2000s, when for a few years, the best drama wasn't on stage or in the movie theaters, as it had been until then, but on that much-maligned, lowbrow, and small-screened medium.",4,"""The plot is ludicrous""",1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,3606,"['34', 'Oz', '34', 'was', 'first', '34', 'serious', '34', 'HBO', 'drama', 'predating', '34', 'Sopranos', '34', 'year', 'had', 'many', 'same', 'elements', 'multiple', 'story', 'lines', 'compelling', 'clearly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'brutal', 'unrelenting', 'violence', 'setting', 'experimental', 'unit', 'prison', 'gave', 'writers', 'great', 'latitude', 'setting', 'up', 'various', 'situations', 'interactions.Knowing', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'incarcerated', 'having', 'worked', 'briefly', 'R.', 'J.', 'Donovan', 'Correctional', 'Facility', 'federal', 'Otay', 'Detention', 'Facility', 'am', 'not', 'ignorant', 'what', 'walls', 'would', 'say', 'presentation', 'prison', 'life', '34', 'Oz', '34', 'was', 'realistic', 'would', 'respond', 'went', 'realism', 'gratuity', 'clearly', 'gleeful', 'depiction', 'sadistic', 'violence', 'heard', 'interview', 'creator', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'where', 'admitted', 'writers', 'competed', 'subject', 'characters', 'most', 'brutal', 'humiliating', 'degradations', 'imaginable', 'Nothing', 'was', 'limits', 'showed', '34', 'Oz', '34', 'quickly', 'progressed', 'intensity', 'unbelievability', 'not', 'say', 'many', 'events', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'actually', 'happened', 'someone', 'real', 'life', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'center', 'scenes', 'was', 'not', 'act', 'finding', 'inherent', 'horror', 'violence', 'approaching', 'other', 'direction', 'starting', 'horror', 'building', 'story', 'way', 'was', 'pornography', 'where', 'sex', 'act', 'entire', 'point', 'story', 'only', 'excuse', 'set', 'up', 'opposite', 'drama', 'where', 'story', 'center', 'dangerous', 'unexpected', 'places.That', 'not', 'say', '34', 'Oz', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'sympathetic', 'engaging', 'characters', 'Beecher', 'attorney', '34', 'made', 'example', '34', 'drunk-driving', 'manslaughter', 'little', 'girl', 'terrified', 'law-abiding', 'citizen', 'thrust', 'vicious', 'thugs', 'wheelchair-bound', 'Hill', 'narrator', 'invisible', 'therefore', 'able', 'observe', 'Schillinger', 'brutal', 'white', 'supremacist', 'continually', 'peeved', 'everyone', 'repeated', 'mispronunciation', 'name', ""O'Reily"", 'merciless', 'hoodlum', 'who', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'brother', 'Idzik', 'who', 'bent', 'assassinating', 'man', 'who', 'casual', 'offhand', 'comment', 'inadvertently', 'shattered', 'entire', 'worldview', 'plunged', 'despair', 'continually-bewildered', 'Busmalis', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'understand', 'repeated', 'efforts', 'escape', 'are', 'only', 'prolonging', 'sentence', 'Different', 'groups', 'vie', 'power', 'individual', 'characters', 'build', 'break', 'trust', 'endless', 'struggle', 'survival', '*', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '*', '*The', 'ending', 'everyone', 'rounded', 'up', 'buses', 'removed', 'premises', 'avoid', 'death', 'poison', 'gas', 'symbolic', 'everyone', 'finally', '34', 'escapes', '34', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'going', 'be', '34', 'new', 'fish', '34', 'again', 'unknown', 'prison', 'own', 'unpredictable', 'uncontrollable', 'environment', 'bus', 'everyone', 'quiet', 'frightened', 'again', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'day', 'Oz', 'so', 'long', 'ago.It', 'may', 'be', 'unfair', 'fault', '34', 'Oz', '34', 'not', 'being', '34', 'Sopranos', '34', '34', 'Six', 'Feet', '34', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'anything', 'proved', 'people', 'would', 'pay', 'premium', 'cable', 'order', 'watch', 'strongly', 'written', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'paved', 'way', 'what', 'followed', 'turned', 'out', 'be', '34', 'golden', 'age', 'cable', 'television', '34', '2000s', 'when', 'few', 'years', 'best', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'stage', 'movie', 'theaters', 'had', 'been', 'then', 'much-maligned', 'lowbrow', 'small-screened', 'medium']",Oz: The Complete Seasons 1-6

998986,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000G6BL42,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[2, 3]","""Oz"" is unlike anything that has ever been on TV before. We will also never see anything like it on broadcast televison again. A raw explicit series, ""Oz"" shows the viewer what men go through while being incarcerated in the Oswald State Prison in the northeast. The inmates go into Oz as a certain person, but they came out scarred for life, that is if they survive their time there. The series tells many stories simultaneously, and it is told in the form of a continuing serial as many stories are told over subsequent episodes. There is infighting, backstabbing, murder, drug use, homosexual sex, and pure hatred in the walls of Oz, and as a viewer it makes one happy that we are on the other side of that prison wall looking in: Oz is a place of hell that no one wants to enter.The series has gone down in history as being the one with the most graphic depictions of prison life ever filmed, and ""Oz"" became one of HBO's biggest hits during its original run. It ran six seasons, but those seasons were short as only eight shows were filmed each year, although one season had 16 shows filmed, as HBO ordered more episodes since their other hit ""The Sapranos"" was on an extended hiatus.The longest lasting story on ""Oz"" is the gay love story between Tobias and Chris, and it lasts from season 2 until the final episode that aired in 2003. The series dramatizes how these two straight men came together and the obstacles that they encountered while living in a place that was not only human, but adamant about anyone loving one another, be it straight or gay.Oscar winner Rita Moreno plays Sister Pete who is really the only moral person in Oz. Ernie Hudson plays the prison warden, one of the most dense characters I have ever seen as he was largely responsible for a lot of the problems at Oz. Christopher Meloni became a star as Chris Keller before he went to ""Law and Order"", and he portrays Chris as a complex man who ultimately destroys himself in the end.""Oz"" is not for people under 18 and for those who have a weakness for graphic gratuitous television. When I say this is the most violent tv series ever made I mean it. The murders, the rapes of men, and the language may be hard to digest, but the producers wanted to be as faithful as possible in televising what a prison is actually like. The sex scenes may be hard to watch if your a straight man, but if your homosexual you will be left breathless as nothing like this has ever been seen before on televison: there is a lot of male kissing, simulated anal penetration, and there is a lot of frontal nudity.""Oz"" is one of the best series to ever come down the pike.

Everything about this show is awesome to me. I love the plot, acting, and writing. The fact that it came from HBO makes it that much better. A thought provoking masterpiece like this doesn't come around every day and may never be equaled. I own all HBO series on DVD (save for Sex and the City) and Oz is truly one of the best.
