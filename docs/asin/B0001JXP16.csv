I will not describe the plot to you because I feel it is best to walk in cold. The movie is complex with emotions and a major plot twist that is better left unsaid.The movie was directed by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and brother Luc Dardenne. It was nominated at the Cannes Film Festival for the top prize, the Golden Palm, and was awarded ""Best Actor"" to Olivier Gourmet who plays Olivier in the film. Also, Morgan Marinne, who plays the young boy, was nominated for a Cesar Award (the equivalent of the Oscar in France) for ""Most Promising Actor"".""The Son"" tackles some pretty big topics but handles them in a sincere way. We come to believe in these characters, especially Olivier, even though we are not quite sure where this film is headed. Olivier has two sides to him, on one hand he seems like a nice guy and on the other seems malicious. The big subject here is forgiveness. How far would we go to understand those who have caused you harm? But, I've said too much. I realize this is a very vague review, but after you've seen the movie you will thank me.Here is a movie I recommend to all those who are interested in foreign films and are sick of the big budget brain dead Hollywood films being released this time of year.I want to say one thing about the film's ending. After watching it some may feel it ends too abruptly. It does not. The movie ends at just the right moment. There is nothing else that could have been added. We know all we need to know about where these people are headed. Please do not complain about the conclusion.Bottom-line: Subtle, powerful film that seems to sneak up on you. We are never quite sure where the film is going to take us but it manages to deal with its material in a convincing way.",4,"The Good ""Son""",1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,1819,"['warn', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'plot', 'feel', 'best', 'walk', 'cold', 'movie', 'complex', 'emotions', 'major', 'plot', 'twist', 'better', 'left', 'unsaid.The', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Dardenne', 'brother', 'Luc', 'Dardenne', 'was', 'nominated', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'top', 'prize', 'Golden', 'Palm', 'was', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Olivier', 'Gourmet', 'who', 'Olivier', 'film', 'Also', 'Morgan', 'Marinne', 'who', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'nominated', 'Cesar', 'Award', 'equivalent', 'Oscar', 'France', 'Most', 'Promising', 'Actor', 'Son', 'pretty', 'big', 'topics', 'sincere', 'way', 'come', 'believe', 'characters', 'especially', 'Olivier', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'film', 'headed', 'Olivier', 'two', 'sides', 'one', 'hand', 'nice', 'guy', 'other', 'malicious', 'big', 'subject', 'here', 'forgiveness', 'How', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'understand', 'who', 'have', 'caused', 'harm', ""'ve"", 'said', 'too', 'much', 'realize', 'very', 'vague', 'review', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'thank', 'movie', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'sick', 'big', 'budget', 'brain', 'dead', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'being', 'released', 'time', 'year.I', 'want', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'ending', 'watching', 'may', 'feel', 'too', 'abruptly', 'not', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'moment', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'know', 'need', 'know', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'headed', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'complain', 'conclusion.Bottom-line', 'Subtle', 'powerful', 'film', 'sneak', 'up', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'take', 'deal', 'material', 'convincing', 'way']",The Son
808490,A1PY6SJT8UHL92,B0001JXP16,Amazon Customer,"[4, 8]","The story told by this movie is truly original, and it raises all sorts of interesting moral issues. How would you behave if your job gave you the opportunity to help a young boy who just got out of juvenile prison and who, when only 11 years old, involuntarily killed your son while trying to steal something from your car? This is material for a great movie and a great screenplay.Nonetheless, I cannot say I found this movie compelling, and even less I can understand how this movie could earn a prize for best actor, when both the main characters maintain virtually the same facial expression throughout the whole story, regardless of what's going on on the screen. Besides, I certainly love many ""artsy"" movies, but I do not understand why long minutes of silence and absence of action should be judged as compelling. Mind you, we are not taking about long awkward silences that may actually MEAN something. Half of this movie is made of silent people driving, getting into and out of cars, going up and down stairs, working, or going through many other activities that any of us daily go through with no need to communicate at all. Long and long minutes went by without anything useful for story or character development coming out of them.I think that the story in this movie is compelling, the ending is certainly not as inconsequential as some reviewers complained (actually, I found the conclusion touching and quite telling of what will pass between the two characters), but the movie is mostly very very dull.

808491,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0001JXP16,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 8]","This movie is absolutely first-rate. A carpentry teacher at a vocational training center for troubled teens agrees to take into his class a 16 year old who has spent four years in detention for a serious crime. The teacher is honest and fair, but also withdrawn and emotionless. His young son had been killed and his marriage has crumbled. His wife has divorced him and is remarrying. He lives by himself. From the start he takes an eery, almost obsessive interest in the teen. This isn't much of a spoiler since you learn the following within 30 minutes of the film: The teen was the one who had killed the teacher's son in a botched car break-in four years earlier. The teen doesn't know the teacher is the father or that the teacher knows he killed the son.There is not a speck of melodrama in the film. Olivier Gourmet who plays the teacher is phenomenal. He's in every scene. He plays the emotionally shipwrecked father with great depth. There are no smiles, no frowns, no anger. You're never quite sure what retribution might happen. The ending is quiet and powerful.For those interested in the craft of film-making, there are two lengthy, excellent interviews with the Dardenne brothers and with Olivier Gourmet. The DVD transfer is excellent; the subtitles are quite readable.

Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne have filmed what at first appears to be just an ordinary working class man's life (Olivier, a carpenter with apprentices, played with subtle perfection by Olivier Gourmet), following it closely, slyly introducing Olivier's ex-wife (Isabella Soupart) with whom he no longer has contact save for a tragedy they share, and then darkens the picture with the presence of a 16 year old apprentice Francis (Morgan Marinne) who we instantly know has some mystery behind him.  Olivier watches the boy's every move, discovers that the boy has just been released form prison where he was incarcerated since age 11 for theft and murder.  Olivier realizes this is the boy responsible for his son's death five years ago and he takes Francis under his wing, his motivation remains unsure until the film's surprising end. This is verismo at its peak - just an emotionally charged story, simple, without accoutrements.  There is no music soundtrack, only silence and very very little dialogue.  But because of this starkness, the significance of the movie is all the more powerful.  Perhaps this film is not for everyone: patience and a parcel of time are required to savour it.

808499,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0001JXP16,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 3]","The two brothers Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne directed Rosetta (1999), which won the Golden Palm in 1999.  This time the two brothers bring another unique tale of social importance to the audience in a spectacular story with wisdom, integrity, and artistic value.  The Son has some resemblance with Rosetta in regards to the cinematography, which might be compared to the Dogma 95 style.  However, this time the two brothers maximize the potential of the camera technique as it serves its ultimate purpose in the story telling.The camera follows Olivier (Olivier Gourmet), a carpenter teacher at an institution for troubled adolescents, wherever he travels.  The audience is allowed to peak over Olivier's shoulder to see what he sees and gradually enter his world.  Frenetically, Olivier runs around in the building while peaking through windows, around corners, and he makes up excuses to be in locations where he can stare undisturbed at a young male adolescent.  Slowly the audience begins to make their own assumptions to why Olivier does what he does.Olivier eventually gets enough courage to approach the head of the institution as he requests that the new boy, whom he has been secretively stalking, is transferred from the metal craft department to the carpentry department for which he is the supervisor.  The head of the institution agrees to Olivier's request, and shortly after he picks up the young adolescent from the metal craft department.  Olivier brings the boy to the carpenter department where he closely examines him with his eyes, and provides work pants and tools for him.The film might appear dreary at first, but this is essential, as the audience will be rewarded for its cerebral participation in the story of the Belgian carpenter Olivier.  Through Olivier the Dardenne brothers dissect the audience's perception and participation in the story through what psychologists might call the attribution theory.  Through this the film tells an extraordinary story of an ordinary man and his uncharacteristic relationship to a teen.The Dardenne brothers' minimalist approach to the story does not offer any extravagant flamboyance, which might be seen in Oscar winning films.  There are no symbolisms, no analogies, nor additional visual syntaxes to what is ordinarily supposed to be within each frame to enhance a film.  The script tells more than what is in the lines, yet it does not provide any clear indications in what direction it is venturing until the very end.  The audience is merely suspended to their own knowledge and wisdom as they begin to interpret what the film depicts.  In the end, the viewer will have experienced truly brilliant cinema, which offers much insight into life and its many complexities.",5,Brilliant Personal Connection with Sorrow & Forgiveness...,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,2752,"['two', 'brothers', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Dardenne', 'Luc', 'Dardenne', 'directed', 'Rosetta', '1999', 'won', 'Golden', 'Palm', '1999', 'time', 'two', 'brothers', 'bring', 'unique', 'tale', 'social', 'importance', 'audience', 'spectacular', 'story', 'wisdom', 'integrity', 'artistic', 'value', 'Son', 'resemblance', 'Rosetta', 'regards', 'cinematography', 'might', 'be', 'compared', 'Dogma', '95', 'style', 'However', 'time', 'two', 'brothers', 'maximize', 'potential', 'camera', 'technique', 'ultimate', 'purpose', 'story', 'telling.The', 'camera', 'Olivier', 'Olivier', 'Gourmet', 'carpenter', 'teacher', 'institution', 'troubled', 'adolescents', 'audience', 'allowed', 'peak', 'Olivier', 'shoulder', 'see', 'what', 'gradually', 'enter', 'world', 'Frenetically', 'Olivier', 'around', 'building', 'peaking', 'windows', 'corners', 'up', 'excuses', 'be', 'locations', 'where', 'can', 'stare', 'undisturbed', 'young', 'male', 'adolescent', 'Slowly', 'audience', 'make', 'own', 'assumptions', 'why', 'Olivier', 'what', 'eventually', 'enough', 'courage', 'approach', 'head', 'institution', 'new', 'boy', 'whom', 'been', 'secretively', 'stalking', 'transferred', 'metal', 'craft', 'department', 'carpentry', 'department', 'supervisor', 'head', 'institution', 'Olivier', 'request', 'shortly', 'up', 'young', 'adolescent', 'metal', 'craft', 'department', 'Olivier', 'boy', 'carpenter', 'department', 'where', 'closely', 'eyes', 'work', 'pants', 'tools', 'him.The', 'film', 'might', 'appear', 'dreary', 'first', 'essential', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'cerebral', 'participation', 'story', 'Belgian', 'carpenter', 'Olivier', 'Olivier', 'Dardenne', 'brothers', 'dissect', 'audience', 'perception', 'participation', 'story', 'what', 'psychologists', 'might', 'call', 'attribution', 'theory', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'ordinary', 'man', 'uncharacteristic', 'relationship', 'teen.The', 'Dardenne', 'brothers', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'story', 'not', 'offer', 'extravagant', 'flamboyance', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'films', 'are', 'symbolisms', 'analogies', 'additional', 'visual', 'syntaxes', 'what', 'ordinarily', 'supposed', 'be', 'frame', 'enhance', 'film', 'script', 'more', 'what', 'lines', 'not', 'provide', 'clear', 'indications', 'what', 'direction', 'venturing', 'very', 'end', 'audience', 'merely', 'suspended', 'own', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'begin', 'interpret', 'what', 'film', 'depicts', 'end', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'experienced', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'cinema', 'much', 'insight', 'life', 'many', 'complexities']",The Son

808501,A7BMU8ZJJ77I0,B0001JXP16,Mithridates VI of Pontus,"[4, 4]","The Belgian Dardenne brothers (Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) are renowned (mainly in Europe) for their intense minimalist dramas.  Following on the success of Rosetta (1999) which won the prestigious Palm d'Or and La Promese (1996), the brothers embarked on the rigorously stylistic Le Fils (2002).I must issue a warning for readers: any mention of the plot ruins this film.  Everything is a spoiler!  This is true since only view of the world the audience sees is through (well over the shoulder) the eyes of the emotionally restrained main character, Oliver (Olivier Gourmet -- won Best Actor at Cannes for this role) and main narrative threads are only slowly revealed by him.The briefest summary I can give without completely spoiling this wrenching emotional experience is this: Olivier, who works teaching carpentry to male teenagers (many are delinquents seeking a vocation), develops an obsession with one of his charges Francis (Morgan Marinne).The reason for his behavior is revealed half-way through the film. Le Fils also employs an intense, and occasionally nauseating, cinematography.  This might seem surprising and even somewhat distracting in a movie with very little action, however, the Dardenne brothers use this style to adeptly create extreme naturalism.  This is further facilitated by the absence of a film score and the presence of Olivier in every frame.  All in all, these choices hypnotically draw the reader into Oliviers world -- we see every minute emotion his stoic face betrays, his every inflection speaks volumes, his every action -- even the most routine and every deviation from the routine -- reflect his emotional state.  However, this intense character study is only for the most stalwart of movie goers.Le Fils is a masterpiece.  Although the plot is simplistic, the delivery is impeccable.  I intensely emphasized with both characters and suffered with them.

We watch for a half hour a kind of cat and mouse game between the two of them before we discover the reason for the teacher's initial reluctance to take on the boy as a student and his reticence about the choice he's made. Divorced and living an isolated existence, the man (Olivier Gourmet) seems deadened by whatever has happened in his life, his face an expressionless mask as he goes about the tasks of the day, always in his carpenter's pants and his leather back support - like someone trapped.Choosing to be the boy's teacher, he embarks on an unlikely attempt to recover the life that has been robbed from him, and what he begins is a process of redemption both for himself and the boy. The film - shot with handheld camera in a cinema verite documentary style - is demandingly unconventional in the way it tells its story, leaving us for long periods in the dark about what we are watching, then revealing volumes in sudden unexpected bursts of dialogue. Inspired by the murder of a small boy by two older boys in England in the early 1990s (as explained by the Dardenne brothers in a DVD interview), the film explores extremes of emotion - rage and grief - and it offers a brave vision of resolution and recovery.",4,Redemption . . .,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,1428,"['Belgian', 'film', 'story', 'grief', 'redemption', 'teacher', 'vocational', 'training', 'center', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'teach', 'fundamentals', 'carpentry', 'watch', 'half', 'hour', 'kind', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'two', 'discover', 'reason', 'teacher', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'take', 'boy', 'student', 'reticence', 'choice', 'made', 'Divorced', 'living', 'isolated', 'existence', 'man', 'Olivier', 'Gourmet', 'deadened', 'happened', 'life', 'face', 'expressionless', 'mask', 'tasks', 'day', 'always', 'carpenter', 'pants', 'leather', 'back', 'support', 'someone', 'trapped.Choosing', 'be', 'boy', 'teacher', 'unlikely', 'attempt', 'recover', 'life', 'been', 'robbed', 'what', 'process', 'redemption', 'boy', 'film', 'shot', 'handheld', 'camera', 'cinema', 'verite', 'documentary', 'style', 'demandingly', 'unconventional', 'way', 'story', 'leaving', 'long', 'periods', 'dark', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'then', 'revealing', 'volumes', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'bursts', 'dialogue', 'Inspired', 'murder', 'small', 'boy', 'two', 'older', 'boys', 'England', 'early', '1990s', 'explained', 'Dardenne', 'brothers', 'DVD', 'interview', 'film', 'extremes', 'emotion', 'rage', 'grief', 'brave', 'vision', 'resolution', 'recovery']",The Son

(I have never seen Gourmet before, but if wins awards, I will know exactly why.)This carpenter develops a liking to a younger apprentice. It's eventually revealed that this liking is linked to a tragedy in the past, that continues to cast a pall over several of the film's characters. I will not not dilvulge the exact nature of that tragedy, that'd spoil the enigma, but the film is relentless in outlining its ramifications -- the angst, guilt, confusion, and how the carpenter finds himself both drawn to and repulsed by the youngster.The overall ambience of the film may be bleak and murky, but its pervasive human spirit is very rewaring for all the patience it demands.

I really didn't notice the camera ""shakiness""--after the ""Bourne Supremacy"" car chase nothing will make my stomach churn as violently, not even ""The Riddler"" at Magic Mountain. This movie is a character study, which is why there are only two actors credited in the DVD filmography. The film lasers in on the complex feelings of anger and forgiveness a man feels after losing his son, and then finding out that perhaps his murderer isn't so different than the deceased boy. It plays out like a tense game of cat and mouse: does Olivier plan to somehow injure the teen, or does he want to seek redemption by digging into the boy's psyche and seeing what dwells there? Is the boy remorseful? Or did the time spent in prison harden him, and make him a potential recidivist?The ending is rather abrupt, but it was a refreshing change of pace from the meldramatic predictability of mainstream films. The last ten minutes for me were extremely intense. Gestures and words could be misinterpreted and deemed dangerous. I enjoyed this movie because I worked with troubled adolescents in a  psychiatric center, and despite some of their repulsive qualities, they displayed surprising vulnerability that would appeal to even the most jaded counselors. Some of the kids were predators, but the majority just wanted to feel valued. Can you forgive someone for a shocking act that tears a life apart? Or will you respond with hatred and anger and possibly repeat a vicious cycle that leaves no survivors emotionally intact? Will rejecting the boy make him less empathetic toward others? Or will acceptance change the very behavior that led to the boy's senseless killing and incarceration?

We later learn he is divorced and his wife ex-wife is about to be married and is expecting a child. We then learn that Oliver had once had a son who was killed and the new student in the school is involved. Oliver seems to have a genuine interest in the young man who killed his son as well as a hatred and resentment combined with the need for answers that will never be adequate.

Well as ever that depends upon the viewer, this is not `art house' it is filmed in real time, no music, minimal lighting and real locations. They even use a steady hand cam for most of the filming. Because of the use of real locations, there is often a feeling approaching claustrophobic and lends itself to docudrama. This is fine as it adds to the realism but from a viewing perspective actually can detract from being engaging. However, this there is a web being spun and the more it is woven the more the intrigue builds. I found myself constantly trying to double guess how it would end and getting it mostly wrong, so that is a good thing.The acting is all superb and the production is almost unnoticeable as that was what was being aimed for, so nothing to criticise on that front.

Like Rosetta, ""The Son (Le Fils)"" explores the emotional turmoil of the protagonist, and watching the process would be torment to some people.  Still, great acting of Oliver Gourmet is so impressive that those fans who respect the realistic approach to human behavior will be satisfied with the end result.Olivier (Olivier Gourmet) is working at a carpentry school, but when a new student Francis is sent to the class, he starts to act a little strangely.  He is clearly interested in Francis, but he is also afraid of having it known by the others.  But he still keeps on peeping at him from behind the wall, not knowing what to do with himself.  But why?The reason is revealed after 30 minutes (and if you don't want to know it, skip this paragraph).  The fact is, Olivier knew Francis killed his son.  Still. Olivier takes Francis as a new student, teaching the craft of carpenrty works.  Laconic Francis (not knowing the identity of Olivier) begins to feel attached to the teacher, but ... what is Olivier really thinking about?  Revenger?  Forgiveness?  Or he does not know his true mind either?""The Son"" goes on like this, without superfluous dialogues, shot with a hand-held camera.  Each take goes on very long, sometimes several minutes without cut, and often the image is shot behind the head of Olivier, as if letting us share his viewpoint.  Evidently the directors did thorough rehearsals before shooting, because each shot is realized with the calculated movement of camera.But the real virtue of the film lies in Olivier Gourmet (seen also in ""Read My Lips"" and others), who gives a terrific acting full of nuance and emotion.  The troubled mind of Olivier comes so natural onto the screen that you almost forgive the film's too arty attitudes (no soundtrack, for instance, like Dogme films).  Frankly, I think that ""The Son"" is a kind of film that appeals more critics than to general audiences.  But Olivier Gourmet's performance is a genuine one.Director Luc Dardenne says that the film is partly inspired by the real-life murder case in Liverpool in 1993.  Probably English people remember the case I refer to.  As his comment shows, the film deals with an immediate topic in a unique way, and like reality itself, ""The Son"" is often ambiguous, which becomes the strength of it.

808510,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B0001JXP16,Westley,"[3, 3]","Schlumpy Olivier (Olivier Gourmet) is a carpenter who works for a school, where he apprentices teen boys who have recently been released from juvenile detention.  He's a bit of a taskmaster and perhaps a bit harsh with the boys.  When he's asked to take on a new boy (Francis, played Morgan Marinne), he flatly refuses.  However, he is soon following the boy around and seems to know him somehow.  Who is this boy and what is the connection to Olivier?  The answer is slowly revealed through a serious of revelations.  Along the way, we get to know Olivier and his habits; he's meticulous and clearly overly controlled, which could lead to some problems.""The Son"" is a superb but slowly paced film.  Belgian directors and brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (""L'Enfant"") rely on handheld digital cameras, which really works for this small story.  At times, it feels as though we're breathing down the characters' necks.  Although this character-driven drama could hardly be considered a ""thriller,"" it manages to really ratchet up the tension.  Specifically, Olivier is so internal and tightly wound that the audience has no idea how he will resolve his issues with this new boy.  The ending of the film is breath-taking, although the final denouement is perhaps not as cathartic as some might like.  The pace and lack of obvious resolution may turn off some viewers (as reflected by some of the reviews here), but I was mesmerized.  This ambiguous gem is a real winner.",5,The new kid,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1472,"['Schlumpy', 'Olivier', 'Olivier', 'Gourmet', 'carpenter', 'who', 'school', 'where', 'teen', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'bit', 'taskmaster', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'harsh', 'boys', 'When', 'asked', 'take', 'new', 'boy', 'Francis', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Marinne', 'flatly', 'However', 'soon', 'following', 'boy', 'around', 'know', 'somehow', 'Who', 'boy', 'what', 'connection', 'Olivier', 'answer', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'serious', 'revelations', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'Olivier', 'habits', 'meticulous', 'clearly', 'overly', 'controlled', 'could', 'lead', 'problems', 'Son', 'superb', 'slowly', 'paced', 'film', 'Belgian', 'directors', 'brothers', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Luc', 'Dardenne', ""L'Enfant"", 'rely', 'handheld', 'digital', 'cameras', 'really', 'small', 'story', 'times', ""'re"", 'breathing', 'down', 'characters', 'necks', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'considered', 'thriller', 'really', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'Specifically', 'Olivier', 'so', 'internal', 'tightly', 'audience', 'idea', 'how', 'will', 'resolve', 'issues', 'new', 'boy', 'ending', 'film', 'breath-taking', 'final', 'denouement', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'cathartic', 'might', 'like', 'pace', 'lack', 'obvious', 'resolution', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'viewers', 'reflected', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'ambiguous', 'gem', 'real', 'winner']",The Son
