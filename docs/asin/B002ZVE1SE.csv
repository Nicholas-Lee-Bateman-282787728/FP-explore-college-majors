While some people did not enjoy the final season 6, I have to say that I did. I was not at all upset that Jo Mills shows up as just Mrs. Mills, and her marriage in season 5 is irrelevant in season 6. That's great by me; I thought that the plot line with her marrying Marc was the weakest of the 6 seasons. The final season is made up of two long episodes, each broken into two parts. So you have a DVD for each of the episodes with parts 1 and 2 - nice for those of us who want to stretch out the viewing pleasure. I would have liked to see more episodes, but I'm not sure they could have ended the series any better than they did. And had the show moved forward, there would surely have been some major changes. Leaving us wanting more was not a bad idea.",5,Great series - I'll miss it,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,895,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', '6', 'series', 'Judge', 'John', 'Deed', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'envy', 'journey', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'final', 'season', '6', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'was', 'not', 'upset', 'Jo', 'Mills', 'up', 'as', 'just', 'Mrs.', 'Mills', 'marriage', 'season', '5', 'irrelevant', 'season', '6', 'great', 'thought', 'plot', 'line', 'marrying', 'Marc', 'was', 'weakest', '6', 'seasons', 'final', 'season', 'made', 'two', 'long', 'episodes', 'broken', 'two', 'parts', 'So', 'have', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'parts', '1', '2', 'nice', 'who', 'want', 'stretch', 'out', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'series', 'better', 'did', 'had', 'show', 'moved', 'forward', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'changes', 'Leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'idea']",N/A

At some point they just run out of steam and everyone needs to move onto something else.  The early seasons of this show were brilliant with Martin Shaw doing an excellent job as the judge.  He runs a very tight ship in his courtroom and truly tries to lead the process towards justice for all.  The first mistake this series made was taking him out of his courtroom and sending him to the Hague instead where he serves on a tribunal. The second mistake this final series made was to have two giant episodes where everything is a conspiracy upon conspiracy.  This was so far removed from the judge's usually razor sharp defined issues which are tried in his courtroom.  If you have not watched this show before, I recommend you get the first few seasons.  They are brilliant and worth the investment.",3,Ran Out of Steam in Last Season,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,836,"['Tv', 'series', 'have', 'finite', 'life', 'span', 'point', 'just', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'everyone', 'needs', 'move', 'something', 'else', 'early', 'seasons', 'show', 'were', 'brilliant', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'doing', 'excellent', 'job', 'judge', 'very', 'tight', 'ship', 'courtroom', 'truly', 'tries', 'lead', 'process', 'justice', 'first', 'mistake', 'series', 'made', 'was', 'taking', 'courtroom', 'sending', 'Hague', 'instead', 'where', 'tribunal', 'second', 'mistake', 'final', 'series', 'made', 'was', 'have', 'two', 'giant', 'episodes', 'where', 'everything', 'conspiracy', 'conspiracy', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'judge', 'usually', 'razor', 'sharp', 'defined', 'issues', 'are', 'tried', 'courtroom', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'show', 'recommend', 'get', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'are', 'brilliant', 'investment']",N/A

It appears this will be the last of the judge and we'll just have to imagine the rest of their lives.  The producers were always clever enough to end each series as if were final, but leave us with the hope of meeting up with the characters again.  That makes it all in all satisfying I suppose.  And such a stellar cast of actors this age is of course difficult to hold together.  It was sure good while it lasted though.
