Between Halley and her sister, Halley and her mother and Halley and her father this totally comes to life. Anyhow, I'm a big fan of her voice as a singer but she makes for a decent actress too. She makes her character come to life. From smiling while in the bed at night, alone thinking about her crush unexpectedly to going the extra mile to bring doubt to situations at hand. I think many people can watch this movie and it's definitely recommended to any teenagers that like lovey dovey movies. Okay, so it's not *that* bad but it is based on love.

To the people that bashed and dissed this movie due to the movie ""taking on too much at one time"" I do agree to a certain point but the fact that this film deals with very real issues that are very serious issues cannot be denied. Also this movie is based on two books by Sarah Dessen and the film is VERY similar to the movie. But any matter, I LOVED this movie.I have watched it more than once and alwasy notice something new that I love about it.Mandy Moore is at the brink of her peak of acting! This movie proves what a talented young lady she truly is! She's likable from the first few moments of the movie and her character Halley is someone many teenage girls can relate to.This movie deals with issues that every teenage girl should be able to say ""Yeah I remeber that"" or ""I'm going through that too."" It's great for teenagers.I know I also have a special spot for this film because I loved the book and the similarities are amazing. If you have seen this film and want to get a more in depth look try looking for Sarah Dessen's ""Someone Like You"" and ""That Summer."" Or try the ""How to Deal"" book that combines the both of them.Either way this movie should be given a try.The extras on this DVD are excellent. The music videos are great, the deleted scenes are good, and the actors segments talking about their characters add even more to the film.Highly recommended!",5,~Entertaining!

I believe she's a very talented young actress/singer who has range we don't give her credit for.  With `How to Deal' Mandy tries to grow up a bit, playing against the teen sweetheart and going for teen angst instead.  Here Moore plays Halley, a girl at ends with her family, frustrated with her parents divorce, her sisters wedding and her fathers impending remarriage, not to mention her best friend has now fallen in love (love is something Halley does not believe in) and so Halley now feels like the only sane person around.  Then she meets Macon (Trent Ford) who is smitten with Halley despite her repelling attitude and so he pursues her, much to her dissatisfaction.  But, as fate would have it, Halley ends up falling for Macon, hard, and she starts to doubt her former philosophies on love and life.  Mandy uses a lot of maturity as she tackles this role and the film as a whole has a very realistic and mature outlook on every subject crossed, from divorce to teen pregnancy to death and teen relationships, `How to Deal' is a perfect example of how to make a smart, mature teen film that appeals to more than 12-year-old girls.",4,Moore reason to love this movie...and it's star!,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,1170,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'believe', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'actress/singer', 'who', 'range', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'credit', 'How', 'Deal', 'Mandy', 'tries', 'grow', 'up', 'bit', 'playing', 'teen', 'sweetheart', 'going', 'teen', 'angst', 'instead', 'Here', 'Moore', 'Halley', 'girl', 'ends', 'family', 'frustrated', 'parents', 'divorce', 'sisters', 'wedding', 'fathers', 'impending', 'remarriage', 'not', 'mention', 'best', 'friend', 'now', 'fallen', 'love', 'love', 'something', 'Halley', 'not', 'believe', 'so', 'Halley', 'now', 'only', 'sane', 'person', 'around', 'Then', 'Macon', 'Trent', 'Ford', 'who', 'smitten', 'Halley', 'repelling', 'attitude', 'so', 'much', 'dissatisfaction', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'Halley', 'up', 'falling', 'Macon', 'hard', 'doubt', 'former', 'philosophies', 'love', 'life', 'Mandy', 'lot', 'maturity', 'role', 'film', 'whole', 'very', 'realistic', 'mature', 'outlook', 'subject', 'crossed', 'divorce', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'death', 'teen', 'relationships', 'How', 'Deal', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'make', 'smart', 'mature', 'teen', 'film', 'appeals', 'more', '12-year-old', 'girls']",N/A

""heartful_home""","[3, 8]","Ratings:Acting: Excellent in both Mandy, her boyfriend & motherPlot: WeakScript: TerribleMorals: Even WorseEditing: Choppy and low-budgetAfter such an uplifting movie in ""A Walk to Remember"", I decided to give this a try. Mandy Moore had such a persona that I believed she could morally pull through some of the things I saw in the trailer.But no morals were displayed here.Grandma smokes pot only as a comedic insert. No real understanding of why she would qualify for medical marijuana.Mom is sleeping with an apparently 'nice guy' who she went on one date with.There are many moments where they apparently didn't take enough footage to make smooth editing and some moments where even Mandy's acting seems clumsy. Many contrived moments borrowed from other movies (like trying to eat a cornish game hen and the future Brother-in-laws parents are horrified when it falls in her lap.) We're not horrified, just bored.And Mandy falls for a guy who has nothing to show for himself. She wants to have sex with him for the heck of it. But then when the fairly explicit (but no nudity) love scene she decides not to go through with it and runs away. Her reason?Think of all the reasons teens should not have sex:It's morally wrong to have premarital sex.She could get pregnant.Sex means a commitment she's not ready to make.She's giving up her precious virginity in a bedroom at a party.etc.No. The reason she doesn't do it is because she was afraid she loved him too much.HUH?!There's nothing to convince us that she even loves him. Some genuine affection does shine through, and eventually the actor's charm shines through the ""loser"" character, but there is no positive message to take from it.All I can say is. Be afraid of this movie. Very, very afraid. BOO on Mandy for letting down her viewing public when she's one of the few teen actors who could stand for some kind of morals.In this movie, we're expecting her to come to some moral conclusion, some moment of understanding or growth. But it's just not there.I hope Mandy will not continue to disappoint by choosing this kind of slosh that should be thrown in the heap of Hollywood refuse.

It's a teen drama with some romance and humor. Think of it as a teen version of American Beauty. Though it's all rather light, How to Deal does have some seriousness and important parts.Mandy Moore (marry me?) is Halley Martin, a teenage girl who refuses to believe that true love exists (like me). Her best pal does but is heartbroken when her boyfriend drops dead on the football field of a heart defect (err...like me). Halley's parents have split and found others, her sister is engaged to some guy and all they do is argue. It seems like the best way to deal with love is to avoid it.All that changes when Halley meets Macon (stupid name) a geeky Star Wars nerd. He seems like a dweeb at first but his character grows on you, as he does Halley. He's played by Trent Ford and on the cover he's wearing a white vest and is marketed as a sexually neutral, non-threatening pretty boy (Orlando Bloom, Justin Timberlake etc) but that ain't him or his character at all and he never appears in a vest at any point in the movie. I expected to hate him just because of the cover but that ain't so. In the course of her steadily strengthening relationship with Macon (really, what a stupid name!) Halley learns how to deal with teen pregnancy, being a bridesmaid, her dope-smoking grandmother, car crashes, stepmoms, stepdads etc. Stuff that every kid learns. Real kids, not the kids that make love to pastries or live in mansions, which are the only 2 types of kids Hollywood thinks exist.Taken from 2 separate novels by Sarah Dessen called 'Someone Like You' and 'That Summer' it's possible that How to Deal might have a sequel. And if it does its literary roots guarantee it will a better sequel than most.I recommend How to Deal for anyone who is sick to death of endless American Pie clones or Harold and Kumar or Maid in Manhatten/Laws of Attraction/Two Weeks Notice/Sweet Home Alabama/blah blah blah.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. How to Deal is not your typical teen comedy and, in fact, is more drama than comedy. Mandy Moore plays a teenage girl who is dealing with her parents' divorce, her father's remarriage, her sister's engagement, and her own cynical views on true love. At the same time, a close friend dies and she finds out her best friend is pregnant. This is a movie rife with teen issues that rarely see the light of day, and it's handled in a clever and amusing way. The characters are thoroughly fleshed out, so there's no point where you're sitting around wondering about their motivations.

It may also be because I want to hate Mandy Moore - my boyfriend wants to get into her knickers quite badly, and more. I've seen her in Saved & Princess Diaries (her character in those was a real cow, plus she was blonde, and she doesn't suit it), and A Walk To Remember, she kinda reminded me of me when I was at school - the whole image. There's always something not quite right with her in films I've found before. In this film, she really shone, and I almost believed she was Halley.Mandy Moore first came to my attention when she was a young pop star, trying to get some fans here in the UK. Don't ask me to name one of her songs, cos I can't. She came round at the same time as the Jessicas/Christinas/Britneys of the time, and she really got shoved to the side. So instead she turned to acting, and is beginning to make quite a name for herself.I sat watching this movie, mainly cos I was looking for something to watch, having been up since 8:30 (on my day off!), and couldn't muster the energy to do much else. I had a blanket over me, all snuggly & warm and nibbling on chocolate. The film was quite long, and I ended up watching it in 2 parts, mainly cos there's so much crammed into the film, you feel exhausted. And by that time I was energised, and wanting to do something. This has to be Mandy Moore's best movie yet, and although I hated the hair extensions at the beginning, and I hated the male lead (more about him in a sec), she was pretty damn good! And she & Allison Janney just seemed to click, playing mother & daughter, but mind you, Allison Janney can do no wrong. She's brilliant.Trevor Ford who played the stupidly named Macon (who calls their kid Macon?!) just wasn't right. The hair was too long, and the whole look just didn't scream out to me. What's getting on my nerves now about all these movies aimed at teenagers (but not really) is the male leads are always not good looking. It's too much of the pretty boy, not-old-enough-to-shave-yet look. And that in my opinion, is not a good look. Plus, he just seemed to pop up in the film, there was never a real consistency to his character.Alexandra Holden, who plays Halley's best friend (she's also appeared in episodes of Friends & Tru Calling), was really a subplot, she seemed to pop up inconsistently as well. She disappeared for the entire middle of the film, with just a brief glimpse of her at one point. Peter Gallagher was terrific, playing a dad who was still trying to be young & cool and failing miserably.The extras on this are not really worth writing about, they're your bog-standard extras really. The features about Mandy Moore and Trent Ford talking about their characters are yawn-inducing, there's 2 music videos, deleted scenes, and a commentary. The music videos are cool, although with these artists who gets songs on movie soundtracks, you never really hear from them again.This is definitely a movie to be watched again & again, if you can ignore the impulse to leap into the screen and cut Macon's hair (just call him Malcolm, it makes it easier), you'll be laughing, crying, and looking for someone to hug throughout.",4,Makes you go all mushy & gooey inside,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,3256,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'movie', 'while', 'now', 'mainly', 'cos', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'watching', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'want', 'hate', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'knickers', 'quite', 'badly', 'more', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Saved', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'character', 'was', 'real', 'cow', 'was', 'blonde', ""n't"", 'suit', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'kinda', 'reminded', 'when', 'was', 'school', 'whole', 'image', 'always', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'films', ""'ve"", 'found', 'film', 'really', 'shone', 'almost', 'believed', 'was', 'Halley.Mandy', 'Moore', 'first', 'came', 'attention', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'pop', 'star', 'trying', 'get', 'fans', 'here', 'UK', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'name', 'one', 'songs', 'cos', 'ca', ""n't"", 'came', 'round', 'same', 'time', 'Jessicas/Christinas/Britneys', 'time', 'really', 'got', 'shoved', 'side', 'So', 'instead', 'turned', 'acting', 'beginning', 'make', 'name', 'herself.I', 'sat', 'watching', 'movie', 'mainly', 'cos', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'watch', 'having', 'been', 'up', '8:30', 'day', 'could', ""n't"", 'muster', 'energy', 'do', 'much', 'else', 'had', 'blanket', 'snuggly', 'warm', 'nibbling', 'chocolate', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'long', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', '2', 'parts', 'mainly', 'cos', 'so', 'much', 'crammed', 'film', 'feel', 'exhausted', 'time', 'was', 'energised', 'wanting', 'do', 'something', 'be', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'best', 'movie', 'yet', 'hated', 'hair', 'extensions', 'beginning', 'hated', 'male', 'lead', 'more', 'sec', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'just', 'seemed', 'click', 'playing', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'brilliant.Trevor', 'Ford', 'who', 'played', 'stupidly', 'named', 'Macon', 'who', 'kid', 'Macon', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'hair', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'whole', 'look', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'scream', 'out', 'What', 'getting', 'nerves', 'now', 'movies', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'not', 'really', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'always', 'not', 'good', 'looking', 'too', 'much', 'pretty', 'boy', 'not-old-enough-to-shave-yet', 'look', 'opinion', 'not', 'good', 'look', 'just', 'seemed', 'pop', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'real', 'consistency', 'character.Alexandra', 'Holden', 'who', 'Halley', 'best', 'friend', 'also', 'appeared', 'episodes', 'Friends', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'was', 'really', 'subplot', 'seemed', 'pop', 'up', 'inconsistently', 'as', 'well', 'disappeared', 'entire', 'middle', 'film', 'just', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'one', 'point', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'was', 'terrific', 'playing', 'dad', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'trying', 'be', 'young', 'cool', 'failing', 'miserably.The', 'extras', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'writing', ""'re"", 'bog-standard', 'extras', 'really', 'features', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Trent', 'Ford', 'talking', 'characters', 'are', 'yawn-inducing', '2', 'music', 'videos', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'cool', 'artists', 'who', 'songs', 'movie', 'soundtracks', 'never', 'really', 'hear', 'again.This', 'definitely', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'can', 'ignore', 'impulse', 'leap', 'screen', 'cut', 'Macon', 'hair', 'just', 'call', 'Malcolm', 'easier', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'crying', 'looking', 'someone', 'hug']",N/A

Despite having a bad script and bad directing, all of the actors are likable and the story is charming. The biggest problem I have with the story though is the relationship between Mandy Moore and the guy. She's willing to have sex with him early on without even being in love.

I love Dessen's books, and thought that making a movie out of one of the books would be a disaster, let alone combining two. Boy was I wrong! HOW TO DEAL is a great teen movie.Halley isn't sure what to believe...her life is incredibly messed up at the moment, and everthing keeps getting crazier. The day her parent's divorce comes through, her sister announces her engagement. Of course Halley doesn't like her future brother-in-law, and she runs to her best friend Scarlett for help. Except, Scarlett doesn't have the same opinion about love. She's fallen head over heels for Michael, a cute, athletic boy. In fact, Halley meets him when she walks in on him and Scarlett...professing their love for eachother.Of course, tragedy strikes soon, and - once again - Halley's life has taken another turn. She meets Macon, token bad boy, and they start hanging out...Scarlett doesn't know what to think when she finds out that she's pregnant, Halley's mom thinks all men are horrible, Halley's dad's getting remarried to &quot;The Bimbo,&quot; and Halley's sister is about to get married.HOW TO DEAL is such a cute teen movie, I can't say enough to justify the movie. It's not realistic, it's predictable, it's cheesy - but somehow it's still fun.
