I noticed that you rarely saw Seagal's face doing the action... like there was a double doing most of his martial arts. And there wasn't that many martial arts in this movie compared to his other movies. And the really weird thing about this movie was the constant narration (I assume from Seagal's main character) but it didn't sound like Seagal to me. It was whispery like he whispers, but even more so. Though Seagal seems to get quieter and more whispery with every picture, his narration and even his main character lines were delivered too quietly for me to understand. I don't know if they couldn't get the mic levels up high enough to capture what he was saying or just that he was mumbling.

1420002,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B004MLEYUU,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[23, 25]","I wish I could meet Steven Seagal, not only to ask for his autograph but also to sit down with him and discuss what's made his recent string of movies so disappointing for even a devoted fan like me. I would use ""Born to Raise Hell"" here as an example, being sure to compliment the film's strengths but also making clear to him exactly what about it sucks. I'm not so nave to believe that Seagal is in total creative and technical control of each of his features, but perhaps I could convince him to take a more hands-on role in their production and perhaps aikido-chop the idiots who are truly responsible for the lackluster nature of some of these movies.The plot: an international drug task force operating out of Romania, headed by ex-Interpol agent Samuel Axel (Seagal), sets its sights on bringing down the operations of a deadly and sadistic gang of drug traffickers...People who don't like Steven Seagal by default are going to hate this movie. Seagal occupies most of the scenes (perhaps still making up for his absence throughout most ofAgainst the Dark?) and his character is boisterous, arrogant, and most of the other characters cow to him in one way or another. Surprisingly, I found myself appreciating this: a supercilious Steven is still more fun to watch than the detached, bored-looking dope he played for a while in movies likeFlight of Fury. However, whatever effort he seems to have made for this film is marred by extensive dubbing of his voice - something not present in his movies to this degree since the picture I just mentioned. There aren't any other real technical snafus to be seen, but further post-production add-ins like nonstop slow motion, freeze-frame shots galore, and way too many time-killing collage scenes continue to have the movie feeling more like Seagal's trash pictures of yesteryear, moving him further and further away from the high standard he had achieved withUrban Justice.The action scenes are composed mostly of boring shootouts, but there are a couple hand-to-hand encounters which, while not too flashy, feature Seagal doing just about all of his own moves and getting some good aikido throws in. There's also an impressive instance wherein he kicks a thug so hard that the man flies about six feet through the air before crashing through a bench. These lead up to the finale with martial artist Darren Shahlavi, who had been running around the rest of the picture as the necrophilic, drug-dealing main villain. This is where things get *really* disappointing, to the point of costing my rating an entire star. Shahlavi had consistently delivered great physical performances in the past, and one of his most recent movies -Ip Man 2, released on the same day as ""Born to Raise Hell"" - featured him in some very good fights with Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung; in this one, however, he has one very brief fight halfway through the film before getting absolutely manhandled by Seagal during the climax. The fact that Shahlavi had just been in an internationally-acclaimed martial arts masterpiece makes this ugly and one-sided encounter more disappointing than Seagal's similar exchanges withGary DanielsandByron Mann: at least they didn't have any recent major successes behind them to live up to.At this point in our conversation, if I had been able to speak freely and if the rumors concerning Seagal's temper and ego were true, I figure he'd either have left the room in disinterest or he would have me by my throat. I'd quickly try to point out that the acting is decent in general and, despite being shot in Romania, the film's cinematography is less grey than I expected and pretty fun to look at...but would this be enough to save me? It certainly isn't enough to save the movie, which I fear can be shelved along with the growing number of failed DTV outings starring the Buddhist Bonecrusher. I doubt that I'll ever actually have this conversation with Steven, but I'm still holding out on the hope that he's going to get back on the horse and make it worth being a fan of his again; right now, it really isn't.",2,"""You're not supposed to hit somebody while I'm holding him""",1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,4069,"['wish', 'could', 'meet', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'not', 'only', 'ask', 'autograph', 'also', 'sit', 'down', 'discuss', 'what', 'made', 'recent', 'string', 'movies', 'so', 'disappointing', 'even', 'devoted', 'fan', 'would', 'use', 'Born', 'Raise', 'Hell', 'here', 'example', 'being', 'sure', 'compliment', 'film', 'strengths', 'also', 'making', 'clear', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'nave', 'believe', 'Seagal', 'total', 'creative', 'technical', 'control', 'features', 'perhaps', 'could', 'convince', 'take', 'more', 'hands-on', 'role', 'production', 'perhaps', 'aikido-chop', 'idiots', 'who', 'are', 'truly', 'responsible', 'lackluster', 'nature', 'movies.The', 'plot', 'international', 'drug', 'task', 'force', 'operating', 'Romania', 'headed', 'ex-Interpol', 'agent', 'Samuel', 'Axel', 'Seagal', 'sights', 'bringing', 'down', 'operations', 'deadly', 'sadistic', 'gang', 'drug', 'traffickers', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'default', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'movie', 'Seagal', 'most', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'still', 'making', 'up', 'absence', 'most', 'ofAgainst', 'Dark', 'character', 'boisterous', 'arrogant', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'cow', 'one', 'way', 'Surprisingly', 'found', 'appreciating', 'supercilious', 'Steven', 'still', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'detached', 'bored-looking', 'dope', 'played', 'while', 'movies', 'likeFlight', 'Fury', 'However', 'effort', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'marred', 'extensive', 'dubbing', 'voice', 'something', 'not', 'present', 'movies', 'degree', 'picture', 'just', 'mentioned', 'are', ""n't"", 'other', 'real', 'technical', 'snafus', 'be', 'seen', 'further', 'post-production', 'add-ins', 'nonstop', 'slow', 'motion', 'freeze-frame', 'shots', 'galore', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'time-killing', 'collage', 'scenes', 'continue', 'have', 'movie', 'feeling', 'more', 'Seagal', 'trash', 'pictures', 'yesteryear', 'moving', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'high', 'standard', 'had', 'achieved', 'withUrban', 'Justice.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'composed', 'mostly', 'boring', 'shootouts', 'are', 'couple', 'hand-to-hand', 'encounters', 'not', 'too', 'flashy', 'feature', 'Seagal', 'doing', 'just', 'own', 'moves', 'getting', 'good', 'aikido', 'throws', 'also', 'impressive', 'instance', 'wherein', 'thug', 'so', 'hard', 'man', 'six', 'feet', 'air', 'crashing', 'bench', 'lead', 'up', 'finale', 'martial', 'artist', 'Darren', 'Shahlavi', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'running', 'around', 'rest', 'picture', 'necrophilic', 'drug-dealing', 'main', 'villain', 'where', 'things', 'get', '*really*', 'disappointing', 'point', 'costing', 'rating', 'entire', 'star', 'Shahlavi', 'had', 'consistently', 'delivered', 'great', 'physical', 'performances', 'past', 'one', 'most', 'recent', 'movies', '-Ip', 'Man', '2', 'released', 'same', 'day', 'Born', 'Raise', 'Hell', 'featured', 'very', 'good', 'fights', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'one', 'however', 'one', 'very', 'brief', 'fight', 'halfway', 'film', 'getting', 'absolutely', 'manhandled', 'Seagal', 'climax', 'fact', 'Shahlavi', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'internationally-acclaimed', 'martial', 'arts', 'masterpiece', 'ugly', 'one-sided', 'encounter', 'more', 'disappointing', 'Seagal', 'similar', 'exchanges', 'withGary', 'DanielsandByron', 'Mann', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'recent', 'major', 'successes', 'live', 'up', 'to.At', 'point', 'conversation', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'speak', 'freely', 'rumors', 'concerning', 'Seagal', 'temper', 'ego', 'were', 'true', 'figure', ""'d"", 'either', 'have', 'left', 'room', 'disinterest', 'would', 'have', 'throat', ""'d"", 'quickly', 'try', 'point', 'out', 'acting', 'decent', 'general', 'being', 'shot', 'Romania', 'film', 'cinematography', 'less', 'grey', 'expected', 'pretty', 'fun', 'look', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'save', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'shelved', 'growing', 'number', 'failed', 'DTV', 'outings', 'starring', 'Buddhist', 'Bonecrusher', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'actually', 'have', 'conversation', 'Steven', ""'m"", 'still', 'holding', 'out', 'hope', 'going', 'get', 'back', 'horse', 'make', 'worth', 'being', 'fan', 'again', 'right', 'now', 'really', ""n't""]",N/A

Unfortunately, we also get uninspired writing and a slow moving plot. It doesn't start out well when Seagal, in narration, tells us that ""six months ago my partner was killed. I'll find those responsible and bring them to justice"" (approximate quote from memory). Seagal wrote this film and he's written a half dozen films before, so he should know one of the main rules of screenwriting: ""Show, don't tell"". Seagal films by nature, like Arnold films, Stallone films, Dolph Lundgren and Van Damme films, are star vehicles, one man shows. But this one suffers from a weak protagonist. We never get to know or care about Seagal's character and too much time is spent on secondary characters. I felt more sympathy for the Dimitri character, played by Dan Badarau. Towards the end of the film, he becomes its real star. First time director Lauro Chartrand is apparently an experienced stunt man but not a great director. Strange camera angles and silly jump cuts give the film a cheap, amateurish feeling. There are some action scenes, of course, but they're not that good (mainly shooting scenes, little fighting) and with the dull story we never really care.""Born to Raise Hell"" is decidedly less entertaining than some of Seagal's other recent films.

1420007,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004MLEYUU,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","We watch Seagal films because the acting is bad, the dialouge is worse, and the plot twists have the complexity a granny knot. Seagal plays a special international DEA agent who seeks revenge for the death of his partner, something we don't know anything about as there is absolutely no character build-up or introduction, a characteristic of Seagal's fine precise writing ability. (It's an action film, stupid!)Seagal is in Bucharest, Romania according to the writing on the screen. They also use the same font to run their credits (Highlight, right click, font, click, then change). The Russian mafia is manufacturing and fronting drugs to the Romanians, who in turn use beautiful women to mule these drugs all over Europe. Apparently their airport security is like ours and only pat down old people. Seagal has a new partner who he verbally abuses. The Romanian mafia also does home break-ins where they rob people and then rape and kill women, not necessarily in that order. (The Russian mafia is civilized and don't approve of that behavior.)Special effects include speeding up the scene, slowing down the scene, shooting a still, and making everything blurry. While other movies do this also, this film tended to overdue the effect to the point of being annoying. The music got a little hard-core as the film flirted with a few grindhouse techniques. It was almost as if someone describe what a grindhouse movie was to Seagal, and he decided to make one having never seen one.Seagal utilizes a stooly who looks like a cross between Joe Pesci  and Vlad the Impaler. In the movie and IMDB Seagal's name is Bobby Samuels. My DVD box says he is Samuel Axel.Seagal has a girlfriend in this movie, who he lectures as if she is four years old. They have a weird love/sex scene where she gets naked and he keeps his clothes on...which may be a good thing.Nudity, sex?, rape, f-bomb and some dry humor lines from Seagal.",3,RAPING WOMEN BEFORE OR AFTER THEY'RE DEAD,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,1917,"['watch', 'Seagal', 'films', 'acting', 'bad', 'dialouge', 'worse', 'plot', 'twists', 'have', 'complexity', 'granny', 'knot', 'Seagal', 'special', 'international', 'DEA', 'agent', 'who', 'revenge', 'death', 'partner', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'absolutely', 'character', 'build-up', 'introduction', 'characteristic', 'Seagal', 'fine', 'precise', 'writing', 'ability', 'action', 'film', 'stupid', 'Seagal', 'Bucharest', 'Romania', 'according', 'writing', 'screen', 'also', 'use', 'same', 'font', 'run', 'credits', 'Highlight', 'right', 'click', 'font', 'click', 'then', 'change', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'manufacturing', 'fronting', 'drugs', 'Romanians', 'who', 'turn', 'use', 'beautiful', 'women', 'mule', 'drugs', 'Europe', 'Apparently', 'airport', 'security', 'ours', 'only', 'pat', 'down', 'old', 'people', 'Seagal', 'new', 'partner', 'who', 'verbally', 'Romanian', 'mafia', 'also', 'home', 'break-ins', 'where', 'rob', 'people', 'then', 'rape', 'kill', 'women', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'civilized', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'behavior', 'Special', 'effects', 'include', 'speeding', 'up', 'scene', 'slowing', 'down', 'scene', 'shooting', 'still', 'making', 'everything', 'blurry', 'other', 'movies', 'do', 'also', 'film', 'tended', 'overdue', 'effect', 'point', 'being', 'annoying', 'music', 'got', 'little', 'hard-core', 'film', 'flirted', 'few', 'grindhouse', 'techniques', 'was', 'almost', 'someone', 'describe', 'what', 'grindhouse', 'movie', 'was', 'Seagal', 'decided', 'make', 'one', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'one.Seagal', 'stooly', 'who', 'cross', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'movie', 'IMDB', 'Seagal', 'name', 'Bobby', 'Samuels', 'DVD', 'box', 'Samuel', 'Axel.Seagal', 'girlfriend', 'movie', 'who', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'weird', 'love/sex', 'scene', 'where', 'naked', 'clothes', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'thing.Nudity', 'sex', 'rape', 'f-bomb', 'dry', 'humor', 'lines', 'Seagal']",N/A

1420009,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B004MLEYUU,trebe,"[0, 0]","With a screenplay written by Steven Seagal, the gritty crime drama Born to Raise Hell (2010), has some issues, but it is still probably one of Seagal's better releases in recent years.  The film features some pretty solid action scenes, and a reasonably plausible story involving agents pursing drug dealers in Bucharest, Romania.  Of interest to Seagal fans, although featuring dizzying quick cuts, slow motion shots, and some occasional body doubling, Seagal appears to do much of his own fighting, and actually gives one of his better, minimally pretentious acting performances.American Bobby Samuels (Seagal) is with the International Drug Task Force (IDTF), which is trying to get a handle of the drug scene in Bucharest.  Samuels and his partner Steve (D. Neil Mark) are after a man named Costel (Darren Shahlavi), who along with his gang, is responsible for a string of home invasions and murders.  Besides robbery, Costel also deals drugs out of a nightclub he owns.  Dimitri (Dan Badaru) is a wealthy high end drug dealer, who has recently become associated with Costel.  He runs a high tech drug lab, with beautiful women processing his product.  Eventually, the criminals have a falling out, and Costel makes a strike against Dimitri.  This leads to an unlikely partnership where Samuels is asked to look the other way, so Dimitri can get revenge, while Samuels brings the case to a bloody conclusion.  Costel and Dimitri are both murderous drug dealers, but one somehow becomes regarded as a ""man of honor"" at the end.Continuing to shoot movies in Eastern Europe, Seagal is probably pretty well regarded there, as a provider of many employment opportunities.  There may not be a lot of familiar names in the cast, but they do a pretty good job, particularly Darren Shahlavi, Dan Badaru, and Claudiu Bleont, who has a minor role as crook.  There are a good number of beautiful women, many in their first film, some nudity, and typical for a Seagal film, lots of scenes in a nightclub, including some fire breathing performers.As a member of law enforcement, Bobby Samuels is a slightly more credible character, than some of the lone wolf types Seagal often plays.  His character still goes berserk, but there's generally a little more believability in the situations you see, with fewer witty one-liners.  Samuels has a girlfriend, so there are no female partners, or awkward romantic entanglements on the job, which helps keep the focus on the central story.Seagal may not be a brilliant writer, particularly when it comes to dialog, and he is at times self-indulgent, and occasionally wanders off track, but overall he does a decent enough job in Born To Be Bad.  While there are many ridiculous elements, the story holds together fairly well, which is rather unusual for a Seagal shoot `em up.  Making stylized violence a priority, stunt performer turned director Lauro Chartrand, does a serviceable job in his first effort.  While the quality of Seagal's recent direct to video releases may be spotty, this is one of his stronger efforts.",3,Steven Seagal leads the war on drugs in Romania...,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,3053,"['screenplay', 'written', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'gritty', 'crime', 'drama', 'Born', 'Raise', 'Hell', '2010', 'issues', 'still', 'probably', 'one', 'Seagal', 'better', 'releases', 'recent', 'years', 'film', 'pretty', 'solid', 'action', 'scenes', 'reasonably', 'plausible', 'story', 'involving', 'agents', 'pursing', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Bucharest', 'Romania', 'interest', 'Seagal', 'fans', 'featuring', 'dizzying', 'quick', 'cuts', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'occasional', 'body', 'doubling', 'Seagal', 'do', 'much', 'own', 'fighting', 'actually', 'one', 'better', 'minimally', 'pretentious', 'acting', 'performances.American', 'Bobby', 'Samuels', 'Seagal', 'International', 'Drug', 'Task', 'Force', 'IDTF', 'trying', 'get', 'handle', 'drug', 'scene', 'Bucharest', 'Samuels', 'partner', 'Steve', 'D.', 'Neil', 'Mark', 'are', 'man', 'named', 'Costel', 'Darren', 'Shahlavi', 'who', 'gang', 'responsible', 'string', 'home', 'invasions', 'murders', 'robbery', 'Costel', 'also', 'drugs', 'nightclub', 'Dimitri', 'Dan', 'Badaru', 'wealthy', 'high', 'end', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'recently', 'become', 'associated', 'Costel', 'high', 'tech', 'drug', 'lab', 'beautiful', 'women', 'processing', 'product', 'Eventually', 'criminals', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'Costel', 'strike', 'Dimitri', 'unlikely', 'partnership', 'where', 'Samuels', 'asked', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'Dimitri', 'can', 'get', 'revenge', 'Samuels', 'case', 'bloody', 'conclusion', 'Costel', 'Dimitri', 'are', 'murderous', 'drug', 'dealers', 'one', 'somehow', 'regarded', 'man', 'honor', 'end.Continuing', 'shoot', 'movies', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Seagal', 'probably', 'pretty', 'well', 'regarded', 'there', 'provider', 'many', 'employment', 'opportunities', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'lot', 'familiar', 'names', 'cast', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'particularly', 'Darren', 'Shahlavi', 'Dan', 'Badaru', 'Claudiu', 'Bleont', 'who', 'minor', 'role', 'crook', 'are', 'good', 'number', 'beautiful', 'women', 'many', 'first', 'film', 'nudity', 'typical', 'Seagal', 'film', 'lots', 'scenes', 'nightclub', 'including', 'fire', 'breathing', 'performers.As', 'member', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Bobby', 'Samuels', 'slightly', 'more', 'credible', 'character', 'lone', 'wolf', 'types', 'Seagal', 'often', 'character', 'still', 'berserk', 'generally', 'little', 'more', 'believability', 'situations', 'see', 'fewer', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'Samuels', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'female', 'partners', 'awkward', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'job', 'keep', 'focus', 'central', 'story.Seagal', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'particularly', 'when', 'dialog', 'times', 'self-indulgent', 'occasionally', 'wanders', 'track', 'overall', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'Born', 'Be', 'Bad', 'are', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'elements', 'story', 'together', 'fairly', 'well', 'rather', 'unusual', 'Seagal', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'Making', 'stylized', 'violence', 'priority', 'stunt', 'performer', 'turned', 'director', 'Lauro', 'Chartrand', 'serviceable', 'job', 'first', 'effort', 'quality', 'Seagal', 'recent', 'direct', 'video', 'releases', 'may', 'be', 'spotty', 'one', 'stronger', 'efforts']",N/A
