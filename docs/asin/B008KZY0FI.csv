It is a worthy topic but could be done in a much better format.The acting is generally good but cannot save the film from being at best pedestrian.  Finally, the credits are 6-minutes long.

1569753,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B008KZY0FI,J from NY,"[2, 2]","""Leave"" is a film within a film, so it's a bit difficult to explain it's profundity without ruining it.  It's a bit unnecessarily grim once you figure out the jist of writer Henry Harper's (Rick Gomez)  dilemma, but then again, this kind of thing has to shown realistically.  Frank John Hughes gives a fantastic and understated performance as a very important figure in Henry's life.  While I still can't say what, exactly, the home invasion was about (did that actually happen?), the spiritual lesson that the film provides is more than than enough to make up for the loose ends.  If we love something, we love it enough to stop clinging fearfully to it.  We love it enough to let it go.  And in this movie, that's a tall order indeed considering what's at stake.  A must see for those who enjoy a serious reflection on the human condition.(If you're watching this for Brian Cranston, don't.  He's in it for about five minutes.)",4,Stop clinging,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,929,"['Leave', 'film', 'film', 'bit', 'difficult', 'explain', 'profundity', 'ruining', 'bit', 'unnecessarily', 'grim', 'once', 'figure', 'out', 'jist', 'writer', 'Henry', 'Harper', 'Rick', 'Gomez', 'dilemma', 'then', 'again', 'kind', 'thing', 'shown', 'realistically', 'Frank', 'John', 'Hughes', 'fantastic', 'understated', 'performance', 'very', 'important', 'figure', 'Henry', 'life', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'exactly', 'home', 'invasion', 'was', 'did', 'actually', 'happen', 'spiritual', 'lesson', 'film', 'more', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'love', 'something', 'love', 'enough', 'stop', 'clinging', 'fearfully', 'love', 'enough', 'let', 'go', 'movie', 'tall', 'order', 'indeed', 'considering', 'what', 'stake', 'must', 'see', 'who', 'enjoy', 'serious', 'reflection', 'human', 'condition', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Brian', 'Cranston', 'do', ""n't"", 'five', 'minutes']",N/A
1569754,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B008KZY0FI,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[3, 3]","Leave follows Henry, a successful writer, who has been haunted by the same nightmare for 6 months. In order to decode the dream, Henry decides to leave to his isolated 2nd home and work on a new novel. While traveling, he runs into a strangely familiar drifter at a diner; a stranger with information that shocks Henry and has the potential to change his life. Leave is a captivating and well-told film, although you may have seen it before.Leave's story is captivating and interesting; it has engaging dialogue/conversations, and some great twists. However, if you've seen films like this before, you may be able to guess the main twist a long way before the end, since it isn't completely original; regardless, I won't spoil it. The story moves at a very fast pace, working solely off its dialogue, which is impressive. Leave uses its time wisely, and is over before you know it. (the film is 1hr 13 minutes without credits.) And, although it may be a bit predicable, the ending reveals some very powerful and relatable themes; it's an ending that can give you chills. The acting in this film was exceptional, a lot better than I expected; I should note, if you're watching this for Bryan Cranston, you'll most likely be disappointed as he appears for less than 5 minutes, but he does show his versatility.Overall, Leave tells a familiar story, with a twist you've likely seen before. However, it still manages to immerse the viewer through its captivating dialogue, it has great performances and a thoughtful meaning, and, at only about 1hr 13 minutes, the film kills time effectively. As of 3/22/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.Leave has some strong violence and blood.",4,"A captivating and well-told film, although you may have seen it before...",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,1758,"['Leave', 'Henry', 'successful', 'writer', 'who', 'been', 'haunted', 'same', 'nightmare', '6', 'months', 'order', 'decode', 'dream', 'Henry', 'leave', 'isolated', '2nd', 'home', 'work', 'new', 'novel', 'traveling', 'strangely', 'familiar', 'drifter', 'diner', 'stranger', 'information', 'Henry', 'potential', 'change', 'life', 'Leave', 'captivating', 'well-told', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'before.Leave', 'story', 'captivating', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'dialogue/conversations', 'great', 'twists', 'However', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'guess', 'main', 'twist', 'long', 'way', 'end', ""n't"", 'completely', 'original', 'regardless', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'story', 'moves', 'very', 'fast', 'pace', 'working', 'solely', 'dialogue', 'impressive', 'Leave', 'time', 'wisely', 'over', 'know', 'film', '1hr', '13', 'minutes', 'credits', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'predicable', 'ending', 'reveals', 'very', 'powerful', 'relatable', 'themes', 'ending', 'can', 'give', 'chills', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'exceptional', 'lot', 'better', 'expected', 'should', 'note', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'less', '5', 'minutes', 'show', 'versatility.Overall', 'Leave', 'familiar', 'story', 'twist', ""'ve"", 'likely', 'seen', 'before', 'However', 'still', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'captivating', 'dialogue', 'great', 'performances', 'thoughtful', 'meaning', 'only', '1hr', '13', 'minutes', 'film', 'kills', 'time', 'effectively', '3/22/13', 'film', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Streaming', 'purchase', 'recommended', 'fans', 'genre', 'rental', 'otherwise.Leave', 'strong', 'violence', 'blood']",N/A
1569755,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B008KZY0FI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Leave (Robert Celestino, 2011)The bad news: I'm trying to be more aggressive about not letting review sit too long anymore, so I'm going through the header backlog and trying to at least start a whole bunch of reviews that have been sitting and waiting for me to write them for months. I was scrolling through the list and I came to the header for Leave. And I didn't remember a damn thing about it, based on title, director, and release date. On the other hand, the good news: when I looked the movie up at IMDB and checked the plot summary, I remembered everything I had initially wanted to say about the movie by the time I'd read the first half of the first sentence. Which should point you to the predictable ending of this review, much as the opening scenes of Leave point you to the movie's similarly-predictable ending. Leave is not a particularly bad film, though it is not, either, a particularly good film. Much of the reason for this is that, primarily, it is a safe film. It treads ground that has been trod many times by many other movies, but it does not do so in a way that distinguishes it either for good or ill.Plot: Henry Harper (Sin City's Rick Gomez) is a novelist. After a recent piece of nastiness (a home invasion), he's started having a recurring nightmare. His therapist (The Conjuring's Ron Livingston) suggests, reasonably, &#8220;hey, you're a novelist, write it out.&#8221; So Henry decides to pack up his life, head for his remote second home in the middle of nowhere, and write a thriller based on actual events. On the way there, he stops at a roadside diner that you have seen in about a dozen films (literally, it's the same one) that is weirdly deserted except for Chris (Righteous Kill's Frank John Hughes). Henry thinks Chris is a stranger...but Chris doesn't think the same, and he knows more than enough about Henry's life to convince Henry that, yes, something is amiss here.And by this point, you should know exactly what that is because, as I said before, you have already seen this movie a few times. (I didn't realize it until I was writing that synopsis, but there is actually a very obvious parallel with a much more famous movie, and if it became obvious to you as well while reading that, I apologize.) Given that, there's nothing wrong with killing an hour and a half with this one, if that sort of woozy-spiritual-drama-thriller is up your alley, but you won't be missing out on the Great American Celluloid if you decide you've got better things to watch. ** ",3,Matzoh.,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,2512,"['Leave', 'Robert', 'Celestino', '2011', 'bad', 'news', ""'m"", 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'aggressive', 'not', 'letting', 'review', 'sit', 'too', 'long', 'anymore', ""'m"", 'going', 'header', 'backlog', 'trying', 'least', 'start', 'whole', 'bunch', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'write', 'months', 'was', 'scrolling', 'list', 'came', 'header', 'Leave', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'damn', 'thing', 'based', 'title', 'director', 'release', 'date', 'other', 'hand', 'good', 'news', 'when', 'looked', 'movie', 'up', 'IMDB', 'checked', 'plot', 'summary', 'remembered', 'everything', 'had', 'initially', 'wanted', 'say', 'movie', 'time', ""'d"", 'read', 'first', 'half', 'first', 'sentence', 'Which', 'should', 'point', 'predictable', 'ending', 'review', 'much', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Leave', 'point', 'movie', 'similarly-predictable', 'ending', 'Leave', 'not', 'particularly', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'either', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'Much', 'reason', 'primarily', 'safe', 'film', 'ground', 'been', 'trod', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'way', 'either', 'good', 'ill.Plot', 'Henry', 'Harper', 'Sin', 'City', 'Rick', 'Gomez', 'novelist', 'recent', 'piece', 'nastiness', 'home', 'invasion', 'started', 'having', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'therapist', 'Conjuring', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'reasonably', '8220', 'hey', ""'re"", 'novelist', 'write', '8221', 'Henry', 'pack', 'up', 'life', 'head', 'remote', 'second', 'home', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'write', 'thriller', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'way', 'there', 'roadside', 'diner', 'have', 'seen', 'dozen', 'films', 'literally', 'same', 'one', 'weirdly', 'deserted', 'Chris', 'Righteous', 'Kill', 'Frank', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Henry', 'Chris', 'stranger', 'Chris', ""n't"", 'think', 'same', 'more', 'enough', 'Henry', 'life', 'convince', 'Henry', 'yes', 'something', 'amiss', 'here.And', 'point', 'should', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'because', 'said', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'writing', 'synopsis', 'actually', 'very', 'obvious', 'parallel', 'much', 'more', 'famous', 'movie', 'became', 'obvious', 'as', 'well', 'reading', 'apologize', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'killing', 'hour', 'half', 'one', 'sort', 'woozy-spiritual-drama-thriller', 'up', 'alley', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'Great', 'American', 'Celluloid', 'decide', ""'ve"", 'got', 'better', 'things', 'watch', '**']",N/A
