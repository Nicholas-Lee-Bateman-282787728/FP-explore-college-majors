466294,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,6305480869,Armando M. Mesa,"[32, 38]","What a straightforward, action packed flick this was with no confusing sidebar twists or excess baggage plots.  This is the first film I've seen Gibson portray a character only described as a good-bad guy. This time he  has the upperhand (most of the time) and does a bit of the damage control;  It's always the real bad guys that get that privelage. Without giving away  too much of the film's minor portion of comical slapstick, there is one  scene where Gibson's character Porter is repeatedly slapped in the back of  the head by one of the movie's shadier characters (this is a funny scene,  especially when America remembers a time when Mel was US Magazine's Sexiest  Man Alive in the past). His dead panned expressions and deep serious voice  let the bad guys know he is not kidding around. Lucy Liu, from Ally McBeal  fame, turns in one of the most kinkiest performances without actually using  any nudity ! She adds quite a sensational spark to the movie.  All in all,  from the previous mixed reviews, people should take it for what it is; A  typical action/comedy/drama flick done Mel Gibson style !Mel's antics rate  top 5 stars and the story rates 3 stars. It was also a real hoot to see  some old Hollywood heavyweights: James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson, and  William DeVane.

466295,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,6305480869,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[2, 2]","This 1999 noir owes alot to its genre predecessors that were prevalent during the late 60's and most of the 70's. Films like Eastwood's Dirty Harry films, Charles Bronson's Death Wish series, and especially Lee Marvin's Point Blank which Payback was a worthy remake.For a first time director, writer Brian Helgeland uses every rule set by past noir films to create Payback. We have a colorful rogues gallery of heavies. Some range from your non-typical femme fatale/dominatrix gangstress Pearl played ably and with relish by Lucy Lui to the three leaders of the so-called ""Outfit"": Kris Kristofferson, William Devane and James COburn. These three actors eat up the time they have on the screen and combined the coolness factor of Payback increases threefold. A special mention of Coburn's Mr. Fairfax character has to be made. His portrayal of the flamboyant gangster makes for alot of funny lines whenever he's on.Another noir plot staple Payback relies on was the revenge factor of the main character against those who he thinks has done him an unforgivable wrong. It's this role that Gibson excels and holds the entire film from falling into self-parody. Mel Gibson is very underrated as an actor and Payback will probably not change that, but if one looked closely his portrayal of Porter throughout the film is very subtle and at the same time direct. We know that Porter is the good guy and Gibson playing him we're convinced from the start, but throughout the film Porter's actions and behavior doesn't distinguish him apart from those other rogues in the film. We may cheer for Porter, but we inwardly we also cringe at some of the stuff he does and does so without hesitation. To Porter what he does is a means to an end. Porter's the lesser of the evils in Payback. Gibson's performance is convincing and believable.Lastly, Payback's dialogue sounds like it could've been lifted from an old Bogart and Cagney noir. Helgeland's script is very lean and memorable. It seems that almost every character gets a chance to have a small exposition about the life of crime. Where L.A. Confidential (Helgeland also wrote the script for that fine film) was a serious take on the noir genre, Payback has an almost tongue-in-cheek fun angle to it. From the look of the cast and their performance it shows they're having fun.Payback is not the greatest film out there and not even the best and greatest i nthe last 20 years, but it is a fun and enjoyable romp through the noir world that only exists in detective and mystery novels and especially on celluloid.",4,An enjoyable 90's noir film with a 70's edge to it,1091923200,"08 8, 2004",2004,2556,"['1999', 'noir', 'alot', 'genre', 'predecessors', 'were', 'prevalent', 'late', '60', 'most', '70', 'Films', 'Eastwood', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'films', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Death', 'Wish', 'series', 'especially', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Point', 'Blank', 'Payback', 'was', 'worthy', 'remake.For', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'writer', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'rule', 'set', 'past', 'noir', 'films', 'create', 'Payback', 'have', 'colorful', 'rogues', 'gallery', 'heavies', 'range', 'non-typical', 'femme', 'fatale/dominatrix', 'gangstress', 'Pearl', 'played', 'ably', 'relish', 'Lucy', 'Lui', 'three', 'leaders', 'so-called', 'Outfit', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'William', 'Devane', 'James', 'COburn', 'three', 'actors', 'eat', 'up', 'time', 'have', 'screen', 'combined', 'coolness', 'factor', 'Payback', 'increases', 'threefold', 'special', 'mention', 'Coburn', 'Mr.', 'Fairfax', 'character', 'be', 'made', 'portrayal', 'flamboyant', 'gangster', 'alot', 'funny', 'lines', 'on.Another', 'noir', 'plot', 'staple', 'Payback', 'relies', 'was', 'revenge', 'factor', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'done', 'unforgivable', 'wrong', 'role', 'Gibson', 'excels', 'entire', 'film', 'falling', 'self-parody', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'very', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Payback', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'change', 'one', 'looked', 'closely', 'portrayal', 'Porter', 'film', 'very', 'subtle', 'same', 'time', 'direct', 'know', 'Porter', 'good', 'guy', 'Gibson', 'playing', ""'re"", 'convinced', 'start', 'film', 'Porter', 'actions', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'apart', 'other', 'rogues', 'film', 'may', 'cheer', 'Porter', 'inwardly', 'also', 'cringe', 'stuff', 'so', 'hesitation', 'Porter', 'what', 'means', 'end', 'Porter', 'lesser', 'evils', 'Payback', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'convincing', 'believable.Lastly', 'Payback', 'dialogue', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lifted', 'old', 'Bogart', 'Cagney', 'noir', 'Helgeland', 'script', 'very', 'lean', 'memorable', 'almost', 'character', 'chance', 'have', 'small', 'exposition', 'life', 'crime', 'Where', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Helgeland', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'fine', 'film', 'was', 'serious', 'take', 'noir', 'genre', 'Payback', 'almost', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'fun', 'angle', 'look', 'cast', 'performance', ""'re"", 'having', 'fun.Payback', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', 'there', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'greatest', 'i', 'nthe', 'last', '20', 'years', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'noir', 'world', 'only', 'detective', 'mystery', 'novels', 'especially', 'celluloid']",Payback VHS

If you are, then you probably can tell from the reviews the version on this DVD is rather different, especially in its ending.  I have read several of Donald Westlake's Parker (Porter in the movie) novels, as well as having enjoyed Point Blank and some of the other Parker film incarnations.For me, I tend to agree with one of the other reviewers who said it would have been nice to take the theatrically released version of the film and this version and somehow mesh the two.Things I liked about the original released version of 'Payback' were Mel's voice-overs and the blue washed look.  They gave the film a gritty, kind of noir-ish look and feel.  Also, I liked the original soundtrack better, although this new version is almost as good.  Although I did not care for Kris Kristofferson playing Bronson, the character of Bronson in the book ""The Hunter"" was male, and so Sally Kellerman's voice as the head of the Outfit seemed rather out of place.For this version, I did enjoy the added scenes during the first 70% of the film.  I also tended to like the ending in the director's cut compared to the other version.  Go ahead and kill the dog!  As for the money, we don't know if Porter actually got it since we're not sure if Porter makes it or not, which I think would have made a better ending (in the book, Parker does get out alive and even manages to cross paths with the Outfit again).Of all of the Parker novels that have been adapted for the big screen, this one and ""The Outfit"" with Robert Duvall and Joe Don Baker are probably the closest to the original written works.I have to say I am not as pleased as I hoped I would be after seeing this director's cut.  It's not a significant improvement from the previous version.  Yes, it really is like another film, and so I classify it as fairly good in it's own right.",4,"The Hunter, take 2",1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,1920,"[""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'Payback"", 'should', 'be', 'are', 'then', 'probably', 'can', 'tell', 'reviews', 'version', 'DVD', 'rather', 'different', 'especially', 'ending', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'Donald', 'Westlake', 'Parker', 'Porter', 'movie', 'novels', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'Point', 'Blank', 'other', 'Parker', 'film', 'incarnations.For', 'tend', 'agree', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'take', 'theatrically', 'released', 'version', 'film', 'version', 'somehow', 'mesh', 'two.Things', 'liked', 'original', 'released', 'version', ""'Payback"", 'were', 'Mel', 'voice-overs', 'blue', 'washed', 'look', 'gave', 'film', 'gritty', 'kind', 'noir-ish', 'look', 'feel', 'Also', 'liked', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'better', 'new', 'version', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'playing', 'Bronson', 'character', 'Bronson', 'book', 'Hunter', 'was', 'male', 'so', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'voice', 'head', 'Outfit', 'seemed', 'rather', 'place.For', 'version', 'did', 'enjoy', 'added', 'scenes', 'first', '70', '%', 'film', 'also', 'tended', 'ending', 'director', 'cut', 'compared', 'other', 'version', 'Go', 'ahead', 'kill', 'dog', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Porter', 'actually', 'got', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'Porter', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'ending', 'book', 'Parker', 'get', 'out', 'alive', 'even', 'manages', 'cross', 'paths', 'Outfit', 'again', '.Of', 'Parker', 'novels', 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'Outfit', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'are', 'probably', 'closest', 'original', 'written', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'pleased', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'director', 'cut', 'not', 'significant', 'improvement', 'previous', 'version', 'Yes', 'really', 'film', 'so', 'classify', 'fairly', 'good', 'own', 'right']",Payback VHS
466298,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,6305480869,Cubist,"[4, 5]","When Payback was originally released in 1999, it was surrounded by a bit of controversy when it was reported that the studio was not happy with writer/director Brian Helgeland's original cut and with Mel Gibson's approval, the actor filmed a new third act with the addition of Kris Kristofferson to the cast. This version was not that well received as audiences were put off by the cast of generally unlikable characters. However, over the years, bootleg copies of Helgeland's original rough cut began to circulate among fans of the film that revealed a significantly different version. Surprisingly, Paramount has allowed the filmmaker to revisit his film and release his version on DVD.Helgeland sets the tone right from the start with a 1970s style font for the opening credits and the old school musical score that evokes Don Siegel's crime films from the 1960s and `70s. Helgeland even names an establishment Varrick's after Siegel's heist movie,Charley Varrick. He is clearly a fan of `70s era crime films as Porter's ruthless methods to find Val echo the same cutthroat methods Robert Duvall employs inThe Outfit, another adaptation of a Stark novel (actually the sequel to The Hunter).Helgeland presents a world populated by corrupt cops, weasely fixers, hookers with hearts of gold and sadistic gangsters - all the hallmarks of an uncompromising crime film. This version of Payback is a vast improvement over the theatrical release with the voiceover removed and the implausible ending changed. Also gone is Kris Kristofferson and his whole subplot including the prerequisite Gibson torture scene. The new ending is much more fitting and consistent with the rest of the movie. It is great to see Helgeland's vision finally seeing the light of day and this once flawed movie restored to its much more superior version free from the meddlesome tampering of studios and test screenings.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Brian Helgeland. The filmmaker explains that he could never change the ending of his movie because it was always intended to be an homage to the ending of Cool Hand Luke (1967). He talks about and defends the decisions he made in the film. This is an insightful and informative track with Helgeland pointing out what is new in this cut of the film.""Paybacks are a Bitch"" takes a look at the making of the film at the location shooting in Chicago and Los Angeles. This extra takes us through the production with new interviews with Helgeland, Gibson, Unger and key crew members with an excellent, in-depth look at how it all came together.""Same Story - Different Movie, Creating Payback: The Director's Cut"" examines how this new version came together. Originally, the studio was expecting an accessible, Lethal Weapon-style movie and wanted to change the ending. Gibson went along with the studio but Helgeland refused and walked away from it all while the actor wrote and directed a new ending, a prologue setting up who the character was and voiceover spelling things out. In 2005, Gibson allowed Helgeland to restore his original cut.Finally, there is ""The Hunter: A Conversation with author Donald E. Westlake."" Richard Stark was a pen name for Westlake as he wrote mystery novels annually under his actual name but wrote a lot more material that he wanted to publish. So, he ended up writing stripped down crime novels for men. He talks about the creation of the Parker character (Porter in the film), the origins of the Richard Stark moniker and some of the movie adaptations of his work.",5,"Payback: The Director's Cut -- ""Hubba Hubba""",1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,3534,"['When', 'Payback', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '1999', 'was', 'surrounded', 'bit', 'controversy', 'when', 'was', 'reported', 'studio', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'writer/director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'original', 'cut', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'approval', 'actor', 'filmed', 'new', 'third', 'act', 'addition', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'cast', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'received', 'audiences', 'were', 'put', 'off', 'cast', 'generally', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'However', 'years', 'bootleg', 'copies', 'Helgeland', 'original', 'rough', 'cut', 'began', 'circulate', 'fans', 'film', 'revealed', 'significantly', 'different', 'version', 'Surprisingly', 'Paramount', 'allowed', 'filmmaker', 'revisit', 'film', 'release', 'version', 'DVD.Helgeland', 'tone', 'right', 'start', '1970s', 'style', 'font', 'opening', 'credits', 'old', 'school', 'musical', 'score', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'crime', 'films', '1960s', '70s', 'Helgeland', 'even', 'establishment', 'Varrick', 'Siegel', 'heist', 'movie', 'Charley', 'Varrick', 'clearly', 'fan', '70s', 'era', 'crime', 'films', 'Porter', 'ruthless', 'methods', 'find', 'Val', 'echo', 'same', 'cutthroat', 'methods', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'inThe', 'Outfit', 'adaptation', 'Stark', 'novel', 'actually', 'sequel', 'Hunter', '.Helgeland', 'world', 'populated', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'weasely', 'fixers', 'hookers', 'hearts', 'gold', 'sadistic', 'gangsters', 'hallmarks', 'uncompromising', 'crime', 'film', 'version', 'Payback', 'vast', 'improvement', 'theatrical', 'release', 'voiceover', 'removed', 'implausible', 'ending', 'changed', 'Also', 'gone', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'whole', 'subplot', 'including', 'prerequisite', 'Gibson', 'torture', 'scene', 'new', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'fitting', 'consistent', 'rest', 'movie', 'great', 'see', 'Helgeland', 'vision', 'finally', 'seeing', 'light', 'day', 'once', 'flawed', 'movie', 'restored', 'much', 'more', 'superior', 'version', 'free', 'meddlesome', 'tampering', 'studios', 'test', 'screenings.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'filmmaker', 'could', 'never', 'change', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'always', 'intended', 'be', 'homage', 'ending', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', '1967', 'decisions', 'made', 'film', 'insightful', 'informative', 'track', 'Helgeland', 'pointing', 'out', 'what', 'new', 'cut', 'film', 'Paybacks', 'are', 'Bitch', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'location', 'shooting', 'Chicago', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'extra', 'production', 'new', 'interviews', 'Helgeland', 'Gibson', 'Unger', 'key', 'crew', 'members', 'excellent', 'in-depth', 'look', 'how', 'came', 'together', 'Same', 'Story', 'Different', 'Movie', 'Creating', 'Payback', 'Director', 'Cut', 'how', 'new', 'version', 'came', 'together', 'Originally', 'studio', 'was', 'expecting', 'accessible', 'Lethal', 'Weapon-style', 'movie', 'wanted', 'change', 'ending', 'Gibson', 'went', 'studio', 'Helgeland', 'refused', 'walked', 'away', 'actor', 'wrote', 'directed', 'new', 'ending', 'prologue', 'setting', 'up', 'who', 'character', 'was', 'voiceover', 'spelling', 'things', 'out', '2005', 'Gibson', 'allowed', 'Helgeland', 'restore', 'original', 'cut.Finally', 'Hunter', 'Conversation', 'author', 'Donald', 'E', 'Westlake', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'was', 'pen', 'name', 'Westlake', 'wrote', 'mystery', 'novels', 'annually', 'actual', 'name', 'wrote', 'lot', 'more', 'material', 'wanted', 'publish', 'So', 'ended', 'up', 'writing', 'stripped', 'down', 'crime', 'novels', 'men', 'creation', 'Parker', 'character', 'Porter', 'film', 'origins', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'moniker', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'work']",Payback VHS

It's a powerhouse of a movie that is about one thing:revenge. But not just some pithy little sour note. No. This movie is a kick in the face right off the bat.

Porter used to be a really nice guy, really good criminal too. But now, he's become a force that no one wants to mess with. There are just so many things that make this movie good.

""Payback"" is back, this time the way the director envisioned the film, not the suits. ""You don't make pictures for the elite,"" producer/star Mel Gibson says today, explaining why Paramount and Warner Bros. took the noirish gangland movie away from freshman director Brian Helgeland. After 10 days of reshoots, a new final (third) act was tacked on, voiceover was added a la ""Blade Runner"" and Kris Kristofferson walked on as a new major character. Audiences still were amazed how brutal the Gibson character was when they had to ""Get ready to root for the bad guy,"" as the marketing had it.Same old story about artists and Hollywood, but this time came a happier ending. In 2005, Paramount and Gibson gave Helgeland another shot at the film, eight years after its release. The tapes turned up missing, so Helgeland and his editor recut the film using film. And so we have ""Payback: Straight Up -- the Director's Cut.""Now, this is one hard-boiled movie. Gibson plays a criminal who comes back to town looking for the partner who stole half his loot, and his wife, following a heist. Along the way he single-handedly takes on both the syndicate and Asian drug dealers, slugs a woman (a scene the studios cut), and stirs up a John Woo-like shootout as the bloody finale. Supporting actors Lucy Liu, Gregg Henry and Maria Bello all do fine work.There are multiple DVD extras, including a director's commentary, but the one to catch is the half-hour ""Same Story -- Different Movie,"" all about the film's resurrection. Audio and video are sharp on the DVD -- and better on high definition discs, although in places the colors seem a bit too jacked up for a gritty, bleach-bypass film. ""Payback"" comes from the same book as ""Point Blank"" with Lee Marvin, an even better film from 1969.",4,Mel Gibson's lost kick-butt movie found,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,1891,"['best', 'action', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', ""n't"", 'theaters', 'may', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'Payback', 'back', 'time', 'way', 'director', 'envisioned', 'film', 'not', 'suits', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'pictures', 'elite', 'producer/star', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'today', 'explaining', 'why', 'Paramount', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'took', 'noirish', 'gangland', 'movie', 'away', 'freshman', 'director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', '10', 'days', 'reshoots', 'new', 'final', 'third', 'act', 'was', 'tacked', 'voiceover', 'was', 'added', 'la', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'walked', 'new', 'major', 'character', 'Audiences', 'still', 'were', 'amazed', 'how', 'brutal', 'Gibson', 'character', 'was', 'when', 'had', 'Get', 'ready', 'root', 'bad', 'guy', 'marketing', 'had', 'it.Same', 'old', 'story', 'artists', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'came', 'happier', 'ending', '2005', 'Paramount', 'Gibson', 'gave', 'Helgeland', 'shot', 'film', 'eight', 'years', 'release', 'tapes', 'turned', 'up', 'missing', 'so', 'Helgeland', 'editor', 'recut', 'film', 'using', 'film', 'so', 'have', 'Payback', 'Straight', 'Up', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Now', 'one', 'hard-boiled', 'movie', 'Gibson', 'criminal', 'who', 'back', 'town', 'looking', 'partner', 'who', 'stole', 'loot', 'wife', 'following', 'heist', 'way', 'single-handedly', 'syndicate', 'Asian', 'drug', 'dealers', 'woman', 'scene', 'studios', 'cut', 'up', 'John', 'Woo-like', 'shootout', 'bloody', 'finale', 'Supporting', 'actors', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Gregg', 'Henry', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'do', 'fine', 'are', 'multiple', 'DVD', 'extras', 'including', 'director', 'commentary', 'one', 'catch', 'half-hour', 'Same', 'Story', 'Different', 'Movie', 'film', 'resurrection', 'Audio', 'video', 'are', 'sharp', 'DVD', 'better', 'high', 'definition', 'discs', 'places', 'colors', 'seem', 'bit', 'too', 'jacked', 'up', 'gritty', 'bleach-bypass', 'film', 'Payback', 'same', 'book', 'Point', 'Blank', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'even', 'better', 'film', '1969']",Payback VHS
466303,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,6305480869,Hillary,"[4, 4]","I first caught this right at the beginning as it was coming on one of the cable channels, and was hooked into the story instantly.From the opening of Mel having bullets removed from his back by a degenerate drinking the same Whisky he sterilizes with, up until the very end (can't ruin that with a discription in case you've not seen it)...this one kept me riveted. The strangely blue smokey color quality throughout the film, only seems to add to the hard-boiled atmosphere of gritty N.Y.City, heat rising and making a clock ripple in a mirage, letting you know just how hot the action will get.The characters are very well drawn. Porter, our anti-hero, who we find out by flashback how he got to be so determined to get back 70K; is a career criminal who has fine-tuned his craft to an art form. He seems to effortlessly pick pockets, bang out stolen credit cards, and pawn swag for the cash and hardware he needs to obtain his ""share"" in a heist with Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). Val is a man who loves pain, giving it, and getting it too. He is valued by the ""Outfit"" for his ""sadistic lack of compunction"". His domiatrix galpal, portrayed by a hilariously over the top Lucy Liu is similarly inclined. Add 2 crooked DTs and the cab dispatcher/heroin dealer they shake down, plus other assorted amusing ""bad"" guys, all played by well known actors, and you can't miss. John Glover, (maybe you know him as the man who loved to call Roy Scheider ""sport"" in John Frankenhimers ""52 Pick-Up""), has a minor role as William Devanes right hand man, but my favorite cameo was veteran actor James Coburn. After finding out ""Carter"" played by Devane, is dead, he says to Porter, ""Probably better off anyway, poor buck-toothed ba$tard!!"" Hilarious!!  I also loved Lucy, Liu that is, when her Pearl dominatrix character beats up her boytoy Val , and says ""Love you baby, long time"", as she kicks him where no man can take it.Needless to say, a staple I've watched over and over. This is definitely one of my top favorite action movies. It will become one of yours too.If you love the theatrical version, also see the alternative ending directors cut. Personally I think it was wise to re-shoot it with a different ending and alternate characters. Watch and you'll see why.  Interestingly, Porter's narrative which is quite effective, is not present in the directors cut, nor is the blue tint, and the score is different.

466305,A319SKSB556033,6305480869,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[11, 13]","Before studio execs and Mel Gibson got all uppity with Brian Helgeland, Payback was a darker, meaner film. But after an apparently poor test screening in 1997(honestly, what IS the point of these?) they put Payback on hold for over a year so Mel could do Lethal Weapon 4 before going back for some re-shoots, with a new director, to make the film happier.So they approved a script of a dark, moody revenge thriller, green-lighted it for production and changed their minds to make it lighter because a ragtag audience didn't understand/like it? Man, Hollywood is one weird town.The resulting film, which was eventually released in 1999, seemed a bit tacked together. There were scenes that just seemed out of place and irregular. It was obvious that any scene actually shot back in 1997 was shot on location and any scene shot for the 1999 cut was just shot in the generic 'street set' on the Warner back-lot. Despite all of this, Payback was still a fun film that failed to go all the way with it's concept.The new DC is a superior version, no doubt and is about 33% different. There are new scenes and odds and ends through out the running time and the last act is completely different. Kris Kristoffersen is gone and replaced by Sally Kellerman (voice only, Bronson is never seen). James Coburn and John Glover also have smaller roles. The narration from Porter is gone as well as the blue tint to most of the film. Now most scenes are just lit as normal without any post-production filtering.There is also a new musical score. The jazzy feel to the opening scenes is still there but through-out the rest of the film the score is more atmospheric and understated. Both are as good as each and fit the differing tones, so there's no better of the two.It does end a bit abruptly and without any truly satisfying conclusion. I guess this is what annoyed test audiences. But a disgruntled audience should not be a decision-making committee when it comes to making movies.The HD DVD is in glorious 2.4:1 1080p with Dolby Digital+ sound and loads of extras.",4,"Seventy grand, I want it back",1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,2053,"['studio', 'execs', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'got', 'uppity', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'Payback', 'was', 'darker', 'meaner', 'film', 'apparently', 'poor', 'test', 'screening', '1997', 'honestly', 'what', 'point', 'put', 'Payback', 'hold', 'year', 'so', 'Mel', 'could', 'do', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '4', 'going', 'back', 're-shoots', 'new', 'director', 'make', 'film', 'happier.So', 'approved', 'script', 'dark', 'moody', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'green-lighted', 'production', 'changed', 'minds', 'make', 'lighter', 'ragtag', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand/like', 'Man', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'weird', 'town.The', 'resulting', 'film', 'was', 'eventually', 'released', '1999', 'seemed', 'bit', 'tacked', 'together', 'were', 'scenes', 'just', 'seemed', 'place', 'irregular', 'was', 'obvious', 'scene', 'actually', 'shot', 'back', '1997', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'scene', 'shot', '1999', 'cut', 'was', 'just', 'shot', 'generic', ""'street"", 'set', 'Warner', 'back-lot', 'Payback', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'failed', 'go', 'way', 'concept.The', 'new', 'DC', 'superior', 'version', 'doubt', 'about', '33', '%', 'different', 'are', 'new', 'scenes', 'odds', 'ends', 'running', 'time', 'last', 'act', 'completely', 'different', 'Kris', 'Kristoffersen', 'gone', 'replaced', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'voice', 'only', 'Bronson', 'never', 'seen', 'James', 'Coburn', 'John', 'Glover', 'also', 'have', 'smaller', 'roles', 'narration', 'Porter', 'gone', 'as', 'well', 'blue', 'tint', 'most', 'film', 'Now', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'lit', 'normal', 'post-production', 'filtering.There', 'also', 'new', 'musical', 'score', 'jazzy', 'feel', 'opening', 'scenes', 'still', 'rest', 'film', 'score', 'more', 'atmospheric', 'understated', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'fit', 'differing', 'tones', 'better', 'two.It', 'end', 'bit', 'abruptly', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'guess', 'what', 'annoyed', 'test', 'audiences', 'disgruntled', 'audience', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'decision-making', 'committee', 'when', 'making', 'movies.The', 'HD', 'DVD', 'glorious', '2.4:1', '1080p', 'Dolby', 'Digital+', 'sound', 'loads', 'extras']",Payback VHS

466311,A2R164STV36F6C,6305480869,Julian Pope,"[1, 1]","Theatrical Cut Review:Payback is a hard boiled, neo-noir crime thriller with comical and satirical elements, featuring a great Mel Gibson character and a straight up revenge plot. The movie has a very cold and dark feel to it along with a gritty film look that sets the tone for the story.It's filled with lots of great cliche's and archetype characters along with smart mouthed dialogue which helps distinguish it from your run of the mill revenge flick. The story is about a man, Porter, who gets two timed and will now do anything necessary to get back $70,000 (not $130,000) that should rightfully be his. Payback is entertaining and a must watch for fans of Mel Gibson.",4,Mel Makes Them Pay,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,674,"['Theatrical', 'Cut', 'Review', 'Payback', 'hard', 'boiled', 'neo-noir', 'crime', 'thriller', 'comical', 'satirical', 'elements', 'featuring', 'great', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'straight', 'up', 'revenge', 'plot', 'movie', 'very', 'cold', 'dark', 'feel', 'along', 'gritty', 'film', 'look', 'tone', 'story.It', 'filled', 'lots', 'great', 'cliche', 'archetype', 'characters', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'dialogue', 'distinguish', 'run', 'mill', 'revenge', 'flick', 'story', 'man', 'Porter', 'who', 'two', 'timed', 'will', 'now', 'do', 'anything', 'necessary', 'get', 'back', '70,000', 'not', '130,000', 'should', 'rightfully', 'be', 'Payback', 'entertaining', 'must', 'watch', 'fans', 'Mel', 'Gibson']",Payback VHS
466312,A16X61RLY1YJL7,6305480869,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[28, 34]","&quot;Payback&quot; hails back to the seventies type movies where rooting for the bad guy is the whole point of the movie and it works quite successfully in this first-rate film.  Mel Gibson does an terrific job of playing the bad guy that you really want to root for.  Fair warning to the light of heart and young ones though, for this film is not for them.  Sticking with Mel Gibson's type of film making, the realism in this film is astonishing and could be considered rather shocking.Given that this is an entirely different type of movie for Mel Gibson in which he is the hero of the film but his character isn't quite the &quot;hero&quot; type, I found his performance to be exceptional, but then again, name a film where his performance wasn't exceptional.  Maria Bello of &quot;ER&quot; fame stars as Mel Gibson's love interest and she performs quite well in this film.  Gregg Henry who plays the &quot;true&quot; bad guy of the film and he does a great job of playing the extraordinarily sadistic mafia &quot;wannabe.&quot;  Kris Kristofferson plays the &quot;mob&quot; boss of the film.  Lucy Alexis Liu performs quite &quot;scarily&quot; as the masochistic/sadistic call girl with some interesting associates.This is the first film from Director Brian Helgeland that I've seen and he certainly deserves a great amount of praise for bringing the novel &quot;The Hunter&quot; by Richard Stark to the silver screen and DVD format.  This film is certainly the last of its type in the twentieth century!  The sound track for the film matches perfectly with the entire &quot;feel&quot; and atmosphere of the film, greatly enhancing the experience.The premise:Mel Gibson plays Porter who, while being little more than a common criminal is not so much a common criminal as the film unfolds.  As the film opens Porter is retelling the recent events of his life after he's been shot and has now recovered enough to make his way back to New York City and he's on a mission.  We soon learn that he and Val Resnick had planned and executed the robbery of $130,000 from a Chinese organized crime group and that when it came time to divide the money between himself and his wife and Val, Val had been conspiring with Porter's wife, showing her a picture of Porter and Rosie (Maria Bello).  Porter's wife shoots him in the back.  He's now recovered and he's coming to town, looking for his $70,000 and to kill Val Resnick.What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most brilliant films of its type where Mel Gibson brings his style of acting to the forefront where he can throw in some well placed and funny lines in the most serious of situations for his character.I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre as you will soon find that it bears many viewings quite easily and all the way through you'll be &quot;rooting for the bad guy.&quot;  {ssintrepid}Special Features:There's not much to look for here when it comes to the Special Features for &quot;Payback.&quot;  In the end though, this DVD is about the movie and that's what you get, in all its glory!-  2 Theatrical Trailers-  Behind the Scenes Featurette",5,Payback - A truly enjoyable film!,1065312000,"10 5, 2003",2003,3142,"['quot', 'Payback', 'quot', 'back', 'seventies', 'type', 'movies', 'where', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guy', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'quite', 'successfully', 'first-rate', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'terrific', 'job', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'really', 'want', 'root', 'Fair', 'warning', 'light', 'heart', 'young', 'ones', 'film', 'not', 'Sticking', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'type', 'film', 'making', 'realism', 'film', 'astonishing', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'rather', 'shocking.Given', 'entirely', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'hero', 'film', 'character', ""n't"", 'quite', 'quot', 'hero', 'quot', 'type', 'found', 'performance', 'be', 'exceptional', 'then', 'again', 'name', 'film', 'where', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'exceptional', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'quot', 'ER', 'quot', 'fame', 'stars', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'love', 'interest', 'quite', 'well', 'film', 'Gregg', 'Henry', 'who', 'quot', 'true', 'quot', 'bad', 'guy', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'extraordinarily', 'sadistic', 'mafia', 'quot', 'quot', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'quot', 'quot', 'boss', 'film', 'Lucy', 'Alexis', 'Liu', 'quite', 'quot', 'scarily', 'quot', 'masochistic/sadistic', 'call', 'girl', 'interesting', 'associates.This', 'first', 'film', 'Director', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'certainly', 'great', 'amount', 'praise', 'bringing', 'novel', 'quot', 'Hunter', 'quot', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'silver', 'screen', 'DVD', 'format', 'film', 'certainly', 'last', 'type', 'twentieth', 'century', 'sound', 'track', 'film', 'matches', 'perfectly', 'entire', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'greatly', 'enhancing', 'experience.The', 'premise', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Porter', 'who', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'common', 'criminal', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'common', 'criminal', 'film', 'unfolds', 'film', 'Porter', 'retelling', 'recent', 'events', 'life', 'been', 'shot', 'now', 'recovered', 'enough', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'mission', 'soon', 'learn', 'Val', 'Resnick', 'had', 'planned', 'executed', 'robbery', '130,000', 'Chinese', 'organized', 'crime', 'group', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'divide', 'money', 'wife', 'Val', 'Val', 'had', 'been', 'conspiring', 'Porter', 'wife', 'showing', 'picture', 'Porter', 'Rosie', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Porter', 'wife', 'shoots', 'back', 'now', 'recovered', 'coming', 'town', 'looking', '70,000', 'kill', 'Val', 'Resnick.What', 'nothing', 'short', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'films', 'type', 'where', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'style', 'acting', 'forefront', 'where', 'can', 'throw', 'well', 'placed', 'funny', 'lines', 'most', 'serious', 'situations', 'character.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'many', 'viewings', 'quite', 'easily', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'quot', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guy.', 'quot', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'not', 'much', 'look', 'here', 'when', 'Special', 'Features', 'quot', 'Payback.', 'quot', 'end', 'DVD', 'movie', 'what', 'get', 'glory', '2', 'Theatrical', 'Trailers-', 'Scenes', 'Featurette']",Payback VHS

And make no doubt about it; Mel's a thieving, conniving, murderous thug, but what makes you root for him is his dogged determination to get what is rightfully his.  This film is a throwback to the old gangster dramas, along the  lines of old Cagney films, but it's much more brutal and vicious.  It's  full of great moments, and Mel never once steps out of character making his  performance that much more believable.  Even Kris Kristofferson's good in  it, and that's sayin' somethin'!  Throw in the luscious Lucy Liu and you've  got a good flick.  Still don't think Mel can pull off playing a scumbag?  See this one and be proved wrong.  As James Coburn states in the film,  &quot;Man, you're just mean!&quot;  My favorite part of the movie is the  first ten minutes, as Mel goes from being bleeding and busted to having a  good suit, a pocket full of money and a credit card, and it's all 'cause  he's a slick S.O.B.

466314,A1I9B4PSCDDWOO,6305480869,"lordhoot ""lordhoot""","[9, 10]","Well, for once we have a movie that really is a new cut according to the director's wishes and not just add on to the movie. This is a superb hard hitting Mel Gibson movie that won a lot of fans when it was released. It seems to get better with age. No need to waste time time going over the plot since anyone reading this would know it already. But now, we have an ""original"" version of this film on this DVD. This DVD edition of Payback is considerably different from the version we saw in the theaters as well as the DVD that came out since then (in 1999 I believe). Not only the last 30% of the movie have been totally altered but there have been cuts and additions along the first 70% of the film. But the basic story still remains the same, just the plot twists and turned differently.I read that this original version was to have been the version to appears in the theaters but it didn't reviewed well initially so entire last part of the film was reshot, creating Kris Kristofferson's role as the leader of the bad guys and his demise. But in this original, Kristofferson's character never appears and the original concept of a woman boss who is never seen, voiced by Sally Kellerman according to the credits and the ending is totally different from the theaterial version. Outside of the outright changes in the scenes, the blue tint of the theaterial version have been removed as well as Mel Gibson's voice over.I watched both movies back to back just to see which one I like the best. I hate to write this but I had a hard time making up my mind on this. Both versions are pretty good and each version, ironically, carried great deal of merits. I really wish that both versions could be merge into one!! This is really subjective depending on the viewer's taste and understanding of the movie. But if I have to pick, I would perfer the theaterial version because its darker, more tighter and I like seeing Kris Kristofferson in a meaty role. The theater's version also put a finale to the story while the ""original"" version leave a loose ends since that female boss is still out there seeking payback of her own. Above all the theater's version make Porter more human and vulnerable while the ""original"" version make him more slick and super agent like.But each viewer have to decide on their own on this one. I enjoyed the ""original"" version but maybe not as much as I enjoyed the theater version. Each to his own as they say.I should also say that this ""original"" version is also 11 minutes shorter then the theaterial version, reflecting a shorter ending of the ""original"" to the theaterial version.The DVD come with a well presented quality in its images and sounds. It come with several extras including a very interesting one that tell the story behind the difference between the theaterial version and the ""original"" version. The DVD is well worth the price to pick up by any fan of this film since both versions are pretty good and it matter of taste which one might be better.",4,A definite new cut....,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,2996,"['Well', 'once', 'have', 'movie', 'really', 'new', 'cut', 'according', 'director', 'wishes', 'not', 'just', 'add', 'movie', 'superb', 'hard', 'hitting', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'won', 'lot', 'fans', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'get', 'better', 'age', 'No', 'need', 'waste', 'time', 'time', 'going', 'plot', 'anyone', 'reading', 'would', 'know', 'already', 'now', 'have', 'original', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Payback', 'considerably', 'different', 'version', 'saw', 'theaters', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'then', '1999', 'believe', 'Not', 'only', 'last', '30', '%', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'altered', 'have', 'been', 'cuts', 'additions', 'first', '70', '%', 'film', 'basic', 'story', 'still', 'same', 'just', 'plot', 'twists', 'turned', 'differently.I', 'read', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'version', 'theaters', 'did', ""n't"", 'reviewed', 'well', 'initially', 'so', 'entire', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'reshot', 'creating', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'role', 'leader', 'bad', 'guys', 'demise', 'original', 'Kristofferson', 'character', 'never', 'original', 'concept', 'woman', 'boss', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'voiced', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'according', 'credits', 'ending', 'totally', 'different', 'theaterial', 'version', 'outright', 'changes', 'scenes', 'blue', 'tint', 'theaterial', 'version', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'as', 'well', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'voice', 'over.I', 'watched', 'movies', 'back', 'back', 'just', 'see', 'one', 'best', 'hate', 'write', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'up', 'mind', 'versions', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'version', 'ironically', 'carried', 'great', 'deal', 'merits', 'really', 'wish', 'versions', 'could', 'be', 'merge', 'one', 'really', 'subjective', 'depending', 'viewer', 'taste', 'understanding', 'movie', 'have', 'pick', 'would', 'perfer', 'theaterial', 'version', 'darker', 'more', 'tighter', 'like', 'seeing', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'meaty', 'role', 'theater', 'version', 'also', 'put', 'finale', 'story', 'original', 'version', 'leave', 'loose', 'ends', 'female', 'boss', 'still', 'there', 'seeking', 'payback', 'own', 'theater', 'version', 'make', 'Porter', 'more', 'human', 'vulnerable', 'original', 'version', 'make', 'more', 'slick', 'super', 'agent', 'viewer', 'have', 'decide', 'own', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'version', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'theater', 'version', 'own', 'say.I', 'should', 'also', 'say', 'original', 'version', 'also', '11', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'then', 'theaterial', 'version', 'reflecting', 'shorter', 'ending', 'original', 'theaterial', 'version.The', 'DVD', 'come', 'well', 'presented', 'quality', 'images', 'sounds', 'several', 'extras', 'including', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'tell', 'story', 'difference', 'theaterial', 'version', 'original', 'version', 'DVD', 'well', 'price', 'pick', 'up', 'fan', 'film', 'versions', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'matter', 'taste', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'better']",Payback VHS
466315,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,6305480869,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[10, 12]","What I was hoping for in the director's cut of Payback is extended roles for Maria & Lucy. Lucy is absolutely hilarious in this film, with some great lines (""I need some satisfaction""), and her interaction with Porter (""I have a few minutes"", ""Go boil an egg"") was just magnificent. There is some extension to the scene where Rosie & Porter meet up again, and she gets more of a part in the finale of the film. But Lucy definitely needed more of a role!Having watched both versions of Payback within the same day, I was shocked at how different they are. The original version of Payback is a lot darker, almost black & white in some parts, but this version keeps the colour. The beginning loses the opening of a doctor digging bullets out of Porter's back, and starts with him returning to the city, with no indication of a double-cross just yet until the flashback appears. It also appears to be cut together much better, and give the first few scenes a much quicker feeling. Porter no longer has a voiceover either. The scene with his wife is extended as well, leading to a more brutal confrontation, which leads more into him carrying her into the bedroom. Also, Porter the dog doesn't survive in this version. Big a[...] The torture scenes are also cut from the film, and the boss's son who was originally going to get together with Rosie as his birthday present.The finale is a load better, as in the old version, I did find myself getting bored, but the finale is more abrupt, and unexpected. Maria Bello gets a bigger role in the finale, although it does leave viewers hanging a bit, but I won't spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it yet.The only thing I'm gutted at is the low-class hooker, who Porter approaches when he's looking for Rosie, is completely cut from the film. Which is a shame, as she totally reminded me of the hooker from Pretty Woman that was Julia Robert's roommate. She's funny as well, despite the shortness of her scene.Overall, I have to say I prefer the director's cut of Payback. Sometimes you find with some directors cuts, they tend to go a bit OTT, and keep in all the scenes which really weren't necessary, but this is well edited, and changing the finale was a really good idea. And seeing it in HD is well worth while too, if you can get your hands on it. I do like the idea of having it almost black & white, and I did miss it in this version. But it's well worth seeing if you want a different take on the film.",4,Still wish Maria Bello & Lucy Liu had bigger roles,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,2454,"['What', 'was', 'hoping', 'director', 'cut', 'Payback', 'extended', 'roles', 'Maria', 'Lucy', 'Lucy', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'film', 'great', 'lines', 'need', 'satisfaction', 'interaction', 'Porter', 'have', 'few', 'minutes', 'Go', 'boil', 'egg', 'was', 'just', 'magnificent', 'extension', 'scene', 'where', 'Rosie', 'Porter', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'more', 'part', 'finale', 'film', 'Lucy', 'definitely', 'needed', 'more', 'role', 'Having', 'watched', 'versions', 'Payback', 'same', 'day', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'different', 'are', 'original', 'version', 'Payback', 'lot', 'darker', 'almost', 'black', 'white', 'parts', 'version', 'colour', 'beginning', 'opening', 'doctor', 'digging', 'bullets', 'Porter', 'back', 'returning', 'city', 'indication', 'double-cross', 'just', 'yet', 'flashback', 'also', 'be', 'cut', 'together', 'much', 'better', 'give', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'much', 'quicker', 'feeling', 'Porter', 'no', 'longer', 'voiceover', 'either', 'scene', 'wife', 'extended', 'as', 'well', 'leading', 'more', 'brutal', 'confrontation', 'more', 'carrying', 'bedroom', 'Also', 'Porter', 'dog', ""n't"", 'survive', 'version', 'Big', '[', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'cut', 'film', 'boss', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'get', 'together', 'Rosie', 'birthday', 'present.The', 'finale', 'load', 'better', 'old', 'version', 'did', 'find', 'getting', 'bored', 'finale', 'more', 'abrupt', 'unexpected', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'bigger', 'role', 'finale', 'leave', 'viewers', 'hanging', 'bit', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'seen', 'only', 'thing', ""'m"", 'gutted', 'low-class', 'hooker', 'who', 'Porter', 'when', 'looking', 'Rosie', 'completely', 'cut', 'film', 'Which', 'shame', 'totally', 'reminded', 'hooker', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'was', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'roommate', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'shortness', 'scene.Overall', 'have', 'say', 'prefer', 'director', 'cut', 'Payback', 'Sometimes', 'find', 'directors', 'cuts', 'tend', 'go', 'bit', 'OTT', 'keep', 'scenes', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'well', 'edited', 'changing', 'finale', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'idea', 'seeing', 'HD', 'well', 'worth', 'too', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'do', 'idea', 'having', 'almost', 'black', 'white', 'did', 'miss', 'version', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'want', 'different', 'take', 'film']",Payback VHS
466316,A1HUX7WN8E65R3,6305480869,MJH,"[11, 13]","My brother and I love the theatrical cut because of the dark humor throughout the film.  To the director's cut credit, we always thought the kidnapping part of the rich son was stupid.  So we watched this D.C. last night and we were both disappointed.  My problem w/ the d.c. is that eliminates a lot of the dark humor.  The new score is a more serious one which doesn't mix well with the exsiting parts that were funny or the subtle things all the actors did to give it a ""smart-a**"" feel.  The new voice over for Kris Kristoffersen's character, Bronson, is done by a woman.  The new scene with William Devane (Jack Bauer's nemesis) & Porter on the phone with Bronson, doesn't work for me.  She sounds like grandma acting ticked off rather than a ""head boss"".  It gets dumber when she's on  speakerphone w/ James Coburn.  She's says Porter has hit the ""end of the road"" and will go nowhere in one breath.  Then Porter shoots the alligator bags, while Bronson thinks it was Fairfax, and then she just gives in and says Ok, you  win pretty much.  Again, another ""smart-a**"" Porter part they cut was the toe torture scene.The ending is totally different.  I didn't mind the newer one but it was the ""everyday"" shootout.  I miss the old phone trick and him blowing the car up with ciggy.  I don't see how the theatrical cut was any happier but for us it was funnier & a little less melodramatic.On the HD-DVD side of things: this disc shares the same problem as my Sleepy Hollow HD-DVD.  Horrible digital noise.  It's like watching the creepy crawlies all over people's faces and the blurred out backgrounds (on a 56"" RPTV).

466320,A1F72LRP98VC96,6305480869,Ollie,"[20, 23]","For me the first version of Payback, interfered with by the hand of (Mad)Mel is the much superior version of this dark, violent and gritty movie. This feels like to me to be another case of Superman II syndrome. Film fanatics harp on for years about how great it could have been had it not been interfered with and then when we finally see a version as close as possible to the directors intended vision it comes as somewhat of a disappointment. I bought Payback:-Directors Cut DVD unseen based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon but I now wish I had simply rented first instead of wasting my money. For me, the last third just felt flat. The third act rolled along slowly reducing pace as it went until finally coming to a gentle stop. Porter got his money, but for the audience the sense of achievement felt for what Porter went through in the original to get this money is now gone. I'm sure that had I not seen the original Payback, I still would feel the same way towards the third act in this version. I can also say for certain that this version suffers greatly by the exclusion of Kris Kristofferson as the original Bronson who brought a great sense of villainy to the role as a much larger, threatening character who also builds the anticipation of a confrontation between Bronson and Porter. In this version Bronson is nothing more than a woman's voice on a speaker and even at that injects nothing into the character. As a result she does not come across as someone who would be tough enough to have risen to the top of an organisation such as The Syndicate. Gibson in his version added a voice over monolog, while I can't say that I missed it from this directors cut, given the choice, I would rather have it in than out so I'd score Gibson on that one also. The shutout at the train station also seemed very poorly staged and felt like something you would see on an episode of Criminal Minds or CSI. Helgeland has not proven since Payback that he is in anyway a match for Gibson as a director. Helgeland's follow up to Payback was the somewhat popular but overrated A Knights Tale and the dreadful The Order. Both these movies speak for themselves in my opinion as to who knew best in the case of Payback. Perhaps if Heath Ledger was more of a star, he to might of had words with Helgeland's ability as a director. As for Gibson's version, I'd give it a solid 4 stars and I'd also have to agree with many other reviewers here on Amazon.com rating this directors cut very low. In short I think that Gibson did all the right things with his version and should be commended for doing an excellent job in rescuing this movie from what could have been a very forgettable movie experience even leaning towards losing the audience's attention in the third act to something much superior that can hold its head up as a modern day re-imaging of the great Point Blank with Lee Marvin.

466322,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,6305480869,R. Sardrena,"[2, 2]","After having seen many ""Director's Cuts"" of fondly-remembered films, I'm starting to believe that the producers actually know what they're doing.  ""Payback"" is a good example.  Paid reviewers often deride viewers as cultural cretins if they don't embrace the ""director's vision,"" but that vision is often obviously flawed, and producers (and test audiences) see that.Paid reviewers have put down the theatrical cut of this film as ""vulgar.""  It's no more vulgar than the Director's Cut.  The chief difference between the two versions - and they differ far more than other films' ""D.C.s"" - is the emotional tone.  Whereas the theatrical cut puts a quirky comic edge on Porter's violent journey, the Director's Cut takes a sombre, self-important tack.The score is markedly different; whereas the theatrical version has many '70's pieces which firmly (and humorously) place it in its time, the Director's Cut has grimly moody meandering pieces that does much to establish its darker approach.  The brassy theme music from the theatrical cut is sorely missed, resulting in a duller experience.Paid critics often have predictable tastes: their reaction to voice-overs is one of them. The absence of Gibson's voice-over in the Director's Cut predictably makes the critics curtsy.  The film loses something in its absence though; Gibson's voice-over was well done, took nothing off his character's hard edge, and contributed some nice bits of humor.The director cut out many of the most interesting character bits in the film, thereby lessening its appeal.  His version culminates in a shoot-out which - while competently done - is actually more formulaic and less clever than the end of the theatrical cut.  After his changes, an edgy crime film comedy has become a forgettable crime drama.  No artistic ""higher purpose"" is served by that.",3,A Fair Cut of An Excellent Film,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1833,"['having', 'seen', 'many', 'Director', 'Cuts', 'fondly-remembered', 'films', ""'m"", 'starting', 'believe', 'producers', 'actually', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Payback', 'good', 'example', 'Paid', 'reviewers', 'often', 'deride', 'viewers', 'cultural', 'cretins', 'do', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'director', 'vision', 'vision', 'often', 'obviously', 'flawed', 'producers', 'test', 'audiences', 'see', 'that.Paid', 'reviewers', 'have', 'put', 'down', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'film', 'vulgar', 'more', 'vulgar', 'Director', 'Cut', 'chief', 'difference', 'two', 'versions', 'differ', 'far', 'more', 'other', 'films', 'D.C.s', 'emotional', 'tone', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'quirky', 'comic', 'edge', 'Porter', 'violent', 'journey', 'Director', 'Cut', 'sombre', 'self-important', 'tack.The', 'score', 'markedly', 'different', 'theatrical', 'version', 'many', ""'70"", 'pieces', 'firmly', 'humorously', 'place', 'time', 'Director', 'Cut', 'grimly', 'moody', 'meandering', 'pieces', 'much', 'establish', 'darker', 'approach', 'brassy', 'theme', 'music', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'sorely', 'missed', 'resulting', 'duller', 'experience.Paid', 'critics', 'often', 'have', 'predictable', 'tastes', 'reaction', 'voice-overs', 'one', 'absence', 'Gibson', 'voice-over', 'Director', 'Cut', 'predictably', 'critics', 'curtsy', 'film', 'something', 'absence', 'Gibson', 'voice-over', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'took', 'nothing', 'off', 'character', 'hard', 'edge', 'contributed', 'nice', 'bits', 'humor.The', 'director', 'cut', 'out', 'many', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'bits', 'film', 'thereby', 'lessening', 'appeal', 'version', 'culminates', 'shoot-out', 'competently', 'done', 'actually', 'more', 'formulaic', 'less', 'clever', 'end', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'changes', 'edgy', 'crime', 'film', 'comedy', 'become', 'forgettable', 'crime', 'drama', 'artistic', 'higher', 'purpose', 'served']",Payback VHS
466323,A1ZKVLM2E00KNU,6305480869,Ryan Agadoni,"[13, 16]","A lot of the ""Director's Cuts"" I've seen don't do much to justify their existence.  They have a few ""cut"" scenes dropped in, but most of the time they interrupt the pacing and offer no real change to the film.  The term has become synonymous with ""Unrated Cut"" and comes off as a marketing gimmick to get people to shell out for the same movie again.I haven't seen the original cut of Payback since probably 2000, but I remember enjoying it.  It was a gritty crime film with a good dose of humor and Mel's trademark ""I love being tortured"" shtick.  I rented this director's cut to see how it played, since it was apparently a dramatic difference rather than a few new scenes thrown in here and there.I'd say the new cut is a much better movie than the old one.  It eliminates Mel's narration, which I think greatly improves the way Mel's character is explored.  We get to watch it rather than hear it, so he is now Porter rather than Mel Gibson.  One of the strengths of this character is that we don't fully understand his motivations (see also Point Blank with Lee Marvin); we have the duration of the film to try and understand his code, his principles, and the original narration spoiled the process.Another change is the filtering.  The movie is no longer entirely washed out blue, it's full of warm tones as well as cool.  I like this as well.  It still fits the mood of the movie, and it's more visually pleasing.As for new scenes, I couldn't really tell what was added in.  I could tell what was removed, which was the kidnapping sub-plot, Kris Kristofferson's character, and the subsequent torture and escape.  The new cut features a tidier finale, and the whole movie is actually shorter than the original cut.  It clocks in at around 90 minutes, which works for this story.  I remember liking Porter's escape scene in the original (clawing his way through the backseat), but I think the new cut keeps the pace consistently and serves the story better.It's definitely worth checking out.",5,A Worthwhile Director's Cut,1178582400,"05 8, 2007",2007,1997,"['lot', 'Director', 'Cuts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'justify', 'existence', 'have', 'few', 'cut', 'scenes', 'dropped', 'most', 'time', 'interrupt', 'pacing', 'offer', 'real', 'change', 'film', 'term', 'become', 'synonymous', 'Unrated', 'Cut', 'off', 'marketing', 'gimmick', 'get', 'people', 'shell', 'out', 'same', 'movie', 'again.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'cut', 'Payback', 'probably', '2000', 'remember', 'enjoying', 'was', 'gritty', 'crime', 'film', 'good', 'dose', 'humor', 'Mel', 'trademark', 'love', 'being', 'tortured', 'shtick', 'rented', 'director', 'cut', 'see', 'how', 'played', 'was', 'apparently', 'dramatic', 'difference', 'rather', 'few', 'new', 'scenes', 'thrown', 'here', 'there.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'new', 'cut', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'old', 'one', 'Mel', 'narration', 'think', 'greatly', 'way', 'Mel', 'character', 'explored', 'get', 'watch', 'rather', 'hear', 'now', 'Porter', 'rather', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'One', 'strengths', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'motivations', 'see', 'also', 'Point', 'Blank', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'have', 'duration', 'film', 'try', 'understand', 'code', 'principles', 'original', 'narration', 'spoiled', 'process.Another', 'change', 'filtering', 'movie', 'no', 'longer', 'entirely', 'washed', 'out', 'blue', 'full', 'warm', 'tones', 'as', 'well', 'cool', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'mood', 'movie', 'more', 'visually', 'pleasing.As', 'new', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'added', 'could', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'removed', 'was', 'kidnapping', 'sub-plot', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'character', 'subsequent', 'torture', 'escape', 'new', 'cut', 'tidier', 'finale', 'whole', 'movie', 'actually', 'shorter', 'original', 'cut', '90', 'minutes', 'story', 'remember', 'liking', 'Porter', 'escape', 'scene', 'original', 'clawing', 'way', 'backseat', 'think', 'new', 'cut', 'pace', 'consistently', 'story', 'better.It', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Payback VHS

""cinemaparker@twitter""","[28, 30]","If you're a fan of Payback at all, I think it's imperative that you watch this version not only because of how differently it plays out but because it is a great opportunity to see how a director's vision can be compromised by the studio system.From the very beginning, you know you're in different waters when the tone of the film settles in. They do away with the voice over and there is far less humor in this version. Instead of the blue tinted palatte of the original, this film has a more lush and natural quality to it. The character of Porter (Mel Gibson) in this version is even more brutal and cold blooded, which is a big reason as to why the film was asked to be recut by the studio. I watched both versions back to back and I think I can say that this new version is almost like watching an entirely different movie. I like them both equally and this new version really adds to the experience.That being said, this HD-DVD has several great supplementary features that should make your day. One in particular is a half hour doc that goes into why Brian Helgeland's original cut was rejected by the studio and contains insightful comments by key members of the cast and crew, including Mel Gibson himself who I have to give credit to for being involved with restoring this version and giving a genuinely humbling interview.

However, the further into the movie you get, the less it resembles the theatrical release, and it ends much, much differently.I'm far from disappointed, just very surprised because I didn't know any of the backstory behind the production of this movie.

466327,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6305480869,Trevor Willsmer,"[9, 12]","Remaking a classic is never a good idea at the best of times, but when Brian Helgeland's remake of Point Blank ended up being shelved, heavily re-edited, rewritten (by Terry Hayes) and reshot by another director (production designer John Myhre) to make it more `accessible' to an audience after committing the triple sins of having a hero who doesn't get the money and doesn't get the girl and - worst of all - having a character kill the dog, it must have seemed like an out and out suicidal one. So much of the film's last third was dumped that half the footage in the film's trailer (and even its poster image) were nowhere to be found in the finished film itself by the time it made it to the theatres. Somehow the version of Payback that did get released turned out to be both surprisingly good and more surprisingly commercially successful, but now that, eight years later, Helgeland's finally had the chance to restore his version for DVD, the only response to the theatrical version's tagline `No more Mr Nice Guy' is ""Oh yeah?""This time Mel Gibson's Porter doesn't have a voice over to excuse his actions, and they're not diluted by focus groups either. So he steals from a homeless guy? So what, it's not as if the guy is faking a disability in this cut, he just wants his money. So he asks a barman for information by breaking his hand? So what, he doesn't have time for subtlety, he just wants his money. So his wife O.D.s after he beats her up? So what, she shot him anyway, he just wants his money. So he kills a handcuffed heavy after disarming him? So what, he didn't like the guy, he just wants his money. In fact, Porter doesn't care what happens to anybody as long as he gets his money. The only thing that makes him the hero is that the guy who has his money is even worse than he is.Unlike most Director's Cuts, this really is a very different version of the film: while the first hour has more or less the same structure as the theatrical version, the last third is a significant departure. Running some ten minutes less than the theatrical version, there's no convoluted kidnapping subplot, no Kris Kristofferson character in this version, only a couple of shots of prominently-billed John Glover at the end, though sadly no Angie Dickinson either: although originally providing a link with John Boorman's film as the voice of the syndicate boss in Helgeland's first cut, for some reason she's here replaced by Sally Kellerman on speakerphone. Instead we get a much better realized and rather more organic finale at a transit station that brings the film to a more convincing conclusion and is more attuned to the character's strengths and weaknesses than the kind of plot contrivances that gave the theatrical version its more explosive resolution. Oh yes, and everything doesn't look blue anymore.There are differences from the first cut that Helgeland submitted that was floating around as a bootleg for years - the fire truck diversion to get into the outfit hotel and the infamous elevator scene where Porter blinds a henchman are missing, while this time round the money doesn't end up in the hands of a homeless guy - but while it's a shame these aren't included on the DVD, it's a leaner, meaner movie, playing it down and dirty (none of Boorman's ""Is he really dead?"" ambiguity here) and on its own terms. Is it a great film or a lost masterpiece? No, just a good movie with a heart of darkness underneath the studio sheen, but that's good enough for me.Paramount's DVD is a good package, with a three-part documentary on the making and unmaking of the film (with Gibson surprisingly prominent among the new interviews) and an interview with author Donald E. Westlake that run longer than the main feature itself, as well as an audio commentary by Helgeland.",4,A Director's Cut that draws some real blood for once,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,3790,"['Remaking', 'classic', 'never', 'good', 'idea', 'best', 'times', 'when', 'Brian', 'Helgeland', 'remake', 'Point', 'Blank', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'shelved', 'heavily', 're-edited', 'rewritten', 'Terry', 'Hayes', 'reshot', 'director', 'production', 'designer', 'John', 'Myhre', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'audience', 'committing', 'triple', 'sins', 'having', 'hero', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'money', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'worst', 'having', 'character', 'kill', 'dog', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'out', 'suicidal', 'one', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'last', 'third', 'was', 'dumped', 'footage', 'film', 'trailer', 'even', 'poster', 'image', 'were', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'finished', 'film', 'time', 'made', 'theatres', 'Somehow', 'version', 'Payback', 'did', 'get', 'released', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'more', 'surprisingly', 'commercially', 'successful', 'now', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'Helgeland', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'restore', 'version', 'DVD', 'only', 'response', 'theatrical', 'version', 'tagline', 'No', 'more', 'Mr', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'time', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Porter', ""n't"", 'have', 'voice', 'excuse', 'actions', ""'re"", 'not', 'diluted', 'focus', 'groups', 'homeless', 'guy', 'So', 'what', 'not', 'guy', 'faking', 'disability', 'cut', 'just', 'money', 'barman', 'information', 'breaking', 'hand', 'So', 'what', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'subtlety', 'just', 'money', 'wife', 'O.D.s', 'up', 'So', 'what', 'shot', 'anyway', 'just', 'money', 'handcuffed', 'heavy', 'disarming', 'So', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'guy', 'just', 'money', 'fact', 'Porter', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anybody', 'as', 'long', 'money', 'only', 'thing', 'hero', 'guy', 'who', 'money', 'even', 'worse', 'most', 'Director', 'Cuts', 'really', 'very', 'different', 'version', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'structure', 'theatrical', 'version', 'last', 'third', 'significant', 'departure', 'Running', 'ten', 'minutes', 'less', 'theatrical', 'version', 'convoluted', 'kidnapping', 'subplot', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'character', 'version', 'only', 'couple', 'shots', 'prominently-billed', 'John', 'Glover', 'end', 'sadly', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'originally', 'providing', 'link', 'John', 'Boorman', 'film', 'voice', 'syndicate', 'boss', 'Helgeland', 'first', 'cut', 'reason', 'here', 'replaced', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'speakerphone', 'Instead', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'realized', 'rather', 'more', 'organic', 'finale', 'transit', 'station', 'film', 'more', 'convincing', 'conclusion', 'more', 'attuned', 'character', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'kind', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'gave', 'theatrical', 'version', 'more', 'explosive', 'resolution', 'Oh', 'yes', 'everything', ""n't"", 'look', 'blue', 'anymore.There', 'are', 'differences', 'first', 'cut', 'Helgeland', 'submitted', 'was', 'floating', 'around', 'bootleg', 'years', 'fire', 'truck', 'diversion', 'get', 'outfit', 'hotel', 'infamous', 'elevator', 'scene', 'where', 'Porter', 'henchman', 'are', 'missing', 'time', 'round', 'money', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'hands', 'homeless', 'guy', 'shame', 'are', ""n't"", 'included', 'DVD', 'leaner', 'meaner', 'movie', 'playing', 'down', 'dirty', 'none', 'Boorman', 'really', 'dead', 'ambiguity', 'here', 'own', 'terms', 'great', 'film', 'lost', 'masterpiece', 'No', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'heart', 'darkness', 'studio', 'sheen', 'good', 'enough', 'me.Paramount', 'DVD', 'good', 'package', 'three-part', 'documentary', 'making', 'unmaking', 'film', 'Gibson', 'surprisingly', 'prominent', 'new', 'interviews', 'interview', 'author', 'Donald', 'E.', 'Westlake', 'run', 'longer', 'main', 'feature', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Helgeland']",Payback VHS

The blue filter is gone, so it doesn't look slick and shiny. This film is dark, rich, and grungy. Very ""noir-ish"", and warm.Obviously the running gag through out the first film was that Porter wants his 70k back... not 130k or 1 million, just 70k. This was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it. The first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again.Porter in this film is not charming or smooth. He's smart, violent, and cold. A true anti-hero. The annoying voice over narration is gone. There are several new characters, and several new brutal kills.Minus the credits, this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes.This is a great companion piece to the great ""To Live and Die in L.A.""
