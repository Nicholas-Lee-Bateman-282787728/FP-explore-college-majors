1458146,A1RLJLWEYEUMHU,B005FISC0C,T,"[4, 4]","""Ringer"" quickly became my one favorite shows of the new season.It was nice seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar on my TV again. Although be no means perfect, it was a fun escape to enjoy for an hour each week. I think where they went wrong was they  didn't keep up the pace after the pilot. How they thought slowing things down was a good idea, I'll never know. They should've hit the ground running & kept going. was the show far fetched? Yes. Were the stories campy and over the top? Yes. But that's alright. I hope that there's a wrap-up episode on the DVD when/if it's ever released. Ringer will be missed along with Missing, GCB, etc. Bottom line, Ringer was fun, but flawed.",5,I Enjoyed It While It Lasted...,1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,673,"['Ringer', 'quickly', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'new', 'season.It', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'TV', 'again', 'be', 'means', 'perfect', 'was', 'fun', 'escape', 'enjoy', 'hour', 'week', 'think', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'pace', 'pilot', 'How', 'thought', 'slowing', 'things', 'down', 'was', 'good', 'idea', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'should', ""'ve"", 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'kept', 'going', 'was', 'show', 'far', 'fetched', 'Yes', 'Were', 'stories', 'campy', 'top', 'Yes', 'alright', 'hope', 'wrap-up', 'episode', 'DVD', 'when/if', 'ever', 'released', 'Ringer', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'Missing', 'GCB', 'etc', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Ringer', 'was', 'fun', 'flawed']",Ringer

I so wanted it to be a ""winner"". The show is very well done and the premise was promising but the writing is weak. Gellar is still luminous and I hope she finds a better vehichle. Having said that, here is my ORIGINAL REVIEW: ""She's back and the show is super--great premise, good dialogue, great FX, great cast, costumes, sets, locations, music. Top-of-the-line and Gellar looks absolutely fantastic! What a glorious WOMAN she has become!""  (The foregoing quote was written in Sept 2011. This revision was written in Sept2012.)
