In the first season I never really understood just what was going on, something about a &#34;pattern&#34; in some series of events culminating in Agent Dunham meeting Walter Bishop's old partner William Bell (played by Leonard Nimoy) in an alternate universe. It's a better looking X Files.Second season looked just as good but may have even raised the weirdness level with more strange, not always connected, cases. It ended with a Fringe team crossing to the other universe where they ended up in a battle with the alternate forces and the alternate Olivia taking &#34;our&#34; Olivia's place.Third season is especially confusing, switching back & forth between universes. It turns out Bell was killed in the battle that trapped Olivia &#34;over there&#34; (she does find her way home). I don't even remember when &#34;our&#34; guys figured out &#34;Olivia&#34; but eventually both universes work together to solve some ancient puzzle involving Peter Bishop restoring the disruption caused by Bell & Walter Bishop's early experiments. The season ends with both Fringe teams in a blended lab together getting ready to heal their universes- and then the mysterious bald men in black, the &#34;Observers&#34;, appear to erase Peter from the timeline, he's served his purpose and no one seems to know he's gone. The cliffhanger, pretty much ignored in fourth season, leaves Peter in some future (?- 2036?) battle zone .",4,I like it but.&#8230;,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,1528,"['time', '34', 'wonderfully', 'bizarre', '34', 'series', 'ways', 'harder', 'understand', 'like..', 'first', 'season', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'something', '34', 'pattern', '34', 'series', 'events', 'culminating', 'Agent', 'Dunham', 'meeting', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'old', 'partner', 'William', 'Bell', 'played', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'alternate', 'universe', 'better', 'looking', 'X', 'Files.Second', 'season', 'looked', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'raised', 'weirdness', 'level', 'more', 'strange', 'not', 'always', 'connected', 'cases', 'ended', 'Fringe', 'team', 'crossing', 'other', 'universe', 'where', 'ended', 'up', 'battle', 'alternate', 'forces', 'alternate', 'Olivia', 'taking', '34', '34', 'Olivia', 'place.Third', 'season', 'especially', 'confusing', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'universes', 'out', 'Bell', 'was', 'killed', 'battle', 'trapped', 'Olivia', '34', '34', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'when', '34', '34', 'guys', 'figured', 'out', '34', 'Olivia', '34', 'eventually', 'universes', 'work', 'together', 'solve', 'ancient', 'puzzle', 'involving', 'Peter', 'Bishop', 'restoring', 'disruption', 'caused', 'Bell', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'early', 'experiments', 'season', 'Fringe', 'teams', 'blended', 'lab', 'together', 'getting', 'ready', 'heal', 'universes-', 'then', 'mysterious', 'bald', 'men', 'black', '34', 'Observers', '34', 'appear', 'erase', 'Peter', 'timeline', 'served', 'purpose', 'one', 'know', 'gone', 'cliffhanger', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignored', 'fourth', 'season', 'Peter', 'future', '2036', 'battle', 'zone']",Fringe: S3 (DVD)

The aftertaste is that of a cheap novella and a great suspense. Mixed feelings about it. I do understand that maintaining this type of show interesting is a very difficult task for the crew involved, but it has become a romantic quasi-cheesy show. Still, the acting is superb, the Walters are the best, and Anna Torv is incomparable when impersonating the other-universe Olivia Dunham, which, by the way, it is a true human being when compared to our universe's Dunham.

I didn't watch Fringe until after it was available to stream all 5 seasons...so I didn't get the anticipation of waiting for every new episode to come out. It was different in the case of X-Files. Like much of the x-files fan base, I was waiting for it each week..talking about it the next day. X-Files was a very new type of show with great character development. Where it was a bit weak, and had in my opinion started to unravel..was its inability to stay focused on it's major story arc with a clear vision. I loved the X-Files, still do.Fringe, while it feels familiar, is a very different show. It doesn't focus on the supernatural at all...or on aliens. It does focus on time travel and alternate realities. While that may be the main technical detail that fanboys use to differentiate the shows...I don't think its the big difference. For me, it is really the style of character development that makes them different.If you are looking for a Mulder/Scully comparison, you won't find one. Fringe has a much more developed ensemble driven story. Many characters are given changes to shine and have relevance to the story. Mulder and Scully had a formula between them that is hard to imitate or top. I don't think Fringe tries to do that.John Noble's character of Walter Bishop is amazing. I don't think X-Files has a comparable element. Walter adds an emotional depth to Fringe that is based on deep loss and remorse. His guilt and pain are so profound that we have seen him shattered and fragmented. Even his character alone will draw you into fringe. Mulder's loss of his sister while a good driver for the story of the X-Files canon...is never as deeply felt as Walter's losses.If you liked X-Files, you'll like Fringe I think, as long as you aren't expecting a clone.

The story lines of the first 2 seasons are set, and season 3 builds on and delivers a worthwhile season finale. Particulars are hard to discuss, since the show hit it's stride in season 2 and kept building layers and layers of story. The only real way to understand is to watch the series.The one good thing about Fringe is that the main three characters are connected, and all the events of the show are a result of the characters actions in the past.

1350692,A4BHT5EUI0ZJF,B003L77G2Y,Ashley Cunningham,"[9, 13]","Before I give my review, I have to say that I am a ""Fringe"" fan. Even though I started watching during season 2 and then watching season 1, I quickly fell in love with those two seasons. They had excellent writing, good memorable characters, and a fascinating premise. I was so looking forward to season 3, but my hopes were dashed. The writing went downhill; characters stopped being as memorable; story lines were boring or didn't make any sense at all.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADA big letdown for me was the characters. Olivia used to be interesting, but then she got all angsty, especially when she and Peter had their little spat. Walter used to be funny, but some of his actions and conversations came across as being forced and not as humorous as they used to be. Peter used to have that sarcastic likeableness about him, but I stopped liking him when he failed to differentiate between Olivia and Faux-livia. I have to say that Anna Torv did a very good job at portraying two different people; her demeanor and actions clearly made her two characters different.While the season started off at a good pace, it got bogged down with some of its episodes. The first nine episodes were entertaining, but after that they became rather boring. I recall in seasons 1 and 2 where there were episodes not dealing with the overarching plot, but even then they were interesting. Even ""Earthling"" from season 2, which many fans dislike, was an interesting episode. The cases from season 3 were largely not interesting and dealt with some braniac or psycho trying to do something for good or for revenge. I miss season 1 episodes where several of them dealt with either the Pattern or a psycho experimenting on genetics or weapons who had a connection to the Pattern. Even season 2 had episodes with Newton and the shape-shifters, which were good. These episodes of just random braniacs in season 3 are not very interesting and not very gripping to me. The episode ""Subject 13"" looked like it was meant to be like season 2's ""Peter,"" but it failed to that standard. And ""LSD"" was bizarre and did not really seem to have any point, compared to ""Brown Betty"" which was a little weird but seemed to have a definite purpose in season 2.Another disappointment were the story arcs of season 3. The season 2 finale promised an amazing storyline for season 3, especially with Peter and the doomsday machine and Walternate wanting to destroy the Blue Universe. The story arc, however, I was thought was a good concept but very poorly executed. It moved along at a pace that was way too slow, and too much was left unanswered. The season 3 finale did not tie up the loose ends very well, and I finished the episode thinking to myself ""what the heck just happened? You spent an entire season building up to something, and we get this?"" It was very poor writing, and I was not impressed, which was a shocker for me because I've loved ""Fringe's"" previous season finales. Then there were other minor story arcs that had no point or went on for way too long. The whole Faux-livia infiltrating Blue Universe and falling for Peter while our Olivia is brainwashed in Red Universe was too long and too drawn out; it should have ended earlier. The arc with Olivia hating Peter for sleeping with Faux-livia was rather overdramatic, and I did not sympathize with either side; it also became too dominant in the season where it should have been a more minor side plot. The arc with Bell possessing Olivia was stupid and did not seem to have any point; there was potential for Bell to help Fringe team with his knowledge of the Red Universe, but it was never used. The whole Faux-livia pregnancy arc was very predictable and ultimately did not have much of a point either, except serving as a rather complicated and unnecessary way to get Peter's DNA, Then there was the finale, which was drawn out too long over too many episodes; season 2 finale was much better in that each episode was independent but built up to an amazing finale- not so with season 3.Another problem with the writing was how many threads were dropped. Peter's whole thing with killing the shape-shifters lasted only one episode and was never touched upon again. Alternate Charlie and Lincoln Lee becoming suspicious of Walternate was also brief. Faux-livia's kidnapping was never fully solved and the reasons for it were never given. There were others throughout season 3, but the dropped storylines really bothered me.I had very high hopes for season 2, but I was rather underwhelmed by it. It started off strong, but after a few episodes, I got bored and disappointed with the season.",2,"What happened to ""Fringe?""",1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,4625,"['give', 'review', 'have', 'say',

If one is waiting for a predictable plot line with this bunch, forget it.  I cannot say anything of this season's end other than I did not see this cliff hanger coming at all.  And I am now waiting anxiously to see what happens in season 4 to resolve it.  However, this show is having a viewing problem since it changed to Friday nights, i.e. it has lost viewers, so we might be stuck with incredible cliff hangers overall if the ratings don't increase.  That would be a shame because this show is destined to be a big overall keeper for years to come, much like STAR TREK and the THE X-FILES.Where this show has gone is to increasingly juxtaposition two worlds against one another.  We have to look no further than old SUPERMAN comics to remember the idea that there is more than one universe, that there are alternate universes, with other versions of ourselves on similar paths but their choices cause significant diversions.  A big part of this third season is that Peter romances the Olivia's of BOTH worlds.  This is important because Peter is the pivot around which the two worlds swing since he was stolen from one world to live in the other.Walter Bishop, Peter's father, is a complete creep in one world as its leader and an eccentric, lovable genius in the other.  The latter role remains my favorite in the whole show.  This is where the humor in the show comes in which is much needed as comic relief.If you haven't watched FRINGE yet, I recommend you watch it straight through on DVD or streaming, the three full seasons in order.  This series will be almost impossible to watch out of order as the central story line advances in strict linear fashion.

1350746,A2B5QBSPS1H3T7,B003L77G2Y,dontkickthebaby,"[5, 10]","For the most part, the series returns to its broad story arc of two parallel universes, one of which is our own, racing to destroy the other before being destroyed by the other. And for the most part, it's fast-paced and action-packed. There is also some incredible acting from Anna Torv and John Noble, two actors I'd never heard of before. Each becomes such a different person in the alternate universe. John Noble, especially, tugs at your heart in one universe. He makes you just want to hug his Walter character, pat him on the back and say, ""That's OK. You didn't mean to pull two universes apart."" His quest for scientific knowledge decades ago did just that. And his portrayal of Walternate (get it? Walter + alternate?) makes you wonder how you could ever have any sympathy for such a cold-hearted bastard.But there are still some major flaws in the story-telling that all but ruin the series. There are a lot of bad guys that our heroes, the Fringe unit, have to stop. But all too often they figure out who the bad guy is -- or where he will commit his next act of terrorism -- by going to one brainiac or another and asking him/her to solve the puzzle. Which, of course, the brainiac instantly does by telling her questioners to go on the Internet and cross-reference these two or three databases.Life is really that easy. You can solve all your problems if only you know the two databases you need to call up on the Internet and cross-reference.The other big problem is all the one-episode plots that have absolutely nothing to do with the story arc. The Fringe division is constantly being called away from saving the world to work on strange mysteries that really have no consequence on anything. There is so much time-wasting in this series, I almost wish the show were on a premium cable channel that only required it to put out 12 episodes a year.

And season 3 is arguably the best season.What's to like? You get to see both universes. You get to see Anna Torv and John Noble play both their characters in our universe and their alternates in the other universe. And these aren't 'slight' variations of the characters, these are full-blown characters in their own right with different personalities from their dopplegangers in our universe. And it's not black and white, we can see the complexities and it's not simple to declare who the good guys and bad guys are although Walternate comes closest to being the bad guy. At least, until you see Season 4...Simply put - this show is a tour-de-force and absolutely mind-blowing at times. It is a crime that more people aren't watching it.You could make a case for season 1 (where things were still hidden) and season 2 (where the inter-dimensional war become fully out in the open and secrets were revealed) being better and I'd be hard pressed to argue. I doubt many would argue that the current season 4 is the best but then again with 8 episodes left who knows what the writers will pull on us.

1350773,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003L77G2Y,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Maybe the only boon to arriving late to FRINGE is that there won't be that interminable wait in between seasons. I guess, also, there's no fretting about whether the show'll get canceled or not. In recent weeks I'd been tearing thru the series, heaps of episodes at a time, losing sleep, underperforming at work, sometimes cursing the show for being so crazy good. Season 3 is the best one yet. The closing moments of its final episode (""The Day We Died"") has me super-stoked to start watching Season 4. Except there's that damn thing called a job. And sleep. Do I regret not having glommed on to FRINGE when it was originally airing? Hell, yes.I admire the showrunners for being ambitious and for steering the overarching narrative into a bold new direction. I understand that the ratings were always a shaky thing for the show and that maybe the smart thing would've been to stick to the vanilla that people were expecting. As it were, Season 3 took a gamble. It still focused most on the Fringe divison ""over here,"" except that, every now and then, we got to visit the alternate Fringe division ""over there."" You never could settle into mere monotony with this show. There was always something new and unexpected just around the corner. Massive props to the dynamic cast's performances. Most of them had to juggle dual parts, and it's a marvel that their doppelganger roles came across as distinct and equally sympathetic.I agree with John Noble's mom; the man so deserved an Emmy! Walter, Walternate, past Walter, past Walternate, futuristic even more buggy Walter, futuristic even more menacing Walternate. Noble was simply unbelievable and pushed so many emotional buttons. Admittedly, it took me a bit to warm to Anna Torv, but I'm all in now. This season, she takes on not only two roles but, deep into the season, a third one, as well. That her third iteration doesn't work as well is probably due more to the pointlessness and gimmicky nature of the William Bell story arc. That arc was a waste of a Leonard Nimoy. Still, ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide"" deserves props for trying something different.And then there's maybe the season's most jawdropping scene: Broyles on LSD.Gratifyingly, the dying parallel Earth was explored in depth. Early on, episodes like ""The Plateau"" and ""Amber 31422"" delivered insights into what that world was really like and the desperate people who inhabit it. The first eight episodes (culminating with ""Entrada"") comprehensively built on the show's mythology. Subsequent episodes - the middle bits of the season - did slow down the mythology-building. But the final five episodes - and, yes, that includes ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide"" - whipped the pace back to a frenzy. And then the awesome ""The Day We Died"" reshuffled things yet again.If nothing else, FRINGE has contributed to pop culture in a big way. Credit Walter Bishop for coining a slew of memorable words, from ""Walternate"" to ""Fauxlivia"" to ""Vagenda."" But FRINGE is so much more than words cutely cobbled together. I haven't yet seen the full series but my friends who'd watched the entirety of it assure me that the show never sold out and that it never pandered. Always grounding them themes of insane technology and radicalism and dystopianism and crazy time paradoxes are those strong character beats that invest the viewer. The characters resonate with me. I care about Walter with his kind but mad eyes and buttoned-down Olivia and Peter, him what should never have existed. I haven't mentioned Joshua Jackson until now and how he's done this season. He's done very well. In a way, more than anyone else, he anchors the show. And this season revolves so heavily around him. Even more than Olivia Dunham, he's our point-of-view character. And Joshua Jackson is as good as anyone else here. so now can we have a retroactive vote to save the show?

Abrams, Alex Kurtzman & Roberto OrciHave Fringe seasons one and two on DVD, but this is the first season I purchased on Blu-ray. And it's outstanding!Seasons are getting better (if you can believe that), because it was great from the first get-go.  Love the supernatural incidents, and our cast as the special task force are the one and only people who can deal with it. Also the high tech, supernatural and experimenting is a draw for the sci-fi and mystery fans.Each episode brings you closer to what the mystery of alternate worlds is about, but don't think you've found the answer - you haven't.  That's what keeps you coming back, week after week.  The cast grows every week, with one or the other taking the lead, and our alternate beings from the other side, are like us but not quite, there is that slight difference, that's the beauty of it - tense and downright chilling at times.Our lead characters handle their alternates in a meticulous way with strong acting in every step of the way.  Watching the special features on the Discs gives you the challenges the cast, special effects and stunt people deal with in each episode every week- great stuff, they keep pushing the envelope.As one reviewer has requested and encouraged as many folks to start viewing 'Fringe' live on Fridays.  In closing ... please watch.For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.SPECIAL FEATURES:1. Animating the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Episode.2.

These discs sometimes go blocky and pixelated, looking almost like video streamed over a low bandwidth network connection.

This is the first time I have ever rebought a TV series on BD, but I think &#34;Fringe&#34; is worth it.

1350852,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B003L77G2Y,Patrick Correa,"[1, 2]","Ok, let&#8217;s recap.  I loved the first season of Fringe & while the second season started out rough I still enjoyed most of it, but I thought the switch of Olivia with Fauxlivia at the end was really stupid, much like the replacement of Charlie with a shapeshifter at the start of season 2.  But while that was stupid, at least there were a few good episodes in between the bad ones.  Here though&#8230; I&#8217;m not even going to bother reviewing the first 9 episodes.  The only one I could actually enjoy was episode 49 (6955 KHZ) & even that wasn&#8217;t perfect, just easier to consider as part of my canon.  True, these episodes do have great ideas (like The Plateau&#8217;s monster of the week, a man who can trigger a deadly chain of events, or the beautiful horror of Marionette) & some memorable moments (Walter inheriting Massive Dynamic, the twist in Amber 31422 and Broyles coming face to face with his own corpse in Entrada being my favorites) but the Olivia switch really drags them down, especially in our universe.  Fauxlivia keeping the others from gaining any information reminded me too much of X-Files&#8217; Failure Is The Only Option policy.  While that was frustrating at times it was plausible for the most part, but here on Fringe it&#8217;s never plausible & always frustrating.  A pity, as the idea of switching episodes between universes is a very good idea that deserved better execution.  However, the series gets good again with Firefly, so here&#8217;s a review of that episode & all the ones after it, with synopsizes from the booklet.53.  The Firefly:  Our universe.  Did saving Peter throw the universe off balance?  Walter learns the answer from an Observer and a former rock god who lost his son soon after Walter gained his.  A54.  Reciprocity:  Our universe.  The team comes closer to operating Walternate&#8217;s doomsday machine when they discover its possible power source: Peter.  A55.  Concentrate And Ask Again:  Our universe.  A killer marks a scientist&#8217;s birthday by sending him a rag doll booby-trapped with a bone dissolving power.  A56.Immortality:  The parallel universe.  Fauxlivia and the team investigate the creepy case of bugs that devour humans from the inside out.  Meh, didn&#8217;t really do anything for me, though I&#8217;ve seen worse.  C+57.  6B:  Our universe.  AS Olivia and Peter rebuild their relationship, a grieving widow tries to reclaim hers &#8211; even if it creates a universe devouring vortex.  A+58.  Subject 13:  Our universe.  1985: Walter strives to return a distraught and suspicious Peter to the parallel universe &#8211; using little Olivia as a guide.  It seems like the episodes that take place in the 80s are always are excellent.  Let&#8217;s hope we see more of this in season 4.  I can&#8217;t get enough of the 80s style opening.  A+59.  OS:  Our universe.  Gravity-defying thieves share a connection to a scientist who, like Walter, tampered with the laws of nature in hope of saving his son.  A60.  Stowaway:  Our universe.  Bell, inhabiting Olivia&#8217;s body, has 48 hours to find a new host.  Meanwhile, a woman gifted with eternal life wants only to die.  A+61.  Bloodline:  The parallel universe.  Kidnappers inject mother-to-be Fauxlivia with drugs to hasten the development of her fetus.  Why?  And who&#8217;s behind the abduction?  Who cares?  If a universe has to be destroyed, I hope it&#8217;s this one.  I don&#8217;t particularly like the stories set here it seems.  C62.  Lysergic Acid Diethylamide:  Our universe.  In a last-ditch effort to save Olivia, Wlter, Peter and (accidentally) Broyles take LSD&#8230; and things get trippy.  There&#8217;s a reason this episode has a commentary; it is quite possibly the best episode of the season.  A+63.  6:02 AM EST:  The parallel universe.  Walternate activates the Doomsday machine.  Our universe.  Walter realizes that only his son &#8211; or perhaps God &#8211; can save both worlds.  A64.  The Last Sam Weiss: Our universe.  As chaos erupts, Olivia and Sam search for a key, Walter flies a kite, and Peter takes a mysterious cab ride to New York.  A65.  The Day We Died:  Our universe.  &#8220;I need Walter.&#8221;  In 2026, Peter seeks the help of the most reviled man in the world &#8211; now behind bars &#8211; to save humankind.  An excellent season finale.  A+Since exactly half the episodes were A/A+ I will give this season 3 stars.  For all its faults the show does return to form, and the cliffhanger ending was much better than the last season&#8217;s and ensures I will be watching season 4 (which I already have).  I just hope the show doesn&#8217;t drop in quality again.",3,"As the boundaries between the universes degrade, so does the quality of the stories.

I'm just showing my support by rating it on Amazon. However, if you haven't seen Fringe then I'll just say the show starts off as somewhat of an ""X-Files Lite"" and then grows into something of it's own. You need to start on Season 1 and work your way through the rest of the series. Each season is great but Season 3 is something really unique as from time to time they are showing life in an alternate universe. The actors do a really good job playing alternate versions of their main characters. Especially John Noble as he normally plays a broken scientist who you can't help but feel sorry for, and then in the other universe he's completely opposite acting as the Secretary of Defense in which you grow to despise.The first half of Season 3 was some of the best Fringe has brought us. The second half wasn't as good as it had some really cheesy moments (Olivia channeling William Bell, the cartoon episode, the pregnancy, for example)It's decent Science Fiction. The main downside of the show is that there a lot of ""Monster of the week"" style episodes that add nothing to the overall mythology of the series until the last 5 minutes of the episode.The show is not really as complex as people make it out to be, or want it to be, you just have to watch every season in order to know what's going on. If you are fans of the X-Files or Lost then give this show a shot. If you already watch the show, then please watch it live on TV (especially if you're one of the select few who are actually counted in the ratings).",4,Good Sci Fi,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,1661,"['Ok', 'most', 'reading', 'review', 'probably', 'already', 'watch', 'Fringe', 'wont', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'show', ""'m"", 'just', 'showing', 'support', 'rating', 'Amazon', 'However', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Fringe', 'then', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'show', 'off', 'somewhat', 'X-Files', 'Lite', 'then', 'something', 'own', 'need', 'start', 'Season', '1', 'work', 'way', 'rest', 'series', 'season', 'great', 'Season', '3', 'something', 'really', 'unique', 'time', 'time', 'are', 'showing', 'life', 'alternate', 'universe', 'actors', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'alternate', 'versions', 'main', 'characters', 'Especially', 'John', 'Noble', 'normally', 'broken', 'scientist', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'then', 'other', 'universe', 'completely', 'opposite', 'acting', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'grow', 'despise.The', 'first', 'half', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'best', 'Fringe', 'brought', 'second', 'half', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'had', 'really', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'Olivia', 'channeling', 'William', 'Bell', 'cartoon', 'episode', 'pregnancy', 'example', 'decent', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'main', 'downside', 'show', 'lot', 'Monster', 'week', 'style', 'add', 'nothing', 'overall', 'mythology', 'series', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'episode.The', 'show', 'not', 'really', 'as', 'complex', 'people', 'make', 'be', 'want', 'be', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'season', 'order', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'are', 'fans', 'X-Files', 'Lost', 'then', 'give', 'show', 'shot', 'already', 'watch', 'show', 'then', 'please', 'watch', 'live', 'TV', 'especially', ""'re"", 'one', 'select', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'counted', 'ratings']",Fringe: S3 (DVD)

I thought the season 2 2-part finale was one of the best 2 hours of TV ever, in taking us to the alternate universe and significantly expanding the mythology in a very exciting and believable way.  I was happy to find that season 3 starts off strongly, taking place in the alternate universe.  Without going into spoilers, the highlight of the episode is Ana Torv's acting.In the first 2 seasons Ana Torv did not make much of an impression simply because she came off as very one note---cold and focused.  When given good material to work with, like ""Olivia,"" she is simply amazing, showing the confusion and vulnerability of this character we have been following for 2 seasons.

1350888,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B003L77G2Y,Sean Curley,"[4, 6]","In season one, ""Fringe"" was a good show with obvious potential for greatness.  In season two, the potential was realized.  And now in season three, it continues to advance to new levels, becoming one of the best drama series on television, and definitely my favourite on network television.  It was often said that ""The X-Files"" was better when it focused on standalone episodes instead of its myth arc, but ""Fringe"" is the exact opposite; its improvement has been deeply tied into the development of its complex and rich ongoing story.  Season Three picks up where Season Two left off, and does so superbly.  Spoilers follow.Season Two ended with our Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) trapped in the alternate universe, with her counterpart (generally referred to by fans as Fauxlivia) taking her place on the Fringe team as a spy.  Olivia is at the mercy of Walternate, the alternate version of Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), who is out to prevent the destruction of his universe by destroying ours - though this was all prompted by the actions of our Walter in 1985.  To make matters more complicated, Fauxlivia finds herself in a relationship with Olivia's love interest Peter (Joshua Jackson), while Olivia is brainwashed to temporarily take Fauxlivia's place and enable the other side to gain the secret to how she travels interdimensionally.  And this is all just from the first two or three episodes, out of twenty-two.  There's a tremendous amount happening in ""Fringe"", perhaps more than in any other TV drama series.  By now, this is not a series that can be watched intermittently; it's a commitment (not that that would be an issue if you're buying the DVDs), a heavily-serialized story that plumbs the limts of the plausible and the depths of the human soul with equal skill.  The show effectively has two different worlds running now, each with their own storylines, which interlink in various ways (the ""previouslies"" for each episode valiantly attempt to provide the necessary information to hypothetical first-time viewers).Consider, for instance, the challenges given to Anna Torv this season:  she plays not just Olivia, but also Fauxlivia, who, despite her fan nickname, is a fully realized character, both the same and different from Olivia; and there are a couple of additional variations thrown in over the course of the year for good measure (including a two-episode stint where she does an extended, amusing impression of Leonard Nimoy).  That the Emmys could overlook her work here speaks very poorly of them.  John Noble as Walter does not have quite the same revelatory year as he did last year, but he continues to provide both tragedy and comedy in good measure.  The biggest winner for this season is Joshua Jackson (who is, ironically, the only major castmember not called on to play an alternate version of himself).  If Peter often seemed a bit out of place when ""Fringe"" was mostly a procedural show, he has become absolutely central to its myth arc.  The rest of the cast does good work in supporting parts, occasionally getting their own moments (I'm a fan of a rare moment of comedy from Lance Reddick in episode 19).Highly recommended; I can't wait to see what season four brings.",5,One of TV's best dramas.,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,3213,"['season', 'one', 'Fringe', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'obvious', 'potential', 'greatness', 'season', 'two', 'potential', 'was', 'realized', 'now', 'season', 'three', 'advance', 'new', 'levels', 'becoming', 'one', 'best', 'drama', 'series', 'television', 'definitely', 'favourite', 'network', 'television', 'was', 'often', 'said', 'X-Files', 'was', 'better', 'when', 'focused', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'instead', 'myth', 'arc', 'Fringe', 'exact', 'opposite', 'improvement', 'been', 'deeply', 'tied', 'development', 'complex', 'rich', 'ongoing', 'story', 'Season', 'Three', 'up', 'where', 'Season', 'Two', 'left', 'off', 'so', 'superbly', 'Spoilers', 'follow.Season', 'Two', 'ended', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'trapped', 'alternate', 'universe', 'counterpart', 'generally', 'referred', 'fans', 'Fauxlivia', 'taking', 'place', 'Fringe', 'team', 'spy', 'Olivia', 'mercy', 'Walternate', 'alternate', 'version', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Noble', 'who', 'out', 'prevent', 'destruction', 'universe', 'destroying', 'ours', 'was', 'prompted', 'actions', 'Walter', '1985', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'complicated', 'Fauxlivia', 'relationship', 'Olivia', 'love', 'interest', 'Peter', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Olivia', 'brainwashed', 'temporarily', 'take', 'Fauxlivia', 'place', 'enable', 'other', 'side', 'gain', 'secret', 'how', 'interdimensionally', 'just', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'twenty-two', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'happening', 'Fringe', 'perhaps', 'more', 'other', 'TV', 'drama', 'series', 'now', 'not', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'intermittently', 'commitment', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'issue', ""'re"", 'buying', 'DVDs', 'heavily-serialized', 'story', 'limts', 'plausible', 'depths', 'human', 'soul', 'equal', 'skill', 'show', 'effectively', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'running', 'now', 'own', 'storylines', 'interlink', 'various', 'ways', 'previouslies', 'episode', 'valiantly', 'provide', 'necessary', 'information', 'hypothetical', 'first-time', 'viewers', '.Consider', 'instance', 'challenges', 'given', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'season', 'not', 'just', 'Olivia', 'also', 'Fauxlivia', 'who', 'fan', 'nickname', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'same', 'different', 'Olivia', 'are', 'couple', 'additional', 'variations', 'thrown', 'course', 'year', 'good', 'measure', 'including', 'two-episode', 'stint', 'where', 'extended', 'amusing', 'impression', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Emmys', 'could', 'overlook', 'work', 'here', 'very', 'poorly', 'John', 'Noble', 'Walter', 'not', 'have', 'quite', 'same', 'revelatory', 'year', 'did', 'last', 'year', 'provide', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'good', 'measure', 'biggest', 'winner', 'season', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'who', 'ironically', 'only', 'major', 'castmember', 'not', 'called', 'play', 'alternate', 'version', 'Peter', 'often', 'seemed', 'bit', 'place', 'when', 'Fringe', 'was', 'mostly', 'procedural', 'show', 'become', 'absolutely', 'central', 'myth', 'arc', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'work', 'supporting', 'parts', 'occasionally', 'getting', 'own', 'moments', ""'m"", 'fan', 'rare', 'moment', 'comedy', 'Lance', 'Reddick', 'episode', '19', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'season', 'four', 'brings']",Fringe: S3 (DVD)

So many of the Fringe story lines that at first appear to lead down the proverbial rabbit-hole, are, by the final season, all neatly woven together where everything is explained; we even learn who really was responsible for the events that Walter thinks were cause by him alone.  What makes this series so compelling is the outstanding acting - especially that of John Noble.  His portrayal of the &#34;not-all-there&#34; Walter Bishop and the alternate Walter is amazing to behold.  Why he was never nominated for an Emmy I will never understand other than to say that for some shortsighted reason Hollywood has never given science fiction its due and has summarily dismissed any acting in that genre out-of-hand.  In the final episode of season 5, there is a scene between Walter and Peter that is as poignant as any one might find in a reel of Oscar winning performances.  There are so few programs on television that take the risk of telling a story so &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; - it is refreshing to see one make it all the way to the finish line and to do it so well.

Fruge,"[10, 18]","I know I will take flak from fanatics for giving Fringe only 4 stars, but I have my reasons.First off the good: Fringe is perhaps one of the best Sci-Fi serials to come down the pike in a long time. It has all the potential to become another X-Files, and all of the dangers to fail where Chris Carter did too.Carter became to preoccupied with making his show into a propaganda platform on every conceivable issue, and the shows storyline suffered as a result; and for conservatives like myself, it was especially a turn-off.Another mistake Carter made I see the producers of Fringe beginning to do, is focusing far too much on one character to the detriment of the others. As X-Files became the ""All About Scully Saga"", so too is Fringe in danger of becoming all about Olivia.The best Sci-Fi stories make use of COMMON folk the audience can identify with, and once having established them as such; THEN putting them into nearly unbelievable circumstances.Giving our characters super-natural powers approaching deities will only ruin the story via making suspension of disbelief impossible.On that last point we have the utterly unbelievable circumstance where Walter, still on parole from a Mental Institution, is apparently allowed free reign to go about creating his own cocktails of illegal drugs and regularly consuming them on the show! It truly would be an alternate universe where FBI agents allowed such to take place under their noses. NO, totally unbelievable.With those criticisms, I stand by my 4 star  rating in the hopes the Writers/Producers will improve it.",4,A good show which could be better,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1573,"['know', 'will', 'take', 'flak', 'fanatics', 'giving', 'Fringe', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'have', 'reasons.First', 'good', 'Fringe', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'Sci-Fi', 'serials', 'come', 'down', 'pike', 'long', 'time', 'potential', 'become', 'X-Files', 'dangers', 'fail', 'where', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'did', 'too.Carter', 'became', 'preoccupied', 'making', 'show', 'propaganda', 'platform', 'conceivable', 'issue', 'shows', 'storyline', 'suffered', 'result', 'conservatives', 'was', 'especially', 'turn-off.Another', 'mistake', 'Carter', 'made', 'see', 'producers', 'Fringe', 'beginning', 'do', 'focusing', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'character', 'detriment', 'others', 'X-Files', 'became', 'About', 'Scully', 'Saga', 'so', 'too', 'Fringe', 'danger', 'becoming', 'Olivia.The', 'best', 'Sci-Fi', 'stories', 'make', 'use', 'COMMON', 'folk', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'once', 'having', 'established', 'such', 'THEN', 'putting', 'nearly', 'unbelievable', 'circumstances.Giving', 'characters', 'super-natural', 'powers', 'approaching', 'deities', 'will', 'only', 'ruin', 'story', 'making', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'impossible.On', 'last', 'point', 'have', 'utterly', 'unbelievable', 'circumstance', 'where', 'Walter', 'still', 'parole', 'Mental', 'Institution', 'apparently', 'allowed', 'free', 'reign', 'go', 'creating', 'own', 'cocktails', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'regularly', 'consuming', 'show', 'truly', 'would', 'be', 'alternate', 'universe', 'where', 'FBI', 'agents', 'allowed', 'such', 'take', 'place', 'noses', 'NO', 'totally', 'unbelievable.With', 'criticisms', 'stand', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'hopes', 'Writers/Producers', 'will', 'improve']",Fringe: S3 (DVD)

J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. The series follows a Federal Bureau of Investigation ""Fringe Division"" team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security.The team uses unorthodox ""fringe"" science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe.OK, and before I begin my review, just know that as you yourself watch this captivating TV show on DVD, to keep track of Our world vs. Their world, during the first half of the season, odd-numbered episodes mostly take place in the parallel universe (Their world - and have a red title sequence), while even-numbered episodes mostly take place in the prime universe (Our world - and have the original blue title sequence.)And then, as we progress through, some episodes (such as 'Entrada') have a title sequence as a mixture of blue and red; and since have been either blue or red or both to signify the universal focus of the episode. Oh, and for episode 15, 'Subject 13' it stands alone in these thoughts for it features a same retro title sequence from 'Peter', with Asimov font and an 80s rendition of the theme song!Oh, and for the record, 'The Day We Died' has a grey title sequence to indicate the future setting of the episode.OK, all on track now?! Good, let's continue. In episode one, 'Olivia' we get a flashback to bring us up to date. We see the good Olivia battling in Their world to accept who she is over there and so she tries to find a way home. In 'The Box,' in Our world, the bad Olivia is mixing with everyone as if all was normal, including Peter! A Doomsday device is needed to make a war between the two worlds a reality, but the funniest moment comes when Walter makes a 'silent, but deadly' joke! Also, Dr. Bell (via his Will) leaves him a very nice surprise!In 'The Plateau,' in Their world, a man can create deadly chain reactions to occur, but why are his targets who they are? In 'Do Shapeshifters Dream of Sheep?', in Our world a Senator is exposed as a Shapeshifter and is now targeted for attack. In 'Amber 31422,' in Their world Amber from a sealing is broken into and a body removed. An old character comes back to say hello! In '6955 khz,' in Our world a radio broadcast is deadly to those listening, but why does it speak numbers over and over - and in different languages each time? Astrid stands up to the mathematical plate here in fine style.In 'The Abducted,' in Their world, a child is kidnapped by The Candyman - a person stealing (quite literally) their youth! Peter also gets a BIG message delivered to him! In 'Entrada,' Our world the fate of Olivia is revealed to Peter and the real one (finally) comes home. But, in the Olivia timescape swap, a tragedy befalls someone important in one of the worlds. In 'Marionette,' which is quite easily one of the freakiest episodes I have ever seen on TV, a man puts back together a young girl who committed suicide - organ by once-donated organ!In 'The Firefly,' a brilliant Christopher Lloyd stars as an old rocker from a band that Walter used to love - Violet Sedan Chair! But, his link to Walter runs deeper, way deeper than just music. This episode turns out to be a test set by The Observers. In 'Reciprocity,' the Machine gets built from all the pieces found around the world, but nobody knows how to work it! Walter, trying to regrow back some of the brain that was removed by his counterpart in Their world, tries some Chimp DNA - and so we get a nice moment with a banana split and some ape like gestures! Oh, and Peter becomes a killer! In 'Concentrate and Ask Again,' a toxic biological gas that removes your bones from your body once inhaled is targeting certain people - but why them? A mind reader is brought in and proves to make this an entertaining episode.In 'Immortality,' a man and his skelter beetles are causing havoc and bad Olivia aka ""Fauxlivia"" gets some bad news. In '6B,' another highly entertaining episode, a supposedly haunted building could well be another so-called soft spot for a vortex to come through. As for Peter and the real Olivia, well, they finally get together in Our world! In 'Subject 13,' a flashback episode to 1985, Peter and his wife are still at odds over the child they have - Peter, but not 'their' Peter, which he now suspects - and a freaky mind meld of Good vs. Bad worlds come to the fore.In 'Os,' a liquid metal is stolen to allow a man - the always-great Alan Ruck ('Spin City') to combine with another element to inject into wheelchair-bound people; in the hopes that it will enable them to walk again. Great idea, save for the fact that what he injects them with makes them float!! In 'Stowaway,' Dr. Bell comes back through a ring of a bell, but only his mind, which is now inside Olivia! She even gets to speak like him, but in her own voice - which is pretty sweet and yet weird at the same time (to watch and listen to!) The storyline is one of a female suicide jumper that just cannot die!In 'Bloodline,' ""Fauxlivia"" is pregnant and kidnapped, has her pregnancy accelerated, and then has her baby in a Chinese food store - it's a long story! But for what true purpose is revealed right at the end. In 'Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,' the gang link up and enter Olivia's mind to try and ""find her"" and get Dr. Bell out and into a computer! This episode is nearly ALL animated and flows just like a comic book. The special features on the creation of the episode say that it normally takes up to a year to create such a thing - and yet for this episode, they only had 4 weeks!In '6:02 AM EST,' a vortex opens and kills cattle and people on a farm. The Machine sparks into life, without Peter, and so he tries to turn it off himself - not a good idea, as it turns out! ""Fauxlivia"" tries to do something good about the upcoming war, but fails. In 'The Last Sam Weiss,' Peter is recovering, but not quickly and not without residual brain effects. Walter figures out that the Machine has to be moved closer to the one on Their world, which means a huge move to Liberty Island.In the season ending final episode, 'The Day We Died,' most all of the episode jumps to 2026 - once Peter has strapped himself into the Machine - and it all includes some major shocking news ... and one MASSIVE shock moment you won't want to miss! A confusing ending, for me, it has to be said, but one that is explained on Wikipedia by the writers in their summary of what to expect from Season Four. Oh, and once you hit the red dot on the Episode page, you will get a longer version of the funeral scene! Russell A.

While it has been compared to the X-Files and it is in the same genre, I would have to say it is unique in and of itself.  This show has taken twists and turns the X-Files would not have been able to keep up with.  It didn't have the single minded obsession of Mulder and unending skepticism of Scully.  They are a team that enters into each adventure with open minds, a variety of personal issues, and many things going on behind the scenes.  If you are a scifi fan, this is a must.

It's fine entertainment if you like the genre.  The Amazon presentation has given me the opportunity, both to re-experience some series dramatic high points, as well as to fill in the gaps of the underlying thread dealing with parallel universes, and understand how the deepest storyline, the Watchers, developed.I like science fiction/fantasy, so years ago, I began watching Fringe soon after the series began.  Although intrigued by some of the individual stories, I found some of the characters (e.g. Walter Bishop) both preposterous and tedious, while liking the the two other characters, Peter Bishop and Olivia.  On this second go round, I've learned to live with Walter's peculiarities.I didn't realize how much fun it was going to be, watching the entire series, from beginning to end, filling in the holes.

Skin tones and textures look quite nice without the overuse of digital noise reduction.Keep in mind that the episode ""Subject 13"" looks deliberately soft (they used the effect to soften the wrinkles on actor John Noble since this episode takes place in 1985)but, on the whole, the episodes look sharp and exceptionally good.Audio is exceptional as well with a nice DTS HD Master Audio mix that's very active during action sequences.The special features are exceptionally good--we get audio commentary on ""The Plateau"" (disc one), ""OS"" where we get a commentary in ""Maximum Episode Mode"", i.e., a pop up visual commentary allowing us to experience the genesis of the story as it unfolded in the writer's room and through production and a conventional audio commentary on  disc 4's episode ""Lysergic Acid Diethyalmide"" (the episode that's partially animated).We get a featurette on the production of ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide"" where we discover for example that the original thought was to animate the episode like ""Yellow Submarine"" (they instead went for a ""Johnny Quest"" style animation using, of course, computer animation). One featurette has an amazingly long title--""Duality of Worlds: The Psychology of Duality, The Other You, Visualizing an Alternate World and A Machine of Destiny"" (wow). ""Constructing an Extra-Sensory Soundscape"" takes you behind-the-scenes into the creation of the sound effects. ""Secrets of Fringe: The First People"" features consulting producers Jeff Pinker and J.H. Wyman discussing these mysterious people who created the machine.

I felt that this season was pretty tight and had some great interaction of the main characters.  Too bad it all ends with season 5.,5,Great Show,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,563,"['really', 'show', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'few', 'issues', 'as', 'far', 'continuity', 'logic', 'jumps', 'mean', 'sci-fi', 'tons', 'stuff', 'crazy', 'things', 'FBI', 'clearing', 'house', 'first', 'civilians', 'move', 'fairly', 'important', 'like', 'see', 'attention', 'detail', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'John', 'Noble', 'perhaps', 'best', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'credit', 'great', 'work', 'felt', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'tight', 'had', 'great', 'interaction', 'main', 'characters', 'Too', 'bad', 'season', '5']",Fringe: S3 (DVD)

1350944,AP3B615GM191G,B003L77G2Y,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 6]","For its first two seasons, ""Fringe"" teased viewers with brief glimpses into an alternate universe that mirrors our own.  In this third season, the curtain is pulled aside, seeing the universes interact with each other like never before.Without giving away too many spoilers, the main plotline of season three focuses on deciphering the intentions of ""Walternate"", ""Faux-Livia"", and the mirror-Fringe department.  Instead of characterizing that place as ""evil"", this season gives it a more human feel, as Walternate (though undeniably evil) is just trying to save his world from the past crossing-over of ""our"" Walter many years ago.  Roughly half the season is spent ""over there"", with the other half focusing on the ""real"" Walter, Peter, and Olivia trying to figure out the doomsday device that will ultimately play such a large role in the future of both universes.Also at the forefront of the emotional scene this season is the Peter/Olivia coupling.  When both universes get a little ""mixed up"" in the early goings of the season, the budding relationship between the pair takes both a personal and cosmic twist of epic proportions.Basically, this is just another mind-blowing seasons of the most well-written show on television right now.  In typical JJ Abrams fashion, he blows our minds right away in the first episode, then explains it as the season progresses.  There are so many emotional twists/turns that, when finished, you'll feel as if more than just one TV season has flown by.Though Abrams will always be best-known for ""LOST"", he has carved out quite another niche with ""Fringe"".  Besides being a bit more procedural than ""LOST"", ""Fringe"" is just as smartly written, well-acted, and filled with ""OMG"" moments in nearly every episode.  I'm thrilled that FOX renewed the series for a fourth season, as the big finale of this third season sets up so many incredible, exciting possibilities.",5,Over There,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,1904,"['first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Fringe', 'teased', 'viewers', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'alternate', 'universe', 'own', 'third', 'season', 'curtain', 'pulled', 'aside', 'seeing', 'universes', 'interact', 'other', 'never', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'main', 'plotline', 'season', 'three', 'focuses', 'deciphering', 'intentions', 'Walternate', 'Faux-Livia', 'mirror-Fringe', 'department', 'Instead', 'characterizing', 'place', 'evil', 'season', 'more', 'human', 'feel', 'Walternate', 'undeniably', 'evil', 'just', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'past', 'crossing-over', 'Walter', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Roughly', 'season', 'spent', 'there', 'other', 'half', 'focusing', 'real', 'Walter', 'Peter', 'Olivia', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'doomsday', 'device', 'will', 'ultimately', 'play', 'large', 'role', 'future', 'universes.Also', 'forefront', 'emotional', 'scene', 'season', 'Peter/Olivia', 'coupling', 'When', 'universes', 'get', 'little', 'mixed', 'up', 'early', 'goings', 'season', 'budding', 'relationship', 'pair', 'personal', 'cosmic', 'twist', 'epic', 'proportions.Basically', 'just', 'mind-blowing', 'seasons', 'most', 'well-written', 'show', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'typical', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'fashion', 'minds', 'right', 'away', 'first', 'episode', 'then', 'season', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'emotional', 'twists/turns', 'when', 'finished', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'TV', 'season', 'flown', 'Abrams', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'best-known', 'LOST', 'carved', 'out', 'quite', 'niche', 'Fringe', 'being', 'bit', 'more', 'procedural', 'LOST', 'Fringe', 'just', 'as', 'smartly', 'written', 'well-acted', 'filled', 'OMG', 'moments', 'nearly', 'episode', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'FOX', 'renewed', 'series', 'fourth', 'season', 'big', 'finale', 'third', 'season', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'incredible', 'exciting', 'possibilities']",Fringe: S3 (DVD)
