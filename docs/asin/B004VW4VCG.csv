1430228,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B004VW4VCG,Compay,"[7, 7]","Outcast was definitely better than I had expected it to be.  The film tells the story of a woman and her son hiding out in a Scotland slum from would-be killers that have tracked them from Ireland.  Things become complicated further when the son becomes the love interest of a beautiful young neighbor, and the witchcraft-practicing mother has to protect her son from what she considers a number of threats.The film was shot well, with good cinematography and color correction.  The film was shot on location in Edinburgh, and the visuals are kept dreary to stay in sync with the theme of the movie.  The film is light on gore, but there's enough to satisfy most horror fans.  The audience isn't given much of the film's ""monster"" throughout most of the movie, which seems to help make this a film just as much about the characters as offering up scares.One of the best aspects of the film, though, is the cast.  I became a fan of Scottish actress Kate Dickie after watching her performance in Red Road back in 2006, and she doesn't disappoint in Outcast as the overprotective mother.  The absolutely gorgeous Hanna Stanbridge makes a great film debut with Outcast as Petronella, neighbor to the mysterious couple practicing ancient magic next door.  The remainder of the cast is rounded out by seasoned film veterans from Scotland and Ireland.My first complaint about the movie was that there wasn't enough backstory.  As the film progresses, you learn more about the ancient Celtic magic being practiced, but you are never given the full picture.  It's hard to completely understand how all the puzzles fit together, or the significance of some of the characters (such as the man who must give permission for the hunters to search for the beast in Edinburgh).The only other problem that I had with Outcast was that it wasn't completely original. While I had never seen a film focused on Celtic magic, the plot itself seemed to borrow from a few other movies.  Outcast seems to borrow a few elements from Let the Right One In, but it certainly will remind horror fans of Stephen King's 1992 film Sleepwalkers.  There's a son that changes into a beast, on the run from town to town with his overprotective mother.  While the two movies aren't identical, it would have been nice to see a completely new spin on the concept.Overall, I thought Outcast was a good film to watch.  It was certainly shot and cast better than most straight to video horror flicks that I'm used to, with a slightly better story.  If you're a horror fan, it's definitely worth a watch.",3,Not the Most Original - But Surprisingly Good,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,2559,"['Outcast', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'be', 'film', 'story', 'woman', 'son', 'hiding', 'out', 'Scotland', 'slum', 'would-be', 'killers', 'have', 'tracked', 'Ireland', 'Things', 'become', 'complicated', 'further', 'when', 'son', 'love', 'interest', 'beautiful', 'young', 'neighbor', 'witchcraft-practicing', 'mother', 'protect', 'son', 'what', 'number', 'threats.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'well', 'good', 'cinematography', 'color', 'correction', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Edinburgh', 'visuals', 'are', 'kept', 'dreary', 'stay', 'sync', 'theme', 'movie', 'film', 'light', 'gore', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'audience', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'film', 'monster', 'most', 'movie', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'offering', 'up', 'scares.One', 'best', 'aspects', 'film', 'cast', 'became', 'fan', 'Scottish', 'actress', 'Kate', 'Dickie', 'watching', 'performance', 'Red', 'Road', 'back', '2006', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Outcast', 'overprotective', 'mother', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Hanna', 'Stanbridge', 'great', 'film', 'debut', 'Outcast', 'Petronella', 'neighbor', 'mysterious', 'couple', 'practicing', 'ancient', 'magic', 'next', 'door', 'remainder', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'seasoned', 'film', 'veterans', 'Scotland', 'Ireland.My', 'first', 'complaint', 'movie', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'backstory', 'film', 'learn', 'more', 'ancient', 'Celtic', 'magic', 'being', 'practiced', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'full', 'picture', 'hard', 'completely', 'understand', 'how', 'puzzles', 'fit', 'together', 'significance', 'characters', 'such', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'give', 'permission', 'hunters', 'search', 'beast', 'Edinburgh', '.The', 'only', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'Outcast', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'original', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'focused', 'Celtic', 'magic', 'plot', 'seemed', 'borrow', 'few', 'other', 'movies', 'Outcast', 'borrow', 'few', 'elements', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'certainly', 'will', 'remind', 'horror', 'fans', 'Stephen', 'King', '1992', 'film', 'Sleepwalkers', 'son', 'beast', 'run', 'town', 'town', 'overprotective', 'mother', 'two', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'identical', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'completely', 'new', 'spin', 'concept.Overall', 'thought', 'Outcast', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'was', 'certainly', 'shot', 'cast', 'better', 'most', 'straight', 'video', 'horror', 'flicks', ""'m"", 'used', 'slightly', 'better', 'story', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch']",Outcast

It started well enough, very moody, fraught with portent and mystery, but then unraveled from that point on.  According to the filmmaker, this film is supposedly seeped in ancient mythology (he called it a dark fairy tale); concerning Irish Travelers.  What I saw though was an awkward attempt to blend magic with reality, reality taking the upper hand and turning the film into something more ordinary because of it.  A few runes and muttered spells do not a great fantasy make.  The whole point of magic is that it is beyond the normal commonplace mundane world we live in.  It should be mystical and wonderful, even scary, but not the humdrum world depicted in this film.The story is uncomplicated: a woman/witch (Kate Dickie) and her son (Niall Bruton) and on the run, trying to keep their distance from a hired killer (James Nesbitt) bent on killing them both.  His reasons for doing so are less a public service and more a self-serving means of gaining magic and possibly immortality.  Lies, deception, and treachery all play a part in this deadly hunt as the woman decides to make a last stand in what looks like an almost abandoned housing project just outside of Edinburgh.  Of course, they also had to throw in a love story for good measure, which also tended to put a damper on the mystical aspects of this tale.  As filmed, this is a dark and dreary world, limited by design, confining in its narrow parameters.  I was less than impressed by the techniques used to measure out the potential the story held that was never fully realized.

1430238,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B004VW4VCG,John Milton,"[0, 1]","Outcast is another movie that flew under the radar for me but resurfaced when my attention had been drawn to low-budget Scottish horror flick The Dead Outside.I honestly wasn't expecting much from this movie but was genuinely surprised by the overall quality of the film. Eyeforfilm.co.uk said of Outcast that it is ""The best British horror film since The Descent""; lofty praise indeed...The story is original and sees old celtic magic and lore very much alive and kicking in a run down bleak estate in Edinburgh. The feel of the movie is very real, unlike many big budget Hollywood flicks. This may be assisted in no small part by the fact that the movie was shot in and around the Edinburgh area, using genuine locations rather than set stages for the most part.The film reveals its occult foundations from the get-go and I do not think this is a failing on the part of Edinburgh-born director Colm McCarthy. Outcast packs a compelling tale into an hour and a half long flick admirably and elevates what could have been simply another low budget monster movie into a horror that actually has a genuinely gripping story to tell.The make up and effects are not spectacular but they do not have to be since they are, as they are meant to be, a mere supplement to the performance of the actors; which I would submit to you is second to none in Outcast. James Nesbitt is wonderfully menacing, Niall Bruton suitably angsty as the teenager coming to terms with the trappings of his age, the beautiful Hanna Stanbridge as Fergal's love interest and James Cosmo as a dark and brooding elder. Of anecdotal interest, there's a star turn from a nearly unrecognisable Karen Gillon of Doctor Who fame.fearnet.com summed up the movie perfectly with ""intelligent, engaging and unexpectedly creepy"".So, do yourself a favour and spend a couple of coins getting this movie and adding it to your collection!

McCarthy (no idea if they're any relation). Tomatsk (Josh Whitelaw in his first screen appearance), a mentally challenged boy of indeterminate age (I suspect late teens/early twenties, but it is never disclosed), goes through a series of coincidences that may, or may not, put him in harm's way. But Tomatsk is never the main player in any of these scenes, save the final one; he's on the sidelines, and we're led to believe he's a bit player, a piece of window dressing or local color, until we realize that, in fact, this entire sequence of events has led up to Tomatsk being in this alley at this particular time, and we hear one thing just as the camera pans round and we see another, and god if it isn't tempting indeed to believe the lord loves drunks and fools, but god is nowhere to be found in this tale of warring magics and forbidden love.Plot: Mary (Prometheus' Kate Dickey) and her son Fergal (Niall Bruton in his first feature appearance) are wanderers, and they've just settled into a new flat in the heart of Dublin's tenement district. Mary is a witch, and her first act after the bags are unpacked is to paint the walls with protective runes against any who would harm her or Fergal. Living next door is a Scots/Romany family, but most we see of them, save a single scene (the first scene in the sequence I described in the first paragraph, in fact) is fetching Petronella (Hanna Stanbridge, also in her feature debut) and her brother Tomatsk. Fergal and Petronella meet by chance one day outside the local grocery, and nothing is quite the same after that. But love brings vulnerability, and Mary and Fergal's settling has not gone unnoticed: a pair of magicians, Liam and is apprentice Cathal (Red Tails's Ciaran McMenamin and Millions' James Nesbitt) are tracking them, though the local Laird (Braveheart's James Cosmo) is wary of their presence, and an inhuman beast seems also to be stalking the family, striking closer to home with each kill.""Urban fantasy"" has been one of the great buzzwords in publishing for about a decade now, stories of faerie transplanted to New York or LA or Vegas or London, but this is the first time I've ever seen a movie that I can say with no qualms is a serious attempt as making a film that qualifies as urban fantasy.  And despite McCarthy's falling to convention in the last fifteen minutes or so and filling the ending full of twists (though all of them are as carefully set up as the scene above), there's no doubt this film fills the bill. McCarthy has taken a tale of wizards and witches and set it in Dublin, plastered it over with that dark, oppressive urban-fantasy atmosphere, even thrown in the requisite romance subplot, and the entire damn thing succeeds. It succeeds, I think, because (I'm hypothesizing here, but this is how it feels to me) McCarthy, since he was working in a field very popular in literature but almost nonexistent in film, approached this as a novel. He thought a lot about setting up that sequence I talked about in the opening paragraph, and that's not an anomaly; that's the way this movie goes. The movie is slow during the first half, but that's what comes from taking your time to develop your characters; I don't think most film viewers will have a problem with that if they don't go in expecting a big action film. It helps, of course, that the McCarthys have written characters that they actually do develop. If the movie does have a flaw, it's that the main characters are so realistic that the two-dimensional minor characters (the women from the Tenement Association, Petronella's ex-boyfriend, and the Laird are all good examples) stand out maybe more than they should. But I wasn't willing to let that interfere with my enjoyment of what is otherwise an excellent piece of work.
