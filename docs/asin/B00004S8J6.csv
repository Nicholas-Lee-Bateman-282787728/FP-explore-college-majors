In fact, it's a pretty boring, mostly eye-rolling, picture to sit through. At the beginning, one notices how quirky the characters are. After a while of figuring out the hook, he soon realizes that it's a film that relies too much on quirks and nothing else. Really, that's all there is to Gregory's Girl. The characters are not very interesting either. Oddly, one of them, especially when he opens his mouth, has an uncanny facial resemblance to Kevin Bacon's. The girl isn't much of a looker; in fact, everybody is ugly in Gregory's Girl. Instead of going from one substantive scene to the next, it's from one quirk to another to get the reel moving.

Hartley,"[1, 1]","Name the last ""coming-of-age"" teen comedy you saw that didn't rely on  a barrage of cheap jokes or compromising situations with fresh-baked pastries for laughs. I would have to go all the way back to 1981, for writer-director Bill Forsyth's delightful examination of puppy love, Scottish style. Gawky teenager Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) goes gaga for Dorothy (Dee Hepburn), a fellow soccer player on the school team. Gregory receives love advice from an unlikely mentor, his little sister (Allison Forster). His male classmates offer advice as well, but of course they are just as clueless as he is (although they put on airs of having deep insight on the subject of girls, naturally). In fact, Forsyth gets a lot of mileage out of that most basic truth about adolescence-the girls are usually light years ahead of the boys when it comes to the mysteries of love. Not as precious as you might think, as Forsyth is a master of low-key anarchy and understated irony. Some viewers may have trouble navigating the thick Scottish accents, but it is well worth the extra work.

It's as quirkily funny as anything you'll see, and it totally lacks the crassness of Hollywood products that try to use the same young crush material. (I saw G.G., originally, in the theater, and I remember the American equivalent at the time was a series of John Hughes movies. Next to this, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; is predictable and pretty mean.)Bill Forsyth as a director had (has?)a really special way with character. The plots of his movies go off in unexpected directions, and you get the sense that he's really letting the characters decide how things work out. That works really well with the young teenagers in this movie. The plot's being driven along by the decisions, by the logic, of high school students; you really get into their heads, and it's SUCH a funny, awkward-smiling, self-deprecating place to be... Gregory's pining for his soccer darling, Dorothy, isn't going where you think it will, and it's just flawless the way the viewer figures that out along with the character. It's perfectly timed.If you love this movie, if you remember lines about Caracas and numbers of Elephants and that sort of thing afterward, you should try Local Hero.

Rather than being threatened by her a Dorothy craze sweeps the school and she finds herself being interviewed by the school paper and bootleg photos of her are being sold by enterprising students.  Gregory falls for Dorothy as well - hard - and perhaps because of their sports connection he seems to think himself more suited for her than the other blokes.Gregory is gangly and awkward, though, and the scenes where we see Gregory getting romantic advice and trying to make himself more desirable are accurate and hilarious.Will Gregory make a hit with Dorothy?

There are several surprising things about this DVD for Americans who are accustomed to the cable or VHS version of the movie... First, many small scenes were edited out of the US version. Why?  I can't tell... The scenes seem harmless enough. However, the biggest shock on this DVD is the original Scottish soundtrack.  All these years, those dozens and dozens of viewings, those classic lines that are stuck in my head (&quot;It's a well known fact.&quot;)... They simply sound BETTER in the original dialogue.  What studio executive pinhead thought it would be a good idea to re-record the dialogue with more British-sounding voices?  The moral of the story here is:  Watch this DVD with the Scottish soundtrack and it will almost be like watching a new movie.  And I thank the non-pinheads at MGM for including both audio versions so we could make the choice.This movie is, quite simply, a beautifully crafted, intelligent, witty, sweet look at awkward adolescence.  I never tire of it, and now that it's on DVD I know I'll never wear it out.",5,Maybe the best film about young love?,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,1142,"['Finally', 'quot', 'Gregory', 'Girl', 'quot', 'out', 'DVD', 'can', 'throw', 'away', 'worn', 'out', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'are', 'several', 'surprising', 'things', 'DVD', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'accustomed', 'cable', 'VHS', 'version', 'movie', 'First', 'many', 'small', 'scenes', 'were', 'edited', 'US', 'version', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'scenes', 'seem', 'harmless', 'enough', 'However', 'biggest', 'shock', 'DVD', 'original', 'Scottish', 'soundtrack', 'years', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'viewings', 'classic', 'lines', 'are', 'stuck', 'head', 'quot', 'well', 'known', 'fact.', 'quot', 'simply', 'sound', 'BETTER', 'original', 'dialogue', 'What', 'studio', 'executive', 'pinhead', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 're-record', 'dialogue', 'more', 'British-sounding', 'voices', 'moral', 'story', 'here', 'Watch', 'DVD', 'Scottish', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'almost', 'be', 'watching', 'new', 'movie', 'thank', 'non-pinheads', 'MGM', 'including', 'audio', 'versions', 'could', 'make', 'choice.This', 'movie', 'quite', 'simply', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'sweet', 'look', 'awkward', 'adolescence', 'never', 'tire', 'now', 'DVD', 'know', ""'ll"", 'never', 'wear', 'out']",N/A

Some parts of the movie looks like old seventies porn movies, soft, dark and grainy. The colours are a tad faded and the detail is soft. The old english dub sounds sharp, clear but a bit flat with no bass. The Scottish track is very dated and muffled compared to the dubbed track. This is very apparent if you switch back and forth between the two tracks during any music only parts of the movie. The film elements have a lot of scratches on it which is too bad. It looks like a 20 year old film. On the plus side the movie has lots of scene extensions compared to the old vhs version. It's like a Director's cut for those of us who know this film like the back of our hands! The colour overall is much better than the old vhs. The cover art stinks, I don't know why they didn't use the original poster art? But thank MGM for finally putting this out in N. America. This film and its sequel has been available in the U.K. for two years now!
