Oh God is a simple comedy. The characters have little depth, but if they did-it would take away from the lightheartness this film has. This film has a message-its simple and direct-LOVE EACH OTHER.It doesn't smack you in the face with it, but it does satire those pompous relgious leaders and preachers who wear $1000 rolexs and ask for the poor to up their donations  (Are you listening Oral Roberts?)Burns plays the holy one with a sense of hindsight wisdom and awe, similar to Morgan Freeman in Bruce Almighty. First time actor John Denver seem national, you never would have known it was his first film role. Terri Garr who plays Denver's wife does steal every scene she is in, too bad none are with Burns's God. Carl Reiner direction with Larry Gelbart's script is light and yet you can see all of us within this pieceNow to the extras. the trailers to all three Oh God movies. The audio commentary of Actress Terri Garr, Screen writer Larry Gelbart, Producer Jerry Weintraub and Director Carl Reiner give this film an insight into what makes this comedy so light. and also gives history of this movies.

He's an honest man who has a wife and 2 kids. Just your normal kind of guy that is until God (George Burns) requests an  audience with him. He has picked Jerry to carry his message of good will to  an increasingly pessimistic world. But Jerry finds that people are  difficult to convert, he even has trouble trying to make his family  understand that God appears to him as a kindly old guy. His faith remains  strong until his call starts to slowly filter through.Critique: A  surprise box-office hit when first released, it spawned other sequels that  proved interesting ('OH! GOD! BOOK 2', 'OH! GOD! YOU DEVIL'). 81 year old  George Burns shines as the perennial God, a role that he played with sweet  abandonment. His deliveries of lines are perfectly executed. This God seems  to have an answer for everything: on creating the world he quips; &quot;to  tell you the truth I thought about it for 6 days and did the whole thing in  1&quot;.

Oh God! is brought to you by Jerry Weintraub and Carl Reiner.Jerry (John Denver) works at a grocery store. When he gets home to his wife, Bobbie, (Teri Garr) and kids (Moosie Drier, Rachel Longaker), he received in the mail an invitation from God to meet him at said place in Room 2700 at 11:00am.In a leaf of lettuce, he finds another note from God.He goes all the way to the 27th floor, opens the door to 2700 and sees an intercom and a chair.  God is speaking to him, but reminds him He can't be seen. Later, he speaks to Jerry over the car radio that he wants Jerry to spread the word that God is alive.Jerry tries to convience his wife, but she is doubtful that her husband has heard God. Later that evening, while Jerry is in the shower, God speaks to him again.God wants Jerry to come out of the shower, but says he is naked. God says, ""You think I don't know what you got?"" Jerry comes out of the shower and its God in person (George Burns).

Barton ""Beth Barton""","[34, 34]","When granted an interview with God, John Denver - an assistant manager at Food World, thinks that it is a practical joke by one of his friends.  When the invitation turns up again in an unexpected place, it gets his attention - even though he doesn't believe in God.George Burns plays wonderfully as God and the ensuing scenes where he convinces Denver that he is who he says he is have an enduring and endearing quality.  His message is simple.  God is alive.  God cares.  We have been given everything we need to make it work - and it can, if we want it to. Convincing the world, however, is another matter.  From the religious editor at the LA Times who thinks Denver is just another fruitcake to Denver's boss at Food World who is offended that Denver would suggest that God would pick an unbelieving assistant manager instead of him, a man who has prayed with Billy Graham, no less, all the personalities come out.  After an appearance on Dinah Shore, spaced out weirdos show up on his lawn and harass his kids and wife.  Finally, a panel of religious experts agree to give Denver a set of questions that he could not possibly answer (they are written in Aramaic).  After completing the questions, Denver delivers his package and a few choice words from God to a stereotypical televangelist (aka ""God's Own Quarterback"" - having delivered the benediction at this year's Superbowl).  The film finally culminates in a courtroom scene where Burns, as God, gives a powerful delivery.This film has some of the best writing. Burns has many humorous lines - it IS a comedy - but he also has some pretty profound and meaningful lines.  In an obvious reference to the film The Exorcist, he comments on how easy it is for people to believe in the devil.  But not God.  He says that what we have here is some of his best work, that we should take care of it and appreciate it.  He says that he knows how hard it can be in these troubled times to believe in God but, if it helps, we should know that he believes in us.",5,Compelling View of a Very Personable God,1063065600,"09 9, 2003",2003,2011,"['When', 'granted', 'interview', 'God', 'John', 'Denver', 'assistant', 'manager', 'Food', 'World', 'practical', 'joke', 'one', 'friends', 'When', 'invitation', 'up', 'again', 'unexpected', 'place', 'attention', 'even', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God.George', 'Burns', 'wonderfully', 'God', 'ensuing', 'scenes', 'where', 'Denver', 'who', 'have', 'enduring', 'endearing', 'quality', 'message', 'simple', 'God', 'alive', 'God', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'everything', 'need', 'make', 'work', 'can', 'want', 'Convincing', 'world', 'however', 'matter', 'religious', 'editor', 'LA', 'Times', 'who', 'Denver', 'just', 'fruitcake', 'Denver', 'boss', 'Food', 'World', 'who', 'offended', 'Denver', 'would', 'suggest', 'God', 'would', 'pick', 'unbelieving', 'assistant', 'manager', 'instead', 'man', 'who', 'prayed', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'less', 'personalities', 'come', 'out', 'appearance', 'Dinah', 'Shore', 'spaced', 'out', 'weirdos', 'show', 'up', 'lawn', 'harass', 'kids', 'wife', 'Finally', 'panel', 'religious', 'experts', 'agree', 'give', 'Denver', 'set', 'questions', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'answer', 'are', 'written', 'Aramaic', 'completing', 'questions', 'Denver', 'package', 'few', 'choice', 'words', 'God', 'stereotypical', 'televangelist', 'God', 'Own', 'Quarterback', 'having', 'delivered', 'benediction', 'year', 'Superbowl', 'film', 'finally', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'where', 'Burns', 'God', 'powerful', 'delivery.This', 'film', 'best', 'writing', 'Burns', 'many', 'humorous', 'lines', 'comedy', 'also', 'pretty', 'profound', 'meaningful', 'lines', 'obvious', 'reference', 'film', 'Exorcist', 'comments', 'how', 'easy', 'people', 'believe', 'devil', 'not', 'God', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'best', 'work', 'should', 'take', 'care', 'appreciate', 'how', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'troubled', 'times', 'believe', 'God', 'should', 'know']",N/A

Spread your own Word, or spread nothing.It's cruely unGodly to make good guys like John Denver a laughing stock not to mention  getting him fired.

""Oh, God!""  is producer Jerry Weintraub's endearing 1977 comedy starring 81 year old George Burns as God and John Denver as supermarket produce manager Jerry Landers.  Jerry is just your typical working class hero struggling to make ends meet.  He is a character just about all of us can relate to.  One day God (who looks a lot like your grandfather and is dressed in a plaid shirt) appears to Jerry and announces rather unequivocably that he has chosen him to spread his Word to the masses.  Imagine how you would react!Despite the fact that Jerry finds God to be quite an affable fellow he is very frightened and extremely confused by this fantastic turn of events.  After all, he is not very religious himself and has absolutely no idea why God would choose him of all people to spread the Good News.  ""Oh, God!"" tells the story of what happens to an average guy who finds himself in a rather extraordinary situation. Despite his misgivings Jerry decides to do what God is asking of him.  He has been warned by God that there will be consequences for doing His will.  People will question his sanity and he will be the subject of ridicule by those who will challenge the veracity of his fantastic claims.  The media will paint him a fool and his marriage will be tested.  Why, he could even lose his job.  Still Jerry plods on.  During the course of the movie there are several amusing encounters between God and Jerry in which God attempts to give Jerry some pointers on how to handle the numerous difficulties he is facing.  One of my favorite scenes in the film takes place when a group of religious leaders interrogates Jerry about his claims.  Among them is Rev. Willie Williams (Paul Sorvino), a high and mighty TV evangelist who claims to have spoken with God himself.  The Lord can only take so much and suddenly appears to deliver a stinging rebuke to this self-aggrandizing charlatan.  The film concludes with a hilarious courtroom scene in which God actually appears again and performs some card tricks for the skeptical judge (Barnard Hughes).  Great stuff!While John Denver does a workmanlike job in the role of Jerry Landers it is clearly George Burns who steals the show in ""Oh, God!"".  By this point George Burns had done just about everything you could do in show business.  He was a song and dance man in vaudeville and the star of his own weekly radio and television series with wife Gracie Allen in the 1940's and  50's.  He played Vegas on a regular basis and had also appeared in a number of motion pictures.  The fact is that George Burns makes for a very believable God.  This is not a God of fire and brimstone.  Rather, the character Burns plays here is a God of love and a God of compassion.  He comes bearing a message of  peace and hope.  George Burns draws on a lifetime of experience to create a truly unforgettable character.  There are not too many actors out there who could credibly play God but George Burns manages to pull it off.  ""Oh, God!"" is one of those rare motion pictures that can be enjoyed by every member of the family.  Mercifully there is no violence and no special effects.  It is a film with a very positive message that you can enjoy again and again.  Very highly recommended!",5,Great family fare.,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,3358,"['film', 'smile', 'face', 'time', 'watch', '.and', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'Oh', 'God', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Weintraub', 'endearing', '1977', 'comedy', 'starring', '81', 'year', 'old', 'George', 'Burns', 'God', 'John', 'Denver', 'supermarket', 'produce', 'manager', 'Jerry', 'Landers', 'Jerry', 'just', 'typical', 'working', 'class', 'hero', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'character', 'just', 'can', 'relate', 'One', 'day', 'God', 'who', 'lot', 'grandfather', 'dressed', 'plaid', 'shirt', 'Jerry', 'announces', 'rather', 'unequivocably', 'chosen', 'spread', 'Word', 'masses', 'Imagine', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'fact', 'Jerry', 'God', 'be', 'quite', 'affable', 'fellow', 'very', 'frightened', 'extremely', 'confused', 'fantastic', 'turn', 'events', 'not', 'very', 'religious', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'why', 'God', 'would', 'choose', 'people', 'spread', 'Good', 'News', 'Oh', 'God', 'story', 'what', 'average', 'guy', 'who', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'misgivings', 'Jerry', 'do', 'what', 'God', 'asking', 'been', 'warned', 'God', 'will', 'be', 'consequences', 'doing', 'will', 'People', 'will', 'question', 'sanity', 'will', 'be', 'subject', 'ridicule', 'who', 'will', 'challenge', 'veracity', 'fantastic', 'claims', 'media', 'will', 'paint', 'fool', 'marriage', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'Why', 'could', 'even', 'lose', 'job', 'Still', 'Jerry', 'plods', 'course', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'amusing', 'encounters', 'God', 'Jerry', 'God', 'give', 'Jerry', 'pointers', 'how', 'handle', 'numerous', 'difficulties', 'facing', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'film', 'place', 'when', 'group', 'religious', 'leaders', 'Jerry', 'claims', 'Rev', 'Willie', 'Williams', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'high', 'mighty', 'TV', 'evangelist', 'who', 'have', 'spoken', 'God', 'Lord', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'so', 'much', 'suddenly', 'deliver', 'stinging', 'rebuke', 'self-aggrandizing', 'charlatan', 'film', 'hilarious', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'God', 'actually', 'again', 'performs', 'card', 'tricks', 'skeptical', 'judge', 'Barnard', 'Hughes', 'Great', 'stuff', 'John', 'Denver', 'workmanlike', 'job', 'role', 'Jerry', 'Landers', 'clearly', 'George', 'Burns', 'who', 'show', 'Oh', 'God', 'point', 'George', 'Burns', 'had', 'done', 'just', 'everything', 'could', 'do', 'show', 'business', 'was', 'song', 'dance', 'man', 'vaudeville', 'star', 'own', 'weekly', 'radio', 'television', 'series', 'wife', 'Gracie', 'Allen', '1940', '50', 'played', 'Vegas', 'regular', 'basis', 'had', 'also', 'appeared', 'number', 'motion', 'pictures', 'fact', 'George', 'Burns', 'very', 'believable', 'God', 'not', 'God', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'character', 'Burns', 'here', 'God', 'love', 'God', 'compassion', 'bearing', 'message', 'peace', 'hope', 'George', 'Burns', 'lifetime', 'experience', 'create', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'credibly', 'play', 'God', 'George', 'Burns', 'pull', 'off', 'Oh', 'God', 'one', 'rare', 'motion', 'pictures', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'member', 'family', 'Mercifully', 'violence', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'very', 'positive', 'message', 'can', 'enjoy', 'again', 'again', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

While Denver handles his role competently & sympathetically--and has pleasing chemistry with Burns--this film is clearly Burns' show all the way. And who could argue? He has the ultimate role here! It's a perfect vehicle for Burns as his comical stage patter reflects on all kinds of creations: people, animals, food, clothes, etc. Although his trademark cigar is nowhere to be seen, you can practically envision Burns thoughtfully puffing on it between jokes.Included is fine support from Teri Garr, a ""pre-M*A*S*H"" David Ogden Stiers, Barnard Hughes, Ralph Bellamy and especially Paul Sorvino going over the top as a husky, boisterous, leisure suit-wearing evangelist who has ""spoken with God personally"".The courtroom finale in which God comes to the rescue as a ""surprise witness"" is fine, but gets slighty marred in some cheap, showy effects.Otherwise, this is a timely film that modestly sends a clear message: Have faith, and don't hurt one another.",5,George Burns' higher calling,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,1372,"['Looking', 'film', 'today', 'Oh', 'God', 'pretty', 'dated', 'appearance', 'messages', 'are', 'universal', 'George', 'Burns', 'motion', 'picture', 'comeback', 'whimsical', 'comedy', 'much', 'say', 'life', 'general', 'religion', 'problems', 'world', 'just', 'plain', 'believing.John', 'Denver', 'shot', 'acting', 'film', 'honest', 'decent', 'everyman', 'who', 'chosen', 'Almighty', 'be', 'next', 'messenger', 'Denver', 'role', 'competently', 'sympathetically', 'pleasing', 'chemistry', 'Burns', 'film', 'clearly', 'Burns', 'show', 'way', 'who', 'could', 'argue', 'ultimate', 'role', 'here', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Burns', 'comical', 'stage', 'patter', 'kinds', 'creations', 'people', 'animals', 'food', 'clothes', 'etc', 'trademark', 'cigar', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'can', 'practically', 'envision', 'Burns', 'thoughtfully', 'puffing', 'jokes.Included', 'fine', 'support', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'pre-M*A*S*H', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'Barnard', 'Hughes', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'especially', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'going', 'top', 'husky', 'boisterous', 'leisure', 'suit-wearing', 'evangelist', 'who', 'spoken', 'God', 'personally', '.The', 'courtroom', 'finale', 'God', 'rescue', 'surprise', 'witness', 'fine', 'slighty', 'marred', 'cheap', 'showy', 'effects.Otherwise', 'timely', 'film', 'modestly', 'clear', 'message', 'Have', 'faith', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'one']",N/A

Carl Reiner fashioned a comedy that is both endearingly funny, bitingly satirical, and religiously satisfying.  George Burns was seeing his career sky rocket in his 80's starting with a best supporting Oscar for The Sunshine Boys in 1975 and followed up two years later with Oh, God! at age 82.  In this film he plays God (when asked how he was chosen he replied, ""Don't know really...but I can tell you there was a short list of call backs...) who comes to Earth to pick a messenger to put his message that we should all work together to preserve what we have to the people.  Chuck Heston is bypassed for some reason and he settles on a Supermarket Manager played by John Denver (the surprise performance of the film...and the real reason it works).  Burn's plays God as wise, and coy, and eternally loving with a twinkle in his eye and infinite patience for these flawed creations that he obviously dearly loves.  Teri Garr, a fixture in the seventies as the long suffering wife of visionaries (Close Encounters), brings her frantically doubtful and ultimately faithful wife to the mixture in grand style and she and Denver are quite believable as two suburbanites caught up in the media frenzy that would inevitably descend upon a self-declared messenger of God.  All this works because of the delightfully even handed script that plays all this for laughs but at the same time offers up the universal message of God in almost all religions.  George Burns is a delight and a revelation playing the soft spoken baseball cap wearing Diety who has to suffer the usual doubts of humanity and the frail fears of his chosen messenger who of course starts out thinking this is a joke.  But the highlight of the film is the gathering of the Religious Media Elite ( a who's who of character actors from the time) preparing a questionaire for God to answer to prove he is indeed God followed up by a hotel room meeting between John Denver and God to answer the questionaire.  A hearing is held and...well...I don't want to give away the ending other than to say it was the most uplifting scene in all the movies from the 70's and a joy to watch and experience.

This film had such an original premise to it at the time of its release and after viewing this film again last week I can say its main strength still rests in the brilliant casting of George Burns as ""the guy upstairs"", if you know who I mean! This low key and charming story is a real favourite of mine and each screening I have of it reaffirms my strong belief that actors dont have to be twenty two, tanned, buffed, and beautiful to be interesting on screen. ""Oh God!"" is that real rarity nowadays of a film that is equally touching, warm and thought provoking all the while carrying a positive message that isn't rammed down our throats.

Depicted in the movie  as an eighty something little guy with glasses, wearing a baseball cap, and with a dry ready wit it somehow totally works and seems perfectly natural. Ever since my first viewing of ""Oh God!"" many years ago whenever my thoughts turn to the ""guy upstairs"", in an instant an  image of George Burns in his basball cap and plaid work shirt shuffling along the street springs automatically to mind.

Jerry has a tough time convincing people that he really has seen the  Almighty (even he thinks he is having a joke played on him at first) which  spawn some nice comic situations, like trying to tell the audience of a TV  chat show what he has seen.I really enjoyed this movie because while it  is undeniably funny with some good lines provided by Burns and great  chemistry between him and John Denver on screen - it is also very thought  provoking. It makes some good points about religion and how we can perceive  God - He can be whatever we want Him to be. (&quot;I`m coming at you in a  way you can understand&quot; says Burns to Denver).I think anyone would  enjoy this movie.

I'm Frank, and I'll be spellin' for Zaggy today while he watches today's local football matchups on the big-screen TV at the pizza parlor next door. For this review I've decided to go over one of my all-time fave movies, ""Oh, God!"" It features my all-time fave singer John Denver as he's helped out by God (George Burns, who even at 80-somethin' years old still has it!). Hey, didja know that John Denver's real name is Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr.? And he was born in Roswell, N.M. about four years before that alleged UFO crash! Coincidence, or conspiracy? I don't know myself...Whoops, where was I...? Oh yeah, I really like this flick `cuz it's got John Denver in it and stuff. He's supposed to become a new prophet for the almighty in the modern world, and with the help of the Main Man, somehow manages to do so, although in a reluctant and somewhat blundering manner. Boy, who knew ol' John had so many talents! I mean, first he puts out those hard-hittin' tunes, then he does a few skits with the Muppets, and now he's gotta spread the Good Word with him wherever he goes! It's kinduva a shame his aircraft-flying talent wasn't equal to all his other capabilities, though. I guess he's hangin' with God for real now! Aw willya look at me, I'm getting' all misty just thinkin' `bout it......Okay, I'm all right now. Baby, I'm all right now. I've also checked out the other two ""Oh, God!"" flicks, but without John Denver and his extraordinary thespian prowess, ""Book 2"" and ""You Devil"" are merely pale imitations of the original. Whoops, Ro'y is yellin' at me to get back to work-- I gotta bag `n' board last week's comic books!
