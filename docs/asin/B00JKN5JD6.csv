Not a fresh idea emerged in this film. Not any style, or intuition or real creativity/imagination. Even 1 kill method was used twice in this flick. Rarely have I given less than 3 to a well produced film, but that didn't even work in its favor, as a less polished, grainy look would've given it a more naturalistic feel. That might've helped and man, is help sorely needed. Well produced does not mean well made. The script made me feel like it was going to break out as a spoof any minute but it didn't. The dialogue was laughable at times. So far as the characters go, I wound up watching for the protags to be slaughtered. A more deserving bunch have rarely graced a horror film. Won't say if I was satisfied or not but after you see it, you will know. The female antags were a total waste. They looked like porn stars and had as much to do as them. The only remotely interesting character was the leader, though his time was brief. Interestingly, I thought he had the look of a porn producer. Surely, the cast could find work in that industry if this one doesn't pan out. The other 2 out of 3 males were blanks, much like the girls. The end was totally inconsistent with what came before it, not in terms of the 'bodies' but what was the point of it all then? They just took over that business and nobody noticed?  I can't say more due to not wanting to spoil anything for anyone. I was heavily disappointed at what came before that though. It should never and could never have gone that way.  The only thing they got kinda right was the gore in a couple of kills.  Overall, what a waste.",2,Horror Junkie's Review: Derivative much?,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,1694,"['Lionsgate', 'Man', 'what', 'become', 'American', 'horror', 'Hangs', 'head', 'down', 'shame', 'Not', 'fresh', 'idea', 'emerged', 'film', 'Not', 'style', 'intuition', 'real', 'creativity/imagination', 'Even', '1', 'kill', 'method', 'was', 'used', 'twice', 'flick', 'Rarely', 'have', 'given', 'less', '3', 'well', 'produced', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'work', 'favor', 'less', 'polished', 'grainy', 'look', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'feel', 'might', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'man', 'help', 'sorely', 'needed', 'Well', 'produced', 'not', 'mean', 'well', 'made', 'script', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'going', 'break', 'out', 'spoof', 'minute', 'did', ""n't"", 'dialogue', 'was', 'laughable', 'times', 'So', 'far', 'characters', 'go', 'wound', 'up', 'watching', 'protags', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'more', 'deserving', 'bunch', 'have', 'rarely', 'graced', 'horror', 'film', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'satisfied', 'not', 'see', 'will', 'know', 'female', 'antags', 'were', 'total', 'waste', 'looked', 'porn', 'stars', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'only', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'character', 'was', 'leader', 'time', 'was', 'brief', 'Interestingly', 'thought', 'had', 'look', 'porn', 'producer', 'Surely', 'cast', 'could', 'find', 'work', 'industry', 'one', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'other', '2', '3', 'males', 'were', 'blanks', 'much', 'girls', 'end', 'was', 'totally', 'inconsistent', 'what', 'came', 'not', 'terms', ""'bodies"", 'what', 'was', 'point', 'then', 'just', 'took', 'over', 'business', 'nobody', 'noticed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'due', 'not', 'wanting', 'spoil', 'anything', 'anyone', 'was', 'heavily', 'disappointed', 'what', 'came', 'though', 'should', 'never', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'kinda', 'right', 'was', 'gore', 'couple', 'kills', 'Overall', 'what', 'waste']",No Vacancy Digital
1696717,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00JKN5JD6,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","I love horror films. If you read enough of what I write you already know this. That's why when I see a sloppy horror film that attempts to take the genre and just add another log on the fire but in the worst way possible I get upset. I sit and wonder why, with so many films that are waiting to be made, why was it this film in particular got the green light or someone to invest in it? Case in point NO VACANCY.The movie tells the story of 7 friends on a vacation trip. These stereotypes have been done so often that you recognize them instantly. The nerd of the group is filming everything with his video camera. The male member of one couple is the bully, always picking on the nerd. The group would have been 8 had not the nerd's girlfriend bowed out at the last minute. A roadblock alters their route and suddenly they have two blowouts in the middle of nowhere. Imagine my surprise when a truck shows up and a guy gives them a lift to town.Here comes the only new twist added to an aging genre. Spoiler alert if you care to watch this movie. They're taken to a nearby town where everyone treats them well. They get free drinks, free food and free motel rooms. But during the night they're gassed and wake to find themselves tied or imprisoned in their rooms. It turns out the entire town is involved in killing the group. Why isn't revealed until the very end but clues were given in the seemingly insignificant opening montage.The movie falls into the genre known as torture porn with the killers less intent on killing their prey than they are in coming up with &#34;creative&#34; ways to kill them. I have yet to understand this in any movie or TV series, the whole idea that now that you have the good guy in your hands why you don't just shoot him but instead take the time to explain just why you are shooting him and instead give him a lecture about how badly you were treated as a child or some other nonsensical reason. It always allows time for them to find a way to escape.If that wasn't enough to steer you clear of this film the ending should. It leaves it open for the possibility of a sequel even though from what you witnessed taking place there should have been no chance of that. If only.The acting is passable with the exception of the leader of the killers who comes off as an actor portraying a role. For me that's the determining factor when I view actors. Did you make me believe you weren't acting? If not, you stink. This guy stinks. So much that I didn't want to watch who got credit for portraying that role. That was a mistake on my part because had I paid closer attention I would have known not to watch anything else he does in the future.If you feel compelled to watch movies in the torture porn genre, if you will watch any movie at all that falls into the horror genre, then by all means give this one a watch. As for myself I think I'll let all I know that this movie isn't worth your time.",1,WATCHING LEAVES YOUR MIND VACANT,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,2931,"['love', 'horror', 'films', 'read', 'enough', 'what', 'write', 'already', 'know', 'why', 'when', 'see', 'sloppy', 'horror', 'film', 'take', 'genre', 'just', 'add', 'log', 'fire', 'worst', 'way', 'possible', 'get', 'upset', 'sit', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'waiting', 'be', 'made', 'why', 'was', 'film', 'particular', 'got', 'green', 'light', 'someone', 'invest', 'Case', 'point', 'NO', 'VACANCY.The', 'movie', 'story', '7', 'friends', 'vacation', 'trip', 'stereotypes', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'often', 'recognize', 'instantly', 'nerd', 'group', 'filming', 'everything', 'video', 'camera', 'male', 'member', 'one', 'couple', 'bully', 'always', 'picking', 'nerd', 'group', 'would', 'have', 'been', '8', 'had', 'not', 'nerd', 'girlfriend', 'bowed', 'out', 'last', 'minute', 'roadblock', 'alters', 'route', 'suddenly', 'have', 'two', 'blowouts', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'truck', 'up', 'guy', 'lift', 'town.Here', 'only', 'new', 'twist', 'added', 'aging', 'genre', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'care', 'watch', 'movie', ""'re"", 'taken', 'nearby', 'town', 'where', 'everyone', 'well', 'get', 'free', 'drinks', 'free', 'food', 'free', 'motel', 'rooms', 'night', ""'re"", 'gassed', 'wake', 'find', 'tied', 'imprisoned', 'rooms', 'out', 'entire', 'town', 'involved', 'killing', 'group', 'Why', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'very', 'end', 'clues', 'were', 'given', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'opening', 'montage.The', 'movie', 'genre', 'known', 'torture', 'porn', 'killers', 'intent', 'killing', 'prey', 'are', 'coming', 'up', '34', 'creative', '34', 'ways', 'kill', 'have', 'yet', 'understand', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'whole', 'idea', 'now', 'have', 'good', 'guy', 'hands', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'shoot', 'instead', 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'just', 'why', 'are', 'shooting', 'instead', 'give', 'lecture', 'how', 'badly', 'were', 'treated', 'child', 'other', 'nonsensical', 'reason', 'always', 'time', 'find', 'way', 'escape.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'steer', 'clear', 'film', 'ending', 'should', 'open', 'possibility', 'sequel', 'even', 'what', 'witnessed', 'taking', 'place', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'chance', 'only.The', 'acting', 'passable', 'exception', 'leader', 'killers', 'who', 'off', 'actor', 'portraying', 'role', 'determining', 'factor', 'when', 'view', 'actors', 'Did', 'make', 'believe', 'were', ""n't"", 'acting', 'not', 'stink', 'guy', 'stinks', 'So', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'who', 'got', 'credit', 'portraying', 'role', 'was', 'mistake', 'part', 'had', 'paid', 'closer', 'attention', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'not', 'watch', 'anything', 'else', 'future.If', 'feel', 'compelled', 'watch', 'movies', 'torture', 'porn', 'genre', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'horror', 'genre', 'then', 'means', 'give', 'one', 'watch', 'think', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time']",No Vacancy Digital
1696718,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00JKN5JD6,Matthew Scott Baker,"[4, 5]","Don&#8217;t confuse this title with the Kate Beckinsale/Luke Wilson thriller VACANCY from 2007&#8230;the covers look slightly similar, but there is no relation between the two movies.  NO VACANCY, an upcoming horror film from Lionsgate, is a film about seven friends who are captured by a group of sadistic killers at a roadside motel and tortured.  And despite that simplistic description, there&#8217;s more to the story than what is mentioned.  But does this movie succeed in entertaining?  I guess the answer to that question depends on what you&#8217;re looking for.The premise of this movie is sound, which is one of the reasons I wanted to like it so much.  I mean, who has not had car trouble in the middle of nowhere?  That in itself is a scary notion, but throw in some overly friendly &#8216;helpers&#8217;, and you&#8217;ve got the potential for a lot of scary situations.Unfortunately, NO VACANCY never really seems to get off the ground.  It looks great and is shot very well&#8230;but there&#8217;s something big missing.  Instead of entertaining and thrilling, I found the film flat and, well, uninteresting for the most part.I think a big point of dissatisfaction for me is the main characters.  They are a snotty and uppity sort, not really likable in any form.  So when bad things start to happen to them, I really didn&#8217;t feel anything for them.  But they&#8217;re not so bad that you want them to die.  As a result, I didn&#8217;t really care one way or the other; my emotion was like &#8220;Eh, whatever&#8221;.Also, the story in NO VACANCY is lacking a bit.  I liked the opening sequence, with the news report about the fire in the orphanage&#8230;but it pretty much broadcasts the big &#8216;twist&#8217; from the start.  From that point on, there&#8217;s not a lot of tension that is built up.  Obviously, you need a bit of suspense if you want a successful horror flick.  Once again, I found myself shrugging my shoulders.I am going to summarize my review with this:  I am simply going to recommend giving this a look for yourself to see how and if you like it.  Maybe it just caught me on an off day or something&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.  If you decide to give it a look, hop back over here and leave us a message with your thoughts.

I cannot believe it's not free on PRIME.  WHAT THE H--L!!!!  I got  ripped off twice tonight by less than B movie status content. Amazon- shame on you for charging us to watch this kind of CACA.  I'm going too have to cut back on my AMAZON purchases until I can make up my losses from all the so called movies I've paid for and downloaded.  If the movie does not have a major film company backing it  up.  This should raise red flags.  It's rare that you ever get an independent movie company kicking out a decent movie these days.  Save your cash.  The only thing gross in this movie is a woman throwing up.  A 2010 trend.  Get over it already producers.  Throwing up is a natural body function.
