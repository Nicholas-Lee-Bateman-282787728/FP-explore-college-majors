His band (I would have liked to name them, but the credits at the end were too small) is excellent, with special kudos to the lead guitarist.The song list:~ with band ~""I Still Have the Dream""""Signs""""Rocketown""""Wired for Sound""""Secret Ambition""""Hibernia"" (a delightful instrumental)~ solo piano ~""Love Crusade""""For You""""Place in this World""""I Will Be Here for You""""Friends""""There She Stands""~ with band and guest performer Amy Grant ~""Lead Me On""""El Shaddai"" (an exquisite solo by Amy)""Thy Word""~ with band ~""Above All""""Agnus Dei""""Awesome God""""You Are Holy (Prince of Peace)""""This is Your Time"".There is a bonus music video of ""Signs"" at the end.total running time 93 minutes.As far as the sound is concerned, one has to take into consideration this is ""live"", and the DVD has better audio quality than the VHS.Movie star handsome and enormously talented, Michael, who his fans call Smitty, just won his third Grammy Award, which he can place next to his 40 Dove awards; a multi-platinum selling composer, singer and musician, he is a marvelous performer, and before the final song, he shares some thoughts with us that are wise and wonderful, telling us how ""worship is a lifestyle"". Though the pop/contemporary genre is not what I usually listen to, I thoroughly enjoy Smitty's music, and this terrific concert.",5,music and worship,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1691,"['Performing', 'vast', 'audience', 'Ohio', 'State', 'University', 'Columbus', 'October', '26', '2003', 'concert', 'inspiring', 'entertaining', 'good', 'introduction', 'twenty', 'years', 'Michael', 'creativity', 'are', 'fairly', 'new', 'music.The', 'musicianship', 'superb', 'Michael', 'playing', 'guitar', 'keyboards', 'piano', 'work', 'art', 'painted', 'swirls', 'color', 'band', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'name', 'credits', 'end', 'were', 'too', 'small', 'excellent', 'special', 'kudos', 'lead', 'guitarist.The', 'song', 'list', '~', 'band', '~', 'Still', 'Have', 'Dream', 'Signs', 'Rocketown', 'Wired', 'Sound', 'Secret', 'Ambition', 'Hibernia', 'delightful', 'instrumental', 'solo', 'piano', '~', 'Love', 'Crusade', 'Place', 'World', 'Will', 'Be', 'Here', 'Friends', '~', 'band', 'guest', 'performer', 'Amy', 'Grant', '~', 'Lead', 'Me', 'El', 'Shaddai', 'exquisite', 'solo', 'Amy', 'Thy', 'Word', '~', 'band', '~', 'Agnus', 'Dei', 'Awesome', 'God', 'Are', 'Holy', 'Prince', 'Peace', 'Your', 'Time', 'bonus', 'music', 'video', 'Signs', 'end.total', 'running', 'time', '93', 'minutes.As', 'far', 'sound', 'concerned', 'take', 'consideration', 'live', 'DVD', 'better', 'audio', 'quality', 'VHS.Movie', 'star', 'handsome', 'enormously', 'talented', 'Michael', 'who', 'fans', 'call', 'Smitty', 'just', 'won', 'third', 'Grammy', 'Award', 'can', 'place', 'next', '40', 'Dove', 'awards', 'multi-platinum', 'selling', 'composer', 'singer', 'musician', 'marvelous', 'performer', 'final', 'song', 'shares', 'thoughts', 'are', 'wise', 'wonderful', 'telling', 'how', 'worship', 'lifestyle', 'pop/contemporary', 'genre', 'not', 'what', 'usually', 'listen', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'Smitty', 'music', 'terrific', 'concert']",N/A
792302,AZ2QRRN8JXR6S,B00013NE72,"Cesar ""juliomontoya2000""","[7, 7]","First of all, I must clearify that I am not a big fan of contemporary Christian music. But Michael Smith's music called my attention since a couple of his songs became pop hits, specially ""Place in this world"". So I'm not going to talk about the message or the meaning of his songs, which undeniably should be reason enough for any fan of Christian music to be attracted to this particular performance. I'd like to concentrate instead in some aspects of interest for any outsider:THE HIGHS.a) I've seen a good share of concerts in DVD. Michael Smith's DVD has one of the bests sounds I've ever heard. The 5.1 mix properly enhance the fullness of the sound. The bass and drums are strong but with no distortion, and the rest of the instruments are crystal clear. This quality is no surprise: from Michael's records, you can tell that the sound is never second rate, and that he, as a performer, pays good attention to that aspect.In that regard, his voice is heard good. Wether you can argue if he has a great voice or not (I think he has a good and appropriate voice) he still sings in concert as he does in studio. So what you've heard, is what you get.b) THE MAIN FEATURE IS WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC, that is, enhanced for widescreen TV's. I'm updating this information since Amazon lists wrongly the aspect ratio as 1:33:1, when actually it is 1:85:1. So we have good image, along with the great sound.c) The inclusion of the ""Signs"" video. At least is something, until a collection of all his videos is released, if ever. The sound of the video is neatly mixed for 5.1, and that's something that you rarely see in an extra. The inclusion of ""The Making of"" this video is a little redundant, but it's still fun to see how they made it.d) Two more videos can be seen in the special features, as alternate angles: ""There she stands"" and ""This is your time"". This is particulary special, because you can see the video that otherwise is played in the concert in the background, but with the sound of the concert, not the original studio sound. ""Sings"" is also included in this feature. Again, at least is something until a video compilation comes out.e) The inclusion of Amy Grant, as a guest artist, in three songs. No duets, though.f) No laser lights, or special effects, or dances, or fake poses. Just a pure and simple performance the old fashion way. Just to enjoy the music and the message.THE LOWS.a) A 20 year celebration deserves more than an hour and a half performance. There are songs that I'd have liked to hear, for instance ""Give it away"" or ""Cry for love"".In that regard, there are a few songs that are piled up in a medley, with piano solo, as if Michael is just fulfilling a compromise to include them. Maybe I have a little prejudice here, because ""Place in this world"", that I wanted to hear complete and with full band and all, is one of those chopped songs. And although the raw performance of Michael and piano reminds us that in the end, it's about the songs and the voice, the medley, followed by ""There she stands"" become a little tedious.b) Amy Grant's voice in Lead me on (the first song she sings) is heard a little low in the beginning.c) The videos that can be watched as alternate angles (check ""c"" in the highs), can only be accessed in the special features menu, not during the concert (at least not in my DVD player). Although you can hear them with the concert audio, the mix for this feature is only stereo, not 5.1.Overall, I must say that I was impressed with what I saw, so the highs overcome the lows, and I think a five star rate is fair.",5,HIGHS and lows,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,3576,"['First', 'must', 'clearify', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'contemporary', 'Christian', 'music', 'Michael', 'Smith', 'music', 'called', 'attention', 'couple', 'songs', 'became', 'pop', 'hits', 'specially', 'Place', 'world', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'talk', 'message', 'meaning', 'songs', 'undeniably', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'fan', 'Christian', 'music', 'be', 'attracted', 'particular', 'performance', ""'d"", 'like', 'concentrate', 'instead', 'aspects', 'interest', 'outsider', 'HIGHS.a', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'share', 'concerts', 'DVD', 'Michael', 'Smith', 'DVD', 'one', 'bests', 'sounds', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', '5.1', 'mix', 'properly', 'enhance', 'fullness', 'sound', 'bass', 'drums', 'are', 'strong', 'distortion', 'rest', 'instruments', 'are', 'crystal', 'clear', 'quality', 'surprise', 'Michael', 'records', 'can', 'tell', 'sound', 'never', 'second', 'rate', 'performer', 'pays', 'good', 'attention', 'aspect.In', 'regard', 'voice', 'heard', 'good', 'can', 'argue', 'great', 'voice', 'not', 'think', 'good', 'appropriate', 'voice', 'still', 'concert', 'studio', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'what', 'get.b', 'MAIN', 'FEATURE', 'IS', 'WIDESCREEN', 'ANAMORPHIC', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'TV', ""'m"", 'updating', 'information', 'Amazon', 'wrongly', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1:33:1', 'when', 'actually', '1:85:1', 'have', 'good', 'image', 'great', 'sound.c', 'inclusion', 'Signs', 'video', 'least', 'something', 'collection', 'videos', 'released', 'ever', 'sound', 'video', 'neatly', 'mixed', '5.1', 'something', 'rarely', 'see', 'extra', 'inclusion', 'Making', 'video', 'little', 'redundant', 'still', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'made', 'it.d', 'Two', 'more', 'videos', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'special', 'features', 'alternate', 'angles', 'time', 'particulary', 'special', 'can', 'see', 'video', 'otherwise', 'played', 'concert', 'background', 'sound', 'concert', 'not', 'original', 'studio', 'sound', 'Sings', 'also', 'included', 'feature', 'Again', 'least', 'something', 'video', 'compilation', 'out.e', 'inclusion', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'guest', 'artist', 'three', 'songs', 'duets', 'though.f', 'No', 'laser', 'lights', 'special', 'effects', 'dances', 'fake', 'poses', 'Just', 'pure', 'simple', 'performance', 'old', 'fashion', 'way', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'music', 'message.THE', 'LOWS.a', '20', 'year', 'celebration', 'more', 'hour', 'half', 'performance', 'are', 'songs', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'instance', 'Give', 'away', 'Cry', 'love', 'regard', 'are', 'few', 'songs', 'are', 'piled', 'up', 'medley', 'piano', 'solo', 'Michael', 'just', 'fulfilling', 'compromise', 'include', 'Maybe', 'have', 'little', 'prejudice', 'here', 'Place', 'world', 'wanted', 'hear', 'complete', 'full', 'band', 'one', 'chopped', 'songs', 'raw', 'performance', 'Michael', 'piano', 'reminds', 'end', 'songs', 'voice', 'medley', 'followed', 'become', 'little', 'tedious.b', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'voice', 'Lead', 'first', 'song', 'sings', 'heard', 'little', 'low', 'beginning.c', 'videos', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'alternate', 'angles', 'check', 'c', 'highs', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'accessed', 'special', 'features', 'menu', 'not', 'concert', 'least', 'not', 'DVD', 'player', 'can', 'hear', 'concert', 'audio', 'mix', 'feature', 'only', 'stereo', 'not', '5.1.Overall', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'what', 'saw', 'highs', 'overcome', 'lows', 'think', 'five', 'star', 'rate', 'fair']",N/A

SmithIn a mosaic of contemporary Christian classics, Michael W. Smith creates an atmosphere of worship. He is more than a signpost to help us find a way to worship God, his voice is a musical portal that opens the heart and encourages a full participation in the worship of our Creator. His heart is all encompassing as he sings and invites the audience to join him in his choice to make worship a lifestyle.This concert has a variety of musical styles with global appeal. As a teenager I enjoyed a few of his first songs while living in Africa and only later realized that his music had infused the world with a love for God. ""Friends"" was a song I knew before I knew who Michael W. Smith was and his songs are gifts to the world that change lives and provide a place for souls to find comfort.Surprise: Amy Grant joins Michael and sings El Shaddai and Thy Word - both unforgettable.The Special features include: ""Alternate Angle, Signs - Music Video, Making of Signs, Behind the Scenes, Photo Album and Compassion International.""I went to a concert in Seattle, WA and it was ""the"" most spiritual experience of my life. Once you experience a Michael W. Smith concert, your life is changed forever. There is a place that opens in your heart that can't be closed again. The powerful feeling of love and connection to God is one I've never experienced in any other concert.Michael's voice is as beautiful as ever and his love for God has deepened and his concern for the world is very evident.~The Rebecca Review",5,His love never ends...,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,1563,"['becoming', 'harder', '~Michael', 'W.', 'SmithIn', 'mosaic', 'contemporary', 'Christian', 'classics', 'Michael', 'W.', 'Smith', 'atmosphere', 'worship', 'more', 'signpost', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'worship', 'God', 'voice', 'musical', 'portal', 'heart', 'full', 'participation', 'worship', 'Creator', 'heart', 'all', 'encompassing', 'audience', 'join', 'choice', 'make', 'worship', 'lifestyle.This', 'concert', 'variety', 'musical', 'styles', 'global', 'appeal', 'teenager', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'first', 'songs', 'living', 'Africa', 'only', 'later', 'realized', 'music', 'had', 'infused', 'world', 'love', 'God', 'Friends', 'was', 'song', 'knew', 'knew', 'who', 'Michael', 'W.', 'Smith', 'was', 'songs', 'are', 'gifts', 'world', 'change', 'lives', 'provide', 'place', 'souls', 'find', 'comfort.Surprise', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'Michael', 'sings', 'El', 'Shaddai', 'Thy', 'Word', 'unforgettable.The', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'Alternate', 'Angle', 'Signs', 'Music', 'Video', 'Making', 'Signs', 'Scenes', 'Photo', 'Album', 'Compassion', 'International', 'went', 'concert', 'Seattle', 'WA', 'was', 'most', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'life', 'experience', 'Michael', 'W.', 'Smith', 'concert', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'place', 'heart', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'closed', 'again', 'powerful', 'feeling', 'love', 'connection', 'God', 'one', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'other', 'concert.Michael', 'voice', 'as', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'love', 'God', 'deepened', 'concern', 'world', 'very', 'evident.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Smith commemorated his twentieth anniversary of Christian music ministry with this special concert taped in Columbus, Ohio.  This DVD captures a show that delivers many of Smitty's greatest songs of the last two decades.  The songs from the 1980's (""Rocketown""/""Wired for Sound""/""Secret Ambition"") are my overall favorites, as I began listening to MWS in 1986 with ""The Big Picture.""  I also love the worship portion of the show (""Above All""/""Agnus Dei""/""Awesome God""/""You Are Holy"").  And Amy Grant's guest appearance is another great highlight.  The special features include a behind the scenes featurette, plus the conceptual video for ""Signs"" and a featurette on the making of that video.
