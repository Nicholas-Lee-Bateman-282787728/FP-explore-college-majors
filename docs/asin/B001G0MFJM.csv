1192663,A1XQVED2NX33TN,B001G0MFJM,Catnip,"[7, 10]","I've enjoyed this series since it was doing reruns the first summer it aired.  It's a great show and the characters are entertaining, individualistic, and just down right likeable.  However, in the last two seasons I've found that there is that special something missing.  No, it's not Jen Shepards character either.  I was rather glad to see her go.  This new dude, Leon, is much better and seems like he has a handle on things where her character was all over the board and not believeable in that kind of position.  I'm a women and women in those kinds of directorial rolls, yeah, not so much.  Anyway, I've noticed something is just missing since the writers strike.  There's something off with the characters.  I watch shows from the first 4 seasons and it's there, but once 5 and 6 hit, it's almost totally lacking.  I wish they'd get that back.  Don't know if certain writers aren't there anymore or that, because of the strike and the break they had the writers lost their mojo..?  It's disappointing but, I still watch the show.  Even though they're more blasie and never really leave me going WOW!!  like the first 4 seasons.  The only head knocker about the 6th season was the finale, the very end with Ziva tied up, beaten and, in general, not looking so hot.The same thing happened to CSI: MIAMI.  Great first few seasons and then...they changed the format or something.  It became iffy, at best.Oh well, here's hoping for next season.  Now I saw they're going to have an NCIS: LA..jezz people, come up with some new ideas already!  They had that pilot in with the original NCIS and I wasn't impressed with the characters or the idea (even though I like LL Cool J and Chris ODonnel)...once again, not so much.  Recylced ideas, how's that original??",3,"Good, but not as good as the first 4 seasons...",1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1761,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'series', 'was', 'doing', 'reruns', 'first', 'summer', 'aired', 'great', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'entertaining', 'individualistic', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'likeable', 'However', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'found', 'special', 'something', 'missing', 'No', 'not', 'Jen', 'Shepards', 'character', 'either', 'was', 'rather', 'glad', 'see', 'go', 'new', 'dude', 'Leon', 'much', 'better', 'handle', 'things', 'where', 'character', 'was', 'board', 'not', 'believeable', 'kind', 'position', ""'m"", 'women', 'women', 'kinds', 'directorial', 'rolls', 'yeah', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Anyway', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'something', 'just', 'missing', 'writers', 'strike', 'something', 'off', 'characters', 'watch', 'shows', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'there', 'once', '5', '6', 'hit', 'almost', 'totally', 'lacking', 'wish', ""'d"", 'get', 'back', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'certain', 'writers', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'anymore', 'strike', 'break', 'had', 'writers', 'lost', 'mojo..', 'disappointing', 'still', 'watch', 'show', 'Even', ""'re"", 'more', 'blasie', 'never', 'really', 'leave', 'going', 'WOW', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'only', 'head', 'knocker', '6th', 'season', 'was', 'finale', 'very', 'end', 'Ziva', 'tied', 'up', 'beaten', 'general', 'not', 'looking', 'so', 'hot.The', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'CSI', 'MIAMI', 'Great', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'then', 'changed', 'format', 'something', 'became', 'iffy', 'best.Oh', 'well', 'here', 'hoping', 'next', 'season', 'Now', 'saw', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'NCIS', 'LA..jezz', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'ideas', 'already', 'had', 'pilot', 'original', 'NCIS', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'characters', 'idea', 'even', 'like', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'Chris', 'ODonnel', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Recylced', 'ideas', 'how', 'original']",NCIS: Seasons One - Six
