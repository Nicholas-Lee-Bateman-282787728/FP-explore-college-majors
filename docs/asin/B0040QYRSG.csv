I had to make many exceptions in ""The Possession of David O'Reilly.""  This absolute mess of a movie was so stupid and so UNBELIEVABLE I wanted to reach through the television screen, shake the three people, and slap them until my arms got tired.  There was no ""going with the flow"" in this movie; there was no flow to go with.  Just three fraidy-cats holed up in an apartment because one supposedly ""saw things.""Anyone with one living brain cell could tell that Mr. O'Reilly was a nut-burger.  He shows up as a buzz a**hole whining because he and his wife/girlfriend have just split up.  He has some kind of writing ""book"" his wifey-poo gave him to ""jot down ideas,"" and what he's jotted down ain't ideas.  There are some truly bizarre, disturbing images in there.After the first night when David becomes even more unhinged, instead of leaving, the other two ignoramuses stay right there, in tow, with David (who by now is weilding a rather sharp knife).  If that's not unbelievable enough, after the SECOND night's COMPLETE freak-out by David, whereupon he finally tells the two what's going on, they STILL stay inside the apartment--and Davie-boy STILL has the knife.  Hell, he even suggests that he GO SOMEWHERE ELSE, but, oh no; they're not having it.There simply is no ""possession,"" so if you think you're going to watch another tired retread of ""The Exorcist,"" save your money, buy THAT movie, and you'll be MUCH happier.",1,and The Winner for the Most Stupid Movie Ever Made...,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1507,"['Rarely', 'do', 'mean', 'rarely', 'have', 'EVER', 'talked', 'back', 'television', 'screen', 'had', 'make', 'many', 'exceptions', 'Possession', 'David', ""O'Reilly"", 'absolute', 'mess', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'so', 'UNBELIEVABLE', 'wanted', 'reach', 'television', 'screen', 'shake', 'three', 'people', 'slap', 'arms', 'got', 'tired', 'was', 'going', 'flow', 'movie', 'was', 'flow', 'go', 'Just', 'three', 'fraidy-cats', 'holed', 'up', 'apartment', 'one', 'supposedly', 'saw', 'things', 'Anyone', 'one', 'living', 'brain', 'cell', 'could', 'tell', 'Mr.', ""O'Reilly"", 'was', 'nut-burger', 'up', 'buzz', 'a**hole', 'whining', 'wife/girlfriend', 'have', 'just', 'split', 'up', 'kind', 'writing', 'book', 'wifey-poo', 'gave', 'jot', 'down', 'ideas', 'what', 'jotted', 'down', 'ai', ""n't"", 'ideas', 'are', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'disturbing', 'images', 'there.After', 'first', 'night', 'when', 'David', 'even', 'more', 'unhinged', 'instead', 'leaving', 'other', 'two', 'ignoramuses', 'stay', 'right', 'there', 'tow', 'David', 'who', 'now', 'weilding', 'rather', 'sharp', 'knife', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'enough', 'SECOND', 'night', 'COMPLETE', 'freak-out', 'David', 'whereupon', 'finally', 'two', 'what', 'going', 'STILL', 'stay', 'apartment', 'Davie-boy', 'STILL', 'knife', 'Hell', 'even', 'GO', 'SOMEWHERE', 'ELSE', ""'re"", 'not', 'having', 'it.There', 'simply', 'possession', 'so', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'tired', 'retread', 'Exorcist', 'save', 'money', 'buy', 'THAT', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'MUCH', 'happier']",Possession of David O'reilly
1379592,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0040QYRSG,J from NY,"[2, 2]","""The Possession of David O Reilly"" has to be one of the most effective low budget movies I have ever seen.  Giles Anderson, director of ""Taken"" and a few other blockbuster films gives one of the most convincing (and brave) performances from a male actor that one could hope for.  If you've ever wondered why films about demonic possession almost always feature young girls as the vulnerable, soon-to-be-possessed vessels of the demonic, this movie is your antidote.David, a tall and looming young man, shows up at his two friend's houses (Alex and Kate) distressed about recent (perceived? real?) developments in his relationship with a girl named Sarah.  He has, apparently, discovered photos of her naked with another man.  The couple are sympathetic to him and offer him a room for the night to recover from his romantic fallout.  Big mistake.For reasons that are never made clear to the viewer, David notices a slight sound in his room and says emphatically, ""Not here, please.""  This is the start of either some vicious possession or, most likely, the most convincing nervous breakdown I have ever seen on camera, as David finds himself unable to sleep and is absolutely convinced that he and his friends are under attack from some invisible entity.  The power of suggestion (or a real presence?) is enough to make his friend Alex follow his lead in absolute panic, turning off the lights and even allowing David to run amuck with a large butcher knife in his hand.  While some of this sounds unrealistic (why don't they subdue and drive him to the nearest psychiatric hospital?) you can actually see it occurring if two people were unprepared for a seemingly normal man to lose his s*** in the scariest way possible.  If he never had problems like this before, where is it coming from and why?  The viewer runs from room to room with David and the hapless couple, seeing either his hallucinations or what is actually a demonic presence.  Needless to say, really, this does not end well.  David's notebooks, filled with scrawls of demons and other languages, suggests that this might have been going on for longer than one night.This is like a hyper caffeinated madcap rush of ""Paranormal Activity"" without the pacing.  In contrast to most viewers, I found this viscerally terrifying and would recommend it to any fan of the horror genre.",5,Genuinely frightening,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,2343,"['Possession', 'David', 'O', 'Reilly', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Giles', 'Anderson', 'director', 'Taken', 'few', 'other', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'one', 'most', 'convincing', 'brave', 'performances', 'male', 'actor', 'one', 'could', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'why', 'films', 'demonic', 'possession', 'almost', 'always', 'feature', 'young', 'girls', 'vulnerable', 'soon-to-be-possessed', 'vessels', 'demonic', 'movie', 'antidote.David', 'tall', 'looming', 'young', 'man', 'up', 'two', 'friend', 'houses', 'Alex', 'Kate', 'distressed', 'recent', 'perceived', 'real', 'developments', 'relationship', 'girl', 'named', 'Sarah', 'apparently', 'discovered', 'photos', 'naked', 'man', 'couple', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'offer', 'room', 'night', 'recover', 'romantic', 'fallout', 'Big', 'mistake.For', 'reasons', 'are', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'viewer', 'David', 'slight', 'sound', 'room', 'emphatically', 'Not', 'here', 'please', 'start', 'vicious', 'possession', 'most', 'likely', 'most', 'convincing', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'camera', 'David', 'unable', 'sleep', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'friends', 'are', 'attack', 'invisible', 'entity', 'power', 'suggestion', 'real', 'presence', 'enough', 'make', 'friend', 'Alex', 'follow', 'lead', 'absolute', 'panic', 'turning', 'off', 'lights', 'even', 'allowing', 'David', 'run', 'amuck', 'large', 'butcher', 'knife', 'hand', 'unrealistic', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'subdue', 'drive', 'nearest', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'occurring', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'unprepared', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'man', 'lose', 's***', 'scariest', 'way', 'possible', 'never', 'had', 'problems', 'before', 'where', 'coming', 'why', 'viewer', 'room', 'room', 'David', 'hapless', 'couple', 'seeing', 'hallucinations', 'what', 'actually', 'demonic', 'presence', 'Needless', 'say', 'really', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'David', 'notebooks', 'filled', 'scrawls', 'demons', 'other', 'languages', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'longer', 'one', 'night.This', 'hyper', 'caffeinated', 'madcap', 'rush', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'pacing', 'contrast', 'most', 'viewers', 'found', 'viscerally', 'terrifying', 'would', 'recommend', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre']",Possession of David O'reilly

But, it intrigued me enough to want to purchase it.  Now that I have it in my collection, I can say I'm not at all disappointed I did. It is not one of those exploitation films with blood and gore. I would say it is more on the creepy side. At first, you think the main character, David, is slowly going insane. You only see glimses of the &#34;monsters&#34; David is so afraid of and the other two don't ever really see them. Plus, all of the hysteria created by David, causes two of the three people to kill each other.  But by the end , it made a believer of me. It is one of the most creepy and scary films I've seen in a long time; and I've been a horror fan all my life.

1379594,A31HRLUCEA0Z9D,B0040QYRSG,Sunshine Greeny,"[2, 2]","**may contain spoilers**One of the things I enjoyed about this obscure gem is that it avoids much of the formulaic characteristics overused by similar genre films in recent days. Even though within the narrative there clearly *is* a supernatural element at work (established early on, in fact) the film does a good job of twisting it all around by likewise establishing doubt, making the viewer question which reality is occurring: is David delusional, as his friends sort of suspect, or is he, and subsequently them as well, actually being menaced by a sinister entity?The story unfolds as David arrives unannounced and out of sorts at his friend's apartment house, seeking comfort upon discovering that his longtime girlfriend is cheating on him. If the viewer is following closely, clues are provided suggesting David knows he's being followed by ..something unknown. Ambiguity is used effectively as there are several cryptic, yet essential bits of information the viewer is given at the onset, including erotic photographs of David's girlfriend and her lover that he finds, and the demonic unease that proceeds to overwhelm him.What might one have to do with the other? Why is David suddenly 'seeing things' that may or may not be brought on by paranoia and psychological breakdown? How did David know to use salt in front of the doors to keep...what exactly(?)...from crossing over? Phantom noises, knocks and rappings begin to manifest, and David exclaims, ""not here,"" indicating that the presence has followed him from his home to theirs.Wisely, more questions arise than what are ever answered throughout the totality of the film, serving to further heighten tension, anxiety, and ultimately all-out horror as David and his friends spend the night fighting off and fleeing from demons.The Possession of David O'reilly is a genre film that fans either seem to love or hate. If you're seeking a traditional Possessed Young Girl movie, replete with a foul-mouthed, nightgown sporting teenager gnashing her teeth, growling, writhing and gesticulating wildly (I always suspected that genuine evil would be more intelligent and far trickier than wasting time with such nonsense, but I digress), than The Possession of David O'reilly may not for you. To be fair, there are a few missed opportunities. The film's makers maybe could've fleshed out a few of the background and peripheral bits of mysterious data to slightly better effect...although really, it's because the viewer is left only knowing David's side of the story that contributes to the sense of unease and dread.",5,"""Not Here...""",1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,2577,"['**may', 'contain', 'spoilers**One', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'obscure', 'gem', 'much', 'formulaic', 'characteristics', 'overused', 'similar', 'genre', 'films', 'recent', 'days', 'Even', 'narrative', 'clearly', '*is*', 'supernatural', 'element', 'work', 'established', 'early', 'fact', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'twisting', 'likewise', 'establishing', 'doubt', 'making', 'viewer', 'question', 'reality', 'occurring', 'David', 'delusional', 'friends', 'sort', 'suspect', 'subsequently', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'being', 'menaced', 'sinister', 'entity', 'story', 'David', 'unannounced', 'sorts', 'friend', 'apartment', 'house', 'seeking', 'comfort', 'discovering', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'viewer', 'following', 'closely', 'clues', 'are', 'provided', 'suggesting', 'David', 'being', 'followed', '..something', 'unknown', 'Ambiguity', 'used', 'effectively', 'are', 'several', 'cryptic', 'yet', 'essential', 'bits', 'information', 'viewer', 'given', 'onset', 'including', 'erotic', 'photographs', 'David', 'girlfriend', 'lover', 'demonic', 'unease', 'overwhelm', 'him.What', 'might', 'one', 'have', 'do', 'other', 'Why', 'David', 'suddenly', ""'seeing"", 'things', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'brought', 'paranoia', 'psychological', 'breakdown', 'How', 'did', 'David', 'know', 'use', 'salt', 'front', 'doors', 'keep', 'what', 'exactly', 'crossing', 'over', 'Phantom', 'knocks', 'rappings', 'begin', 'manifest', 'David', 'not', 'here', 'indicating', 'presence', 'followed', 'home', 'theirs.Wisely', 'more', 'questions', 'arise', 'what', 'are', 'ever', 'answered', 'totality', 'film', 'serving', 'further', 'heighten', 'tension', 'anxiety', 'ultimately', 'all-out', 'horror', 'David', 'friends', 'spend', 'night', 'fighting', 'off', 'fleeing', 'demons.The', 'Possession', 'David', ""O'reilly"", 'genre', 'film', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', ""'re"", 'seeking', 'traditional', 'Possessed', 'Young', 'Girl', 'movie', 'replete', 'foul-mouthed', 'nightgown', 'sporting', 'teenager', 'gnashing', 'teeth', 'growling', 'writhing', 'gesticulating', 'wildly', 'always', 'suspected', 'genuine', 'evil', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'intelligent', 'far', 'trickier', 'wasting', 'time', 'such', 'nonsense', 'digress', 'Possession', 'David', ""O'reilly"", 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'few', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'film', 'makers', 'maybe', 'could', ""'ve"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'few', 'background', 'peripheral', 'bits', 'mysterious', 'data', 'slightly', 'better', 'effect', 'really', 'viewer', 'left', 'only', 'knowing', 'David', 'side', 'story', 'sense', 'unease', 'dread']",Possession of David O'reilly
1379595,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0040QYRSG,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[16, 18]","The movie slowly builds up. It starts out with a young couple Alex and Kate watching TV. She talks in her sleep, ""Don't open it."" Alex wakes her and they laugh about it. Then the doorbell rings. It is quarter past midnight...as it turns out it is their friend David O'Reilly who brings no luggage, but a lot of emotional baggage. His girlfriend Sarah has left him. He had found some photos of her posing on a bed. Who took them? It must be her lover. David and Alex stay up talking. David is very annoying with his cigarette puffs, long pauses, rocking motion, and dowdy appearance. David doesn't want to sleep. He sees glimpses of demons in the corner of his eye. Later the visions become more pronounced as David starts acting more psychotic, having flash backs. Eventually the whole household is in an uproar as David sleep walks and now is carrying around a knife. Soon Alex starts to see glimpses of the creatures that David now sees plainly while Kate still sees nothing. David shows all the signs of a psychotic who just murdered his girlfriend and is dually suffering from sleep deprivation, who has sucked in his friend Alex with the power of suggestion. But is that the case? I watched the whole thing and I still don't know.I thought the movie was better than Paranormal Activity, but then what wasn't. It is not filmed as a documentary type film, although much of the scenes take place at night and in poorly lit areas. I am not sure what these people did during daylight hours as it they must be living in the part of England that gets only one hour of light a day (similar to vampire films). The acting was better than most with Giles Alderson giving us a convincing performance as David.No sex. No nudity.
