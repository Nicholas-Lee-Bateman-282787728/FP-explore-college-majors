620542,AOUFNKPTMAIHO,B00005JMNV,vent,"[1, 1]","Okay will give this one a three stars based on the cast managing to act at all  because they are pretty much being held hostage in what looks like a Disney Tweeny movie complete with cartoon and I do mean animated parrot. The cartoon dog pops up on demand and no I'm not making that up.This is a mildly cute plot line, emphasis on mildly,  with Two Prems and some mistaken Identity. That much you already know . The story is not a bad one per se just very child like . The only problem for the producer is whether or not he was trying to rope in an older audience . If he was he bombed on that one. If his target audience was young families with children about 10 years to what the heck lets stretch the imagination big time ( consider the parrot) and say 15 max then he was dead on. The only reason I can see watching this one over and over would be for the Hrithik Roshan beefcake even though his character seemed like he had been hitting the cold medications a little hard in the mornings. Perky beyond perky and taking his shirt off alot. Seemed like he was imitating Salu.  Abi's very well understated acting on the shy guy was a good performance. Plus Abi's just plain cute in his own right . Might pop it into the player again sometime soon.Save this one for the Tweeny's or when you are feeling very nostalgic and instead try ""The Game"" with Abihishek or let's see ""Agneepath"" was to violent for me...hmm try Hrithik in Krish was enjoyable.. Dhoom 2 just for his Dancing in the front and the end of the movie though I did like it except for the lame lines they gave Aish.  Zindagi Nah milegi dobara heard it was good . There's always Desi Boyz much better fun and script but neither one of them is in that one ...sorry was beefcake distracted there for a minute..Side note if you are really strict about any rolling around on the beach scenes then preview it before the kids, no nudity or swearing . Ten and above should enjoy it.",3,Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon.....really means dude what's up with that parrot,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,1938,"['Okay', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'three', 'stars', 'based', 'cast', 'managing', 'act', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'what', 'Disney', 'Tweeny', 'movie', 'complete', 'cartoon', 'do', 'mean', 'animated', 'parrot', 'cartoon', 'dog', 'up', 'demand', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up.This', 'mildly', 'cute', 'plot', 'line', 'emphasis', 'mildly', 'Two', 'Prems', 'mistaken', 'Identity', 'much', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'se', 'just', 'very', 'child', 'only', 'problem', 'producer', 'not', 'was', 'trying', 'rope', 'older', 'audience', 'was', 'bombed', 'one', 'target', 'audience', 'was', 'young', 'families', 'children', '10', 'years', 'what', 'heck', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'big', 'time', 'consider', 'parrot', 'say', '15', 'max', 'then', 'was', 'dead', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'one', 'over', 'over', 'would', 'be', 'Hrithik', 'Roshan', 'beefcake', 'even', 'character', 'seemed', 'had', 'been', 'hitting', 'cold', 'medications', 'little', 'hard', 'mornings', 'Perky', 'perky', 'taking', 'shirt', 'alot', 'Seemed', 'was', 'imitating', 'Salu', 'Abi', 'very', 'well', 'understated', 'acting', 'shy', 'guy', 'was', 'good', 'performance', 'Abi', 'just', 'plain', 'cute', 'own', 'right', 'Might', 'pop', 'player', 'again', 'sometime', 'soon.Save', 'one', 'Tweeny', 'when', 'are', 'feeling', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'instead', 'try', 'Game', 'Abihishek', 'let', 'see', 'Agneepath', 'was', 'violent', 'hmm', 'try', 'Hrithik', 'Krish', 'was', 'enjoyable..', 'Dhoom', '2', 'just', 'Dancing', 'front', 'end', 'movie', 'did', 'lame', 'lines', 'gave', 'Aish', 'Zindagi', 'Nah', 'milegi', 'dobara', 'heard', 'was', 'good', 'always', 'Desi', 'Boyz', 'much', 'better', 'fun', 'script', 'one', 'one', 'sorry', 'was', 'beefcake', 'distracted', 'minute..Side', 'note', 'are', 'really', 'strict', 'rolling', 'around', 'beach', 'scenes', 'then', 'preview', 'kids', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'Ten', 'above', 'should', 'enjoy']",Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon
