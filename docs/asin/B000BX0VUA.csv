952104,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000BX0VUA,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[4, 4]","Saraband, Bergman's last film, is about a family destroyed with hostility, obsession, attempted suicide, pain, hatred and music.  As a follow-up to the successful Scenes from A Marriage, 30 years ago.  Marianne, a lawyer, visits her wealthy through an inheritance, ex-husband Johan, 86, who lives in the forest near the lake.  During the marriage, he was unfaithful.  Living nearby is Johan's 60ish son Henrik, who heads an orchestra and his 19-year old daughter, a celloist, Karin, who is taught by her father. Johan and Henrik despise each other.Henrik's wife died two years ago and he is miserable.  He has an unhealthy obsession, in other words, an incestual relationship with his daughter.  Bergman clearly leaves that impression as they sleep in the same bed. Karin is the recipient of his pain.Marianne encounters the sadness of Karin, they share talks openly, and Marianne learns the hostility of Henrik of his father.  Through a letter Karin discovered, she learns about Anna, the wife who died.A memorable quote:Henrik speaking to Marianne of his father:  ""I hate him in every dimension of the word.  I hate him so much I'd happily watch him die of some horrible disease.  I'd visit him daily and take note of his torment down to the last breath.""The movie is set in chapters, uniquely played out. Most scenes call for two persons and no one else enters, it becomes a closed set without intrusions.  The sets were manufactured with great detail. And Bergman favors the close-up shots.  The film is lengthy, quiet, and absorbing.A special treat is to view the master at work in The Making of Saraband, and moreso, you will see readings by the actors.  This treat offers great insight into Bergman's work.  Enjoy!

952105,A2M588INISMZAV,B000BX0VUA,Alojz Kajinic,"[2, 2]","One of the things that truly impressed me with this film is the meticulous attention that Bergman paid to small details.  His selection of music is a case in point.The second movement of Bach's Fifth Cello Suite (Sarabande), whose excerpts we hear in this film, is intimate and very sorrowful (almost like a piece of funeral music), as if to signal the end of the road.  The non-chordal nature of this movement (it consists of a single melodic line) was a great way to subtly remind us of the existential loneliness of the four main characters, as well as our own.Or, take for example Bruckner's Ninth Symphony, which Johan (one of the four main characters) was listening to very loudly in one scene.  Bruckner spent the last nine years of his life composing this symphony (and actually never finishing it).  Its Adagio is contended, at least by some Brucknerites, to be a farewell to life.This very last of Bergman's films feels like his own requiem.  It can make us sad, that's for sure.  But the music of his cinematography is still heavenly beautiful.",5,The end of the road,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1055,"['One', 'things', 'truly', 'impressed', 'film', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'Bergman', 'paid', 'small', 'details', 'selection', 'music', 'case', 'point.The', 'second', 'movement', 'Bach', 'Fifth', 'Cello', 'Suite', 'Sarabande', 'excerpts', 'hear', 'film', 'intimate', 'very', 'sorrowful', 'almost', 'piece', 'funeral', 'music', 'signal', 'end', 'road', 'non-chordal', 'nature', 'movement', 'single', 'melodic', 'line', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'subtly', 'remind', 'existential', 'loneliness', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'own.Or', 'take', 'example', 'Bruckner', 'Ninth', 'Symphony', 'Johan', 'one', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'listening', 'very', 'loudly', 'one', 'scene', 'Bruckner', 'spent', 'last', 'nine', 'years', 'life', 'composing', 'symphony', 'actually', 'never', 'finishing', 'Adagio', 'contended', 'least', 'Brucknerites', 'be', 'farewell', 'life.This', 'very', 'last', 'Bergman', 'films', 'feels', 'own', 'requiem', 'can', 'make', 'sad', 'sure', 'music', 'cinematography', 'still', 'heavenly', 'beautiful']",Saraband
952106,A4VH04TA14CPE,B000BX0VUA,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[4, 5]","At first, ""Saraband"" seems to be a sequel to ""Scenes From a Marriage."" The main characters are named Johan and Marianne, played by Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann. They were once married for a long time, and had two children together. Then they got divorced, but are still drawn to each other, years later.However, there's a lot of new back-story. Johan now has another son from another marriage. That son has an alienated teenage daughter who has great musical talents, and needless to say, father, son and grand-daughter do not get along. At first, this feels like unnecessary weight hung onto the story of ""Scenes From A Marriage,"" which had enough back-story of its own. But ultimately, I agree with the reviewer who suggested that ""Saraband"" is actually not about the same people at all. The protagonists are a totally different divorced couple, but they happen to also be named Johan and Marianne. It's similar to how Bergman reused names like Vogler and Vergerus in hisearlierfilms.What happens next is pretty much what always happens in Bergman films. The characters engage in horrific emotional abuse. In my review of ""Persona,"" I said that all Bergman films are about people elaborately inflicting emotional suffering on each other. That rule certainly holds here. Johan despises his son, and crudely insults him in conversation. Liv Ullmann, as Marianne, smiles cutely, her dimples twinkling merrily, but her contempt for Johan is even deeper and more subtle. She knows his weaknesses more than anyone else; she humiliated him by moving on to have an extensive sex life after he divorced her, even while he was already beginning to wither away. Many times in this film, it feels like the only reason why she came to see Johan now is to feel her own power and superiority over him one more time. In a powerful scene involving Johan's night terrors, she finally takes pity on him, but even that is really another expression of her victory, since she doesn't intend to take him back.The other major conflict is between Karin and her father. The father is basically a softer, more vulnerable version of the well-meaning but stifling parent figure that Bergman explored in ""Autumn Sonata"" (and just like in that film, music is the nominal reason for the conflict). His extreme emotional neediness is made clear in the nightmarish kissing scene (if there's one scene in ""Saraband"" that stays in one's mind, it's that one), in which the daughter ambiguously seems to relish in the power she has over him.So if you're wondering whether Bergman might have lost his touch in the 20 years that passed between ""Fanny and Alexander"" and ""Saraband,"" you can put your mind at ease. He's in his prime here, as cold and brutal as ever. ""Saraband"" is just as intense as ""Scenes From A Marriage.""But at the same time, the film's very strength is its weakness. It's another flawless, vicious emotional assault from the master...but that makes it feel exactly like one of his seventies films. It could have easily been made in 1975 with the exact same story and script. The only hint that it was actually made in 2003 can be seen in Karin's contemporary-looking tank top (which she wears with no bra underneath -- oh Ingmar, you've still got it). The tank top is seriously the only sign of the times to be found in the whole film; it stands out so much that it feels out of place. The film takes place in a remote rural region, so there are no traces of modern technology to get in the way of Bergman's trip back in time.The reason why Bergman's perfect seventies recreation is a weakness is because he had actually begun to venture outside this emotional range in ""Fanny And Alexander."" The latter film was pretty much the only time when Bergman ever took a real interest in something other than senseless cruelty, and depicted other types of human interaction in a believable way. Possibly this was because the film dealt with childhood, which Bergman has felt nostalgic for ever since ""Wild Strawberries."" In any case, it was a sign that maybe, he was taking steps to move beyond the worldview that he depicted in the seventies.But there are no such signs in ""Saraband."" In that sense, the film is a step backward, because it really is identical in tone to ""Scenes From A Marriage,"" ""Cries And Whispers,"" ""Persona,"" and ""Autumn Sonata."" I don't insist that an artist always has to do something different with each new work, but Bergman already showed all these conflicts earlier, and really, how many unrelentingly cruel films do you need to watch before you start to wish there was something more?",3,As cold as ever; maybe that's the problem,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,4592,"['first', 'Saraband', 'be', 'sequel', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'named', 'Johan', 'Marianne', 'played', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'were', 'once', 'married', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'two', 'children', 'together', 'Then', 'got', 'divorced', 'are', 'still', 'drawn', 'other', 'years', 'later.However', 'lot', 'new', 'back-story', 'Johan', 'now', 'son', 'marriage', 'son', 'alienated', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'great', 'musical', 'talents', 'needless', 'say', 'father', 'son', 'grand-daughter', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'first', 'feels', 'unnecessary', 'weight', 'hung', 'story', 'Scenes', 'A', 'Marriage', 'had', 'enough', 'back-story', 'own', 'ultimately', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'suggested', 'Saraband', 'actually', 'not', 'same', 'people', 'protagonists', 'are', 'totally', 'different', 'divorced', 'couple', 'happen', 'also', 'be', 'named', 'Johan', 'Marianne', 'similar', 'how', 'Bergman', 'reused', 'names', 'Vogler', 'Vergerus', 'hisearlierfilms.What', 'next', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'always', 'Bergman', 'films', 'characters', 'engage', 'horrific', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'review', 'Persona', 'said', 'Bergman', 'films', 'are', 'people', 'elaborately', 'inflicting', 'emotional', 'suffering', 'other', 'rule', 'certainly', 'here', 'Johan', 'son', 'crudely', 'insults', 'conversation', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Marianne', 'cutely', 'twinkling', 'merrily', 'contempt', 'Johan', 'even', 'deeper', 'more', 'subtle', 'weaknesses', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'humiliated', 'moving', 'have', 'extensive', 'sex', 'life', 'divorced', 'even', 'was', 'already', 'beginning', 'wither', 'away', 'Many', 'times', 'film', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'came', 'see', 'Johan', 'now', 'feel', 'own', 'power', 'superiority', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'powerful', 'scene', 'involving', 'Johan', 'night', 'terrors', 'finally', 'pity', 'even', 'really', 'expression', 'victory', ""n't"", 'intend', 'take', 'back.The', 'other', 'major', 'conflict', 'Karin', 'father', 'father', 'basically', 'softer', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'version', 'well-meaning', 'stifling', 'parent', 'figure', 'Bergman', 'explored', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'just', 'film', 'music', 'nominal', 'reason', 'conflict', 'extreme', 'emotional', 'neediness', 'made', 'clear', 'nightmarish', 'kissing', 'scene', 'one', 'scene', 'Saraband', 'one', 'mind', 'one', 'daughter', 'ambiguously', 'relish', 'power', 'over', 'him.So', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'Bergman', 'might', 'have', 'lost', 'touch', '20', 'years', 'passed', 'Fanny', 'Alexander', 'Saraband', 'can', 'put', 'mind', 'ease', 'prime', 'here', 'cold', 'brutal', 'ever', 'Saraband', 'just', 'as', 'intense', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'very', 'strength', 'weakness', 'flawless', 'vicious', 'emotional', 'assault', 'master', 'feel', 'exactly', 'one', 'seventies', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'made', '1975', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'script', 'only', 'hint', 'was', 'actually', 'made', '2003', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Karin', 'contemporary-looking', 'tank', 'top', 'bra', 'underneath', 'oh', 'Ingmar', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'tank', 'top', 'seriously', 'only', 'sign', 'times', 'be', 'found', 'whole', 'film', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'place', 'film', 'place', 'remote', 'rural', 'region', 'are', 'traces', 'modern', 'technology', 'get', 'way', 'Bergman', 'trip', 'back', 'time.The', 'reason', 'why', 'Bergman', 'perfect', 'seventies', 'recreation', 'weakness', 'had', 'actually', 'begun', 'venture', 'emotional', 'range', 'Fanny', 'Alexander', 'latter', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'time', 'when', 'Bergman', 'ever', 'took', 'real', 'interest', 'something', 'other', 'senseless', 'cruelty', 'depicted', 'other', 'types', 'human', 'interaction', 'believable', 'way', 'Possibly', 'was', 'film', 'dealt', 'childhood', 'Bergman', 'felt', 'nostalgic', 'ever', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'case', 'was', 'sign', 'maybe', 'was', 'taking', 'steps', 'move', 'worldview', 'depicted', 'seventies.But', 'are', 'such', 'signs', 'Saraband', 'sense', 'film', 'step', 'backward', 'really', 'identical', 'tone', 'Scenes', 'A', 'Marriage', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'Persona', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'do', ""n't"", 'insist', 'artist', 'always', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'new', 'work', 'Bergman', 'already', 'showed', 'conflicts', 'earlier', 'really', 'how', 'many', 'unrelentingly', 'cruel', 'films', 'do', 'need', 'watch', 'start', 'wish', 'was', 'something', 'more']",Saraband

952109,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000BX0VUA,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 12]","In 2003 Swedish film legend Ingmar Bergman made his last film ever- although he's said that before, some two decades after his prior farewell to film with Fanny And Alexander. He should have never come back after that valedictory, for his effort, Saraband, a supposed sequel to his 1973 Swedish television smash Scenes From A Marriage, is a bad film- the worst I've yet to see from Bergman, and a bad film by any measure. His other `bad' films, Cries And Whispers and The Serpent's Egg, at least had some redeeming features, as the former was overall, a good solid film, while the latter showed some potential near the end. Saraband, by contrast, is an utter void, and takes all of Bergman's worst tendencies, shoves them all together in one film, recycles the worst parts of a half dozen other of his films, and the concoction is godawful, starting with the abysmal writing. I believe Ingmar Bergman, as a screenwriter, had a strong claim to being the greatest published writer of the 20th Century. Period. But, this work is bad, really bad, not only as a screenplay and a film, but most especially as a sequel to the great Scenes From A Marriage. And it starts with the bad writing.First off, before I delve into that, however, all the major critics are wrong about this film- in their qualitative assessment as well as its ties to Scenes From A Marriage. This is in no way shape nor form a sequel to that film because the two older lead characters, Johan and Marianne (Erland Josephson and Liv Ullman), while sharing superficial qualities in common with the earlier film's qualities, are clearly not the same characters, just as one has to posit that the characters in the tv miniseries version and the shorter film version of Scenes From A Marriage are different characters because they do not go through the exact same things, and key plot elements in one are not in the other. Think of them as parallel universes with slight differences. That contemporary critics miss the obvious in their arts reviews no longer astounds me, it only saddens me. There are too many key differences, however, to be overlooked. If that is so, then the two main characters in this film are even farther removed from the Scenes From A Marriage universe. Yes, they have the same first names, are a divorced couple, and had two daughters together, split up over Johan's similarly named lover- Paula, and work in similar professions to their younger doppelgangers, but all other similarities end there.... What made Scenes From A Marriage a great film was its writing, alone, and that Bergman never condescended. He let his viewers fill in the blanks they knew of from their own lives to background the scenes he showed within. In this film Bergman does not trust his audience, and condescends relentlessly. This is the sort of film that any producer worth their salt should have nixed, for it is an embarrassment to both them and to a great artist who is manifestly past his prime. Real greatness is knowing both what art to create and how, and what art to just leave in the bad idea pile. Bergman manifestly has lost that ability to discern, and this film's greatest flaw is, indeed, that it was ever made. It showcases all of his prior worst tendencies without a dram of his former redeeming greatness. It is forced, overwrought, trite, poorly written and acted, and just plain dull. Bergman leaves no melodramatic angles unused, and all to poor effect- death, suicide, insanity, incest; even Henrik's supposed life or death weighing on his abused daughter. Bergman has, like a child, finally ripped the zit off his face that was annoying him so long, and, with the pimple off, exposed a good deal of the red pulpy flesh beneath, and it ain't pretty!As for the DVD features, there are only a few trailers, a long making of featurette that, unfortunately, is not well structured nor insightful, and the DVD is not dubbed. It only is subtitled, albeit in crisp gold lettering. Saraband is an unfortunate end to one of the greatest careers in human arts, but worst of all shows the utter bankruptcy of most contemporary arts criticism, in that the critics too often excuse what an art lacks as if it has it in full, merely because of the artist's prior works or reputation. By allowing great artists' bad work a pass it sets up a precedent, so that the critic is not singled out for having shamed themselves by `attacking' a master, that tells lesser artists that they do not have to strive either, and thus the downward cycle starts, and society ends up with reams of rotting garbage as bad art, and no one willing to pinpoint the stench. Welcome to the 21st Century world of art, and be thankful last century's Ingmar Bergman never had to deal with it, lest many of his greatest works would have never been made!",1,Sad end for master,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,4796,"['2003', 'Swedish', 'film', 'legend', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'made', 'last', 'film', 'ever-', 'said', 'two', 'decades', 'prior', 'farewell', 'film', 'Fanny', 'Alexander', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'valedictory', 'effort', 'Saraband', 'supposed', 'sequel', '1973', 'Swedish', 'television', 'smash', 'Scenes', 'A', 'Marriage', 'bad', 'film-', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'Bergman', 'bad', 'film', 'measure', 'other', 'bad', 'films', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'Serpent', 'Egg', 'least', 'had', 'redeeming', 'features', 'former', 'was', 'overall', 'good', 'solid', 'film', 'latter', 'showed', 'potential', 'end', 'Saraband', 'contrast', 'utter', 'void', 'Bergman', 'worst', 'tendencies', 'together', 'one', 'film', 'worst', 'parts', 'half', 'dozen', 'other', 'films', 'concoction', 'godawful', 'starting', 'abysmal', 'writing', 'believe', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'screenwriter', 'had', 'strong', 'claim', 'being', 'greatest', 'published', 'writer', '20th', 'Century', 'Period', 'work', 'bad', 'really', 'bad', 'not', 'only', 'screenplay', 'film', 'most', 'especially', 'sequel', 'great', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'bad', 'writing.First', 'delve', 'however', 'major', 'critics', 'are', 'wrong', 'film-', 'qualitative', 'assessment', 'as', 'well', 'ties', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'sequel', 'film', 'two', 'older', 'lead', 'characters', 'Johan', 'Marianne', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'Liv', 'Ullman', 'sharing', 'superficial', 'qualities', 'common', 'earlier', 'film', 'qualities', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'same', 'characters', 'just', 'one', 'posit', 'characters', 'tv', 'miniseries', 'version', 'shorter', 'film', 'version', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'are', 'different', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'exact', 'same', 'things', 'key', 'plot', 'elements', 'one', 'are', 'not', 'other', 'Think', 'parallel', 'universes', 'slight', 'differences', 'contemporary', 'critics', 'miss', 'obvious', 'arts', 'no', 'longer', 'only', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'key', 'differences', 'however', 'be', 'overlooked', 'so', 'then', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'even', 'farther', 'removed', 'Scenes', 'A', 'Marriage', 'universe', 'Yes', 'have', 'same', 'first', 'names', 'are', 'divorced', 'couple', 'had', 'two', 'daughters', 'together', 'split', 'up', 'Johan', 'similarly', 'named', 'lover-', 'Paula', 'work', 'similar', 'professions', 'younger', 'doppelgangers', 'other', 'similarities', 'end', 'there', 'What', 'made', 'Scenes', 'A', 'Marriage', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'writing', 'alone', 'Bergman', 'never', 'condescended', 'let', 'viewers', 'fill', 'blanks', 'knew', 'own', 'lives', 'background', 'scenes', 'showed', 'film', 'Bergman', 'not', 'trust', 'audience', 'relentlessly', 'sort', 'film', 'producer', 'salt', 'should', 'have', 'nixed', 'embarrassment', 'great', 'artist', 'who', 'manifestly', 'prime', 'Real', 'greatness', 'knowing', 'what', 'art', 'create', 'how', 'what', 'art', 'just', 'leave', 'bad', 'idea', 'pile', 'Bergman', 'manifestly', 'lost', 'ability', 'discern', 'film', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'indeed', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'prior', 'worst', 'tendencies', 'dram', 'former', 'redeeming', 'greatness', 'forced', 'overwrought', 'trite', 'poorly', 'written', 'acted', 'just', 'plain', 'dull', 'Bergman', 'melodramatic', 'angles', 'unused', 'poor', 'effect-', 'death', 'suicide', 'insanity', 'incest', 'even', 'Henrik', 'supposed', 'life', 'death', 'weighing', 'abused', 'daughter', 'Bergman', 'child', 'finally', 'ripped', 'zit', 'face', 'was', 'annoying', 'so', 'long', 'pimple', 'exposed', 'good', 'deal', 'red', 'pulpy', 'flesh', 'beneath', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'trailers', 'long', 'making', 'featurette', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'well', 'structured', 'insightful', 'DVD', 'not', 'dubbed', 'only', 'subtitled', 'crisp', 'gold', 'lettering', 'Saraband', 'unfortunate', 'end', 'one', 'greatest', 'careers', 'human', 'arts', 'worst', 'utter', 'bankruptcy', 'most', 'contemporary', 'arts', 'criticism', 'critics', 'too', 'often', 'excuse', 'what', 'art', 'full', 'merely', 'artist', 'prior', 'works', 'reputation', 'allowing', 'great', 'artists', 'bad', 'work', 'pass', 'up', 'precedent', 'critic', 'not', 'singled', 'out', 'having', 'shamed', 'attacking', 'master', 'lesser', 'artists', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'strive', 'either', 'thus', 'downward', 'cycle', 'society', 'up', 'reams', 'rotting', 'garbage', 'bad', 'art', 'one', 'willing', 'pinpoint', 'stench', 'Welcome', '21st', 'Century', 'world', 'art', 'be', 'thankful', 'last', 'century', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'never', 'had', 'deal', 'lest', 'many', 'greatest', 'works', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made']",Saraband
952110,A2B6Q78Z6T3UNX,B000BX0VUA,Dean Monti,"[1, 1]","Saraband is really not a sequel, not in the traditional sense. It's perhaps more accurate to say the characters Johan and Marianne from Scenes From a Marriage play a large part in this new drama. It wasn't what I expected, but it turned out to be a wise choice, I think. Rather than simply revisit two characters from 30 years ago and see where they are now (which would have been interesting enough), Bergman chose to include and focus on the story of Henrik (Johan's son) and Henrik's wife and daughter. The story is fascinating, disturbing, thought-provoking; classic Bergman.Though Saraband probably won't be remembered as Bergman's finest achievement, it is certainly Bergman at his finest, and, whether intentionally or not, the film definitely echoes other Bergman classics.  The light coming in through the church windows in an empty church reminds of questions raised in Winter Light. The daughter wandering through the woods and into a stream reminds us of violations of The Virgin Spring. Likewise, inappropriate surrogate relationships (I'll put it that way for those who haven't seen the film) reminds us of issues raised in The Silence. And issues of love between parents (particularly fathers) and their children raised in Through a Glass Darkly and Wild Strawberries also appear here. Bergman does not provide us with answers any more than he did when he raised these questions some 40 years ago, but he can still make us think. So if Saraband is Bergman's last film, it's a very fitting exit.The documentary on the making of the film is, for me, no less emotionally moving than the film itself -- it touchs on Bergman's thoughts on making his last film, the death of his wife and his own mortality.",5,"familiar themes, classic Bergman",1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,1715,"['Saraband', 'really', 'not', 'sequel', 'not', 'traditional', 'sense', 'perhaps', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'characters', 'Johan', 'Marianne', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'new', 'drama', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'wise', 'choice', 'think', 'Rather', 'simply', 'revisit', 'two', 'characters', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'see', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Bergman', 'chose', 'include', 'focus', 'story', 'Henrik', 'Johan', 'son', 'Henrik', 'wife', 'daughter', 'story', 'fascinating', 'disturbing', 'thought-provoking', 'classic', 'Bergman.Though', 'Saraband', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'remembered', 'Bergman', 'finest', 'achievement', 'certainly', 'Bergman', 'finest', 'intentionally', 'not', 'film', 'definitely', 'other', 'Bergman', 'classics', 'light', 'coming', 'church', 'empty', 'church', 'reminds', 'questions', 'raised', 'Winter', 'Light', 'daughter', 'wandering', 'woods', 'stream', 'violations', 'Virgin', 'Spring', 'Likewise', 'inappropriate', 'surrogate', 'relationships', ""'ll"", 'put', 'way', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'issues', 'raised', 'Silence', 'issues', 'love', 'parents', 'particularly', 'fathers', 'children', 'raised', 'Glass', 'Darkly', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'also', 'appear', 'here', 'Bergman', 'not', 'provide', 'answers', 'more', 'did', 'when', 'raised', 'questions', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'think', 'So', 'Saraband', 'Bergman', 'last', 'film', 'very', 'fitting', 'exit.The', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'less', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'film', 'Bergman', 'thoughts', 'making', 'last', 'film', 'death', 'wife', 'own', 'mortality']",Saraband

When he asked why she came, she answered that she thought he had called for her. The story of Marianne and Johan in this film provides a background for another story which involved Johan's son from his first marriage, 61 year old musician Henric and his 19 year old daughter Karin whom Henric has been giving cello lessons and dreams of her becoming a famous performer. There is one more character present in the movie, even though she's been dead for two years - Anna, late Henric's wife and Karin's mother who has been deeply missed and mourned by everyone including Johan.This film is dedicated to Ingrid von Rosen, Bergman's last wife who died in 1995. It is her face we see at the photograph of Anna which Bergman shows over and over again. It seems to me that one of the reasons of making ""Saraband"" was for Bergman the chance to say to Ingrid, ""I love you and I miss you and even death can't take you from me"". In his last movie, Bergman sadly proves (once again) that even time can't heal the painful wounds caused by deeply-rooted hatred which is only one step away from love. How disturbing was the scene between 86 -year-old father and 61-year-old son. They looked the same age, old, grey-haired men who still cherish the hatred and contempt for each other that go way back and there is no victory in this power struggle. But there is hope in the movie for young Karin who breaks out of the world that she was forced to believe she belonged to but she did not and she found the strength to leave and to be free and to make her own decisions...As all Bergman's films, ""Saraband"" does not provide the easy answers to the difficult questions; it does not provide any answers at all but as old Johan in the most moving scene of the film bares his body, Bergman bares his very soul and lets us look inside of it and maybe learn something about ourselves.4.5/5",4,"""His Last Bow""",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2111,"['saraband', 'grave', 'courtly', 'Baroque', 'dance..', 'Marianne', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Johan', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'heroes', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', '1973', 'meet', 'again', 'thirty', 'years', 'when', 'Marianne', 'suddenly', 'visit', 'Johan', 'old', 'summer', 'house', 'When', 'asked', 'why', 'came', 'answered', 'thought', 'had', 'called', 'story', 'Marianne', 'Johan', 'film', 'background', 'story', 'involved', 'Johan', 'son', 'first', 'marriage', '61', 'year', 'old', 'musician', 'Henric', '19', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Karin', 'whom', 'Henric', 'been', 'giving', 'cello', 'lessons', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'famous', 'performer', 'one', 'more', 'character', 'present', 'movie', 'even', 'been', 'dead', 'two', 'years', 'Anna', 'late', 'Henric', 'wife', 'Karin', 'mother', 'who', 'been', 'deeply', 'missed', 'mourned', 'everyone', 'including', 'Johan.This', 'film', 'dedicated', 'Ingrid', 'von', 'Rosen', 'Bergman', 'last', 'wife', 'who', 'died', '1995', 'face', 'see', 'photograph', 'Anna', 'Bergman', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'reasons', 'making', 'Saraband', 'was', 'Bergman', 'chance', 'say', 'Ingrid', 'love', 'miss', 'even', 'death', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'last', 'movie', 'Bergman', 'sadly', 'once', 'again', 'even', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'heal', 'painful', 'wounds', 'caused', 'deeply-rooted', 'hatred', 'only', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'love', 'How', 'disturbing', 'was', 'scene', '86', '-year-old', 'father', '61-year-old', 'son', 'looked', 'same', 'age', 'old', 'grey-haired', 'men', 'who', 'still', 'cherish', 'hatred', 'contempt', 'other', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'victory', 'power', 'struggle', 'hope', 'movie', 'young', 'Karin', 'who', 'world', 'was', 'forced', 'believe', 'belonged', 'did', 'not', 'found', 'strength', 'leave', 'be', 'free', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'Bergman', 'films', 'Saraband', 'not', 'provide', 'easy', 'answers', 'difficult', 'questions', 'not', 'provide', 'answers', 'old', 'Johan', 'most', 'moving', 'scene', 'film', 'body', 'Bergman', 'very', 'soul', 'look', 'maybe', 'learn', 'something', 'ourselves.4.5/5']",Saraband
952112,A2A0U27BHHWOES,B000BX0VUA,G. Bestick,"[19, 19]","Bergman first introduced us to Johan and Marianne in his 1974 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage, one of the cinema's most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect.  Bergman and the splendid Scandanavian actors Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann took us through Johan and Marianne's marriage, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliation.  In the end, they live apart, but still make room for the bond between them.Three decades later, Bergman, Josephson and Ullmann have given us Saraband, a late-life gift.  Marianne decides that even though she hasn't seen Johan since the 1970s, it's time to make contact again.  Johan has inherited money from an aunt, and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake.  She literally wakes him with a kiss, but soon enough Marianne's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in Johan's family.Henrik, Johan's son, is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter Karin.  Both of them still mourn Anna, Henrik's wife and Karin's mother, who died two years before.  Henrik, a music teacher, is preparing Karin, an accomplished cellist, for her conservatory entrance exams.  The elderly Johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic (not unlike Bergman's own father) and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him.  Henrik wants his father's affection and acceptance, even though Johan refuses to give it, ostensibly due to some slight by Henrik when he was 19 years old.  In a painful scene, Henrik goes to Johan to ask for money to help Karin, and in his 61 year old face, we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father.For Karin, her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father.  Karin struggles to figure out what she owes Henrik, what she owes to the memory of her mother, and what she owes to herself.  She lets Marianne see some, but not all, of the turmoil she's going through.  For Marianne, her attraction to Johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him.  She's always wanted something from him, but since she can't define what it is, she'll probably never get it.The struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by Marianne's opening and closing monologues.  Karin makes her choices.  Henrik reacts.  Marianne throws herself once more against Johan's emotional aloofness.  As he's done throughout his brilliant career, Bergman brings it alive through artful dialog, perfect dramatic timing, and riveting cinematic composition.  The characters are not always likable, but they are never less than engrossing.The Criterion's DVD includes a mini-documentary of Bergman making Saraband.  We watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking, kid around with the crew, poke and prod his actors into position.  It's a treat to watch him work.  One wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from Julia Dufvenius, the fine young actress who plays Karin.  One also wonders why Bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he'd announced he was through.Bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection.  Apparently he wants to say one last thing about it, which seems to be this:  after all the tears and shouting, all the posturing and cruelty, all the reaching out and pulling back, this is what remains:  marriages of true minds (the photo of Anna used in the film is a picture of Bergman's great love, his deceased wife Ingrid); the fraught ties of fathers and sons; memories of old loves; what you give and get from children; and the devolution of the flesh.  None of it is easy, the master tells us, but all of it is necessary.  In the end, it's all you have.What's truly sad is that Bergman, sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey, claims that he's done.  He did for film what Shakespeare did for theater, took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving.  He will certainly be missed and he can't be replaced.But don't see Saraband for nostalgic reasons.  It's a moving, insightful film that deserves a place in the director's canon.

""Saraband"" was Bergman's last film, released in 2006. It's certainly not his best film, or even one of his best five films, and I'm certain he didn't intend it as such. It's not an ambitious or original film. Rather it seems to be a 'last dance' with the brilliant actors and actresses whose performances made Bergman the greatest Director per se of cinema history. Whatever resistance you may have toward Bergman's torturous pessimism, whatever your discomfort with his pace of observation and/or his disingenuous detachment, you will have to be astonished at the performances of Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson in ""Saraband"". They 'inhabit' their characters as richly as a goldfinch inhabits its feathers. Ensemble acting, and the direction of actors who knew each other thoroughly as an ensemble, was the core of Bergman's creativity. But ""Saraband"" also features a young actress -- Julia Dufvenius in the role of Josephson's granddaughter -- whose performance is also utterly Bergmanesque.

952114,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BX0VUA,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","For many years the films of Ingmar Bergman have haunted us, films that dare to enter territories untouched by others, peopled by actors of consummate skill, extended monologues both spoken and silent, and secret doors into the souls of some of the most fascinating characters created for the screen.  SARABAND is no exception: this theme and variations is written and performed and directed to perfection.  It leaves the viewer speechless.Marianne (Liv Ullmann) is a successful lawyer in her 60s who returns to her ex-husband's solitary retreat just for a visit.  Her ex-husband Johan (Erland Josephson), since remarried and redivorced, has a son Henrik (B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt) by another wife who lives nearby on the lake: Henrik is a musician and writer and lives with his daughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius), teaching her cello in preparation for an audition at the music conservatory.  What Marianne finds after thirty years absence is that Johan and Henrik are on bitter terms, that Karin is frustrated with her demanding teacher/father, and that the recurring 'saraband' movement of this story is the mutual adoration and mourning of Anna, Karin's mother and Henrik's deceased wife.  Marianne and Johan muse over their past lives, discovering that despite circumstances they still love each other.  Marianne is able to open the hearts of Karin, Johan, and Henrik and provide a tender voice that brings a degree of resolution to a family broken.As with all of Bergman's films it is not the story content as the method in telling that makes his films so indelibly and quietly passionate.  Everything is understated: solo sequences are played with Bach's solo cello suites, and when two or more characters interact the music becomes Brahms and Bruckner.  This is an elegant pastoral about looking into the mirror of our souls in old age and finding both the beauties and the missed opportunities of a life now passing toward the end.  Each of the four actors is splendid, though watching Liv Ullmann in her native tongue is a renaissance of memory of all the fine work this extraordinary actress has done.  Bergman gives us an elegy not a eulogy and one can only hope for more. Highly recommended on every level. In Swedish with English subtitles.

Sarabande resumes all an febrile existence, dedicated to explore and visit the most recondite corners of the human soul, fears, anguishes and frizzled emotions, amalgamated by the time, the far distances and the weight of the memory.The initial sequence in which we are in front of a table covered by pictures with Liv Ulman starring us reminds us the cinema is a collection of photographs in movement; a frozen lapse of time and preserved for the eyes of the future. In this sense it begins with similar approach respect ""Persona"" or Tarkovky' s ""The mirror.""A collection of frozen images that nevertheless make to Marianne to undertake a journey of more than two hundred miles to visit to her husband Johan, after thirty years without exchange impressions of any sort.Since this visit we will aware about a serene gaze around their lives, past and present blend one each other; she is a lawyer and he is writing a book. They had two daughters; he knows nothing about them and she is aware about a distant and random contact with Sra who lives in Australia and Martha, who is serious sick, since has missed in the dark shadows of the forgetfulness and the diffused labyrinths of her memory.But their lives will turn around the talented niece of Johan, who plays the cello with her father as musical preceptor. Hindemith's Sonata for cello Op. 125 will become the entrance for her to open her heart in the verge of the desperation and the infinite loneliness she is immersed. And so, Marianne who always had kept so isolated from her daughters finds herself trapped in the web of her own memories.

Anyone who recalls 1973's ""Scenes"" will be particularly moved by the reunion of Ullmann and Josephson. But the director is wise enough to include some fresh characters who help us better understand the ones we think we already know.

I don't know if the men are necessarily ciphers in this film, but they certainly have issues.  Saraband, of course, is the sequel to Scenes from a Marriage.  I didn't like the character of Johann then, and I like him even less now; he is a selfish, sadistic man who uses everyone and feels endlessly sorry for himself.  The other male character in the film is his elderly son, Henrik.  Johan has always been a bad father to Henrik and now, as a result, Henrik has turned into a monster.  The two of them live nearby so they can torture each other as Henrik grieves for his wife.Henrik lives in a cottage with his eighteen-year-old daughter, Karin.  In fact, the two of them sleep in the same bed.  They have a quasi-incestuous relationship - if not an actually incestuous one.The movie is composed of ten chapters, plus a prologue and an epilogue.  We take up with Marianne (Liv Ullman) as she is going over a table of pictures.  Speaking directly to the camera, she reflects on her life and her thoughts turn towards her ex-husband, whom she hasn't seen in thirty years.  She decides to pay him a visit.  As with many Bergman films, Saraband is a ghost story without a ghost.  Marianne arrives to a haunted house - doors open and close by themselves.  But it is not the house - it is the characters who are haunted.Bergman claims that this is his last work on film.  Thank goodness he had another great film left in him.

952119,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000BX0VUA,Kerry Walters,"[2, 2]","Bergman was a devoted admirer of Strindberg, and as a theatre director produced several of Strindberg's plays.  One of the best from Strindberg was ""Dance of Death,"" a two-part drama that explores the tangled webs of hatred and dependency that close relationships can breed.  I don't think it's too much to see ""Saraband,"" Bergman's final--and one of his best--film as a dance-of-death themed exploration.  It's also the case, of course, that a ""sarabande"" is a dance.  In the context of the film, the title also refers to a piece from Bach's 5th cello suite which one of the characters, Karin, plays.The four actors in ""Saraband""--Johan (Erland Josephson), Marianne (Liv Ullmann), Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), and Karin (Julia Dufvenius)--are caught in relationships which, although life-craving, are in fact life-destroying.  Karin, the daughter of Henrik, is a budding musician to whom the widowed and grieving Henrik poisonously clings (with just a hint of incest thrown in).  Henrik, a 60-year old failure, is the son of Johan, who treats him with an icy indifference that's absolutely chilling (at one point, Johan tells Henrik that so far as he's concerned, his son simply doesn't exist).  Johan and Marianne, the old couple first encountered in ""Scenes from a Marriage,"" are both alone in their old age, but cling rather desperately to one another in one of the film's final scenes, as though they know that the night is closing in.If there's any hope from the dance of death that they and we must perform, it's represented by Karin's resolution to break from her father, even with the bitter knowledge that their separation will destroy him, and the moment of recognition that Marianne's adult but schizophrenic daughter displays in the film's closing scene.  But these two moments of grace must be taken for what they are.  The first brings tragedy, the second is fleeting.This film, beautiful to watch and hear, acted with skill and directed by the 87-year old Bergman with a master's touch, is without doubt one of Bergman's very best.

952121,AJNHHUG6O8STR,B000BX0VUA,"Michael M. Stultz ""M.Hux""","[3, 4]","The problem with reviewing any Bergman title is that his work can only be assessed in light of his own oeuvre. That considered, I would venture that the very wise, and quietly disturbing Saraband, though admittedly not in the same league as Cries and Whispers, Persona, or The Passion of Anna, is a gift--to both the history of world cinema and those who love the monolithic artistry of Ingmar Bergman--that I would easily place alongside Autumn Sonata in stature.Visually, Saraband is gorgeous to look at, though I cannot deny missing Sven Nykvist's peerless cinematography. That the acting is superlative is no huge surprise of course. Ullman's performance is so subtle that it took a second viewing to begin to comprehend her intent. (And while I'm there: at least SIXTY cheers to a great and beautiful actress who has embraced with dignity the increasingly rare phenomena of aging naturally.) B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt is devastating, as he was in Fanny and Alexander. It's terrific Bergman gave him the opportunity to shine in a larger role here. Julia Dufvenius deserved a ""best supporting"" actress nomination and one can only hope that the multi-critic buzz that international stardom awaits her will become a reality. But I feel that it is Erland Josephson, overlooked in many of the reviews I've read, who shines the most brilliantly here. His Johan is a monster of Shakespearian proportion, oh-so-skillfully humanized without diluting the character's venom. Josephson's has always been a gargantuan talent, a voice that has not ""mellowed"" with age one iota.Saraband's unsettling and enigmatic resolution is but one of the many reasons that Bergman, reconsidered in this, his final film, remains the artistic genius he has always been--in this instance authenticated, once again, by his ability to capture, and then relate, the catharsis that life so often denies us.Oh, and concerning the special feature, The Making of Saraband....

952122,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BX0VUA,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""Saraband"" is a deeply personal film by veteran director Ingmar Bergman, inspired by the loss of his wife Ingrid. Marianne (Liv Ullmann) is suddenly moved to visit her first ex-husband Johan (Erland Jossefsen), a retired academic whom she has not seen in at least 30 years. She finds Johan at his summer house in the country, where his estranged son Henrik (B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt) and 19-year-old granddaughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius) are staying in the nearby lake cottage. Henrik is distraught over the death of his beloved wife Anna 2 years before and has transferred his possessive affection to Karin, a talented young cellist, whom he tutors in music and fears will strike out on her own. There is no limit to the venom between Henrik and Johan, a needy man who as a boy sought his father's love and the father whose distaste for the boy eventually turned to hatred. Marianne becomes a sympathetic ear for Karin and is immersed in this family drama.""Saraband"" is a series of conversations between these 4 people, isolated from the outside world by miles of countryside and by the strong emotions that bind them at the same time they corrode their relationships. Many of the conversations are essentially monologues, sometimes even spoken to the camera. The performances are expressed intensely, and I was particularly impressed with B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt's pathetic, cruel, mercurial characterization. But ""Saraband"" works better as a tortuous expression of Ingmar Bergman's grief than it does as a story, and the film is better understood on that level. Karin is too neurotic and melodramatic for a 19-year-old, until we remember that she embodies the  psyche of the very old, very neurotic director. Johan's bizarre attachment to his deceased daughter-in-law, whom he barely knew, doesn't make sense unless we consider that Johan is Bergman, just as Henrik is Bergman. The quasi-incestuous relationship between Henrik and Karin seems out of place in the story, but it works as metaphor. The memory of Anna pervades the film to an extent that is creepy. But Anna is there because Ingrid is always in Ingmar Bergman's thoughts.One thing I found interesting in ""Saraband"" was the conflicting views of the characters: Marianne always thought Johan was ""nice"", while Henrik finds him nasty and beneath contempt. Most of the world thinks Henrik obnoxious, domineering, and slightly crazy, but his wife thought him full of love. There is a valid point there. And the fact that the characters can no more change how they feel about one another than they could bring back the dead is accepted as fact, which I suppose is kind of refreshing. But what we have is a bunch of people who don't get along. And so what? They don't need to. Bergman manages to give every emotion a great deal of weight. Too much weight.  ""Saraband"" is an interesting bit of metaphor and may shed light on the nature of Berman's personal grief. But these characters just aren't credible in the real world. It doesn't work as a narrative. And I think it needs to, thus my 3-star rating.Note: Bergman should have been more careful with his numbers. Marianne is 63 and hasn't seen Johan in 30-32 years. They were married for 16 years, then saw each other again after Marianne divorced her 2nd husband. I'm sure that Bergman wanted to indicate that Marianne was a young woman when she married, but he probably didn't mean to say she was in junior high school. It's a careless error that Bergman would probably brush off as inconsequential, but numerically-minded members of the audience will pick up on it right away.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): The single bonus feature is a 44-minute film about ""The Making of Saraband"". It is primarily behind-the-scenes footage of Ingmar Bergman directing the actors, filming, and dealing with technical issues. It also includes some interview footage with Bergman, the cast, and the film's art director, costume designer, and prop master.

952123,ACIJVXJWC1SJO,B000BX0VUA,R. Geatz,"[2, 2]","For Bergman devotees like me, any morsel tossed our way by the great master is a treat. Saraband is a good deal more than a morsel, but not the true masterpiece others are claiming. And it takes some investment in Bergman's biography and past works to truly appreciate its depth, I think.As has been pointed out, the film is a tribute to Bergman's late wife, Ingrid (not the actress) and his mourning for her; the film is dedicated to her, and the photograph of ""Anna"" that is lingered on lovingly by the characters throughout the film is actually a portrait of Ingrid. (Bergman made a short film--never released in the US--called ""Karin's Face""--a tribute to his complicated relationship with his mother, where her photographic portrait is similarly examined by the film camera.)As with Fanny & Alexander, I was intrigued to see how Bergman quotes his past works and themes in this film.  The Bach saraband that haunts the soundtrack is the same piece of music he used in Cries and Whispers, when the two estranged sisters temporaily make contact in a montage of carressing hands and faces (Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin), silent except for the lone cello of Bach's saraband.Marianne's institutionalized daughter echoes that of Ingrid (the actress) Bergman's character's in Autumn Sonata. The concluding Scene 10 in Saraband is titled Vargtimme (translated as The Hour Before Dawn)which is also the Swedish title of Bergman's 1968 film ""Hour of the Wolf,"" which also begins and ends with Liv Ullmann speaking intimately to the camera (when she was pregnant with Bergman's daughter).As in The Passion of Anna and Cries and Whispers, a character's secrets are revealed in letters and diaries--things they could never say ""face to face.""It is a melancholy treat to see Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson together on screen again (much like seeing Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg reunited in Fellini's Intervista many decades later to watch their youthful selves in the famous Trevi Fountain scene in La Dolce Vita). I was reminded how much I've missed Ullmann's magnificent face, now wrinkled with age and experience, which has been absent from the movie screen for far too long.To me it's the film's themes of retrospection, regret, loss and becoming reconciled (or not) with one's past that touched me deeply, something the nearing-90 year-old Bergman is obviously engulfed by.There are other things that disturbed or at least distracted me in Saraband. I must say, as someone else pointed out here, I too was puzzled by the ""bad math"" of Johann and Marianne's history; their ages don't match up with their stated years married and apart. And maybe it's my American puritanical heritage raising its ugly head as I age, but do middle-aged men really sleep in the same bed with their adult daughters in Sweden? Yes, Dad sees Karin as a replacement for his lost wife, but such overt incestuous overtones are over-the-top and unnecessary.And I have never bought into Bergman's trite ""crippled child"" metaphor. Yes, we are all ""institutionalized"" in some way by our parents' actions or inactions, but doesn't he make that point without having to rely on such obvious symbols? Nevertheless, I was moved to tears in the epilogue when Marianne reveals that following her time with Johann and his family, she truly touched her instituionalized daughter [the crippled child metaphor] for the first time. It's Ullmann's performance that overcomes the contrivance.The other thing that makes this film outstanding is Bergman's continued reliance on close-ups--and his camera especially loves women's faces.  Even without his now-ailing cinematographer Sven Nykvist, Bergman tells as much about the human condition in close-ups of human faces than all the combined dialogue or contrived metaphors of his and others' films combined.One of the few bonuses in this DVD is a ""Making of..."" documentary.  It's intriguing to see how Bergman works with his actors and crew and we learn more about the film's conception in his discussions with them, especially in his recollection of a conversation he had with Erland Josphson that helped him cope with the loss of his wife.  And it's interesting, too, to see how Bergman has adapted to the digital age--quite different from the earlier ""Making of..."" docs of his creation of Fanny & Alexander and earlier movies where film was the medium. And I was suprised to see that most of the outdoor scenes were created in the studio--convincingly so.Overall, not Bergman's best, but well worth the investment and a fitting capstone to an amazing career.",4,Women's Faces,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4577,"['Bergman', 'devotees', 'morsel', 'tossed', 'way', 'great', 'master', 'treat', 'Saraband', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'morsel', 'not', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'others', 'are', 'claiming', 'investment', 'Bergman', 'biography', 'past', 'works', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'think.As', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'tribute', 'Bergman', 'late', 'wife', 'Ingrid', 'not', 'actress', 'mourning', 'film', 'dedicated', 'photograph', 'Anna', 'lingered', 'lovingly', 'characters', 'film', 'actually', 'portrait', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'made', 'short', 'film', 'never', 'released', 'US', 'called', 'Karin', 'Face', 'tribute', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'mother', 'where', 'photographic', 'portrait', 'similarly', 'examined', 'film', 'camera', 'Fanny', 'Alexander', 'was', 'intrigued', 'see', 'how', 'Bergman', 'past', 'works', 'themes', 'film', 'Bach', 'saraband', 'soundtrack', 'same', 'piece', 'music', 'used', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'when', 'two', 'estranged', 'sisters', 'temporaily', 'make', 'contact', 'montage', 'carressing', 'hands', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'silent', 'lone', 'cello', 'Bach', 'saraband.Marianne', 'institutionalized', 'daughter', 'echoes', 'Ingrid', 'actress', 'Bergman', 'character', 'Autumn', 'Sonata', 'concluding', 'Scene', '10', 'Saraband', 'titled', 'Vargtimme', 'translated', 'Hour', 'Dawn', 'also', 'Swedish', 'title', 'Bergman', '1968', 'film', 'Hour', 'Wolf', 'also', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'speaking', 'intimately', 'camera', 'when', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Bergman', 'daughter', '.As', 'Passion', 'Anna', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'character', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'letters', 'diaries', 'things', 'could', 'never', 'say', 'face', 'face', 'melancholy', 'treat', 'see', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'together', 'screen', 'again', 'much', 'seeing', 'Marcello', 'Mastroianni', 'Anita', 'Ekberg', 'reunited', 'Fellini', 'Intervista', 'many', 'decades', 'later', 'watch', 'youthful', 'selves', 'famous', 'Trevi', 'Fountain', 'scene', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'was', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'Ullmann', 'magnificent', 'face', 'now', 'wrinkled', 'age', 'experience', 'been', 'absent', 'movie', 'screen', 'far', 'too', 'long.To', 'film', 'themes', 'retrospection', 'regret', 'loss', 'becoming', 'reconciled', 'not', 'one', 'past', 'touched', 'deeply', 'something', 'nearing-90', 'year-old', 'Bergman', 'obviously', 'engulfed', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'disturbed', 'least', 'distracted', 'Saraband', 'must', 'say', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'here', 'too', 'was', 'puzzled', 'bad', 'math', 'Johann', 'Marianne', 'history', 'ages', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'stated', 'years', 'married', 'apart', 'maybe', 'American', 'puritanical', 'heritage', 'raising', 'ugly', 'head', 'age', 'do', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'really', 'sleep', 'same', 'bed', 'adult', 'daughters', 'Sweden', 'Yes', 'Dad', 'Karin', 'replacement', 'lost', 'wife', 'such', 'overt', 'incestuous', 'overtones', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'unnecessary.And', 'have', 'never', 'bought', 'Bergman', 'trite', 'crippled', 'child', 'metaphor', 'Yes', 'are', 'institutionalized', 'way', 'parents', 'actions', 'inactions', ""n't"", 'make', 'point', 'having', 'rely', 'such', 'obvious', 'symbols', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'epilogue', 'when', 'Marianne', 'following', 'time', 'Johann', 'family', 'truly', 'touched', 'instituionalized', 'daughter', '[', 'crippled', 'child', 'metaphor', ']', 'first', 'time', 'Ullmann', 'performance', 'contrivance.The', 'other', 'thing', 'film', 'outstanding', 'Bergman', 'continued', 'reliance', 'close-ups', 'camera', 'especially', 'women', 'Even', 'now-ailing', 'cinematographer', 'Sven', 'Nykvist', 'Bergman', 'as', 'much', 'human', 'condition', 'close-ups', 'human', 'combined', 'dialogue', 'contrived', 'metaphors', 'others', 'films', 'combined.One', 'few', 'bonuses', 'DVD', 'Making', 'documentary', 'intriguing', 'see', 'how', 'Bergman', 'actors', 'crew', 'learn', 'more', 'film', 'conception', 'discussions', 'especially', 'recollection', 'conversation', 'had', 'Erland', 'Josphson', 'helped', 'cope', 'loss', 'wife', 'interesting', 'too', 'see', 'how', 'Bergman', 'adapted', 'digital', 'age', 'quite', 'different', 'earlier', 'Making', 'docs', 'creation', 'Fanny', 'Alexander', 'earlier', 'movies', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'medium', 'was', 'suprised', 'see', 'most', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'were', 'created', 'studio', 'convincingly', 'so.Overall', 'not', 'Bergman', 'best', 'well', 'investment', 'fitting', 'capstone', 'amazing', 'career']",Saraband
952124,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000BX0VUA,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 6]","***1/2Legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman officially ""retired"" from filmmaking in 1982 following the release of his highly acclaimed autobiographical drama, ""Fanny and Alexander.""  That was supposed to have been his swan song, yet, since that time, he has made so many TV movies that have been released into theaters in the United States that, for Americans at least, it has pretty much been a ""retirement"" in name only.His latest such film to be released here, ""Saraband,"" is, technically, a sequel to his earlier masterwork, ""Scenes From a Marriage,"" which was also a made-for-TV work that received theatrical distribution in the United States in 1974.  ""Saraband"" reunites us with the now-divorced couple, Marianne and Johan, whom we are told have not really spoken to each other for almost thirty years.  For reasons that she is not even able to fully explain to herself, Marianne (Liv Ullman) feels compelled to visit her ex-husband (Erland Josephson) and find out how he's doing and, perhaps, figure out if there still might be something between them.  However, despite the fact that this new film is billed as an extension of the original ""Marriage,"" Johan and Marianne wind up somewhat on the periphery of the real story which involves the incestuous relationship between Henrik (Borie Ahlstedt), Johan's son from a previous marriage, and his beautiful 19-year old daughter, Karin (Julia Dufvenius).  Henrik is a classical musician whose beloved wife, Anna, has recently died.  In some strange way, he clings to Karin almost as a replacement for Anna - even though there are hints that the incest began before Anna's death and that indeed Anna was aware of it - making it clear to his daughter that he would be utterly destitute if she were ever to leave.This is obviously heady stuff for the viewer, but Bergman is, as always, so in control of his material that we are drawn into the conflict even though, initially, we may be repelled by what is taking place.  In addition to the struggle between father and daughter, there is also the intense hatred between Johan and Henrik - so intense, in fact, that Henrik even admits he would take great pleasure in seeing his father stricken with a horrible illness that would cause him a slow and agonizing death.  Caught in the middle of all this, as both observer and confidante, is Marianne, who can proffer only so much help and advice before she, too, risks becoming infected by the emotional disease that holds these people in its grip.  Yet, of all the characters, Marianne appears to be the most stable and hopeful in her dealings with life.  For instance, she can see the ugliness of much of Johan's way of interacting with people, yet she can still find a core of something worth loving buried deep inside the man.Even for a Bergman chamber drama with just four people in its cast, ""Saraband"" is a remarkably stark piece of cinema and, as such, it may be off-putting to those unfamiliar with the director's work.  The camera rarely moves outdoors, preferring instead to remain intensely focused on the characters who pour out at great length their darkest, deepest thoughts for us to muse over and examine.  His is a complex tale of people quietly torn asunder by unhealthy obsessions, morbid self-interest and an inability to reach out in love and forgiveness even in the darkest moments of one's life.  And as always with Bergman, the four performers transcend mere acting and literally become the characters on screen.The decades certainly haven't mellowed Bergman's mood when it comes to the contemplation of death or the meaninglessness of existence, so make sure you're in the right frame of mind before taking on this film.  But those who are true devotees of Bergman's work will certainly not want to miss ""Saraband.""",3,typically minimalist Bergman,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,3792,"['***1/2Legendary', 'Swedish', 'director', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'officially', 'retired', 'filmmaking', '1982', 'following', 'release', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'autobiographical', 'drama', 'Fanny', 'Alexander', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'swan', 'song', 'yet', 'time', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'TV', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'theaters', 'United', 'States', 'Americans', 'least', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'retirement', 'name', 'only.His', 'latest', 'such', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'here', 'Saraband', 'technically', 'sequel', 'earlier', 'masterwork', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'was', 'also', 'made-for-TV', 'work', 'received', 'theatrical', 'distribution', 'United', 'States', '1974', 'Saraband', 'now-divorced', 'couple', 'Marianne', 'Johan', 'whom', 'are', 'told', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'spoken', 'other', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'reasons', 'not', 'even', 'able', 'fully', 'explain', 'herself', 'Marianne', 'Liv', 'Ullman', 'compelled', 'visit', 'ex-husband', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'doing', 'perhaps', 'figure', 'out', 'still', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'However', 'fact', 'new', 'film', 'billed', 'extension', 'original', 'Marriage', 'Johan', 'Marianne', 'wind', 'up', 'somewhat', 'periphery', 'real', 'story', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'Henrik', 'Borie', 'Ahlstedt', 'Johan', 'son', 'previous', 'marriage', 'beautiful', '19-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Karin', 'Julia', 'Dufvenius', 'Henrik', 'classical', 'musician', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Anna', 'recently', 'died', 'strange', 'way', 'Karin', 'almost', 'replacement', 'Anna', 'even', 'are', 'hints', 'incest', 'began', 'Anna', 'death', 'indeed', 'Anna', 'was', 'aware', 'making', 'clear', 'daughter', 'would', 'be', 'utterly', 'destitute', 'were', 'ever', 'leave.This', 'obviously', 'heady', 'stuff', 'viewer', 'Bergman', 'always', 'so', 'control', 'material', 'are', 'drawn', 'conflict', 'even', 'initially', 'may', 'be', 'repelled', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'addition', 'struggle', 'father', 'daughter', 'also', 'intense', 'hatred', 'Johan', 'Henrik', 'so', 'intense', 'fact', 'Henrik', 'even', 'would', 'take', 'great', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'father', 'stricken', 'horrible', 'illness', 'would', 'cause', 'slow', 'agonizing', 'death', 'Caught', 'middle', 'observer', 'confidante', 'Marianne', 'who', 'can', 'proffer', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'help', 'advice', 'too', 'risks', 'becoming', 'infected', 'emotional', 'disease', 'people', 'grip', 'characters', 'Marianne', 'be', 'most', 'stable', 'hopeful', 'dealings', 'life', 'instance', 'can', 'see', 'ugliness', 'much', 'Johan', 'way', 'interacting', 'people', 'yet', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'core', 'something', 'worth', 'loving', 'buried', 'deep', 'man.Even', 'Bergman', 'chamber', 'drama', 'just', 'four', 'people', 'cast', 'Saraband', 'remarkably', 'stark', 'piece', 'cinema', 'such', 'may', 'be', 'off-putting', 'unfamiliar', 'director', 'work', 'camera', 'rarely', 'outdoors', 'preferring', 'instead', 'remain', 'intensely', 'focused', 'characters', 'who', 'pour', 'out', 'great', 'length', 'darkest', 'deepest', 'thoughts', 'muse', 'examine', 'complex', 'tale', 'people', 'quietly', 'torn', 'asunder', 'unhealthy', 'obsessions', 'morbid', 'self-interest', 'inability', 'reach', 'out', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments', 'one', 'life', 'always', 'Bergman', 'four', 'performers', 'transcend', 'mere', 'acting', 'literally', 'become', 'characters', 'screen.The', 'decades', 'certainly', 'have', ""n't"", 'mellowed', 'Bergman', 'mood', 'when', 'contemplation', 'death', 'meaninglessness', 'existence', 'so', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'taking', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'true', 'devotees', 'Bergman', 'work', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'Saraband']",Saraband
952125,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000BX0VUA,Timothy Kearney,"[1, 3]","Ingmar Bergman's SARABAND could be considered a sequel to SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE. In the film Bergman returns to familiar territory. Marianne and Johan, the main characters of the earlier film, meet after thirty years. Marianne is the one who initiates the contact, through we never know why, we realize somewhat quickly that she still loves Johan deeply, or at least a part of her does. Johan is irascible as ever through most of the film. We meet Henrick, Johan's son from a previous marriage and witness a father/son relationship that is at best, hate filled and spiteful. We see the troubling relationship that Henrick has with his daughter Karin, a musically gifted young woman. We are also unsure of the tension between Henrick and Johan, assuming at first it is stemmed from abandonment issues on the part of Henrick and a failure of Henrick to live up to Johan's expectations, but as the film progresses we come to see it may be far more twisted. Marianne seems to get stuck in the middle of the arguments much to the resentment of Henrick and Johan, but she becomes indispensable for Karin.Needless to say, the film is complex, and Bergman handles the complexities by allowing them to puzzle and challenge the viewer which may be why the film is so engaging. It's also superbly acted by Bergman favorites Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson reprising their roles as Marianne and Johan from SCENES. Borge Alhstedt who plays Henrick has likewise has been cast in other Bergman films. As with so many Bergman films, meticulous attention is played to small details such as the vacation home, the country church, even the selection of music. In one scene we find Johan listening to Bruckner's Ninth in full volume, the bombast of the piece matching his personality. And of course, there's a ""Bergmanesque"" gut wrenching scream releasing more existential angst than imaginable, this time from Karin.The film is sophisticated as opposed to sentimental, and if this is Bergman's last film, it may not be as lavish as some of his other works, but it does encapsulate much of what is great about Bergman. It's certainly a film that can be seen more than once and lead to lively discussions.",5,Love Marriage and Divorce Bergman Style Part II,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,2186,"['Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'SARABAND', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'sequel', 'SCENES', 'FROM', 'A', 'MARRIAGE', 'film', 'Bergman', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Marianne', 'Johan', 'main', 'characters', 'earlier', 'film', 'meet', 'thirty', 'years', 'Marianne', 'one', 'who', 'contact', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'realize', 'somewhat', 'quickly', 'still', 'Johan', 'deeply', 'least', 'part', 'Johan', 'irascible', 'ever', 'most', 'film', 'meet', 'Henrick', 'Johan', 'son', 'previous', 'marriage', 'witness', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'best', 'hate', 'filled', 'spiteful', 'see', 'troubling', 'relationship', 'Henrick', 'daughter', 'Karin', 'musically', 'gifted', 'young', 'woman', 'are', 'also', 'unsure', 'tension', 'Henrick', 'Johan', 'assuming', 'first', 'stemmed', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'part', 'Henrick', 'failure', 'Henrick', 'live', 'up', 'Johan', 'expectations', 'film', 'come', 'see', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'twisted', 'Marianne', 'get', 'stuck', 'middle', 'arguments', 'much', 'resentment', 'Henrick', 'Johan', 'indispensable', 'Karin.Needless', 'say', 'film', 'complex', 'Bergman', 'complexities', 'allowing', 'puzzle', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'engaging', 'also', 'superbly', 'acted', 'Bergman', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'reprising', 'roles', 'Marianne', 'Johan', 'SCENES', 'Borge', 'Alhstedt', 'who', 'Henrick', 'likewise', 'been', 'cast', 'other', 'Bergman', 'films', 'so', 'many', 'Bergman', 'films', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'played', 'small', 'details', 'such', 'vacation', 'home', 'country', 'church', 'even', 'selection', 'music', 'one', 'scene', 'find', 'Johan', 'listening', 'Bruckner', 'Ninth', 'full', 'volume', 'bombast', 'piece', 'matching', 'personality', 'course', 'Bergmanesque', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'scream', 'releasing', 'more', 'existential', 'angst', 'imaginable', 'time', 'Karin.The', 'film', 'sophisticated', 'opposed', 'sentimental', 'Bergman', 'last', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'lavish', 'other', 'works', 'encapsulate', 'much', 'what', 'great', 'Bergman', 'certainly', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'lead', 'lively', 'discussions']",Saraband
