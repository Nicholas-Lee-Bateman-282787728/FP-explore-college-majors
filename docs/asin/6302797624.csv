But the times, they-are-a-changin'. They ""grew-up"" and ended up caring only about themsleves and material gain(of coarse) which is what adulthood means to most Americans. They lived through the 60s, their youthful idealism and naivete, on into the 1980s to become yuppies and narcissists. The only truly decent character is already dead at the beginning of the film and his funeral is what brings these old friends together while at the same time being an obvious symbol that, in a way, what was best about them is now dead. This film stands along with a handful of other films as a particularly instructive document of the so-called baby boomer generation and American culture at the late end of the 20th century.",3,Generation of Swine,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,876,"['well', 'acted', 'film', 'great', 'portrait', 'sterotypical', '60s', 'generation', 'sell-outs', 'who', 'youth', 'were', 'little', 'bit', 'concerned', 'things', 'times', 'they-are-a-changin', 'grew-up', 'ended', 'up', 'caring', 'only', 'themsleves', 'material', 'gain', 'coarse', 'what', 'adulthood', 'most', 'Americans', 'lived', '60s', 'youthful', 'idealism', 'naivete', '1980s', 'become', 'yuppies', 'narcissists', 'only', 'truly', 'decent', 'character', 'already', 'dead', 'beginning', 'film', 'funeral', 'what', 'old', 'friends', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'obvious', 'symbol', 'way', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'now', 'dead', 'film', 'handful', 'other', 'films', 'particularly', 'instructive', 'document', 'so-called', 'baby', 'boomer', 'generation', 'American', 'culture', 'late', 'end', '20th', 'century']",N/A

335415,A2WN1QF8GSVHYV,6302797624,Altmed,"[7, 39]","The only thing I could relate to in this film was the loss of a 'friend' to a suicide and the music.I was expecting, as it says on the back cover, a movie that was ""funny and ferociously smart"" (quote from Richard Corliss, Time.)A small group of college friends of the deceased are brought back together, after a number of years of being out of college, by the suicide of a friend. I can say that the way the people acted was a bit weird, but then there is always an air of akward energy at any fuernal.They spend a week-end at a friends, and as they have gone on with their lives, and a story line starts to develop along the lines of ""why did our friend commit suicide?"" which unfortunately is never developed (nor are any of the other stories.)Although the the favorite music of someone who's passed is familiar (as this is custom to many people at funerals) and the Rolling Stones, ""Can't Always Get What You Want"" fits the entire movie (and what I was feeling about the movie, as I received it as a gift!), that is likely the most realistic part. The deceased prolly never got what he wanted or needed, nor did anyone else in the movie! Like I said, depressing!A grouping of great actors, a pretty good idea, but other than the music, the movie is simply depressing. How many people find a trip to a funeral (or the aftermath) 'fun' or 'funny?' (I do recall some movie that included a funeral, but this certainly wasn't it!)I'm sure for those who liked Motown music from the late 60's/early 70's, the soundtrack might be a good choice.There isn't much to say about the story, as there isn't much of a story. man takes his life, friends come to a funeral, and have a week-end together and they all seem pretty unhappy with their lives as well.While there is a need for coming-of-age ceremony is our society, and the movie (seemingly without the knowledge of the directors, writers or actors) seems to make that obvious, there really isn't much of a story at all... there IS a mish-mash of people thrown together by the funeral, and their reminising about their 'old times' (but that isn't really developed in the movie either!) and about being lost and unhappy themselves.The uncomfortableness of the situation surronding their getting together for the funeral is felt and is depressing, but then the story sprials out into the mish-mash, and this part of the story gets lost as well.A lot of good ideas thrown together, but none really developed.Yes, I cried, and it made me uncomfortable as I cringed with the actors/actresses as they were akward at the beginning at the funeral, but after that the stories that were being developed are lost, and you have to wonder what happened to them!?!There could have been about 3-4 great movies made with the ideas, and the ideas developed fully. Instead, this movie hacks them into bits, then putting together like making an awesome dinner, then deciding to add all the ingredients from all the parts of the dinner into one bowl and making a disappointing mess.I can totally see why this movie was turned down by so many studios (according to the director/writer in the additional features section) and why those people didn't 'get it.' I don't either, and I am from that generation, DID go to college , and DID experience not only one suicide, but several.Funny? I felt sad that the suicide parts were lost, along with every other story that starts in this movie (then disappears into oblivian.) I tried watching it again with a friend (from college mind you - thinking the suicide thing might be a little too close to home for me,as well as watching it during the holidays) and he thought it was depressing as well (and he didn't know the people I knew that had really committed suicide - I thought it was just me.)The part that is apparently supposed to get across that this guy (who you never see) who commits suicide did so as a result of his disappointment in himself is never developed (this idea was explained in the documentary, but the movie never gets it across), and why he actually did it, no one really seems to care, other than some idol curiosity - hardly what anyone really does in real life.The music and the cars are the best parts of the movie. Other than this, it's a total waste. I never heard about his movie when it came out, but then I was busy working and raising kids like most of us in this generation, in the early 1980's!If you like laughing at tragety in people's lives, and/or were an raging bully with nothing better to do and still carry that behavoir, I can see why you'd like it. (And PLEASE get some help!)If this movie serves any purpose at all, it reminds us of those people who were hurtful/abusive towards ourselves and others in a deep, lasting way. (perhaps another reason why I found it so depressing, as it was the very people like this that lead to a couple of the suicides of those I knew, and several attempted suicides of others.)If you like this movie, you might ask yourself why? What is it one likes & enjoys about watching personal pain and tragety of others? And you might go see a psychoanalist or psychiatrist, as you might just need some serious help, and may be hurting those around you without even realizing it.",1,"Good music, VERY depressing movie w/

That term and the term ""baby boomer"" both entered the American lexicon not long after this egregiously influential film came out in 1983.""The Big Chill"" was one of the first manifestations of the navel-gazing, self-absorbed, self-pitying subset of the ""baby boomer"" generation who around this time came to the horrific realization that they were beginning to age, that their lives had turned out to be much more cynical and materialistic than their '60s youthful idealism, blah blah blah, yada yada.  The manner in which this film and its characters treat the Meg Tilly character, who is not in ""their"" generation (and so is portrayed as a shallow nitwit), is a prime example of certain baby boomers' self-righteousness and self-aggrandizement.This film made me want to vomit when I saw it in 1983, and the mere idea of it makes me want to vomit today.  Still when I hear any of the classic songs which were desecrated by appearing on its soundtrack, I get cold chills down my spine at the memory of this crapfest.Those cold chills only last for a moment, but the societal problems and stagnation the selfishness of this subset of the ""boomers"" wrought for post-boomer generations -- McJobs, draconian student-loan repayment plans, ""safe sex"", the anti-aging industry -- these are forever.

335420,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302797624,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Friends; the real ones only come around once in a lifetime.  Sure, the general embodiment of the term `friend' comes in and out of our lives with reckless abandonment and makes their little dents in who we are, but true friends never leave us and are irreplaceable.  You'll know it when you meet that someone, or those someones.  You'll know it immediately because there is a close comfort that comes very rarely; a feeling of overwhelming ease that allows you to be yourself, more yourself then maybe you've ever been and thus it is those real friends that help you realize who it is that you really are.I'm lucky to have such a friend, and no doubt you have that person (or persons) as well.`The Big Chill' is a story about that kind of friendship, a friendship that survives all and continues to shape and mold us.  It's a story about realizing that we are nothing without that friendship, and that all that we have attempted to become becomes null and void without that friendship.The film begins under very somber pretences, with the passing of a dear friend; Alex.  Alex, who took his own life, left a tight-knit group of friends to ponder why it was that he left them.  Over the weekend these eight people lock themselves away in a house and rediscover themselves.  There is Sarah and Harold Cooper, the happily married couple (who own the house in which they are all staying); there is Sam Weber, the ashamed television actor; there is Michael Gold, the obnoxious journalist; there is Meg Jones, desperate for a child; there is Nick Carlton, out of touch with himself and those around him; there is Karen Bowens, the unhappily married mother and there is Chloe, Alex's girlfriend, stranger to the group.They all fight, they all break down, they all overreact and possibly underreact and basically all deal with the sudden situation as humans do; naturally and passionately.What makes `The Big Chill' so wonderful is that it feels so real, so raw and intelligent.  Each character is wonderfully fleshed out to reveal their honest and true emotions and the metamorphosis they make over the short weekend seems legit and understandable.  Sometimes being away from the ones who complete you for so long can make you become a variation of yourself that you are not comfortable with.  When you are reunited with those persons it doesn't take long to realize what has been missing and what needs to change.The script is magnificent, but it is the acting that elevates every scene.  Standouts are definitely William Hurt, Glenn Close and Kevin Kline; all three of which turning in some of their finest work.  This was a breakout film for a lot of these actors, proving to be a jump off point in their careers.  Hurt went on to do `Kiss of the Spider Woman' shortly after (winning an Oscar); Kline went on to do `A Fish Called Wanda' (winning the Oscar).  Close had a string of Oscar nominations in the late 80's (she was also nominated for this).  Meg Tilly received an Oscar nomination for her work in 85's `Agnes of God'; Berenger went on to be nominated for his stunning work in `Platoon'.  The entire cast used this as a solid foundation for their careers, and some of them (namely Close and Hurt) are still working solidly today.Couple the acting and the script with the impressive musical accompaniments and you have a film that feels complete and warming and understanding and moving.  It is a complete package, from start to finish, with never a dull moment and barely a thing to fault it over (I am not a Goldblum fan, and he annoyed me here, but there is always that one friend you can't stand so it fits well).",5,A wonderfully effecting film about the true meaning of friendship...,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,3621,"['Friends', 'real', 'ones', 'only', 'come', 'around', 'once', 'lifetime', 'Sure', 'general', 'embodiment', 'term', 'friend', 'lives', 'reckless', 'abandonment', 'little', 'dents', 'who', 'are', 'true', 'friends', 'never', 'leave', 'are', 'irreplaceable', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'meet', 'someone', 'someones', ""'ll"", 'know', 'immediately', 'close', 'comfort', 'very', 'rarely', 'feeling', 'overwhelming', 'ease', 'be', 'more', 'then', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'thus', 'real', 'friends', 'help', 'realize', 'who', 'really', 'are.I', ""'m"", 'lucky', 'have', 'such', 'friend', 'doubt', 'have', 'person', 'persons', 'well.', 'Big', 'Chill', 'story', 'kind', 'friendship', 'friendship', 'shape', 'mold', 'story', 'realizing', 'are', 'nothing', 'friendship', 'have', 'attempted', 'become', 'becomes', 'null', 'void', 'friendship.The', 'film', 'very', 'somber', 'pretences', 'passing', 'dear', 'friend', 'Alex', 'Alex', 'who', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'left', 'tight-knit', 'group', 'friends', 'ponder', 'why', 'was', 'left', 'weekend', 'eight', 'people', 'lock', 'away', 'house', 'rediscover', 'Sarah', 'Harold', 'Cooper', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'own', 'house', 'are', 'staying', 'Sam', 'Weber', 'ashamed', 'television', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Gold', 'obnoxious', 'journalist', 'Meg', 'Jones', 'desperate', 'child', 'Nick', 'Carlton', 'touch', 'Karen', 'Bowens', 'unhappily', 'married', 'mother', 'Chloe', 'Alex', 'girlfriend', 'stranger', 'group.They', 'fight', 'break', 'down', 'overreact', 'possibly', 'underreact', 'basically', 'deal', 'sudden', 'situation', 'humans', 'do', 'naturally', 'passionately.What', 'Big', 'Chill', 'so', 'wonderful', 'so', 'real', 'raw', 'intelligent', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'reveal', 'honest', 'true', 'emotions', 'metamorphosis', 'make', 'short', 'weekend', 'legit', 'understandable', 'Sometimes', 'being', 'away', 'ones', 'who', 'complete', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'make', 'become', 'variation', 'are', 'not', 'comfortable', 'When', 'are', 'reunited', 'persons', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'what', 'been', 'missing', 'what', 'change.The', 'script', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'scene', 'Standouts', 'are', 'definitely', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'three', 'turning', 'finest', 'work', 'was', 'breakout', 'film', 'lot', 'actors', 'proving', 'be', 'jump', 'off', 'point', 'careers', 'Hurt', 'went', 'do', 'Kiss', 'Spider', 'Woman', 'shortly', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Kline', 'went', 'do', 'Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Close', 'had', 'string', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'late', '80', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'work', '85', 'Agnes', 'God', 'Berenger', 'went', 'be', 'nominated', 'stunning', 'work', 'Platoon', 'entire', 'cast', 'used', 'solid', 'foundation', 'careers', 'namely', 'Close', 'Hurt', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'solidly', 'today.Couple', 'acting', 'script', 'impressive', 'musical', 'accompaniments', 'have', 'film', 'complete', 'warming', 'understanding', 'moving', 'complete', 'package', 'start', 'finish', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'barely', 'thing', 'fault', 'am', 'not', 'Goldblum', 'fan', 'annoyed', 'here', 'always', 'one', 'friend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'well']",N/A

I was dragged reluctantly to the TV by three lady friends as part of a video  night. What I had thought was going to be a &quot;Girl's&quot; movie turned  out to be one of my all time  favorites. I loved the story but the musical  score is also terrific. It has a selection of some of the best tunes from  the 60's throughout the film and they are interlaced with the film not just  used as background.I have seen some cynical reviews of &quot;The  Big Chill&quot; which try to prove it is deliberately schmaltzy. I don't  have a lot of faith in film critics at the best of times and least of all  on this occasion. Watching this film is a touching experience. You become  so wrapped up in the characters that you never want it to end. Oh and I  feel before I get into a description of the story that you should all know  that Alex, the dead guy, was played by Kevin Costner, before he became  famous. His part was then largely edited out of the film, to the point  where his face is never seen.The film starts at Alex's funeral.  We are introduced to Alex's friends from his college days. Then we move on  to the wake, held at the beautiful home of Sarah and Harold. It is a  bucolic palace by the edge of the Beaufort River. One of the first things  that we learn is that Alex committed suicide.  To make matters more  interesting, he did it in Harold and Sarah's bath tub and was survived by a  ditzy girlfriend, Chloe, played by Meg Tilly.As the movie  progresses we learn more about each of the group. Michael came primarily to  get investors for his new venture. Meg, played by Mary Kay Place, wants a  baby and she wants to conceive over this weekend. Sam has always had the  hots for Karen, played by JoBeth Williams, and she in turn is tired of her  marriage of convenience. Nick is a part time drug dealer who is trying to  deal with the loss of his balls in Vietnam. Sarah had an affair with the  dead Alex some years earlier. The only one who seems to have no skeletons  in the closet is Harold, who has become &quot;mister responsible&quot; but  without losing his caring side.So as you can see, there is plenty  to work with here.

Either way, the film is unforgettable for many reasons. For starters, I keep thinking that I will see Kevin Costner playing the deceased Alex. But he never appears. Then, when watching The Big Chill, I would hope for explanations as to why Alex committed suicide, but in the end, after getting no clear answers, I suppose that it doesn't really matter. What does is that the group got together to remind of each other what is most important in life. Surely, there is a WASPy taste to the group, but if the viewer can ignore that for a minute and focus on the chemistry, he can see what is so special about the film. None of the actors and actresses steals the film, but all have an equal share of contribution in shaping what the group is all about. Again, obviously, it's the music and the soundtracks that make The Big Chill a memorable picture to watch. I've seen it over five times already, and it gets better each time.

335432,A1REUG41YERWIF,6302797624,Brent Been,"[4, 7]","A satellite tv review recently had this synopsis for The Big Chill. It read:A group of friends reunite for a funeral, play records, drink, and talk. This is pretty much what unfolds in the film which is a lot like Return of the Seacaucus Seven that was made earlier(a fine film shot in 16 mm!) It is this cast that makes the film. I cannot imagine another group of actors who could pull this one off. I think that the Big Chill is one of those rare films that may not seem like much, but with the right cast and some fine writing it is superb on all levels. Some of the best scenes in the film involve the scenes where the group drinks, plays records, smokes pot(courtesy of William Hurt's character) and talks. I think it is easy to see why the flashback scenes were cut from the final print. By not seeing what Alex looked like, other than his forehead and stitched-up writsts in the casket, we are really able to visualize Alex better in the context of his surviving hippie cohorts. Some of the key dialouge involves the words of the minister during the opening funeral scene(""Where did Alex's hope go?""), and that is the theme which perpetuates through the context of this film. The musical score is wonderful and includes Three Dog Night, Marvin Gaye, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys to name a few, although I have yet to see a COMPLETE soundtrack album released yet! The cast is so great I have got to list them here.

Watching it again, more than 10 years later, I realize that the reason why I loved this film so much was because of the soundtrack (this was the film that instilled in me a love for ""classic"" rock and roll, especially The Rolling Stones, a love which still remains with me today). It was most certainly not for the plot or characters.The plot centres around a group of yuppies who gather for the funeral of a college friend and then spend the weekend reminiscing about ""the good old days"" (this plot was, in fact, borrowed from ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"", which was made three years earlier, but on a much lower budget). None of the characters in the film have a single redeeming feature and to put it bluntly, they are a group of narcissistic yuppies. Still, in a morbid kind of way, they are fascinating to watch. I don't identify with these people, I don't want to be like them, and yet, when they dance around the kitchen to old records, I find that I can't take my eyes off the screen.After the music, the next best thing about this film is the cast. Just about every actor in this film went on to bigger and better things (even Kevin Costner, who is the corpse that you see in the opening scene).Overall, the film is worth seeing, if only to say that you have seen what is often considered to be a minor classic, and after you've seen it, go out and buy the soundtrack.",4,Attack of the Yuppies,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1496,"['saw', 'Big', 'Chill', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'about', '16', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'favourite', 'movies', 'Watching', 'again', 'more', '10', 'years', 'later', 'realize', 'reason', 'why', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'film', 'instilled', 'love', 'classic', 'rock', 'roll', 'especially', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'love', 'still', 'today', 'was', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'plot', 'characters.The', 'plot', 'group', 'yuppies', 'who', 'gather', 'funeral', 'college', 'friend', 'then', 'spend', 'weekend', 'reminiscing', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'plot', 'was', 'fact', 'borrowed', 'Return', 'Secaucus', 'Seven', 'was', 'made', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'much', 'lower', 'budget', 'None', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'single', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'put', 'bluntly', 'are', 'group', 'narcissistic', 'yuppies', 'Still', 'morbid', 'kind', 'way', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'identify', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'yet', 'when', 'dance', 'kitchen', 'old', 'records', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'screen.After', 'music', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'cast', 'Just', 'actor', 'film', 'went', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'even', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'corpse', 'see', 'opening', 'scene', '.Overall', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'often', 'considered', 'be', 'minor', 'classic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'soundtrack']",N/A

The film written (with Barbara Benedek) and directed by Lawrence Kasdan has reached icon status: it is as quality a memoir of baby boomer post college life that remains as poignant today as when it was released twenty seven years ago.Brought together for the funeral of suicide victim Alex, eight friends gather for a weekend of remembering and reliving the times when they were all students - Alex being the most promising of them all - and wondering what drove their little hero to kill himself.  Each of the friends, through self produced play with a video camera. Through intimate conversations, and through the psychology of group 'therapy' explains where they are now in comparison to where they thought they would be.  The only member of the group who is 'new' is Chloe (Meg Tilly) who had been Alex's girlfriend.  The group - Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, and Jobeth Williams interact philosophically, over food making in the kitchen of the Close/Kline home, share frustrations and fulfill expectations in both friendship and physical interactions.  Surrounding this film is a selection of popular songs from their time that extend into the memories of the viewers.  It is a funny film. a tender film, a tour de force of acting by some very fine actors, and a memory trip that is wroth repeating with some frequency, like opening the old photo album.

But I did see some dilemmas portrayed in this movie that was revelant to my life and my peers'. I do think I'm entitled to some complaints, though. First of all, the biggest setback for me was that I was not able to feel, and believe the grief from the eight. This is a wonderful cast- William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, Jobeth Williams, Jeff Goldblum,etc- who all moved on to great things. I'm sure they must have at least the common sense and acting talent to really wring out a believeable amount of grief for their friend whom committed suicide. Although I was impressed with Glenn Close's performance, because she seemed to be the only one who truly grieved. The most intimate scene is her naked in the shower, crying her eyes out. I found that scene especially poignant because I could feel her sadness, and I lost that as the movie progressed. They seemed to forget about Alex as they whined about their lives. To me, Sarah(Close) was the only one who felt the loss, because she brought up Alex as they're sitting around the dinner table, and then pours her heart out. Then after that, it goes kind of haywire. But it was Close who sort of kept the movie together, like the stitches holding together Alex's wrist wounds during the opening credits.There  was another thing that moved me-Harold(Kline) agreeing to get Meg(Place) pregnant because her supposedly biological clock is ticking and she can't get a man to inseminate her. As she put it, &quot;These are my favorite men in the world&quot;, therefore narrowing the list down to Harold, Sam, and Michael (Nick's out of the picture because it seems like he recieved an 'owie' during 'Nam). So, in the end Harold's the lucky winner. Sarah cheerfully gives up her husband to Meg for one night. That really grabbed my attention because, who in the HELL would do a thing like that? There's way too much mess involved. That really stood out for me, because in a way it convinced me that these eight would do anything for each other. They share the same blood, thoughts, and running shoes.So, don't miss this, because the intimacy is worth tasting for one night.",4,Worth It.,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,2237,"[""'m"", 'bit', 'hesitant', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'am', 'only', '18', 'years', 'old', 'whole', 'different', 'generation', 'did', 'see', 'dilemmas', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'was', 'revelant', 'life', 'peers', 'do', 'think', ""'m"", 'entitled', 'complaints', 'though', 'First', 'all', 'biggest', 'setback', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'feel', 'believe', 'grief', 'eight', 'wonderful', 'cast-', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Jobeth', 'Williams', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'etc-', 'who', 'moved', 'great', 'things', ""'m"", 'sure', 'must', 'have', 'least', 'common', 'sense', 'acting', 'talent', 'really', 'wring', 'out', 'believeable', 'amount', 'grief', 'friend', 'whom', 'committed', 'suicide', 'was', 'impressed', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'performance', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'grieved', 'most', 'intimate', 'scene', 'naked', 'shower', 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'found', 'scene', 'especially', 'poignant', 'could', 'feel', 'sadness', 'lost', 'movie', 'progressed', 'seemed', 'forget', 'about', 'Alex', 'whined', 'lives', 'Sarah', 'Close', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'felt', 'loss', 'brought', 'up', 'Alex', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'dinner', 'table', 'then', 'pours', 'heart', 'out', 'Then', 'kind', 'haywire', 'was', 'Close', 'who', 'sort', 'kept', 'movie', 'together', 'stitches', 'holding', 'together', 'Alex', 'wrist', 'wounds', 'opening', 'credits.There', 'was', 'thing', 'moved', 'me-Harold', 'Kline', 'agreeing', 'get', 'Meg', 'Place', 'pregnant', 'supposedly', 'biological', 'clock', 'ticking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'man', 'inseminate', 'put', 'quot', 'are', 'favorite', 'men', 'world', 'quot', 'narrowing', 'list', 'Harold', 'Sam', 'Michael', 'Nick', 'out', 'picture', 'recieved', ""'owie"", ""'Nam"", 'So', 'end', 'Harold', 'lucky', 'winner', 'Sarah', 'cheerfully', 'up', 'husband', 'Meg', 'one', 'night', 'really', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'who', 'HELL', 'would', 'do', 'thing', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'mess', 'involved', 'really', 'out', 'way', 'convinced', 'eight', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'share', 'same', 'blood', 'thoughts', 'running', 'shoes.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'intimacy', 'worth', 'tasting', 'one', 'night']",N/A

I'm a Michigan alumnus who was in Ann Arbor during the years when these characters supposedly were. Let me be pleasantly firm about this:  Many of us never lost our youthful ideals or had to compromise our dreams of living lives devoted to peace, to social justice, to an egalitarian society.  None of my friends were, or are in our maturity, anything like Kasdan's characters. It's my strong feeling that his film depicts Michigan graduates unrealistically and demeans the glorious liberal education we were given in Ann Arbor.Here are a few facts for those who might differ.  First off, a small but telling point of error: ""Tell Him,"" by the Exciters, came out in 1962, a time when the film's characters were probably in the early years of high school.  Secondly, for Michigan women students of the mid-to-late 60s era, majoring in pre-law or pre-med was still quite rare. The influx of women into those professions didn't begin until years later. Third point:  At the time the film was released, my husband and I were living in academia with our four small children. Our friends from Ann Arbor days were at similar points in their lives.  We did not rue the idealism of our youth.  We lived it out.  We still do.Back then, we felt we could make a difference, and we have.

It was fun seeing all these actors and actresses when they were so much younger (almost 20 years ago) and in that sense the movie is sort of a nostalgic blast from the past kind of thing and had some interest for me just because of that.Unfortunately, the years haven't been kind to it, because the film seems dated now, although in a way I couldn't quite nail down.  The basic idea seems like a good one--a group of friends who came of age in the more freewheeling, carefree, and chaotic 60's have lost a close friend through suicide and are brought together at his funeral. In the ensuing 20 years, they've all settled into more or less conventional careers and lives (except for William Hurt, who is a drug dealer). When Alex, who was perhaps the most talented of them all, inexplicably commits suicide, they are left asking themselves those difficult and disturbing, and perhaps ultimately unanswerable questions about life, love, and friendship.The nostalgia aspect of the movie is enhanced by the soundtrack with all the oldie goldies from the 60's and 70's, which was fine, but although there is some occasional good acting here, most of the performances are unconvincing and seem curiously detached from each other and from the movie itself. I didn't even find their grief that convincing, which is what much of the movie is about. The first 45 minutes of the movie really drags, although things do pick up in the second half, and I'll grant that there are some much better and more convincing scenes there. The dialogue gets livelier and funnier, and there one or two very serious scenes where the group of friends tries to come to grips with the tragedy of their comrade's untimely and ultimately inscrutable demise--since he seems to have left no clues--not even a suicide note.Anyway, it's not a bad movie, and as I said, I did enjoy seeing some of my favorite actors/actresses as they were 20 years ago, but overall, I was expecting much more given everything that I'd heard about it over the years.",3,Not as good as I'd expected,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,2118,"['rented', '15th', 'anniversay', 'edition', 'movie', 'when', 'caught', 'eye', 'local', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'actors', 'actresses', 'when', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'younger', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'sense', 'movie', 'sort', 'nostalgic', 'blast', 'past', 'kind', 'thing', 'had', 'interest', 'just', 'that.Unfortunately', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'kind', 'film', 'dated', 'now', 'way', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'nail', 'down', 'basic', 'idea', 'good', 'one', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'came', 'age', 'more', 'freewheeling', 'carefree', 'chaotic', '60', 'have', 'lost', 'close', 'friend', 'suicide', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'funeral', 'ensuing', '20', 'years', ""'ve"", 'settled', 'more', 'less', 'conventional', 'careers', 'lives', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'drug', 'dealer', 'When', 'Alex', 'who', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'talented', 'inexplicably', 'commits', 'suicide', 'are', 'left', 'asking', 'difficult', 'disturbing', 'perhaps', 'ultimately', 'unanswerable', 'questions', 'life', 'love', 'friendship.The', 'nostalgia', 'aspect', 'movie', 'enhanced', 'soundtrack', 'oldie', 'goldies', '60', '70', 'was', 'fine', 'occasional', 'good', 'acting', 'here', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'seem', 'curiously', 'detached', 'other', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'grief', 'convincing', 'what', 'much', 'movie', 'about', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'really', 'things', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'second', 'half', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'there', 'dialogue', 'livelier', 'funnier', 'there', 'one', 'two', 'very', 'serious', 'scenes', 'where', 'group', 'friends', 'tries', 'come', 'grips', 'tragedy', 'comrade', 'untimely', 'ultimately', 'inscrutable', 'demise', 'have', 'left', 'clues', 'not', 'even', 'suicide', 'note.Anyway', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'actors/actresses', 'were', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'overall', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'more', 'given', 'everything', ""'d"", 'heard', 'years']",N/A

In fact, the soundtrack is so great that I ran out and bought it as soon as it hit the stores.  But very few movies get even better with age!  The Big Chill is one such movie.The story begins with a group of college friends reuniting to attend the funeral of one of their group who has committed suicide.  We never get to meet Alex (a part played by Kevin Costner that ended up on the cutting room floor), but we learn about him through his friends as they try to make sense of his death and their lives.  Each of them have secret yearnings that come to the forefront after this tragedy.  Alex's suicide causes each member of the group to examine their lives more closely.  Sam Weber is an actor, Who despite the fame and fortune still longs for the girl and the life he left behind.  Sarah and Harold Cooper, a happily married couple, struggling to deal with the fact that Alex committed suicide in their home, wondering what they could have done to prevent Alex's downward spiral.  Meg Jameson is a lawyer, who has begun to realize that she has put her career over everything else in her life.  Michael Goldman is a reporter for People Magazine, who begins to realize that what he has become is not even close to what he always wanted to be.  Karen Bowens is a housewife who got everything she thought she was supposed to want out of life, now realizing that she never truly wanted any of it.  Nick Williams is a cynical, unhappy man who wanders through life seeking to try every experience out there.  What he and his friends begin to realize is how closely Nick's life has begun to parallel that of Alex.The cast of this film features such greats as Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, William Hurt, and Jeff Goldblum, to name a few.  The storyline is strong, and one that we can relate to.  Who doesn't wonder if their lives have gone in different directions than we originally intended?  Who doesn't see the irony in choices we have made throughout our lives?  The camaraderie among the friends in this group is believeable and allows us to reminisce about the friends we had in high school and college.  The script is full of lines you just love to quote, such as what Michael says about wakes: ""Amazing tradition. They throw a great party for you on the one day they know you can't come.""  You find yourself laughing and crying along with the characters.  And the soundtrack - Tracks of My Tears, Ain't Too Proud To Beg, Whiter Shade of Pale, to name a few - will have you singing along with the movie!

The post-funeral activities range from philosophical meanderings to reefer smoking to carnal intercourse. The corpse's young girlfriend stays on throughout the weekend for additional comic relief.I could watch this one over and over, (and I do).

I had expected a lot of excessive stereo-typing of the druggies, hippies, and the protesters of my generation.  However, I actually saw a rather restrained series of characterizations.  Oh, the stereo-types were ever-present; the protesters who had ""sold out"" in various ways but I appreciated that they were not as overdone as I had thought they would be.The story takes place around a reunion of sorts.  In a very impressive opening sequence of scenes, we come to discover that the old gang comes together for the funeral of a friend.  It's been a few years since many have seen each other and this enables us to find out plenty as they update each other with their live's journey.  The ""selling out"" has to do with how each of them reached their level of success.  One married well, another became a TV star, another became a successful entepreneur, another a popular radio celebrity, another a respected scientist, etc. etc.  Actually, one of the shortcomings of this movie is how everyone became a success by societal standards.  There was a sense of guilt and loss of commitment that affected each person differently.  As I understood it, it was likely the reason for the deceased taking his own life.  As the different characters deal with these and other emotions over a long weekend, we begin to see some of ourselves in most, if not all, of them.  Life involves compromise and some found that easier to deal with than others.  In fact, the greatest cause for the compromising effects of maturity is almost completely missing from ""The Big Chill""; children.  There are occassional references to their kids but, in general, they are conveniently left out of the movie.  After all, the writer and director wanted to focus on other things and, of course, the kids would've just gotten in the way.Reunions are nice and the one in ""The Big Chill"" conveniently brought together everyone from the old gang (with the understandable exception of the deceased).  The ones I attend usually leave me wondering where all my old friends are which leaves me looking forward to getting back home to those that share my present.

335512,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6302797624,Robert Morris,"[61, 68]","Since this film first appeared about 20 years ago, it has become a favorite of those who comprise what is referred to as the ""Baby Boomer"" generation"" but its appeal is by no means limited to that age group. So many of its themes (e.g. nostalgia, disenchantment, sexual frustration, egocentricity) are common to all generations. As is often the case, a reunion of friends occurs because of a death, in this case Alex whose corpse is being formally dressed for burial as the film begins. (It is Kevin Costner's body but his head is concealed, with the balance of Costner's appearance lying on a cutting room floor.) Sarah and Harold Cooper (Glenn Close and Kevin Kline) serve as unofficial hostess and host. After the burial, their friends return with them to their home where accommodations are provided. Their extended celebration of both Alex and themselves begins, during which Kasdan (who also wrote the screenplay) carefully reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each central character. The Coopers seem to be the strongest, happily married and prosperous but also generous and caring. Nick (William Hurt) is a confused and self-absorbed veteran (in some respects a survivor) of the Viet Nam war. The group includes one celebrity, Sam (Tom Berenger) who stars in a television series. Karen has always been in love with Sam. Now a somewhat unhappily married woman, she struggles with her conflict of emotions (obligations to husband and children juxtaposed with her enduring attraction to Sam). Mary Kay Place is a successful attorney who yearns for parenthood but not necessarily marriage. For me, the most interesting character is Michael (Jeff Goldblum) who comes across as a smarmy, almost desperate social misfit. Although claiming to be secure as a journalist with People magazine, he is obviously desperate to be accepted, to make favorable impressions, and if nothing else, taken seriously. His vulnerabilities are almost palpable.Kasdan and his associates have created in this film an especially effective portrayal of certain values during the period in which the action (such as it is) occurs. For example, most of the characters are almost wholly preoccupied with what they want but do not have. There is a strong element of codependency among them as they struggle to absorb and digest the reality of Alex's death. They are mutually devoted but, at the same time, several seem (to me) to be asking the same question once posed by Peggy Lee: ""Is this all there is?""Much of the appeal of this film is explained by how seamlessly Kasdan coordinates the plot with the soundtrack which continues to be a bestseller. For example, it is an especially appropriate touch that he includes the Rolling Stones' &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; early on during the funeral service for Alex. Other selections on the soundtrack include ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" (Marvin Gaye), ""My Girl"" (The Tempations), ""Good Lovin'"" (Rascals), ""The Tracks Of My Tears"" (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles), ""Joy To The World"" (Three Dog Night), ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"" (Temptations), ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"" (Aretha Franklin), ""I Second That Emotion"" (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles), &quot;A Whiter Shade Of Pale"" (Procol Harum), and ""Tell Him"" (Exciters).",5,Boom Boom...Boo Hoo,1065657600,"10 9, 2003",2003,3289,"['film', 'first', 'appeared', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'become', 'favorite', 'who', 'comprise', 'what', 'referred', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'generation', 'appeal', 'means', 'limited', 'age', 'group', 'So', 'many', 'themes', 'e.g', 'nostalgia', 'disenchantment', 'sexual', 'frustration', 'egocentricity', 'are', 'common', 'generations', 'often', 'case', 'reunion', 'friends', 'occurs', 'death', 'case', 'Alex', 'corpse', 'being', 'formally', 'dressed', 'burial', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'body', 'head', 'concealed', 'balance', 'Costner', 'appearance', 'lying', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Sarah', 'Harold', 'Cooper', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'serve', 'unofficial', 'hostess', 'host', 'burial', 'friends', 'return', 'home', 'where', 'accommodations', 'are', 'provided', 'extended', 'celebration', 'Alex', 'Kasdan', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'carefully', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'central', 'character', 'Coopers', 'seem', 'be', 'strongest', 'happily', 'married', 'prosperous', 'also', 'generous', 'caring', 'Nick', 'William', 'Hurt', 'confused', 'self-absorbed', 'veteran', 'respects', 'survivor', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'group', 'one', 'celebrity', 'Sam', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'who', 'television', 'series', 'Karen', 'always', 'been', 'love', 'Sam', 'Now', 'somewhat', 'unhappily', 'married', 'woman', 'conflict', 'emotions', 'obligations', 'husband', 'children', 'juxtaposed', 'enduring', 'attraction', 'Sam', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'successful', 'attorney', 'who', 'parenthood', 'not', 'necessarily', 'marriage', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Michael', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'who', 'across', 'smarmy', 'almost', 'desperate', 'social', 'misfit', 'claiming', 'be', 'secure', 'journalist', 'People', 'magazine', 'obviously', 'desperate', 'be', 'accepted', 'make', 'favorable', 'impressions', 'nothing', 'else', 'taken', 'seriously', 'vulnerabilities', 'are', 'almost', 'palpable.Kasdan', 'associates', 'have', 'created', 'film', 'especially', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'certain', 'values', 'period', 'action', 'such', 'occurs', 'example', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'wholly', 'preoccupied', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'strong', 'element', 'codependency', 'struggle', 'absorb', 'digest', 'reality', 'Alex', 'death', 'are', 'mutually', 'devoted', 'same', 'time', 'several', 'seem', 'be', 'asking', 'same', 'question', 'once', 'posed', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'Much', 'appeal', 'film', 'explained', 'how', 'seamlessly', 'Kasdan', 'plot', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'bestseller', 'example', 'especially', 'appropriate', 'touch', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Always', 'Get', 'What', 'Want', 'quot', 'early', 'funeral', 'service', 'Alex', 'Other', 'selections', 'soundtrack', 'include', 'Heard', 'Grapevine', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Girl', 'Tempations', 'Good', 'Lovin', 'Rascals', 'Tracks', 'My', 'Tears', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'Miracles', 'Joy', 'World', 'Three', 'Dog', 'Night', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Too', 'Proud', 'Beg', 'Temptations', 'Make', 'Me', 'Feel', 'Natural', 'Woman', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'Second', 'Emotion', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'Miracles', 'quot', 'A', 'Whiter', 'Shade', 'Pale', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'Tell', 'Him', 'Exciters']",N/A

335515,A264UCDZZ6RLDN,6302797624,Russell de Ville,"[11, 15]","I saw The Big Chill for the first time only this year. It was playing on TNT or some such station and I was intrigued. I've since purchased the DVD and have enjoyed the film several times now. In my view, it deserves to be considered a minor cult classic.What I found was a collection of very good efforts by actors who were, at the time, not well known and fairly inexperienced. I'm quite impressed by Mr Kasdan's eye for casting. This is a superb ensemble! We find in this story a re-grouping of a previously tightly-bonded klatch with the usual variety of contrasting personalities and yet a melding of similar interests.Alex dies and thus the reason for the gathering. At the funeral (Chapter 2), Alex does not seem to have very many friends. Outside of a handful of family members, Alex' few former classmates and his youngish girlfriend, the church is empty. Even the minister didn't really know him.These friends end up staying with Sarah (Glenn Close) and her husband Harold (Kevin Kline) over the longish weekend. They spout off glib one-liners and exchange a somewhat forced repartee in multiple attempts to lighten their grief. How many of us have done the same thing in our own moments of despair?I was impressed by the frequent and liberal use of the word `love.' Several times by word and by gesture, these people affirm their deep commitment to each other. Several exchanges (some heated, some more Socratic) ensue that reflect both unresolved issues from a previous life and the current grieving process. The obvious attachments and subsequent fulfillment of sexual tensions seems to include a nod toward our collective Survival Instinct. It's at once ironic and terribly humorous that the person most openly interested in The Act (Jeff Goldblum as Michael) is left to play with the propeller on his junior aviator's bed.Moral considerations aside, I somehow did find satisfaction in Sarah's making arrangements (Chapters 25-27) for Harold to attempt to father Meg's (Mary Kay Place) child. Perhaps this was self-induced pay-back for former sins to a degree, but I also found it to be a selfless act on the behalf of a good friend - well, maybe two good friends. Harold didn't seem to mind.I suppose the popular front-runners in this movie could be Glenn Close and William Hurt. For my money, I'll take Mary Kay Place. She's solid and she wears comfortably into middle age (episodes of Law and Order, The West Wing and Numb3rs most recently).In writing book and film reviews for Amazon, I tend to do a little research. Including in that is a reading of at least a portion of the reviews previously posted. The Big Chill seems to have pulled in an inordinate number of reviews not only negative but often angry, and for a curious set of reasons: ""the sets are cheap, the acting is dated and the conversation shallow."" I don't agree.This is a ""Conversational Film,"" a true ""Talkie,"" a film where the substance of history and idea and thought is delivered much more so by verbal interactions among the characters than by elaborate sets or expensive action sequences. It's a Time Capsule depicting a narrow segment of Collegiate Society. It could have just as easily been a group of Pre-Nursing Students, or a Bible Study/Buddhist Meditation/Holocaust Studies Group or just some Kids interested in Agri-Business. Mr Kasdan chose some young Radical Anarchist Wantabes who decided that some attempt at conformation was necessary in order to get along in The Cold World. Not all are pleased about it. One or two tried to be more faithful to the Ideal than the others but it was a costly choice: one becoming an almost constant user of recreational pharmaceuticals and the other becoming dead.Neither am I bothered so much by the `missing flashback.' Mr Kasdan made an editorial decision with which I happen to agree. I find amusement in knowing that the exposed body parts (sans the face), whilst being prepared and included in the final version, belongs to Kevin Costner. It fits in with the black humor of it all, almost on the same level as someone auditioning for the part of Yorick in Hamlet.There is wonderful nostalgia in this film! Why should we expect such a work, 23 years old, to align with current thinking? Why should we expect it to reflect the impatient and shallow Gen-X World or some middle-aged shriveled prune-head (me included) who can't or simply won't make allowances for others. We should relax a little and view it and enjoy it within the context of its own Time.I for one would be delighted to see some of my college friends again; it's been 30-plus years. And if I should do so well as these guys, who so obviously love and care for each other, I'd consider it time and money and effort well spent.But most of us would have had to have been there, I suppose.Russell de Ville8 March 2006",3,Freezer Burn,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,4821,"['saw', 'Big', 'Chill', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'year', 'was', 'playing', 'TNT', 'such', 'station', 'was',

335522,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,6302797624,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[9, 13]","I can recall for years hearing about ""The Big Chill"".  That it was an amazing movie and the critical acclaim did nothing but support this honor.  Being a fan of cinema and a bit of a movie buff I finally decided last night to watch the movie.  The only thing I knew about the flick was it was an ensemble piece, had fine actors and actresses and all of Kevin Costner's scenes were deleted.  After I watched this movie I felt rather quizzical.  Not really sure what I had just watched for an hour and forty-five minutes.  I am sure I will be under fire for what I am about to say, but here goes nothing.The plot is simple, a bunch of college friends reunite after many years apart.  Which sounds nice, but the catalyst of this ""homecoming"" was the suicide of their mutual friend Alex (the deleted Kevin Costner).  All of these college friends, now adults spend the weekend together to catch up on old and new times.  Sounds interesting right? Not so much.These are some of the most one dimensional and superficial people I have ever seen in a movie.  In some ways this is a good and bad thing, good in the sense that the acting in this movie is actually pretty good.  It was bad in the sense that I had no real investment in anyone nor did I care what happened to these characters.Sam (Tom Berenger): Has become a famous TV star and plays a poor man's Magnum, P.I.; despite his fame he feels empty and not sure if he is ""making a difference with his life"".Harold (Kevin Kline): Married to Sarah and is hosting the weekend get together.  He is a rather successful sales man in the sneaker business. He likes his friends, but is somewhat put off that they are staying at his house.Sarah (Glenn Close): Married to Harold and had an affair with Alex years prior.  She also seems to have reservations about opening so many doors to the past.Michael (Jeff Goldblum): Is a famous journalist yet has desires to open a night club.  He acts like a real ""player"" but comes off as a dork who tells really bad jokes.Nick (William Hurt): Is an angry boy trapped in a man's body. He uses myriad controlled substance through out the film and ""can't get it up"". It seems he is pissed at Alex for committing suicide before he could.Chloe (Meg Tilly): She was Alex's girlfriend up to the day he died and never really offered any insight about Alex's current state of affairs.  She spends a great deal of time stretching and doing yoga via putting her legs over her head. Her best quality is to act rather vapid.Karen (JoBeth Williams): She purposely married a man who is the polar opposite of her father and is miserable. However, her husband is rich so it is all good, right? Wrong she is totally smitten with Sam and is chasing him the entire film...Meg (Mary Kay Place): Hasn't had much luck with men, in her late 30s she is still single and wants to have a child.  She has a plan to have one of the men at the weekend party get her pregnant.  The way this story line plays out is really CREEPY!!!As for their relationship with the estranged Alex, no one ever really spoke about how his death influenced them.  It would be addressed and then dropped.  The character of Alex was nothing more than a plot device, which is fine, but to keep bringing up ""how they felt"" and not concentrate on it made the entire notion seem rather shop worn and dull.On to the weekend itself all of these people spent together.  I am not sure about anyone else who watched this movie, but this seemed like the longest weekend in the world.  The last time I checked, there was only two days in the weekend.  This super weekend leaves the door open to the issues of sex, politics, philosophy, idealism and the meaning of life.  Again some spicy stuff, yet the execution, rather the writing was very lackluster and slow moving.  So here is the equation, poor writing plus unsympathetic characters equals ""I don't care"".The movie only had a middle, no real beginning and no real end.  I am cool with that, because that is what life is in many ways.  This movie nailed that on the head.  However, the middle was just empty.  I began to question who had really committed suicide. As for the soundtrack, yeah there were some good tunes and most of them were played at very odd times.  For instance, everyone drives to the graveyard to bury their friend and jovial tunes of 1960s cascade in the background.  Huh?I honestly believe that this movie was a sign of the times and a period piece.  I was six years old when this movie was released.  Perhaps if I were 30 something when this was came out I might have loved it.  Notwithstanding, technology in modern times has made keeping in touch much easier.  Ultimately the acting is good but had its determents and the location shots in Beaufort, South Carolina were really pretty.  Nevertheless, ""The Big Chill"" certainly has myriad meanings: The world being a cold place and warmth is with friends, everybody is just hanging out, death of a loved one is a wake up call, the

335525,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,6302797624,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 9]","I have wanted to see this movie since it came out in 1981 when I was first becoming interested in 60s radicalism (I was 10 at the time) and now I really wish that I had seen it then and got that particular mania out of my system.Despite great acting by actors that had yet to be established (ironically Kevin Kline's future wife, Phoebe Cates, would be in Fast Times at Ridgement High - that other movie with a cast of well known actors that the casting director somehow managed to find before they were famous) the overall script is just a tedious mess of characters acting badly. They are either guilty about selling out or they are trying to live the pissed off radical stereotype (one that wears very thin after your 20th birthday) and Meg Tilly is just there to say some of the funniest strange lines (it's like she was auditioning for the part of River on Firefly 20 years too early). I won't deny that it's cool seeing Jeff Goldblum playing creepy and Kevin Kline fighting it otu with Jeff Daniels, but the storyline feels dated.Last, the special features are pretty weak. The trailer is badly done. The ""making of"" featurette has Lawrence Kasdan saying the exact same things he says on the liner notes. And the extra scenes don't even show the Kevin Costner scenes that they filmed and edited out (which is a shame since everyone goes on about how his character was the bright spot and the center of the group, but we never get the sense that he's anything but a corpse. Of course, halfway through the movie I started to wish that Kasdan would have just done a movie abotu the Costner character with his friends as minor players - but then again when Kasdan and Costner did team up they produced the painfully dull Wyatt Earp.)So this is an OK movie, but it's not great. It doesn't deserve the respect it gets. I'm sure there are better movies abotu college friends reuniting and/or The 60s. There have to be.

335529,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,6302797624,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[24, 28]","Quite often, I come to read Amazon reviews & someone has already written what's in my mind about the subject at hand, and therefore, I feel no need to leave my remarks. I expected that to be the case with this film, given it's age, the overall impact it's had on society, and also the frequency with which it's shown on cable TV to this day. I was surprised to find out, after reading said reviews, that no one had articulated my thoughts, or seemed to quite capture in words what I've gleened from multiple watchings of this movie over the years. I came here to say what I've gotten from the film over the years, and hope to inspire someone who has never seen this great piece of art to watch it- no matter what their age might be. The music is perfectly chosen, the story easy to get into & follow, the scenes are logical & realistic. A top-notch cast & thoughtful dialogue makes this movie continue to stand out as the years pass by, and owning this DVD was a foregone conclusion to me. In my opinion, the scenes which were cut- including the ones with Kevin Costner- were omitted for good reason. They ultimately serve no purpose to the plot, don't add any needed detail to the movie, and in fact would've taken away from the great pace of the film. So kudos to the editing team here, for actually dismissing scenes that should've been removed- which is NOT something that can be said of many a movie!I first saw this film as a teenager, and I loved it instantly. I could relate even then to the sense that it's amongst one's chosen friends & not usually the family one is born into that you feel most at home. I could understand even then, if not entirely comprehend, the characters' general sense of unease about their modern lives. I, perhaps a tad sadly, can now grasp their nostalgia fully about the liberal & idealistic past they shared, contrasted against their now-materialistic present. I could see how easy it is to lose oneself, and slowly watch relationships we once held so dear evaporate, in the mire of the after-college-is-over swampland. But, don't be deceived, this isn't just a shallow movie about selfish people having beautiful material things, though most of the characters are well-off. And as one of them says so succintly, ""No one ever had a cushier berth than us..."" Maybe that aspect puts off some viewers, to see the characters living in relative wealth & yet still able to find things to complain or feel empty about in their lives. But the universal truth that money doesn't buy happiness (or security, or lasting love, or real friendship) is nowhere more touchingly shown than in this film, in my opinion. Repeated viewings only confirm this for me as I've aged myself, gotten a bigger salary & had many beautiful material possessions come into my own life. This isn't a film to be watched only with the eyes of envy, cynicism or negativity. One must still have an open mind & a little bit of an open heart. Each time I see it again I get some new life lesson out of it or relate to something fresh that I didn't pick up on before. There's not many films I can honestly say that about.The synopsis of the film has been well-discussed by other reviewers in terms of plot, so I will not re-hash that. What I'd prefer to focus on are the characters, who are the real reason why one should seek out this film. This could have easily become a trivial plot-driven film, in the hands of a less capable cast & crew. However, it remains doggedly character-driven, so much so that you're left feeling (in under two hours) like you've known these people your entire life. There is a warmth, realism, flawed beauty & timelessness that this movie continues to convey to me.Sarah, played by Glenn Close, is an embodiment of the woman many of us females long to be- a good mother, well-to-do financially, successful and competent in her work as a doctor, happily married to a wonderful man named Harold (played by Kevin Kline), possesses seemingly endless energy. Sarah plays the role of ""the good girl"" as she was born and bred to do, though occasionally frustrated with the demands of society to play that part, yet maintains an almost-complete alignment with the life she's chosen. JoBeth Williams portrays Karen, a deeply-dissatisfied homemaker, wife and mother who seems to have it all on the outside. Her marriage to Richard (played by a former ""Ironside"" co-star, Don Galloway), which was entered into due to a host of deep insecurities on her part, is woefully inadequate to her. She is somewhat spoiled, very attractive, has a serious seductive streak and is a bit self-centered. Nonetheless, she is no sociopath- just an unhappy person who never really found her own voice in life, despite having what appears to be an ideal existence. The role of Chloe (Meg Tilly) has been called a ditzy girl by many a reviewer- and on the surface, perhaps that's accurate enough. However, I think she is simply not a woman who is one to wear her heart on her sleeve, as her few remarks and thoughtful glances along the way actually show a depth and maturity unheard of in a truly dumb person. Simply because she is young, that doesn't mean her character is a throwaway, though repeated viewings are what showed me these subtleties. My personal favorite of all the cast (male or female) is Mary Kay Place's Meg, an atheist who believes that she wants to be a mother more than anything else in life, but is completely exhausted by swimming in the limited dating pool available to her. Her humor and pragmatism is most enjoyable to me. Place portrays her character with a sense of real-world weariness which can only found by those who have been a single working woman putting up with nonsense, for more time than anyone should have to.Harold, the kind and handsome Everyman of the film, is the archetypal ""good guy"", played to absolute perfection by Kline. He embodies strength, fortitude, stability and graciousness. Out of all the characters here, it is he who grieves the most for his deceased friend, Alex. Nick (William Hurt) is Karen's ex-boyfriend, perpetually hiding from planting any real roots in the world, a man who seems to feel everything too deeply- and thus, as a defense mechanism, reverts to pretending he feels nothing at all. He is somewhat mired in the world of drugs, temporary self-satisfaction, and a restlessness that his fellow Big Chillers seem to have long ago shrugged off. I found Nick to be the most relatable of all the males within the group. Perhaps this is because he's the one person unwilling to make excuses for his own personal BS, as the others are apt to do. Michael is the ""opportunist"" of the group, the one that is notoriously known as unlikable to many audiences, played to the hilt by the intelligent Jeff Goldblum. His bracingly-cold rationalizations about his big-city motivations and ambitions, while screaming that he's of the ""Me Decade"" in spades, are actually quite refreshing. Besides Nick, he is perhaps the most unflinchingly accepting of who he really is, without putting on a sweet veneer for the benefit of others. Rounding out the cast is a slim, mustached Tom Berenger, and here he's playing a ruggedly-handsome actor named Sam who's made it big in Hollywood. Divorced, with a young daughter that he rarely sees, he is as attracted to Nick's old flame Karen as she is to him (which would be A LOT). He wonders if he is doing anything of real meaning with his life, despite the success, glory and fame that's come to him. Sam also questions his own depth often, a thought that seems to reverberate with each character, almost as if the ghost of Alex himself is whispering the same question in each of their ears: ""What, of any worth, have you REALLY done in your life? I think that perhaps you've accomplished absolutely nothing...So don't kid yourself about how great you are.""In the end, there are no real answers to anyone's questions- the group's simply relegated to enjoying each other with the time that they have left on earth. As in real life, no one can find out a certain answer as to why we're here, or if what we're really doing matters that much. And the conclusion you come to is that all one can do is be the best version of yourself that you can, leave the rest to fate, and hope that it all works out in the end. This is a film to enjoy for the pure pleasure of seeing really great actors, and ones that excel as team players in a film which requires just that, performing a story which holds a mirror up to each of us in it's own way. Don't look to find out the meaning of existence in it's dialogue or plot line. In keeping that realistic expectation, I think you'll find this movie alternately cathartic, funny and moving.",5,"Reflections on this film, from a non-baby boomer",1325462400,"01 2,
