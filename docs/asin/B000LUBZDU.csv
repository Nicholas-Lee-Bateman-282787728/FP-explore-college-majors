While these were remarkably firm, the film is unbearably flat.Dressing his project out in 1940's hard-boiled detective genre, first-time American director Marc Rosenbush attempts with minimal set and plot to play both high camp and high philosophy. Neither really work.  Ostensibly a murder mystery, the film is not so much about murder as it is life, not about who did it, but what it all means.  To get to the big scene, though, you'll have to sit through an hour of trite jokes, a string of non-sequiturs to test the patience of even seasoned practitioners.  ""Where were you at the time of the murder?"" the detective asks.  ""What do you mean by time?"" the monk rejoins.  To the wizened master the detective pleads, ""Help me still my mind.""  Zen students know what line comes next - ""Ok, give me your mind.""The acting isn't bad, and the music seems fairly interesting, though nothing you'd seek out on CD.  But even if you're interested in Zen or Buddhism, about the only reason to watch Zen Noir is much the same reason I had.  I was too tired to read a book, too tired to meditate, not yet ready for bed, and had nothing else to watch.#",2,Time better spent meditating,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,1285,"['have', 'interest', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'unlikely', ""'ll"", 'find', 'anything', 'exceptional', 'Zen', 'Noir', 'perhaps', 'Debra', 'Miller', 'boobs', 'were', 'remarkably', 'firm', 'film', 'unbearably', 'flat.Dressing', 'project', '1940', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'genre', 'first-time', 'American', 'director', 'Marc', 'Rosenbush', 'minimal', 'set', 'plot', 'play', 'high', 'camp', 'high', 'philosophy', 'really', 'work', 'Ostensibly', 'murder', 'mystery', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'murder', 'life', 'not', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'get', 'big', 'scene', 'though', ""'ll"", 'have', 'sit', 'hour', 'trite', 'jokes', 'string', 'non-sequiturs', 'test', 'patience', 'even', 'seasoned', 'practitioners', 'Where', 'were', 'time', 'murder', 'detective', 'asks', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'time', 'monk', 'wizened', 'master', 'detective', 'pleads', 'Help', 'still', 'mind', 'Zen', 'students', 'know', 'what', 'line', 'next', 'Ok', 'give', 'mind', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'music', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'seek', 'out', 'CD', 'even', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'Zen', 'Noir', 'much', 'same', 'reason', 'had', 'was', 'too', 'tired', 'read', 'book', 'too', 'tired', 'meditate', 'not', 'yet', 'ready', 'bed', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch.']",Zen Noir

I didn't think it was all that interesting or all that funny.It's about a guy (kind of a Humphrey Bogart tough guy type) in an undershirt and hat.  He is an investigator and goes off to this Buddhist temple/meditation complex to find out why this Buddhist Monk died.  On the idea that someone murdered him, he begins to question the inhabitants of the temple.  They answer in Zen-type answers which is kinda funny but not all that funny.  He falls for a bald lady Buddhist while he's there, but it's OK. He is pretty bald under the hat.  You even get to see him butt-naked. (I could have passed on that.) He even takes his hat off.Actually, I was glad he took his clothes off, to air them out.  I think he wore the same clothes for the whole time he was there investigating.  I got the impression he was there for at least a week.In the end, he winds up learning the peaceful flow of Zen-living and more Zen stuff.Ehhh.

Its message is a meditation on the complexion of death as part of life, successfully generating the idea of death as life's beginning. The idea itself rebukes post-modern culture, and the film works hard to engage that. But a disappointing script, and editing which strives for supra noir effect, leaves the impression of a film without real justification except artfulness. Not a bad cause, but one to be considered before purchase. Still, a film 'about' Zen is bound to be captivating especially for Zennists, and perhaps western Buddhists in general. I enjoyed it, but have difficulty recommending it for most viewers even though most of us need the message desperately. The film is darkly hilarious, and yet shallow given the prospects raised by the title's idea. Rosenbush takes an intriguing run with it. How well he fares is a question up for grabs, decided by one's interest in things fanciful and yet strangely intimate. The film's artifice is its magic, and it's often winning, but never transforming.

On the other hand, my wife and son just stared at the screen in complete boredom.  I know this movie is a koan, 2 weeks later I am still trying to figure it out.  A koan cannot be figured out with logic, so be prepared to feel confused (koans are supposed to confuse you) about how loved ones die and leave us heart broken, people in general just die, people  commit suicide, and how all of us are slowly dying.

A koan is a story or question that seems nonsensical or paradoxical, but which makes sense if the student is able to shake off his/her normal assumptions about how the universe works and who the student is within that context.

1040659,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000LUBZDU,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[5, 5]","Very interesting movie where the inquisitive detective gets to investigate the death of the Buddhist monk.  In his attempt to get suspect's statement, story or feedback, he starts discovering himself.  His seemingly routine questions seem to have a much deeper meaning with temple's occupants.  Nothing makes sense, until one day during simple tea ceremony it all starts to connect like pieces of the puzzle.  The meaning of life, death and everything in between no longer seems to be a mystery any more.  The act of complete acceptance and surrender is absolutely fantastic.  But be ready to endure the verbal back and forth for a long time, before director lets you ""get it"".  This film is funny and sad, it is serious and silly, it is sexy and ordinary at the same time.  It seems that it's simplicity is the beauty of what director had to say to his audience.  By the same token, I believe that this is intellectual movie and as such not aimed at large audiences.
