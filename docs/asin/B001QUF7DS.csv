1232167,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001QUF7DS,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","While it certainly has flaws, there is something so raw and beautiful about `Not Easily Broken' that I can't seem to shake.  Maybe it's the naturalness with which the actors fall effortlessly into their roles.  Maybe it's the relatable feeling I get when watching this marriage break and re-set.  Maybe it's the fact that `Not Easily Broken' avoids being `easy' and just tells it like it is.The story is that of a young married couple (well, middle aged I guess) who are starting to crack.  Dave, once with large dreams of playing professional baseball, now coaches little leaguers after a severe injury crushed his goals.  His wife, Clarice, has become the family's primary breadwinner, growing her real estate dreams into something substantial.  The couple is constantly at each others throats due to diverting goals.  Dave, having separated himself from the life he once wanted to live, now wants a simpler life, one with children.  Clarice is still very much into her own needs, wanting to build her career and travel without the heavy weight of `family' dragging her down.  The couple has drifted apart, mentally and physically.  Still, their problems seem minor when compared to some of their friends (who happen to be lodged in a messy divorce) and so it seem manageable.  When Clarice is injured in a car accident, things come to a head in their marriage.  Clarice's bossy and overbearing mother comes to live with the couple, and her two-cents start to wage war between Clarice and Dave, especially when Dave begins to seek emotional comfort in the arms of another woman.You will never doubt that Dave and Clarice will work through things, but getting their will be a rocky and at times heartbreakingly realistic road.As far as faults go, there are a few.  I had a similar issue with Woody Allen's `Husbands and Wives'.  For some reason, these films tend to be slightly biased.  I mean, who isn't going to side with Dave here.  I think that the film should have made it a little more even, or at least peppered in a few faults.  And one cannot say that Dave forming feelings for Julie was a fault because, well, his wife and her mother would have driven ANY man to seek comfort elsewhere, and I'm telling you think from experience.  But, I will also say, from experience, that no story is that one sided.  Everyone has faults that contribute to the downfall of a marriage.  So, it's minor in this state (because this film, unlike Allen's, isn't trying to make a broad statement on the dynamics of marriage) but it's worth noting.  I also found the way the film wrapped things up to be a bit of a sell out (when it happens you will know what I mean), it just felt so Hollywood, especially when this film appropriately avoided `going there' for the most part.  I hated the narration (unnecessary) and I thought that the film (at times) felt like a Made for TV Tyler Perry Movie, which made me cringe a bit, but thankfully the film managed to reign in that overly preachy dynamic that Perry lustfully lathers over every frame of his overpraised films.The acting, especially on the parts of Morris Chestnut and the BRILLIANT Taraji P. Henson, is great.  Even Jenifer Lewis (who is really nothing more than a clich&eacute; here) is exceptionally `raw'.  I loved Kevin Hart (hilarious, even when delivering the preachy lines of dialog) and I thought that Maeve Quinlan understood how to temper her performance so as to seem real and approachable as aposed to staged and `manufactured' (as most `other women' in these films can come across).In the end I recommend this movie.  Like I said, it has flaws, but overall this movie really delivers a powerful punch that cannot be ignored.  Marriage is a very controversial subject, but it is one that deserves to be tackled without fear.  For the most part, `Not Easily Broken' manages to do that.",4,Not easily forgotten...,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,3844,"['certainly', 'flaws', 'something', 'so', 'raw', 'beautiful', 'Not', 'Easily', 'Broken', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'shake', 'Maybe', 'naturalness', 'actors', 'fall', 'effortlessly', 'roles', 'Maybe', 'relatable', 'feeling', 'get', 'when', 'watching', 'marriage', 'break', 're-set', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'Not', 'Easily', 'Broken', 'avoids', 'being', 'easy', 'just', 'tells', 'is.The', 'story', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'well', 'middle', 'aged', 'guess', 'who', 'are', 'starting', 'crack', 'Dave', 'once', 'large', 'dreams', 'playing', 'professional', 'baseball', 'now', 'little', 'leaguers', 'severe', 'injury', 'crushed', 'goals', 'wife', 'Clarice', 'become', 'family', 'primary', 'breadwinner', 'growing', 'real', 'estate', 'dreams', 'something', 'substantial', 'couple', 'constantly', 'others', 'throats', 'due', 'diverting', 'goals', 'Dave', 'having', 'separated', 'life', 'once', 'wanted', 'live', 'now', 'simpler', 'life', 'one', 'children', 'Clarice', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'needs', 'wanting', 'build', 'career', 'travel', 'heavy', 'weight', 'family', 'dragging', 'down', 'couple', 'drifted', 'apart', 'mentally', 'physically', 'Still', 'problems', 'seem', 'minor', 'when', 'compared', 'friends', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'lodged', 'messy', 'divorce', 'seem', 'manageable', 'When', 'Clarice', 'injured', 'car', 'accident', 'things', 'come', 'head', 'marriage', 'Clarice', 'bossy', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'live', 'couple', 'two-cents', 'start', 'wage', 'war', 'Clarice', 'Dave', 'especially', 'when', 'Dave', 'seek', 'emotional', 'comfort', 'arms', 'woman.You', 'will', 'never', 'doubt', 'Dave', 'Clarice', 'will', 'work', 'things', 'getting', 'will', 'be', 'rocky', 'times', 'heartbreakingly', 'realistic', 'road.As', 'far', 'faults', 'go', 'are', 'few', 'had', 'similar', 'issue', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Husbands', 'Wives', 'reason', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'slightly', 'biased', 'mean', 'who', ""n't"", 'going', 'side', 'Dave', 'here', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'even', 'least', 'peppered', 'few', 'faults', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'Dave', 'forming', 'feelings', 'Julie', 'was', 'fault', 'well', 'wife', 'mother', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'ANY', 'man', 'seek', 'comfort', 'elsewhere', ""'m"", 'telling', 'think', 'experience', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'experience', 'story', 'one', 'sided', 'Everyone', 'faults', 'contribute', 'downfall', 'marriage', 'So', 'minor', 'state', 'film', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'trying', 'make', 'broad', 'statement', 'dynamics', 'marriage', 'worth', 'noting', 'also', 'found', 'way', 'film', 'wrapped', 'things', 'up', 'be', 'bit', 'sell', 'out', 'when', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'just', 'felt', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'appropriately', 'avoided', 'going', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'hated', 'narration', 'unnecessary', 'thought', 'film', 'times', 'felt', 'Made', 'TV', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Movie', 'made', 'cringe', 'bit', 'thankfully', 'film', 'managed', 'reign', 'overly', 'preachy', 'dynamic', 'Perry', 'lustfully', 'frame', 'overpraised', 'films.The', 'acting', 'especially', 'parts', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'BRILLIANT', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'great', 'Even', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'who', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'exceptionally', 'raw', 'loved', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'hilarious', 'even', 'when', 'delivering', 'preachy', 'lines', 'dialog', 'thought', 'Maeve', 'Quinlan', 'understood', 'how', 'temper', 'performance', 'so', 'seem', 'real', 'approachable', 'aposed', 'staged', 'manufactured', 'most', 'other', 'women', 'films', 'can', 'come', '.In', 'end', 'recommend', 'movie', 'said', 'flaws', 'overall', 'movie', 'really', 'powerful', 'punch', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'Marriage', 'very', 'controversial', 'subject', 'one', 'be', 'tackled', 'fear', 'most', 'part', 'Not', 'Easily', 'Broken', 'manages', 'do']",Not Easily Broken

The actual accident only occupies the first 25 minutes of film.After that the plot switches to being about the relationship stuggles between the husband and the wife, and particularly the nurse who originally takes care of the wife after the car accident.  She ends up playing a bigger role later on because of a VERY shocking turn of events (which I won't spoil).  Not to mention the wifes mother who moves in after her daughters accident and becomes one of the more important characters.There's also a subtle message of hope and not ever giving up through even the worst of times, and it's done in such a way that it's not overbearing or unnatural.

This is one of Jenifer Lewis best roles as the overbearing mother. Taraji was very annoying in this role and I felt for Morris because he had to deal with her smart mouth. It is hard for men to deal with the fact that their wives earn more money than they do. This can cause problems in a marriage. This is a Christian film. There are positive messages based on the Bible in the film but it doesn't seem preachy. I recommend this film for fans of romantic comedies. If you love Mr. Chestnut and Mrs. Henson you have to see this film. The only negative point was that Morris had on a ridiculous wig in the beginning of the film.

Jakes previous novel Women Thou Art Loosed was adapted into animpressive film, five years and his follow up film Not Easily Broken isjust as good. Directed by the underrated Bill Duke whose previous work includes Hoodlum and Deep Cover, Not Easily Broken tells the story of a couple (Morris Chestnut & Taraji P. Henson) whose marriage is crisis.After a car accident, injurers Henson's character things only get worseand their marriage but more importantly their faith is tested. I watchedthe film with my wife. It was a treat to discuss the film with her onthe way out of the theater to our car. And during the ride home we cameto understand a little more about each other. The acting considering the religious material is first rate, Morris Chestnut displays the sameleading man charm he always does and fresh off her Oscar Worthy turn in Benjamin Button, Henson does wonders. Jenifer Lewis steals every sceneshe's in as the mother-in-law, and Kevin Hart provides tons of comicrelief as a life long friend to Chestnut's character. Not Easily Brokenis the kind of film that most critics will tear apart. It could be therelack of familiarity for most critics when it comes to the gospel genre.Take for example the similar marriage in crisis themed film Revolutionary Road which is currently in release and stars Kate Winslet& Leonardo Dicarpo. Winslet just won a Golden Globe for her role in Road, while critics roasted Henson's performance in Not Easily Broken.While Winslet's character differs slightly from Henson's in Not Easily Broken both give performances that any women single or married canrelate to.

1232180,A150HXN1PBL3C9,B001QUF7DS,"Edward S. Brown ""Charisma Expert""","[1, 1]","""Not Easily Broken"" is an excellent case study on modern day romances and marriages.  Morris Chesnutt (Dave) and Taraji  P. Henson (Clarice) give a poignant portrayal of  the power struggle often waged  between husband and wife in an individualistic society.  There have been movies in the past that attempted to put a comic twist on the challenges of relationships like:  Albert Brooks', ""Modern Romance"" (1981) and Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in ""The War of The Roses"" (1989).  The difference between the dramatic ""Not Easily Broken"" and romantic movies of the past is that the plot hinged on the breakdown of the relationship.  The relationships ran its course and both parties attempted to get out without getting their pocketbooks and heartstrings bruised too much.  But, ""Not Easily Broken"" is different in that it demonstrates the transformation of modern men and women.  Actually, it represents more the breakdown in people more so than the relationship. ""Not Easily Broken"" begs the question;""Do men and women have any real need for each other anymore?"" It sounds ludicrous to ask such a question.  But, to look at the dynamics in contemporary relationships of changing gender roles, advanced equitability in financial resources between the sexes and a myriad of self-serving motives  might not be ludicrous after all.  The movie attempts to develop a redeeming value of hope, but fails pragmatically in its quest, because realistically the challenges are too deep-seated.  For the relationship to actually work, the parties have to devolve into a time that has long past.  Granted, the past came with a high degree of challenges and disempowerment as well.  But, men and women seem to want and need each other despite the impediments.I highly recommend this movie for the penetrating analysis of contemporary love.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute[...]",4,A Case Study on Modern Romance & Marriage!,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,1885,"['Not', 'Easily', 'Broken', 'excellent', 'case', 'study', 'modern', 'day', 'romances', 'marriages', 'Morris', 'Chesnutt', 'Dave', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'Clarice', 'give', 'poignant', 'portrayal', 'power', 'struggle', 'often', 'waged', 'husband', 'wife', 'individualistic', 'society', 'have', 'been', 'movies', 'past', 'attempted', 'put', 'comic', 'twist', 'challenges', 'relationships', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Modern', 'Romance', '1981', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'War', 'Roses', '1989', 'difference', 'dramatic', 'Not', 'Easily', 'Broken', 'romantic', 'movies', 'past', 'plot', 'hinged', 'breakdown', 'relationship', 'relationships', 'ran', 'course', 'parties', 'attempted', 'get', 'out', 'getting', 'pocketbooks', 'heartstrings', 'bruised', 'too', 'much', 'Not', 'Easily', 'Broken', 'different', 'transformation', 'modern', 'men', 'women', 'Actually', 'more', 'breakdown', 'people', 'more', 'so', 'relationship', 'Not', 'Easily', 'Broken', 'question', 'Do', 'men', 'women', 'have', 'real', 'need', 'other', 'anymore', 'ludicrous', 'ask', 'question', 'look', 'dynamics', 'contemporary', 'relationships', 'changing', 'gender', 'roles', 'advanced', 'equitability', 'financial', 'resources', 'sexes', 'myriad', 'self-serving', 'motives', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'ludicrous', 'movie', 'develop', 'redeeming', 'value', 'hope', 'pragmatically', 'quest', 'realistically', 'challenges', 'are', 'too', 'deep-seated', 'relationship', 'actually', 'work', 'parties', 'have', 'devolve', 'time', 'long', 'past', 'Granted', 'past', 'came', 'high', 'degree', 'challenges', 'disempowerment', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'women', 'seem', 'want', 'need', 'other', 'impediments.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'penetrating', 'analysis', 'contemporary', 'love.Edward', 'BrownCore', 'Edge', 'Image', 'Charisma', 'Institute', '[', ']']",Not Easily Broken

Other than the minister, I had a hard time telling any of these cursing characters from one in any other movie.As a writer I know I tend to over critique some stories...and this is one of them.

1232182,A1CHM200OEN65X,B001QUF7DS,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[35, 36]","As a fan of Taraji P. Henson (""Hustle & Flow,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""), I was curious to see what she would bring to her role as a wife dealing with a struggling marriage. My own involvement in ""Fireproof,"" as the one who wrote the novel based on the screenplay, gave me appreciation for this important subject, and yet I'd heard little about this film. My expectations for the overall story were low.What a nice surprise! Without being crass or gratuitous, the script allows these characters to portray real problems in believable ways. Soon after the rosy opening, in which they tie the knot with the bishop's wise words barely sinking in, they find their marriage crumbling beneath financial pressures, different goals, and a drought of physical intimacy. Dave wants a child, while Clarice is career-minded and wanting to build a comfortable lifestyle--even if it means ""faking it till you make it."" Dave compensates by coaching Little League, an activity that Clarice fails to understand and which allows the mother-in-law to push her way into the home.With things already rocky, a tragic accident leaves Clarice in physical therapy and feeling bitter. Her therapist, an attractive white female, turns the head of Dave's male friends, and the bond that he builds with her becomes threatening to Clarice and to their hopes of ever rebuilding the love they once had for each other.The acting is superb, particularly on the part of Morris Chestnut, Taraji P. Henson, and the lady who plays the mother-in-law. There's some nice comic relief, and there are a number of powerful scenes that don't always end with nice tidy resolutions. The message is one of hope and encouragement, but it doesn't feel too preachy or glib. It's a satisfying and worthy tale on a number of levels, and not one to be easily dismissed.",5,Not Easily Dismissed,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,1828,"['fan', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'bring', 'role', 'wife', 'dealing', 'struggling', 'marriage', 'own', 'involvement', 'Fireproof', 'one', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'based', 'screenplay', 'gave', 'appreciation', 'important', 'subject', 'yet', ""'d"", 'heard', 'little', 'film', 'expectations', 'overall', 'story', 'were', 'low.What', 'nice', 'surprise', 'being', 'crass', 'gratuitous', 'script', 'characters', 'portray', 'real', 'problems', 'believable', 'ways', 'Soon', 'rosy', 'opening', 'tie', 'knot', 'bishop', 'wise', 'words', 'barely', 'sinking', 'find', 'marriage', 'crumbling', 'beneath', 'financial', 'pressures', 'different', 'goals', 'drought', 'physical', 'intimacy', 'Dave', 'child', 'Clarice', 'career-minded', 'wanting', 'build', 'comfortable', 'lifestyle', 'even', 'faking', 'make', 'Dave', 'compensates', 'coaching', 'Little', 'League', 'activity', 'Clarice', 'understand', 'mother-in-law', 'push', 'way', 'home.With', 'things', 'already', 'rocky', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Clarice', 'physical', 'therapy', 'feeling', 'bitter', 'therapist', 'attractive', 'white', 'female', 'head', 'Dave', 'male', 'friends', 'bond', 'becomes', 'threatening', 'Clarice', 'hopes', 'ever', 'rebuilding', 'love', 'once', 'had', 'other.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'particularly', 'part', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'lady', 'who', 'mother-in-law', 'nice', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', 'number', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'end', 'nice', 'tidy', 'resolutions', 'message', 'one', 'hope', 'encouragement', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'preachy', 'glib', 'satisfying', 'worthy', 'tale', 'number', 'levels', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'easily', 'dismissed']",Not Easily Broken
