The story did have a nice twist to the Vampire story, but it got lost in the ho hum story somewhere between naps.This Vamp story was based on a student that lost her mom in an auto accident a couple years ago. Charllotte (Sharon Hinnendael) is an honor student with a full ride scholarship and under tremendous pressure to succeed. With the pressure come strange visions and flashbacks that are interfering with school. work and a possible love connection. During these flashbacks we learn that her families history dates back a few hundred years where all of her trouble originated. These little events happen to often for me and at times do little to explain Charlotte's problems.It was hard to feel very much empathy for Charlotte because of the way she interacted with other others and the poor character development regarding her predicament.The story has the usual problems that plague todays students like hazing, jealousy, alcohol, bullying, teachers lusting after the student and being shunned for being so everything.The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the locations and the landscape cinematography of Quest University in B. C. Canada and the surrounding mountain ranges and was real close to giving this one 3 stars because of the GOOD production values that are the Saving Grace of the movie. The other Saving Grace is the attractive cast and a few good performances by some of the cast.The movie does contain a fair amount of sex scenes with a fair amount of female nudity.The foul language was a lot less than expected and I can't remember if there was an f&#8230;word thrown in or not? The movie also has some hazing binge drinking and a few scenes of tame violence including decent gore/blood (knife, bite and spear wounds to the neck and torso) effects makeup.I really can't recommend this movie, but I will say the locations were worth it for me.",2,"""I'd RATHER EMBRACE THE SCENIC MOUNTAIN VIEWS""",1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,2009,"['was', 'one', 'movies', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'was', ""n't"", 'due', 'shortcomings', 'writing', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'story', 'did', 'have', 'nice', 'twist', 'Vampire', 'story', 'got', 'lost', 'ho', 'hum', 'story', 'somewhere', 'naps.This', 'Vamp', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'student', 'lost', 'mom', 'auto', 'accident', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Charllotte', 'Sharon', 'Hinnendael', 'honor', 'student', 'full', 'ride', 'scholarship', 'tremendous', 'pressure', 'succeed', 'pressure', 'come', 'strange', 'visions', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'interfering', 'school', 'work', 'possible', 'love', 'connection', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'families', 'history', 'dates', 'back', 'few', 'hundred', 'years', 'where', 'trouble', 'originated', 'little', 'events', 'happen', 'often', 'times', 'do', 'little', 'explain', 'Charlotte', 'problems.It', 'was', 'hard', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'empathy', 'Charlotte', 'way', 'interacted', 'other', 'others', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'regarding', 'predicament.The', 'story', 'usual', 'problems', 'plague', 'todays', 'students', 'hazing', 'jealousy', 'alcohol', 'bullying', 'teachers', 'lusting', 'student', 'being', 'shunned', 'being', 'so', 'everything.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'locations', 'landscape', 'cinematography', 'Quest', 'University', 'B.', 'C.', 'Canada', 'surrounding', 'mountain', 'ranges', 'was', 'real', 'close', 'giving', 'one', '3', 'stars', 'GOOD', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'movie', 'other', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'attractive', 'cast', 'few', 'good', 'performances', 'cast.The', 'movie', 'contain', 'fair', 'amount', 'sex', 'scenes', 'fair', 'amount', 'female', 'nudity.The', 'foul', 'language', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'expected', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'f', '8230', 'word', 'thrown', 'not', 'movie', 'also', 'hazing', 'binge', 'drinking', 'few', 'scenes', 'tame', 'violence', 'including', 'decent', 'gore/blood', 'knife', 'bite', 'spear', 'wounds', 'neck', 'torso', 'effects', 'makeup.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'locations', 'were', 'worth']",Embrace Of The Vampire 2013
