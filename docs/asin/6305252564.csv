Paul Scofield, John Hurt, Robert Shaw, Susannah York, Vanessa Redgrave and others star in this excellent adaptation of a play.  Thomas More was truly a man of honor, going against his king, who was a destructive, mean hothead.  Because he would not side with Henry VIII regarding his divorce from Queen Catherine of Aragon or his marriage to Anne Boleyn, she was beheaded.  A true story, one of a man's standing by his conscience and convictions.

Sir Thomas More is called by Cardinal Wolseley. We see their lives and manners. [Note the travel by rowboat.] Why did More oppose Wolseley? They watch King Henry ride out. The King needs a son. Can there be a miracle? Or a divorce? We hear the background of this problem. &#8220;No&#8221; says More. Without a successor there will be another dynastic war. Should private conscience overrule the needs of the state? More is approached by people who want favorable decisions. He returns home. He recommends Richard to become a teacher. He has a visitor, a man who wants to marry his daughter. He is refused because he is a heretic. His daughter asks about Wolseley - no comment. Winter brings a change to the Lord Chancellor - Sir Thomas More.Large rowboats convey King Henry. [Caps are worn in unheated houses.] King Henry isn&#8217;t stopped by a low tide. He visits More&#8217;s home and meets his family. The King and More talk in private. Henry complains about Wolseley. Can he divorce Catherine, the widow of his brother? He sons died at birth, as if a punishment for his sin. [Or a new disease?] We see Henry&#8217;s anger towards those who oppose his wishes for a new Queen. The courtiers run after the King. Will Roper wants to talk to More about a change in his opinion. Richard tells More about Cromwell&#8217;s interests. Should laws be disregarded in pursuit of a political end? [A hot poker warms a drink.] Did More accept a gift from a litigant? Will King Henry be named as the head of the Church in England? Yes. [Will added power lead to pride and corruption?]More resigned his office. He must cut back on his household, but he will find new places for them. Matthew is also dismissed. What will More do now? Teach his wife to read? More must keep his silence to protect himself and his wife. The King wants support from More. Cromwell plots to put pressure on More to get his support. While judges accept bribes it is still an offense. Cromwell explains his purpose to Lord Norfolk. More does not attend the King&#8217;s wedding. More is summoned by Cromwell to answer charges. Will More agree with the King&#8217;s wishes? Note More&#8217;s careful answers to the questions. It goes no good now. Boatmen refuse to serve him. Will more give in? He argues with the Duke of Norfolk to force a quarrel. Later Cromwell gets a new Act of Parliament passed about Henry&#8217;s marriage.More does not take the Oath, he is put in the Tower. Later he is taken to the Palace for questioning. More remains silent. &#8220;Come with us for fellowship.&#8221; He will not take the oath. He will get no books or visitors. Rich suggests a way to get More to talk. His daughter pleads with him to take the Oath, he refuses and explains why. More advises his family to leave the country by different boats, now. More is taken to Parliament, his health is poor. Norfolk accuses him of staying silent about the King&#8217;s title of Head of the Church. Does silence mean consent? Richard testifies against More. [Note the expression on Rich&#8217;s face when he testifies.] Is this perjury? The jury declares &#8220;Guilty&#8221;. More speaks his last words. He is God&#8217;s servant first. Five years later Cromwell was also condemned. King Henry died of syphilis before Norfolk could be executed. Elizabeth became Queen, the last of the Tudor line.Do these political conflicts remind you of events in some foreign countries (or corporations)? This was taken from a stage play.

Whatever the validity of reformers' claims against the Catholic church, Henry VIII knew his charges against his wife Catherine were groundless and that he was lying on God by corrupting scripture.  Rather than be a courageous sinner and head to perdition alone, he -- because he can -- is determined to take his advisors with him, and therefore demands universal complicity.  The viewer watches as the jackals at court who have stood with Henry in the past -- for good or ill -- are swept up as accomplices in his greatest crime.  Paul Scofield masterfully plays the man of conscience (and faith) who prefers to lose his head rather than commit heresy, thereby invoking the king's hatred and the envy and loathing of his other ministers.

456090,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,6305252564,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[2, 3]","Robert Bolt's screenplay differs considerably from Robert Bolt's stage play.  Gone is the narrator, also the lenthtly, chatty references to actual historial events.  The film is not a wordy history lesson.  The screenplay focuses very tightly on the battle between Henry VIII and Thomas More over divorce and Henry's bold acts to make him head of a new, non-Catholic English church.  Here, Bolt assumes that you know a little bit about English history. It compresses the events of several years into a neat running time of just over 2 hours.  Enjoyable as it is, it is just one view of Thomas Moore.  He is a little more saintly on film  than he actually was in life.  It avoids all the other issues that he dealth with as Chancellor.  It does very effectively zero in on a man facing a moral crisis, in which he must think of his ideals first and his family second. Moore's family suffered terribly as a result of his stance.  Neither the play nor the film discloses one interesting historical note:  John Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester, and also a vocal opponent of Henry's actions, was arrested several times for treason.  Just before his death a month before Moore's, the Pope elevated the Bishop to Cardinal, thinking that Henry would never execute a Cardinal.  Think again.  Historically, it was Fisher's death that raised a greater public outcry than Moore's.  Moore was simply one of many of Henry's opponents who went to their deaths as martyrs to the cause.  I know that's a history lession and I'm simply nitpicking. I think that Bolt's screenplay is tighter than the play; it is shorter but covers the same  material in a more tightly controlled way.  For an interesting difference of opinion on the character, read Charlton Heston's diary on playing Moore (in the full-length play) for cable television.  Heston lordly proclaims that HIS Moore is better than Scofield's.  He finds Scofield's portrail too &quot;winney&quot; and not lofty enough to justify the stature of the real man.  Anyway, the Fred Zinnemann film is outstanding and endures the test of time.  As with all historical dramas, license has certainly been taken, and you cannot believe that everything you see is exactly how it originally played out.  But Bolt is a supurb writer of human emotions.  He's a good story teller and that's all that counts in the end.",4,history: from stage to screen,1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,2343,"['Robert', 'Bolt', 'screenplay', 'differs', 'considerably', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'stage', 'play', 'Gone', 'narrator', 'also', 'lenthtly', 'chatty', 'references', 'actual', 'historial', 'events', 'film', 'not', 'wordy', 'history', 'lesson', 'screenplay', 'very', 'tightly', 'battle', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Thomas', 'More', 'divorce', 'Henry', 'bold', 'acts', 'make', 'head', 'new', 'non-Catholic', 'English', 'church', 'Here', 'Bolt', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'English', 'history', 'events', 'several', 'years', 'neat', 'running', 'time', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'Enjoyable', 'just', 'one', 'view', 'Thomas', 'Moore', 'little', 'more', 'saintly', 'film', 'actually', 'was', 'life', 'other', 'issues', 'Chancellor', 'very', 'effectively', 'zero', 'man', 'facing', 'moral', 'crisis', 'must', 'think', 'ideals', 'first', 'family', 'second', 'Moore', 'family', 'suffered', 'terribly', 'result', 'stance', 'play', 'film', 'one', 'interesting', 'historical', 'note', 'John', 'Fisher', 'Bishop', 'Rochester', 'also', 'vocal', 'opponent', 'Henry', 'actions', 'was', 'arrested', 'several', 'times', 'treason', 'Just', 'death', 'month', 'Moore', 'Pope', 'elevated', 'Bishop', 'Cardinal', 'thinking', 'Henry', 'would', 'never', 'execute', 'Cardinal', 'Think', 'again', 'Historically', 'was', 'Fisher', 'death', 'raised', 'greater', 'public', 'outcry', 'Moore', 'Moore', 'was', 'simply', 'one', 'many', 'Henry', 'opponents', 'who', 'went', 'deaths', 'martyrs', 'cause', 'know', 'history', 'lession', ""'m"", 'simply', 'nitpicking', 'think', 'Bolt', 'screenplay', 'tighter', 'play', 'shorter', 'same', 'material', 'more', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'way', 'interesting', 'difference', 'opinion', 'character', 'read', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'diary', 'playing', 'Moore', 'full-length', 'play', 'cable', 'television', 'Heston', 'lordly', 'HIS', 'Moore', 'better', 'Scofield', 'Scofield', 'portrail', 'too', 'quot', 'winney', 'quot', 'not', 'lofty', 'enough', 'justify', 'stature', 'real', 'man', 'Anyway', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'film', 'outstanding', 'test', 'time', 'historical', 'dramas', 'license', 'certainly', 'been', 'taken', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'everything', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'originally', 'played', 'out', 'Bolt', 'supurb', 'writer', 'human', 'emotions', 'good', 'story', 'teller', 'end']",N/A
456091,A3Q6KNHE70J4LA,6305252564,Alyn S. Rumbold,"[4, 4]","One of the greatest cinematic studies of the nature of personal integrity, I sometimes think that this film is in danger of being forgotten -- and it shouldn't be. One wonders at the degree of corruption in More's time that he should have been so highly regarded for his honesty -- and how he might have been regarded today.What Robert Bolt and Fred Zinnemann had wrought is absolutely brought to glorious life by the incomparable characterization of Sir Thomas More by the chronically underrated Paul Scofield. Bringing superb support to the role are Nigel Davenport as More's close friend Norfolk, who is caught between the rock of his respect and concern for More and the hard place of his duty to (and fear of) Henry VIII; Leo McKern as the jovially sinister Thomas Cromwell, whose verbal jousts with More are virtual poetry from Bolt's pen; John Hurt as More's fair-weather friend Richard Rich; Dame Wendy Hiller as More's devoted but frustrated and misunderstanding wife; and the elegant Susannah York as his equally devoted and strong-minded daughter. Two stand-out performances in relatively small but vital roles: Orson Welles, magnetic as the shrewdly pragmatic Cardinal Wolsey; and Robert Shaw, whose energetic portrayal of a young Henry VIII (before his corpulent days!) dominates the screen the two times he's on it.As with ""The Lion in Winter,"" the remarkable scriptwriting is the driving force behind the story, but Scofield's dignified, restrained, but at the same time quietly forceful delivery are what give the writing its power. The great quotes of the film (""Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the entire world...but for Wales?"" ""When you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience, and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?"" etc.) are conveyed with either enormous gravity or poignancy by nothing more than the tone of Scofield's voice.I think that the dilemma at the heart of the tale and how men of power came to grips with it is artfully summed up in the dying words of Wolsey and, of course, More. Wolsey regrets he did not serve God as well as he served his king. More, on the other hand, dies as ""His majesty's good servant...but God's first."" Whether criticized or praised as a morality play, it's wonderful to at least HAVE an uncompromising morality play to watch from time to time --especially one so well crafted.",5,"""This silence of his is bellowing....""",1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,2411,"['One', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'studies', 'nature', 'personal', 'integrity', 'sometimes', 'think', 'film', 'danger', 'being', 'forgotten', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'One', 'wonders', 'degree', 'corruption', 'More', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'highly', 'regarded', 'honesty', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'regarded', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'had', 'wrought', 'absolutely', 'brought', 'glorious', 'life', 'incomparable', 'characterization', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'chronically', 'underrated', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'Bringing', 'superb', 'support', 'role', 'are', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'More', 'close', 'friend', 'Norfolk', 'who', 'caught', 'rock', 'respect', 'concern', 'More', 'hard', 'place', 'duty', 'fear', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'jovially', 'sinister', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'verbal', 'jousts', 'More', 'are', 'virtual', 'poetry', 'Bolt', 'pen', 'John', 'Hurt', 'More', 'fair-weather', 'friend', 'Richard', 'Rich', 'Dame', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'More', 'devoted', 'frustrated', 'misunderstanding', 'wife', 'elegant', 'Susannah', 'York', 'equally', 'devoted', 'strong-minded', 'daughter', 'Two', 'stand-out', 'performances', 'relatively', 'small', 'vital', 'roles', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'magnetic', 'shrewdly', 'pragmatic', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'energetic', 'portrayal', 'young', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'corpulent', 'days', 'screen', 'two', 'times', 'it.As', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'remarkable', 'scriptwriting', 'driving', 'force', 'story', 'Scofield', 'dignified', 'restrained', 'same', 'time', 'quietly', 'forceful', 'delivery', 'are', 'give', 'writing', 'power', 'great', 'quotes', 'film', 'Why', 'Richard', 'profits', 'man', 'nothing', 'give', 'soul', 'entire', 'world', 'Wales', 'When', 'are', 'sent', 'heaven', 'doing', 'conscience', 'am', 'sent', 'hell', 'not', 'doing', 'mine', 'will', 'come', 'fellowship', 'etc', 'are', 'conveyed', 'enormous', 'gravity', 'poignancy', 'nothing', 'more', 'tone', 'Scofield', 'voice.I', 'think', 'dilemma', 'heart', 'tale', 'how', 'men', 'power', 'came', 'grips', 'artfully', 'summed', 'up', 'dying', 'words', 'Wolsey', 'course', 'More', 'Wolsey', 'did', 'not', 'serve', 'God', 'as', 'well', 'served', 'king', 'More', 'other', 'hand', 'majesty', 'good', 'servant', 'God', 'first', 'Whether', 'criticized', 'praised', 'morality', 'play', 'wonderful', 'least', 'HAVE', 'uncompromising', 'morality', 'play', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'especially', 'one', 'so', 'well', 'crafted']",N/A

456094,A38N4MOCLSOKOH,6305252564,Armando A. Gomez,"[1, 8]","There's this school of thought that those who practice morality and reason, and stand their ground, can overcome the unscrupulousness of the moment.  Some might say that's divine. And that would be neat but poor Thomas More didn't lose his head in Heaven but on earth. No, the conflict in question, divine or not, was in the realm of mortals. In other words, someone had to die for the displeasure of the king. Still, the film ""A Man For All Seasons"" is a ""superlatively"" film. When it first appeared in theaters (1966), I was in high school, a year before graduation. I decided not to see it; I was still hooked on ""adventure"" period pieces. It wasn't until the mid 80's that I viewed it for the first time. I was astound. It was pure British art and culture piece. My first impression: Thomas More was a true hero. Second impression (in 2011): Thomas More was foolish. Why foolish? For a man with such scope and intelligence, he either failed to see the fallacy of an institutionalized religion and what constitute a monarchy, or he took upon himself to wrestle with the royal sophistry. In order to win such sophistry, you'll need an army, which he had none. For me, More lost his argument not when he was confront by King Henry, but at the very beginning of the film, with Cardinal Wolsey. It would have been reasonable, to say the least, that More should have agreed to the king's divorce or the kingdom will find itself with ""dynastic wars."" This could have easily destroy England back then. Or, had More agreed with the divorce then, he would not have ""lost"" his head. Or, amazingly, the Reformation might have come to a shrinking halt, which it would have been a plus for him, since he was catholic. But, more importantly, he would have live to tell the tale.

Paul Scofield gives an electrifying performance as heroic intellectual,Sir Thomas More.Very faithful screen play rendering by Robert Bolt of his equally superb play comprises ironically ""uncompromising""didactic entertainment.A Man For All Seasons is devoid of what makes most PM movies successful.There is no pornographic sex,violence or gratuitous obscenity.The film is illuminating study of what it means to be truthful,honorable and good.Viewers seriously interested in the life of Sir Thomas (not canonized saint until 1935) will find Peter Ackroyd's historiographical study,THE LIFE OF THOMAS MORE, peerless.The film's ensemble cast is unquestionably one of the finest everarrayed. Wendy Hiller merits special note as Thomas'second wife, Lady Alice,whose love and courage strengthens her famous and brilliant husband to his task of ultimate sacrifice for CONSCIENCE. If Sir Thomas were alive today where LYING from Presidents;to ball players;to elementary school children(about cheating)perhaps he would be astounded at with how little currency the value of TRUTH is regarded. Even More's fiercest enemies...essayed by Leo McKern as the unscrupulous Cromwell; and John Hurt as Judas-Richard Rich...knew they were LIARS and did not rationalize abuse of truth and language as their PM counterparts(and PC police)unhesitatingly do.Some viewers will be undoubtedly bewildered by Sir Thomas'""disproportinate obstinacy"" in steadfastly refusing to LIE for the King; as they were in seeing JESUS (in last year's astonishingly powerful PASSION of the CHRIST)suffer sadistic degradation and brutality in DYING for  redemption of men.""What does it profit a man to win the world,if he lose his immortal soul?""echoed Sir Thomas to perjury of then Attorney General of Wales(later himself Prime Minister of England),Sir Richard Rich.

Indeed so! This stuff happened 500 years ago, and nobody cares what happened that time. Seriously, this picture bears no relevance to me; it's like, ""Oh gosh...this is a serious picture about a conflict among the nobility of England during 16th Century."" But excuse me...I am an American living in 21st Century. Who the hell cares? Anyway, wow...what an overrated performance by Paul Scofield. But that's okay...too much drugs were consumed during the 60's. Actually, I decided to see A Man for All Seasons for Robert Shaw, a very underrated actor, and as usual, he steals the show whenever he appears. Basically, the plot is that a noble refused to consent to a divorce for the King and was summarily executed for it. And that's all about the film. I couldn't believe my eyes that I wasted two hours to watch all of that. I knew it was going to be a disappointment the moment I found out the name of the director for the film, and it's nobody but Fred Zinnemann. He has always been a vastly overrated director, and he is awesome in bringing the mediocrity out of a film in the best way possible. In A Man for All Seasons, he did exactly that just like how he did with High Noon, From Here to Eternity, and The Men. All in all, give me a break.",2,Boring.

It stands as a great film in its own right, not least because the filmmaker had the good sense to leave well enough alone. Unlike most Hollywood fare, this film does not seek to overwhelm us with style because it knows that it has something better on offer - genuine substance.I don't want to get into a lengthy discussion about the life of Thomas More or the meaning inherent in this work. If you are looking for such a synopsis, I invite you to read my review of the play.This film though, like all films, constitutes something more than either its literary or its theatrical ancestry. Film affords filmmakers the opportunity to 'improve' on the source material. It allows for framing and perspective changes, close-ups, points of view, cutaways, on-location scenes and those musty Hollywood crutches, stunts and special effects. This material could easily have been 'improved' to the point of repugnance. Give thanks that it was not.The performances are all superb. Paul Scofield deserves his Oscar for his performance as More. Indeed, after seeing him play More, it's impossible imagining anyone else in the part. Like George C Scott's &quot;Patton&quot;, or Peter O'Toole's &quot;Lawrence&quot;, or Marlon Brando's &quot;Godfather&quot;, Scofield's More is definitive. The supporting cast is just as good, but the performances, good as they are, serve to enhance the film, not define it.This is a film that deserves our appreciation because of what the filmmaker does not do. He resists melodrama, histrionics and embellishment. This film is like a fine French wine: Zinnemann went for refinement and subtlety over pizzazz. Its Renaissance setting is used to enhance the story, not displace it. The filmmaker limits himself to showing us the life of a complex and fascinating man and has the good grace to leave the telling to Thomas More. A modern superstar director would not have been able to resist showing off his technical prowess. This film is great because it has the wisdom to recognize that its subject matter is stronger than any modern film conventions and therefore adopts a non-interventionist and minimalist approach to the filmmaking. The result is a clean and unmannered film that achieves great dignity and clarity of purpose.

The only movie I have seen that manages to portray romantic/married love without being maudlin or stupid. The relationship between More and his wife blows me away, especially in the last scene when he is talking about custard and she's screaming and he calls her a lion.

It doesn't just let us conclude that 'it is right for everyone to follow their consciences'. Thomas More does not simply champion ""Freedom of Conscience"".

Crystal-clear plotting and staging: you know exactly what's going on all the time, and it grips with suspense from start to end. The performances: not a single weak link. Scofield is beyond praise. Shaw was wonderful as the king, especially in the manner he suggested inner insecurity, as well as self-will and self-indulgence. A head-chopping thug, but for some strange reason a popular thug: and he's still that way today. Bluff King Hal. Anne Boleyn: basically terrified. More's daughter Meg: scared to bits that the king might take a fancy to her. Wife Alice: dumb, but salt of the earth. Rich: knows precisely which side his bread is buttered on. Cromwell: the corporate suit, in spades. Norfolk: a blue-blooded Duke has to stay that way. One of the finest things about the screenplay is that you don't have to be a Roman Catholic, or even a Christian, to admire More's character --- as depicted here on screen. A lawyer with integrity!

When asked why, he was silent. This was perfectly legal, though the case was made against him that his silence constituted treason. He was found guilty and beheaded.Paul Scofield is superb as More and gives a rock-solid performance of this iron-willed man - perhaps TOO rock-solid: at times he's a hero beyond human dimensions.

456105,A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI,6305252564,Book Glutton,"[2, 3]","Here we have the movie version of the play, ""A Man for All Seasons."" It is worth purchasing and watching with ""few"" distractions. You want to catch the dialogue and the expressions. The plot is based on the true story of Saint Thomas More, the 16th-century Lord Chancellor of England, who refused to sign a letter asking the Pope to annul King Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and resigned rather than take an Oath of Supremacy declaring the King the Supreme Head of the Church of England. More is portrayed as a man of principle, motivated by his devout Roman Catholic faith.The story begins with the then Cardinal Wolsey calling Thomas from his home to the King's palace one evening. He was once more appealing to him for his support in obtaining a divorce from the Pope so that the King could marry Anne Boleyn. Simply put, Sir Thomas, knowing that Church teaching would not support this and the Pope would not grant it, puts his faith on the line and responds, ""No, Your Grace, I'm not going to help you.""Wolsey bitterly suggests that if only More could see ""facts flat on"" without his ""horrible moral squint"", he ""might have made a statesman."" More responds, ""I think that when statesmen forsake their own private consciences for the sake of their public duties, they lead their country by a short route to chaos.""It's not difficult to glean from this and recognize the age in which we are living. We live in a similar political climate. As our spiritual leader, Pope Benedict XVI dealt with this issue in 2008, while addressing the United States Bishops. He said that without God or religion having practical relevance for everyday life and our lives as Christians in particular, different influential persons or segments of our society can respond that, ""There are no absolute truths!"" Something supported by our faith or the Natural Law can be refuted as being ""Our truth, not theirs."" Individuals can protest, ""This may be true for you, but it is not for me."" This comes frequently with tremendous pressure to conform to public opinion. With this mindset, and in the hands of our politicians and civic leaders, ""forsaking their own private consciences for the sake of their public duties,"" our pluralistic society (respected by the Pope) embarks to journey along the way and in the direction that Saint Thomas More claimed they would be, ""leading their country by a short route to chaos."" We see this unfold with a tremendous buildup that keeps us immersed as the resultant outcome of the plot unfurls, which is great even if we know the story.I suppose we can ignore the message being taught here and, like Pilate, and infer, ""What is truth?"" I prefer to think that most will benefit from the opposite response, seeing that: this movie has much to teach us. It can show us where our political climate can lead us, the consequences, and what we need to do to avoid these.Should you want more of More et al after this, there is also the bookThe Life of Thomas More.

456112,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,6305252564,Classic Movie watcher,"[11, 11]","Paul Scofield gave an impeccable and unforgettable performance as the upright, well-respected scholar Sir Thomas More. His face was that of a man with intelligence, integrity and principles. His meticulous and knowledgeable speech revealed his law expertise. Robert Shaw portrayed Henry VIII , who only appeared for a while in the movie, notably in his conversation with Thomas More. Though Charles Laughton was famous in his role as King Henry VIII, Robert Shaw pulled off an impressive performance as a self-centred King who greatly respected Thomas More,wanted his blessing for his divorce with Queen Catherine and his new union with Anne Boleyn.In the movie, Thomas More put God in his heart and top in his priority list. He made a stance by refusing to sign an oath siding with the King, thus ending up in the Tower. Despite the urging of his friend, Duke of Norfolk, and the begging of his family (Wendy Hiller as his wife and Susannah York as his daughter), he held on to his own principles and meet his fate.The heartbreaking scenes and unforgettable diaglogues include his parting with his family in the Tower. Unable to convince his husband, Lady More dared people to ask her views on King's marriage, preparing to die with her husband. ""I have married a lion, "" exclaimed Thomas. Before that, Thomas's daughter warned him of the King's request on people taking the oath. More asked ""What's the exact wording of the oath?"" Perhaps his daughter or even he himself could take it without betraying his conscience. This might be God's way for them to escape. Susannah York was excellent as More's brave and intelligent daughter. Thomas's conversation with Richard Rich(John Hurt), the young and compromised betrayer, and Cromwell(Leo McKern), the persistent persecutor, were always dangerous. Thomas was walking on thin ice and avoided their attacks barely by a shrewd wordplay. When he told his son-in-law ""If the laws were all flat,"" nothing could protect them. ""No law should be cut"", for their peace's sake, underlied the following legal battles that awaited him. Thomas fought each of them bravely to save his own life. The last declaration of a weak and tired Thomas, in a half broken voice, was most impressive.Yet what went wrong? Is it that Thomas More had too high hopes for the law of England? too confident of his own knowledge of law? Is it because that those responsible for his trial were not on his par and incapable of upholding justice for their lack of knowledge of the spirit of law?The biggest irony would be Richard Rich. At the beginning, Thomas More refused to give him a job, except for a teaching post, because he feared Rich could not resist the temptation of a bribe and would be corrupted. While Thomas thought Rich should not be given a place in the court, in the end it was Thomas himself who was ousted. Rich climbed up the ladder, became the Attorney General of Wales and even the Chanceller ultimately. ""For Wales?"" Thomas asked Rich how he could betray him and Rich's own soul for just Wales, not even for the world. The unsolved puzzle was whether and how Thomas's death affected the world, particularly Rich in his later life as the chancellor of the UK. Did he turn a better man or worse?

Follows the tortured trial of Henry Vlll's trusted advisor and Chancellor of England, Sir Thomas More who, based on the dictates of his conscience, refuses to condone Henry Vlll's divorce.For most of the piece Paul Scofield as More eludes his enemies in Henry's court by parsing his language and word play and, as a result, it is a great period flick on points of law. They can't ""get him"" unless he speaks his mind just-so, so he remains silent when expedient to avoid being seen as treasonous.  He is ultimately tripped up on a minor point and, once his fate is sealed, he reveals his true feelings and makes a great case for a man being true to himself even in the face of great peril.  Great morality play, one of the best. Leo McKern as the dogged and clever Thomas Cromwell, and a young John Hurt as the fictional but essential and pitiable stooge Richard Rich, are standouts.A Man For All Seasons deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and it holds up to repeated viewings.

The action surrounds the refusal of Sir Thomas More, an exalted and atypically honest jurist and author played wonderfully by Paul Scofield, to accept and bless the divorce of King Henry VIII and his subsequent marriage to Anne Boleyn.More, an erudite man with fervent religious beliefs was appointed Lord Chancellor succeeding Cardinal Wolsey played in a cameo by Orson Wells, in 1529, the first lay person to be so honored.  His principles forbade him to condone Henry's attempts to sway his opinion of his impending marriage.  Henry played by Robert Shaw used Secretary Thomas Cromwell played very capably by Leo McKern to charge More with treason.  Held in the Tower of London on trumped up charges, More steadfastly refused to take an oath decreeing Henry the supreme power of the Church of England in a break from the Holy See.More was separated from his wife Dame Alice and daughter Margaret played excellently by Wendy Hiller and Susannah York respectively.  Perjured testimony provided by the lecherous John Hurt playing Richard Rich, who had been spurned by Scofield for a position in the courts ultimately led to his undeserved sentence of death.For those movie aficionados of superb acting performances ""A Man for All Seasons"" would be a treat.  The period costuming, sets and cinematography were all excellent and deserving of the Oscars that they garnered.

Certainly, Sir Thomas More was a magnificent person who died a martyr and has been canonized a saint.  However, don't confuse the play and movie with the flesh and blood man.  He was much more complex in real life than the purely noble performance of Paul Scofield.  You can read the biography of Thomas More by Peter Ackroyd to get at some of his complexities.But this is a wonderful movie and I recommend it with great enthusiasm.  It is a powerful movie and can have some useful at least temporary curative effect on the soul suffering under the ironical detachment and cynicism of our time.  Scofield is wonderful and the definitive performance of this role.  Orson Welles is quite special as the corpulent and corrupt Cardinal Wolsey.  John Hurt is superb as the traitor Richard Rich.  Shaw is fine as Henry VIII as is the rest of the cast.And who can forget the line where More asks to see chain of office that Richard Rich was given to perjure himself and betray More.  After examining it and being told that Sir Richard was made the Attorney General of Wales More says, ""Richard, it profits a man nothing to trade his soul for the whole world, but for Wales ...""

But soon, there is a moment of pleasantry and calm in More's ""house of learning and virtue"" as he leads his wife and his scholarly daughter, Margaret( a delicate looking Susannah York)in evening prayers.Among many impressive portrayals of historical figures in this film are Robert Shaw as the conivivial, but mercurial Henry VIII , Leo McKern as Thomas Cromwell( a lawyer remembered for being less scupulous than More),Orson Wells as Cardinal Wolsey,Nigel Davenport as the Duke of York, Cyril Luckham as Archibishop Cramner, Yootha Joyce as Averil Machin, Colin Blakely as  More's devoted servant, Matthew, Eira Heath as Matthew's wife,(both of whom face disappointment in having to leave More's household when their employer's status changes), Colin Redgrave as Margaret's intended Will Roper, John Hurt as Richard Rich, who forgoes More's advice to become a teacher, and ends up being remembered as one of the most unscrupulous men in British history(although one admires his talent for survival given the perils of the time in which he lived), and finally Vanessa Redgrave in her brief scene as Anne Boleyn.Zinneman, Bolt, and Moore showed themselves as visual oarsmen, who, like the boatmen on the Thames featured in this film, take viewers on a journey of the salient points of More's life,which to say the least,was no Utopia. We view More's crisis of conscience, his failure to comply with the King's wishes regarding his marriage, even in the face of pleas from his wife and daughter, his decline in status as he loses his servants, and faces a daughter and son-in-law forced to cut greens forfuel because of his unwillingness to compromise his principals.Eventually, More ends up in the Tower of London, watching the seasons change through a small window, and his family are allowed one last visit with him.His trial is the climax of the film, and the dialogue is at once intense, inspirational, and stirring.All of this culminates into the serene image of a bee pollinating flowers as a staid More makes his final speech on the scaffold--strangely disassociated images, as a noteworthy life awaits a graphic end....The fate of More's contemporaries is reviewed in the finale, which leaves a viewer to ponder how they would have dealt with a smiliar situation, perhaps emphasizing with those who took different courses of action from those of the title character, and the satisfaction of having seen an onscreen masterpiece that still shines and inspires.",5,A Stately Tale Depicted With Austere Beauty,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,3633,"['failure', 'depict', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'who', 'indeed', 'did', 'preside', 'executions', 'Protestants', 'many', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'piece', 'have', 'mentioned', 'give', 'effort', 'ushered', 'Tudor', 'England', 'film', 'genre', '1960s', 'early', ""'70s"", 'five', 'stars', 'Fred', 'Zinneman', 'onscreen', 'depiction', 'one', 'best', 'plays', 'English', 'Delerue', 'magnificent', 'score', 'Ted', 'Moore', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'bolster', 'help', 'recapture', '16th', 'century', 'setting', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'screenplay', 'taken', 'latter', 'own', 'stage', 'production.Rowing', 'reed-laden', 'Thames', 'messenger', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'residence', 'lawyer', 'Thomas', 'More', 'formidably', 'portrayed', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'most', 'iconic', 'role', 'pressing', 'give', 'input', 'King', 'Great', 'Matter', 'question', 'validity', 'marriage', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'who', 'was', 'previously', 'wed', 'King', 'now-deceased', 'brother', 'who', 'failed', 'give', 'King', 'living', 'male', 'heirs', 'free', 'marry', 'Court', 'Lady', 'Anne', 'Boleyn.More', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Dame', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'apprehension', 'Mistress', 'Boleyn', 'business', 'soon', 'moment', 'pleasantry', 'calm', 'More', 'house', 'learning', 'virtue', 'wife', 'scholarly', 'daughter', 'Margaret', 'delicate', 'looking', 'Susannah', 'York', 'evening', 'prayers.Among', 'many', 'impressive', 'portrayals', 'historical', 'figures', 'film', 'are', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'conivivial', 'mercurial', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'lawyer', 'remembered', 'being', 'less', 'scupulous', 'More', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'Duke', 'York', 'Cyril', 'Luckham', 'Archibishop', 'Cramner', 'Yootha', 'Joyce', 'Averil', 'Machin', 'Colin', 'Blakely', 'More', 'devoted', 'servant', 'Matthew', 'Eira', 'Heath', 'Matthew', 'wife', 'whom', 'face', 'disappointment', 'having', 'leave', 'More', 'household', 'when', 'employer', 'status', 'changes', 'Colin', 'Redgrave', 'Margaret', 'intended', 'Will', 'Roper', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Richard', 'Rich', 'who', 'More', 'advice', 'become', 'teacher', 'up', 'being', 'remembered', 'one', 'most', 'unscrupulous', 'men', 'British', 'history', 'one', 'talent', 'survival', 'given', 'perils', 'time', 'lived', 'finally', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'brief', 'scene', 'Anne', 'Boleyn.Zinneman', 'Bolt', 'Moore', 'showed', 'visual', 'oarsmen', 'who', 'boatmen', 'Thames', 'featured', 'film', 'take', 'viewers', 'journey', 'salient', 'points', 'More', 'life', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'Utopia', 'view', 'More', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'failure', 'comply', 'King', 'wishes', 'regarding', 'marriage', 'even', 'face', 'pleas', 'wife', 'daughter', 'decline', 'status', 'servants', 'daughter', 'son-in-law', 'forced', 'cut', 'greens', 'forfuel', 'unwillingness', 'compromise', 'principals.Eventually', 'More', 'up', 'Tower', 'London', 'watching', 'seasons', 'change', 'small', 'window', 'family', 'are', 'allowed', 'one', 'last', 'visit', 'him.His', 'trial', 'climax', 'film', 'dialogue', 'once', 'intense', 'inspirational', 'stirring.All', 'serene', 'image', 'bee', 'pollinating', 'flowers', 'staid', 'More', 'final', 'speech', 'scaffold', 'strangely', 'disassociated', 'images', 'noteworthy', 'life', 'graphic', 'end', '.The', 'fate', 'More', 'contemporaries', 'reviewed', 'finale', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'dealt', 'smiliar', 'situation', 'perhaps', 'emphasizing', 'who', 'took', 'different', 'courses', 'action', 'title', 'character', 'satisfaction', 'having', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'inspires']",N/A

Not knowing what to expect, I was floored, and still am, by the genius of this film (which very closely follows Robert Bolt's outstanding play, ""A Man for All Seasons"" -- also available on Amazon).I've seen the DVD over 200 times and can probably follow it word for word.Other than Paul Scoffield's absolutely BRILLIANT performance, the other performance which shines through is that of a young, handsome John Hurt playing Richard Rich.  [You might recognize Hurt as the magical wands-shopkeeper in the Harry Potter film series.]Some of the greatest lines/scenes in this incredibly intelligent, clever film:Richard Rich: ""I'm not depressed.  I'm lamenting.  I've lost my innocence!"" (nervously joking)Cromwell: (snaps) ""Some time ago. You only just noticed?""As an another reviewer pointed out, More's greatest line in the film: ""Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to lose his soul for the whole world... but for Wales??""The movie is even better than the play itself, as the film refines certain elements (i.e., omits Chapuys's character, streamlines the relationship with Rich).  However, the film only made VERY minor changes to the play -- since the play is quite brilliant and in no need of change -- so fans of the play will be surprised and pleased at how little the lines were changed.I can't recommend this movie enough.

Nevertheless, this movie is an interesting study about a man, a product of his era, who adhered to and was willing to die for a belief in a principle rather than succumb to absolute authority.  The script and the acting are outstanding throughout, including Wendy Hiller in her lesser role.This movie was made at a time in which it was not necessary to include explicit scenes of violence, sex or coarse languange in order to create an effective drama.  For those suffering from boredom and who need to be excited or disgusted, a modern gangster movie or perhaps Alien vs. Predator or Terminator will fulfill those desires.  If, however an individual desires to see drama at its best, something that stimulates thought, I enthusiatically recommend this film, not only for the acting and script but because it is an effective reminder of the challenge and importance of upholding valid principles.  Also, it's refreshing to see a movie in which the hero speaks in eloquent Englsh rather than the dismal street patois that has infected so many movies over the past 30 years and become the norm.

Henry (Robert Shaw) wanted his advisors to petition the Pope to annul his marriage to his first wife Catherine of Aragon because she had had many stillbirths and had produced only a daughter (later to become the Catholic Queen Mary I). Henry wanted to marry his new mistress Anne Boleyn. She was able to produce an heir - Elizabeth I - but no son. The grounds for the annulment were that Catherine had previously been married to Henry's brother, Arthur. Chief amongst Henry's advisors were Thomas Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop of York (Orson Wells) and the lawyer and writer Thomas More (Paul Scofield). But More had more allegiance to the Church than to either his own family or the king: we hear nothing in the film of his persecution of other 'heretics'. More's second wife Alice was played by Wendy Hillier and his daughter Margaret by Susannah York. Henry gets his way by assuming authority over the Church in England (in 1534) and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, supported him. But the architect of More's downfall was Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, brilliantly played by Leo McKern. He too eventually fell from grace after engineering Henry's marriage to his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves.This is an engrossing movie that accurately represents the historical facts, as far I know them. Once Catholic Queen Mary came to the throne, Cranmer was dispatched to the tower and subsequently beheaded for `betraying' the papacy.

This ordering of priorities places an dreadful air of inevitability over Director Fred Zinneman's austere but moving production, which features a talented cast and the superb dialogue from the play of the same name.Henry VIII (played with egotistical gusto by Robert Shaw) wishes to divorce Catherine of Aragon, who had been unable to bear him a son and heir.  The Catholic Church declines to grant him a divorce.  The King demands the support of Sir Thomas More (Paul Schofield), his Chancellor since the death of Cardinal Woolsey (Orson Welles).  Moore, a devout and relentlessly honest man, resists the King's demand.  Henry will tolerate no resistance on this matter, and Moore's enemies, including the schemer Cromwell (Leo McKern) and an ambitious young man (John Hurt) will frame him, leading to his trial and death for treason.""A Man for All Seasons"" poses a number of provocative moral challenges, not least the sagacity of Moore's refusal to bend to the King, at the cost of his life and his family's welfare.  A question not pursued by the movie is why Moore, an experienced man of government, would not take reasonable measures to defend himself against betrayal in a time of rough and tumble court politics, where the price of failure might be death.

After his Queen, Katherine of Aragon fails to produce a male heir to the throne and Henry VIII becomes infatuated with Anne Boleyn, he requests that his marriage to Katherine of Aragon be annulled claiming that it is and always was a sin to marry the wife of a brother. But, the Vatican refuses to agree and Thomas More refuses to endorse the proposed divorce.The conflict between King Henry VIII, played by Robert Shaw and Sir Thomas More, masterfully played by Paul Scofield is superb. At first, the King and More were great friends, both collaborating in writing the Defence of the 7 Sacraments, which negated Luther. As a result of this great work, the Vatican names King Henry VIII, Defender of the Faith, and as a result Henry VIII makes More Speaker of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. After the fall of Thomas Wolsey in 1529, King Henry VIII makes More his Lord Chancellor, a position that holds great power.But, this promotion does not last long and Thomas More resigns shortly after three years, claiming that he is not in the best of health, but everyone understands the motive to be his disapproval of Henry's stance towards the Pope and the Catholic Church. More does not attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn and is then accused of treason.More refuses to swear to the Act of Succession and the Oath of Supremacy. A friend asks him to sign... for friendship's sake and More answers: ""And when we go in front of God to be judged and you are forgiven because you followed your beliefs and I condemned and sent to hell because I went against mine... for friendship's sake... would you, for friendship's sake come with me?More is found guilty of treason and was beheaded.

More faces challenges all along the path of his decision regarding Henry's break with Rome and the Pope.  These come from all directions.

It is not a comedy, nor a tragedy in the classic sense.  In a word, it would seem to have little to recommend it -- however, it is one of the best film ever produced.  Turning largely on the issue of personal integrity and the conflict of competing calls to faithfulness, this is a drama of the interior struggle of Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, writ large across the political/religious landscape of Henry VIII's England.The whole tone of the film is excellent.  From the opening scenes of couriers dashing from Wolsey to More, backdrops of pre-Renaissance England fill the screen, from the magnificent but appropriate un-ornate manor houses and parliamentary scenes (the set of Westminster Hall, a building in which I once worked) to the costuming and music, period in style and instrumentation.  The director Fred Zimmermann resisted the urge to provide orchestral music as a background; indeed, through much of the film, there is no music at all, as the drama itself carries the weight of the narrative and atmosphere.  The cinematographer, Ted Moore, as well as the director received Academy Awards for their work.This is an actor's film, the force of the drama being driven by their performances.  Exceptional acting by John Hurt, Leo McKern, Nigel Davenport and Robert Shaw enhance lead actor Paul Scofield's Oscar-winning portrayal.  Scofield presents the intellectual More as a character of supreme integrity (following Bolt's play perfectly), an integrity hard to maintain in the shifting sands of Henry VIII's drive to break with Rome to secure a divorce.  More, as chancellor of England after Wolsey (portrayed in a slightly-more-than-cameo appearance by an effective but declining Orson Welles), was charged with maintaining both peace with the King and his faithfulness to the church, of which he was an acknowledged intellectual leader throughout Europe.  In the end, the church won out -- as More said at his execution, 'I remain the King's good subject, but God's first.'Hurt and McKern portray Richard Rich and Thomas Cromwell, schemers and social climbers of which royal courts are always full.  Nigel Davenport as the friend who becomes an enemy, himself turned by the political tides, is also effective, but the best role beyond Scofield's is that Robert Shaw, who portrays the 'lion of  England', Henry VIII, capricious and volatile, far too taken with his own sense of purpose and without many courageous enough to stand against him.The roles of More's wife Alice (Wendy Hiller) and daughter Meg (Susannah York) are admirably played.  Alice as the illiterate yet intelligent wife of More is concerned for the family's well-being; Meg as the educated daughter (More's experimental school practiced, generations ahead of its time, gender equality in education) almost steals the scene from Shaw at one point.  Hiller's performance as More's companion up to the scene in the Tower is strongly portrayed, and she does not lose her character in the face of so many other powerful figures.Rare in film-making today, the full force of the plot develops upon the device of  Qui tacet consentit - silence implies consent.  More relied on the legal idea that, so long as he did not speak out against the king, his silence implied consent and he was safe.  However, as Cromwell (correctly) argued, More's silence was not meaningless, nor was it taken as consent by any who knew him.  On this one point, More's integrity falters, for he was intelligent enough to know that the truth was different from the legal fiction; however, this was also the position he maintained regarding Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn.This is not a feel-good movie; indeed, the final narration makes one wonder rather at the idea of justice in the world.

This movie at least partially explains why. He remained firm to his stance that King Henry VIII can not be placed beyond  Papal authority. As the heretic King did not like More's idea - which was not sanitizing his divorce and marriage to Anne Boleyn - the end came to Sir More too soon.The strength of the movie is the steady and restrained and often with intelligent wit, with which Scofield carried the role.

""A Man For All Season"" is a political drama, recounting the story of the statesman Sir Thomas More (with an Academy Award winning performance by Paul Scofield).  Elevated to the position of Lord Chancellor of England to King Henry VIII, Thomas More finds himself at the heart of the struggle between church and state.  To legitimatize the divorce of his queen Catherine of Aragon and his subsequent marriage to Anne Boleyn despite the objections of the pope, King Henry seeks the support of Thomas by proclaiming himself the head of the church.  But in the clash of wills that ensues, Thomas proves to be a man of principles.  He experiences an increasing sense of isolation as he keeps both his principles and his wit, and refuses to compromise his beliefs.  The politics and characters are somewhat complex, but the character of Thomas More stands out as an inspiring light.  When the whole world stands against him, he stands up for the truth as a witty and compelling lawyer, even if it means losing his income, prestige, family, and life.  More's principles are juxtaposed with his unprincipled son-in-law Rich, who is a prime example of the spineless thinking of those whose opinion varies as soon the wind of political change blows ( ""Why, Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world ... But for Wales!"")  More maintains that his allegiance to God supercedes his allegiance to the king - ""I die the King's good servant...but God's first."" Perhaps it is more accurately stated by another reviewer: ""He does not protest England's corruption, but the Crown's attempt to corrupt him.""My only criticism is that More is presented as a saint without flaws.  How true and accurate his story is recounted I cannot judge.  Certainly the eloquent use of the language is not very realistic, but that is because the movie originates in a play (by Robert Bolt).  In the final analysis, the eloquent word usage actually raises the movie to a higher level, and the wit and articulation probably serves to increase appreciation with repeated viewing. A rarity in comparison to most modern movies, there is little objectionable content (besides a few incidences of blasphemy such as ""Goddammit"").  There are also some moments of beautiful filming.  This movie gathered six Academy Awards in 1966, including best picture, best actor, and best director.  It is certainly dated, both in terms of the possibilities of movie-making in 1966, and the sixteenth century era of Henry VIII which it depicts.  But the idea of standing up for your principles is a timeless characteristic that should be a goal for us all.  In an age of where lawyers and statesmen have little respect, ""A Man For All Seasons"" offers something for all of us to aspire to.",5,Inspiring: Required viewing for all statesmen and citizens.,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,2853,"['Brilliant', 'Perhaps', 'watching', 'Absolutely', 'Intelligent', 'Yes', 'Inspiring', 'Completely', 'Man', 'Season', 'political', 'drama', 'recounting', 'story', 'statesman', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'Elevated', 'position', 'Lord', 'Chancellor', 'England', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Thomas', 'More', 'heart', 'struggle', 'church', 'state', 'legitimatize', 'divorce', 'queen', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'subsequent', 'marriage', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'objections', 'pope', 'King', 'Henry', 'support', 'Thomas', 'proclaiming', 'head', 'church', 'clash', 'wills', 'ensues', 'Thomas', 'be', 'man', 'principles', 'increasing', 'sense', 'isolation', 'principles', 'wit', 'compromise', 'beliefs', 'politics', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'character', 'Thomas', 'More', 'out', 'inspiring', 'light', 'When', 'whole', 'world', 'up', 'truth', 'witty', 'compelling', 'lawyer', 'even', 'losing', 'income', 'prestige', 'family', 'life', 'More', 'principles', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'unprincipled', 'son-in-law', 'Rich', 'who', 'prime', 'example', 'spineless', 'thinking', 'opinion', 'varies', 'soon', 'wind', 'political', 'change', 'blows', 'Why', 'Richard', 'profits', 'man', 'nothing', 'give', 'soul', 'whole', 'world', 'Wales', 'More', 'maintains', 'allegiance', 'God', 'allegiance', 'king', 'die', 'King', 'good', 'servant', 'God', 'first', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'accurately', 'stated', 'reviewer', 'not', 'protest', 'England', 'corruption', 'Crown', 'attempt', 'corrupt', 'only', 'criticism', 'More', 'presented', 'saint', 'flaws', 'How', 'true', 'accurate', 'story', 'recounted', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'Certainly', 'eloquent', 'use', 'language', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'movie', 'play', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'final', 'analysis', 'eloquent', 'word', 'usage', 'actually', 'movie', 'higher', 'level', 'wit', 'articulation', 'probably', 'increase', 'appreciation', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'rarity', 'comparison', 'most', 'modern', 'movies', 'little', 'objectionable', 'content', 'few', 'incidences', 'blasphemy', 'such', 'Goddammit', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'beautiful', 'filming', 'movie', 'gathered', 'six', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1966', 'including', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'director', 'certainly', 'dated', 'terms', 'possibilities', 'movie-making', '1966', 'sixteenth', 'century', 'era', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'idea', 'standing', 'up', 'principles', 'timeless', 'characteristic', 'should', 'be', 'goal', 'age', 'where', 'lawyers', 'statesmen', 'have', 'little', 'respect', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'something', 'aspire']",N/A

It concerns itself with Thomas More, a man who refused to break with the Catholic church and join Henry VIII in establishing the Church of England.  The reasons that More does this are never sanctimonious or judgemental; he bases them on principles and integrity.  He ends up paying for his principles with his life.  The performances are superlative here, especially Paul Scofield as Thomas More.  The film was directed by Fred Zinneman, and his direction is so understated, quiet, and un-self conscious you don't feel like the film is being directed at all.  It is incredibly subtle, and the film really benefits from it.  Flashy camera moves and overbearing music (usually thrown in to say to the viewer ""this is a moving part"") always detract from a great story, and the story here is so powerful that no other attention getting devices are needed.  Zinneman should be commended for this, and the Academy awarded him Best Director for his efforts.  The only other film of Zinneman's I've seen is Day of the Jackal, and his direction there is very similar to what he does here.

456150,A226V8JEMD1HSE,6305252564,HOWARD MORLEY,"[12, 12]","I work in Thomas More Street, London E1 not far from the Tower of London and when working for a previous employer (Barclays) joined their Drama &amp; Operatic Society.One of the roles I was cast in was as William Roper, More's son-in -law who as Bolt states in his production notes to the play &quot; is a man of mediocre intellect&quot;.Yes I thought ironically that's me! How could I compete with a character who was prepared to go to the block for his Catholic beliefs.Talking of the block, not far from my workplace is the sight where those who committed &quot;treason&quot; and were incarcerated in the Tower, were executed and it bears a plaque bearing the names of its notable victims.Of course being filmed in 1966, I saw this film long before I was in the play (1974).We even did a performance &quot;in the round&quot; at All Hallows Church, in sight of the Tower and the film was obviously very much to the fore when we did our production.The intelligent comments from other reviewers I agree with especially the point that this film is about a man who tries to bend without breaking his inner religous beliefs but cannot deny his soul in the end.According to his biography, during his time as Chancellor More himself could be quite vindicative and witnessed with relish several condemned being hanged, drawn and quartered for their beliefs.Let us not forget why More was coerced thus by Henry VIII.He wanted a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, his first wife, who could only produce Mary (later &quot;Bloody Queen Mary&quot; in 1555).After failing to obtain a divorce from the Pope he set himself up as &quot;Defender of The Faith&quot; i.e. the titular head of the newly created Church of England and could thus give himself a divorce.It was important that the Act of Succession be countersigned by all the important court notables including its Chancellor.Sorry for the history lesson but viewers will appreciate the dialogue much better if they are clued up on this period of the Tudors.As so often when dealing with history, is is essential to get the facts right as a playwright (and film producer).Yes this does seems like a play with lovely location shots at times but in the interest of integrity, fiction should not be mixed into fact (faction) a la Titanic (1997) just to pull in those with a low attention span.Of cource we know the pressure film producers are under to appeal to as wide range of audience as possible with high budgets to recoup, so it is not surprising dramatic licence is taken in filming history and its been said before but audiences should not obtain their knowledge of history just from films.This film was easily the best film for that year and richly deserved the Oscar.Might I suggest viewers read up on this period of Tudor history before seeing the film to obtain empathy for the main characters and what drove them.For example it was essential Henry had a male heir as queens were not then anointed to rule this land and he needed a male successor.Cromwell was appointed and under pressure from Henry to find &quot;the final solution&quot; and we all know what that entails.He was driven to condemn More for not bending to his will in days when democracy as we know it, did not exist.",5,SCHOFIELD'S DEFINITIVE ROLE,1048809600,"03 28, 2003",2003,3235,"['work', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Street', 'London', 'E1', 'not', 'far', 'Tower', 'London', 'when', 'working', 'previous', 'employer', 'Barclays', 'joined', 'Drama', 'amp', 'Operatic', 'Society.One', 'roles', 'was', 'cast', 'was', 'William', 'Roper', 'More', 'son-in', '-law', 'who', 'Bolt', 'states', 'production', 'notes', 'play', 'quot', 'man', 'mediocre', 'intellect', 'quot', 'thought', 'ironically', 'How', 'could', 'compete', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'prepared', 'go', 'block', 'Catholic', 'beliefs.Talking', 'block', 'not', 'far', 'workplace', 'sight', 'where', 'who', 'committed', 'quot', 'quot', 'were', 'incarcerated', 'Tower', 'were', 'executed', 'plaque', 'bearing', 'names', 'notable', 'victims.Of', 'course', 'being', 'filmed', '1966', 'saw', 'film', 'long', 'was', 'play', '1974', '.We', 'even', 'did', 'performance', 'quot', 'round', 'quot', 'Hallows', 'Church', 'sight', 'Tower', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'much', 'fore', 'when', 'did', 'production.The', 'intelligent', 'comments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'agree', 'especially', 'point', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'bend', 'breaking', 'inner', 'religous', 'beliefs', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'soul', 'end.According', 'biography', 'time', 'Chancellor', 'More', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'vindicative', 'witnessed', 'relish', 'several', 'condemned', 'being', 'hanged', 'drawn', 'quartered', 'beliefs.Let', 'not', 'forget', 'why', 'More', 'was', 'coerced', 'thus', 'Henry', 'VIII.He', 'wanted', 'divorce', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'first', 'wife', 'who', 'could', 'only', 'produce', 'Mary', 'later', 'quot', 'Bloody', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'quot', '1555', '.After', 'failing', 'obtain', 'divorce', 'Pope', 'set', 'up', 'quot', 'Defender', 'Faith', 'quot', 'i.e', 'titular', 'head', 'newly', 'created', 'Church', 'England', 'could', 'thus', 'give', 'divorce.It', 'was', 'important', 'Act', 'Succession', 'be', 'countersigned', 'important', 'court', 'notables', 'including', 'Chancellor.Sorry', 'history', 'lesson', 'viewers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'dialogue', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'clued', 'up', 'period', 'Tudors.As', 'so', 'often', 'when', 'dealing', 'history', 'essential', 'get', 'facts', 'right', 'playwright', 'film', 'producer', '.Yes', 'play', 'lovely', 'location', 'shots', 'times', 'interest', 'integrity', 'fiction', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'mixed', 'fact', 'faction', 'la', 'Titanic', '1997', 'just', 'pull', 'low', 'attention', 'span.Of', 'cource', 'know', 'pressure', 'film', 'producers', 'are', 'appeal', 'wide', 'range', 'audience', 'possible', 'high', 'budgets', 'recoup', 'not', 'surprising', 'dramatic', 'licence', 'taken', 'filming', 'history', 'been', 'said', 'audiences', 'should', 'not', 'obtain', 'knowledge', 'history', 'just', 'films.This', 'film', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscar.Might', 'suggest', 'viewers', 'read', 'up', 'period', 'Tudor', 'history', 'seeing', 'film', 'obtain', 'empathy', 'main', 'characters', 'what', 'drove', 'them.For', 'example', 'was', 'essential', 'Henry', 'had', 'male', 'heir', 'queens', 'were', 'not', 'then', 'anointed', 'rule', 'land', 'needed', 'male', 'successor.Cromwell', 'was', 'appointed', 'pressure', 'Henry', 'find', 'quot', 'final', 'solution', 'quot', 'know', 'what', 'entails.He', 'was', 'driven', 'condemn', 'More', 'not', 'bending', 'will', 'days', 'when', 'democracy', 'know', 'did', 'not', 'exist']",N/A

Yes, it shows only one side of Sir Thomas More, and we fleetingly glimpse More's intense revulsion toward Protestantism and its followers (he sent some of them to the stake for heresy).  But the side that the movie portrays is accurate, as Sir Thomas deeply loved his family and believed in educating both his son and his daughters (he had six girls: Three were his own, two were adopted, and one became his ward and later married his son).  Sir Thomas also displayed a flashing wit that could run the gamut from light-hearted to biting.  Paul Scofield's Oscar-winning portrayal of Sir Thomas has yet to be topped; not even Charlton Heston could do it.  Orson Welles is perfect as Henry VIII's right-hand man Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, while Leo McKern's cunning Thomas Cromwell and John Hurt's sleazebag-in-training Richard Rich send chills down your spine.

This 1966 winner for Best Picture is stellar in every respect; each craft delivers its best work and the acting is first rate.  Paul Scofield won the Oscar as Best Actor in his first major screen role.  Sadly we don't have nearly enough Scofield film work to preserve for posterity.  Paul preferred stage acting and while I can understand his preference I mourn the fact that this great actor can't be seen in more films.  (See him in the Burt Lancaster film ""The Train"" from this same decade) But this outing shows his power and range as Sir Thomas More who became Chancellor of England for Henry VIII, and died for standing by his deeply felt moral principles.  Some say the film is so good because it wasn't a high priority production for Columbia Pictures and they left director Fred Zinnemann and company alone to create.  I don't know if that's the case but it has many historically correct touches.  Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey uses genuine sheepskin parchment with a real quill pen as well as an exact duplicate of Wolsey's official seal. The ax used in the execution scene is authentic from the period.  ""A Man for All Seasons"" won six Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture.  It features an excellent period musical score by George Delerue and the backbone of any film, wonderful writing by Robert Bolt who also won an Oscar.  Even the smaller roles are expertly played...look for a young John Hurt and the wonderful Leo McKern.  Vanessa Redgrave shows up in an  uncredited role as Anne Boleyn.

Prior to writing a review I try to read a reasonable sample of previous writers' opinions as something to  gage against my own.There appears to be a clear consensus on this film and also agreement on the performance of Paul Scofield which needs not be repeated here. Great, great film. I was a bit surprised to read that one individual was upset with the film because it wildly distorted the life of Sir Thomas More. This person, who rated the film at 1 star, further stated that the historical figure was an individual who was just short of being one of histories worst monsters.I never knew this, and if true it really surprises me that the film would portray Sir Thomas as a God fearing man.  Notwithstanding, this was a great film and should receive 5 stars.

But for Wales!""It is in works like this that we understand the true meaning of ""humanities""-the essence of being human!This film is a psychodrama of ethics and integrity.  Sadly, nowadays, we change our ethics quicker than we change the channel, but that is not right.  Ethics are only meaningful if they make us do the uncomfortable, if they make us go against our inner natures.  Valley Forge was no picnic, and I think Jesus Christ would have rather been on a picnic instead of a cross-""Let this cup pass, nevertheless . . .""This film is about Sir Thomas Moore, the chancellor of England and the ethical dilemma he gets in when Henry VIII wants to divorce his wife, so he can have a male heir to the throne.  Moore sticks to his guns and is eventually beheaded, partly due to the betrayl of Ruichard Rich, an old associate of his who was bought off by a public office in Wales.Nowadays, the premise of this film is absolutely laughable, but that says more about ""nowadays"" than it does the film.Oddly enough, the premise and the sympathetic portrayal of Moore makes this one of the last pro-Catholic films ever made.Oh, for a Thomas Moore to stick to his guns and his standards!  C-SPAN is just a perpetual gallery of sell-out after sell-out defending his mistakes and attacking the truth.  We see how crooked things are nowadays as they are held up to the straight edge of Thomas Moor.  Mind, you Moore is not a Bible-thumper, or an in your face ""values nazi,"" and he would certainly not bomb an abortion clinic.  But his was an example of angelic quite dignity and majesty.There are excellent performances all around, and Oscar has duly honored this film.  The filming locations are perfect, and the costumes magnificent.  The only complaint I would have is that it is weak in the cinematography.  Since I come from the Fritz Lang and Greg Toland School, this comment says more about me than it does the film.The DVD has a superb copy, but the sound is normal.

This movie could be watched ""fresh"" by an 18 year old today and I believe they would have the same delight and interest in the story and its message that I did back then. Scofield is masterly --- he has a marvellous ability to NOT RUSH, and as a result we hang onto his words, and get the full force of his acting.  Leo McKern, whom we are happily familiar with as the kindly ""Rumpole of the Bailey"", is here a relentless and bullying Thomas Cromwell; he makes me determined to read the Hilary Mantel novels based on his life. ADDENDUM, later: the most useful correction from Mantel's book is to show up the much-worshipped More as a vindictive prude who was not averse to torture of dissenters.  Mantel's portrayal of Thos Cromwell matches that in the film: a nasty piece of work, whom Mantel attempts to ""sell"" on the basis of his cleverness.Drawbacks?  I'm afraid the women were not directed well; that is, both Susannah Yorke (More's daughter) and Vanessa Redgrave (Henry's new queen)are obliged to make Barbie eyes and smiles, and simper, and generally make the audience --- men and women --- cringe.  These are two major acting talents, and somebody misused them in this film. They must be angry, looking back at it.Scofield's script is wonderful.

456176,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6305252564,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 8]","This 1966 film won an Academy Award for Paul Scofield who played the role of Sir Thomas More.  It's set in 16th Century England and is based on the true story of King Henry VIII, who, because he wanted to divorce his wife, defied the Pope and named himself the head of the Church of England.  Sir Thomas More, however, was a highly principled man.  He felt the King's action to be wrong.  A clash of wills ensues. Sir Thomas More is imprisoned.  And later beheaded.This is a grand theme and a grand story.  The England of those days is recreated and the costumes are magnificent.  The language however, made me wonder because, even though the dialog seemed authentic, it did not sound like Shakespeare's English.  It was also not as fast moving as Shakespeare would have written it.  I found myself bored in parts.  It did make me think, though, about the system of justice that has existed in England since the Magna Carta, and how fortunate we Americans are to have this as our background.  True, it did not work out so well for Sir Thomas More, but at least there's a judge and a jury and a quest towards justice.  Other systems of government might have dealt with what the King saw as a betrayal in a much more expedient way.All the actors, including Wendy Hiller, Robert Shaw, Orson Wells and John Hurt were excellent. They could not have done a better job.  The film is as timely today as it was then.  It's about a question of morals and a person willing to go to his death because of his principles.  This is an important theme.  I like it.  I just found I could get up, leave the room, come back and they'd still be dealing with the same thing, only from another slightly different angle.  To me, this is tedious.  I do recommend the film however.  It is certainly worth watching.",4,A grand theme.  A grand story.

Thomas More: ""And when we die, and you are sent to Heaven for doing your conscience and I am sent to Hell for not doing mine, Will you come with me then, for fellowship?"" What More WON""T do for fellowship, or anything else, is put his stamp of approval on King Henry VIII's divorce of Katharine of Aragon, marriage to Ann Boleyn, and declaration of himself as Head of the Church of England.Times are difficult in England. There is intrigue everywhere, as overreaching men seek to take advantage of the new world order to settle some old scores and climb over the graves if necessary of those they help to depose. Thomas More (Paul Scofield) is an honest judge who becomes Chancellor of England on the death of Cardinal Woolsey (Orson Welles). Woolsey has tried in vain to secure an annullment of Henry's first marriage from the Pope, and narrowly escaped death in the Tower by simply up and dying anyway. It isn't long before More's ethics and honor are tested by the King himself (Robert Shaw) and found maddeningly disappointing for that monarch. More tries to find his refuge in silence, neither affirming nor denying the king's right to his actions. But in the turmoil surrounding the break with Rome, More gets dragged in to the Tower and then to trial for his refusal to climb on the bandwagon, so to speak.Paul Scofield does a wonderful job as Sir Thomas More, and one wonders why his career, at least in America, didn't take off: he's great and he won an Oscar to boot, yet he didn't become an Olivier, or what we would have today in Hopkins. Wendy Hiller turns in a fussy performance as More's nonunderstanding wife. She loves her husband, but is deeply resentful over his decision to go all the way with his moral stance. Susannah York plays More's feisty daughter Margaret, an unusually well educated lass who rattles off Latin effortlessly when the King deigns to quiz her on his visit to Chelsea. Our villains are excellent, notably Leo McKern as the crafty Cromwell, who starts as Secretary to Woolsey and works his way up to a position of supreme power, and John Hurt as the sycophantic Richard Rich, who More fatally befriended just before the movie's start. And Orson Welles? Rather like his turn in ""The Third Man"", Welles has one real scene, but makes the most of all his vocal tricks and alternately sly and lazy glances when at the movie's outset he tries to intimidate More into aligning himself with the coming world order.""A Man for All Seasons"" is a fine film, and well deserving of its Oscars and fame.

There are a few different versions of this film. Despite Charlton Heston being a terrific actor in the 1988 version, Paul Scofield really nails it here. He portrays Sir Thomas More splendidly as we see his battles with his conscience, his king and his country. Thomas More stands up to the king who wanted a divorce in order to remarry and changed the state and church in the process. Robert Shaw is terrific as Henry VIII while Orson Welles is solid as Cardinal Woolsey. While More wasn't perfect, to be executed for his non-crime was an abomination of the worst kind. Sir Thomas was also canonized a Saint by the Catholic Church. Thomas More was a legendary man known for his intelligence, his faith, his honesty and his upstanding moral values.

Locked in the Tower of London and ultimately deprived even of books to read, Sir Thomas refuses to relent, ultimately paying for his principles with his life.

456184,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,6305252564,"Maine Writer ""David""","[10, 36]","Who is Sir/Saint Thomas More?  Or better yet, what?  As depicted here, he is an odd mix of hero and stooge, wise man and pedant.  That artful mix is the strength of this story of the life of a remarkably intelligent and, in his own, bent way, couragious man.  For, if nothing else, More had the fortitude to give his life for his beliefs, even if those beliefs were inexplicably odd.The story is told against the backdrop of a corrupt Roman Catholic church, and a corrupt king, Henry XIII.  Henry, mad, passionate, and lecherous by turn, enters the story as a man without an heir, and interested in dumping his queen for a woman who can produce the next king.  The Pope, leader of a corrupt legion of priests, bishops, and cardinals who have more carnal than knowledge, stands firm that no divorce will be allowed, and thus no remarriage.  As we meet More, it appears that without his participation to one degree or another, Henry will not be able to switch wives as he had planned.  There is a bit of confusion here as Henry at first seeks an annulment, it appears, and then later seeks to gain the blessing of More that his marriage ought to be treated as void ab initio.  In any event, the Pope ultimately says no to Henry's plans, and then the pressure is on More, a dear friend of the looney king, to find a way out.  More refuses to do anything which might conflict with the will of the Pope, and thus the battle is joined--either More will side with Henry, at the expense of Rome, or he will stand firm with the Pope--putting everything he knows and loves at risk.Here's the ultimate problem--one with the story as much as the film.  For as bright and honorable as More might be, his honor leads him to support a church that is corrupt to its core.  It also leads him to be intellectually and emotionally brutish and self-deceptive by turns.  Certainly, he was a man of principle, but to what end?  There is much to admire in him, but just as much to leave you shaking your head and wondering whether he was just a smart guy with a martyrdom complex.This movie has some beautiful cinematography, and some nice acting turns, including by Scofield, who won an Oscar for portraying More.  Orson Welles looks like a bloated corpse, but nonetheless provides an nice performance as a thoroughly corrupt Cardinal who is perplexed by More's decision to allow something as silly as private morality guide his public acts.  In this regard, it is an especially timely commentary on a church which seems to have changed very little in 500 years.",3,"Some strong performances and ideas, but thin.",1035072000,"10 20, 2002",2002,2540,"['Who', 'Sir/Saint', 'Thomas', 'More', 'better', 'yet', 'what', 'depicted', 'here', 'odd', 'mix', 'hero', 'stooge', 'wise', 'man', 'pedant', 'artful', 'mix', 'strength', 'story', 'life', 'remarkably', 'intelligent', 'own', 'bent', 'way', 'couragious', 'man', 'nothing', 'else', 'More', 'had', 'fortitude', 'give', 'life', 'beliefs', 'even', 'beliefs', 'were', 'inexplicably', 'odd.The', 'story', 'told', 'backdrop', 'corrupt', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'church', 'corrupt', 'king', 'Henry', 'XIII', 'Henry', 'mad', 'passionate', 'lecherous', 'turn', 'story', 'man', 'heir', 'interested', 'dumping', 'queen', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'produce', 'next', 'king', 'Pope', 'leader', 'corrupt', 'legion', 'priests', 'bishops', 'cardinals', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'carnal', 'knowledge', 'firm', 'divorce', 'will', 'be', 'allowed', 'thus', 'remarriage', 'meet', 'More', 'participation', 'one', 'degree', 'Henry', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'switch', 'wives', 'had', 'planned', 'bit', 'confusion', 'here', 'Henry', 'first', 'annulment', 'then', 'later', 'gain', 'blessing', 'More', 'marriage', 'ought', 'be', 'treated', 'void', 'ab', 'initio', 'event', 'Pope', 'ultimately', 'Henry', 'plans', 'then', 'pressure', 'More', 'dear', 'friend', 'looney', 'king', 'find', 'way', 'More', 'refuses', 'do', 'anything', 'might', 'conflict', 'will', 'Pope', 'thus', 'battle', 'joined', 'More', 'will', 'side', 'Henry', 'expense', 'Rome', 'will', 'stand', 'firm', 'Pope', 'putting', 'everything', 'ultimate', 'problem', 'one', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'bright', 'honorable', 'More', 'might', 'be', 'honor', 'support', 'church', 'corrupt', 'core', 'also', 'be', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'brutish', 'self-deceptive', 'turns', 'Certainly', 'was', 'man', 'principle', 'what', 'end', 'much', 'admire', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'leave', 'shaking', 'head', 'wondering', 'was', 'just', 'smart', 'guy', 'martyrdom', 'complex.This', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'nice', 'acting', 'turns', 'including', 'Scofield', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portraying', 'More', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'bloated', 'corpse', 'nonetheless', 'nice', 'performance', 'thoroughly', 'corrupt', 'Cardinal', 'who', 'perplexed', 'More', 'decision', 'allow', 'something', 'as', 'silly', 'private', 'morality', 'guide', 'public', 'acts', 'regard', 'especially', 'timely', 'commentary', 'church', 'have', 'changed', 'very', 'little', '500', 'years']",N/A

You may find yourself saying ""Just compromise already! It's not like you can stop the King from getting a divorce and marrying whomever he likes anyway!""But if he did compromise he would no longer be so special as to be worth all your emotion. He must fight the King, not out of stubbornness, or arrogance. The King stands for something and must be moral. And Thomas Moore, the man, is not a puritan. He wants to appear pure before God when his time comes. Whether one believes in the after life or not is irrelevant: HE believed in it.The intelligence and goodness, the pearls of wisdom that come from this man leave you in awe. And I like the fact that him and the King are never really enemies on a personal level, it's a cold, intellectual battle that takes place. Even as Moore looses the fight, I am reminded of Churchill's quote, that when you must kill a man it doesn't hurt to be polite. Nothing personal only business, as the Godfather would say. That's politics for you...Thomas Moore the character (in this movie) makes me think of Abraham Lincoln giving a speech, as he was once described doing. The witness said that when he appeared everyone wondered what this ugly, shabby man could have to offer, what he could possibly say that was of any interest. And then he started to speak and soon after-wards everyone was thinking what a wonderful, marvelous man he was.That character sweeps me off my feet in that same way, I fall in love with the man's dignity and sheer genius.

Burgh ""mburgh""","[0, 1]","A Man for Seasons purports to be a film about the fall of Thomas More because of his adherence to principles in the face of fashionable politics, i.e McCarthyite blacklisting.  Instead of Thomas More in the dock, imagine the Hollywood 10 with Roy Cohn playing Richard Cromwell, then you get the idea. But More's true politics were closer to McCarthy than is less comfortable for Liberals (I am one) than is bearable.  Here is a man who burned people for heresy, willingly, gladly.  Here is a person who tried to hold back the English Reformation, a movement for which every American who enjoys freedom of thought, religion, press, assembly, etc, should be eternally grateful.  Well, then, celebrate a man who stuck to his principles, who did not, as Lillian Hellman put it, cut his conscious to the fashions of the season.  So, we are presented with a man whose religion was rife with brutal violence as the bastion of people who oppose any principle that denies the forward motion of the body politic.  But this movie is an artifact of the 1960's when such principles (Profiles in Courage) were all the rage.  Inasmuch as the filmmaking itself goes, it is a well-shot, wonderfully acted film, deserving the accolades heaped upon it.

What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?ROPER: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that!MORE: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!This has been quoted in numerous Blogs relative to the behavior of the current administration and the war on terror. Would the zealots among us cut down every law in the US to get at terror? I fear the counsel we would be given by this administration would be rather different from Sir Thomas' advice to his daughter's ardent suitor.But the lasting advice from this film is from one of its villains, Cromwell.""We are just the administrators,"" Cromwell tells supplicant Richard Rich, who is meeting with him secretly, desperately seeking a job. Cromwell enthralls young Rich, telling him that if the King wants to divorce his woman and marry another, it is up to the administrators to make it happen. Slowly, inevitably, Cromwell seduces Rich to betray Sir Thomas More, from whom Rich once received a gift.No matter what the King wants, Cromwell will make it legal. This sounds familiar. Who could it remind us of today? No wonder people yearn for the quiet moral rectitude of Sir Thomas More.Rich is played by a young, handsome John Hurt; Cromwell by the durable actor who played ""The Common Man"" in the play, Leo McKern.Scofield, as More, brings admirable restraint to More's uncompromising loyalty to his principles of faith. The contrast to today's champions of people of faith is most instructive. It is about Rich, who More knows is about to betray him that More has the following dialogue with Roper.MORE: There's no law against that.ROPER: There is! There's God's law.MORE: Then let God arrest him.More was incorruptible.

456197,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,6305252564,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[10, 11]","Recently I discovered that one of the most notable historical dramas of the 1960s had somehow managed to escape my eye for over thirty years. A highly honored film (winner of six Academy Awards in 1966, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor) with a wonderfully talented cast, a fantastic screenplay, and a fascinating historical figure as its subject. And yet a film I had never seen - until last week, that is, when I bought a DVD copy of it.The film: ""A Man For All Seasons,"" starring Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller, Robert Shaw, and John Hurt; directed by Fred Zinneman; and written by Robert Bolt. A wonderfully acted, historically accurate, and moving account of the life of one of the great men in English history: Sir Thomas More, English lawyer, scholar, statesman' and a victim of the wrath of King Henry VIII.""A Man For All Seasons"" is Robert Bolt's beautiful screen adaptation of his own highly successful and award winning stage play of the same name. It's a reasonably accurate accounting of the events of the last years of Sir Thomas More's life. Our story begins with Sir Thomas being summoned to court by the fat and aging Cardinal Wolsey (played by Orson Welles), then Chancellor of England. More must answer for his opposition to Henry's proposed divorce and remarriage.King Henry VIII especially wants Sir Thomas's approval for his divorce and marriage. The royal court now begins a zealous campaign to get More to change his mind. Thomas Cromwell (played by Leo McKern, of Masterpiece Theater's ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" fame), one of the King's secretaries, attempts to pressure More through trumped up charges of bribery. Sir Thomas is repeatedly summoned to court in the middle of the night and questioned about his beliefs. Even Sir Thomas's closest friend, the Duke of Norfolk, (played by Nigel Davenport) attempts to convince Sir Thomas to acquiesce. Finally, Parliament passes an act requiring all Englishmen to take an oath of loyalty to the King ""as head of the church in England."" But Sir Thomas More stands fast upon his principles. He will not budge.The rest is history. Watch the film to see with what great dignity and honor Sir Thomas More confronts his accusers and, ultimately, death itself.""A Man For All Seasons"" is one of the finest historical dramas I've ever seen. The acting is simply superb throughout. Paul Scofield imbues the character of Sir Thomas More with just the right amount of pious reserve combined with a self-assured, keen intellect. Robert Shaw brings a slim, youthful, and uncouth vigor to the part of Henry VIII. It was easy for me to imagine Henry just as he was portrayed by Shaw. And Leo McKern is deliciously malevolent as the sycophantic, insidiously conspirational Thomas Cromwell.Robert Bolt's Academy Award-winning screenplay fairly crackles throughout the movie's two hour running time. Although there's precious little action, the dialogue is brisk and commands the viewer's attention. It's beautifully eloquent as well.""A Man For All Seasons"" is a historical drama with a deeper message: how do we human beings reconcile our core values and principles with outward pressures to conform to society's rules? In Sir Thomas More's case, we find a deeply religious man confronted with the greatest dilemma of his life. All his life he's been taught to be loyal to both his God and to his King. Until Henry's divorce and remarriage, it seemed that these two loyalties were completely compatible. Yet, when they came into conflict, More made an choice that seemed relatively easy. His faith in God, always unshakable, took primacy over the demands of his King.When put to the test, first choices - especially when they're easy on the surface - frequently become the source of our greatest trials. This was never more true than for Sir Thomas More! Unremitting pressure was placed on him to cease opposition to the King. He was deprived of his wealth; held up to public ridicule; falsely accused of wrongdoing; and imprisoned for his beliefs. While in prison, he was deprived of his books, pen, and paper. His family importuned him to change his mind. Yet this tower of integrity never wavered from what he knew was the correct course of action. Even his words to his executioner were those of a man steadfast in his values and principles.Great lessons, these - especially nowadays, when our values and principles seem all too easily compromised by a society that demands that we ""fit in,"" ""look good,"" and ""be cool."" Yet, as ""A Man For All Seasons"" so eloquently teaches us, there have been, down through history, men and women who have served to remind us of that higher call to follow a deeper, more noble set of values and principles.People like Sir Thomas More - scholar, statesman, and martyr to his faith.",5,"""Ever after thy calm look I for no storm.""",1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,4786,"['Recently',

I would give the Devil the benefit of the doubt for  my own safety's sake.&quot;  Sir  Thomas More in A Man For All SeasonsThere is trouble in the court of  King Henry VIII. From the Dukes all the way down to the henchmen, there is  an unease in the air. For the King has decided to defy the Pope(whom he has  symbolically demoted by reffering to him as the Bishop of Rome). His wishes  for a divorce from his barren wife to marry another have been rejected, and  for that he has decided to cut out Rome and appoint himself the Head of The  Church of England. He expects to be opposed by the Bishops, but they are  bought off with the grand sum of 100,000 Pounds. But like a thorn in his  side, there is Thomas More, the newly appointed Lord Chancellor of The  Realm, a man of impeccable reputation, who refuses to support him, yet  refrains from condemning him.It is puzzles me how every review of Man  For All Seasons paints More(Paul Scofield) as a the man who protests  against the crown. The reviews make him sound like a self rightious, short  sighted man who knows nothing of the world. Thomas More is sly in his  virtue, he understands that speaking out would be treason. He does not  protest England's corruption, but the Crown's attempt to corrupt him. He  would have been quietly satisfied had they let him resign his post and live  out his days reading and writing. It his curse that his King respects him,  and while the King's advisors plot to make More bow in fear that England's  European neighbors would question the power of the monarchy, the King  reasons are merely suggested, and they are Freudian in nature.As  King Henry VIII, Robert Shaw appears in only two scenes in the entire  film(approximatly 7 minutes in a 120 minute film). Yet his electric  performance garnered him an Oscar nomination, capably transforming from  rage to exuberance to mockery to gentleness and back again in a space of  seconds. He leaves such a strong impression that his bizzare moodiness is  present even when he's off screen. A complex man, Henry VIII composed  music, wrote theological works and displayed an apparent lust for life. His  obsession with More's approval is what Frued called the &quot;Madonna-whore  complex&quot; in reference to men losing their respect for women they have  already had. In an obviously non-sexual way, King Henry would have probably  lost his respect for Thomas had he bowed down to him and broken his  silence. The King seeks the approval of a man he admires, yet had he gotten  that approval, he would no longer admire him.  Fred Zinnemann(who  has recieved 9 Oscar nominations from 22 feature films) directs with his  usual unfussy camera work. While this technique has dated his thriller The  Day of The Jackal, its helps this film immeasurably. It allows us to stand  back and savor the incredible sets, the glistening costumes and most of all  Robert Bolt's incredibly literate dialogue. The first time I watched Man  For All Seasons was yesterday and I watched it again that very day just to  unravel the beautiful dialogue. And the standard of acting is so high that  this language never feels recited.At the center of A Man For All  Seasons is Paul Scofield's richly textured and deeply felt performance as  More. Through out the film he will remain eloquent. But behind his mask of  humility builds a rage. That is why when he breaks down, it is so  incredibly moving. He does not require the country to live by God's law, as  long as they let him do so. He is a man of the world who understands how  hazy morality can be. He never compromises his King, even in the blackest  of moments. But when the King chooses to compromise him, he forsakes this  world for another.

This is a powerful closet drama, full of finely wrought performances. Orson Welles is really something in his cameo as Cardinal Wolsey.  Wendy Hiller plays Sir Thomas? dutiful, though forthright wife.  Leo McKern is brilliant as the self-satisfying jackal of destruction, Thomas Cromwell.

456207,A33TBHM3O9AY17,6305252564,No one of consequence,"[11, 11]","This film portrays the sixteenth century life and death of Sir Thomas More, a prominent member of the court of English king Henry VIII.  Grounded in historical fact, this movie vividly tells the story of More's stand against the king's betrayal of the law of God -- a stand which ultimately would cost Thomas his head.When the Catholic king Henry VIII sought to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, so he could instead marry Anne Boleyn, his will was opposed by the Roman papacy as being repugnant to the clear teachings of scripture.  Rather than submit to the law of God, Henry chose to rebel by having Parliament pass a law to establish the Church of England and declare Henry the head of it.  In order to legitimize his claim to this new title, however, Henry needed the support of his members of state, not the least of which was Thomas More.When presented with the king's demand to sign an oath declaring the king's rightful claim to the headship of the new Church of England, Thomas demurred but refused to state his reason for so doing.  He sought protection in his silence, knowing that his refusal to sign would likely be viewed as treason, but that treason must be proved by evidence -- and he intended to give them none.In a brilliant performance, Paul Scofield depicts Thomas in his steadfast assertion of integrity and conscience toward the law of his God.  His chief accusers, namely Lords Cromwell, Norfolk, and Rich, are repeatedly confounded at Thomas' evasion of their clever snares and manipulations, designed at first to gain More's cooperation but later to get him to incriminate himself.  Cromwell and the others ultimately are forced to resort to perjury, corruption, and a kangaroo court to ""convict"" Thomas of the crime of high treason, and to eliminate him as the last obstacle to king Henry's ambitions.Overall I thought this movie was very well done, with top notch acting and a well developed narrative.  The message is unmistakable -- that in an age of moral and ethical relativism, sometimes one must gamble all, even one's life, to cling to integrity -- and ultimately one's own soul.  This parable is sorely needed in our own day.

Even better than the one that was presented in movie theaters in the late sixties.The picture is vivid as if it had been filmed yesterday. Colors are bright and well-balanced as they were intended when first filmed.The sound is exceptional. It has been turned into a full-fledged Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Stereo sound and this is spectacular, given that the short music passages, as well as the Main and End Titles composed by Georges Delerue, truly come to new life and become very imposing and plastic to the ear.The effects are crisp and steps along long corridors at Hampton Court, have a threatening qualities. The Royal Barge that takes Henry VIII to pay a visit to Sir Thomas More's Mansion, ""swishes"" on the water majestically, and you can even listen as the oars immerse and emerge in rhythm from the water. This is imposing indeed.Now the dialogues are ""located"" and come to full life.The cast is simply majestic.Paul Scofield as Thomas More is unforgettable and to this day, this is his role.Wendy Hiller, as his wife, moves us to tears and laughter in her brief moments.Orson Welles, as Cardinal Wolsey, is ""Imperial"" and menacing.John Colicos, as Cromwell, is as devious and lethal as the methods he uses to ""convince"" people to talk.John Hurt, in one of his first roles, as Richard Rich, plays an upstart beautifully.Susannah York, as one of Thomas More's daughters, shines in all her youth and freshness, as well as brightness.And finally, the best for last, the great Robert Shaw, as a memorable King Henry VIII, the subject of the entire movie, but who only appears in just a few scenes.Those were still the years, the mid-sixties, when movies were still made by artists, true artists, and not just by mere technocrats.This was still a time, when a story well told, was far better valued than all the circus of special effects of today's pictures, which almost always serve only one purpose, to cover either bad acting or at best, weak actors, attempting to deliver weak and meaningless lines.You also had the very best of stage actors, appearing in movies as well, proving that not only they could act on a live stage, but that they could adapt their acting for the camera as well.There were giants among them, and to this day, they remain as such, never having been truly substituted by anybody and this makes them true legends.In this movie, you get a sample of living legends acting just for you, in one of the best written modern period epics ever.Highly recommended for the entire family.

But the story of Thomas More, at least as portrayed here in Robert Bolt's Oscar-winning screenplay, is the story of a true martyr: Someone who is willing sacrifice everything he holds dear, including his life - and no one else's - in order to stand for a principle of faith. More was declared Chancellor of England in 1529 by none other than King Henry VIII. Henry (Robert Shaw, in his first major role) wanted to divorce his wife and marry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave, in a stunning cameo), but the Roman Church, headed by Pope Clement VII, refused his request. Henry wanted More's support in his effort to father an heir to his throne, but when More refused, the king imprisoned him and eventually had him beheaded. Fred Zinnemann's direction is incredibly skilled. Under it, Paul Scofield won Best Actor for portraying this historical figure with great dignity and a surprising amount of wit. Agree or disagree with More's moral position, he's undeniably and non-violently heroic in defense of his religious conviction. At one point, More discovers he has been betrayed by Richard Rich (a young John Hurt), a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; who has been appointed Regent of Wales, essentially as a reward for his treachery. ""Richard,"" Moore says soulfully, ""it profits a man not if he gains the whole world but loses his immortal soul - but for Wales?""

456212,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,6305252564,"Phred ""Phred""","[2, 2]","A man for all Seasons is a thoughtful movie backed with cast of great acting. The writing is such that there is no real battle for the high ground. Sir Thomas is alone in holding moral standing. His opposition is not going to announce that they are without ideals, but their performances tells you all you need to know about motives and self-image.As such I was first taken by the performances of the villains. Orson Wells as the dying, world wise and world weary Cardinal Wolsey instantly establishes himself as a man who has compromised everything and is too tired to fake otherwise. Camera angles and lighting contribute in making him appear as reptilian and dangerous. This camera angle for his death scene is perhaps too over done, but is the only such failure, if failure it be.Leo McKern  as Cromwell, an over reaching, overly confident ""administrator"" is clearly Moore's inferior in everything except his willingness to do what it takes to gain personal power or preference. McKern handles the exercise of bureaucratic power as naturally as he will later mock that power as Rumpole of the Bailey.Perhaps the weakest performance is that of Robert Shaw as King Henry VIII. Between the writing and the directing, the King is played as a distracted artist, what we would now call a victim of Adult Attention Deficit Disorder, rather than an otherwise respected King with a very real awareness of the violence his country had suffered during the War of the Roses. Hence is was for him a matter of national priority to insure his dynastic line.Against these forces we have a loyal Lady Alice Moore ably played by Wendy Hiller, a no-nonsense, love her man even as you challenge him wife. A young Susannah York plays the well-educated and clever daughter, Margret.There are a few others, but the point is that the movie is Thomas Moore versus all comers.Paul Scofield at once looks the part and plays his man. The movie pivots around this portrayal and Scofield delivers. Moore is a lawyer. His defense is a lawyer's defense.  He will make no public statement, not even to his wife on the subject of his king's decision to become head of the Church of England and Henry's decision to divorce his wife in favor of Ann Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave, only just barely present but played as a sensual if somewhat surprised mistress turned Queen).It is the fate of Sir Thomas to be depend on a technicality of the law, before a court that has been engineered to ignore it. There is no surprise ending. You see the ending before you see the movie. Your motive for seeing the movie is not to learn what is going to happen, but to judge for yourself the integrity of the man versus the cruelty of the system. This brings us to the most deliberate weakness of the movie. Why does the King choose to continue his vendetta against this man? If you listen carefully to the features added to the movie, you will have an idea. If you only watch the movie the need to go after Sir Thomas even after years (over 10) have passed in never discussed.Pay attention to the directing and camera work. Every return to Moore's estate is a return to the light. Every arrival or departure from London is in the dark.  King Henry is afforded light, but he is not portrayed as a force or a player. Things are done in his name, but he is seen as too light to carry any serious contribution to the movie. Cromwell, Wolsey, the Knighted Sir Richard Rich are creatures of the dark. The Duke of Norfolk, being a man who comprehends little and represents less , moves between light and dark while carrying his own personal confusions.Granting the several weaknesses of A Man for all Season -most are deliberate, being tied to the purposes of the author and the time limits of the media - this is a 5 star performance.

When it came to the screen, Fred Zinneman had the good sense to bring the man who played Sir Thomas More on stage, Paul Scofield, along for the movie.  Mr. Scofield doesn't merely act the part, he becomes Sir Thomas, the man who wrote Utopia.  Sir Thomas is  a close friend to King Henry VIII and when the King wants a divorce, he breaks away from the church and starts the Church of England.  Sir Thomas will not recognize this schism and backs the church.  This leads to his jailing and eventual death.  This is a bitter pill for the King to swallow as he dearly loves Thomas, but he feels that duty to the King is paramount to everything.  Sir Thomas believes he must serve God first.  The movie is a morality play and we are drawn into the pain that both Thomas Henry feel.  Henry is played with the right of amount of bluster and zest by Robert Shaw (who received his only Academy Award nomination for the role).  Wendy Hiller portrays Sir Thomas' wife with compassion and understanding of a man who is willing give his life for his beliefs.  Susannah York is his daughter, a young John Hurt plays the traitorous Richard Rich and Orson Wells has a cameo as a Cardinal.  Mr. Scofield won the Best Actor Oscar and the film took the Best Picture prize.

I don't think I've seen that for any other film!The story is true, it is important, it is as relevant to today as it was when it unfolded.  It is beautiful, powerfully portrayed, without cinematic excesses that would detract us from the tale.  People mentioned the score and I have no memory of hearing music, which I take as a good thing.  So often we're manipulated into feeling one way or another by the music but this doesn't do that.  I read that the film was made on an amazingly frugal budget but nothing in it is cheap...it's all superb...which is a tribute to Thomas More, a man for whom nothing was cheap.The cast is first rate.  English actors are sooo good.  The young beautiful Susanna York comes up with such deep chest tones at times when she is being really serious...very impressive for such a small person.  Robert Shaw gave a terrific performance as Henry VIII, here seen as the bon vivant, the man who loves music, composes it himself, extolls on the beauty of the summer night and the white lilac bush and of course, loves the ladies. His affection and admiration for More seem genuine.  From his point of view, it's imperative to have a male heir and so he had to do what he had to do.  He gives us lots of hearty laughter, which is erie when we consider the actions he took later in the story.  Henry is conspicuously out of sight for the final portion of the film, his orders  being carried out by his lackeys.I kept watching for John Hurd and did not recognize him as the evil young Rich until the final credits rolled. He does the job just right, expressing perfectly the callowness of such a type. He makes your flesh creep when you see him in his fancy dress, lying, in the final courtroom scene.  More's comment to him, that he gave up his soul....for Wales?...is priceless.Best of all was Paul Scofield in the performance of a lifetime.  I'm so glad he got the Oscar!  His Thomas ran the gamut of touchingly tender, with his wife and especially his daughter, to amazing powerful as he almost screams out his final speech in court.  Wow!  Bring Kleenex.Some of the information about Thomas More given by other reviewers---that he caused a few heads to roll, himself,  over religious principles---makes me realize that this version of the man may well have been over idealized.  However  I'll leave that discussion for others.

Robert Bolt has given us two masterpieces, which have not been surpassed. The movie of the life of St. Thomas More is both realistic and moving. The key theme in the movie for me is the fact that More is not a stereotypical martyr. He unsuccessfuly attempts to avoid dying for his faith. He states ""This is not the stuff that martyrs are made of"". He believes that he is not strong enough to die for the faith. He eventually does receive that strength, but not before winning his wife and her blessings over.The movie, even without its rich intellectual dialogue, can serve as a reminder of what the average person can achieve if they maintain their integrity.Columbia always does a fine job with the picture quality of its movie releases.  The picture quality of ""A Man For All Seasons"" is no exception. The soundtrack however is 2.0 mono. I really do not have a problem with the mono soundtrack (after all nobody watches ""A Man for All Seasons"" for its sound effects!)

I was a senior in high school, and since this was the pre-hippie era, everyone was gung-ho about Sir Thomas More's duty, integrity, etc. There's no question that Fred Zinnemann crafted a masterpiece on the tiny budget allowed him by Columbia, since all the studios were losing money on talky, period pieces.The acting is incomparable, a perfect ensemble centering around the unflinchingly confident performance of Scofield (he'd done the role hundreds of times on stage). The costumes won an Oscar, and were certainly beautiful, though they were so bulky it looked really difficult for the characters to get close to each other. It won an Oscar for Cinematography, too, though the film really is somewhat of a filmed play (I thought the filming of &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;,also nominated, was more breath-taking). Though these are minor problems, they are soon forgotten when one pays attention to the incredible screenplay of Robert Bolt.Loaded with passion and strong character development, it's also a valid history lesson. Don't watch this if there are any distractions (kids, company, etc.) since its maximum appreciation requires concentration. I'm also wondering why the DVD is substantially higher-priced than most others, since there are absolutely NO extras of any kind.

456226,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6305252564,Robert Morris,"[13, 13]","This period in English history and then the Elizabethan era which follows have always interested me. You thus can understand my appreciation of Derek Wilson's book In the Lion's Court: Power, Ambition, and Sudden Death in the Reign of Henry VIIII. Wilson focuses his primary attention on six Thomases: Wolsey, More, Cromwell, Howard, Wriothesley, and Cramner. Henry's VIII's relationships with all six serve as the basis of Wilson's narrative. By the way, there really were lions in London at that time (&quot;the King's Beasts&quot;) housed in the Tower menagerie and a major tourist attraction. More once compared the king's court to a lion pit &quot;in which the magnificent and deadly king of beasts held sway.&quot; Of the six, More interests me the most. His rectitude threatens and infuriates Henry, and eventually results in More's execution. Thus presented, More is a tragic but noble political victim and religious martyr, later canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. He is no less admirable as portrayed by Wilson but, in my opinion, is much more complicated than Bolt and others suggest. For years, More skillfully navigated his way through a court (&quot;a lion pit&quot;) characterized by what Wilson refers to as its &quot;seamy realities&quot;: &quot;The royal entourage was a vicious, squirming world of competing ambitions and petty feuds, guilty secrets and salacious prudery. Courtiers, vulnerable to threats and bribes, could be induced to perjure themselves, to exaggerate amorous incidents which were innocent in the context of stylised chivalric convention, to indulge personal vendettas....Over all these momentous happenings looms the larger-than-life figure of Henry VIII, powerful and capricious yet always an enigma.&quot;People still disagree about Robert Bolt's characterization of More in the play and then in the film for which Bolt received an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay. I agree with others who insist that More was less noble than Bolt suggests. No one, however, disputes the fact that More courageously accepted decapitation rather than compromise his religious faith. Cynics suggest that More was already a dead man...and knew it. He had an estate to protect and family obligations to accommodate. I am unqualified to speculate or even comment further on More's motives even as I marvel at his survival skills when drawn into &quot;the lion's court.&quot;Paul Scofield received and deserved his Academy Award for best actor in a leading role. The film and director Fred Zimmermann also received Academy Awards. The cast is exceptionally talented, especially Nigel Davenport (Duke of Norfolk), Wendy Hiller (Alice Cromwell), John Hurt (Richard Rich), Leo McKern (Thomas Cromwell), Vanessa Redgrave (Ann Boleyn), Robert Shaw (Henry VIII), Orson Welles (Cardinal Wolsey), and Susannah York (Margaret More). Unlike many stage productions later filmed, this one derives substantial benefit from Ted Moore's cinematography, especially the exteriors shot throughout and beyond royal residences. Moore also received an Academy Award for his work.Those with an especially keen interest may wish to examine The Last Letters of Thomas More as well as several solid biographies of him by Peter Ackroyd, J.A.

Paul Scofield as Sir Thomas More creates an indelible impression on you and makes you want to be a better person. He is, as another reviewer put it, a man of quiet dignity and conviction.  What I admired about the portrayal though is he is not maudlin or a man that willingly marched to the executioner with a holy glow about his head.  He was crafty and maneuvered for years to avoid having his head lopped off. He was an intellectual and a religious man. All to rare combination in his time and ours. When people discuss Thomas More, they think of him as a man who stood by his convictions regardless of the cost. But really he wouldn't tell anyone what his convictions were! It was actually this that cost him his life. Its a very peculiar thing when I think of this movie's title.  More was a religious man to be sure and many religious people find strength in this film.  But the title of this film is so apt because anyone can admire Thomas More regardless of what they think of what he was fighting for. After the film is over and I think to myself, I realize I don't even agree with him.  But the way he comports himself and handles each encounter with grace and subtlety you just wish you could have such a nimble wit and strength of character.  He represents something heroic people want to embody. This abstract case is what makes the movie timeless, and one whose message will continue to resonate even another fifty years from now. Paul Scofield turns in one of the great male acting performances of all time. Scofield brings Thomas More to life in a way its hard for me to take in that he is playing a role. I come away from the film unwilling to imagine Thomas More was probably less perfect than the man we see on the screen. Scofield has created an iconic vision of More that will persist regardless of the realities of the flesh and blood man.I think aside from All About Eve, only A Man for All Seasons has won all the Academy awards in the major catagories. It could not win best actress because there was no female lead. But garnered Best Picture,Director, Actor and both actor and actress supporting roles.  It also won Best Cinematography, costume design and writing awards.

His words ""I die the King's good servant, but God's first"" is perfect, as are his morals and reasoning for his stand and his belief to die for what he believes in, above all other earthly considerations, including his family. Sir Thomas More really was exceptional in his day, and in any day, and unusual in the depth and absolute certainty in his convictions. Robert Shaw makes a perfect Henry VIII, and there is a wonderful scene of Henry arriving in his Royal barge, to the estate of More, and jumping from the boat into the muddy water and laughing uproariously and with great delight; you can SEE the real Henry doing the same thing. There was a deep affection and respect for More, from Henry, and after More was executed, he reproached Anne Boleyn with great vehemence hissing to her:""It is because of you that the bestest man in my Kingdom is dead."" (Anne's fate was later sealed by her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, who erroneously told her Henry had suffered a fatal fall from his horse while hunting, causing her to miscarry the male heir which may have prevented her execution...he also testified against her at her ""trial."") Richard Rich, the worst of the worst and the very antithesis of More's character, wound up with a great deal of wealth, and died of old age, peacefully in his bed...so much for Karma.

The anguish on Scofield's face when he saw his family, in the Tower, for the last time, is unforgettable, and the pain and anger from Wendy Hiller, as his wife, is heartfelt. Scofield's face and emotions are so plain and honest and true throughout the entire production, is a tribute to Sir Thomas More, and represents what the real man must have endured and the nobility of his beliefs. One envies someone with this much faith, that he is willing to lay down his own life and give up his family for them...there is a portrait of More, and if you see it, you can see this man was truly exceptional, for his or any other time...you can see it in his face.

Caught in  the swirl of shifting values arising from  the spread of Luther's  reformation and the rise of nationalism More became an anachronism within  his own lifetime.  Scofield's presentation of a man watching his  traditional world dissolve, replaced by an emerging political one is more  than compelling; it's flawless.  Scofield shows the futility of attempting  to balance canon and civil law when the state was emerging triumphant.  Cardinal Wolsey's death, in a superb cameo by Orson Welles, establishes how  much power the church wielded in the state.  Norfolk's scornful gaze  expresses the resentment many felt over the dominance of England by  Rome.Robert Shaw's Henry VIII presents the mood swings and apparent  callousness toward human values reflecting the common judgment of his reign  in traditional history.  Shaw displays a fine villain, but can touch only  lightly the complexity of Henry's position in Reformation England.  Bolt's  hagiography denies Shaw the scope he might have used in depicting Henry's  burdens.  The Tudor reign ended a long, furious civil war.  Henry VIII's  divorce was not an  issue of lust, but of providing an heir and attendant  political stability.  Henry's break with Rome flew in the face of a  millennium of European tradition.  The Papacy had the support of  the most  powerful monarch in Europe, Charles II, who would gladly have invaded  England.  However, the Lutheran Reformation kept his attention.Will  Roper's role is too weak to represent the man who penned the first  biography of More.  Roper did, indeed, pass from orthodoxy through  Lutheranism before returning to the 'true faith'.  Like More, he was caught  up in circumstances he couldn't comprehend.  His confusion expresses what  England went through over religion in those years.If we have a saint,  there must be a sinner for contrast.  Bolt tries to make Henry More's foil,  but Leo McKern's stunning performance as Thomas Cromwell walks away with  the job.  We  don't know if Cromwell initiated the break with Rome, but  once the process began, he followed through with enthusiasm.  McKern  vividly portrays a man of the new age, seeking power not for himself, but  for the State.  Coldly dispassionate in his role, McKern shows how inept  the Academy Awards folk are having overlooked his performance.  Without  detracting from either Scofield or Shaw, it's McKern who captures attention  with his demonstration of a man of the 'new age'  [for contrast, see him in  the Beatles 'Help!'].This film is a timeless classic.  No other  depiction of More or Henry has matched it.  Put it on your shelf next to  'The Lion in Winter' for a comparison of royal prerogative.  Both Henrys  had laymen as their most powerful Chancellor.  Both Henrys killed both  Thomases.

In the time of King Henry VIII, Henry's divorce caused a major rift between church and state that redefined the political landscape in Europe.  Fred Zinnemann's ""A Man for All Seasons"" chronicles this event and captures all the moral and practical dueling that took place in the wake of one monarch's desire to move onto a new wife.King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) desperately wants to marry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave) so that he can sire a male heir.  When the Chancellor of England, Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield), refuses to support the King's divorce from his current wife, Henry turns his back on Rome and the Pope and appoints himself as the head of the Church of England.  Troubled by this wanton disregard of the law, More refuses to publicly acknowledge King Henry in his new position.  His stubbornness to stick to his morals eventually leads to his imprisonment and eventual execution.""A Man for All Seasons"" plays like a film out of time.  Its strong honorable message seems dated in a contemporary society where role models are scarcer than ever.  Yet it still remains an inspiring story that reminds us of how noble the human spirit can be when it does not buckle under the pressures of morally-dubious forces.  The performances in the film from top to bottom are outstanding.  Scofield richly deserved his Best Actor Oscar and Shaw shines in his role as Henry.  Leo McKern, John Hurt, Orson Welles, Susannah York also turn in strong work with York being particularly effective as More's headstrong yet devoted daughter.

On the plus side, the picture and audio (now in a 5.1 mix) are sharper here, with stronger color saturations and clearer dialogue than the older release. It's only a slight improvement, but quite noticeable when you play both discs side-by-side. I also like the little documentary on Sir Thomas More produced for the special edition, as it includes some intelligent interviews with scholars and a bit of insight into the history portrayed on film. On the neutral side, this new disc is one-sided, unlike the older release which had a full-screen version on one side and widescreen on the other. In a post-HD and post-BluRay world, I really don't see any point to owning a full-screen DVD, although I suppose some people may still desire such. Finally, on the negative side, the special edition is dual-layered whereas the original release was presented in a hearty single-layer format (i.e. less likely to ""stick"" or freeze while playing) that had better artwork and a nice fold-out insert with chapter listings and liner notes. Also, it's disappointing that the Special Edition does not include the theatrical re-release trailer that was on the original disc, but instead includes several trailers for similar historical epics like ""Cromwell."" The whole point of owning a DVD (particularly today when you can call up just about any movie on Netflix) is to get some special features like the original theatrical trailer that you will not find elsewhere. It seems movie companies are now loading their DVDs with trailers for other movies as we used to see on VHS tapes. In any event, the film itself remains great, a tale of conscience featuring a Catholic saint whose story holds universal appeal -- even to agnostic playwright Robert Bolt, who adapted this screenplay from his stage play of the same name.

He refuses to take a side, publicly, but everyone in the nation knows he opposes King Henry's decision to break with the Pope so that he can marry another wife. How More (Paul Schofield) tries to stay alive via a silence that shouts a rebuke makes for compelling drama. A young Robert Shaw does a flamboyant and wonderful job as King Henry, but then, the entire supporting cast, as is common in British productions, is great. Faith and greed, power and the loss of it, survival and sacrifice...all are elements of this fine film.",5,Powerful intellectual and ethical exercise...,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,765,"['one', 'favorite', 'films', ""'60"", 'saw', 'superb', 'stage', 'production', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'years', 'film', 'version', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'chancellor', 'England', 'asked', 'choose', 'King', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'take', 'side', 'publicly', 'everyone', 'nation', 'King', 'Henry', 'decision', 'break', 'Pope', 'can', 'marry', 'wife', 'How', 'More', 'Paul', 'Schofield', 'stay', 'alive', 'silence', 'rebuke', 'compelling', 'drama', 'young', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'flamboyant', 'wonderful', 'job', 'King', 'Henry', 'then', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'common', 'British', 'productions', 'great', 'Faith', 'greed', 'power', 'loss', 'survival', 'sacrifice', 'are', 'elements', 'fine', 'film']",N/A

This movie is a fine shot in the arm for Robert Bolt and his play.But also, as one reviewer put it, it is a trifle boring.  I would probalby just say it was a little cold and distant.I think Zinneman should have gotten over his abhorence of film scores, and allowed his composer, no less than Georges Delerue, to add a touch of feeling to the score.This is, a motion picture.  Not a play.  Not a book.  A movie.This very fine screenplay and very fine acting are all to the good however. Watch it and enjoy.

Houghton,"[10, 10]","Paul Scofield's quiet, dignified portrayl of Sir Thomas More is one of the most riveting performances one will ever find.With a determined, yet not brash or unseemly stance against Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in all his young glory), More creates a devastating question for the viewer:  how long do our principles remain dear to us.  To discomfort?  To imprisonment?  To death?Perhaps one of the most endearing qualities of More's character is that he does not waver.  It is a quality that is only universal in the sense that it is respected by all men and possessed by very few.In the end, perhaps the only validation More is given is the dignity of his death, his detractors exposed as dishonest, biased men.  Is that enough?  Certainly More was able to change little of history by the manner of his death.  It did not stop the divorce OR the Anglican church.  Perhaps the only prize integrity has is itself.  Certainly More himself believed a much higher reward awaited him.  After watching this movie, regardless of religion, you will find yourself hoping he was right.",5,"&quot;Seasons&quot; offers poignancy, pause",1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,1070,"['Paul', 'Scofield', 'quiet', 'dignified', 'portrayl', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'one', 'most', 'riveting', 'performances', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'find.With', 'determined', 'yet', 'not', 'brash', 'unseemly', 'stance', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'young', 'glory', 'More', 'devastating', 'question', 'viewer', 'how', 'long', 'do', 'principles', 'remain', 'dear', 'discomfort', 'imprisonment', 'death', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'More', 'character', 'not', 'waver', 'quality', 'only', 'universal', 'sense', 'respected', 'men', 'possessed', 'very', 'few.In', 'end', 'perhaps', 'only', 'validation', 'More', 'given', 'dignity', 'death', 'detractors', 'exposed', 'dishonest', 'biased', 'men', 'enough', 'Certainly', 'More', 'was', 'able', 'change', 'little', 'history', 'manner', 'death', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'divorce', 'OR', 'Anglican', 'church', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'prize', 'integrity', 'Certainly', 'More', 'believed', 'much', 'higher', 'reward', 'awaited', 'watching', 'movie', 'regardless', 'religion', 'will', 'find', 'hoping', 'was', 'right']",N/A
