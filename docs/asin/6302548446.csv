She begins the movie the young widow of a Chicago gangster. Hoping to better her life she becomes a secretary to Ian Hunter. When Henry Fonda enters the picture she elopes with him, only his father has the marriage annulled immediately. Davis goes along with it (Fonda has no backbone), only, of course, she's pregnant now and has a son. Hunter has always had a crush on her and she begs him not to tell Fonda about the boy. Fonda marries another, Hunter dies after leaving Davis a bundle of money (and his declaration of love), and she goes off to Europe and seclusion. After Fonda's wife dies, he visits Davis and their love is rekindled. The soap-opera effects are really poured on - some, such as Fonda's wife (Anita Louise) being crippled in a car accident on their honeymoon and Davis asking them to adopt her boy, are almost over-the-top in emotional force and seem to be there for no other reason.

For whatever else one might think about this film, the fact is that Bette Davis is at the top of her form in this film, and that's saying a lot.  The year after ""That Certain Woman"" Davis appeared in ""Jezebel,"" and the year after that in ""Dark Victory,"" two of her best-known performances.  She played in a raft of films in the late 30s and early 40s, and many of these films are overshadowed today by her ""greatest"" films.  But make no mistake about it: each of her performances in these years is among the finest in the history of cinematography.  Very few actresses can express the full spectrum of human emotion, from the ecstatic heights of being in love to the bathos of lost love (and everything inbetween), that Davis brings to this film.  And, as often as not, she does it without uttering a single word.  Watch her face register emotion, watch those emotions take flight and swirl and soar before your very eyes.  You are watching one of the greatest actresses of the 20th century (indeed, of any century), in a performance that is unforgettable.  Whether one loves this film or not (I, for one, do love it!), Davis' performance is exhilarating, masterful, and unrivalled.  Be thankful that through modern technology we can experience the wonder and the magic, and yes the genius, of this bravura performance, an extraordinary portrayal filmed on the cinematic stage before most of us were even born.",5,Davis at the top of her form,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,1534,"['do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'poor', 'ratings', 'film', 'received', 'remain', 'unchallenged', 'else', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'film', 'fact', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'top', 'form', 'film', 'saying', 'lot', 'year', 'Certain', 'Woman', 'Davis', 'appeared', 'Jezebel', 'year', 'Dark', 'Victory', 'two', 'best-known', 'performances', 'played', 'raft', 'films', 'late', '30s', 'early', '40s', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'today', 'greatest', 'films', 'make', 'mistake', 'performances', 'years', 'finest', 'history', 'cinematography', 'Very', 'few', 'actresses', 'can', 'express', 'full', 'spectrum', 'human', 'emotion', 'ecstatic', 'heights', 'being', 'love', 'bathos', 'lost', 'love', 'everything', 'inbetween', 'Davis', 'film', 'as', 'often', 'not', 'uttering', 'single', 'word', 'Watch', 'face', 'register', 'emotion', 'watch', 'emotions', 'take', 'flight', 'swirl', 'soar', 'very', 'eyes', 'are', 'watching', 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', '20th', 'century', 'indeed', 'century', 'performance', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'do', 'love', 'Davis', 'performance', 'exhilarating', 'masterful', 'unrivalled', 'Be', 'thankful', 'modern', 'technology', 'can', 'experience', 'wonder', 'magic', 'yes', 'genius', 'bravura', 'performance', 'extraordinary', 'portrayal', 'filmed', 'cinematic', 'stage', 'most', 'were', 'even', 'born']",N/A
319670,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6302548446,Douglas M,"[12, 12]","""That Certain Woman"" is the 4th ""transitional"" film which Bette Davis made in 1937 before she hit superstardom with her Oscar winning ""Jezebel"". Davis plays Mary Donnell, a gangster's widow who falls for Henry Fonda, a rich and frivolous playboy, while she works for lawyer Ian Hunter. Everyone loves Mary except Fonda's father and the melodrama is full of absurdities as one burden is loaded on Davis's long-suffering shoulders after another. This load of emotional tripe was in fact a remake of the earlier ""The Trespasser"", a big hit for Gloria Swanson when she made the transition to talkies. Written by the director, Edmund Goulding, the film is nonsense but Davis continually rises above the material, generally underacting at times with great warmth and possibly for the first time, displaying the range and depth of her acting ability. It is a fine showcase for her burgeoning talent if you can stomach the suds. The ending is particularly ludicrous.The DVD has been issued in the Warner's Archive collection which means it is very expensive, there are no extras and no scene selection.

She falls in love with Jack (Henry Fonda), a rich man's son, and they marry. When the groom's father (Donald Crisp) finds out, Jack loses the battle with his socially prominent father, who is outraged over what he perceives to be his son's unsuitable marriage and has it annulled. It turns out, however, that Bette eventually gives birth to Jack's son, unbeknownst to Jack. Times passes, and Jack remarries a woman (Anita Louise) from his social circle.Meanwhile, Mary's married boss has fallen in love with her, but Mary refuses his overtures, remaining true to Jack, under the romantic notion that he will one day return and pick up where he left off. The years go by, before Jack discovers he has a son with Mary and is faced with making a choice he would rather not have to make.

319676,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6302548446,"""scotsladdie""","[5, 7]","La Davis plays a gangster's widow who's got a crush on rich playboy Fonda.During the decade of the 1930's, very likely the most esteemed and  versatile actress in America was a pop-eyed little dynamo by the name of  Bette Davis. This 1937 offering (which is all but forgotten) is a re-make  of a 1929 Gloria Swanson film THE TRESPASSER which was also directed by the  Englishman Edmund Goulding. Soapy as all-get-out, it's nevertheless  watchable for Davis's uncanny ability to keep the viewer mesmorized; Fonda  does well in his role (the next year he would play Pres to Bette's Julie in  her AA winning role in JEZEBEL).The final scene was a turning point in  Davis's career; for the first time she was REALLY given  &quot;star-treatment&quot; as far as being photographed. Two prime Davis  movies not yet on video include a rare comedy role: again from 1937-IT'S  LOVE I'M AFTER (with Leslie Howard and Olivia deHavilland)-it's supposedly  TERRIFIC. The other (which remains a puzzle) is her unusually literate 1943  soap opera OLD ACQUAINTANCE with her favourite female co-star (just  kidding!) Miriam  Hopkins.

319677,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,6302548446,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[0, 0]","Bette looks particularly fetching in this soapy melodrama co-starring Henry Fonda & Ian Hunter (who would star with Joan Crawford a few years later as the Christ figure in ""Strange Cargo"").The plot is a little silly but Davis's performance isn't. She gets to be tough, tender, maternal, sacrificing and bitter by turns--all rendered with a subtle hand that manages to duck the sometimes ludicrous lapses in plausibility. And of course, she also gets a chance to do her patent ""confrontation scene"" when she confronts the meddling father-in-law who has deprived her of a husband and eventually her own son as well.In the scenes where her hair is loose and long, she looks downright ravishing in a way that I don't typically associate with Bette Davis. Writer/Director Edmund Goulding was a master at creating this particular type of ""vehicle"" for women stars, in which the heroine (with no shortage of glamorous close-ups) suffers nobly, almost to the point of martyrdom, but is richly rewarded for her sacrifices in the final reel. In fact, in this one, Davis--for different reasons--refuses not one but two men who love her (and their respective fortunes), and even her own son--whom she gives to her ex-husband to raise with his new wife (wheelchair-bound, no less!). Ludicrous? Certainly. Compelling? You bet.My only complaint is that the Davis character didn't end up marrying her rich boss played by Ian Hunter. Despite Henry Fonda's larky ""good guy"" quality, Hunter's got more charisma AND more sex appeal, and his scenes with Davis crackle with all the tension that her scenes with Fonda lack. But not to worry. Bette ends up getting her son back, along with the man of her choice, and BOTH men's money.
