1515159,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B006GQQL50,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","Well, here's my rundown. &#34;Zombie Island&#34; was great. &#34;Witch's Ghost&#34; had a strong punch. &#34;Alien Invasion&#34; had some good moments. I didn't much like &#34;Cyber Chase.&#34; &#34;Legend of the Vampire&#34; was surprisingly good. &#34;Monster of Mexico&#34; had its moments. &#34;Loch Ness&#34; was interesting. &#34;Aloha&#34; and &#34;Where's My Mummy&#34; had their moments, but weren't the best. &#34;Pirates Ahoy&#34; was GREAT!&#34;Chill Out&#34; had a few cute moments. &#34;Goblin King&#34; was great. &#34;Samurai Ghost&#34; was strange, but interesting. &#34;AbraKadarbra Doo&#34; wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. &#34;Camp Scare&#34; was surprisingly good. &#34;Phantosaur&#34; was terrible.Now onto this 17th chapter. The first thing to be aware of is that this is NOT a defining film like &#34;Pirates Ahoy&#34; or &#34;The Goblin King.&#34; For one thing, Fred is absurdly dumbed down. This just doesn't work seeing that he is the leader. Another thing is that they talk about this 'vacation staying a vacation.' I'm sorry, but this is crazy. We all know the formula. They always seem to be on vacation. But it never stays a vacation. It just is something we can't accept at this point.The story is basically this. Scooby and the gang head down south and they run across what appears to be some kind of festival of vampires. By this, I mean people dressing up like vampires. There is one woman who is selling vampire charms. And one man who claims to be a descendant of Abraham Van Helsing is clearly upset because his books aren't selling so well. Maybe I shouldn't hold this against the film, but most people know that Van Helsing was just a fictional character created by Mr. Stoker.Then what appears to be a legitimate show staged by actors (who happen to be believers in vampires) turns into a seeming problem when a real vampire is released. It appears that he is after Daphne to make her his bride.Trying to be fair, the movie isn't all bad. It does allow us to take some guesses. And as usual, we have to think of economics being the true reason behind the seemingly supernatural crime. The movie also explores the theme of people taking advantage of unrest to score political points. It turns out an overly religious  man wants to stomp out the crime himself. Not surprisingly, we find he is running for Mayor. I'm Catholic, so I'm not knocking religion. But religion can be misused, and an outward show of it can in fact be hiding  a personal ulterior motive.It appears these actors have been promised some great rewards by the supposed real vampire if they deliver Daphne to him. And I better stop here so I don't ruin it for those who haven't seen it.The main difference between this and other Scooby Doo films is that you will notice that there are SEVERAL times where the characters break into song. To be fair, some of them were charming. But you can't help but wonder if the music was a tool to compensate for a 'not so great' story.The best way to finish is to say it was ok, and it had some interesting moments. But it certainly did not have the well written work of &#34;Pirates Ahoy&#34; or &#34;Camp Scare.&#34; Nor did it have the innocent charm of &#34;Monster of Mexico.&#34; It didn't have the frightening moments of &#34;Zombie Island&#34; or the later &#34;Big Top.&#34; It didn't have the moral lesson of &#34;Blue Falcon.&#34; And far less did it give us the chills from &#34;Goblin King.&#34; (You're on your own now in a world that doesn't have the same rules as yours.)This 17th film is ok, and it does have it's moments. And if you are looking for a musical Scooby, well this will deliver. But in my opinion, this is an ok at best film.",3,"Has Some Good Moments, But Lacks Scooby's Normal Edge",1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,3702,"['Well', 'here', 'rundown', '34', 'Zombie', 'Island', '34', 'was', 'great', '34', 'Witch', 'Ghost', '34', 'had', 'strong', 'punch', '34', 'Alien', 'Invasion', '34', 'had', 'good', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', '34', 'Cyber', 'Chase.', '34', '34', 'Legend', 'Vampire', '34', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', '34', 'Monster', 'Mexico', '34', 'had', 'moments', '34', 'Loch', 'Ness', '34', 'was', 'interesting', '34', 'Aloha', '34', '34', 'Where', 'My', 'Mummy', '34', 'had', 'moments', 'were', ""n't"", 'best', '34', 'Pirates', 'Ahoy', '34', 'was', 'GREAT', '34', 'Chill', 'Out', '34', 'had', 'few', 'cute', 'moments', '34', 'Goblin', 'King', '34', 'was', 'great', '34', 'Samurai', 'Ghost', '34', 'was', 'strange', 'interesting', '34', 'AbraKadarbra', 'Doo', '34', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', '34', 'Camp', 'Scare', '34', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', '34', 'Phantosaur', '34', 'was', 'terrible.Now', '17th', 'chapter', 'first', 'thing', 'be', 'aware', 'NOT', 'defining', 'film', '34', 'Pirates', 'Ahoy', '34', '34', 'Goblin', 'King.', '34', 'one', 'thing', 'Fred', 'absurdly', 'dumbed', 'down', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'seeing', 'leader', 'thing', 'talk', ""'vacation"", 'staying', 'vacation', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'crazy', 'know', 'formula', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'vacation', 'never', 'vacation', 'just', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'point.The', 'story', 'basically', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'head', 'south', 'run', 'what', 'be', 'kind', 'festival', 'vampires', 'mean', 'people', 'dressing', 'up', 'vampires', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'selling', 'vampire', 'charms', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'descendant', 'Abraham', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'clearly', 'upset', 'books', 'are', ""n't"", 'selling', 'so', 'well', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'hold', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'was', 'just', 'fictional', 'character', 'created', 'Mr.', 'Stoker.Then', 'what', 'be', 'legitimate', 'show', 'staged', 'actors', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'believers', 'vampires', 'seeming', 'problem', 'when', 'real', 'vampire', 'released', 'Daphne', 'make', 'bride.Trying', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'allow', 'take', 'guesses', 'usual', 'have', 'think', 'economics', 'being', 'true', 'reason', 'seemingly', 'supernatural', 'crime', 'movie', 'also', 'theme', 'people', 'taking', 'advantage', 'unrest', 'score', 'political', 'points', 'out', 'overly', 'religious', 'man', 'stomp', 'out', 'crime', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'find', 'running', 'Mayor', ""'m"", 'Catholic', ""'m"", 'not', 'knocking', 'religion', 'religion', 'can', 'be', 'misused', 'outward', 'show', 'can', 'fact', 'be', 'hiding', 'personal', 'ulterior', 'motive.It', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'promised', 'great', 'rewards', 'supposed', 'real', 'vampire', 'deliver', 'Daphne', 'better', 'stop', 'here', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.The', 'main', 'difference', 'other', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'films', 'will', 'notice', 'are', 'SEVERAL', 'times', 'where', 'characters', 'break', 'song', 'be', 'fair', 'were', 'charming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'music', 'was', 'tool', 'compensate', ""'not"", 'so', 'great', 'story.The', 'best', 'way', 'finish', 'say', 'was', 'ok', 'had', 'interesting', 'moments', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'well', 'written', 'work', '34', 'Pirates', 'Ahoy', '34', '34', 'Camp', 'Scare.', '34', 'did', 'have', 'innocent', 'charm', '34', 'Monster', 'Mexico.', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'frightening', 'moments', '34', 'Zombie', 'Island', '34', 'later', '34', 'Big', 'Top.', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'moral', 'lesson', '34', 'Blue', 'Falcon.', '34', 'far', 'less', 'did', 'give', 'chills', '34', 'Goblin', 'King.', '34', ""'re"", 'own', 'now', 'world', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'rules', 'yours', '17th', 'film', 'ok', 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'looking', 'musical', 'Scooby', 'well', 'will', 'deliver', 'opinion', 'ok', 'best', 'film']",Scooby-Doo!

Very funny and witty scenes and then...the gang break out into SEVERAL showtunes.  The first song was clever and I thought as a one shot, it was cool and different.  But that's just it...the rest of the video is little bits of plot with lots and lots of showtunes.  My 3 year old didn't care for it and he watches everything with scooby.
