It centers aroud 4 characters called the UCB who are trying to create chaos and they see everything through hidden cameras. The 4 of them make up all of the characters through each 20 minute episode. One thing that stands out in this show is that for first 15 minutes they show a bunch of characters and in the last 5 minutes they all come together and interact with each other with hilarious results. Also they do have reappearing characters but they also have reappearing themes that are very subtle and you have to look for like on shirts, posters and T.V. shows. I became a fan during the 3rd season and and I didn't  think understand or notice some of the themes until I saw this season. They also go out with a hidden camera and bother people on the street. This season isn't as funny as their other ones and it does lack in some spots because it's their first season and they were trying to see what worked for them or not I guess.

779111,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0000DJYNE,General Zombie,"[2, 3]","The Upright Citizens Brigade was one of the first and worst casualties of Comedy Central's as of yet unsuccesful but ongoing campaign to try and make their channel suck.(yeah, they still got a few good shows, but there are a bunch that they stupidly cancelled or practically ceased to play re-runs for)  Fortunately, the DVD era has made it popular to have just about everything come out on DVD, so we got UCB season 1 about a year ago, and it's just great.  I fear that they will not be releasing any more seasons, so everyone out there has got to pick up a copy of this one, and hope for the best.Shortly after UCB was cancelled they stopped airing re-runs with any consistency. (Though they show it some nowadays) During this time, the show grew into near legend in my mind, as I'd reflect upon how great it was with my friends, and watch the few episodes that I'd managed to tape.  After a few years of this I heard that the DVD was coming out, and I was excited but a bit worried.  I was decidedly concerned that it had been built up too much in my mind, and would turn out to not be as good as I remembered it being.  It turns out that it was even better.  You only get 10 episodes here, but I'd say 7 of them are absolutely first-rate, about as funny as anything you'll ever see on TV, and the other 3 are still very funny, if not quite as good.The biggest problem with sketch comedy is inconsistency and excess repetition.  The UCB avoid each of these pitfalls almost with out exception.  I'm not sure if I can think of a single sketch from this season that simply doesn't work, and they pace them perfectly, never dragging them out too long.  They also do a good job constucting the episodes, actually managing to bring the disparate threads together succesfully, and often ending the show on a spectacularly funny note.(The first four episodes of this season particularly come to mind)I could go on and on pointing a few particular highlights from the shows, but I'll just do a couple.  Capt. Lunatick is probably the funniest character from this season.  He's perhaps a bit of a 1 note character, but he's held up after numerous viewings, and his final line from The Bucket of Truth is absolutely priceless.  The mad Steve Youngblood is almost equal to him, and the scene where he is introduced is perhaps the funniest individual sketch in the season.('You dont want to learn Kung-Fu, you wanna learn to kick as...' has got to be the single best line from the season)  The fortune cookie scene from Time Machine is also unspeakably hilarious, and a really good example of how they pace the sketches just right.(They easily could've had that go on way too long.) And Cyborgs is perhaps the single best episode from the season.  I won't go in to specifics, it's all awesome.Buy UCB season 1, and prove to the corporate world that comedy that is actually funny can sell too.",5,Some of the Best Comedy on Television,1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,2882,"['Upright', 'Citizens', 'Brigade', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'worst', 'casualties', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'yet', 'unsuccesful', 'ongoing', 'campaign', 'try', 'make', 'channel', 'suck', 'yeah', 'still', 'got', 'few', 'good', 'shows', 'are', 'bunch', 'stupidly', 'cancelled', 'practically', 'ceased', 'play', 're-runs', 'Fortunately', 'DVD', 'era', 'made', 'popular', 'have', 'just', 'everything', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'got', 'UCB', 'season', '1', 'year', 'ago', 'just', 'great', 'fear', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'releasing', 'more', 'seasons', 'everyone', 'there', 'got', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'one', 'hope', 'best.Shortly', 'UCB', 'was', 'cancelled', 'stopped', 'airing', 're-runs', 'consistency', 'show', 'nowadays', 'time', 'show', 'grew', 'near', 'legend', 'mind', ""'d"", 'reflect', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'friends', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'managed', 'tape', 'few', 'years', 'heard', 'DVD', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'excited', 'bit', 'worried', 'was', 'decidedly', 'concerned', 'had', 'been', 'built', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'mind', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'being', 'out', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'only', 'get', '10', 'episodes', 'here', ""'d"", 'say', '7', 'are', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'about', 'as', 'funny', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'TV', 'other', '3', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'quite', 'good.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'inconsistency', 'excess', 'repetition', 'UCB', 'pitfalls', 'almost', 'out', 'exception', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'think', 'single', 'sketch', 'season', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'pace', 'perfectly', 'never', 'dragging', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'constucting', 'episodes', 'actually', 'managing', 'bring', 'disparate', 'together', 'succesfully', 'often', 'ending', 'show', 'spectacularly', 'funny', 'note', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'season', 'particularly', 'come', 'mind', 'could', 'go', 'pointing', 'few', 'particular', 'highlights', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'just', 'do', 'couple', 'Capt', 'Lunatick', 'probably', 'funniest', 'character', 'season', 'perhaps', 'bit', '1', 'note', 'character', 'held', 'up', 'numerous', 'viewings', 'final', 'line', 'Bucket', 'Truth', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'mad', 'Steve', 'Youngblood', 'almost', 'equal', 'scene', 'where', 'introduced', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'individual', 'sketch', 'season', ""'You"", 'dont', 'want', 'learn', 'Kung-Fu', 'wan', 'learn', 'kick', 'got', 'be', 'single', 'best', 'line', 'season', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'scene', 'Time', 'Machine', 'also', 'unspeakably', 'hilarious', 'really', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'pace', 'sketches', 'just', 'right', 'easily', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Cyborgs', 'perhaps', 'single', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'specifics', 'awesome.Buy', 'UCB', 'season', '1', 'prove', 'corporate', 'world', 'comedy', 'actually', 'funny', 'can', 'sell', 'too']",N/A
779112,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0000DJYNE,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 8]","I saw a few of the UCB's stuff on youtube and Comedy Central years back, and I thought it was pretty stupid.  I decided to rent the first season to give it a try again.  It was better than my first opinion, but it wasn't anything fantastic.  It had some wickedly funny moments (the guy who ""appears"" in Star Wars and Out of Africa is really quite funny, along with the wedding rehearsal sketch), but it has some really tepid stuff, like the linking material with the four members in a spaceship controlling the universe.  The opening of the show is also quite tedious and borderline stupid.  The Saigon Suicide Show, while a great title for an episode, seems like it goes on forever, and is not particularly funny.  There's a sketch where an architecture firm is in a forest (which is funny, and reminscent of a Python sketch where Terry Jones has to walk to a flying lesson through a forest), but the UCB version constantly mentions that they're in a forest, as opposed to Python, who never mention it and just let it happen (which makes it funnier and more surreal).  The series has a tinge of smugness to it, a symptom of 90's comedy.  One thing about this series which is surprisingly good is that it doesn't have a lot of cuts in it.  Usually sketch shows like this are filled with unnecessary cuts and pointless graphics, and this season, at least, has none of that.  Some of the framing/composition for the show is quite good, especially considering it's a sketch show.  It's not something one normally expects in an outing like this.The three main actors (Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh) are decent, but they are awfully one note after a while, simply playing another character in the same manner as they did their other characters.  The biggest surprise is the absolutely adorable Amy Poehler.  Like many, I've only known her for her SNL stuff, and that's not a great standard, as SNL reeks to the bowels of hell these days (and has reeked for quite some time).  Poehler here gets to play numerous characters, and her performances are not as one note like her fellow cast members.  She shows why people really respond to her, as she has real acting talent.I'm glad I revisted this stuff, and while I'm not a convert, Upright Citizens Brigade has its moments.",3,"Has its moments, but average....",1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,2277,"['saw', 'few', 'UCB', 'stuff', 'youtube', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'years', 'back', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'decided', 'rent', 'first', 'season', 'give', 'try', 'again', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'opinion', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'fantastic', 'had', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'moments', 'guy', 'who', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Out', 'Africa', 'really', 'quite', 'funny', 'wedding', 'rehearsal', 'sketch', 'really', 'tepid', 'stuff', 'linking', 'material', 'four', 'members', 'spaceship', 'controlling', 'universe', 'opening', 'show', 'also', 'quite', 'tedious', 'borderline', 'stupid', 'Saigon', 'Suicide', 'Show', 'great', 'title', 'episode', 'forever', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'sketch', 'where', 'architecture', 'firm', 'forest', 'funny', 'reminscent', 'Python', 'sketch', 'where', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'walk', 'flying', 'lesson', 'forest', 'UCB', 'version', 'constantly', 'mentions', ""'re"", 'forest', 'opposed', 'Python', 'who', 'never', 'mention', 'just', 'let', 'happen', 'funnier', 'more', 'surreal', 'series', 'tinge', 'smugness', 'symptom', '90', 'comedy', 'One', 'thing', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'good', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'cuts', 'Usually', 'sketch', 'shows', 'are', 'filled', 'unnecessary', 'cuts', 'pointless', 'graphics', 'season', 'least', 'none', 'framing/composition', 'show', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'considering', 'sketch', 'show', 'not', 'something', 'one', 'normally', 'outing', 'this.The', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'Matt', 'Besser', 'Ian', 'Roberts', 'Matt', 'Walsh', 'are', 'decent', 'are', 'awfully', 'one', 'note', 'while', 'simply', 'playing', 'character', 'same', 'manner', 'did', 'other', 'characters', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'many', ""'ve"", 'only', 'known', 'SNL', 'stuff', 'not', 'great', 'standard', 'SNL', 'bowels', 'hell', 'days', 'reeked', 'quite', 'time', 'Poehler', 'here', 'play', 'numerous', 'characters', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'note', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'why', 'people', 'really', 'respond', 'real', 'acting', 'talent.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'revisted', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'not', 'convert', 'Upright', 'Citizens', 'Brigade', 'moments']",N/A

779114,A17E28QEX42YU0,B0000DJYNE,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[4, 6]","This show is one of a kind. Brilliance. Utter, hysterical brilliance. Now I'm not a genius of any sort, but I've always considered myself to have a sense of humor that was somehow inherently ""smart"". When I think of it, there's really no such thing, and perhaps I've always thought this way as a form of making myself feel better than others... That said, I still think that I have a heightened sense of perception when it comes to humor and all its aspects. I've never even studied the art form, I simply know what is funny. Upright Citizens Brigade, is funny.This is one of my favorite shows ever. Yet, half of the show is moderately funny, if at all. But inconsistenty does not matter when a show reaches highs as high as UCB -- the heavens of spine-splitting laughter. For those of you who have seen the show, a few moments:A flight team testing its crew pilots on making it 'till the end of a crash without disturbing the customers verbally over the speakerphone. The captain tells one of the crew members to pray to a higher power, as it brings consolation in one's last members.(pilot in test booth, captain watching on video from outside)Pilot: Ah, I just lost both my engines!Captain: Go to the prayer.Pilot: Dear almighty one -- I turn to you now (camera pans to captain seriously, confidently giving an approving nod) in my moment of need. I call upon... all the (voice turns to a very low, growling tone) power of your dark forces, to deliver me to the fires of hell (pulls out a knife, starts stabbing his stomach) where I was born; my father a demon, my mother a jackal; sweet sweet Satan, now is the time, for your reign of death and terror, to begin... (wails his knife in the air as he goes down)This is all performed SO perfectly, you have to see it to believe. My description ultimately proves entirely worthless, and without the performance at hand it might even sound gimicky. But those who have seen it will relive it and laugh.Another highlight scene involves an obnoxious baldheaded lady and a group of three others at a dinner table, one in a wheelchair. As the lady sits down, she spurts out ""So, how'd you get in the wheelchair?"". Sound becomes mute as they all drop their knives on their plate. It's a moment of comedic bliss, I tell you.Why is the show so good? It just is. I think one reason it's so good is there is no laughtrack, and it isn't live. These are not only brilliant comedic minds, but good actors as well. They provide hauntingly funny expressions and performances with nuance and a great deal of subtlety, that you simply don't see in live acts like SNL and Mr. Show. Granted, they've got more than one chance to perform, but it still exceeds because they aren't at the knife of the immediate moment.And there's no uneven balance among the cast, either. They are truly all near equal and each possess their own individual talents. Because it isn't live, a great deal can be done with the editing process and cinematography, as well as timing. The direction is top notch, and often brings the lower quality episodes to a brighter place.I love this show, and will definitely purchase Seasons 2 and 3 if  they ever get released.
