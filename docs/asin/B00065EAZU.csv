The DVD, in particular, is so well done! Has cute little children, ages 3 and up (would like to  seen a few toddlers). Maybe Farmer in the Dell, I would have scripted characters to the song. And I couldn't make the connection with the trains on London Bridge. Maybe it's just me not knowing the true story. All in all, the DVD is so nearly perfect. Our little girl sings and dances to all the songs. She's tryng to say the words to ""Ring""Around the Rosey"" and has ""picked up"" many of the letter sounds on ""A, B, C"" song. And it is really good for GamGam's conditioning, as on several songs, my grand daughter commands me to hold her and dance around with her. ""Ring Around Rosey""is a workout!!!
