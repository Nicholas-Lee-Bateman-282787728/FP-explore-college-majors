I don't remember the black and white ones as a kid, but I did watch the color years in themid - late 60s. Quality is great. Please Paramount release seasons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. These shows are so enjoyable towatch again. I will also beg for more Petticoat Junction seasons. It's also great because by now most of the popularsit-coms from the 60s are available on dvd.

1671516,A3V6GOT6UWQ04G,B00FFARI7I,FAN OF THE GREAT STUFF,"[20, 21]","CBS/Paramount has done an amazing job here and great service to classic TV fans. They have taken the original 35mm picture negatives along with the high-fidelity magnetic audio recordings and digitally restored the entire Season 4 episodes of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES to pristine quality. This is the first season of COLOR episodes and they look better than when first broadcast thanks to today's technology. In the old days, a composite print would be made for broadcast but using the original negative with high-definition scanning (and converting back to standard definition for DVD) brings about a beautiful picture. It is like watching an entirely different show seeing all the bright colors of the 1960s instead of old faded television rerun syndication prints and transfers.Anyone who has watched The Beverly Hillbillies in color in the past will be blown away by this set. PLUS ALL THE EPISODES ARE COMPLETE. Someone posted a complaint that original cast sponsor commercials are not included but those of course werenot part of the episodes - they were COMMERCIALS - so the fact is these are full episodes looking and sounding like a million bucks. Really incredible and at a bargain price for 30+ episodes. CBS/Paramount has also done the same brilliant job with PETTICOAT JUNCTION SEASON 3, the first color year for that sister show.",5,STUNNING PICTURE QUALITY AND COLOR - COMPLETE EPISODES LOOKING BETTER THAN WHEN ORIGINALLY AIRED,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,1342,"['CBS/Paramount', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'here', 'great', 'service', 'classic', 'TV', 'fans', 'have', 'taken', 'original', '35mm', 'picture', 'negatives', 'high-fidelity', 'magnetic', 'audio', 'recordings', 'digitally', 'restored', 'entire', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'THE', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLBILLIES', 'pristine', 'quality', 'first', 'season', 'COLOR', 'episodes', 'look', 'better', 'when', 'first', 'broadcast', 'thanks', 'today', 'technology', 'old', 'days', 'composite', 'print', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'broadcast', 'using', 'original', 'negative', 'high-definition', 'scanning', 'converting', 'back', 'standard', 'definition', 'DVD', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'watching', 'entirely', 'different', 'show', 'seeing', 'bright', 'colors', '1960s', 'instead', 'old', 'faded', 'television', 'rerun', 'syndication', 'prints', 'transfers.Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'color', 'past', 'will', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'set', 'EPISODES', 'ARE', 'COMPLETE', 'Someone', 'posted', 'complaint', 'original', 'cast', 'sponsor', 'commercials', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'course', 'werenot', 'part', 'episodes', 'were', 'COMMERCIALS', 'so', 'fact', 'are', 'full', 'episodes', 'looking', 'sounding', 'million', 'bucks', 'Really', 'incredible', 'bargain', 'price', '30+', 'episodes', 'CBS/Paramount', 'also', 'done', 'same', 'brilliant', 'job', 'PETTICOAT', 'JUNCTION', 'SEASON', '3', 'first', 'color', 'year', 'sister', 'show']",The Beverly Hillbillies: The Official Fourth Season
1671517,A30Y6PX7QC1OR9,B00FFARI7I,"Kenneth Rubin ""ZorroAnd Xena""","[1, 1]","Zorro and Xena are my 2 cats, Xena is a female tuxedo cat about 8 years old, whose favorite DVD is a catnip video, where she gets to sit in front of the TV and chase birds, squirrels and chipmunks, when she's not in the backyard stalking the real ones, her favorite episodes on Hillbillies are when Elly May is by the pool with her critters. Zorro is a grey tomcat about 3 months older than her with a white mustache and chest, who is more into erotic video, so he likes to see Elly May by the pool in her swimsuit, he could care less if she was with her critters.If Zorro had the choice between Granny and Elly May, of course it would be no contest. Zorro felt there were too many episodes about Granny this year, Granny returning home for possum day, Granny and the possum day parade, Granny goes to Vegas, Granny buys a horse when she can't get a driver's license, Granny seees an ostrich and thinks it's a big chicken, Granny and the old folk's home, and on and on.Zorro would have liked to see more episodes about Jed, Jethro and especially Elly May like in the previous seasons. Zorro's all time favorite episode this season was The Beautiful Maid, where not only was Elly May by the swimming pool, but guest star Julie Newmar was also there with her and they were both in their swimsuits and he was really excited about this as was Jethro. And Xena was also interested hoping to see some critters by the pool.So hopefully, future seasons will have more of Jed, Jethro and Elly May, because when Granny goes into her tantrums, and starts yelling and whining, Zorro takes off to his favorite hiding place in the basement under the stairs until the theme song comes on again at the end of the show.",5,Critters,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,1702,"['Zorro', 'Xena', 'are', '2', 'cats', 'Xena', 'female', 'tuxedo', 'cat', '8', 'years', 'old', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'catnip', 'video', 'where', 'sit', 'front', 'TV', 'chase', 'birds', 'squirrels', 'chipmunks', 'when', 'not', 'backyard', 'stalking', 'real', 'ones', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Hillbillies', 'are', 'when', 'Elly', 'May', 'pool', 'critters', 'Zorro', 'grey', 'tomcat', '3', 'months', 'older', 'white', 'mustache', 'chest', 'who', 'more', 'erotic', 'video', 'so', 'see', 'Elly', 'May', 'pool', 'swimsuit', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'was', 'critters.If', 'Zorro', 'had', 'choice', 'Granny', 'Elly', 'May', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'contest', 'Zorro', 'felt', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'Granny', 'year', 'Granny', 'returning', 'home', 'possum', 'day', 'Granny', 'possum', 'day', 'parade', 'Granny', 'Vegas', 'Granny', 'horse', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'driver', 'license', 'Granny', 'ostrich', 'big', 'chicken', 'Granny', 'old', 'folk', 'home', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'episodes', 'Jed', 'Jethro', 'especially', 'Elly', 'May', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Zorro', 'time', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'was', 'Beautiful', 'Maid', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Elly', 'May', 'swimming', 'pool', 'guest', 'star', 'Julie', 'Newmar', 'was', 'also', 'there', 'were', 'swimsuits', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'about', 'was', 'Jethro', 'Xena', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'hoping', 'see', 'critters', 'pool.So', 'hopefully', 'future', 'seasons', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'Jed', 'Jethro', 'Elly', 'May', 'when', 'Granny', 'tantrums', 'yelling', 'whining', 'Zorro', 'favorite', 'hiding', 'place', 'basement', 'stairs', 'theme', 'song', 'again', 'end', 'show']",The Beverly Hillbillies: The Official Fourth Season

1671521,A30YRHJ3CMMGAU,B00FFARI7I,"R. Childers ""Hobbes""","[6, 6]","I was 9 years old when Season 4 hit the air waves.  TV had better writers back then and the comedy was real.  I bought this mostly for an episode, second one on disk one, called THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC in which Mrs. Drysdale messes around with astrology and Granny thinks it's black magic.  Granny is rude to Mrs. Drysdale and runs her off but decides to go apologize to her and walks into Drysdale's house and discovers a miner bird which Granny instantly mistakes for a crow that the black magic has turned Mrs. Drysdale into.  Of course the bird has picked up Mrs, Drysdale's speech and Granny is certain it is her.  The hilarity starts from there.  Granny phones the ""critter doctor"" who is out and Jed comes in later when the vet calls back and thinks it's Mrs. Drysdale's doctor and is told to take her shoes off and get her in a cage and get her to flap around until her yellow feet are pink again.  Jed does exactly that!  Mrs Drysdale cries out, ""can't I stop now?""  Jed says, ""let me see your feet . . . Yea, they's nice and pink now!""The mix ups in this episode are the hallmark of this comedy and really crack me up!  I had forgotten that these episodes are in color and they do have the original music score.  But I am surprised at how crisp and clear these turned out.  I swear on the big screen TVs we have today the picture is much better than when the shows aired in 1965.  The characters almost look 3D in some scenes.  Well worth the price if you liked these terrific shows when you were young. And I'm sure an unexpected treat for this generation that has never seen these wonderful yayhoos!In 1969 Buddy Ebsen came to a mall near me and we got an autographed photo of him wearing that old hillbilly hat.
