1431946,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B004XCUEU2,audrey,"[20, 22]","Wow -- what a compelling and fun documentary! Back and Forth starts with the early career of Foo Fighters' founder Dave Grohl, including personal revelations and commentary about the death of Kurt Cobain by Grohl and others (like Nevermind producer Butch Vig). After the end of Nirvana Grohl took eight months off then recorded songs he'd written over the past few years; liking what he heard, he asked the rhythm section of recently-demised Sunny Day Real Estate to join him, and FF was off the ground. The retrospective continues chronologically through lineup changes and albums and lineup changes and tours and drama and lineup changes, with candid commentary from each of the band members (current and former) and lots of great concert footage, home videos, funny music videos and fascinating behind-the-scenes extras. The film finishes with the delightful process of recording the group's latest release, 2011's Wasting Light, which took place at Grohl's home with the band members' families around, produced by Butch Vig and with input from Husker Du's Bob Mould and ex-Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic playing on ""I Should Have Known"", a haunting tearjerker that addresses Grohl's feelings about Cobain these many years later. The final scene shows a live performance of ""Burning Bridges"" while each band member acknowledges how lucky they are. Which is a nice change from the angsty, drug-addled hedonism we so often get from entertainment folk. Like Metallica's Some Kind of Monster, you want to watch this again right away, and find yourself loving the band even more.I especially liked the footage of Grohl giving in to his daughter's pleas to go swimming; we see them in the pool while Mould and Vig work on a track in Dave's garage. It emphasizes the difference between Cobain and Grohl -- one who shone bright and flamed out, and one who has persevered and grown -- maturing into a fine musician with a great group around him. I've always liked FF but come away from this film with an even deeper admiration for them.While the concert footage was great fun, what I truly adored was seeing the process -- the writing, the practicing, the backstage jokes. Extra features are also a blast: pre-production of ""These Days""; MMM-MMM (with possible KFC revenue to follow!); ""On the Mend"" with its revelation that Grohl is a typical guy; Dave Struggles with Recording; the wonderful glimpse of duo drumming in ""Bridge Burning"" Rhythm Plan; Krist Novoselic on Accordion(!); the hysterical Taylor's Cymbals; Mixing (including the car test); and an Alternate Ending.You know in a lot of ways getting older stinks, but the good part is that I have a great catalogue of music experiences. It was pretty awesome to be a little kid when Beatles albums were coming out, and at university when Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zepellin's Physical Graffiti arrived. I get the same feeling here -- that this is an amazing group, and with ""Wasting Light"" we are seeing the arrival of a classic, fittingly bringing some closure to Grohl's history with Nirvana.I rented this on Netflix and am going to buy it because I liked it so much. Awesome!

Kentros ""SharkByte""","[1, 1]","If you're a music fan, and the kind of person who can appreciate something even more once you've learned about its history, this film is for you.  For those who don't know, Foo Fighters is the band assembled by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as he began the next musical chapter of his life, this time as a frontman.  It might be a stretch to say that if you weren't already a fan of Foo Fighters music that this film would make you one, but if you are intrigued by shows like &#34;Behind The Music&#34; and can appreciate the journey of a bonafide rockstar basically starting over, this film might just do it.I've always liked them but after seeing this it made me like them even more, learning about their journey from a group of musicians assembled to play the music from Dave's self-made demo tape to millions of albums sold to the recording of their last album &#34;Wasting Light&#34; in Dave's garage.  It doesn't only cover the history of Foo Fighters but of each member's personal stories and how they all came to the point in their career when they joined Foo Fighters and how the experience has been for each of them.  I think it was a very smart move to include the footage of them making the Wasting Light album, as this film was released just before the album.  Watching them make that album made me instantly attached to it and when I listen to it I love thinking back to the film and remembering the stories behind the songs and what was going on while they recorded it.The most interesting part of this film for me was how Dave fought to get past being known as just &#34;the drummer from Nirvana&#34; and wanted this to be a real band with its own identity.  Considering the level of success he has already reached before Foo Fighters, starting over and touring clubs in a van is not something everyone would do!

Certainly with rock bands, the formula is pretty much the same.  Long before you've ever heard of a band, their members struggled or were successful on a local or regional level.  While musicianship is critical, chemistry between band mates is primary.  You learn that if you can't work with others, you will likely be gone.I could have laid this doc on top of the new one about The Eagles and you wouldn't have much of a difference.  After the death of Curt Cobain came the death of Nirvana.  After several months, drummer Dave Grohl decides to move on by writing his own songs and playing a guitar.  After releasing an early FF album in which he plays all the instruments, he decides to tour, but needs a band.  First a trio then a quartet, the band goes through the requisite changes.It is Grohl's band.  He will write the music and he will make all the decisions.  Some are fine with this, others are not.  This isn't a democracy.  Grohl, as you might expect is front and center and is very smart and very articulate.  He makes for a good story teller.  Every member is featured including those who were fired.  Some were surprised and remain bitter.  Like most documentaries of this ilk, we hear nothing of what being on the road is like.  Other than it is tiring.  No mention of the women, the sex.  The only drug reference is Taylor Hawkins well chronicled overdose in England.  We also hear nothing from the wives or family members that may have had an impact along the way.

If you didn't know that prior to going into Foo Fighters Back and Forth documentary you will be sure of it after viewing it. And this video is really The History of Dave Grohl as much as it is about the Foo Fighters.The DVD starts with a young Grohl joining Nirvana and reveals a lot of inside story about the dynamic of that band and its tragic end. Then the real fun starts as Dave lays it all out there from getting the Foo Fighters together through getting the first album out through the many intricacies and trials and tribulations of the band to the current day and the release of Wasting Light.Let me tell you, friends and neighbors...this video affected me. I don't know if it affected me so much becauseWasting Lightalso so affected me, or if it's that I'll be seeing the Foo's for my first time next month, or perhaps I just related to a lot of the experiences as a musician myself (failed musician but musician nonetheless!). But this video affected me. I rocked. I laughed. I rocked. I got disappointed. I rocked. I even got friggin emotional at one point! And I'm no Foo Fighters fan boy; I've been critical of the group for putting out records that have a few great songs and a lot of forgettable songs. However the band really turned that corner for me with Wasting Light, which has track after track of great songs.Foo Fighters Back and Forth is a must for Foo Fighters fans, but maybe even more so for anyone who's ever wanted to know how to make a good band and then make that good band persevere through it all to greatness.Side note: The DVD does NOT include the live studio performance of the entire Wasting Light album that was shown in theaters along side the Back and Forth documentary. That's kind of a bummer, because it is an excellent little show and an intimate look at the band playing the album together.
