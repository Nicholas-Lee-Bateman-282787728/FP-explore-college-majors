278956,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301967496,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","As a huge fan of Bette Davis (I strongly consider her the best actress to ever grace the big screen), I was overwhelmed with joy to encounter `Dangerous' on TCM a while back.  `Dangerous' was Davis's first taste of Oscar glory, and while she boldly claimed that she didn't deserve the win, I was still very, very excited to see it for the first time.While I tend to agree with Davis (she believed that Katharine Hepburn deserved the Oscar for `Alice Adams') I do believe that she highly underestimated herself here.  While the film itself is not completely up to snuff, the performances within it are very, very good; especially that of Davis who embodies Joyce Heath with a vulnerability that makes her real and endearing despite her apparent flaws.The film follows a torrid affair between a washed up stage actress named Joyce Heath and an architect named Don Bellows.  Don is engaged to be married, but he calls off that engagement to start a relationship with Joyce.  Joyce firmly believes that she is jinxed and that anyone foolish enough to seek out a relationship with her is signing their own death slip, but Don dives right in.  Soon things are looking better than ever for Joyce, and for Don, but that jinx catches up with them soon enough when a secret is revealed that threatens to destroy their relationship.For me, this film almost has it.  I liked the concept and the basic plot, but I feel that the construction at times is a tad lazy.  The ending is also morally important, but it needed more time to truly establish itself as poignant.  A sign of the times (very rarely were films longwinded and heavily detailed in the 30's) but this film needed to be a tad longer.  It clocks in at under an hour and a half, and that barely gives us enough time to really flesh out these characters.  Proof of the need for more time is the ending, when the secret is revealed, our impression of Joyce is supposed to change drastically, but they haven't really built enough layers to her in order to make that change appropriate.That said; Davis nearly nails to part.  She is outstanding here, never overselling anything but completely playing to her strengths and establishing a woman who feels real and relatable.  Franchot Tone, who plays her love interest, is also very well used here.  I was least impressed with Margaret Lindsay, but that may have more to do with the script (I understand subtlety, but the way she reacted to the broken engagement was ridiculously unrealistic).In the end I highly recommend this one.  If you are a fan of Miss Davis then you need to see her Oscar winning portrayal of the boozy actress who only wanted to be happy.  You won't be sorry!",4,Sometimes we are our own worst enemy...,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2677,"['huge', 'fan', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'strongly', 'consider', 'best', 'actress', 'ever', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'joy', 'encounter', 'Dangerous', 'TCM', 'while', 'back', 'Dangerous', 'was', 'Davis', 'first', 'taste', 'Oscar', 'glory', 'boldly', 'claimed', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'win', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'first', 'time.While', 'tend', 'agree', 'Davis', 'believed', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Alice', 'Adams', 'do', 'believe', 'highly', 'underestimated', 'here', 'film', 'not', 'completely', 'snuff', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Davis', 'who', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'vulnerability', 'real', 'endearing', 'apparent', 'flaws.The', 'film', 'torrid', 'affair', 'washed', 'up', 'stage', 'actress', 'named', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'architect', 'named', 'Don', 'Bellows', 'Don', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'engagement', 'start', 'relationship', 'Joyce', 'Joyce', 'firmly', 'jinxed', 'anyone', 'foolish', 'enough', 'seek', 'out', 'relationship', 'signing', 'own', 'death', 'slip', 'Don', 'dives', 'right', 'Soon', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'better', 'ever', 'Joyce', 'Don', 'jinx', 'up', 'soon', 'enough', 'when', 'secret', 'revealed', 'destroy', 'relationship.For', 'film', 'almost', 'liked', 'concept', 'basic', 'plot', 'feel', 'construction', 'times', 'tad', 'lazy', 'ending', 'also', 'morally', 'important', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'truly', 'establish', 'poignant', 'sign', 'times', 'very', 'rarely', 'were', 'films', 'longwinded', 'heavily', 'detailed', '30', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'tad', 'longer', 'hour', 'half', 'barely', 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'Proof', 'need', 'more', 'time', 'ending', 'when', 'secret', 'revealed', 'impression', 'Joyce', 'supposed', 'change', 'drastically', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'built', 'enough', 'layers', 'order', 'make', 'change', 'appropriate.That', 'said', 'Davis', 'nearly', 'nails', 'part', 'outstanding', 'here', 'never', 'overselling', 'anything', 'completely', 'playing', 'strengths', 'establishing', 'woman', 'who', 'real', 'relatable', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'used', 'here', 'was', 'least', 'impressed', 'Margaret', 'Lindsay', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'script', 'understand', 'subtlety', 'way', 'reacted', 'broken', 'engagement', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'unrealistic', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'are', 'fan', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'then', 'need', 'see', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'portrayal', 'boozy', 'actress', 'who', 'only', 'wanted', 'be', 'happy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry']",N/A

She plays a down-and-out actress who begins receiving attention from admirer Franchot Tone. She has a drinking problem and, even worse, a husband (John Eldredge) that she keeps secret from Tone. He breaks up with his fianc&eacute;e to marry her; when her husband refuses to divorce her, she deliberately crashes the car they're in hoping to kill him. It doesn't work, though he's crippled for life. Tone learns the truth, but encourages her to go on stage again; she does and is a big hit. She then attempts to atone for her awful behavior by trying to get back in Eldredge's good graces. Davis is good, though she would be much better in later pictures. Tone is crazy about her, though at times it's hard to see why, and the ending is about as sugary as it could get.

This one shows on par with my VHS copy, but the real value of the Warners Vault releases is that (at least currently) you get to see exceptional movies or ones that you like that aren't readily seen on TCM.After being stymied by her contract with the brothers Warner to get much in terms of good material, Bette Davis managed to make the most of what roles were given her and with the role of Joyce Heath in this film she managed to hit pay dirt. What might have been just another ordinary film turned out to be a veritable bonanza for Davis' career. She won the coveted Oscar and that validation would lead to sometimes better roles among a sea of clunkers, but that's a whole other story.This movie gave Davis the opportunity to strut her stuff, run the gamut of emotions, look worn out and raunchy,then transform to glamorous and seductive, and in the end ultimately redeem her character as a human being.The general plot is pretty simple. Joyce Heath is a Broadway star who falls into the excesses of fame and ends up a total lush. A chance encounter with a young, handsome, and wealthy architect Don Bellows (played by the young, handsome, suave Franchot Tone) gives her the impetus to shed her destructive ways and revive her career with Don's support and encouragement. Of course, complications pop up by way of Don's understanding and sympathetic fiancee Gail Armitage (played by Margaret Lindsey) and Heath's still very much attached husband Gordon Heath(played needily by John Aldredge). Assistance in the form of Don's no-nonsense housekeeper Mrs. Williams (played by adorable Allison Skipworth) rounds out the supporting cast. Anything else said would ruin the plot, so I am stopping short on this one.I liked this movie for a lot of reasons. Davis is really good as the *itchy drunk Joyce who initially doesn't want redemption and certainly doesn't seem deserving of it. She is combative and mean and looks as awful as she behaves. Joyce has hit the skids and looks as though the next stop is skid row. Knowing Davis, she probably had Warners tone down the make-up a lot. Realism wasn't usually the WB makeup department's area of expertise. Conversely, when Davis transforms once she is off the bottle she is also darn believable. As we all know, the love of a good man will do that in the movies. Tone's Don is really sort of a thankless role because at this point Tone was sort of stereotyped in his film career and would wait for the next decade to come before he could flex his acting muscle. However, he is so darn handsome, bright eyed, trusting, noble and kind that he is irresistible and he is just perfect in this role. Joyce hits the man bonanza with Don. Margaret Lindsey is o.k. as the noble and selfless Gail, but again she often fit into this sort of role. As for Eldredge, he is adequately whiney as sniveling Gordon. It was easy to see why Joyce left Gordon in the dust. Of note, though of less importance, is Allison Skipworth who finds the floozy drunk Joyce impossible. You get the idea that Mrs. Williams would rather hog tie Joyce than make her breakfast.This movie moves quickly. It has very little meaningless dialogue and is interesting despite stock WB footage. Ultimately, this is a great movie for Bette Davis fans or anyone who has a soft spot for Franchot Tone.",4,She Did It The Hard Way,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,3377,"['DVDs', 'Warners', 'Vault', 'are', 'generally', 'no', 'great', 'treat', 'technically', 'one', 'par', 'VHS', 'copy', 'real', 'value', 'Warners', 'Vault', 'least', 'currently', 'get', 'see', 'exceptional', 'movies', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'readily', 'seen', 'TCM.After', 'being', 'stymied', 'contract', 'brothers', 'Warner', 'get', 'much', 'terms', 'good', 'material', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'managed', 'make', 'most', 'what', 'roles', 'were', 'given', 'role', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'film', 'managed', 'hit', 'pay', 'dirt', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'ordinary', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'veritable', 'bonanza', 'Davis', 'career', 'won', 'coveted', 'Oscar', 'validation', 'would', 'lead', 'sometimes', 'better', 'roles', 'sea', 'clunkers', 'whole', 'other', 'story.This', 'movie', 'gave', 'Davis', 'opportunity', 'strut', 'stuff', 'run', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'look', 'worn', 'out', 'raunchy', 'then', 'transform', 'glamorous', 'seductive', 'end', 'ultimately', 'character', 'human', 'being.The', 'general', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'Broadway', 'star', 'who', 'excesses', 'fame', 'up', 'total', 'lush', 'chance', 'encounter', 'young', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'architect', 'Don', 'Bellows', 'played', 'young', 'handsome', 'suave', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'impetus', 'shed', 'destructive', 'ways', 'revive', 'career', 'Don', 'support', 'encouragement', 'course', 'complications', 'pop', 'up', 'way', 'Don', 'understanding', 'sympathetic', 'fiancee', 'Gail', 'Armitage', 'played', 'Margaret', 'Lindsey', 'Heath', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'attached', 'husband', 'Gordon', 'Heath', 'played', 'needily', 'John', 'Aldredge', 'Assistance', 'form', 'Don', 'no-nonsense', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Williams', 'played', 'adorable', 'Allison', 'Skipworth', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Anything', 'else', 'said', 'would', 'ruin', 'plot', 'am', 'stopping', 'short', 'one.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'reasons', 'Davis', 'really', 'good', '*itchy', 'drunk', 'Joyce', 'who', 'initially', ""n't"", 'want', 'redemption', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deserving', 'combative', 'mean', 'as', 'awful', 'Joyce', 'hit', 'skids', 'next', 'stop', 'skid', 'row', 'Knowing', 'Davis', 'probably', 'had', 'Warners', 'tone', 'down', 'make-up', 'lot', 'Realism', 'was', ""n't"", 'usually', 'WB', 'makeup', 'department', 'area', 'expertise', 'Conversely', 'when', 'Davis', 'bottle', 'also', 'darn', 'believable', 'know', 'love', 'good', 'man', 'will', 'do', 'movies', 'Tone', 'Don', 'really', 'sort', 'thankless', 'role', 'point', 'Tone', 'was', 'sort', 'stereotyped', 'film', 'career', 'would', 'wait', 'next', 'decade', 'come', 'could', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscle', 'However', 'so', 'darn', 'handsome', 'bright', 'eyed', 'trusting', 'noble', 'kind', 'irresistible', 'just', 'perfect', 'role', 'Joyce', 'man', 'bonanza', 'Don', 'Margaret', 'Lindsey', 'o.k', 'noble', 'selfless', 'Gail', 'again', 'often', 'fit', 'sort', 'role', 'Eldredge', 'adequately', 'whiney', 'sniveling', 'Gordon', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Joyce', 'left', 'Gordon', 'dust', 'note', 'less', 'importance', 'Allison', 'Skipworth', 'who', 'floozy', 'drunk', 'Joyce', 'impossible', 'get', 'idea', 'Mrs.', 'Williams', 'would', 'rather', 'hog', 'tie', 'Joyce', 'make', 'breakfast.This', 'movie', 'moves', 'quickly', 'very', 'little', 'meaningless', 'dialogue', 'interesting', 'stock', 'WB', 'footage', 'Ultimately', 'great', 'movie', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'soft', 'spot', 'Franchot', 'Tone']",N/A

Davis has been quoted as saying that she developed a crush on Tone and she certainly glows in their scenes together.The film deteriorates into soap opera and the production values are journeyman but it is still worthwhile to view Davis, a new kind of actress in 1935, working very hard to turn melodrama into legitimate emotion.

278962,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6301967496,"""flickjunkie""","[22, 23]","Bette Davis began appearing in films in 1931 at the age of 23.  She was an extremely hard working actor, and by the time she made this film in 1935, she had appeared in 27 films including ""Of Human Bondage"" for which she received her first Oscar nomination the year before.The story is compelling.  Don Bellows (Franchot Tone) is an architect who claims that his life was changed forever by a theater performance by a young actress named Joyce Heath (Bette Davis) who came to prominence quickly and vanished almost as fast.  He was so moved by her performance that he re-evaluated his life and took on a new direction, moving from being a stockbroker to indulge his more creative side by studying architecture.  One day he comes upon Joyce who is stinking drunk.  He recognizes her and attempts to engage her in conversation, but she is cruel and derisive.  When she passes out, he takes her back to his place to sober her up and care for her.  Despite her decrepit condition, he is captivated by her and falls madly in love with her, breaking off his engagement to Gail (Margaret Lindsay).Don begins the process of rehabilitating Joyce and though she is resentful and bitter at first, she is won over by his devotion to her and agrees to take a part in a play that she always wanted, a play that he used all his money to back.  However, Joyce has a secret that dooms the relationship.  She is a dangerous woman who ruins the men who love her.  The world comes crashing down on her and on the men in her life.This is a well-crafted story that keeps the viewer intrigued from beginning to end.  Davis is electrifying in the role.  I consider this and her performance in ""All About Eve"" (where she also played a bitter actress) to be her best.  She throws herself into the role and delivers a performance that ranges from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows.  She won her first of two Academy Awards for this film and went on to be nominated a total of 13 times.This film is a must for anyone interested in Ms. Davis body of work and for the classic film buff in general.

Dowdy and down-and-out and ashamed of being Joyce Heath."" Pity Joyce Heath, once regarded as the preeminent actress of her era until a series of calamities banished her to anonymity. So feel bad for her, but belay the pity party when in her presence because she will tear your head off. Pride cometh before the fall, and sometimes afterwards hangeth around for an extended stay.One journalist, when asked about the legendary Joyce Heath: ""She was too brilliant and too startling for a star. She was a comet which appeared suddenly, failed spectacularly and disappeared completely."" A desperate Joyce Heath, short of prospects, was last seen touring in a cheap vaudeville act.Some years had elapsed as this movie opens, just in time for a pedestrian to recognize her in the street, a moment of acknowledgment that she rebuffs in a clipped tone. Later, in that same gentleman's club abovementioned, architect Don Bellows (Franchot Tone) reminisces about the great actress and how, years, ago, one magnificent performance inspired him to alter his fortunes, to trade a future in Wall Street for the chance to create.And later that evening, Don, his fianc&eacute;e (Margaret Lindsay), and some friend are out on the town and go to a bar for a nightcap. Who should Don see boozing in the corner but Joyce Heath herself? When the revelers call it a night, a concerned Don opts to stick around to make sure the pathetic actress was okay. She's not okay. She is, however, extremely rude. The rest of the story chronicles his efforts to redeem Joyce Heath and combat her perception that she's a jinx to the men in her life.When in a mood for old-timey melodrama, cue up Bette Davis. She rarely disappoints. She really isn't like anyone else. Her vitality and ferocity command your attention. Of her performance in DANGEROUS, E. Arnot Robertson of the Picture Post notes: ""I think Bette Davis would probably have been burned as a witch if she had lived two or three hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet.""If you could harness Bette Davis' energy you could perhaps power a third world nation for months. There was sentiment circulated that, as compelling as she was in DANGEROUS, the Oscar she won for it was actually in lieu of the Oscar nomination that eluded her the year prior forOf Human Bondage. And I guess that came off as a back-handed compliment. What's inarguable is that she turns in a hell of virtuoso acting job in DANGEROUS.

Believed to be a jinx by a superstitious theatre crowd, Heath is bad news, a sloppy, bitter drunk who drowns her sorrows in gin soaked jags of self pity. The former brightest star on Broadway is now a bottom feeder, living on the skids.Enter Don Bellows, played with earnest sincerity by Franchot Tone, a fan of Heath when she was at her peak. He claims that a performance of hers, which he saw, forever changed his life, allowing him to become the architect he always dreamed of being, rather than a stockbroker. One day, he sees Ms. Heath in a gin joint, totally in her cups. Sending his friend and his fiancee, Gail, home, he returns to the gin joint and takes Joyce Heath to his country home to rehabilitate her in repayment for the tremendous difference that she had, unknowingly, made in his life. What he does not count on is falling in love with her.The bitter Joyce initially resists his attempts to get her back on the road to recovery, but ultimately responds to his nurturing and concern for her welfare. Recovered, she finds that she has fallen in love with him and he with her. His passion for her causes him to break off his engagement with Gail, his socially prominent fiancee.Wanting to help Joyce regain the stardom that she previously had and that her thespian talent demands, Don backs a broadway show that he believes will allow her to regain her rightful place on Broadway. He does this, despite her protestations that she has brought only ruin to those men who had the misfortune to fall in love with her. He also insists that she marry him. His simple, though insistent, marriage proposal sets into motion a sequence of events that he could not possibly have envisioned. Enter Gordon Heath, a blast from Joyce's secret past, who must be dealt with, if Joyce is to find any happiness with Don. How she deals with him, however, sets her down a path out of one's worst nightmare. Subsequent events later make Don realize that Joyce is truly &quot;dangerous&quot;.Bette Davis is dazzling in her role. She runs the gamut of human emotions in playing the role of Ms. Heath and, deservedly, won what was to be the first of two Academy Awards for Best Actress. Franchot Tone is fine in his role, but what on earth the studio saw in him, I cannot fathom. He is certainly no heartthrob and is not even particularly charismatic. The role of Gordon Heath, played with simpering masochism by John Eldridge, makes the viewer marvel at the restraint Joyce had in dealing with him, as Eldridge's portrayal makes the viewer's fingers itch with the urge to slap him numerous times.Unfortunately, the sizzle in the movie fizzles, when the film gives in towards the end to utter sanctimonious banality. It is too bad, given the performance by Ms. Davis, as it could have been a great movie. Still, this is a must see film for all Davis fans.",3,A BITTER BETTE STEALS THE SHOW...,1064620800,"09 27, 2003",2003,3002,"['Bette', 'Davis', 'won', 'Oscar', 'deft', 'portrayal', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'former', 'Broadway', 'star', 'who', 'made', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'top', 'just', 'quickly', 'hit', 'bottom', 'Believed', 'be', 'jinx', 'superstitious', 'theatre', 'crowd', 'Heath', 'bad', 'news', 'sloppy', 'bitter', 'drunk', 'who', 'sorrows', 'gin', 'soaked', 'jags', 'self', 'pity', 'former', 'brightest', 'star', 'Broadway', 'now', 'bottom', 'feeder', 'living', 'skids.Enter', 'Don', 'Bellows', 'played', 'earnest', 'sincerity', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'fan', 'Heath', 'when', 'was', 'peak', 'performance', 'hers', 'saw', 'forever', 'changed', 'life', 'allowing', 'become', 'architect', 'always', 'dreamed', 'being', 'rather', 'stockbroker', 'One', 'day', 'Ms.', 'Heath', 'gin', 'joint', 'totally', 'cups', 'Sending', 'friend', 'fiancee', 'Gail', 'home', 'gin', 'joint', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'country', 'home', 'rehabilitate', 'repayment', 'tremendous', 'difference', 'had', 'unknowingly', 'made', 'life', 'What', 'not', 'count', 'falling', 'love', 'her.The', 'bitter', 'Joyce', 'initially', 'attempts', 'get', 'back', 'road', 'recovery', 'ultimately', 'nurturing', 'concern', 'welfare', 'Recovered', 'fallen', 'love', 'passion', 'causes', 'break', 'off', 'engagement', 'Gail', 'socially', 'prominent', 'fiancee.Wanting', 'help', 'Joyce', 'regain', 'stardom', 'previously', 'had', 'thespian', 'talent', 'demands', 'Don', 'broadway', 'show', 'will', 'allow', 'regain', 'rightful', 'place', 'Broadway', 'protestations', 'brought', 'only', 'ruin', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'fall', 'love', 'also', 'marry', 'simple', 'insistent', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'motion', 'sequence', 'events', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'envisioned', 'Enter', 'Gordon', 'Heath', 'blast', 'Joyce', 'secret', 'past', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'dealt', 'Joyce', 'find', 'happiness', 'Don', 'How', 'however', 'down', 'path', 'one', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'Subsequent', 'events', 'later', 'make', 'Don', 'realize', 'Joyce', 'truly', 'quot', 'dangerous', 'quot', '.Bette', 'Davis', 'dazzling', 'role', 'gamut', 'human', 'emotions', 'playing', 'role', 'Ms.', 'Heath', 'deservedly', 'won', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'first', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'fine', 'role', 'what', 'earth', 'studio', 'saw', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'certainly', 'heartthrob', 'not', 'even', 'particularly', 'charismatic', 'role', 'Gordon', 'Heath', 'played', 'simpering', 'masochism', 'John', 'Eldridge', 'viewer', 'marvel', 'restraint', 'Joyce', 'had', 'dealing', 'Eldridge', 'portrayal', 'viewer', 'fingers', 'itch', 'urge', 'slap', 'numerous', 'times.Unfortunately', 'sizzle', 'movie', 'fizzles', 'when', 'film', 'towards', 'end', 'utter', 'sanctimonious', 'banality', 'too', 'bad', 'given', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Davis', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'Still', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'Davis', 'fans']",N/A

A year earlier, she had given a bravura performance as the slutty Mildred Rogers in OF HUMAN BONDAGE, for which she had been denied an Oscar.  Even though her performance as Joyce Heath in DANGEROUS was as a morally questionable actress who would stop at nothing to succeed, Hollywood gave her a belated trophy as Best Actress.  As the drunkard Heath, Miss Davis gives an over the top performance that is so one dimensional that the audience can be forgiven for overlooking her otherwise mesmerizing journey from the height of success to its nadir.Joyce Heath is an actress who has achieved reknown only to wind up as a drunken sot when she encounters Don Bellows (Franchot Tone), who promptly and inexplicably takes her under his wing, feeds and cares for her, then falls in love with her.  Heath tells him that she is ""jinxed."" He refuses to believe her.  She fails to tell him that she has a husband (John Eldridge)whom she has abandoned for much the same reason.  The plot quickly degenerates into soap and nonsense, but at the same time, Davis had the gift of making even disreputable characters like Joyce Heath watchable.  The audience wonders what Franchot Tone sees in her to want to marry or what John Eldridge sees to want to reconcile with her.  What emerges from DANGEROUS is the clear exposition of the dangers involved in becoming so enamored of success in one's professional life that one forfeits it in one's personal life.  Eldridge, by contrast, comes off as impossibly forgiving as a saint who can forgive anything--even attempted murder--merely to cling to a vain hope of Heath's rediscovering her feelings for him. Tone, at least, learns that love has its limits.  The bottom line on DANGEROUS is that it is little more than a descent into the depths of desperation, even if Bette Davis grabs our interest as she rides her self-imposed roller coaster of twisted emotions.",3,"No Doubt: Bette is ""Dangerous""",1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,2013,"['time', 'DANGEROUS', 'was', 'released', '1935', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'was', 'rising', 'star', 'not', 'yet', 'one', 'first', 'magnitude', 'year', 'earlier', 'had', 'given', 'bravura', 'performance', 'slutty', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', 'OF', 'HUMAN', 'BONDAGE', 'had', 'been', 'denied', 'Oscar', 'Even', 'performance', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'DANGEROUS', 'was', 'morally', 'questionable', 'actress', 'who', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'succeed', 'Hollywood', 'gave', 'belated', 'trophy', 'Best', 'Actress', 'drunkard', 'Heath', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'top', 'performance', 'so', 'one', 'dimensional', 'audience', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'overlooking', 'otherwise', 'mesmerizing', 'journey', 'height', 'success', 'nadir.Joyce', 'Heath', 'actress', 'who', 'achieved', 'reknown', 'only', 'wind', 'up', 'drunken', 'sot', 'when', 'Don', 'Bellows', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'who', 'promptly', 'inexplicably', 'wing', 'feeds', 'cares', 'then', 'love', 'Heath', 'jinxed', 'believe', 'tell', 'husband', 'John', 'Eldridge', 'whom', 'abandoned', 'much', 'same', 'reason', 'plot', 'quickly', 'soap', 'nonsense', 'same', 'time', 'Davis', 'had', 'gift', 'making', 'even', 'disreputable', 'characters', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'watchable', 'audience', 'what', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'want', 'marry', 'what', 'John', 'Eldridge', 'want', 'reconcile', 'What', 'DANGEROUS', 'clear', 'exposition', 'dangers', 'involved', 'becoming', 'so', 'enamored', 'success', 'one', 'professional', 'life', 'one', 'one', 'personal', 'life', 'Eldridge', 'contrast', 'off', 'impossibly', 'forgiving', 'saint', 'who', 'can', 'forgive', 'anything', 'even', 'attempted', 'murder', 'merely', 'cling', 'vain', 'hope', 'Heath', 'rediscovering', 'feelings', 'Tone', 'least', 'love', 'limits', 'bottom', 'line', 'DANGEROUS', 'little', 'more', 'descent', 'depths', 'desperation', 'even', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'interest', 'self-imposed', 'roller', 'coaster', 'twisted', 'emotions']",N/A

The plot moves along rather well even if it's a tad slow at times; and the convincing acting held my attention very well.The action begins with Donald 'Don' Bellows (Franchot Tone) and his fianc&eacute;e Gail Armitage (Margaret Lindsay) are out on the town and by chance Don notices the has-been actress Joyce Heath (Bette Davis). Joyce has fallen from fame because of a ""jinx"" that has somehow become associated with anyone whose life crosses with hers. Don takes pity on Joyce because she was such a great talent in the theater and now he finds her alcoholic and practically penniless. Don sends Gail home so that he can secretly move Joyce to his country home; Don wants to help Joyce recuperate and regain her strength there. Don sincerely wants to help Joyce.However, things begin to change. Don and Joyce fall in love; and the plot really thickens when Don breaks his engagement to Gail to marry Joyce. Don has also put up a great deal of money to get Joyce a plum role in a major play so that Joyce can regain her lost stardom and fame.Actually, there's still much more to the plot even though you may think I've told it all. Will any of this affect Don's business plans? How will Gail react to Don's breakup with her? Will Joyce be strong enough to be a success in the play Don finances for her? Will Joyce ""jinx"" the play? And why does Joyce always steer Don away from the topic of marriage? Don wants to marry Joyce because he loves her; and Joyce by all accounts seems to love Don in return. Why is Joyce stalling on marriage? The answer to that question alone may surprise you.The cinematography reflects good judgment and the choreography works well for the scene in which Don and Joyce go running in the rain back to Don's country estate.Overall, Dangerous gave Bette Davis a fine vehicle to display her immense talent. Davis acts uncommonly well as she communicates even the most subtle of emotions with just a look from her eyes and a very slight turn of her head. Very few actresses could ever act that well. Franchot Tone portrays Don very convincingly as well; but the movie still belongs to Bette Davis.I highly recommend this film for Bette Davis fans; and people who appreciate 1930s drama on film will like Dangerous, too.Enjoy!",5,fine early Bette Davis vehicle,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,2344,"['Bette', 'Davis', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'star', 'early', 'vehicle', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'entitled', 'Dangerous', 'plot', 'rather', 'well', 'even', 'tad', 'slow', 'times', 'convincing', 'acting', 'held', 'attention', 'very', 'well.The', 'action', 'Donald', ""'Don"", 'Bellows', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Gail', 'Armitage', 'Margaret', 'Lindsay', 'are', 'out', 'town', 'chance', 'Don', 'has-been', 'actress', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Joyce', 'fallen', 'fame', 'jinx', 'somehow', 'become', 'associated', 'anyone', 'life', 'hers', 'Don', 'pity', 'Joyce', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'talent', 'theater', 'now', 'alcoholic', 'practically', 'penniless', 'Don', 'Gail', 'home', 'so', 'can', 'secretly', 'move', 'Joyce', 'country', 'home', 'Don', 'help', 'Joyce', 'recuperate', 'regain', 'strength', 'there', 'Don', 'sincerely', 'help', 'Joyce.However', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'Don', 'Joyce', 'fall', 'love', 'plot', 'really', 'when', 'Don', 'engagement', 'Gail', 'marry', 'Joyce', 'Don', 'also', 'put', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'money', 'get', 'Joyce', 'plum', 'role', 'major', 'play', 'so', 'Joyce', 'can', 'regain', 'lost', 'stardom', 'fame.Actually', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'even', 'may', 'think', ""'ve"", 'told', 'Will', 'affect', 'Don', 'business', 'plans', 'How', 'will', 'Gail', 'react', 'Don', 'breakup', 'Will', 'Joyce', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'be', 'success', 'play', 'Don', 'finances', 'Will', 'Joyce', 'jinx', 'play', 'why', 'Joyce', 'always', 'steer', 'Don', 'away', 'topic', 'marriage', 'Don', 'marry', 'Joyce', 'Joyce', 'accounts', 'love', 'Don', 'return', 'Why', 'Joyce', 'stalling', 'marriage', 'answer', 'question', 'alone', 'may', 'surprise', 'you.The', 'cinematography', 'good', 'judgment', 'choreography', 'well', 'scene', 'Don', 'Joyce', 'go', 'running', 'rain', 'back', 'Don', 'country', 'estate.Overall', 'Dangerous', 'gave', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'fine', 'vehicle', 'display', 'immense', 'talent', 'Davis', 'uncommonly', 'well', 'even', 'most', 'subtle', 'emotions', 'just', 'look', 'eyes', 'very', 'slight', 'turn', 'head', 'Very', 'few', 'actresses', 'could', 'ever', 'act', 'well', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'Don', 'very', 'convincingly', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'still', 'Bette', 'Davis.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', '1930s', 'drama', 'film', 'will', 'like', 'Dangerous', 'too.Enjoy']",N/A

The character of Joyce Heath  gave Davis an oppurtunity to convey all of the most instense emotions of  which she was capable, from anxiety to zealousness, including liberal  amounts of her famous screen bitchiness. The script is rather weak and  mawkish at times and the film is almost totally carried by Davis, who uses  all her well-known acting tricks to make her character come alive. Alison  Skipworth is amusing as Mrs.Williams, Bellows cook who tells Franchot  confidentially that Davis is indeed &quot;dangerous&quot;. Ernest Haller's  photography is justly praised; in the middle of the film, Davis is  beautifully photographed, and her scenes with Tone (playing cards and  eating homemade toffee) are incredibly spontaneous and realistic. Margaret  Lindsay plays socialite Gail Armitage to whom Bellows is engaged (and  eventually marries) and she gives a typical &quot;stock&quot; performance.  Davis gives an Oscar worthy performance yet she is the only thing this  movie has going for it; the character of Gordon Heath is unbelievably lame  and the ending is unsatisfactory and banal to say the least. DANGEROUS was  a success at the box office and it was one of Warner's biggest money-makers  for 1935.",4,VINTAGE DAVIS,945820800,"12 22, 1999",1999,1915,"['Bette', 'Davis', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'alcoholic', 'stage', 'star', 'self-destructive', 'complex', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'vitally', 'tempestuous', 'creature', 'who', 'ruined', 'reputation', 'actress', 'come', 'be', 'regarded', 'profession', 'something', 'jinx', 'Theatrically', 'blacklisted', 'become', 'alcoholic', 'depths', 'own', 'self-destruction', 'One', 'night', 'drinking', 'hole', 'seedy', 'bar', 'noticed', 'wealthy', 'architect', 'Don', 'Bellows', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'Heath', 'been', 'idolized', 'Bellows', 'ever', 'saw', 'play', 'Juliet', 'years', 'Don', 'Heath', 'wing', 'bringing', 'house', 'country', 'inevitable', 'love', 'affair', 'ensues', 'character', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'gave', 'Davis', 'oppurtunity', 'convey', 'most', 'instense', 'emotions', 'was', 'capable', 'anxiety', 'zealousness', 'including', 'liberal', 'amounts', 'famous', 'screen', 'bitchiness', 'script', 'rather', 'weak', 'mawkish', 'times', 'film', 'almost', 'totally', 'carried', 'Davis', 'who', 'well-known', 'acting', 'tricks', 'make', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'Alison', 'Skipworth', 'amusing', 'Mrs.Williams', 'Bellows', 'cook', 'who', 'Franchot', 'confidentially', 'Davis', 'indeed', 'quot', 'dangerous', 'quot', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'photography', 'justly', 'praised', 'middle', 'film', 'Davis', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'scenes', 'Tone', 'playing', 'cards', 'eating', 'homemade', 'toffee', 'are', 'incredibly', 'spontaneous', 'realistic', 'Margaret', 'Lindsay', 'socialite', 'Gail', 'Armitage', 'whom', 'Bellows', 'engaged', 'eventually', 'marries', 'typical', 'quot', 'stock', 'quot', 'performance', 'Davis', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'yet', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'character', 'Gordon', 'Heath', 'unbelievably', 'lame', 'ending', 'unsatisfactory', 'banal', 'say', 'least', 'DANGEROUS', 'was', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'one', 'Warner', 'biggest', 'money-makers', '1935']",N/A

Although this 1935 film reeks of soap & has a really corny ending, you can get fixated watching LaDavis - still in her blonde period - act everyone off the screen. For her performance alone, DANGEROUS is worth sitting through: otherwise it would be considered a hackeneyed, mawkish piece of vintage trash. Bette plays Joyce Heath, a once-esteemed theatre actress who's drifted into the seedy life of alcholism and self-pity. One night, while drinking cheap gin in a dive, she's recognised by a young, promising architect named Don Bellows, who takes her under his wing and encourages the once-great actress to make a come-back... Davis is astonishingly electrifying in her playing: one can see why she was a fascination to 1935 moviegoers! Mind you, not everyone was a Davis devotee, but her highly charged, energetic personality was nigh impossible to ignore once seen on the silver screen. The middle of the film contains the best scenes, and there's a genuine - if somewhat unusual - chemistry between Davis and Tone. Margaret Lindsay does well enough as classy Gail Armitage who tells Bellows that ""a secret's a secret"". Franchot Tone isn't as bad as other reviewers have stated; he certainly had a fine speaking voice. As the almost unbearably mealy Gordon Heath, one wants to slap John Eldredge's face: an unbelievable entry in the cut-my-arm-off-if-it-will-help-you martyr sweepstakes. As a trivial footnote, the final working title of the film (after about seven inadequate ones) was HARD LUCK DAME. It was Davis herself who came up with naming the film DANGEROUS.

As  Joyce Heath, Davis plays an actress on the skids; she believes she's a  jinx. Franchot Tone sees his favorite (he never forgot her playing of  Juliet) in a dive drinking cheap liquor and he eventually takes the  pathetic creature in. Davis comes off better when she plays Heath as coy  and viciously hysterical;when lines make her sputtery and tearful she's  just okay. During the middle of the picture, the dialogue is stripped and  biting and Ernest Haller's photography of Davis helps immensely. Gordon  Heath, played by John Eldridge is such a mealy maschoist that Davis seems  to have done him a favor by crippling him. Don Bellows is played adequately  by Franchot Tone (whom Davis later openly admitted she fell for during  production, alas, he belonged to Joan of Crawford! and this may well have  sparked their famous forty-year feud!)",4,BETTE AS A JINX-BETTER RUN FOR YOUR LIFE,944611200,"12 8, 1999",1999,1212,"['Even', 'mawkish', 'trash', 'Davis', 'electrifying', 'frequently', 'viewer', 'sit', 'up', 'stare', 'was', 'performance', 'critic', 'Andre', 'Sennwald', 'once', 'commented', 'Davis', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quot', 'burned', 'witch', 'quot', 'had', 'lived', '200', 'years', 'prior', 'reference', 'famous', 'kinetic', 'electric', 'energy', 'quot', 'ordinary', 'outlet', 'quot', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'Davis', 'actress', 'skids', 'jinx', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'favorite', 'never', 'forgot', 'playing', 'Juliet', 'dive', 'drinking', 'cheap', 'liquor', 'eventually', 'pathetic', 'creature', 'Davis', 'off', 'better', 'when', 'Heath', 'coy', 'viciously', 'hysterical', 'when', 'lines', 'make', 'sputtery', 'tearful', 'just', 'okay', 'middle', 'picture', 'dialogue', 'stripped', 'biting', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'photography', 'Davis', 'immensely', 'Gordon', 'Heath', 'played', 'John', 'Eldridge', 'such', 'mealy', 'maschoist', 'Davis', 'have', 'done', 'favor', 'crippling', 'Don', 'Bellows', 'played', 'adequately', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'whom', 'Davis', 'later', 'openly', 'admitted', 'fell', 'production', 'alas', 'belonged', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'sparked', 'famous', 'forty-year', 'feud']",N/A
278980,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301967496,Simon Davis,"[11, 11]","During her often painful and very frustrating ""apprenticeship"", period at Warner Bros, Bette Davis was forced to appear in many highly forgettable film roles that sported titles such as ""Housewife"", and ""Parachute Jumper"", and while she had no illusions about much of her film work and indeed her own performances through this period, 1934's ""Dangerous"", costarring Franchot Tone was definately the standout in the bunch. It finally provided the young and driven Bette Davis with a character worthy of her dramatic efforts and she responded by giving a sterling performance despite the film's often quite soppy subject matter. As Davis herself was quoted as saying about this film, ""I saw potential in the role of Joyce Heath, I realised the pot holes in the story and had to work like ten dogs to stop it from getting bogged down in treacle!"". Work she did, and very well indeed as it turned out, being rewarded for her efforts with the 1935 Best Actress Academy Award.Viewed today ""Dangerous"", while highly entertaining and featuring a terrific performance by Bette Davis, is very obvious in its weaknesses and contains alot of situations and dialogue that really dont ring true. Nevertheless it is an important film in the career of Davis in that it revealed what she was capable of achieving when time and effort was spent on preparing her films a little better than previously.It tells the story of acclaimed actress Joyce Heath who finds herself a jinx on both the people in her life and in any production she is involved in. Going from being the shining light of Broadway she finds herself in the alchoholic gutter with no friends and no career. A chance encounter with rich architect Don Bellows (Franchot Tone in a good but poorly written role) changes her circumstances as Bellows is immediately attracted to her and becomes her champion in all things. Despite being engaged to be married to lovely socialite Gail Armitage (Margaret Lindsay)he determines to restore Joyce's life as once, she (unknowingly), inspired him to better himself and explore his artistic side in the field of architecture. Taken by Don to sober up at his country estate Joyce, a chronic drinker first resents and verbally attacks Don however as she sees the importance he places on getting her life back in order she responds and finds herself falling in love with him despite warning him of her jinx on men and that she will always be ""dangerous"", to any person who comes close to her. Don decides to bank roll her return to Broadway and on the eve of the first night it seems that the jinx is again at work when it is discovered that Joyce actually is married and cannot obtain a divorce after Don asks her to marry him after the first night of the play. In an insane rage Joyce tries to kill her sickly devoted husband Gordon (John Eldredge) after he refuses to divorce her and thus jeopardizes the production due to open. It's only after this diseaster and when Don has gone and finally married Gail that Joyce realises that others are important and then attempts to right the terrible wrong she has done to both her now crippled husband and the many peope in the Broadway comunity that had faith in her.Vintage soap opera? Maybe, but acted with a conviction by Bette Davis that does make us believe the improbable situations occuring. The supporting cast also score great acting points in their various roles. Franchot Tone who never really settled into the Hollywood acting situation has a difficult role to play here as on one side of things he must be a capable business type who is obviously an astute individual while on the reverse having to play a character that really wouldn't probably get involved in the situation he finds himself in. He does well playing Bellows but alot of his situation fails to really ring true. Margaret Lindsay is delightful as Don's spurned fiance but once again her character as written is perhaps a little too excepting of the situation with Joyce to be regarded as totally realistic. Veteran character actress Alison Skipworth as Mrs. Williams, Don's house keeper really scores as a crusty individual who really stands up to Joyce's drunken ravings and helps put her on the course back to respectability. The look of the production has a rich other worldly feel about it as was typical of movie making in the 1930's. It reveals an almost too glamourous world of smart cars, beautiful clothes, palatial country houses and city apartments. Just the tonic for depression weary movie goers in 1935.I personally love this early performance by Bette Davis a few years before her great period of stardom began. Her great commanding star presence is very obvious even here. I regard ""Dangerous"", as vital to include in any Bette Davis collection and what you see is raw vital talent that within a few years would be refined in a number of unforgettable performances that are as vivid today as they were 60 years ago. Unrealistic as it may be at times ""Dangerous"", is highly entertaining viewing and shouldn't be missed when exploring the formidable collection of work by the legendary Bette Davis.",4,Early Bette

In ""Dangerous"" not only did Bette prove to movie goers and critics that she had the acting chomps, but she garnered, and deservedly, her first Oscar as Best Actress.In ""Dangerous"" Bette plays a woman whose Broadway career goes on the sidelines. Her life is simply a mess and it isn't until she meets a new man that she feels she can rebuild both her career and life. The only obstacle standing in her way is her current husband that she MUST get rid of!Franchot Tone stars with Bette in this soaring melodrama.

Some Hollywood watchers believed that Davis had been mightily assisted in that she had failed to receive a statuette one year earlier for her triumph in Somerset Maugham's ""Of Human Bondage"" starring opposite Leslie Howard.""Dangerous"" begins with Bette Davis being spotted on the street by a prominent local citizen.  Davis immediately denies that she is actress Joyce Heath and goes her way.  When successful young architect Franchot Tone is told about the incident moments later over drinks at a prominent men's club he reveals how seeing the performer on stage proved a catalyst toward him entering the profession of architecture.  Her luminous creativity prompted him to reach out into a creative field of endeavor.The film was said to be based on the life of silent screen star Jeanne Eagels, who died young from alcoholism.  While Tone is engaged to marry Margaret Lindsay, when he meets Davis in a run down bar he finds an excuse to separate himself from his fianc&eacute;e and goes back into the dive where Davis is becoming quickly inebriated.Franchot Tone becomes concerned about nursing Davis back to health.  He considers her a gifted talent going quickly to waste and seeks to make a positive difference before it is too late.At first the strong-willed performer resists, but eventually Davis chooses to get better at the same time she falls in love with Tone, whose impending marriage is quickly scrapped.  During this transition period Davis impresses with her energetic presence as her moods violently fluctuate.Successful architect Tone moves outside his own orbit and gambles money on a play starring Davis.  Broadway veterans warn Tone concerning her jinx reputation.  He is told bluntly that he is risking his own destruction by extending himself too far economically and emotionally to assist a meteoric but problematical talent.The story elements come to a head when Davis returns to her destructive pattern after the audience learns that she is married.  The question to be resolved as the film heads toward its conclusion is whether Davis will ultimately opt for destruction or positively assert herself and move toward a brighter tomorrow.",4,Davis in an Oscar Vehicle,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,2407,"['Bette', 'Davis', 'secured', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'category', '1935', 'release', 'Dangerous', 'direction', 'Alfred', 'Green', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'history', 'directing', 'first', 'ever', 'American', 'talkie', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'six', 'years', 'earlier', 'Hollywood', 'watchers', 'believed', 'Davis', 'had', 'been', 'mightily', 'assisted', 'had', 'failed', 'receive', 'statuette', 'one', 'year', 'earlier', 'triumph', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'starring', 'opposite', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'Dangerous', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'being', 'spotted', 'street', 'prominent', 'local', 'citizen', 'Davis', 'immediately', 'actress', 'Joyce', 'Heath', 'way', 'When', 'successful', 'young', 'architect', 'Franchot', 'Tone', 'told', 'incident', 'moments', 'later', 'drinks', 'prominent', 'men', 'club', 'how', 'seeing', 'performer', 'stage', 'proved', 'catalyst', 'entering', 'profession', 'architecture', 'luminous', 'creativity', 'prompted', 'reach', 'out', 'creative', 'field', 'endeavor.The', 'film', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'based', 'life', 'silent', 'screen', 'star', 'Jeanne', 'Eagels', 'who', 'died', 'young', 'alcoholism', 'Tone', 'engaged', 'marry', 'Margaret', 'Lindsay', 'when', 'Davis', 'run', 'down', 'bar', 'excuse', 'separate', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'back', 'dive', 'where', 'Davis', 'becoming', 'quickly', 'inebriated.Franchot', 'Tone', 'becomes', 'concerned', 'nursing', 'Davis', 'back', 'health', 'gifted', 'talent', 'going', 'quickly', 'waste', 'make', 'positive', 'difference', 'too', 'late.At', 'first', 'strong-willed', 'performer', 'resists', 'eventually', 'Davis', 'get', 'better', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'Tone', 'impending', 'marriage', 'quickly', 'scrapped', 'transition', 'period', 'Davis', 'energetic', 'presence', 'moods', 'violently', 'fluctuate.Successful', 'architect', 'Tone', 'own', 'orbit', 'gambles', 'money', 'play', 'starring', 'Davis', 'Broadway', 'veterans', 'warn', 'Tone', 'concerning', 'jinx', 'reputation', 'told', 'bluntly', 'risking', 'own', 'destruction', 'extending', 'too', 'far', 'economically', 'emotionally', 'assist', 'meteoric', 'problematical', 'talent.The', 'story', 'elements', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Davis', 'destructive', 'pattern', 'audience', 'married', 'question', 'be', 'resolved', 'film', 'conclusion', 'Davis', 'will', 'ultimately', 'opt', 'destruction', 'positively', 'assert', 'move', 'brighter', 'tomorrow']",N/A
