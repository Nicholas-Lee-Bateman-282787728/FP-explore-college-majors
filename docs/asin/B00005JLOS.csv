They soon reveal their secret that they drank some magical water and will stay young forever. Winnie falls in love with heart-throb Jesse Tuck, but when they are seperated, she has to make the choice to drink the water and live forever with him or go on a live life the way it's supposed to be lived, as a cycle.

602827,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLOS,A Customer,"[5, 7]","Summary:Winnifred 'Winnie' Foster (Alexis Bledel) is the daughter of a wealthy land developer, Robert Foster (Victor Garber), and an oppressive mother (Amy Irving).  Winnie feels like she hasn't been able to experience life and doesn't want to be like all of the other rich girls she knows.  So when she is told she is going to be sent away to a boarding school, she runs away.  What she doesn't know is that the forest that she is owned by her father is inhabited by a strange family, the Tucks: Angus Tuck (William Hurt), Mae Tuck (Sissy Spacek), Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson (I)), Miles Tuck (Scott Bairstow).  The Tucks, in their migration west, stopped in this forest for a drink from a well at the bottom of an old tree.  But the well didn't happen to be just a normal well - the water makes people immortal.  Eventually the Tucks were accused of witchcraft where they settled because they weren't getting any older and couldn't be hurt.  So they moved back to the forest to be near the well.Winnie ends up running into Jesse as he is drinking from the well.  Though unsure of what they are going to do with her at the beginning, Jesse and Winnie end up falling in love and spending a couple of weeks together as Winnie's father tries to find her.  However, there is someone else that is interested in the water of the well, a man in a yellow suit (Ben Kingsley).  Eventually, with the help of the man in the yellow suit, Robert Foster finds the Tucks and Winnie and Winnie must decide whether she wants immortality or eventual death.My Comments:I liked this movie.  It won't likely win any awards, but it was kind of cute.  The acting was adequate.  The story is a good concept and I was impressed with how the idea of the fountain of youth was approached.  It was an intriguing story.  The love affair seemed a bit far-fetched - it developed over a week or so and, though no one really knows what it would be like, Jesse was 104 years old compared to Winnie's paltry 15 years.  You might think there would be some differences in maturity, but strangely Jesse was behaving as though he were still just 17.Of course, then you get to the message of the movie.  My wife asked me what I thought when the movie was over and my response was, ""Seems like this is Disney's attempt to help kids deal with death.""  Essentially, Disney is showing kids that living forever isn't all that it is cracked up to be and they, none too subtly, explain that death is a natural part of life.  People are born, people die - that's just what happens.Since I don't have kids, I'm not sure how effective the message of the movie is for kids.  I think it makes a good point and, because this movie seemed to be aimed at youth, being as blatant as they were is probably okay.  Adults may not find it all that entertaining, but you may want to consider it for a discussion of death with your children.",3,"Seemed aimed at youth, though suitable for adults.",1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,2881,"['Summary', 'Winnifred', ""'Winnie"", 'Foster', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'land', 'developer', 'Robert', 'Foster', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'oppressive', 'mother', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Winnie', 'feels', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'experience', 'life', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'other', 'rich', 'girls', 'So', 'when', 'told', 'going', 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'boarding', 'school', 'away', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'forest', 'owned', 'father', 'inhabited', 'strange', 'family', 'Tucks', 'Angus', 'Tuck', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Mae', 'Tuck', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Jesse', 'Tuck', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'Miles', 'Tuck', 'Scott', 'Bairstow', 'Tucks', 'migration', 'west', 'stopped', 'forest', 'drink', 'well', 'bottom', 'old', 'tree', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'be', 'just', 'normal', 'well', 'water', 'people', 'immortal', 'Eventually', 'Tucks', 'were', 'accused', 'witchcraft', 'where', 'settled', 'were', ""n't"", 'getting', 'older', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'hurt', 'moved', 'back', 'forest', 'be', 'well.Winnie', 'up', 'running', 'Jesse', 'drinking', 'well', 'unsure', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'beginning', 'Jesse', 'Winnie', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'spending', 'couple', 'weeks', 'together', 'Winnie', 'father', 'tries', 'find', 'However', 'someone', 'else', 'interested', 'water', 'well', 'man', 'yellow', 'suit', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Eventually', 'help', 'man', 'yellow', 'suit', 'Robert', 'Foster', 'Tucks', 'Winnie', 'Winnie', 'must', 'decide', 'immortality', 'eventual', 'death.My', 'Comments', 'liked', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'likely', 'win', 'awards', 'was', 'kind', 'cute', 'acting', 'was', 'adequate', 'story', 'good', 'concept', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'idea', 'fountain', 'youth', 'was', 'approached', 'was', 'intriguing', 'story', 'love', 'affair', 'seemed', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'developed', 'week', 'so', 'one', 'really', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'Jesse', 'was', '104', 'years', 'old', 'compared', 'Winnie', 'paltry', '15', 'years', 'might', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'differences', 'maturity', 'strangely', 'Jesse', 'was', 'behaving', 'were', 'still', 'just', '17.Of', 'course', 'then', 'get', 'message', 'movie', 'wife', 'asked', 'what', 'thought', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'response', 'was', 'Disney', 'attempt', 'help', 'kids', 'deal', 'death', 'Essentially', 'Disney', 'showing', 'kids', 'living', 'forever', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'none', 'too', 'subtly', 'explain', 'death', 'natural', 'part', 'life', 'People', 'are', 'born', 'people', 'die', 'just', 'what', 'happens.Since', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'effective', 'message', 'movie', 'kids', 'think', 'good', 'point', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'aimed', 'youth', 'being', 'as', 'blatant', 'were', 'probably', 'okay', 'Adults', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'entertaining', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'discussion', 'death', 'children']",N/A

Or the more cynical.In 1914, Winnie (Alexis Bledel) is 15 years old, only child of a very respectable family, and terribly restless. Her parents want to send her to a proper girls' school, which she protests is an awful place. Mother says nonsense, girls come out of there as proper young ladies, which Winnie needs.But Winnie thinks she needs a little freedom, and one day she walks out the iron gate in the iron fence which surrounds her home and into the forest adjoining, which is on property owned by her father but which has been forbidden to her. She wanders through the woods and eventually comes upon a charming young man, apparently 17, named Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson). He takes a drink at a spring coming out of an old tree (have you ever heard of a spring that emerges from the roots or trunk of a tree?), but when she says she is thirsty and tries to get a drink too, he gets violent and forcefully pulls her away from it. He also carries her back to his family in a rustic cabin deep in the woods. There she meets the mother (Sissy Spacek), father (William Hurt) and Jesse's older brother (Scott Bairstow). They keep her there with them, but Mrs. Tuck assures her they will take her home ""as soon as they can.""Meanwhile, of course, her father has called out all the searchers he can, and they are combing the woods for her. Also looking for her is a mysterious man in a yellow suit who had spoken to her the day before at the fence around her house, and asked her if she knew of a family named Tuck. He offers to help her father search for her, but it's clear he has some sinister motive. Since we are already dealing with something magical, I wondered whether he would turn out to be the devil, who had concocted the spring.Oh yes, the spring. Jesse is actually 104 years old, and the rest of the family correspondingly older than they look. Turns out they discovered quite by accident that the spring they had stopped at on their way west caused them to stop aging, be invulnerable to disease or injury, and basically make them immortal. The secret is in the fact that the horse drank from the spring, but not the cat.",4,Sweet Romantic Fantasy,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2235,"['Very', 'sweet', 'Disney', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'simple', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'adults', 'more', 'cynical.In', '1914', 'Winnie', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', '15', 'years', 'old', 'only', 'child', 'very', 'respectable', 'family', 'terribly', 'restless', 'parents', 'want', 'send', 'proper', 'girls', 'school', 'awful', 'place', 'Mother', 'nonsense', 'girls', 'come', 'proper', 'young', 'ladies', 'Winnie', 'needs.But', 'Winnie', 'little', 'freedom', 'one', 'day', 'out', 'iron', 'gate', 'iron', 'fence', 'home', 'forest', 'adjoining', 'property', 'owned', 'father', 'been', 'forbidden', 'woods', 'eventually', 'charming', 'young', 'man', 'apparently', '17', 'named', 'Jesse', 'Tuck', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'drink', 'spring', 'coming', 'old', 'tree', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'spring', 'roots', 'trunk', 'tree', 'when', 'thirsty', 'tries', 'get', 'drink', 'too', 'violent', 'forcefully', 'away', 'also', 'back', 'family', 'rustic', 'cabin', 'deep', 'woods', 'mother', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'father', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Jesse', 'older', 'brother', 'Scott', 'Bairstow', 'keep', 'Mrs.', 'Tuck', 'will', 'take', 'home', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'Meanwhile', 'course', 'father', 'called', 'out', 'searchers', 'can', 'are', 'combing', 'woods', 'Also', 'looking', 'mysterious', 'man', 'yellow', 'suit', 'who', 'had', 'spoken', 'day', 'fence', 'house', 'asked', 'knew', 'family', 'named', 'Tuck', 'help', 'father', 'search', 'clear', 'sinister', 'motive', 'are', 'already', 'dealing', 'something', 'magical', 'wondered', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'devil', 'who', 'had', 'concocted', 'spring.Oh', 'yes', 'spring', 'Jesse', 'actually', '104', 'years', 'old', 'rest', 'family', 'correspondingly', 'older', 'look', 'out', 'discovered', 'quite', 'accident', 'spring', 'had', 'stopped', 'way', 'west', 'caused', 'stop', 'aging', 'be', 'invulnerable', 'disease', 'injury', 'basically', 'make', 'immortal', 'secret', 'fact', 'horse', 'drank', 'spring', 'not', 'cat']",N/A
602830,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JLOS,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Tuck Everlasting is a decent movie.  It's somewhere in between romance and adventure.  Romance because it involves a young girl falling in love with a boy who has the ability to live for all eternity, and adventure because of the whole ""family living in the woods/running from the law"" aspect.It's a Disney film so expect the storyline to be easy to grasp and borderline for children (though perhaps women taking their boyfriends to the movies might like it too).Anyway, yeah, this family living in the woods discovers the fountain of youth... for real.  A puddle of magical water residing by a tree that contains eternal qualities.  The entire family happened to take a sip one day, and from there they'd put themselves in dangerous situations and discover they'd never actually get hurt or die.  Ever.  I believe we've all had these dreams growing up, hence why I believe Tuck Everlasting is more appropriate for the younger age group.The acting is incredibly cheesy and sappy and feels exaggerated, but that's alright- we can't expect violence with it being a Disney film and all.

I am pleased at just how surprised I was; overall the movie was good.  Although they changed the plot some, they gracefully captured the essence of the book -- the author's conception of the horror of actual immortality, and that the point of life is not to avoid death, but to live now and live to the fullest.  I also loved the cinematography of the film, and thought it artistic and excellent.The flaws:1) They didn't need to push the romance stuff.  This was unnecessary, and offensive.  Although Jesse Tuck looked like a teenager, he was really 104, with 104 years of lived experience: it's nasty and inappropriate of him to be chasing after a 15 year old child.2) They made the man with the yellow suit too rotten as a human being.  That could have been toned way down, and the movie would have been much better for it.3) The man with the yellow suit made a good point, which the film's evil portrayal of him utterly obscured:  that the spring of immortality would have been much better handled under the care of someone more imaginative.  The Tucks had the spring for more than 85 years and did essentially nothing useful with it.  In reality, a truly creative person really might have done something amazing with immortality.  Even as a silly idea, imagine if they gave spring water to a fertile male and female animal of every species that was going extinct!4) Mae Tuck's rescue from jail by her sons became a ludicrous and unnecessary plot device.  The whole point of the Tucks' lives was to live below the radar -- and then, suddenly, for no good reason, they courted public disaster?  Stupid.  In reality they would have had Winnie Foster tell the police about how the man in the yellow suit was threatening to kill her with a gun and that Mae Tuck killed him to save her!  Simple, and true.  No need for pointless Hollywood shenanigans.5) Final stupid moment in the film:  when Miles Tuck admits to being a card shark and risks getting shot.  Totally ludicrous as it was completely out of character for him, going against everything he lived for.  The idea that people who had lived for over a century each would not learn to avoid such stupidity killed my suspension of disbelief.",3,"Almost as good as the book, but a few flaws",1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,2304,"['had', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'considering', 'how', 'commonly', 'Hollywood', 'important', 'books', 'drivel', 'am', 'pleased', 'just', 'how', 'surprised', 'was', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'changed', 'plot', 'gracefully', 'captured', 'essence', 'book', 'author', 'conception', 'horror', 'actual', 'immortality', 'point', 'life', 'not', 'avoid', 'death', 'live', 'now', 'live', 'fullest', 'also', 'loved', 'cinematography', 'film', 'thought', 'artistic', 'excellent.The', 'flaws:1', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'push', 'romance', 'stuff', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'offensive', 'Jesse', 'Tuck', 'looked', 'teenager', 'was', 'really', '104', '104', 'years', 'lived', 'experience', 'nasty', 'inappropriate', 'be', 'chasing', '15', 'year', 'old', 'child.2', 'made', 'man', 'yellow', 'suit', 'too', 'rotten', 'human', 'being', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'way', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'it.3', 'man', 'yellow', 'suit', 'made', 'good', 'point', 'film', 'evil', 'portrayal', 'utterly', 'obscured', 'spring', 'immortality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'handled', 'care', 'someone', 'more', 'imaginative', 'Tucks', 'had', 'spring', 'more', '85', 'years', 'did', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'useful', 'reality', 'truly', 'creative', 'person', 'really', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'amazing', 'immortality', 'Even', 'silly', 'idea', 'imagine', 'gave', 'spring', 'water', 'fertile', 'male', 'female', 'animal', 'species', 'was', 'going', 'extinct', '4', 'Mae', 'Tuck', 'rescue', 'jail', 'sons', 'became', 'ludicrous', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'device', 'whole', 'point', 'Tucks', 'lives', 'was', 'live', 'radar', 'then', 'suddenly', 'good', 'reason', 'courted', 'public', 'disaster', 'Stupid', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Winnie', 'Foster', 'tell', 'police', 'how', 'man', 'yellow', 'suit', 'was', 'threatening', 'kill', 'gun', 'Mae', 'Tuck', 'killed', 'save', 'Simple', 'true', 'need', 'pointless', 'Hollywood', 'shenanigans.5', 'Final', 'stupid', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Miles', 'Tuck', 'being', 'card', 'shark', 'risks', 'getting', 'shot', 'Totally', 'ludicrous', 'was', 'completely', 'character', 'going', 'everything', 'lived', 'idea', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'century', 'would', 'not', 'learn', 'avoid', 'such', 'stupidity', 'killed', 'suspension', 'disbelief']",N/A
602843,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B00005JLOS,David Bower,"[2, 2]","I've owned this movie now for over two years and have enjoyed watching it several times. The story is mostly laid back and peaceful but tells a powerful story and on occasion gets somewhat heavy. Other reviewers have summarized the story so I'll not do that again.What I'll do is comment on the basic premise of eternal life. Those of us familiar with the Genesis account of creation may recall that God expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden lest they eat of the tree of life and live forever. From my perspective that was an act of grace and mercy. Adam and Eve had just died spiritually and eternal life with a dead spirit was a fate not to be desired.God, in love, separated them from the danger of living forever with a dead, fallen spirit. When the time was right, God provided a way back to spiritual life through the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. A future is now available which includes both spiritual life and eternal life for all who accept God's solution; a much better alternative!Both Angus and Miles are given opportunities to relate their response to life without death, and express their sadness with the results; whether it is watching life go by, feeling like a rock, or watching loved ones age and change in a way not available to them, the prospects appeared rather dim and uninviting. Winnie is finally faced with the necessity of making a decision as to which way she should go; the answer to that closes the movie.The movie has a charming ambiance and is well acted, Alexis Bledel portrays Winnie with charm and innocence, Ben Kingsley does a good job as the unnamed ""man in the yellow suit,"" William Hurt as Angus, Sissy Spacek as Mae, Jonathan Jackson as Jesse, and Scott Bairstow as Miles are all effective in their roles.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[8, 11]","""Tuck Everlasting""'s message is simple but clear, and the almost fairy-tale execution of it is very compelling, very beautiful. Which is more important, to live forever or to live a rich but temporary life? If this movie doesn't entirely explore that, then it does a good job trying.Just before the first World War, Winnie Foster (Alexis Bledel) is the only child of affluent, snobby upper-class parents, who have already plotted her life out for her. But Winnie feels that her life is stifling, lacking in any fun or freedom at all. The last straw comes when her parents cheerfully tell her that she's leaving for a prison-like finishing school. Winnie runs off into the woods, and soon sees a young man, Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson) drinking from a little spring in a tree root.Jesse's brother (Scott Bairstow) brings Winnie back to their cabin, and soon Winnie becomes intrigued by their simple, carefree life. But the Tucks aren't just of a different social class -- thanks to the little spring under the tree, they are also immortal and unaging. And there is a strange man in a yellow suit (Ben Kingsley) who will go to great lengths to find and use that fountain of youth.One of the most gorgeous things about this film is the scenery -- the camerawork perfectly sets off the almost unreally beautiful forests and lakes. Direction is okay, not amazing -- some of the scenes can be predictable, such as the ""gravestone"" shot near the end. Dialogue is fairly good, although occasionally it sounds a bit too modern to be plausibly pre-World-War-II.The teen romance may put some viewers off, though its handling is never mushy or unreal; moreover, this movie acknowledges, as many don't, that sometimes love doesn't win. The biggest question may be how a 104-year-old boy would still have the mentality of a teen; however, since part of the spring's power is to keep people locked in one part of their life, that may be why. (I would also argue that any reviewers who call kids ""youngsters"" don't know what the kids will enjoy) And the darker moments are not soft-pedalled, such as the scene where Miles talks about what happened to his family when they refused the immortality he still has. That moment crystallizes the entire message of the movie, and Scott Bairstow is outstanding in it.Bledel is quite good as Winnie, and manages to convey very well the frustration of a smart girl who just wants to live a normal life. Jackson is also good, flipping between the poignant and happier moments. William Hurt and Sissy Spacek are also excellent as Jesse's parents, who live with the constant dread of discovery over them. Ben Kingsley was the one weak link; I kept expecting him to twirl his mustache and cackle at the camera.Most juvenile movies put out now are tepid and lacking in depth. While ""Tuck Everlasting"" isn't the deepest it could be, it's still outstandingly executed and well-acted.

Old fashioned in the best sense of the term, life-affirming, sentimental, finding the borders of credibility and celebrating them, and directed and acted with the sense of commitment that Jay Russell and his fine cast provided - put all of that together and it is close to impossible not to love this little movie.Natalie Babbitt's 1981 novel may have been meant for the young readers, but in the translation to the screen this story appeals to the young at heart: chronological age is not applicable.  The Tuck family happened upon a spring in a woods in the past, drank from the spring and voila! - the fountain of Ponce de Leon's obsession has been discovered.  This dear family (mother Sissy Spacek, father William Hurt, and sons Jesse (Jonathan Jackson) and Miles (Scott Bairstow) settles into the fortunes and inevitable sadnesses that accompany becoming immortal:  life's ebb and flow and the cycle of birth to death eludes them.  Man's quest for eternal youth has its sad aspects.Into the Tuck family secret woods happens Winnie (Alexis Bleidel), daughter of a wealthly family (mother Amy Irving and father Victor Garber), and encounters Jesse, slowly falls in love and learns the Tuck secret.  Meanwhile an evil yellow-coated man (Ben Kingsley) finds the fount of his own obsession, informs Winnie's family that she has been kidnapped by the Tuck family, and the only way to regain Winnie is to sell their woods (and of course its invaluable spring) to him.  How this all plays out - the inevitable capture of the Tucks and the way they resolve their immortal inaccessibility with Jesse's and Winnie's new found need for each other - serves as the ending and it is resolved well.The settings and acting and physical beauty of this film are matched by the understated but important moments of philosophy about what is the meaning of the cycle of life as we know it rather than as we think we would reshape it.  Some may label this film as corny or 'Hallmarky' and that is sad:  there is plenty of room in the celluloid world for fragments of sincere tenderness such as this.

Having seen some wonderful acting and some horrible acting in the past, and being involved in theater myself, I was very pleased with the quality of acting in this movie.  Nothing seemed to stand out as obviously fake, like in the Harry Potter movies (which I enjoyed, but not as much as I enjoyed the books).  The emotion, both Jesse's and Winnie's love and Miles' grief, were infinitely more genuine than most emotion I've seen in movies.  I am fascinated by both immortality and romance, and I found Tuck Everlasting to be perhaps the best combination of the two that I've ever seen.  While so many romance movies focus on sex, this movie's romance was a form of pure love that is a real treat.

But when these men put there respective brushes to paper they made the discussion, they would not paint the bad, but the world as they thought it should be.  They would create loving if flawed characters and happy endings.  The world of Tuck Everlasting is not real. It is a world of eternal springtime where adorable couples literally run through fields of flowers and fawns come up to be petted.  It would be a quite unbearable world if such films and stories were simply put aside as being too silly or unbelievable, who needs reality, we have reality.  We go to the movies sometimes for fantasy and for escape.  Meet Winnie, the child of loving but unintentionally cruel parents who want what's best for there only child, but who are clueless as to what she really needs,  they decide to send her to a prison for girls where she will be abused until she behaves in a way that suits them, for her own good of course, such situations are always difficult, you can't dislike parents who care for there children and make the effort and sacrifice to do what's best, no  doubt at considerable emotional pain themselves.  But you cannot forgive people who are fundamentally selfish and cannot accept the  there child is a person, not a pet, parents care for there children, but they do not own them.  Whinny's parents are unreasonable and cannot accept there child as an individual with feelings and opinions. They would have crushed her soul to meet there idea of the perfect daughter,but this is Disney, thank God.  In Disney's world we know that mom and dad will come around, that there daughter will find herself and be happy, that they all will be.  She runs off and meets a just too handsome young man and they spend a lot of time being just too damn happy. The young actress who plays Whiney is just perfect, she does not act so much as stand there and shimmer like some sort of living jewel, she is simply perfect. Of course there is a complication, a bad guy, and a wonderful happy ending which Walt Disney himself would have been so very proud of.

My students mentioned it often however, and as an instructor of Greek mythology, I became curious about the story when I learned its basic premise was immortality. (I have been told that there was much less a love interest between the teenagers in the book, however this emendation certainly lends a magical spark to the timeless story.) Upon seeing the movie, I can recommend it not only for its excellent treatment of this subject, but also as a film the whole family can enjoy and discuss afterward.In brief, this is the story of those (the family Tuck) who would seek to live forever. Unlike the mythological Tithonius however, who was granted everlasting life without eternal youth, the Tuck family becomes immortal from the moment they drink of the mystical pool at the foot of an ancient tree--a tree that will lend a poignant and touching climax to the end of the film.Suffice it to say, the acting is wonderful. High profile heavyweights such as Ben Kingsley, Sissy Spacek and William Hurt give predictable sterling performances. Victor Garber (Alias; Annie) is also excellent as the wealthy father. But Alexis Bledel (Gilmore Girls) as Winnie Foster is simply disarming. She is convincing and superb in her effort to balance her desire for love in a life outside of time, with her responsibility to live the life intended for her. The talent of the cast, as well as the curiosity of the storyline makes for few dull moments, and the conclusion left me with one wet Kleenex!This is a beautiful film--from the scenery, to the music, to the performances, to the plot. Yes, it might be simplistic and predictable, but it would take a crusty old grinch to say that this ninety minutes wasn't thoroughly delightful, and time well spent.In the end, the age-old questions remain--is immortality all we would dream it to be? Is it quantity, or quality of life that is important? Does living forever make one unique and privileged, or does it (as Tuck would say) make one merely a rock stuck in a mud bank beside a flowing stream? And where does love fit into this equation? Is being given the love of your life, or loving the life you're given the more appropriate choice? The answer is found in Winnie's final decision on whether or not to drink from the eternal pool--a decision I could not have made.",5,"""Captivating Tale of Love, Immortality, and Choices We Make""",1035072000,"10 20, 2002",2002,2365,"['Even', 'teach', 'middle', 'school', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'students', 'mentioned', 'often', 'however', 'instructor', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'became', 'curious', 'story', 'when', 'learned', 'basic', 'premise', 'was', 'immortality', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'love', 'interest', 'teenagers', 'book', 'however', 'emendation', 'certainly', 'magical', 'spark', 'timeless', 'story', 'seeing', 'movie', 'can', 'recommend', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'treatment', 'subject', 'also', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'discuss', 'afterward.In', 'brief', 'story', 'family', 'Tuck', 'who', 'would', 'seek', 'live', 'forever', 'mythological', 'Tithonius', 'however', 'who', 'was', 'granted', 'everlasting', 'life', 'eternal', 'youth', 'Tuck', 'family', 'immortal', 'moment', 'drink', 'mystical', 'pool', 'foot', 'ancient', 'tree', 'tree', 'will', 'lend', 'poignant', 'touching', 'climax', 'end', 'film.Suffice', 'say', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'High', 'profile', 'heavyweights', 'such', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'William', 'Hurt', 'give', 'predictable', 'sterling', 'performances', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Alias', 'Annie', 'also', 'excellent', 'wealthy', 'father', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Winnie', 'Foster', 'simply', 'disarming', 'convincing', 'superb', 'effort', 'balance', 'desire', 'love', 'life', 'time', 'responsibility', 'live', 'life', 'intended', 'talent', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'curiosity', 'storyline', 'few', 'dull', 'moments', 'conclusion', 'left', 'one', 'wet', 'Kleenex', 'beautiful', 'film', 'scenery', 'music', 'performances', 'plot', 'Yes', 'might', 'be', 'simplistic', 'predictable', 'would', 'take', 'crusty', 'old', 'grinch', 'say', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'time', 'well', 'end', 'age-old', 'questions', 'remain', 'immortality', 'would', 'dream', 'be', 'quantity', 'quality', 'life', 'important', 'living', 'forever', 'make', 'one', 'unique', 'privileged', 'Tuck', 'would', 'say', 'make', 'one', 'merely', 'rock', 'stuck', 'mud', 'bank', 'flowing', 'stream', 'where', 'love', 'fit', 'equation', 'being', 'given', 'love', 'life', 'loving', 'life', ""'re"", 'given', 'more', 'appropriate', 'choice', 'answer', 'found', 'Winnie', 'final', 'decision', 'not', 'drink', 'eternal', 'pool', 'decision', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'made']",N/A

602867,AWK4E3IB6SWEE,B00005JLOS,"Karusichan ""Karusichan""","[4, 6]","After reading Natalie Babbitt's ""Tuck Everlasting""  I decided I should watch the film, just to see how it compared. I admit, this is generally a bad idea as films can never quite match the images that come up in one's imagination,  however I enjoy doing this after reading a book. Even if it does not match I feel it forever crystallizes the novel in my head.Well, there were varying differences of success with this adaptation, which I will attempt to talk about. One glaringly obvious change was Winnie's age, which in the film was altered from a young girl of ten years to a young woman of 16 or 17. It was obvious that this change was made so that Disney could amp up the love story between her and Jesse, and so much of that was done that it took up a large portion of the movie, whereas in the book it was a small detail that was innocent moments here and there between the two characters.Another difference seemed to come with the character of Miles Tuck, who seemed more brooding and destructive in the film than in the book. For those who don't know Miles has a lot to suffer for, as he had married at a younger point in his life, and then lost his family when the truth of his immortality was revealed to his bride. In the book this made him a rather somber character, and a sympathetic one, but it was mostly because he feels rather... deflated, I guess would be a good word. He seems saddened about the whole thing, but because he has had time (60 some years) to think about his family his feelings are tempered, and all of the angry edges seemed to be taken down. Miles in the film is still upset about his wife leaving, actually, he is still downright angry about her leaving. There is no relief, no acceptance, he is just ticked off to no end... and this difference makes him a less sympathetic character (to me, at least) because he desires nothing more than to harm himself over the whole thing, as proved by a card game he indulges in at one point in the film. To me this masochistic streak was unnecessary, as Babbitt so elegantly wrote his pain to be present, but tolerable, because (as the old adage goes) time heals all wounds, and Miles is proof of that statement to a tee.Another change comes with Jesse Tuck himself, who is still his adventurous self only now he seems more hell-bent on being anywhere his family is not. This may just be that he is a young man (despite the 87 years of immortality) and he simply desires to see the world and what he can do in it, but his motives seem more selfish and less... puckish than the Jesse in the book (who reminded me of a Mark Twain character, Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn, more so than an adventurer). The Father, Angus, feels different too, as he seemed to have more of a death wish in the book and this was diminished in the film I suppose to make him more appealing and less dark.There were enjoyable elements of the film, don't get me wrong. The basic plot is still there, but I was so much a fan of the way the characters were written that I was naturally disappointed by these alterations. I loved the scene in the waterfall pool, where Jesse and Winnie are swimming together, as well as the jailbreak scene in the end... and even some of the romantic moments added were not bad, but I do feel as if this movie suffers purely because I so loved the book. The casting isn't horrible, it's pretty dead on (except for Winnie who feels out of place simply because of the whole age difference), but the changes to the characters make it a not perfect film for me.

This is a great movie for females of all ages, but would probably especially touch 11-14 year old girls.Reasons I liked it:1. Great romance story (with only hand-holding and a sweet kiss)2. Good acting, no crazy over-the-top acting or characters (I hate when they throw in that zany character in so many films for 'comic relief'!)3. Beautiful film to watch, great landscapes, very crisp, bright, and green with nature4. Hardly any violence to speak of (I like tons of movies with violence, but must every movie, both adult and family, like even Disney animation, have violence?  We could use more movies without it.)5. Great looking actors, especially the guy in the romantic lead-- he alone would have made this a favorite movie when I was younger!Some frustrations with the film would be the Tuck dad making it sound like you're not really living if your life is everlasting, that they're 'rocks' and people should live life.  They seemed like they were pretty darn happy together (the wife seem to yearn for more people in her life, but at least had a great marriage and children), and the boys came and went on various adventures.  The Tucks seemed living enough to me!  I'm trying to tell myself that that speech was him only trying to discourage her from becoming everlasting herself, since it would be a challenge to have her join them (her family rich and forever searching, and just taking her away from her family, etc.).  I would have liked these issues explored better because I'm not convinced by what he said, if he really meant it.Also, I believe the beginning said that the mom met the boys in town every ten years-- ten years?  I hope I heard wrong, because I don't care how long you live, you'd think loved ones would get together far more often than that.And, finally, where did the boys get the money to travel to Paris and such?  Where did the parents get their food and clothes, since no one in town knew them, and with what money?I never read the book, so I'm not sure if these points are in the book, but whether they are or aren't, the movie should stand alone and add some of these details, whether in the book or not, to mesh out the story, even if it was in brief conversation with the girl and boy.But I did enjoy the movie enough to want to purchase it (I rented it) and hope when my daughter is older that she'll love it.",4,Good film for young women,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,2425,"['am', '31', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'when', 'was', '13', 'great', 'movie', 'females', 'ages', 'would', 'probably', 'especially', 'touch', '11-14', 'year', 'old', 'girls.Reasons', 'liked', 'it:1', 'Great', 'romance', 'story', 'only', 'hand-holding', 'sweet', 'kiss', '2', 'Good', 'acting', 'crazy', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'characters', 'hate', 'when', 'throw', 'zany', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'films', ""'comic"", 'relief', '3', 'Beautiful', 'film', 'watch', 'great', 'landscapes', 'very', 'crisp', 'bright', 'green', 'nature4', 'Hardly', 'violence', 'speak', 'like', 'tons', 'movies', 'violence', 'must', 'movie', 'adult', 'family', 'even', 'Disney', 'animation', 'have', 'violence', 'could', 'use', 'more', 'movies', 'it.', '5', 'Great', 'looking', 'actors', 'especially', 'guy', 'romantic', 'lead', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'favorite', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'frustrations', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Tuck', 'dad', 'making', 'sound', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'living', 'life', 'everlasting', ""'re"", ""'rocks"", 'people', 'should', 'live', 'life', 'seemed', 'were', 'pretty', 'darn', 'happy', 'together', 'wife', 'seem', 'yearn', 'more', 'people', 'life', 'least', 'had', 'great', 'marriage', 'children', 'boys', 'came', 'went', 'various', 'adventures', 'Tucks', 'seemed', 'living', 'enough', ""'m"", 'trying', 'tell', 'speech', 'was', 'only', 'trying', 'discourage', 'becoming', 'everlasting', 'would', 'be', 'challenge', 'have', 'join', 'family', 'rich', 'forever', 'searching', 'just', 'taking', 'away', 'family', 'etc.', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'issues', 'explored', 'better', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'what', 'said', 'really', 'meant', 'it.Also', 'believe', 'beginning', 'said', 'mom', 'met', 'boys', 'town', 'ten', 'years', 'ten', 'years', 'hope', 'heard', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'long', 'live', ""'d"", 'think', 'loved', 'ones', 'would', 'get', 'together', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'that.And', 'finally', 'where', 'did', 'boys', 'get', 'money', 'travel', 'Paris', 'such', 'Where', 'did', 'parents', 'get', 'food', 'clothes', 'one', 'town', 'knew', 'what', 'money', 'never', 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'points', 'are', 'book', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'movie', 'should', 'stand', 'alone', 'add', 'details', 'book', 'not', 'mesh', 'out', 'story', 'even', 'was', 'brief', 'conversation', 'girl', 'boy.But', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'enough', 'want', 'purchase', 'rented', 'hope', 'when', 'daughter', 'older', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A

There she meets a young boy Jesse Tuck drinking from a spring. Wanting a drink herself, Jesse stops her and the mystery of the Tuck family is unravled as Winnie is brought to the Tuck's home and told their secret--by drinking from the spring they will never age, never die. They are blessed and cursed with immortality.I really liked how the movie discusses issues of death and life. Tuck describes that being immortal is not part of life because along with life there is death. The two conicide with each other. And their family is somewhere stuck in the middle.If you have read the book their are subtle differences in the movie. Winnie is 10 in the book and made 15 in the movie.

Bernabo,"[4, 4]","Despite the impressive cast of adult actors assembled for the 2002 film version of ""Tuck Everlasting,"" this adaptation of Natalie Babbit's novel is clearly geared for adolescents.  By that I mean that older viewers can easily get caught up in identifying problems with the story from an adult perspective, while younger viewers will be focused on imagining what it would be like to be confronted with the choice that faces Winnie Foster (Alexis Bledel), the only child of a wealthy family living in a town in upstate New York on the even of the First World War.  Winnie wants to be a tomboy, or at least a normal young girl, but her life is as strictly controlled as her body is by the corset her mother (Amy Irving) insists she wear.  One day she is told by her father (Victor Garber) that she will be sent away to a boarding school, so Winnie runs away, deep into the woods where she meets handsome young Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson).Unfortunately, the Tuck family is hiding out in the deep woods, and they cannot afford to have anybody know where they are, even young Winnie.  So she is brought back to the family home, where Jesse lives with his parents, Mae (Sissy Spacek) and Angus (William Hurt), and his brother,  Miles (Scott Bairstow).  In good time she learns the family secret: a century ago the Tucks discovered a small spring in the woods.  They drank from the sweet waters and found out that they no longer aged and had become invulnerable.  In other words, they are immortals.  But there is someone out there, a strange man wearing a yellow suit (Ben Kingsley), who has been on their trail and is obviously interested in the magic waters that make life everlasting.  With everyone looking for the missing Winnie, the life the Tuck family has been living might be coming to an end, even if their lives do not.The choice for Winnie is whether she should drink from the spring and stay young forever with Jeese, who is really 104, or live a mortal life.  Miles thinks it is a bad idea.  He fell in love once, married, and had two children.  But when his wife learned his secret she became convinced he had made a pact with the devil and left Miles, taking his children.  Would Miles have shared the water with them at some point?  What point would he have picked?  Miles is planning to enlist when the Great War begins because he longs to die, even though he knows he cannot be killed.This is where the adult mind, weaned on countless horror films, takes over and comes up with lots of ways of granting Miles his wish (none of which I will share with you here).  But ""Tuck Everlasting"" is not about the real world, even if that is where Babbitt sets her tale, and the point here is not about looking backwards, but looking forward.  It is Angus Tuck who makes the most important points to young Winnie.  Angus knows that people will do just about anything not to die, but finds it more important that ""they'll do anythng to keep from living their life.""  More importantly, he does not consider what the Tucks have to be called ""living,"" comparing it to being ""like rocks, stuck at the side of a stream.""  In the end, Angus' sage advice is for her not be afraid of death, but to ""Be afraid of the unlived life.""Again, the adult is quick to point out that Angus does not have to be living in a home in the woods.  He can go disappear in the teaming cities of America or anywhere else in the world, moving from place to place often enough for no one to suspect the truth (that is what his sons do).  But the kids are looking at this one from the perspective of Winnie and Jesse.  After all, Jesse not only looks like he is 17 but acts like it as well (Is this the first time he has been in love or is Winnie special?  Only adults will care).  I wonder what Mae thinks about the life she is living, but no one ever bothers to ask her.""Tuck Everlasting"" is sweetly romantic.  The kissing is fairly chaste and the most romantic moment has the winsome Bledel as the young Winnie dancing by firelight.  The screenplay of Babbitt's novel is by Jeffrey Lieber, creator of this year's new television series ""Lost,"" and James V. Hart, who did the screenplay for ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" and I am told that the romantic elements are more developed here than in the novel.  Still, the innocent romance seems in keeping with the rest of the story.  The fate of the Tucks becomes the focal point of the film's climax, but the resolution still has to do with Winnie's choice.If young viewers are still not clear about the point of this film, then they can avail themselves of the ""Lessons Of Tuck"" feature on the DVD.  This special viewing mode allows kids to switch from the film to special segments that explore the themes and issues of the movie with actor Jonathan Jackson, other cast members, and some regular kids.  Other DVD features include a pair of commentary tracks, the first with director Jay Russell and screenwriter James V. Hart and the second with Russell and the three young cast members, Jackson, Bledel and Bairstow.  Finally there is a featurette that visits with author Natalie Babbitt, which looks more at her entire career as a writer and artist of children's literature and not ""Tuck Everlasting"" in particular.",4,"If you could choose to live forever, would you?",1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,5233,"['impressive', 'cast', 'adult', 'actors', 'assembled', '2002', 'film', 'version', 'Tuck',

Although there was some artistic license taken with the book, it is nothing that takes away from its central theme. The changes actually serve it well, and Disney has done a masterful job in creating another beautiful family film.The film takes place in the early twentieth century, just when cars are coming into use. The film revolves around fifteen year old Winnifred ""Winnie"" Foster (Alexis Bledel), daughter of wealthy socialites, and the mysterious Tuck family, who lives deep in the woods owned by the Fosters.  It seems that Winnie is an independent sort of gal who is chafing under the restrictions imposed by her prim and proper parents (Victor Garber and Amy Irving). While wandering on her own in those very same woods one day, lost and thirsty, she comes across seventeen year old Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson), who is drinking from a small spring of water. When she wants to follow suit, he stops her from drinking. She also comes across his older, bitter brother, Miles Tuck (Scott Bairstow), who basically takes her by force deep into the woods to where the Tuck cabin is hidden. There, Winnie meets the boys' parents, Mae (Sissy Spacek) and Angus Tuck (William Hurt).The Tucks are initially flummoxed by Winnie's appearance in their midst, but Mae Tuck reassures her that she will be returned unharmed to her parents, once they are sure that she can be trusted. During her short sojourn with the Tucks, Winnie finds herself enjoying the time spent with the Tucks, especially with Jesse. Winnie begins to fall in love with Jesse and he with her. Gradually, she learns the mystery that binds the Tucks. In the meantime, a sinister man in a yellow suit (Ben Kingsley) has tracked the Tucks to their cabin in the woods, as he suspects what their secret is and wants it for himself, so that he may exploit it for profit. When he poses a danger to Winnie, Mae takes action that forces her to do something that she would rather not have had to do. This places the Tucks in a quandary, as the Fosters believe that they had kidnapped Winnie, based upon information previously given to them by the man in the yellow suit.  The outside world suddenly intrudes upon the Tuck family in a way that would eventually lead to their secret being revealed to all and sundry. Winnie helps them to keep their secret, leaving her to make a life defining decision.Director Jay Carroll has directed a film that is simply wonderful, both magical and philosophical. He has a first class cast that conveys the story in a way of which the author of the book may be proud. The performances are simply stellar. Alexis Bledel  is delightful as Winnifred ""Winnie"" Foster, reminding me of a very young Winona Ryder.  Jonathan Jackson is terrific as the boyish, good looking Jesse, and has, undoubtedly, acquired a following of young girls, as a result of this film. Sissy Spacek is as always superlative, imbuing the character of Mae with a warmth and sensitivity that makes one root for her, when an apparent injustice has transpired. William Hurt gives a thoughtful performance as the patriarch of the star-crossed Tuck clan. Scott Bairstow's performance is a little on the strident side, but effective, nonetheless. Kudos go to Amy Irving and Victor Garber as Mr. and Mrs. Foster, Winnie's restrictive, blue-blood parents. Ben Kingsley is suitably sinister as the man in the yellow suit who threatens to take the secret of the Tuck family up a disastrous path.This is a heartwarming and tender film with a lovely and haunting musical score. It is a film that will simply delight viewers, It is rated ""PG"", but its innocence serves to underscore some of its philosophically potent, underlying themes. The film provides much food for thought  and has a depth that is surprising. It is a film that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[8, 8]","Bear with me for just a moment, because I'm going to talk about another movie that has a great deal of relevance to this movie. Remember the original ""Highlander"" movie with Christopher Lambert? Remember the portion from the beginning until Heather (played by Beatie Edney) died of old age? Remember the glorious song ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" by Queen playing in the background as we fast forward through the years of Heather and Conner MacLeod's life? ""Tuck Everlasting"" is another version of this same tale.Probably the biggest difference between ""Highlander"" and ""Tuck Everlasting"" is that the former was definitely not a family movie, and while there was a significant love story, the movie was primarily a fantasy or sword & sorcery. ""Tuck Everlasting"" is a family movie, and the central aspect of the movie is the love between Jessie Tuck and Winnie Foster. In both movies the man is immortal, regardless of the source of that immortality, and the woman either suffers from the man's immortality, as in the case of Heather MacLeod, or she chooses to live the life she was given to the fullest. Both stories are poignant.Winnie Foster is a young girl starting to strain at the leash that her parents have attached to her. When Winnie meets the Tuck family, she finds a freedom she did not know existed. The lure of a relatively rule-free life is always tempting, regardless of time and society. ""Tuck Everlasting"" thoroughly sets up the comparison between the Tuck's life of freedom and the rule-bound society in which virtually everyone else lives. However, that contrast also considers the drawbacks of the Tuck's lives, and the advantages that Winnie could enjoy in her life.Of course, in all movies where there is a love story and a choice must be made between alternatives, one of which is the love the characters have for each other, we know that somewhere someone must give up something. Regardless of what one gives up, there will always be a sense of loss for what the alternatives might have been.This movie is very suitable for family members of all ages. There is some violence, but it is generally mild, and a good opportunity to ask the younger members of the family whether the violence was appropriate or inappropriate to the circumstances. Another good question for discussion is what choices each person might have made under similar circumstances.The filmography is very good; Disney is regaining their reputation for making quality family films.

602878,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLOS,Matthew Horner,"[1, 4]","""Tuck Everlasting"" is based on the best-selling children's book by Natalie Babbitt. It is a meticulous production, filled with beautiful cinematography and lovely sets. While it does not quite capture the magic of the novel [perhaps no film could], it does capture the book's main message. [Can't say more without spoiling the plot.] Overall, this is fine family entertainment.The story takes place in a small American town around 1915. Winnie Foster [Alexis Bledel] is the richest but unhappiest girl in town. Her parents are planning to send her far away to a girls' finishing school. The mansion the family lives in is surrounded by thousands of acres of woods, all owned by the Fosters. Deep within these woods lives the Tuck family, so reclusive that everyone seems to have forgotten that they exist. One sunny day Winnie goes for walk in the forest and gets lost. She stumbles upon the handsome young Jesse Tuck [Jonathan Jackson] who is startled both by her presence and her beauty. The rest of the family is less thrilled by her arrival because they have a deep, dark secret. They must decide whether to keep her with them or let her go. Meanwhile, the mysterious Man in the Yellow Suit [Ben Kingsley], who has been tracking the Tucks for years, is close at hand. He knows their secret and will do anything to find them.The main focus of the movie is on Bledel and Jackson, who do a fine job, especially considering that the cast includes much more experienced acting heavyweights at Kingsley, Sissy Spacek and William Hurt.""Tuck Everlasting"" doesn't rank as a classic family movie, but it is lovely to look at and quite entertaining.",4,"Well made family film, charming and emtertaining",1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,1642,"['Tuck', 'Everlasting', 'based', 'best-selling', 'children', 'book', 'Natalie', 'Babbitt', 'meticulous', 'production', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'lovely', 'sets', 'not', 'quite', 'capture', 'magic', 'novel', '[', 'perhaps', 'film', 'could', ']', 'capture', 'book', 'main', 'message', '[', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'spoiling', 'plot', ']', 'Overall', 'fine', 'family', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'American', 'town', '1915', 'Winnie', 'Foster', '[', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', ']', 'richest', 'unhappiest', 'girl', 'town', 'parents', 'are', 'planning', 'send', 'far', 'away', 'girls', 'finishing', 'school', 'mansion', 'family', 'surrounded', 'thousands', 'acres', 'woods', 'owned', 'Fosters', 'Deep', 'woods', 'Tuck', 'family', 'so', 'reclusive', 'everyone', 'have', 'forgotten', 'exist', 'One', 'sunny', 'day', 'Winnie', 'walk', 'forest', 'lost', 'handsome', 'young', 'Jesse', 'Tuck', '[', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', ']', 'who', 'startled', 'presence', 'beauty', 'rest', 'family', 'less', 'thrilled', 'arrival', 'have', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'must', 'decide', 'keep', 'let', 'go', 'Meanwhile', 'mysterious', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'Suit', '[', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', ']', 'who', 'been', 'tracking', 'Tucks', 'years', 'close', 'hand', 'secret', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'find', 'them.The', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'Bledel', 'Jackson', 'who', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'especially', 'considering', 'cast', 'much', 'more', 'experienced', 'acting', 'heavyweights', 'Kingsley', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Tuck', 'Everlasting', ""n't"", 'rank', 'classic', 'family', 'movie', 'lovely', 'look', 'quite', 'entertaining']",N/A

602881,A2BHWOS5PUGU78,B00005JLOS,Mercy Bell,"[2, 4]","Like the book, Tuck Everlasting proves odd fare for the audience it would generically be made for. Considering it was techincally made for 9-11 year olds, it's incredible, and applaudable, for a so called ""generic Disney family film"" to be so intelligent, thought provoking, and high quality. It's a real ""family"" film as opposed to the empty fare most movies of the same nature are. It can be slightly macabre, gently philosophical, and ponderous; it IS gentle, slow moving, and quiet, and believe it or not, it proves to be a somewhat mesmerizing, magical, other-worldly experience: lyrical and haunting folk strained music sifts through the scenery, in this case the magically captured springtime woodlands of Maryland where it was filmed, a believable and genuinely played young love romance, and the storybook-like narration from Elizabeth Shue provide an almost unbelievably pretty setting which we're immersed in....And it certainly isn't a bad thing. The rest of the film is much the same. A briefing to the plot of the book: The Tucks have immortality a la a hidden spring, Winnie Foster stumbles onto it, they kidnap her but ultimately teach her about the grim facts and joys life, and then a number of fast paced, short fuse adventures ensue, eventually leaving us with an ending that makes a lot of people cry. That's the book, and the movie is almost exactly the same. Some liberal changes, but the characters are there, completely.Jay Russell, the director, must have been faced with an odd dilemma, turn what was already a heavy duty little fable into a tale that would please the enigma: the ever spoiled audience...and ""Tuck"" seems to float at it's own pace. It moves at an unusual speed for films these days, it just strolls along lovingly and thoughtfully, with some tense moments here and there, until the last 30 minutes or so, where everything falls into place with help from those exciting escapades. Then they use the last few shots of the film to induce one to tears in a way you wouldn't expect, by utilizing the hefty amount of previous movie where the characters, as they do in the storyline, merely ""existed"". It's smart, and it works, and the result is beautiful, if not bittersweet and heartbreaking.Having said that, the film isn't staggeringly amazing in it's style or it's performances or it's script. Some of the camerawork didn't do anything for me, and the editing was a bit...off. The direction isn't anything Oscarworthy, but after all it's a family film, but not a generic one. Other than the absolutely stunning cinematography AND gorgeous, haunting score AND the great costumes AND production design (these last two aspects help the feel of the film greatly, in a film that relies on ""feel"" and that tangibility a great deal), the beauty of the film lies in it's sincerety and its simplicity, it's message and it's moral, and it's hefty handful of purely breathtaking and wonderful moments...and what I though was a truly beautiful ending.Bledel (plays Winnie Foster) and Jackson (plays Jesse Tuck) have a chemistry, Jackson is truly capable at playing a wonderfully likeable and serious young fellow, and makes you want to run off with him and listen. Likewise Bledel does a great job with balancing a film on her shoulders, considering it's her film debut as opposed to her vastly different role and setting on ""Gilmore Girls"". As for the highly plugged ""Oscar nominated cast"", Kingsley is the standout with all the nuances you could possibly need and a performance that is downright creepy. Though Hurt and Spacek get very little screentime, they provide a familiarity and stability to the film, giving it a backbone so to speak. Just to see them in the background and to know they are there helps create a mood and atmosphere about their home and the Tucks' personalities . The rest of the cast, Garber, Irving, and Bairstow, are fairly capable, with Irving leading the pack.This is a wonderful film. Quite brave considering all the flash and dash and raucousness of most films for the ""teen/kid"" age group these days. See it to bring your kids to a wholesome, mature-minded film that won't ruin YOUR ear drums, to get your mind off of everything else, to wax nostalgia, or gawk at pretty things and interesting ideas. It gives room to think and to daze in a bucolic setting with a wonderful passionate story about life.",5,Beautiful family tale about living life and understanding it,1034294400,"10 11, 2002",2002,4366,"['book', 'Tuck', 'Everlasting', 'odd', 'fare', 'audience', 'would', 'generically', 'be', 'made', 'Considering', 'was', 'techincally', 'made', '9-11', 'year', 'olds', 'incredible', 'applaudable', 'so', 'called', 'generic', 'Disney', 'family', 'film', 'be', 'so', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'high', 'quality', 'real', 'family', 'film', 'opposed', 'empty', 'fare', 'most', 'movies', 'same', 'nature', 'are', 'can', 'be', 'slightly', 'macabre', 'gently', 'philosophical', 'ponderous', 'gentle', 'slow', 'moving', 'quiet', 'believe', 'not', 'be', 'somewhat', 'mesmerizing', 'magical', 'other-worldly', 'experience', 'lyrical', 'haunting', 'folk', 'strained', 'music', 'sifts', 'scenery', 'case', 'magically', 'captured', 'springtime', 'woodlands', 'Maryland', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'believable', 'genuinely', 'played', 'young', 'love', 'romance', 'storybook-like', 'narration', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'provide', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'pretty', 'setting', ""'re"", 'immersed', '.And', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'rest', 'film', 'much', 'same', 'briefing', 'plot', 'book', 'Tucks', 'have', 'immortality', 'la', 'hidden', 'spring', 'Winnie', 'Foster', 'kidnap', 'ultimately', 'teach', 'grim', 'facts', 'joys', 'life', 'then', 'number', 'fast', 'paced', 'short', 'fuse', 'ensue', 'eventually', 'leaving', 'ending', 'lot', 'people', 'cry', 'book', 'movie', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'liberal', 'changes', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'completely.Jay', 'Russell', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'faced', 'odd', 'dilemma', 'turn', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'heavy', 'duty', 'little', 'fable', 'tale', 'would', 'please', 'enigma', 'ever', 'spoiled', 'audience', 'Tuck', 'float', 'own', 'pace', 'unusual', 'speed', 'films', 'days', 'just', 'along', 'lovingly', 'thoughtfully', 'tense', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'where', 'everything', 'place', 'help', 'exciting', 'escapades', 'Then', 'use', 'last', 'few', 'shots', 'film', 'induce', 'one', 'tears', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'utilizing', 'hefty', 'amount', 'previous', 'movie', 'where', 'characters', 'do', 'storyline', 'merely', 'existed', 'smart', 'result', 'beautiful', 'not', 'bittersweet', 'heartbreaking.Having', 'said', 'film', ""n't"", 'staggeringly', 'amazing', 'style', 'performances', 'script', 'camerawork', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'editing', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'direction', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Oscarworthy', 'family', 'film', 'not', 'generic', 'one', 'Other', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'AND', 'gorgeous', 'haunting', 'score', 'great', 'costumes', 'production', 'design', 'last', 'two', 'aspects', 'help', 'feel', 'film', 'greatly', 'film', 'feel', 'tangibility', 'great', 'deal', 'beauty', 'film', 'sincerety', 'simplicity', 'message', 'moral', 'hefty', 'handful', 'purely', 'breathtaking', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'what', 'though', 'was', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'ending.Bledel', 'Winnie', 'Foster', 'Jackson', 'Jesse', 'Tuck', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Jackson', 'truly', 'capable', 'playing', 'wonderfully', 'likeable', 'serious', 'young', 'fellow', 'want', 'run', 'off', 'listen', 'Likewise', 'Bledel', 'great', 'job', 'balancing', 'film', 'shoulders', 'considering', 'film', 'debut', 'opposed', 'vastly', 'different', 'role', 'setting', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'highly', 'plugged', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'cast', 'Kingsley', 'standout', 'nuances', 'could', 'possibly', 'need', 'performance', 'downright', 'creepy', 'Hurt', 'Spacek', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'screentime', 'provide', 'familiarity', 'stability', 'film', 'giving', 'backbone', 'so', 'speak', 'Just', 'see', 'background', 'know', 'are', 'there', 'helps', 'create', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'home', 'Tucks', 'personalities', 'rest', 'cast', 'Garber', 'Irving', 'Bairstow', 'are', 'fairly', 'capable', 'Irving', 'leading', 'pack.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Quite', 'brave', 'considering', 'flash', 'dash', 'raucousness', 'most', 'films', 'teen/kid', 'age', 'group', 'days', 'See', 'bring', 'kids', 'wholesome', 'mature-minded', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'YOUR', 'ear', 'drums', 'get', 'mind', 'everything', 'else', 'wax', 'nostalgia', 'gawk', 'pretty', 'things', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'room', 'think', 'daze', 'bucolic', 'setting', 'wonderful', 'passionate', 'story', 'life']",N/A

602883,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00005JLOS,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[86, 97]","""Tuck Everlasting"" is the (near-perfect) movie adaptation of Natalie Babbitt's classic novel about a young girl who meets a family immortals.  If you are looking for a nice family movie or love story, Disney's ""Tuck Everlasting"" is a fine selection for your viewing pleasure.THE STORY:Winnie Foster, daughter of a wealthy couple, ventures off into her family's woods one day and comes across a mysterious boy, Jesse, and his family, the Tucks, who seem to be ""lost in time.""  Feeling trapped herself in her ""too prim and proper"" for her family, Winnie feels liberated with the carefree lifestyle of the Tucks.  However, the Tuck family secret is something that can very well, and nearly does, bring Winnie's world crumbling down in front of her very eyes.THE DISCUSSION:""Tuck Everlasting"" has long been at the top of the list of books the school system loves to have students read, and for very good reason.  The story, very carefree but at times a little deep and occasionally dark, provides good discussion fodder on issues such as life and changing society values.  Winnie's conflict with her parents' values as well as the ramifications of ""eternal life"" make great fodder for discussion and meditation.Overall, the movie contains all the great things you could look for in both a love story and a family movie.  The relationship between Winnie and Jesse should have most couples all ""warm and fuzzy"" (or ill to their gut).  The movie overall is very light and easy and should be enjoyable for anyone. The violence level is kept to a minimum and the ""darker"" elements of the story are tame enough to where it shouldn't upset anyone.THE ADAPTATION:Movies based on books are double-edged swords.  They either ruin the ""meaning"" of the books they seek to praise or they themselves become masterpieces (like Harry Potter and Jurassic Park).  ""Tuck Everlasting"" falls into the latter category.  I myself read Babbitt's book in elementary and though it's been 16 years I still remember the book quite well.  As far as I can tell, this movie was about as true an adaptation as you can get.  The main themes and event sequences are translated well onto the big screen.  Fans of the book should appreciate this movie.BEST SCENES:1. Miles' story.  This is a very powerful scene that touches very well on the ""eternal life"" issue.  This scene could easily win an award.2. Jail Break.  Hilarious scene!!!3. Tuck's Talk with Winnie4. Jesse and Winnie's adventuresTHE VERDICT:Overall, this movie is a great choice for young couples on a date or family's looking for a nice, clean movie.  Yes indeed my friends, it's a chick flick!!!

602884,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JLOS,Only-A-Child,"[2, 4]","Nicely filmed and intelligently conceived (based on Natalie Babbitt's novel), Disney's ""Tuck Everlasting"" works on enough levels to make it an entertaining film for the whole family. Unfortunately it gets bogged down in sentimentality and spends less time dealing with the many issues it raises, making it less substantial than Bobbitt's original. The classic Disney feel is there, with sweet emotions, pleasant vistas, and good-natured simple characters; the sweet Mrs. Tuck (Sissy Spacek) and the reserved but good-hearted Mr. Tuck (William Hurt). The Tucks and their two sons hold the secret of immortality, which they have found to be both a blessing and a curse.""Tuck Everlasting"" is set mostly in early 20th century America and is told through the point of view of Winifred Foster (Alexis Bledel), a 15 year-old girl who stumbles upon Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson) deep in the woods her family owns. She is introduced to the Tuck family and their secret, along with an entirely new way of living. The Tucks take their time with life, appreciating everything around them. Since they themselves don't change physically they are focused on monitoring the world as it changes around them.Coming from a wealthy and very proper family, Winnie finds the Tuck lifestyle very refreshing and stays with the Tucks rather than returning home. This is symbolically represented by her switch from a wardrobe dominated by a tight corset to one of loose comfortable dresses.Suspense is introduced by a mysterious man in a yellow suit (Ben Kingsley) who is getting increasingly close to learning the Tuck's secret. Romance is introduced by the growing love between Winnie and Jesse. Although Jesse looks 17, he is actually 107. Apparently after 107 years of living, he still has a thing for teenage girls. You'd think that mentally he'd be trying to move up but this is just one of a host of problematic questions that arise if you try to take the story literally.The ""Tuck Everlasting"" novel is an expressionistic story and the Tuck family themselves a surreal device much like the repeating day in ""Groundhog Day"". Using this device the film is able to raise questions (many of which cannot be adequately answered but are fun to contemplate) about a number of issues. Should Winnie follow tradition and do what the world expects of her or should she seek adventure and set her own expectations of herself? What does it mean to get older? Are there times when secrets are necessary? At one point Mr. Tuck tells Winnie that she should not fear death but should fear the unlived life, she doesn't have to live forever-she just has to live.Another expressionistic theme of the book/film is the isolation of the Tucks from the rest of society because of their immortality. They do not share the one thing common to all living creatures, the limitations imposed by time.To best appreciate this story it is important to remember that it is about Winnie's life and not about the Tucks. They are just there to prompt her to consider the many issues that are facing her as she transitions from being a child to being an adult.The DVD is full of additional material. There are two commentary tracks, the more substantial one by director Jay Russell and screenwriter James Hart and a second one by Russell and cast members Jonathan Jackson, Alex Bledel and Scott Bairstow. Russell doesn't describe what's happening in the scenes so much as discuss the film-making process. It is here that he attempts to justify turning Babbit's 10 year-old heroine into a teenager. Although claiming that an older actress could better convey the thematic content, it seems more likely that it was done to expand the target audience demographic by inserting something of interest to teenage boys.There's also a ""Lessons of Tuck"" viewing mode, in which the film is interrupted a few times and discussion takes place about the various themes that have been introduced in the preceding segment.Finally, there's a featurette on the life and inspirations of author Natalie Babbitt.Then again, what do I know?

This movie is about a girl named Winnie who is fed up with life at home, and goes exploring in the woods. In the woods she meets a boy named Jesse Tuck, along with the rest of his family. Winnie learns that the Tuck family is imortal. They will live forever and can not die. They decide to keep her at their house, intill she understands why she can not tell about the little spring that makes them imortal. While she is staying with the Tucks Winnie and Jesse fall in love. There is an amazing scene that almost made me cry, when Winnie is being taken away from Jesse. Mae the mother hits the man who is trying to take away winnie on the head with a gun, and he dies. She and her husband are then put in jail, to be hung. The problom is, if she is hung she will not die, and every one will know the secret.

My children are 6, 9, and 10; they all wandered away and found something else to do. My ten-year-old daughter, who I thought would enjoy it with me, went off and found a book to read. I added a half star to the film for this.The movie is about a family that drinks from a fountain of youth spring while on their way west. More than that, they find they are impervious to harm; even bullets won't kill them. The film is set in 1920 or thereabouts and it has been eighty or eighty-five years since the Tuck family has stopped aging. Now our heroine discovers them. Sound good? Did to me, too.Did you ever go to one of those movies that never seem to get going? The characters are introduced but the story never starts and you find you are squiming in your seat waiting for something to happen? That is the problem with this film. The actors are all fine, the characters are interesting, the scenery is beautiful, the premise is fascinating, but the plot just kind of meanders and never finds its way. There are good bits and pieces here and there but not a whole. The love interest between the youngest Tuck son and our heroine doesn't ring true, I don't believe this was in the book. Somehow a one hundred and four- year-old man in a seventeen-year-old body interested in a sixteen-year-old girl does not feel right. The best part of the film is when Miles, the older Tuck brother, who is a perpetual twenty, tells our heroine the downside to immortality. Heartwrenching scene here, very good. Imagine you are over one hundred years old in a twenty-year-old body and your baby boy is now an eighty-five-year-old man. I wish they had kept going in this direction. Beside this scene and a bit more on getting into the dark side of living forever I liked the ending. It was a bit uplifting as you might expect from a Disney film.Looking at some of these other reviews I see I am going against the grain so don't be put off entirely. As I said, it has its moments.

Despite having a who's-who-in-Hollywood cast, Lieber and Hart's braindead screenplay renders this, at best, an ineffective shadow of Natalie Babbitt's classic young adult novel. (Perhaps this isn't surprising; Lieber was responsible for the screenplays for Jay Lowi's execrable Tangled, while one of Hart's recent screen credits was for Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.)In case you somehow never got round to reading the book, a quick synopsis: the Tucks-- father Angus (William Hurt), mother Mae (Sissy Spacek), and sons Jesse and Miles (Jonathan Jackson and Scott Bairstow, respectively)-- live in a wood owned by the Foster clan, whose daughter Winnie (Alexis Bledel) is chafing under the ministrations of her oversheltering mother (Amy Irving). After Winnie sneaks off for some alone time, she stumbles upon Jesse at a spring, and, of course, romance must bloom. Complicating things in the Man in the Yellow Suit (Ben Kingsley), who has been searching for the Tucks for quite a while. Because, you see, the Tucks are immortal, thanks to that very spring. Winnie must choose between drinking from the spring, becoming immortal herself, and staying with Jesse, or separating from him and leading a normal life.Disney being Disney, the romance between Winnie and Jesse and the action scenes featuring the Man in the Yellow Suit (I wish he'd finally get a name somewhere, to make reviews easier to write) are brought to the forefront, and the more cerebral portions of the novel-- whose central thesis is, of course, whether someone would want to live forever-- is shoved into a dark corner and brought out only when the screenwriters wanted to give a nod to the original novel. The result is one of the more boring action movies, or one of the least romantic romances, depending on how you want to look at it, I've run across this year.

602897,A3R2M6DGECQOO,B00005JLOS,Terrie,"[3, 5]","This film would have made a great ""made for TV"" film similar to the Hallmark Hall of Fame movies we are treated to once in a while. It's only about 90 minutes long, so with a few commercials to round it out to 2 hours, it would be just about right for TV. It's lightweight, romantic, involves a family, a bit of fantasy, and a bad guy who is not overly evil. The small amount of violence is not gory or frightening. It has a typical romantic plot, ""we're in love but we must sacrifice for a greater good.""  I loved the book and I really enjoyed the movie, but it was very predictable and rather too fluffy in spots. My only real complaint with it is that I left the theatre thinking about whether or not to do my grocery shopping rather than being swept up in the film's ambiance and drama. I didn't feel like I should tell all my friends to get out there and see it immediately. A five star movie really moves me and this one didn't do the job. Having said that, I must hastily add that all of the actors were superb. This story is about the Tuck family who accidentally drank from an enchanted spring and are gifted and cursed with everlasting life without aging.  A girl, Winnie, who is growing up as the only daughter of a well-to-do, proper and very repressive family and who yearns for more out of life, crosses paths with the Tuck family's youngest son. Bittersweet romance ensues. In the movies, magic almost never fits seamlessly into ordinary life, so of course there are major complications such as a greedy bad guy and a crises when the modern world interfaces with the ageless one of the Tuck family. William Hurt and Sissy Spacek were wonderfully understated and seemed just like the simple parents they were supposed to be, just really nice folks caught up in a tragic circumstance where all they can do is to keep on keeping on and try to live decently and with love. Any time Sissy was on the screen my attention was riveted though she remained soft and emotional and kindly. Ben Kingsley was a wonderful villain. He created his characterization with brilliant use of voice and facial expression and was never overtly evil, yet dripped with greed and self-centeredness. The young actors were all very, very good but the director had them cavorting too much with skipping and running, young wild manes flying and the mandatory romantic device, stripping down for a swim in a secluded pool beneath a waterfall.  It seemed like we were being sold the romance rather than like it was unfolding naturally. That sounds nit-picky but when you see it I think you'll see what I mean. It's just so cliche that even though it looks pretty on the screen, it is uninvolving.I liked this film, all in all, but it doesn't require the big screen treatment to be enjoyed to its fullest. It is short and would be a great home DVD rental for family TV night. Nice story, good actors, cinematography, set decoration, music...all tied up like a pretty package with a Hallmark card on top.",4,Made for TV,1035072000,"10 20, 2002",2002,2984,"['film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'similar', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'movies', 'are', 'treated', 'once', 'while', 'only', 'about', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'so', 'few', 'commercials', 'round', '2', 'hours', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'TV', 'lightweight', 'romantic', 'family', 'bit', 'fantasy', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'not', 'overly', 'evil', 'small', 'amount', 'violence', 'not', 'gory', 'frightening', 'typical', 'romantic', 'plot', ""'re"", 'love', 'must', 'sacrifice', 'greater', 'good', 'loved', 'book', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'predictable', 'rather', 'too', 'fluffy', 'spots', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'left', 'theatre', 'thinking', 'not', 'do', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'rather', 'being', 'swept', 'up', 'film', 'ambiance', 'drama', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'should', 'tell', 'friends', 'get', 'there', 'see', 'immediately', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'really', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'Having', 'said', 'must', 'hastily', 'add', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'story', 'Tuck', 'family', 'who', 'accidentally', 'drank', 'enchanted', 'spring', 'are', 'gifted', 'cursed', 'everlasting', 'life', 'aging', 'girl', 'Winnie', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'only', 'daughter', 'well-to-do', 'proper', 'very', 'repressive', 'family', 'who', 'yearns', 'more', 'out', 'life', 'paths', 'Tuck', 'family', 'youngest', 'son', 'Bittersweet', 'romance', 'ensues', 'movies', 'almost', 'never', 'seamlessly', 'ordinary', 'life', 'course', 'are', 'major', 'complications', 'such', 'greedy', 'bad', 'guy', 'crises', 'when', 'modern', 'world', 'interfaces', 'ageless', 'one', 'Tuck', 'family', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'seemed', 'just', 'simple', 'parents', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'just', 'really', 'nice', 'folks', 'caught', 'up', 'tragic', 'circumstance', 'where', 'can', 'do', 'keep', 'keeping', 'try', 'live', 'decently', 'love', 'time', 'Sissy', 'was', 'screen', 'attention', 'was', 'riveted', 'remained', 'soft', 'emotional', 'kindly', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'was', 'wonderful', 'villain', 'created', 'characterization', 'brilliant', 'use', 'voice', 'facial', 'expression', 'was', 'never', 'overtly', 'evil', 'yet', 'dripped', 'greed', 'self-centeredness', 'young', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'director', 'had', 'cavorting', 'too', 'much', 'skipping', 'running', 'young', 'wild', 'manes', 'flying', 'mandatory', 'romantic', 'device', 'stripping', 'down', 'swim', 'secluded', 'pool', 'waterfall', 'seemed', 'were', 'being', 'sold', 'romance', 'rather', 'was', 'unfolding', 'naturally', 'nit-picky', 'when', 'see', 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'just', 'so', 'cliche', 'even', 'pretty', 'screen', 'uninvolving.I', 'liked', 'film', ""n't"", 'require', 'big', 'screen', 'treatment', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'fullest', 'short', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'home', 'DVD', 'rental', 'family', 'TV', 'night', 'Nice', 'story', 'good', 'actors', 'cinematography', 'set', 'decoration', 'music', 'tied', 'up', 'pretty', 'package', 'Hallmark', 'card', 'top']",N/A

It is just so good!",5,"GREAT, WHOLESOME, REFRESHING MOVIE!",1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,831,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'worrying', 'what', '9-year-old', 'daughter', 'might', 'hear', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'would', 'give', '10', 'stars', 'was', 'possible', 'used', 'be', 'General', 'Hospital', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'very', 'fine', 'respectable', 'actor', 'bought', 'video', 'best', 'friend', '12-year-old', 'daughter', 'been', 'watching', '3', 'times', 'day', 'day', 'daughter', 'said', 'earlier', 'only', '9', 'did', 'absolutely', 'love', 'part', 'when', 'Jesse', 'brother', 'pretended', 'be', 'grim', 'reaper', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'figure', 'couple', 'years', 'daughter', 'too', 'will', 'love', 'appreciate', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', '12', '112', 'just', 'so', 'good']",N/A

Following the link to see the rest of his reviews, he has given ""Jackass"" a four-star rating and ""The Hot Chick"" five stars. Guess some people find any movie that takes some gray-matter to be a little to slow for their taste!This is a wonderful movie. It is actually too bad that it is being marketed incorrectly. This is not just a children's movie, but a first class film through and through. Ben Kingsley, Alexis Bledel, William Hurt and Sissy Spacek shine. Ms. Bledel may prove to be one of the finest actresses of our current time if she keeps it up.One of the first things that struck me about this movie was that it didn't appear to be a product of its time. There is no vile language, no potty humor, and the story actually makes the viewer contemplate whether they, themselves, would want to be immortal.The DVD transfer is beautiful, quite a change from most Disney DVD's. The extras are rather limited, but who cares. This is a great movie, and can stand on its own.",5,My favorite movie from the latest century,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,1110,"['had', 'guy', 'who', 'placed', 'review', 'site', 'claiming', 'Tuck', 'Everlasting', 'boring', 'movie', 'put', 'sleep', 'Following', 'link', 'see', 'rest', 'reviews', 'given', 'Jackass', 'four-star', 'rating', 'Hot', 'Chick', 'five', 'stars', 'Guess', 'people', 'find', 'movie', 'gray-matter', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'taste', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'actually', 'too', 'bad', 'being', 'marketed', 'incorrectly', 'not', 'just', 'children', 'movie', 'first', 'class', 'film', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'shine', 'Ms.', 'Bledel', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'current', 'time', 'up.One', 'first', 'things', 'struck', 'movie', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'product', 'time', 'vile', 'language', 'potty', 'humor', 'story', 'actually', 'viewer', 'contemplate', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'immortal.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'beautiful', 'quite', 'change', 'most', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'rather', 'limited', 'who', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own']",N/A
