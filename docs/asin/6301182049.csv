246366,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6301182049,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[5, 10]","Shakespeare is a genius and Peter Brook is divine. He gives to King Lear an unexpected dimension in this black and white film. He more or less puts the problem of power in second position and centers the play on the process  of aging, showing all the shortcomings of age : capricious whims, anger and  temper, the demand to be taken care of as if you were some kind of baby,  the need to be surrounded by other people who make you think you are not  alone, old, decrepit. The total lack of humanity of the two favored  daughters is described with such density that they become more than cruel,  purely inhuman and barbaric. They hate old people as if their lives were at  stake, menaced by their only presence. They blind the old Gloucester and  they reject their old father, though both old men had deserved being  chastised because of their whimsical decisions and abuse of authority. But  even the third daughter of the King is not really saved by the film since  she was silly enough to refuse her share of the kingdom in order then to  capture the whole thing through war. None of those characters is in any way  redeemed. Of course we find the fundamental pattern Shakespeare uses in  many plays. The normal situation of the beginning is disturbed by an  unbalanced decision from King Lear : to step down from the throne and to  abandon his responsibility towards his kingdom. Thus he creates disorder  and a dynamic that will lead to total destruction : the ambition of the two  favored sisters, then their rivalry, then the ambition of the third sister.  The drama has to go through to the end, which is the death of all members  of this silly family. And, maybe, from the ashes of these fools, a just and  new power structure will emerge. But in this play this epiphany is hardly  suggested. We end in chaos, and that is original in Shakespeare's plays.  Peter Brook multiplies this chaos by his great directing and the beautiful  use of black and white, emphasized by the season, winter, with snow  everywhere, or by the white sand of the beach in the final scenes. His  rendering of the craziness of King Lear after the tempest is based on  black-outs alternating with distorted short visions of grimacing faces.  This adaptation of King Lear is one of the most powerful ones I have ever  seen, due to the lack of color, extreme music, and superfluous special  effects. It is a trip into the night of aging politicians creating chaos  out of selfishness.

246367,AREUUNVSKKODF,6301182049,"John T. Ehrhart ""JohnOfKaty""","[4, 5]","Well I have said this before, and I will say it again....why isn't this movie out on DVD as a RErelease?  It stars Bobcat Goldthwait (Police Academy's 2,3, and 4.), he plays Fred P. Chaney a nobody who's relative dies and leaves him an inheritance with a gifted horse......DON.  The word gifted is that he can talk.  When Fred finds out about this, not only is he amazed, he's amazed at how rich Don makes him when he finds out about what he knows about the stock market.  Fred also finds out that in the inheritance that he owns half of the stocks and bonds in a company that his dead relative's widower wants so much of because he doesn't like Fred and doesn't want him to own it. Played by actor Dabney Coleman (WarGames, Nine To Five), he does everything he can to blackball Fred in losing his share of the company, a girl that Fred meets (Virginia Madsen, Electric Dreams) overhears the scheme and decides to help Fred.  Meanwhile, Don decides to get involved to help Fred too, and by doing that he enters himself in a horse race which involves Fred's tricky enemy and his girlfriend which they have their horses as collateral to bet against Fred and his horse that if he wins the horse race, Fred gets everything back, but if he loses he is out.  Don wins the race by the tip of his incisor tooth and gets back everything he ever lost.  The voice of Don is played by the late actor John Candy and he does a fantastic performance in this.  I hope Warner Bros. will RErelease this on DVD cause it is an 80's classic if there ever was one.  You'll see some cameo appearances by Tim Katzurisky who played Suichuk in the Police Academy movies with Bobcat Goldthwait so you'll see them playing again together in this.  Also Mary Gross from the movie Feds who plays the realtor who shows Fred his new suite that he moves into, and Gilbert Godfried at the end who plays a vet dentist who caps Don's teeth.
