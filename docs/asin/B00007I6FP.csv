Steven Bochco & David Milch were the driving factors.  Understandably the NYPD Blue set was not the most pleasant of working enviornments, The Sipowitz character, Dennis Franz, had the strength of character personally to endure the difficulties on the set and the ability to create one of TV's strongest characters. ---  John Kelly's character was the high mark for any character acting in TV or movies during the first season of NYPD Blue.  David Caruso allowed the audience during 1993-1994 to experience the best police dramas here-to-date.  Unfortunatedly, Caruso couldn't suffer the NYPD Blue task to continue such steller 22-episodes each season.  Jimmy Smitts as Bobby Simone not only took over Caruso's character, he devoured it in Season 2, Eposide 5.  Simone was interesting in LA Law but his age, education and the writing and direction on NYPD Blue, gave Smitts his ultimate performances with the uniquely qualified Dennis Franz.  NYPD Blue continues to give fans constant fascination and awe with every episode.  The enjoyment of the 12 seasons of NYPD Blue are ones to re-watch periodically when the NYPD Blue desire hits.

729075,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00007I6FP,calvinnme,"[7, 7]","Although it seems tame compared to the show's currently on television (most notably ""The Shield""), ""NYPD Blue"" was groundbreaking back when it premiered in 1993. It was one of the first television shows to truly push the envelope, featuring nudity, violence, and language that you thought you'd never hear on network television at the time. So much so, that it wasn't even broadcast on the ABC affiliate in Dallas during that first season.The first season contains some quality television moments. I found the pilot disappointing - it's dull prime time fare meant primarily to shock the viewer. However, the second episode will draw you in. Sipowicz, after being shot by a mobster, lies in the hospital while his partner, Detective John Kelly (David Caruso) and other precinct characters, seek revenge. The internal affairs stuff becomes more relevant, as does Sipowicz's nasty drinking habit, his disastrous personal life and his racist tendencies. Kelly is more of a kinder cop, standing behind his partner even with his bad habits, and Caruso plays it with such debonair coolness in contrast to Franz's gruff Sipowicz that he attracted movie offers quickly and left after the first four episodes of the second season. Unfortunately, people remember more about how Caruso's career went downhill after he left the show than just how good he was at playing Kelly.Remember that besides the shock value, season one of NYPD Blue is depicting a pre-Giuliani New York City - one in which people carry spare watches and extra cash so that when they inevitably get mugged they have something to give the robber and don't get pistol whipped. This inevitable sense of victimhood is personified in ""4B"" (David Schwimmer), a guy who is mugged in the laundry room of his own apartment building, starts carrying a gun, and is eventually killed while trying to defend himself against a subsequent attack. There's also the budding ""Beauty and the Beast"" romance between Sipowicz and ADA Sylvia Costas which begins Sipowicz' transformation into a good and admirable person. Then there is the season-long epic of officer Janice Licalsi (Amy Brenneman) who kills a mobster who in turn wanted her to kill John Kelly and was threatening to reveal her late father's corrupt past as a police officer as leverage. Licalsi has apparently gotten away with a crime that seems somewhat justifiable, but her conscience just won't let the deed rest.Overall, I would say that this was one of the better seasons of NYPD Blue. The characters were much more interesting than they were in later seasons and the stories were pretty good, although I was somewhat bored by the internal affairs material. The season holds up over time, but the shock value really doesn't, and in some cases actually does damage to character development. For example, there is really no reason for that last scene of the last episode of the season between John Kelly and Robin, the widow of John's rich friend who has recently died of cancer. In fact, subtract the shock value, and it makes Kelly look like a real jerk - Licalsi is facing prison for saving John's life and his first act after her confession and arrest is to be with another woman? In spite of it all, I would still recommend the DVD set since this first season really is very unique among the twelve season run and is a must for any true fan of the show.",5,First season was the best and the most unique,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,3365,"['tame', 'compared', 'show', 'currently', 'television', 'most', 'notably', 'Shield', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'back', 'when', 'premiered', '1993', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'television', 'shows', 'truly', 'push', 'envelope', 'featuring', 'nudity', 'violence', 'language', 'thought', ""'d"", 'never', 'hear', 'network', 'television', 'time', 'So', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'broadcast', 'ABC', 'affiliate', 'Dallas', 'first', 'season.The', 'first', 'season', 'quality', 'television', 'moments', 'found', 'pilot', 'disappointing', 'dull', 'prime', 'time', 'fare', 'meant', 'primarily', 'shock', 'viewer', 'However', 'second', 'episode', 'will', 'draw', 'Sipowicz', 'being', 'shot', 'mobster', 'hospital', 'partner', 'Detective', 'John', 'Kelly', 'David', 'Caruso', 'other', 'precinct', 'characters', 'seek', 'revenge', 'internal', 'affairs', 'stuff', 'becomes', 'more', 'relevant', 'Sipowicz', 'nasty', 'drinking', 'habit', 'disastrous', 'personal', 'life', 'racist', 'tendencies', 'Kelly', 'more', 'kinder', 'cop', 'standing', 'partner', 'even', 'bad', 'habits', 'Caruso', 'such', 'debonair', 'coolness', 'contrast', 'Franz', 'gruff', 'Sipowicz', 'attracted', 'movie', 'offers', 'quickly', 'left', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'remember', 'more', 'how', 'Caruso', 'career', 'went', 'downhill', 'left', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'playing', 'Kelly.Remember', 'shock', 'value', 'season', 'one', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'depicting', 'pre-Giuliani', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'one', 'people', 'carry', 'spare', 'watches', 'extra', 'cash', 'so', 'when', 'inevitably', 'get', 'mugged', 'have', 'something', 'give', 'robber', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'pistol', 'whipped', 'inevitable', 'sense', 'victimhood', 'personified', '4B', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'guy', 'who', 'mugged', 'laundry', 'room', 'own', 'apartment', 'building', 'carrying', 'gun', 'eventually', 'killed', 'trying', 'defend', 'subsequent', 'attack', 'also', 'budding', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'romance', 'Sipowicz', 'ADA', 'Sylvia', 'Costas', 'Sipowicz', 'transformation', 'good', 'admirable', 'person', 'Then', 'season-long', 'epic', 'officer', 'Janice', 'Licalsi', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'who', 'mobster', 'who', 'turn', 'wanted', 'kill', 'John', 'Kelly', 'was', 'threatening', 'reveal', 'late', 'father', 'corrupt', 'past', 'police', 'officer', 'leverage', 'Licalsi', 'apparently', 'gotten', 'away', 'crime', 'somewhat', 'justifiable', 'conscience', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'deed', 'rest.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'seasons', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'characters', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'were', 'later', 'seasons', 'stories', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'somewhat', 'bored', 'internal', 'affairs', 'material', 'season', 'up', 'time', 'shock', 'value', 'really', ""n't"", 'cases', 'actually', 'damage', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'really', 'reason', 'last', 'scene', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'John', 'Kelly', 'Robin', 'widow', 'John', 'rich', 'friend', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'cancer', 'fact', 'subtract', 'shock', 'value', 'Kelly', 'look', 'real', 'jerk', 'Licalsi', 'facing', 'prison', 'saving', 'John', 'life', 'first', 'act', 'confession', 'arrest', 'be', 'woman', 'spite', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'very', 'unique', 'twelve', 'season', 'run', 'must', 'true', 'fan', 'show']",NYPD Blue - Season 1

It broke television boundaries and became one of the best police drama shows of all time. While it definitely went on longer than it should have, the first few seasons (especially the first) made up some of the best television shows of all-time.Season one was the only full season that Detective John Kelly (David Caruso) was in, and the show was never quite the same to me after that. Detective Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) was probably the best possible replacement for Andy's partner, but no one could ever quite replace John Kelly. Thanks to the terrific job David Caruso did as playing the intriguing and complex John Kelly, season one is definitely the best out of the series.What also makes season one (along with the first three seasons to a degree) stand out is the grittiness and how real the characters are. Starting around the fourth season we start to get more cliche, boring characters who you'd never really see in the NYPD. Lots of supermodely type girls (come on, are we supposed to believe EVERY girl cop in the NYPD is drop dead gorgeous?) and unnecessary love drama. Andy starts messing with and marrying every girl in sight, and everyone in the office is hooking up. In the first couple seasons I feel like I'm seeing real relationships at work. Tragic love and true passion, it's corny at times, but at least it feels right.If you're a NYPD Blue fan or have an interest in cop shows, you must get this.

Phenomal writing, poignant on screen acting, personal story lines that made you care about the characters, and salty language and sexual situations all made for excellent, sometimes shocking, normally Networked Cesored scenes.  And that's magic in my book!Before ""The Wire,"" before ""The Shield,""  even before Hill Street Blues (okay, scratch that last one, sorry...), there was NYPD Blue, and this was the show that started it all!  Dennis Franz has ALWAYS been one of my favorite characters and has been featured in several Brian De Palma flicks, starring in smaller minor roles.  A saint of an actor, and one of the nicest men you'll ever meet, but a hell of an actor.  He makes you believe he is the worst cop on planet earth, (well next to the Chiklis character in The Shield.)David Caruso, also a fine actor, but a bit overrated in my opionion rounded out the cast.

The situations, dialogue, and personality quirks or the characters are something that I think could only be comprehended fully by an extremely smart 12th grader or a person who has either gone to college, or read a ton of books, or lived on the streets of NY. You have to know what ""He got shanked in Riker's"" means. If you think a shank is something you put in your soup, and you don't know what/where Rikers is, the show can be frustrating. The characters often speak in riddles and use sarcasm not easily understood by the perps even! You have to have a basic understanding of police and criminal procedure, investigations, etc. and symbolism. In any given episode there are usually two new cases and a continuation of one or two storylines that have been ongoing, so, unlike Law & Order, if you just sit down and turn it on, you can get lost right off the bat. Checking the episode guides online will help, but you need to know the characters personalities as well! Sipowicz is old-school. Medavoy is melodramatic. Diane is kind of hesitant, Jill is much less tense. My personal favorite, James Martinez (played by the versatile Nicholas Turturro), unfortunately did not stay with the show through the run.

I'd already seen the whole series twice when it was originally run, and thought it so good that I sat down to write the makers a congratulatory letter but I didn't know who to send it to. The problem for the producers was that they told the story of the precinct house so well, and ended it on such a perfect note, that there wasn't really any point in continuing with it. They'd done it, and should have left it as a one off masterpiece. The next series lacked Caruso, the long running corruption saga and the strong writing. I don't know if some writers moved on, but the humour of the show, similar to 'Hill Street Blues', seemed to lessen dramatically. Formula set in, the usual interrogation scenes, and also a peculiar political correctness. I don't know whether that's because of all the rules in America to do with office politics, no racism, sexism etc, but everyone in the squad room seemed to talk in this odd ""I-must-check-every-word-for-respect"" stilted speak. Very odd and uncomfortable. I stopped watching and the series eventually vanished for two years before returning at an after midnight slot. Caruso went on to star in 'Micheal Hayes' which was an interesting attempt to tackle politics with intelligence, but was slow starting and often incomprehensible to the layman. Sadly, he now stars in 'CSI: Miami', a truly dreadful, meretricious waste of time in which he appears to be in a straightjacket with nothing much to do. Franz appears to have stayed with the show, but the tragedies in his life seem to have gotten into the realms of the ridiculous. If they haven't already, they should cut his character a break. Nearly everytime an actor wants out, the producers kill their character. Is this realistic?Before all that, though, was this classic first series which is well worth investing in. I have problems with some of it. Halfway through, police brutality was introduced, and the constant beating up of suspects, which the series appeared to condone, quickly became repellent. I note that real NY cops didn't get away with this conduct in one particularly notorious case. Also, the lead characters were never on the take or anything. Real good guys, up to a point.

If you like gritty character driven drama this is an excellent series.  The first season sets the tone and pace for this series where each show has enough connection to develop bigger stories, but interlaced within each episode are individual story lines that add soo much to the series.What makes this series(and season) so good is that it excels in what matters most in a tv drama:  plot and characters1.  The Plot:  Very creative and interesting.  They do have a plot line involving the mob that is pretty important in the season, which is done well, but the mob has been done so many different ways I felt that this was a little old hat.  Don't get me wrong it's very well done and doesn't detract from the series, it's just not very innovative.The stories of the cops private lives is also very well done and interesting.2.  The Characters.  For me the actors and characters of the show pushed this NYPD Blue over the edge from just being a good show to being a GREAT show.  They are ALL excellent!  Some of the lesser roles that were in this season were filled by actors who would go on to play leads in some outstanding TV Shows in the future like:  Friends, The WestWing, Judging Amy, just to name a few.The two actors that shine brighter than the others though are:  Dennis Franz as Andy Sipowicz and David Caruso as John Kelly.This was the only full season that John Kelly is a character, and he is great.  He is that calm and collected officer that everyone wants to be around that can take care of any situation both personal or public.  He's the guy that men watching the show usually would see themselves as, or at least wish they were.Andy Sipowicz on the other hand is the main lead through the whole series, and is one of my favorite characters of all time.  He's that flawed hero that you root for.  Defintely not your typical handsome lead, but follows the line of other great characters in TV history like Hawkeye Pierce, that you love to watch.This season was outstanding, especially the story line of the lost girl that found it's climax in the last episode of the season.**I should mention that this show was very controversial at the time of it's release because of the adult language and skin bearing scenes.

David Caruso might have seen himself as the lead, and he was good, but Dennis Franz stole the show right from the start.  His performances in the first few episodes are nothing short of top-notch, world-class displays of acting talent.  He exhibits every emotion known to man as he struggles with his vices, loses his job, gets shot several times, and attempts to recover both personally and professionally.  Franz lets the audience know from Episode 1 that he's out to create a truly memorable character, and he succeeded fantastically.Caruso is certainly a highlight, playing the dark, quiet, tough cop, a foil to Franz's loudmouth Andy Sipowicz.  The two had great chemistry, and it's a shame they didn't get a chance to do more seasons together.  Other important characters introduced in Season 1 are Greg Medavoy, James Martinez, Donna Abondando, and Arthur Fancy, all of whom remained for multiple seasons.  Fringe characters include Mike Roberts, who returned from time to time in subsequent seasons; John Kelly's wife Laura, who left before the end of the season, and his obsession, Janice Lecalsi, who appeared in a few episodes with him at the beginning of Season 2; Adrian Lesniak, who eventually developed a short-lived romance with Martinez; and Vince Gotelli, a gruff, older night duty detective who's good for some comic relief.To say that this first season was action-packed would be an understatement.  The show's intense violence, language, and sexuality pushed the boundaries of network TV, delivering graphic content nearly comparable to that of HBO.  But it wasn't just because sex and violence sell; the show portrayed a gritty realism that would've been compromised and watered down by a more conservative approach.  It's a travesty that only the first four seasons have been released on DVD, as the series ran for twelve.  Hopefully, fans of NYPD Blue will someday get their wish and see the show's remaining eight years made available.  In the meantime, Season 1 is a wonderful set to own.",5,One of TV's Best Shows Starts Out Big,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,2148,"['thought', 'show', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'last', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ever', 'got', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'beginning', 'David', 'Caruso', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'lead', 'was', 'good', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'stole', 'show', 'right', 'start', 'performances', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'top-notch', 'world-class', 'displays', 'acting', 'talent', 'emotion', 'known', 'man', 'vices', 'job', 'shot', 'several', 'times', 'attempts', 'recover', 'personally', 'professionally', 'Franz', 'audience', 'know', 'Episode', '1', 'out', 'create', 'truly', 'memorable', 'character', 'succeeded', 'fantastically.Caruso', 'certainly', 'highlight', 'playing', 'dark', 'quiet', 'tough', 'cop', 'foil', 'Franz', 'loudmouth', 'Andy', 'Sipowicz', 'two', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'do', 'more', 'seasons', 'together', 'Other', 'important', 'characters', 'introduced', 'Season', '1', 'are', 'Greg', 'Medavoy', 'James', 'Martinez', 'Donna', 'Abondando', 'Arthur', 'Fancy', 'whom', 'remained', 'multiple', 'seasons', 'Fringe', 'characters', 'include', 'Mike', 'Roberts', 'who', 'returned', 'time', 'time', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'John', 'Kelly', 'wife', 'Laura', 'who', 'left', 'end', 'season', 'obsession', 'Janice', 'Lecalsi', 'who', 'appeared', 'few', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'Season', '2', 'Adrian', 'Lesniak', 'who', 'eventually', 'developed', 'short-lived', 'romance', 'Martinez', 'Vince', 'Gotelli', 'gruff', 'older', 'night', 'duty', 'detective', 'who', 'good', 'comic', 'relief.To', 'say', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'action-packed', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'show', 'intense', 'violence', 'language', 'sexuality', 'pushed', 'boundaries', 'network', 'TV', 'delivering', 'graphic', 'content', 'nearly', 'comparable', 'HBO', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'sex', 'violence', 'sell', 'show', 'portrayed', 'gritty', 'realism', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'compromised', 'watered', 'down', 'more', 'conservative', 'approach', 'travesty', 'only', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'series', 'ran', 'twelve', 'Hopefully', 'fans', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'will', 'someday', 'get', 'wish', 'see', 'show', 'remaining', 'eight', 'years', 'made', 'available', 'meantime', 'Season', '1', 'wonderful', 'set', 'own']",NYPD Blue - Season 1

The one thing that we dislike about the episodes is the of sexual encounters where too much skin is shown.  Fortunately there is not a lot of this type of exposure and so we are able to continue to watch this series.I cannot give this series a 5 star as there are negative points. The show is entertaining and builds the characters to where you can see the chemistry between people and relationships. The main character is not perfect, he has his own human charismatic weakness however he is a good cop with good intentions and looks out for his associated friendly relationships, sticking up for other policemen or policewoman, encouraging proper ways of life, though he has some of his own short comings which he is working out as well.Overall this is a good show to watch.  Though it may be something for a more mature audience.  Not necessarily something I would recommend for family with young kids. The violence seems to be real life type events and is not too excessive however, it is still present. There are a lot of worldly exposures presented as only can be expected as this is a cop show.

729148,A3BDUENAVB467I,B00007I6FP,"John Capute ""JCap""","[10, 10]","For years my Tuesday nights revolved around this show.  Then, sometime around the time they got yet another pair of gorgeous, yet totally colorless, female detectives, and yet another ""Loo"" and the show became totally a police procedual (I have to think budgetary cuts had to make dispensible anything outside the station house and  exteriors filmed on an already established studio backlot), I gave up on it, and switched to the now supremely edgier and better written (and acted and directed) The Shield.  That said, there were those years were the cooler talk at my place of work revolved around NYPD Blue, and it was never better than in its first, groundbreaking season.  Forget the hype about the nudity and language: what made this show so great was its portrayal of complicated, fallible people--truth be told, men--doing a immensely difficult job.  Kelly and Sipowicz were such compelling figures because they were basically decent men in a world where decency didn't necessarily solve the cases they had to deal with.  Who could forget Kelly telling then young detective Martinez how far he would violate a suspect's rights to get a confession.  It was brilliant drama, as we find ourselves confronting our own ambivilence about civil rights when they come to criminals.  And who could forget that moment when a grieving couple whose son has been murdered look at a pigeon on a rooftop and speak of how that's the little boy's spirit come back to them. And Andy Sipowicz--angry, drunken, violent, racist Andy--saying that he could see the light around the pigeon and yes, it had to be the boy come back.  Television didn't, and doesn't, get better than this.  We all know that NYPD Blue should have ended years before it did (although that would have denied us the opportunity to see a great actor like Dennis Franz at work), but for this first season, and at least two more seasons, there was no better acted, written, directed drama on television.

Once the initial ire died down, viewers and even the show's detractors saw that the show was masterfully written, brilliantly acted, and totally engrossing.This 6 disc set offers running commentary on selected episodes, plus a small handful of other features.

But when he was on the show, it was complex, bittersweet, tough, and heartbreaking.  He brought a sensibility and a soul to the show that it lacked when the more conventional Jimmy Smits came on board and the show became more conventional too. Caruso's unsentimental relations with the other characters made the show seem real. His cooler, more low key style brought out more humanity in every episode.  To me, there was no other actor on any TV drama who brought this much to the table. The extra documentaries on the First Season Disc (and the Second Season too) relate the difficulties he had - but it doesn't take away from his work.  This was the finest season of TV cop drama - it was the peak.  And it hasn't yet been equalled. Seeing Caruso on the more conventional and flimsy ""CSI:Miami"" and seeing Dennis Franz finish out the string on the final, awful, sentimental ""Blue"" episodes only makes the First Season stand out stronger: all 22 episodes are great, including the 4 of the Second Season - and then you see Smits and a more predictable style take over.

729178,A3FOCW2R5LP3X4,B00007I6FP,Michael Kent,"[13, 13]","Now that this series has run to its conclusion, one can look back on it and analyze what we have seen with much more clarity. Does it rank up there with the best police television series of all time? Did it change considerably during the course of its run? Can we honestly say that it will stand the test of time?There were other police series before and there will be others after...one of the best examples of this would be Hill Street Blues, in which Dennis Franz also had a role, which was ground breaking in its day but doesn't really stand the test of time now.One could argue with Blue that it stands up more because it was still running original episodes until 2005. That, however, doesn't explain the first season of the series, filmed in 1993-94 and how, even today, it comes across as fresh as it did then.Funny thing, though, it is the latter episodes that probably won't stand up...when the show became less about grit and the characters and more about the catch em and intimidate them in the interview room...in other words, it became more predictable.Not bad...just predictable.In season one we're treated to the dark, below the surface leadership of Detective John Kelly, as portrayed by David Caruso. To imagine and think of what direction the show would have taken had Caruso stayed past episode four of season two would be pure conjecture. Here, though, it is apparent that this is his show. Dennis Franz makes a capable second lead, showing us much of what was to come, but it's Caruso's below the surface darkness that resonates in these shows.The cast would change considerably in season two, but they were letter perfect in season one. I thought Amy Brennerman as Officer Janice Licalsi stood out more than some people gave her credit for. In the first three episodes alone, she goes to bed with Kelly, is told to kill him, kills the people who ordered her to kill Kelly and loses her father, who commits suicide. She would eventually be blackmailed by the mob and arrested for murder.Franz as Sipowicz shows many of the traits we will become familiar with during the seasons to come, stubborn, racist, angry and sometimes out of control, it's fascinating to observe this character as played by one of the true nice guys on television.Franz, of course, is the only original cast member to remain for the entire series run, though Gordon Clapp as Detective Medavoy shows up in episode three and throughout the first season...but not as a series regular.I always found Nicholas Turturro's James Martinez a bit much but he also brought a wide-eyed energy to the show. Martinez is eager to learn from the best which, despite their differences, Kelly and Sipowicz are.James McDaniel's Lt. Arthur Fancy is the show's other enduring character and it is clear that he and Sipowicz don't care very much for each other (that crack about going out for ribs was typical of their relationship)but recognize that, on some level, they need to work together.Sherry Stringfield's Laura Hughes Kelly is good as the reason for a lot of John Kelly's problems...it was the job that tore their marriage apart.We also see the Medavoy-Donna Abandando dance, the downfall of Andy Sipowicz Jr. and the beginnings of Sipowicz's relationship with Sylvia. We also see his ongoing battle with alcoholism and the other demons that possess him.It's unfortunate that Caruso left after a mere 26 episodes, but he made his mark and later admitted he made a big mistake. He thought he could sign his own ticket for a big screen career after that, but it never materialized. Only when CSI:Miami came along was he able to resurrect his career.It's disappointing that only this and season two have been released...and there seems to be nothing on the horizon for seasons three onward. But, if this is all to be released on DVD, they have released Blue at it's best, a collection no fan should be without.",5,The First And the Finest Blue,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,3888,"['Now', 'series', 'run', 'conclusion', 'one', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'analyze', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'more', 'clarity', 'rank', 'there', 'best', 'police', 'television', 'series', 'time', 'Did', 'change', 'considerably', 'course', 'run', 'Can', 'honestly', 'say', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'were', 'other', 'police', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'others', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'also', 'had', 'role', 'was', 'ground', 'breaking', 'day', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'now.One', 'could', 'argue', 'Blue', 'up', 'more', 'was', 'still', 'running', 'original', 'episodes', '2005', 'however', ""n't"", 'explain', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'filmed', '1993-94', 'how', 'even', 'today', 'as', 'fresh', 'did', 'then.Funny', 'thing', 'though', 'latter', 'episodes', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'when', 'show', 'became', 'less', 'grit', 'characters', 'more', 'catch', 'em', 'intimidate', 'interview', 'room', 'other', 'words', 'became', 'more', 'predictable.Not', 'bad', 'just', 'predictable.In', 'season', 'one', ""'re"", 'treated', 'dark', 'surface', 'leadership', 'Detective', 'John', 'Kelly', 'portrayed', 'David', 'Caruso', 'imagine', 'think', 'what', 'direction', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'had', 'Caruso', 'stayed', 'past', 'episode', 'four', 'season', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'pure', 'conjecture', 'Here', 'though', 'apparent', 'show', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'capable', 'second', 'lead', 'showing', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'Caruso', 'surface', 'darkness', 'shows.The', 'cast', 'would', 'change', 'considerably', 'season', 'two', 'were', 'letter', 'perfect', 'season', 'one', 'thought', 'Amy', 'Brennerman', 'Officer', 'Janice', 'Licalsi', 'stood', 'out', 'more', 'people', 'gave', 'credit', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'alone', 'bed', 'Kelly', 'told', 'kill', 'people', 'who', 'ordered', 'kill', 'Kelly', 'father', 'who', 'suicide', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'blackmailed', 'mob', 'arrested', 'murder.Franz', 'Sipowicz', 'many', 'traits', 'will', 'become', 'familiar', 'seasons', 'come', 'stubborn', 'racist', 'angry', 'control', 'fascinating', 'observe', 'character', 'played', 'one', 'true', 'nice', 'guys', 'television.Franz', 'course', 'only', 'original', 'cast', 'member', 'remain', 'entire', 'series', 'run', 'Gordon', 'Clapp', 'Detective', 'Medavoy', 'up', 'episode', 'three', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'series', 'regular.I', 'always', 'found', 'Nicholas', 'Turturro', 'James', 'Martinez', 'bit', 'much', 'also', 'brought', 'wide-eyed', 'energy', 'show', 'Martinez', 'eager', 'learn', 'best', 'differences', 'Kelly', 'Sipowicz', 'McDaniel', 'Lt.', 'Arthur', 'Fancy', 'show', 'other', 'enduring', 'character', 'clear', 'Sipowicz', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'crack', 'going', 'out', 'ribs', 'was', 'typical', 'relationship', 'recognize', 'level', 'need', 'work', 'together.Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'Laura', 'Hughes', 'Kelly', 'good', 'reason', 'lot', 'John', 'Kelly', 'problems', 'was', 'job', 'tore', 'marriage', 'apart.We', 'also', 'see', 'Medavoy-Donna', 'Abandando', 'dance', 'downfall', 'Andy', 'Sipowicz', 'Jr.', 'beginnings', 'Sipowicz', 'relationship', 'Sylvia', 'also', 'see', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'alcoholism', 'other', 'demons', 'possess', 'him.It', 'unfortunate', 'Caruso', 'left', 'mere', '26', 'episodes', 'made', 'mark', 'later', 'admitted', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'thought', 'could', 'sign', 'own', 'ticket', 'big', 'screen', 'career', 'never', 'materialized', 'Only', 'when', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'came', 'along', 'was', 'able', 'resurrect', 'career.It', 'disappointing', 'only', 'season', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'there', 'be', 'nothing', 'horizon', 'seasons', 'three', 'onward', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'have', 'released', 'Blue', 'best', 'collection', 'fan', 'should', 'be']",NYPD Blue - Season 1

David Bochco insisted that ABC allow him to use minor profanities and brief nudity to create a more realistic portrayal of the lives of New York City cops.  While several stations balked at the show and refused to carry it, the show was an instant success.  What really made the show so interesting was not the language or nudity, but the well written shows and first rate acting.  Bochco veteran Dennis Franz plays alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, who was only supposed to be in the first episode, whose character is gunned down and nearly dies.  Mr. Franz is superb as the volcanic Sipowicz and was rewarded with the first of his four Best Actor Emmys for the season, but the real star of the season is David Caruso.  Mr. Caruso is simply magnetic as Sipowicz's partner John Kelly.  Whereas Sipowicz is a hot head, Kelly exudes cool and calm.  He is passionate about what he does, but his anger boils beneath the surface where Sipowicz's explodes.  It is this dynamic between the two that makes the pairing work as one of the best in TV cop show history.  Other cast members include Sherry Stringfield as Assistant D.A. Laura Michaels who is also Kelly's ex-wife, Amy Brenneman as Janice Licalsi who is a police desk officer that is tangled up with the mob and carrying on an affair with Kelly, James McDaniel as Lt. Arthur Fancy who heads the department and is black.  Sipowicz is also a racist which causes much tension between him and Fancy.  Nicholas Turturro is Dt. James Martinez who is a new detective who struggles for acceptance on the job.  Future series regulars, Gordon Clapp as Greg Medavoy, Sharon Lawrence as Assistant D.A. Sylvia Costas and Gail O'Grady as receptionist Donna Abandando all appear as recurring characters before all were made full time cast members in the season two.  Actors like David Schwimmer, Michael Rappaport, Wendie Malik, Daniel Benzali, John Wesley Shipp and Bradley Whitford have guest roles.  Season one of the show almost seems like a separate show all together due to the massive cast changes that occurred after the season.  Mr. Caruso believed all the hype about him and made the mistake many actors who achieve success on a TV show, that they can become movie stars.  Mr. Caruso left the show after four brief appearances in season two and never achieved the stardom that he seemed slated for.  Sherry Stringfield left the show after the season to go to another show that would be even more popular, ER and Amy Brenneman also left the cast.  For the one season that he was on the show though, Mr. Caruso created an indelible image and the show would continue on through the rest of the decade as one the most popular and well made shows on television.",5,Behind The Blue Wall,1049673600,"04 7, 2003",2003,2951,"['fact', 'show', 'been', 'ten', 'seasons', 'proliferation', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'programming', 'now', 'TV', 'especially', 'HBO', 'restrictions', 'one', 'can', 'forget', 'power', 'shock', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'when', 'premiered', '1993', 'David', 'Bochco', 'insisted', 'ABC', 'allow', 'use', 'minor', 'profanities', 'brief', 'nudity', 'create', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'lives', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cops', 'several', 'stations', 'balked', 'show', 'refused', 'carry', 'show', 'was', 'instant', 'success', 'What', 'really', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'interesting', 'was', 'not', 'language', 'nudity', 'well', 'written', 'shows', 'first', 'rate', 'acting', 'Bochco', 'veteran', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'alcoholic', 'detective', 'Andy', 'Sipowicz', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'episode', 'character', 'gunned', 'down', 'nearly', 'dies', 'Mr.', 'Franz', 'superb', 'volcanic', 'Sipowicz', 'was', 'rewarded', 'first', 'four', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Emmys', 'season', 'real', 'star', 'season', 'David', 'Caruso', 'Mr.', 'Caruso', 'simply', 'magnetic', 'Sipowicz', 'partner', 'John', 'Kelly', 'Whereas', 'Sipowicz', 'hot', 'head', 'Kelly', 'cool', 'calm', 'passionate', 'what', 'anger', 'surface', 'where', 'Sipowicz', 'explodes', 'dynamic', 'two', 'pairing', 'work', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'cop', 'show', 'history', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'Assistant', 'D.A', 'Laura', 'Michaels', 'who', 'also', 'Kelly', 'ex-wife', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'Janice', 'Licalsi', 'who', 'police', 'desk', 'officer', 'tangled', 'up', 'mob', 'carrying', 'affair', 'Kelly', 'James', 'McDaniel', 'Lt.', 'Arthur', 'Fancy', 'who', 'department', 'black', 'Sipowicz', 'also', 'racist', 'much', 'tension', 'Fancy', 'Nicholas', 'Turturro', 'Dt', 'James', 'Martinez', 'who', 'new', 'detective', 'who', 'acceptance', 'job', 'Future', 'series', 'regulars', 'Gordon', 'Clapp', 'Greg', 'Medavoy', 'Sharon', 'Lawrence', 'Assistant', 'D.A', 'Sylvia', 'Costas', 'Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'receptionist', 'Donna', 'Abandando', 'all', 'appear', 'recurring', 'characters', 'were', 'made', 'full', 'time', 'cast', 'members', 'season', 'two', 'Actors', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Michael', 'Rappaport', 'Wendie', 'Malik', 'Daniel', 'Benzali', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Shipp', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'have', 'guest', 'roles', 'Season', 'one', 'show', 'almost', 'separate', 'show', 'together', 'due', 'massive', 'cast', 'changes', 'occurred', 'season', 'Mr.', 'Caruso', 'believed', 'hype', 'made', 'mistake', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'achieve', 'success', 'TV', 'show', 'can', 'become', 'movie', 'stars', 'Mr.', 'Caruso', 'left', 'show', 'four', 'brief', 'appearances', 'season', 'two', 'never', 'achieved', 'stardom', 'seemed', 'slated', 'Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'left', 'show', 'season', 'go', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'popular', 'ER', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'also', 'left', 'cast', 'one', 'season', 'was', 'show', 'Mr.', 'Caruso', 'created', 'indelible', 'image', 'show', 'would', 'continue', 'rest', 'decade', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'well', 'made', 'shows', 'television']",NYPD Blue - Season 1

My only peeve was the sex. Do we really need to see Sipowicz naked getting it on with a prostitute? I'm not a prude, but I really prefer to leave that to my imagination. Thank you very much. I also thought Kelly was a bit of a jerk to Janice. She was going through enough without him giving her the third degree and the cold shoulder. And what's with all the women? He divorces his wife and then has more dates than captain Kirk. I wish the writers toned it down. Kelly just isn't  THAT good looking. Some of the other character's love life's might've been more interesting to see fleshed out.Overall, this is an excellent series for fans of police drama.

Of course, Sipowicz isn't the only stereotype, as there are the standard Jewish neurotics, Irish blowhards, Italian mobsters, and others that Hollywood so frequently counts on, even if ""NYPD Blue"" (and the various ""Law and Order"" incarnations) continues the bizarre trend of making New York seem a lot less racially diverse than it really is.
