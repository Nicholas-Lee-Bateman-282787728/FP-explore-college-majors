196117,A34AWBSX28FA8C,6162251020,Esmerelda,"[8, 8]","A soon-to-be princess and her teacher are at the beginning of a newly blossoming love-then her father kills his father and brother and things go from bad to worse. These were always the risks of being royal, no matter what country. This is based on true Korean history. The story is riveting, never boring, the chemistry between the two leads is softly, compellingly passionate, and they are both yummy. Don't know how else to explain it. Great story from beginning to end, like another period piece-'The Moon That Embraces the Sun'. Every time I see a good asian drama, I think they just can't get any better, then they do! That is not to say they're ALL great. But it really doesn't get better than this.",5,In My Top 10!,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,706,"['soon-to-be', 'princess', 'teacher', 'are', 'beginning', 'newly', 'blossoming', 'love-then', 'father', 'father', 'brother', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'were', 'always', 'risks', 'being', 'royal', 'matter', 'what', 'country', 'based', 'true', 'Korean', 'history', 'story', 'riveting', 'never', 'boring', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'softly', 'compellingly', 'passionate', 'are', 'yummy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'explain', 'Great', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'period', ""piece-'The"", 'Moon', 'Sun', 'Every', 'time', 'see', 'good', 'asian', 'drama', 'think', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'say', ""'re"", 'great', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'better']",Princess' Man / Kongjooui Namja Korean Tv Drama Dvd NTSC All Region (Korean Audio with Good English Subtitle) 6 Dvd Digipak Boxset
196118,A2Y4AGDHAHIFRL,6162251020,Katie Scarlet,"[3, 3]","I saw this on Hulu. It is a tear jerker with humor thrown in. It was fun getting to know these characters. I took two vacation days to watch 24 episodes and wanted to watch it again. The acting, the music score, the pairing up of these actors was superb. It's a very inspiring, character building story. I enjoyed it more than The Great Queen Seondeok, which I liked very much also. But The Princess' Man entertained me from beginning to end. I believe the south Koreans can teach Americans how to make a good movie without using sex, nudity and bad language. The English subtitles were done well. There were only 2-3 times I needed to rewind. By the way, I seldom give the maximum rating on anything.",5,A Masterpiece,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,701,"['saw', 'Hulu', 'tear', 'jerker', 'humor', 'thrown', 'was', 'fun', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'took', 'two', 'vacation', 'days', 'watch', '24', 'episodes', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'acting', 'music', 'score', 'pairing', 'actors', 'was', 'superb', 'very', 'inspiring', 'character', 'building', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'Great', 'Queen', 'Seondeok', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'also', 'Princess', 'Man', 'entertained', 'beginning', 'end', 'believe', 'south', 'Koreans', 'can', 'teach', 'Americans', 'how', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'using', 'sex', 'nudity', 'bad', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'were', 'only', '2-3', 'times', 'needed', 'rewind', 'way', 'seldom', 'give', 'maximum', 'rating', 'anything']",Princess' Man / Kongjooui Namja Korean Tv Drama Dvd NTSC All Region (Korean Audio with Good English Subtitle) 6 Dvd Digipak Boxset
