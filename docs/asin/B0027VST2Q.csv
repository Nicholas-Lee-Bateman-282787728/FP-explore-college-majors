The great standards this series established in all of its previous seasons, are upheld, and then some! The writing, the acting, the humor and the drama - it all seamlessly unfolds and draws you in, convincingly serious at the same time as being utterly funny. Brenda and Fritz are one of the loveliest couples on TV, while the leadership Brenda stamps her professional position with, is never portrayed in a glaringly aggressive way. A complex and multi-dimensional leader like Brenda can be fierce, as well as humanly frail (and prone to a weakness for sweets). One of my favorite TV series - can't wait to see the next seasons!
