167450,AS5OHRD21JDCT,0971366306,bzcarin,"[10, 10]","This is a terrific way to introduce your children (and yourself) to ASL.  The pace is slow...like a video board book.  By the time you have watched it through, you actually KNOW some signs.  If your children are like mine, we watch a new video several times the first day after it arrives in our home.  This was no exception.  So, by the time we ate dinner that night, we all could show Daddy several signs.  My children are ages 10, 6, 4, and 16 months.  We have enjoyed learning together and signing with the youngest especially.  It is so exciting when she signs to us and people are amazed(some had said that babies couldn't really learn to sign--which is apparently a wrong assumption!). We began months ago to simply teach the baby the signs we were learning,but now she watches the video herself and signs along.  We plan on learning more ASL now. I highly recommend this great video as a wonderful way to begin learning American Sign Language!  With this video, you and your children will learn some ASL painlessly!",5,A Super Start,1029801600,"08 20, 2002",2002,1023,"['terrific', 'way', 'introduce', 'children', 'ASL', 'pace', 'slow', 'video', 'board', 'book', 'time', 'have', 'watched', 'actually', 'KNOW', 'signs', 'children', 'are', 'mine', 'watch', 'new', 'video', 'several', 'times', 'first', 'day', 'home', 'was', 'exception', 'So', 'time', 'ate', 'dinner', 'night', 'could', 'show', 'Daddy', 'several', 'signs', 'children', 'are', '10', '6', '4', '16', 'months', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'together', 'signing', 'youngest', 'especially', 'so', 'exciting', 'when', 'signs', 'people', 'are', 'amazed', 'had', 'said', 'babies', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'learn', 'sign', 'apparently', 'wrong', 'assumption', 'began', 'months', 'simply', 'teach', 'baby', 'signs', 'were', 'learning', 'now', 'video', 'signs', 'along', 'plan', 'learning', 'more', 'ASL', 'now', 'highly', 'recommend', 'great', 'video', 'wonderful', 'way', 'begin', 'learning', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language', 'video', 'children', 'will', 'learn', 'ASL', 'painlessly']",Baby See 'N Sign VHS
167451,AC464CPPM6REA,0971366306,j. glenn,"[4, 5]","While this is a very good video, many of the signs are made at the BOTTOM of the screen and they are hard to see what she is doing.  The signs SHOULD always be made in the line of sight, or at the main focal point - the center of the screen.Also they frequently fail to incorporate the appropriate activity or object in the picture, they just have the lady standing there saying a word and signing it.  For an adult, or older child that is fine, but boring.  A baby needs the object or activity, along with the spoken and signed word.  But, overall, compared to most of this type of video available, it is good.  I got spoiled with &quot;Talking Hands&quot; video, and wish others were as well done.",4,Very good with room for improvement,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,699,"['very', 'good', 'video', 'many', 'signs', 'are', 'made', 'BOTTOM', 'screen', 'are', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'signs', 'SHOULD', 'always', 'be', 'made', 'line', 'sight', 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'center', 'screen.Also', 'frequently', 'fail', 'incorporate', 'appropriate', 'activity', 'object', 'picture', 'just', 'have', 'lady', 'standing', 'there', 'saying', 'word', 'signing', 'adult', 'older', 'child', 'fine', 'boring', 'baby', 'object', 'activity', 'spoken', 'signed', 'word', 'overall', 'compared', 'most', 'type', 'video', 'available', 'good', 'got', 'spoiled', 'quot', 'Talking', 'Hands', 'quot', 'video', 'wish', 'others', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'done']",Baby See 'N Sign VHS
167452,A1LGPBPDGOALKW,0971366306,"Monica Beyer ""Signing mom and author""","[17, 17]","My son is hearing and has been using sign language since he was 12 months old. He's now 2 1/2 and an &quot;old pro&quot; at mastering new signs and using known ones. His speech is developing rapidly now and I treasure videos like these to keep him interested in sign language.I am not fluent in sign by any means but I still know quite a few signs. This video was instantly valuable to *me* as a parent because I learned new signs right off the bat. It's been said that it is extremely difficult to learn signs from illustrations in a book. Your best bet is to find a deaf person, a sign langauge interpreter, or purchase a video like this one. It has over 60 signs in it and the sign presenter does each sign very clearly.I recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out signing with their baby or even &quot;old pros&quot; like Corbin and me. This is definitely an excellent video to give as a gift to a child of any age or even adults. Of course, sometimes we like to keep the good ones for ourselves!",5,Great Video,1003968000,"10 25, 2001",2001,1012,"['son', 'hearing', 'been', 'using', 'sign', 'language', 'was', '12', 'months', 'old', 'now', '2', '1/2', 'quot', 'old', 'pro', 'quot', 'mastering', 'new', 'signs', 'using', 'known', 'ones', 'speech', 'developing', 'rapidly', 'now', 'treasure', 'videos', 'keep', 'interested', 'sign', 'language.I', 'am', 'not', 'fluent', 'sign', 'means', 'still', 'know', 'quite', 'few', 'signs', 'video', 'was', 'instantly', 'valuable', '*me*', 'parent', 'learned', 'new', 'signs', 'right', 'bat', 'been', 'said', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'learn', 'signs', 'illustrations', 'book', 'best', 'bet', 'find', 'deaf', 'person', 'sign', 'langauge', 'interpreter', 'purchase', 'video', 'one', 'over', '60', 'signs', 'sign', 'presenter', 'sign', 'very', 'clearly.I', 'recommend', 'book', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'signing', 'baby', 'even', 'quot', 'old', 'pros', 'quot', 'Corbin', 'definitely', 'excellent', 'video', 'give', 'gift', 'child', 'age', 'even', 'adults', 'course', 'sometimes', 'like', 'keep', 'good', 'ones']",Baby See 'N Sign VHS

My children definitely enjoy that DVD more.  There are children doing signs and lots of music and it is very playful.  However, the See 'N Sign DVDs have more signs and they are a little cheaper.  If you are wanting to have a variety of programs to teach & reinforce signs to your child, then these are a good buy.Also, these are available on DVD at their website.",3,Pretty Good,1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,491,"['recently', 'purchased', 'Signing', 'Time', 'then', 'Baby', 'See', 'N', 'Sign', 'Vol.1', '2', 'Signing', 'Time', 'believe', 'better', 'younger', 'children', 'children', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'more', 'are', 'children', 'doing', 'signs', 'lots', 'music', 'very', 'playful', 'However', 'See', 'N', 'Sign', 'DVDs', 'have', 'more', 'signs', 'are', 'little', 'cheaper', 'are', 'wanting', 'have', 'variety', 'programs', 'teach', 'reinforce', 'signs', 'child', 'then', 'are', 'good', 'buy.Also', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'website']",Baby See 'N Sign VHS
