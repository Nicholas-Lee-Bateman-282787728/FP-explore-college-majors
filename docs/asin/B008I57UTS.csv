1553776,ASRUYRC3R5J6Q,B008I57UTS,sasha,"[6, 6]","If you read the book you probably know how the movie ends.  If not, then here is a synopsis.Three women residents are sharing an apartment and working at a hospital in San Francisco.  Paige (Gail O'Grady) is destined to become a heart surgeon; Kat (Vanessa Williams) is dealing with a troubled past and Beth (Brooke Shields) appears to be addicted to sex - appears is the operative word here.Daily life in the hospital is fraught with crises; men who take advantage of the women doctors; doctors who demand more of the women than the men.  Long days; even longer nights. The women doctors care for their patients - too much according to their superior.Supporting the cast is Gerald McRaney who plays an eminent heart surgeon; Lloyd Bridges who plays a patient dying of cancer; and a Gregory Harrison is the hospital administrator who puts himself first always.Lloyd Bridges (Mr. C) is in terrible pain.  He asks Paige to end his life.  And she is arrested for murder.The trial is fascinating - in the midst of it one of the women doctors has a fatal accident and a baby is born.This is a 3 hour movie.  It is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.This is an engrossing movie that keeps your attention.  I love long movies. I think you will enjoy it.",5,"MURDER, A FATAL ACCIDENT, A BABY",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1253,"['read', 'book', 'probably', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'not', 'then', 'here', 'synopsis.Three', 'women', 'residents', 'are', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'working', 'hospital', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Paige', 'Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'destined', 'become', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'Kat', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'dealing', 'troubled', 'past', 'Beth', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'be', 'addicted', 'sex', 'operative', 'word', 'here.Daily', 'life', 'hospital', 'fraught', 'crises', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'women', 'doctors', 'doctors', 'who', 'demand', 'more', 'women', 'men', 'Long', 'days', 'even', 'longer', 'nights', 'women', 'doctors', 'care', 'patients', 'too', 'much', 'according', 'superior.Supporting', 'cast', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'who', 'eminent', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'who', 'patient', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Gregory', 'Harrison', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'who', 'first', 'Bridges', 'Mr.', 'C', 'terrible', 'pain', 'Paige', 'end', 'life', 'arrested', 'murder.The', 'trial', 'fascinating', 'midst', 'one', 'women', 'doctors', 'fatal', 'accident', 'baby', 'born.This', '3', 'hour', 'movie', 'closed', 'captioned', 'hearing', 'impaired.This', 'engrossing', 'movie', 'attention', 'love', 'long', 'movies', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A
