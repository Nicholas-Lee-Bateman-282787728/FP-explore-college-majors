I'm not a fan of ghost stories generally and would normally warn those who aren't to shy away from this series. However, if you can get by the ghosts, several of the episodes use the ghost story as a plot device to explore compelling HUMAN stories (somewhat like Hewitt's filmIf Only). As such, even if you don't like ghosts, read on:The good:In the episodes I've seen at least, the story with the ghosts provided a segway into a far more compelling human drama. For example, in one episode I saw, the ghosts torment a father and daughter who feel guilty over the mother's death. The emotionally compelling part of the episode was seeing the father and daughter deal with their guilt and frustration. Hewitt, as the ghost whisperer, indirectly helps these catharses.Now, the bad:The ghosts aren't subtle. With a few exceptions (generally shadows in a dark room), the ghosts look and act just like normal people, only that ""only"" Hewitt can see them. There's no especially pale skin, glow, or anything else to make the ghosts seem anything more than, well, hollywood actors. Unfortunately, this detracts from the show as it makes it harder to take the ghosts seriously.In short, if you like the type of sitcom/dramas generally shown on the WE channel, you might like Ghost Whisperer. Don't be too turned off by the ghosts in the stories (even if the ghosts can get snarky at times). However, this isn't a sci-fi series or comedy sitcom.",3,"Some decent personal drama, but silly ghost stories",1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,1553,"['[', 'note', 'review', 'series', 'not', 'DVDs', 'so', 'much', ']', 'So', 'what', 'Jessica', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'up', 'days', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'ghost', 'stories', 'generally', 'would', 'normally', 'warn', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'series', 'However', 'can', 'get', 'ghosts', 'several', 'episodes', 'use', 'ghost', 'story', 'plot', 'device', 'explore', 'compelling', 'HUMAN', 'stories', 'somewhat', 'Hewitt', 'filmIf', 'Only', 'such', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ghosts', 'read', 'good', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'story', 'ghosts', 'provided', 'segway', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'human', 'drama', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'saw', 'ghosts', 'torment', 'father', 'daughter', 'who', 'feel', 'guilty', 'mother', 'death', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'part', 'episode', 'was', 'seeing', 'father', 'daughter', 'deal', 'guilt', 'frustration', 'Hewitt', 'ghost', 'whisperer', 'indirectly', 'catharses.Now', 'bad', 'ghosts', 'are', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'few', 'exceptions', 'generally', 'dark', 'room', 'ghosts', 'look', 'act', 'just', 'normal', 'people', 'only', 'only', 'Hewitt', 'can', 'see', 'especially', 'pale', 'skin', 'glow', 'anything', 'else', 'make', 'ghosts', 'seem', 'anything', 'more', 'well', 'hollywood', 'actors', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'harder', 'take', 'ghosts', 'seriously.In', 'short', 'like', 'type', 'sitcom/dramas', 'generally', 'shown', 'WE', 'channel', 'might', 'like', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'turned', 'off', 'ghosts', 'stories', 'even', 'ghosts', 'can', 'get', 'snarky', 'times', 'However', ""n't"", 'sci-fi', 'series', 'comedy', 'sitcom']",Ghost Whisperer: Three Season Pack

Anyway,  This show is about a woman who sees the dead,  she got the gift from her grandmother but after a while you learn her mother has the gift also.  She has a loving husband who is very accepting of the gift. I recall during one episode he mentioned that he works so hard on his job tryin to save lives cause hes afraid that if someone dies they will go running to his wife.  ( he is a fireman ).  They have their sad moments, silly moments, after a while they even adopt a ghost dog.  Which she tries to figure out how to cross over.  She and her husband seem to be the perfect couple through the whole series and you grow to love them.  She has a best friend, who knows her secret. Who leaves for some reason I won't tell everything,  she gains a new best friend.. who isn't as accepting of her gift.. and well.  Its a great series and i LOVE it.  cant get enough of it.  Jennifer Love is wonderful.  Beautiful, and acts great.  Im sure anyone who enjoys shows like medium or supernatural would LOVE this show as well.  Any questions, bug me.. id be more than happy to answer them.Once i get the time ill do a review of every episode, one by one :)",5,Season 1-3,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,1259,"['did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'set', 'did', 'may', 'have', 'saved', '*few*', 'bucks', 'got', 'season', '1-3', 'came', 'out', 'Anyway', 'show', 'woman', 'who', 'dead', 'got', 'gift', 'grandmother', 'while', 'learn', 'mother', 'gift', 'also', 'loving', 'husband', 'who', 'very', 'accepting', 'gift', 'recall', 'one', 'episode', 'mentioned', 'so', 'hard', 'job', 'tryin', 'save', 'lives', 'cause', 'hes', 'someone', 'will', 'go', 'running', 'wife', 'fireman', 'have', 'sad', 'moments', 'silly', 'moments', 'while', 'even', 'adopt', 'ghost', 'dog', 'Which', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'cross', 'over', 'husband', 'seem', 'be', 'perfect', 'couple', 'whole', 'series', 'grow', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'secret', 'Who', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'everything', 'gains', 'new', 'best', 'friend..', 'who', ""n't"", 'accepting', 'gift..', 'well', 'great', 'series', 'i', 'LOVE', 'cant', 'get', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'wonderful', 'Beautiful', 'great', 'Im', 'sure', 'anyone', 'who', 'shows', 'medium', 'supernatural', 'would', 'LOVE', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'questions', 'bug', 'me..', 'id', 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'answer', 'them.Once', 'i', 'get', 'time', 'ill', 'do', 'review', 'episode', 'one', 'one']",Ghost Whisperer: Three Season Pack

Her mission is to help troubled ghosts cross to the light (aka go to heaven).*Reasons I liked Ghost Whisperer:1) Jennifer Love Hewitt - Her acting is astounding. She takes on her persona as Melinda like butter on bread (pardon the cheesy simile). The emotion she shows is as close to real emotion as it gets.2)The main extended plot amused me . . .It was very intriguing mystery up to the point it was solved3)The religious symbolism (there's a word for it, but I can't quite remember what it is...) - I'm not very religious myself, but I find all kinds of relgion fascinating . . .This and I'm a sucker for symbolism (I've written way too many papers on symbolism...haha)4) The twist at the very end of the first season - I'm not going to say what it is, but let me just say it had me for the loop!Reasons I was disapointed with Ghost Whisperer:1) The actor who played Melinda's husband's acting was pretty bad . . .I'm just going to leave it at that...2)Somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd season, it was from just being a regular drama/paranormal/suspenseful show to a soap-opera that would even put Grey's Anatomy to shame (nah . .not really, but it got pretty bad...)3) I miss Melinda's first ""best friend"" . . .She left the show (I heard the actress wanted a raise or someting and didn't get it, but that's what everybody says when some main or main-ish character leaves a show...)",3,First Season is Fantastic!...And then it goes downhill.....,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,1526,"['*Summary', 'seasons', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Melinda', 'clairvoyant/psychic/whatever', 'call', 'who', 'can', 'hear', 'see', 'talk', 'ghosts', 'mission', 'help', 'troubled', 'ghosts', 'cross', 'light', 'aka', 'go', 'heaven', '*Reasons', 'liked', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer:1', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'acting', 'astounding', 'persona', 'Melinda', 'butter', 'bread', 'cheesy', 'simile', 'emotion', 'as', 'close', 'real', 'emotion', 'main', 'extended', 'plot', 'amused', '.It', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'solved3', 'religious', 'symbolism', 'word', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'religious', 'find', 'kinds', 'relgion', 'fascinating', '.This', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'symbolism', ""'ve"", 'written', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'papers', 'symbolism', 'haha', '4', 'twist', 'very', 'end', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'what', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'had', 'loop', 'Reasons', 'was', 'disapointed', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer:1', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Melinda', 'husband', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', '.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'leave', '2', 'Somewhere', '2nd', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'regular', 'drama/paranormal/suspenseful', 'show', 'soap-opera', 'would', 'even', 'put', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'shame', 'nah', '.not', 'really', 'got', 'pretty', 'bad', '3', 'miss', 'Melinda', 'first', 'best', 'friend', '.She', 'left', 'show', 'heard', 'actress', 'wanted', 'raise', 'someting', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'everybody', 'when', 'main', 'main-ish', 'character', 'show']",Ghost Whisperer: Three Season Pack
