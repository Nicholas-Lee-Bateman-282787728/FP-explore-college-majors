This band was named Queen by Mercury on July 12 of that year (the actual start of Queen) but Groce left and Queen did not get thier classic and perminant line up until John Deacon joined them in February 1971 (the true start of Queen). That was also when they really became a touring band.In 1974 at the Rainbow concert Queen started being recorded in concert consistantly and from this point to 1979s Live Killers they were at thier best as a live band. This Dvd does not capture this period with it 5 major shows from 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1979 still overdue for full official release. It features Queen near the end of a transitional period where they went from no offstage/onstage additional musician as late as November 1979 (still just Queen) to one used at every concert at the end of 1982 and no keys in concert to keys played mainly by this musision and often.

The songs from Hot Space Action this Day, Back Chat, Staying Power are great as all of course and I remember wanting hard rock and more of it. That is why Queen is the best all the different styles they mastered and now the world finally appreciates it. I know there are millions of Freddie worshipers out there but I always loved Queen because of Brian May and Roger Taylor. In my opinion the best Guitarist/drummer combo ever and don't forget the fantastic John Deacon keeping it all in rythm. Speaking of which Deacy actually moves around and rocks a bit on this night, you know they were on fire. I was lucky enough to see them 7 times and every time was amazing and I always dragged some skeptical friends along promising if they could honestly tell me it was not one of the best shows they ever saw I would pay for ticket. I never had to repurchase a single ticket. Anyway this concert is amazing and I rank it over Montreal, Budapest, Wembley just because of the energy and tightness they had, they were truly at the peak during this tour and Rolling Stone magazine was always busy bashing them.

The performances were amazing and the music was compelling.  What amazed me the most was the quality of both images and sound for a performance recorded in 1982.  The concert was outdoors.  It started in the afternoon and went into the evening.  Despite the dramatic change in light levels from day to night the images were clear, there was no grain, and the color was excellent.  The remixed sound was wonderful -- there was strong base and treble.  There was also a wide sound stage.

Again, this is 1982.  Technology has greatly improved since then.  In any case, it's been restored very nicely.  If you keep the time period in mind, you should have no problem enjoying this brilliant concert performance, despite it's expected visual limitations.Most impressive about this concert is how the sound has been so brilliantly restored and remastered.  Thumbs up to the remastering team behind the project -- Justin Shirley-Smith and Kris Fredriksson.  I was a bit unsure of purchasing this DVD, concerned that the sound quality wouldn't be all that impressive, considering the master tapes date way back to 1982.  I was wrong!  1982?  No way!  It sounds as clear as many concerts released in only the past decade.  In fact, the audio is better than the concert recorded 4 years later -- 1986's 'Live At Wembley.'  It's nice to hear so much effort and work go into remastering the audio, sounding much better than a lot of other releases from that era released recently on DVD.  I'm just surprised that so much detail can be pulled from the original master tapes to give such a fulfilling audio experience.

862563,A1EWKXSKBU42MG,B00067BC4U,Manny,"[17, 18]","What do you get when the worlds greatest live rock band performs in front of 40,000 loyal fans? Queen On Fire At The Bowl and then some. As you may or may not be aware of, Queen had (and may still have) the largest fan club in the world, and it seemed as if the entire fan club was at this particular concert.Queen On Fire At The Bowl was recorded live at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 5, 1982. On Fire showcases Freddie's voice in top form. Rarely have I heard Freddie use trills as much as he did in this concert. His vocals were extremely powerful and pretty much controlled throughout the set with the exception of Action This Day where Freddie seems to struggle to maintain his upper range. Freddie, however bounced back with powerful vocal renditions of Play The Game, Staying Power and of course my favorite of the three, Somebody To Love. Freddie's ""Impromtu Lauch"" (from Ryan M's review) into Somebody was something different and special to listen to. Another Freddie highlight was the ""Impromtu"" sing along with the audience where Freddie has them singing like Aretha Franklin. Even the audience has their own highlight when they sing a nice rendition of Love of My Life. Hearing the audience sing this song reminded me of the Rock In Rio concert where it sounded like all 250,000 fans sang along. This made me realize how truly loved this song is.Though Freddie's voice was probably the highlight of the show, It does take the four of them to play Queen music. I have to say that Roger Taylor's drum playing was excellent this night. Roger was never one to show off his playing skills, but this night he seemed to tease us with a lot of little drum fills that were pretty impressive. I was disappointed that Keep Yourself Alive was not a part of this set. I think Roger would have shined.John Deacon was his usual quiet self, however his bass playing seems to stand out more in this set, especially during songs with his more recognized bass lines such as Bite The Dust and Under Pressure. John also plays Rhythm Guitar during Staying Power.Brian May's guitar work was pretty steady during this gig, however he seemed to lose direction during his solo. I've always believed that Brian play's his best solos when he does the full version of Brighton Rock. It just seems as if he needs the beginning of Brighton Rock to launch his solo, it seems to get all 4 of his cylinders going, as evident in his solo at the Hammersmith Odeon Christmas concert.Over all I think that this performance by Queen was one of their best performances, deserving the title On Fire At The Bowl.The picture quality of this DVD could have been better, it was a bit grainy and dark in some parts, there  but then again what can one expect from a recording from 1982. The sound quality was great in 5.1 DTS however, the stereo sound quality is surpassed by the Live at Wembley sound. The bonus footage features extra live performances from Seibu Stadium Tokyo, Japan and Stadthalle, Vienna, Austria, and rare interviews with Freddie, Brian and Roger. This DVD set also features a nice photo gallery of the band which is shown during a live recording of Calling All Girls.For queen fans, this is a definite must, and for music fans who want to know what all the hoopla's about when it comes to Queen's live show, here it is. This is the second dimension to Queens live abilities. The third will be Live At The Hammersmith Odeon where Queen struts their heavy stuff.

Not released on video, ""Queen On Fire - Live At The Bowl"", marks the first time a recording of this concert has been available to own.As to be expected from Queen, the release comes only after extensive restoration to the original footage and sound. Audio producers Justin Shirley-Smith and Kris Fredriksson returned to the original 24 track analogue recording and created brand new PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 surround sound mixes. As with all previous releases in the Queen DVD Collection, ""Queen On Fire -Live At The Bowl"" comes with a second disc full of bonus features. The 75 minutes of extras include behind the scenes footage of preparations for the concert, together with unseen material from interviews filmed on the day with Brian May and Roger Taylor. Further interview footage shot in Munich during the European leg of this tour shows Freddie, Brian and Roger discussing the tour, the then current Hot Space album, as well as discussing the 10 year longevity of the band.In addition, disc two provides over 35 minutes of bonus live performance from the same year, filmed at the Vienna Stadthalle in May and the final show of the tour at Tokyo's Seibu Stadium in November.The disc also features a photo gallery which raids the Queen photo archive in a stunning collection of rare and previously unseen shots from the 1982 tour that took the band across Europe, the US and Japan. In a real treat for Queen collectors, the gallery is displayed to a recording of the band performing ""Calling All Girls"" at that year's Tokyo concert, the very first time this track has been made available.Track listing:1- Flash2- The Hero3- We Will Rock You (fast)4- Action This Day5- Play the Game6- Staying Power7- Somebody To Love8- Now I'm Here9- Dragon Attack10- Love of my Life11- Save Me12- Back Chat13- Get Down Make Love14- Guitar Solo15- Drum Solo16- Under Pressure17- Fat Bottomed Girls18- Crazy Little Thing Called Love19- Bohemian Rhapsody20- Tie Your Mother Down21- Another One Bites the Dust22- We Will Rock You23- We Are the Champions24- God Save the QueenVideo: 1.33 - full screenAudio: DTS 5.1 surround, PCM stereoRelease date: November 9th.

I don't care for Morgan Fisher on piano playing which is noticeable on ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love."" We Will Rock You is done twice and they finish ""Now I'm Here"" after Dragon Attack. It appears they did that sort of thing a lot, but I only have Wembley so I didn't know.You have those annoying scratch marks as well that are a lot worse than on the Wembley DVD. From Memory on the video casette version of Wembley, I don't remember seeing any scratch marks on the viedo at all! Strange that! There are too many of those ""Hot Space"" songs. I don't know why they chose ""Back Chat"" live, seems as if they could have chose a better one.On the other hand! the concert goes really fast and it's really heavy! Yeah!!! I often think to myself it's only a couple of steps away from Heavy Metal when I listen to these guys! The concert appears to move on a lot more than Queen, and that's great. Overall I think the setlist is fine because they cover a whole range of material! These Hot Space songs performed live sound so much better! Even Back Chat sounds good! As what other people have said Freddie Mercury's voice is in top form. He is very youthful on this concert and he is a bit more ""riscae"" on this concert. This is Queen at one of the best moments of thecareer, Wembley being a bit better, even though his voice isn't his best their. And this is Queen doing what they want on ""Live at the Bowl.""I don't care what people think of me saying this, I don't like the name of the group being mixed in with a title.

862566,A1HGQBE8ZSI58,B00067BC4U,Nick Mackler,"[5, 6]","WOW! I just purchased this DVD 2 days before writing this review, and I was amazed at how wonderful a concert Queen gave at the Bowl. This epic concert is a must buy on DVD, featuring sheer rock n' roll from Queen as well as their best tracks from ""Hot Space""(it had some nice tunes, even if you were one of those Queen fans who hated that album, i.e. Under Pressure, Staying Power(both performed by the way).The concert takes off once we hear the sensational perfomance of the hit track ""Play the Game"". Freddie's voice is on the mark in pretty much throughout the concert and we hear some wonderful guitar riffs from Brian May. If you're into Queen, check out this live DVD because it is arguably one of the best Live performances ever given by them. It features some great drum work from Roger Taylor which a great bonus to Brian May's big guitar solo half way through.As an addition, the DVD also features exclusive interviews with the band and tour highlights in Japan and France which are a great plus. We get to hear a better performance of Another One bites the dust and the band's thoughts on the tour and how the band is doing in terms of chemistry.This 2 disc DVD set is everything you would hope to expect, and more from one of the greatest rock n' roll bands of all time.Song Highlights:Play the Game: We hear sensational piano playing and great vocals from Mercury on this track and the guitar solo from May is brilliant.Crazy little thing called love: An all around brilliant performance from the crew and Mercury surprises us all with impressive playing on an acoustic guitar.Bohemian Rhapsody: Always a treasure to hear, and especially when you hear a performance of the song like this. Wonderful piano playing from Mercury, and the rock section of the song is sensational.Tie Your Mother Down: WOW! This is about the heaviest the concert gets, and it is performed perfectly.Overall, this DVD concert is a must buy for any Queen fan. Even if you're just into the hits from Queen, you'll adore this concert. Well, what are you waiting for?

And I mean over and over and never growing tired of them. Of course I'm a real die hard Queen fan being one year older than Freddie and just recently starting myQueen collection. I wish I had gone to the concert they did on tour in Denver. Both my daughters went with dates. It just hurts that I was so occupied with my life that I didn't take more time for such an opportunity. So I've been building my collection and it sort of keeps me going these days. Retirement is boring much of the time and I recommend Queen music videos as a most excellent way to spice up your visual and audio senses. I still want anything else that I can find by Queen and Freddie Mercury is the most beloved lead singer I've ever seen or heard. I look forward to the upcoming movie and I want to get as much Queen as I can because I know the prices will soar after that. I am in America and it is hard to ever hear a queen song on the radio although you can request them but America is cheated when u can't go into a normal store and purchase a queen album. This will change I believe when the movie comes out. I could talk on and on. I love each member of Queen. And Freddie you are loved and missed and I thank you all for the glorious music and the glam.

862572,A1EE8EZLR8LJ9M,B00067BC4U,Stephen Morrison Lewis,"[91, 93]","It's easy to see why some people would claim this was Queen at their peak.  This is a very solid concert,  very high energy,  and very Queen.Of course,  there are flaws in the actual video,  due to the date of the concert and the lack of huge budgets for live videos at the time.  These shouldn't be a problem for your enjoyment,  however,  unless you really dig picture perfect presentation.  Queen was more about the show anyway,  and the sounds are pretty top notch.  The visual performance is every bit as good,  even if the video doesn't always capture a picture perfect reflection of it.My only real issue is that Brian's vocals appeared to be heavily buried in the mix.  I know that Brian has never had the presence of Freddie or even Roger,  but his vocals should be a little more obvious.  This could,  however,  be a flaw in the actual recording of the concert,  and doesn't ruin the disc at all.Otherwise,  Freddie Mercury is on the entire night.  Queen's presentation is simply excellent.  This is,  perhaps the only chance to catch ""Hot Space"" tracks in full versions on video (Action this day,  Staying Power,  Backchat).  While the hot Space album is considered by many fans to be the low point of Queen's career,  it's part of the Queen experience (And I am personally a fan of Staying Power and Backchat).  Hearing ""Hero"" from Flash Gordon live is also a solid option.The high points of this show are many,  but include:  We Will rock You (Fast),  Somebody to Love,  Now I'm Here,  Dragon Attack (on of my favorites),  Back Chat,  Get Down,  Make Love (The visual presentation in the bridge of this song is amazing),  Fat Bottomed Girls,  and Tie Your Mother down.In total,  this video does capture Queen in a strong light,  whether this is at their ""peak"" or not.  Highly recommended to Queen fans,  or just fans of a good live show.",5,They really were on fire,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,1851,"['easy', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'claim', 'was', 'Queen', 'peak', 'very', 'solid', 'concert', 'very', 'high', 'energy', 'very', 'Queen.Of', 'course', 'are', 'flaws', 'actual', 'video', 'due', 'date', 'concert', 'lack', 'huge', 'budgets', 'live', 'videos', 'time', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'enjoyment', 'however', 'really', 'dig', 'picture', 'perfect', 'presentation', 'Queen', 'was', 'more', 'show', 'anyway', 'sounds', 'are', 'pretty', 'top', 'notch', 'visual', 'performance', 'bit', 'good', 'even', 'video', ""n't"", 'always', 'capture', 'picture', 'perfect', 'reflection', 'it.My', 'only', 'real', 'issue', 'Brian', 'vocals', 'appeared', 'be', 'heavily', 'buried', 'mix', 'know', 'Brian', 'never', 'had', 'presence', 'Freddie', 'even', 'Roger', 'vocals', 'should', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'obvious', 'could', 'however', 'be', 'flaw', 'actual', 'recording', 'concert', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'disc', 'all.Otherwise', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'entire', 'night', 'Queen', 'presentation', 'simply', 'excellent', 'perhaps', 'only', 'chance', 'catch', 'Hot', 'Space', 'tracks', 'full', 'versions', 'video', 'Action', 'day', 'Staying', 'Power', 'Backchat', 'hot', 'Space', 'album', 'considered', 'many', 'fans', 'be', 'low', 'point', 'Queen', 'career', 'part', 'Queen', 'experience', 'am', 'personally', 'fan', 'Staying', 'Power', 'Backchat', 'Hearing', 'Hero', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'live', 'also', 'solid', 'option.The', 'high', 'points', 'show', 'are', 'many', 'include', 'Will', 'rock', 'Fast', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'Now', ""'m"", 'Here', 'Dragon', 'Attack', 'favorites', 'Back', 'Chat', 'Get', 'Down', 'Make', 'Love', 'visual', 'presentation', 'bridge', 'song', 'amazing', 'Fat', 'Bottomed', 'Girls', 'Tie', 'Your', 'Mother', 'down.In', 'total', 'video', 'capture', 'Queen', 'strong', 'light', 'peak', 'not', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Queen', 'fans', 'just', 'fans', 'good', 'live', 'show']",N/A
862573,A1OML05BTJBEKS,B00067BC4U,"Terrence J. Reardon ""Classic rock and old sch...","[4, 4]","In November of 2004, Queen released its fourth live album and fifth concert video Queen On Fire Live at the Bowl.This live DVD and its off-shoot album was recorded and filmed at The Milton Keynes Bowl outside London, England on June 5, 1982 and directed superbly by Directed by Gavin Taylor.Not officially released on video or CD, Queen On Fire Live At The Bowl marked the first time a recording of this concert has been LEGITIMATELY available to own as a 70 or 80 minute edit had been available on the bootleg recording circuit.Audio producers Justin Shirley-Smith and Kris Fredriksson returned to the original 24 track analog tapes recorded by 80s Queen co-producer Mack and Mick McKenna with The Rolling Stones Mobile Truck and created brand new regular stereo(for the CD and one of the two DVD mixes)) and DTS 5.1 surround sound mixes(found on the DVD).We kick off as the band hits the stage with the entrance music of Flash before the band dives into a spirited version of The Hero. Next is a killer We Will Rock You (fast version) complete with Brian May popping a guitar string and the music was left alone. Next is Action This Daywith drummer Roger Taylor and Freddie Mercury duetting on this rocker and John Deacon adding some bass which was muted on the studio recording and Brian playing his Red Special backup as his Red Special had to get a new string and Morgan Fisher did a great synthesizer solo substituting for the saxophone solo. Then Freddie does a nice piano intro which goes into an excellent Play the Game. Next is another Hot Space track Staying Power which is transformed into a rocker with Deaky and May playing guitars plus Roger bashing live drums and Freddie being on fire here. Next is arguably this live set's best track Somebody To Love which buries its studio counterpart by a longshot. Next is Now I'm Here which is excellent with a Freddie/audience vocal duel before segueing into Dragon Attack which rocks although Brian blew yet another string on his Red Special guitar and had to use his Red Special back up for the finale solo and the reprise to Now I'm Here. Next is a nice version of Love of My Life with Brian playing an impromptu teaser of Las Palabras De Amor before starting the track. Save Me is next and is done with more power than the studio counterpart. Deaky's Back Chat ends the first CD as the funk track is turned into a full-on rocker with Roger playing the drums like a man possessed, Brian's guitar dominating, John playing his Music Man Stingray bass and Freddie singing his heart out.The second CD begins with Get Down Make Love which is a great short version which then segues from its middle section into Brian's Guitar Solo which is amazing despite the fact his guitar cord came undone(you can see this on DVD unedited) and Brian finishes with some help from Roger's drumming. Roger does an uncredited 30 second Drum Solo at the end of the guitar solo track as a lead in to Under Pressure which is an excellent version of the track. Next is Fat Bottomed Girls which rocks and Freddie's voice was electronically fixed on the part where he says LOCALITY which his voice cracked on the original Milton Keynes BBC airing. We then have a rocking Crazy Little Thing Called Love which is great. Then we have Freddie play a nice piano solo leading into possibly the best live version of Bohemian Rhapsody ever. We then rock out with the set closing Tie Your Mother Down which rocks. The first encore of Another One Bites the Dust is a great spirited version. Sheer Heart Attack follows and is more aggresive than either the News of the World version or the Live Killers version. We then have the second encore of the traditional We Will Rock You with audience participating and a stellar We Are the Champions. We then have the band say farewell as God Save the Queen plays over the PA.The second DVD features interviews with Brian and Roger backstage before the Milton Keynes show. Also, interviews with Roger and Brian and a separate Freddie interview filmed for Austrian TV talking about ten years of Queen. We also have some of the long out of print video Queen Live in Japan 1982 which has the band pulling out some songs not on the Milton Keynes how like Impromptu, Put Out the Fire and a spirited Teo Torriatte. Also, there is a photo montage set to the previously unreleased live reading of Calling All Girls.This DVD is recommended!",5,The title says it all on this great live Queen DVD!,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,4394,"['November', '2004', 'Queen', 'released', 'fourth', 'live', 'album', 'fifth', 'concert', 'video', 'Queen', 'Fire', 'Live', 'Bowl.This', 'live', 'DVD', 'off-shoot', 'album', 'was', 'recorded', 'filmed', 'Milton', 'Keynes', 'Bowl', 'London', 'England', 'June', '5', '1982', 'directed', 'superbly', 'Directed', 'Gavin', 'Taylor.Not', 'officially', 'released', 'video', 'CD', 'Queen', 'Fire', 'Live', 'Bowl', 'marked', 'first', 'time', 'recording', 'concert', 'been', 'LEGITIMATELY', 'available', 'own', '70', '80', 'minute', 'edit', 'had', 'been', 'available', 'bootleg', 'recording', 'circuit.Audio', 'producers', 'Justin', 'Shirley-Smith', 'Kris', 'Fredriksson', 'returned', 'original', '24', 'track', 'analog', 'tapes', 'recorded', '80s', 'Queen', 'co-producer', 'Mack', 'Mick', 'McKenna', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Mobile', 'Truck', 'created', 'brand', 'new', 'regular', 'stereo', 'CD', 'one', 'two', 'DVD', 'mixes', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mixes', 'found', 'DVD', '.We', 'kick', 'off', 'band', 'stage', 'entrance', 'music', 'Flash', 'band', 'spirited', 'version', 'Hero', 'Next', 'killer', 'Will', 'Rock', 'fast', 'version', 'complete', 'Brian', 'May', 'popping', 'guitar', 'string', 'music', 'was', 'left', 'alone', 'Next', 'Action', 'Daywith', 'drummer', 'Roger', 'Taylor', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'duetting', 'rocker', 'John', 'Deacon', 'adding', 'bass', 'was', 'muted', 'studio', 'recording', 'Brian', 'playing', 'Red', 'Special', 'backup', 'Red', 'Special', 'had', 'get', 'new', 'string', 'Morgan', 'Fisher', 'did', 'great', 'synthesizer', 'solo', 'substituting', 'saxophone', 'solo', 'Then', 'Freddie', 'nice', 'piano', 'intro', 'excellent', 'Play', 'Game', 'Next', 'Hot', 'Space', 'track', 'Staying', 'Power', 'transformed', 'rocker', 'Deaky', 'May', 'playing', 'guitars', 'Roger', 'bashing', 'live', 'drums', 'Freddie', 'being', 'fire', 'here', 'Next', 'arguably', 'live', 'set', 'best', 'track', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'studio', 'counterpart', 'longshot', 'Next', 'Now', ""'m"", 'Here', 'excellent', 'Freddie/audience', 'vocal', 'duel', 'segueing', 'Dragon', 'Attack', 'Brian', 'blew', 'yet', 'string', 'Red', 'Special', 'guitar', 'had', 'use', 'Red', 'Special', 'back', 'up', 'finale', 'solo', 'reprise', 'Now', ""'m"", 'Here', 'Next', 'nice', 'version', 'Love', 'My', 'Life', 'Brian', 'playing', 'impromptu', 'teaser', 'Las', 'Palabras', 'De', 'Amor', 'starting', 'track', 'Save', 'Me', 'next', 'done', 'more', 'power', 'studio', 'counterpart', 'Deaky', 'Back', 'Chat', 'first', 'CD', 'funk', 'track', 'turned', 'full-on', 'rocker', 'Roger', 'playing', 'drums', 'man', 'possessed', 'Brian', 'guitar', 'dominating', 'John', 'playing', 'Music', 'Man', 'Stingray', 'bass', 'Freddie', 'singing', 'heart', 'second', 'CD', 'Get', 'Down', 'Make', 'Love', 'great', 'short', 'version', 'then', 'middle', 'section', 'Brian', 'Guitar', 'Solo', 'amazing', 'fact', 'guitar', 'cord', 'came', 'undone', 'can', 'see', 'DVD', 'unedited', 'Brian', 'finishes', 'help', 'Roger', 'drumming', 'Roger', 'uncredited', '30', 'second', 'Drum', 'Solo', 'end', 'guitar', 'solo', 'track', 'lead', 'Pressure', 'excellent', 'version', 'track', 'Next', 'Fat', 'Bottomed', 'Girls', 'Freddie', 'voice', 'was', 'electronically', 'fixed', 'part', 'where', 'LOCALITY', 'voice', 'cracked', 'original', 'Milton', 'Keynes', 'BBC', 'airing', 'then', 'have', 'rocking', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'Called', 'Love', 'great', 'Then', 'have', 'Freddie', 'play', 'nice', 'piano', 'solo', 'leading', 'possibly', 'best', 'live', 'version', 'Bohemian', 'Rhapsody', 'ever', 'then', 'rock', 'out', 'set', 'closing', 'Tie', 'Mother', 'Down', 'first', 'encore', 'One', 'Dust', 'great', 'spirited', 'version', 'Sheer', 'Heart', 'Attack', 'more', 'aggresive', 'News', 'World', 'version', 'Live', 'Killers', 'version', 'then', 'have', 'second', 'encore', 'traditional', 'Will', 'Rock', 'audience', 'participating', 'stellar', 'Are', 'Champions', 'then', 'have', 'band', 'say', 'farewell', 'God', 'Save', 'Queen', 'PA.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'features', 'interviews', 'Brian', 'Roger', 'backstage', 'Milton', 'Keynes', 'show', 'Also', 'interviews', 'Roger', 'Brian', 'separate', 'Freddie', 'interview', 'filmed', 'Austrian', 'TV', 'talking', 'ten', 'years', 'Queen', 'also', 'have', 'long', 'print', 'video', 'Queen', 'Live', 'Japan', '1982', 'band', 'pulling', 'out', 'songs', 'not', 'Milton', 'Keynes', 'how', 'like', 'Impromptu', 'Put', 'Out', 'Fire', 'spirited', 'Teo', 'Torriatte', 'Also', 'photo', 'montage', 'set', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'live', 'reading', 'Calling', 'Girls.This', 'DVD', 'recommended']",N/A
