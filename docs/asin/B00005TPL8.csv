682267,AR9XYZ13R8Y2O,B00005TPL8,"Johann Cat ""Grauer Kater""","[6, 9]","These lectures begin with an intellectually ambitious attempt to use Chomskian linguistics to suggest that music has units of meaning analogous to language.  I follow his argument with interest, but I never quite buy it.  Music is simply not verbal, and Bernstein's effort with linguistics seems an exquisite but somewhat misguided exercise in metaphor.  Bernstein seems out of his element in talking about linguistics, but one has to admire his work; as in most of his endeavors, he does it with verve, energy, and wit.  The lectures then evolve into a history of western music that is decidedly romantic: Beethoven becomes (implicitly) a high point in musical evolution, and music that experiments with dissonance and tone rows is seen as finally an uncertain exploration.  The ""unanswered question""  is: should music leave the gravity of familiar western tonalities and units of meaning?  Bernstein is not reactionary in his meditations, as he plays Schoenberg, Berg, and directs Ives, who gives the title to the set, all  in a spirited way.  His own performances of 20th century music say more than he speaks in words about such music.  But one may intuit that Bernstein's career as a maestro of a big city orchestra and its commercial responsibilities shaped his view that meaning must always be somewhat traditional.  Still, Bernstein has to be one of the most charming figures of the twentieth century, and I find it a pleasure to pop one of these discs in in alternative to the mayhem and drek that is on the 180 channels I have in alternative, even as I puzzle over the justice of some of his claims.",4,Fascinating and Self-challenging in Its Claims,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1609,"['lectures', 'begin', 'intellectually', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'use', 'Chomskian', 'linguistics', 'suggest', 'music', 'units', 'meaning', 'analogous', 'language', 'follow', 'argument', 'interest', 'never', 'quite', 'buy', 'Music', 'simply', 'not', 'verbal', 'Bernstein', 'effort', 'linguistics', 'exquisite', 'somewhat', 'misguided', 'exercise', 'metaphor', 'Bernstein', 'element', 'talking', 'linguistics', 'one', 'admire', 'work', 'most', 'endeavors', 'verve', 'energy', 'wit', 'lectures', 'then', 'evolve', 'history', 'western', 'music', 'decidedly', 'romantic', 'Beethoven', 'becomes', 'implicitly', 'high', 'point', 'musical', 'evolution', 'music', 'dissonance', 'tone', 'rows', 'seen', 'finally', 'uncertain', 'exploration', 'unanswered', 'question', 'should', 'music', 'leave', 'gravity', 'familiar', 'western', 'tonalities', 'units', 'meaning', 'Bernstein', 'not', 'reactionary', 'meditations', 'Schoenberg', 'Berg', 'Ives', 'who', 'title', 'set', 'spirited', 'way', 'own', 'performances', '20th', 'century', 'music', 'say', 'more', 'words', 'such', 'music', 'one', 'may', 'intuit', 'Bernstein', 'career', 'maestro', 'big', 'city', 'orchestra', 'commercial', 'responsibilities', 'shaped', 'view', 'meaning', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'somewhat', 'traditional', 'Still', 'Bernstein', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'figures', 'twentieth', 'century', 'find', 'pleasure', 'pop', 'one', 'discs', 'alternative', 'mayhem', 'drek', '180', 'channels', 'have', 'alternative', 'even', 'puzzle', 'justice', 'claims']",N/A
682268,A4E7GD5DPTAAL,B00005TPL8,Lawrence Miller,"[6, 6]","Leonard Bernstein is more than a great musician, more than a conductor and composer. He is a great teacher and it is never more evident than in these six lectures. Given that the lectures number six, my five stars for this collection should also number six.They are demanding. They are complex. So much so that Bernstein in some cases implies he is not himself sure of a point. So he examines it more.Many of his points are illustrated in impromptu fashion at the piano. Many are illustrated with videos of him conducting the related music with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and once with the Vienna Philharmonic.You WILL be using your rewind button as you re-view complex points before moving on. Of course, the guilty pleasure of this learning process is just watching Lenny (or is it Lennie?) himself who is so animated, as if he were conducting himself.As I write I have watched 5 of the 6 DVDs. The fifth ends with a lecture on esthetics focusing on Mahler's Ninth and especially on its final movement. This may be the finest esthetics lecture I've ever heard. The DVDs do not come with a book but you may well want the book with the text and the musical illustrations, especially to reread the Mahler lesson/discourse at the end of the fifth lecture.These were delivered in 1973 when the Vietnam War was still ongoing and Richard Nixon was president. It was also just a few years after the Beatles had disbanded and he references them a few times as well. Lenny is most assuredly the icon of cultured person, but a cultural snob he ain't!You will learn the relationship between the spoken word and meaning in music, with examples from Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Wagner, Ravel, Berg and Schoenberg, and Mahler, as well as a lot of memorized (!!!) poetry. You will learn to listen to Beethoven's Sixth without hearing the peasants and birds and thunderstorm. Believe me.I am extremely enthusiastic about this. Of course, cheap it ain't. But you can make a light and inexpensive dinner at home and consume it while consuming an hour or so of the Bernstein material, thus using your time and money judiciously. Each DVD runs a few hours, and while I haven't timed them, some seem to run 1-1/2 and some 3 hours, so you get a lotta stuff for your money.

682269,A2SP1ZS9YK3DQE,B00005TPL8,"Mark Grindell ""Mark Grindell""","[79, 94]","Its quite interesting that in the late 20th century, there was a progresive tendency to look for a number of grand schemes, many of which would be familiar to you guys, perhaps some of which would not be. One obvious example is that tremendous effort to find an underlying theory of physics which would combine relativity and quantum mechanics - another are more obscure attempts to reconcile set theory with certain models within category theory which had been giving trouble to a certain set of number theoretians - etc, etc.But the human dimension to this appeared, almost as one man in the form of Chomsky. His book, &quot;Aspects of the theory of Syntax&quot;  was the tip of the iceberg of a huge number of papers published on the deep structure of language while he was working at MIT. This appeared to offer clues as to aspects of the structure of ANY human language, an utterly amazing claim. Some of his later works give clues to the possible existence of a universal paradigm for language which has massive implications for people in so many disciplines, I couldn't begin to enumerate.This all started, by the way, on the route to attempting the final cataloguing of the North American indian languages, some of which had only one remaining speaker. The task was huge and unapproachable until Chomsky evolved a system for abbreviating certain grammatic structures, which, to his surprise, evolved into a powerful predictive theory.Anyone exposed to this at the time would have been impressed, but what was to follow was even more amazing. Chomsky's ideas swiftly melded with other theories of semantics and syntax transformations in different fields, and became de-rigeour for many PhDs in computer science and anthropology, uniting what was up until that time two very, very different disciplines. Citations to his work began to appear everywhere, and in the most amazing places.An illustration of what was to follow THAT is basically contained here. no less, a unified theory of language and music![You ought to get this - it is undoubtedly a brilliant scholarly work in any case, even if you don't concur with Bernstein on all points - and few would exactly agree with him on all, nor, importantly, would you need to, to benefit from this.]The argument presented is quite intuitive, but is nontheless compelling. Music is shown as being a byproduct of our humanity, extended from need in whatever form, as an infant, or an adult, from utility into sophisticaion, and finally inspiration.  Bernstein makes sure the listener is in no doubt that there is something way, way beyond necessity in our provision for the experience of music. His explanation of the physics of music is flawless, and ... awe inspiring. And, watching the man traverse this enormous gap between logic, physics, liguistics, and the unnameable majesty of Beethoven and Debussy (both of which he performs as a conductor, and is moved greatly and visibly) is utterly breathtaking. I would doubt that anyone watching his exposition of the 6th would be any less moved in this way.Apart from any of this, Bernstein entertains enormously. There are parts of his explantions that truly defy you not to laugh. He has an honesty and self effacement that is quite unusual, this comes out particularly in his efforts to sing, which he pokes quite a bit of fun at. It's obvious how passionately his audience is involved. (He describes at length a discussion with a student after one lecture in the next one - and its clear that both student and teacher really have learned quite a bit but have obviously been a little combatative, at least, at first)From there on, you might care to differ a bit. The history of the 20th Century is described rather neatly as the showdown between Schoenburg and Stravinsky, two schools of thought, two very different philosophies. He enters this very complex consideration fairly gently. I agree with his approach - and understanding of the environment of the early 20th century is essential if one is to understand its music - and so he described Debussy, who is ... sort of.. at the end of the Waagnerian era, stretching ambiguity and tonal resources to the uttermost. Can one go further? Yes indeed, and here we have the entry of the Viennese school of 12 tone technique, illustrated with Schoenburgs six little piano pieces. But oddly enough, Bernstein shows very clearly that the appearance of 12 tone technique is not unequivically Schoenburgs' alone, but appears in the guise of mists and mirages in Chopin, Wagner, even Beethoven, but grasped once and for all by Schoenburg.Given another five or so lectures, one might imagine that one could explore the use of bitonality, not just in the context of the Rite of Spring (which is most EXCELLENTLY explained), but the mid century English composers, who use this technique. Such people as Holst, Grainger, Williams, Strauss, and of course, Britten. But there isn't time. The end point of these complications is the resolution into a robust defence of neo-classicism, such as the ebony concerto, and of course, Oedipux Rex. But I think that this is a sad way to end - Rex is a sombre, hard work, and doesn't quite illustrate the end that either Schoenburg or Stravinsky seem to have unknowingly appointed for that part of the 20th century. In this, Bernstein may have overlooked that really recent developoments in Europe, that of an emerging new impressionism (even, perhaps, Romanticism), exemplified by Xenakis, Maderna, Berio, and others, who in some sense share some parts of both ends of the bipolar world which was the basis for all this in the middle part of that century.All this is debatable. For instance, not a mention is given to either those very radical spirits like Varese, who seemed to eschew both ends equaly - or those, like Sibelius, Delius or Neilson, who didn't seem to mind either way, and continued to write what is now known as the mid century symphonic repertoire.That is a long, long story, and could form the basis of a lot of commentary. Where, for instance, is Shostakovich in all this? Or Bartok, for that matter? I think this is all dealt with elsewhere, but I would have given a great deal to have seen these composers discussed at length.But this set of lectures is so valuable as a signpost, I would never do anything other than highly, highly recommend it.It's absolutely magnificent.",5,The theory of everything,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,6380,"['quite', 'interesting', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'was',

Some of them run nearly 3 hours, but I never become bored of them.  Bernstein, with his contageous energy, enthusiasm and excellent communication skills, shares his views and thoughts with such pleasant ways; it is just irresistible.  Just to prove my point, my husband, who has no musical background and had no idea what the maestro was talking about when he watched the first lecture with me, gave a delightful cry of amazement each time Bernstein demonstrated on the piano.  Needless to say, he was glued to the screen and watched it till the end without a hint of boredom.The lectures are highly intellectual, and to understand what he's talking about, you need musical background, but even if you don't understand at all, it is still very enjoyable.Humphrey Burton writes in his Bernstein's biography that Bernstein was having such good time being with young people at Harvard, he kept on delaying and delaying to complete these lectures.  You can see that the maestro enjoys so much sharing what he knows with not only Harvard students but with all the world.  His theme is universality of music and brotherhood of human kind through music.  Some of his thoughts and ideas are so very unique and different; they amuse me at the same time make me think.Even though the questions are not all answered (the more he talks, the more questions arise, I have to admit), his spirit is well delivered, and that alone makes this DVD a treasure worth having.",5,I'm glued to the screen,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,1620,"['technical', 'musical', 'matters', 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'say', 'collection', 'lectures', 'delight', 'watch', 'listen', 'run', 'nearly', '3', 'hours', 'never', 'become', 'bored', 'Bernstein', 'contageous', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'excellent', 'communication', 'skills', 'shares', 'views', 'thoughts', 'such', 'pleasant', 'ways', 'just', 'irresistible', 'Just', 'prove', 'point', 'husband', 'who', 'musical', 'background', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'maestro', 'was', 'talking', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'lecture', 'gave', 'delightful', 'cry', 'amazement', 'time', 'Bernstein', 'demonstrated', 'piano', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'glued', 'screen', 'watched', 'end', 'hint', 'boredom.The', 'lectures', 'are', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'understand', 'what', 'talking', 'need', 'musical', 'background', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable.Humphrey', 'Burton', 'Bernstein', 'biography', 'Bernstein', 'was', 'having', 'such', 'good', 'time', 'being', 'young', 'people', 'Harvard', 'kept', 'delaying', 'delaying', 'complete', 'lectures', 'can', 'see', 'maestro', 'so', 'much', 'sharing', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'Harvard', 'students', 'world', 'theme', 'universality', 'music', 'brotherhood', 'human', 'kind', 'music', 'thoughts', 'ideas', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'unique', 'different', 'amuse', 'same', 'time', 'make', 'think.Even', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'answered', 'more', 'more', 'questions', 'arise', 'have', 'admit', 'spirit', 'well', 'delivered', 'alone', 'DVD', 'treasure', 'worth', 'having']",N/A

Bernstein is always interesting and enthusiastic in these sorts of things, but he also tends to ramble and drag in everything but the kitchen sink in order to buttress his points.  He attempts to connect his musical theory of ""innateness"" to the development of speech patterns--unnecessarily in my view, and the connection is never really fully explained.  In the end he concludes the 20th century characteristics in art--of irony, existentialism, and self-reference--are a result of the horrors of modern times, of the Holocaust, the two world wars, and the nuclear age.  It's a premise put forth in his ""Age of Anxiety"" Symphony and I didn't buy it then either.  Never does he explain *why* one leads to the other, he just seems to assume the relationship is evident.  And, I hate to appear to be upstaging Bernstein, but I think I have a simpler and easier-to-defend thesis (and it's not my original idea, either).I agree the modern artistic age is characterized by irony, references (self and other) and a revisiting of the old in new clothes.  However, I don't see any link to the ""horrors of the 20th century"" as to why we can't directly say ""I love you"" when we mean ""I love you.""  Rather, I think the reason irony and assorted deconstructionist techniques sprang up in the 20th century is because we finally had the history and the heritage for them to exist and make sense.  Musical language was direct  in Mozart's time, in Bach's time, in Beethoven's time, because they were inventing it.  By the time we reach Mahler, it is fully developed and we find ourselves in the process of ""deconstructing"" it (or he did).  Before that time, there wasn't the heritage and history *to* deconstruct.  To make my point, jazz, despite coming of age in the ashes of World War I, didn't become ironic and deconstructionist through the first half of the 20th century, until the 1950s.  Its deconstruction was borne not from any of the horrors of the Holocaust or the atom bomb, but from its own accumulation of tradition and technique.  Ditto the cinema.  In short, you can't deconstruct until there's construction.So Bernstein's argument, in my view, doesn't entirely hold water, but is the very sort of Romantic and poetic vision that appeals to him.  (On another documentary I have, he waxes poetic on the anguish and turmoil trapped in the person of Gustav Mahler while never bothing to back up his thesis with a shred of documentary evidence.)  However, while I don't agree with his conclusion, the journey he takes to get there is fascinating and thrilling, filled with analyses of such landmark works as Mozart's Symphony No. 40, Beethoven's Pastorale Symphony, Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, Berg's Violin Concerto, and Stravinsky's Le Sacre, just to name a few.  Also, his discussions of tonality, the ""Circle of Fifths"" and the evolution of Western harmony are fascinating.  There's a certain amount of annoying preening--there are times when he's really milking his little Harvard audience for applause, and you'd think that by that point in his career he wouldn't need it--but this is easy to overlook.  The video is clean and the audio is quite good for the time.  Overall I do recommend this set highly, but beware Lenny's excessive Romanticisms!",3,"* * * 1/2 - Brilliant, though Lenny tends to throw in everything...",1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,3450,"['kitchen', 'sink.This', 'series', 'talks', 'presented', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'Harvard', '1973', 'many', 'fascinating', 'components', 'overall', 'thesis', 'argument', 'search', 'point', 'Bernstein', 'always', 'interesting', 'enthusiastic', 'sorts', 'things', 'also', 'ramble', 'drag', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'order', 'buttress', 'points', 'connect', 'musical', 'theory', 'innateness', 'development', 'speech', 'patterns', 'unnecessarily', 'view', 'connection', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'explained', 'end', '20th', 'century', 'characteristics', 'art', 'irony', 'existentialism', 'self-reference', 'are', 'result', 'horrors', 'modern', 'times', 'Holocaust', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'nuclear', 'age', 'premise', 'put', 'forth', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Symphony', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'then', 'either', 'Never', 'explain', '*why*', 'one', 'other', 'just', 'assume', 'relationship', 'evident', 'hate', 'appear', 'be', 'upstaging', 'Bernstein', 'think', 'have', 'simpler', 'easier-to-defend', 'thesis', 'not', 'original', 'idea', 'either', '.I', 'agree', 'modern', 'artistic', 'age', 'characterized', 'irony', 'references', 'self', 'other', 'revisiting', 'old', 'new', 'clothes', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'link', 'horrors', '20th', 'century', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'directly', 'say', 'love', 'when', 'mean', 'love', 'Rather', 'think', 'reason', 'irony', 'assorted', 'deconstructionist', 'techniques', 'sprang', 'up', '20th', 'century', 'finally', 'had', 'history', 'heritage', 'exist', 'make', 'sense', 'Musical', 'language', 'was', 'direct', 'Mozart', 'time', 'Bach', 'time', 'Beethoven', 'time', 'were', 'inventing', 'time', 'reach', 'Mahler', 'fully', 'developed', 'find', 'process', 'deconstructing', 'did', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'heritage', 'history', '*to*', 'deconstruct', 'make', 'point', 'jazz', 'coming', 'age', 'ashes', 'World', 'War', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'ironic', 'deconstructionist', 'first', 'half', '20th', 'century', '1950s', 'deconstruction', 'was', 'borne', 'not', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'atom', 'bomb', 'own', 'accumulation', 'tradition', 'technique', 'Ditto', 'cinema', 'short', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deconstruct', 'construction.So', 'Bernstein', 'argument', 'view', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'hold', 'water', 'very', 'sort', 'Romantic', 'poetic', 'vision', 'appeals', 'documentary', 'have', 'poetic', 'anguish', 'turmoil', 'trapped', 'person', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'never', 'bothing', 'back', 'up', 'thesis', 'shred', 'documentary', 'evidence', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'conclusion', 'journey', 'get', 'fascinating', 'thrilling', 'filled', 'analyses', 'such', 'landmark', 'works', 'Mozart', 'Symphony', 'No', '40', 'Beethoven', 'Pastorale', 'Symphony', 'Wagner', 'Tristan', 'Isolde', 'Berg', 'Violin', 'Concerto', 'Stravinsky', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'Also', 'discussions', 'tonality', 'Circle', 'Fifths', 'evolution', 'Western', 'harmony', 'are', 'fascinating', 'certain', 'amount', 'annoying', 'preening', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'really', 'milking', 'little', 'Harvard', 'audience', 'applause', ""'d"", 'think', 'point', 'career', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'easy', 'overlook', 'video', 'clean', 'audio', 'quite', 'good', 'time', 'Overall', 'do', 'recommend', 'set', 'highly', 'beware', 'Lenny', 'excessive', 'Romanticisms']",N/A
