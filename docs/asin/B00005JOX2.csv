Obviously I could either stay up and watch a movie and get a good talking to from my boss the next day for showing up late and half asleep, or go on my hunch and the trailer I saw and buy it on DVD... which I did!Now, before we get into the actual movie itself... there is one issue I had with this product and that is the fact that you can't simply skip all the trailers before the movie and jump directly to the menu... you need to skip each trailer like chapters... and trust there are quite a few trailers to skip. That actually took some of the anticipation away... I got a bit tired of having to skip so many trailers!As for the movie itself, those who've seen the movieSnatch (Widescreen Edition)will not rate this movie as high as people who have not seen it... I think that that movie has set the standard (well, at least for me) for this type of gangster movie which usually have rather surprising twist towards the end of the plot and that is why I can only go as high as a four for this movie.The movie is full of surprises to say the least!! You will find a surprise in this movie with almost every single development! The characters are unique and quirky but nearly as much as inSnatch (Widescreen Edition)! (Brick Top, Boris the blade, and Bullet-tooth Tony) Bruce Willis seems to always play his usual cool and soft spoken bada%% which is kind of worn out to by honest... I think the role of Slevin was excellently casted where you really sympathize with Slevin throughout the movie. Ben Kingsley, there were scenes in the moive towards the end where he kept speaking in an exaggerated tone while he was making a weird mouth... why!? It was just an obvious case of overacting to me... I know he is a great actor but that's the way I saw it... (unless somebody can explain it to me).Overall a nice movie to have in your collection if you are generally a Mafia / gangster movie buff... but for all of those reading this review who have not yet seenSnatch (Widescreen Edition)orLock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (Widescreen Edition)... you need to see them!!

643379,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JOX2,A Customer,"[12, 18]","This ridiculous movie, which is just recycled Quentin Tarrentino brashness, is so ludicrously over-plotted and so absolutely in love with it's hipness that this viewer really had to struggle to get to the end of it. Just like the recent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Lucky Number Slevin is yet another irreverent excessively violent crime thriller that purports to by edgy and gritty.Thinking their story is smarter, edgier and cleverer than it actually is, the filmmakers hinge the story on a case of mistaken identity. Clad in a low slung towel for most of the film, Josh Hartnett plays Levin, a good-humored twenty-something who misguidedly gets himself caught in a face-off between a thuggish rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and an impassive crime lord (Morgan Freeman) imaginatively named Boss on the streets of New York.There's also Bruce Willis as a cool and smirking hit man, who figures into the mix, as does a flighty coroner (Lucy Liu, the film's lone bright spot) who lives next store to Levin and helps him sort out the various riddles and settle some scores along the way. The film begins with an extended back-story from the 1970's involving gangsters, murder and horseracing and once you put two and two together Slevin's relationship to the underworld kingpins isn't exactly hard to deduce.The movie's final twist is ridiculous and the overly talky script is downright irritating. Slevin's plot twists, action antics and potent cast may hold your interest for about the first ten minutes, but regardless of its immediate violent thrills, this revenge thriller / crime tale gradually loses it's luster as it disentangles in the threadbare threads of its own contrivances.And then there's Josh Hartnett - he's fabulous eye candy, but his performance is so bland and lackluster that it lacks the essential ingredient of urgency. It's the final indignity to an audience who has suffered through two hours of smug sadism - and subliminal homophobia - in the pretext of ""entertainment."" Stay well away from this one.

643392,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B00005JOX2,Beau Yarbrough,"[1, 1]","Back in 1995, ""The Usual Suspects"" blew my mind, like it did to a lot of people. It was clever, it used an unconventional (at the time) narrative structure and it played fair with all its twists and turns.Soon after, it was totally overshadowed by all the filmmakers trying to do their versions of ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it was inevitable that someone, someday, would channel ""The Usual Suspects."" And that's just what ""Lucky Number Slevin"" does.That's not a bad thing: I love ""The Usual Suspects,"" but just like the films created by all the would-be Tarantinos, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a lesser film than the one it apes. It's a bit too clever with the dialogue -- which, despite deleted scenes showing how much many of the scenes were cut down, could still use still more cutting -- and the character bits are more clever than plausible much of the time. What mobsters would really be called the Rabbi and the Boss? The stylized nature of the film is either too stylized for a realistic film or not stylized enough for a less realistic one.That said, it's an entertaining ride.

643394,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00005JOX2,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[3, 3]","OK, so ""Lucky Number Slevin"" falls easily into the Tarantino/""Pulp Fiction"" mold, from it's graphic violence and plot twists, to the off-beat humor and quirky characterizations. And it won't take long to guess what the big 'secret' is that holds everything together (although it is intriguing to see who fits where in the scheme of things). Saying all this, however, I really enjoyed ""Slevin""!A lot of the entertainment of the film comes from first-rate actors obviously enjoying themselves. Trapped in a case of mistaken identity, Josh Hartnett, sporting a broken nose and lack of wardrobe in the early part of the film, takes every mishap and disaster with such aplomb that it's easy to see why mob bosses Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley look at him in stunned bewilderment (remember the gangster in the Marx Brothers' ""Monkey Business"" hiring the totally whacked-out Groucho and Company as shipboard bodyguards? Hartnett has that same ""Are we on the same page?"" attitude as the Marxes). Even more fun is the relationship between Hartnett and neighbor Lucy Lui (who has never been cuter or more energetic). When she walks into his 'borrowed' apartment, sees him naked, leaves, then pops back in, hoping to catch ""the next show"", you KNOW there is chemistry! And when was the last time you saw verbal sexual foreplay consisting of obscure James Bond trivia? That scene has such a Kevin Smith 'feel' to it that I looked for his name as a screenwriter!Bruce Willis is also fun, as a very smug hit man (he seems nearly 'typed' as a hit man or cop, these days). Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, and ""Forrest Gump's"" Mykelti Williamson also shine (it was nice seeing Aiello and Williamson, who I haven't seen much of, of late).Certainly, the ultimate 'pay-off' lacks the 'punch' of ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Memento"", or ""Go"", but it does reveal a compassion that is surprising, considering the body count!Taken as a whole, Paul McGuigan's jaunt into 'Tarantino Land' is stylishly diverting!",4,"Style Over Substance, But an Entertaining Ride!",1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,1978,"['OK', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'easily', 'Tarantino/', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'mold', 'graphic', 'violence', 'plot', 'twists', 'off-beat', 'humor', 'quirky', 'characterizations', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'guess', 'what', 'big', ""'secret"", 'everything', 'together', 'intriguing', 'see', 'who', 'where', 'scheme', 'things', 'Saying', 'however', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Slevin', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'film', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'obviously', 'enjoying', 'Trapped', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'sporting', 'broken', 'nose', 'lack', 'wardrobe', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'mishap', 'disaster', 'such', 'aplomb', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'mob', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'look', 'stunned', 'bewilderment', 'remember', 'gangster', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Monkey', 'Business', 'hiring', 'totally', 'whacked-out', 'Groucho', 'Company', 'as', 'shipboard', 'bodyguards', 'Hartnett', 'same', 'Are', 'same', 'page', 'attitude', 'Marxes', 'Even', 'more', 'fun', 'relationship', 'Hartnett', 'neighbor', 'Lucy', 'Lui', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'cuter', 'more', 'energetic', 'When', 'walks', ""'borrowed"", 'apartment', 'naked', 'leaves', 'then', 'back', 'hoping', 'catch', 'next', 'show', 'KNOW', 'chemistry', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'verbal', 'sexual', 'foreplay', 'consisting', 'obscure', 'James', 'Bond', 'trivia', 'scene', 'Kevin', 'Smith', ""'feel"", 'looked', 'name', 'screenwriter', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'also', 'fun', 'very', 'smug', 'hit', 'man', 'nearly', ""'typed"", 'hit', 'man', 'cop', 'days', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'also', 'shine', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Aiello', 'Williamson', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'late', '.Certainly', 'ultimate', ""'pay-off"", ""'punch"", 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Memento', 'Go', 'reveal', 'compassion', 'surprising', 'considering', 'body', 'count', 'Taken', 'whole', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', 'jaunt', ""'Tarantino"", 'Land', 'stylishly', 'diverting']",Lucky Number Slevin

First he gets mugged. Then he arrives at Nick's house (his friend's) to find him not at home. Slevin makes himself comfortable but is soon interrupted by Lindsey (a very perky and fun Lucy Liu), Nick's neighbor. They are instantly attracted to each other and the humorous sparks fly as they verbally joust with one another. Lindsey notices his battered nose (mugged?) and Slevin tells her what a terrible day he's having, which endears him even more to her.Shortly after Lindsey leaves, two thugs arrive and mistake him for Nick. They don't believe him when he tells them his name is Slevin and drag him out of the apartment clothed only in a bath towel. They take him to ""The Boss"" (Morgan Freeman) where he's told that Nick (i.e., him) owes a lot of money but can work it off by killing one man: the son of his biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).Soon after agreeing to do this, Slevin is then picked up by The Rabbi's thugs and told by him that he owes The Rabbi money, too, but can work it off by killing The Boss. Caught between the disbelief of two mob bosses about who Slevin really is, he's forced to make a decision. Or is he?At the beginning of the film we're introduced to a poor family man with a gambling problem. He bets a lot of money on a losing horse and soon he and his family are ""rubbed out"". And who killed the family? Yep. The Boss and The Rabbi before they became enemies. Bruce Willis plays Mr. Goodkat, a heartless assassin who eliminates the young boy of the losing gambler with a single bullet to the head. Or did he?Convoluted stories are often so complex that they lose cohesion and I was afraid that this might happen with LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN. Thankfully it didn't. The complexity is there and subtle, but handled with expert care by Aussie director Paul McGuigan. The flashbacks are impeccably pulled off as are the many action sequences. The fact that it all came together so nicely in the end made the entire movie watching experience effortless. Although I did try and figure out what was happening, there were so many well executed twists and turns that I was continually surprised and delighted.We always here the words ""ensemble cast"" when certain films come out with a few favorite actors sprinkled here and there, but this time the title is well deserved. Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, Kevin Chamberlin and a smattering of other notables round out this pristine cast.Comparisons between Tarantino's directorial style and Mr. McGuigan's have been made, but Paul McGuigan's methods, I think, are more subtle in tone but direct in execution (I hope that makes sense!).The other notable point in the film was location. The filming of the sets held a consistent circular theme to them, including wallpaper, stairways, and cups. This theme is well deserved, as a circle has no beginning and no end.",4,What's In A Name?

643413,A1G0EBQYLN6STU,B00005JOX2,Cinephiliac,"[4, 4]","The Kansas City shuffle, two rival crime lords, and a case of mistaken identity.  These are the key elements of the sly and devious little film ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" directed by Paul McGuigan (Gangster No. 1).After opening scenes of gruesomely operatic--and apparently unconnected--executions (some in the past and some present day), the film begins with Slevin (Josh Hartnett) in transit to his friend Nick Fisher's apartment.  Slevin has been having a very bad day.  He's lost his job, his apartment house has been condemned, and he came home to find his girlfriend getting busy with a stranger in their bed.  When Nick offers a quick 'get out of town' escape, Slevin jumps at the chance.  Unfortunately, on his way to Nick's apartment Slevin is mugged, his wallet stolen and his nose broken for good measure.  Arriving at the apartment, Slevin finds the door open and Nick nowhere to be found.Barely settled in, Slevin meets Nick's seriously adorable next door neighbor, Lindsey (Lucy Liu), and sparks immediately fly.  Their flirtation is short-lived, however, as Slevin is soon kidnapped by two different rival gangs--that of The Boss (Morgan Freeman)--and that of The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley)--who each inform him that he (Nick Fisher) owes them huge sums of money which he needs to make good on--or else.  Unable to prove that he is not Nick Fisher--and no one willing to simply take his word for it--Slevin finds himself owing large on Nick's debt.  The Boss is willing to cancel his debt in exchange for ""a favor.""  He is to kill the son of his former business partner and longtime rival, The Rabbi.  It seems that The Rabbi killed his son, and payback is in order.  Lurking about in the shadows is Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), a contract killer who seems to have plans of his own for Slevin.Who is the mysterious Mr. Goodkat?  What's happened to Nick?  Will Slevin be able to outwit The Rabbi and The Boss?  Is Slevin really even Slevin?  Is anything the way it appears to be?  These are the questions at the heart of the film.The movie is full of quirky, offbeat characters (Hassidic gangsters working for The Rabbi, the dim-witted henchman working for The Boss and the eccentric policemen watching the situation unfold from a stakeout van).  The rapid-fire, stylized dialogue, extreme 1970's set decor, and garish graphic and floral wallpaper designs all add to the cheerily macabre atmosphere of the film.  (I am sure that if there is wallpaper in Hell, it looks very much like the selection here.)Playing with the structure of noir crime films, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" puts an interesting spin on the form.  This film will probably appeal to those who enjoyed ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.""

From the beginning of the film on, we have to confront facts that could or couldn't be true. For instance, Mr. Goodkat's frightening story about the slaughter of an entire family told to Nick Fisher seems very much real to us but, as soon as the hitman kills Nick Fisher, we have doubts about the story's reality. Secondly, the rest of the film is told according to Slevin's subjective point of view so that we are led to believe that what Slevin sees or tells is necessarily true. Like in an Agatha Christie book, we have to wait for the last 10 minutes of the film to discover who was lying and what really happened during the former 90 minutes. It's the essence of Cinema : to manage to convince the audience that what is shown on the screen is true.Now, I didn't feel any peculiar Tarantino influence in LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN, the movie lives by itself and frankly, it deserves to be seen if you like a smart story with good actors such as Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Stanley Tucci, Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett.

With revenge and the mafia being two of the themes in the film, there is a fair amount of killings and violence, though not as much as a Tarantino movie. It includes a great cast and an interesting story.Josh Hartnett plays Slevin, a young man whose bad luck lands him in quite a bad situation - mistaken for someone else, he's kidnapped by two rival crime bosses, both looking for him to settle debts owed to them. Morgan Freeman plays The Boss, the one who wants Slevin to repay his debt by killing the rival boss's son in retribution for the murder of his own son. Ben Kingsley plays the other boss, known as the Rabbi, who gives Slevin a deadline to repay his outstanding debt. The two bosses live in penthouses in buildings across from one another, never leaving them in fear that the other will have them killed.Lucy Liu plays Lindsey, the neighbor whom Slevin falls in love with and who tries to help him uncover what is going on. She tracks down Smith, a hit man who is linked to both bosses somehow and is played by Bruce Willis. Finally, Stanley Tucci plays the detective tracking the two crime bosses who wants to find out who Slevin is and what role he has in everything.With multiple twists, the movie kept me guessing until the end. Like many revenge movies, the outcome and actions are somewhat morally questionable. Overall I found the movie to be an enjoyable thriller though.

643418,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B00005JOX2,David Bonesteel,"[8, 20]","A young man from out of town (Josh Hartnett) is mistaken for the friend he came to visit.  He is informed by a mobster known as the Boss (Morgan Freeman) that he can erase a $94,000 debt by killing the son of his rival, the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).  Feeling he has no alternative, he agrees.For me, this film fails on every level.  Its enigmatic opening tips us off that nothing is as it seems to be, which can be intriguing if handled correctly, but here it comes off as if director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Jason Smilovic are trying to be too clever for their own good.  The revelations at the end throw everything we have seen up to that point into doubt.  While I'm not interested enough to go back and watch it again with the benefit of knowing the ending, I'm pretty sure some pretty big plot holes still exist.  For example, wouldn't a powerful mob boss have some way to identify a man who owes him nearly 100K by sight?  Otherwise, people could skip out on their debts merely by changing apartments.

643420,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JOX2,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[2, 2]","With a dream cast director Paul McGuigan and writer Jason Smilovic team up to create the latest and best reincarnation of ""The Usual Suspects"" with sparkling dialogue and a thriller plot that twists until the fat lady sings.  Starring Josh Hartnett as Slevin, a feckless young man caught in a gang war with his pants down and Bruce Willis as Goodkat, the iron assassin who almost never fails, ""Slevin"" capitalizes on the father-child buddy movie with skill and elegance and features the best dialogue since ""Pulp Fiction.""  It is great to see first rate banter once again a part of blood-thirsty vengeance--together they make such beautiful music.  It has elements of the Newman's ""Road to Perdition"" with the first rate dialogue and excellent plot treatment of ""The Sting.""Just as Kevin Spacey's character in ""Suspects"" was so hopeless he was great, so is Josh Hartnett as the innocent Slevin caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Collared by two outstanding thug caricatures in a friend's apartment during a chance visit, he is mistaken for a poor stiff who owes inappropriate debts to inappropriate people.  What ensues is some of the most entertaining flashback story-telling since ""Suspects"" with the best rough and tumble dialog since ""Pulp Fiction.""  None of the dialogue is ad-libbed--it is all spoken exactly as penned by Smilovic.  According to director McGuigan ""The words were so particular to this film that if the voice were to change, it would change the film dramatically...""  Kudos for him--at least for this film it works.Lucy Liu plays Lindsey, the over-involving girl next door who comes to borrow a cup of sugar from Slevin's friend and almost shares his fate at the hands of Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis).  If the film has a failing it is that these youngsters are too good to be true.  But compared to the character of Lindsey, the Mt. St.Helens of ever-erupting freshness, it is easy for the old fogies in the film to look bad.  Or at least to look old.  Liu continues on her run of box office successes after her role as Cottonmouth in Tarantino's smash hits ""Kill Bill"" Volumes 1 and 2 and as Alex, one of the deadly trio in ""Charlie's Angels.""Which brings us to Messrs. Freeman and Kingsley, two men whose skills and reputations have passed the professional into the legendary.  If you have time before you see this film, see Sir Ben in ""Sexy Beast,"" possibly the best depiction of a real gangster in the last twenty years.  Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci in ""Goodfellas"" are the only ones who come close.  His recent box-office buster as Fagan in ""Oliver Twist"" had more lines than his part as Schlomo ""The Rabbi"" in this film, but was nowhere near as good.  Smilovic wrote the part of The Rabbi specifically for Kingsley and Sir Ben is able to take that brutally realistic gangster persona from ""Sexy Beast"" and bring those memories into the exact time-adjusted part for this film.  He is the same character, only aged to perfection--cranky in his old age, but still mean as a snake as ruthless as they come.Morgan Freeman has taken bits and pieces from his ""Million Dollar Baby"" character of Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, the washed-up palooka who still packs a punch and con Red Redding in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and grafted them together into this visage of ""The Boss"", an aging black man who sacrificed everything to rise to the top of the New York mob.  There is nobody he hasn't killed or had killed, however innocent, to further his rise to the top.  But he can never forget the friendship he used to have with his arch-rival The Rabbi.  He can never stop wondering if his power was worth the loss of his son and his best friend.  He and The Rabbi now share penthouse apartments, fortified with three inch bulletproof glass, across the street from each other in the City.  Every day they stare down the barrel of their mortality and wonder how they could have done it differently.First rate supporting performances by Bruce Willis, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman; gangsters with a gift for gab putting on their bad faces as Hartnett's flawed father figures.  Some of the flashiest two-fisted gun slinging by Willis since his work as the shooter in ""Last Man Standing.""  After his recent spotty record of pot-boiling lead roles, this clever and dynamic performance may be Hartnett's lucky number.  Writer Smilovic turns up the voltage.

(Also a couple of short nude scenes.)  The movie starts with a brutal killing with a big splatter of blood and guts on a car window.  The movie makes no sense at all in the first few minutes, but as it proceeds all the loose ends are eventually tied up and it all makes perfect sense by the end.  The ending (which I won't reveal) is somewhat a surprise, although you can kind of figure it out somewhat before it is fully revealed and perhaps early on.  I don't usually like this type of movie, but it was interesting enough to keep me watching to see how the hero was going to get out of the serious predicament that he was in.  The top cast keeps it interesting too, but probably not the best performances for any of them.

When I got HBO this year and it came on, I decided casually to record it, not expecting much because I didn't remember much about what the movie was about. I was really pleasantly surprised, and liked it so much that I rented it a few weeks later to watch with my girlfriend in this widescreen edition, and she loved it as well.I only give 5 stars to products that I love, and this is a movie that I love. I saw it twice in one month and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. At its heart, it's a mystery, which seems like a dwindling genre but this movie does it really well. The movie begins with Bruce Willis telling a flashback and then really begins with Josh Hartnett (Slevin) having bad luck (fired at work, girlfriend sleeping with another guy, getting robbed) and then being visited upon by mobsters working for Morgan Freeman claiming that he owes money because he's staying at a friend's place who's really the debtor. The story just unfolds from there as they try to figure out where his friend could be and how to pay back his debts to Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley.Let's start with the cast: awesome. I couldn't think of anything bad to say about anyone. I LOVED Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as opposing crime lords. You know that an actor is great when you've seen several of his movies before but when you're watching the movie at hand you forget about all those roles and can only think about how great they are in this one. I'm usually not a Lucy Liu fan, except for Kill Bill, but movies like this somehow really highlight her talents. She's the cute, hyperactive next door neighbor, and I believe her character throughout the movie. Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis are also great in their roles, but for me to explain what those roles are would spoil too much of the story.I think that the pacing is spot on, the writing is believable and witty, and the story really does keep you guessing until near the end, when you start putting together the dots. Unlike Veronica Mars episodes, you actually have a chance to figure out the mystery before the very end, but when you have this much fun watching it unfold, what's the point? I don't know how they do this, but the movie takes itself seriously and pokes fun at various elements of dark humor throughout the film, and it's part of what keeps the movie watchable in repeat viewings.I have a 1080p LCD TV with an upscaling DVD player, and the video quality was excellent. Nothing to complain about there, or about the audio. The commentary track is actually pretty fun to listen to, and there are a couple of good deleted scenes to boot. I don't know why so many critics didn't like it, but it sounds like they were trying to be snooty because it felt like it was trying to be like Pulp Fiction at times if you put on your movie geek cap.

At the same time there is another hitman wandering around (Bruce Willis), an undercover police officer (Stanley Tucci) and a girl that lives across the hall (Lucy Liu) to complicate things. Great cast. Not so great movie.This film has so many plot holes in it I couldn't really count them all. I can suspend my disbelief as much as the next guy, but there was just a lot of stuff in this movie that was rediculous. Why would bodyguards bust through the wall? Why don't they just walk in through the door like everyone else. How do you get the unconscious body of a mafia kingpin down from one highrise penthouse and up into another without anyone seeing? If a guy is pretending to be someone why would he tell someone he isn't? If you watch the whole movie you will see it is sort of a trick inside a trick. I don't want to give away the ending, but the whole thing it too contrived for my liking. If you go back and think about the entire film in light of the last 20 minute, you will see that there are just lots of problems that are never addressed. Other than that though, this was a fairly enjoyable film. There were some nice stylistic flourishes reminiscent of Guy Ritchie, and the few action scenes are well done for the most part.The wallpaper in the movie is amazing.

Lucky Number Slevin is a coy genius in hiding that very few people know about.  It's surprising with such large names like Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, and Ben Kingsley decorating the DVD cover.  Regardless, the movie is centered around a fiendish plot that becomes a twisting menagerie of hilarious situations and dramatic conclusions that will have you smiling.Slevin, our lovable protagonist, is played by Josh Hartnett and the setting is NYC, of course.  He gets caught up, unfortunately for him, in between the all out fedual war occurring between the top two crime bosses of the city.  He is forced to try and come up with vast amounts of money for each and he isn't even the right guy they are looking for.  To cheat death he must come up with a plan with his sudden sidekick and obvious love interest, played by Lucy Liu.  They found out that Slevin is also being stalked by an assassin to make matters far worse.  Despite the enormity of the situation, this movie teeters on the edge of ultimate hilarity while keeping its tone serious and dramatic.All in all the movie delivers a prized package of eclectic interests.

He's just lost his job and his apartment, and found his girlfriend in bed with another man all on the same day. To top it off, he gets mugged, has his nose broken and loses all his ID cards when he comes to New York City to stay with his high school friend Nick Fisher who fails to meet him at the airport, disappears in the thin air and leaves Slevin stuck in a mafia-war between two families respectively headed by the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, and he is the Rabbi and the gangster) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman as regal as usually. OT: just before we began watching ""Lucky Number Slevin"", we returned from ""Evan Almighty."" It was a double treat to see Morgan Freeman playing God and the mafia boss at the same day). A mysterious assassin Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) seems to have plans on how to use Slevin as a ""body"" (does not sound too promising for Slevin if you ask me) for his present job. A tough NYC cop (Stanley Tucci) does not want a wild card Slevin in his city. The last thing Slevin needs is a romance with the Nick's next door neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who happened to word as a coroner for NYCPD while he tries to turn the tables on the gangsters. Yes, of course, the movie brings to mind the classics like ""North By Northwest"" with the case of a mistaken identity, ""Pulp Fiction"" (with its style, coolness, and sharp dialogs, and with the small details like a family watch with a long history, and three stars of three Tarantino's movies), ""Usual Suspects"" (with the way the story has been presented), and ""Professional"" (well, sometimes the world class assassins have hearts and feelings that they are not supposed to have) but the movie is very entertaining - it is paced extremely well, the use of flash backs is most effective, and the actors, all of them bring style and grace to their roles. Just to see the only scene between Freeman and Sir Kingsley is worth the price of renting.

Reading some thoughts about how particularly disappointing this film  almost precludes watching it: happily a coincidence encouraged viewing such a film that for this viewer was fascinating and satisfying.The production crew of this thriller worked overtime to make a style: the film is filled with metaphorical circles in the wallpaper, the decor, the steps, the room designs - each pointing a sturdy finger to the story's meaning from the very beginning.  But along the way the writing and pacing of this high-octane film zoom past the eye with twists, turns, interlocked relationships, and character development that waits for the end for the payoff.  To say more would probably alter the good chase fun the movie provides in its ending.The film is one of the bloodiest and goriest of the season, but it all serves the purpose of exposing crime at its pinnacle. The good guys are difficult to separate from the bad guys in this case of mistaken identity that spurs mayhem.  But the cast is at all times stylishly active: Josh Harnett, Lucy Liu, Danny Aiello, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Chamberlin, Dorian Missick, Mykelti Williamson, and of course Bruce Willis.

He ends up ignoring those qualities that would differentiate him from his older sibling in his pursuit to follow the footsteps, which he fails miserably.Let's get it out of the way. This Josh Hartnett vehicle is a trying hard Tarantino/Nolan movie and it doesn't have the wit and craftiness of both. The dialogues are achingly corny and trite which reminds one of The Sphinx's lines in ""Mystery Men"". It's trying hard to be funny and tries to inject geek-cred by tossing in obscure references, in my mind, at inopportune times. It's as if the writer Jason Smilovic tries to put in all he knows or showing off his arcane knowledge of pop culture.Structure-wise, despite all the twists, it's all predictable. The opening sequence clearly telegraphs the denouement. After that, we have faux-comedic first half that's incongruous with the grim and dark resolution.The redeeming value in Lucky Number Slevin is the strong visual style in art direction and production design. That alone made me want to listen to the director's commentary. Interestingly he's candid about his work and its faults.

With great action scenes, high tension, an intricate and clever plot, great dialogue and a superb all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci, Lucky Number Slevin is a true pleasure, and for fans of directors Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, it's practically too good to miss.Therein lies the film's problem - it tries a bit too hard to imitate Tarantino and to a lesser extent Ritchie as well, and in the process it loses something of its own voice. It seems that McGuigan actively tried to create a cult film, and to a certain extent he gets the job done; Lucky Number Slevin has some very memorable characters and some highly quotable lines of dialogue. In the end, though, it's just not quite memorable enough to carry that weight. It's a very impressive directorial debut, no doubt, but it has neither the soul of Reservoir Dogs nor the energy of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. In trying too hard to be cool and sleek McGuigan forgot that he has a voice of his own, and the film lacks a bit in soul and feel.Still, it's lots of fun, and certainly stands on par with a lesser Tarantino work - True Romance (Tarantino's script) immediately comes to mind. Lucky Number Slevin doesn't have the spark, the inventiveness and the cultural awareness that make Tarantino great and unique, but it never gets dull, and never loses its perfect pace. The storyline may be far-fetched but it works, and the twist ending is both surprising and satisfying; and killer performances from three key figures - Willis, Freeman and Kingsley - make the fast, tongue-in-cheek, witty dialogue an extreme pleasure. Lucky Number Slevin is not to be taken all too seriously - it's basically a crime thriller, to be taken more or less at face value, and despite the constant Tarantino comparisons it has nothing of the cultural and artistic statement of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill.

Staples of the Tarantino film--the fractured storyline and focus on dialogue--here are grating and uninspired.What I could gather from the plot is Slevin (Josh Hartnett) gets picked up by some thugs and taken to a mob boss.  They claim his name is Nick, and he owes the outfit money over a gambling debt.  Slevin claims he is not Nick and has no idea what they are talking about, but that doesn't stop them from kidnapping him.  Once in the boss' headquarters, the boss offers a chance to settle the debt by killing a member of a rival family who lives in a ""tower"" he can view from his window.  Slevin quickly accepts this offer, without trying to prove his true identity.

643453,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JOX2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","I decided to see this film after reading a couple of very interesting reviews. They were hinting at something different and intriguing, but the reviewers appeared reluctant to admit they were bowled over by the film. I tend to be distrustful of reviewers who ""love"" a film since it usually reflects the movie might be a little too different and might just be trying to hard to do something new. ""Slevin"" doesn't try to reinvent the genre (whatever it might be in this case), but it does certainly present sharper portrayals of prototypes we have encountered before, and there is also much more care given to a storyline that could easily baffle audiences. Instead, here is a film that delivers, with a very satisfying payoff!! 2006 has definitely given us outstanding work by Bruce Willis, an actor that manages to prove he is very reliable, versatile, and quite talented in some very unorthodox vehicles (""Pulp Fiction"", ""16 Blocks""). He now embodies the epitome of cool, with a performance that shows he can put enough energy to keep this very unpredictable tale going.The movie is an ensemble piece, and Bruce stands out as one of the mysterious pieces in the movie. There is great work by both Freeman and Kingsley who are two of the most versatile and best actors of their generation. When they are in their separate scenes they dominate the screen, when they are both together, the results are explosive. Lucy Liu is sweet and quite effective as the romantic performer. Josh Harnett makes a bid again for stardom in a performance that shows the right script can do wonders for talent like his.Going through the elaborate screenplay requires multiple viewings, but watching it for the first time can be a very enjoyable ride. It is only fair to say that any of the classic Greek tragedies certainly provided inspiration for the multiple twists and clever plot lines that hold the story together. The screenplay is the work of writer who understands background and depth are necessary to create interesting characters.Be prepared to see the multiple sides of the underbelly of society, and how deceptive looks and appearances can be. Also some stereotypes will be shattered as the writer allows its audience to have fun along the way. ""The Usual Suspects"" was only the introduction to the wildest ride of the year.

643457,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JOX2,Joseph Haschka,"[57, 66]","Bodies accumulate quickly in LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN - at least eight in the first 15 minutes, not including the horse. Then, I lost count.As background to ""now"", the film flashes back a couple of decades to a fateful horse race. A young husband and father, privy to a tip about a horse doped for extra speed, takes out a foolishly big loan from a bookie and bets it all. His horse comes from behind, but then fails to finish in dramatic fashion. With no way for the loser to pay back the loan, the local Mob makes an example by brutally killing him, his wife, and his young son. Flash forward to ""now"".Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in New York to visit his friend Nick (Sam Jaeger). On his way to the latter's apartment, Slevin is mugged, his nose broken, and his wallet stolen. Arriving at Nick's place, Slevin finds it deserted and the door open, but decides to stay the night. The next day, Slevin is kidnapped, garbed only in a bath towel, from the apartment by two thugs and forced to meet with The Boss (Morgan Freeman) in his luxurious penthouse. The Boss believes Slevin to be Nick and claims the latter owes him $96K, but gives Slevin the option of eliminating the debt by killing the son of his archrival in crime, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), who lives in an identical penthouse immediately across the street. Unable to prove his real identity - remember the stolen wallet - Slevin has no choice but to agree to terms before returning to the apartment. Then, as if the day wasn't going bad enough, two of The Rabbi's goons kidnap Slevin and force him to meet with their employer, who, unaware of Slevin's shotgun arrangement with The Boss, claims that Nick owes him $32K. Both mobsters give Slevin three days to meet his obligation.Slevin's life is further complicated by Lindsey (Lucy Liu), Nick's perky across-the-hall neighbor and NYC medical examiner, hard-boiled plainclothes cop Brikowski (Stanley Tucci), who has both The Boss and The Rabbi under surveillance from a dilapidated van who and wonders how Slevin enters the equation, and Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), a mysterious paid assassin who's apparently working both sides of the street, so to speak.LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN is a fiendishly clever, albeit bloody, masterpiece of misdirection and long-delayed justice with a completely unexpected plot twist. This is perhaps the first film of 2006 that contains Oscar-worthy performances - Best Supporting Actor nominations for both Freeman and Kingsley.The film, at times a very dark comedy, is given its lighter (and romantic) moments by the Lindsey character, whose presence on the screen is marked by a soundtrack turned quirky and playful, and her interaction with the vulnerable Slevin. As a couple, the two are enormously appealing.Bruce Willis is in top form as the calm, dapper, efficient hit man working in the background to control the strings of his puppets, which apparently even include both The Boss and The Rabbi.The cinematography, enhanced by uncluttered, modern and/or otherwise visually engaging sets, e.g. the first visit to the airport waiting room, the penthouse occupied by The Boss, and the hallway outside Nick's apartment, is inspired. Even the wallpaper in Lindsey's bedroom is eye-catching.After a long work day followed by an evening meal, I'm likely to nod off even during a better-than-average film.

643459,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JOX2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","When ""Lucky Number Slevin"" came out in theatres, it got pretty bad reviews. While critics didn't like it, audiences have responded to it really well which prompted me to watch it. This is not a movie that you're going to hear mentioned at Oscar time, but it's a perfect example of Saturday night entertainment. First off, it's obvious what movies have inspired it...Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, etc. And it's not better than those movies by far, but it's extremely entertaining, has great actors in it, and has good dialogue. The latter which sometimes sounds like outtakes from Pulp Fiction. After a strange opening (which won't make sense until the end of the film), we meet Slevin (Josh Hartnett, 'The Black Dahlia'). Slevin is having a bad day. He got fired from his job, his apartment has been condemned, he's caught his girlfriend cheating on him, and a mugger has just broken his nose. Now, he's at the apartment of his friend Nick Fisher and Nick isn't there. After meeting Lindsey (Lucy Liu), a friend of Nick's, two gangsters show up and transport Slevin to a large building; Home to The Boss (Morgan Freeman), a mobster who's son has recently been gunned down. Turns out, Nick owes The Boss a lot of money and since Nick is nowhere to be found...Slevin is responsible for paying the debt. Problem is, he owes The Boss 96,000 dollars. Instead, The Boss offers him a deal. Murder a rival mob boss' son. Slevin goes back to Nick's apartment, but is picked up by two more gangsters and transported to the building across from The Boss'.Here is The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, great as always); The Boss' rival. Nick owes The Rabbi some money too and Slevin has 48 hours to deliver it. Add in a hitman named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who seems to be playing both sides of the table and you have ""Lucky Number Slevin."" One thing I'm surprised the film didn't get more notice for was it's complex, intriguing, and sensical ending. The ending is actually really unpredictable and makes sense. The film's biggest flaw comes from the fact that it drags slightly in the last 20 minutes. Not the ending, but the pace of the film just lessens. Anyway, while I'd recommend seeing Pulp Fiction or The Usual Suspects before this, this is a really good movie and proof that you shouldn't always listen to well-known film critics.GRADE: A",5,"Horrible Title, Great Movie",1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,2331,"['When', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', 'got', 'pretty', 'bad', 'reviews', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'audiences', 'have', 'responded', 'really', 'well', 'prompted', 'watch', 'not', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'hear', 'mentioned', 'Oscar', 'time', 'perfect', 'example', 'Saturday', 'night', 'entertainment', 'First', 'obvious', 'what', 'movies', 'have', 'inspired', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'etc', 'not', 'better', 'movies', 'far', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'great', 'actors', 'good', 'dialogue', 'latter', 'sometimes', 'like', 'outtakes', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'strange', 'opening', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'end', 'film', 'meet', 'Slevin', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', ""'The"", 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'Slevin', 'having', 'bad', 'day', 'got', 'fired', 'job', 'apartment', 'been', 'condemned', 'caught', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'mugger', 'just', 'broken', 'nose', 'Now', 'apartment', 'friend', 'Nick', 'Fisher', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'there', 'meeting', 'Lindsey', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'friend', 'Nick', 'two', 'gangsters', 'show', 'up', 'transport', 'Slevin', 'large', 'building', 'Home', 'Boss', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'mobster', 'who', 'son', 'recently', 'been', 'gunned', 'down', 'out', 'Nick', 'Boss', 'lot', 'money', 'Nick', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Slevin', 'responsible', 'paying', 'debt', 'Problem', 'Boss', '96,000', 'dollars', 'Instead', 'Boss', 'deal', 'Murder', 'rival', 'mob', 'boss', 'son', 'Slevin', 'back', 'Nick', 'apartment', 'picked', 'up', 'two', 'more', 'gangsters', 'transported', 'building', ""Boss'.Here"", 'Rabbi', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'great', 'always', 'Boss', 'rival', 'Nick', 'Rabbi', 'money', 'too', 'Slevin', '48', 'hours', 'deliver', 'Add', 'hitman', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Goodkat', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'be', 'playing', 'sides', 'table', 'have', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'One', 'thing', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'notice', 'was', 'complex', 'intriguing', 'sensical', 'ending', 'ending', 'actually', 'really', 'unpredictable', 'sense', 'film', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'fact', 'slightly', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'Not', 'ending', 'pace', 'film', 'just', 'lessens', 'Anyway', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'proof', 'should', ""n't"", 'always', 'listen', 'well-known', 'film', 'critics.GRADE']",Lucky Number Slevin
643460,A34792YZU3EH56,B00005JOX2,J. Swagman,"[3, 6]","a bit of Internet sleuthing reveals that this is a remake of the Kurosawa film ""Yojimbo"".This movie appears to have a lot going for it at first. A classic story borrowed from Kurosawa. An all star cast (Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis). A Guy Ritchie esque plot with confusing changing alliances in the gangster world. And Tarantino-esque dialogue.Unfortunately its a real stinker.Let's start with the dialogue. The film wants to pick up the torch of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Seinfeld"". At key dramatic points characters will stop to have mundane discussions or discuss semantics, etc.In addition to the fact that we've all seen this a million times before, the film's writers can't quite pull it off. The whole script just comes off sounding like someone who's trying way too hard to be funny. Most of the time I was watching this film I was cringing out of embarrassment for the writers. Part of the blame lies with the uninspiring delivery of the main actor Josh Hartnett, who's no Jerry Seinfeld. But most of the blame must go to the writer. All the rest of the actors sound just as corny when trying to mouth this dialogue.There are a few surprise plot twists in this film and a few characters who are not what they seem at first, but that is almost to be expected in these kind of films.The two rival gangsters in this film are Morgan Freeman as ""The Boss"" and Ben Kingsley as ""The Rabbi"". The Jewish mobster faction under ""The Rabbi"" are such a cliche collection of Jewish stereotypes as to further add to the embarrassment of this film. (Hasidic dress, a Rabbi who quotes scripture and talks about the Kosher ways to kill people, an alert button in the shape of a Star of David).Admittedly I'm being slightly hypocritical now in that I've forgiven other films for a lot worse when it comes to Jewish stereotypes. But in the past I generally thought that the films had a satiric point to make, or were being deliberately irrelevant of everything (South Park, Family Guy). I guess you could argue that this film as well was satire, but you can't tell me it is good satire. It's just plain dumb.",2,Interesting concept fails in execution,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,2134,"['bit', 'Internet', 'sleuthing', 'reveals', 'remake', 'Kurosawa', 'film', 'Yojimbo', '.This', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'first', 'A', 'classic', 'story', 'borrowed', 'Kurosawa', 'star', 'cast', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'esque', 'plot', 'confusing', 'changing', 'alliances', 'gangster', 'world', 'Tarantino-esque', 'dialogue.Unfortunately', 'real', 'stinker.Let', 'start', 'dialogue', 'film', 'pick', 'up', 'torch', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Seinfeld', 'key', 'dramatic', 'points', 'characters', 'will', 'stop', 'have', 'mundane', 'discussions', 'discuss', 'semantics', 'etc.In', 'addition', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'film', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'whole', 'script', 'just', 'off', 'sounding', 'someone', 'who', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'Most', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'cringing', 'embarrassment', 'writers', 'Part', 'blame', 'uninspiring', 'delivery', 'main', 'actor', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'most', 'blame', 'must', 'go', 'writer', 'rest', 'actors', 'sound', 'just', 'corny', 'when', 'trying', 'mouth', 'dialogue.There', 'are', 'few', 'surprise', 'plot', 'twists', 'film', 'few', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'first', 'almost', 'be', 'expected', 'kind', 'films.The', 'two', 'rival', 'gangsters', 'film', 'are', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Boss', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Rabbi', 'Jewish', 'mobster', 'faction', 'Rabbi', 'are', 'cliche', 'collection', 'Jewish', 'stereotypes', 'further', 'add', 'embarrassment', 'film', 'Hasidic', 'dress', 'Rabbi', 'who', 'scripture', 'talks', 'Kosher', 'ways', 'kill', 'people', 'alert', 'button', 'shape', 'Star', 'David', '.Admittedly', ""'m"", 'being', 'slightly', 'hypocritical', 'now', ""'ve"", 'forgiven', 'other', 'films', 'lot', 'worse', 'when', 'Jewish', 'stereotypes', 'past', 'generally', 'thought', 'films', 'had', 'satiric', 'point', 'make', 'were', 'being', 'deliberately', 'irrelevant', 'everything', 'South', 'Park', 'Family', 'Guy', 'guess', 'could', 'argue', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'satire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'good', 'satire', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb']",Lucky Number Slevin

643464,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B00005JOX2,- Kasia S.,"[92, 104]","I wasn't exactly sure about the whole idea and concept behind this movie as I walked into it tonight, since all it took was a fifteen second glimpse of a TV trailer and the ambiguous claim about a case of mistaken identity that uncoiled my interest into full blown curiosity.I was floored and blown away by the movie and at the same time really proud of trusting my gut feeling about good flicks. I was thrown off many times by the black humor since I knew it wasn't a comedy as Slevin (Josh Hartnett) had what seemed like a really unlucky chain of events that have spiraled him into a big, hot mess. As he arrives in New York to meet up with an old school friend after being fired from work, cheated on by his girlfriend back home and mugged down the block, all he finds is an empty apartment and no sign of Nick, his old friend.  He proceeds to shower and dress as unexpectedly the next door neighbor, Lucy Liu, drops by to borrow some sugar. They become quick friends with matching quirky personalities and from that point on things go from laughingly bad to worse.Slevin is mistaken for Nick, who apparently owes money to two rivaling mafia type bosses who hate each other and he gets pulled into their personal war. This movie was so full of twists and turns that I forgot to eat my snacks and almost left my purse at the theater at the end. I recommend not reading too much about it and skipping long trailers because this beauty can be given away on a silver platter and to miss that feeling in the theater of realizing the true story would be a sin. I was really impressed by the actors in this movie and I think Josh who looks like a teen-movie  type of an actor did a brilliant job! Bruce Willis is also quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, here as a slick top class assasin, I was impressed greatly!I enjoyed the twisted suspense, murder mystery comic relief type of a story so much that I was unable to concentrate on my book on the way home. I couldn't read or think, all I was consumed by was the story. This movies is an odd-ball, eccentric, quirky, unconventional and refreshing cinematographic achievement. The line between good and bad guy was blurred consitantly and the story dug deeper and deeper into my curious brain. I'm really glad I got to see it on the big screen.And last but not last let me tell you, the loud people in front of us who wear eatting and laughing quickly became mutes so sucked into the story that I forgot I was furious with them before. It kept everyone entertained and made them gasp at the right time and the hip music at the end really wrapped the whole thing together nicely.",5,So much more than you think it is,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2632,"['was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'whole', 'idea', 'concept', 'movie', 'walked', 'tonight', 'took', 'was', 'fifteen', 'second', 'glimpse', 'TV', 'trailer', 'ambiguous', 'claim', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'uncoiled', 'interest', 'full', 'blown', 'curiosity.I', 'was', 'floored', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'proud', 'trusting', 'gut', 'feeling', 'about', 'good', 'flicks', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'many', 'times', 'black', 'humor', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'Slevin', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'had', 'what', 'seemed', 'really', 'unlucky', 'chain', 'events', 'have', 'spiraled', 'big', 'hot', 'mess', 'New', 'York', 'meet', 'up', 'old', 'school', 'friend', 'being', 'fired', 'work', 'cheated', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'home', 'mugged', 'down', 'block', 'empty', 'apartment', 'sign', 'Nick', 'old', 'friend', 'shower', 'dress', 'unexpectedly', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'drops', 'borrow', 'sugar', 'become', 'quick', 'friends', 'matching', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'point', 'things', 'go', 'laughingly', 'bad', 'worse.Slevin', 'mistaken', 'Nick', 'who', 'apparently', 'money', 'two', 'rivaling', 'mafia', 'type', 'bosses', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'pulled', 'personal', 'war', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'twists', 'forgot', 'eat', 'snacks', 'almost', 'left', 'purse', 'theater', 'end', 'recommend', 'not', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'skipping', 'long', 'trailers', 'beauty', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'away', 'silver', 'platter', 'miss', 'feeling', 'theater', 'realizing', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'sin', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'actors', 'movie', 'think', 'Josh', 'who', 'teen-movie', 'type', 'actor', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'also', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'here', 'slick', 'top', 'class', 'assasin', 'was', 'impressed', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'twisted', 'suspense', 'murder', 'mystery', 'comic', 'relief', 'type', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'unable', 'concentrate', 'book', 'way', 'home', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'think', 'was', 'consumed', 'was', 'story', 'movies', 'odd-ball', 'eccentric', 'quirky', 'unconventional', 'refreshing', 'cinematographic', 'achievement', 'line', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'blurred', 'consitantly', 'story', 'dug', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'curious', 'brain', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'got', 'see', 'big', 'screen.And', 'last', 'not', 'last', 'let', 'tell', 'loud', 'people', 'front', 'who', 'wear', 'eatting', 'laughing', 'quickly', 'became', 'mutes', 'so', 'sucked', 'story', 'forgot', 'was', 'furious', 'kept', 'everyone', 'entertained', 'made', 'gasp', 'right', 'time', 'hip', 'music', 'end', 'really', 'wrapped', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'nicely']",Lucky Number Slevin
643465,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B00005JOX2,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[3, 3]","You know I gave no attention to the previews for this movie at all. I'm pretty sure that I just didn't take it seriously. The preview portrays it too much in a comedic genre. What it really is a smooth assassin film with some comedy. The film starts out in a terminal with a man just sitting and waiting until an old man in a wheelchair (Bruce Willis) appears out of nowhere. The old man looks harmless of course and starts telling the guy about the story of a Kansas City Shuffle.The story is based in 1979 and is about a fixed horse race and how everything goes wrong and people end up getting hurt. The purpose of the shuffle is actually to make someone look in another direction. What Willis does after he tells this Kansas City Shuffle tale well you'll have to watch and see. After this a man in present day named Sleven (Josh Hartnett) is introduced. He came to town to meet his friend but before he gets there some bad things happen to him. First he gets kicked out of his apartment, he catches his girlfriend cheating on him, and then he gets mugged.He didn't have a rough week he had a rough day and so much more is coming for him. After he arrives a cute but annoying neighbor (Lucy Liu) greets him. She just won't leave him alone or stop asking him questions. While sitting in his friend's apartment in a towel someone knocks on the door. It's two guys coming to get him and take him to The Boss (Morgan Freeman) who is well the boss of a mob. The Boss informs him that he can't find his friend and because of this he owes him money. After Slevin is dropped off not too much later two men knock to take him to The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley). The Rabbi is well a Rabbi who also happens to be a boss of a mob.What may be one of the longest synopsis ever or a least that I've ever had to write this film is definitely worth it. All that and that's only half of the movies story. So many things happen in this film that make it a bit predictable but exciting. The story was done nicely from the pace to the order of the events. It starts out sort of cool with Bruce Willis in the opening scene but then it goes into a bit of comedy. So already you don't really know what to expect from it. Then Lucy Liu is thrown into it and I'm thinking it might go more towards a comedy cause her character was wacky.I was surprised because the twists were woven in perfectly. Lucy didn't mess with it at all and Hartnett did a nice job. Bruce Willis made the film, well him, Morgan, and Ben. I love the back-story, which was very original. The action or gunplay was just enough to give the movie a bit of a grimy feeling to it. Though this movie is predictable or at least some people will get it quickly I like how it was done. It makes you believe one thing never totally letting go of its seriousness and then they go a little deeper. This had a great cast, it was well written, and I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to see a good film.",5,I Can't Think Of A Reason To Rate It Under 5 Stars,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,2941,"['know', 'gave', 'attention', 'previews', 'movie', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'preview', 'too', 'much', 'comedic', 'genre', 'What', 'really', 'smooth', 'assassin', 'film', 'comedy', 'film', 'out', 'terminal', 'man', 'just', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'old', 'man', 'wheelchair', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'nowhere', 'old', 'man', 'harmless', 'course', 'telling', 'guy', 'story', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Shuffle.The', 'story', 'based', '1979', 'fixed', 'horse', 'race', 'how', 'everything', 'wrong', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'hurt', 'purpose', 'shuffle', 'actually', 'make', 'someone', 'look', 'direction', 'What', 'Willis', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Shuffle', 'tale', 'well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'man', 'present', 'day', 'named', 'Sleven', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'introduced', 'came', 'town', 'meet', 'friend', 'there', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'First', 'kicked', 'apartment', 'girlfriend', 'cheating', 'then', 'mugged.He', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'rough', 'week', 'had', 'rough', 'day', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'coming', 'cute', 'annoying', 'neighbor', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'stop', 'asking', 'questions', 'sitting', 'friend', 'apartment', 'towel', 'someone', 'door', 'two', 'guys', 'coming', 'get', 'take', 'Boss', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'well', 'boss', 'mob', 'Boss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'friend', 'money', 'Slevin', 'dropped', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'later', 'two', 'men', 'knock', 'take', 'Rabbi', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Rabbi', 'well', 'Rabbi', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'boss', 'mob.What', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'longest', 'synopsis', 'ever', 'least', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'write', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'only', 'half', 'movies', 'story', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'make', 'bit', 'predictable', 'exciting', 'story', 'was', 'done', 'nicely', 'pace', 'order', 'events', 'out', 'sort', 'cool', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'opening', 'scene', 'then', 'bit', 'comedy', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Then', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'thrown', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'might', 'go', 'more', 'towards', 'comedy', 'cause', 'character', 'was', 'wacky.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'twists', 'were', 'woven', 'perfectly', 'Lucy', 'did', ""n't"", 'mess', 'Hartnett', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'made', 'film', 'well', 'Morgan', 'Ben', 'love', 'back-story', 'was', 'very', 'original', 'action', 'gunplay', 'was', 'just', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'bit', 'grimy', 'feeling', 'movie', 'predictable', 'least', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'quickly', 'like', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'believe', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'totally', 'letting', 'go', 'seriousness', 'then', 'go', 'little', 'deeper', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'see', 'good', 'film']",Lucky Number Slevin

When they ask him to commit a crime for a debt he doesn't owe, Slevin has no other option but to comply or lose his life.  I think you can guess which option he chooses.This film has an all star cast including Morgan Freeman as the Boss, Ben Kingsley as the Rabbi, Lucy Liu as the nosy neighbor of Slevin's friend, and Bruce Willis as a hitman with no remorse.  I've never really thought much of Josh Hartnett as an actor, but this film changed my mind.  I guess there's a lot more to him than 40 Days and 40 Nights.  His pairing with Bruce Willis, as in Sin City, was perfection and the two together are downright dangerous.

So, I borrowed the DVD from a friend and popped it in to watch.Eh...I thought it was ok.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie.  However, I thought it would be a better movie if the pace had been a bit faster.  You gotta be wide awake and full of energy to watch this movie.  Otherwise, you could be lulled to sleep.The movie opens up with a gambling bet/horse race gone wrong, which resulted in some deaths in the '70s.  Then, you're fast forward to modern day time.Slevin (Hartnett) is staying with a friend, Nick, in NYC.  He needs a place to escape after he's been fired and discovering his girlfriend cheating on him.  Not only that, he gets mugged when he arrives to NYC.The problem is that Nick has disappeared.  The Boss (Freeman) sends a couple of goons to get Nick to answer for his debt.  They bring back Slevin despite his announcements that he is not Nick.  The Boss says that he'll waive the $96K debt (Nick's) if he'll do a job...assassinating The Rabbi's gay son.No sooner when he's deliever back to Nick's apartment that The Rabbi's (Kingsley) goons pick him up to answer to a $33K debt.  It just goes on and on. Poor Slevin!Meanwhile, Lindsey (Liu) is Nick's neighbor.  She comes over to borrow a cup of sugar.  She's real chatty, witty and nosy as she gets herself involved with Slevin/Nick's debt problems.  Through the whole process, Slevin and Lindsey fall in love.Back to the story, Slevin has to finish the job for The Boss.  He stakes out a restaurant, while on a date with Lindsey, and spies The Rabbi's gay son.  When the Rabbi's son goes to the restroom, Slevin follows him in and sets up a date with him.  This is where things start to get interesting until the end.Goodkat (Willis) is an assassin.  Goodkat might puzzle you because he seems to be everywhere and makes you wonder if he's a double (triple?) agent.  You'll get your answer as the story progresses.Like I said...it was a good movie.

643470,ASSCA9IS0GWF5,B00005JOX2,Laszlo Matyas,"[3, 3]","Lucky Number Slevin is a stylish little brain bender of a movie. It's fun, smart, and slick, full of clever plot twists and funhouse mirror dynamics. The plot takes a well-known clich&eacute; (mistaken identity) and inverts it, turning audience expectations inside out with a few narrative flicks of the wrist.  It's a crime flick with a penchant for sharp, off kilter dialogue, stylistic left turns, and dark humor. The characters, despite their unsavory professions, are memorable and likeable. And since people's exact motivations are difficult to suss out (until the end, anyway), you never really know which ones are bad guys and which ones are good guys, so you get to root for `em all. The story sinks its hooks into the viewer from the credits sequence, tightening its grip with a beguiling (and heartbreaking) exposition, and refusing to let go until the very end.And then there's the cast: Morgan Freeman and (Sir) Ben Kingsley as two warring crime bosses, Bruce Willis as a wily, sinister, and charismatic assassin, Josh Hartnett (he's really good in this one) as the instantly endearing wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time protagonist, and Lucy Liu (she's awesome in this one) as his bubbly love interest. Now that, my friends, is a dream team! I won't go too far into each individual player's virtues, but suffice to say that each one is absolutely perfect for his or her respective role.Most telling is the fact that despite its ludicrously high body count (you'd have better odds of living through a James Bond movie climax as a jumpsuited henchman), Lucky Number Slevin is still a feel-good movie. You can't help but smile at its climactic scenes and wrenching twists. Even its stylish meta-cinematic references to classic mistaken identity and action films come off as smart and good-natured rather than snobby or pretentious.All of which to say, it'd be incredibly easy to compare Lucky Number Slevin to a Tarantino film.

643471,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOX2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a film that starts off making it clear that there is a con game going on and tries to lay out its cards on the tables in the opening scene.  This is a risky maneuver because while you will not be able to figure out ""what"" is going on by the explanation Bruce Willis' character gives of the precipitating event in the ""Kansas City Shuffle,"" you have a better than average chance of answering the ""who"" question.  Obviously the game has already begun by this point in the story, but this is our introduction and clearly we are going to have to play catch-up.  If you have figured out ""who"" in the first five minute, then waiting for the ""what"" to be explained might get to be a bit maddening.This film takes another risk in that the dialogue of Jason Smilovic's screenplay is trying to achieve a nuanced feel akin to crossing Damon Runyon with Quentin Tarantino, with the former being the dominant gene (actually Smilovic made his bones developing ""Karen Sisco"" for television, but the connection to Elmore Leonard strikes me as being rather tenuous).  You are either going to like this way of speaking or you are going to hate it (there might be a third option in that it simply does not work).  I rather liked it and was perfectly willing to go along with the approach, largely in part because most of the weighted dialogue is coming out of the mouth of Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kinglsey.  The play the Boss and the Rabbi respectively, a pair of major gangsters who live in penthouse apartments across the street from each other, unwilling to venture out into the world because the other one will whack them.  They remind me of an old ""MAD"" magazine bit that contrasted the polite and refined dialogue of villains with the harsh language and tone of heroes.  Freeman's Boss being polite has the ring of a death threat.Also mouthing such dialogue is Josh Hartnett's Slevin, but he is a kid so it comes across as him just being fresh, which is why he gets his nose broken so many times.  Slevin is in town and when a couple of thugs show up in Nick Fisher's apartment looking for Nick Fisher, they assume Slevin is Nick.  This is a bad turn of events for Slevin and things get even worse when another couple of thugs show up and make the same assumption.  At least the second time the poor guy is actually dressed.  Fortunately, Lindsey (a scene stealing performance by Lucy Liu), Nick's neighbor across the hall is able to do more than lend a willing ear, because she sees some method to all this madness even if Sleven does not.I went along for the ride here and the results were largely enjoyable.  There comes a point when the funny dialogue stops, but that is because there is no longer anything funny about the situation.  The sudden gravity could be too much for some viewers as well, but in the final screen and the final set of revelations the remaining characters remain true to themselves, which seems to surprise them more than it does us.  This 2006 film is directed by Paul McGuigan (""Wicker Park""), and if he is doing a 21st version of a Hitchcock film his directing style does not call attention to the fact.  He lets the actors do the heavy lifting, and with this particular cast that is a no-brainer.  All things considered, this one is going to be hit or miss big time with audiences.  Even if you decide to wait for it to come out on DVD, give this one a shot.",4,A  mistaken identity wrapped in a thriller inside a con game...,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,3405,"['Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'film', 'making', 'clear', 'con', 'game', 'going', 'tries', 'lay', 'out', 'cards', 'tables', 'opening', 'scene', 'risky', 'maneuver', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'explanation', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'precipitating', 'event', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Shuffle', 'have', 'better', 'average', 'chance', 'answering', 'who', 'question', 'Obviously', 'game', 'already', 'begun', 'point', 'story', 'introduction', 'clearly', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'play', 'catch-up', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'first', 'five', 'minute', 'then', 'waiting', 'what', 'be', 'explained', 'might', 'get', 'be', 'bit', 'maddening.This', 'film', 'risk', 'dialogue', 'Jason', 'Smilovic', 'screenplay', 'trying', 'achieve', 'nuanced', 'feel', 'akin', 'crossing', 'Damon', 'Runyon', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'former', 'being', 'dominant', 'gene', 'actually', 'Smilovic', 'made', 'bones', 'developing', 'Karen', 'Sisco', 'television', 'connection', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'strikes', 'being', 'rather', 'tenuous', 'are', 'either', 'going', 'like', 'way', 'speaking', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'might', 'be', 'third', 'option', 'simply', 'not', 'work', 'rather', 'liked', 'was', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'approach', 'largely', 'part', 'most', 'weighted', 'dialogue', 'coming', 'mouth', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kinglsey', 'play', 'Boss', 'Rabbi', 'respectively', 'pair', 'major', 'gangsters', 'who', 'live', 'penthouse', 'apartments', 'street', 'other', 'unwilling', 'venture', 'out', 'world', 'other', 'one', 'will', 'whack', 'remind', 'old', 'MAD', 'magazine', 'bit', 'contrasted', 'polite', 'refined', 'dialogue', 'villains', 'harsh', 'language', 'tone', 'heroes', 'Freeman', 'Boss', 'being', 'polite', 'ring', 'death', 'threat.Also', 'mouthing', 'such', 'dialogue', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Slevin', 'kid', 'just', 'being', 'fresh', 'why', 'nose', 'broken', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'Slevin', 'town', 'when', 'couple', 'thugs', 'show', 'up', 'Nick', 'Fisher', 'apartment', 'looking', 'Nick', 'Fisher', 'assume', 'Slevin', 'Nick', 'bad', 'turn', 'events', 'Slevin', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'couple', 'thugs', 'show', 'up', 'make', 'same', 'assumption', 'least', 'second', 'time', 'poor', 'guy', 'actually', 'dressed', 'Fortunately', 'Lindsey', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Nick', 'neighbor', 'hall', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'lend', 'willing', 'ear', 'method', 'madness', 'even', 'Sleven', 'not.I', 'went', 'ride', 'here', 'results', 'were', 'largely', 'enjoyable', 'point', 'when', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'stops', 'longer', 'anything', 'funny', 'situation', 'sudden', 'gravity', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'viewers', 'well', 'final', 'screen', 'final', 'set', 'revelations', 'remaining', 'characters', 'remain', 'true', 'surprise', 'more', '2006', 'film', 'directed', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'doing', '21st', 'version', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'directing', 'style', 'not', 'call', 'attention', 'fact', 'actors', 'do', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'particular', 'cast', 'no-brainer', 'things', 'considered', 'one', 'going', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'big', 'time', 'audiences', 'Even', 'decide', 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'give', 'one', 'shot']",Lucky Number Slevin
643472,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JOX2,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 4]","Director Paul McGuigan's films can sometimes be quite interesting.  In the medieval thriller ""The Reckoning,"" he follows a troupe of actors who solve a brutal mystery.  In ""Gangster No. 1,"" he follows a brutal crime rampage.  In ""Wicker Park,"" he had editing so complex that it was difficult to understand what was happening when or why we should care.  ""Lucky # Slevin"" wasn't as good as the first two nor as bad as WPark, so somewhere in the middle.  The film is shot well with an outstanding cast.  However, the screenplay comes across like a Perry Mason without the courtroom where it takes the last 15 minutes of the film to unravel the plot.Josh Hartnett has yet to be recognized for deep acting ability.  He's been described as having a combination of good looks & puppy dog eyes.  He was the star of McGuigan's ""Wicker Park""; so this is at least the second pairing of this star & director.  In ""The Black Dahlia,"" Hartnett came across a little more deeply; although in ""Sin City"" & ""Pearl Harbor,"" mostly he looks nice.  In this film, he's willing to parade around in a bath towel for what seemed like a half-hour.  His work is okay, but not exceptional.  He's like a male model in a movie.  As Slevin, he certainly masks any depth that is later revealed.  At best, this makes the ending come as a surprise; at worst, it makes the ending seem unbelievable.Lucy Liu broke through in Ally McBeal and has proceeded to make a name for herself in films with ""Domino,"" ""Payback,"" ""Charlie's Angels"" & ""Kill Bill.""  As Lindsay the coroner who lives across the hall, it's hard to judge whether she's just a simple neighbor wishing to help or somehow involved in a more complex plot.  Somehow, we expect her to be more complex than she winds up being, which is a bit of a letdown.  As a love interest, she & Hartnett seem like the odd couple.Mr. Die Hard Bruce Willis plays Mr. Goodkat, the assassin with a soft spot.  He's as nice of a guy as you could ever wish for to go around killing people.Two Oscar winners make up the supporting cast.  Morgan Freeman who brought home gold for ""Million Dollar Baby"" after three previous nominations (""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Street Smart"" & ""Driving Miss Daisy"") plays the Boss.  We think he's in charge, except for the flashback which clues us otherwise.  Ben Kingsley who won the Oscar for ""Ghandi"" (& also had 3 nominations for ""Bugsy,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" & ""House of Sand & Fog"") plays Schlomo who heads the rival crime syndicate.  After killing each other's kids, they meet their demise at the hand of mean puppy dog Hartnett.The film works as an interesting and complex plot that becomes clear only at the end.  The film doesn't work because Bruce Willis who can convincingly be mean is nice, while Hartnett who is nice plays mean.  Revenge occurs as Slevin falls in love.  Emotionally, this film doesn't hang together.  There is no apparent moral to the film other than revenge is okay if it's taken out against really bad badguys.  I bought the DVD without having seen the film before and liked watching some of the deleted scenes.  However, this one may be headed for a garage sale in the near future.

He did a great job for his part, but there were some things that were a bit unexplained in the movie. Weak points:1. What caused the schism between the two bosses? How did the timing work out so perfectly that the first boss knew that the second killed his son?2. It is very easy for Bruce Willis to look cool, but it seems like his walking into a parking garage and shooting someone while in motion in an elevator was a bit.....overdone.3. The treatment of how the failed bet (around which the whole movie was based) was a bit stretched. Were all that many steps really necessary to explain how the information traveled all the way to the person who made the bet?4. When Lucy Liu's character was ""killed"" at the end of the movie (and the shooting was later found to have not been done properly), can we really believe that a hitman would make a hit and then not make sure that his target was dead? Pushing the limits of believability.5. How was Bruce Willis' character someone who left New York for many years only to come right back and know all intimate details that would be needed for him to pull off the job in the way that it was pulled off?Strong points:1. It is nice how the whole movie came together in a sort of ""Aha!"" way at the end.2. The casting was excellent.

That's a lot of dead people. Now the thing is, it actually is pretty entertaining to see how the film plays out from point A to point B and beyond. The other thing is, style over substance. Is that the real thing here?Yeah, pretty much. We go from a guy being really unlucky--loses job, finds girlfriend in bed with another guy, etc.--to a complex revenge tale that does work, in fact, but there's so much emphasis on style (right, right, the Tarantino thing) that we kinda get hit over the head with it every step of the way.This is not a bad film--not by any means.

This thriller mystery has gives a fast and clever ride with visual treats popping up throughout.  The story starts in the 1970's showing a family man caught up in a fixed horse race.  He loses all he has to face a bookie debt of $22,000.  He is beaten up and killed by hit men while his son waits in the car for him to return from the race.Then we fast forward to the present time and a slender Sleven (Josh Hartnett) arrives at his friend Nick's apartment in New York.  Sleven has been mugged and his wallet stolen, and he enters Nick's unlocked apartment.  Nick has disappeared, so Sleven makes himself at home and takes a shower.  Soon a cute and perky neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) pops in to borrow a cup of sugar to find Sleven fresh out of the shower in a purple flower towel - the scene with the towel is way too long.  However, the dialogue is sweet, smart and sassy between the two and they ""click"".  Lindsey feels that something bad has happened to Nick and starts her own private investigation to find Nick while Sleven mulls what to do without his wallet.After Lindsey leaves for work, Sleven is kidnapped and taken to meet with one of Manhattan's two most feared crime bosses (Morgan Freeman).  The Boss thinks Sleven is Nick who owes him $96,000 and forces him to agree to kill the son of his main rival, the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) within three days.  This is because he believes the Rabbi has killed his son.  Sleven is wise-cracking throughout, which seemed odd, but the plot is complicated and surprising at several points.  After meeting with the Boss, Sleven is again kidnapped and meets with the Rabbi.  The Rabbi says Nick owes him $33,000 and in order to pay him off gets a murderous assignment.  Throughout we see the Police following Sleven and another strange assassin, ""GoodKat""  Bruce Willis, working with both underworld bossesDespite all the mob murder scenes, there is a springy charm throughout the movie, especially between Lindsey and Sleven.  Quick dialogue and creative camera work help the plots and twists which sometimes confound the viewer, but hang in there to get the satisfaction of the surprises.  A comic book dialogue between villains gives  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley a somewhat sly kick.  I enjoyed the scenes of crime bosses looking across at each other from the highest floors of adjacent skyscrapers.  Their self-enforced confinement of 20 years inside palatial offices emphasized the shackles of fear crime creates.Lucky Sleven was a nice surprise for an under-rated movie, a stylish, smart thriller.",4,"Smart, Stylish Thriller -",1269734400,"03 28, 2010",2010,2645,"['Lucky', 'Number', 'Sleven', 'story', 'names', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'fast', 'clever', 'ride', 'visual', 'treats', 'popping', 'up', 'story', '1970', 'showing', 'family', 'man', 'caught', 'up', 'fixed', 'horse', 'race', 'face', 'bookie', 'debt', '22,000', 'beaten', 'up', 'killed', 'hit', 'men', 'son', 'waits', 'car', 'return', 'race.Then', 'fast', 'forward', 'present', 'time', 'slender', 'Sleven', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'friend', 'Nick', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'Sleven', 'been', 'mugged', 'wallet', 'stolen', 'Nick', 'unlocked', 'apartment', 'Nick', 'disappeared', 'so', 'Sleven', 'home', 'shower', 'Soon', 'cute', 'perky', 'neighbor', 'Lindsey', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'borrow', 'cup', 'sugar', 'find', 'Sleven', 'fresh', 'shower', 'purple', 'flower', 'towel', 'scene', 'towel', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'However', 'dialogue', 'sweet', 'smart', 'sassy', 'two', 'click', 'Lindsey', 'feels', 'something', 'bad', 'happened', 'Nick', 'own', 'private', 'investigation', 'find', 'Nick', 'Sleven', 'what', 'do', 'wallet.After', 'Lindsey', 'work', 'Sleven', 'kidnapped', 'taken', 'meet', 'one', 'Manhattan', 'two', 'most', 'feared', 'crime', 'bosses', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Boss', 'thinks', 'Sleven', 'Nick', 'who', '96,000', 'forces', 'agree', 'kill', 'son', 'main', 'rival', 'Rabbi', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'three', 'days', 'Rabbi', 'killed', 'son', 'Sleven', 'wise-cracking', 'seemed', 'odd', 'plot', 'complicated', 'surprising', 'several', 'points', 'meeting', 'Boss', 'Sleven', 'again', 'kidnapped', 'meets', 'Rabbi', 'Rabbi', 'Nick', '33,000', 'order', 'pay', 'off', 'murderous', 'assignment', 'see', 'Police', 'following', 'Sleven', 'strange', 'assassin', 'GoodKat', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'working', 'underworld', 'bossesDespite', 'mob', 'murder', 'scenes', 'springy', 'charm', 'movie', 'especially', 'Lindsey', 'Sleven', 'Quick', 'dialogue', 'creative', 'camera', 'work', 'help', 'plots', 'twists', 'sometimes', 'confound', 'viewer', 'hang', 'there', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'surprises', 'comic', 'book', 'dialogue', 'villains', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'somewhat', 'sly', 'kick', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'crime', 'bosses', 'looking', 'other', 'highest', 'floors', 'adjacent', 'skyscrapers', 'self-enforced', 'confinement', '20', 'years', 'palatial', 'offices', 'emphasized', 'shackles', 'fear', 'crime', 'creates.Lucky', 'Sleven', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'under-rated', 'movie', 'stylish', 'smart', 'thriller']",Lucky Number Slevin

""Lucky number Slevin"" gives you a hint of that.

Those mob bosses, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman), decide to use Nick to kill each other. The problem is, Nick has disappeared, and The Rabbi and The Boss think that Slevin is Nick.

And there are really some nice surprises along the way.  Even when you see some of them coming, the writer and director manage to yank the carpet out from under you all the same.Bruce Willis, Josh Harnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, and Stanley Tucci deliver great scenes, coming off as chilling and quirky.Lucy Liu is a scene stealer in the early part of the movie, though.  She pops into the neighbor's apartment and bumps into Josh Harnett, who's dressed in a towel for about a third of the movie.  The dialogue exchange between them reminded me of the old THIN MAN movies starring William Powell and Myrna Loy.  It's rapid-fire and witty, so you have to be on your toes to catch it all.After a somber beginning about a chronic loser betting on a horse in a fixed race, the story picks up some twenty years later as two bookies are murdered.  Later, Slevin (Harnett) is mistaken for a man named Nick Fisher who owes the bookies money.  Unfortunately, now the bookies' bosses are trying to collect.In short order, Slevin is taken to The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and is told he can pay up the $96,000 he owes, or kill the son of a rival crime boss.  The rival crime boss is The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), who later has Slevin kidnapped and brought in.  Slevin is then told he has 48 hours to bring in the $33,000 he owes the Rabbi.Things start to get complicated from there.  Obviously the real Nick Fisher has disappeared.  Lucy Liu gets determined that they should investigate and find out what happened to him, which provides for some really fun scenes between her and Harnett.  Then the police get involved, watching Slevin and trying to find out who he is.Through it all, Bruce Willis walks quietly and calmly, a professional hitman who has his own agenda and is orchestrating everything.The directing, the looping of the scenes to play over things that weren't brought out earlier, the flashbacks to earlier events, all play out really well.  The movie also reminded me somewhat of Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION, which also played with time and sequencing of the stories.Although the end bogs a little as everything is explained, the trip leading up to it is great, and it was fun matching wits with the writer.

The Boss needs a favor, so he finds a lowlife who owes him money named Nick Fisher to perform a hit on The Rabbi's son in revenge.  However, Nick Fisher was murdered at a bus station by an assassin named GoodKat (Bruce Willis), so Nick's friend from out of town, Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett), is assumed to be Nick and is therefore given the option to either perform the hit or to be killed himself.  Soon after, The Rabbi kidnaps Slevin, thinking he's Nick, and requests that Nick (or rather Slevin) do a hit on The Boss for him.  All the while, Nick's neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) is trying to help him figure out why he's being confused for this guy and why everyone wants him to be their hitman... oh, and GoodKat is hanging around everywhere too, which makes it extra suspicious...When I first saw the movie, I was just like ""What... the... heck"" because of just how abstract everything is at first.

643486,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JOX2,Mike Zimmerman,"[0, 0]","Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) is having a bad day. Not only does he lose his girlfriend and job, but he's attacked by two guys (Mykelti Williamson and Dorian Missick), thinking that he's Nick Frasier, a man who owes a lot of money to the mob. Slevin then finds himself in the middle of a war between two mob bosses: The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi aka Schlomo (Ben Kinglsey), and makes the acquaintance of his next door neighbor Lindsay (Lucy Liu). With time running out and a complex plot to assassinate one of the city's most powerful crime bosses slowly coming into focus, the arrival of a notorious hit-man named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) forces Slevin to step up his desperate search and reclaim his identity before he's forced to pay a debt that could cost him his life.Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" was such a successful hit that the director's work has been copied in many films, both successful (""Go"") and not so successful (""3,000 Miles to Graceland""). For director Paul McGuigan (of ""Wicker Park"" infamy), it's his chance to gather a cast of A-listers led by pretty boy Josh Hartnett, and top it off with violence, Hitchkockian suspense, twists and turns, and a dose of black comedy. It's not science, but ""Lucky Number Slevin"" manages to be a humdinger of a film that allows Hartnett to actually act.The script is a little odd. It feels like an episode of ""Gilmore Girls"" where all the dialog is hip and witty. But once you get a grasp of the story, you'll feel right at home. As in a typical Tarantino film, characters make references to things like James Bond (especially how good he is in bed), the Alfred Hitchkock thriller ""North by Northwest"" (as mentioned by Bruce Willis in a solid monologue), and a bunch more. Believe me, it is very weird, but there are some good performances.On that note, star Josh Hartnett manages to pull in a very solid performance, even if the guys have to sit through a majority of the first act seeing him naked from the waste up. He makes Slevin a very good kind of guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, as he puts it. And acting with A-list talent like Willis (with a penchant for monologues), Freeman (pulling a Denzel Washington-esquire turn at playing a villain), and Kingsley (sounding a bit like Jackie Chan than a Jewish boss) isn't very easy, but Hartnett surprisingly gets the job done. Watch when he comes face to face against The Boss and The Rabbi in the conclusion.Also a pleasant surprise is Lucy Liu. Known for playing tough gals in movies like ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Kill Bill"", here she plays the quirky love interest of Hartnett's Slevin. Liu's character is funny, sexy, and sweet, the best that the Asian actress has offered so far. Like with the above actors, Hartnett manages to work well with her.Things kind of crash when the movie reaches its finale. McGuigan, for some reason, frenetically goes in-between different time periods, and throws in some unnecessary twists (i.e. dirty cops, hidden agendas, etc.) that sort of got beyond me. It's a shame, because the acting is so good, you wonder why the ending couldn't have matched up. But regardless, the movie is not as bad as we are led to believe. Sexy, funny in spots, and really exciting (you haven't lived until you seen Bruce Willis cap two guys busting through a wall), ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a killer follow-up to last holiday's other comedy thrillers, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" and ""Ice Harvest"".",4,"""I'm a world-class assassin...""",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,3454,"['Slevin', 'Kelevra', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'having', 'bad', 'day', 'Not', 'only', 'lose', 'girlfriend', 'job', 'attacked', 'two', 'guys', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'Dorian', 'Missick', 'thinking', 'Nick', 'Frasier', 'man', 'who', 'lot', 'money', 'mob', 'Slevin', 'then', 'middle', 'war', 'two', 'mob', 'bosses', 'Boss', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Rabbi', 'aka', 'Schlomo', 'Ben', 'Kinglsey', 'acquaintance', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Lindsay', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'complex', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'one', 'city', 'most', 'powerful', 'crime', 'bosses', 'slowly', 'coming', 'focus', 'arrival', 'notorious', 'hit-man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Goodkat', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Slevin', 'step', 'up', 'desperate', 'search', 'reclaim', 'identity', 'forced', 'pay', 'debt', 'could', 'cost', 'life.Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'was', 'successful', 'hit', 'director', 'work', 'been', 'copied', 'many', 'films', 'successful', 'Go', 'not', 'so', 'successful', '3,000', 'Miles', 'Graceland', 'director', 'Paul', 'McGuigan', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'infamy', 'chance', 'gather', 'cast', 'A-listers', 'led', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'top', 'off', 'violence', 'Hitchkockian', 'suspense', 'twists', 'turns', 'dose', 'black', 'comedy', 'not', 'science', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'be', 'humdinger', 'film', 'Hartnett', 'actually', 'act.The', 'script', 'little', 'odd', 'episode', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'where', 'dialog', 'hip', 'witty', 'once', 'get', 'grasp', 'story', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'typical', 'Tarantino', 'film', 'characters', 'make', 'references', 'things', 'James', 'Bond', 'especially', 'how', 'good', 'bed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchkock', 'thriller', 'North', 'Northwest', 'mentioned', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'solid', 'monologue', 'bunch', 'more', 'Believe', 'very', 'weird', 'are', 'good', 'performances.On', 'note', 'star', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'pull', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'even', 'guys', 'have', 'sit', 'majority', 'first', 'act', 'seeing', 'naked', 'waste', 'up', 'very', 'good', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'acting', 'A-list', 'talent', 'Willis', 'penchant', 'monologues', 'Freeman', 'pulling', 'Denzel', 'Washington-esquire', 'turn', 'playing', 'villain', 'Kingsley', 'sounding', 'bit', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Jewish', 'boss', ""n't"", 'very', 'easy', 'Hartnett', 'surprisingly', 'job', 'done', 'Watch', 'when', 'face', 'face', 'Boss', 'Rabbi', 'conclusion.Also', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Known', 'playing', 'tough', 'gals', 'movies', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'here', 'quirky', 'love', 'interest', 'Hartnett', 'Slevin', 'Liu', 'character', 'funny', 'sexy', 'sweet', 'best', 'Asian', 'actress', 'offered', 'so', 'far', 'above', 'actors', 'Hartnett', 'work', 'well', 'her.Things', 'kind', 'crash', 'when', 'movie', 'finale', 'McGuigan', 'reason', 'frenetically', 'in-between', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'unnecessary', 'twists', 'i.e', 'dirty', 'cops', 'hidden', 'agendas', 'etc', 'sort', 'got', 'shame', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'wonder', 'why', 'ending', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'matched', 'up', 'regardless', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Sexy', 'funny', 'spots', 'really', 'exciting', 'have', ""n't"", 'lived', 'seen', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'cap', 'two', 'guys', 'busting', 'wall', 'Lucky', 'Number', 'Slevin', 'killer', 'follow-up', 'last', 'holiday', 'other', 'comedy', 'thrillers', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'Ice', 'Harvest']",Lucky Number Slevin

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[0, 0]","If you ask me, the gangster genre has of late become one of the most consistently inventive and energetic film genres today.  The work of Guy Ritchie (most notably, _Snatch_) or even the plethora of Japanese yakuza films (by directors like Takashi Miike and Sabu) or one of the notable Mel Gibson movies of recent history (_Payback_) have shown that the realm of crime right now is some prime ground for quirky and interesting characters, inventive dialogue, and making movies that invent themselves along the way rather than tiresomely beat along typical paths.In many ways, this film starts out being very reminiscent of other high-energy gangster films like _Layer Cake_ or _Snatch_, and while being quite an entertaining movie for doing that alone, the story takes a turn into something more thoughtful and surprising with twists like _The Usual Suspects_.Of course, it's impossible not to make connections as well to _Sexy Beast_, since Ben Kingsley plays gang boss The Rabbi, but don't let all of these movie references make you think that this movie simply imitates successful ventures--_Lucky Number Slevin_ is an inventive film in its own right, while acknowledging that it is part of a genre that is really in a surge right now.  Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci are all wonderful here, and hell, I have to give a nod to Bruce Willis, though he is by no means the star of this cast.

Looking at the trailer, this movie seems like an action comedy, but there is nothing funny about it; and there is not really that much action either.  This movie is pure drama.Slevin is the name of a racehorse that was supposed to win a race after being doped up with steroids.  But the horse dies from overdose during the race and hence loses.  An ordinary man has bet a lot of money on the horse, and does not have enough to pay up.  Local gangsters send out assasins to kill him, his wife and his son.  The assassin sent to kill the son, played by Bruce Willis, spares the boy, takes pity on him and adopts him as his own.  The boy grows up to become a professional killer himself, takes on the name Slevin, and takes revenge on those who killed his parents.  In doing so, he destroys the top two criminal organizations in NYC along with a cop played by Stanley Tucci.The movie has numerous twists and turns and leaves you guessing until the very end.  Some might liken it to Pulp Fiction, but whereas Pulp Fiction is more an exploration of the criminal underworld, this movie focuses more on how one bad turn can lead to another.  The character development is quite good; Lucy Liu probably turns in her best performance in years.  Josh Hartnett shows he can play a serious role, and Bruce Willis continues his tradition of playing gun-toting bad guys with merciful streaks.  All in all a good movie to watch and enjoy.

643501,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B00005JOX2,Paulo Leite,"[4, 7]","Interesting film here...The trailer sells it as a comedy (a mix between slapstick and romantic and caper).But the film is something else. Slevin (Hartnett) is visiting a friend (who you'll never see) and gets mistaken for him. So he is dragged to the presence of a big mobster (Freeman) who forces him to become an assassin. The mission? To kill another mobster(Kingsley)'s son. But the other mobster also drags him to his office and forces him to collect some money... and all seem to be a big vengeance plot orchestrated by an international assasin called Mr. Goodkat (Willis) for something that happened 20 years ago (that we see as the film's prolog).Having briefly explained the plot in 25 words or less, let me say that this story gets more and more unbelievable and far fetched as it goes. This is one of those stories who would never work... and the screenplay is so formulaic that nothing that happens in the end is surprising.A formulaic screenplay? Yes, because as it goes, you see exactly which parts of the story are deliberately left missing in order to be explained later.

643503,AYWIO6OYAGFGQ,B00005JOX2,"pm444 ""pm444""","[3, 4]","This was not a film that I thought I'd like.  I had never even heard about it upon its release a couple of years ago, and I'd never talked with anyone who had seen it, let alone recommended it.  I ended up watching it while channel-surfing late one night, and was rapidly caught up in the story.First, the cast is as close to ""all-star"" as you can get for a movie like this, with Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, and Lucy Liu each contributing expert performances.  I liked that the story was filled with enough humor to offset the violence (which is necessary in a story like this).  I also like that it was fast-paced and kept me guessing (usually incorrectly).  At the end, my first thought was ""I've got to see this again"", and since it wasn't scheduled to appear on cable or on demand for at least a week, I ordered the DVD from Amazon.  It was a smart purchase and I've watched it several times since then.I won't repeat the basic plot elements here because they have been well documented by other reviewers, and I don't want to give anything away.  Instead, I'll talk about some of the things that have made this movie one that I now recommend to my friends any time we start talking about films.  As mentioned above, there's an outstanding cast turning in stellar performance and a smart, witty script, but this movie offers more.  The production is really beautiful, which is not something you normally associate with a film like this.  Each set and each scene is convincing and designed to reinforce the characters and the story line.  Whether it's the shabby apartment that Slevin's family lives in, the loft that his absent friend owns, the opulence of the two penthouses owned by the Boss and the Rabbi, there is a visual coherence that is compelling and impressive.  The soundtrack was also used effectively to underscore the story's development.All of these features combine to produce a movie that is extremely satisfying and only gets better with repeated viewings.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[6, 7]","Lucky Number Slevin is a satisfying revenge tale (reminded me of Sleepers a bit) that's told, through flashbacks, editing, and piece-meal revelations, in a way that keeps us guessing about what exactly is going on and who is in on what, until the twist at the end.  Bruce Willis is perfect as ""Mr. Goodkat,"" a world-class hitman who tells us the start of the story - about a family killing 20 years ago - but his own role in it isn't clear until the end, though he appears here and there.  The real protagonist seems to be Josh Hartnett.  He's mistaken for ""Nick"" and grabbed by thugs who bring him to ""The Boss,"" Morgan Freeman, who insists Nick owes him $96,000, and must kill someone to pay it off.  Before the day is out Hartnett falls in love with Nick's neighbor Lucy Liu and is again abducted by the Boss's rival, Sir Ben Kingsley.  There's a lot of humor in this middle part of the movie, but first and last thirds are intense and violent.  What's amazing is the way it all comes together to a satisfying conclusion that explains everything - which is really all in the story-telling, the way it's put together to let us know the right clues as the story unfolds.  The cast is terrific, with Robert Forster and others, besides those mentioned above. It's not appropriate for kids - too much sex, in addition to considerable violence - but otherwise outstanding.

In the apartment, he takes a shower and so on, and then after a quick run in with the grl next door, he is accosted by two black men who break his nose, drag him out into the cold of New York, and bring him to the Boss [Morgan Freeman], who tells him that he owes an amount of money somewhere in the upper 10,000s. Telling the Boss he doesnt have the money, the Boss gives him an altimatem, ""Kill my rival's son, and your dept will be nuillified."" and the movie basically takes off from there.With Bruce Willis as Mr. goodkat, he's one of the shadow assasins, unnamed, unmarked by the local friendly FBI, he's the best, and with him on both sides of the Boss, and Rabbi's table [the rival crime lord] only time and the price will tell just how this movie ends.With great performances by Ben Kingsly and Bruce Willis, and not to mention Morgan Freeman, it is a shock to know so few people have seen this film. Perhpas it's because the storyline has a few more than just a few loose threads throughout the movie, until the final 15 minutes of screen time, making it one of the more better endings for movies these days.The script was superb, the dialague was exelent, the storyline was delightful, but... there was just too much of it for a movie that didnt exacally have THAT complex of a plot in it. They over due it some, to add in a subplot and to draw the movie out a bit longer.All in all, this movie is a good rent, not exacally a good buy [unless you really like the rent enough to see it again, duh]. Bruce Willis sadly, does not apear alot in the film, but when he does, he goes out with a bam!I enjoyed this film, but I understand if some views notice that it is a bit... slow.I give it four stars for being of good quality and originality [unless there's a comic book or book out there i don't know about]... Wait, ill make that three stars for the plot[s] being a bit over done on dialague in some places. Sure it does have a simple plot, but they add so much, you might as well say there are two plots, running parelel to each other. If you watch the movie, you don't know that until the last 15 minutes or so. Until then, you're sitting in your seat saying, ""This was a waste of time.""

643512,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JOX2,Sebastian Fernandez,"[1, 1]","After hearing from friends and reading about this movie being associated with Tarantino's work, I promised to myself I would not go for that comparison in my review. Well...maybe promise is too strong a word. There is nothing I can do, because the film is exactly, and I mean exactly, the type of production you would associate with the creator ofPulp FictionandReservoir Dogs. And to tell you the truth, those two films are a very good benchmark, if you liked them, you will definitely enjoy this movie.There is one aspect of the film that is going to put some people off right away: the non-linear plot. If you enjoy a film in which the different scenes have a clear relationship to each other, you may want to skip this one. However, if you have a good time with movies that give you what seem like unrelated tidbits of action, until these are connected towards the end, it is time to check cell number 1. Cell number 2 relates to violence, and this film has a pretty good amount of the vicious type of it, accompanied by loud sound effects. In this sense, once again, think ""Pulp Fiction"" and if you are good with that experience, you get to check cell 2. Finally, we get to a more common ground among viewers; those that like surprising twists in the plot and unexpected connections among characters that make you go ""Aha!"", which I think is the majority of people, can check cell 3.After you get your three checks, add on top of that some really great performances by an all-star cast, and great music Tarantino-style (sigh, I did it again), and you have the full package.

643513,AJJ11F5MHN8K9,B00005JOX2,"sfarmer76 ""sfarmer76""","[1, 1]","Lucky Number Slevin -- starring Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett -- opened back in April 2006, and I tried reviewing it then, but I ended up scrapping the article repeatedly. It's not that I didn't enjoy the film; it's more like I was having a hard time containing my rampant enthusiasm. The film's principals and the supporting cast are pure fun.Ugly though it may seem, this crime caper revolves around a simple case of mistaken identity. Slevin Kelevra (Hartnett) blows into NYC to visit his friend Nick, but before he even finds his apartment he's mugged -- his wallet stolen. Unbeknownst to Slevin, Nick has simultaneously gone missing. This confusion becomes dangerous for Slevin when thugs come searching for Nick.Could Slevin's luck possibly get any better? While he's familiarizing himself with his friend's tackily wallpapered apartment, the cute neighbor girl comes knocking. Lindsey (Liu) is very concerned that she hasn't seen Nick for a couple days, but she's also curious about Slevin. The two share funny repartee over a cup of sugar, and consequently end up tumbling in bed together.Kingsley claims the bad guy role of The Rabbi in LNS. And Freeman's referred to as The Boss throughout the film. These criminal masterminds are longtime archrivals and former partners. Turns out Nick Fisher owes money to both of them, and they call in his markers. When two goons are dispatched to Fisher's apartment, they scoop up carefree Slevin instead.You have to appreciate the humor of the situation Slevin finds himself embroiled in; The Boss is perfectly content to forget about money due providing Slevin kills The Rabbi's son, The Rabbi on the other hand wants his cash! A proficient police detective (Tucci) is alerted to Slevin's predicament with the crime lords and starts trailing all three from the shadows.Now that I've piqued your interest, I've got to inform you that Mr. Goodkat (Willis) -- a hired assassin -- fills a semi-crucial role in moving the story along. Even though his appearances are brief here, Bruno is totally engaging when he's on the screen. Why would Willis take a non-meaty supporting role like this though? It's really beyond bewildering.Ultimately, the film succeeds because it delivers a fresh story despite myriad twists. Surprisingly, Hartnett carries the entire movie on his back. Hartnett's punched in the nose so many times here; you'd think this flick was written for Edward Norton Style does not triumph over substance. Slevin may be a schlub, but he's loveable. The Hartnett and Liu pairing was genius.MGM went out on a limb when they green lighted this quirky crime caper, but I'd venture they stand to benefit handsomely from their investment. It's my understanding that all the stars involved in this production were paid far less than usual. That suggests a modest budget -- meaning the film will probably turn a profit in the home DVD market.Besides the elevated wordplay utilized by the screenwriter, the film sets and stylish production design really stand out. Lucky Number Slevin is blessed with a distinctive look. Where did they find all the marvelously shabby wallpapers that crop up in Fisher's apartment and throughout the other buildings? Is the director employing the mod decor as a metaphor for appearance and disguise?Even though Paul McGuigan capably directed this ensemble thriller, much of the credit for the success of this movie falls upon screenwriter Jason Smilovic who came up with all the witty banter. LNS is funny when called for; also brutal, mysterious, and violent. And you'll remember a number of the verbal exchanges long after you leave the theater.Rather than carp about the film's pat ending, I'd merely advise you to enjoy the acting.

I watched a couple of clunkers prior to watching this really good movie.I'd not heard much about Lucky Number Slevin's plot other than what I read on the outside of the DVD case. And that little blurb on the DVD case really wasn't that compelling. That's good because, as it turns out, the movie really captures the viewer with a where-the-heck-is-this going plot.Lucky Number Slevin is full of action, comedy, high suspense and moves along at a pace that keeps you in your seat for the full run. It has tons of very good performances by very good actors and the dialogue is captivating.After showing up at his friend Nick's apartment, Slevin is mistaken for Nick and thrust into a war between two crime lords where he's asked to either kill or be killed. Not much choice for the desperate Slevin. And that's all I'd venture to offer for fear of spoiling this flick with some great surprises and twists.Be warned, indeed other reviews here and elsewhere mostly have unnecessary spoilers and that's a shame. It's also a shame that a movie as good as this didn't do as well in the box office simply because the producers needed to make the promos deliberately ambiguous so as not to reveal any of the twists and turns. Kudos to them, because this is a film that is much more fun to view without too much upfront plot knowledge.If a good, action-packed thriller is your cup of tea, then Lucky Number Slevin is right up your alley.

Bruce Willis is the worldly assassin playing both sides, and Lucy Liu actually pulls off something she has never before achieved, likeability!  Lucy Liu doesn't perform any martial arts, wear thigh-high leather boots, or wave any whips; instead she is utterly adorable as the coroner who lives across the hall.The cast runs deep, Danny Aiello as a bookie, and Stanley Tucci as a cop who crosses the line.

Almost everything, from the wallpaper and floor tiles, to chessboards, and especially the central characters, suggests duality, light and dark, good and evil. The film itself goes from clever comedy to brutal revenge tale in the space of a single scene.Cool visuals don't make a movie, but Slevin has plenty of cool in other places as well. Hartnett and Liu are charming and have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a long time. Freeman and Kingsley are fun to watch in roles they don't usually get to play, and Willis delivers his usual steely-faced assassin bit with just the right amount of humanity.DVD has no extra features - nada, zilch.

The movie also features cameo appearances by Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Danny Aiello (Do The Right Thing), and Robert Forster (Jackie Brown).The film focuses on a man named Slevin Kelevra, played by Hartnett, who is mistaken as a man named Nick Fisher by a pair of mob rivals, one a black man known as The Boss, played by Freeman, and the other a rabbi known as The Rabbi, played by Kingsley. The Boss's son had just been killed and he is sure that The Rabbi is behind it. So, The Boss assigns Nick, or Slevin, to kill The Rabbi's 'fairy' son to wipe off the debt of $96,000 that Nick owes him. The Rabbi, on the other hand, tells Slevin, or shall I say Nick again, that he owes him $33,000. The man working behind the scenes is a mysterious cold-blooded assassin known as Mr. Goodkat, played by Willis, who's planning a Kansas City Shuffle (you're not supposed to get that until you see the movie), while the private detective Brikowski, played by Tucci, is keeping an eye on that's happening and wondering who the heck Slevin really is.Without giving away the twist of events, the movie and its characters hold many secrets that eventually come to unfold at the end.I enjoyed Lucky Number Slevin a lot. The only flaw I'll point out to is the lack of background study on Bruce Willis's Mr. Goodkat character.

643523,A3JDK2RUAXXK3P,B00005JOX2,Steverino,"[1, 3]","Considering that people like Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) and Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) aren't making movies like this any more, I don't need to tell you how absolutely REFRESHING it is to see that SOMEONE STILL IS....  The incredibly stylized production (a la Scott's set design in Alien/Blade Runner) was in full force and effect here. The incredibly excellent PLOT (another element sorely missing from many of today's movies) plus an especially talented cast, turn this into an A-list piece of material. This movie forever proves my reason for condemnation of the absolute JUNK that's out there, plot-wise. Give excellent actors something to work with, and the result can be electrifying. Studios seem to think that paying the actor an ungodly sum of money will make the movie a blockbuster, but the best of actors can't do anything with EXCREMENT!!  They can only give you what's in the plot, and if it sucks, so will the movie. Sorry.. back to the movie...The words ""film noir"" come to mind. The anti-humor, black comedy stance only increases the level of glee as you watch the characters and the story unfold... but only a LITTLE BIT at a time. You've got to REALLY pay attention to what's going on to get it, and repeated viewings (as one reviewer mentioned) are essential. Add to that the excellent video quality on Blu-Ray and you've got quite a cinematic experience. Just a note, but Bruce Willis gets a lot of grief for not being ""that great"" of an actor. Trust me, movies like this were MADE for him. Once again, lousy material, lousy result. Look what he was able to do with ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and that wasn't even all THAT GREAT!

643527,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JOX2,Terry Mesnard,"[6, 7]","I didn't know what I was getting myself into when we went to see Lucky Number Sleven last night.  Having read some reviews that said it tried too hard, was too smart for its own good, etc, I just didn't know what to expect.  I didnt' know much, or anything really, of the plot.  I'm glad I didn't and I would recommend you don't either.The first thing that struck me while watching Sleven was that there were a number of deaths upfront that didn't make a lick of sense.  However, knowing this kind of film, I knew that eventually the webs would tighten to explain everything.  While some reviewers are correct in saying that Lucky Number Sleven ultimately is too smart for its own good, it is still a fun, dark and violent time.Sleven is sleekly and stylishly directed.  The cinematography uses tricks to give a quickly moving, sleek and interesting feel.  From the beginning montage, to the end, the cinematography is visually stimulating.  As is the sets.  The wallpaper in particular caught my eye.  A mixing of classical contemporary style (as seen in the Boss' penthouse) mixing with modern designs.  Visually pleasing to say the least but also helps set up characters.The casting is perfect.  In fact, this is one of the first times I've seen Lucy Liu in such an effervescent and bubbily role.  It was a breath of fresh air to see her playing a non-bitchy, fun-loving person.  Her banter with Josh Hartnett provides a ton of surreal humor and situations.  Bruce Willis was terrific as the mysterious Smith, Morgan Freeman playing against his usual good guy role was terrific as was Ben Kingsley--though that's no surprise.I don't want to talk about the plot because that's part of the fun in these films.  I will say it is basically about Sleven being in the wrong place at the wrong time, so to speak.  And he is mistaken for his friend who owes a lot of money.  From there the plot takes off and the pacing is pitch perfect.  It's kept alive by manic energy, absurd situations and hillarious banter between the characters.  I was smirking, smiling or laughing through most of the film, even when it takes a couple turns into some darker territory.A dark comedy, film-noir, Lucky Number Sleven was not at all what I expected.  It was a lot better, fun and insane.4 stars -- above the average, mostly because of the cast and the witty repartee that actually serves a point, but it tries too hard to be placed among the Usual Suspects and Mememtos of the world.

In ""Lucky Number Slevin"", two characters talk about Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"", indicating the great film is similar to the exploits of the ""real people"" we are watching. Really, the only similarity is the case of mistaken identity.That gripe aside, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is not a bad film, but it promises so much more.Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in Toronto... er, New York to visit his friend Nick. A few minutes after he arrives, he is mugged, losing his wallet. Nick is nowhere to be found, but Slevin makes himself at home in his apartment, taking a shower, shaving. Lindsey (Lucy Liu), the next door neighbor, bursts in, looking for Nick. They flirt, she leaves, she comes back in, they flirt some more. After she leaves, there is another knock on the door and the Boss' (Morgan Freeman) henchmen arrive to take Slevin to a meeting at the Boss' heavily guarded penthouse. The Boss wants Nick to pay back $96,000 he owes. He believes Slevin is Nick. Therefore, Slevin owes the Boss $96,000. Moments after returning to the apartment, another knock on the door. The Rabbi's (Ben Kinglsey) henchmen take Slevin to a meeting at the Rabbi's heavily guarded penthouse, directly across the street from the Boss'. Nick owes the Rabbi money as well. Lurking in the background, Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), a professional assassin, may play a role in the game we watch unfold.""Slevin"" has all of the characteristics of a memorable, amusing Noir-ish, wink-wink nudge-nudge game of cat and mouse. But it doesn't deliver on them.The reference to Toronto? This is yet another film set in New York, yet filmed in Canada.The cast is interesting but I don't get Josh Hartnett. He is easily one of the most boring actors working in Hollywood today. Why does he still get offered movie roles? He doesn't bring anything to the screen and frequently appears to be simply reading his lines from memory. Is it his looks? He isn't good looking enough to sustain his career as long as he has. But in this film, his lack of personality aids the character. We can wholeheartedly believe he would be mistaken for someone else because he has no personality of his own. But after this plot point comes and goes, we are then left with the actor's boring personality.Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley immediately lift the film with their portrayal of the warring gangsters. The characters are interesting and multi-dimensional. But these actors bring such gravitas to their roles the film is robbed of any humor it strives to obtain. There are hints at humor throughout, but they don't lead anywhere.  Imagine an Elmore Leonard novel turned into a film. That is what ""Slevin"" wants to be. The Boss and the Rabbi are clearly inspired by Leonard's works, but both are so serious, so intent on their journey, we never laugh at them. Remember Don Cheadle in ""Out of Sight""? That's what this film needs.Bruce Willis fares the best. As the assassin Mr. Goodkat, he is always calm and collected, adding the right level of danger throughout. He also keeps us guessing, as we aren't sure what role he plays in the game. Is he the mastermind or a pawn?Lucy Liu's Lindsey initially appears to be an annoying, precocious woman. Why is she taking such an interest in Slevin? She seems to be a tremendous flirt. And she is, but is there more to her character? In the first few moments of meeting her character, I wasn't sure I would be able to stand it. But as her relationship with Slevin continues, she takes more of a backseat. The end of the film provides an inexplicably sweet moment for their relationship.Writer Jason Smilovic and director Paul McGuigan (""Wicker Park"", ""Gangster #1"") have fashioned an intricate, involving game. After an extended prologue, told in flashback by one of the characters, the story takes off through many twists and turns. The film wants to be clever, and it is, to an extent. Unfortunately, the prologue gives away the one big twist revealed in the end of the film. The filmmakers seem to realize this because after this revelation, we see another, referencing back to the prologue. This secret is so deeply buried, like insurance to make sure everyone watching is at least a little surprised.The film also wants to be funny. And it isn't. As good as Freeman, Kingsley, and Willis are, they are playing it straight, trying to be a scary and menacing. Hartnett walks through much of the film with a bemused expression on his face. He doesn't seem to believe what is going on, or appear to be very threatened by it, despite being constantly punched in the face. Hartnett's Slevin is a character we should be laughing with. Yet, we don't. Nothing he experiences is funny and Hartnett isn't a good enough actor to create the laughs.The filmmaker's seem to have the most fun with the production design. From the prologue, set in the 70s, to the present day, many of the interiors are filled with intricate patterns. Wallpaper is filled with 70s-era design, the Boss' penthouse floor is covered with an intricate tile design reminiscent of the 80s. Both of these eras are represented throughout the film, causing the line between the eras to blur. It is an interesting look; effective in helping to make the con seem all the more unusual.All in all, if the film had played it straight, it would have been more successful. But because it announces that we should find some of the goings-on humorous, we are looking for the humor as well. When it doesn't happen, the film loses some of its flash.  ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is an adequate diversion, but it could've been so much more. Now you have to decide if you want to pay $7 or $10 for ""adequate"".",3,"Has The Joke, But No Punch Line",1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,5731,"['really', 'bugs', 'when', 'characters', 'film', 'make',

643530,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B00005JOX2,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[2, 2]","Following on from the good things already said by others:It's one of those flicks where nothing is as it seems, and I'm definitely going to give it a second viewing, because in the end I realized how everything was just so nicely wrapped up and the tangled web untangled itself in that second most pure of motivating emotions: REVENGE (the first one being 'Love' of course). You think 'The Bride' in Kill Bill is p-oed? Kiddo, you ain't seen nothing yet. Just about everybody in LNS dies by bullets, projected from silenced semi-automatics--not swords--but it works just as well. Lots of brains and gore spattering across the place, plus a neat twist at the end in a tale of a gazillion tangles and twists and quick non-linear time warps to explain what the hell was actually going on. And things just ain't what they seem. Nothing ever is.Revenge in LNS was not a dish eaten completely cold. In the final act, when the worst offender of them all gets his brains spattered across the inside of his car, the purity of the emotion and its raw darkness--and at the same time it's utter inevitability and sheer rightness--is beautifully portrayed by an actor, for whom I have acquired a new respect; for he evidences both, a subtle comic timing that needs to be seen to be believed, as well as a capacity to look like an almost-evil implacable dispenser of justice that had been far too long in coming.

There he meets some odd people who think he is Nick: one is a kooky and charming neighbor Lindsay (Lucy Liu) asking him for sugar and starts chatting with him; the other is two gangsters ordering him to come with them to a tightly-guarded room where their Boss (Morgan Freeman) lives a secluded life.But director Paul MaGuigan is not content with this premise which I find is already interesting enough to make a good crime thriller. The film actually begins with another set of stories apparently unrelated to each other, and the body counts rise very fast in the opening 15 minutes. That's even before you meet Josh Hartnett's character.In the second half of the story, the film ties up its loose ends, putting the pieces into the right places. I kept guessing the truths, but I was not impressed or thrilled with the outcome because each piece of the film presented in the opening is not emotionally involving, related in the flashbacks and fast-cut episodic scenes. Someone gets killed suddenly, then another someone, and then ... you will see the truths behind these apparently random killings, but you have to wait for more than one hour.`Lucky Number Slevin' has a potentially intriguing story with a great cast every producer would dream of, including Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci plus cameo of Danny Aiello and Robert Forster.

Hell, they even dig up Bruce Willis in this one(although he seems to play a previous character of his, just slightly less neurotic.)  Morgan Freeman plays a crime boss as well, while his casting was good as he's great for the dialogue, its hard to dislike Morgan Freeman's character in anything, or at least for me.  Lucy Liu does a wonderful spunky character  that comes off very naturally for her.  Josh Hartnett is the actor in the movie that doesn't quite do it for me, his ability to pull off witty dialogue and pop culture references just seems forced, and kind of rubbed me weird during most of the film.Plot line wise the movie starts decently, and keeps its secrets fairly well for awhile, before it just dumps it all far too quickly and kills any suspence, and a great deal of what makes the movie interesting.  After that it just seems all together far to predictable, which becomes the plague of what reedited and perhaps slightly rewritten would of been a far more interesting movie that we would be more likely to remember 5 years from now.My review does seem a bit harsh it retrospect, my point is, this isn't a bad movie, but it is most definitely a rent, and not a buy.",4,Almost..Just Almost..,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,1529,"['amazon', 'review', 'film', 'boring', 'describe', 'movie', 'tarantino-esque', 'film', 'shoe', 'nail', 'head', 'one', 'films', 'atomsphere', 'capture', 'action', 'wit', 'style', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'post-pulp', 'fiction', 'era', 'have', 'tried', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'also', 'failed', 'doing', 'Hell', 'even', 'dig', 'up', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'one', 'play', 'previous', 'character', 'just', 'slightly', 'less', 'neurotic', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'crime', 'boss', 'well', 'casting', 'was', 'good', 'great', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'dislike', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'anything', 'least', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'wonderful', 'spunky', 'character', 'off', 'very', 'naturally', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'actor', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'ability', 'pull', 'off', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'just', 'forced', 'kind', 'rubbed', 'weird', 'most', 'film.Plot', 'line', 'wise', 'movie', 'decently', 'secrets', 'fairly', 'well', 'awhile', 'just', 'dumps', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'suspence', 'great', 'deal', 'what', 'movie', 'interesting', 'just', 'together', 'far', 'predictable', 'plague', 'what', 'reedited', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'rewritten', 'would', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'remember', '5', 'years', 'now.My', 'review', 'seem', 'bit', 'harsh', 'retrospect', 'point', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'most', 'definitely', 'rent', 'not', 'buy']",Lucky Number Slevin

The problem in Lucky Number Slevin is EVERY CHARACTER TALKS LIKE THIS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE. Can you say, ""Movie written by ONE person who doesn't understand that individual characters are supposed to at least SOUND like they're different people in movie dialogue?!?"" Josh Hartnett talks like this...Morgan Freeman talks like this...Lucy Liu talks like this...Bruce Willis talks like this. In fact, you'll want to STUFF COTTON IN YOUR EARS after about the first 10 minutes of this agonizing dialogue. Uggghhh...Just BRUTAL!!Accompanying the abysmal dialogue are more SMIRKS than should be humanly possible by a cast this small. The actors must've had incentive clauses in their contracts that paid them BONUSES for each smirk. It's amazing that someone didn't sneak up behind one of these A-list actors and slap them on the back, causing a permanent smirk on their face. After all, there's an opportunity at least once every half-minute!STILL, the movie could've been somewhat salvaged with a decent plot. Instead, we get this: ""Guy makes a bad bet at the track and 20 years later a stink-storm is unleashed."" Now who among us even gives a crap about a story like that, please raise your hand. The plot also turns on itself in the last 20 minutes effectively nullifying almost everything you've been led to believe for the previous 1-1/2 hours! Is THAT all that's required to write a ""mystery"" or ""thriller"" screenplay nowadays?!? If so, then movie audiences have been dumbed-down beyond the point of redemption...The music score would be hilariously stupid if it didn't exceed that level straight into the realm of PAINFULLY stupid. Imagine listening to an endless loop of music from ""The Inspector"" in the old Pink Panther cartoons...That's what you get here. It's designed to make you think ""you'd better not blink an eye or you're going to miss something!"" Instead, I fell asleep at least 3 times trying to watch this 1 hr and 50 min excuse for a movie. I didn't even bother reversing the DVD after the first time when I realized I didn't miss anything except more painful dialogue, plot and The Inspector music...Oh, and at least a couple of dozen SMIRKS!It's simply AMAZING that a cast like this could be so wasted on an effort like Lucky Number Slevin...Of course Josh Hartnett's talent wasn't wasted since he frequently appeared to have tied one on the night before a shoot.
