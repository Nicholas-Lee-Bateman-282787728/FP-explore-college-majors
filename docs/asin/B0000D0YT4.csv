776686,A2UT4S2DJZDSR3,B0000D0YT4,"Benedict J. Likens ""Tullywho""","[49, 49]","I remember being about 7 years old and seeing Jim Croce on PBS' Soundstage show.  I was struck by his melodies even then.  The first rock album my mom bought for me (I guess I'll call it ""rock"" for convenience's sake) was the album You Don't Mess Around With Jim that, of course, included the title track which I loved and which initially turned me on to Croce in the first place.  But I loved all the songs.  Songs like ""A Long Time Ago,"" ""Box #10"" and ""Dreamin' Again"" from the Life and Times record got to me then and still get to me now.  Croce's stuff never, ever gets old.  To finally be able to see Croce and his guitarist, Maury Muelheisen, on this amazing DVD is more than a treat.  It's a poignant look at what was and perhaps what might have been.The defining moment of the DVD for me is during my favorite Croce song, ""The Hard Way Every Time.""  It's a song that, as things tragically developed, turned out to be the writer's own eulogy.  The song describes a life lived with plenty of failures and setbacks.  However, after the last few words of the song: ""And in looking back/At the faces I've been/I would sure be the first one to say/When I look at myself today/I wouldn't've done in any other way,"" someone in the audience starts to clap, but suddenly stops him/herself.  In that brief moment, something very subtle, but also very triumphant, happens.  It's difficult to explain, but confidently standing by and claiming one's life, and not discounting the tragedies that shaped one's character as much as if not more than the triumphs, is, to me, the very essence of being truly and honestly human.  Croce, amazing artist that he was, captured that idea in a few lines in a two-minute song, and someone in that audience of long ago 'got it.'  It's a beautiful moment that, for me, encapsulates this man's attitude and his short but wonderful and creative life.I wish that Croce's CD's would be released in their original studio song sequences and packaging (although the 50th Birthday Collection comes pretty close in terms of the sequencing), but as long as the man's music is available in some form or another, someone will be out there to discover it and marvel at the tunes and lyrics that Croce was able to write.  And now, we have this excellent visual document.  Well done and, Ingrid and A.J., if you discover any more, put it out!  You have one sure buyer in me.",5,My First Hero,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,2389,"['remember', 'being', '7', 'years', 'old', 'seeing', 'Jim', 'Croce', 'PBS', 'Soundstage', 'show', 'was', 'struck', 'melodies', 'even', 'then', 'first', 'rock', 'album', 'mom', 'bought', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'call', 'rock', 'convenience', 'sake', 'was', 'album', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Mess', 'Jim', 'course', 'included', 'title', 'track', 'loved', 'initially', 'turned', 'Croce', 'first', 'place', 'loved', 'songs', 'Songs', 'A', 'Long', 'Time', 'Ago', 'Box', '10', 'Dreamin', 'Again', 'Life', 'Times', 'record', 'got', 'then', 'still', 'get', 'now', 'Croce', 'stuff', 'never', 'ever', 'old', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Croce', 'guitarist', 'Maury', 'Muelheisen', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'more', 'treat', 'poignant', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'perhaps', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been.The', 'defining', 'moment', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'Croce', 'song', 'Hard', 'Way', 'Every', 'Time', 'song', 'things', 'tragically', 'developed', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'writer', 'own', 'eulogy', 'song', 'life', 'lived', 'plenty', 'failures', 'setbacks', 'However', 'last', 'few', 'words', 'song', 'looking', ""'ve"", 'been/I', 'would', 'sure', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'say/When', 'look', 'today/I', ""wouldn't"", ""'ve"", 'done', 'other', 'way', 'someone', 'audience', 'clap', 'suddenly', 'brief', 'moment', 'something', 'very', 'subtle', 'also', 'very', 'triumphant', 'difficult', 'explain', 'confidently', 'standing', 'claiming', 'one', 'life', 'not', 'discounting', 'tragedies', 'shaped', 'one', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'triumphs', 'very', 'essence', 'being', 'truly', 'honestly', 'human', 'Croce', 'amazing', 'artist', 'was', 'captured', 'idea', 'few', 'lines', 'two-minute', 'song', 'someone', 'audience', 'long', 'ago', ""'got"", 'beautiful', 'moment', 'man', 'attitude', 'short', 'wonderful', 'creative', 'life.I', 'wish', 'Croce', 'CD', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'original', 'studio', 'song', 'sequences', 'packaging', '50th', 'Birthday', 'Collection', 'pretty', 'close', 'terms', 'sequencing', 'as', 'long', 'man', 'music', 'available', 'form', 'someone', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'there', 'discover', 'marvel', 'tunes', 'lyrics', 'Croce', 'was', 'able', 'write', 'now', 'have', 'excellent', 'visual', 'document', 'Well', 'done', 'Ingrid', 'A.J.', 'discover', 'more', 'put', 'out', 'have', 'one', 'sure', 'buyer']",N/A
776687,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B0000D0YT4,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[8, 8]","In the 30+ years since Croce's tragically untimely death, just as he reached the peak of a popularity that seemed sure to last for decades, he and his accompanist were killed in a plane crash just as they were finishing up a grueling tour that seemed likely to be the last such time he'd be away from his family for such an extended period.  The tragedy to his fans and lovers of good music is one thing; the loss to his wife and son cannot be calculated.His recordings have been re-released several times in different formats, and are always a wonderful blend of folk, pop, rock, blues, and country, dished up with equal portions of humor, pathos, romance, wistfulness, and nostalgia, always told through a remarkably mature perspective for someone who died at age 30.  This former truck driver was a man's man, but his intellectual and emotional depth was rare, and it shines through in the many great tracks included here.  The sound is usually in mono, since these were early '70s TV broadcasts and no stereo recording was done for that format, but some interludes are in stereo as we see sweet moments of Jim and his family in photos and film.For a longtime fan like me, this is absolutely precious.  It's such a joy to see Jim in action after all the years of having to just recall seeing that famously character-filled face in motion, and all I remember is here:  The wonderful stories he'd tell about his songs, the crystal clarity of two acoustic guitars that were always meant to be together, and the robust voice of a man who could make you laugh one moment and cry the next with his story songs and sheer raw emotion of love lost or never fully achieved.This is a treasure.

He was only 30 years old.In this television-for-BBC concert, released on DVD about five years ago, Jim performs many of his great songs. In addition to footage of this made-for-TV concert, we also see him performing in other televised appearances, mostly, I think, from the U.S.A. Wherever the setting, this disc gives you a very nice, intimate look at this talented man. It's hard to believe these were done over 30 years ago, and that he's been gone that long.What you get is mainly a pleasant, small atmosphere with the artist and another guitarist singing a bunch of Croce's songs and Jim casually discussing some things about his career. He has a pleasing way of telling stories and had a very popular way of singing very interesting and sometimes very humorous songs. Those songs sound just as good today as they did 35 years ago.For a sincere, loving tribute to a wonderful artist and just plain nice guy, this is highly recommended.",5,"Great Songs, And A Nice Tribute To Jim Croce",1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,1084,"['Jim', 'Croce', 'singer', 'early', '1970s', 'had', 'bunch', 'hit', 'songs', 'eight', 'short', 'span', 'two', 'years', 'then', 'died', 'tragically', 'accident', 'was', 'only', '30', 'years', 'old.In', 'television-for-BBC', 'concert', 'released', 'DVD', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Jim', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'addition', 'footage', 'made-for-TV', 'concert', 'also', 'see', 'performing', 'other', 'televised', 'appearances', 'mostly', 'think', 'U.S.A', 'setting', 'disc', 'very', 'nice', 'intimate', 'look', 'talented', 'man', 'hard', 'believe', 'were', 'done', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'been', 'gone', 'long.What', 'get', 'mainly', 'pleasant', 'small', 'atmosphere', 'artist', 'guitarist', 'singing', 'bunch', 'Croce', 'songs', 'Jim', 'casually', 'discussing', 'things', 'career', 'pleasing', 'way', 'telling', 'stories', 'had', 'very', 'popular', 'way', 'singing', 'very', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'very', 'humorous', 'songs', 'songs', 'sound', 'just', 'good', 'today', 'did', '35', 'years', 'ago.For', 'sincere', 'loving', 'tribute', 'wonderful', 'artist', 'just', 'plain', 'nice', 'guy', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
776691,AQSNJ8HQ3WHMS,B0000D0YT4,cyclista,"[83, 83]","Having purchased some really bad concert DVD's, I was not sure what to expect  here.  While you can definitely tell that this is old video, I was surprised and excited by the audio and video quality.  Jim Croce brings a depth of emotion and warmth to his performances.Three songs are  not played live in concert, but show photographs and video footage of Jim with his family.  This is deeply moving.  The live recordings are not of one concert, but a variety of formats.  Although it  was obvious that some of these recordings were for TV, these recordings brought back  memories of the coffeehouse era.  Just two guys with guitars singing into microphones.  Jim Croce talks before some of the songs.  There is  nothing to interfere with the enjoyment of the music.  This DVD creates the experience of actually being there.  There is direct access to every song. The 16 songs are 52 minutes long.  The bonus features are 21 minutes long.Ingrid gives a 52 minute commentary.  She describes how  she and Jim Croce met and how she fell in love with him.  She talks about Jim's life and career.  She tearfully describes their last conversation and reminds us that Jim Croce was not the only one to die in the plane crash, that guitarist Maury Muehleisen died with him.  (Road manager Dennis Rast, booking agent Ken  Cortese, comedian George Stevens, and pilot Robert Elliott were  killed in this crash.)  The 21 minute commentary by A.J. Croce discusses getting to know his father as a person through Jim's music and interviews of those who knew Jim.  He talks about the bonus features included in the DVD.Seeing Jim Croce brought back the profound sense of loss of this wonderful  man and tremendous talent.  This over 2 hour DVD is an intensely personal and intimate picture of Jim Croce the man, husband, father, and friend, and Jim Croce the musician.

When I heard the news of his death I was devestated.  I was like Don McLean in American Pie when he talked about the day the music died, referring to Buddy Holly's plane crash.  I had all of Jim's albums, including the one with Ingrid.  I knew all of his songs.  I made it a point to watch every time he was on TV (Midnight Special, Tonight Show, Helen Reddy Show, In Concert ... )  After he died I discovered that he had performed 100 miles away from where I lived the night before the crash.  I've been kicking myself ever since because I never got to see him perform live.  Now 30 years later, thanks to Ingrid and A.J., I am able to watch Jim and Maury perform some of their hits in remarkably high quality video on this new DVD.  In addition I have learned much about Jim's background from the interviews with Ingrid, Randy Matthews, Loggins &amp; Messina, and A.J.  For example, I never knew that Jim and Cheech Marin were planning on making a movie together.  That would have been great.The audio and video are surprisingly good considering that they are from the early 70s.  Numerous photos and home movie clips are worked into the video with voiceovers by Ingrid and A.J. to add context.  One track that I really enjoyed presented Jim (sans mustache) and Ingrid doing one of their songs (Spin, Spin, Spin) in a TV taping from the late 60s.  A.J. tends to ramble a bit in his narration over the special feature videos.  Also, I would have enjoyed seeing a short segment with Ingrid and A.J. as they look today.  You never see their faces on the DVD.Being a big Croce fan, there are things I remember that weren't included in this DVD.  Cashman &amp; West (Jim's college friends who helped him get his recording deal with ABC) did an interview after Jim died where they recalled their days with him.  Jim was turned down by numerous labels because he sounded too much like James Taylor (another great example of how the recording industry is full of morons).  Then there was the intro (I think it was on the Midnight Special) where Jim introduced Speedball Tucker by telling a story of pulling his rig into a truck stop and trying to look cool by leaning up against it after he got out, only to burn his hand on the white hot chrome muffler.  These would have been great additions.  Maybe in a future version some of these additions can be included.  In the meantime I can't imagine any true Jim Croce fan passing this one up.",4,A Nice Tribute,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,2572,"['Jim', 'Croce', 'was', 'idol', 'learned', 'fingerstyle', 'guitar', 'listening', 'album', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Mess', 'Jim', 'quot', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'heard', 'news', 'death', 'was', 'devestated', 'was', 'Don', 'McLean', 'American', 'Pie', 'when', 'talked', 'day', 'music', 'died', 'referring', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'plane', 'crash', 'had', 'Jim', 'albums', 'including', 'one', 'Ingrid', 'knew', 'songs', 'made', 'point', 'watch', 'time', 'was', 'TV', 'Midnight', 'Special', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Helen', 'Reddy', 'Show', 'Concert', 'died', 'discovered', 'had', 'performed', '100', 'miles', 'away', 'where', 'lived', 'night', 'crash', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kicking', 'ever', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'perform', 'live', 'Now', '30', 'years', 'later', 'thanks', 'Ingrid', 'A.J.', 'am', 'able', 'watch', 'Jim', 'Maury', 'perform', 'hits', 'remarkably', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'new', 'DVD', 'addition', 'have', 'learned', 'much', 'Jim', 'background', 'interviews', 'Ingrid', 'Randy', 'Matthews', 'Loggins', 'amp', 'Messina', 'A.J', 'example', 'never', 'knew', 'Jim', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'were', 'planning', 'making', 'movie', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great.The', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'considering', 'are', 'early', '70s', 'Numerous', 'photos', 'home', 'movie', 'clips', 'are', 'worked', 'video', 'voiceovers', 'Ingrid', 'A.J', 'add', 'context', 'One', 'track', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'presented', 'Jim', 'sans', 'mustache', 'Ingrid', 'doing', 'one', 'songs', 'Spin', 'Spin', 'Spin', 'TV', 'taping', 'late', '60s', 'A.J', 'ramble', 'bit', 'narration', 'special', 'feature', 'videos', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'short', 'segment', 'Ingrid', 'A.J', 'look', 'today', 'never', 'see', 'DVD.Being', 'big', 'Croce', 'fan', 'are', 'things', 'remember', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'DVD', 'Cashman', 'amp', 'West', 'Jim', 'college', 'friends', 'who', 'helped', 'get', 'recording', 'deal', 'ABC', 'did', 'interview', 'Jim', 'died', 'where', 'recalled', 'days', 'Jim', 'was', 'turned', 'down', 'numerous', 'labels', 'sounded', 'too', 'much', 'James', 'Taylor', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'recording', 'industry', 'full', 'morons', 'Then', 'was', 'intro', 'think', 'was', 'Midnight', 'Special', 'where', 'Jim', 'introduced', 'Speedball', 'Tucker', 'telling', 'story', 'pulling', 'rig', 'truck', 'stop', 'trying', 'look', 'cool', 'leaning', 'up', 'got', 'out', 'only', 'burn', 'hand', 'white', 'hot', 'chrome', 'muffler', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'additions', 'Maybe', 'future', 'version', 'additions', 'can', 'be', 'included', 'meantime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'true', 'Jim', 'Croce', 'fan', 'passing', 'one', 'up']",N/A

I love his music and when I saw this DVD collection I had to get it. Jim Croce was a true genuine authentic person and artist. It comes through in his music &amp; the film footage on this DVD. The footage is very good quality to be from the 70's, this is the only surviving film of him preforming live. I also enjoyed the audio interviews with Jim's wife and son A.J.. It was so touching and personal. It brought tears to my eyes that such a beautiful person as Jim was taken so soon.
