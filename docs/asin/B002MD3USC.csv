The actors all play very quirky characters, including Robert Pattinson's character,Art, a very awkward, confused college graduate who works in a grocery and tries to get gigs playing and singing (he really knows how to play the guitar and sings so well it breaks my heart) but in the movie he has to try to be not very good, and thats pretty hard to do if you're really well versed at something. If you find it difficult to understand the ""Queen's English"", just watch it several times like I did.  Of course Robert Pattinson is so good at playing this character ""Art"", and he interacts with his family and friends in this ""no one understands me"" way, that you have to adore his attempts.

If it had starred any other actor, I think this would have been a bottom bin flick hardly ever watched, but because of Pattinson, it is finding somewhat of a cult following.  I didn't find it *hilarious* and only grinned at a few scenes - maybe I missed alot of the dry wry humor - but I did go away feeling weirdly at peace by the end of it.It is slow paced and deals with human relations and social ineptitude, and somehow managed to be endearing despite its flaws.
