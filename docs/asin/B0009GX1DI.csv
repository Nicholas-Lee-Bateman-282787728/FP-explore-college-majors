905249,A39FJV2G99WGQI,B0009GX1DI,Anibeth,"[5, 6]","Since the tragedy which happened on April 20, 1999, this film centers on Dawn Anna's personal struggle with brain cancer and then, the tragic death of her daughter from the Columbine  High School massacre. Taking place in Littleton, Colorado,  the film revolves around a tender relationship between mother and daughter. Then fate took over and changed everything. Fortunately the intense shootout was omitted due its incredible violence.  Beautifully acted by Debra Winger who mirrored Dawn Anna's incredible courage and then, facing the pain in the loss of her beloved daughter. Incredible acting resembling real-life events at and around Columbine is noted. Due to the disturbing contents of the film, it is not recommended for children under the age of 17. Other than that, It is a film well worth seeing; though you may need a box of kleenex handy.",5,"A gripping, documentary about a mom and her daughter",1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,852,"['tragedy', 'happened', 'April', '20', '1999', 'film', 'centers', 'Dawn', 'Anna', 'personal', 'struggle', 'brain', 'cancer', 'then', 'tragic', 'death', 'daughter', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'massacre', 'Taking', 'place', 'Littleton', 'Colorado', 'film', 'around', 'tender', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Then', 'fate', 'took', 'over', 'changed', 'everything', 'Fortunately', 'intense', 'shootout', 'was', 'omitted', 'due', 'incredible', 'violence', 'Beautifully', 'acted', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'who', 'mirrored', 'Dawn', 'Anna', 'incredible', 'courage', 'then', 'facing', 'pain', 'loss', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'Incredible', 'acting', 'resembling', 'real-life', 'events', 'Columbine', 'noted', 'Due', 'disturbing', 'contents', 'film', 'not', 'recommended', 'children', 'age', '17', 'Other', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'may', 'need', 'box', 'kleenex', 'handy']",Dawn Anna

The family over came a mother's illness to postively making sense of a sensless High School shooting.  You could feel the pain that they went through.  2 parents raising Children in this day and time is not easy! But it is even harder for a ""SINGLE PARENT"".  She showed that with love disclipline and determination that it can be done.  True stories are so much better than fiction.  If you have not watched this watch it with your children, Youth groups etc.  Talk to your children, Notice your children, take interest so we can stop the jonesboro and other High School and senless killings among teens.  Prayer, Love and disclipline is the key..... Wonderful movie.  I hope that a documentary or movie will be done soon to let us know how all the victims and surviors and their families are doing.",5,The Calm after the storm,1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,888,"['Dawn', 'Anna', 'was', 'tear', 'Jerker', 'brought', 'lot', 'things', 'perspective', 'parent', 'family', 'came', 'mother', 'illness', 'postively', 'making', 'sense', 'sensless', 'High', 'School', 'shooting', 'could', 'feel', 'pain', 'went', '2', 'parents', 'raising', 'Children', 'day', 'time', 'not', 'easy', 'even', 'harder', 'SINGLE', 'PARENT', 'showed', 'love', 'disclipline', 'determination', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'True', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'fiction', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'watch', 'children', 'Youth', 'groups', 'etc', 'Talk', 'children', 'Notice', 'children', 'take', 'interest', 'can', 'stop', 'jonesboro', 'other', 'High', 'School', 'senless', 'killings', 'teens', 'Prayer', 'Love', 'disclipline', 'key', '..', 'Wonderful', 'movie', 'hope', 'documentary', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'soon', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'victims', 'surviors', 'families', 'are', 'doing']",Dawn Anna

905253,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B0009GX1DI,Reviews No More,"[2, 3]","As well as Human Trafficking, Dawn Anna is a very well-done Lifetime movie, and its emotional gamut is both wide and varied.  From the beginning of this story, I was impressed to watch a strong, single mother of four manage to raise truly good and cooperative children while getting by with very little money as a school teacher.  Loved by both her own kids and students alike, this really is a case of bad things happening to good people.The brain tumor seems so incredibly unfair, but I think that both the network of support and her own resiliency to recover paved the way for her to cope with the upcoming tragedy of losing her youngest daughter Lauren, a sweet, bright, and talented girl during the massacre of Columbine High back in 1999.Dawn Anna and her kids are likable and admirable, proving that you don't have to be financially endowed to be rich.  Bravo, Lifetime, and it would be fantastic if you would give us more movies of this quality!",5,The Brightest Among Lifetime's Rare Movie Gems.,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,953,"['As', 'well', 'Human', 'Trafficking', 'Dawn', 'Anna', 'very', 'well-done', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'emotional', 'gamut', 'wide', 'varied', 'beginning', 'story', 'was', 'impressed', 'watch', 'strong', 'single', 'mother', 'four', 'manage', 'raise', 'truly', 'good', 'cooperative', 'children', 'getting', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'school', 'teacher', 'Loved', 'own', 'kids', 'students', 'alike', 'really', 'case', 'bad', 'things', 'happening', 'good', 'people.The', 'brain', 'tumor', 'so', 'incredibly', 'unfair', 'think', 'network', 'support', 'own', 'resiliency', 'recover', 'paved', 'way', 'cope', 'upcoming', 'tragedy', 'losing', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Lauren', 'sweet', 'bright', 'talented', 'girl', 'massacre', 'Columbine', 'High', 'back', '1999.Dawn', 'Anna', 'kids', 'are', 'likable', 'admirable', 'proving', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'financially', 'endowed', 'be', 'rich', 'Bravo', 'Lifetime', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'movies', 'quality']",Dawn Anna
