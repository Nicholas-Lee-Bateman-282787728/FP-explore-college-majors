284560,A2EOFYRFB292KS,6301973437,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[8, 12]","Marie Antoinette is presented in this movie as a victim of circumstance, an ordinary woman that is trapped in her Royal Destiny. The only actress at the time that could have done dramatic justice to the character would have been Bette Davis, obviously Norma Shearer looks beautiful in her Adrien version of Versailles which is quiet different from the historical reality, and she has a natural grace and elegance that in America, at the time, would have been considered appropriate for this role. However her lack of depth and uniformity in representing a silly, touchingly sentimental  creature, although not ideal is good at portraying her early persona. Towards the end of the film she is also good at differentiating the feeling of affection for her husband from the true love she felt towards the Count.Marie Antoinette was not just ordinary, she was also very naive and not at all intelligent, as when she arrived in France it took seven years for her to get pregnant and it would have taken more had her brother not pushed the husband into the operation that he desperately needed to be able to perform. We don't quite clearly see this in the movie, nor do we understand either that it was this long period of  time (equivalent in today's time to roughly 12 years, at least as most people, including princes died much younger) without giving the results they had expected was what  really started her on the wrong foot with her people. It is not the youth and lack of experience that were as important as the willingness, the initiative that is missing from her character, which Norma Shearer does convey by an energetic excitement that petters off into vacuity. This is also the reason that she was almost illiterate when she arrived in France, as shown by her primitive handwriting when she signed her marriage document. We don't see this in the movie either, we see Marie Antoinette arriving in Versailles for a splendid wedding,  and realizing on that very moment of presentation to the king that she is marrying the worst man in the family. Robert Morley does an excellent characterization, and is by far the shining star of the production by showing the young Louis XVI  to be border line retarded, a condition that would certainly explain his actions and disastrous reign as king.  John Barrymore is unsurpassed in his interpretation of Louis XV, not only does he look the part, his eyes reveal a connoisseur of feminine beauty when he looks at Marie Antoinette and we can tell he regrets not being young enough to marry her himself. His virilty and gallantry mark all his gestures and moves, one also sees his embarrasement at the complete incapability of his grandson to produce a decent welcoming speech.Gladys George plays Mme du Barry way much more vulgar and ordinary than she would have been allowed to be. Her repartee session with Marie Antoinette never took place, it is a total Holywood invention. It is however true that the king pushed for Marie Antoinette to greet Mme. du Barry, which she conceded to do, at the request of the ambassador as duly noted in the movie, only once and very briefly at a reception in Versailles. The movie sets the scene in a way that we tend to sympathize with Norma Shearer for humilating Mme du Barry in public. This would have never been permitted, but in any case, the real life incident was proof of Marie Antoinette's consistent lack of tact and political understanding. Her job was to follow the king's guidance on social issues, and she should have realized that being civil was not compromising, and if the king and her mother had approved of it, she should have done it earlier and being nicer at it, her childish approach is a premonition as to what she was to do with the unfortunate necklace situation.The Duc d'Orleans as played by Joseph Schildkraut is totally wrong. He was a virile man, not the eunuch with bows and ruffles so exaggerated, we sometimes confuse with the women here. He was however an ambitious, unscrupulous character and he can be credited with inventing the system of modern political campaigning by paying for pamphlets, political advisors and organizing his self promotion along the same lines that it has been done since for politicians seeking office everywhere. Sadly we see none of this manouvering and we see him in a position he never had as an intimate of Marie Antoinette's circle who disliked him intensely and was responsible very early in the reign (1778) in removing him in his post as admiral of the navy, which justifies his activities against the king.Unfortunately the movie misrepresents totally the affair of the necklace. It was the great scandal of the time and the first cannon ball fired against the monarchy. It should have been the center and turning point of this film, not the excuse for Marie Antoinette to wear more feathers than usual to go to the Opera in Paris and hear the verdict from her box.  Basically it was the intention of the Cardinal de Rohan (not Prince de Rohan as shown in the movie) to buy his way into her favor by presenting her with a great gift, which turned out to be a great necklace an over ambitious jeweler had produced for Du Barry but had never been bought by her or anyonelse, for years, though it did look exactly like the one shown in the movie and the price too was about right, roughly the equivalent of 20 million today. In comes Mme de la Motte Valois, a far off descendant of the former ruling house of Valois, and a professional hustler in team with her husband. She makes herself a career by passing herself off as an 'intimate of the queen's circle' and convinces the Cardinal that SHE is the ideal vehicle to present the necklace to the queen. She provides false letters signed ""Marie Antoinette de France"" that anyone would have known were fake because kings and queens sign their first name only, period, no last name, nothing else is required, and he must have known it too, but so great was his desire that the power of denial had the best of him. This is actually not totally surprising as it was an age of deception. (see Barry Lindon, Tom Jones, Les Liasons Dangereuses, Casanova and Cagliostro, which pretty much covers the same swindler-womanizer character and his adventures everywhere in Europe). She hired an actress that looked like the queen and managed an 'interview' at the gardens in Versailles (which were open to the public every day of the year) The Cardinal lost needless to say both the necklace and the money he gave Valois to pay the jeweller. The scenes here merely sketch the plot and are confusing. Marie Antoinette found out about it, like in the movie, from the jeweler directly when he became desperate for payment. The scene of the arrest of the Cardinal was public, at the Royal Chapel in Versailllles the Day of the Ascension mass, and it effectively alinated the court from the king as they obviously sided with the Cardinal. Everyone went to see the Cardinal and Mme Valois when they were arrested and public opinion was against the queen from the minute it happened as by then she was despised and no one could believe her innocence, they all thought she wanted the necklace and had swindeled the Cardinal herself. Had she had any political foresight, Marie Antoinette would have left France right after the scandal. She effectively was no longer queen as she could never go in public without being insulted, loudly and consistently, and this was all happening a full four years before the fall of the Bastille.The romance with Count Fersen, here excellently portrayed by Tyron Power, was much more involved, and physical,  than the idealistic fantasy we see here, which does not make sense even in Disney Land. however, pre-war America was not ready for accepting extra-marital affairs from any woman, even a French queen, and it had to be disguised in this high school-infatuation treatment. She became involved with him after her child birthing duties were over and she naturally turned to a man in her circle that she felt attracted to for a normal relationship she could never have with her impaired husband. Although it is true that he arranged for their flight to Varennes, he never saw her again afterwards. When they return to Paris they do not go back to a prison, they returned to the Tuileries where they lived another full year before the uprising and assult to the palace firmly imprisioned them till the end of their lives. Only her daughter survived into the restoration of the monarchy by her uncles, a bitter witness to the years of terror.Marie Antoinette's greatest moment was her trial. The absence of it in this movie makes it a complete failure from a historical perspective and dramatically, it is incomprehensible. It shows a deep ignorance of the subject from the director as well as a severe lack of consideration for Norma Shearer. Had she had the scene it would have been almost certain that she could have received the Oscar for best actress, for it is the opportunity of a lifetime. It was the vindication for her entire life and its crowning achievement for she triumphed in it above all her enemies, and her own past, in a truly tragic manner that was courageous, dignified, and noble, and deserving of  admiration for the ages. We have the complete transcript and know fully well what went on, which was a great opportunity for her to show the world, and history that she may have lived a frivolous life, but she died a great queen. All her answers are considerate of those who had been loyal, and politically aware. She had learned a lot from the suffering the Revolution brought upon her and her family, and sadly it was too late. It also clearly shows her innocence, as she had never been the ruler, but his wife. His decisions political or not were not hers, all her defense was based on the fact that as his wife, she was to obey him. None of the 40 witnesses could present any definitive, unquestionable proof of the accusations, there was no legal basis for the sentence. At one point she was accussed of incest with her son, and they had procured a declaration from the child, which as she herself explained in her letter to her sister in law, an obvious fabrication  ""remember how easy it is to make children say things they do not even understand"". When she was questioned on the issue she delayed her answered, questioned again she exclaimed dramatically that ""nature itself had not allowed her to answer such an accusation, that she called to witness the mothers there present and ask if they would not have reacted the same as her"". It is at that point we realize that how low France has fallen in thishistorical period, a once great nation, leader of Europe in arts and sophistication,  is here reduced to inventing the inconceivable to justify a crime.We do get the execution scene in the movie but it is not as dramatic and moving as it could have been. Norma Shearer is fine throughout, though not necessarily conveying the stoic, proud stance that was remarked upon by witnesses and is clear in the drawing by David, who was not out to flatter his subject. But the director does not take opportunity of the moment to make it have the impact it should have had. Actually I had forgotten it totally and thought the movie ended with her fictional reunion with the Count in her prison cell.",5,Hollywood Marie Antoinette is Queen of Tinsel and Camp,1250208000,"08

I watched it because Tyrone Power is in it and this the centennial year of his birth in 1914 and I'm rediscovering all of his films. This one was a surprise to be sure. He does a superb job as the Count. However, Norma Shearer as Marie Antoinette is the major personality in this drama and she is nothing short of magnificent. MGM spared no expense to make this movie as historically accurate as possible and it succeeds in bringing us back in time and showing us what life was like for the French royalty at that time.

If anyone deserved the Oscar for 1938, she most certainly did.  Instead, it went to Bette Davis, who deserved the nomination for Jezebel, but compared to Shearer's portrayal its like comparing a Baloney Sandwich (Davis) to Filet Mignon (Shearer).  But, then, in Hollywood, I suppose there were a lot of people who liked baloney.  Nevertheless, her Oscar loss notwithstanding, it is Shearer who makes this film and knowing the tragic outcome makes one sit on the edge of their seat all the more, especially the last hour of the film.

He chose her vehicles wisely so he could show her off in the best possible light.MGM clearly spent an awful lot of money on this film, and on that level, it succeeds mightily.  Everything is over-the-top-impossible and yet, the craftsmen (and women) at Metro bring it off in grand fashion.  It's a visually stunning movie.  It shows what a movie studio can do with the bucks to throw around and make it all happen.And then they plunked Norma Shearer down in the middle of it.Like every other Norma Shearer film, you can sometimes forget that there's a man around somewhere.  Gable is the only costar she had who was memorable in a Shearer film.  Here, Our Lady Norma has none other than Tyrone Power to swoon and sway over.  Is he remembered for this role?  Nope. He doesn't even look like he's interested in this film.  I've said before that Norma relied on (and her directors obviously allowed) her silent movie expressions and here she does it again.  In fact, if you turn the sound off, you would see what I mean.  The same expressions in every film.  All the time.  The same face in ""The Student Prince"" (1927) reacts the same way, twelve years later, in ""The Women"" (1939).  Norma may have been a movie star, but she had learned nothing of film acting at all.

284565,A1KC9VBLF4J93G,6301973437,Benoit Racine,"[63, 66]","10. The script (dialogues)The main scriptwriter on this movie is F. Scott Fitzgerald of ""Great Gatsby"" fame. The love scenes are extremely elaborate and exquisitely structured. They also introduce a few innovations that have since become clich&eacute;s and the hallmark of ""women's pictures"" everywhere.9. The actorsJohn Barrymore is unforgettable as the supremely elegant and regally cranky Louis XV. Robert Morley gives one of his best interpretations. Joseph Schildkraut plays the best two-faced villain of his entire body of work. As for Tyrone Power... remember the anecdote about the reporter asking romance-writer Barbara Cartland (Lady Di's stepmother) how she could possibly have written so many romance novels before she was even married and while she was still a virgin? Her answer was: 'Oh! We didn't have sex in those days. We had Tyrone Power.'8. The directorW.S. Van Dyke was an expert at handling and keeping track of large crowds, a myriad details, heavy production calendars, big budgets, big stars, tyrannical producers and acts of God. His directing style was a compromise between time-efficiency and giving the stars leeway as long as they respected the general style of the piece. This 'honour system' seems to have encouraged the actors to do their homework and present acredible, coherent performance every time. Both W.S. Van Dyke andShearer were fulfilling a legacy to Irving Thalberg and it shows.7. The sets and costumes (artistic direction)What can you say about a period film that tackled the challenge of recreating Versailles in the XVIIIth century on the MGM backlot? The production values are staggering. The Gallery of Mirrors is actually longer, higher and wider than the original. The costumes tread a fine line between historical accuracy (covered shoulders and revealed cleavage) and the requirements of the movie code (exposed shoulders were tolerated but bosoms had to be covered) but still manage to convey the era and the fairy-tale quality of Marie's court. The costumes were also specially constructed to shine, glitter and shimmer on black andwhite film.6. The story (historical accuracy)The film's script is based (in part) on Stefan Zweig's groundbreaking biography of the Queen, ""Marie Antoinette, Portrait of an Ordinary Woman"", which tried to create the first accurate, adult, factual but Freudian-inspired narrative of the Queen's life by using documents and correspondence that had long been overlooked or suppressed. The book was the first to reveal Louis XVI's mechanical sexual problems, which prevented his consummating the marriage during its first seven years (until a slight surgical intervention) and explained in turn the Queen's extravagant spendthrift personality, in Freudian terms, as extreme sexual frustration. This story actually makes it to the screen in a large degree. Compare this to recent bios like ""A Beautiful Mind"", whose scriptwriters conveniently 'forget' essential but non-mainstream plot elements like the fact that John Nash's paranoia may have been caused or amplified by the McCarthy era persecution of homosexuals. Some historical events have been telescoped into one another in order to accommodate the general American public's limited understanding ofFrench history and the Orl&eacute;ans character was used to maintain tension by representing the turncoat part of the nobility which exploited MA for their own various agendas.5. The musicHerbert Stothart may not be a household word but he did win an Oscar for his original score to ""The Wizard of Oz"", based, of course in part on Harold Arlen's melodies. Besides giving Miss Gulch/the Wicked Witch her immortal theme, he is also one half of the composing team that produced the operetta 'Rose Marie'. Stothart shines in two respects: the approximate recreation of XVIIIth century dance music in the court scenes, emphasizing the bored grandeur of the proceedings, and the psychological music that accompanies everything from exciting chase scenes to the love scenes between Shearer and Tyrone. Note especially the use of the harpsichord in a rupture scene between Orl&eacute;ans and MAand the use of the viola d'amour in the garden love scene.4. The cinematographyMA is in 'glorious black and white', but especially in the escape to Varennes sequence which has the most credible - and suspenseful - 'day for night' sequence ever filmed. And what of the marriage scene which must have inspired Queen Elizabeth II's coronation? The matte paintings? The overwhelming use of cranes to move in on particular characters in a crowd scene? The chiaroscuro of the last meeting with Fersen?3. Details and scopeEvery scene has something special added to it in characterization, movement, rhythm, lighting, art direction, choreography (and not just in the dance scenes). The costumes could have starred in a picture by themselves.2. The lost art of story-tellingThis film was planned with intelligence and skill and was built around the principle stated by Selznick when filming GWTW: 'The secret of adapting a book to the screen is to give the impression that you are adapting a book to the screen.' Which means that many literary devices are used to give the story many interesting arcs and recurring themes. The story is well balanced in terms of spectacular action, recreationof important historical events (giving the impression of the passage of time) and intimate scenes. It is truly 'the intimate epic' that Mankiewicz's 'Cleopatra' was supposed to be. Needless to say I am dreading Sofia Coppola's upcoming infantilized version ...1. Norma ShearerNorma Shearer is an unjustly forgotten star of the first magnitude. MA is a permanent testament to her uncanny abilities. In this film she portrays the main character from the age of sixteen to her death as a prematurely aged and debilitated woman of 38, all with perfect verisimilitude, thanks to her magnificent vocal instrument and stage presence. As a fairy-queen, she makes Cate Blanchett as Galadriel (in LOTR) look like Carol Burnett's charwoman. Her virtuosity as the fated widowed Queen is all the more poignant when one realizes that at thetime she was Thalberg's widow in her last husband-approved venture and that the Hollywood suits were rapidly closing in on her.",5,"Top Ten Reasons why ""Marie Antoinette"" is quite possibly the best movie ever made in Hollywood",1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,6262,"['10', 'script', 'dialogues',

Fortunately, every penny of MGM's French Revolution tragedy shows up on-screen. The sets, the b/w cinematography, and of course the Adrian costumes (the large hooped gowns which barely pass through the doorways are a movie onto themselves) culminate in one opulent, frenzied, pageant of a story. Norma Shearer Thalberg is the quintessential queen; it's interesting to see her age throughout the film. Though there are always critics who need to nitpick at her age appropriateness (sp?) for this film, I think she does a perfectly credible job going from a teenager to a young adult at the time of execution (age 36 or so when she was guillotined). There are several astonishing moments: the wedding night sequence with Shearer and a frigid but completely awkward and shy Robert Morley; the costume party/blind man's bluff game with Shearer and Reginald Gardiner (which becomes deliciously provocative); and of course, the final scenes with an imprisoned Shearer who has by now aged so severely she is barely  recognized by lover Tyrone Power.

284570,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6301973437,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","In honor of the 220th anniversary of Marie Antoinette's infamous demise, and the recent 75th anniversary of this film's release ( it premiered in Los Angeles on July 8, 1938-six days before Bastille Day), I pay my editorial tribute to this opulent black and white film, directed by W.S. Van Dyke and Julien Duvivier, and written by Claudine West, Donald Ogden Stewart, Ernest Vajda, Stefan Zweig, Talbot Jennings, and most notably F. Scott Fitzgerald, the last of , of course was best known for  literary portrayals of the beautiful and the damned of a later era.I recall my first encounter with this movie as a child in the late 1970s. The grandiose calligraphied title appeared on our television screen, and I heard my Mom say, ""Marie Antoinette...She was beheaded.""I only watched up until the siege of the palace when the angry mob was cornering the royal family, and the young Princess Therese ( Marilyn Knowlden) was crying. After that, I either lost interest or just had a nap. Can't remember which.During the next decade, as my comprehension of Marie Antoinette  as a historical figure grew, I remembered it and I longed to see it again, this time from beginning to end. As the 80s went on, I finally did, sometime after Norma Shearer died in 1983,and I began to appreciate her fabulous talent as well as her beauty in this role as well as other roles she played.We first see her on a fateful day when her governess Feldy (Cecil Cunningham) presents her to he mother, Austrian Empress Maria Theresa(Alma Kruger) to inform her that her marriage decree to the Dauphin of France(Robert Morley) has been signed. Noteworthy is the fact that this is the first movie to be partially filmed on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles.The historically recorded delight of the teenager at this prospect is duly reenacted. The young Austrian Princess is received at the French Court with all due fanfare, although she is a bit awkward at first.23 years later, she will travel along the same route in the opposite direction before crowds with a much different sentiment....What transpires in between those 23 years is  a  tale of court intrigues, rivalries, and a lack of interest in helping a newcomer become the  ruler that she needed to be due to jealousy, spite,  and a disinterest in what was really best for the state. Like any courtier, the young Dauphine lives in her own frivolous little world, spending extravagantly, and publically showing  little regard for the people in need. She sees her weak husband dominated by his grandfather, King Louis XV(John Barrymore), although he eventually stands up to him.Initially, she is mocked by courtiers for her inability to conceive, which Louis reveals to be his fault, although after he has an operation, they have children, including  a little Dauphin, also named Louis( a freckled, spry, and delightful Scotty Becket).A night in a gaming house introduces her to her ally and alleged lover, Count Axel de Fersen(Tyrone Power), a Swedish diplomat. There is a  highly comical sequence when she meets her father-in-law's mistress, Madame Du Barry(Gladys George).But from the beginning, the Duc d'Orleans( a subtly sinister Joseph Schildkraut) greases the wheels of the monarchy's downfall by making them pursue ruinous policies.The film captures the salient points of the doomed Queen's life--the Affair of the Necklace, the storming of the Bastille,  the attack on the palace, and the incredible tension leading to the couple's doomed flight from Varennes.Anita Louise plays the Queen's equally ill-fated friend, the Princess de Lamballe.Morley is at his best when portraying the strength of the King just after telling his wife he was been sentenced to death. He is brave, stoic, and slightly comical before saying Grace with his family in their prison quarters one last time.Norma Shearer's anguish at the distant sound of the drum roll precluding his execution could have been genuine, as she may well have been reliving her own recent loss of her husband, producer Irving Thalberg, who had conceived the idea of making this film. The role of a brave widow soldiering on required no acting for her, and anyone with any feeling for children could empathize with her fighting like a tigress when the revolutionary guards come to take her son away.Her final days are dramatically portrayed with her being comforted by Count Fersen. The light having gone completely from the eyes of the once lissome young girl as she awaits her fate.While inevitably some details were inaccurate, this sparkling sharp, black and white piece is still fascinating to watch. It is an intriguing part of the legacy inspired by the doomed Queen, and is part of a legacy of ongoing empathy for one of History's most polarizing and tragic figures.",5,Norma Shearer in a Dazzling

284571,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301973437,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 7]","Irving Thalberg (1899 -1936) never tired of seeing his beloved wife Norman Shearer (1902-83) in films, especially period pieces. Thalberg rescued her from a reasonably undistinguished though profitable career in silent films when they married in 1927 and he put her in ""The Divorcee"" (1930) for which she won the Oscar. Despite her successes (6 Oscar nominations), Thalberg's love for her had her playing roles in which she was far too old to be realistic. She played the teenage Juliette in 1936 and in 1938 she plays the teenage Marie Antoinette. It's just plain silly to see a 36 year old woman trying her best to act like an 18th century teenager. BTW - this was Thalberg's last film. He died while it was still in the planning stage.If Shearer's prancing like an adolescent isn't enough to make you fast forward, the deadly slow pace of the film will. Co-star Tyrone Power (1914-1958) doesn't even show up until 40+ minutes into the film, and then disappears again for quite a while.Of course the film is not entirely without its merits. The costumes and the music are great, as one would expect in a $2+ million film in 1938. Robert Morley (1908-92) steals the show in his film debut as the shy Louis XVI, although his performance seems more invented than biographical. Morley, of course, was a great actor, and for his role in this film he was nominated for an Oscar (but lost to Walter Brennan in ""Kentucky""). He was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""Who's Killing the Great Chefs of Europe"" (1978), but personally I thought his best performance was as the missionary in ""The African Queen"" (1951).It's always good to see John Barrymore (1882-1942) who plays Louis XV, Morley's father... He'd been in Romeo and Juliette with Shearer in 1936 and appears with her again here. This was one of his last films, though he managed to get in ""The Great Man Votes"" the following year.Woody van Dyke (1889-1943) directs. Best known for his ""Thin Man"" films, for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1935, he also received a nomination for ""San Francisco"" (1936) and directed Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald in 6 of their films. Van Dyke enjoyed exotic locations and made such films as ""Heart of the Yukon"" (1927), ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), ""Eskimo"" (1933), ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) and ""Cairo"" (1942).Herbert Stothart (1885-1949) was the composer and often worked with van Dyke. Stothart won the Oscar for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and was nominated 9 more times, including for this film. He was often used in period pieces, and his films include ""Treasure Island"" (1934), Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), and ""Romeo and Juliette"" (1936).The costumes are great, sets are lavish, and Stothart's music is wonderful. Morley is a hoot. The film received 4 Oscar nominations (Morley, Shearer, Stothart) but didn't win. The big Oscar winner that year was ""You Can't Take it With You"" (Picture, Director).  Marie Antoinette was the 5th top grossing film of the year. The top grossing films were ""You Can't Take it With You"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", `Boys Town"", ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", and ""Sweethearts.  Other notable films released that year were ""Algiers"", Cagney and O'Brien in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", John Garfield's film debut in ""Four Daughters"" and Gable and Tracey in ""Test Pilot"".Despite the popular and critical reception, Marie Antoinette does not stand up to the test of time. It's far too long and Shearer's antics as a teenager are simply not convincing. Moreover, the goings on at court, while risqu&eacute; for 1938, seem tame by later standards.",2,Boring,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,3661,"['Irving', 'Thalberg', '1899', '-1936', 'never', 'tired', 'seeing', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Norman', 'Shearer', '1902-83', 'films', 'especially', 'period', 'pieces', 'Thalberg', 'rescued', 'reasonably', 'undistinguished', 'profitable', 'career', 'silent', 'films', 'when', 'married', '1927', 'put', 'Divorcee', '1930', 'won', 'Oscar', 'successes', '6', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Thalberg', 'love', 'had', 'playing', 'roles', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'realistic', 'played', 'teenage', 'Juliette', '1936', '1938', 'teenage', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'see', '36', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'trying', 'best', 'act', '18th', 'century', 'teenager', 'BTW', 'was', 'Thalberg', 'last', 'film', 'died', 'was', 'still', 'planning', 'stage.If', 'Shearer', 'prancing', 'adolescent', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'fast', 'forward', 'deadly', 'slow', 'pace', 'film', 'will', 'Co-star', 'Tyrone', 'Power', '1914-1958', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', '40+', 'minutes', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'quite', 'while.Of', 'course', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'merits', 'costumes', 'music', 'are', 'great', 'one', 'would', 'expect', '2+', 'million', 'film', '1938', 'Robert', 'Morley', '1908-92', 'show', 'film', 'debut', 'shy', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'performance', 'more', 'invented', 'biographical', 'Morley', 'course', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'lost', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Kentucky', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Who', 'Killing', 'Great', 'Chefs', 'Europe', '1978', 'personally', 'thought', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'missionary', 'African', 'Queen', '1951', '.It', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'John', 'Barrymore', '1882-1942', 'who', 'Louis', 'XV', 'Morley', 'father', ""'d"", 'been', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', 'Shearer', '1936', 'again', 'here', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'managed', 'get', 'Great', 'Man', 'Votes', 'following', 'year.Woody', 'van', 'Dyke', '1889-1943', 'directs', 'Best', 'known', 'Thin', 'Man', 'films', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '1935', 'also', 'received', 'nomination', 'San', 'Francisco', '1936', 'directed', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'Jeanette', 'Macdonald', '6', 'films', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'enjoyed', 'exotic', 'locations', 'made', 'such', 'films', 'Heart', 'Yukon', '1927', 'White', 'Shadows', 'South', 'Seas', '1928', 'Eskimo', '1933', 'Northwest', 'Passage', '1940', 'Cairo', '1942', '.Herbert', 'Stothart', '1885-1949', 'was', 'composer', 'often', 'worked', 'van', 'Dyke', 'Stothart', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '1939', 'was', 'nominated', '9', 'more', 'times', 'including', 'film', 'was', 'often', 'used', 'period', 'pieces', 'films', 'include', 'Treasure', 'Island', '1934', 'Viva', 'Villa', '1934', 'David', 'Copperfield', '1935', 'Anna', 'Karenina', '1935', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', '1935', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', '1936', '.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'sets', 'are', 'lavish', 'Stothart', 'music', 'wonderful', 'Morley', 'hoot', 'film', 'received', '4', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Morley', 'Shearer', 'Stothart', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'big', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'year', 'was', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', '5th', 'top', 'grossing', 'film', 'year', 'top', 'grossing', 'films', 'were', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Boys', 'Town', 'Alexander', 'Ragtime', 'Band', 'Sweethearts', 'Other', 'notable', 'films', 'released', 'year', 'were', 'Algiers', 'Cagney', ""O'Brien"", 'Angels', 'Dirty', 'Faces', 'John', 'Garfield', 'film', 'debut', 'Four', 'Daughters', 'Gable', 'Tracey', 'Test', 'Pilot', 'popular', 'critical', 'reception', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'test', 'time', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Shearer', 'antics', 'teenager', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'convincing', 'Moreover', 'goings', 'court', 'risqu', 'eacute', '1938', 'seem', 'tame', 'later', 'standards']",N/A

Anderson,"[1, 1]","Ever since I saw the dreadful adaptation of Marie Antoinette's life as a gueen by Sophia Coppola, I have been fascinated by Marie Antoinette and have been trying to learn as much as I can about the former queen of France. I just finished viewing the 1938 black and white classic ""Marie Antoinette"" starring Norma Shearer, Tyrone Power, John Barrymore, and Robert Morley. Just like Sophia Coppola's film, this 1938 film focuses on Marie Antoinette's life as the dauphine/Queen of France.I have to say that I enjoyed this film much more than the modern telling of Marie Antoinette's life as a queen. Norma Shearer was absolutely gorgeous as the queen. Her performance was riveting. I had my doubts that she would be able to pass herself off as a teenage Marie Antoinette but she did with ease. Her final scenes in the film were emotionally moving. I especially loved her final scenes with Robert Morley as Louis. Robert Morley was excellent as Louis XVI. He was everything that Louis XVI was described to be in the biography by Antonia Fraser. Everyone in the film gave excellent performances.There were a few minor quibbles I took issues with in the story but for the most part I found the film accurate for the most part. I found this film vastly superior over Sophia Coppola's film.",4,A wonderful classic,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,1283,"['Ever', 'saw', 'dreadful', 'adaptation', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'gueen', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'have', 'been', 'fascinated', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'learn', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'former', 'queen', 'France', 'just', 'finished', 'viewing', '1938', 'black', 'white', 'classic', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'starring', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Just', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'film', '1938', 'film', 'focuses', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'dauphine/Queen', 'France.I', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'telling', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'queen', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'was', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'queen', 'performance', 'was', 'riveting', 'had', 'doubts', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pass', 'off', 'teenage', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'did', 'ease', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'especially', 'loved', 'final', 'scenes', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Louis', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'was', 'excellent', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'was', 'everything', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'was', 'described', 'be', 'biography', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'Everyone', 'film', 'gave', 'excellent', 'performances.There', 'were', 'few', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'took', 'issues', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'film', 'accurate', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'film', 'vastly', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'film']",N/A
284573,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301973437,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","It's somewhat disheartening to find out after viewing this lavish black-and-white 1938 MGM epic that it was intended to be filmed in color. Budget overruns made this impossible at the time, but otherwise the studio pulled out all the stops to make this significant slice of fictionalized French history into a star vehicle for its reigning queen, Norma Shearer. With all its pomp and circumstance directed lugubriously by studio journeyman W.S. Van Dyke, the film's self-importance gets wearing over its lengthy 160-minute running time. However, the movie also manages character arcs and a historical context rather lacking in Sofia Coppola's recent new-wave revisionist portrayal. That's primarily because Coppola's film covers little more than one-half of the story covered here. The new 2006 DVD does justice to the lavish film with a pristine print transfer that makes it easy to enjoy all the period detail recreated by the craftsmen on the MGM back lot, including a replication of Versailles that was apparently twice the size of the actual palace.The two-plus decade-long story begins with the young Austrian princess Marie Antoinette excited to find out she is to be married to the Dauphin of France, Louis XVI, and destined to become that country's queen. Her enthusiasm dissipates as her intended turns out to be a bulbous social misfit uninterested in leading the country or consummating the marriage. In the meantime, his father Louis XV carries on with the vulgar Madame du Barry, while Marie remains cloistered in Versailles. The ambitious Duke Philippe d'Orleans convinces Marie to dive headlong into the Paris social scene to raise her profile. This leads to her meeting with the dashing Count Axel de Fersen of Sweden, a relationship that moves from flirtatious to romantic to indispensable.However, frustrated after four years by the lack of an heir and spurred on by his mistress, Louis XV decides to annul the marriage and send Marie back to Austria. By fate, Louis XV dies, and Louis XVI and Marie become France's ruling monarchs. But they are faced with increasing hostility caused by France's burgeoning economic woes and compounded by a jewelry conspiracy against Marie. With little resistance, the peasants storm the palace to hold the royal family captive. An escape plan is hatched, and the rest of the story shows the road to the inevitable fate of the monarchy. This is the type of luxuriant epic that actually has an overture, an intermission and exit music (and an opportunity to cut eleven minutes off the running time when you fast forward over these chapters).Shearer dominates the show from start to finish, and her innate theatricality can be a rather acquired taste. In the first half, although photographed most flatteringly at age 38, she overdoes the character's youthful zeal but manages moments of sincerity. When Marie becomes a social gadfly, Shearer's naturally impervious manner seems to suit the extravagance of her character, but she is burdened by the pacing of the film's plodding first half, with the primary focus on the opulent sets and endless dialogue scenes. In the second half, however, when Marie's fate becomes sealed, the actress becomes genuinely sublime even in the most predictably melodramatic scenes. This is when you begin to realize why she was Queen of MGM at the time.Although a very young and handsome Tyrone Power is her nominal co-star as Fersen, he has little to do but be appropriately smitten with Marie and conveniently show up at the most pivotal moments of crises. In his film debut, Robert Morley fares better as the awkward Louis XVI as he moves his initially pitiable character to more humanistic territory through the course of the story. A character actress not known for historical roles, Gladys George makes a deliciously nasty du Barry. Unfortunately, with his painted eyebrows and constant sneer, Joseph Schildkraut makes d'Orleans smarmy without real depth, while John Barrymore is so over-the-top hammy as Louis XV that one wonders whether someone told him that this was not meant to be a farce. All the exterior elements - Adrian's elaborate costumes, Cedric Gibbons' period art direction, William H. Daniels' sharp cinematography - are grade-A MGM product.The DVD comes with three brief extras - two shorts and a theatrical trailer that implies initial box office returns from its road show engagements must have been somewhat disappointing. The first short, ""Hollywood Goes to Town"", shows the elaborate preparations for the premiere of ""Marie Antoinette"" including footage from the premiere itself. The second, ""Another Romance of Celluloid"", has an intriguing preface stating how racially insensitive portrayals are included in the short. This amounts to shots of black sharecroppers picking cotton to show how it eventually becomes film stock, again using ""Marie Antoinette"" as the prototype, and then the featurette becomes an advertisement for MGM's announced productions schedule for 1938 including some films that were never realized. The lengthy film is an interesting curio worth seeing and sometimes even more than that.",4,Shearer Lets Them Eat Cake in a Most Opulent MGM Production,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,5122,"['somewhat',

The detail (and this lavish movie is all detail) has never been as visible. It's truly breathtaking. PLUS; There's the Overture, Intermission, and Exit music! As many times as I've seen MARIE ANTOINETTE, I'd never heard that music - and it is a terrific treat (The intermission music even has a song set to the love theme - and a ""heavenly chorus"" with a tenor!).This is an unbearably romantic and sentimental re-telling of the tragic queen.

284576,A2BPDFR58H9575,6301973437,Galina,"[12, 12]","During the last week, I saw two movies with the same title that both focuse on the life of the last Queen of France, Marie-Antoinette (1755-1793). Both films start when Marie is 15 and she leaves her beloved Vienna to marry the future Luis XVI, the Dauphine of France, one year her senior. Unlike the Coppola picture, W.S. Van Dyke's 1938 film, takes the royal couple through their imprisonment and all the way to the guillotine. The final chapter of Marie Antoinette's life from July 1789 until her execution in 1793 is filled with losses, falls, and deepest tragedy. We witness an unsuccessful attempt of Royal family to leave the country which brought both, the King and the Queen to the trial for treason; execution of her husband on the guillotine, separation from her son who was taken from her on the very day of Louis XVI's death, brought to court to testify against her, and died in captivity when he was 12 years old. She herself was accused among the other things in sexual abuse of her son. To this horrible accusation, the former queen, ""the Widow Capet"" or simply ""Antoinette Capet"" replied with the genuine royal dignity, ""If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother...""As much as I did not like Sophia Coppola's boring horror in pink, I truly enjoyed the old film which was released on DVD for the first time on October 10, 2006. The movie made almost 70 years ago has everything right. With 157 minutes of the run time, it moves and breezes freely. It is lavish, staggering grandeur that perfectly represents the golden days of Hollywood and I am sure it still will attract and amaze the viewers many years from now. There are multiple reasons for it. One of them is the intelligent script based on the famous biography by Stefan Zweig, ""Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman"" which focuses on the human emotions of the ordinary people who happened to live and die during the extraordinary times. The love scenes between Marie Antoinette (Norman Shearer) and the Swedish count Axel de Fensen (Tyrone Power -just imagine the young Alain Delon but more passionate) are exquisite and emotional without being overtly sentimental. Acting also must be mentioned. Everybody shines in the film starting with powerful and extravagant Louis XV (John Barrimor) to whom belongs the famous phrase, ""After me, the deluge."" It turned out to be prophetic. Louis XVI (Robert Morley in his film debut practically stole the show and earned the nomination for the Best Supporting Actor), the grandson of Louis XV, reaped the whirlwind sown by his predecessors, and was swept away in the French Revolution--even though he himself was relatively modest, unassuming, and moral. Louis XVI as played by Robert Morley would've made an excellent locksmith. He would've been an obedient and loyal citizen and perhaps a happy father of the family somewhere in the quiet province. Instead, he had became the King of France who would end his days on the guillotine. Joseph Schildkraut is marvelous as the snake-like intriguing Philippe Joseph II, Duke of Orl&eacute;ans who had changed his name to Citoyen Philippe &Eacute;galit&eacute;, supported the French Revolution, voted on the National Assembly for the death of the king but was nonetheless guillotined during the Reign of Terror very soon after Louis XVI. Norma Shearer is very convincing playing a nave average young woman in a beginning of the movie and she makes you forget that she was 20 years older than Antoinette in the first scenes. As her character matures and changes, her performance changes, too, becoming heartbreaking and very touching in the last scenes. The ""Last Supper"" scene is simply unforgettable with both Morley and Shearer at the peak of their acting abilities.I can go on for long time praising a competent directing, masterfully created set and decorations, attention to the small details, moving and believable intimate scenes and historical accuracy - any way you look at it, ""Marie Antoinette"" (1938) is a triumph of filmmaking and I highly recommend it.",5,Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,4105,"['last', 'week', 'saw', 'two', 'movies', 'same', 'title', 'focuse', 'life', 'last', 'Queen', 'France', 'Marie-Antoinette', '1755-1793', 'films', 'start', 'when', 'Marie', '15', 'beloved', 'Vienna', 'marry', 'future', 'Luis', 'XVI', 'Dauphine', 'France', 'one', 'year', 'senior', 'Coppola', 'picture', 'W.S', 'Van', 'Dyke', '1938', 'film', 'royal', 'couple', 'imprisonment', 'way', 'guillotine', 'final', 'chapter', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'July', '1789', 'execution', '1793', 'filled', 'losses', 'falls', 'deepest', 'tragedy', 'witness', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'Royal', 'family', 'leave', 'country', 'brought', 'King', 'Queen', 'trial', 'treason', 'execution', 'husband', 'guillotine', 'separation', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'taken', 'very', 'day', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'death', 'brought', 'court', 'testify', 'died', 'captivity', 'when', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'accused', 'other', 'things', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'son', 'horrible', 'accusation', 'former', 'queen', 'Widow', 'Capet', 'simply', 'Antoinette', 'Capet', 'replied', 'genuine', 'royal', 'dignity', 'have', 'not', 'replied', 'Nature', 'respond', 'charge', 'laid', 'mother', 'As', 'much', 'did', 'not', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'boring', 'horror', 'pink', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'old', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'October', '10', '2006', 'movie', 'made', 'almost', '70', 'years', 'ago', 'everything', 'right', '157', 'minutes', 'run', 'time', 'freely', 'lavish', 'staggering', 'grandeur', 'perfectly', 'golden', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'am', 'sure', 'still', 'will', 'attract', 'amaze', 'viewers', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'are', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'One', 'intelligent', 'script', 'based', 'famous', 'biography', 'Stefan', 'Zweig', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Portrait', 'Average', 'Woman', 'human', 'emotions', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'happened', 'live', 'die', 'extraordinary', 'times', 'love', 'scenes', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Norman', 'Shearer', 'Swedish', 'count', 'Axel', 'Fensen', 'Tyrone', 'Power', '-just', 'imagine', 'young', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'more', 'passionate', 'are', 'exquisite', 'emotional', 'being', 'overtly', 'sentimental', 'Acting', 'also', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Everybody', 'film', 'starting', 'powerful', 'extravagant', 'Louis', 'XV', 'John', 'Barrimor', 'whom', 'famous', 'phrase', 'deluge', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'prophetic', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'film', 'debut', 'practically', 'stole', 'show', 'earned', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'grandson', 'Louis', 'XV', 'reaped', 'whirlwind', 'sown', 'predecessors', 'was', 'swept', 'away', 'French', 'Revolution', 'even', 'was', 'relatively', 'modest', 'unassuming', 'moral', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'played', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'excellent', 'locksmith', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'obedient', 'loyal', 'citizen', 'perhaps', 'happy', 'father', 'family', 'somewhere', 'quiet', 'province', 'Instead', 'had', 'became', 'King', 'France', 'who', 'would', 'end', 'days', 'guillotine', 'Joseph', 'Schildkraut', 'marvelous', 'snake-like', 'intriguing', 'Philippe', 'Joseph', 'II', 'Duke', 'Orl', 'eacute', 'ans', 'who', 'had', 'changed', 'name', 'Citoyen', 'Philippe', 'Eacute', 'galit', 'eacute', 'supported', 'French', 'Revolution', 'voted', 'National', 'Assembly', 'death', 'king', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'guillotined', 'Reign', 'Terror', 'very', 'soon', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'very', 'convincing', 'playing', 'nave', 'average', 'young', 'woman', 'beginning', 'movie', 'forget', 'was', '20', 'years', 'older', 'Antoinette', 'first', 'scenes', 'character', 'matures', 'changes', 'performance', 'changes', 'too', 'becoming', 'heartbreaking', 'very', 'touching', 'last', 'scenes', 'Last', 'Supper', 'scene', 'simply', 'unforgettable', 'Morley', 'Shearer', 'peak', 'acting', 'abilities.I', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'time', 'praising', 'competent', 'directing', 'masterfully', 'created', 'set', 'decorations', 'attention', 'small', 'details', 'moving', 'believable', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'way', 'look', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', '1938', 'triumph', 'filmmaking', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Thus, I would only add a few comments:  first, while many would have preferred to see this film in color, I believe its validity is actually enhanced in black and white.  As a historian but without serious knowledge of the particular period, I can say that the film is an amazing example of what it very well must have been like in fact; any historical inaccuracies do not in any way disturb the quality of the narrative and are incidental only to movie making and not to reality.  The principal actors, especially Shearer and Morley, are so astonishingly convincing that one hardly doubts that they are in fact the King and Queen of France.  Because this is so, and despite whatever historical facts may exist to the contrary, there is legitimate reason to sympathize with their fate and the viewer is numbed by the dignity with which these helpless people live it out.  If there is any weakness, I would have to say it lies with Tyrone Power, whose handsome and youthful good looks clash with the somewhat wooden dialogue and his often inept articulation of it.  Finally, for 180 minutes, the film seems like seconds from the intial scenes before the Austrian Empress to the denoument in the holding cell.  It is more than an extravaganza, it is breathtaking in both its scope and detail and is a film I would want to see many, many times over.  While the outcome is well known, still it leaves the viewer stunned and silent for days to come.

284581,A3I4IK25D7ATYY,6301973437,JamesJames,"[10, 12]","Leave the new KIRSTEN DUNST music video alone, and RUN purchase this extraordinary, just released, 1938 film with Norma Shearer as the French queen.If you want to know where Meryl Streep got her acting technique from, watch Shearer. Yes, there are moments, mostly when she's required to 'enter' a scene, when she's over-directed - but one must remember this was almost seventy years ago, and talkies were only a decade old. The majority of her screen time is a master class for film actors: her choices are stunningly complex yet exquistely simple and truthful. They will leave you, literally, momentarily breathless. It is difficult to grasp, by the end of the movie, that the actor playing the young Hapsburg princess is the same actor awaiting execution. One knows it's Norma Shearer, but she somehow has actually aged before our eyes, without the help of heavy makeup or props. The journey from Vienna to Versailles, to the Conciergerie to the Place de la Concorde is made by an actor whose ability to show her character's soul transforming, moment to terrible moment, defies comparison or explanation. The sole performance which comes close to this is perhaps Vivien Leigh's in STREETCAR, but that would come nearly twenty years later and even it, like much of Streep's work, seems 'mannered' when referencing Shearer's Marie.The film is a wonder of imagery and restrained scoring - and the DVD transfer immaculate. The supporting cast, with the exception of a beautiful but rather wooden young Tyrone Power, is a dream. The discreet scale of the sets and the luminous costumes make the point that we are in another world, without overpowering us - the way the modern film does. This is also thanks to the extraordinary power of silver nitrate film stock, which has never been equaled since - in color or black and white. The script is poignant, smart and brutally honest.Every actor, desiring to work in film, should buy this to study Shearer's seemless work. Every lover of history should purchase this for the remarkable job it does shedding intimate light on such a chaotic time.

The French queen's life story was especially attractive for them to showcase their #1 stockholder, the recently widowed Norma Shearer, who favored playing the great romantic roles (such as Elizabeth Barrett and Juliet Capulet) after her marriage to the MGM chief of production Irving Thalberg ensured she'd get them. To be fair to Shearer, she was one of the biggest stars of the period even without her marriage to Thalberg, although she was much more fun in her sizzling sinner roles in contemporary films  of the early Thirties (like RIPTIDE and A FREE SOUL) than in these noble romantic roles she played later. She does work hard, though, and if she gets to shout ""Silence!"" imperiously to her courtiers a few too many times (when she's not gurgling at them in coy delight), she's still quite likable in her early scenes where she manages to pull off her attempts at girlish coltishness quite convincingly. Her best scenes are with Robert Morley, who continues to impress (decades after the film was made) as Louis XVI, who is here suggested to be mentally limited: something about Morley seems to pull Shearer up to a higher level, and the two seem genuinely fond of one another.John Barrymore is the corrupt old Louis XV; as Madame du Barry, Gladys George has a grand old time wearing great gowns and trading catty barbs with Shearer; Joseph Schildkraut gets to wear a heart-shaped beauty mark over his whitened face as the Duc d'Orleans to indicate he's the most thorough rotter in the whole piece. The sets are absolutely spectacular (some scenes were even shot at Versailles, a first for Hollywood), and the costumes even better; they make the whole film worth seeing even if the film does go on for too long. W. S. Van Dyke sometimes goes in for very conventional direction, but at other times genuinely surprises you with his intelligence and sensitivity--as when he engineers a great crane shot at Marie's grand ball which starts at the level of the hall where the aristocrats are dancing and then pulls up to a gallery far above where Morley, as the lonely and awkward Dauphin, watches his wife.",4,"""Ma-MA, I am to be queen of FRAHNCE!""",1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,2391,"['Given', 'huge', 'success', 'MGM', 'had', 'spectacle', 'Great', 'Depression', 'particularly', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ZIEGFELD', '1936', 'was', 'practically', 'inevitable', 'would', 'choose', 'mount', 'huge', 'production', 'life', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'just', 'could', 'get', 'Adrian', 'do', 'costumes', 'French', 'queen', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'especially', 'attractive', 'showcase', '1', 'stockholder', 'recently', 'widowed', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'who', 'favored', 'playing', 'great', 'romantic', 'roles', 'such', 'Elizabeth', 'Barrett', 'Juliet', 'Capulet', 'marriage', 'MGM', 'chief', 'production', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'ensured', ""'d"", 'get', 'be', 'fair', 'Shearer', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', 'period', 'even', 'marriage', 'Thalberg', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'sizzling', 'sinner', 'roles', 'contemporary', 'films', 'early', 'Thirties', 'RIPTIDE', 'A', 'FREE', 'SOUL', 'noble', 'romantic', 'roles', 'played', 'later', 'work', 'hard', 'shout', 'Silence', 'imperiously', 'courtiers', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'not', 'gurgling', 'coy', 'delight', 'still', 'quite', 'likable', 'early', 'scenes', 'where', 'pull', 'off', 'attempts', 'girlish', 'coltishness', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'who', 'impress', 'decades', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'who', 'here', 'suggested', 'be', 'mentally', 'limited', 'something', 'Morley', 'pull', 'Shearer', 'up', 'higher', 'level', 'two', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'fond', 'one', 'another.John', 'Barrymore', 'corrupt', 'old', 'Louis', 'XV', 'Madame', 'du', 'Barry', 'Gladys', 'George', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'wearing', 'great', 'gowns', 'trading', 'catty', 'barbs', 'Shearer', 'Joseph', 'Schildkraut', 'wear', 'heart-shaped', 'beauty', 'mark', 'whitened', 'face', 'Duc', ""d'Orleans"", 'indicate', 'most', 'thorough', 'rotter', 'whole', 'piece', 'sets', 'are', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'scenes', 'were', 'even', 'shot', 'Versailles', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'costumes', 'even', 'better', 'make', 'whole', 'film', 'seeing', 'even', 'film', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'W.', 'S.', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'sometimes', 'very', 'conventional', 'direction', 'other', 'times', 'genuinely', 'intelligence', 'sensitivity', 'when', 'great', 'crane', 'shot', 'Marie', 'grand', 'ball', 'level', 'hall', 'where', 'aristocrats', 'are', 'dancing', 'then', 'up', 'gallery', 'far', 'where', 'Morley', 'lonely', 'awkward', 'Dauphin', 'wife']",N/A

284584,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,6301973437,Jeff  Farrow,"[2, 2]","NOTE: This review was written in reaction against the recent Kirsten Dunst film]The interesting thing about Marie-Antoinette is that she was a rather ordinary woman of her class who, through motherhood & unbelievably bad luck (like a revolution), nonetheless matured as an individual & discovered the courage to face the terrors life had in store for her. In many ways her story parallels that of Princess Diana. The royal marriage that was supposed to be something out of a fairy tale, turns out to be more a deadly nightmare instead. Both had husbands who were really not interested in them; Diana's because of adultery, and Marie-Antoinette's due to her husband's physical impediment. They both fiercely loved their children--and, of course, both died tragically.Marie-Antoinette also pre-shadowed Diana's hounding by the paparazzi. She was the first monarch to fall victim to the (printing) press. The hated Austrian Queen of France was subject to an unrelenting & savgage attack in slanderous articles, broadsides & vicious cartoons. All the problems in France at that time were said to be instigated by her. She was accused of every crime & sin in the book. We won't go into that, but the point is that there was such more to the real story of this ill-fated woman.An early Hollywood B&W; film ""Marie-Antoinette"" even with all its historic inaccuracies & romanticisms hit truer to the mark than Coppola's nonsense. Actress Norma Shearer is very good in the role, ranging from fifteen to thirty-seven. Of course she never really appears to physically age in the film until the final scenes (that would have been a box office no-no), but she conveyed the age progression through her art. In one scene a timeless moment of acting brilliance is captured in the picture. It is the scene following the King's execution. Marie-Antoinette, who by this time had developed a solid marriage & deep friendship with Louis, is alone in a dingy cell with her son & daughter. The revolutionists barge in with an order to permanently remove the boy from his mother's care. As they go to take him, Norma Shearer lunges at them screaming, almost snarling, ""You're not going to take my son!""The authenticity of the performance, in that one moment, is a revelation of real acting talent.That one B&W; scene from a typical 1930's Hollywood costume drama rose to a level of artistic achievement that leaves the Kirsten Dunst ""Marie-Antoinette"" in the dust.Marie AntoinetteMarie Antoinette: A Film by David GrubinMarie Antoinette: Scapegoat QueenThe DuchessMarie Antoinette: The JourneyA Tale of Two CitiesA Tale of Two Cities (1935)Tale of Two Cities: Literary Masterpieces [VHS]A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics)",4,An Ill-Fated Woman Who Rose to Meet Each Challenge,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,2701,"['NOTE', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'reaction', 'recent', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'film', ']', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'was', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'class', 'who', 'motherhood', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'luck', 'revolution', 'nonetheless', 'matured', 'individual', 'discovered', 'courage', 'face', 'terrors', 'life', 'had', 'store', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'parallels', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'royal', 'marriage', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'something', 'fairy', 'tale', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'deadly', 'nightmare', 'instead', 'had', 'husbands', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'not', 'interested', 'Diana', 'adultery', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'due', 'husband', 'physical', 'impediment', 'fiercely', 'loved', 'children', 'course', 'died', 'tragically.Marie-Antoinette', 'also', 'pre-shadowed', 'Diana', 'hounding', 'paparazzi', 'was', 'first', 'monarch', 'fall', 'victim', 'printing', 'press', 'hated', 'Austrian', 'Queen', 'France', 'was', 'subject', 'unrelenting', 'savgage', 'attack', 'slanderous', 'articles', 'broadsides', 'vicious', 'cartoons', 'problems', 'France', 'time', 'were', 'said', 'be', 'instigated', 'was', 'accused', 'crime', 'sin', 'book', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'point', 'was', 'such', 'more', 'real', 'story', 'ill-fated', 'woman.An', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'B', 'W', 'film', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'even', 'historic', 'inaccuracies', 'romanticisms', 'hit', 'truer', 'mark', 'Coppola', 'nonsense', 'Actress', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'ranging', 'fifteen', 'thirty-seven', 'course', 'never', 'really', 'physically', 'age', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'box', 'office', 'no-no', 'conveyed', 'age', 'progression', 'art', 'one', 'scene', 'timeless', 'moment', 'acting', 'brilliance', 'captured', 'picture', 'scene', 'following', 'King', 'execution', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'who', 'time', 'had', 'developed', 'solid', 'marriage', 'deep', 'friendship', 'Louis', 'alone', 'dingy', 'cell', 'son', 'daughter', 'revolutionists', 'barge', 'order', 'permanently', 'remove', 'boy', 'mother', 'care', 'go', 'take', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'screaming', 'almost', 'snarling', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'take', 'son', 'authenticity', 'performance', 'one', 'moment', 'revelation', 'real', 'acting', 'one', 'B', 'W', 'scene', 'typical', '1930', 'Hollywood', 'costume', 'drama', 'rose', 'level', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'dust.Marie', 'AntoinetteMarie', 'Antoinette', 'Film', 'David', 'GrubinMarie', 'Antoinette', 'Scapegoat', 'QueenThe', 'DuchessMarie', 'Antoinette', 'JourneyA', 'Tale', 'Two', 'CitiesA', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', '1935', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'Literary', 'Masterpieces', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'Penguin', 'Classics']",N/A

Morley was the perfect choice for the unsure, bumbling Louis XVI. The Du Barry was also played well, but Norma Shear of course is  the runaway star of the movie. Norma plays an exquisette Queen. Thank  Goodness the infamous 'let them eat cake' was not included. Marie  Antoinette never said that, it was hateful propaganda used against the  Queen at that time. Hollywood did stay true to her story for the most part.  However, even more tragic than her final trip to the guillotine, was her  ill-fated escape attempt. This was portrayed to best accounts in the movie  for the time, but I believe maybe a more modern version of the movie could  show it better. Axel however NEVER came to see her in her last holding  cell. It is said he was trying until the end to come up with another escape  plan, but it never panned out. Marie Antoinette spent her last evening  writing a long letter to her sister that was never delivered. The only  comfort she had was from a young servant girl who fed her and helped her  dress. Some other points left out of the movie were Marie Antoinette's  desperate correspondance to escape France. Her brother, Joseph II, ruler of  Prussia at the time couldn't help, and Catherine the Great refused to help.  The morning of her execution, MArie Antoinette was terrified. When the  guards came for her, one was carrying a large pair of scissors. She thought  she was to be murdered where she stood. Instead, they brutally hacked off  all her hair with the dull blades. And finally sadly, Marie Antoinette was  executed close to lunch time. Her body was thrown in the street with her  head thrown between her legs, and there it lay for hours. Perhaps these  scenes were too intense for 1938. In case anyone is interested, her  youngest son, the Dauphin, who would later be known as Louis XVII died a  lonely death in a prison two years later. He died alone and uncared for.  The most touching part of the film was the royal family's last supper  together in the tower, perhaps it was touched up and romanticized for  Hollywood purposes, but I'd like to think it happened that way.",5,Even the Hollywood version couldn't ruin this movie,946339200,"12 28, 1999",1999,2195,"['student', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'time', 'again', 'Morley', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'unsure', 'bumbling', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Du', 'Barry', 'was', 'also', 'played', 'well', 'Norma', 'Shear', 'course', 'runaway', 'star', 'movie', 'Norma', 'exquisette', 'Queen', 'Thank', 'Goodness', 'infamous', 'eat', 'cake', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'never', 'said', 'was', 'hateful', 'propaganda', 'used', 'Queen', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'stay', 'true', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'even', 'more', 'tragic', 'final', 'trip', 'guillotine', 'was', 'ill-fated', 'escape', 'attempt', 'was', 'portrayed', 'best', 'accounts', 'movie', 'time', 'believe', 'maybe', 'more', 'modern', 'version', 'movie', 'could', 'show', 'better', 'Axel', 'however', 'NEVER', 'came', 'see', 'last', 'holding', 'cell', 'said', 'was', 'trying', 'end', 'come', 'up', 'escape', 'plan', 'never', 'panned', 'out', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'spent', 'last', 'evening', 'writing', 'long', 'letter', 'sister', 'was', 'never', 'delivered', 'only', 'comfort', 'had', 'was', 'young', 'servant', 'girl', 'who', 'fed', 'helped', 'dress', 'other', 'points', 'left', 'movie', 'were', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'desperate', 'correspondance', 'escape', 'France', 'brother', 'Joseph', 'II', 'ruler', 'Prussia', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'refused', 'help', 'morning', 'execution', 'MArie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'terrified', 'When', 'guards', 'came', 'one', 'was', 'carrying', 'large', 'pair', 'scissors', 'thought', 'was', 'be', 'murdered', 'where', 'stood', 'Instead', 'brutally', 'hacked', 'off', 'hair', 'dull', 'blades', 'finally', 'sadly', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'executed', 'close', 'lunch', 'time', 'body', 'was', 'thrown', 'street', 'head', 'thrown', 'legs', 'lay', 'hours', 'Perhaps', 'scenes', 'were', 'too', 'intense', '1938', 'case', 'anyone', 'interested', 'youngest', 'son', 'Dauphin', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'known', 'Louis', 'XVII', 'died', 'lonely', 'death', 'prison', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'died', 'alone', 'uncared', 'most', 'touching', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'royal', 'family', 'last', 'supper', 'together', 'tower', 'perhaps', 'was', 'touched', 'up', 'romanticized', 'Hollywood', 'purposes', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'happened', 'way']",N/A

284589,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6301973437,Kevin Killian,"[8, 9]","They say that shortly we will have a remake of this old story, from the young director Sofia Coppola, starring the American actress Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette.  Coppola failed to land Alain Delon to play Louis XV, so instead we will be stuck with Rip Torn in the part, and Jason Schwartzman (Sofia's cousin) as Louis XVI.  Asia Argento, Marianne Faithfull, Judy Davis and Steve Coogan are also wedged into the movie somehow, all of them playing French parts.  No wonder Delon backed out.  And people thought Thalberg's casting frivolous.  Well, Sofia Coppola has plenty of talent and I have no doubt that her version of MARIE ANTOINETTE will be an intriguing film, but in the meantime we have the 1938 version to tide us over.People say Norma Shearer is miscast and far too old to play the teenage queen.  Was it vanity that led her to accept roles in this and in ROMEO AND JULIET, roles that were for very young actresses?  She had, after all, already been a star for 15 years and she was at the very top of her game as an actress.  Gossips claimed that an early form of botox, injected into her face to stem wrinkles, was responsible for a severe shrinkage in her range of expressions.  And yet when all is said and done she is incomparably glamorous as Marie Antoinette, and we can see why people loved her, though the mob's hatred of her is left unexplained in the screenplay.  Married to Robert Morley, anyone would look pretty, but Shearer is exquisite (though not sixteen).She meets her match as MGM borrowed Fox's top leading male star, Tyrone Power, to play her love interest.  Was Robert Taylor unavailable?  Power just sails through the picture without much interest, he must have known that Van Dyke (and the MGM brass) were tilting the movie towards Shearer, building up sympathy for her while treading a delicate balance between showing what a monster her husband was and yet not treating adultery as something to to condoned.  For Tyrone Power, it must have been a frustrating role, and yet when he's ""on,"" he's really on, and in some scenes he and Norma Shearer look like two angels from another, more beautiful planet, one in which both light and darkness are rewarded with honor.  William Daniels, the chief cinematographer in this vast production, deserves all the accolades he received.  He makes the French court a splendid place, equal parts courtesy and chic.The late Ruth Hussey pops up as the very young Duchess de Polignac--was this Hussey's first part?  She isn't in the credits, but all who love her can recognize that aristocratic, affable smile a mile away.  She had the pale complexion and the deep set dark eyes that dreams are made of and, although never a top star, she was always a welcome presence in the 3,000 MGM movies she graced.  2005 is a sad year, we have lost so many terrific actors, including Ruth Hussey.",5,Darkness And Light,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2858,"['say', 'shortly', 'will', 'have', 'remake', 'old', 'story', 'young', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'starring', 'American', 'actress', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Coppola', 'failed', 'land', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'play', 'Louis', 'XV', 'so', 'instead', 'will', 'be', 'stuck', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'part', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Sofia', 'cousin', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'Marianne', 'Faithfull', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'are', 'also', 'wedged', 'movie', 'somehow', 'playing', 'French', 'parts', 'wonder', 'Delon', 'backed', 'out', 'people', 'thought', 'Thalberg', 'casting', 'frivolous', 'Well', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'plenty', 'talent', 'have', 'doubt', 'version', 'MARIE', 'ANTOINETTE', 'will', 'be', 'intriguing', 'film', 'meantime', 'have', '1938', 'version', 'tide', 'over.People', 'say', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'miscast', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'teenage', 'queen', 'Was', 'vanity', 'led', 'accept', 'roles', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'actresses', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'star', '15', 'years', 'was', 'very', 'top', 'game', 'actress', 'Gossips', 'claimed', 'early', 'form', 'botox', 'injected', 'face', 'stem', 'wrinkles', 'was', 'responsible', 'severe', 'shrinkage', 'range', 'expressions', 'yet', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'incomparably', 'glamorous', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'loved', 'mob', 'hatred', 'left', 'unexplained', 'screenplay', 'Married', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'anyone', 'would', 'look', 'pretty', 'Shearer', 'exquisite', 'not', 'sixteen', '.She', 'match', 'MGM', 'borrowed', 'Fox', 'top', 'leading', 'male', 'star', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'Was', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'unavailable', 'Power', 'just', 'picture', 'much', 'interest', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'MGM', 'brass', 'were', 'tilting', 'movie', 'towards', 'Shearer', 'building', 'up', 'sympathy', 'while', 'treading', 'delicate', 'balance', 'showing', 'what', 'monster', 'husband', 'was', 'yet', 'not', 'treating', 'adultery', 'something', 'condoned', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'frustrating', 'role', 'yet', 'when', 'really', 'scenes', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'look', 'two', 'angels', 'more', 'beautiful', 'planet', 'one', 'light', 'darkness', 'are', 'rewarded', 'honor', 'William', 'Daniels', 'chief', 'cinematographer', 'vast', 'production', 'accolades', 'received', 'French', 'court', 'splendid', 'place', 'equal', 'parts', 'courtesy', 'chic.The', 'late', 'Ruth', 'Hussey', 'up', 'very', 'young', 'Duchess', 'de', 'Polignac', 'was', 'Hussey', 'first', 'part', ""n't"", 'credits', 'who', 'love', 'can', 'recognize', 'aristocratic', 'affable', 'smile', 'mile', 'away', 'had', 'pale', 'complexion', 'deep', 'set', 'dark', 'eyes', 'dreams', 'are', 'made', 'never', 'top', 'star', 'was', 'always', 'welcome', 'presence', '3,000', 'MGM', 'movies', 'graced', '2005', 'sad', 'year', 'have', 'lost', 'so', 'many', 'terrific', 'actors', 'including', 'Ruth', 'Hussey']",N/A
284590,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6301973437,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","Since the Amazon editorial review for this item has, in large part,  quoted my review of the VHS edition of this film without attribution, I have decided to post that review in its entirety for this item.This 1938 production of the life of Marie Antoinette is lavish and sumptuous with exquisite costumes. Norma Shearer is luminous in the role of Marie Antoinette, while Robert Morley, in his acting debut, is perfectly cast as the hapless and ineffectual Louis XVI. While not historically accurate and a bit of license is taken in detailing the life of Marie Antoinette, it is, nonetheless, an immensely entertaining, opulent and lush, historical drama. It shows how a naive Austrian princess came to power as the Queen of France. It details her hopes and dreams and shows how reality made them come crashing down upon her.When Marie Antoinette's mother, Austrian Empress Marie Theresa, arranges a marriage with the Dauphin of France, Marie Antoinette is elated. When she arrives in France and meets her betrothed, the unprepossessing Dauphin, Louis XVI, she is disappointed. Still, she tries to make the best of it, only to discover that her husband is unable or unwilling to consummate their marriage. Gulled by her husband's nefarious cousin, Duke Phillipe d'Orleans (John Shildkraut), she becomes a regular party girl, going to glittering balls and behaving in a way unseemly for a future Queen of France. Spending lavishly, she gives no thought to money, antagonizing her future subjects. It is during one of her sojourns that she meets the Count Axel De Fersen (Tyrone Power), the love of her life.Shortly after, she angers King Louis XV (John Barrymore) by publicly insulting his paramour, the infamous Madame DuBarry (Alice George), and he threatens to have her marriage to the Dauphin annulled. The Dauphin, however, makes it clear to the King, his grandfather, just how much Marie Antoinette means to him, and there is no further talk of annulment. Shortly thereafter, the King dies of smallpox, and Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette become the King and Queen of France.With the new King's sexual dysfunction apparently cured, the royal couple begin having children, first a daughter and then a son. Their cousin and now enemy, the Duke d'Orleans, a political intriguer of the first order, is busy stirring up the rabble into a mob frenzy, as an economic downturn leaves France vulnerable to political unrest. As the unrest grows into revolution, the Queen's past as a profligate party girl, as well as a scandal over a fraudulently purloined diamond necklace, come back to haunt her, and she finds herself reviled by her subjects. The King, too, comes under the scrutiny of the mob and found wanting by his no longer loyal subjects. Once France is in the throes of revolution all is lost, and the royal family finds themselves under house arrest. Still, a daring escape is attempted, only to end tragically. The rest is history.Norma Shearer makes an exquisite Marie Antoinette and portrays her sympathetically. Robert Morley makes a remarkable acting debut as Louis XVI, the King who would rather have been a locksmith. Joseph Shildkraut is divine as the unctiously sinister Duke d'Orleans, and John Barrymore is excellent as Louis XV, the King who is clearly exasperated with his grandson, the Dauphin. Alice George gives a crisp performance as the miffed Madame DuBarry. Last, but certainly not least, the gloriously handsome Tyrone Power gives a tender performance as the faithful and loving Count Axel De Fersen. Of all the roles, his, along with that of the Duke d'Orleans, are the roles that deviate the most historically.

Now I've seen the Sophia Coppola version and know more about Marie Antoinette's history.  This movie is good and pretty accurate in many ways!  I thought the Tyrone Power romance was a bit exaggerated and the weakest part of the movie.  Norma Shearer and Robert Morley are really good and very engaging.  The love between them is more believable and moving.  There is a lot of sympathy for the rulers and I think that is accurate.  Louis XIV just wasn't up to the job of ruling and it is was a very volatile time.  The government was an absolute monarchy and it had no give.  The system of governance that had existed for a hundred or more years left a large group of people who lived off the taxes of others.

Louis lacks self-confidence and is completely dominated by his grandfather, King Louis XV... He also is ridiculed by his cunning cousin, the Duke of Orl&eacute;ans (Joseph Schildkraut) and the king's mistress, Madame Du Barry (Gladys George).On her wedding night, Marie Antoinette is left confused and tearful by Louis, who admits he is incapable of being a husband... She soon becomes a hopeless forsaken figure at Versailles...Denied the love of a husband and the counsel of trusted friends, Marie Antoinette becomes a pawn in the hands of the dishonest Duke of Orl&eacute;ans - cousin of Louis - who plays her against Du Barry: ""Conquer Paris"", he said, ""and you will conquer Madame Du Barry.""Left into the companionship of a small circle of frivolous court favorites, Marie Antoinette becomes the most lavishly dressed woman in France, losing fortunes at the gambling tables... There she meets a Swedish nobleman with whom she falls in love, the attractive Count Axel de Fersen (Tyrone Power).When the alliance with Austria is threatened, Marie Antoinette is persuaded by Count de Mercey (Henry Stephenson), her mother's clever ambassador, to give a ball at which she can in public recognize Madame Du Barry... Instead, her insulting manner toward the mistress of the king enrages Louis XV who informs her that he is annulling her marriage and he is sending her back to Austria...Marie Antoinette goes to the Count de Mercey for help, where she meets there Axel de Fersen who reaffirm his love for her...The sudden death of Louis XV places her husband on the throne and Marie Antoinette finds herself Queen of France... Fersen, realizing that he could not dare to love a queen, leaves her that night and sails for America...Marie Antoinette, determined to become a good queen bears a son and a daughter... The king (a loving father) had not sufficient strength of character or power of decision to combat the influence of court factions...Marie Antoinette's close associations with the more dissipated members of the court aristocracy prompted her enemies to circulate false and insulting reports of her alleged extramarital affairs... These vilifications culminated in the 'Affair of Diamond Necklace' in which the queen was unjustly accused...Duke of Orl&eacute;ans plots against the throne and becomes a leader in the Revolution... As a result, Marie Antoinette becomes the main target of the popular agitators, and the royal family hostages of the Revolutionary movement...Count Fersen, hearing of Marie Antoinette's danger, goes to her and arranges an escape from Paris...Norma Shearer, billed by M.G.M as ""The First Lady of the Screen"" receives her sixth Oscar nomination for her performance...

But ""the parade of enormous sets and opulent gowns"" does contribute more than simply ""stodginess"".  In fact, for me, the appeal of this film lies in its setting.  Think of the effect of the METROPOLIS (1927) sets on the viewer; but instead of Industrial, we have a Baroque architectural style.  Unfortunately, the sets are so grandiose, like being in Versailles itself; one forgets to watch the actors. This competition for attention between the actors and their setting results in the actors playing a more minor part of the film; until the prison scenes; and that should not have been.Relative to the other actors, the excellent performances by Joseph Schildkraut and Robert Morley stand out.  This may be due to their acting style; their roles are played in ""larger than life"" fashion, and are therefore best able to compete with the setting:  John Barrymore is hardly in the picture,  Tyrone Power is woodenly handsome, Norma Shearer is fine.

Her excitement soon turns to dispair when she realizes that her new husband is the joke of the family with the inability to produce an heir. After years of solitude, she begins to enjoy her wealth by attending parties and galavanting with the royal family. Unfortunately, she puts her trust into the wrong people including those with a thirst for her power. Slowly, the people of France begin to act on their unrest and soon Marie Antoinette is void of a throne and in fear for her life.Shearer seemed destined to play this role, and it is one of the films she is best remembered for. There is no doubt that her connections with studio head Irving Thalberg who was also her husband held some sway over her getting the part, but no one can say she was not talented enough to play it. She is radiant in the beginning of the film when the idea of being a queen is exciting and romantic. She changes over the course of two and a half hours as she learns just what it means to be royalty until she is a shadow of her former self, withered and broken. All of the other cast members pale in comparison to her including the highly praised John Barrymore who plays Louis XV.Historically, this film is not quite accurate, although Morley's simple performance is somewhat true to Louis XVI. By this time, the artistocracy had been intermarrying for quite some time, so Louis XVI's genes showed the effects of inbreeding, including impotence. In truth, Marie Antoinette was a bit of a half-wit herself who had no sense of responsibility to her people and who spent her days playing peasant in a reconstructed village.

284600,A2G935GMRAUIRW,6301973437,Sandy McLendon,"[10, 11]","Most of today's old movie buffs know Norma Shearer only from her solid performance as Mary Haines in &quot;The Women&quot;.  That's too bad; Norma was a fine actress with quite a range.  1938's &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;  was her biggest, most lavish movie ever; it had been planned for her by her  late husband, Irving G. Thalberg (head of production at M-G-M) five years  before shooting started.Giving Norma the chance to play  Marie-Antoinette was not just a concession from a powerful studio executive  to an ambitious actress wife; Shearer was born to play the part.  Her  patrician looks and manner serve her well here- the illusion that she IS  Marie-Antoinette is virtually perfect.  M-G-M lavished a lot of time, care  and money on this project; the costumes are so lavish that a corps of  embroidery specialists had to be brought in from Mexico just for this one  movie.  Norma worked like a demon to carry off the part; a costume ball  sequence has her running through a crowd with seemingly effortless ease in  a costume known to have weighed eighty pounds- over two-thirds of Shearer's  body weight.The recreation of Versailles is fairly good; the entrance to  the Royal apartments is duplicated faithfully.  Other rooms are more  fiction than fact, and the exteriors of the chateau suffer from too much  trick photography.  Nothing about M-G-M's version of Versailles can be  faulted for sheer lavishness, though.&quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; was  presented to 1938 audiences as historical fact; the truth is a little  different.  There is a great deal of history in the film, often quite  accurate.  There are, however, details that were invented or enhanced to  make the story more palatable.  Count Fersen never visited the Queen in the  Conciergerie; various details of the doomed escape to Varennes are untrue,  as well.  The &quot;Affair of the Necklace&quot; suffers from censorship;  the &quot;Prince de Rohan&quot; was actually the CARDINAL de Rohan; Louis  had this prince of the Church arrested for his part in the scam. It was an  enormous scandal at the time, but M-G-M decided not to offend Catholics,  and changed the detail.  The biggest invention of the movie is the extent  of the romance between the Queen and Fersen.  The Stefan Zweig book used as  the basis for the film posits a physical affair between the two on the  basis of two words in Fersen's writings; it seems he spent one unchaperoned  night under her roof.  Zweig was careful not to make too much of this, but  M-G-M decided this was something they could run with.  There's a funny  story behind the writing of this film; acerbic scriptwriter Donald Ogden  Stewart complained that the main difficulty he faced was &quot;explaining  the French Revolution in terms that would not lose audience sympathy for  Norma Shearer.&quot;  In the end, however, Stewart and collaborators  Claudine West and Ernest Vajda managed to do just that.The great  strength of &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; is in its performances.  Norma  Shearer runs an astonishing gamut, from the 14-year-old Archduchess  Toinette to the weary, resigned Queen who rides a butcher's wagon to her  own beheading (Shearer eschewed make-up for this sequence; her resemblance  to the 18th-Century artist Jacques-Louis David's on-the-spot sketch is  astounding).  Robert Morley is perfect as Louis Seize; the man's essential  doltishness is clear.  Tyrone Power does his best with an impossible part;  the screenwriters made Fersen a stock romantic hero.  Gladys George's  portrayal of the DuBarry gets the lady exactly right; her strange  combination of ambition, coarseness, and elegance spring to life.  John  Barrymore's Louis Quinze is a little hammy, but forgivably so; the actual  King was a bit full of himself, too.My favourite part of this movie?  It  has to be when Marie-Antoinette (still the Dauphine at this point in the  story) first meets Count Fersen; she's drawn to him almost immediately, as  she makes clear the instant she gets him alone.  Fersen takes her hand to  kiss it; the Dauphine has other ideas, and unexpectedly pulls him to her  for a kiss.  It's a magic moment, and it's hugely satisfying for any  romantic viewer, whether or not it actually happened.Anyone watching  &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; will be rewarded; the EMOTIONAL truth of the  enormously complicated Queen of France is here, even if Hollywood played  with the facts a bit.  Norma Shearer shows us that Marie-Antoinette was a  woman as well as a Queen; you can't ask more than that of a movie.You  won't be disappointed when you see &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;, and you'll  watch it again and again!",4,An Amazing Actress in an Amazing Movie!,955238400,"04 9, 2000",2000,4653,"['Most', 'today', 'old', 'movie', 'buffs', 'know', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'only', 'solid',

The high level of quality of this long (160 minute) historical pageant is astonishing (it's extreme length is probably why it's rather underrated and rarely shown on televison.) It cost MGM nearly 2 million dollars to film this in 1938 and every cent shows in the magnificent ballrooms, royal chambers,courtrooms and palace halls as well as speaking roles for 152 actors plus thousands of ""extras"". The property department built an incredible 98 sets including a replica of the Grand Ballroom at Versailles - which was several feet longer than the original. Adrian designed 1250 splendiferous gowns and the make-up department sewed genuine human hair into 5,000 wigs! In the title role, Norma Shearer at 38, gave what many to believe her finest performance; her portrayal of Marie, based on the biography by Stefan Zweig, is the perhaps the most sympathetic one since that lovely lady was be-headed over 200 years ago! John Barrymore was personally declining but he still was a powerful actor with presence; he's the dying old Louis XV. Robert Morley is effective as the ineffectual, dim-witted Louis XVI and Joseph Schildkraut is hammy though good as the duplicitous Duke of Orleans. Perhaps Gladys George's interpretation of DuBarry is somewhat lacking - but she's appropriately sharp-tongued!

Historically, it is fairly accurate,based on the bio by Stephen Zweig, a fine book in it's own write! Norman Shearer seems about perfect as the frivolous,histrionic young Austrian princess transported to Paris for an arranged marriage with the future French King, here played by R Morley, maybe a bit too much of a doofus, but still fairly like the historical Louis XVI. The costumes and scenes are all phenomenal, again if only in color! Power as the Swedish count is perfect, and so are the children,shown later in the movies. The scenes of the poor of revolutionary France are fine, if slightly underscored, and the political debates are excellent.

What I can tell you is this:  if my house were on fire, of the over 1100 videos and DVDs therein, this is the one I would rescue.  I first saw MA in 1957 and fell in love with Norma Schearer because of it.  It was the film that defined my standards for films and started my life-long love affair with the movies.  If I were teaching film to students, this would be required viewing because even today, the technical standards remain the finest.  It is the apotheosis of the art of film making and should be cherished just for what it is.  This is a ""prestige"" film from MGM, and this type of film was made to increase the prestige of the studio with little regard for the expense, or concern for return on investment.  They didn't care if it would be popular.  What did happen was film magic, and without computer-generated imagery.  It should also be appreciated for the many-layered delineation of the title role by one of Hollywood's most capable actresses--Norma Schearer, who had been in films almost from their very beginnings.  This is her tour-de-force performance; she IS Marie Antoinette.  I am always amazed that she is more well-known for her role in THE WOMEN, since this is a much more demanding, and riveting endeavor.  Near the end of MAYTIME, John Barrymore says to Jeanette MacDonald, ""Tonight you surpassed even yourself; they are calling it a 'living emotion'"".  And that's what happened here.  It is rare magic to see such delineation of a character by an actor; at the moment I can only recall Vivien Leigh's Scarlett, and Bette Davis' Charlotte Vale (NOW VOYAGER) for being as textured and defined.  Norma worked very hard on this part--she wasn't known as ""queen of the lot"" just because she had been married to Irving Thalberg.  She had to work at overcoming a cast in her left eye, that is never apparent even in her close-ups, and she had to get it right the first time, because Van Dyke (not her choice for director) did not coddle female stars, and was known as ""one-take Van Dyke"".  Of course the concert of artists and technicians contributed their expertise to this period piece too.  Costumer Adrian had been in Europe for 3 years searching for authentic materials for her gowns and even when he did find some, since they were silk, they had rotted on the bolts and had to be rewoven.  (There was no polyester in the 18th century!)  Adrian also refused to use rhinestones on his headpieces and gowns.  When Power sees Schearer standing on the stairs of the gaming house (for the first time), those are real diamonds in her hair and on her gown!  Only a few select seamstresses were trusted in sewing on those diamonds, and in removing them from the dresses when the film was finished--and they were counted both ways.  Such extravangances were not seen again until 1963's CLEOPATRA, when Sharaff made the cloth of gold gown for Elizabeth Taylor, and is unlikely to happen ever again.  This film is a true classic and my definition of a ""classic"" is any film you can watch over and over and it is just as good each time.  Schearer's Antoinette is a magic carpet ride to the 18th century and now you can go there any time you want.",5,A Living Emotion,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,3273,"['are', 'reading', 'reviews', 'assume', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'not', 'purchase', 'film', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'house', 'were', 'fire', 'over', '1100', 'videos', 'DVDs', 'therein', 'one', 'would', 'rescue', 'first', 'saw', 'MA', '1957', 'fell', 'love', 'Norma', 'Schearer', 'was', 'film', 'defined', 'standards', 'films', 'started', 'life-long', 'love', 'affair', 'movies', 'were', 'teaching', 'film', 'students', 'would', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'even', 'today', 'technical', 'standards', 'remain', 'finest', 'apotheosis', 'art', 'film', 'making', 'should', 'be', 'cherished', 'just', 'what', 'prestige', 'film', 'MGM', 'type', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'increase', 'prestige', 'studio', 'little', 'regard', 'expense', 'concern', 'return', 'investment', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'would', 'be', 'popular', 'What', 'did', 'happen', 'was', 'film', 'magic', 'computer-generated', 'imagery', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'appreciated', 'many-layered', 'delineation', 'title', 'role', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'capable', 'actresses', 'Norma', 'Schearer', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'films', 'almost', 'very', 'beginnings', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'am', 'always', 'amazed', 'more', 'well-known', 'role', 'THE', 'WOMEN', 'much', 'more', 'demanding', 'riveting', 'endeavor', 'end', 'MAYTIME', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'Tonight', 'surpassed', 'even', 'are', 'calling', ""'living"", 'emotion', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'rare', 'magic', 'see', 'such', 'delineation', 'character', 'actor', 'moment', 'can', 'only', 'recall', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Scarlett', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Charlotte', 'Vale', 'NOW', 'VOYAGER', 'being', 'textured', 'defined', 'Norma', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'known', 'queen', 'lot', 'just', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'had', 'work', 'overcoming', 'cast', 'left', 'eye', 'never', 'apparent', 'even', 'close-ups', 'had', 'get', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'not', 'choice', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'coddle', 'female', 'stars', 'was', 'known', 'one-take', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'course', 'concert', 'artists', 'technicians', 'contributed', 'expertise', 'period', 'too', 'Costumer', 'Adrian', 'had', 'been', 'Europe', '3', 'years', 'searching', 'authentic', 'materials', 'gowns', 'even', 'when', 'did', 'find', 'were', 'silk', 'had', 'rotted', 'bolts', 'had', 'be', 'rewoven', 'was', 'polyester', '18th', 'century', 'Adrian', 'also', 'refused', 'use', 'rhinestones', 'headpieces', 'gowns', 'When', 'Power', 'Schearer', 'standing', 'stairs', 'gaming', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'real', 'diamonds', 'hair', 'gown', 'Only', 'few', 'select', 'seamstresses', 'were', 'trusted', 'sewing', 'diamonds', 'removing', 'dresses', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'finished', 'were', 'counted', 'ways', 'Such', 'extravangances', 'were', 'not', 'seen', 'again', '1963', 'CLEOPATRA', 'when', 'Sharaff', 'made', 'cloth', 'gold', 'gown', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'unlikely', 'happen', 'ever', 'again', 'film', 'true', 'classic', 'definition', 'classic', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'time', 'Schearer', 'Antoinette', 'magic', 'carpet', 'ride', '18th', 'century', 'now', 'can', 'go', 'there', 'time', 'want']",N/A
284604,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301973437,Simon Davis,"[14, 14]","The 1938 film version of &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; starring Norman Shearer and Tyrone Power is a film I feel that is not appreciated enough by modern audiences. Critics have tended to pass it off as opulent hokum which has not passed the test of time. In my humble opinion however it is a masterpiece and one of my absolute favourite films of all time. It is a stunning example of MGM expertise and atention to detail in every department of filmmaking.Norma Shearer, an MGM movie queen of the 1930's is not really well remembered nowadays but here she gives what I believe is her finest performance. It certainly was her own personal favourite of all her work and was the only film she actually kept a personal copy of in later life. Despite being really too old for the role by 1938 (the film had actually been inpreproduction by her husband, the boy genius Irving Thalberg, since the early 30's and had been slated for Shearer as a starring vechicle since at least 1933) Norma carries off the role of the last tragic Queen of France to perfection. She is in particular excellent in the last half of the story as France starts to move into revolution and Marie Antoinette finds herself toppled from the throne to become a prisoner. She displays the right elements of childish playfullness in the youthful sequences, and progresses beautifully into the more mature tragic years of the character. The final sequences of Marie Antoinette where she is in prison and is finally carted off in a rough old wagon to her execution on the guillotine are very stirring and contain some of the finest work by Norma Shearer on film. It was a brave move by an actress who was normally the epitome of MGM glamour and elegance to allow herself to appear, for the sake of historical accuracy , so dishevelled and haggard looking and she looks amazingly like the images either sketched or painted that we have of Marie Antoinette at the end of her life. Being a real student of Marie Antoinette I can't help but admire everything about Norman Shearer's performance. Certainly the film delivers a largely sympathetic portrayal of Marie Antoinette's character as a young woman thrown into a hopelessly outdated and back biting court circle but I feel, from my reading on this topic that it honestly portrays the issues of the time and the complicated situation that Louis 16th and Marie Antoinette found themselves in. Personally I am amazed that she didn't win the 1938 best Actress Oscar for this wonderful performance.&quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; also is blessed with a supporting cast that only MGM could have assembled for one production in its prime. Tyrone Power portrays Marie Antoinette's supposed Lover Count Axel Fersen and he works beautifully with Shearer in their scenes together. Of course in this instance despite being a hugely popular star in his own right,  he is outclassed by Shearer's performance and the splashy production so much so that Darryl Zanuck after this film refused to ever loan him out to another studio. Robert Morley makes a stunning film debut as Louis 16th and is amazingly accurate in his appearance and performance as the husband of Marie Antoinette. John Barrymore, already in decline also has the small but important role of Louis 15th and his own world weariness is just perfect for the role of the declining old king. Other standouts in the cast are the superb Joseph Schildkraut who delivers some of his best work in the role of the conniving and traitorous Duke d' Orleans. Gladys George also is wonderfully memorable in the role of Madame Du Barry, Louis 15th's mistress. Her scenes with Norma Shearer create a real electricity and despite their confrontation at the grand ball being fictitious, her delivery makes for superb entertainment and gives a good idea of the type of back biting and flattery that went on at the French court.Obviously when dealing with such a sweeping story as the life of the last Queen of France a great deal of detail goes into preparing such a production. The production planning schedule for &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; is staggering in its intricacy, attention to detail, in its research and preparation in everything from sets, costumes, furniture, historical detail and budgeting. Cedric Gibbons, MGM's famed art director, who designed most of the wonderful sets for countless MGM productions over several decades outdid himself on &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; designing a staggering 98  magnificent interiors which recreated , if not accurately at least in character,the interiors of the Palace of Versailles and other assorted locations involved in the story. Edwin B. Willis head of the MGM prop department spent 3 months in France accumulating a huge collection of valuable antique french furniture,tapestries, statues and jewellery to use in the production. A great deal of this would be reused again and again in later productions such as &quot;Ninotchka&quot; and &quot;Blossoms In The Dust&quot;. Max Factor designed 900 wigs for the principal actors alone and Norma Shearer herself had the services of MGM hair stylist Sydney Guilaroff to design her elaborate head dresses so typical of Marie Antoinette's period. The legendary Adrian was employed to work his special magic in the designing of Norma's  breathtakingly magnificent gowns , some of which were based on paintings by Marie Antoinette's favourite court painter Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun. They are sensational in their opulence and detail and one can hardly imagine the real Marie Antoinette enjoying such clothes! The wedding gown used in the film alone was made with over 500 yards of white satin especially obtained from Lyon in France.&quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; is an amazing viewing experience and really illustrates film making as it was in the golden years of Hollywood's heyday. I feel that only MGM could have really done justice to this massive story and have produced here a masterpiece that could never be reproduced today . As a testimony to a bygone era I strongly recommend &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; to you. The VHS print is beautiful and despite being in black and white the look and feel of this production is unsurpassed.",5,Stunning MGM masterpiece,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,6178,"['1938', 'film',

This is one of the few films that screams out for it, but alas it wasn't.  And what a set!  I wish this was out on dvd for there are scenes with so much detail that VHS is just not a good medium for its display.  But alas it isn't (yet).  The print is good but my rented copy was heavily encoded  by Macrovision's copy guard which made the top of the screen constantly flicker between light and dark.  I would not recommend a purchase until a DVD is released.  In the meantime try a rental.Marie Antoinette is a film of its time - 1938.  What this means is that it is, at times, overly melodramatic, especially during the scenes between Norma and Tyrone.  Mr Power is probably the least convincing of this fine cast.  Robert Morely as Louis XVI is good in a role that seems highly stereotyped, but one which garnishes much sympathy.  Norma Shearer really turned on the faucets for this one.  I keep wondering if the tears were painted on her face.  And was she was acting up a storm in this picture to make up for losing that Scarlett part?  But no matter.  What matters is that towards the movie's end I, myself, was almost in tears.The film is highly recommended but NOT the VHS copy.",4,Where's the Cake?,1028246400,"08 2, 2002",2002,1317,"['Having', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'wanted', 'make', 'couple', 'comments.I', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'color', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'screams', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'set', 'wish', 'was', 'out', 'dvd', 'are', 'scenes', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'VHS', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'medium', 'display', ""n't"", 'yet', 'print', 'good', 'rented', 'copy', 'was', 'heavily', 'encoded', 'Macrovision', 'copy', 'guard', 'made', 'top', 'screen', 'constantly', 'light', 'dark', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'released', 'meantime', 'try', 'rental.Marie', 'Antoinette', 'film', 'time', '1938', 'What', 'times', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Norma', 'Tyrone', 'Mr', 'Power', 'probably', 'least', 'convincing', 'fine', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Morely', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'good', 'role', 'highly', 'stereotyped', 'one', 'much', 'sympathy', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'really', 'turned', 'faucets', 'one', 'keep', 'wondering', 'tears', 'were', 'painted', 'face', 'was', 'was', 'acting', 'up', 'storm', 'picture', 'make', 'up', 'losing', 'Scarlett', 'part', 'matter', 'What', 'towards', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'almost', 'tears.The', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'NOT', 'VHS', 'copy']",N/A
284607,A14HHOT9999Z22,6301973437,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[7, 31]","Absolutely abysmal - too long and dull as dishwater. One IMDb comment says, ""They don't make them like this anymore..."" and thank god they don't. A vanity production to end all vanity productions, it is a project that Irving Thalberg was working on when he died - a paean to his wife Norma Shearer. Shearer is just dreadful as France's tragic queen - she is way, way too old, to begin with, just like when she made a travesty of *Romeo and Juliet*. When they show her as a young teenage girl hearing about her impending betrothal to the dauphin of France, she is already so adult and maturely developed, that they evidently have her mother walking on stilts to make Shearer appear smaller. It is a ridiculous device that sets the tone for a great deal more ridiculousness to come. Shearer mysteriously received her sixth (!) Oscar nomination for this performance - though it was undoubtedly a sympathy nomination. As the Dauphine of France, she is neglected by her husband, the future Louis XVI, a bumbling, immature ruler who is the only character in the movie to attract any sympathy. She gives herself over to a life of pleasure-seeking wantonness, but comes off as wanton as apple pie. John Barrymore's turn as Louis XV is too short, and he and his mistress, Mme. Du Barry (Gladys George), provide the only relief in this otherwise plodding script. Shearer plays Marie as if she just a loving wife and mother who got a bum rap. She is always so stilted and mannered that she must have had it written into her contract that she was allowed to get teary-eyed at least a dozen times in each movie - and also be allowed to speak in that annoying tremulous voice while the tears are glistening in her eyes. Worse yet, she always seems at a loss as to what to do with her hands, and resorts to silent-movie techniques that were long out-of-date in 1938. Joseph Schildkraut, as the Duke of Orleans, is fabulous - wicked and arch, and with more makeup than any lady at court. It is his maneuvering that introduces the young Dauphine to the pleasures of Parisian high society, and sets off the chain of tragic events that ends with her beheading. As the story waves goodbye to historical accuracy, we see Shearer utilize all three of her expressions - the are the same ones she used in everything from *Her Cardboard Lover* to *The Women*. But her limited range of expressions is almost, but not quite, overshadowed by her voluminous, cloud-like hairstyles. From beginning to end, her wigs are awe-inspiring creations - even when she's on death row. She's obviously the only prisoner in history who was allowed to have her hairdresser in every morning - surely the director is not having us believe Marie created those enormous coifs herself. But when they try and make her look weary and ready for the guillotine, we do not get to see the Queen with her head shorn - instead, we get Shearer in a ratty wig, looking more like Cloris Leachman than Marie Antoinette. The gowns by Adrian are so magnificently over-the-top, and he has a field day costuming both Marie and, in contrast, Mme. Du Barry - at their big showdown, Du Barry is exquisite in black velvet dripping with jewels, while Marie wears what can only be described as Symphony in White Tulle. The production values are the stars of this movie - Hollywood magic at its finest - but watching Norma Shearer as Marie Antoinette is like ordering a bottle of fine wine in a restaurant, and getting a pitcher of Kool-Aid instead.",2,Like Ordering Fine Wine And Getting Kool-Aid Instead,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3478,"['Absolutely', 'abysmal', 'too', 'long', 'dull', 'dishwater', 'One', 'IMDb', 'comment', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'thank', 'god', 'do', ""n't"", 'vanity', 'production', 'end', 'vanity', 'productions', 'project', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'was', 'working', 'when', 'died', 'paean', 'wife', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Shearer', 'just', 'dreadful', 'France', 'tragic', 'queen', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'begin', 'just', 'when', 'made', 'travesty', '*Romeo', 'Juliet*', 'When', 'show', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'hearing', 'impending', 'betrothal', 'dauphin', 'France', 'already', 'so', 'adult', 'maturely', 'developed', 'evidently', 'have', 'mother', 'walking', 'stilts', 'make', 'Shearer', 'appear', 'smaller', 'ridiculous', 'device', 'tone', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'ridiculousness', 'come', 'Shearer', 'mysteriously', 'received', 'sixth', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'sympathy', 'nomination', 'Dauphine', 'France', 'neglected', 'husband', 'future', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'bumbling', 'immature', 'ruler', 'who', 'only', 'character', 'movie', 'attract', 'sympathy', 'life', 'pleasure-seeking', 'wantonness', 'off', 'as', 'wanton', 'apple', 'pie', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'turn', 'Louis', 'XV', 'too', 'short', 'mistress', 'Mme', 'Du', 'Barry', 'Gladys', 'George', 'provide', 'only', 'relief', 'otherwise', 'plodding', 'script', 'Shearer', 'Marie', 'just', 'loving', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'got', 'bum', 'rap', 'always', 'so', 'stilted', 'mannered', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'written', 'contract', 'was', 'allowed', 'get', 'teary-eyed', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'movie', 'also', 'be', 'allowed', 'speak', 'annoying', 'tremulous', 'voice', 'tears', 'are', 'glistening', 'eyes', 'Worse', 'yet', 'always', 'loss', 'what', 'do', 'hands', 'resorts', 'silent-movie', 'techniques', 'were', 'long', 'out-of-date', '1938', 'Joseph', 'Schildkraut', 'Duke', 'Orleans', 'fabulous', 'wicked', 'arch', 'more', 'makeup', 'lady', 'court', 'maneuvering', 'young', 'Dauphine', 'pleasures', 'Parisian', 'high', 'society', 'sets', 'off', 'chain', 'tragic', 'events', 'beheading', 'story', 'goodbye', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'see', 'Shearer', 'utilize', 'three', 'expressions', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'used', 'everything', '*Her', 'Cardboard', 'Lover*', '*The', 'Women*', 'limited', 'range', 'expressions', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'overshadowed', 'voluminous', 'cloud-like', 'hairstyles', 'beginning', 'end', 'wigs', 'are', 'awe-inspiring', 'creations', 'even', 'when', 'death', 'row', 'obviously', 'only', 'prisoner', 'history', 'who', 'was', 'allowed', 'have', 'hairdresser', 'morning', 'surely', 'director', 'not', 'having', 'believe', 'Marie', 'created', 'enormous', 'coifs', 'when', 'try', 'make', 'look', 'weary', 'ready', 'guillotine', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'Queen', 'head', 'shorn', 'instead', 'get', 'Shearer', 'ratty', 'wig', 'looking', 'more', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'gowns', 'Adrian', 'are', 'so', 'magnificently', 'over-the-top', 'field', 'day', 'costuming', 'Marie', 'contrast', 'Mme', 'Du', 'Barry', 'big', 'showdown', 'Du', 'Barry', 'exquisite', 'black', 'velvet', 'dripping', 'jewels', 'Marie', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'Symphony', 'White', 'Tulle', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'stars', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'magic', 'finest', 'watching', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'ordering', 'bottle', 'fine', 'wine', 'restaurant', 'getting', 'pitcher', 'Kool-Aid', 'instead']",N/A
