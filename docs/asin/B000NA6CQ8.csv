1055752,A24PTVSZSM8968,B000NA6CQ8,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I'm giving this movie 4 stars because I basically liked it. The positive aspects are an interesting story based on a true story, understandable German (good for students)and a likeable main character. Unfortunately there are a number of aspects that detract a bit from the potential of the movie. The first thing you notice is that there seem to be big gaps or jumps in the movie. It goes from the main character leaving for the war and jumps to him being a POW on a train with no indication of how when or where he was captured. Similar jumps take place frequently. Once the main character escapes from the prison camp, a strange years-long chase starts in which the prison commander pursues him across Russia. I ask myself how in the world one escaped prisoner could be so important as to be pursued for years and how the prison commander has the freedom to chase him halfway across the country. Many of the characters are not developed very well. A number of them seem to come into the story, take part for a while and then depart without being developed. There isn't much development of the survival aspect. After the initial scene when the main character escapes, there are big chronological and geographical jumps that gloss over all the difficulties one would find in trying to survive. Finally, the ending is a bit odd. The main character shows up at his own house almost like an unannounced stalker. However, in spite of all these little things, this is still an interesting story and an interesting movie. If you are looking for a good German movie that you might be able to understand as a non-native speaker, this isn't a bad choice either.",4,Good but...,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,1652,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'basically', 'liked', 'positive', 'aspects', 'are', 'interesting', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'understandable', 'German', 'good', 'students', 'likeable', 'main', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'number', 'aspects', 'detract', 'bit', 'potential', 'movie', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'seem', 'be', 'big', 'gaps', 'jumps', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'leaving', 'war', 'jumps', 'being', 'POW', 'train', 'indication', 'how', 'when', 'where', 'was', 'captured', 'Similar', 'jumps', 'take', 'place', 'frequently', 'main', 'character', 'escapes', 'prison', 'camp', 'strange', 'years-long', 'chase', 'starts', 'prison', 'commander', 'Russia', 'ask', 'how', 'world', 'one', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'important', 'be', 'pursued', 'years', 'how', 'prison', 'commander', 'freedom', 'chase', 'halfway', 'country', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'very', 'well', 'number', 'seem', 'come', 'story', 'take', 'part', 'while', 'then', 'depart', 'being', 'developed', ""n't"", 'much', 'development', 'survival', 'aspect', 'initial', 'scene', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'escapes', 'are', 'big', 'chronological', 'geographical', 'jumps', 'gloss', 'difficulties', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'trying', 'survive', 'Finally', 'ending', 'bit', 'odd', 'main', 'character', 'up', 'own', 'house', 'almost', 'unannounced', 'stalker', 'However', 'spite', 'little', 'things', 'still', 'interesting', 'story', 'interesting', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'German', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'non-native', 'speaker', ""n't"", 'bad', 'choice']",As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me
1055753,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B000NA6CQ8,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[3, 3]","There have been a lot of great movies about incarceration, escape and people defying incredible odds to survive, and this excellent movie based upon true events and the book by Josef Martin Bauer rates among the best in my opinion.I have not (as yet) read the book, and understand that the movie takes some liberties with the story. At face value this was probably essential to add some distraction to what would have otherwise been probably a slow plodding story.This notwithstanding, I found the film to be tense, absorbing and emotional as you follow the character of Clemens Forell through his epic, and amazing journey.The story is essentially straightforward, an enlisted soldier in the German army bids his daughter and wife (expecting their unborn child) farewell at a train station toward the end of World War II, heading for (one assumes) the Russian front.The story moves quickly forward to his arrest and trial, and imprisonment and transfer by train to a Russian Gulag (along with many other German soldiers) for crimes against Mother Russia.He arrives at Cape Dezhnev on the far eastern peninsula of the Asian continent by the Bering Sea, a forced labor camp to mine lead for the Russians.If you want to get a flavor for his mammoth undertaking on foot, I urge you to map this location online.The first half of the movie deals with this, and the brutality and inhuman conditions he and his fellow soldiers face under the guard of the base commander Kamenev, who tells him to forget all chances of ever leaving this wintry hell.The second half of the movie deals with his escape, and 3 year 8,000 mile journey to try and reach Germany and home.It is at times a little slow, but visually stunning, and emotional charged and tense throughout.I read some reviews ask why the viewer should feel sorry for a German soldier after ""What they did to others in the War"" but would ask that you watch this, and see it for what it is. An enlisted man, taken from his family to fight for his country, perhaps blindly, but a million miles removed from the politics and atrocities of his superiors.He could have been wearing a uniform of any nation.Failing to feel for his plight and story for these reasons is a churlish take on humanity.Although you may know how the story ends, it is no worse in the telling, and although the film is in German with subtitles, the movie contains minimal dialogue, and relies on a visual depth of storytelling.Excellent performances all round, not least from Bernhard Bettermann as Forell, and Anatoliy Kotenyov as his relentless pursuer, this is a movie that shows the depth of the human spirit, and a love that drives a man to impossible ends.Release in on an unrated Region 1 DVD.A Blu-Ray release would be nice, currently this is only available in Europe and NOT this film, but the highly popular 376 minute 50's TV serialization seen on German TVTruly excellent movie.

1055754,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000NA6CQ8,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 2]","An entertaining film about Clemens Forell, one of the very few people that manage to successfully escape from the Gulag. A German soldier in World War II, Forell was made prisoner and sentenced after the war to 25 years in a labor camp in the most remote patch of Siberia, near the Bering Strait, north of the Arctic Circle. Amazingly, he not only escaped the camp but made it all the way from there to Iran mostly on foot (if you don't understand why this is an amazing feat, you can look at a map).The film is more sentimental and melodramatic than it should be, but is still a worthy and entertaining movie, even if at more than two and a half hours is a bit long. One of my favorite parts is when after escaping from the camp he joins a couple of gold prospectors (the no-good prospectors seem almost out of a Western) and they sail through a remote uninhabited river that crosses beautiful conifer forests (that part of the movie, though, was apparently filmed not in Siberia but in Belarus). Even though the movie is based on a real story, some scenes shown here are hard to swallow, like the idea that the camp commander in Siberia followed him all the way to the Iranian frontier only to let him go at the international bridge. My guess is that while the main story is true, the filmmakers embellish it quite a lot.Few known actors in the movie (at least to me), though I recognized Andre Hennicke and Michael Mendl, who played Generals Wilhelm Mohnke and Helmuth Wiedling in Downfall. Also, beautiful international model Irina Pantaeva (who is originally a Buryat, a Buddhist ethnic group in Southern Siberia) plays one of the Chuckchis that shelter Forell for some time after he escaped from the camp (another good section of the movie). Hennicke plays a fellow prisoner while Mendl, even though he is a German is one of the camp doctors (why he was allowed that role is never explained).Some viewers might object that the movie shows the Soviet guards brutality toward the German prisoners, while not explaining that the German soldiers during the war probably engaged in far worse atrocities. Up to a point, this is a fair objection. But one should be mindful that a movie dramatizes a part of reality (whether is based in a real incident or not) and is not necessarily a newspaper article trying to cover all points of view.",4,Not flawless and overlong but interesting and entertaining,1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,2337,"['entertaining', 'film', 'Clemens', 'Forell', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'manage', 'successfully', 'escape', 'Gulag', 'German', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Forell', 'was', 'made', 'prisoner', 'sentenced', 'war', '25', 'years', 'labor', 'camp', 'most', 'remote', 'patch', 'Siberia', 'Bering', 'Strait', 'north', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'Amazingly', 'not', 'only', 'escaped', 'camp', 'made', 'way', 'there', 'Iran', 'mostly', 'foot', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'amazing', 'feat', 'can', 'look', 'map', '.The', 'film', 'more', 'sentimental', 'melodramatic', 'should', 'be', 'still', 'worthy', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'bit', 'long', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'when', 'escaping', 'camp', 'couple', 'gold', 'prospectors', 'no-good', 'prospectors', 'seem', 'almost', 'Western', 'sail', 'remote', 'uninhabited', 'river', 'beautiful', 'conifer', 'forests', 'part', 'movie', 'though', 'was', 'apparently', 'filmed', 'not', 'Siberia', 'Belarus', 'Even', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'story', 'scenes', 'shown', 'here', 'are', 'hard', 'swallow', 'idea', 'camp', 'commander', 'Siberia', 'followed', 'way', 'Iranian', 'frontier', 'only', 'let', 'go', 'international', 'bridge', 'guess', 'main', 'story', 'true', 'filmmakers', 'embellish', 'quite', 'lot.Few', 'known', 'actors', 'movie', 'least', 'recognized', 'Andre', 'Hennicke', 'Michael', 'Mendl', 'who', 'played', 'Generals', 'Wilhelm', 'Mohnke', 'Helmuth', 'Wiedling', 'Downfall', 'Also', 'beautiful', 'international', 'model', 'Irina', 'Pantaeva', 'who', 'originally', 'Buryat', 'Buddhist', 'ethnic', 'group', 'Southern', 'Siberia', 'one', 'Chuckchis', 'shelter', 'Forell', 'time', 'escaped', 'camp', 'good', 'section', 'movie', 'Hennicke', 'fellow', 'prisoner', 'Mendl', 'even', 'German', 'one', 'camp', 'doctors', 'why', 'was', 'allowed', 'role', 'never', 'explained', '.Some', 'viewers', 'might', 'object', 'movie', 'Soviet', 'guards', 'brutality', 'German', 'prisoners', 'not', 'explaining', 'German', 'soldiers', 'war', 'probably', 'engaged', 'far', 'worse', 'atrocities', 'point', 'fair', 'objection', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'mindful', 'movie', 'part', 'reality', 'based', 'real', 'incident', 'not', 'not', 'necessarily', 'newspaper', 'article', 'trying', 'cover', 'points', 'view']",As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me

1055757,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B000NA6CQ8,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[101, 110]","This film is the story (based on one man's true experiences) of a German POW who is sent to the far reaches of Siberia in July of 1945.  Says a Soviet officer not long after his arrival at Cape Dezhnev prison, notwithstanding the end of the war:  ""You'll never leave this place.  You're going to be buried here.  All of us.""  & ""this place"" is a lead mine near the Bering Straits that resembles what hell would be if it was characterized by extreme cold as opposed to fire.  Determined to escape and return to his family in Germany our protagonist herein (by the name of Clemens Forell) struggles to survive as fellow prisoners drop dead around him; whether from a bullet to the head for hesitating a moment upon a Red Army officer's instructions, or from simply being worked to death.  The first hour-plus of this albeit long film is thus devoted to the Soviet Gulag aspect of this film---the bitter cold, the harsh landscapes, cruel Stalinist treatment; in sum, all that is the farce of Communism's ""Workers of the World Unite"" claptrap as bodies are treated as animals.Say, how many times have you seen on film any visualizations of a Soviet Gulag/concentration camp?  Take all the time you need, I'll wait as you count the numerous films about Nazi Germany trying to name but one that shows up Stalinism for what it really was; ie., more akin to Nazi Germany than Hollywood would like you to believe.  This is a rather well made film, mind you, but it is also significant for its portrayal of this aspect of Soviet brutality.  The rest of the film concerns the triumph of the human spirit as this German escapes from Soviet Hell and attempts to make it all the way back, over barren rugged land, through Siberian ice, over dangerous rivers, to Germany to see the family who thinks him dead.  Do give it some of your time (well, it's a little more than some, as this film is rather drawn out and a bit long) should you get the chance to view this film.  It's a story worth seeing.

1055758,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000NA6CQ8,Dennis Littrell,"[15, 17]","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a German language film with English subtitles based on the novel by the same name which was based on a true story about a German POW in the aftermath of WWII who escaped a Siberia work camp and made an amazing 8,000-mile trek home to Munich to be reunited with his family.I haven't read the novel, but of course it was a novel and so much of it was made up.  It doesn't matter however, since what counts in a movie is simply the movie itself.  I am always a little put off when the blurbs for a film scream out: ""Based on a true story!""  So what?  Sometimes that's significant and sometimes it isn't.  In this case the fact that there actually existed a German POW who managed such an amazing escape is important.  The exact details of what happened to him would be wonderful to have.  But in lieu of that, we do have this wonderful movie.Bernhard Bettermann stars as Clemens Forell, and he is perfect for the part.  To survive such an epic adventure the person has to be strong of body and strong of will.  Bettermann looks as though he could actually do something like this, except for the fact that he is so tall and pale I suspect he would stand out and be easily identified as a foreigner in those strange lands through which he trekked.  Also a bit not so realistic is the Soviet camp commander who personally chases Forell all the way to the Iranian border (although that resulted in a nice ironic scene on the bridge at the border between Iran and what--I think--is Turkmenistan).  In reality there were probably several Soviet officers who played that part.  And I would also liked to have seen a little more about how he found enough to eat.  And finally it is clear that the last parts of his journey were sped up a bit as though the filmmakers were in a hurry.  But these are small quibbles.I don't know if this ""coloration"" (as I will call it) was in the book, but what director Harvey Martins does is make the tall and ""Aryan"" Forell experience some of the same horrors that the Jews experienced.  In the beginning he is in a cattle car and nearly starved to death as he is taken to the Siberian lead mines.  He is in rags and nearly frozen and gets kicked around by sadistic soldiers.  If you saw just this part of the movie you would swear it was about the Jews being sent to a concentration camp.  In the camp after Forell is caught in an early escape attempt he is shown being beaten by his fellow soldiers, who of course, were punished because he tried to escape.  This was exactly the sort of thing the Nazis did in the occupied countries during WWII--if a single German was killed, that killing would be revenged many times over.  Later, one of the people who helped Forell is a Jew who lost relatives to the Nazis.  Nonetheless he helps Forell, and in doing so demonstrates not only a superior morality, but the kind of courage that is rare.  And why did he do it?  Because that is the kind of person he is, and that is the kind of persons we all should be.While Forell is a positive, even a heroic figure, and a nice change for Germans who have to endlessly read about and see Germans portrayed in a most negative way throughout their whole lives, the movie itself tends to be neutral politically.The scenes of the snow and the forests and the various places that Forell travels through are nicely done.

1055761,A30B0G0CIOOSQ2,B000NA6CQ8,Erik Gfesser,"[1, 1]","This well executed film was based on the late-1950s work written about Clemens Forrell by Josef M. Bauer. The plot follows the plight of Clemens across thousands of miles of terrain - from his shipment by Soviet forces to a labor camp in Siberia following World War II, through to his eventual escape and return to his wife and daughter several years later. Unlike most films, the German in this piece is seen as the victim, even though he had been in alignment with the German political structure during the war. Up to this point, this reviewer has been engrossed in works about Germans who suffered following the war who had no connection with the German state (see my reviews for ""Bread on My Mother's Table: A Danube Swabian Remembers"" by Ingrid Andor, ""Barefoot in the Rubble"" by Elizabeth B. Walter, and ""A Terrible Revenge, Second Edition, Fully Revised and Updated: The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans"" by Alfred-Maurice de Zayas). But this foreign film takes a different approach, viewing Forrell simply as a human being who was torn from his family, stripped of his dignity, and starved and worked to near death. The story has a happy ending, as Forrell's perseverance to escape his imprisonment is rewarded time and time again, including escape assistance provided to him by a German physician in the work camp, and later a Jewish civilian, in the most uncertain circumstances (and aided throughout his journey by the continued memory of his wife and child, with whom he desperately sought to be reunited). One of the most moving scenes in the movie shows Forrell bowing to say the Lord's Prayer. Some of the scenes are quite painful to watch, especially those showing torture, and the result of subzero temperatures on the human body. The scenes of Forrell travelling through the Siberian wilderness caused this reviewer to ponder the plight of the Donauschwabens in his own immediate family (descendants of Germans who had immigrated to an area that was later Yugoslavia, far removed from the political climate of the time who shared similar fates following the war due to their ethnicity), and as such the stoicism that helped many survive the post-World War II period was not present while watching this film. Be aware that this film is in German with English subtitles. There is very little dialogue, so the subtitles should be bearable for those not used to following print on the screen, and some might be interested in knowing that the German used in the film is so simple that anyone with a little knowledge of the language should understand it.",5,Stoicism not permitted while watching this film,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,2579,"['well', 'executed', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'late-1950s', 'work', 'written', 'Clemens', 'Forrell', 'Josef', 'M.', 'Bauer', 'plot', 'plight', 'Clemens', 'thousands', 'miles', 'terrain', 'shipment', 'Soviet', 'forces', 'labor', 'camp', 'Siberia', 'following', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'eventual', 'escape', 'return', 'wife', 'daughter', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'most', 'films', 'German', 'piece', 'seen', 'victim', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'alignment', 'German', 'political', 'structure', 'war', 'Up', 'point', 'reviewer', 'been', 'engrossed', 'works', 'Germans', 'who', 'suffered', 'following', 'war', 'who', 'had', 'connection', 'German', 'state', 'see', 'reviews', 'Bread', 'My', 'Mother', 'Table', 'Danube', 'Swabian', 'Remembers', 'Ingrid', 'Andor', 'Barefoot', 'Rubble', 'Elizabeth', 'B.', 'Walter', 'A', 'Terrible', 'Revenge', 'Second', 'Edition', 'Fully', 'Revised', 'Updated', 'Ethnic', 'Cleansing', 'East', 'European', 'Germans', 'Alfred-Maurice', 'de', 'Zayas', 'foreign', 'film', 'different', 'approach', 'viewing', 'Forrell', 'simply', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'was', 'torn', 'family', 'stripped', 'dignity', 'starved', 'worked', 'death', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'Forrell', 'perseverance', 'escape', 'imprisonment', 'rewarded', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'including', 'escape', 'assistance', 'provided', 'German', 'physician', 'work', 'camp', 'later', 'Jewish', 'civilian', 'most', 'uncertain', 'circumstances', 'aided', 'journey', 'continued', 'memory', 'wife', 'child', 'whom', 'desperately', 'sought', 'be', 'reunited', 'One', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Forrell', 'bowing', 'say', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'painful', 'watch', 'especially', 'showing', 'torture', 'result', 'subzero', 'temperatures', 'human', 'body', 'scenes', 'Forrell', 'travelling', 'Siberian', 'wilderness', 'caused', 'reviewer', 'ponder', 'plight', 'Donauschwabens', 'own', 'immediate', 'family', 'descendants', 'Germans', 'who', 'had', 'immigrated', 'area', 'was', 'later', 'Yugoslavia', 'far', 'removed', 'political', 'climate', 'time', 'who', 'shared', 'similar', 'fates', 'following', 'war', 'due', 'ethnicity', 'such', 'stoicism', 'helped', 'many', 'survive', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'period', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'watching', 'film', 'Be', 'aware', 'film', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'subtitles', 'should', 'be', 'bearable', 'not', 'used', 'following', 'print', 'screen', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'German', 'used', 'film', 'so', 'simple', 'anyone', 'little', 'knowledge', 'language', 'should', 'understand']",As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me
1055762,A2NOSVWQTG2ZE4,B000NA6CQ8,"Extraordinary Gent. ""&#34;callous socio-path&...","[0, 1]","Having watched this DVD twice I decided to find and buy the book to try to get the answers to some unexplained facets of this remarkable story -- parts of which, as depicted in the film, are simply unbelievable.Most importantly I wanted to understand, how 'Forell' (the name used to disguise the true identity of the subject of the film and book) got from the point where he left the train carrying him east into Siberia to Cape Dezhenev.From my personal knowledge of the Trans-Siberian Railway (and the BAM Railway, constructed well AFTER the events depicted,) the nearest railroad siding would be SEVERAL THOUSAND, perhaps FIVE THOUSAND, KILOMETRES from the Cape, a near impossible distance for any fit and experienced person to walk in good weather let alone a half starved and freezing prisoner in mid-winter.According to the book, written and published in 1955, his journey after de-training was continued in 'convoy', (that is under strict regime by brutal guards hell bent on weeding out those unfit for slave labour at the final destination,) by reindeer drawn sled, each one of which carried twenty prisoners plus guards.This phase of the journey took TEN WEEKS and saw the continuing decimation of the original contingent of 3,000 that left Moscow down to just 1,600 by the time they reached their final destination -- almost within site of Alaska.Apart from getting the answer to this intriguing question I found that the epic adventure as related in the book, ghost written for 'Forell' by an author of considerable experience and repute, and who was also a veteran of The Russian Front, bears almost no resemblance to that depicted in the film. Whole incidents shown in the film are not mentioned in 'Forell's' authorised account of his time in the GULAG or in Siberia as a whole. On the other hand many incidents detailed in the written account, which is likely to be more factual, are not shown in the film ---- for which it is all the more a poorer depiction of this epic tale of survival against remarkable odds.I understand that film-makers must be selective about what they can depict in a given amount of time, and that a 'Love Interest' is almost mandatory, but the divergence between the original book, and the cinematic version, from beginning to end, is breathtaking in the extreme.How 'Forell' arrived in Russia in the first place is not as depicted in the film. It seems, according to the book, he got there in a much more interesting fashion. Also the relentless pursuit of 'Forell' by an individual officer of the KGB (MVD) appears to be 'cinematic licence'. No such individual is even hinted at in the book, the only brushes with authorities who might return him to The Cape are very incidental and shortlived.In short the book is MUCH MORE rivetting, entertaining and believable. If the film interested you then the book will leave you SPELLBOUND. !!!!!!!!!!!!! Once started it almost demands to be read to the conclusion without a break. Sadly at the end of it will you probably ask yourself, as I have, why did the film have to be at such variance with the facts as related by ""Forell"" ?????????.Next I must hunt down a copy of the 1950's German TV miniseries which told the story (in 6 parts ?????????) to see how they handled this epic tale.But for the casual viewer a great tale.",4,As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me ---- DVD version.,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,3314,"['Having', 'watched', 'DVD', 'twice', 'decided', 'find', 'buy', 'book', 'try', 'get', 'answers', 'unexplained', 'facets', 'remarkable', 'story', 'parts', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'simply', 'unbelievable.Most', 'importantly', 'wanted', 'understand', 'how', ""'Forell"", 'name', 'used', 'disguise', 'true', 'identity', 'subject', 'film', 'book', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'left', 'train', 'carrying', 'east', 'Siberia', 'Cape', 'Dezhenev.From', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'Trans-Siberian', 'Railway', 'BAM', 'Railway', 'constructed', 'well', 'AFTER', 'events', 'depicted', 'nearest', 'railroad', 'siding', 'would', 'be', 'SEVERAL', 'THOUSAND', 'perhaps', 'FIVE', 'THOUSAND', 'KILOMETRES', 'Cape', 'near', 'impossible', 'distance', 'fit', 'experienced', 'person', 'walk', 'good', 'weather', 'let', 'alone', 'half', 'starved', 'freezing', 'prisoner', 'mid-winter.According', 'book', 'written', 'published', '1955', 'journey', 'de-training', 'was', 'continued', ""'convoy"", 'strict', 'regime', 'brutal', 'guards', 'hell', 'bent', 'weeding', 'out', 'unfit', 'slave', 'labour', 'final', 'destination', 'reindeer', 'drawn', 'sled', 'one', 'carried', 'twenty', 'prisoners', 'guards.This', 'phase', 'journey', 'took', 'TEN', 'WEEKS', 'saw', 'continuing', 'decimation', 'original', 'contingent', '3,000', 'left', 'Moscow', 'just', '1,600', 'time', 'reached', 'final', 'destination', 'almost', 'site', 'Alaska.Apart', 'getting', 'answer', 'intriguing', 'question', 'found', 'epic', 'adventure', 'related', 'book', 'ghost', 'written', ""'Forell"", 'author', 'considerable', 'experience', 'repute', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'veteran', 'Russian', 'Front', 'almost', 'resemblance', 'depicted', 'film', 'Whole', 'incidents', 'shown', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'mentioned', ""'Forell"", 'authorised', 'account', 'time', 'GULAG', 'Siberia', 'whole', 'other', 'hand', 'many', 'incidents', 'detailed', 'written', 'account', 'likely', 'be', 'more', 'factual', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'more', 'poorer', 'depiction', 'epic', 'tale', 'survival', 'remarkable', 'odds.I', 'understand', 'film-makers', 'must', 'be', 'selective', 'what', 'can', 'depict', 'given', 'amount', 'time', ""'Love"", 'Interest', 'almost', 'mandatory', 'divergence', 'original', 'book', 'cinematic', 'version', 'beginning', 'end', 'breathtaking', 'extreme.How', ""'Forell"", 'arrived', 'Russia', 'first', 'place', 'not', 'as', 'depicted', 'film', 'according', 'book', 'got', 'there', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'fashion', 'Also', 'relentless', 'pursuit', ""'Forell"", 'individual', 'officer', 'KGB', 'MVD', 'be', ""'cinematic"", 'licence', 'such', 'individual', 'even', 'hinted', 'book', 'only', 'brushes', 'authorities', 'who', 'might', 'return', 'Cape', 'are', 'very', 'incidental', 'shortlived.In', 'short', 'book', 'MUCH', 'MORE', 'rivetting', 'entertaining', 'believable', 'film', 'interested', 'then', 'book', 'will', 'leave', 'SPELLBOUND', 'Once', 'started', 'almost', 'be', 'read', 'conclusion', 'break', 'Sadly', 'end', 'will', 'probably', 'ask', 'have', 'why', 'did', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'such', 'variance', 'facts', 'related', 'Forell', '.Next', 'must', 'hunt', 'down', 'copy', '1950', 'German', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'told', 'story', '6', 'parts', 'see', 'how', 'handled', 'epic', 'tale.But', 'casual', 'viewer', 'great', 'tale']",As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me

1055766,AEJ51LB0XGGY,B000NA6CQ8,"Jaroslav Melgr ""jaroski""","[40, 40]","This is film is based on a true story of a German soldier Clemens Forrell who is sent to the Russian front and taken captive at the end of the war.  He's sent to a labor camp where death seems much more appealing than staying alive.  What keeps him going is the memory of his wife and a promise he made to his daughter that he'd return.  He's able to escape with the help of a German doctor who has stashed away supplies and provisions for his own escape, but when he finds out he's got a cancer he knows he won't make it himself.  He also knows Clemens has the endurance, smarts and toughness to make the journey.  So he gives him the provisions, gun, clothes and everything he stashed away and sends him off on his way.  Clemans takes 3 years and 8000 miles before he makes it to Iran, only to end up in a prison there as a Russian spy.  Luckily he's rescued from there and able to return to Germany to his family who haven't given up hope.Not that I'm a fan of Germany in WWII, but this movie makes you feel some empathy for the German POWs who were hauled off to Siberia to labor camps for the rest of their lives.  Their treatment by Russians is truly deplorable, which is hardly surprising.  First of all, the Germans were ruthless and brutal toward Russian civilians during their initial invasion of USSR.  Besides that the Russians did not treat their own people any better let alone show any respect for their captives.It's a great story and I give it four stars. The thing that made me take a star off the rating is that it is a bit too melodramatic.  More than it needs to be in my opinion.  Specifically, I'm referring to the movie-long chase of the prisoner by the camp commander.  There is no way a prison camp commander would be allowed to travel across Russia to chase after an escaped prisoner.  A commander who had a prisoner escape on his watch would be careful not to report it in order to avoid repercussions.  He'd do a search for him for a while no doubt, given there were any tracks or any way to follow the escapee. But he would not worry about it beyond an initial unsuccessful search assuming the cold, hunger and wolfs would take care of the prisoner sooner or later.  After all, Siberia is a pretty vast country and pretty unforgiving too.  Chances of survival for a lone escapee who knows no local language, has no map or compass would be pretty minimal. Neither were the Russians in the late 40's sophisticated enough to have radios and communication systems in remote areas of the Siberia (native Siberian villages) to receive news about escaped prisoners.  Undoubtedly, these things were added to ""dramatize"" the story and keep the viewer on his toes, but it takes away from the authenticity.  I personally like real life stories told ""as they are"" without any embellishment.

I thought the acting was ""just OK"" and I also felt the film lacked continuity in places.  But, having said that, our whole family really enjoyed the film and I would recommend watching it for the great story, beautiful scenes, and pretty good action.
