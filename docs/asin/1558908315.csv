I urge any potential viewer to cast of any negative vibes. This film is a gem, indeed. It chronicles Lt. Jordan O'Neill (Demi Moore) as a test case in the US Navy for an intensive course and Master Chief John 'Jack' Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) as her main adversary and ironically, her main source of encouragement in my view.Pros: Mortensen! Mortensen! He is so brilliant in this film! He seems very violent but there is something about his character in this film that suggests that he is quite sensitive. You can try and hate him for being a man who hits women but you just can't; he is great.Demi Moore is quite good although I felt that she didn't put in as much effort as Mortensen in terms of how she played her character. Physically she did but emotionally, she lacked the intensity that Mortensen had.There were memorable characters here such as McCool played by a young Morris Chestnut, Pyro played by Kevin Gage and James Caviezel too who played a funny role for once as Slovnik.This film contains a great performance from Anne Bancroft who plays Senator DeHaven, at first Moore's friend than swiftly backstabs her to get what she wants.Cons: I wish the script would have developed more verbal action between Mortensen and Moore.

Some years ago, I inquired about joining the Seals, and the recruiter told me to count on swimming 5 miles to breakfast, and 5 miles from breakfast...daily!!! The Seals are the equivalent to the Army's Green Berets.Getting back to the movie, as soon as she decides to go for it, she quickly learns not everyone is very fond of having a ""woman"" in their corps, and the situation becomes a hot political topic.The movie is filled with intense drama, action, and suspense.

One of them falls and when it does, it rolls over the recruits. That scene made my nose hurt just watching it.In fact, this movie makes you feel like you are watching a documentary.

Apparently, they failed to look deeper than Demi's sinewy physique, and her  character's grim determination to complete the rigorous SEAL training.  Jordan O'Neil, an outstanding Naval Intel specialist and accomplished  triathlete, clearly has all the &quot;right stuff&quot; to become the first  female operator.  But how will she affect team-cohesiveness?  From the  start, she is an outcast, segregated because of her gender.  To gain her  teammates' acceptance, O'Neil must become, not their feminist  &quot;sister&quot;, but a brother-in-arms. This is the theme of the film.  She begins by shaving her head, symbolically shedding her femininity to the  sultry lyrics of the Pretenders &quot;the bitch is gone...&quot;  She bunks  and showers with the guys, and is made team-leader for a brutal SERE  training exercise.  She gamely endures abuse as her Master Chief attempts  to demonstrate to her teammates how her presence could imperil a mission  and their lives.  It is during the simulated rape -- intended to demean her  to the status of female &quot;victim&quot; -- that she fights back  ferociously.  In what has become the defining moment of the film, she  challenges her tormentor with that uniquely masculine vulgarity which draws  cheers from her teammates (and the movie audience).  She has seemingly  successfully transformed herself into a brother warrior, but will her  Master Chief's warnings prove prophetic when her team is deployed?  As he  admits: &quot;She's not the problem.  We are.&quot;  The tighter her bond  with her comrades, ironically the stronger their instinct to  &quot;protect&quot; her.  Can it ever be overcome?

I think it gives pretty good portrayal of what military training is like. Demi Moore does a great job of acting as her character goes through this tough elite military training. Her character shows great determination in her effort to complete the elite training despite the fact that so many people are against her training for this elite military position. Her opponents even include a female senator who pretends to support Moore's character when the senator is really only plotting for her own political gain.

180016,A2198FZZMTJ38H,1558908315,D. Litton,"[14, 20]","If you've ever wondered just how much a performance can carry a movie, then look no further than Ridley Scott's ""G.I. Jane,"" in which a female becomes the first ever to train for the Navy SEALs as a result of a political squabble between government figures. As the title character, actress Demi Moore throws everything she has into the role, and essentially makes it her own. Ignoring the fact that her character is merely a pawn in a political game is easy enough, but there are aspects of the movie not so easily overlooked.The movie begins with a heated battle between aspiring Secretary of the Navy Theodore Hayes (Daniel von Bargen) and Senator Lillian DeHaven (Anne Bancroft). The basis for the argument is quite simple: Hayes believes the Navy's position on women in the armed forces is fitting, while DeHaven pulls out the old feminist attitude and opposes his views. Thus begins their battle, which will rest on the shoulders of one female recruit who, if strong enough to pass the Navy SEALs training procedures, will prove once and for all that women have a place in the military.That's where Moore's character comes in. Moore plays Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil, the intelligence officer called upon by DeHaven to take on the challenge of training. Though hesitant at first, she accepts. When she arrives, she finds that her superior officers are prepared to make changes in procedure due to her gender, and she is despised by almost all of her squad members. Most aggressive is Master Chief Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen), who sees fit to run her into the ground and make an example of her willingness to participate in the training with no special treatment.For its star power, I recommend the movie. Demi Moore, for all her physical build-up for the role, truly embodies the courageous attitudes and ideals held by O'Neil. As with many of her previous roles, Moore has always excelled at playing strong-willed women characters, and this one is no exception; in fact, it's one of her finest roles. There are times when the movie seems to be working with her, and then there are instances when she literally carries the movie on her shoulders, such as her brutal standoff with Urgayle, which contains a priceless line of dialogue on her part.As for the movie itself, it remains serviceable throughout most of its duration. The political subplots that threaten her very existence in the military have a certain sense of logic to them, carrying with them the message that power is everything when it comes to government matters. The unflinching look at the training of the SEALs is hard-hitting and, at times, dramatic enough to sustain interest for long periods.And then the movie seems to be going downhill. A subplot involving O'Neil's boyfriend threatens to cast him in a bad light when he agrees to keep tabs on her for those who would destroy her credibility, while the revelation that Senator DeHaven was behind her sudden downfall seems contrived and misplaced. The final act of the film, a cliche-driven attempt to give the characters a chance at heroism, feels forced and holds little impact.If you must see ""G.I.

It is too bad that she is not much of an actress, and if she is, she has been hiding behind some rather bad film scripts. The concept here is a bit too unbelievable, with a US Senator (Anne Bancroft, who is excellent in her role) tapping into the voice of her constituency in a bid to try to equalise the playing field between men and women in the military. However, her motives are purely selfish, and when Navy woman Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) signs on to be the test case as the first woman to try to become a Navy Seal, the Senator not only stops backing O'Neil at a pivotal point, she herself sabotages the success O'Neil achieves in her Seal training. Overall you get a view of the grueling nature of the training and also get to see the commander's soft side when you realise at the end that he quotes poetry to the new recruits (although he does so in such a way that you may not realise it is poetry until he gives his copy of DH Lawrence to O'Neil after the most fantasy-laden combat scene has ended, and he ultimately owes his life to O'Neil. Of course, if you were observant, which is it somewhat difficult to do while watching this film, you will catch the commander reading a lot of erudite literature throughout the film.

When Senator Lillian DeHaven (Bancroft) realizes possible political gain in the first female admittance into the Navy SEAL program, O'Neil's name comes up.  It's just a political ploy, however, because nobody expects her to last a week in training that weeds out the strongest and fastest men, let alone women.Upon arrival to training, O'Neil is an outcast, and reminded by condescending remarks from fellow classmates as well as instructors, specifically hard-nosed Command Master Chief John James Urgayle (Mortenson).  CMC Urgayle is a harsh but fair instructor who does not take kindly to O'Neil's presence and the seeming celebrity of her career, believing female integration into front-line combat units potentially weaken a unit.  During one moment when talking to her in the shower, he mentions that he got the Navy Cross for pulling a 250-pound man out of a burning tank.  Therein lies his ambivalence, the problem as he sees it: O'Neil doesn't have the physical capabilities of the elite men in the program (cue foreshadowing).While I was never a tabbed Special Forces soldier, I WAS in a Special Forces unit.  The young look like Olympic athletes, able to tirelessly sprint like track stars and capable of lifting well beyond their bodyweight.  The older guys were often built like gorillas, not as fast as before, but handy when you have a flat tire and no jack stand.  With that said, there is absolutely no way a Navy Seal instructor would beat or faux-rape a trainee; they are highly skilled, highly trained professionals.  The best of the best.  Similarly, there is no way Demi Moore could hack it as a Navy Seal.  Period.  This is not up for debate.  That does not, however, make this movie bad or unenjoyable.

Jordan isn't sure she wants to go through the hassle she knows will result from her presence at the training, but the congresswoman who is behind this encourages Jordan to try her best. Nobody expects Jordan to survive the harsh training program, and Jordan exceeds all expectations.Viggo Mortensen plays the Master Chief who is in charge of the training program. He is quite harsh, as you would expect from someone who is trying to separate the &quot;best of the best&quot; from a group of individuals who are all quite talented. Viggo isn't a mere brute - he reads poetry by D.H. Lawrence and truly cares about his trainees. He knows that if he doesn't do a good job at his training, the men here will die (and cause others to die) when sent out into combat. I understand and applaud all of that. Viggo throughout the film shows a good balance of concern for his trainees, a desire to push them to be their best, and a desire to weed out those simply not cut out to be SEALs.However, being a fan of the military and its task of protecting the weak, I had HUGE issues with the &quot;pivotal scene&quot; in the SERE camp. The movie is directed by Ridley Scott of Alien fame and you would think that this man would have respect for a strong female character and the situations that result. I very much equated Jordan to Ripley, both strong women who held their own and earned respect of those around them. But instead of just having Ripley and the others tied up or left in the sun or other &quot;see if you can resist the concerns of your body&quot;, Ridley decides to have the Master Chief *brutalize* one of the soldiers and then almost rape Jordan. What????If we know ANYTHING about real torture situations, it is that a torturer can eventually break anybody. We all have pain limits. There are always ways to inflict more pain! At some point either our body gives out or our mind snaps. That's why spies carry cyanide capsules, because you can't be &quot;trained&quot; to resist torture indefinitely. So what was the point of beating up on the first soldier? What was the point of almost raping Jordan? To prove she could be raped? Heck, any GUY there could have been raped too. Is it important for them to learn what rape feels like, just in case? Would the guys have been any more or less upset to see one of their fellow GUYS being raped vs a girl? Heck they might be MORE upset to see a fellow guy be raped because that would be even less &quot;acceptable&quot; to them. For Viggo's character to delve to those depths after everything he'd shown us previously was amazingly out of character - or indicated that Viggo was a depraved man who had no business training soldiers.The movie was supposed to show us that women can be just as strong as men are. Heck, real life shows us that. There are plenty of strong female characters in movies - from Ripley in Alien, to Sarah Connor in Terminator 2, and more come out every day. There are plenty of real life female police officers and fire fighters who are depended on by their coworkers every day. It was almost an insult to have the GI Jane character go through what she did, sort of an Archie Bunker situation where you are ashamed that there really are people left out there that think a woman with strength must be a lesbian. While I applaud the movie's intentions to say &quot;hey you remaining bigots out there, it's time to wake up&quot;, to have to involve a supposed rape to make your point is very sad. To have to taint Viggo's character with a sadistic view towards woman (as much as he tries his best to be fair much of the time) is really saying that ALL guys will always have this power/lust attitude towards women that they have to keep under control. Which is entirely unfair to men. It weakens the entire point of the story.For those who are interested, the poem Viggo quotes is titled Self-Pity:I never saw a wild thingsorry for itself.A small bird will drop frozen dead from a boughwithout ever having felt sorry for itself.D. H. LawrenceThe point is that you do what you have to do to get by in life.

On the other hand, if the guys hadn't resented Moore's presence, there wouldn't have been a plot, and Hollywood would have had even less of a movie than it was, and it was pretty thin to begin with.I'm not that big a fan of Demi Moore, but I like Viggo Mortenson despite his being sort of a bad guy for much of the movie, and Ann Bancroft was excellent as the woman Senator.

Well, the first fact you must accept is, physical strength is not what gets you through physical challenges, liked boot camp and hell week. Because it isn't just physical, but mental, and emotional. And since sexist stereotypes about women were brought up about this movie I'm sure, here are some sexist facts about men. Not all men, but most men are not known for being emotionally strong, women are. Most men may have more physcial strength than women, but women have a higher tolerance for pain. I.E. Giving birth. Our bodies are built to endure different physical pain than men. Men can be babies when it comes to pain, emotion, and mental stress. Women tend to mature faster than guys because we grow up differently, as being the sensitive ones, like admitting when we are weak, and growing stronger as opposed to men who challenge themselves arrogantly, and hardly ever admitting to making a mistake. In G.I. gane, when master chief said it takes more than being tough he was right. It's more of a mental challenge when dealing with exhaustion, pain, hunger, and willpower. So it isn't impossible when you see men hitting the bell and quitting and demi moore is still kickin butt. Next, the parts when demi was teased for being a woman, and harassed about her tampons, it just shows you how immature military boys can be. When she first got there, in the cafeteria, the guys were saying ""give me one night with her i'll straighten her out."" She never once cried to her superior officer. She later did, but she took a lot of crap first, and she took it with dignity until she told her superior officer that it all started when he pulled out her chair, when she first came there.

I was thinking that it would be a typical overdone movie about how to make a point about Women, but it came just right. Before you complain, I like movies about strong females, but I just dont like movies trying to stuff your throat with a horrible black and white picture of the Gender Situation. This movie isnt really trying to stuff the viewer full of overdone women rights and portraying the stereotypical ""Men are evil"" picture. This movie is about being respected for who you are, regardless of sex or race. Its about both sides gaining mutual respect for each other, and seeing the good in others no matter the circumstances. Its also about a very strong woman who did everything to show the world that she could.Apart from that, it was a really good movie, no real dead points like many other movies. Having watched a lot of Moore`s movies lately, I still hold her performance in G.I Jane highest. Not only is she stunning to look at, but she is also a really strong character, with a rock solid will to do what she feel is right. Under the course of the movie she goes head to head against the apparently inhuman Master Chief(Excellent played by Viggo Mortensen), and the selfish Senator. Naturally things go bump in the night, and things happen that in the end causes you to either smile or cry, or both.Its a really touching movie, and it became one of my favorite movies, and I really adored Demi Moore after her role in this movie.Ridley Scott, producer of Thelma & Louise, 1492 Conquest of Paradise, Black Hawk Down and more, really shines in this excellent Military Movie.  The Scenery and Photographing is sharp and at the same time, dirty and edgy. Really High Quality on both Picture and Sound, and an overall pleasant movie experience.A Minor Warning, please leave any logics outside the door. This movie is ment to be enjoyed for what it is, not to be broken down and critized to death. In the End, this movie gives you that really good feeling, and that`s what counts.

I just cannot help being intoxicated with Master Chief John Urgayle's super cool facade with passion of a poet. @Although he looks ferocious when he attacks Demi fs Lt.

That scene gave me refreshing sensation. I think Demi Moore did there very fine job, too, doing most of her stunts herself. I am not particularly a big fan of her, but I definitely admire her by that super cool stuff.As Master Chief Urgayle pointed out after having had his nose broken by O fNeil, it was the guys who were really a problem, not the woman, O fNeil, to deal with their own and each other fs sexuality within a very man-oriented world. Still, it may be a very fine line O fNeil has been walking on among the tough guys. After completing all those fierce trainings and getting closer to her male colleagues, when a guy asked bruised O fNeil;  gAre you O.K.? h, which by the way was very sweet of him, but, O fNeil had to dodge men fs eyes by laughing-off remarks;  hGet out of here! h and running into girl fs rest room.

She is a test case, brought in by a female senator who wants to get women in the military. Most men expect her to fail within one week... But they don't know Jordan.G.I. Jane, directed by Ridley Scott, is the best movie about girl power I have ever seen. The movie shows that women can be equal to men. The strongest element in the movie is therefor loud and clear: Demi Moore. She does a fantastic job portraying O'Neil and gives a powerful and strong performance. The way her character fights her way up in the training course of the Navy SEALS is very interesting and great to watch. She faces it all: from sexual issues to teammates who refuse to work with her. But whatever happends, the character keeps going, and thats what I found a very strong element in the film.Viggo Mortensen plays the Master Chief, one of the men who makes her stay a lot tougher. It's interesting to see Mortensen in a totally different role than the friendly Aragorn from the Lord of The Rings. He plays a real mean guy, and acts the part perfectly.Ridley Scott filmed the film in a certain style. This style gives a nice atmosphere but also makes it messy at some points. Some of the action scenes (there aren't that many) are filmed with a shakey zoom in and out camera. Of course it gives the scene a certain feeling, but it leaves some kind of messy impression. So as a whole the film looks a bit messy, but that fact doesn't destroy the enjoyment at all. I was entertained by the film. From the training process to the tense endbattle, it is a great ride. The music is very good and also helps the film considering atmosphere and power. Seeying Demi Moore doing one arm push ups while a great theme is playing gives a great powerboost.So Demi Moore steals the show, she shows that women can be strong and still be beautiful at the same time, I love that about this film.",3,The Ultimate Movie about Girl Power,1173398400,"03 9, 2007",2007,1953,"['G.I', 'Jane', 'movie', 'Jordan', ""O'Neil"", 'first', 'woman', 'be', 'trained', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'test', 'case', 'brought', 'female', 'senator', 'who', 'get', 'women', 'military', 'Most', 'men', 'expect', 'fail', 'one', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jordan.G.I', 'Jane', 'directed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'best', 'movie', 'girl', 'power', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'equal', 'men', 'strongest', 'element', 'movie', 'therefor', 'loud', 'clear', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', ""O'Neil"", 'powerful', 'strong', 'performance', 'way', 'character', 'fights', 'way', 'training', 'course', 'Navy', 'SEALS', 'very', 'interesting', 'great', 'watch', 'sexual', 'issues', 'teammates', 'who', 'refuse', 'work', 'happends', 'character', 'going', 'what', 'found', 'very', 'strong', 'element', 'film.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Master', 'Chief', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'stay', 'lot', 'tougher', 'interesting', 'see', 'Mortensen', 'totally', 'different', 'role', 'friendly', 'Aragorn', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'real', 'mean', 'guy', 'part', 'perfectly.Ridley', 'Scott', 'filmed', 'film', 'certain', 'style', 'style', 'nice', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'messy', 'points', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'are', 'filmed', 'shakey', 'zoom', 'camera', 'course', 'scene', 'certain', 'feeling', 'kind', 'messy', 'impression', 'So', 'whole', 'film', 'bit', 'messy', 'fact', ""n't"", 'destroy', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'entertained', 'film', 'training', 'process', 'tense', 'endbattle', 'great', 'ride', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'film', 'considering', 'atmosphere', 'power', 'Seeying', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'doing', 'one', 'arm', 'push', 'ups', 'great', 'theme', 'playing', 'great', 'powerboost.So', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'show', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'strong', 'still', 'be', 'beautiful', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'film']",N/A
