1496690,A2IKWMHSHKRLGG,B005ONP7VU,Carlos A. Melendez,"[0, 0]","Let me begin by saying that I believe James Purefoy is a great actor. Anything that I see him in I automatically feel the need to watch , now that doesn't necessarily mean that everything he's in is up to his standard as an actor ( that retched series The Following, what a disappointment). But this series was actually good, not great, but it was entertaining.Purefoy plays a lawyer who lives away from big city life after he defended a man of murder that he later finds out is guilty. You see that his character isn't all there, he seems to be seeing things and you come to the realization quite quickly that he has or had some sort of meltdown. He is called upon by a friend to defend him in a murder case, and he reluctantly accepts.His wife is a writer that gives literature classes in a juvenile facility, there she meets a boy with great potential as a writer, and she decides on helping him in his search for a career as an author.There is also a police officer investigating another murder that has a connection with the case that brought Purefoy's character to his breakdown.The series consists of five episodes, each more interesting than the last. You have murder, intrigue, and a mystery. Now why don't I give it 5 stars, you might ask?Well for starters it's all pretty predictable, not all of it but most of it. The coincedances with the wife, police investigation and the juvenile facility are a bit too much for my tastes.But the biggest problem I had with the series was the investigating police officer ( who's a dead ringer for one of the guys in The Pet Shop Boys ) , he is just the least likable character in this. And I know you don't have to like every character in a movie, but it's frustrating when you take away from the action to show us his storyline. He is such a creep that if it has nothing to do with the plot, then I don't care to watch it. Because believe me at the end of the day, it has very little impact on the story, and going threw the torture of watching this ass to have it come to nothing is just inconsiderate on the part of the filmakers.And another thing that bugged me was the incessant use of the scene in the first episode where someone is shot in the head, this scene is shown in every episode after that. In. Every. Episode. At least twice. We get it already. We're not idiots.So if you want to be entertained watch it, it's not rocket science, and you will probably know how it will end, but I still believe it's worth watching for Purefoy alone. Now The Following, that's another story.",4,"Interesting, to a point",1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,2539,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'believe', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'great', 'actor', 'Anything', 'see', 'automatically', 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'now', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'everything', 'up', 'standard', 'actor', 'retched', 'series', 'Following', 'what', 'disappointment', 'series', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'entertaining.Purefoy', 'lawyer', 'who', 'away', 'big', 'city', 'life', 'defended', 'man', 'murder', 'later', 'out', 'guilty', 'see', 'character', ""n't"", 'all', 'there', 'be', 'seeing', 'things', 'come', 'realization', 'quite', 'quickly', 'had', 'sort', 'meltdown', 'called', 'upon', 'friend', 'defend', 'murder', 'case', 'reluctantly', 'accepts.His', 'wife', 'writer', 'literature', 'classes', 'juvenile', 'facility', 'boy', 'great', 'potential', 'writer', 'helping', 'search', 'career', 'author.There', 'also', 'police', 'officer', 'investigating', 'murder', 'connection', 'case', 'brought', 'Purefoy', 'character', 'breakdown.The', 'series', 'five', 'episodes', 'more', 'interesting', 'last', 'have', 'murder', 'intrigue', 'mystery', 'Now', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'might', 'ask', 'Well', 'starters', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'not', 'most', 'coincedances', 'wife', 'police', 'investigation', 'juvenile', 'facility', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'tastes.But', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'series', 'was', 'investigating', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'dead', 'ringer', 'one', 'guys', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'just', 'least', 'likable', 'character', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'character', 'movie', 'frustrating', 'when', 'take', 'away', 'action', 'show', 'storyline', 'such', 'creep', 'nothing', 'do', 'plot', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'watch', 'believe', 'end', 'day', 'very', 'little', 'impact', 'story', 'going', 'threw', 'torture', 'watching', 'ass', 'have', 'come', 'nothing', 'just', 'inconsiderate', 'part', 'filmakers.And', 'thing', 'bugged', 'was', 'incessant', 'use', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'someone', 'shot', 'head', 'scene', 'shown', 'episode', 'Every', 'Episode', 'least', 'twice', 'get', 'already', ""'re"", 'not', 'idiots.So', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'will', 'probably', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'still', 'believe', 'worth', 'watching', 'Purefoy', 'alone', 'Now', 'Following', 'story']",Injustice: Season 1 [Region 2]

1496698,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005ONP7VU,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[81, 82]","To date, James Purefoy has had a wonderful career.  He first came to my attention in 2001's A KNIGHT'S TALE where he made the most out of a secondary role as Colville.  Then, I remember his chewing scenery as Marc Anthony in HBO & the BBC's stellar ""Rome"" series.  Then, I saw him in the US-ignored SOLOMON KANE - a theatrical adaptation of Robert E. Howard's legendary pulp character - and, while I can admit the picture had some nominal flaws, it became clear to me that, if justice were served, Purefoy was destined for some greater things.  Still, he's toiled in relative obscurity; hopefully, INJUSTICE will correct that.William Travers (played by Purefoy) is a barrister who's given up on big-city law after suffering a mental breakdown upon learning that he successfully represented a criminal responsible for a heinous accident.  Instead, he prefers representing petty criminals from his home in rural Suffolk.  However, when a past friend accused of murder asks for his representation personally, Travers begrudgingly agrees ... but what he eventually uncovers will push him to his psychological limits, forcing him to question what he personally believes in.So far as the story is concerned, INJUSTICE is a bit of an anomaly.  It isn't easily classified.  It's one part police procedural, one part legal thriller, and one part character drama.  There are several different storylines revolving around the main plot; yet all of them congeal on the premise of what justice in an unjust world looks like.  Granted, there are elements here which appear to be circumstantial as they're revealed, but, as the investigation unfolds, the audience finds out how interwoven this shared reality of theirs truly is.It's all acted brilliantly by Purefoy and his thematic counterpoint, DI Mark Wenborn (Charlie Creed-Miles).  Creator Anthony Horowitz constructs a massive one-two punch by having two seemingly separate stories collide - Travers conducts his own discovery into his friend's murder charge while Wenborn is drawn closer to the elusive identity of a cruel assassin.  Both leads are hell bent on seeing justice served in whatever form they can achieve, and, it becomes clear that - even though Travers and Wenborn may be curiously complicit in bending the rules - we're supposed to either agree or identify with them at some point.  The audience may not like where their respective method delivers each man, but don't be shocked to realize you may be rooting for the wrong `good guy' before all is said and done.Also, actress Sasha Behar has some nice moments as Travers' legal `sidekick', actress Dervla Kirwan gets time to shine as Travers' dutiful wife, and Nathaniel Parker will have you thinking twice as the man accused of murdering his pretty young secretary.INJUSTICE is a television miniseries (five 45-minute episodes) produced by Injustice Films.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through Acorn Media.  Picture and audio quality are exceptionally good as they are both used to tremendous effect in spinning a yarn with flashbacks and `psychological' episodes.  I'm comfy admitting that I had some problem accessing the Episodes menu, but I was able to bypass it by selecting the `Play All' option.  The only special feature is a collection of production photos; granted, it would've been nice to have some actor, writer, or director commentary on the nature of psychosis or mental breakdowns - a subject near and dear to the main plot - but, alas, it wasn't meant to be.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  While INJUSTICE may be a bit slow for some viewers' tastes, I only thought the first hour dragged a bit.  Some of that was due to the narrative structure of the piece - there are two parallel tales on the nature of `justice' versus `injustice', and, as a consequence, there are two sets of pieces that need to be placed in motion.  By the conclusion of the second hour, it's very clear where the tale is heading and how the storytelling devices work.  Then, INJUSTICE clearly becomes a slowly simmering meditation on how the justice system can corrupt even the most cautious, right-minded individual, so much so that it may rot him to the core, though others might be hard pressed to see it.",4,FOUR STARS: INJUSTICE Delivers Justice To Deftly Layered Character Drama,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,4214,"['date', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'had', 'wonderful', 'career', 'first', 'came', 'attention', '2001', 'KNIGHT', 'TALE', 'where', 'made', 'most', 'secondary', 'role', 'Colville', 'Then', 'remember', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'HBO', 'BBC', 'stellar', 'Rome', 'series', 'Then', 'saw', 'US-ignored', 'SOLOMON', 'KANE', 'theatrical', 'adaptation', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'legendary', 'pulp', 'character', 'can', 'admit', 'picture', 'had', 'nominal', 'flaws', 'became', 'clear', 'justice', 'were', 'served', 'Purefoy', 'was', 'destined', 'greater', 'things', 'Still', 'toiled', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'hopefully', 'INJUSTICE', 'will', 'correct', 'that.William', 'Travers', 'played', 'Purefoy', 'barrister', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'big-city', 'law', 'suffering', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'learning', 'successfully', 'represented', 'criminal', 'responsible', 'heinous', 'accident', 'Instead', 'representing', 'petty', 'criminals', 'home', 'rural', 'Suffolk', 'However', 'when', 'past', 'friend', 'accused', 'murder', 'asks', 'representation', 'personally', 'Travers', 'begrudgingly', 'what', 'eventually', 'uncovers', 'will', 'push', 'psychological', 'limits', 'forcing', 'question', 'what', 'personally', 'in.So', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', 'INJUSTICE', 'bit', 'anomaly', ""n't"", 'easily', 'classified', 'one', 'part', 'police', 'procedural', 'one', 'part', 'legal', 'thriller', 'one', 'part', 'character', 'drama', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'storylines', 'revolving', 'main', 'plot', 'congeal', 'premise', 'what', 'justice', 'unjust', 'world', 'Granted', 'are', 'elements', 'here', 'appear', 'be', 'circumstantial', ""'re"", 'revealed', 'investigation', 'unfolds', 'audience', 'out', 'how', 'interwoven', 'shared', 'reality', 'theirs', 'truly', 'is.It', 'acted', 'brilliantly', 'Purefoy', 'thematic', 'counterpoint', 'DI', 'Mark', 'Wenborn', 'Charlie', 'Creed-Miles', 'Creator', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'massive', 'one-two', 'punch', 'having', 'two', 'seemingly', 'separate', 'stories', 'collide', 'Travers', 'own', 'discovery', 'friend', 'murder', 'charge', 'Wenborn', 'drawn', 'closer', 'elusive', 'identity', 'cruel', 'assassin', 'leads', 'are', 'hell', 'bent', 'seeing', 'justice', 'served', 'form', 'can', 'achieve', 'clear', 'even', 'Travers', 'Wenborn', 'may', 'be', 'curiously', 'complicit', 'bending', 'rules', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'agree', 'identify', 'point', 'audience', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'where', 'respective', 'method', 'delivers', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'shocked', 'realize', 'may', 'be', 'rooting', 'wrong', 'good', 'guy', 'said', 'done.Also', 'actress', 'Sasha', 'Behar', 'nice', 'moments', 'Travers', 'legal', 'sidekick', 'actress', 'Dervla', 'Kirwan', 'time', 'shine', 'Travers', 'dutiful', 'wife', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'twice', 'man', 'accused', 'murdering', 'pretty', 'young', 'secretary.INJUSTICE', 'television', 'miniseries', 'five', '45-minute', 'episodes', 'produced', 'Injustice', 'Films', 'DVD', 'distribution', 'stateside', 'being', 'handled', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'Picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'are', 'used', 'tremendous', 'effect', 'spinning', 'yarn', 'flashbacks', 'psychological', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'comfy', 'admitting', 'had', 'problem', 'accessing', 'Episodes', 'menu', 'was', 'able', 'bypass', 'selecting', 'Play', 'option', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'collection', 'production', 'photos', 'granted', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'actor', 'writer', 'director', 'commentary', 'nature', 'psychosis', 'mental', 'breakdowns', 'subject', 'dear', 'main', 'plot', 'alas', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'INJUSTICE', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'viewers', 'tastes', 'only', 'thought', 'first', 'hour', 'dragged', 'bit', 'was', 'due', 'narrative', 'structure', 'piece', 'are', 'two', 'parallel', 'tales', 'nature', 'justice', 'versus', 'injustice', 'consequence', 'are', 'two', 'sets', 'pieces', 'need', 'be', 'placed', 'motion', 'conclusion', 'second', 'hour', 'very', 'clear', 'where', 'tale', 'heading', 'how', 'storytelling', 'devices', 'work', 'Then', 'INJUSTICE', 'clearly', 'slowly', 'simmering', 'meditation', 'how', 'justice', 'system', 'can', 'corrupt', 'even', 'most', 'cautious', 'right-minded', 'individual', 'so', 'much', 'may', 'rot', 'core', 'others', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'see']",Injustice: Season 1 [Region 2]

1496700,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B005ONP7VU,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[30, 32]","Anthony Horowitz created, wrote, and produced this mini-series. It's a psychological thriller with layer upon layer of subplot, reminiscent of a best-selling novel. Horowitz was responsible for Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, and much more. It was his name that caught my attention and inspired me to watch this 5-parter. It is really a 3  hour movie. It's great on DVD so you can begin at lunch and watch through till dinner (or supper till bedtime). But don't expect to be able to sleep immediately after watching this mind-twisting series. Whenever you start episode one, you'll not be able to stop watching till the end.SUBTITLES provided for DVDs. TV airing June 2011Episode 1: Defense Barrister Will Travers (James Purefoy-`Dance to the Music of Time') moves to the Suffolk countryside. Nice scenery, but too much action and flashbacks to enjoy the setting very long. Wife Jane (Dervla Kirwan) teaches to boys in a juvenile detention facility. Will is troubled over a violent past, exposed slowly via the flashbacks. His old friend Martin (Nathaniel Parker-`Land Girls') is arrested for murdering his lover/secretary (Jayne Wisener). Solicitor Miss Chandra (Sasha Behar) asks Travers to take the case after refusing murder defense for 2 years following a breakdown. Murders multiply. DI Wenborn (Charlie Creed-Miles) investigates with a grudge. He's ordered around by a nasty cop boss (David Schofield-`Land Girls' `Pirates of the Caribbean' `Blue Murder'). Multi-plots revealed.___ 2: Travers gets the facts from his accused friend (but more there in the relationship to discover). And he recalls his night with the murdered Lucy (brief nude shot). He also explains his laptop disappeared at the same time, hardware owned by Qestrel Oil. A connection to the murder? Travers is stalked. Jane gets impressed with a lad's writing. Why was animal activist Spaull killed? Execution as DI Wenborn thinks? Wenborn's a man viewer's soon hate. Mental illness?___ 3: `Agadir' begins to pop up in the wrong places. Wenborn's wife is arrested about the time he learns Travers has past case connections. Jane learns why her writing student is imprisoned. Prosecution barrister played by Nick Dunning (`Iron Lady' `Tudors').___ 4: Murdered Lucy had form. Wenborn bullies a suspect about a gun. Again Wenborn looses control. There is a suicide now in the mix.___ 5: A journalist's story becomes evidence. Qestrel Oil is involved. There's another attempted blackmail in this dramatic, dark, disturbing conclusion.

1496709,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B005ONP7VU,Jon Wynne,"[1, 1]","On the DVD cover of INJUSTICE it says, at the top of the box before the title, &#8220;From the creator of Foyle&#8217;s War&#8221;. That tells you something. The brilliant writer Anthony Horowitz, whose work on &#8220;Midsomer Murders&#8221; as well as &#8220;Foyle&#8217;s War&#8221; renders him one of the finest writers of television drama working in the industry today, provides a powerful script that is intricately plotted and perfectly balanced, sustaining its drama and tension right up until the end of the five episodes.Led by James Purefoy, who will be familiar to audiences for a number of fine performances (and by this reviewer for his excellent portrayal of Beau Brummell), the acting is spot-on all the way down to the smallest of roles. This includes an essentially silent performance by a child actor who factors into the story in a way that will not be revealed here. Possibly the most interesting performance is by an actor not yet as well known, at least in North America &#8211; Charlie Creed-Miles &#8211; who plays a very colourful, hard-nosed investigating cop who crosses paths with Purefoy&#8217;s haunted lawyer William Travers. Also worthy of notice is Nathaniel Parker as the old friend of Travers&#8217; who desperately needs his counsel in a murder trial.The twists keep coming fast and furious in each of the five parts, each episode ending with a moment of revelation that keeps you watching in rapt anticipation of the next &#8220;wow&#8221; moment.There isn&#8217;t a flaw to be found in the execution of this superb drama which draws upon the best of legal and police dramas to fuel the story. Horowitz shows (as he has so often done in the past in his other work) that an intelligent script that keeps the audience guessing is the best drama there is. The violence is minimal (though a little gory) and there are no car chases in sight &#8211; just realistic, high-octane drama produced and performed to perfection.James Purefoy is a great leading man, capable of portraying strength and vulnerability in equal measure. It must be remembered that he was highly touted to be the next James Bond, losing out to Pierce Brosnan initially, then later to Daniel Craig in &#8220;Casino Royale&#8221;. At the same time, Purefoy is outstanding in period pieces and one can only surmise that there is virtually no limit to his considerable acting range.Brilliant script + Excellent leading man + solid production values and supporting cast = INJUSTICE.

Eerily, his prints hoovered just off the pages of script, evident in pacing, tone and tenor and I wonder if the honourable he and Mr. Horowitz wrote the denouement in one mind.Yes, Purefoy (Travers) was excellent as a the subdued, yet stalk-on rigorous attorney, eying both the prosecution and his client throughout the trial.  Moreover, the flashbacks of life before rural Suffolk, as well as the choppy shots of the murder of Spaull, were done in a coherent, easy manner with which to keep pace.  The insinuations of a 'breakdown' in Travers' past was another great possible portent of pitiful prospects that sent tingles up my spine.  Was he going to fall apart and go on a spree, will it come off short, constrained by the so-called British sangfroid? And again my thoughts returned to Hitch, who could have only contributed to this series through the breath of his spirit and his lasting influence on a talented Horowitz.  Hitch was admittedly afraid of many things, in fact, he once said ""The only way to get rid of my fears is to make films about them.""The support actors were brilliant! Dervla Kirwan is always spot-on. Although I have never watched Charlie Creed-Miles before, I can honestly say, I just hated him in such a good way!

It was dragging and the storyline seemed boring, But I  gave it another try, and by the end of episode one, I was a believer.James Purefoy  plays William Travers he is a good looking defense lawyer,  lives in Suffolk  and has a lovely family. Though on closer inspection, all does not seem right. It seems he has had a recent breakdown. A recurrent nightmare leads to the death of a man, though it takes two episodes to get us there. William's wife is teaching literature at the local boys reformatory, and has a special student that she may mentor.Then there's DI Mark Wenborn, played by Charlie Creed-Miles who had a colleague who was crooked, and, now Charlie's a mean man, not liked by anyone. He has his eyes on Travers and that can't lead to anything good.One of Willam's old school friends has been arrested for murder, and he has requested William as his barrister. This means William will need to return to London, the scene of his breakdown. Most of the story is told in flashbacks, and it is interesting, indeed, to look at the evidence and clues as they accumulate. This has turned into a well planned and laid out series.

This was not his most impressive hour (because of the character, not his acting), but it was okay.The formula is typical British soap opera style where you have all these seemingly unrelated characters and plots going on that converge at the end. There is a big reveal and the viewer let's out a sigh of understanding and awe of brilliant, creative story-telling - except that it's not all that brilliant. I generally like the formula and am usually delightfully surprised. However, not this time. There are things that weren't wrapped up, which leads me to wonder if that was done purposefully to leave room for a part 2. There were questions about what was real and what was fantasized as part of a nervous breakdown. Much of it was predictable. Worst of all is the big speech at the end that tells us what happened. Ugh! Did we go all that way for that?Still, it's a lot better than what American TV is producing these days. Given that, I'd say it was a worthwhile effort, but not great. If you like British tv, you will probably find it at least okay.
