I popped in disc one and enjoyed the first four eposide's everyone who say's they are subpar really need's to get a life. The eposide's are just as funny s the previous season's. Back to the problem at hand I pop in disc two and I get a screen that says this disc is not comptibale and the player says no  play. I proceed to check it in my dvd rom drive of my expenisve computer thinking maybe it will play that's what happened a few weeks afo with Freaky Friday and zippo same thing. HBO I have changed my mind it is bad enough having to pay the same price for half the materail it is plain robbery having to pay 32.49 for 4  epoisdes.

The one thing that I find is missing from season 5 is the juiciness of the previous 4 seasons. The shows from seasons 1-4 just seem to be more entertaining and fun to watch. Still, I love this show and always will. As for season 6 (the final season), rumor has it that Kim Catrall's character Samantha will find herself battling cancer. I don't know this for sure, but this is an interesting twist that could be true. Anyhow, SEX will go down in history as one of the funniest, and most brutally honest, shows ever.

Following the exploits of four young and educated female friends living and working in New York City, the show revolves around the various relationships and life problems experienced by each member of the group. Sporting an experienced and talented cast, the show has developed a strong, borderline fanatic following...Sarah Jessica Parker (the de facto lead character of the show) stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a popular sex columnist for a local newspaper who travels in numerous Manhattan social circles. Carrie is engaged in a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with a mystery man always referred to as ""Mr. Big"". The young urban professional shares her life with three best friends who have similarly interesting jobs - Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer tired of being single given the societal ramifications; Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a promiscuous publicist who enjoys non-exclusive relationships; and Charlotte McDougal (Kristin Davis), an art museum curator who is relatively less open about her sexuality... Together, the women seek each other's advice on the ever-present and varying predicaments in which they find their romantic relationships...The Sex And The City (Season 5) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Anchors Away"" in which a sailor invites Carrie to a 'Fleet Week' party (only to have her go home alone due to her inability to forget about her past relationships with Aidan and Mr. Big). Meanwhile, Charlotte has a less than pleasing experience with a naval officer, and Samantha goes to extremes to let the neighborhood know of Richard's infidelities... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""Unoriginal Sin"" in which Samantha gets back together with Richard and Miranda agrees to baptize Brady, and ""The Big Journey"" in which Carrie's book tour takes her out to San Francisco where she's reunited with Mr. Big...Below is a list of episodes included on the Sex And The City (Season 5) DVD:Episode 67 (Anchors Away)Episode 68 (Unoriginal Sin)Episode 69 (Luck Be an Old Lady)Episode 70 (Cover Girl)Episode 71 (Plus One is the Loneliest Number)Episode 72 (Critical Condition)Episode 73 (The Big Journey)Episode 74 (I Love a Charade)The DVD Report",4,One of the best original cable programs ever...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2406,"['Based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Candace', 'Bushnell', 'HBO', 'original', 'series', 'Sex', 'City', 'took', 'television', 'world', 'storm', 'following', 'release', 'summer', '1998', 'Following', 'exploits', 'four', 'young', 'educated', 'female', 'friends', 'living', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'show', 'various', 'relationships', 'life', 'problems', 'experienced', 'member', 'group', 'Sporting', 'experienced', 'talented', 'cast', 'show', 'developed', 'strong', 'borderline', 'fanatic', 'following', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'de', 'facto', 'lead', 'character', 'show', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'popular', 'sex', 'columnist', 'local', 'newspaper', 'who', 'numerous', 'Manhattan', 'social', 'circles', 'Carrie', 'engaged', 'tempestuous', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'mystery', 'man', 'always', 'referred', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'young', 'urban', 'professional', 'shares', 'life', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'similarly', 'interesting', 'jobs', 'Miranda', 'Hobbs', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'lawyer', 'tired', 'being', 'single', 'given', 'societal', 'ramifications', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'promiscuous', 'publicist', 'who', 'non-exclusive', 'relationships', 'Charlotte', 'McDougal', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'art', 'museum', 'curator', 'who', 'relatively', 'less', 'open', 'sexuality', 'Together', 'women', 'seek', 'other', 'advice', 'ever-present', 'varying', 'predicaments', 'find', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Sex', 'City', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Anchors', 'Away', 'sailor', 'Carrie', ""'Fleet"", 'Week', 'party', 'only', 'have', 'go', 'home', 'alone', 'due', 'inability', 'forget', 'past', 'relationships', 'Aidan', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Meanwhile', 'Charlotte', 'less', 'pleasing', 'experience', 'naval', 'officer', 'Samantha', 'extremes', 'let', 'neighborhood', 'know', 'Richard', 'infidelities', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'include', 'Unoriginal', 'Sin', 'Samantha', 'back', 'together', 'Richard', 'Miranda', 'baptize', 'Brady', 'Big', 'Journey', 'Carrie', 'book', 'tour', 'out', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'reunited', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Sex', 'City', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'Episode', '67', 'Anchors', 'Away', 'Episode', '68', 'Unoriginal', 'Sin', 'Episode', '69', 'Luck', 'Be', 'Old', 'Lady', 'Episode', '70', 'Cover', 'Girl', 'Episode', '71', 'One', 'Loneliest', 'Number', 'Episode', '72', 'Critical', 'Condition', 'Episode', '73', 'Big', 'Journey', 'Episode', '74', 'Love', 'Charade', 'DVD', 'Report']",Sex and the City: Season 5

And when a show is as popular as Sex And The City is, everyone's bound to notice. That's what happened with Sex And The City's Fifth ""Bonus"" Season. The bonus word thrown around in an attempt to distract us from realizing that the whole season (only 8 episodes, but thank God cause who could have put up with more?) was spent reaching. The well had officially run dry. What's really a shame is that the whole season wasn't so terrible, but because SATC fans are so used to perfection, it seemed like a train wreck.The most obvious problem was the stories. SATC, a TV show known for diving into the problems of four single 30 something New York ladies, quickly became a story about four bitter aging women who's fears had come true. Since the show's beginning they had feared becoming old, tired maids and that's exactly what happened.On the season's premiere episode, Anchors Away, the ladies all but throw Miranda in a Taxicab so she and her baby can go home and they can go live it up at a party with the sailors. All of this would have been fine when the show first began, but later there's a shot of Carrie, Samantha and Charlotte walking to the party and instead of it being sexy, it was so sad. I actually felt embarrassed for them. The show has always been mostly true to life, but if three single worn out looking women pushing well into their 40s went to a party looking like they did with a bunch of 20 something guys, they'd get laughed at.Miranda and Carrie's nostalgia quickly echoed ours as the viewer began to realize this was a preview of things to come. Out of all 8 episodes, I only enjoyed 2 of them and I was only really happy with 2 of the characters.Carrie being sent to work for Vogue was a terrible idea. The fifth season saw her become more self centered than usual. I haven't always agreed with Carrie's choices, but I've respected them up until this season. Her selfishness pushed past its final limits and answered to pretty much everyone but her as to why she's still single. As for less important things, her hair looked God-awful. Her face was way too pale this season and the way they tried to hide Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy was just absurd. From everything to hideous dresses to giant magazines, it was quite noticeable and would have been more believable had she just ""gained weight"" from the stress of her book.Samantha was a terrible disappointment this season. As someone who's deliciously decedent and so much fun to watch, I can see why the writers wanted to make her more human and see her fall in love, but what they did to Samantha's character was unforgivable. First she's in love, then she's afraid, then she's insecure, then she gets a broken heart, then she forgives Richard, then she's insecure again until finally she turns psycho and accuses Richard of cheating again when he wasn't. Later in the season she practically tries to kill two of Richard's houseguests when they won't leave because she's throwing a party in his house which she wasn't even given permission to do.Charlotte stayed most true to herself than all of the other characters. She remained to be the ""eternal optimist"" and really kept the show alive for me. Watching Charlotte be herself amongst a group of people who weren't being themselves gave me a little sliver of hope. I enjoyed watching her fall in love with the hairy lawyer who's so not her type and I enjoyed watching her not give up on love. Kristen Davis was incredible this year and deserved a nomination, which she has yet to receive.Miranda also made me proud acting like the only adult on the show. She had a baby, her and Steve tried their best to get their lives together and raise Brady as best as they could. Miranda often felt left out by her friends, she was. Miranda often had tough choices to make concerning her baby, moms always do. I liked watching Miranda struggle with this as it brought the only realism to the show.As for the episodes, most of them were lacking. In one episode, Carrie freaks because she runs into Aiden's ex and she makes a face at her and Carrie realizes Aiden must have told her some horrible things about her. Oh no! Could she really have hurt him so bad, she later asks Steve, Aiden's best friend. Hello! She dumped him twice and cheated on him. How Carrie can be THIS selfish and THIS dumb is beyond me.Also in that episode, Heather Graham shows up for no reason which becomes a theme in this season - things happening for no reason. Miranda asks Carrie to be her baby's Godmother instead of Charlotte. Carrie decides out of the blue in one episode, she needs to get laid. So she returns to Mr. Big. Why he sleeps with her after she made fun of him in her book makes no sense and gives guys like me a bad name.This season was a big let down for me. Not only did it make no sense, but it was a slap in the face to those who adore the show. Uninteresting stories, new uninteresting characters (one who's name is Burger, don't ask) and favorite characters changing into paper thin shadows of their former selves made this a very forgettable season of Sex And The City.The only enjoyable episodes were Unoriginal Sin, an episode where Miranda gets Brady christened and I Love A Charade, the season finale where Charlotte falls in love and a little Zsa Zsa Zsu is put back into the show.",3,...

746612,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00008PW2D,Cubist,"[6, 8]","This set offers the best transfers so far with crystal clear resolution and strikingly vibrant colours. For the first time 5.1 surround sound has been applied to each episode. In fact, the show looks and sounds better then when it originally aired on HBO. Unfortunately, the amount of supplemental material is still on the skimpy side but the quality of the show is what counts.""When you are single and live in New York, there is no end to the ways to fill your day. Museums, parks, theaters, concert halls, night clubs and countless restaurants."" This quote, spoken by Carrie at the beginning of the first episode perfectly encapsulates the central theme of the season: being single in the city. As the season begins Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha are all getting over men in their lives.The best episodes of this season are the ones where our four leading ladies celebrate their individuality. From their trip to Atlantic City to celebrate Charlotte's birthday to Carrie and Samantha's cross-country train ride for Carrie's book reading and signing gig in San Francisco (with a classic appearance by Mr. Big), these characters revel in the bachelorettehood. They prove that older women do not have to conform to the traditional belief that by a certain age you must be married and have children.Sex and the City's strengths are many, most notably its great writing, fantastic cast and the locations. The show is actually shot in New York City and this gives it a real sense of place, unlike Friends (also set in the Big Apple) which only offers a simulacrum of the city. Sex and the City really captures the high level of energy inherent with living in Manhattan. People are more aggressive, they don't hold back anything and aren't afraid to tell it like it is. For anyone who lives or has lived in the city, there are not only many landmarks on display that only they will recognize but also a few obvious ones that anyone who has a passing familiarity with the city will know.As for the extras -- one of the show's producers and writers, Michael Patrick King contributes three audio commentaries for three of the episodes. On the season opener, ""Anchors Away,"" he talks about how they set the tone of that particular season and how the events of 9/11 affected how they depicted life in New York City. He has a very engaging voice and conveys a lot of good information and observations on this track. Fans of the show will definitely want to check out his commentaries.""Interactive Trivia Game"" is a bland game where one has to answer questions that pertain to the fifth season. It's a shame the DVD producers didn't take pointers from the Legally Blonde 2 DVD which had the cast and crew actually ask the questions and offer funny answers to right and wrong answers specifically done for the disc. A missed opportunity to be sure.""Behind the Scenes with Costume Designer Patricia Field"" is an interesting look at one of the most important aspects of the show: what the characters wear.Comparing this set to the first season box set only reinforces the great leaps of quality and quantity that has gone into these DVDs.",3,Short Season but Quality Episodes...,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,3132,"['set', 'best', 'transfers', 'so', 'far', 'crystal', 'clear', 'resolution', 'strikingly', 'vibrant', 'colours', 'first', 'time', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'been', 'applied', 'episode', 'fact', 'show', 'better', 'then', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'HBO', 'Unfortunately', 'amount', 'supplemental', 'material', 'still', 'skimpy', 'side', 'quality', 'show', 'what', 'When', 'are', 'single', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'end', 'ways', 'fill', 'day', 'Museums', 'parks', 'theaters', 'concert', 'halls', 'night', 'clubs', 'countless', 'restaurants', 'quote', 'spoken', 'Carrie', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode', 'perfectly', 'central', 'theme', 'season', 'being', 'single', 'city', 'season', 'Carrie', 'Miranda', 'Charlotte', 'Samantha', 'are', 'getting', 'over', 'men', 'lives.The', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'ones', 'where', 'four', 'leading', 'ladies', 'celebrate', 'individuality', 'trip', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'celebrate', 'Charlotte', 'birthday', 'Carrie', 'Samantha', 'cross-country', 'train', 'ride', 'Carrie', 'book', 'reading', 'signing', 'gig', 'San', 'Francisco', 'classic', 'appearance', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'characters', 'revel', 'bachelorettehood', 'prove', 'older', 'women', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'conform', 'traditional', 'belief', 'certain', 'age', 'must', 'be', 'married', 'have', 'children.Sex', 'City', 'strengths', 'are', 'many', 'most', 'notably', 'great', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'locations', 'show', 'actually', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'real', 'sense', 'place', 'Friends', 'also', 'set', 'Big', 'Apple', 'only', 'simulacrum', 'city', 'Sex', 'City', 'really', 'high', 'level', 'energy', 'inherent', 'living', 'Manhattan', 'People', 'are', 'more', 'aggressive', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'anything', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'tell', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'city', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'many', 'landmarks', 'display', 'only', 'will', 'recognize', 'also', 'few', 'obvious', 'ones', 'anyone', 'who', 'passing', 'familiarity', 'city', 'will', 'know.As', 'extras', 'one', 'show', 'producers', 'writers', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'three', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'three', 'episodes', 'season', 'opener', 'Anchors', 'Away', 'how', 'set', 'tone', 'particular', 'season', 'how', 'events', '9/11', 'affected', 'how', 'depicted', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'very', 'engaging', 'voice', 'conveys', 'lot', 'good', 'information', 'observations', 'track', 'Fans', 'show', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'commentaries', 'Interactive', 'Trivia', 'Game', 'bland', 'game', 'where', 'one', 'answer', 'questions', 'pertain', 'fifth', 'season', 'shame', 'DVD', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'pointers', 'Legally', 'Blonde', '2', 'DVD', 'had', 'cast', 'crew', 'actually', 'questions', 'offer', 'funny', 'answers', 'right', 'wrong', 'answers', 'specifically', 'done', 'disc', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'be', 'sure', 'Scenes', 'Costume', 'Designer', 'Patricia', 'Field', 'interesting', 'look', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'show', 'what', 'characters', 'wear.Comparing', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'only', 'great', 'leaps', 'quality', 'quantity', 'gone', 'DVDs']",Sex and the City: Season 5

So there I went to the store and plopped down my hard-earned money, and after opening the DVD (can't return it now!), I remembered too late that the show was half its usual length.  That's when I realized I'd been seriously ripped off--half the show for double the price?!  Too bad I own this now and too bad HBO didn't think to bring the price down to match.  Here's a tip for those who haven't bought the Fifth Season yet: if you or a friend have an annual membership to one of those bulk-purchase warehouse stores (in the US--they're everywhere), you can buy one of the other SNTC season DVDs (if you're missing one) and get money off of this one in-store.

A lot of people will say that Season 5 is what's wrong with SATC, but I say that Season 5 is what's RIGHT about the show!  Season 5 is the most realistic of all six seasons.  Playfully dubbed ""the season without men"" by the show's writers, there are very few long-term (or short-term, for that matter) relationships for the women in this season.  Until Season 5, the women of SATC have gone through a seemingly endless string of semi-serious to serious relationships without any real examination of what and who the women are without men.  This season forces all of the women to show their true colors without men.  Even Samantha's antics are toned down and used more to expose who she is rather than what she does.Many fans complained that Season 5 wasn't funny enough.  Not enough men, not enough sex.  Real single women know that Season 5 was the closest of all the seasons to what all of us experience in our daily lives - loneliness, good friends, occasional romantic connections, and a lot of ""in between"".  Season 5 isn't ""filler"" or a poor season - its real life.  Fans of the show who don't enjoy this season are, perhaps, happy to forget about their own lives while following those of Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha.

(Let's not even start on the dividing of Season 6 into 2 parts!)But it's interesting to me to see how much anger about the price/value has spilled into vitriolic evaluations of this season.  To me, it was the first time in awhile that the characters moved in believable directions.  Samantha opened herself up to commitment and heartbreak...and in a way only Samantha could do!  Miranda dealt with motherhood and her VERY ambiguous feelings towards it.  I liked very much the way she went from barely paying attention to her baby to finding satisfaction in loving her child and caring for him (too bad she named him ""Brady"").  I also like the constant evolution of her feelings toward Steve.  Charlotte works on coming to terms with failure, not only of her marriage, but of her whole ""game plan"" for life...marrying a nice, well-off professional, have kids, etc.Carrie is always the problematic character.  Her treatment of the important men in her life, particularly Aidan, has made her a tough person to care about.  She's witty...no doubt, and it's always fascinating to see what horrific or wonderful outfit she'll be wearing next.  I was relieved to see so little of Big in this season.  I guess I'm the only one who always found their relationship lacking...they brought out the worst in each other more than they brought out the best.The season was made a little uncomfortable by Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy.  It forced her to wear some awful things, and the directors of the show still insisted on lots of full body shots of her.  I remember a shot in the season finale, during the wedding reception.  She's standing there, looking pensive, and for some reason, instead of a close up (or even medium close-up), we got a full shot, and the poor thing looked awful.  And she looks tired and overly made up throughout the season.  It's not her fault...I'm thrilled she had a baby...but the shows producers (which include Parker, ironically) didn't do Parker or Carrie any favors.But the season is packed with highlights.  The vibrating chair stuff is very funny.  The trip to Atlantic City was fun.  The entire season finale was a treat, with everyone perplexed at Nathan Lane's character.And the acting and writing was superb as always.  All four leads did very well, and excellent support was offered all around (although I was disappointed that Molly Shannon and Amy Sedaris weren't given more to do as Carrie's publishers).  Candice Bergen was amusing, and Frances Sternhagen makes a brief but memorable appearance as Bunny.  I was glad to see Office Space's Ron Livingston, and look forward to his character's arch in Season 6.So, if you don't want to spend full price on this set (I don't blame you) spring for used copies on Amazon or at online auction sites.

If Sarah Jessica Parker wants to have a baby, then she should have a baby. But if it's going to be short, couldn't the episodes have been better? Answer: Yes. Could've.When we left our four girls, Big had moved to Napa, leaving our beloved protagonist Carrie alone in the big city in my personal favorite episode, I HEART NY. Also, Charlotte decided to get over her divorce, Samantha discovered what it was like to get a broken heart, and Miranda met a new man of her life:her son Brady. These four lovely ladies start off this season freshly single, and knowing the show, it won't stay that way for too long.New changes are in the air. To begin with, Carrie is about to publish a book of her collumns. Charlotte celebrates her 36th birthday with the girls in Atlantic City while Samantha (briefly) gets back with her ex (vile Richard) and Miranda discovers the ups and downs to having a post-baby body-and life. Sounds great, right? That's just the first three episodes. Then on the (forgettable) fourth one, Carrie walks in on Samantha, uh...uhh...having an oral session with ""her"" World Wide Express guy. The way that Carrie judges Samantha was just totally unrealistic and out of character for both of them-they've been friends for way too long and should've known each other better. And in the delightful fifth episode, Carrie celebrates her launch party and meets the charming (but taken) Jack Berger (played to perfection by that guy from OFFICE SPACE) and all the girls wonder why plus one is the lonliest number. And the sixth episode is just too much like the fourth-they both have the same themes of judging and it's just too seen it all before stuff. And in the seventh episode, Carrie, desperate for a man, takes Samantha with her to San Fransisco to ""catch up"" with Big. It's just really bad-Carrie is just too desperate and it's soo out of character for her. And as the cherry topper of this poor episode, Charlotte gets hot and heavy with her divorce lawyer who, in short terms, isn't exactly a Calvin Klein model. I really don't have a problem with Charlotte, or any of the ladies, dating unattractive men, but the way the way that they have to magnify it and make it so obvious is just sappy and cliched.
