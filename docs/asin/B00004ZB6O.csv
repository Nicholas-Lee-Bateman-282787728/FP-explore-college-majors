It turned out to be a 4 hour historical tour de force. What is so amazing about it is that it's far more visual than you would ever expect based on the period it describes. The use of the paintings and drawings that Napoleon commissioned after his victories gives the work a nearly photographic authority. Furthermore, footage from actual European sites like Austerlitz, Corsica, and Paris make the documentary quite intriguing. I really enjoyed some of the scenes which were reenacted. The narrative is established by interviewing a dozen or so historians who successfully enlighten us as to the inner nature of Napoleon along with the seminal events of his life. We discover that he was an Emperor of micromanagement whose entire life was based on the joy of work. When he wasn't working...he was working. Briefly, while in exile at Alba, he even showered his skills in organization upon that tiny island. I can't recommend this one enough, quite honestly. Here we have television at its finest: unbiased, educational, and utterly stimulating.

561900,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00004ZB6O,Charles Ashbacher,"[6, 6]","It is a truism of history that empires that rise quickly due to force of arms fall fast and hard. The two most pronounced are the German ""empire"" of the 1930's and 1940's and the French empire under Napoleon in the early nineteenth century. Both rose very quickly and fell even faster, ironically due to making the same mistake, invading Russia with a mighty army, only to see it swallowed up by the land and the weather.Both Hitler and Napoleon aspired to dominate the heart of the European continent, yet were not satisfied when they achieved it. Each planned an invasion of the British Isles, yet both were unable to carry out even an attempt. Finally, both rose from humble origins, and neither was originally from the country they came to dominate. Hitler was Austrian and Napoleon was Corsican, and each at some point believed in their own great historical destiny.Napoleon was clearly the greatest military genius of his time and one of the most dynamic personalities of all time. His drive to succeed was incredible, what he created was a genuine, popular personality cult based on his powerful charisma. As I watched the tape, it was easy to be impressed at how he rose to such heights. Of course, he had help in his rise to power, as all who manage to rise to such power must have.The pent-up forces that launched the French revolution, the subsequent terror and backlash all led to a nation that was eager for a great savior. Given his military victories and the hostility of the monarchist states in Europe to Republican France, it was probably inevitable that a military dictatorship emerged. Napoleon's rise to power was not a social retreat, only a political one. He was shrewd enough to maintain the measures of social equality won by the revolution, which was guaranteed to win popular support.Until I watched this tape, I was unaware of how much energy Napoleon had. He was directly involved in many of the details of government, often dictating correspondence until his secretaries collapsed out of exhaustion. His love for Josephine was also genuine and deep, even when he was preparing for the battles that would expand his empire, he took the time out to write her detailed, thoughtful letters.Unfortunately, Josephine was unable to bear the required male heir to the throne, and political necessity dictated that Napoleon divorce her to marry someone who could. He was quite generous in his treatment of Josephine, giving her a palatial home and a large pension. One of the most interesting and debatable points in the tape concerns the changes that came over Napoleon after his son was born. There is no question that he was a devoted husband and father and there are suggestions in the tape that the time spent performing these duties kept him from ruling effectively. I believe that the empire was largely doomed anyway, any reduction in his effectiveness due to family obligations could only have hastened the fall.There have been three great revolutions in the last three centuries, one that spawned the United States, another in France and the third that created the Soviet Union. While the last two led to dictatorships, terror and empires, the difference was that the French empire was led by a man who exhibited many human traits and whose life is interesting in the human as well as historical sense. No one could ever say that about Joseph Stalin. This tape captures all the grandeur and humanity of Napoleon, the passion for war, the passion for Josephine and his boundless energy that drove him beyond what even he could achieve. Since it is not possible to understand nineteenth century Europe without learning about the Napoleonic era, any study of that century should begin with a viewing of this tape.",5,Superb history of a man who named an era,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,3741,"['truism', 'history', 'rise', 'quickly', 'due', 'force', 'arms', 'fall', 'fast', 'hard', 'two', 'most', 'pronounced', 'are', 'German', 'empire', '1930', '1940', 'French', 'empire', 'Napoleon', 'early', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'rose', 'very', 'quickly', 'fell', 'even', 'faster', 'ironically', 'due', 'making', 'same', 'mistake', 'invading', 'Russia', 'mighty', 'army', 'only', 'see', 'swallowed', 'up', 'land', 'weather.Both', 'Hitler', 'Napoleon', 'aspired', 'dominate', 'heart', 'European', 'continent', 'yet', 'were', 'not', 'satisfied', 'when', 'achieved', 'planned', 'invasion', 'British', 'Isles', 'yet', 'were', 'unable', 'carry', 'out', 'even', 'attempt', 'Finally', 'rose', 'humble', 'origins', 'was', 'originally', 'country', 'came', 'dominate', 'Hitler', 'was', 'Austrian', 'Napoleon', 'was', 'Corsican', 'point', 'believed', 'own', 'great', 'historical', 'destiny.Napoleon', 'was', 'clearly', 'greatest', 'military', 'genius', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'dynamic', 'personalities', 'time', 'drive', 'succeed', 'was', 'incredible', 'what', 'created', 'was', 'genuine', 'popular', 'personality', 'cult', 'based', 'powerful', 'charisma', 'watched', 'tape', 'was', 'easy', 'be', 'impressed', 'how', 'rose', 'such', 'heights', 'course', 'had', 'help', 'rise', 'power', 'who', 'manage', 'rise', 'such', 'power', 'must', 'have.The', 'pent-up', 'forces', 'launched', 'French', 'revolution', 'subsequent', 'terror', 'backlash', 'led', 'nation', 'was', 'eager', 'great', 'savior', 'Given', 'military', 'victories', 'hostility', 'monarchist', 'states', 'Europe', 'Republican', 'France', 'was', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'emerged', 'Napoleon', 'rise', 'power', 'was', 'not', 'social', 'retreat', 'only', 'political', 'one', 'was', 'shrewd', 'enough', 'maintain', 'measures', 'social', 'equality', 'won', 'revolution', 'was', 'guaranteed', 'win', 'popular', 'support.Until', 'watched', 'tape', 'was', 'unaware', 'how', 'much', 'energy', 'Napoleon', 'had', 'was', 'directly', 'involved', 'many', 'details', 'government', 'often', 'dictating', 'correspondence', 'secretaries', 'collapsed', 'exhaustion', 'love', 'Josephine', 'was', 'also', 'genuine', 'deep', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'preparing', 'battles', 'would', 'expand', 'empire', 'took', 'time', 'out', 'write', 'detailed', 'thoughtful', 'letters.Unfortunately', 'Josephine', 'was', 'unable', 'bear', 'required', 'male', 'heir', 'throne', 'political', 'necessity', 'dictated', 'Napoleon', 'divorce', 'marry', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'was', 'quite', 'generous', 'treatment', 'Josephine', 'giving', 'palatial', 'home', 'large', 'pension', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'debatable', 'points', 'tape', 'changes', 'came', 'Napoleon', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'question', 'was', 'devoted', 'husband', 'father', 'are', 'suggestions', 'tape', 'time', 'spent', 'performing', 'duties', 'kept', 'ruling', 'effectively', 'believe', 'empire', 'was', 'largely', 'doomed', 'anyway', 'reduction', 'effectiveness', 'due', 'family', 'obligations', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'hastened', 'fall.There', 'have', 'been', 'three', 'great', 'revolutions', 'last', 'three', 'centuries', 'one', 'spawned', 'United', 'States', 'France', 'third', 'created', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'last', 'two', 'led', 'dictatorships', 'terror', 'empires', 'difference', 'was', 'French', 'empire', 'was', 'led', 'man', 'who', 'exhibited', 'many', 'human', 'traits', 'life', 'interesting', 'human', 'as', 'well', 'historical', 'sense', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'say', 'about', 'Joseph', 'Stalin', 'tape', 'grandeur', 'humanity', 'Napoleon', 'passion', 'war', 'passion', 'Josephine', 'boundless', 'energy', 'drove', 'what', 'even', 'could', 'achieve', 'not', 'possible', 'understand', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'Europe', 'learning', 'Napoleonic', 'era', 'study', 'century', 'should', 'begin', 'viewing', 'tape']",N/A

The key word there is ""general"" because the documentary gives us merely a whirlwind tour through some of the highlights of one of the most amazing and complex figures in history.It had a promising beginning, with nice background about Corsica and Napoleon's parents. But by the time the young Bonaparte becomes an artillery lieutenant, the sense of trying to cram too much into a limited time frame soon overwhelms. I found myself shaking my head over the gaps and glossed over information - and the tendency to over-simplify. What is presented is presented fairly well. But I kept wondering about the bits that were left out.Several times, the program mentions that Napoleon gave advancement based on merit rather than birth or privilege. But we never hear about any of those extraordinary men such as Lannes, Murat, Duroc, Berthier, Junot who made it such an age of heroic and remarkable men. Marshal Ney is mentioned only once - at the battle of Waterloo. Talleyrand is quoted (once) but his contribution totally overlooked. Wellington comes out of nowhere at Waterloo - his campaign in Spain left on the cutting room floor. The fascinating thing about the Napoleonic age was that there were so many larger than life figures making history at the same time. Napoleon was probably the greatest, but not the only one. And more than a little of his success was due to these other men.Similarly, the program gives the impression that Napoleon is still buried on St Helena. There is no mention of the triumphant return of his remains to France - not a single shot of his magnificent tomb in Paris. And nothing is said about the subsequent behaviour of Empress Marie Louise or the fate of Napoleon's unfortunate son.It could have been so much better.",3,Just scratched the surface...,1067212800,"10 27, 2003",2003,1870,"['anyone', 'who', 'next', 'nothing', 'Napoleon', 'four', 'hour', 'documentary', 'will', 'serve', 'good', 'general', 'introduction', 'key', 'word', 'general', 'documentary', 'merely', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'highlights', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'complex', 'figures', 'history.It', 'had', 'promising', 'beginning', 'nice', 'background', 'Corsica', 'Napoleon', 'parents', 'time', 'young', 'Bonaparte', 'artillery', 'lieutenant', 'sense', 'trying', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'limited', 'time', 'frame', 'soon', 'overwhelms', 'found', 'shaking', 'head', 'gaps', 'glossed', 'information', 'tendency', 'over-simplify', 'What', 'presented', 'presented', 'fairly', 'well', 'kept', 'wondering', 'bits', 'were', 'left', 'out.Several', 'times', 'program', 'mentions', 'Napoleon', 'gave', 'advancement', 'based', 'merit', 'rather', 'birth', 'privilege', 'never', 'hear', 'extraordinary', 'men', 'such', 'Lannes', 'Murat', 'Duroc', 'Berthier', 'Junot', 'who', 'made', 'age', 'heroic', 'remarkable', 'men', 'Marshal', 'Ney', 'mentioned', 'only', 'once', 'battle', 'Waterloo', 'Talleyrand', 'quoted', 'once', 'contribution', 'totally', 'overlooked', 'Wellington', 'nowhere', 'Waterloo', 'campaign', 'Spain', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'Napoleonic', 'age', 'was', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'larger', 'life', 'figures', 'making', 'history', 'same', 'time', 'Napoleon', 'was', 'probably', 'greatest', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'little', 'success', 'was', 'due', 'other', 'men.Similarly', 'program', 'impression', 'Napoleon', 'still', 'buried', 'St', 'Helena', 'mention', 'triumphant', 'return', 'remains', 'France', 'not', 'single', 'shot', 'magnificent', 'tomb', 'Paris', 'nothing', 'said', 'subsequent', 'behaviour', 'Empress', 'Marie', 'Louise', 'fate', 'Napoleon', 'unfortunate', 'son.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A

The anti-French coalition was repeatedly shattered.The DVD shows the incredible energy possessed by Napoleon which, although he was an emperor, saw him being involved in day to day detailed government functions. He was an excellent strategist and exceptional soldier who clearly understood some basic principles of war that are currently studied at military staff colleges such as having a clear aim, maintenance of high morale of troops, speed, concentration of force at a decisive point and offensive action.

It was a bit dumbed-down, but I think it's intent was to be an introduction to the career of a most remarkable man- not a summation.  It was too bad that the ending couldn't have been re-shot to include the new developments in research, that Napoleon was in fact slowly poisioned to death with arsenic, by one of the trusted and closest members of his entourage.  The video presents Napoleon's death as being essentially from despair, which might have some validity, but it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if he had survived into old age.  After all, no one would have predicted that our country could ever have respected Richard Nixon again after Watergate and his resignation in disgrace. He managed to be, after a number of years, well-regarded as a kind of elder statesman, with his acumen and hindsight much valued.

I understand that to truly do the emperior justice a bio much longer than this would be required.  Unfortunately we go from Austerlitz, to Russia in 1812 and then rush up to Waterloo!The first half of the program which shows the little Corsican's childhood and rise to power is first-rate, but the second just breezes through too much in such a short time.  I also had a problem with David McCulloghs narration.  He sounds too American for a European subject like this.  I kept thinking is this Ken Burn's Civil War again!The selection of supposed experts and historians was uninspired.  Only John Elting was worth while, the others made simple and often foolish statements.  Missing were David Chandler, Christopher Duffy and many other famous Napoleanic historians who would have breathed fire into this stiff production.  No recent biographers of Napolean were included at all!PBS put together a pretty dry production here.  Even the music is a bit bland, and there is so much magificent music from this period.  Missing also is Wellington's stunning Peninsular Campaign in Spain, the famed ""Spanish Ulcer"" of Nappy.  Even the 1815 Campaign gets crunched with no explanation about the earlier battles of the campaign, and marshal Blucher's remarkable come back with the Prussians at Waterloo. There is no discussion about Napolean's famous Marshals who contributed so much to the flavor and character of his regime.  This is basically a work about Napolean the man, and little else.  The viewer should understand this.A nice, but very bland, incomplete production, adequate for those who know little or nothing about the period, but frustrating for the true scholar of that tempestuous time.

For those who are interested in Military History, there is details of major battles and the strategies used.As far as an overview of his life, they did a very good job, but don't expect any new material or interpretations of his life and times though.

561919,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00004ZB6O,Tom Brody,"[36, 47]","The disc contains four hours of commentary, two hours per side of the disc.  The style is uniform throughout.  There is one narrator.The following concerns only the first hour, of the four hour documenetary.  During the first hour, there are about 25 black and white ink sketches, 45 color paintings, and numerous motion pictures of landscapes.  The motion pictures show scenes from Napoleon's birthplace, the island of Corsica.  We see Corsica's seashore, grazing sheep, Napoleon's childhood home, and Corsica's craggy mountains.  Later, the live scenes show the palace at Versailles, close-ups of numerous statues, priests (actors) conducting ceremonies, church bells swinging and ringing, and soldiers (actors) firing cannons.From time to time, we see one of several French scholars, speaking in French with a charming real French accent, and voiceover from the English-speaking commentator.  (Love that cute French accent.)The first hour discloses the following facts and events:We learn the fact that Napoleon rose through the ranks on the basis of his ability, rather than from influence from his parents or ancestors.  We learn of Napoleon's parents, his father Carlo a 23 year old University student, and later a lawyer and Corsican politician, and his mother Litetsia, strong-willed mother of eight surviving children.  We learn of the capture of Corsica by the French.Then, the film discloses Napoleon's move to France at the age of nine, to begin schooling on a military scholarship, and later entrance in the Royal Military Academy in Paris at age 15.  We learn that he was teased at school, for being a foreigner from Corsica, and that he initially hated everything French.  At age 16, Napoleon started out his career at the age of 16, as a second lieutenant, learning to fire cannons and build gun carriages.  Briefly, Napoleon had second thoughts about a military career, and wrote a book about Corsica.  The French Revolution, with its dramatic milestone of July 14, 1789, and dismantling of the French institution of privileges, provided room for advancement in the military, especially for men (like Napoleon) having no particular connection with nobility.At the age of 23, Napoleon left the French army and entered politics in Corsica.  He led a political party that opposed an established, elderly politician (Pasquale Paoli), but this backfired, and Napoleon was exiled from Corsica.  On June 10, 1793, Napoleon left Corsica with his siblings and mother for France.  The film then provides commentary on Robespierre and the Reign of Terror.  At age 24, Napoleon became an artillery captain.  He was sent back south to Toulon, on the coast, to drive out the British.  His forces won, and at the age of 24, Napoleon was promoted to Brigadier General.But later on, he felt like he was in a career rut, and felt depressed.Later on, opportunity knocked.  There was a small rebellion in Paris (October 5, 1795), and Napoleon was called to put it down.  He did, and killed 100 French rebels, and three weeks later was promoted to full general (age 26).Then, Napoleon met Marie Josephe Rose de Beauharnais (known as ""Josephine""), a widow from Martinique, 32 years old with two children.  Her husband had died on the guillotine.  At that time, Josephine's boyfriend was a powerful Frenchman, Paul Berras.  For example, Paul Berras was paying her rent for her living quarters, a cottage.  Napoleon had his eyes on Josephine, because she was connected to many powerful men (her boyfriends) and because she had poise and charm.  They married on March 9, 1796.  The honeymoon lasted only two days, because he was asked to lead an army in Italy.  Napoleon was promoted (in part because of his connection to Paul Berras) to Supreme Commander of all French forces in Italy, where the mission was to drive the Austrian army out of northern Italy.On April 2, 1796, Napoleon led his soldiers against the Piedmontese in the mountains of Northern Italy.  His military technique was to spread out his soldiers, let them advance to the enemy, whereupon the soldiers would then converge in a focused location and attack.  On April 26, the Piedmontese surrendered.Then, the film provides some commentary about Napoleon's continual letters to Josephine.After defeating the Piedmontese, Napoleon marched to Lodi, an Italian town overrun by Austrian soldiers.  Both sides were lined up on opposite sides of a river, firing at each other.  Then, Napoleon crossed the bridge and drove the Austrians away (but did not actually defeat the Austrian army).  At that point, Napoleon began to think that he was invincible in military matters, and the people of France agreed with this assessment.On May 5, 1796, Napoleon entered Milan, a town in Northern Italy, and drove out the Austrian army.  Milan welcomed Napoleon as a liberator.  Napoleon made himself head of the provisional Italian government.  The first hour of the documentary concludes at this point.By the end of the four hour documentary, we learn that Napoleon's most important accomplishments were the establishment of the French Civil Code which codified the principles of the French Revolution and abolished feudal privileges, the establishment of the state secondary schools (lycees), the creation of Egyptology (24 volume book on Egypt; discovery of Rosetta Stone), and the building of canals, bridges, and reservoirs.However, we also learn that Napoleon was one of the more destructive nuisances in the history of the world, for example, because of his massacre of the Spanish, and because of his march upon Moscow.  Please also note that as Emperor, he ran a police state complete with a French version of the KGB (government spies) and forcibly prevented freedom of speech and of the press.FOUR STARS for the Napoleon disc from PBS Home Video.  The camera lovingly caresses each painting and black and white ink drawing.  The documentary does a good job at sticking to the facts of the subject matter at hand, namely, Napoleon and his main squeeze, Josephine.  The DVD dwells way too much on Josephine's hanky-panky, and on Napoleon's hanky-panky.  Hence, if I were a school teacher, I might hesitate in showing the DVD to my classroom.  The attention spent to Josephine is at the expense of more important matters.I have these criticisms.First, the disc needs a page showing thumbnail pictures of all of the paintings and drawings, with an identification of the titles and artists.Second, the disc fails to mention Napoleon's defeat at the hand of Toussaint L'Overture.  Toussaint L'Overture, a former slave, led an uprising against the French in St.Domingue (Haiti) and drove out the French by way of a slave rebellion.  At this time, St.Domingue was, for France, and extremely valuable source of sugar, cotton, and indigo.  Napoleon's wife, Josephine, had been born on the nearby island of Martinique, and her family owned a plantation on St.Domingue.  To view the big picture, what we see is a former slave defeating Napoleon, a man famed for taking control of Austria, Poland, and Italy.Third, the disc fails to mention the Louisiana Purchase.  In spring of 1803, Napoleon needed money to wage war against Egypt and the English.  So he decided to sell the Louisiana Territory to the U.S.  The price was 15 million dollars, and to get the money, Jefferson borrowed 15 million dollars from an English bank.  The goal of the English was to ensure that the French would never own territory south of Canada, while the French goal was to get money to fight the English.  The treaty of the Louisiana Purchase was signed in May 1803, and two months later, Jefferson sent Louis and Clark to explore the new territory.A disc from The History Channel, called THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, provides an excellent companion to the Napoleon disc.  FIVE STARS for the FRENCH REVOLUTION disc from The History Channel.But only FOUR STARS for the NAPOLEON disc from PBS HOME VIDEO.  NAPOLEON was produced by David Grubin.  Whatever possessed Mr.Grubin to omit Napoleon's relationships with the New World?  He fails to mention Napoleon's defeat at the hands of a former slave, and fails to mention the Louisiana Purchase.  There is way too much focus on Josephine. One gets the overall impression that Mr.Grubin was writing for a women's magazine, or for Dr.Phil, or for Oprah.  The disc contains way too much ""information"" about hanky-panky.  The disc sets a bad example to children.  The disc teaches children to dwell on hanky-panky, to contemplate hanky-panky, and to conclude that hanky-panky has some relevance to more substantial things, such as the conquest of one nation over another.",4,"The narrative  moves quickly, but totally omits Napoleon's affairs in the New World.",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,8629,"['disc', 'four', 'hours', 'commentary', 'two', 'hours', 'side',

However I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this 4 hour documentary which is all included on one double sided DVD. The documentary looks at Napoleon's life from the cradle to the grave and includes all facets of his life not just his military genius. That is not to say that Napoleons battles are ommitted as his major campaigns are examined and the reasons which brought them about (including his proposed invasion of Britain).Napoleon who was of Corsican birth orginally despised the French but in time came to love France and saw himself not only as defender of the revolution but almost as the crusade againsnt monarchism in Europe. Napoleon strongly beleived in his star and will power.The documentary makes great use of Napoleonic art work and historians from France, Russia, Germany, Britain and the USA (including Colonel John R Etling co author of ""A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars""). There are also some battle recreations but only on a small scale.The documentary does a fine job of trying to cover everything or is much as it can in 4 one hour parts, from childhood, solidering, Josephine, the Grand Army, changes brought about in France, master of Europe, exile and death.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this DVD and recommend it to anyone with an interest in history or the Napoleonic wars. The only disappointment was the colour quality, for red seemed to look more like purple on occassions.

561922,A3VIVMVN2Z7EUW,B00004ZB6O,W.Khan,"[29, 29]","This is a marvelously evocative and breathtakingly detailed look at the life of  &quot;the little Corsican&quot; who rose from nowhere to shake the very foundations of early 19th century Europe.The life of Napolean has held me spellbound ever since I first read Emil Ludwig's biography of Bonaparte when I was 13.Nothing has diminished that sense of awe and wonderment over the intervening years.Grubin's documentary has superlatively captured the sense of mystery that Goethe must have felt when he wrote that there has to be something more to Bonaprte's life than is conveyed in a standard biography . Grubin starts off with Corsica where Napolean was born to Italian parents who had fallen on hard times and follows in his footsteps to school in Paris where he was a lonely, miserable &amp; poor foreigner with a bad French accent .His quick rise through the ranks in the post revolutionary France is explained with some magnificent photography of the seige of Toulon (where he came to prominence for the first time).His love affair &amp; marriage to the coquetish &amp; fickle Josephine , campaigns in Italy and Egypt and his assumption of the French throne in 1805 are recreated against the background of breathtaking period costumes , paintings ,music and marvelous commentary from Napolean scholars .The latter half of the documentary deals with the consolidation of his power and the beginning of the end for him with the Peninsular war in Spain and the disastrous Russian campaign .His abdication and brief exile to Elba followed by his heroic escape to France and the &quot;100 day reign&quot; is probably the best part of the documentary .The battle of Waterloo is recreated in minute detail followed by his defeat and banishment to Elba where he died in 1821.This docudrama is a must see for all history buffs &amp; Bonaparte aficianados !",5,A cinematic coup !,975888000,"12 4, 2000",2000,1851,"['marvelously', 'evocative', 'breathtakingly', 'detailed', 'look', 'life', 'quot', 'little', 'Corsican', 'quot', 'who', 'rose', 'nowhere', 'shake', 'very', 'foundations', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'Europe.The', 'life', 'Napolean', 'held', 'ever', 'first', 'read', 'Emil', 'Ludwig', 'biography', 'Bonaparte', 'when', 'was', '13.Nothing', 'diminished', 'sense', 'awe', 'wonderment', 'intervening', 'years.Grubin', 'documentary', 'superlatively', 'captured', 'sense', 'mystery', 'Goethe', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'when', 'wrote', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'Bonaprte', 'life', 'conveyed', 'standard', 'biography', 'Grubin', 'Corsica', 'where', 'Napolean', 'was', 'born', 'Italian', 'parents', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'footsteps', 'school', 'Paris', 'where', 'was', 'lonely', 'miserable', 'amp', 'poor', 'foreigner', 'bad', 'French', 'accent', '.His', 'quick', 'rise', 'ranks', 'post', 'revolutionary', 'France', 'explained', 'magnificent', 'photography', 'seige', 'Toulon', 'where', 'came', 'prominence', 'first', 'time', '.His', 'love', 'affair', 'amp', 'marriage', 'coquetish', 'amp', 'fickle', 'Josephine', 'campaigns', 'Italy', 'Egypt', 'assumption', 'French', 'throne', '1805', 'are', 'recreated', 'background', 'breathtaking', 'period', 'costumes', 'paintings', 'music', 'marvelous', 'commentary', 'Napolean', '.The', 'latter', 'half', 'documentary', 'deals', 'consolidation', 'power', 'beginning', 'end', 'Peninsular', 'war', 'Spain', 'disastrous', 'Russian', 'campaign', '.His', 'abdication', 'brief', 'exile', 'Elba', 'followed', 'heroic', 'escape', 'France', 'quot', '100', 'day', 'reign', 'quot', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'documentary', '.The', 'battle', 'Waterloo', 'recreated', 'minute', 'detail', 'followed', 'defeat', 'banishment', 'Elba', 'where', 'died', '1821.This', 'docudrama', 'must', 'see', 'history', 'buffs', 'amp', 'Bonaparte', 'aficianados']",N/A
