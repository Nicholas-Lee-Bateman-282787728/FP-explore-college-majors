1022559,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B000IZJ20Q,Anne-Marie G,"[0, 0]","Goong/Princess Hours/Palace , call it what you will (I like Goong best, Princess Hours doesn't really make sense to me as a title and Palace is just the English word for Goong) is a Cinderella story.  It is based on the premise that Korea does actually have a monarchy.  Prince Shin goes to an arts high school along with our heroine, Chae Kyung (Yoon Eun Hye, who I had watched inThe 1st Shop of Coffee Prince). It is amazing to see her breadth of skill as an actress to play the exuberant and feminine Chae Kyung in this and the tom boyish and awkward Go Eun Chan in Coffee Prince.Prince Shin's father is sick (something the public doesn't know) in an effort to prepare the prince and the public for his impeding ascension to the throne it is decided the best PR move they can make is to marry him off.  Solidifying the monarchy and all that. He tries to get his secret girlfriend to marry him unsuccessfully, she wants to be a ballerina. This leaves him with the arranged marriage his grandfather set up. Lo! Who might that be but the klutzy Chae Kyung, who up until this point has only been a minor annoyance to Shin (She dumped dirty water all over his shoes--a bit of Cinderella reversal there and overheard his attempted proposal to ballerina girl).Chae Kyung upon hearing what is in store for her refuses to agree to the marriage and can't understand why Shin would agree to it. Enter the plot device: parents that don't know how to handle their own money.  Chae Kyung concedes to the wedding when she and her family have to fight off mobster collection agency thugs (her dad clearly made some bad investments). If she sacrifices herself her family will be safe and solvent.She has no idea what she is getting herself into though. It isn't just a wedding. She has to have princess lessons. And here is where I really wish I knew Korean, or at the very least there was a better way to subtitle their language in English.  English does not have the levels of formality that exist in Korean (or even in French). Relaxed common speech isn't allowed in the palace, but Chae Kyung has no experience speaking anything else.  Her relationships with Shin and other members of the royal family and the palace staff are represented in which level of formality her speech and theirs takes on.As the wedding is taking place Shin's exiled cousin returns to Korea. Yul was the original crown prince, but due to scandal he and his mother were expelled from the country by the king (Shin and Yul's grandfather) effectively removing him from the line of succession. Yul is charismatic and instantly drawn to Chae Kyung.  At fist he keeps his relationship to the royal family a secret, allowing him to develop a friendship with Chae Kyung. In other words, he is Shin's exact opposite. Shin is stiff and often resentful of Chae Kyung. Yul is probably my favorite second male lead. He is set up to be the villain but it becomes obvious he is just as much of a pawn as the others, his years of exile and his bitter mother have given him better coping mechanisms when dealing with the politics of palace life than either Shin of Chae Kyung have.Yul develops feelings for Chae Kyung at the same time Shin is melting towards his bride. Chae Kyung is blissfully unaware of both, but being as pure at heart as she is she clings to the hope that she and Shin can somehow make things work, if nothing else get along. Chae Kyung represents the kingship to both of them now, because her original betrothal was to Yul--as he was the original crown prince (and with his mother's nagging is slowly entering the ring to win his throne back). Both guys have a claim to her, but her marriage is to Shin.There are a few really fun things in this series.  The primary one being Chae Kyung, she is fun and bubbly watching Yoon Eun Hye play her and comparing her work in Coffee Prince you can really see what a master of physicality she is. The wide shots that show her goofing off, say with a hula hoop do more to convey who Chae Kyung is than many scenes with dialogue.  Shin and his teddy bear Alfred (who has little still photos at the end of each episode, reenacting or foreshadowing key events of the story-- I'm guessing this is whereMischievous Kissgot the idea).  He is emotionally stunted and only really relates to the world through the bear on any emotional level, something that Chae Kyung comes to understand.  And Yul.I did have to fast forward through scenes with Yul's evil mother after a while, I just didn't care about what she was doing, the politics of the story that were used as a contrivance to get the romantic triangle going really just aren't that interesting and their stakes aren't anything I am invested in.Overall still worth watching, but it has its slow moments. It isn't my favorite, however, I still enjoyed it for the most part.",4,"Good, but not Great",1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,4831,"['Goong/Princess', 'Hours/Palace', 'call', 'what', 'will', 'like', 'Goong', 'best', 'Princess', 'Hours', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'title', 'Palace', 'just', 'English', 'word', 'Goong', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'based', 'premise', 'Korea', 'actually', 'have', 'monarchy', 'Prince', 'Shin', 'arts', 'high', 'school', 'heroine', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'Yoon', 'Eun', 'Hye', 'who', 'had', 'watched', 'inThe', '1st', 'Shop', 'Coffee', 'Prince', 'amazing', 'see', 'breadth', 'skill', 'actress', 'play', 'exuberant', 'feminine', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'tom', 'boyish', 'awkward', 'Go', 'Eun', 'Chan', 'Coffee', 'Prince.Prince', 'Shin', 'father', 'sick', 'something', 'public', ""n't"", 'know', 'effort', 'prepare', 'prince', 'public', 'impeding', 'ascension', 'throne', 'decided', 'best', 'PR', 'move', 'can', 'make', 'marry', 'off', 'Solidifying', 'monarchy', 'get', 'secret', 'girlfriend', 'marry', 'unsuccessfully', 'be', 'ballerina', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'grandfather', 'set', 'up', 'Lo', 'Who', 'might', 'be', 'klutzy', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'who', 'up', 'point', 'only', 'been', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'Shin', 'dumped', 'dirty', 'water', 'shoes', 'bit', 'Cinderella', 'reversal', 'there', 'overheard', 'attempted', 'proposal', 'ballerina', 'girl', '.Chae', 'Kyung', 'hearing', 'what', 'store', 'refuses', 'agree', 'marriage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Shin', 'would', 'agree', 'Enter', 'plot', 'device', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'own', 'money', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'wedding', 'when', 'family', 'have', 'fight', 'off', 'mobster', 'collection', 'agency', 'thugs', 'dad', 'clearly', 'made', 'bad', 'investments', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'solvent.She', 'idea', 'what', 'getting', ""n't"", 'just', 'wedding', 'have', 'princess', 'lessons', 'here', 'where', 'really', 'wish', 'knew', 'Korean', 'very', 'least', 'was', 'better', 'way', 'subtitle', 'language', 'English', 'English', 'not', 'have', 'levels', 'formality', 'exist', 'Korean', 'even', 'French', 'Relaxed', 'common', 'speech', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'palace', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'experience', 'speaking', 'anything', 'else', 'relationships', 'Shin', 'other', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'palace', 'staff', 'are', 'represented', 'level', 'formality', 'speech', 'theirs', 'on.As', 'wedding', 'taking', 'place', 'Shin', 'exiled', 'cousin', 'returns', 'Korea', 'Yul', 'was', 'original', 'crown', 'prince', 'due', 'scandal', 'mother', 'were', 'expelled', 'country', 'king', 'Shin', 'Yul', 'grandfather', 'effectively', 'removing', 'line', 'succession', 'Yul', 'charismatic', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'fist', 'relationship', 'royal', 'family', 'secret', 'allowing', 'develop', 'friendship', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'other', 'words', 'Shin', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Shin', 'stiff', 'often', 'resentful', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'Yul', 'probably', 'favorite', 'second', 'male', 'lead', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'villain', 'obvious', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'pawn', 'others', 'years', 'exile', 'bitter', 'mother', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'coping', 'mechanisms', 'when', 'dealing', 'politics', 'palace', 'life', 'Shin', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'have.Yul', 'feelings', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'same', 'time', 'Shin', 'melting', 'bride', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'being', 'pure', 'heart', 'clings', 'hope', 'Shin', 'can', 'somehow', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'nothing', 'else', 'get', 'along', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'kingship', 'now', 'original', 'betrothal', 'was', 'Yul', 'was', 'original', 'crown', 'prince', 'mother', 'nagging', 'slowly', 'entering', 'ring', 'win', 'throne', 'back', 'guys', 'have', 'claim', 'marriage', 'Shin.There', 'are', 'few', 'really', 'fun', 'things', 'series', 'primary', 'one', 'being', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'fun', 'bubbly', 'watching', 'Yoon', 'Eun', 'Hye', 'play', 'comparing', 'work', 'Coffee', 'Prince', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'master', 'physicality', 'wide', 'shots', 'show', 'goofing', 'off', 'say', 'hula', 'hoop', 'do', 'more', 'convey', 'who', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'many', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'Shin', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Alfred', 'who', 'little', 'still', 'photos', 'end', 'episode', 'reenacting', 'foreshadowing', 'key', 'events', 'story', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'whereMischievous', 'Kissgot', 'idea', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'only', 'really', 'world', 'bear', 'emotional', 'level', 'something', 'Chae', 'Kyung', 'understand', 'Yul.I', 'did', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'scenes', 'Yul', 'evil', 'mother', 'while', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'politics', 'story', 'were', 'used', 'contrivance', 'get', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'going', 'really', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'stakes', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'am', 'invested', 'in.Overall', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'slow', 'moments', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'however', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part']",Palace

The crown prince, Shin, enters into a pre-arranged marriage with  commoner, Chae-Kyeong in his high school.She is no Cinderella---in fact, she is a sometimes annoyingly obnoxious 'ugly duckling', and some of the kids at school rudely call her that.As the story goes on, you see hints of the emerging swan as she struggles to grow up in a very difficult situation. Her new young husband has a pretty girlfriend at their school, (horribly embarrassing) which everyone knows about, and palace life is very rigid and strict. She is very lonely, only allowed to see her family when her husband permits it, since she is his responsibility absolutely, as he occasionally has to remind his parents, the King and Queen.Shins cousin, Prince Yul, who is second in line for the throne, is in Chae-Kyeongs homeroom class, and falls in  love with  her at first sight, because ugly duckling or not, he thinks she is very cute, and this complicates palace life even more. Especially as her husband notices almost right after they are married that she may not be quite the ugly duckling everyone thinks she is, and in fact is sometimes quite beautiful, and is sweet.This has an epic feel to it as it is 24 episodes, quite long, but never dull.The grandmother (Queen Mother) in this story is a real jewel, and seems to be the only adult royal who understands and sympathizes with the struggling teen-agers---this is the way of Grandmas, isn't it?Buy the YA Entertainment version for understandable subs.

When a young girl Chae-kyeong(19) learns that she is the fiancee of prince Lee Shin, she is shocked and surprised. She eventually agrees to marry him to help her family who is about to go bankrupt. Unfortunately prince Lee Shin is a difficult young man to like, and Prince Yool (his cousin) has also fallen for her. Will Chae-Kyeong win her husband's heart or is she destined for heartbreak?Thus begins a love triangle which takes up most of this film. I admit, although I found Prince Lee Shin hot, I preferred Prince Yool for his devoted qualities. Some of the things Lee tells Chae-Kyeong are pretty terrible. Also some of the costumes were really outrageous.I enjoyed Chae-Kyeong. The actress who plays her is fantastic and her facial expressions are great.
