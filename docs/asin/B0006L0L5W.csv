However, for my family that is the beauty of ""Baby Monet"" it provides subtle natural colors and soothing music. As the title indicates the video revolves around the changing of the seasons and how they bring new experiences. Spring brings flowers and rain, Summer is full of warmth.... and so one.What we love about Baby Monet is that it is a very soothing video. It is perfect for when our daughter is a bit fussy or when she is ready for bed. My wife and I actually enjoy watching the video with our daughter since it is very relaxing. We could do without the puppet giraffes, but we do enjoy watching the changing colors and tones that are introduced with each season.Final Verdict - I could see how Baby Monet may not hold the attention of a 2-year old boy., but for our 6-month old daughter is *almost* the only video that she watches!5 Stars",5,Very Tranquil,1269734400,"03 28, 2010",2010,927,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'correct', 'not', 'most', 'exciting', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'Video', 'However', 'family', 'beauty', 'Baby', 'Monet', 'subtle', 'natural', 'colors', 'soothing', 'music', 'title', 'video', 'changing', 'seasons', 'how', 'bring', 'new', 'experiences', 'Spring', 'flowers', 'rain', 'Summer', 'full', 'warmth', 'so', 'love', 'Baby', 'Monet', 'very', 'soothing', 'video', 'perfect', 'when', 'daughter', 'bit', 'fussy', 'when', 'ready', 'bed', 'wife', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'video', 'daughter', 'very', 'relaxing', 'could', 'do', 'puppet', 'giraffes', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'changing', 'colors', 'tones', 'are', 'introduced', 'season.Final', 'Verdict', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'Baby', 'Monet', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'attention', '2-year', 'old', 'boy.', '6-month', 'old', 'daughter', 'only', 'video', '5', 'Stars']",N/A

The seasons are clearly defined and each season is assigned its own zebra puppet colored to match the season. (For example, Fall is orange with deep, royal purple stripes) The puppet shows in this one are really cute and humorous. My son is 7 months and laughs out loud at some of them.I think the imagery is great. It does capture my son's attention. This one is a little different than the other ones, but it is well done. They go through all of the seasons, there is a little intro where they introduce the season and the season's puppet mascot. THen they go into the imagery similar to the other movies. There is a puppet show and then they go to the next season. At the end, there is a seasonal montage featuring the puppets and my son really loves that. There is an upbeat musical number and the puppets dance around so my son tries to wiggle around with the puppets.The music is great. An obvious choice of course, but they matched the tempo of the music to the images well.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't have enough Monet paintings to be called baby monet. I had to go back and watch it again because I didn't notice it enough. Once you go back through it, you notice it, but there really isn't that much. I get that is says Monet- seasons, but the Van Gogh-colors relies heavily on the Van Gogh paintings to get the point across. Not so much with this one.

There is some gorgeous footage of the changing seasons (where you see a solitary waterfall, or a tree morphing through the four seasons), but the rest of the DVD is a disgusting and painful wail of a flick.  First of all Julie Clark gets underused.  You briefly hear her little pixie voice, but she never gets to recite any of her whimsical, pretty, poetry.  Then there are these less-than-cute zebra puppets.  Their day glo colors are annoying.  The tall zebra should have been paired with something friendly and small and round--instead of that horrible bird.  Colorful zebras bouncing up and down are a bore.  The puppets do this dated endless dance ""with attitude"" (yawn) toward the end of the DVD that will make you want to throw baby food at the television!  The zebras are superimposed over gorgeous footage that gets soiled with their day-glo presence.  Most of the puppet jokes are awful (especially the one with the blow dryer).  The video has relatively few toys and mobiles in it and the footage it uses of babies looks like a string of the bad outtakes that should have been dumped in the waste can.  The DVD also recylces old Baby Einstein music and mixes it with some ho-hum new stuff.  For the sake of the series, Disney should give complete creative control back to Julie Clark for the next 3 DVDs, hire Markie Post to do the puppets again, and get Bill W. to do ALL the music.  The credits at the end of this DVD are too long.

It was kind of a long introduction.  This has mostly live-action of things in nature, not as many toys as most Baby Einstein's videos; which is nice.

I don't think there was anything with holidays, which is good for those that don't celebrate the holidays (Baby's First Imprssions Seasons had a lot of that).  Maybe I just can't appreciate certain artists work but I really did not care at all for the Monet paintings in this video.
