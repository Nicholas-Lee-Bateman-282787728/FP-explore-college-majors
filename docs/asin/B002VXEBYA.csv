The highlights are edited so it feels like a watching a movie. They spend much more time on the playoff games and the Superbowl. The entire movie is narrated giving it the documentary feel. The special features are really nice too, most of them are not longer the ten min, but there well worth watching. It looks great on blu-ray and sounds good.

I gave this Five stars because of the quality of what was presented. Each game was adequatley covered with suffcient plays to give the viewer the feel of the game, although some games had plays shown out of order to drive home a point. The picture quality is superb, with multiple angles shown for key plays. But the real treat is the sound. From local Saints announcer Jim Henderson's calls (""It's good!!!! It's good!!! Pigs have flown, Hell has frozen over, the Saints are in the Super Bowl!""), to Coach Payton calling and predicting plays and making insighful comments (describing the on sides kick to referees before the start of the game and encouraging young kicker Garrett Hartley to kick the game winning field goal in the Vikings playoff game ""You belong here""), to Scott Fujita egging on Peyton Manning (""Hey Peyton, I can eat Oreo cookies faster than you""), to Reggie Bush on the sideline predicting a Piere Thomas Super Bowl touchdown on a screen pass and celebrating as if he had scored himself, to the post-game celebrations. Everything presented is of five star quality.The only problem is it leaves you wanting more. I would have liked more highlights from each game and was disappointed in the brief segment of the Saints history, which quickly showed Archie Manning having hard luck and fans wearing bags over their heads. You do not feel the pain and frustration brought on by the stumbling Saints of old. Nor do you get to relive the truly great moments. No John Gilliam returning the opening kickoff of the team's first game for a touchdown. No Tom Dempsey kicking his game winning record setting 63-yard field goal.The extra segments also leave you wanting more. But a review should review what is present in the film and not harp on what is missing. You get the key plays of each game of the Saints spectacular season with pristine images and the exciting calls of the local radio broadcasters. It's a film Saints fans can and will watch over and over again, particualrly during the summer when there is no live NFL football to watch.",5,Super Highlights Bring Back Fond Memories,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,2214,"['knew', 'advance', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'highlighting', 'Saints', '2009', 'championship', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'entire', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'broadcast', 'gave', 'Five', 'stars', 'quality', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'game', 'was', 'adequatley', 'covered', 'suffcient', 'plays', 'give', 'viewer', 'feel', 'game', 'games', 'had', 'plays', 'shown', 'order', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'picture', 'quality', 'superb', 'multiple', 'angles', 'shown', 'key', 'plays', 'real', 'treat', 'sound', 'local', 'Saints', 'announcer', 'Jim', 'Henderson', 'calls', 'good', 'good', 'Pigs', 'have', 'flown', 'Hell', 'frozen', 'Saints', 'are', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Coach', 'Payton', 'calling', 'predicting', 'plays', 'making', 'insighful', 'comments', 'describing', 'sides', 'kick', 'referees', 'start', 'game', 'encouraging', 'young', 'kicker', 'Garrett', 'Hartley', 'kick', 'game', 'winning', 'field', 'goal', 'Vikings', 'playoff', 'game', 'belong', 'here', 'Scott', 'Fujita', 'egging', 'Peyton', 'Manning', 'Hey', 'Peyton', 'can', 'eat', 'Oreo', 'cookies', 'faster', 'Reggie', 'Bush', 'sideline', 'predicting', 'Piere', 'Thomas', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'touchdown', 'screen', 'pass', 'celebrating', 'had', 'scored', 'post-game', 'celebrations', 'Everything', 'presented', 'five', 'star', 'quality.The', 'only', 'problem', 'wanting', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'highlights', 'game', 'was', 'disappointed', 'brief', 'segment', 'Saints', 'history', 'quickly', 'showed', 'Archie', 'Manning', 'having', 'hard', 'luck', 'fans', 'wearing', 'bags', 'heads', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'pain', 'frustration', 'brought', 'stumbling', 'Saints', 'old', 'do', 'get', 'relive', 'truly', 'great', 'moments', 'John', 'Gilliam', 'returning', 'opening', 'kickoff', 'team', 'first', 'game', 'touchdown', 'Tom', 'Dempsey', 'kicking', 'game', 'winning', 'record', 'setting', '63-yard', 'field', 'goal.The', 'extra', 'segments', 'also', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'review', 'should', 'review', 'what', 'present', 'film', 'not', 'harp', 'what', 'missing', 'get', 'key', 'plays', 'game', 'Saints', 'spectacular', 'season', 'pristine', 'images', 'exciting', 'calls', 'local', 'radio', 'broadcasters', 'film', 'Saints', 'fans', 'can', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'particualrly', 'summer', 'when', 'live', 'NFL', 'football', 'watch']",N/A
1296441,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B002VXEBYA,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[0, 0]","The New Orleans Saints Super Bowl XLIV highlight package is rather average, but a bit better than the last few years.  Of course, for any New Orleans fan it is a great keepsake, no doubt.The feature of all the team specific Super Bowl highlight packages is about an hour long highlights reel of the New Orleans Saints regular season.  This year's edition does a decent job of showing the key highlights of every regular season game.  It moves at a much faster clip than most years, or at least seems to, and doesn't even tease at making an attempt at building up any drama, which is the greatest failure of most of these highlight packages.  But unlike many previous years, where the film unsuccessfully feigns drama building, at least in this one you get what you get, a nice, fast paced journey through the New Orleans Saints' 2009 season.  There is nothing particularly special about it, unless you are a Saints fan, and is entertaining enough if you are not.This edition, however, does a horrific job of building up any of the drama of the Saints' postseason.  It certainly shows all the Saints highlights from the Saints point of view.  But the drama building, especially of the Saints very close playoff win against the Minnesota Vikings, and their very close (despite the final score of 31-17) Super Bowl win over the Indianapolis Colts is simply a joke.  You'd think the overtime victory against the Vikings and the win against the Colts were undramatic, almost foregone conclusions watching this compilation.  It just does a completely lousy job of it.Worse yet, there are very few close breakdowns of dramatic plays and events during the season, and of the NFC Championship and Super Bowl wins.  It's just a simply a highlights reel from the Saints' perspective, and that is about it.The Bonus Features are also a huge let down. You get the postgame celebrations, NFL media day, the halftime show, and a short personal close-up of the travails of Saints defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove, which is really the best of the Bonus Features.  The Bonus Features are simply thin and not very good.The Saints made history with their first and rather dramatic win in Super Bowl XLIV.  While any Saints and NFL fan will enjoy the journey, the video robs the viewer of just what an amazing and dramatic run it really was.",3,New Orleans Saints: Super Bowl XLIV Champions: Another Average NFL Films Production,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,2321,"['New', 'Orleans', 'Saints', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLIV', 'highlight', 'package', 'rather', 'average', 'bit', 'better', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'course', 'New', 'Orleans', 'fan', 'great', 'keepsake', 'doubt.The', 'feature', 'team', 'specific', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'highlight', 'packages', 'hour', 'long', 'highlights', 'reel', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Saints', 'regular', 'season', 'year', 'edition', 'decent', 'job', 'showing', 'key', 'highlights', 'regular', 'season', 'game', 'much', 'faster', 'clip', 'most', 'years', 'least', ""n't"", 'even', 'tease', 'making', 'attempt', 'building', 'up', 'drama', 'greatest', 'failure', 'most', 'highlight', 'packages', 'many', 'previous', 'years', 'where', 'film', 'unsuccessfully', 'feigns', 'drama', 'building', 'least', 'one', 'get', 'what', 'get', 'nice', 'fast', 'paced', 'journey', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Saints', '2009', 'season', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', 'are', 'Saints', 'fan', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'are', 'not.This', 'edition', 'however', 'horrific', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'drama', 'Saints', 'postseason', 'certainly', 'Saints', 'highlights', 'Saints', 'point', 'view', 'drama', 'building', 'especially', 'Saints', 'very', 'close', 'playoff', 'win', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', 'very', 'close', 'final', 'score', '31-17', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'win', 'Indianapolis', 'Colts', 'simply', 'joke', ""'d"", 'think', 'overtime', 'victory', 'Vikings', 'win', 'Colts', 'were', 'undramatic', 'almost', 'foregone', 'conclusions', 'watching', 'compilation', 'just', 'completely', 'lousy', 'job', 'it.Worse', 'yet', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'close', 'breakdowns', 'dramatic', 'plays', 'events', 'season', 'NFC', 'Championship', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'just', 'simply', 'highlights', 'reel', 'Saints', 'perspective', 'it.The', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'are', 'also', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'get', 'postgame', 'celebrations', 'NFL', 'media', 'day', 'halftime', 'show', 'short', 'personal', 'close-up', 'travails', 'Saints', 'defensive', 'tackle', 'Anthony', 'Hargrove', 'really', 'best', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'are', 'simply', 'thin', 'not', 'very', 'good.The', 'Saints', 'made', 'history', 'first', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'win', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLIV', 'Saints', 'NFL', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'journey', 'video', 'viewer', 'just', 'what', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'run', 'really', 'was']",N/A
