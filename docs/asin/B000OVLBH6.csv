1066348,A257UC0ST4FFAY,B000OVLBH6,"80sLady ""PRG""","[2, 3]","I was so happy when I heard that they were re-releasing ""Silver Spoons"".  It was one of my favorite series growing up as a child.  I watched the entire first season in one day!In the series premiere, twelve year old Ricky Stratton unexpectedly turns up on the doorstep of his father Edward Stratton the third, who had no idea that he even had a son.  It turns out that Ricky was a product of Edward's during his six day marriage to Evelyn. The mom had Ricky shipped off to military school after her second marriage. At first it looks like Edward who (according to him) doesn't know how to be a good husband, father, son etc.. is about to abandon Ricky too but he quickly realizes that having Ricky around is a lot better than NOT having him around - plus, now childlike Edward's finally got someone to play with!Throughout the season, there are guest appearances that are made by other tv greats like Mr. T and Gary Coleman aka Arnold Jackson from Diff'rent Strokes.  Ricky's friend/foe is Derek (Jason Bateman) whom I think can best be described as a wolf in sheep's clothing.This sitcom was a true gem in TV history.

1066351,AJ3AFY1JZHD7Q,B000OVLBH6,Classic Lover,"[5, 6]","Silver Spoons was one of definitive eighties time capsule. This series was pure eighties, break dancing, big hair, music, posters. Ricky Schroder shines his title role, and he surrounded many well-remembered characters. Even legendary actor John Houseman appeared and Erin Gray really made big impression with her stepmother role. But, my favorite character is probably Rick's pal played by Alfonso Ribeiro. He was funny character. Everytime He appeared, there was some kind of funny things happened. Yes, by the today's standards, it's maybe cheesy but you certainly agree it's lot of fun, and I believe eighties will never duplicated.I had many fine memories with eighties, and Silver Spoons was certainly one of them. If you're eighties growing-up kids, you'll love this dvd set. I can't wait to see those fun adventures with Rick and family, friends again after all these years.

In the first few episodes, one can see the Rubik's Cube, mentioning the movie E.T., classic arcade games such as Pac-Man, etc.  One can also see a VERY young Jason Bateman who was sooooooo cute on the show and even Gary Coleman from Diff'rent Strokes makes an appearance on ""The Great Computer Caper"" episode.  My favorite episode is ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"" mainly because Jason is seen throughout the entire episode!!  :D  SUPERB acting, Jason, for your character as Derek Taylor!!!  You've should've gotten just as much publicity as Ricky Schroder did if not MORE!!!  And also because I remember seeing this one when 'Spoons first aired.I highly recommend this to anyone who's a Jason Bateman or a Ricky Schroder fan (like myself) or to someone who also likes shows such as Growing Pains, Who's the Boss, Punky Brewster, etc.  Please, Sony Pictures, bring us Seasons 2-4 soon.

I have all of these episodes taped from way back when I was a kid when the generation of the VHS (recorders came out). and that was not long after 1982 when Spoons began. I had to wait until reruns so I could tape them but it was worth all the wait. Now the tapes are dragging but (NO MORE). Sony did it! I know this will make Rick,Joel,Erin,Jason,Alfonso,Corky proud that this was released. Oh, and lets not forget the sly Christine Belford (Ricks Mom)..and, If only Mr houseman were alive. He made that show as well. He was (the greatest Grandfather). the bond between Rick and his grandfather was so great. ""Gotta love the learning to drive episode"". There are also some great guests on the show, Including Whitney houston,Mr T,Gary Coleman,Pearl Bailey and the ever so popular Menudo. This show makes you laugh,Cry,get angry like I did when Rick told freddy Lippincottleman that he wasnt his friend lol. The hardest thing in the world to see was derek leaving the show. That episode was very emotional. I was feeling at first that it wasnt going to be the same but the show was great from start to finish. For all you new people that are going to buy this....You are in for a real treat! Rick Schroder,(Ricker) youre an awesome actor!R.I.P for two great actors franklin seales,John HousemanPS: For those of you that worry that you have to buy so many sets that you might lose interest in this (do not worry) This show ran from 82 to 1987 so not many sets to buy. Please buy this so that Sony will continue to release them. I promise you wont be let down. Every season is great! of course the first three seasons are my favorite and rick grows in every season but all of them have a very good story!(ADDED NOTE) I got the DVD set today and let me tell you...Brilliant picture quality. Fine remastering.  I am so pleased to toss out my first two VHS tapes that has the first season on them. I kept them because I was a little worried that they were going to edit the show's ending like they do sometime on tv for air time but sony did not butcher the show. silver spoons lovers will be very happy with what sony has presented us with this set.

Ricky decides to leave the boarding school and move in with his father. Edward refuses to have him live with him at first-He sends Ricky back to the Military school. However, he changes his mind and goes to pick up Ricky himself dressed as a swamp creature!Edward is an adult that never grew up. He lives in a mansion. His Living room is equipped with toys, video arcade games, a computerized chess set-and the ever popular mini freight train that is used to get to one room to another. The premise of this show(At first)was that Edward could teach Ricky to be more of a kid and Ricky could teach Edward to be less of a kid.Ricky is a remarkable young man. He is very smart-and knows a lot about computers(This is 1982-Windows was still years away)yet he isn't a smart alec know it all. He has a self confidence and assertiveness to stand up for himself-whether it's the bully at school, or a 12 year old toy consultant that Edward wants to hire-she won't sign the contract unless he agrees to be his girl freind. He agrees at first-but things goes to far-Edward decides to let Ricky handle it his own way. HE doesn't allow himself to be bullied or taken advantage of. Ricky is such an adorable young man and he's so cute and has an infectious smile.This doesn't mean that Ricky is a perfect too gooder. He gets into situations that any kid gets into. Like testing Edward to see how far he can go before Edward Puninhes him for bad behaviour-or sneaking out at night to search for a primate like creature rumoured to be in the area. Yet, he learns his lesson at the end of the episode.There are some impressive guest stars on this show-Jason Bateman is Ricky's arogant pal-Derek, Erin Gray is Edward's Loyal seretary-Kate summers-who he eventualy marries. And John Houseman is Edward's Father-Edward Stratton the second-who is bitter and disaproves of Edwards lifestlye. I guess having assets of 30 million as shown in the pilot isn't enough for him. Ricky is caught in the middle of the conflict between Edward and his father.I love the scenes Between Edward the second and Ricky. John Houseman and Ricky Schroder had great chemistry, that the writers have written long scenes between the two. Ricky has great respect for his grandfather-yet he isn't afraid to tell him the truth as he sees it. No matter how bitter he is towards his son-he is fond of Ricky-even if he doesn't show it. Deep down inside, he loves his son and Edward loves his father. The scenes between Ricky and Grandfather are quite remarkable-and well written.Ricky Schorder is a lot more than just adorable-he is extremly talented. He is such a good actor and has shown he can do comedy as well as drama. So far only the first season is on DVD and has 22 episodes-including the pilot on 3 single sided discs-There are no special features but that doesn't matter-I'm just glad the first season is on DVD.
