Some of his theories may have been dis-proven, and Erich von Daniken may have been called out as a liar by the scientific community, I don't know. But I DO know that his book/movie has changed the way I look at the world, even the universe itself. I have been convinced from childhood that the gods of myth were not as varied as many thought. I noticed similarities in deities and stories from across the globe, between cultures that would never have had a chance of meeting each other; I feel that either the same groups of gods oversaw multiple cultures, or aliens visiting the planet did the same thing. It makes a lot of sense to me, and the people I have shown this DVD to agree with me. Like I said, even if some of his theories and evidence have been shot down, there are still far too many mysteries to explain any other way. I know without a doubt that we are not alone in this universe, and it would be arrogant to think otherwise. We have at least attempted to go to other planets--isn't it natural to think that other beings from elsewhere would try the same thing? Is it so outrageous to even entertain the notion that a couple of them might have succeeded in reaching our planet? How do you think ancient civilizations would react to strange creatures emerging from the sky?You don't have to believe von Daniken. But please, don't be so elitist as to assume that humans are alone in the universe and that no other being could do the same things we have managed to accomplish. It is a huge universe out there, and we have no clue who else is sharing it with us or what they are capable of doing.

My memory told me of this great flick, great visuals, great concepts (even if a little wild), and a flick I remember caused me to really think about this topic for a while.What my memory failed to remind me of is just how aweful the music is, some of that horrible late 60's pseudo-Jazz that nearly ruins the best of movies.

The one redeeeming quality is that all of the footage of the ruins and symbols, rock carvings/art, and such are all raw footage, no enhancements, no computer simulated look, no clean of up the images, it is like you were there and looking at the stuff and there is something to say for that, not a lot, but something.I have been to about 20% of the places they highlight and will say that they give you a view you will never see unless you go and one no tourist brochure will ever show you, you know, the stuff that when you go makes you think, and this is all it is?I must also credit this flick for mainstreaming, so to speak, the notion that the Earth was populated or at least visited by aliens.If you want to see the flick that started the UFO visited the earth seed movie then this is still one to have in your collection.One last note, no documentary review would be complete without at least a glancing review of the presentation of the material, their ""proof"" so to speak.

We talked about what we saw for months and still revisit those talks to this day.I love the theme music in this movie and the professionalism of the narration, it's akin to Bruce Brown's Endless Summer, so I would label this as the Endless Summer for us Ancient Alien geeks.  It's a shame more movies of this type don't follow this pattern, they are a lot of fun to immerse yourself in and it never gets boring.When I was a kid my friend would take me with his family to Church with them.  I told them about this movie and they basically ridiculed me for believing such things.  Well, to make a long story short, within 10 years they were no longer going to Church and stated that they didn't believe ""that stuff"" any longer.  Where as I am still a firm believer in Jesus Christ as the Son of God & Savior of us all.  I credit such things as this movie for making me a more educated and open minded person.  You see, I believe these Ancient Astronauts actually existed.  However, I believe they are the fallen angels spoken of in the Bible that created a hybrid race of beings our ancient mythologies called Gods and Titans.There is nothing new under the sun, and all things do fit together if you are willing to be open minded and take the time to piece it all together.  I thank people like Daniken & Sitchin for all the hard work they've done in bringing this knowledge to us.  We don't have to accept their theories per say, but we should always accept the evidence and use it to make up our own minds.And I feel sorry for all the close minded people who are missing out on a real adventure by not embracing things that at first seem threatening and too much of a challenge for them.",5,Entertaining adventure through ancient times,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,1795,"['dad', 'took', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'theaters', 'back', 'early', '70', 'talked', 'what', 'saw', 'months', 'still', 'revisit', 'talks', 'day.I', 'love', 'theme', 'music', 'movie', 'professionalism', 'narration', 'akin', 'Bruce', 'Brown', 'Endless', 'Summer', 'would', 'label', 'Endless', 'Summer', 'Ancient', 'Alien', 'geeks', 'shame', 'more', 'movies', 'type', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'pattern', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'immerse', 'never', 'boring.When', 'was', 'kid', 'friend', 'would', 'take', 'family', 'Church', 'told', 'movie', 'basically', 'ridiculed', 'believing', 'such', 'things', 'Well', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', '10', 'years', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'going', 'Church', 'stated', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'stuff', 'longer', 'Where', 'am', 'still', 'firm', 'believer', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Son', 'God', 'Savior', 'credit', 'such', 'things', 'movie', 'making', 'more', 'educated', 'open', 'minded', 'person', 'see', 'believe', 'Ancient', 'Astronauts', 'actually', 'existed', 'However', 'believe', 'are', 'fallen', 'angels', 'spoken', 'Bible', 'created', 'hybrid', 'race', 'beings', 'ancient', 'mythologies', 'called', 'Gods', 'Titans.There', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'things', 'do', 'fit', 'together', 'are', 'willing', 'be', 'open', 'minded', 'take', 'time', 'piece', 'together', 'thank', 'people', 'Daniken', 'Sitchin', 'hard', 'work', ""'ve"", 'done', 'bringing', 'knowledge', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'accept', 'theories', 'say', 'should', 'always', 'accept', 'evidence', 'use', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds.And', 'feel', 'sorry', 'close', 'minded', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'real', 'adventure', 'not', 'embracing', 'things', 'first', 'seem', 'threatening', 'too', 'much', 'challenge']",N/A

Stonehenge, for example, is completely missing, even though the focus of the film is on the mystery of moving massive stone blocks great distances. The flight over Plains of Nazca, which sport mysterious drawings that can only be seen from the air, and the Easter Island footage, are perhaps the most interesting parts of the film.Part of the problem with this 1972 effort is that it was obviously shot for a German audience, and then translated for American audiences. Everything is done in voice-overs, so we do not really hear what the ""experts"" are trying to tell us.The voice-overs add to the frustration of watching the film. Many questions are raised, but there seems to be no real case being made by the producers. The ""evidence"" being offered is simply a question with no answer. Basically, they're saying, ""Is it old and mysterious? Must have been aliens!""Of course, no one watches this sort of film for any kind of real scientific education. The theories put forward here have been debunked quite thouroughly, and a zillion times over. The fun in watching this kind of film is in seeing how people only a few decades ago could buy into just about anything that could be labeled as ""Unknown"" or an ""Ancient Mystery"". Unfortunately, while this film is one of the earliest examples of the psuedo-science documentary genre, it is not one of the most entertaining.One interesting facet of the film is that several Russian ""experts"" were interviewed, an odd inclusion for a US audience at the height of the Cold War. On the other hand, the Russians depicted here were hardly legit, so perhaps the government or whoever figured that that worked in our favor.The promo for the film, included on the DVD, is classic early 70's advertising, and sadly, better than the film itself.",2,The Gods do not make their case...,1032739200,"09 23, 2002",2002,2153,"['One', 'earliest', 'examples', 'pseudo-science', 'documentary', 'genre', 'famous', 'infamous', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'poses', 'many', 'questions', 'little', 'are', 'fascinating', 'sites', 'world', 'visited', 'here', 'such', 'Easter', 'Island', 'several', 'sites', 'Bolivia', 'Egypt', 'Peru', 'are', 'also', 'things', 'strangely', 'left', 'out', 'Stonehenge', 'example', 'completely', 'missing', 'even', 'focus', 'film', 'mystery', 'moving', 'massive', 'stone', 'great', 'distances', 'flight', 'Plains', 'Nazca', 'sport', 'mysterious', 'drawings', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'air', 'Easter', 'Island', 'footage', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'film.Part', 'problem', '1972', 'effort', 'was', 'obviously', 'shot', 'German', 'audience', 'then', 'translated', 'American', 'audiences', 'Everything', 'done', 'voice-overs', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'hear', 'what', 'experts', 'are', 'trying', 'tell', 'us.The', 'voice-overs', 'add', 'frustration', 'watching', 'film', 'Many', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'there', 'be', 'real', 'case', 'being', 'made', 'producers', 'evidence', 'being', 'offered', 'simply', 'question', 'answer', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'saying', 'old', 'mysterious', 'Must', 'have', 'been', 'aliens', 'course', 'one', 'sort', 'film', 'kind', 'real', 'scientific', 'education', 'theories', 'put', 'forward', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'debunked', 'quite', 'thouroughly', 'zillion', 'times', 'fun', 'watching', 'kind', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'people', 'only', 'few', 'decades', 'ago', 'could', 'buy', 'just', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'labeled', 'Unknown', 'Ancient', 'Mystery', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'one', 'earliest', 'examples', 'psuedo-science', 'documentary', 'genre', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining.One', 'interesting', 'facet', 'film', 'several', 'Russian', 'experts', 'were', 'interviewed', 'odd', 'inclusion', 'US', 'audience', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'other', 'hand', 'Russians', 'depicted', 'here', 'were', 'hardly', 'legit', 'so', 'perhaps', 'government', 'whoever', 'figured', 'worked', 'favor.The', 'promo', 'film', 'included', 'DVD', 'classic', 'early', '70', 'advertising', 'sadly', 'better', 'film']",N/A

This book goes in comparison to say. He could be right in his words. These mind-boggling facts he has brought have some punch. I've read some of the 1 star comments and found academic idiots don't want to come out and think out-of-the-box. I would say if they were to be born in Galileo's time, they would vote for execution of Galileo's for his findings that earth was not the center of the universe or it's not flat but round. They would still persist that they're taught earth was flat and it should be flat whilst reality differing them from eons. Why people just come into conclusion and attack anybody? Because they lack patience and knowledge. This book tries to provoke no-religion concept and may be for some it's offending. We are so attached to our own religious belief-system that we don't want to hear anything except what we've read or heard since our childhood. Science and religion converge. This book lets you open your mindset and compel you to think something else. May be author sounded bit imposing for the words used but for anyone with little common sense, it should not be insulting.

Particularly catching are the shoots of the Mayan civilizations, especially the Temple of the Sun.

504434,A1UQSWIX25P59F,B00000IO3U,RRskaReb,"[27, 32]","A film that makes you go 'Hmmmm'.I first saw Chariots of the Gods in a theater as a kid when it was re-released back in the mid Seventies.  I remember having trouble going to sleep that night!  Since then I have attained a degree in science, and still think that it has much merit.Sadly, this is a film that few people seem to be able to see anymore, at least I haven't noticed it making the rounds on mainstream television or cable in the last twenty five years or so.The transfer was excellent and made from a well-preserved print.  I noticed few flaws in this thirty-five or so year old film.  There is an extra of pictures, but there are only like eight pictures?  Why bother?  That part was like a carnival sideshow ripoff.  Also, the bio on von Daniken is a short text of one page and was not informative at all.  There are scene selections and true to their word a movie trailer.The film is an interesting whirlwind of exotic location shots that if nothing else shows the viewer some very interesting sites.  The musical score is hard to describe-in a sense it is eerie, but it also has an overall upbeat, 'hopeful' or optimistic tone.  I get the impression that this film was not made originally in English?  I do like the narrator's (male) voice and keeps your attention.  There are also a few places where the narration is handled in an interesting manner.  Also, the actual filming and editing was excellent and well thought out.  It's as if there is a new surprise awaiting you around every corner.The documentary also includes some support from a couple of other individuals, one of whom was a Soviet scientist and I found this to be rather interesting given the times.  But I feel that von Daniken's arguments supported by the visual evidence were more than compelling on their own.I can't help but to compare this film to a Nova episode that dealt specifically with von Daniken's book and thus many of the things in this film.  A few things, at least in the book, were shown to be out and out fabrications.  I seem to remember Nova trying to provide an alternative explanation for such things as (don't quote me...been many years) the 'Baghdad Batteries'.  Since then I have seen these batteries presented as being exactly as what they appear to be by science-ancient batteries.In fact, it seemed that the makers of the Nova film were in an Okham's Razor competition with von Daniken in trying to provide rational, simple explanations for rather exceptional ancient works of art, stories and artifacts.  I think it was mostly a tie.  'We' still don't know how or why the Pyramids, nor Stonehenge, the Nazca Lines nor many many other things were built in ancient times.  Shame on von Daniken for not giving our ancient ancestors very much credit for coming up with these technologies themselves, but the same can be said for mainstream science which seems to be more and more in the position that ancient peoples were more advanced than we thought and much earlier in time than previously thought.However, traces of nicotine in Egyptian mummies and a bronze (brass?) computer from an ancient shipwreck does not jive with what mainstream social and natural scientists traditionally present as 'fact' (dangerous word there at any rate).  My point is that mainstream science has had to (as science is supposed to) back down and rewrite its theories as new data and explanations come to light.  So mainstream science does not have an absolute corner on the truth market and what was poo-pooed in the past as nonsense and fantasy has many times gained acceptance (the existence of ball lightning comes to mind).It would have made a very interesting DVD package if they had included the Nova episode for a few bucks more as this episode is largely forgotten and is collecting dust somewhere.von Daniken did not say that every single headdress or ceremonial garb were based on ancient astronaut space suits, but what he does present are artworks of things that still look like space suits and advanced controls no matter how much these things are relegated to the mystical fantasies of ancient artists by mainstream scientists.  Interestingly, it is only in the context of modern technology and science as he points out that many of von Daniken's suppositions even begin to make sense! For instance, why does an ancient Mayan observatory look like a modern observatory?  What is the purpose of that if they indeed had no telescopes?All in all, I think von Daniken's explanations are at least as good as any offered by conservative science.  A powerful, imaginative presentation that actually enriches one's view of our ancient ancestors and does not denigrate their capabilities at all.  These hypotheses actually add a new dimension of wonder and excitement to our collective past.I definitely plan to watch this over and over again.  It is a superior documentary in that it is not inundated with talking head PhD s or self-styled experts and allows the viewer's mind/imagination to decide the validity of what he is seeing with only suggestions on the part of the writer.It is refreshing to see a film that still makes you go 'hmmmm' even after all these years.",5,A Real Gem and Fun to Watch!,1176249600,"04 11,

504437,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B00000IO3U,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[9, 17]","+++++(Note that this review is for the movie-documentary version on DVD of Chariots of the Gods?)This movie-documentary is based on the following books by Erich Von Daniken: ""Chariots of the Gods?"" and ""Return to the Stars.""This movie visually shows the evidence that Erich Von Daniken has collected from around the world that supports the idea or hypothesis that the bulk of human achievement across the millennia can be attributed to extraterrestrial influence.To get an idea of the scope of what this documentary covers and where the visual evidence was obtained, I will give the titles of its scenes:1) Titles and credits  2) Could life exist out there?  3) Modern tribesmen reactions  4) Parables, myths, and religions  5) Italy  6) Turkey  7) Egypt  8) Greece and Rome  9) Africa  10) South American Aztecs  11) South America Legends  12) South American Mayans  13) Easter Island  14) South America revisited  15) Other mysteries  16) South American signal art  17) Dare we not question?Note that Von Daniken does not narrate or even appear as a guest in this film.Von Daniken's hypothesis of extraterrestrial intervention may be outrageous (I did find leaps in reasoning and logic) but even so, I think it's even more outrageous that we are asked to believe that the fantastic achievements that took place in ancient cultures were totally unassisted.  Scholars have given somewhat convoluted explanations for some of these achievements but, I for one, find many of these explanations lacking.For example, we are asked to believe that thousands of years ago, before the invention of modern machinery, Egyptian workers transferred the massive stone blocks used to build just one of the Great Pyramids, across northern Africa by using wooden rollers, a process that would have taken more than 600 years, according to mathematical estimation.  I think any rational person would find this explanation unacceptable.  So how did the Egyptians do it?Von Daniken says that ancient cultures must have had some kind of help.  He extends this idea to almost every major cultural, religious, and societal belief system, including biblical systems.This movie is strongest with asking questions.  The movie sites extraterrestrial intervention when answering these questions but it does not force the viewer to accept these answers.Personally, what I found especially fascinating besides the incredible structures that were built by primitive humans were:(1) the 40,000 year old bison that was found with a bullet hole in its skull(2) the 2500 year old battery found in Iraq(3) a polished lens two thousand years old(4) Maps found in the seventeenth century that outline the coast of Antarctica, a continent which within historical memory has never been free of its massive ice cap.People who do not like their beliefs challenged or who accept what the ""experts"" tell them will not like this movie.  All others should find it most interesting.Finally, the on-location photography is great.  We not only see ancient structures but get a glimpse of cultures from around the world.  However, the background music in this documentary is jarring in some spots and I found it to be sometimes distracting.  But other than this, picture and sound quality are more than acceptable.  There are three extras that are interesting but brief.In conclusion, despite the age of the movie-documentary, this is still one of the best films on a controversial subject that I have seen and one that really makes you think!!(1970; 93 min;  full screen; 17 scenes)+++++",5,Examining Unsolved Mysteries of the Past,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,3537,"['+++++', 'Note', 'review', 'movie-documentary', 'version', 'DVD', 'Chariots', 'Gods', 'movie-documentary', 'based', 'following', 'books', 'Erich', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'Chariots', 'Gods', 'Return', 'Stars', 'movie', 'visually', 'evidence', 'Erich', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'collected', 'world', 'idea', 'hypothesis', 'bulk', 'human', 'achievement', 'millennia', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'extraterrestrial', 'influence.To', 'get', 'idea', 'scope', 'what', 'documentary', 'covers', 'where', 'visual', 'evidence', 'was', 'obtained', 'will', 'give', 'titles', 'scenes:1', 'Titles', 'credits', '2', 'Could', 'life', 'exist', 'there', '3', 'Modern', 'tribesmen', 'reactions', '4', 'Parables', 'myths', 'religions', '5', 'Italy', '6', 'Turkey', '7', 'Egypt', '8', 'Greece', 'Rome', '9', 'Africa', '10', 'South', 'American', 'Aztecs', '11', 'South', 'America', 'Legends', '12', 'South', 'American', 'Mayans', '13', 'Easter', 'Island', '14', 'South', 'America', 'revisited', '15', 'Other', 'mysteries', '16', 'South', 'American', 'signal', 'art', '17', 'Dare', 'not', 'question', 'Note', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'not', 'narrate', 'even', 'appear', 'guest', 'film.Von', 'Daniken', 'hypothesis', 'extraterrestrial', 'intervention', 'may', 'be', 'outrageous', 'did', 'find', 'leaps', 'reasoning', 'logic', 'even', 'so', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'outrageous', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'fantastic', 'achievements', 'took', 'place', 'ancient', 'cultures', 'were', 'totally', 'unassisted', 'Scholars', 'have', 'given', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'explanations', 'achievements', 'one', 'find', 'many', 'explanations', 'lacking.For', 'example', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'invention', 'modern', 'machinery', 'Egyptian', 'workers', 'transferred', 'massive', 'stone', 'blocks', 'used', 'build', 'just', 'one', 'Great', 'Pyramids', 'northern', 'Africa', 'using', 'wooden', 'rollers', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'more', '600', 'years', 'according', 'mathematical', 'estimation', 'think', 'rational', 'person', 'would', 'find', 'explanation', 'unacceptable', 'how', 'did', 'Egyptians', 'do', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'ancient', 'cultures', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'kind', 'help', 'idea', 'almost', 'major', 'cultural', 'religious', 'societal', 'belief', 'system', 'including', 'biblical', 'systems.This', 'movie', 'strongest', 'asking', 'questions', 'movie', 'extraterrestrial', 'intervention', 'when', 'answering', 'questions', 'not', 'force', 'viewer', 'accept', 'answers.Personally', 'what', 'found', 'especially', 'fascinating', 'incredible', 'structures', 'were', 'built', 'primitive', 'humans', 'were', '1', '40,000', 'year', 'old', 'bison', 'was', 'found', 'bullet', 'hole', 'skull', '2', '2500', 'year', 'old', 'battery', 'found', 'Iraq', '3', 'polished', 'lens', 'two', 'thousand', 'years', 'old', '4', 'Maps', 'found', 'seventeenth', 'century', 'coast', 'Antarctica', 'continent', 'historical', 'memory', 'never', 'been', 'free', 'massive', 'ice', 'cap.People', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'beliefs', 'challenged', 'who', 'accept', 'what', 'experts', 'tell', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'others', 'should', 'find', 'most', 'interesting.Finally', 'on-location', 'photography', 'great', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'ancient', 'structures', 'get', 'glimpse', 'cultures', 'world', 'However', 'background', 'music', 'documentary', 'jarring', 'spots', 'found', 'be', 'sometimes', 'distracting', 'other', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'more', 'acceptable', 'are', 'three', 'extras', 'are', 'interesting', 'brief.In', 'conclusion', 'age', 'movie-documentary', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'controversial', 'subject', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'really', 'think', '1970', '93', 'min', 'full', 'screen', '17', 'scenes', '+++++']",N/A
