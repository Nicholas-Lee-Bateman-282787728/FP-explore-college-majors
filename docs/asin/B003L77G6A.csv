The core cast and recurring roles have been wonderful.  I find it difficult to believe that the the writers ran out of material for the Leslie Winkle character...sounds like a cop-out.However, Pria was the shallowest, least interesting character they have ever juxtaposed to Penny, and had no chemistry with anyone, including Leonard.  I can't imagine what they were thinking?  She was a burden, rather than an addition to the cast, and I am happy and grateful that she was written out this season.Amy Farah Fowler (I even love her name!) and Bernadette, on the other hand, are wonderful characters, with depth, appeal, quirkiness to match the main characters and welcome additions to the cast.At this juncture, this is the only season I don't own, and while I will, eventually, I am waiting for the used DVDs to go down in price, where I purchased the other seasons streaming in HD.I'm glad they came back to their senses this year.

Then I went on and purchased season 3. I really think this is a great show, at one time it was the most original show on television and now I am noticing that it is steadily changing into a clone of everything else on television.  This is a real tragedy because now-a-days with everything being reality shows and boy/girl hook-ups and relationship dramas on television, The Big Bang Theory gave us something new. This show was a breath of fresh air and a necessary escape from the same old teen dramas, and sitcoms that were just teen dramas with laughter in the background. With Leonard, Sheldon, Rajesh (prob.spelled that wrong, sorry folks)Howard and Penny -the show was perfect. When they started adding the girlfriends -Bernadette, Amy, and now Pria, the show began to lose its originality and just became another show about a bunch dudes and thier chicks. However, I love Bernadette, she turned out to be a great character and I now think the show would suffer without her. I have said in other reviews that Amy is the worst, but I will admit her character has gotten a lot better in this season.  I think her lines are great, BUT!!! She needs to be separated from Sheldon.  These two characters are far too much alike to interact the way they do. Sheldon and Penny work off of each other much better and while at first I really disliked Amy's character I think that they could work with her in other ways, because (again) she did have some great lines this season.  Specifically when she called herself setting up boundaries for her and Penny's friendship and then shouted: ""DONT TOUCH MY BREASTS"", LMFAO!!! that was hilarious. Lately her calling Penny ""BFF"" is pretty funny too. Perhaps Penny and Amy can work off of each other and have the same success that Penny and Sheldon have. That just might work. PRIA HAS GOT TO GO! Her character serves no purpose. I really do not like this new thing with Leonard being the new hot ticket in town.  Leonard got Penny as a fluke and a twist of fate. Sheer luck and unlikely circumstance brought those two together and when he and Penny broke up, Leonard should have gone back to the nerd that no woman would look at twice. That would have been funny. I am also noticing that the friendships are disolving. It seems like they spend more time criticizing eachother and putting eachother down than hanging out and having Halo night. I am noticing that while Leonard is hanging with Pria and Howard is with Bernadette, Radjesh and Sheldon are always alone. Whats up with that? I will buy this, because although it is steadily being destroyed, it is still a good show with the possibility to return to the greatness it once was. They need to separate Amy and Sheldon, cancel out Pria and glue the geeks back together.",3,Blossom Is Blossoming...

If we forget that fact, they remind us, in their desfunctunallity, and diversity to cope.In an other words perilous journeying, thru the gate ways of their humanity, & almost never pay for the consequences,at hand. Till human error arises, and proves genuine, humble inability, to see every flaw the gods laid out, in front of their perfectly planned out- well plans...Errhem! Brought down to an Earthen plane, no one can understand. But the modern four Stoodges of our time, and that adoring blonde across the hall, who can at times, out wit the guy's, and even the Mighty Sheldore, the most damaged, arrogant, & at times obnoxious, among them. Played by his ultra ego, Jim Parsons, who won two awards already, for his Anal retentive, germ phobic, phobic, stuborn man child, yet all amusingly, lovable, that is once in a great, epiphanous, & momentious of occasional, human connection, such as what is sarcasim??? Sometimes, even secretly, channeling Actor Brent Spiner's Data, & British actor, Chris Barry's infamous Red Dwarfer Admiral AJ. Rimmer, Smeg hed, Via Dr.X, as Sheldon S Cooper.Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hoffstedder, Kunal Nayyar as Rajessh Koothipolli, & Simon Helberg Moist, as Howard Wolliwitz, and Theodore, as the beaver, with the extended ball. (I'm just testing you, that's from Season 2...) Honestly, I don't know how you can stand upright, without falling over...(Bazinga!)But to be Serious, for a milli sec, [whoah, too long Neo...] This show, is just, crazy enough, to last on it's own male merits but enter to the equation, of the formalacic Qauzzzars, of the 4 guy's + 3 equally funny, females, the secondary cast of Characters, who enter, & continue to leave, & enter thru the paradoxial shifts, or Seasonal change ups. Including guest cams, & the show never lets you down, with only breaking of the third walls- & back to Earth, you never feel quite the same again, from when you left it, not realizing you had. But no you really did tink you taw a Romulan, crossing the hyper space ways, back to the Big bang again, thru a black hole, & back again, reassembled, and shaky but not stirred...Enter the guy's extrodinary three females, wow poor Rajesh, (deaf girl ?) Oh, yeh, by the way, there is a slight paradox for you, you hear him mention her, once, but the ep. Raj's big date, is on season 5 ?! not 4 ?! One big bang goof up, up to this point, there was an ebbing flow, to the BBTH Dvd Universes.Someone needs to tell the Dvd Company, they F--ed up, and human error, in this case, is no excuse.Mayim Bialik as Amy, Melissa Raunch as Bernadette, & Kaley Cuoco as Penny, all great actresses in their own right, build the Cast out to a perfect harmonious mis- mosh of the guy's other halves, or are they just unique, & as messed up as the guy's they both try to emulate, & make fun of, just like the guy's, a unified loop, only now, they have an equal playing field.That on future, hybrid, monkeys, & their Human subjects, who need to to get over the fact that life is just too short, to quibble over symantics, and everyones much too uptite, todaze, in this flawed existence, we were all given, & left with.So strap on a robotic arm, and a sense of relative humor.That means Ipads down, workaholics!

Big Bang Theory also has a great ensemble cast. The writers manage to balance out the scripts so that the focus is pretty well balanced between the ensemble cast which is also somewhat unusual.A few of the actors were a little stiff and hadn't manage to fully flesh out their characters in seasons 1 and 2. From season 3 forward everything has operated with all cylinders firing in perfect sync. I have seasons 3, 4 and 5 in my collection and I am looking forward to buying season 6 for my collection.I think it's essential to just be able to laugh and enjoy a good comedy.

Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","THE BIG BANG THEORY was a failed pilot until creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady re-wrote the script to take advantage of the chemistry between lead actors Jim Parsons and Johnny Galecki. The series went on the air in 2007 and quickly became a national favorite. Most comedies traffic in stereotypes and this series is no different, centering on a group of socially inept geniuses who run afoul of the pretty but intellectually average girl who lives across the hall--but the fun of the series is in the way it undercuts the stereotypes, giving us glimpses of humor and humanity in unexpected and often laugh-out-loud ways.The fourth season episodes seem to be trying a bit too hard, and consequently the overall season feels a little uneven.  Even so, when THE BIG BANG THEORY delivers, it really and truly does it with a big bang.  Howard (Simon Helberg) becomes increasingly involved with Bernadette (Melissa Rauch); Sheldon (Jim Parsons) develops a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler (brilliantly performed by Mayim Bialik); dismissed by Penny (Kaley Cuoco), Leonard (Johnny Galecki) becomes involved with Pryia (Aarti Mann), sister of Raj (Kunal Nayyar), who becomes ridiculously over-protective--and much to his frustration is the only one of the four men left without a girlfriend.At various points in the serious Sheldon and Amy separate, leading Sheldon to replace Amy with two dozen cats.  Howard and Bernadette also separate when Bernadette catches Howard having cybersex.  Although the two couples are reconcilled, Leonard begins to wonder just how serious Pryia is when she goes to great lengths to conceal their relationship from her parents.  There is a lot of outrageous comedy along the way, with my own favorite ""The Engagement Reaction,"" when Howard's mother appears to have a heart attack upon hearing that her son wants to marry Bernadette--and germaphobe Sheldon becomes accidentally trapped in a hospital bio-hazard room. No, the fourth season is quite up to the standard of the first three seasons, but it's still a lot of fun.

Despite that, though, it's slipped a bit from the initial seasons in a key way.  Those first seasons really made the characters seem like real scientists in that they talked about real science.

1351175,AM41FOTVC7YWX,B003L77G6A,"KSC ""Book Addict""","[0, 0]","I just reviewed season three so I don't have too much to add. I enjoyed season 4 a lot because the addition of Mayim Bialek (hope her name is spelled correctly) has added much to my enjoyment of the show. The development of ""Shamy"" has been a delight to watch. Amy is a foil for Sheldon, but she's not a female Sheldon. Whereas he never cared about fitting in or missing out on social events in high school (and college), she does regret not having those experiences. In her friendship with Penny (which she takes great delight in), she's trying to experience all the social events she missed. It's fun to see Amy (who was bullied in high school for being smart) becoming friends with Penny, who was the popular girl in high school (and was perhaps a bit of a bully as is exposed in one episode). Amy has a bit of a girl crush on Penny (well, maybe more than a bit)and sometimes doesn't recognize personal boundaries, but Penny is fairly gracious and kind about this. Watching Sheldon mature emotionally (recognize he has strong romantic feelings for Amy)is heartwarming. I love it. Although I don't mention the other characters, I enjoy them too. I've always liked Howard. Raj is my least favorite because there always seems to be a bit of meanness behind his humor. I find him to be a bit creepy. Overall, this is one of the BEST shows on tv.

1351176,AXWJ5NGLE2736,B003L77G6A,Lady Ann,"[0, 0]","Having previously seen episodes of TBBT ""catch as catch can,"" by aimlessly turning on the television and viewing episodes at random (sometimes starting in the middle), I wanted to begin with Season 1, Episode 1, and watch the entire series in order, which I've been doing courtesy of Amazon. (I've also concurrently been reading reviews of each episode at A.V. Club online -- but never read reviews written by people who aren't fans of the show.)Watching any show in order of broadcast should give the viewer a good idea as to whether it's getting better, worse, or staying the same, and whether the characters are stagnating, growing, or devolving.  I maintain that TBBT is getting better in every way.  The ""bestie"" relationship between Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) just keeps getting more adorable, and adding Raj's sister Priya as a romantic foil to Penny's non-love for Leonard makes things a bit more interesting. I acted in community theatre for 14 years and every director I had gave the same advice: ""Have fun! If you're not having fun, the audience won't, either.""  Every character/actor on TBBT seems to be having fun with his/her part, and that makes the watching even more delicious.  Plus, now that we know our characters so well, it's a hoot to look forward to getting all those accruing questions answered:  Will Raj ever talk to females without alcohol?  Will Howard really break free of his mother?  Will Sheldon and Amy ""do the dance with no pants""? (And, if so, will Leonard's mom get jealous?)This is all great fun and I look forward to my ""Big Bang"" moments with relish.  Only one thing nags at me: all the critics say that the show was meant to be Johnny Galecki's and that Jim Parsons' ""Sheldon"" has stolen the lead right out from under him (unintentionally, I'm sure, but there it is).  I worry whether this eats at Mr. Galecki....whether it gets in the way of his and Mr. Parsons' friendship...those kinds of things.  Whenever I see Leonard scowl on the show, I always wonder if he's doing some method acting, drawing on his despair at playing second Chiquita to Parsons.  On the less-than-slim chance that he's reading this, I want to assure Johnny Galecki that the ability to successfully play straight man to someone else's demented antics is far trickier than it seems.  Few actors have the chops to do it, and if he can just hang in there (oh please don't let me see an Enquirer headline like 'FED-UP GALECKI CALLS IT QUITS!'), I feel certain that his best leading roles are yet to come. Anyway, it's not his fault: Leonard wasn't truly written as a lead -- the zanier character will always get the attention (think Richie Cunningham vs. The Fonz).In sum, TBBT is as fun as it ever was. I can't wait to see what happens next: always a good sign. If I could just stop worrying about Johnny Galecki, it would be an almost-perfect viewing experience.",5,"Except that I worry about Johhny Galecki, it's a fun ride",1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,2892,"['Having', 'previously', 'seen', 'episodes', 'TBBT', 'catch', 'catch', 'can', 'aimlessly', 'turning', 'television', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'random', 'sometimes', 'starting', 'middle', 'wanted', 'begin', 'Season', '1', 'Episode', '1', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'order', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'courtesy', 'Amazon', ""'ve"", 'also', 'concurrently', 'been', 'reading', 'reviews', 'episode', 'A.V', 'Club', 'online', 'never', 'read', 'reviews', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'show', 'Watching', 'show', 'order', 'broadcast', 'should', 'give', 'viewer', 'good', 'idea', 'getting', 'better', 'worse', 'staying', 'same', 'characters', 'are', 'stagnating', 'growing', 'devolving', 'maintain', 'TBBT', 'getting', 'better', 'way', 'bestie', 'relationship', 'Amy', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'Penny', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'just', 'getting', 'more', 'adorable', 'adding', 'Raj', 'sister', 'Priya', 'romantic', 'foil', 'Penny', 'non-love', 'Leonard', 'things', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'acted', 'community', 'theatre', '14', 'years', 'director', 'had', 'gave', 'same', 'advice', 'Have', 'fun', ""'re"", 'not', 'having', 'fun', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Every', 'character/actor', 'TBBT', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'his/her', 'part', 'watching', 'even', 'more', 'delicious', 'now', 'know', 'characters', 'so', 'well', 'hoot', 'look', 'forward', 'getting', 'accruing', 'questions', 'answered', 'Will', 'Raj', 'ever', 'talk', 'females', 'alcohol', 'Will', 'Howard', 'really', 'break', 'free', 'mother', 'Will', 'Sheldon', 'Amy', 'do', 'dance', 'pants', 'so', 'will', 'Leonard', 'mom', 'get', 'jealous', 'great', 'fun', 'look', 'forward', 'Big', 'Bang', 'moments', 'relish', 'Only', 'one', 'thing', 'nags', 'critics', 'say', 'show', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'Jim', 'Parsons', 'Sheldon', 'stolen', 'lead', 'right', 'out', 'unintentionally', ""'m"", 'sure', 'worry', 'Mr.', 'Galecki', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Parsons', 'friendship', 'kinds', 'things', 'Whenever', 'see', 'Leonard', 'scowl', 'show', 'always', 'wonder', 'doing', 'method', 'acting', 'drawing', 'despair', 'playing', 'second', 'Chiquita', 'Parsons', 'less-than-slim', 'chance', 'reading', 'want', 'assure', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'ability', 'successfully', 'play', 'straight', 'man', 'someone', 'else', 'demented', 'antics', 'far', 'trickier', 'Few', 'actors', 'have', 'chops', 'do', 'can', 'just', 'hang', 'there', 'oh', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'see', 'Enquirer', 'headline', ""'FED-UP"", 'GALECKI', 'CALLS', 'IT', 'QUITS', 'feel', 'certain', 'best', 'leading', 'roles', 'are', 'yet', 'come', 'Anyway', 'not', 'fault', 'Leonard', 'was', ""n't"", 'truly', 'written', 'lead', 'zanier', 'character', 'will', 'always', 'get', 'attention', 'think', 'Richie', 'Cunningham', 'vs', 'Fonz', '.In', 'sum', 'TBBT', 'as', 'fun', 'ever', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'could', 'just', 'stop', 'worrying', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'would', 'be', 'almost-perfect', 'viewing', 'experience']",Big Bang Theory:S4 (DVD)

I particularly agree (to a certain extent) with a comment I saw about the addition of Amy and the decrease in the interaction between Sheldon and Penny.  I agree that Amy has, to some extent, decreased some of the interactions between some of the other characters, and I often wished Penny was around more.  One of the best parts of previous episodes was watching Penny and Sheldon slowly coming to understand and even like (or at least care for) each other.However, I do not feel that Amy was a worthless, or even a bad addition.  I don't think she by any means ruined the show; I just wish they would make sure in the new season to not have her pushing other characters to the side the way she sort of did in this season.  I think the addition of both her and Bernadette have almost added too many main characters; while I understand they are necessary and I would not advocate taking them out, I think some balance needs to be found - the story is primarily about the core group of friends and their neighbor, and that needs to be reclaimed.That negativity aside, I still LOVE the show.  I know some people think it is not an accurate reperesentation of ""geeks"" or even find it offensive, but the characters often bring to mind friends of mine; particularly in the WOW segments (and make me laugh almost as much remembering real life experiences as at the show itself).  I enjoyed Amy; it's really funny to see her and Sheldon try to deal with emotions (and physical reactions) that they have obviously never had to handle before.  Further, the same group dynamic is still there, and still as funny as ever.  Sheldon in particular is still fantastic; I am so glad he has won awards - I feel he truly deserves them.

I watched the first three for Sheldon, and felt he deserved his Emmys. Now he has either 1) let success go to his head and is now phoning it in, 2) lacking a director, or 3) being directed by someone whose envy is unconsciously resulting in directorial sabotage. He is wincing, and prancing and screwing up his face in exaggerated ways and his previous naturalness seems forgotten. It's as if his evolution as an actor has reversed itself and we now see him at an early, inexperienced stage. So much indicating.And Penny. -- Indicating City. Her range of expressions, with upper lip dumbly pushed forward, the same eye-rlling-type scornful looks, is limited. I've always thought she was severely miscast. And the character mis-drawn. She could have been an equally intelligent but uneducated yet socially ept person, yet she comes accross as just uneducated and sometimes embarassingly dumb -- this is not funny. Compare her requisite blond character with the Britta character on Community, a really smart and funny show. Britta is actually smart and portrays an extremely wide range of expressions and talent. Like the others on Community you get the impression her talents, and those of the production/writing staff, are limitless. I laugh a lot watching Community -- it's fresh and original, yet interweaves popular references such as old movies while not feeling the need to explain them -- it's chock-full of intellect and humor; but sitting in front of TBBT I just sit and look, getting angrier by the minute at my intelligence being disrespected, the way the characters are now disrespected by the writers, who seem to have studied up on 'sitcom shtick formulae'' and are just filling in the forms.The producers obviously know the show isn't funny because they include a hilarious, raucous LAUGHTRACKThe plots are screamingly hackneyed. There is no science that anyone can understand. It's all on a 13-year old level of allusions to masturbation, size of one's penis and embarassingly exaggerated references to sex. Ignrant nerd sex.Wouldn't it have been great if TBBT had seen itself as a partial vehicle for teaching physics, astronomy and engineering. As it is, we don't even know what 'the guys' are working on. As another low-star review points out, now we a supposed to laugh 'at' the charactters, not with them. I would add that whomever is running this show doesn't understand or hates science.

Recently, it's been tough finding good programs on cable that last for any length of time. Just when I get into a show, I find they cancel it, and it seems my tastes and the programmer's tastes never match. Sitcoms that have been on forever, I can't stand and ones I love get cancelled after the first season. So when The Big Bang Theory first came out, I didn't watch it. But Ryan loved it, and my little brother loved it and my best friend giggled about it behind my back...LOL So I sat down one day and started watching some reruns of it on a marathon on one of the cable stations, and I was hooked.Sheldon is so much like Ryan it's funny, but he's a lot like my nephew too (who has Asperger's), so it's sort of neat to see someone with some of his struggles, but in a humorous light and also shows how intelligent he is too. Sheldon is functional, but he's surely not socially adept, and his confusion about social interaction is hilarious.Johnny Galecki is funny, and if you've ever seen him in interviews and such, you can see what a great actor he is, because he's really not a lot like his character on the show. Yet, Leonard is awesome on the show. He's the go-between, not quite a complete nerd/geek, but definitely not in the 'normal' realm either.By this season, they actors have really come into their roles well, and I'm enjoying the series quite a bit.

I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is **consistently** brilliant!Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.And now, he starts going out on dates...Well, sort off. He still cannot drive and yet his fusion into Shamy may produce what can only be described as the...Kwisatz Haderach!(On a more sober note: producers please get rid of Amy, she only gums up the show's flow!)Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself, he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD yet (and Sheldon never lets him forget it). An electrical engineer whose crowning achievement is a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle (and is now working on its liquid waste management solutions). He also managed to wreck the Mars rover in hopes of landing a girl - but he made sure no one can prove anything.The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.Now, if only he could find a practical use for that mechanized arm...Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the &#34;poor Indian&#34; defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley.Finally, Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,A WHOLE NEW UNIVERSE OF INTELLIGENT LAUGHS!,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,3170,"['cult', 'tradition', 'SPARTACUS', 'halls', 'science', 'department', 'now', '34', 'AM', 'SHELDON', '34', 'Currently', 'fourth', 'season', 'THE', 'BIG', 'BANG', 'THEORY', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'funny', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'aired', 'had', 'not', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'hard', 'ever', 'best', 'days', 'FRASIER', 'SEINFELD', 'BIG', 'BANG', '**consistently**', 'brilliant', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'unavoidably', 'king', 'show', 'massive', 'black', 'hole', 'Universe', 'will', 'child', 'prodigy', 'now', '24', 'years', 'old', 'theoretical', 'physicist', 'PhD', 'absolutely', 'social', 'skills', 'known', 'sexual', 'drive', 'Sheldon', 'may', 'be', 'verge', 'unifying', 'fields', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'car', 'save', 'life', 'break', 'smile', 'even', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'mere', 'homo', 'sapiens.And', 'now', 'going', 'out', 'dates', 'Well', 'sort', 'off', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'yet', 'fusion', 'Shamy', 'may', 'produce', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'Kwisatz', 'Haderach', 'more', 'sober', 'note', 'producers', 'please', 'get', 'rid', 'Amy', 'only', 'gums', 'up', 'show', 'flow', 'Leonard', 'Hofstadter', 'Sheldon', 'roommate', 'primary', 'keeper', 'experimental', 'physicist', 'Sheldon', 'idiosyncrasies', 'personal', 'neurosis', 'not', 'mention', 'crush', 'neighbor', 'Penny', 'Which', 'crush', 'lunar', 'eclipses', 'follow', 'predicted', 'yet', 'unavoidable', 'periodicity.Howard', 'Wolowitz', 'only', 'one', 'PhD', 'yet', 'Sheldon', 'never', 'forget', 'electrical', 'engineer', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'mechanized', 'arm', 'used', 'space', 'shuttle', 'now', 'working', 'liquid', 'waste', 'management', 'solutions', 'also', 'managed', 'wreck', 'Mars', 'rover', 'hopes', 'landing', 'girl', 'made', 'sure', 'one', 'can', 'prove', 'anything.The', 'fact', 'short', 'man', 'severely', 'outdated', 'misguided', 'sense', 'fashion', 'still', 'mother', 'using', 'collection', 'pickup', 'lines', 'straight', 'men', 'magazines', 'advice', 'columns', 'yet', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'just', 'hilarious.Now', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'practical', 'use', 'mechanized', 'arm', 'Rajesh', 'Koothrappali', 'particle', 'astrophysicist', 'fashion', 'sense', 'close', 'absolute', 'zero', 'severe', 'case', 'shyness', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'front', 'women', 'inebriated', 'using', '34', 'poor', 'Indian', '34', 'defense', 'father', 'rich', 'doctor', 'who', 'Bentley.Finally', 'Penny', 'proverbial', 'good', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'came', 'California', 'stardom', 'aspirations', 'so', 'far', 'waitress', 'sequence', 'bad', 'boyfriends', 'Sheldon', 'fact', 'calculated', 'exact', 'number', 'extrapolated', 'bell-curve', 'started', '14', 'obviously', 'neighbors.The', 'show', 'unavoidably', 'use', 'previous', 'sitcom', 'combinations', 'odd', 'couple', 'unfulfilled', 'love-interest', 'mismatch', 'even', 'one', 'discern', 'are', 'used', 'such', 'fresh', 'manner', 'left', 'great', 'entertainment', 'way', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'own', 'DVD', 'writing', 'so', 'smart', 'jokes', 'fly', 'so', 'fast', 'many', 'non-verbal', 'just', 'way', 'savor', 'weekly', 'air', 'time', 'Well', 'may', 'be', 'Sheldon', 'could', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'can', 'compare', 'intellect', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Big Bang Theory:S4 (DVD)

Actually, this show, believe it or not, had a predecessor that was VERY similar in character breakdown called ""Dweebs"", starring Peter Scolari, Cory Feldman and a few other semi-famous folk. It was actually pretty funny and got the feel of the dot.com world down to a gnat's wazoo, but only lasted a half a season. I'm so glad to see that ""Big Bang"" is in its sixth season and still going strong. I've been rooting for it all along.What a formula! Four nerdy friends, all of them with doctorates except one, (who never hears the end of it,) who STILL read comic books, who dote on popular science fiction franchises and who are strangers to normal male/female relationships to a large degree...and who are indistinguishable from 17-18 year old virgin high school boys! How could it miss!? There's Sheldon, KING of the anal retentives, right down to the perfectionist attitude, the supreme confidence in his own ability and importance, who thinks he is the center of the known universe, Leonard, his classically nerdy best friend, who semi-masochistically endures his nonsense; Howard Wollowitz, the classic Jewish momma's boy with all the Philip Roth demons in attendance! Then there's Raj....a Hindu, still with the accent, with VERY Old World-y attitudes mixed with a savvy but naive carriage in Pasadena California. All set off against the typical All-American Girl in Penny, a totally normal, regular young lady from Nebraska. Absolutely perfect!Chuck Lorre, as far as I'm concerned, is the new James Burrows.... for, with the exception of ""Mike & Molly"", this man can do no wrong as far as TV comedy is concerned. (And even ""M&M;"" is doing well in the ratings!) ""Big Bang"" is EASILY my favorite sitcom of the moment, and has been for the last three years! But a couple of things bothers me.... why does Leonard have Sheldon's mother??? And why is Leonard, who, let's face it, is THE classic nerd of the four of them, (he's always disheveled, wears glasses, is short and talks like he's apologizing for something all the time,) why is he the big lady's man of the quartet?? He's landed: Leslie Winkle, Penny, Pria, Dr. Stephanie, the North Korean spy and NONE of the other three have had the same or similar record!

1351231,A1DL0EDVWPSPEW,B003L77G6A,"Ryan Matthews ""montvil""","[148, 185]","** WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS **Season 4 of 'The Big Bang Theory' had just one thing that separated it from every other show about a group of friends in their late 20's/early 30's: Sheldon Cooper.When the show first began, it was about a stereotypical Midwestern blonde girl who moves to California to make it big, and she happens to move across the hall from two Caltech geniuses who severely lack the social skills of the average human being. At the beginning of the series, Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj were absorbed by science. The humor was a product of their ""experiments"" and their inability to fit into the social environment. Here we are four seasons later, and that concept has become scarce as the story has progressed. Sheldon was the only facet of the show that gave it originality this season. I love the show, but it pains me to say that S4 of 'The Big Bang Theory' started to get away from what made it so great.It baffles me why the show would decide to introduce so many new cast members in such a short period of time. As a guy, when I first watched the show, I didn't take to the 4:1 guys to girls ratio. However, that's one of the things made it unique (see: Seinfeld). Penny was able to hold up a level of femininity that most actresses couldn't. She was the perfect solo female star. Not only does evening the gender ratio make this show like every other comedy on television, but it reduces Penny's role on the show. She didn't need a ""posse."" The show spent much of Season 4 trying to balance seven main characters (eight once Priya became a regular) when the only ones who really are essential to its continued excellence are Sheldon and Penny.My synopsis of our ""new"" characters:*I'm sorry to say this, but Amy Farrah Fowler is a mess of a character. First, she was introduced as the lady Sheldon, someone who only communicated with Dr. Cooper through webcam and text message and had no interest in developing any real social relationships. Then the show decides that Amy should try to befriend Penny and Bernadette and the three of them would become their own girl group. Since that time, Amy has become a complete one-eighty of her former self, awkward and clueless but trying desperately to fit into the social scene. And I hate to say it, but it's nowhere near as funny as it should be. The strangest thing is that her relationship with Sheldon is essentially very little more than circumstantial now. Sheldon constantly asks, ""what happened to you?"", and here I'm wondering the same exact thing.*Bernadette, I will admit I do like as a complimentary girl in the show. The only downfall with her is in dating Howard; I always liked the way Howard thought he was so much more suave and debonair with women than he actually was, and putting him in a relationship takes that element of his character away. Bernadette can stand on her own. She's a sweet, cute, sometimes airheaded but lovable character (and to be quite honest, I could listen to her voice all day). She didn't need to be one of the boys' love interests to find a role on the show. Either way, I think she'd work best in a recurring role, something akin to that of Leslie Winkle in the first couple seasons.*It's kind of a paradox that I liked the idea of Leonard dating Raj's sister, but I don't like Raj's sister. The idea was good because of the dynamic it created between Leonard and Raj, Raj and Priya, Penny and Priya, so on and so forth. The problem is I didn't find that her character brought much of anything to the show. The fact that she was attractive and that threatened Penny was a clever twist because it made Penny re-think her decision to end things with Leonard (and ultimately, we find out that it's a decision she regretted). So I thought the situation they created by having Leonard date Priya was good, but Priya just doesn't seem to fit on the show. Now from what we learned in the season finale, her role on the show may be hanging in the balance. I'm not aching for her to leave the show, but I wouldn't miss her too much if she went that route.The show suffered a minor slump when Kaley Cuoco broke her leg and had to be absent for two full episodes. Those episodes perfectly showcased how vital the character of Penny is to the show's success. In ""The Desperation Emanation"" (ep. 4.05), Leonard is set up by Bernadette with a girl named Joy. Her character was not only unfunny, she was downright repulsive. In a season with peaks and valleys, it didn't get any lower than Joy.By no means am I saying this show has jumped the shark. It had many redeeming moments and a few classic episodes:*""The Robotic Manipulation"" (ep. 4.01) so perfectly personifies Howard Wolowitz.*""The Love Car Displacement"" (ep. 4.13) was a great episode top to bottom. Including a guest appearance from former NBA player Rick Fox, it is the best the writers got out of their extended cast. There was great balance, funny storylines and laugh out loud moments.*""The Justice League Recombination"" (ep. 4.11) re-introduces us to Zack, a hilariously dumb ex-boyfriend of Penny's. The New Year's Eve costume contest is classic 'Big Bang.'*""The Herb Garden Germination"" (4.20) is the high school rumor mill, 'Big Bang' style. I loved it (and it's probably Amy's best episode).*When the group starts hanging out at Raj's apartment, Sheldon decides he'd rather just replace them with new friends in ""The Toast Derivation."" (ep. 4.17) Clever episode and very well executed.*""The Zarnecki Incursion"" (4.19) is a brilliant depiction of the gang looking to settle the score when Sheldon's World of Warcraft account gets hacked.*""The Zazzy Substitution"" (ep. 4.03) is the first time we see any sort of fallout from Sheldon's lack of social connection, and it results in a pretty hilarious new gig. I'm also a big fan of whenever Mrs. Cooper or Mrs. Hofstadter make an appearance.*""The 21-Second Excitation"" (ep. 4.08)  proves that any episode can be made epic with an appearance from Sheldon's nemesis, Will Wheaton. ^Side note: (This episode is also the perfect example of why I don't like Amy; the humor associated with her character for most of the season is perfectly on display in this episode)- Sheldon and Penny's back and forth at the Cheesecake Factory bar in ""The Apology Insufficiency"" (ep. 4.07) is incredible. It's astounding how funny those two actors can make simple conversation. Throughout the series, it's been most evident when they walk together up the three flights of stairs to their apartments.- ""Shelbot"" was an inevitable story for a science fiction show to tell. ""The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification"" (ep. 4.02)- Raj's infatuation with Bernadette throughout the season makes for some great love triangle moments.I didn't particularly love the season finale, but the way the stories all came together at the end was fantastic and should send the show into Season 5 with a head of steam. I loved the idea of having Penny get caught in a scandalous mistake. With Priya seemingly leaving the picture (at least for now), the possibilities are endless. Also worth asking: Will Howard be OK with Bernadette ""wearing the pants"" in the relationship, or will he finally pursue his PHD in Season 5? The questions are plentiful.It was an uneven season. It was a season that did a lot of things but didn't really go anywhere definitive with it. I thought the emphasis was too much on developing social relationships and not enough on the science of the show.- If you asked me what Leonard did in Season 4 other than date Priya, off the top of my head I couldn't tell you.- Penny spent the entire season in denial over the fact that she wanted Leonard back. As a result, other than a brief stint with Zack and her drunken night with Raj, Penny was involved with no one in S4. Rather, the writers decided to develop her ""posse"", a decision you already know I wasn't a big fan of.- Once Howard started dating Bernadette again, Howard stories became ""Howard and Bernadette"" stories. I'm kind of torn on this, because I think Howard is a better character when he's single, but I do like Bernadette for him. Either way, the writers need to find a way to channel vintage Wolowitz again.- Sheldon Cooper is the anit-Fonz, and I think when all is said and done, he'll go down as one of the better characters in television history. He is a comedy pioneer for nerds, and he is THE redeeming quality when anything isn't working. Jim Parsons is well deserving of the Emmy he won in Season 3, and once again he demonstrates why he was the perfect choice for Sheldon.A slight decline from its predecessors, but still as good a comedy as you'll find on television.Grade: B+",4,"A Lot of Action, A Lot Less Direction",1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,8655,"['**', 'WILL', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', '**Season', '4', ""'The"", 'Big',

I had never seen the show before but knew it was popular, and for that price it was easy to take a gamble. My husband initially scoffed but let's just say we watched a couple of episodes together - and ended up doing a total marathon and ordering seasons 2 and 4 from Amazon!!!The show is, in one word, AMAZING. I've read a lot of different comments from people, some who thought it was too geeky, or too sexist etc - personally, I think that the first four seasons are absolutely ground-breaking in the same way that Friends was in the 90s. The characters all have their quirks but I firmly believe just about anyone with a sense of humor will find themselves laughing hard and often! The puns and jokes in the first four seasons, along with new characters in later seasons to support the main cast, are absolutely hilarious - and I was beyond delighted to find Mayim Bialik back on screen with fervor!My only qualm for the first few seasons is that I really wish they'd given more screen time and a more substantial role to Sara Gilbert. Reuniting her with Johnny Galecki after the two were an on-screen couple in the 80s in Roseanne, Sara Gilbert still brought the same biting snarkasm to all her TBBT cameos, and I still think she would've made a perfect complement for the main cast.Either way, the actors all do a fantastic job - although even for a &#34;newbie&#34; fan like myself, it's clear from the get-go why Jim Parsons' portrayal of the neurotic, hypochondriac and egocentric Dr. Sheldon Cooper is considered the breakaway character of the show. The first few season are a lot cleaner than the later seasons, although I will admit that the running theme of what seems to be implied bisexuality on the part of several characters is a bit weird and confusing at time. All the same, the show is absolutely fantastic and I would urge anyone to at least give it a try!",5,What a revelation!,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,2006,"['husband', 'only', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'got', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'total', 'steal', 'Target', '14.99', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'knew', 'was', 'popular', 'price', 'was', 'easy', 'take', 'gamble', 'husband', 'initially', 'scoffed', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'watched', 'couple', 'episodes', 'together', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'total', 'marathon', 'ordering', 'seasons', '2', '4', 'Amazon', 'show', 'one', 'word', 'AMAZING', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'different', 'comments', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'geeky', 'too', 'sexist', 'etc', 'personally', 'think', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'are', 'absolutely', 'ground-breaking', 'same', 'way', 'Friends', 'was', '90s', 'characters', 'have', 'quirks', 'firmly', 'believe', 'just', 'anyone', 'sense', 'humor', 'will', 'find', 'laughing', 'hard', 'often', 'puns', 'jokes', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'new', 'characters', 'later', 'seasons', 'support', 'main', 'cast', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'back', 'screen', 'fervor', 'only', 'qualm', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'really', 'wish', ""'d"", 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'substantial', 'role', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'Reuniting', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'two', 'were', 'on-screen', 'couple', '80s', 'Roseanne', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'still', 'brought', 'same', 'biting', 'snarkasm', 'TBBT', 'cameos', 'still', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'perfect', 'complement', 'main', 'cast.Either', 'way', 'actors', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'even', '34', '34', 'fan', 'clear', 'get-go', 'why', 'Jim', 'Parsons', 'portrayal', 'neurotic', 'hypochondriac', 'egocentric', 'Dr.', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'considered', 'breakaway', 'character', 'show', 'first', 'few', 'season', 'are', 'lot', 'cleaner', 'later', 'seasons', 'will', 'admit', 'running', 'theme', 'what', 'be', 'implied', 'bisexuality', 'part', 'several', 'characters', 'bit', 'weird', 'confusing', 'time', 'same', 'show', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'would', 'urge', 'anyone', 'least', 'give', 'try']",Big Bang Theory:S4 (DVD)

1351245,A30UWBHC4QL4JT,B003L77G6A,S. Robison,"[9, 13]","In its fourth season, ""The Big Bang Theory"" has really come into its own. The characters this season are fully developed, with each making use of unique, believable personality characteristics. Whereas the earlier seasons were great because of the novelty of the characters, this season is all about interaction. Meet the cast:Sheldon Cooper is the resident supergenius. ""One lab accident away from being a supervillain,"" Sheldon is socially awkward, yet he doesn't recognize it, nor does he particularly care about interaction with those of his own species. Actually, one could make the argument that Sheldon is not of the human species, yet this is where his humor is manifested. If you loved Sheldon in the earlier seasons, you will continue to do so: Sheldon continues along with his neurotic tendencies, his compulsive nature, and his obvious supremacy. Sheldon's interaction with the other characters continues to be the prime amusement, as Sheldon gains a ""girlfriend"" in Amy Ferrah-Fowler this season. Amy, a fellow socially awkward individual, is forced to date once a year by her mother; she decides that Sheldon will pretend to be her boyfriend so that her mother will rest her case, however, they soon develop an awkward friendship that is a quasi-relationship. Meanwhile, Amy bonds with the other girl characters, gaining girlfriends for the first time in her life. You get to witness such highlights of her development as her first sleepover.Leonard, also a genius, is plagued by his recent breakup with Penny, the beautiful girl next door, yet they both clearly have feelings for each other. When Leonard begins to date his friend Raj's sister, however, Penny begins to get jealous, culminating in an unbelievable season finale. Raj continues to battle with his inability to speak to women as well as jealousy about the fact that Howard finally has a girlfriend. The relationship between Howard and Bernadette is taken to a different, new level, and provides a vast amount of laughs as well.On the whole, definitely pick up this set. This series is not meant to be enjoyed one episode at a time, but in marathon after marathon.

It managed to rise above the morassof crap on most broadcast networks and be just good- not exactly a glowing review, but more than you can say for most of the TV out there.However, the back end of the third season and this season have suffered from a noticeable decline. I'm not really sure exactly what changed, but it's mostly because of three things:1) The Flanderization of SheldonAt the show's inception, Sheldon was nowhere near as socially bereft as he is in S4; he's just a very smart, somewhat awkward guy with an admittedly large number of personality quirks. However, when this was spotlighted as the funniest thing in the show, it was ratcheted up several levels- and this actually worked for a time. In season two (the best season), he's at just the right level of obnoxiousness and social neurosis. However, by now he's nothing but a generally insufferable man-child who can't even hold a simple conversation. He's still somewhat funny, granted, but he has to carry the show most of the time. Why?Because...2) Leonard is a JackassLike with Sheldon, Leonard has been cranked up to 11. Observe-Season 1 Leonard: Easily the most normal of the 4.Season 2 Leonard: "" ""Season 3 Leonard: Slightly more jerkish, but not enough to seriously disrupt the show.Season 4 Leonard: Egotistical jerk-ass who complains about everything and fails to actually be funny.But basically, Season Four of TBBT is just3) Too much like everything elseAs I said earlier, The Big Bang Theory first popped out to me because it was funnier and better than most everything out there. But the writing is sloppier, the characters are more broadly drawn and Flanderized (ex: Wolowitz' perversion, Penny's 'stupidity') and it's just not funny. Granted, there were a few good episodes (""The 21-Second Excitation"", ""The Justice League Recombination""), and I generally liked Bernadette and Amy Farrah Fowler (except when she only served to highlight just how 'whacky' Sheldon was). But it didn't click for me this year, and I don't know if I'll tune in again.Full Disclosure: I missed most of the second half of the season's original broadcasts because of a conflict with Community (8/7 ct. on NBC!), but I have seen 17 of the episodes including the last 2.

1351255,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B003L77G6A,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 1]","As season 4 hits its strides you know that the best things about it are the burgeoning relationships that come from the returning cast members of Mayim Bialik's Amy and Melissa Rauch's Bernadette.  Penny, consistently portrayed as the vapid, loose, and drunkish object of Leonard's lost affections, is given a bit more depth finally simply by having her not just accepted as ""one of the guys"" but as a girlfriend with girlfriend bonds betwixt she, Amy, and Bernadette.  They are an extremely odd trio whose pairing somehow feels intuitive and they all get to play off of each other in ways that they can't play off of the guys.  Bernadette, the short and sweet and mouse-squeaky confection to Howard's horndog goofy agressive awkwardness, is Penny's sensible and mild mannered friend who doesn't flaunt her intelligence around Penny nor does she put Penny's lack of intelligence down while Amy, Sheldon's superior and unintimidated soulmate, bursts with a socially dysfunctional girl-crush on Penny.  Penny gets the opportunity to be a loyal friend to both of them and so finally shows some redeeming qualities to her character, as does the series, whose beauty and geek fish-out-of-water in their respective worlds continues to be mined for awkward comedy gold.Some of my favorite episodes are ""The Zazzy Substitution"" when Sheldon and Amy (Shamy!) break up and Sheldon scarily quickly brings a clowder of cats to the apartment.  A desperate Leonard calls in Sheldon's mother for help and in a great scene, when Shelly's mother is asking him why he has all of these cats, Leonard loudly sneezes the answer: ""Ah-CRAZY!"" to which Mrs. Cooper politely responds ""God bless you, son.""We get to watch the crew get their geek on in ""The Justice League Recombination"" where the boys recruit Penny and her boyfriend to join them for a New Year's Eve party at the comic shop dressed as, what else?

The fourth season (2010-11, episodes #64 through 87) features a number of changes, and sees the development of a number of key relationships.Sheldon (Emmy winner Jim Parsons) and Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), become an unconventional couple, complete with a signed agreement, while Leonard (Johnny Galecki) begins torrid affair with Raj's sister Priya (Aarti Mann).  Love blooms for Howard (Simon Helberg) and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch), as the couple become engaged near the end of the season.  Penny (Kaley Cuoco), Bernadette, and Amy become very tight, partially due to them uniting against Priya.  While Raj (Kunar Nayyal) has difficulty coming to terms with his sister's romance, and briefly has feelings for Bernadette.Overall, there's quite a lot happening, and the various new wrinkles generally make for some lively viewing, as Amy, Priya, and Bernadette, assume larger roles.  Having a very special chemistry, it seems a bit odd for Penny and Leonard not to be on the best of terms, as Leonard's romance with Priya, does create some significant waves, particularly concerning Leonard's dealings with Raj, Sheldon, and Penny.The Amy/Sheldon relationship finds its footing, becoming less mechanical and more human, as the initially cold Amy, has her female parts stimulated, heightening her interest in sex.  Based on his past history, Howard finding a woman willing to accept him and his substantial baggage, is quite remarkable, as Melissa Rauch proves to be a most talented comedic actress, as things quickly head toward matrimony, and Bernadette becomes an integral character.""The Boyfriend Complexity"" features guest star Keith Carradine, as Penny's father Wyatt.  There's some of the old magic between Penny and Leonard on display, as he pretends to be her boyfriend.  It's a fun dysfunctional time for all, when the entire gang heads to a conference in Big Sur, in ""The Love Car Displacement"", which features an appearance by Bernadette's old boyfriend (Rick Fox), and more instances of musical beds.  Priya's strong influence on Leonard, is clearly evident as the season closes, putting a different vibe into the Big Band universe, heading into season five.The changing dynamics in season four, opens new doors, as BBT continues to evolve.  It remains a quirky program beloved by millions, but while mostly light and fun, there are bumps along the way, when things do not flow as smoothly.The  two disc Bluray edition may not be as pristine as you would expect, and might not be worth the upgrade over the standard DVD.  The various bonus features however,  do look fabulous in high definition.

1351265,A3B6X5KB0W963D,B003L77G6A,Troll Reviewer,"[0, 0]","The Chuck Lorre sitcom `The Big Bang Theory' started off as an average sitcom. It was nothing to write home about, but it was worth seeing on a rainy Saturday. In seasons two and three, the writing became sharper and the characters became less based on dated stereotypes. Season four sees the show at occasionally the heights it reached in seasons two and three, yet it also includes some of the weakest, laziest episodes the show has ever produced.As stated before, the quality of season four is highly inconsistent and unpredictable. We start off with two merely solid episodes with excellent sub-plots that aren't really able to bring the episode up to ""great comedy"" status: ""The Robotic Manipulation"" contains some brilliant dialogue in Amy and Sheldon's first date, but Howard's sub-plot about a robot hand stuck on a certain part of his body drags the episode down. ""The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification"" features a likable Sheldon in a sub-plot full of laughs, but a surplus of fart jokes are unnecessary and frankly unfunny. This is the main problem with season four: the humor has become a little dumbed down. Out of all four seasons, this one is the weakest yet, and the fact that it also has the most fart jokes and poop jokes of all four seasons so far isn't much of a coincidence.The actual writing also seemed a little lazy halfway through the season. There are certain episodes where one could almost know that the writers had run out of ideas. Take ""The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,"" in which an entire sub-plot revolves around Howard and Raj trying to prove who would be the better sidekick to a hypothetical hero. I'd presume that about 10 minutes are spent on that narrative, with barely any smart comedy to find in it. Since there are more relationships this season, serialization would've been nice too (as it is for most shows). The writers tried it in two season three episodes, and it worked quite well.Some of the best episodes have solid humor and situational writing. Unfortunately though, a good nine or ten of the 24 episodes are lazily written or have too much bathroom humor to be excellent episodes. If you want smart humor, you should probably get season two or three. If you want a season full of mostly merely solid episodes with the occasional mediocre episode and the occasional great episode, this one's for you.Best episodes: ""The 21-Second Excitation"" and ""The Roommate Transmogrification""Season grade: B",3,"Still entertaining, but humor is less original and the writing a little lazier",1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,2446,"['Chuck', 'Lorre', 'sitcom', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'started', 'off', 'average', 'sitcom', 'was', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'rainy', 'Saturday', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'writing', 'became', 'sharper', 'characters', 'became', 'less', 'based', 'dated', 'stereotypes', 'Season', 'four', 'show', 'occasionally', 'heights', 'reached', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'also', 'weakest', 'laziest', 'show', 'ever', 'produced.As', 'stated', 'quality', 'season', 'four', 'highly', 'inconsistent', 'unpredictable', 'start', 'off', 'two', 'merely', 'solid', 'episodes', 'excellent', 'sub-plots', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'able', 'bring', 'episode', 'great', 'comedy', 'status', 'Robotic', 'Manipulation', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'Amy', 'Sheldon', 'first', 'date', 'Howard', 'sub-plot', 'robot', 'hand', 'stuck', 'certain', 'part', 'body', 'episode', 'down', 'Cruciferous', 'Vegetable', 'Amplification', 'likable', 'Sheldon', 'sub-plot', 'full', 'laughs', 'surplus', 'fart', 'jokes', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'frankly', 'unfunny', 'main', 'problem', 'season', 'four', 'humor', 'become', 'little', 'dumbed', 'down', 'four', 'seasons', 'one', 'weakest', 'yet', 'fact', 'also', 'most', 'fart', 'jokes', 'poop', 'jokes', 'four', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', ""n't"", 'much', 'coincidence.The', 'actual', 'writing', 'also', 'seemed', 'little', 'lazy', 'halfway', 'season', 'are', 'certain', 'episodes', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'know', 'writers', 'had', 'run', 'ideas', 'Take', 'Alien', 'Parasite', 'Hypothesis', 'entire', 'sub-plot', 'revolves', 'Howard', 'Raj', 'trying', 'prove', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'sidekick', 'hypothetical', 'hero', ""'d"", 'presume', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'spent', 'narrative', 'barely', 'smart', 'comedy', 'find', 'are', 'more', 'relationships', 'season', 'serialization', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'too', 'most', 'shows', 'writers', 'tried', 'two', 'season', 'three', 'episodes', 'worked', 'quite', 'well.Some', 'best', 'episodes', 'have', 'solid', 'humor', 'situational', 'writing', 'Unfortunately', 'good', 'nine', 'ten', '24', 'episodes', 'are', 'lazily', 'written', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'be', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'want', 'smart', 'humor', 'should', 'probably', 'get', 'season', 'two', 'three', 'want', 'season', 'full', 'mostly', 'merely', 'solid', 'episodes', 'occasional', 'mediocre', 'episode', 'occasional', 'great', 'episode', 'one', 'you.Best', 'episodes', '21-Second', 'Excitation', 'Roommate', 'Transmogrification', 'Season', 'grade', 'B']",Big Bang Theory:S4 (DVD)

1351269,A6S8DJ4TOM2BF,B003L77G6A,Wade Tomlin,"[0, 0]","You're the writers and creators of The Big Bang Theory, a successful sitcom on CBS that's in syndication. Your sitcom has great ratings for the network while having at its core one of the most unique characters on television in Sheldon who is played by Jim Parsons so capable an acting talent that he's already won an Emmy and Golden Globe for his portrayal of your ultra brilliant yet infantile lead character. For Season 4 the answer would seem obvious. Just keep the four nerds isolated, lonely and searching for contact, while being annoyed by Sheldon, heck it worked before.But in doing so what would even be the point of a fourth season. There are only so many stories about four guys in an apartment that you can keep interesting without delving into a parody of what your show once was. In essence the writers of The Big Bang Theory either had to start writing a new program or throw in the towel on the shows' progression.In Season 4 The Big Bang Theory makes the smart decision to get away from what made the show such a hit. Whereas early seasons revolved around four socially isolated geniuses and their interactions with an attractive neighbor, Season 4 sees the geeks evolve into manhood. This leads to a show stretching itself into wonderful new dynamics and avoiding the trap of staleness that often sinks most shows.In Season 4, Leonard is post break-up from Penny and has started facing his loneliness and begins dating. In one episode he asks Howard to set him up leading to an awful first date that ends with a realization of self-respect. Whereas his character was once purely awkward the Leonard in Season 4 seems willing to grow. This leads to a relationship with Raj's sister Priya that further propels him into adulthood. Meanwhile, Sheldon takes to his relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler started at the end of Season 3 with a surprising ease (considering who he is) creating a wonderfully unique dynamic that elevates the show. Instead of being given a typical young person's relationship where sex seems to be all that matters, both Amy and Sheldon wade slowly and carefully into their dynamic. Watch the episode when Amy asks Sheldon to meet his Mother and you'll see the exact opposite feelings at work that you usually do in sitcoms, when Amy says she doesn't have a desire for a sexual relationship with Sheldon, his character is touched ""that's the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.""It's this stretching of the core group that creates a great pace throughout Season 4. The most growth is scene in Howard and his relationship with Bernadette. Where the constantly aroused engineer before spent his time obsessing over sex seemingly only to provide comedic fodder, the Howard in Season 4 is a real character trying to commit to a relationship with Amy while examining the dynamic with his mother. Look for the episode where Howard decides against a lonely night to himself as the ultimate sign of growth where he abandons his science fiction fantasies to pursue a real relationship.In propelling the main characters into new situations The Big Bang Theory makes a wise gamble that pays off. As instead of further isolating these lonely geeks, in Season 4 the geeks step out of their shells more than ever bringing their amusing awkward tension to greater comedic heights.",4,A Smart Change In Direction,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,3317,"[""'re"", 'writers', 'creators', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'successful', 'sitcom', 'CBS', 'syndication', 'sitcom', 'great', 'ratings', 'network', 'having', 'core', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'characters', 'television', 'Sheldon', 'who', 'played', 'Jim', 'Parsons', 'so', 'capable', 'acting', 'talent', 'already', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'portrayal', 'ultra', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'infantile', 'lead', 'character', 'Season', '4', 'answer', 'would', 'seem', 'obvious', 'Just', 'keep', 'four', 'nerds', 'isolated', 'lonely', 'searching', 'contact', 'being', 'annoyed', 'Sheldon', 'heck', 'worked', 'before.But', 'doing', 'so', 'what', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'point', 'fourth', 'season', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'four', 'guys', 'apartment', 'can', 'keep', 'interesting', 'delving', 'parody', 'what', 'show', 'once', 'was', 'essence', 'writers', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'had', 'start', 'writing', 'new', 'program', 'throw', 'towel', 'shows', 'progression.In', 'Season', '4', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'smart', 'decision', 'get', 'away', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'such', 'hit', 'Whereas', 'early', 'seasons', 'revolved', 'four', 'socially', 'isolated', 'geniuses', 'interactions', 'attractive', 'neighbor', 'Season', '4', 'geeks', 'evolve', 'manhood', 'show', 'stretching', 'wonderful', 'new', 'dynamics', 'avoiding', 'trap', 'staleness', 'often', 'most', 'shows.In', 'Season', '4', 'Leonard', 'post', 'break-up', 'Penny', 'started', 'facing', 'loneliness', 'dating', 'one', 'episode', 'Howard', 'set', 'up', 'leading', 'awful', 'first', 'date', 'realization', 'self-respect', 'character', 'was', 'once', 'purely', 'Leonard', 'Season', '4', 'willing', 'grow', 'relationship', 'Raj', 'sister', 'Priya', 'further', 'propels', 'adulthood', 'Meanwhile', 'Sheldon', 'relationship', 'Amy', 'Farrah', 'Fowler', 'started', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'surprising', 'ease', 'considering', 'who', 'creating', 'wonderfully', 'unique', 'dynamic', 'show', 'Instead', 'being', 'given', 'typical', 'young', 'person', 'relationship', 'where', 'sex', 'be', 'matters', 'Amy', 'Sheldon', 'wade', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'dynamic', 'Watch', 'episode', 'when', 'Amy', 'Sheldon', 'meet', 'Mother', ""'ll"", 'see', 'exact', 'opposite', 'feelings', 'work', 'usually', 'do', 'sitcoms', 'when', 'Amy', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Sheldon', 'character', 'touched', 'most', 'pragmatic', 'thing', 'anyone', 'ever', 'said', 'stretching', 'core', 'group', 'great', 'pace', 'Season', '4', 'most', 'growth', 'scene', 'Howard', 'relationship', 'Bernadette', 'Where', 'constantly', 'aroused', 'engineer', 'spent', 'time', 'obsessing', 'sex', 'seemingly', 'only', 'provide', 'comedic', 'fodder', 'Howard', 'Season', '4', 'real', 'character', 'trying', 'commit', 'relationship', 'Amy', 'examining', 'dynamic', 'mother', 'Look', 'episode', 'where', 'Howard', 'lonely', 'night', 'ultimate', 'sign', 'growth', 'where', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasies', 'pursue', 'real', 'relationship.In', 'propelling', 'main', 'characters', 'new', 'situations', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'wise', 'gamble', 'off', 'instead', 'further', 'isolating', 'lonely', 'geeks', 'Season', '4', 'geeks', 'step', 'shells', 'more', 'ever', 'bringing', 'amusing', 'awkward', 'tension', 'greater', 'comedic', 'heights']",Big Bang Theory:S4 (DVD)

1351271,A2ZTDYBROGUQQI,B003L77G6A,"W. Hinson ""Denver Dick""","[7, 11]","UPDATE 5/20/2011:  The season developed well.  I continue to like Amy.  As for Bernadette, I wasn't crazy about her when she was first introduced but now I think she definitely adds to the show.  Someone recently wrote that it's about time for Priya to go.  Unlike Bernadette, I really liked Priya when she first showed up, however, I also now think it's time for her to return to India for awhile . . . let Penny have a little more air time.  It was a great season 4 finale last night.  Oh, one more thing, the smoking monkey a few episodes ago was fantastic!  He and Amy work well together.ORIGINAL REVIEW (still valid): This is my favorite show on television; it makes me laugh out loud.  Each character is unique and yet they blend together well when paired up with some or all the of others.  I see that some reviewers here don't like the introduction of Amy.  I must admit that when she first showed up I didn't know if this was going to be a good move.  However, as this season has progressed, I have become a fan of Amy.  Her relationship with Sheldon is funny, but Amy's growing relationship with Penny has become very, very funny.It seems whenever the show takes a turn, I find myself questioning where they're going with it, but it always turns out to be a hoot.

1351275,A6B41QYBJ1XPJ,B003L77G6A,yankeesrule1989,"[7, 10]","The Big Bang Theory Season 4 proved to be better than Season 3 according to a lot of people (and yet I don't get why so many people had a problem with it). I don't get why there's so many people who hate change when change is necessary in any sitcom.Sure season 1 and 2 are great but all sitcoms have to evolve over time. If it stayed EXACTLY the same then everybody would be complaining that it's getting old and needs to take on a new direction. And they still act like nerds. Not AS much as the first two years but they're still nerds. The whole point of the show is that thanks to Penny moving in, the four socially awkward scientists are adapting to the real world full of relationships. That's why the show is called ""The Big BANG Theory."" And it's been like this since DAY ONE. The only thing I miss is the old Howard when he was always hitting on Penny.This year we had the addition of Amy Farrah Fowler (she actually first appeared in a very short scene in the season 3 finale), Raj's sister Priya whom Leonard continues their old affair, and the return of Bernadette--Howard's girlfriend. Also this year we had a reappearance of Penny's dimwitted ex, Zack, in a few episodes.A lot of episodes this season mainly revolved around relationships but it didn't take away the guy's nerdiness. In one episode Howard proposes marriage to Bernadette. Leonard and Priya continue their old relationship from years ago, much to Raj's chagrin--and also Penny and Bernadette's chagrin because it seems as though Priya doesn't want Leonard to hang around Penny. Penny had previously broken up with Leonard and so this season they just stayed friends. She actually briefly got back together with Zack but Leonard didn't seem too happy about it. Sheldon and Amy are good friends who often chat via Skype--and give each other good advice. Amy sees Penny as her ""bestie."" She, Bernadette and Penny are often seen out together for girls nights. In this year's season finale, we got a pretty big twist with two people we never thought would end up in bed together. In the season 5 opener everything should be resolved so we can finally see what REALLY happened.My Top 10 episodes for this season include""The Robotic Manipulation"" - Howard got a robotic arm stuck on his ""you know what""""The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification"" -Sheldon turns himself into a ""robot."" Steve Wozniak guest stars as himself""The Zazzy Substitution"" - Sheldon ""breaks up"" with Amy so he replaces her with a bunch of cats""The 21 second excitation"" - The guys camp out in line to see a special extended cut of ""Indiana Jones."" Special guest appearance by Wil Wheaton""The Boyfriend Complexity"" - Penny's father (Keith Carradine) visits and she wants him to think she and Leonard are still dating""The Justice League Recombination"" - Zack wants to join the guys and Penny at a New years eve costume party at the Comic Book store when they go as the Justice League.""The Toast Derivation"" - Sheldon decides to get some new friends to be the center of attention of. Kripke makes a return in this episode.""The Prestidigitation Approximation"" - Sheldon is obsessed with learning the secret of Howard's card trick.""The Zarnecki Incursion"" - Someone has hacked into Sheldon's World of Warcraft account and stolen stuff he's earned so it's up to the guys to find the thief.""The Roommate Transmogrification"" - Raj decides to move in with Sheldon when he is disgusted with Leonard and Priya having sex in his bed.The other 14 episodes are great too but these are my top 10.I'm def. buying season 4. I'm not a FANBOY, I just enjoy the show and don't act overly critical and picky with every little aspect of every episode.
