941653,A1U2IMZ2HM6ABF,B000BFJM5I,De witte leeuw.,"[0, 0]","I ordered and re-ordered this boxed set twice now with the same results, i.e. &#34;The Black Candle&#34; disc is OK, but the &#34;The Black Velvet Gown&#34; is defective no matter if you purchased this from Amazon or one of its venders.  The problem doesn't arise from whoever sells this item, it is a problem with the manufacturer who has released thousands of defective discs in this boxed set.  In my first set, the &#34;Gown&#34; disc went into digital blocks and then skipped, hopped, and jumped about making viewing impossible.  So I sent it back to the vender and Amazon sent me another boxed set that they were selling.  Result:  The very same as before.  If it was my VCR all of my DVDs would be having this same problem.  That is not the case, it is definitely a problem with the disc itself.  So be warned.  If you don't want to be sending and re-sending this item back to Amazon, buy &#34;The Black Candle&#34; separately  and stay away from any copies of &#34;The Black Velvet Gown&#34; altogether if you can.",3,Caveat Emptor!,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,1022,"['ordered', 're-ordered', 'boxed', 'set', 'twice', 'now', 'same', 'results', 'i.e', '34', 'Black', 'Candle', '34', 'disc', 'OK', '34', 'Black', 'Velvet', 'Gown', '34', 'defective', 'matter', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'one', 'venders', 'problem', ""n't"", 'arise', 'item', 'problem', 'manufacturer', 'who', 'released', 'thousands', 'defective', 'discs', 'boxed', 'set', 'first', 'set', '34', 'Gown', '34', 'disc', 'went', 'digital', 'blocks', 'then', 'skipped', 'hopped', 'jumped', 'making', 'viewing', 'impossible', 'sent', 'back', 'vender', 'Amazon', 'sent', 'boxed', 'set', 'were', 'selling', 'Result', 'very', 'same', 'before', 'was', 'VCR', 'DVDs', 'would', 'be', 'having', 'same', 'problem', 'not', 'case', 'definitely', 'problem', 'disc', 'So', 'be', 'warned', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'sending', 're-sending', 'item', 'back', 'Amazon', 'buy', '34', 'Black', 'Candle', '34', 'separately', 'stay', 'away', 'copies', '34', 'Black', 'Velvet', 'Gown', '34', 'altogether', 'can']",Catherine Cookson
