Made in the  early 1960's it only lasted a season but  each episode  tackled what it  was  like to be a  marine Lieutenant  in the  period.  Not  seen  on tv  for  decades it has  finally been released on  dvd and it is a must  get. It has  a  great cast including Robert Vaughn in his  pre Man From UNCLE  perion.,5,The Lieutenant The Complete Series Part 2,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,377,"['series', 'often', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'Gene', 'Rodenberry', 'Made', 'early', '1960', 'only', 'lasted', 'season', 'episode', 'tackled', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'marine', 'Lieutenant', 'period', 'Not', 'seen', 'tv', 'decades', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'dvd', 'must', 'get', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'pre', 'Man', 'UNCLE', 'perion']","The Lieutenant - The Complete Series, Part 2"

I have recently received my two half seasons, in excellent quality by the way, and have started to go through them. It is interesting to note that supporter Robert Vaughn went from this (1 season) to his big hit, ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"",after having done ""The Magnificent Seven"" earlier. I really am enjoying what I am seeing, the wole season appears to be building to the events in the last movie length episode when all problems will be answered.

Cook ""Don Edward Cook""","[3, 3]","If you are looking for excellent, common-person-accessible drama from the early 1960's -- or if you are a rabid &#34;Star Trek&#34; fan who wonders what pre-Trek things this excellent series creator, Gene Roddenberry, had done, look no further -- &#34;The Lieutenant&#34; is in the house!  This sterling example of good, adult-level drama (that is, where it's smart enough for grown-up tastes) is, well, sort of a &#34;Army Wives&#34; type of show from the military male point of view.  It's a wisely-done series, one where the show's protagonist, Marine 2nd Lt. William Tiberius Rice (that's right, Trekkers -- &#34;Tiberius&#34; -- played by Gary &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34; Lockwood) is a flawed protagonist who often gets a lecture by his superiors, often in the form of Capt. Rambridge (Robert &#34;Man From UNCLE&#34; Vaughn.)  This show is a &#34;journey show&#34; about a Marine still learning the ropes of the Corps -- which in and of itself makes for high-caliber drama beyond compare.

1578656,A5IPEZBOFCV5Q,B008Y1YKU8,James R. Morrella,"[0, 0]",The Lieutenant aired in the early 1960's with Gary Lockwood. It was great and showed the men in the Marines like they are. When Vietnam came television seemed to cut programs like this. What this shows is the courage and commitment those in our armed forces have. They are not responsible for how they may be used. I think it points out why those of us not in the armed forces must be involved so these men are not abused.

1578657,A1Q1XYXUFPALP7,B008Y1YKU8,"Johnny K ""Love the 1960s""","[8, 8]","The Lieutenant is a 1963-64 dramatic series starring Gary Lockwood and Robert Vaughn. Lockwood is excellent in his role as a newbie US Marine officer, second lieutenant William Rice. Lockwood expertly portrays Rice with both sensitivity and strength of character. Vaughn is his captain in charge and plays the role with the seriousness and intelligence that one can expect from him. Created by Gene Roddenberry the episodes contain a variety of human emotions and the tele-dramas play out well and hold one's interest right to the end. After watching the first part of season one episodes (which you must buy separately) I knew I was going to want to see the rest of the season's episodes and they are equally satisfying. The series didn't make it to a second season back in 1964 but that wasn't because of reviews or viewership. It garnered good reviews and was gaining an audience but reportedly things fell apart as Lockwood wanted to pursue a career in motion pictures rather than television, Vaughn wanted to star in his own television series and CBS was wary of continuing the series anyway as U.S. involvement in the VietNam war was escalating and the network didn't want to be accused of ""toxic programming"". It's all history now and The Lieutenant was a drama that came along and went in one brief season but is certainly worth viewing again now. Good writing and acting never fail to please. I'm thankful that the Warner Archives decided to release this series on DVD..now if they will release Mr. Novak the great 1963-65 TV drama series about high school teacher John Novak we will have another intelligent series on DVD.",5,When TV dramas had depth and intelligence,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1632,"['Lieutenant', '1963-64', 'dramatic', 'series', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Lockwood', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Lockwood', 'excellent', 'role', 'newbie', 'US', 'Marine', 'officer', 'second', 'lieutenant', 'William', 'Rice', 'Lockwood', 'expertly', 'Rice', 'sensitivity', 'strength', 'character', 'Vaughn', 'captain', 'charge', 'role', 'seriousness', 'intelligence', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'Created', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'episodes', 'contain', 'variety', 'human', 'emotions', 'tele-dramas', 'play', 'out', 'well', 'hold', 'one', 'interest', 'right', 'end', 'watching', 'first', 'part', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', 'must', 'buy', 'separately', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'rest', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'equally', 'satisfying', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'second', 'season', 'back', '1964', 'was', ""n't"", 'reviews', 'viewership', 'garnered', 'good', 'reviews', 'was', 'gaining', 'audience', 'reportedly', 'things', 'fell', 'apart', 'Lockwood', 'wanted', 'pursue', 'career', 'motion', 'pictures', 'rather', 'television', 'Vaughn', 'wanted', 'star', 'own', 'television', 'series', 'CBS', 'was', 'wary', 'continuing', 'series', 'anyway', 'U.S.', 'involvement', 'VietNam', 'war', 'was', 'escalating', 'network', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'accused', 'toxic', 'programming', 'history', 'now', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'drama', 'came', 'along', 'went', 'one', 'brief', 'season', 'certainly', 'worth', 'viewing', 'again', 'now', 'Good', 'writing', 'acting', 'never', 'fail', 'please', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'decided', 'release', 'series', 'DVD..now', 'will', 'release', 'Mr.', 'Novak', 'great', '1963-65', 'TV', 'drama', 'series', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'John', 'Novak', 'will', 'have', 'intelligent', 'series', 'DVD']","The Lieutenant - The Complete Series, Part 2"

Hard to believe it is now fifty years ago,almost fifty one that this fine series was produced, and when I was born...A slew of amazing guest stars throughout the series and semi-regulars such as Richard Anderson, John Milford and to a lesser degree Christopher Connelly.The feature version of To Kill A Man varies somewhat from the original episode. I watched them back to back and noticed that we have more depth of relationship between Rice and the James Shigeta character in the episode. The feature spends more time on Rice's relationship with Anne Helm and Linda Ho and although James Shigeta's character has some extra scenes which actually make sense, I  preferred the way they played out in the episode.

1578660,A2ZTDYBROGUQQI,B008Y1YKU8,"W. Hinson ""Denver Dick""","[0, 0]","This is essentially the same review I posted for Part 1.ABOUT THE SERIES:  I watched this series when I was twelve years old.  I really liked the series Combat that began its run in 1962 when I was eleven.  I recall how different The Lieutenant was from ""war"" movies and television shows that I'd watched before.  This series, from my twelve year old perspective, was serious and seemed real.  I liked Gary Lockwood very much.  I also liked Robert Vaughn as the company commander.  He was definitely in command, but also seemed truly concerned about his men.ABOUT THE PACKAGING AND DVDs:  The single-sided DVDs are well protected in the plastic case.  Don't look for any booklet or details on the individual episodes or any extras on the DVDs, except for the international release of the episode ""To Kill a Man"" in movie length.  The menu is simple and straight forward, but effective.  It does not appear that the episodes were remastered, but the quality is still very good.  I'm watching it on a 40"" LED Samsung HD and the picture appears pretty sharp and clear.Since this is the first product I have owned on DVD-R media, I was concerned about how they would play.  So, this evening I placed each disc in my Sony Upscaling DVD Player (model DVP-NS710H/B) which I purchased new in 2010.  Each disc loaded.  I checked out the menus and scrolled through the options.  I played the beginning of two episodes on each disc.  They played fine.  I'll watch all the episodes in their entirety later.",5,"First Rate: Series, Packaging and DVDs",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,1494,"['essentially', 'same', 'review', 'posted', 'Part', '1.ABOUT', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'watched', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'really', 'liked', 'series', 'Combat', 'began', 'run', '1962', 'when', 'was', 'eleven', 'recall', 'how', 'different', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'war', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', ""'d"", 'watched', 'before', 'series', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'perspective', 'was', 'serious', 'seemed', 'real', 'liked', 'Gary', 'Lockwood', 'very', 'much', 'also', 'liked', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'company', 'commander', 'was', 'definitely', 'command', 'also', 'seemed', 'truly', 'concerned', 'men.ABOUT', 'THE', 'PACKAGING', 'AND', 'DVDs', 'single-sided', 'DVDs', 'are', 'well', 'protected', 'plastic', 'case', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'booklet', 'details', 'individual', 'episodes', 'extras', 'DVDs', 'international', 'release', 'episode', 'Kill', 'Man', 'movie', 'length', 'menu', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'effective', 'not', 'appear', 'episodes', 'were', 'remastered', 'quality', 'still', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'watching', '40', 'LED', 'Samsung', 'HD', 'picture', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'clear.Since', 'first', 'product', 'have', 'owned', 'DVD-R', 'media', 'was', 'concerned', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'So', 'evening', 'placed', 'disc', 'Sony', 'Upscaling', 'DVD', 'Player', 'model', 'DVP-NS710H/B', 'purchased', 'new', '2010', 'disc', 'loaded', 'checked', 'out', 'menus', 'scrolled', 'options', 'played', 'beginning', 'two', 'episodes', 'disc', 'played', 'fine', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'episodes', 'entirety', 'later']","The Lieutenant - The Complete Series, Part 2"
