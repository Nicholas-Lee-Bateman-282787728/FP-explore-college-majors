I do know there are technical limitations to what can be done with kinescopes and aged tape. Those who think or want these things to look current may be missing the point. There are many, many of us who believe the world turned around on February 9, 1964 with this first opportunity for the masses to see The Beatles in action. (OK, they were on Paar and some other shows but rememeber, Sullivan's show was the cynosure,,,it was legitimcay; that's why - at least in this case - Epstein was brilliant)Moreso, look at what else was on these shows. How much would you pay for a DVD of Frank Gorshin or Two Ton Tessie O'Shea...or even Georgia Brown???? Sullivan brought vaudeville to TV and The Beatles changed that. From here on, Rock 'n' Roll became normal for family vieiwng. How many groups did we get to see after these performances. This was a tipping point.But besides that. Watch these four sets of performances - you can set the DVD to just show The Beatles. Watch the maturing in their performances across the three February shows and then see the quantum leap in how they are at that 1965 show. They had played Shea the month before; probably the first stadium concert ever.

1362074,A168VXSISJWQN9,B003TJ4YU6,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[0, 0]","Since I was in England when these shows were recorded, it was interesting to me to see what the full shows looked like. I'd seen the performances of The Beatles many times, but not the context in which they were set. There were several things that were surprising to me.First, I hadn't realised how minimal the staging was. Not only were there no fancy sets, there were hardly any sets at all. Most of the acts just came out and performed in front of curtains. Coupled with that was the low-key nature of the presentation, exemplified by the style of Mr. Sullivan himself. These days it seems that presenters don't feel that they've done their job unless they scream their introductions. Ed Sullivan simply said a few words and then allowed the acts to speak for themselves.Second, an area which has improved considerably is the lighting of the stage. Evidently at that time lights were very bright and very hot, with the result that the performers were visibly drenched in sweat after the first couple of minutes. Paul was glistening like a marathon runner and poor Mitzi Gaynor was actually dripping. I found it quite distracting, as obviously did Ms. Gaynor.Third, if indeed these are the full shows, I was surprised by how limited the commercial interruptions were. There was generally only one or at the most two advertisements between each act and The Beatles and Mitzi Gaynor, as the biggest stars on view, were able to perform several numbers without commercial interruptions. The commercials themselves were rather endearing in their earnestness, striving to show what good quality the products were. Only cosmetics and medical products appear to have that as their primary objective now, most of the others being either humorous or appealing to the desire for status.I'm not a believer that everything was better in the good old days, and a program like this would have to be considerably reworked to get any kind of an audience now. However, it is commendable that these shows are still available to allow people like myself to see what America was watching in 1964. The British TV companies, alas, didn't do nearly as good a job at retaining archival material and much of what was broadcast in Britain at that time has been lost forever.Well worth purchasing for fans of The Beatles, Ed Sullivan and the early 1960s period.",4,Interesting piece of history,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,2335,"['was', 'England', 'when', 'shows', 'were', 'recorded', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'full', 'shows', 'looked', ""'d"", 'seen', 'performances', 'Beatles', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'context', 'were', 'set', 'were', 'several', 'things', 'were', 'surprising', 'me.First', 'had', ""n't"", 'realised', 'how', 'minimal', 'staging', 'was', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'there', 'fancy', 'sets', 'were', 'hardly', 'sets', 'Most', 'acts', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'performed', 'front', 'curtains', 'Coupled', 'was', 'low-key', 'nature', 'presentation', 'exemplified', 'style', 'Mr.', 'Sullivan', 'days', 'presenters', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'done', 'job', 'scream', 'introductions', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'simply', 'said', 'few', 'words', 'then', 'allowed', 'acts', 'speak', 'themselves.Second', 'area', 'improved', 'considerably', 'lighting', 'stage', 'Evidently', 'time', 'lights', 'were', 'very', 'bright', 'very', 'hot', 'result', 'performers', 'were', 'visibly', 'drenched', 'sweat', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'Paul', 'was', 'glistening', 'marathon', 'runner', 'poor', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'was', 'actually', 'dripping', 'found', 'quite', 'distracting', 'obviously', 'did', 'Ms.', 'Gaynor.Third', 'indeed', 'are', 'full', 'shows', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'limited', 'commercial', 'interruptions', 'were', 'was', 'generally', 'only', 'one', 'most', 'two', 'advertisements', 'act', 'Beatles', 'Mitzi', 'Gaynor', 'biggest', 'stars', 'view', 'were', 'able', 'perform', 'several', 'numbers', 'commercial', 'interruptions', 'commercials', 'were', 'rather', 'endearing', 'earnestness', 'striving', 'show', 'what', 'good', 'quality', 'products', 'were', 'Only', 'cosmetics', 'medical', 'products', 'appear', 'have', 'primary', 'objective', 'now', 'most', 'others', 'being', 'humorous', 'appealing', 'desire', 'status.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'believer', 'everything', 'was', 'better', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'program', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'considerably', 'reworked', 'get', 'kind', 'audience', 'now', 'However', 'commendable', 'shows', 'are', 'still', 'available', 'allow', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'America', 'was', 'watching', '1964', 'British', 'TV', 'companies', 'alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'retaining', 'archival', 'material', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'broadcast', 'Britain', 'time', 'been', 'lost', 'forever.Well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'fans', 'Beatles', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'early', '1960s', 'period']",N/A

I am very happy with the video, but find the original performances kind of humerous because of some of the stage gaffs like microphones not being at the correct height, and the sound not being fed into the mixer properly.  I had forgotten that Ed Sullivan devoted a large part of three shows in a row just to the Beatles.  Ed really knew how to find talented people for his shows.  I also chuckled about all the times he told the Beatles they were nice and well behaved boys that would make England proud.
