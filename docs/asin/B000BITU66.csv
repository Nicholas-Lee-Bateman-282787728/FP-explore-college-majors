I agree the puppets inbetween episodes is pretty boring for the 2, but the 4 is moderately interested. Calillou is 4 and has a younger sister around 1, so it fits our family well. I like these quite a bit, definitely worth getting if you are looking for a calm ""cartoon"".",5,great for 2 and 4 year olds,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,380,"['Caillou', 'bit', 'annoying', 'voice', 'first', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'quite', 'sweet', 'boy', 'agree', 'puppets', 'inbetween', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'boring', '2', '4', 'moderately', 'interested', 'Calillou', '4', 'younger', 'sister', '1', 'family', 'well', 'quite', 'bit', 'definitely', 'getting', 'are', 'looking', 'calm', 'cartoon']",N/A

Now, I understand that it is a Canadian production - I used to live in Canada, and I'm well attuned to the differences between American and Canadian programming.However, I have to honestly say that I have never seen, nor never wish to see again, the multiple silly (read: idiotic) segments that take place between Caillou episodes. Dancing children with someone singing (sounds like the person who voices Caillou), a little girl going on a car ride with her mother, etc.My daughter kept coming over to me and asking ""Where's Caillou? I wanted to watch Caillou?""I wanted to say ""Well, honey, Santa obviously messed up big time with this one...""If you want all Caillou, which I'm guessing all Caillou fans want, this is not the video for you.

The DVD here contains the following episodes: We All Love to Travel, Caillou the Explorer, Caillou's Sailboat, Caillou's Train Trip, Exploring the Neighborhood, New House, New Neighbors, Garage Sale, and Supper with Sarah.The stories themselves are interesting and educational. My only grouse is the puppet segment where we have Caillou's stuffed dino, and pet cat Gilbert among others doing their own thing. It is quite annoying, and my daughter doesn't care much for them. I think they've cut those segments out in the more recent Caillou stories on PBS [thank goodness!], but this DVD still has those segments. Yet, it's nothing a fast forward button can't help, and I would still recommend the Caillou series for young children, especially the 2-4 age group.",4,The Caillou stories are great for preschoolers!,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,955,"['3.5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'absolutely', 'Caillou', '-there', 'something', 'little', 'bald-headed', '4', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'unusual', 'name', 'boisterous', 'personality', 'just', 'DVD', 'here', 'following', 'episodes', 'Love', 'Travel', 'Caillou', 'Explorer', 'Caillou', 'Sailboat', 'Caillou', 'Train', 'Trip', 'Exploring', 'Neighborhood', 'New', 'House', 'New', 'Neighbors', 'Garage', 'Sale', 'Supper', 'Sarah.The', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'educational', 'only', 'grouse', 'puppet', 'segment', 'where', 'have', 'Caillou', 'stuffed', 'dino', 'pet', 'cat', 'Gilbert', 'others', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'quite', 'annoying', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'think', ""'ve"", 'cut', 'segments', 'out', 'more', 'recent', 'Caillou', 'stories', 'PBS', '[', 'thank', 'goodness', ']', 'DVD', 'still', 'segments', 'Yet', 'nothing', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'Caillou', 'series', 'young', 'children', 'especially', '2-4', 'age', 'group']",N/A
