1653636,A3AKGNB4UMSAI1,B00D49YEHO,"Anne ""4x4""","[2, 19]","Watched the first 2 hours last night. We spent the entire 2 hours comparing it to the Selfridge movie of last year. Moray looks very much like Selfridge. The woman who wants to marry Moray & whose father is loaning him the money to expand his store, looks so much like the wife in Selfrige that the people who made Selfridge must wonder if the Paradise people were making a carbon copy movie & for what purpose? Kind of like making the same dress to sell in a shop across the street from a shop that already sells it???  The rest of the 2 hours were spent trying to figure out in what other movies did we see some of the actors, Downtown Abbey, Lark Rise to Candleford & Last Tango in Halifax(on the same night no less).  I have often wondered (no disrespect here as I am a British descendant & love the country)if Britain has more than 29 actors/actresses? As far as the Paradise movie, well, the costumes are nice but the story is so predictable. Maybe after seeing the entire show, I will come back & modify my review. Not trying the bash this movie but it's really too close in substance to Selfridges where ""THE SALE IS OVER"".UPdate: I just learned that the Paradise was made before Selfridge. Both series are still a ""watch it one time"", ""been there, done that"". So, to who ever made the ""copy"", please don't copy the copy. :)",3,Reminds me of Selfridges of last year,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1332,"['Watched', 'first', '2', 'hours', 'last', 'night', 'spent', 'entire', '2', 'hours', 'comparing', 'Selfridge', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'Moray', 'very', 'much', 'Selfridge', 'woman', 'who', 'marry', 'Moray', 'father', 'loaning', 'money', 'expand', 'store', 'so', 'much', 'wife', 'Selfrige', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'Selfridge', 'must', 'wonder', 'Paradise', 'people', 'were', 'making', 'carbon', 'copy', 'movie', 'what', 'purpose', 'Kind', 'making', 'same', 'dress', 'sell', 'shop', 'street', 'shop', 'already', 'rest', '2', 'hours', 'were', 'spent', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'other', 'movies', 'did', 'see', 'actors', 'Downtown', 'Abbey', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Halifax', 'same', 'night', 'no', 'less', 'have', 'often', 'wondered', 'disrespect', 'here', 'am', 'British', 'descendant', 'love', 'country', 'Britain', 'more', '29', 'actors/actresses', 'As', 'far', 'Paradise', 'movie', 'well', 'costumes', 'are', 'nice', 'story', 'so', 'predictable', 'Maybe', 'seeing', 'entire', 'show', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'modify', 'review', 'Not', 'trying', 'bash', 'movie', 'really', 'too', 'close', 'substance', 'Selfridges', 'where', 'SALE', 'IS', 'OVER', '.UPdate', 'just', 'learned', 'Paradise', 'was', 'made', 'Selfridge', 'Both', 'series', 'are', 'still', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'So', 'who', 'ever', 'made', 'copy', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'copy', 'copy']",The Paradise: Season 1

Coming straight off another period show that was all melodrama and scandal, I found this one a pleasant change of pace. I can understand why The Paradise was canceled after only two seasons -- a lot of viewers won't have the patience for it. The tension is low and the story focuses on small incidents in the daily lives of the characters. There's no extramarital affairs, no shocking secrets, nobody is ever hovering on the verge of social ruin. At least, not in season one (I've yet to watch season two).

1653661,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00D49YEHO,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[3, 3]","The Paradise erupts with stunning pre-Victorian costuming and sets. The background orchestration enhances the multi-threaded storyline. It's already into Season two, and expect more. This is a BBC must-OWN DVD set that stimulates repeated viewing. It is a sumptuous period costume series of haberdashery, notions, cobblestones, chicanery, toppers, and fraught with unrequited love.It's not historic perfection, as the characters are ""LIKE"" the book written over 100 years ago, but only a couple have the same name. It takes place in London, not the original Paris setting. Many changes have occurred for the integrity of a delightful modern television audience, such as some architecture a bit earlier, more color than true to the time, but the changes have only accentuated the original novel of Emile Zola. There is an Emile Zola on the series writing credits; would love to know if there is a family relationship.I find the cast outstanding, each portraying a character as finely as the costume demands. Denise (Joanna Vanderham -Young James Herriot) is beautiful and her vitality spills from the screen. Shop owner, Moray (Edmun Elliot) drives the department store and the show with his mix of emotional moments. Miss Aubrey (Sarah Lancashire -Last Tango in Halifax) is a tyrant and adversary of the young working girls. She was also outstanding in ""Lark Rise to Candleford"", as were several of ""The Paradise"" cast. i.e. Pauline (Ruby Bentall) with a fun characterization done exquisitely, so why is she dropped from the cast for season 2? Also from Lark Rise is a main character, Dudley (Matthew McNulty) always pleasing to the ladies' eye. The list is long.SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes1--Victorian England's 1st department store, owned by widower Moray, hires a young country, Peebles, shop girl; beautiful, creative, and ambitious. Since staff lives in the premises, it is a bit of Upstairs, downstairs reversed.2--In a bold unprecedented move of a store-wide low-price sale, The Paradise sets its reputation and market position for the future, a wealthy prospect.3--This is an exceptionally emotional episode for all Paradise staff as a baby is abandoned in the department store. Olivia Hallinan (Lark Rise to Candleford) guest stars.4--Head of ladies wear gets a pox and a temp replacement creates havoc when a new large patron is expected.5--Moray's romantic proweresses conflict with The Paradise expansion.

1653668,A28QU1UG32PYNV,B00D49YEHO,"Katie A. E. ""Words-at-war""","[0, 1]","The Paradise [Au Bonheur des Dames (The Ladies' Delight or The Ladies' Paradise)], based on the 11th installment of a French series by Emile Zola, has been completely reformatted and rewritten as the British version of the book.Denise Lovett (Joanna Vanderham) is a country bumpkin with big dreams but sharp business instinct. She moves to the big city, seeking employment at one of England's first retail department stores geared toward women, for women: The Paradise. The man behind this innovative notion is rags-to-riches businessman John Moray (Emun Elliott), a man haunted by the death of his beloved wife while driven by the need to succeed and make The Paradise a household name--by any means necessary.This eight episode shows the daily activities of the shop and its employees as much as the intrigue of Moray, and his highbrow love interest, Katherine Glendenning (Elaine Cassidy), the daughter of a wealthy banker helping to finance an expansion. Under the soap opera episodes is the economic upheavals brought on by a mass market retail shop slowly overtaking small businesses in that area--including Denise's feisty pig-headed uncle Edmund (Peter Wight), a local dressmaker--as well as the social interchanges between the haves and the have nots.I have not read the book so I have no idea how close of an 'adaptation' the TV version is to the book but no matter. I did enjoy elements of *this* Paradise, such as the actors who all did quite well (though there was a lot of overacting in some scenes) as well as the costuming and music. It really made up for several caveats--specifically the plot (episodically as well as the overall arch for the whole season) and character development.Ultimately, this boils down to the writing, which wasn't bad but did not deliver anything new or fresh or exciting. The first episode was handled poorly and so rushed. We were hardly introduced to the characters and background of the Paradise before we were expected to understand or decide if this character or that one were good, or bad for Denise. I had no idea what was going on other than Denise's entry into the Paradise. From there and into the next 2-3 episodes, there was a lot of inconsistency with character development and representation. All the characters, except Denise, were not established until the middle of the season, either one way or the other from episode to episode, and rather confusing. The romance between Denise and Moray was a bit stilted and forced though toward the end of the season, it becomes easier and the real chemistry blooms. This is where chemistry makes up for a lot. But like the mumbled mess of episode one, and a couple other episodes that felt rather random and uneven, the last episode leaves us at a cliffhanger and rather rushed.While I think the acting was good, I think the writing limited the characters to really stretch themselves to the kind of performances that really pull at the heart strings, or creates a worthy advisory to root against. I think it also forced actors to portray their characters already based on characters before them--from Mr. Selfridge to Downtown Abby, any costume period British TV/Movie--rather than reaching for originality and seeking a different appeal. It sort of just relied on the fact that it's a period piece with elaborate costumes, etc. The set was obviously a set so, at times, there was a sense that it was on a theater stage and took away some of the sense of authenticity. Overall, there wasn't a lot of excitement, or rather, surprise and the sex appeal that the description supplies isn't fulfilled but only hinted at, and again, never really goes anywhere. The mild mystery of how Moray's wife died and it's very mild use to make the series seem darker, was a bit hackneyed and lackluster.Despite my criticisms, The Paradise has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing what Season 2 brings. I just hope the writing gets better and is less pedestrian.The 'extras' was a basic and short background on the development of the show and the actor's perception of their characters.

1653670,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D49YEHO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[113, 124]","Looking for a stately British period piece about a burgeoning retail empire?  No, I'm not talking about ""Mr Selfridge.""  Prior to the ITV Studios depiction of London's elite shopping emporium Selfridges in 2013, the BBC had already unleashed the handsome production ""The Paradise"" in 2012.  Somebody has a love of shopping!  Or maybe they just think that the birth and heyday of department stores makes a sexy setting for romantic entanglements and personal intrigue!  Of course, ""Mr Selfridge"" was the first to receive distribution in the North American market being picked up by Masterpiece Theater, undoubtedly due to the presence of Jeremy Piven in the lead role.  But don't let that dissuade you from sampling ""The Paradise.""  Ostensibly based on the novel ""The Ladies' Paradise"" (Au Bonheur des Dames) by Emile Zola, the adaptation may not fully satisfy purists looking for Zola's vision.  There are glimpses of his style, but this is a decidedly soapier affair.  But that's not all bad for a TV series.  And this one does share many of the same charms as ""Mr Selfridge"" and boasts comparable production values (though without so many ostentatious hats).  Truthfully, I was not a huge fan of the over-sized Piven performance in ""Mr Selfridge,"" so I thought this more restrained approach worked even better.Okay, that's it.  I won't mention that other show again!  The comparison just seems inevitable, so I thought I'd address it right away.""The Paradise"" details the formation of the first department store in the North of England circa the 1870s.  This glamorous environment is a backdrop for the intertwined stories of the workers, traders, and shoppers who have made the Paradise part of their world.  Initially, we see things from the outside.  A local independent shopkeeper is being put out of business by the more elegant new department store.  When his niece (Joanna Vanderham) arrives in town, he is mortified when she is offered a job at the rival establishment.  The oily proprietor John Moray (played by Emun Elliott) knows talent when he sees it!  Alternately charming and distinctly creepy, it's hard what to make of Elliott's performance.  I don't know that I particularly believed it, but he has some uncomfortably (maybe even unintentionally) funny scenes as he seeks to corrupt the young miss.  Of course, Vanderham is soon seduced by the charms of the big city values prevalent in the Paradise.  Under the watchful and critical eye of Sarah Lancashire (who despite her youthfulness appears to be in grand dame mode chewing scenery left and right), our demure heroine will learn to navigate the political and romantic intrigues that can only lead to success.Season One of ""The Paradise"" consists of eight episodes and a second season has been commissioned.  While a nice diversion if you enjoy lightweight romance, ""The Paradise"" should not necessarily be oversold.  It's too episodic by nature, storylines are wrapped up rather conveniently.  It lacks the depth and drama to make it an instant classic or a must-see entertainment.  But it is pleasant enough, and has modest enough ambitions, to be successful for exactly what it is.  I suspect that those who are attuned to this specific genre will be easily seduced by its charms.  Others, however, might be a harder sell.  While not always enthralled by leads Vanderham and Elliott, many of the supporting cast offer a bit more color.  In addition to the aforementioned Lancashire, Patrick Malahide as Lord Glendenning and David Hayman as Jonas offer further villainy and grandiosity.  A fun and lightweight period piece for the right audience.

1653677,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B00D49YEHO,L. M. Keefer,"[14, 16]","To a young Scottish country woman in the 1880's, the allure of a big city in Northern England offers shops, suitors, sin and seduction. At least, that is what is being served up in The Paradise. Are we ready for one more English period drama in which the costumes star as much as the actors? Of course we are. The 1880's are one of the prettiest fashion decades ever with ruffles, folds, pleats, bustles, lace, decollette, and the hour-glass silhouette accompanied by a parasol and a fetching hat. The men are dapper, too.In this series, country girl Denise Lovett (Joanna Vanderham of WHAT MAISIE KNEW) is hired to work at The Paradise shop by the shop's deeply dimpled, bedroom-eyed owner, Mr. John Moray (Emun Elliott of BLACK WATCH and GAME OF THRONES). Whispered rumors of the suspicious death of Moray's rich young wife swirl around Lovett. Although Moray is courting another lady, Katherine Glendenning (Elaine Cassidy of HARPER'S ISLAND) from a gentrified family of wealth, it's clear to us, the audience, that Moray is intensely attracted to our country lass Lovett. And his intentions toward the innocent Lovett may not be honorable. Part of the dramatic tension is that you can't tell if Moray is a total cad, or might be redeemable and protect young Lovett's virtue.Is Lovett attracted to him? Possibly, almost certainly, but she confesses she doesn't want to marry him, she wants to BE him. She is creative, spirited and plucky, so she may be a match for his ambition.Based on the 1883 Emile Zola novel ""Au Bonheur des Dames"" (""The Ladies Paradise""), this production was created and written by Bill Gallagher who produced LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD. For those of us who can't get enough of these costumed English period dramas, this will probably be a five star bit of fluff, fripperies and frivolity for us.",5,"Shops, Suitors & Seduction",1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,1818,"['young', 'Scottish', 'country', 'woman', '1880', 'allure', 'big', 'city', 'Northern', 'England', 'shops', 'suitors', 'sin', 'seduction', 'least', 'what', 'being', 'served', 'up', 'Paradise', 'Are', 'ready', 'one', 'more', 'English', 'period', 'drama', 'costumes', 'star', 'as', 'much', 'actors', 'course', 'are', '1880', 'are', 'one', 'prettiest', 'fashion', 'decades', 'ever', 'ruffles', 'folds', 'pleats', 'bustles', 'lace', 'decollette', 'hour-glass', 'silhouette', 'accompanied', 'parasol', 'fetching', 'hat', 'men', 'are', 'dapper', 'too.In', 'series', 'country', 'girl', 'Denise', 'Lovett', 'Joanna', 'Vanderham', 'WHAT', 'MAISIE', 'KNEW', 'hired', 'work', 'Paradise', 'shop', 'shop', 'deeply', 'dimpled', 'bedroom-eyed', 'owner', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Moray', 'Emun', 'Elliott', 'BLACK', 'WATCH', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'Whispered', 'rumors', 'suspicious', 'death', 'Moray', 'rich', 'young', 'wife', 'swirl', 'Lovett', 'Moray', 'courting', 'lady', 'Katherine', 'Glendenning', 'Elaine', 'Cassidy', 'HARPER', 'ISLAND', 'gentrified', 'family', 'wealth', 'clear', 'audience', 'Moray', 'intensely', 'attracted', 'country', 'lass', 'Lovett', 'intentions', 'innocent', 'Lovett', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'honorable', 'Part', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Moray', 'total', 'cad', 'might', 'be', 'redeemable', 'protect', 'young', 'Lovett', 'virtue.Is', 'Lovett', 'attracted', 'Possibly', 'almost', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'BE', 'creative', 'spirited', 'plucky', 'may', 'be', 'match', 'ambition.Based', '1883', 'Emile', 'Zola', 'Au', 'Bonheur', 'des', 'Dames', 'Ladies', 'Paradise', 'production', 'was', 'created', 'written', 'Bill', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'produced', 'LARK', 'RISE', 'TO', 'CANDLEFORD', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'costumed', 'English', 'period', 'dramas', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'five', 'star', 'bit', 'fluff', 'fripperies', 'frivolity']",The Paradise: Season 1

1653679,A2VF25F0XZHXMW,B00D49YEHO,London Fog,"[101, 112]","Set in an undisclosed location in the north of England during the 1870s, 'The Paradise' is a historically accurate period drama regarding Britain's first department store, and the lives of those people affected by it. From Mr Moray, who struggles to make his visionary enterprise thrive, to the small shopkeepers he has inadvertently put out of business, to the the wealthy Glendennings and humble employees alike. Everyone, including the side characters, are richly drawn and come to life. Especially Denise, who quickly proves adept at her position in lady's wear (much to the chagrin of Miss Audrey, the strict departmental head who Sarah Lancashire plays to such perfection, she steals every scene), and becomes something of a love interest to Moray. The tension there, I might add, is lovely, and plays a role in the last episode's cliffhanger. Thankfully, 'The Paradise' has been recommissioned for a second series.In addition to the character driven story lines, this made for a nice look at the class divisions in Victorian England, how the worlds of the working class and the nouveau riche differed so enormously, yet in the end were both equally plagued by very human problems. It was a treat to watch simply for the respect paid to the era, and truly, this was a wonderful example of British programming.In fact, I would go so far as saying this is arguably one of the best BBC productions in recent years, with its lush attention to detail in spite of the more limited budget, the authentic sets, sharp dialogue and impressive costumes. I was beginning to despair that the BBC would ever produce a period drama of such high calibre again, but I am glad to have been proven so wrong in that regard. This is exactly the quality I have come to expect from the BBC in years past, and am delighted to see the return of that class and wit that once defined the majority of British television.

The Paradise, the latest series to come from a collaboration between the Beeb and PBS, is one series that captures the heart and the imagination unlike any other. With lush sets, complex characters, and a terrific storyline, The Paradise is sure to please those who can't get enough of a good, clean story.Set in the latter half of the 19th century, The Paradise gives viewers a peek into the lives of those responsible for establishing a department store and keeping it afloat. But that's not all, glimpses into the everyday lives of all involved from the orphaned errand boy to the wealthy Glenndennings give the series its light-hearted moments as well as high drama. Starring relative newcomers Emun Elliott and the beautiful Joanna Vanderham as well as seasoned veterans, Elaine Cassidy and Sarah Lancashire, the department store of yore is brought to life in an intriguing and subtly sexy manner!From the very first heated glance between Denise Lovett and John Moray to the last breathtaking scene of the finale, it's difficult to take your eyes off of the screen. Denise's wide-eyed, country girl innocence, Moray's take charge, brook no nonsense character, the very creepy and strangely loyal Jonas, and the bubbly and silly shop girl Pauline are the stars of this story. This series has less sordid and overall more appealing story-lines than this year's other department store drama, Mr. Selfridge. Moray is far more likable and more genuine a character than Selfridge and Elliott is a thousand times more suited for the role than Piven for Selfridge. While I preferred the more authentic store setting at Selfridge's over The Paradise, there's no question that The Paradise is the better series.Similar to Lark Rise to Candleford, The Paradise offers a quality of entertainment that is second to none and is a great series to watch with the entire family!The Paradise, Season One is available now on DVD and Blu-ray from retailers.~ My Rating: 5 out of 5 stars (A favorite!) ~*I received a complimentary copy from the publisher/publicist for review purposes.

The acting is very good, the actors are superb, very convincing and comfortable in their roles and the character development is so good as to make the viewer look forward to what is to come next. The women are beautiful, the men handsome (each in his own way, even Jonas if you think about it).  Their destiny concerns us but the continuity of the series has a few bumps in it between the first and second seasons from what little I&#8217;ve been able to find out on the Internet.  I fear the screenwriters aren&#8217;t stretching this out enough or perhaps have ended up in a drunken stupor due to writers block.  I hope not.  I recorded the series as it appeared on my TV but found that they deleted scenes which appear on DVD and that makes me feel Masterpiece Theater has cheated me!  Many will disagree with me and consider the omitted material inconsequential but then perhaps you are too easily pleased.  So much work went into making this sumptuous production and it should be in your collection, buy it!",5,"Superb acting and actors, very well written",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1488,"['series', 'such', 'delight', 'wondered', 'was', 'influenced', '8220', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', '8221', 'preceded', 'TV', 'due', 'writing', 'Emile', 'Zola', 'author', '8217', 'never', 'read', 'lot', 'talent', 'aided', 'final', 'production', 'never', 'appreciate', 'knowledge', 'what', 'making', 'film', 'were', 'know', 'story', 'names', 'listed', 'credits', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'better', 'idea', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'very', 'convincing', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'good', 'make', 'viewer', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'come', 'next', 'women', 'are', 'beautiful', 'men', 'handsome', 'own', 'way', 'even', 'Jonas', 'think', 'destiny', 'concerns', 'continuity', 'series', 'few', 'bumps', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'what', 'little', '8217', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'Internet', 'fear', 'screenwriters', 'aren', '8217', 'stretching', 'out', 'enough', 'perhaps', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'due', 'writers', 'block', 'hope', 'not', 'recorded', 'series', 'appeared', 'TV', 'found', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'appear', 'DVD', 'feel', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'cheated', 'Many', 'will', 'disagree', 'consider', 'omitted', 'material', 'inconsequential', 'then', 'perhaps', 'are', 'too', 'easily', 'pleased', 'So', 'much', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'sumptuous', 'production', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'buy']",The Paradise: Season 1
1653694,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00D49YEHO,Russell Fanelli,"[95, 104]","The Paradise is the new Masterpiece Theater series that started Sunday, Oct. 6.  Amazon viewers are almost unanimous in their praise of this fine program.We are immediately introduced to our heroine Denise, well played by Joanna Vanderham, who has just come to the city from the country.  She tries to get a job from her uncle, but his store is being slowly put out of business by an exciting new department store called The Paradise.  Denise applies for and is given a job on probation as a trainee in dress sales.The owner of The Paradise, Mr. Moray, played well by Emun Elliott, is determined to make his establishment the finest store of its kind in England.  He has plenty of good ideas, but lacks the money to put his ideas into practice.  He seeks financial assistance from Lord Glendenning, well played by the veteran actor Patrick Malahide. Lord Glendenning takes an interest in Moray only because his daughter loves the young man and begs her father to help him.  It appears that Moray takes advantage of young Lady Glendenning because she is useful to him, but he finds country girl Denise with her bright intelligence, attractive looks, and good ideas more to his liking.The conflicts in the story come from many sources.  First, paying the bills and developing the business bring Moray into many disagreements with his conservative partner.  Then the shop girls with their high spirits have a variety of problems keeping out of trouble.  Lastly, and the focus of the first installment, a draper in the store is caught kissing the friend of young Lady Glendenning and is danger of being sacked.  All these plot lines are well connected and the writing, acting, and directing are first-rate.The Paradise has the excellent production values that we expect from Masterpiece Theater.  It looks good and succeeds in pulling us in to the world of the high end department store where much of the action of the story takes place.  I have only seen the first program in the series, but am already looking forward to next Sunday and part two of this entertaining adaptation of Emile Zola's fine novel, The Ladies Paradise, which is now available on Kindle.I will update this review after watching the show next week.Update one: The second installment of The Paradise presented an interesting problem: What should Moray do with a newborn baby left abandoned in the store.  True to his character, he decided to care for the baby in the store and use the child as a promotional device to build sales.  Of course, Denise has ideas about how to turn the problem of caring for the child into an opportunity to expand the services of the store.  This second installment provided much human interest and also helped us learn more about the important characters in the series.  I enjoyed the second installment even more than the first, perhaps because I now know the extensive cast of characters who each have their problems that are cleverly related to the discovery and care for The Paradise baby.  I look forward to next week and the continuing story of The Paradise.  Highly recommended.Update two: Miss Audrey,in charge of dress sales and well-played by Sarah Lancashire, becomes ill and takes to her bed.  Denise is named to replace her.  Denise convinces Mr. Moray that Miss Audrey's illness is stress related and that he should praise and reward her, which he does; she becomes well and returns to work.  Additionally, Miss Glendenning decides to renew her romance with Moray.  This third episode of the series lacked the drama and conflict of the first two installments.  I trust that the series will return to form next week.Update three:  The Paradise has taken a dramatically different turn in Epidode Three by introducing a bit of skullduggery.  Moray buys out a barber who owns a shop across the street from The Paradise by offering him a limited partnership in the business.  The barber turns out to be an embarrassment and Moray wants to get rid of him, but Mr. Jonas tells Moray that the barber has dangerous secrets about the mysterious death of Moray's wife.  The plot thickens.  Meanwhile, Denise continues to contribute useful ideas to the store.  This was an excellent installment and a return to form for the series.Update four: Denise has now left The Paradise to work with her uncle, a dressmaker whose shop across the street from The Paradise has fallen on hard times.  This marks a new beginning for this excellent series.  Now Denise has a chance to practice her entrepreneurial skills.  She brings other store owners on the street together to form a cooperative to compete with The Paradise and is initially successful only to fail in the end.  The plucky Denise is now the central character in this fine series.  That being said, we can expect twists and turns to keep us interested in The Paradise and the extensive cast of characters.  I look forward to Sunday evening and a new installment of this fine Masterpiece Theater program.Final update: Instead of tying up plot strands neatly to end the first season of The Paradise, much is left unresolved.  We must wait patiently to pick up the story of Moray and Denise, the Glendennings (father and daughter), Miss Audrey, Mr. Jonas, etc.  We are given strong hints about what will happen when we resume our story, but we can't be sure we are correct -- just what the filmmakers want, to keep us in suspense.I, for one, will be coming back to The Paradise next season.  This series fits nicely into the tradition of high quality programs we have come to expect from Masterpiece Theater.

Following her brief but very interesting probationary term she earns a permanent place on staff at The Paradise. There is plenty of competition between the  workers and some (well of course) drama from the patrons. Moray, the store founder, constantly challenges himself to bring in new clients and endeavors to grow The Paradise substantially.Denise, played by Joanna Vanderham, finds imaginative, wonderful solutions for the many predicaments and conundrums of working with the public. Especially one where class and propriety dictate. She never misses a beat when finding a fix, but she's still learning how to &#34;tactfully&#34; deliver.&#34;The Paradise&#34; is a great tv series.

1653700,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00D49YEHO,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[13, 14]","First a note: Amazon combines both DVD and Bluray reviews when posting them. You should always look to see which version of the producted the reviewer is referring to. Now on to my review:Okay, there are plenty of detailed reviews here of this BBC production which, though created before the ITV production of ""Mr. Selfridge"" - another story about the owner of a British department store- made it's appearance on PBS's Masterpiece Theater more recently, so I won't repeat much of the information and do my best not to provide any ""spoilers"".The DVD and Bluray home video versions (I watched the BD) came out later as well.You'll find my review of ""Mr. Selfridge"" here on Amazon and I honestly have to say that I enjoyed both. They are ""similar"" yet ""different"". MS is historical fiction and takes place just after 1900; TP was written (in a novel by Emile Zola) to take place in the mid-1800s but was updated to the later 1800s for the television version. Both focus on the owner of the department store as well as his love interest - whether it is his wife or his fianc&eacute;e. And there are side stories about the employees in the store. And both DVD/BDs are of ""Season One"", so there will be followups.""The Paradise"" consists of eight episodes - each running 61 minutes for a total of just over eight hours.  I found myself so engrossed in it, that I started ""binge watching"" with two or three episodes each night. As I got to the end, I wasn't sure that the stories would be completed or whether there is a ""cliff hanger"". After all, I'd invested eight hours of my life to following the story line.  I feel that I will prevent you from really enjoying this series by telling you much about the plot and really recommend that you be judicious in reading reviews with spoilers. The important thing to know when Season One ends is that there IS a Season 2, though not yet released in the US - and no target date listed. A little research (not much; I want to be surprised too) showed that Season Two picks up one-year after the action in Season One ends. How you feel about the ending of Season One will depend on which characters you associated with.As for the cast, they are wonderful though I couldn't quite understand the inner thoughts of John Moray - the department store owner (who surprisingly everyone - including his fianc&eacute;e - call him only by his last name!). But I was smitten (and you will surely be also) by actress Joanna Vanderham as the new sales clerk who works her way up the ""ladder"" with her brilliant marketing ideas. She is both GORGEOUS and smart.The plot involves two major themes: ""secrets"" and ""loyalty"". They form the basis for most every scene.The images on the BD are just glorious and sharp. There is one bonus feature which adds to the enjoyment of the show (but don't watch until after you have seen all eight episodes). It's a 30-minute ""Behind The Scenes"" featuring comments by most of the major cast members (and it's then that you know ""who played who"") as well as the production team.I guess if there is a weakness to this BD (and reason I'm giving it only four stars) it is that not all the loose ends are tied up and you are left hanging in the end awaiting the (possible) release of Season Two.  It would have been better to feel fulfilled at the conclusion and - for me, at least - it didn't happen.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"BD Review with no spoilers  -Gorgeous set and Costumes; engaging cast; but ""to be continued""-",1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,3442,"['First', 'note', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'when', 'posting', 'should', 'always', 'look', 'see', 'version', 'producted', 'reviewer', 'referring', 'Now', 'review', 'Okay', 'are', 'plenty', 'detailed', 'reviews', 'here', 'BBC', 'production', 'though', 'created', 'ITV', 'production', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'story', 'owner', 'British', 'department', 'store-', 'made', 'appearance', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'more', 'recently', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'much', 'information', 'do', 'best', 'not', 'provide', 'spoilers', '.The', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'home', 'video', 'versions', 'watched', 'BD', 'came', 'out', 'later', 'well.You', ""'ll"", 'find', 'review', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'here', 'Amazon', 'honestly', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'similar', 'yet', 'different', 'MS', 'historical', 'fiction', 'place', 'just', '1900', 'TP', 'was', 'written', 'novel', 'Emile', 'Zola', 'take', 'place', 'mid-1800s', 'was', 'updated', 'later', '1800s', 'television', 'version', 'focus', 'owner', 'department', 'store', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'interest', 'wife', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'are', 'side', 'stories', 'employees', 'store', 'DVD/BDs', 'are', 'Season', 'One', 'will', 'be', 'followups', 'Paradise', 'eight', 'episodes', 'running', '61', 'minutes', 'total', 'just', 'eight', 'hours', 'found', 'so', 'engrossed', 'started', 'binge', 'watching', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'night', 'got', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'completed', 'cliff', 'hanger', ""'d"", 'invested', 'eight', 'hours', 'life', 'following', 'story', 'line', 'feel', 'will', 'prevent', 'really', 'enjoying', 'series', 'telling', 'much', 'plot', 'really', 'recommend', 'be', 'judicious', 'reading', 'reviews', 'spoilers', 'important', 'thing', 'know', 'when', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', '2', 'not', 'yet', 'released', 'US', 'target', 'date', 'listed', 'little', 'research', 'not', 'much', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'too', 'showed', 'Season', 'Two', 'one-year', 'action', 'Season', 'One', 'How', 'feel', 'ending', 'Season', 'One', 'will', 'depend', 'characters', 'associated', 'with.As', 'cast', 'are', 'wonderful', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'John', 'Moray', 'department', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'everyone', 'including', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'call', 'only', 'last', 'name', 'was', 'smitten', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'also', 'actress', 'Joanna', 'Vanderham', 'new', 'sales', 'clerk', 'who', 'way', 'ladder', 'brilliant', 'marketing', 'ideas', 'GORGEOUS', 'smart.The', 'plot', 'two', 'major', 'themes', 'secrets', 'loyalty', 'form', 'basis', 'most', 'scene.The', 'images', 'BD', 'are', 'just', 'glorious', 'sharp', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'eight', 'episodes', '30-minute', 'Scenes', 'featuring', 'comments', 'most', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'then', 'know', 'who', 'played', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'production', 'team.I', 'guess', 'weakness', 'BD', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'end', 'awaiting', 'possible', 'release', 'Season', 'Two', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'feel', 'fulfilled', 'conclusion', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Paradise: Season 1

Since Mr. Selfridge was thoroughly enjoyable, that is not a bad thing. The Paradise is about a Britain's first department store starting out in London and gradually expanding until it takes up the whole neighborhood, swallowing smaller mom & pop shops. The store's owner, John Moray, a grieving widower, has an on-again, off-again relationship with his rich banker's daughter while lusting after the pretty country bumpkin employee who turned out to be an expert in retail in spite of her innocent youth. The characters are believable, the lush period clothing and sets a pleasure and the story line keeps you coming back episode after episode. The Paradise is a joy to watch and highly recommended.",5,Better than Mr. Selfridge or just a carbon copy?
