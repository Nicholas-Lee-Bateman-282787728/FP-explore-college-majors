Now I can barely contain my frustration that the genre of variety television is gone. The best thing about this DVD is that it gets right to the point; it has a modern-day intro by Mr. Williams himself, then segues immediately into the clips (which also make up the DVD's menu of scenes)- and captions everything, from guest star name to airdate and year. Look for the *4* Osmond brothers (sans Donny, but with baby Marie); Pearl Bailey at her most diva; Carlos Jobim performing &quot;Girl From Ipanema&quot; in Spanish [with Mr. Williams doing so in English]; a &quot;clown makeup&quot; fight with Judy Garland; a marvelous duet with Ella Fitzgerald; and a marvelous 'triplet' with Eddie Fisher and Bobby Darin. Most impressive about the show is the star himself: he seemed (and seems) to be a genuinely kind, genial, humble, humorous guy, and I'm not the least bit surprised that his show enjoyed an amazing nine-year run. Hope he reads this someday.",4,He seems to be just a plain old nice guy.,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,1046,"['show', 'started', 'year', 'was', 'born', 'ended', 'really', 'got', 'watching', 'television', 'Now', 'can', 'barely', 'contain', 'frustration', 'genre', 'variety', 'television', 'gone', 'best', 'thing', 'DVD', 'right', 'point', 'modern-day', 'intro', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'then', 'immediately', 'clips', 'also', 'make', 'up', 'DVD', 'menu', 'scenes', 'captions', 'everything', 'guest', 'star', 'name', 'airdate', 'year', 'Look', '*4*', 'Osmond', 'brothers', 'sans', 'Donny', 'baby', 'Marie', 'Pearl', 'Bailey', 'most', 'diva', 'Carlos', 'Jobim', 'performing', 'quot', 'Girl', 'From', 'Ipanema', 'quot', 'Spanish', '[', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'doing', 'so', 'English', ']', 'quot', 'clown', 'makeup', 'quot', 'fight', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'marvelous', 'duet', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'marvelous', ""'triplet"", 'Eddie', 'Fisher', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Most', 'impressive', 'show', 'star', 'seemed', 'be', 'genuinely', 'kind', 'genial', 'humble', 'humorous', 'guy', ""'m"", 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'surprised', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'amazing', 'nine-year', 'run', 'Hope', 'someday']",N/A

Now that I've entered my forties, I think I've become part of that generation (!), which is why it's so enjoyable to discover DVD's like this.  My only remembrance (vague, at best) of Andy on television were his annual Christmas specials.  This compilation of sequences from his 1960's television series is wonderful and could have been much longer.  There needs to be a cable channel, similar to TV Land, that should broadcast these shows in their entirety.  All of the performances are entertaining in an era when talent and warmth were on televised display.  It's always great to see the early Osmond Brothers, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and others from that era.  The quality of the color telecasts are great; this DVD is a perfect companion to Andy's ""Best of..."" Christmas DVD.

561130,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00004Z4V0,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 10]",This is an excellent DVD that hightlights Andy's pick of what he felt were some of his best moments during his TV show broadcast from 1962 to 1971. This is excellent viewing material and just plain fun for both those who are starting to get to be familiar with Andy Williams' work as well as those taking a stroll down memory lane. The quality of the picture and sound is excellent and the guests are very talented people. My only disappointment was that maybe Andy could have added other moments from other seasons of his shows--the majority of the clips are from the years 1965 to 1967. I vote this as a BUY; and I would have given it five stars were there more moments from other seasons added. Maybe this calls for a volume two?
