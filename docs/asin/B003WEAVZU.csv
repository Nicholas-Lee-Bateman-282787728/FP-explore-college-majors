1369041,A1R1MCAWY0KM4V,B003WEAVZU,"Bruce Brocka ""Prof Wombat""","[7, 7]","Very similar in tempo and feel to the ""Six Wives of Henry VIII"" and ""Elizabeth R"", as it is written by some of the same authors. I had never heard of this production until it was released on DVD, and immediately purchased it, being more or less obssesed with the other two mini-series since I saw them when they first aired on PBS. I wasn't disappointed. It features many actors in common with the other two - Simier, Babington and Philip II from Elizabth R, for instance. It lacks the bravura of Henry VIII and Elizabeth, but frankly, the tenor of the series suits the history of the man.The story of Henry VII is more complex and less flamboyent than Elizabeth or Henry VIII, or even Bloody Mary, yet he was a sucessful usurper and a fascinating study in kingship. Obviously, since it has only now being released, it is not quite as satisfying as the others, but certainloy will appeal to those lovers of British history and serious fans of the other series. The sheer number of important sub-players can overwhelm, and this series is 13 episdodes, twice as long as the others. Fortunately, the english subtitles can help in keeping track of the overwhleming number of characters, especially in the first 3 or four episodes.In short, I bought this sight unseen and was not disappointed.",4,The Forgotten Tudor,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,1288,"['Very', 'similar', 'tempo', 'feel', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Elizabeth', 'R', 'written', 'same', 'authors', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'production', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'being', 'more', 'less', 'obssesed', 'other', 'two', 'mini-series', 'saw', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'PBS', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'many', 'actors', 'common', 'other', 'two', 'Simier', 'Babington', 'Philip', 'II', 'Elizabth', 'R', 'instance', 'bravura', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Elizabeth', 'frankly', 'tenor', 'series', 'suits', 'history', 'man.The', 'story', 'Henry', 'VII', 'more', 'complex', 'less', 'flamboyent', 'Elizabeth', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'even', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'yet', 'was', 'sucessful', 'usurper', 'fascinating', 'study', 'kingship', 'Obviously', 'only', 'now', 'being', 'released', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'satisfying', 'others', 'certainloy', 'will', 'appeal', 'lovers', 'British', 'history', 'serious', 'fans', 'other', 'series', 'sheer', 'number', 'important', 'sub-players', 'can', 'overwhelm', 'series', '13', 'episdodes', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'others', 'Fortunately', 'english', 'subtitles', 'can', 'help', 'keeping', 'track', 'overwhleming', 'number', 'characters', 'especially', 'first', '3', 'four', 'episodes.In', 'short', 'bought', 'sight', 'unseen', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed']",N/A

The scripts are excellent, and Henry emerges as a man with a genius politician's grasp of situations and the players involved, but also as one who can debate with both high and low characters, using his quick mind to convince many (who would otherwise be his enemies) to turn so that the civil unrest that could be avoided--nation-changing struggles that could otherwise have overwhelmed the nation.",5,Terrific Prequel,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,542,"['James', 'Maxwell', 'superb', 'Richmond', 'Henry', 'VII', 'first-class', 'prequel', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'famed', 'series', 'Elizabeth', 'R.', 'scripts', 'are', 'excellent', 'Henry', 'man', 'genius', 'politician', 'grasp', 'situations', 'players', 'involved', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'debate', 'high', 'low', 'characters', 'using', 'quick', 'mind', 'convince', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'enemies', 'turn', 'so', 'civil', 'unrest', 'could', 'be', 'avoided', 'nation-changing', 'struggles', 'could', 'otherwise', 'have', 'overwhelmed', 'nation']",N/A
1369045,A2520U7DNPYGPX,B003WEAVZU,H. V. Stoughton-ter beek,"[2, 2]","I remember watching this with my parents on pbs years ago. I was so young, I had a crush on that 'older cute boy' who plays Lambert Simnel.Well, no one cares about that. But this series is, I think, better then the later 6 wives, even Elizabeth R, productions. Its subject is not as glamorous or romantic or--crazy. It is really well scripted and acted. James Maxwell as Henry VII is perfect, entirely believable. Elizabeth of York, Jasper Tudor, Margaret Beaufort-- a wonderful cast, easy to watch. Expect production values to be old-fashioned, and the focus on conversation and character.The world just doesn't have much to say about Henry VII, compared to other monarchs. Just the usual old skinflint taxing miser knighting people who give him cash with rusty old swords behind the arras. So it is so good and a real treat to see a realistic portrait, based on sound history, of what he may have been like. His early idealism. His piety. His intelligence and some good governing, flawed by never feeling really secure, with an alternate Royal family still hanging about, uprisings and pretenders to the throne and foreign interference. This insecurity, which I think he never expected, thinking early on that a real king need fear no subject, and would be loved. Its a very convincing story, and the good amount of episodes allow you to see all sorts of side bits and facets of his character and reign. As a father-- very good with his children, good to Arthur. His wife, who comes to understand and love him.If you didn't know, his mother had him when she had just turned 13, so she's still quite young. never had another child. Outlived him, 'the Tudor', as she called him (that is unnecessary/extraneous, sorry. But it just fascinates me).Anyone who reads Alison Weir, David Starkey, even Phillipa Gregory etc., should watch this, and enjoy some alternative ideas and dramatic enactments of history known. Its a perfect companion to 6 Wives and ElizabethR ( both also very good ).

Although yes you can tell it was made in the early 1970s (there's just something about it, LOL) and naturally it lacks the technical brilliance of some other BBC productions, I became thoroughly engrossed in it by the end of the first episode. At first I borrowed it from my local library system but after seeing only episode #1 I decided I wanted a copy for my permanent video library and after receiving my copy from Amazon I liked it better and better the more I watched.James Maxwell is absolutely spot-on as Henry VII, a historical figure that most people remember (if at all!) only as being ""miserly"" and ""the father of Henry VIII"". Although I knew quite a bit about Henry simply from being a student of the Tudor era, this portrayal literally brought the character alive and gave him a personal dimension that is entirely missing from any printed word biography.And it must be noted that Episode #7 (""A Fly in the Ointment"") is an absolute HOOT!

Norma West as Elizabeth of York is also very good and I wish she had been featured in more of the episodes. The actors playing the central characters as well as supporting parts were all perfectly cast. The writing and the atmosphere seem authentically medieval. This series covers a particularly interesting period in British history; the beginning of the Tudor dynasty following the War of the Roses, when the House of York and the House of Lancashire unite through the marriage of Henry Tudor and Elizabeth of York. The only real complaint I have is that too many of the episodes focused on prisoners being tried and executed. Although these stories are very relevant since most of them involved threats to Henry's reign, I felt there should be a little more variety.

The story directly follows up the aftermath of his victory over Richard III. At the start, it deals with the complicated politics involved in settling the various civil wars in England and the process of Henry establishing himself as King. The series is very long (13 episodes) and about half of the episodes are really vignettes covering various political, religious and other issues from the era often not necessarly to do directly with the life of the King.The series starts out strong focused on the king's narrative. Then stops and goes in many different directions, then comes back to finish the story of the king.The sets and backgrounds are not what would be expected in modern television. It would be best to think of this as done more in the manner of a stage play than a modern elaborate television drama. But for those who can put that aside, its very rich drama. Particularly in the early episodes.James Maxwell gives a outstanding performance as the king. He comes across as a very careful and well intentioned man dealing with an unstable and dangerous situation. Not wanting to be a tyrant, but often having no other choice than to be one on many occasions. There is also Elizabeth of York (his queen) played very well (though in few of the episodes) by Norma West.I liked it in part because I like shakespeare's histories and this is somewhat of a continuation of those histories in a different form.

Often they are in poor shape too, but this one just sparkles.  The budget like all period dramas of the time was spent heavily on costumes and such. The sets look very realistic as well. The story is well done and one of the shrewdist kings in english history is brought to life here in a excellent retelling of his kingship. The man was a great king and there's not a doubt about it. He was not generally  vengeful and he was able to win battles without even raising a sword in one case. The story moves fast as the king holds on to power and must navigate the end of the middle ages and the birth of the modern world in the uk. He was wise enough to end the right of lords to raise private armies and to centralize government in a way that still allowed his lords to govern well and yet be subservient to him. In other words this is a king who made a difference and of course he is the father of henry the 8th as well.  The excellent late James maxwell really brings the king to life in this drama.The rest of the cast is no less enabled ss well. The kings reign was largely peaceful except for rebellions brought on by pretenders which lead to several bloody battles , which are ocvered here, although you don't see the king fighting on the field of battle he in fact did so, still  so the story revolves around his life and court and the intrigues of those who wish to bring him down, more directly than some other stories.  I was surprised at how beautifully preserved this show was though. Thankfully as it is a fine drama series based on reality.  Don't expect sweeping senery though as the budget was spent on sets and not crowd scenes.  The tower is where some of the action takes place as well which is why the name for this show is correct. By this time westminster was long the palace of choice but the tower was still used for more than a prison even during this period.  If  you like historical dramas based on history then this one is for you. AND it includes the 1969 pilot episode (black and white in that case)  that was part of the'drama playhouse' series.  That series introduced 9 shows and six became series; although the tower episode was intended to be part of a show about different stories in the tower; it lead to instead the Henry the 7th story and it has James Maxwell in it as well playing Henry 7th.  It also has a welsh show about Henry Tudor which was a 1980's documentary show.

If you are looking for fantastical cinemetography and special effects in this series you are not going to find it. But you know what? Even when you do find it these days it's all fake anyways; nothing but special effects and ""cloned"" armies anyway.What I have always admired in British film and BBC in particular is their tremendous ability and skills with character development and dialogue and thought provoking conversations between characters. If this is also your ""cup of tea"" then you will love this production.James Maxwell's interpretation of Henry VII jumps right out of the screen and makes him a real and vibrant person rather than a page out of an old musty history book. One really grows to like him and appreciate what a great survivor he was, facing very difficult situations and against all odds. Even when it does become neccessary for him to have some individuals executed, he doesn't just shout: ""Off with their heads"", but instead sits down with them and explains to them the enormity of their crimes and the numbers of innocent lives lost due to their betrayal and treachery and hence the neccessity of their deaths. Even though he cannot commute their sentences, he is concerned about their souls.There is great dialogue and interplay between even lesser personages in the series raising many issues and questions relating to religion, ethics, politics, betrayal and the questionable interplay between church and state and the dire consequences visited upon poor peasants and vassals caught between the two. This is a very little known period of English history ultimately leading up to the Reformation and the dreadful religous wars to follow. It is interesting to see how easily the peasants were victimized and led to and fro by unscrupulous pretenders and traitorous lords, both spiritual and temporal, without ever requiring any proof for their claims; not unlike today's political climate.This series is very reminiscent of the older ""An Age of Kings"" series produced back in the 1960's, only of course this series is in color and with a clearer picture. And even though there may not be a vast array of settings and special effects, the costumes and settings are very accurate and very well done as is the occasional music and dancing.One has to admire Henry VII as a refined, educated and brilliant monarch who knew how to play his cards. Basically he gave others enough rope and allowed them to hang themselves. Henry is absolutely brilliant. In a Presidential debate, he would win hands down. And the really nice part is that he seems genuinely concerned about the fate of his subjects and not just the fate of his dynasty. One also sees in the production the utter decadence and corruption within the Church of Rome which ultimately lead to the Reformation and much later ""The Age of Reason"".",5,Long Live The King,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,2963,"['originally', 'had', 'reservations', 'buying', 'series', 'based', 'reviews', 'am', 'now', 'so', 'happy', 'took', 'chance', 'are', 'looking', 'fantastical', 'cinemetography', 'special', 'effects', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'know', 'what', 'Even', 'when', 'do', 'find', 'days', 'fake', 'anyways', 'nothing', 'special', 'effects', 'cloned', 'armies', 'have', 'always', 'admired', 'British', 'film', 'BBC', 'particular', 'tremendous', 'ability', 'skills', 'character', 'development', 'dialogue', 'thought', 'provoking', 'conversations', 'characters', 'also', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'Maxwell', 'interpretation', 'Henry', 'VII', 'jumps', 'right', 'screen', 'real', 'vibrant', 'person', 'rather', 'page', 'old', 'musty', 'history', 'book', 'One', 'really', 'like', 'appreciate', 'what', 'great', 'survivor', 'was', 'facing', 'very', 'difficult', 'situations', 'odds', 'Even', 'when', 'become', 'neccessary', 'have', 'individuals', 'executed', ""n't"", 'just', 'shout', 'heads', 'instead', 'down', 'enormity', 'crimes', 'numbers', 'innocent', 'lives', 'lost', 'due', 'betrayal', 'treachery', 'hence', 'neccessity', 'deaths', 'Even', 'can', 'not', 'commute', 'sentences', 'concerned', 'souls.There', 'great', 'dialogue', 'interplay', 'even', 'lesser', 'personages', 'series', 'raising', 'many', 'issues', 'questions', 'relating', 'religion', 'ethics', 'politics', 'betrayal', 'questionable', 'interplay', 'church', 'state', 'dire', 'consequences', 'visited', 'poor', 'peasants', 'vassals', 'caught', 'two', 'very', 'little', 'known', 'period', 'English', 'history', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'up', 'Reformation', 'dreadful', 'religous', 'wars', 'follow', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'peasants', 'were', 'victimized', 'led', 'fro', 'unscrupulous', 'pretenders', 'traitorous', 'lords', 'spiritual', 'temporal', 'ever', 'requiring', 'proof', 'claims', 'not', 'today', 'political', 'climate.This', 'series', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'older', 'Age', 'Kings', 'series', 'produced', 'back', '1960', 'only', 'course', 'series', 'color', 'clearer', 'picture', 'even', 'there', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'vast', 'array', 'settings', 'special', 'effects', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'occasional', 'music', 'dancing.One', 'admire', 'Henry', 'VII', 'refined', 'educated', 'brilliant', 'monarch', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'play', 'cards', 'Basically', 'gave', 'others', 'enough', 'rope', 'allowed', 'hang', 'Henry', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Presidential', 'debate', 'would', 'win', 'hands', 'down', 'really', 'nice', 'part', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'fate', 'subjects', 'not', 'just', 'fate', 'dynasty', 'One', 'also', 'production', 'utter', 'decadence', 'corruption', 'Church', 'Rome', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'Reformation', 'much', 'later', 'Age', 'Reason']",N/A
