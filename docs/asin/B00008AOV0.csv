737363,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00008AOV0,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Murder By Television, 1935 filmThe film begins with articles on building a television receiver for ""ultra short wave"". A corporation must fight to hold its position against the competition. An ""employee at large"" is paid to get results. [Industrial espionage?] Television has tremendous importance for the future. ""Clever these Chinese."" Will television benefit humanity? [It depends on its use.] Mr. Mendoza represents a very powerful group, they do not want the tests to go forward. TV signals are transmitted from White Plains NY. They show Paris and London, then China. [Using low bandwidth telephone lines or short wave radio?] Then Mr. Houghland yells and falls; he is dead! Did someone sneak in or out of the house? Where is the critical tube from the television sender? Somebody broke into the safe in a bedroom and stole the secret papers.One scientist has a machine that tests a person's brain for faults. One man asks if Houghland was murdered, he has a clue. But Perry is also found dead. There are strange things in the dark night. Did they see a ghost? We meet a Federal Investigator. Can a telephone call cause a death? Yes, it's a ""death ray""! Foreign governments want this invention. The guilty man made a mistake and is identified. ""The eyes can see but the mind won't believe.""Most people are unaware of the pre-war history of television in the 1930s. This is low-budget film that shows what Bela Lugosi did in movies after ""Dracula"". He was a very good actor who was handicapped by his accent except when he played a foreigner (""Ninotchka"").

737365,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00008AOV0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","In the early days of cinema, it seems like every third movie involved a murder, after which the authorities would not allow anyone to leave the house before the mystery was solved.  Murder By Television is a rather poor representative of that type of movie.  I like my plots to make sense, and this movie kept me rather confused from the very start.  Worse, the final solution to the crime seems to me as if it was just made up out of thin air.  The murder victim in this case is a television pioneer whose plans for a technological breakthrough are in high demand.  As he is broadcasting his message to the few people lucky enough to actually have a TV, he suddenly collapses.  There are several suspects, as one or two of the guests seem to be doing something akin to spying for a rival television company or two.  The inventor's assistant, played by Bela Lugosi, is another prime suspect.  There's another guy who keeps snooping around outside and sneaking in the house, but for some reason I don't understand the cops just keep throwing the guy out the door without asking him any questions.  The ultimate solution to the crime partly relies upon one of the oldest tricks in the book, a plot device that was surely old and tired as early as 1935.  Bela Lugosi is about the only thing this movie has going for it, but his character is by no means interesting.  Almost everyone just seemed to be going through the motions on this one, and the result is a flat, forgettable film.  The one exception is Hattie McDaniel, whom I was surprised but delighted to find in this pre-Gone With the Wind motion picture.  Of course, her character is just one big stereotype, which makes her performance much less enjoyable than it would be otherwise.",2,"An exceedingly dull, disappointing whodunit",1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,1739,"['early', 'days', 'cinema', 'third', 'movie', 'involved', 'murder', 'authorities', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'anyone', 'leave', 'house', 'mystery', 'was', 'solved', 'Murder', 'Television', 'rather', 'poor', 'representative', 'type', 'movie', 'plots', 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'kept', 'rather', 'confused', 'very', 'start', 'Worse', 'final', 'solution', 'crime', 'was', 'just', 'made', 'up', 'thin', 'air', 'murder', 'victim', 'case', 'television', 'pioneer', 'plans', 'technological', 'breakthrough', 'are', 'high', 'demand', 'broadcasting', 'message', 'few', 'people', 'lucky', 'enough', 'actually', 'have', 'TV', 'suddenly', 'are', 'several', 'suspects', 'one', 'two', 'guests', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'akin', 'spying', 'rival', 'television', 'company', 'two', 'inventor', 'assistant', 'played', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'prime', 'suspect', 'guy', 'who', 'snooping', 'outside', 'sneaking', 'house', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'cops', 'just', 'keep', 'throwing', 'guy', 'door', 'asking', 'questions', 'ultimate', 'solution', 'crime', 'partly', 'one', 'oldest', 'tricks', 'book', 'plot', 'device', 'was', 'surely', 'old', 'tired', 'as', 'early', '1935', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'character', 'means', 'interesting', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'one', 'result', 'flat', 'forgettable', 'film', 'one', 'exception', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'whom', 'was', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'find', 'pre-Gone', 'Wind', 'motion', 'picture', 'course', 'character', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'stereotype', 'performance', 'much', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'be', 'otherwise']",Murder by Television
