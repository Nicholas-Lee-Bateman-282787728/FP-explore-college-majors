707039,ABE14SVILZLNY,B000069DOB,,"[0, 2]","Right before the opening credits hit in ""All About The Benjamins,"" there is a moment where star/writer/producer Ice Cube takes a tazer to a man's genitals. It's rather appropriate, because if you're not a fan of Mr. Cube's, ""Benjamins"" will feel about as comfortable to sit through as that tazer's sting.""Benjamins"" stars Ice Cube as bounty hunter Bucum Jackson, sent on assignment to recover a bail jumper named Reggie Wright (Mike Epps). Reggie is in deep trouble. Not only did he witness a diamond theft and murder, but he also left his wallet - containing a winning lottery ticket - at the scene of the crime. Reggie's only help is Bucum, but the grumpy bounty hunter wants nothing to do with the felon, that is until 20 million in stolen diamonds becomes up for grabs.I'll give him this much: Ice Cube certainly knows his audience. ""All About The Benjamins"" is as familiar Cube terrain as a movie can get, filled to the breaking point with the fireballs, profanity and ad-libbed laughs that made his previous two ""Friday"" films such hits. However, this time out, Cube and his team are trying to resuscitate the buddy film genre, long since laid to rest in the land of straight-to-video releases. ""Benjamins"" is an old-school, Joel Silveresque actioner, circa 1991. It delightfully traffics in the business of over-the-top villains, gorgeous females, constant shoot-outs and one explosion after another. Long gone are the weed and sex jokes of the ""Friday"" films, here replaced with bullets and a bigger budget.Somehow, first time director Kevin Bray makes this work, if only slightly. A highly energized, stylishly directed film that actually features a perfect mood setting opening credit sequence, ""Benjamins"" can at least serve as eye candy if nothing else. The editing has no pulse, and the photography isn't all that interesting, but ""Benjamins"" at least moves. It's an action film without a brain, but the two charismatic stars to help it along, often tricking the viewer into enjoying this mess a lot more then should be allowed.What the people really have come to see is the reteaming of Cube and Epps. Fresh from their inspired work in ""Next Friday,"" the duo returns here in ""Benjamins"" with the same easy back and forth comic touch. Think of them as the urban Hope and Crosby. While Ice Cube is his typical stoic self, Epps takes the comedy baton and runs like hell with it. Epps is hilarious in ""Benjamins,"" making even the most painful aspects of the production seem like cherry pie with his alert comic timing and his gift for improvisation. This gift is so beloved by the filmmakers that they keep letting the camera roll on Epps as he does his free-flowing thing with the screenplay. Normally, a very destructive method to wring a laugh. But with Epps, it works.Cube and Epps make an impressive comic team, and they make the shamelessly hackneyed ""Benjamins"" a worthwhile sit for fans of the duo. Everyone else, save your benjamins and stay far away. ---------- 7/10",4,The gloriously funny Epps and Cube make this junk tolerable,1033084800,"09 27, 2002",2002,2986,"['Right', 'opening', 'credits', 'hit', 'Benjamins', 'moment', 'where', 'star/writer/producer', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'tazer', 'man', 'genitals', 'rather', 'appropriate', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Mr.', 'Cube', 'Benjamins', 'will', 'feel', 'about', 'comfortable', 'sit', 'tazer', 'sting', 'Benjamins', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Bucum', 'Jackson', 'sent', 'assignment', 'recover', 'bail', 'jumper', 'named', 'Reggie', 'Wright', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'Reggie', 'deep', 'trouble', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'witness', 'diamond', 'theft', 'murder', 'also', 'left', 'wallet', 'containing', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'scene', 'crime', 'Reggie', 'only', 'help', 'Bucum', 'grumpy', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'nothing', 'do', 'felon', '20', 'million', 'stolen', 'diamonds', 'up', 'grabs.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'much', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'certainly', 'audience', 'Benjamins', 'familiar', 'Cube', 'terrain', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'filled', 'breaking', 'point', 'fireballs', 'profanity', 'ad-libbed', 'laughs', 'made', 'previous', 'two', 'Friday', 'films', 'such', 'hits', 'However', 'time', 'out', 'Cube', 'team', 'are', 'trying', 'resuscitate', 'buddy', 'film', 'genre', 'long', 'laid', 'rest', 'land', 'straight-to-video', 'releases', 'Benjamins', 'old-school', 'Joel', 'Silveresque', 'actioner', 'circa', '1991', 'delightfully', 'traffics', 'business', 'over-the-top', 'villains', 'gorgeous', 'females', 'constant', 'shoot-outs', 'one', 'explosion', 'Long', 'gone', 'are', 'weed', 'sex', 'jokes', 'Friday', 'films', 'here', 'replaced', 'bullets', 'bigger', 'budget.Somehow', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Bray', 'work', 'only', 'slightly', 'highly', 'energized', 'stylishly', 'directed', 'film', 'actually', 'perfect', 'mood', 'setting', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'Benjamins', 'can', 'least', 'serve', 'eye', 'candy', 'nothing', 'else', 'editing', 'pulse', 'photography', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'Benjamins', 'least', 'moves', 'action', 'film', 'brain', 'two', 'charismatic', 'stars', 'help', 'along', 'often', 'tricking', 'viewer', 'enjoying', 'mess', 'lot', 'more', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'people', 'really', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'reteaming', 'Cube', 'Epps', 'Fresh', 'inspired', 'work', 'Next', 'Friday', 'duo', 'returns', 'here', 'Benjamins', 'same', 'easy', 'back', 'forth', 'comic', 'touch', 'Think', 'urban', 'Hope', 'Crosby', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'typical', 'stoic', 'self', 'Epps', 'comedy', 'baton', 'runs', 'hell', 'Epps', 'hilarious', 'Benjamins', 'making', 'even', 'most', 'painful', 'aspects', 'production', 'seem', 'cherry', 'pie', 'alert', 'comic', 'timing', 'gift', 'improvisation', 'gift', 'so', 'beloved', 'filmmakers', 'keep', 'letting', 'camera', 'roll', 'Epps', 'free-flowing', 'thing', 'screenplay', 'Normally', 'very', 'destructive', 'method', 'wring', 'laugh', 'Epps', 'works.Cube', 'Epps', 'make', 'impressive', 'comic', 'team', 'make', 'shamelessly', 'hackneyed', 'Benjamins', 'worthwhile', 'sit', 'fans', 'duo', 'Everyone', 'else', 'save', 'benjamins', 'stay', 'far', 'away', '7/10']",N/A

When the con man wins the mega lottery and then loses his ticket (in the boat of a nasty villian) he tries to enlist the aid of Ice T to get it back.  Unfortunately for him, Ice T does not believe him about the ticket and is not only interested in collecting the bounty for the con man and also recovering several million in diamonds that a bad guy has.Eventually, Ice T starts to believe the con man and they somewhat work together but Ice T maintains a short leash on him until he can beat the villian and get the diamonds.There are some really hilarious scenes and both Ice T and the con man put in excellent performances.An overlooked gem that is as good as any of the Lethal Weapon films!",4,Entertaining!,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,788,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Ice', 'T', 'who', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'eluding', 'When', 'con', 'man', 'mega', 'lottery', 'then', 'ticket', 'boat', 'nasty', 'villian', 'enlist', 'aid', 'Ice', 'T', 'get', 'back', 'Unfortunately', 'Ice', 'T', 'not', 'believe', 'ticket', 'not', 'only', 'interested', 'collecting', 'bounty', 'con', 'man', 'also', 'recovering', 'several', 'million', 'diamonds', 'bad', 'guy', 'has.Eventually', 'Ice', 'T', 'believe', 'con', 'man', 'somewhat', 'work', 'together', 'Ice', 'T', 'short', 'leash', 'can', 'beat', 'villian', 'get', 'diamonds.There', 'are', 'really', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'Ice', 'T', 'con', 'man', 'put', 'excellent', 'performances.An', 'overlooked', 'gem', 'as', 'good', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'films']",N/A

Every scene they shared had a little something different to make us laugh. It's not like most buddy comedies where they take one funny idea and play it out making the film boring. These two will having you laughing from beginning to end!And speaking of the beginning of the film, we get a great performance from my favorite actor, Anthony Michael Hall. Now I can honestly say I've seen AMH do it all. We finally get to see AMH play a trashy trailer park thuggin' blackish red hair sportin' ex-con with a flare for using the current slang like ""cheese"". "" You don't get no real cheese anyway..""""

Benjamin comes from Benjamin Franklin, whose face is on a $100 bill. The opening scene is Ice Cube, as a bounty hunter (Bukum, pronounced Book-em), going into a red neck trailer park to capture his bounty. The yahoo has the proverbial Confederate flag hanging from his wall and is watching old slightly racist Loony Tunes. As it turns out this is an NRA trailer park and Ice Cube is shot at by the yahoo's girlfriend (foot is in a cast) as well as some old lady next door. As he collects his bounty we discover he is not in full employment, but semi-freelances. The secretary at the bail bond's place wants to be Ice Cube's partner, although he would rather go alone. His next gig is to bring in Mike Epps, a petty con man. During the chase Epps and Bukum end up at a murder scene over some diamonds. Now to make this more interesting it seems Epps has a winning lottery ticket worth $60 million, but through a series of events it ends up in the hands of the murderers. Ice Cube is leery about Epps' story and uses him to go after the murderers.The movie is funny and keeps moving. The character of Epps as a talkative, cowardly, pretending to be brave con artist compliments the series role of Ice Cube. The movie drops the MF bomb and frequent use of the ""N"" word. Gansta rap as a background is used 3 times as far as I could tell: opening credits, ending credits, and the climax scene.",4,BOOK-EM,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,1444,"['First', 'off', 'one', 'movie', 'named', 'Benjamin', 'Benjamin', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'face', '100', 'bill', 'opening', 'scene', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Bukum', 'pronounced', 'Book-em', 'going', 'red', 'neck', 'trailer', 'park', 'capture', 'bounty', 'yahoo', 'proverbial', 'Confederate', 'flag', 'hanging', 'wall', 'watching', 'old', 'slightly', 'racist', 'Loony', 'Tunes', 'out', 'NRA', 'trailer', 'park', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'shot', 'yahoo', 'girlfriend', 'foot', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'lady', 'next', 'door', 'bounty', 'discover', 'not', 'full', 'employment', 'semi-freelances', 'secretary', 'bail', 'bond', 'place', 'be', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'partner', 'would', 'rather', 'go', 'alone', 'next', 'gig', 'bring', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'petty', 'con', 'man', 'chase', 'Epps', 'Bukum', 'end', 'up', 'murder', 'scene', 'diamonds', 'Now', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'Epps', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', '60', 'million', 'series', 'events', 'up', 'hands', 'murderers', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'leery', 'Epps', 'story', 'go', 'murderers.The', 'movie', 'funny', 'moving', 'character', 'Epps', 'talkative', 'cowardly', 'pretending', 'be', 'brave', 'con', 'artist', 'compliments', 'series', 'role', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'movie', 'MF', 'bomb', 'frequent', 'use', 'N', 'word', 'Gansta', 'rap', 'background', 'used', '3', 'times', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'opening', 'credits', 'ending', 'credits', 'climax', 'scene']",N/A
