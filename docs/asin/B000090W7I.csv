She is not hearing impaired but we thought it beneficial to teach her sign language as a second language to help her communictae with us before she could talk. She loved the videos and even asked to watch them. She did her first sign at 10 months and asked for 'Milk"". Now she is 2 years old an still mesmerized by the videos adn loves watching them. She now knows all the signs from the first three videos and signs them often. She is also talking a lot now and signing has in no way impaired her speech or slowed it down.These videos are pleaseing to the eye both for children adn grown ups. Many children sign the signs adn it is also repeeated verbally to help your hearing child to pick up the words. they are bright colourful adn the songs are beautiful adn very catchy.I would recommend these videos to anyone interested in teaching sign to their children.[...]",5,Awesome must see,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1001,"['Cehck', 'out', '[', ']', 'more', 'info.My', 'child', 'started', 'watching', 'fantastic', 'videos', '8', 'months', 'old', 'could', 'teach', 'sign', 'language', 'not', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'thought', 'beneficial', 'teach', 'sign', 'language', 'second', 'language', 'help', 'communictae', 'could', 'talk', 'loved', 'videos', 'even', 'asked', 'watch', 'did', 'first', 'sign', '10', 'months', 'asked', ""'Milk"", 'Now', '2', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'mesmerized', 'videos', 'adn', 'loves', 'watching', 'now', 'signs', 'first', 'three', 'videos', 'signs', 'often', 'also', 'talking', 'lot', 'now', 'signing', 'way', 'impaired', 'speech', 'slowed', 'down.These', 'videos', 'are', 'pleaseing', 'eye', 'children', 'adn', 'grown', 'ups', 'Many', 'children', 'sign', 'signs', 'also', 'repeeated', 'verbally', 'help', 'hearing', 'child', 'pick', 'up', 'words', 'are', 'bright', 'colourful', 'songs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'adn', 'very', 'catchy.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'videos', 'anyone', 'interested', 'teaching', 'sign', 'children.', '[', ']']",N/A

751107,AS28WVBBZ3G99,B000090W7I,Jeffrey E Ellis,"[4, 4]","This series is a wonderful, door-opening experience for children. Signing Times is easy-to-learn, fun, and real. The educational experience alone is worth the cost let alone the communication doors it opens with parents, grendparents, or other interested, engaged adults.The topic word is shown on the screen, spoken, signed by an adult and also by other children. Often the word is then used in a sentence or a song. This reinforces the word itself, its meaning and its sign. Repetition is the key without being boring or obnoxious. Signing Times does a great job with both.This volume was important becuase it introduced me: ""Grampa"". The sign for ""Grampa"" looks a little like a moose antler but it still melts my heart when our two-year-old grandaughter signs it.This is another solid installment in a remarkable series.

751108,A3GQWBQLT4I2X2,B000090W7I,Jennifer O'Daniel,"[1, 1]","We discovered Signing Time while researching ASL (American Sign Language) as a 2nd language for our children. We knew we wanted to teach ASL as a 2nd language because of the many benefits such as earlier communication. You can communicate with your baby as young as 8 months old, maybe even younger. What a gift to know what your child needs before they can tell you with spoken words! For more information on the benefits of ASL check out the Signing Time website at [...]We love this volume of Signing Time. The songs are wonderful and work very well in a school setting as well as at home. The songs are very catchy so you will find they get stuck in your head. Alex and Leah do a great job. We love to see the 2 friends/cousins interacting together. In this volume we learn signs for important words like friend, play, please and thank you. I use the manners song in my classroom and the kids love it.We like that the written word comes on the screen first and then they show the sign. It is very helpful for practicing the signs. It is like a video flashcard. It also helps children develop reading skills because they start to recognize the written word that goes with the sign. We love watching the children do the signs because you see lots of different kids and lots of different skill levels. It gives you an idea of how your child might make the sign at different ages. Rachel also does the sign so you can clearly see the proper way to do it.The song during the credits is a great way to learn additional signs that were not covered in the show. You can really add to your signing vocabulary if you pay attention.I highly recommend this volume of signing time as well as the other 5 in the series. As a mother and a teacher I can say it is truly the best educational tool I have found for teaching ASL to children (and adults too). I hope they make many more and I will buy them all without hesitation.
