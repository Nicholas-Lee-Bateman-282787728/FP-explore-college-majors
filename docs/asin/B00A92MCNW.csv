1606938,A2EW64WI4R74Z8,B00A92MCNW,RestlessBoomer,"[16, 16]","I've been waiting for this mini-series to come out on DVD for years.  The story of John C. Fremont is well told and chronicles his explorations and mapping of the American West.  Alice Krige does a wonderful job of portraying Fremont's strong-willed wife and the cast is stellar.  The picture quality is very good considering this was televised almost 30 years ago.  I never could figure out why it hasn't been shown again and why it took so darned long to come out in DVD format.  Even though this is no ""Centennial"" or ""The Thorn Birds"", Richard Chamberlain does a very good job as Fremont in this lesser known miniseries.  Well worth purchasing--however, you might want to shop around for a better price.  I got mine through WB Archives at a more reasonable price than I see listed here.",5,It's about time!,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,790,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'mini-series', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'years', 'story', 'John', 'C.', 'Fremont', 'well', 'told', 'explorations', 'mapping', 'American', 'West', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'Fremont', 'strong-willed', 'wife', 'cast', 'stellar', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'considering', 'was', 'televised', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'why', ""n't"", 'been', 'shown', 'again', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'darned', 'long', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'format', 'Even', 'Centennial', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Fremont', 'lesser', 'known', 'miniseries', 'Well', 'purchasing', 'however', 'might', 'want', 'shop', 'around', 'better', 'price', 'got', 'WB', 'Archives', 'more', 'reasonable', 'price', 'see', 'listed', 'here']",Dream West
