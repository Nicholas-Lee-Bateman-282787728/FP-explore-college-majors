If, like me, you have been following this subject for a long time, you will not see much new here. Disinformation specialist Richard Doty is highlighted. He has zero credibility in the field due to his work, yet is given a good deal of screen time. I suppose if you want a primer on how disinformation can be effective, then this might hold some interest for you. Does not answer any questions about UFOs, but does show how government disinformation specialists have muddied the field.",3,Nothing new here,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,572,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'DVD', 'are', 'new', 'subject', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'subject', 'long', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'Disinformation', 'specialist', 'Richard', 'Doty', 'highlighted', 'zero', 'credibility', 'field', 'due', 'work', 'given', 'good', 'deal', 'screen', 'time', 'suppose', 'want', 'primer', 'how', 'disinformation', 'can', 'be', 'effective', 'then', 'might', 'hold', 'interest', 'not', 'answer', 'questions', 'UFOs', 'show', 'how', 'government', 'disinformation', 'specialists', 'have', 'muddied', 'field']",Mirage Men

That you can't trust anyone that hands you something for free and that ""believers"" of any kind will go to any length to prove their ego right, even if it means lying to themselves and everyone else.This film is more of an interesting case study in human psychology than it is aliens. I heard ""In every lie there's a grain of truth"" over and over. That to me is so amazingly funny, it boarders on sad. In every lie there's nothing but lies. There's no rule that says you have to tell some of the truth if you lie. It doesn't make the lie more believable at all. People who think there's some form of truth in every lie are trying hard to keep their egos from being bruised. They're basically saying, ""Yes, I know I'm being fooled and being made to look stupid, but I'm sure that part of this is true because I have to believe it is.""  Seriously, if people believe the government in the 1940's allowed humans to go to an alien planet with a mess of aliens and come back with samples, you deserve to look stupid. What's more believable? That an alien race, billions of light years away came to this backwater, no where blue rock, interacted with a comparatively mentally retarded species and then take the time to help cover it all up.. for no reason at all. Or that some bored guy who can't let go of his job lying to people and making them look stupid copied the plot from a movie and sent it to ""believers?"" What magical spell would Spielberg hold that would allow him to have such amazing information to make a movie about? Ohhh, that's right, it was the government telling a lie that had ""truth"" in it.Human beings are so egotistical that they will believe anything to seem special. It's shockingly amazing. I'd laugh if it weren't so darn pathetic. That wormy guy is a government trained master troll.

1695076,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00IXPQUCQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There are great documentaries and there are bad ones. The good ones take you on a path of discovery involving a topic you may know little about and hold your interest from start to finish. The bad ones have one of two problems. The first is that they take a subject no one cares about and do a bad job of gaining your interest. The second is when they take what could be a very interesting story and turn it into something so boring no one can stay till the final credits. MIRAGE MAN falls into this second category.The topic at hand is UFOs and aliens, something that many find of particular interest. It seems everyone can find someone they know who has seen something odd in the sky or who claims they have seen a UFO. This movie tries to explain where the whole hysteria of flying saucers stems from. According to this film it all came from one man, Rick Doty.Doty was an agent of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFSOI). When an electronics whiz and UFO researcher named Paul Bennewitz began looking into transmissions he was receiving word got back to the Air Force. What Bennewitz was actually receiving was transmissions from secret Air Force tests being conducted. But this was at the height of the cold war so they wanted him to steer clear of what he was hearing. Rather than threaten him they sent Doty who worked alongside Bennewitz and allowed him to believe that these actually were messages of alien origin.Passing along false information they carried out a charade that lasted decades and that almost all UFO information has stemmed from. Photos and leaked documents were all false and passed along to Bennewitz and others with the hope that it would lead people to think they were either crazy or perhaps on to something. Of course it was UFOs and not the secret projects being formed and tested in those deserts. What better way to camouflage what was really going on?The problem came when the tiny story began to expand and become bigger than they ever dreamed it would. The government went so far as to hire members of the groups searching for the truth about UFOs to help them. Many weren't even aware at the time just how involved they were. But here is where the problem with the movie comes in.To begin with the movie is done is such a straight forward way with nearly non-stop interviews with the most uninspiring and bland people that it nearly puts you to sleep. The other problem is how the stories unfold which becomes confounding to the viewer. There are items that Doty being interviewed says were stories concocted to be passed along but then he backtracks about later and says there was some truth to. By the time you're done listening to him you're not sure if there was UFO technology being used and backtracked or if it was all faked. Then again that was what his job was to do for all those years.In the end your own personal beliefs will not be shaken by this film nor will they be confirmed. Like the ever elusive Bigfoot and the long seen but never found UFO, it all depends on your belief. Until either of these is sighted I'll have to take the side of the skeptic. When you find either of them please let me know.",2,INTERESTING STORY TOLD IN UNINTERSTING FASHION,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,3171,"['are', 'great', 'documentaries', 'are', 'bad', 'ones', 'good', 'ones', 'take', 'path', 'discovery', 'involving', 'topic', 'may', 'know', 'little', 'hold', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'bad', 'ones', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'problems', 'first', 'take', 'subject', 'one', 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'gaining', 'interest', 'second', 'when', 'take', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'turn', 'something', 'so', 'boring', 'one', 'can', 'stay', 'till', 'final', 'credits', 'MIRAGE', 'MAN', 'second', 'category.The', 'topic', 'hand', 'UFOs', 'aliens', 'something', 'many', 'find', 'particular', 'interest', 'everyone', 'can', 'find', 'someone', 'know', 'who', 'seen', 'something', 'odd', 'sky', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'UFO', 'movie', 'explain', 'where', 'whole', 'hysteria', 'flying', 'saucers', 'According', 'film', 'came', 'one', 'man', 'Rick', 'Doty.Doty', 'was', 'agent', 'Air', 'Force', 'Office', 'Special', 'Investigations', 'AFSOI', 'When', 'electronics', 'whiz', 'UFO', 'researcher', 'named', 'Paul', 'Bennewitz', 'began', 'looking', 'transmissions', 'was', 'receiving', 'word', 'got', 'back', 'Air', 'Force', 'What', 'Bennewitz', 'was', 'actually', 'receiving', 'was', 'transmissions', 'secret', 'Air', 'Force', 'tests', 'being', 'conducted', 'was', 'height', 'cold', 'war', 'wanted', 'steer', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'hearing', 'Rather', 'threaten', 'sent', 'Doty', 'who', 'worked', 'alongside', 'Bennewitz', 'allowed', 'believe', 'actually', 'were', 'messages', 'alien', 'origin.Passing', 'along', 'false', 'information', 'carried', 'out', 'charade', 'lasted', 'decades', 'almost', 'UFO', 'information', 'stemmed', 'Photos', 'leaked', 'documents', 'were', 'false', 'passed', 'along', 'Bennewitz', 'others', 'hope', 'would', 'lead', 'people', 'think', 'were', 'crazy', 'perhaps', 'something', 'course', 'was', 'UFOs', 'not', 'secret', 'projects', 'being', 'formed', 'tested', 'deserts', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'camouflage', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'problem', 'came', 'when', 'tiny', 'story', 'began', 'expand', 'become', 'bigger', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'would', 'government', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'hire', 'members', 'groups', 'searching', 'truth', 'UFOs', 'help', 'Many', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'time', 'just', 'how', 'involved', 'were', 'here', 'where', 'problem', 'movie', 'in.To', 'begin', 'movie', 'done', 'such', 'straight', 'forward', 'way', 'nearly', 'non-stop', 'interviews', 'most', 'uninspiring', 'bland', 'people', 'nearly', 'sleep', 'other', 'problem', 'how', 'stories', 'unfold', 'confounding', 'viewer', 'are', 'items', 'Doty', 'being', 'interviewed', 'were', 'stories', 'concocted', 'be', 'passed', 'then', 'later', 'was', 'truth', 'time', ""'re"", 'done', 'listening', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'UFO', 'technology', 'being', 'used', 'backtracked', 'was', 'faked', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'what', 'job', 'was', 'do', 'end', 'own', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'shaken', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'confirmed', 'ever', 'elusive', 'Bigfoot', 'long', 'seen', 'never', 'found', 'UFO', 'belief', 'sighted', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'side', 'skeptic', 'When', 'find', 'please', 'let', 'know']",Mirage Men
1695077,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B00IXPQUCQ,Matthew Kresal,"[3, 3]","Truth, as the saying goes, is often stranger than fiction. When it comes to the UFO phenomenon and the topics associated associated with it, that would most certainly appear to be the case. Based on the book by Mark Pilkington, the documentary film Mirage Men certainly proves that the real world can produce tales as strange as any you are likely to encounter in a science fiction tale.Mirage Men explores more than sixty years of government involvement in the UFO phenomenon but it doesn't so with the typical conspiratorial overtones. While it touches upon everything from rumors of secret government bases to crashed UFOs, it really looks at something just as compelling: how the phenomenon has been manipulated, especially by groups and agencies within our own government.The main focus of the documentary is Richard Doty, a former agent of the Air Force Office Of Special Investigations (AFSOI). The documentary looks at how Doty and some of his colleagues in the 1980s were responsible for helping to foster much of what is today part of the lore that has become synonymous with UFOs. For example, it presents what one interviewee calls the &#8220;sad, strange, horrible&#8221; true story of electronics engineer and UFO researcher Paul Bennewitz who, having filmed and recorded transmissions from what he thought were UFOs, was targeted by Doty and his colleagues to the point of being driven virtually insane, having come to believe an alien invasion was imminent from underground bases in New Mexico.The Bennewitz story is just the tip of the iceberg. The documentary explores the efforts Doty and his colleagues made around the same time with others including UFO researcher William Moore (one of the original investigators of Roswell) who made a Faustian bargain that involved him spying on others in the UFO research community in an attempt to get information out of the government and investigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe who Doty handed documents claiming humans had been genetically altered by aliens. There's also an exploration of cattle mutilations with the odd origins of that sideline of the UFO story and ends by exploring the alleged human/alien exchange program Project Serpo, which appears to be just the latest addition of disinformation to UFO lore.The question the documentary really tries to answer  is a simple one: why do any of this at all? Is it just a series of cover stories to protect any number of things from the early development of stealth technology in the 1980s to drones in more recent times? Is it to cover up what the government actually knows about UFOs? Or is the truth somewhere in the middle perhaps, having been perhaps irrevocably distorted by the need for &#8220;national security&#8221;?In the end, Mirage Men doesn't have all the answers nor claims to have them. What it does present on the other hand is a fascinating look at how the UFO phenomenon, whatever the truth behind it might be, has been  manipulated and often so by the very government that claims they don't exist at all. Ultimately then, Mirage Men shows that the truth might be very well out there but it may be stranger than anything we could imagine.",5,Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,3178,"['Truth', 'saying', 'often', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'When', 'UFO', 'phenomenon', 'topics', 'associated', 'associated', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'appear', 'be', 'case', 'Based', 'book', 'Mark', 'Pilkington', 'documentary', 'film', 'Mirage', 'Men', 'certainly', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'produce', 'tales', 'as', 'strange', 'are', 'likely', 'encounter', 'science', 'fiction', 'tale.Mirage', 'Men', 'more', 'sixty', 'years', 'government', 'involvement', 'UFO', 'phenomenon', ""n't"", 'so', 'typical', 'conspiratorial', 'overtones', 'everything', 'rumors', 'secret', 'government', 'bases', 'crashed', 'UFOs', 'really', 'something', 'just', 'compelling', 'how', 'phenomenon', 'been', 'manipulated', 'especially', 'groups', 'agencies', 'own', 'government.The', 'main', 'focus', 'documentary', 'Richard', 'Doty', 'former', 'agent', 'Air', 'Force', 'Office', 'Special', 'Investigations', 'AFSOI', 'documentary', 'looks', 'how', 'Doty', 'colleagues', '1980s', 'were', 'responsible', 'helping', 'foster', 'much', 'what', 'today', 'part', 'lore', 'become', 'synonymous', 'UFOs', 'example', 'what', 'one', 'interviewee', '8220', 'sad', 'strange', 'horrible', '8221', 'true', 'story', 'electronics', 'engineer', 'UFO', 'researcher', 'Paul', 'Bennewitz', 'who', 'having', 'filmed', 'recorded', 'transmissions', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'UFOs', 'was', 'targeted', 'Doty', 'colleagues', 'point', 'being', 'driven', 'virtually', 'insane', 'having', 'come', 'believe', 'alien', 'invasion', 'was', 'imminent', 'underground', 'bases', 'New', 'Mexico.The', 'Bennewitz', 'story', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'documentary', 'efforts', 'Doty', 'colleagues', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'others', 'including', 'UFO', 'researcher', 'William', 'Moore', 'one', 'original', 'investigators', 'Roswell', 'who', 'made', 'Faustian', 'bargain', 'involved', 'spying', 'others', 'UFO', 'research', 'community', 'attempt', 'get', 'information', 'government', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'Linda', 'Moulton', 'Howe', 'who', 'Doty', 'handed', 'documents', 'claiming', 'humans', 'had', 'been', 'genetically', 'altered', 'aliens', 'also', 'exploration', 'cattle', 'mutilations', 'odd', 'origins', 'sideline', 'UFO', 'story', 'ends', 'exploring', 'alleged', 'human/alien', 'exchange', 'program', 'Project', 'Serpo', 'be', 'just', 'latest', 'addition', 'disinformation', 'UFO', 'lore.The', 'question', 'documentary', 'really', 'answer', 'simple', 'one', 'why', 'do', 'just', 'series', 'cover', 'stories', 'protect', 'number', 'things', 'early', 'development', 'stealth', 'technology', '1980s', 'drones', 'more', 'recent', 'times', 'cover', 'up', 'what', 'government', 'actually', 'UFOs', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'perhaps', 'having', 'been', 'perhaps', 'irrevocably', 'distorted', 'need', '8220', 'national', 'security', '8221', 'end', 'Mirage', 'Men', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'claims', 'have', 'What', 'present', 'other', 'hand', 'fascinating', 'look', 'how', 'UFO', 'phenomenon', 'truth', 'might', 'be', 'been', 'manipulated', 'often', 'so', 'very', 'government', 'claims', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Ultimately', 'then', 'Mirage', 'Men', 'truth', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'stranger', 'anything', 'could', 'imagine']",Mirage Men
