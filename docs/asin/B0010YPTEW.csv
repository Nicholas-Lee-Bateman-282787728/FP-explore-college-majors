I also went to Memphis with some friends & saw him there too. Over the years I have seen & heard Mr. King sevsral times, even once at the Exit Inn in Nashville. So I am well aquainted with him, his Band & his music. This DVD shows him at Memphis & Nashville. While the quality of both sound and video could have been better, the DVD shows Mr. King doin' what he does best. Playing & talking to the people that love him!!! With that being said I suggest that if you don't have this DVD, you need to add it to your collection. You want be sorry!!!! Peace & Love, ~Billy~",5,"B.B.

Finding it online was easy,the vendor shipped it quickly and I have watched it with great pleasure.Filmed in the fall of 2007 from his night clubs in Nashville and Memphis,the audience reaction and professionalism of the recording crew to BB's genuine desire to entertain was an unqualified success. Special features on the dvd enhance the content and are something not to be missed. I would rate it with five large stars for this Blues Master at 82 and still going strong....An exceptional value.....Jazzman joe",5,Blues Master,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,606,"['seeing', 'BB', 'King', 'perform', 'recently', 'Altoona', 'Iowa', 'was', 'impatient', 'order', 'latest', 'DVD', 'Finding', 'online', 'was', 'easy', 'vendor', 'shipped', 'quickly', 'have', 'watched', 'great', 'pleasure.Filmed', 'fall', '2007', 'night', 'clubs', 'Nashville', 'Memphis', 'audience', 'reaction', 'professionalism', 'recording', 'crew', 'BB', 'genuine', 'desire', 'entertain', 'was', 'unqualified', 'success', 'Special', 'features', 'dvd', 'enhance', 'content', 'are', 'something', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'would', 'rate', 'five', 'large', 'stars', 'Blues', 'Master', '82', 'still', 'going', 'strong', '.An', 'exceptional', 'value', '..Jazzman', 'joe']",N/A
1127918,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B0010YPTEW,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[0, 0]","This is B.B.King & his great touring band up close & personal. B.B. has great interaction with the audience. He was 81 years old when this was filmed at his club in Nashville on October 26 & 27, 2006, and at his club in Memphis on October 29, & 30, 2006. B.B.King is not only one of the best blues musicians ever, he is also a pure Southern Gentleman. He tells stories about his early years, growing up on a Mississippi plantation, and driving a tractor in the fields. He said he had been wanting to do an up-close and personal concert like this for quite some time.Note: This is all electric blues, the band is fantastic, you get horns, keyboards, another guitar player, bass player, & the whole works bascially. Of course, B.B. has his trusty companion ""Lucille"" as his electric guitar, and man can he play.I'm not sure of the running time, but this is a full-length concert, put together very well. B.B. is very sharp in this dvd. The music is outstanding.This concert includes the song ""When Love Comes To Town"". He explains that the Rock Band U2 & Bono wrote that song for him. It is included in U2's Rattle & Hum DVD, with B.B. performing with U2.At the end of the concert, B.B. throws out handfulls of guitar picks, and even passes out soviniers.This is one GREAT show from beginning to end.I do believe this is the best blues concert dvd that I've seen.Thanks!!!",5,B.B.

1127919,A3OGU0X4BV2ZM,B0010YPTEW,j.,"[0, 0]","This is a superior DVD in sound, video and content, with the concert running nearly 2 hours.  The transition between the four shows is done very well.  This DVD was put together with a lot of love for the fans.  B. B. King wanted this to be the best of the best - Perhaps a legacy...  The guitar work is blazing and his band is great.It cracked me up when he kept having problems with his bow tie and asks for assistance from the crowd to help remove it (He never misses a step during the on-going song).  The young man that helped puts out his hand for the tie but B. B. King hands it to the young lady a few seats down.All of the songs are well done.  My favorite - Well - Do you know U2?I liked the 2 special features too, with a 15 minute making of the DVD (More than just technical details - some history too), and a 10 minute message from B. B. King to his fans.  He seems to realize time is creeping up on him and mentions Lucille will not be buried with him, but wants her at the grave-side.Also, B. B. King mentions the song See That My Grave Is Kept Clean (By Blind Lemon), but it is not on this DVD - The song appears on a re-issue of the 2009 Soundstage show in Chicago (Credits indicate filmed in 2008), which is a one night performance.  The title is noted as B.B. King: Live (2009) - ASIN: B004USUOUE.Hope this helps.  j",5,When Love Comes To Town,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,1335,"['superior', 'DVD', 'sound', 'video', 'content', 'concert', 'running', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'transition', 'four', 'shows', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'DVD', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'lot', 'love', 'fans', 'B', 'B', 'King', 'wanted', 'be', 'best', 'best', 'Perhaps', 'legacy', 'guitar', 'work', 'blazing', 'band', 'great.It', 'cracked', 'when', 'kept', 'having', 'problems', 'bow', 'tie', 'assistance', 'crowd', 'help', 'remove', 'never', 'step', 'on-going', 'song', 'young', 'man', 'helped', 'puts', 'out', 'hand', 'tie', 'B', 'B', 'King', 'hands', 'young', 'lady', 'few', 'seats', 'down.All', 'songs', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'favorite', 'Well', 'Do', 'know', 'U2', 'liked', '2', 'special', 'features', 'too', '15', 'minute', 'making', 'DVD', 'More', 'just', 'technical', 'details', 'history', 'too', '10', 'minute', 'message', 'B', 'B', 'King', 'fans', 'realize', 'time', 'creeping', 'up', 'mentions', 'Lucille', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buried', 'grave-side.Also', 'B', 'B', 'King', 'song', 'See', 'My', 'Grave', 'Is', 'Kept', 'Clean', 'Blind', 'Lemon', 'not', 'DVD', 'song', 're-issue', '2009', 'Soundstage', 'show', 'Chicago', 'Credits', 'indicate', 'filmed', '2008', 'one', 'night', 'performance', 'title', 'noted', 'B.B', 'King', 'Live', '2009', 'ASIN', 'B004USUOUE.Hope', 'j']",N/A
1127920,A1623N94C3XATU,B0010YPTEW,"Rick Shaq Goldstein ""*SHAQ*""","[6, 9]","This DVD is B.B. Kings most recent live recorded performance. It was recorded at B.B's Memphis and Nashville clubs. At eighty-one years old Mr. King is a musical marvel. He doesn't miss a beat and seamlessly integrates his music, his band, and his amazing voice. And by virtue of this stalwart fusion, he literally holds the enthusiastic live crowd in the palm of his hand. The selections on this DVD combine songs from both sides of B.B.'s menu of blues. The tunes range from soothing mellow blues to rocking blues. Just when you think B.B. can only relax you, a rumbling blue thunder that starts deep inside his chest culminates in a growling rocking blues eruption. There are also some nice horn solos by his band and B.B. shows he can still bend those strings the way electric blues strings were meant to be bent. I saw B.B. interviewed on CNN last night (2/18/08) and the reporter asked him; out of all his songs in his long career which song did he feel he was most identified with? B.B. said: ""I'll tell you a secret, just between you and me, if you don't tell anyone. (Remember this is on national TV.) It's ""THE THRILL IS GONE"". But the secret is that I play it different every time I play it!""Included on this release along with ""THE THRILL IS GONE"" are other old favorites such as ""WHEN LOVE COMES TO TOWN"" with B.B. sharing with the audience some inside info about the creation of that song. He also records ""YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE"" and ""WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN"" for the first time ever. I recommend this CD to people of all age groups and all types of music lovers. B.B.'s talent and performance on this DVD bridges all generations and genres. I truly believe Mr. King has found the ""BLUES-FOUNTAIN-OF-YOUTH"" and when the last song on the DVD ""WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN"" plays you're ready to jump in line and follow his parade wherever it may lead!",5,"RICK ""SHAQ"" GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""B.B.'s LATEST LIVE PERFORMANCE DEFINES CLASS & SMOOTH PROFESSIONAL BLUES!""",1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,1871,"['DVD', 'B.B', 'Kings', 'most', 'recent', 'live', 'recorded', 'performance', 'was', 'recorded', 'B.B', 'Memphis', 'Nashville', 'clubs', 'eighty-one', 'years', 'old', 'Mr.', 'King', 'musical', 'marvel', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beat', 'seamlessly', 'music', 'band', 'amazing', 'voice', 'virtue', 'stalwart', 'fusion', 'literally', 'enthusiastic', 'live', 'crowd', 'palm', 'hand', 'selections', 'DVD', 'combine', 'songs', 'sides', 'B.B', 'menu', 'blues', 'tunes', 'range', 'soothing', 'mellow', 'blues', 'rocking', 'blues', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'B.B', 'can', 'only', 'relax', 'rumbling', 'blue', 'thunder', 'deep', 'chest', 'culminates', 'growling', 'rocking', 'blues', 'eruption', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'horn', 'solos', 'band', 'B.B', 'can', 'still', 'bend', 'strings', 'way', 'electric', 'blues', 'strings', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'bent', 'saw', 'B.B', 'interviewed', 'CNN', 'last', 'night', '2/18/08', 'reporter', 'asked', 'songs', 'long', 'career', 'song', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'most', 'identified', 'B.B', 'said', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'secret', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'Remember', 'national', 'TV', 'THE', 'THRILL', 'IS', 'GONE', 'secret', 'play', 'different', 'time', 'play', 'Included', 'release', 'THE', 'THRILL', 'IS', 'GONE', 'are', 'other', 'old', 'favorites', 'such', 'WHEN', 'LOVE', 'COMES', 'TO', 'TOWN', 'B.B', 'sharing', 'audience', 'info', 'creation', 'song', 'also', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'MY', 'SUNSHINE', 'WHEN', 'THE', 'SAINTS', 'GO', 'MARCHING', 'IN', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'recommend', 'CD', 'people', 'age', 'groups', 'types', 'music', 'lovers', 'B.B', 'talent', 'performance', 'DVD', 'generations', 'genres', 'truly', 'believe', 'Mr.', 'King', 'found', 'BLUES-FOUNTAIN-OF-YOUTH', 'when', 'last', 'song', 'DVD', 'WHEN', 'SAINTS', 'GO', 'MARCHING', 'IN', ""'re"", 'ready', 'jump', 'line', 'follow', 'parade', 'may', 'lead']",N/A
