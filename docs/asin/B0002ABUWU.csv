829279,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,B0002ABUWU,absent_minded_prof,"[14, 15]","I had a lot of fun watching this fun, unpretentious little film.  In it, we relive the 2003 Red Sox season through the eyes and experiences of about eight or ten particularly hardcore, diehard fans.  We see the Red Sox from April through October of 2003, and really get to know the fans and their religion -- whoops, I meant to say ""pastime.""Some other reviewers seem to come down pretty hard on ""Angry Bill.""  He seems like a fairly regular fan to me, albeit a fiercely opinionated one.  We see him begin the season as a bitter, disillusioned lifelong fan.  As the season progresses favorably, he slowly morphs into a hopeful, dewey-eyed True Believer.  At the end, of course, he digresses into a tragic figure, embracing total despair once again.  Personally, my heart really went out to Angry Bill.  I myself sometimes tend to be kind of a masochist, but even for me being a Red Sox fan is often just too much to ask.  Every year, you know exactly what you're in for...  So, I felt like Angry Bill hit a familiar chord in Boston.  People shouldn't judge him so harshly.Other fans we meet include the two twenty-something female roommates from East Boston, Jess and Erin.  They are a lot of fun to see, and to hear, as they express their opinions.  They have some especially cool scenes in the Bonus Features part of the DVD, so, don't miss that part.  For example, apparently lots of their male friends accuse them of ""stalking"" the Red Sox, but they point out that no one accuses obsessive male fans of being stalkers, although, conceivably, that accusation could plausibly be made.  This  indignant sense of what is right is emblematic of Jess and Erin's spirit, and of their general feistiness.  You gotta love it.Some of my other favorite fans interviewed include Steve Craven, the thoughtful fireman who shares his experiences as a lifelong fan; Jermaine, who always seemed just on the verge of saying ""wassuuuuup!!!"" when he spoke on the phone with his friends; and Jim Connors, the dreamer who dared to open a Boston-themed sports bar in Santa Monica, California.  I also enjoyed hearing from the young guy in the wheelchair, for whom the spirit of the Red Sox appeared to mean more than, perhaps, for some other fans.  On a personal note, I was hit particularly hard by his description of the accident which put him in his wheelchair.  Apparently this took place in a boating accident at Hale Reservation, which lies in the Dover/Westwood area right outside Boston.  Our family used to go boating and swimming there all the time, when I was a kid.  Bostonians can expect many familiar references along these lines from this film, as interviewees walk through local neighborhoods, restaurants, etc.Theo Epstein has some pretty engaging scenes in this film, memorably the moment in which he must grapple with being called a ""nerd"" in a gigantic headline with an accompanying, unflattering photo, on the front page of the Boston Herald.  Don't you just hate when that happens?!?Viewers from outside New England may want to prepare themselves for the Boston accent, and Boston phraseology, which is pretty hardcore here at times.  FYI, ""wicked"" means ""very.""  Trust me, this is really helpful information...  You might want to bone up by watching a few reruns of Cliff Clavin on ""Cheers,"" or by listening to some of the hockey players from Boston in the recent hockey film ""Miracle.""  I think that some of those actors must have been local boys, because I don't think I've ever heard the Boston accent nailed so dead-on perfectly onscreen.When the film gets into the actual clubhouse, bullpen and dugout, we get to see how hilarious Pedro Martinez can be in person.  David Ortiz is a real card as well...  I would have liked to see more footage of the awesome Kevin Millar, who, in my personal opinion, sometimes starts to sound disturbingly like Boomhauer from ""King of the Hill,"" when they interview him immediately after a game, and he's so exhausted that he can't even speak clearly.  Another funny thing, that I would have liked to have seen covered more, is the way that local TV stations always cue quasi-subliminal Evil Empire music from Star Wars, when covering the Yankees.  That always cracks me up.A few interviewees compare being a lifelong Red Sox fan with being chronically mistreated, in a dysfunctional relationship with a neglectful, or otherwise recalcitrant, significant other. This made me chuckle knowingly...  It is also interesting to hear how the traditional desire of the Red Sox for a World Series championship so often gets intermingled with the enmity towad the Yankees.  If you think about it, the two topics don't necessarily need to be connected, but of course they always are.  In interviews, discussion of the one topic seems perennially to lead ineluctably, if not logically, to discussion of the other.Some of the players are curiously difficult to recognize, considering that this is only from last year (as of the time that I'm writing).  It's like three quarters of the team went for Extreme Makeovers.  I'm not sure why this might be, but many of the players now have very different haircuts, beards, etc from 2003.As I'm writing this, October 11, 2004, the Red Sox eternal quest to win a World Series looks a heck of a lot less quixotic than it generally does.  Could this be The Year???  They swept the Angels in three games just a few days ago, and the Yankees, it appears, are next.  They just don't come across as ""underdogs"" these days, but, dare I say it, more as a battalion of unstoppable baseball Terminators!  I hereby join the fans interviewed, my newfound friends from this fine, fun film, in fervently praying oh please... oh please... let this be The Year!",4,"Well, I Love That Dirty

829280,AEMZRE6QYVQBS,B0002ABUWU,David A. Baer,"[2, 3]","For Red Sox fans, 2003 was the year that we finally understood that our world is an evil place.It was the anteroom to 2004's glory. It was purgatory, a furnace of affliction. It was the sum of all our fears. For a moment, when we could not summon the strength to look away from the horror, it seemed that we had descended to hell. Momentarily, Dante was a sportswriter for the Globe, all was darkness, and the unbearable screaming just wouldn't stop.STILL WE BELIEVE follows an endearing coterie of fans through the season of our hopes, one that would end in venerable BoSox fashion by a spectacular sequence of crashing and burning. Grady Little would be exiled to North Carolina, his given name rarely pronounced in New England after his American League Championship Series decision to allow a stubborn Petey to stay on the mound when his arm clearly needed a shower. Dan Shaughnessy would memorably label him 'He Who Shall Not Be Named', a verbal refusal to acknowledge the hapless tool of Satan that he became on that terrible night in the Bronx.It's odd to watch this move again after the Exorcism of  2004, when Evil unexpectedly ambushed those Yankees, the planets shifted in their orbits, and Red Sox Nation had to adjust to the psychological impossibility that we had won it all.One senses the eventual redemption of these hapless 2003 fans, a bright light on the horizon that they themselves could not yet see.We did win it all.

829281,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,B0002ABUWU,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[45, 46]","Watching this DVD after October 27, 2004 is like watching ""Three Kings"" after the 2003 Iraq war.  It documents or portrays a relevant moment in time, immortalizing it forever, yet subsequent events drastically affect the poignancy of the original artistic achievement.All of a sudden the 2003 season seems like lifetimes ago, literally the product of another age where belief in curses and accepting the fact that the Boston Red Sox were doomed to eternal tragedy were routine protocol.  Already the mindset of the ""wicked hahd"" Red Sox fan is evolving to appreciate the mind-bending reality of the accomplishments of the 2004 World Champion Boston Red Sox (I am sorely tempted to type that a second time just to see how it looks once more).Having said that, as a baseball fan from Atlanta who has watched a once-young and energetic team with a moribund history evolve into soulless, staid, corporate New York Yankees wanna-be's (who lack the Yankees' finishing power in October) and has watched my hometown Braves' fanbase shrink year-by-year as the masses of local bandwagoneers lose interest, I cannot help but watch with considerable envy the pure (and even desperate) joy and love that the baseball fans of Boston have for their team.  And the energy of the Red Sox themselves make me wish the Braves played with even half the heart evidenced by the Sox, in 2003 as well as 2004.Red Sox Nation, this documentary is your masterpiece of a self-portrait...true, it begs for a revision following the team's astounding postseason run in 2004.

829282,A24BUT5LD6FNQ6,B0002ABUWU,Matthew Wall,"[12, 13]","This review refers to the DVD edition.""Still We Believe"" will have obvious appeal for Boston Red Sox fans, and following the Championship of 2004, the somewhat downbeat ending to the film will no longer be a source of pain to the faithful. The filmmakers were given full access to the Red Sox during the 2003 season to make a documentary, from eavesdropping in the locker room to a full-season time-lapse camera angle of the field mounted on the roof behind home plate. (Paul Doyle is given credit as the director, but as he says on the DVD audio commentary, it was largely a group effort). With the original intent of providing a team documentary, they started to follow the season through the eyes of  a selected group of fans as a sort of video sidebar.It's a sign of excellent documentary filmmaking that they then decided, once the season was over and the project had developed, that the focus of this film became the journey of those hardcore fans over the course of the season. The team is obviously the centerpiece, but it's almost a MacGuffin (Hitchcock's term for something in a film that seems to be the center of attention but which is just there to get the action moving along -- like the Maltese falcon in ""The Maltese Falcon"" or Private Ryan in ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc.)As such, this is most assuredly not a document of the 2003 season, and not a conventional sports documentary. As a Red Sox fan, I surely enjoyed the perspective of seeing the oh-too-familiar vicissitudes of the season through seven fans eyes. The fans they ended up selecting are a sort of spectrum of types, from the radio talk show call-in regulars Angry Bill and Jermaine to a pair of working class sisters to a high school coach and a fire fighter, with the California transplant owner of Sonny McLean's as a stand-in for the diaspora of Red Sox fans across the country.There are, to be sure, a few candid sequences from the team and its management to spice things up, but in the context of the whole film, it's a way of showing how the team matters so much more in some ways to its fans than to the players or owners. The players and owners do care, but they have their bottom lines and a sense of other professional opportunities. For the fans, their loyalty is supreme and it is they who seem, in the end, to actually make up the entity known as the Boston Red Sox more than the guys who actually put it on at the ballpark.What I found particularly interesting in watching this film on DVD (especially after this past election and its discussion of values and loyalty) is how well the center of this movie does seem to be the sense of faith beyond reason, of shared community, of resilience in the face of disappointment that characterizes Red Sox fans and New England.It should not be a surprise that many of the people involved in this movie are students of the Ken Burns school of documentary film; Burns himself focusses on 'The American Experience' as a recurring theme in his own work, from 'The Civil War' and 'Baseball' to 'Brooklyn Bridge' and 'Jazz'. There are traces of the Burns style here, but there are no sonorous voiceovers or talking heads. The technique is to follow the fans as they watch the games and mull the aftermath, interspersing this with occasional tidbits from the players and management. One gets the best of both worlds: the narrative of the structure of the season is clear as a backdrop, but the temptation of the conventional sports film does not intrude upon the main text of really showing how the fans are turned inside out by their odd relationship with their team.The subtle, and almost quiet musical tracks used are an indicator this is not your traditional sports documentary. The editing and selectivity of the filmmakers in making the final film is even more apparent in looking at the DVD edition, which contains many out-takes and extra scenes. These out-takes nearly all have interest -- the very, very long featurette on ""Angry Bill"" in isolation is nearly a documentary in itself -- but if you view them in sequence after watching the movie, you'll understand exactly how disciplined the filmmakers were in making the decisions they did about what to leave out.One of the nice DVD extras is interviews with the participants in the film at the movie's premiere. It's a sort of ""they're OK"" coda that may take some of the sting out of the sad ending to the 2003 season (where the main film stops).Note: there's one easter egg available from the main screen -- featuring Kevin Millar on proper foot care. It's not the infamous ""dancing Kevin"" video, alas, but is amusing.I wrote earlier that ""Still We Believe"" has obvious interest to Red Sox fans, but I believe the success of this will make this interesting viewing above and beyond that core audience. The theatrical release was largely limited to New England, and I think that's a pity, as it would've been interesting to see how it would run to audiences that didn't have a strong rooting interest in the team or perhaps even in baseball. The great theme of how following a sports team is one of the essential emotional -- almost spiritual -- aspects of American life is subtly and expertly stitched together and I think beyond being one of the best sports documentaries of all-time, this movie has a qualification as one of the best documenatries, period, of 2004.I would definitely recommend this for Red Sox fans and for all baseball fans, and would cautiously recommend this to those who just dig good documentaries that end up being about something a little bit more than the apparent subject matter. If you saw the film in the theater when it came out and enjoyed it, I would definitely recommend the DVD for its extensive bonus material.",4,Unconventional Documentary about more than

829284,A1Z3RSRD9E4IRA,B0002ABUWU,Robert Jaz,"[35, 42]","This film is great if you are a die-hard Red Sox fan, but see this even if you only have a passing curiosity such as knowing a loved one that is a fan and you've always wondered why they are so into baseball? or even if you just enjoy seeing a very well made documentary. From the opening credits (which features one of my favorite songs) to the last bittersweet moments, this documentary is nicely crafted and expertly put together. You may come away thinking, how amazing that the cameras were rolling to capture many of these key moments of last season.For me it brought back all of the excitement: the player's reactions, the highs, the sad ending to an amazing season, and best of all, fan profiles and interviews that are incredible. One fan, Angry Bill steals the film, and I think the Red Sox should hire him as a consultant. Two fans are almost like deadhead groupies in their obsession of going to games and following around the ""band"" when they are on tour. There's some wonderful behind the scenes segments that for me were really fun and revealing. Pedro comes off as a truly funny goofball and John Henry is uniquely special.Many many moments made me and my girlfriend laugh - If you look closely you'll get to see loads of candy and seeds lined up in the clubhouse for the players to dip into (we just thought this was the best, as many of the players often seem so much like big kids) not to mention the still uncomfortable chuckle you get from the Pedro / Zimmer scuffle.All in all you will probably leave this film wanting to see another game and just hoping that once again, this may be the year! If not for anyone other than Angry Bill.Warning: This film is NOT recommended to Yankee fans...",5,A Love Letter to the Red Sox team and their fans,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,1711,"['film', 'great', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'see', 'even', 'only', 'have', 'passing', 'curiosity', 'such', 'knowing', 'loved', 'one', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'baseball', 'even', 'just', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'opening', 'credits', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs', 'last', 'bittersweet', 'moments', 'documentary', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'expertly', 'put', 'together', 'may', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'how', 'amazing', 'cameras', 'were', 'rolling', 'capture', 'many', 'key', 'moments', 'last', 'season.For', 'brought', 'back', 'excitement', 'player', 'reactions', 'highs', 'sad', 'ending', 'amazing', 'season', 'best', 'fan', 'profiles', 'interviews', 'are', 'incredible', 'One', 'fan', 'Angry', 'Bill', 'film', 'think', 'Red', 'Sox', 'should', 'hire', 'consultant', 'Two', 'fans', 'are', 'almost', 'deadhead', 'groupies', 'obsession', 'going', 'games', 'following', 'band', 'when', 'are', 'tour', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'segments', 'were', 'really', 'fun', 'revealing', 'Pedro', 'off', 'truly', 'funny', 'goofball', 'John', 'Henry', 'uniquely', 'special.Many', 'many', 'moments', 'made', 'girlfriend', 'look', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'loads', 'candy', 'seeds', 'lined', 'up', 'clubhouse', 'players', 'dip', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'many', 'players', 'often', 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'big', 'kids', 'not', 'mention', 'still', 'uncomfortable', 'chuckle', 'get', 'Pedro', '/', 'Zimmer', 'scuffle.All', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'film', 'wanting', 'see', 'game', 'just', 'hoping', 'once', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'year', 'not', 'anyone', 'other', 'Angry', 'Bill.Warning', 'film', 'NOT', 'recommended', 'Yankee', 'fans']","Still, We Believe - The Boston Red Sox Movie"
829285,A2PAKB0NYQLCSG,B0002ABUWU,Scott MacGillivray,"[2, 3]","There are baseball fans, and then there are Red Sox fans, who are a breed apart. This writer expected ""Still, We Believe"" to be a recap of the 2003 Boston Red Sox season, so the viewer could again experience the team's exhilarating victories and disappointing defeats. (This writer subsequently saw the documentary ""Cowboy Up!"", which fits this description.)Paul Doyle, Jr.'s ""Still, We Believe,"" however, focuses on the fans; the season's games are a backdrop for the Fenway faithful. There is no narration; Doyle lets the fans themselves do the talking, and he cuts back and forth to each type of fan as the season progresses.Most memorable is the irate sports-radio caller ""Angry Bill."" When the team loses, this guy knew it all along. When the team wins, this guy was STILL right. Filmmaker Doyle gives Angry Bill enough rope to hang himself, and by the end of the movie you're laughing at everything Bill says. There is also frequent footage of a pair of women who are the Lucy Ricardo and Ethel Mertz of baseball; they think nothing of using the office computers and tying up multiple telephones to snag playoff tickets at six in the morning. (They are such devoted fans that pitcher Derek Lowe signals to them from the field, expecting to see his name on one of their insignia shirts.)For contrast, we have the inspiring story of a young man confined to a wheelchair, who believes in his team and vows to keep a grueling rehabilitation regimen during the season. Then there is the expatriate Sox fan who runs a Boston Red Sox-themed bar in California; the middle-aged firefighter that reflects on being a Sox fan; and the senior couple that stays glued to the games. There is also some enjoyably candid footage of the Sox behind the scenes (Pedro Martinez is very amusing). Paul Doyle's sharp editing punctuates each scene enjoyably.There are two editions of this DVD in release: the original disc of vintage-2003 material, and the two-disc update that revisits the original subjects in 2004, after their beloved Red Sox actually won the World Series. The double-disc version is the one to get, because the first disc follows each fan until the end of the 2003 season and then stops on a wistful, unfinished note; the second disc resolves each vignette nicely.If you're a baseball fan, you'll enjoy this picture. If you're a Red Sox fan, you'll REALLY enjoy this picture.
