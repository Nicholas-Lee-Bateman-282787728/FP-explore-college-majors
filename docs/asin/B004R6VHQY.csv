Why haven't I heard of this?"" well, I thought the same. I heard Anna Faris was in this movie and of course, I had to buy it, I own all of Anna Faris's movies that have been released on DVD. I rebought most of Anna Faris's movies on Blu-Ray. Okay, now on to the ""movie"", I have never disliked an Anna Faris movie in any way, but for some reason, I didn't like it that much. I found myself skipping to the Anna Faris short film, and I didn't think it was that great either.

1426274,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B004R6VHQY,Tony Heck,"[3, 3]","""You have to let yourself go sometimes.""  A movie that has six short films that have nothing to do with one another.  This movie has a great cast, and thats about it.  Of the six stories, three deal with death (mostly suicide), two are pretty boring.  The one bright spot I will say is the ""Spelling Bee"" one.  With Anna Faris and Charlie Sheen (playing himself) commenting on a spelling bee they are watching.  That one was pretty funny, but overall a pretty drab and depressing experience.  This will be one of my shorter ones because it's not really a reviewable movie in the fact that all the little movies are about 15 min and would take to long to talk about every little film.  Unless you are big into the art house films you will not really enjoy it.  This is one that is definatly not for everyone.  Overall, not really that entertaining except for the ""Spelling Bee"" one.  Not much else to say. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - Nope.*Also try - Burning Palms & New York, I Love You",2,"Six short films, mostly about death.  Not that much fun to watch. Great cast and the ""Spelling Bee"" one is funny.
