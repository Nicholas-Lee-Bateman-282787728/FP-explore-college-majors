As with many other people, the first 6 collections were very problematic, freezing, skipping, popping or just flat out not playing. While some die hard fans mark my reviews unhelpful as I report the disc quality and not the quality of the show! (I figure you know what you are buying! and would better like to know the quality of what you are getting.) The series is a solid 5 in my book, and has always been so, but not the first 6 collections due to the double sided, dual layer format that caused so many to be returned, as with other folks here I too had to return 4 of the 6 before I was able to get a collection that would play properly. WITH THIS COLLECTION ... ADV finally saw the light! They released the collection on single sided disc, and while I'm not happy with ADV as I asked if there was a problem with them long, long ago and they just acted as if it was the first time they heard anything. I had to contact them as I was having trouble getting a RMA AGIAN for a bad disc, by correcting the release and putting them on 4 disc instead of 2 they have all but admitted there was in fact a PROBLEM! Even though they would not admit it months ago. I even have an email from them stating there was no plan to release them on 4 disc! I guess they got as tired of complaints as buys got of returning them. The single sided collection is far better than the prior as you would think in quality, no skipping, no popping, no freezing, nothing but good solid Farscape fun and entertainment, without having to try and skip over bad spots or fiddle with to get it to play.We can only hope that ADV will offer a trade in offer on those releases already out to upgrade to the problem free collection. Sure it will cost them money, but it cost those of us with bad disc time and money to find one(s) that worked. (A 80 mile roundtrip drive for me in rural Kentucky) The very least they could do is to offer a replacement collection at cost for the first 6 collections. As of this writing I do not know if they plan to release the first 6 collections (2 seasons) on single sided disc or not, however a wise company would. My guess is you will find a lot of 2 disc collections on eBay if they do. Again a great series finally on enough disc to justify buying it. Plenty of extras over the boxset releases, albeit again many are repeated from disc to disc and collection to collection, overall good video and audio quality for hours of viewing. Well worth adding to your collection for those Farscape fans, just hope the first 6 releases are corrected and re-issued.",5,ADVideo woke up and saw the problem ... finally!!!,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2604,"['Finally', 'can', 'give', 'series', '5', 'stars', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'first', '6', 'collections', 'were', 'very', 'problematic', 'freezing', 'skipping', 'popping', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'not', 'playing', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'mark', 'reviews', 'unhelpful', 'report', 'disc', 'quality', 'not', 'quality', 'show', 'figure', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'buying', 'would', 'better', 'know', 'quality', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'series', 'solid', '5', 'book', 'always', 'been', 'so', 'not', 'first', '6', 'collections', 'due', 'double', 'sided', 'dual', 'layer', 'format', 'caused', 'so', 'many', 'be', 'returned', 'other', 'folks', 'here', 'too', 'had', 'return', '4', '6', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'collection', 'would', 'play', 'properly', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'COLLECTION', 'ADV', 'finally', 'saw', 'light', 'released', 'collection', 'single', 'sided', 'disc', ""'m"", 'not', 'happy', 'ADV', 'asked', 'was', 'problem', 'long', 'long', 'ago', 'just', 'acted', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'anything', 'had', 'contact', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'RMA', 'AGIAN', 'bad', 'disc', 'correcting', 'release', 'putting', '4', 'disc', 'instead', '2', 'have', 'admitted', 'was', 'fact', 'PROBLEM', 'Even', 'would', 'not', 'admit', 'months', 'even', 'have', 'email', 'stating', 'was', 'plan', 'release', '4', 'disc', 'guess', 'got', 'tired', 'complaints', 'buys', 'got', 'returning', 'single', 'sided', 'collection', 'far', 'better', 'prior', 'would', 'think', 'quality', 'skipping', 'popping', 'freezing', 'nothing', 'good', 'solid', 'Farscape', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'having', 'try', 'skip', 'bad', 'spots', 'fiddle', 'get', 'play.We', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'ADV', 'will', 'offer', 'trade', 'offer', 'releases', 'already', 'upgrade', 'problem', 'free', 'collection', 'Sure', 'will', 'cost', 'money', 'cost', 'bad', 'disc', 'time', 'money', 'find', 'one', 's', 'worked', '80', 'mile', 'roundtrip', 'drive', 'rural', 'Kentucky', 'very', 'least', 'could', 'do', 'offer', 'replacement', 'collection', 'cost', 'first', '6', 'collections', 'writing', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'plan', 'release', 'first', '6', 'collections', '2', 'seasons', 'single', 'sided', 'disc', 'not', 'however', 'wise', 'company', 'would', 'guess', 'will', 'find', 'lot', '2', 'disc', 'collections', 'eBay', 'do', 'Again', 'great', 'series', 'finally', 'enough', 'disc', 'justify', 'buying', 'Plenty', 'extras', 'boxset', 'releases', 'albeit', 'again', 'many', 'are', 'repeated', 'disc', 'disc', 'collection', 'collection', 'overall', 'good', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'hours', 'viewing', 'Well', 'adding', 'collection', 'Farscape', 'fans', 'just', 'hope', 'first', '6', 'releases', 'are', 'corrected', 're-issued']","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 9 - Through the Looking Glass / A Bug's Life"

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 1]","I've argued the point as loudly as I can across all of cyberspace: FARSCAPE has usurped the mantle of STAR TREK by producing, unarguably, the most intelligent science fiction for television ever.A product of Hallmark Entertainment and Jim Henson Productions, FARSCAPES legion of fans grows larger and larger every year as the show, airing in the US exclusively on the Sci Fi Channel, just keeps getting better.FARSCAPE Volume #9: THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS and A BUG'S LIFE (two hourlong episodes) are pure joy to watch.  Both episodes have the look and feel of a major motion picture ... they just don't have the length.THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS boasts the premise of what could possibly happen should our reality split into different dimensions ... in this case, four!  Our hero, Earth astronaut John Crichton (flung into parts unknown by a wormhole generated from his Farscape Project), finds passages linking the four realities together, and it's a race against time to bring the four worlds back together into one before an alien menace inadvertantly wrecks them all!A BUG'S LIFE is a splendid morality play (similar to stories done on other science fiction shows) wherein a virus that travels from person to person creates a kind of hypnotic claustrophobia, leaving you to question who do you trust?  Excellent paranoia feel to this episode makes it well worth repeat viewing.The DVD boasts incredible sound (Dolby 5.1), a wonderful featurette on one of FARSCAPE's principals (Lani Tupu), and even includes footage previously not broadcast in the United States (due to time limitations of television).",4,Not Your Father's STAR TREK,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,1606,"[""'ve"", 'argued', 'point', 'as', 'loudly', 'can', 'cyberspace', 'FARSCAPE', 'usurped', 'mantle', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'producing', 'unarguably', 'most', 'intelligent', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'ever.A', 'product', 'Hallmark', 'Entertainment', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Productions', 'FARSCAPES', 'legion', 'fans', 'grows', 'larger', 'larger', 'year', 'show', 'airing', 'US', 'exclusively', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'just', 'getting', 'better.FARSCAPE', 'Volume', '9', 'THE', 'LOOKING', 'GLASS', 'A', 'BUG', 'LIFE', 'two', 'hourlong', 'episodes', 'are', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'episodes', 'have', 'look', 'feel', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'length.THROUGH', 'THE', 'LOOKING', 'GLASS', 'premise', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen', 'should', 'reality', 'split', 'different', 'dimensions', 'case', 'four', 'hero', 'Earth', 'John', 'Crichton', 'flung', 'parts', 'unknown', 'wormhole', 'generated', 'Farscape', 'Project', 'passages', 'linking', 'four', 'realities', 'together', 'race', 'time', 'bring', 'four', 'worlds', 'back', 'together', 'one', 'alien', 'menace', 'inadvertantly', 'A', 'BUG', 'LIFE', 'splendid', 'morality', 'play', 'similar', 'stories', 'done', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'shows', 'wherein', 'virus', 'person', 'person', 'kind', 'hypnotic', 'claustrophobia', 'leaving', 'question', 'who', 'do', 'trust', 'Excellent', 'paranoia', 'feel', 'episode', 'well', 'repeat', 'viewing.The', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'sound', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'wonderful', 'featurette', 'one', 'FARSCAPE', 'principals', 'Lani', 'Tupu', 'even', 'footage', 'previously', 'not', 'broadcast', 'United', 'States', 'due', 'time', 'limitations', 'television']","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 9 - Through the Looking Glass / A Bug's Life"

677398,A2HKBL4AP6WHEN,B00005R23R,"John Kahane ""book and movie lover""","[5, 5]","Science fiction tv series often find it difficult to maintain a high level of quality in their first year, and while FARSCAPE has had some inconsistency in this regard, the ninth DVD of the first season of the series brings us two of the best episodes in the first season to this date.The first episode on the DVD, ""Through the Looking Glass,"" offers the vision of a Moya split into four different realities through the act of the Leviathan's attempting to Starburst without enough energy to make the trip successfully.  Each of the realities has variances from the norm that make the situation more difficult.  Crichton manages to find gateways or doorways between the realities, and attempts to bring the four Moyas back together again.  But there is another force at work here, a force that is ripping gouges in the realities of the various Moyas, and perhaps this is the biggest threat of all...or not.  This episode brings together some of the best characterisation and acting in the series so far, presenting as it does two marvellous ""dinner on Moya"" scenes - one at the beginning, one at the end - that truly frame the differences in the crew at the two different points of the story.  It is an episode where Chiana truly begins to fit in on Moya (in her own way, of course), and where we get to see a different side of Rygel and the others as well.The second episode is ""A Bug's Life,"" the first season episode that leads into the story arc that wraps up the season which will change the lives of the characters forever.  When Larraq and his fellow PK Commandos commandeer Moya to transport a single crate to the Peacekeeper Gammak base in the Uncharted Territories, Crichton and Aeryn masquerade as PKs, while D'Argo, Zhaan, and Rygel pretend to be prisoners once more.  But when Rygel and Chiana's curiosity get the better of them and they open the crate, they release a virus on board that threatens the entire crew...and may cost one of Moya's crew's life.  This episode is a marvellous morality play that deals with the issues of trust, and has a wonderfully paranoid feeling to it.  Heck, ""evil Crichton"" is worth seeing this one for!Both episodes have some extended footage here that adds to the stories in general, and ""A Bug's Life"" is notable in this regard, featuring a good scene between Aeryn and Larraq that explains much of the personality of our favourite female PK.  Thh additional footage in ""Through the Looking Glass"" is also worth the effort of seeing, and provides a bit of insight into the major characters, but doesn't really enhance what we've seen to this point.  What would have made this DVD really exceptional would have been a commentary version of each of these episodes, since both are psychological works that really would have been enhanced by such material.  There is a nice Profile on Lani Tupu's work here, although there was less time than I would have liked to see devoted to Pilot in this, but such is life and all.With two of the best episodes of the first season on it, this ninth FARSCAPE DVD is a good buy as each of these episodes is worth viewing more than once.  A few more extras on the DVD wouldn't have hurt it, but I think that this DVD is still worth the price.",4,FARSCAPE Continues to Shine!,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3222,"['Science', 'fiction', 'tv', 'series', 'often', 'find', 'difficult', 'maintain', 'high', 'level', 'quality', 'first', 'year', 'FARSCAPE', 'had', 'inconsistency', 'regard', 'ninth', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'date.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'vision', 'Moya', 'split', 'four', 'different', 'realities', 'act', 'Leviathan', 'attempting', 'Starburst', 'enough', 'energy', 'make', 'trip', 'successfully', 'realities', 'variances', 'norm', 'make', 'situation', 'more', 'difficult', 'Crichton', 'find', 'gateways', 'doorways', 'realities', 'attempts', 'bring', 'four', 'Moyas', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'force', 'work', 'here', 'force', 'ripping', 'gouges', 'realities', 'various', 'Moyas', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'threat', 'not', 'episode', 'together', 'best', 'characterisation', 'acting', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'presenting', 'two', 'marvellous', 'dinner', 'Moya', 'one', 'beginning', 'one', 'end', 'truly', 'frame', 'differences', 'crew', 'two', 'different', 'points', 'story', 'episode', 'where', 'Chiana', 'truly', 'fit', 'Moya', 'own', 'way', 'course', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'Rygel', 'others', 'well.The', 'second', 'episode', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'first', 'season', 'episode', 'story', 'arc', 'up', 'season', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'characters', 'forever', 'When', 'Larraq', 'fellow', 'PK', 'Commandos', 'commandeer', 'Moya', 'transport', 'single', 'crate', 'Peacekeeper', 'Gammak', 'base', 'Uncharted', 'Territories', 'Crichton', 'Aeryn', 'masquerade', 'PKs', ""D'Argo"", 'Zhaan', 'Rygel', 'pretend', 'be', 'prisoners', 'once', 'more', 'when', 'Rygel', 'Chiana', 'curiosity', 'get', 'better', 'open', 'crate', 'release', 'virus', 'board', 'entire', 'crew', 'may', 'cost', 'one', 'Moya', 'crew', 'life', 'episode', 'marvellous', 'morality', 'play', 'issues', 'trust', 'wonderfully', 'paranoid', 'feeling', 'Heck', 'evil', 'Crichton', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'episodes', 'have', 'extended', 'footage', 'here', 'stories', 'general', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'notable', 'regard', 'featuring', 'good', 'scene', 'Aeryn', 'Larraq', 'much', 'personality', 'favourite', 'female', 'PK', 'Thh', 'additional', 'footage', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'also', 'worth', 'effort', 'seeing', 'bit', 'insight', 'major', 'characters', ""n't"", 'really', 'enhance', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'point', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'DVD', 'really', 'exceptional', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'commentary', 'version', 'episodes', 'are', 'psychological', 'works', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enhanced', 'such', 'material', 'nice', 'Profile', 'Lani', 'Tupu', 'work', 'here', 'was', 'less', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'devoted', 'Pilot', 'such', 'life', 'all.With', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'ninth', 'FARSCAPE', 'DVD', 'good', 'buy', 'episodes', 'worth', 'viewing', 'more', 'once', 'few', 'more', 'extras', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'think', 'DVD', 'still', 'worth', 'price']","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 9 - Through the Looking Glass / A Bug's Life"

Without spoilers, the first one begins with the crew hilariously munching out and trashing each other while occasionally throwing food, interrupted by Moya splitting into dimensions.  The dimensional shifts are handled differently than usual, which is quite interesting.  In A Bug's Life, Crichton masquerades as a Peacekeeper captain in order to deal with a peacekeeper crew landing on Moya, but much else goes on, with Erin particularly good in this episode believably attracted to someone other than John.  The &quot;extra&quot; focuses on Lani Tupu.

This is not the utopia of Star Trek, where we humans are always good and everyone else ends up being so impressed by us in the end.  These creatures have seen lots of different sentient beings, and we are just one of them.  In fact, we are evolutionarily far behind most of them, and the human is at best tolerated, and at worst, teased for his cluelessness.  The only reason anyone chases him is because a more advanced being put knowledge in his head that has worth, and he accidentally killed the brother of an important official.  Our space hubris was put aside in this show, making it so much more touching and amusing.

677405,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005R23R,Robert Moore,"[29, 30]","Warning:  SpoilersActually, the spoiler alert was fairly needless since the official editorial review provides some pretty major spoilers without a warning.  But I believe in following protocol.For me, this set is where all the great things that happened in the first three seasons of FARSCAPE paid off.  I know of no more poignant, painful, and heartbreaking episodes in all of TV history.  The closest I can come is perhaps the great final episode of Season Two of BUFFY where Buffy is forced to kill Angel after he regains his soul.  In the 3.1 set we saw John Crichton cloned into a copy so perfect that not even the most stringent testing will reveal who is the original.  The 3.2 set collecting the central set up episodes saw the consummation of the love between one of the two Johns and Aeryn and then the death of that John.  Meanwhile, the other John has been anxiously awaiting the return of Aeryn.  This final set deals with Aeryn's struggle to overcome her grief over the death of the one John and her hesitation to become involved with the other, for a host of powerful reasons.  One sympathizes with both John and Aeryn, John because she really has fallen in love with him and expressed her love for him, but with a different copy of himself.  Aeryn, on the other hand, has to contend with a situation that no other lover in history has had to contend, the simultaneous death and survivor of the man she loves.In the final episodes of the 3.2 set, John was able to unlock the wormhole technology hidden in his head and is able via videotape to communicate to the other John the importance of this fact.  The final episodes of the season deal with John's realization that he has to take the offensive to Scorpius.  These are some great episodes filled with wonderful details.  The scenes in which Aeryn has to struggle with her return to a Peacekeeper base are affecting, as is Crais's return.  One of the great visual images in a very visual series occurs when Scorpius, his world in ruin, slowly descends a staircase as he contemplates the enormity of the devastation that John and his friends have wrought.But in the long saga of the love between John and Aeryn, few are as moving as the final episode.  For several episodes they have not had to deal with their situation or confront what had happened with the other John.  Now, however, all changes.  In perhaps their greatest scene together, John does his best to persuade Aeryn to not give up on their love, while she remains determined to leave.  Finally, they agree to flip a coin, and though at the moment it appears that she won, as she puts it in Season Four, they both lost.  An Old Woman who has mysteriously appeared on Moya (she returns as a regular in Season Four and gains a name) and who possesses remarkable medicinal powers informs that Aeryn is pregnant.  In another of the great images that FARSCAPE seemed to create so effortlessly we see John in his space module outside Moya staring determinedly straight ahead, Aeryn in her prowler to John's left gazing at him, trying to get him to acknowledge her before she leaves.  We don't see her leave as much as just fade out of focus.  And thus ends one of the great romantic arcs in the history of television.This bears repeating.  Forget that this is Sci-fi rather than drama or comedy or whatever.  I honestly believe the romantic tensions between John and Aeryn in Season Three represents the most outstanding romantic arc in the history of television.  Television is littered with dozens of great romantic couples, and even when they don't end up with each other at the end of a series, there is a sense that they were meant for each other.  Most of these romances proceed in ways that seem obvious as they are happening.  We might be surprised, but rather are we stunned.  There is almost nothing that happens between John and Aeryn that happens by any book that has ever been written in the history of the medium.  Their romance simply has no other parallels, no analogs.  Even now, after having watched these episodes several times, I remain in awe of how brilliantly conceived this season was.  Season Four would also be a great season on more than one level, but neither as a whole nor as a romance could it match Season Three.I have told numerous friends that they need to watch FARSCAPE for two reasons:  first, it is just a great series as a whole, but second, they need to watch it if for no other reason than to get to Season Three.  I honestly believe that this is the single finest season of any Sci-fi series ever made, and it all comes to fruition in the marvelous episodes in this particular set.",5,My favorite set of shows in the entire run of the show,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,4648,"['Warning', 'SpoilersActually', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'was', 'fairly', 'needless', 'official', 'editorial', 'review', 'pretty', 'major', 'spoilers', 'warning', 'believe', 'following', 'protocol.For', 'set', 'where', 'great', 'things', 'happened', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'FARSCAPE', 'paid', 'off', 'know', 'more', 'poignant', 'painful', 'heartbreaking', 'episodes', 'TV', 'history', 'closest', 'can', 'come', 'perhaps', 'great', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', 'Two', 'BUFFY', 'where', 'Buffy', 'forced', 'kill', 'Angel', 'soul', '3.1', 'set', 'saw', 'John', 'Crichton', 'cloned', 'copy', 'so', 'perfect', 'not', 'even', 'most', 'stringent', 'testing', 'will', 'reveal', 'who', 'original', '3.2', 'set', 'collecting', 'central', 'set', 'up', 'episodes', 'saw', 'consummation', 'love', 'one', 'two', 'Johns', 'Aeryn', 'then', 'death', 'John', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'John', 'been', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'return', 'Aeryn', 'final', 'set', 'deals', 'Aeryn', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'grief', 'death', 'one', 'John', 'hesitation', 'become', 'involved', 'other', 'host', 'powerful', 'reasons', 'One', 'sympathizes', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'John', 'really', 'fallen', 'love', 'expressed', 'love', 'different', 'copy', 'Aeryn', 'other', 'hand', 'contend', 'situation', 'other', 'lover', 'history', 'had', 'contend', 'simultaneous', 'death', 'survivor', 'man', 'final', 'episodes', '3.2', 'set', 'John', 'was', 'able', 'unlock', 'wormhole', 'technology', 'hidden', 'head', 'able', 'videotape', 'communicate', 'other', 'John', 'importance', 'fact', 'final', 'episodes', 'season', 'deal', 'John', 'realization', 'take', 'offensive', 'Scorpius', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'details', 'scenes', 'Aeryn', 'struggle', 'return', 'Peacekeeper', 'base', 'are', 'affecting', 'Crais', 'return', 'One', 'great', 'visual', 'images', 'very', 'visual', 'series', 'when', 'Scorpius', 'world', 'ruin', 'slowly', 'staircase', 'enormity', 'devastation', 'John', 'friends', 'have', 'wrought.But', 'long', 'saga', 'love', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'few', 'are', 'as', 'moving', 'final', 'episode', 'several', 'episodes', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'deal', 'situation', 'confront', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'other', 'John', 'Now', 'however', 'changes', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'scene', 'together', 'John', 'best', 'persuade', 'Aeryn', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'love', 'determined', 'leave', 'Finally', 'agree', 'flip', 'coin', 'moment', 'won', 'Season', 'Four', 'lost', 'Old', 'Woman', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'appeared', 'Moya', 'regular', 'Season', 'Four', 'gains', 'name', 'who', 'remarkable', 'medicinal', 'powers', 'informs', 'Aeryn', 'pregnant', 'great', 'images', 'FARSCAPE', 'seemed', 'create', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'see', 'John', 'space', 'module', 'Moya', 'staring', 'determinedly', 'straight', 'ahead', 'Aeryn', 'prowler', 'John', 'left', 'gazing', 'trying', 'get', 'acknowledge', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'leave', 'as', 'much', 'just', 'fade', 'focus', 'thus', 'one', 'great', 'romantic', 'arcs', 'history', 'television.This', 'bears', 'repeating', 'Forget', 'Sci-fi', 'rather', 'drama', 'comedy', 'honestly', 'believe', 'romantic', 'tensions', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'Season', 'Three', 'most', 'outstanding', 'romantic', 'arc', 'history', 'television', 'Television', 'littered', 'dozens', 'great', 'romantic', 'couples', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'other', 'end', 'series', 'sense', 'were', 'meant', 'other', 'Most', 'romances', 'proceed', 'ways', 'seem', 'obvious', 'are', 'happening', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'rather', 'are', 'stunned', 'almost', 'nothing', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'book', 'ever', 'been', 'written', 'history', 'medium', 'romance', 'simply', 'other', 'parallels', 'analogs', 'Even', 'now', 'having', 'watched', 'episodes', 'several', 'times', 'remain', 'awe', 'how', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'season', 'was', 'Season', 'Four', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'great', 'season', 'more', 'one', 'level', 'whole', 'romance', 'could', 'match', 'Season', 'Three.I', 'have', 'told', 'numerous', 'friends', 'need', 'watch', 'FARSCAPE', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'just', 'great', 'series', 'whole', 'second', 'need', 'watch', 'other', 'reason', 'get', 'Season', 'Three', 'honestly', 'believe', 'single', 'finest', 'season', 'Sci-fi', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'fruition', 'marvelous', 'episodes', 'particular', 'set']","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 9 - Through the Looking Glass / A Bug's Life"
