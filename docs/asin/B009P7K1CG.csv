The item was in great condition. had really great creative works in the movie. a great way to show the kids just how we played with our imagination as kids, before THE WII. lol...it was great to watch daily items around the house find a new purpose in this movie, doing things you wouldn't dream. there is a creative purpose found in everything there is! this movie proves it. the disk worked very well, had no problems with it.

I saw it when abroad and while it is a distinctive and visually appealing stop-motion film, some of the characters are quite scary/disturbing, especially the cigar toting vile bust/statue known as ""Head.""  Head leads the evil ""side"" of the attic against the peace loving ""side"" of the attic.  A rag-tag group from the peace loving side must overcome the evil Head and rescue a kidnaped antique doll.  The voice casting is great, lots of big names and the stop-motion filming is artistic, however, the dark edge of the film may steer this towards the tweens and up (maybe 8-10 and up?).  If you're not sure, you might want to preview it before the kids get a chance to see it.  Other than the caution for the scary factor, definitely worth viewing artsy imaginative work.",4,"Interesting, unique, a little scary for the younger crowd i.e. not Toy Storyesque",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,837,"['film', 'actually', 'recycling', '2009', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'film', 'saw', 'when', 'abroad', 'distinctive', 'visually', 'appealing', 'stop-motion', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'scary/disturbing', 'especially', 'cigar', 'toting', 'vile', 'bust/statue', 'known', 'Head', 'Head', 'evil', 'side', 'attic', 'peace', 'loving', 'side', 'attic', 'rag-tag', 'group', 'peace', 'loving', 'side', 'must', 'overcome', 'evil', 'Head', 'kidnaped', 'antique', 'doll', 'voice', 'casting', 'great', 'lots', 'big', 'names', 'stop-motion', 'filming', 'artistic', 'however', 'dark', 'edge', 'film', 'may', 'steer', 'tweens', 'up', 'maybe', '8-10', 'up', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'might', 'want', 'preview', 'kids', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Other', 'caution', 'scary', 'factor', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'artsy', 'imaginative', 'work']",Toys in the Attic

Yes, it was Claymation and the toys looked a little creepy to me, but my 6 year old daughter somehow enjoyed it so I have to give it at least a 4-star. She's actually watched it at least 3 x now since I've bought it for Christmas.  The story does at least have a good moral value to it so that makes up for the creepy appearance of some of the characters.  It has a very old European feel to it, lol.

That would have sold me right then, since CzechanimatorsandBartain particular display senses of the macabre, joyous, heroic, delicate, and mysterious all at once. (Since so many of them worked, or tried to, during the Soviet oppression, that seems rather natural.)This, like any brilliant work of art, works at many levels. Physically the puppets and objects combine Svankamjer's sensibilities with Joseph Cornell's supply closet. In image creation, Barta melds live action with flip-books (or something close), stop animation, overdrawing, and I don't know what-all in computer animation and postproduction. The stop-animated puppets, however, embody unique personalities in their materials, structure, and articulation, even before you hear them speak,Skipping ahead, I have to applaud the English language rendering. Taken in itself, it expresses the characters and helps bring them to life, even though English was never considered when the movie's original Czech version came out. But, the English is dubbed so it syncs to Czech mouth movements (mostly). This involved heroics on the parts of the scriptwriters, voice actors, and sound masters to create some cadence that a lip-reader might believe.Backing up to the original, though, this represents a rather daring fable of personal freedom against the militarists, something Barta lived through before the Velvet Revolution. The plaster talking head had some reality in the Stalin era, and the spies and operatives remained real until the Stasi got their pink slips.Behind and in front of everything else, though, this stands out as a major artwork, masterfully crafted and carrying more meaning than any one reading can disclose. I've admired Barta's art before. This, however, impresses me in more different ways than I can hope to name.-- wiredweird",5,Awesome!,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1932,"['mean', 'really', 'stand', 'awe.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'was', 'Jiri', 'pronounced', 'kind', 'Year-zhee', 'Barta', 'would', 'have', 'sold', 'right', 'then', 'CzechanimatorsandBartain', 'particular', 'display', 'senses', 'macabre', 'joyous', 'heroic', 'delicate', 'mysterious', 'once', 'so', 'many', 'worked', 'tried', 'Soviet', 'oppression', 'rather', 'natural', 'brilliant', 'work', 'art', 'many', 'levels', 'Physically', 'puppets', 'objects', 'combine', 'Svankamjer', 'sensibilities', 'Joseph', 'Cornell', 'supply', 'closet', 'image', 'creation', 'Barta', 'melds', 'live', 'action', 'flip-books', 'something', 'close', 'stop', 'animation', 'overdrawing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what-all', 'computer', 'animation', 'postproduction', 'stop-animated', 'puppets', 'however', 'embody', 'unique', 'personalities', 'materials', 'structure', 'articulation', 'even', 'hear', 'speak', 'Skipping', 'ahead', 'have', 'applaud', 'English', 'language', 'rendering', 'Taken', 'characters', 'bring', 'life', 'even', 'English', 'was', 'never', 'considered', 'when', 'movie', 'original', 'Czech', 'version', 'came', 'out', 'English', 'dubbed', 'Czech', 'mouth', 'movements', 'mostly', 'involved', 'heroics', 'parts', 'scriptwriters', 'voice', 'actors', 'sound', 'masters', 'create', 'cadence', 'lip-reader', 'might', 'believe.Backing', 'up', 'original', 'though', 'rather', 'daring', 'fable', 'personal', 'freedom', 'militarists', 'something', 'Barta', 'lived', 'Velvet', 'Revolution', 'plaster', 'talking', 'head', 'had', 'reality', 'Stalin', 'era', 'spies', 'operatives', 'remained', 'real', 'Stasi', 'got', 'pink', 'slips.Behind', 'front', 'everything', 'else', 'though', 'out', 'major', 'artwork', 'masterfully', 'crafted', 'carrying', 'more', 'meaning', 'one', 'reading', 'can', 'disclose', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'Barta', 'art', 'however', 'impresses', 'more', 'different', 'ways', 'can', 'hope', 'wiredweird']",Toys in the Attic
