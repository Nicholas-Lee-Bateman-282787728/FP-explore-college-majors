It was amazing watching it and hearing the response of the Bethel Church audience.This film was of special interest to me because I am a substance abuse counselor and I'm always looking for material to show my clients to increase their faith in a God that love's them with love unimaginable. I eventually showed it to some of my clients who were blown away, encouraged and stretched by some of the stories on this film.
