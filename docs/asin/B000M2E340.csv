It's sad to say, but it seems that the best classic Scooby-Doo episodes are contained in the First and Second seasons.  Some of the Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt episodes are okay, too.  These ones?  HORRIBLE.  The monsters are stupid, the plots are lame, the mysteries are hardly mysteries at all.  And somehow, even though the gang travels overseas in most of these, there they are in the Mystery Machine.  So they drove across the ocean somehow.  I mean, yes it's a cartoon, but the first and second season at least followed some semblance of logic.My advice?  Get this for free at a garage sale or not at all.  Or let young kids who don't know any better watch it.  I certainly didn't care when I was a kid.  Now?

This is actually the third season of ""The Scooby Doo Show"" which ran from 1976-1978. This is NOT Season 3 of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"". There never was a season 3. However, these episodes were the unofficial third season of ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!""(at least, in Hanna-Barbera's minds, anyways) which used the Original Series' 1969 opening intro/title & credits during its' original airing on TV.

Hivner ""Jack Lantern""","[0, 0]","Since the others have already listed the episodes included in this set (and it's also listed in the item description), I won't go over it again.For anyone that's a fan of the old show, it's an excellent buy.  The episodes here offer more than one ""suspect"" in each case, which can't often be said of the first two seasons.  Some of the episodes found here are as classic as the earlier shows of Scooby-Doo.  You won't be disappointed.However, some episodes made during this time are mysteriously missing. There are even clips in the opening credits of episodes that are nowhere to be found in this set (like the 10,000-Volt Ghost).  The Gator Ghoul, the Headless Horseman and the gang's band friends that disappear leaving only voodoo dolls behind, are among some of my very favorite episodes.  Just know you won't find them here.The only other problem seems to be with the DVD's themselves.  The set is packaged on two DVD's: one on a single, and the second is a two-sided disc.  It looks a bit odd when you open the package, as if the set was simply slapped together.  But the double-sided disc has often proven to be a problem with some DVD players, as seek times (laser finding the information) is a bit longer.  When inserting the two-sided disc, my DVD player found the info, but it took a few seconds longer to load up.Overall, this set is definitely worth it, but if there are a few classic episodes you were hoping to find, read over the episode list first, as they may not be there.",4,"Not Perfect, But Pretty Good",1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,1492,"['others', 'have', 'already', 'listed', 'episodes', 'included', 'set', 'also', 'listed', 'item', 'description', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'anyone', 'fan', 'old', 'show', 'excellent', 'buy', 'episodes', 'here', 'offer', 'more', 'one', 'suspect', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'often', 'be', 'said', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'found', 'here', 'are', 'as', 'classic', 'earlier', 'shows', 'Scooby-Doo', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.However', 'episodes', 'made', 'time', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'missing', 'are', 'even', 'clips', 'opening', 'credits', 'episodes', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'set', '10,000-Volt', 'Ghost', 'Gator', 'Ghoul', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'gang', 'band', 'disappear', 'leaving', 'only', 'voodoo', 'dolls', 'are', 'very', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Just', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'only', 'other', 'problem', 'be', 'DVD', 'set', 'packaged', 'two', 'DVD', 'one', 'single', 'second', 'two-sided', 'disc', 'bit', 'odd', 'when', 'open', 'package', 'set', 'was', 'simply', 'slapped', 'together', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'often', 'proven', 'be', 'problem', 'DVD', 'players', 'seek', 'times', 'laser', 'finding', 'information', 'bit', 'longer', 'When', 'inserting', 'two-sided', 'disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'found', 'info', 'took', 'few', 'seconds', 'longer', 'load', 'up.Overall', 'set', 'definitely', 'worth', 'are', 'few', 'classic', 'episodes', 'were', 'hoping', 'find', 'read', 'episode', 'list', 'first', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'there']","SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?

Fortunately in this DVD collection, he's still nowhere to be found. Having ordered this set along with the first 2 seasons at a great price was well worth it. Since hearing about the problems with the Season 3 discs from friends and fellow Scooby fans who had bought this collection, decided to watch these discs first and then commence watching seasons 1 and 2. To my enjoyment no such problems with repeat episodes were to be found in my purchased set. The discs played perfectly and all episodes mentioned on the inside cover are there intact, hopefully this means the problems were fixed.

Titled SCOOBY'S ALL STARS, this particular set of cartoons shows the Mystery Inc. gang in standard form: Fred with the ascot, Daphne in a purple dress, Velma in an orange sweatshirt and red mini-skirt, and Shaggy in a t-shirt and brown pants, all of them instantly recognizable. Unfortunately, nothing in this group of cartoons is up to the level of the originals.The first series was sloppy at times, with the characters inconsistently drawn--one episode shows Velma with lipstick and freckles; another shows Fred with such a square jaw it looks like he could glass with the corners of it; and so on. But even so, the shows had a specific look and style, especially in terms of background art. SCOOBY'S ALL STARS are more consistent, but they aren't nearly as interesting in terms of art or animation, and the stories have a very loose quality and lots of comic filler. The episodes are watchable, at times even enjoyable, but if this were the only cartoons made, the series wouldn't be nearly so fondly recalled.On the plus side, the elements are good, and this three disk collection includes a half-hour documentary on Hanna-Barbera. It doesn't offer much insight into Scooby-Doo and the gang, and one interviewer comments that Scooby-Doo was partly inspired by the t.v. series THE MOD SQUAD--which doesn't seem too likely given that THE MOD SQUAD and the original SCOOBY-DOO hit television screens at about the same time. Nonetheless, it offers interesting insight into the animation studio and it is a nice compliment to this otherwise ho-hom set. Recommended for hardcore fans, but others should probably leave it alone.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Mrs. Marie Madden",3,Hang Around for Scooby Doo,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,1982,"['Inspired', 'such', 'diverse', 'material', 'radio', '34', 'Love', 'Mystery', '34', 'television', '34', 'Many', 'Loves', 'Dobie', 'Gillis', '34', 'cartoon', 'series', 'SCOOBY-DOO', 'WHERE', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'was', 'smash', 'hit', 'CBS', 'late', '1960s', 'running', 'original', 'cartoons', 'ground', 'network', 'ordered', 'new', 'set', 'Titled', 'SCOOBY', 'ALL', 'STARS', 'particular', 'set', 'cartoons', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'gang', 'standard', 'form', 'Fred', 'ascot', 'Daphne', 'purple', 'dress', 'Velma', 'orange', 'sweatshirt', 'red', 'mini-skirt', 'Shaggy', 't-shirt', 'brown', 'pants', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Unfortunately', 'nothing', 'group', 'cartoons', 'level', 'originals.The', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'sloppy', 'times', 'characters', 'inconsistently', 'drawn', 'one', 'episode', 'Velma', 'lipstick', 'freckles', 'shows', 'Fred', 'square', 'jaw', 'could', 'glass', 'corners', 'so', 'even', 'so', 'shows', 'had', 'specific', 'look', 'style', 'especially', 'terms', 'background', 'art', 'SCOOBY', 'ALL', 'STARS', 'are', 'more', 'consistent', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'terms', 'art', 'animation', 'stories', 'have', 'very', 'loose', 'quality', 'lots', 'comic', 'filler', 'episodes', 'are', 'watchable', 'times', 'even', 'enjoyable', 'were', 'only', 'cartoons', 'made', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'so', 'fondly', 'recalled.On', 'plus', 'side', 'elements', 'are', 'good', 'three', 'disk', 'collection', 'half-hour', 'documentary', 'Hanna-Barbera', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'insight', 'Scooby-Doo', 'gang', 'one', 'interviewer', 'comments', 'Scooby-Doo', 'was', 'partly', 'inspired', 't.v', 'series', 'THE', 'MOD', 'SQUAD', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'likely', 'given', 'THE', 'MOD', 'SQUAD', 'original', 'SCOOBY-DOO', 'hit', 'television', 'screens', 'same', 'time', 'Nonetheless', 'interesting', 'insight', 'animation', 'studio', 'nice', 'compliment', 'otherwise', 'ho-hom', 'set', 'Recommended', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'others', 'should', 'probably', 'leave', 'alone.GFT', 'Amazon', 'ReviewerIn', 'Memory', 'Mrs.', 'Marie', 'Madden']","SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?

The 3rd Season of Scooby-Doo, Where are you is actually part of what was called Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics which featured several cartoons including ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" and ""The Blue Falcon & Dynomutt"" (who you might recognize from Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law) between 1977-1978. Even though this series aired years after the Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, which is apparently considered a different series. Confused yet?This season features all the usual unlikely villians, utterly ludicrous last-minute plot explanations and borderline xenophobic cultural stereotypes. The Scooby-Doo formula works best in isolated, creepy surroundings, but this season puts the action into too many urban areas, which just don't seem right. Monsters appearing during a Wimbledon tennis match and in a recording studio are the lowest points of the season.The back of the box promotes the Season as ""lost episodes"". Well, I'm not sure where they were lost about but judging by the shocking quality of the prints I assume they were stored in someone's garage behind some old paint cans and a bag of cement gone hard.

It contains none of the Scooby Dum episodes (Gator Ghoul, Headless Horseman, Vampire Hotel) and doesn't have the 10,000 volt ghost episode, despite these episodes being shown in the opening credits/song for every episode on the DVD's.  I assume that they'll be a season four coming out soon, but I'd have gladly paid more for all the All Star episodes in one collection.

1042090,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B000M2E340,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[2, 2]","Freddy, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and of course everyone's favorite talking dog Scooby Doo are back in this third season of Scooby Doo, Where Are You?, which is actually 16 episodes of The Scooby Doo Show which aired in the later part of the 70's. Unlike the first two seasons of Where Are You?, this show has Scoob and the gang trying to solve mysteries in a variety of new settings, like Japan, the mountains, even England.Some fans didn't care for this new setting and I admit some aren't as good as the previous seasons, but that still doesn't take away from the classic feel of one of the all time goofiest and funniest cartoons around. I do admit I was not a fan of the added characters like Scoody Dum and Scrappy Doo, but thankfully they aren't featured a ton.Disc 1-Watch Out! The Willawaw: Here the gang is traveling by boat to visit Velma's uncle when they encounter a giant owl known as the Willawaw, so they try to find out what is behind the mysterious and screechy creature. Not a bad episode here.-A Creepy Tangle In The Bermuda Triangle: Near the Bermuda Triangle the gang is on a boat partying, a storm hits damaging their boat, then they see the spaceship trap a weather plane, their boat crash lands on an island and they go to investigate the reasoning behind spaceships appearance. Decent one here.-A Scary Night With A Snow Beast Fright: There's a giant snow creature/dinosaur that is wreaking havoc in the North Pole, which prompts the gang to come up and solve the mystery. Its a funny one at times and had some throwbacks to the other series, like Scooby and Shaggy dressing up to confuse the monster and the classic ""Meddling kids"" line is used.-To Switch A Witch: On Halloween in the town of Old Salem a witch rises from the dead to terrorize the townsfolk, of course the kids and Scooby are coming to town visiting a friend that people claim is the witch. Looks like they must do their best to clear her name and capture the witch. Good one here.-The Tar Monster: Up in the Turkish Mountains Scoob and Co. are visiting a professor who discovered an ancient city, so naturally scientific find brings a tar monster that tries to run off everyone, so its another mystery to be solved. Good one here.-A Highland Fling With A Monstrous Thing: In Scotland, a friend of Velma's calls her to enlist her help in finding out the meaning behind an old highlander ghost and even the Lochness Monster appearing and running off the tourists of a castle she works at. Decent one hereDisc 2-Side A-The Creepy Case Of Old Iron Face: While on a speed boat ride, the gang is chased by a man in a mask riding metal sharks, they get to the beach and find out about the legend of Skull Island and about the iron clad man they say earlier. Its an ok one.-Jeepers, Its The Jaguaro!: In Brazil, their plane has to make an emergency landing in the jungles of the dreaded Jaguaro creature. So after Scooby and Shaggy run into it and with some headhunters after them, the natural plan is solve the mystery of the monster. This is an odd one to say the least.-Make A Beeline Away From The Feline: Daphne's aunt transforms into a cat creature and is stealing jewelry for some reason, so once Scoob and his pals see this they try to find out why, clear the aunt's name and capture the culprit. Its a good one.-The Creepy Creature of Vulture's Claw: On the way to visit a professor friend of Velma's the gang stumbles upon a mystery involving a weird mantis like creature. There's also a real estate agent who wants Velma's friend to sell his property to him, so guess what there's another investigation into the monster's motives. Not a bad one.Disc 2-Side B-The Diabolical Disc Demon: There's a weird phantom in a disco suit and kiss makeup that causes  the disappearance of a song writer, then the equipment in the studio malfunctions. So yet again the gang investigates the mystery of this phantom and try to find the missing song writer. An odd one.-Scooby's Chinese Fortune Kooky Caper: While in China, the mystery machine gets a flat tire and the gang looks to stay the night at an old city inn when above all things a moon monster appears. So everyone tries to find out the meaning behind this creature. A decent one here. Side Note: If you don't laugh at the names of the people and the city they stay in then you're better than me, cause I kept laughing throughout.-A Menace In Venice: In Italy (like the title didn't give that away), the gang is in town visiting a friend when they learn of a jewel thief named ""The Ghostly Gondolier"" and go on the search for clues to bust the criminal. A good one here.-Don't Go Near The Fortress Of Fear: At a port in Puerto Rico they discover there's apparently some missing treasure that leads to an old fortress haunted by a ghost of an old general who likes to shoot of a cannon in the fortress. Well naturally Fred, Daphne and Velma are curious to explore while Shaggy and Scooby reluctantly join. A good one here.-The Warlock Of Wimbledon: While on a run, two englishmen run into a goofy looking warlock who curses a tennis star to suffer a terrible fate. Once the gang runs into the tennis guy they decide to investigate this warlock curse. Good one here.-The Beast Is Awake In Bottomless Lake: After taking a detour to avoid a flooded road, the gang ends up in Canada and finds out there's a beast at a camp resort (as if the title wasn't obvious enough). So after finding the resort deserted they decide to see whats behind this monster and the empty resort. Good one here.The only special feature is a Q&A; session where we find out how the artists and animators of the show reach each other internationally and how they manage to connect with the fans of the series.Its an enjoyable collection of episodes, its not as good as the previous dvd set of Where Are You? but as a stand alone set its good and worth having in your library.",5,"Whats ""lost"" is

I have been  a Scooby doo fan for quite some time. i think i have seen all of the  different incarnations of him by now. I just love the series. It is the perfect thing to watch when you want something silly with just a hint of mystery. The gang never gets old.This time around they are  on the go. They hit up  Venice, China (or Japan), New York, and various other places. Is there any place that  the Mystery  Machine can't go?Well this season had several episodes that were quite familiar to me. For instance the make a Beeline away from The Feline. I remember watching that episode  growing up and being  kind of afraid. It is also one of my  favorite epsidoes. I rememebered the tennis episode where the warlock showed up. Is it me  or was the  whole ""invisible make up""  thing kind of a strectch. lolI also enjoy the "" To Swith a Witch"", ""Old Iron Face"" and ""The Disc Denom"". The one about the creature in vulture's claw was  pretty good too. It was one of my favorites! I also was kind of creeped out  by the giant bug looking thing in this episode. All in all a great season i feel. there were only a few i didn't really like.  One of those being the  Jaguro episode. The stupid sound of the beast  drove me crazy. They  couldn't  found something that was a bit less annoying. That sound alone made me hate this one.I think this is a good buy and I look  forward to purchasing more epsiodes.I also found the sound annoying on the willawa episode. I really would have liked this episode more if it had less of that screeching owl.I don't want to  forget the classic Tar Monster episode is also in this collection.

1042104,A1RH5H3A992GC9,B000M2E340,Penny,"[1, 1]","Some people like Scooby Doo, Where Are You seasons 1 and 2 because these episodes show the original campy yet not too creepy format. I love those, too, but even when I was a little kid I preferred the later, creepier episodes. The kind I could watch in a darkened room with delicious chills. Perhaps I love them even more because they are considered 'lost' episodes. I rarely saw them after the early 80's. The labeling of later episodes by season is certainly confusing, and it is appreciated that some reviewers have clarified things by categorizing the episodes. I had not read anything about 'Season 3' before finding it in a store, and was just thrilled because it would surely have all my favorite lost episodes on it. (It doesn't, but many of them are included). Most of us fans refer to an episode by its villain, and this DVD has some great ones: the Cat Creature, Old Iron Face, the Tar Monster,  the Highland Ghost and Loch Ness Monster, and a recording studio phantom that looks like a bad version of Paul Stanley in stage makeup. There are a few mediocre episodes, and this is only because of lackluster villains. The gang tends to travel abroad a lot, creating possibilities besides conventional haunted houses. I think Velma's 'new' voice is still nerdy and fine, just lower pitched, and I like Daphne's second voice better than her first. It's still just a gang of five; cousin Dum doesn't join until later seasons. This DVD is a worthwhile addition for hardcore Scooby fans. NOTE: You will NOT find other obscure favorites like the Demon Shark, Gator Ghoul, No-Face Zombie, or Ice-Cream Phantoms in this collection. They are on the Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour Complete Series DVD, which is really great. And you won't find the Viking Ghosts or that awesome funeral parlor vampire episode either; they're considered episodes of the Scooby Doo Show. My only gripe about the Season 3 DVD is its packaging; I think all episodes should be listed on the outside cover. Some Scooby fans will spot it in stores before doing an online search!",4,depends which Scooby 'era' you prefer...,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,2047,"['people', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'episodes', 'show', 'original', 'campy', 'yet', 'not', 'too', 'creepy', 'format', 'love', 'too', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'preferred', 'later', 'creepier', 'episodes', 'kind', 'could', 'watch', 'darkened', 'room', 'delicious', 'chills', 'Perhaps', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'considered', ""'lost"", 'episodes', 'rarely', 'saw', 'early', '80', 'labeling', 'later', 'episodes', 'season', 'certainly', 'confusing', 'appreciated', 'reviewers', 'have', 'clarified', 'things', 'categorizing', 'episodes', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'anything', '3', 'finding', 'store', 'was', 'just', 'thrilled', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'favorite', 'lost', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'many', 'are', 'included', 'Most', 'fans', 'refer', 'episode', 'villain', 'DVD', 'great', 'ones', 'Cat', 'Creature', 'Old', 'Iron', 'Face', 'Tar', 'Monster', 'Highland', 'Ghost', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster', 'recording', 'studio', 'phantom', 'bad', 'version', 'Paul', 'Stanley', 'stage', 'makeup', 'are', 'few', 'mediocre', 'episodes', 'only', 'lackluster', 'villains', 'gang', 'travel', 'abroad', 'lot', 'creating', 'possibilities', 'conventional', 'haunted', 'houses', 'think', 'Velma', ""'new"", 'voice', 'still', 'nerdy', 'fine', 'just', 'lower', 'pitched', 'like', 'Daphne', 'second', 'voice', 'better', 'first', 'still', 'just', 'gang', 'five', 'cousin', 'Dum', ""n't"", 'join', 'later', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'hardcore', 'Scooby', 'fans', 'NOTE', 'will', 'NOT', 'find', 'other', 'obscure', 'favorites', 'Demon', 'Shark', 'Gator', 'Ghoul', 'No-Face', 'Zombie', 'Ice-Cream', 'Phantoms', 'collection', 'are', 'Scooby', 'Doo/Dynomutt', 'Hour', 'Complete', 'Series', 'DVD', 'really', 'great', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Viking', 'Ghosts', 'awesome', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'vampire', 'episode', ""'re"", 'considered', 'episodes', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Show', 'only', 'gripe', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'think', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'listed', 'outside', 'cover', 'Scooby', 'fans', 'will', 'spot', 'stores', 'doing', 'online', 'search']","SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?

The first and second seasons provided some great ideas and villains, and have become classics for good reason. Those were followed by a brief period of Scooby Doo movies, and after a brief hiatus, the Scooby Doo show from 1976-77, which contained some great episodes as well. By the time 1978 rolled around, it was becoming apparent that the writers were simply running out of ideas for villains. Villains such as the Willawaw, the Tar Monster, the Diabolical Disc Demon and the Jaguaro simply don't resonate as well as those classic villains from 1969-70. However, let me make one thing clear: the 16 episodes on this two disc set aren't bad at all--just not what I consider classic material.
