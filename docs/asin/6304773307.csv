Well, except for when Craig Chester is onscreen. Nick Scotti is good eye candy though, and he's often shirtless. The music is probably the best thing about Kiss Me Guido.

No.  Is the acting the best you've ever seen?  No.  Is it fun and entertaining?  YES!Some movies aren't made with Oscar in mind, and this is one of those.  It's fun, light-hearted, simplistic, but so very enjoyable.  I won't go into plotlines, as other reviewers have already done that.  Suffice to say this movie will entertain you and make you smile.The DVD picture is crisp and clear and the audio is perfect: not too loud, not too soft (there's nothing worse than not being able to hear the dialog only to have the house rattle once the music booms in).  The widescreen format really suits this film.  The only downside to this DVD release --and a minor one at that-- is the commentary by director Tony Vitale.  It's incredibly boring with l-o-n-g moments of silence.  There are a couple of interesting tidbits here and there, but nothing deep or earth-shattering.  A bit of rehearsal on Tony's part would have helped this tremendously because he sounds bored at times.  But I won't judge this feature too harshly since it's not part of the original movie per se.If you're looking for a pleasant movie to share with friends (gay or hetero), you've found it here.",5,"NOT AN OSCAR WINNER, BUT A WHOLE LOTTA FUN!",986515200,"04 6, 2001",2001,1287,"['Let', 'get', 'basics', 'way', 'quickly', 'quot', 'politically', 'correct', 'quot', 'script', 'Oscar-worthy', 'No', 'acting', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'YES', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'Oscar', 'mind', 'one', 'fun', 'light-hearted', 'simplistic', 'so', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plotlines', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'will', 'entertain', 'make', 'smile.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'crisp', 'clear', 'audio', 'perfect', 'not', 'too', 'loud', 'not', 'too', 'soft', 'nothing', 'worse', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'hear', 'dialog', 'only', 'have', 'house', 'rattle', 'music', 'booms', 'widescreen', 'format', 'really', 'suits', 'film', 'only', 'downside', 'DVD', 'release', 'minor', 'one', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tony', 'Vitale', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'l-o-n-g', 'moments', 'silence', 'are', 'couple', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'here', 'there', 'nothing', 'deep', 'earth-shattering', 'bit', 'rehearsal', 'Tony', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'bored', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'judge', 'feature', 'too', 'harshly', 'not', 'part', 'original', 'movie', 'se.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'share', 'friends', 'gay', 'hetero', ""'ve"", 'found', 'here']",Kiss Me Guido VHS

It refers to a straight Italian male, which in the gay community is not a real cool thing to be. This is a very good film about a straight guy who moves in with a gay roommate not knowing what he's really getting into. There are a lot of surprises ahead for Frankie Zito (Nick Scotti) who is searching to find a life of his own away from his Italian family. Frankie is an aspiring actor but must decide how willing he is to pay his dues to get there. This is the debut performance for Scotti who does a marvelous job portraying his character. I would love to see more from this actor who obviously decided not to persue an acting career. The casting and quality in this film is very good. Christopher Lawford and the guy who plays his new lover are the weak performances in my opinion. The rest of the cast is pretty good, especially Nick Scotti and Anthony Barrile. There are also some good extras included on the DVD, such as the commentary option you should enable for your second run through of this movie. It gives some great background on the making of the film and showcases some of the visual effects used. The commentary is done by filmmaker Tony Vitale. I felt the plot could have used a little more pizazz and I was a little disappointed that they stopped short of the films potential. I would however recommend it.

It stars Nick Scotti (Bullet, Detroit Rock City) as a straight Italian lover who thinks an add with GWM in it means `Guy With Money' instead of what it really means which is `Gay White Male'.He then befriends this gay man looking for a roommate to help paying bills played by Anthony Barrile (Sinatra, Hamburger Hill) who has an ex-lover (Played by Craig Chester (Frisk, Bumping Heads)  )who has a new boyfriend actor (Played by Christopher Lawford (Exit Wounds, Thirteen Days) ) who is about to put on a play production.Guido is an actor who has no talent in the people skills area but seems to have a natural affinity for `gay' acting roles until he realizes he must, and has to, kiss a man. The rest is pure comedy. From the straight laced strict Catholic Italian families of New York to the stereo typical `Queens' of gay New York CityThe movie made me chuckle and chuckle many times. Cleverly directed by Tony Vitale (Very Mean Men, Jungle Juice) the films makes you believe anything is possible.

I rented it from the public library, and this is definately one of the films I would purchase on DVD or VHS, since I enjoyed it so much!You can especially appreciate it if you live in the Brooklyn/Manhattan area of New York City, because Guidos listening to 103.5 KTU are a pure staple of our local society. :)One thing that's very attractive about this film is a distinct plot conflict between characters, which is eventually resolved at the end of the film, as all characters find that they need and want each other, whether they're the manhating Meryll, the homophobic Frankie, the abused gay lover Warren, or even Pino the player getting in touch with his monogamous side. It wasn't offensive, nor did it insult the viewer's intelligence, as the story kept moving along at a brisk and very interesting pace.Plenty of laughs for all, particularly if you're from this region and see what lunacy goes on around here. :)",5,Hey Kiss This! hehe :-D,994204800,"07 4, 2001",2001,949,"['fun', 'movie', 'rented', 'public', 'library', 'definately', 'one', 'films', 'would', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'live', 'Brooklyn/Manhattan', 'area', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Guidos', 'listening', '103.5', 'KTU', 'are', 'pure', 'staple', 'local', 'society', 'One', 'thing', 'very', 'attractive', 'film', 'distinct', 'plot', 'conflict', 'characters', 'eventually', 'resolved', 'end', 'film', 'characters', 'find', 'need', 'want', 'other', ""'re"", 'manhating', 'Meryll', 'homophobic', 'Frankie', 'abused', 'gay', 'lover', 'Warren', 'even', 'Pino', 'player', 'getting', 'touch', 'monogamous', 'side', 'was', ""n't"", 'offensive', 'did', 'insult', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'story', 'kept', 'moving', 'along', 'brisk', 'very', 'interesting', 'pace.Plenty', 'laughs', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'region', 'see', 'what', 'lunacy', 'here']",Kiss Me Guido VHS

The plot is reminiscent of the screwball comedies of old, with misunderstandings and double entendres bouncing all over the place, with the difference that what would have been a winking gay subtext in the past is now (of course) front and center.I think the script could have delved more deeply into the friendship between Warren and Frankie and how they become more comfortable with each other -- as it stands, it's like there's no second act. But Nick Scotti does a great job as Frankie and proves to be physically perfect for the role. (I'm not so sure that Anthony Barille completely passes as gay, though.)This is a great movie for a rainy afternoon or a casual evening at home with friends. My only question is why Nick Scotti didn't go on to make several more movies ... he's got real screen presence and excellent comic timing.Look for director Tony Vitale in two scenes, playing a wise-cracking pizzeria customer.",4,A solid four stars,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,1005,"['Not', 'remotely', 'believable', 'even', 'second', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'reminiscent', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'old', 'misunderstandings', 'double', 'entendres', 'bouncing', 'place', 'difference', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'winking', 'gay', 'subtext', 'past', 'now', 'course', 'front', 'center.I', 'think', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'delved', 'more', 'deeply', 'friendship', 'Warren', 'Frankie', 'how', 'become', 'more', 'comfortable', 'other', 'second', 'act', 'Nick', 'Scotti', 'great', 'job', 'Frankie', 'be', 'physically', 'perfect', 'role', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Anthony', 'Barille', 'completely', 'gay', 'though', 'great', 'movie', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'casual', 'evening', 'home', 'friends', 'only', 'question', 'why', 'Nick', 'Scotti', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'make', 'several', 'more', 'movies', 'got', 'real', 'screen', 'presence', 'excellent', 'comic', 'timing.Look', 'director', 'Tony', 'Vitale', 'two', 'scenes', 'playing', 'wise-cracking', 'pizzeria', 'customer']",Kiss Me Guido VHS
