1326330,A39CLUEZN0XIPY,B0035FTPZ8,David Parker,"[5, 6]","Back in the 70's, there were actually good made-for-TV movies, and this is one of the best. I've waited for years to upgrade from my fuzzy VHS tape (recorded from a TV source), but unfortunately, Warner Bros. is sticking it to the fans with their 'Archive Collection' overpricing, so I'll pass. Still, this Richard Matheson story is a taut, well-acted and suspenseful little flick, and a precursor to many other similarly-themed movies, most particularly Kurt Russell's excellent ""Breakdown"". A perfect cast, featuring the great Dabney Coleman, a subdued and terrified Cloris Leachman, along with the always-dependable Ned Beatty, and an against-type Ross Martin (Artemus Gordon from the ""Wild Wild West"" series) as a very bad guy, makes this above-average TV fare, right up there with Spielberg's ""Duel"", which was also an ABC movie-of-the-week. Maybe Netflix will pony up and pick up a few copies of this fine little thriller. But, the fact that they even released this on DVD means it's at least available for those who don't mind the price. Now if they would only release Patty Duke's ""You'll like my mother""!!",5,"Great classic, bad price!",1277337600,"06 24, 2010",2010,1114,"['Back', '70', 'were', 'actually', 'good', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'years', 'upgrade', 'fuzzy', 'VHS', 'tape', 'recorded', 'TV', 'source', 'unfortunately', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'sticking', 'fans', ""'Archive"", 'Collection', 'overpricing', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'Still', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'story', 'taut', 'well-acted', 'suspenseful', 'little', 'flick', 'precursor', 'many', 'other', 'similarly-themed', 'movies', 'most', 'particularly', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'excellent', 'Breakdown', 'perfect', 'cast', 'featuring', 'great', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'subdued', 'terrified', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'always-dependable', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'against-type', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'Artemus', 'Gordon', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'series', 'very', 'bad', 'guy', 'above-average', 'TV', 'fare', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Spielberg', 'Duel', 'was', 'also', 'ABC', 'movie-of-the-week', 'Maybe', 'Netflix', 'will', 'pony', 'up', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'copies', 'fine', 'little', 'thriller', 'fact', 'even', 'released', 'DVD', 'least', 'available', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'price', 'Now', 'would', 'only', 'release', 'Patty', 'Duke', ""'ll"", 'like', 'mother']",N/A
1326331,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0035FTPZ8,Kasey G,"[1, 2]","I agree with the first reviewer that this title is overpriced, but you can find it cheaper like I did, if you use other online resources. I am grateful however for Warner's for finally making this film available. Their M-O-D program is great for those rare titles that would otherwise be unavailable to the general public. The picture quality is as good as any factory-pressed DVD.Besides the 1984 mini-series ""Lace"", this was the only title I was very eager to own, since I had heard good things about this film and always wanted to see it. While it is not anything outstanding, Cloris Leachman fans will want to get this to see her in her prime, doing something besides playing Phyllis Lindstrom. Speaking of Phyllis, Cloris wears a pair of white pants in this movie and there's a scene where she's being chased through the woods and it reminds me of the opening credits of ""Phyllis"" as she runs to jump on the cable car!The script itself is kind of muddled and we never really get a clear understanding of why the Ned Beatty and Russ Martin characters are so hostile. Louise Latham provides stable support as always, but was sadly underused, as was Dabney Coleman. He and Cloris have great chemistry in the early scenes as a bickering couple on vacation who's frustrations escalate. When they stop at a run-down diner in the desert to take a breather, Coleman's character seems to disappear into thin air and Cloris spends the rest of the movie trying to found out what happened to him, while the unfriendly locals have her questioning her own sanity.An above-average but not great '70s TV movie that survives on the strength of Leachman's performance.

1326332,ANMAEMCHWTH6R,B0035FTPZ8,"Robert F. Spera ""The Jaybird""","[1, 1]",This was a made-for-TV movie from back in the 1970's.  They don't make these type films anymore and it is a shame because this was one of the best mystery movies.  The cast is superb and the acting is wonderful.  Nice guy Ned Beatty acting as a tough guy is worth watching.  The plot is interesting because not until the very end you see why the characters were behaving the way they were in not helping Cloris Leachman's character. It all comes together at the end.  And it may seem to plod along until the end whereas a lot of action happens spontanously.  Good film.Worth the price.  Buy this and stay home and watch it.

1326333,A3PZ0H4BMZOFRT,B0035FTPZ8,ShowBizBuff,"[0, 0]","I had the good fortune to be a young kid in the 1970's, when TV-movies had real bite.  Cheesy as some of them may seem now, 70's made-for-TV thrillers like 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark', ""Five Desperate Women', ""Satan's School for Girls', 'Trilogy of Terror', 'The Spell', 'Killer Bees' and others creeped you the hell out when you first watched them ... and 40-odd years later, some of them still have that power today (just check out some of the reviews, here on Amazon, of the above titles!), and withOUT having the extreme gore or violence that so many makers of thrillers seem to feel is necessary for today's films (made-for-TV or otherwise).'Dying Room Only' was a personal favorite of mine, an hours and a half (with commericals) of nail-biting suspense made 100% real by the presence of the pretty-much-can-do-no-wrong Cloris Leachman.Here, as Jean Mitchell, she plays an upper middle class woman who, on a trip along with her husband, stops at a diner in the dessert for a quick bite to eat before hitting the highway again.  When her husband decides to make a quick trip to the bathroom and never comes back, things get freaky VERY fast when the guy running the diner not only insists he never saw her husband, but that in fact when Jean came into the diner she was completely alone.Something is seriously wrong when no one will admit to having seen her husband, and even as Jean's sanity is questioned WE (the viewers) are with Jean all the way; as she looks more into the mystery, trying to find her husband, both the suspense and Jean's trek into escalating danger will have you on the edge of your seat.  Thanks to Leachman's brilliant work, you will care like HELL about Jean's plight, wanting her to find her husband (hopefully alive), as well as learn just what the hell is going on with these sinister people ... who become increasingly more threatening as the minutes - and Jean's determination - tick on.Leachman is SO freaking great in this, and I didn't even realize until today that this was on DVD; gotta get it.  It's a TV-movie classic the likes of which they don't make anymore - they don't write anymore.  And a performance by Ms. Leachman, beyond Phyllis and 'The Last Picture Show' and Maw Maw, that you aren't soon going to forget.",5,"The brilliance, here, lies in Cloris Leachman",1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2263,"['had', 'good', 'fortune', 'be', 'young', 'kid', '1970', 'when', 'TV-movies', 'had', 'real', 'bite', 'Cheesy', 'may', 'seem', 'now', '70', 'made-for-TV', 'thrillers', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'Five', 'Desperate', 'Women', 'Satan', 'School', 'Girls', ""'Trilogy"", 'Terror', 'Spell', 'Bees', 'others', 'creeped', 'hell', 'out', 'when', 'first', 'watched', '40-odd', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'today', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'above', 'titles', 'having', 'extreme', 'gore', 'violence', 'so', 'many', 'makers', 'thrillers', 'seem', 'feel', 'necessary', 'today', 'films', 'made-for-TV', 'otherwise', ""'Dying"", 'Room', 'Only', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'hours', 'half', 'commericals', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'made', '100', '%', 'real', 'presence', 'pretty-much-can-do-no-wrong', 'Cloris', 'Leachman.Here', 'Jean', 'Mitchell', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'woman', 'who', 'trip', 'husband', 'diner', 'dessert', 'quick', 'bite', 'eat', 'hitting', 'highway', 'again', 'When', 'husband', 'make', 'quick', 'trip', 'bathroom', 'never', 'back', 'things', 'get', 'freaky', 'VERY', 'fast', 'when', 'guy', 'running', 'diner', 'not', 'only', 'never', 'saw', 'husband', 'fact', 'when', 'Jean', 'came', 'diner', 'was', 'completely', 'alone.Something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'when', 'one', 'will', 'admit', 'having', 'seen', 'husband', 'even', 'Jean', 'sanity', 'questioned', 'WE', 'viewers', 'are', 'Jean', 'way', 'more', 'mystery', 'trying', 'find', 'husband', 'suspense', 'Jean', 'trek', 'escalating', 'danger', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'Thanks', 'Leachman', 'brilliant', 'work', 'will', 'care', 'HELL', 'Jean', 'plight', 'wanting', 'find', 'husband', 'hopefully', 'alive', 'as', 'well', 'learn', 'just', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'sinister', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'increasingly', 'more', 'threatening', 'minutes', 'Jean', 'determination', 'tick', 'on.Leachman', 'SO', 'freaking', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'today', 'was', 'DVD', 'got', 'ta', 'get', 'TV-movie', 'classic', 'likes', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'anymore', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Leachman', 'Phyllis', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Maw', 'Maw', 'are', ""n't"", 'soon', 'going', 'forget']",N/A
1326334,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B0035FTPZ8,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[5, 5]","I first saw ""Dying Room Only"" when it was originally released on ABC in September, 1973. I eventually saw it many times again during the seventies as a late-night or early afternoon movie (known here as ""Midday Matinee"" on one of our local channels). So I was very surprised to discover this lost television movie was available on DVD as it hasn't been shown for decades and most TV films never see the light of day on home video releases.The film is extremely good for a television movie from the early seventies. The plot deals with a man and woman who stop at a dingy roadside cafe in Arizona on their way back home to Los Angeles where they encounter some of the locals. They go into the restaurant to have a bite to eat only to discover the people there (low-life trailer trash types) have an issue with people who have class and a bit of money. After coming out of the restroom the woman discovers her husband is missing and it is entirely up to her to find him.The movie is suspenseful, nerve tingling and extremely well written and acted with a cast of some of the best actors from this era. Cloris Leachman, fresh off her Oscar-winning role in ""The Last Picture Show"" and her Emmy-Award winning performance in ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", heads an all-star cast. Dabney Coleman, best known for his work in ""9 to 5"", plays the unfortunate husband while Louise Latham (in a scary performance as the night clerk), Ned Beatty (fresh from doing ""Deliverence"") and Ross Martin do superb work in supporting roles.The movie was produced by Lorimar, known for their impressive work on ""Dallas"" in the eighties.Several years later Cloris and Dabney would work together again in the theatrical remake of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"".",5,"""Nail-biting Suspense""",1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,1728,"['first', 'saw', 'Dying', 'Room', 'Only', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'ABC', 'September', '1973', 'eventually', 'saw', 'many', 'times', 'again', 'seventies', 'late-night', 'early', 'afternoon', 'movie', 'known', 'here', 'Midday', 'Matinee', 'one', 'local', 'channels', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'discover', 'lost', 'television', 'movie', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'been', 'shown', 'decades', 'most', 'TV', 'films', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'home', 'video', 'releases.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'good', 'television', 'movie', 'early', 'seventies', 'plot', 'deals', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'stop', 'dingy', 'roadside', 'cafe', 'Arizona', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'encounter', 'locals', 'go', 'restaurant', 'have', 'bite', 'eat', 'only', 'discover', 'people', 'there', 'low-life', 'trailer', 'trash', 'types', 'have', 'issue', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'class', 'bit', 'money', 'coming', 'out', 'restroom', 'woman', 'husband', 'missing', 'entirely', 'find', 'him.The', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'nerve', 'tingling', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'cast', 'best', 'actors', 'era', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'fresh', 'off', 'Oscar-winning', 'role', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Emmy-Award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'best', 'known', 'work', '9', '5', 'unfortunate', 'husband', 'Louise', 'Latham', 'scary', 'performance', 'night', 'clerk', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'fresh', 'doing', 'Deliverence', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'do', 'superb', 'work', 'supporting', 'roles.The', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'Lorimar', 'known', 'impressive', 'work', 'Dallas', 'eighties.Several', 'years', 'later', 'Cloris', 'Dabney', 'would', 'work', 'together', 'again', 'theatrical', 'remake', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies']",N/A
