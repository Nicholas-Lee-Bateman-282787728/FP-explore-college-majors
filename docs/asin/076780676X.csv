Probably a bit boring for younger children but certainly nothing they &quot;shouldn't&quot; see, just not enough fun stuff.Tess Carlisle's husband dies during his presidential term in office. Shortly thereafter doctors discover she has an inoperable brain tumor; which she chooses to keep knowledge of to herself. (Tess was an integral part in her husband's running of the White House and it's obvious the acting President knew ) Doug knew it too.Her narcissistic son, played by Edward Albert, from whom she gets no real warmth; appears for a short while because he needs her stamp of approval on a big real estate deal he's scheming. The charisma between the two actors, MacLaine and Cage, shows a very obvious love/hate relationship.  Tess wants Doug to continue on as her main &quot;guardian&quot;; whether as punishment or not, I'm not sure.  (Doug constantly receives calls from the President threatening to put the agent &quot;in charge&quot; of the White House dog; if he gives Tess a hard time any more.) Agent and ex-First Lady become like mother and son in a very touching scene at a bar of all places. Doug becomes an integral part in her kidnapping outcome.

He was loyal, protected his secrets and served him steadfastly and while Tess' own children were divorced from the normal family dynamic, she sees Doug as a surrogate son whom her late husband trusted implicitly and Doug is her last link to her late husband, who she still loves despite the fact that he died while entertaining another woman.The movie focuses on their relationship and the depth of care that they develop for each other while bad behavior and some dangerous twists occur, most of them leading to outright guffaws of laughter and some tears.It's one of those sweet movies that has so much going for it that if we don't have it out during our family gatherings for the holidays, people ask for it to be brought out and played.And, while there are a few moments of blue language, it's a great movie for kids as well as grown ups, an all around family classic.",5,"This is a sweet, funny movie that we always watch at holiday gatherings",1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,1542,"['one', 'movies', 'never', 'make', 'laugh', 'shed', 'tear.It', 'relationship', 'Former', 'First', 'Lady', 'Tess', 'played', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'secret', 'service', 'contingent', 'lead', 'Doug', 'Chesny', 'played', 'Nick', 'Cage.She', 'fiesty', 'determined', 'cantankerous', 'when', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'what', 'keep', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Charge', 'Doug', 'side', 'get', 'back', 'thick', 'being', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'instead', 'living', 'life', 'retiree.The', 'secret', 'desire', 'hold', 'Doug', '*spoiler', 'fact', 'so', 'loved', 'Tess', 'late', 'husband', 'who', 'died', 'still', 'serving', 'President', 'was', 'loyal', 'protected', 'secrets', 'served', 'steadfastly', 'Tess', 'own', 'children', 'were', 'divorced', 'normal', 'family', 'dynamic', 'Doug', 'surrogate', 'son', 'whom', 'late', 'husband', 'trusted', 'implicitly', 'Doug', 'last', 'link', 'late', 'husband', 'who', 'still', 'fact', 'died', 'entertaining', 'woman.The', 'movie', 'relationship', 'depth', 'care', 'develop', 'other', 'bad', 'behavior', 'dangerous', 'twists', 'occur', 'most', 'leading', 'outright', 'guffaws', 'laughter', 'tears.It', 'one', 'sweet', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'out', 'family', 'gatherings', 'holidays', 'people', 'ask', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'played.And', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'blue', 'language', 'great', 'movie', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'grown', 'ups', 'family', 'classic']",N/A

8452,AYKELBZM1SH87,076780676X,Erin O'Brien,"[16, 17]","&quot;Guarding Tess&quot; opens with a dapper and cheery Doug Chesnick (Nicholas Cage) fleeing a three-year stint as Special Agent in Charge, United States Secret Service, during which he was responsible for guarding a recently-widowed former First Lady (Shirley MacLaine) in her mansion in rural Ohio.It's not only ditching the rusticity that puts a spring in Chesnick's step, but the opportunity to flee his employer, the authoritarian, aristocratic former First Lady, who has zeroed in on Chesnick while largely ignoring the rest of her staff. Her specialty, one quickly learns, is what the armed forces call the &quot;psy-op&quot; or, more simply, psychological warfare.It is part of Tess Carlisle's modus operandi to let Chesnick believe that he is finally free, and waste to his time reporting to Washington for a new assignment. Chesnick yearns to join the elite who guard the President. Instead, in D.C., Chesnick is told that Carlisle already has called the President to request that Chesnick be reassigned to another three-year &quot;tour&quot;, a tour of a truly martial sort.The current President was the late President Carlisle's Veep, which permits Tess to continue to brusquely address him as the underling he always was to her. Tess's wish is the new President's command, not least because it was her private say that got him the winning Carlisle ticket.In a fury, Chesnick is forced to return to Ohio. A kind of dance of death begins as Tess tries to break the spirit of the Special Agent in Charge, a title she cannot resist deconstructing, while Chesnick's fury mounts and he becomes all the more fanatical about adhering to the strictest (and most deadening) regulations of the Secret Service.It is quickly apparent that Tess Carlisle is vastly too clever and even (almost secretly) high-minded to have summoned Chesnick as a dimwitted mouse to bat around, yet she sincerely loathes his fastidiousness about seatments in cars and the tedium of being followed and observed 24-7. There is no denying the emotional S&amp;M the Tess and Chesnick mete out, but it is curiously bilateral. For reasons unexplained for much of the film, Tess cannot quite afford to have Chesnick quit (or actually quit, more precisely).The power struggles that break out over her attempted use of agents as golf caddies and her recurring jailbreaks with a fearful chauffeur are as uproarious as they are petty.When the humiliated Chesnick is forced &quot;by regulation&quot; to alert the local sheriff, for example, that Tess Carlisle and her driver have lost their detail yet again, the sheriff puts the brokenly dignified agent on speakerphone. The deputies snigger en masse when the Sheriff intones mockingly: &quot;That Mrs. Carlisle sure is slippery...for a senior citizen and all.&quot; Formal as always, Chesnick does not permit himself so much as a note of sarcasm in his response. He communicates in rare tics and elaborate, furious pronunciations of basic instructions, but at no time does he debase his office.Sure enough, Chesnick quits over his inability, courtesy of the eccentric, tantrum-throwing Tess, to do his job &quot;properly&quot; (read: perfectly). And, sure enough, Mrs. Carlisle has the new President on her speed dial.The calls put through from the President, a snarling and barking Texan, are episodes of comic sublimity. Each time, Chesnick, like virtually anyone other than the formidable Mrs. Carlisle, freezes with terror when told via a sudden phone call to &quot;hold for the President&quot;.The disembodied voice, emanating variously from the Oval Office and from Air Force One, is an uncanny, flawless mimicry of LBJ. Johnson's private threats, manipulations and vaunted coarseness are preserved in an inimitable Texan patois which melds obscenity, patriotism, blackmail and phoney good-ole-boy charm.The President is required, for example, to investigate Mrs. Carlisle's story that her agent &quot;ripped up some flowers&quot;. Chesnick speaks carefully about the distinction between fact and fiction: it was only a single flower, and he merely snapped off the bud. Though the President is whipped by the retired Mrs. Carlisle, he is fully alert to the lunacy of how his time is being wasted. The solution? Fix it, Agent Chesnick, &quot;or next time, you'll be guarding my dog, do you hear me son?&quot;When we learn at last of the origin of Tess Carlisle's fixation on Agent Chesnick, it is suitably poignant and ennobling. Rather than trying to break him, as it first appears, she is &quot;merely&quot; trying to get him to break the rules. We see Tess at her bullying worst and then her impossibly gracious best, in two very rare encounters with &quot;her&quot; public.No less a figure than Barbara Bush is said to have told MacLaine that the film was a perfectly accurate rendition of the relationship between agent and protectee. It is very revealing that such a remark should have come from the Grand Dame, Mrs. Bush, who is usually described as being as vicious and petty in private as she is marvellously patrician in public.The gun Chesnick is required to place on a table outside Mrs. Chesnick's room must go off, by the fifth act, according to the rules of drama. It does, and Chesnick's attention to detail is finally rewarded. Rather than &quot;some sick [sexual] thing&quot; going on, as the President earlier, hilariously, suggests, there is a courtly love which unfolds between Tess and her devoted agent which gives a final unity to this first comic, then poignant story.",5,A delightful folie-a-deux between a guard and his First Lady,997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,5520,"['quot', 'Guarding', 'Tess', 'quot', 'dapper',

MacLaine has a difficult personality, and being guarded by Cage, a by-the-books man, causes a lot of friction between the two.  She won't let him be reassigned, yet she seems bent on messing with him every chance she can get.  It turns into one of those love-hate relationships that have fueled many a film, but this one works better than most.  Cage and MacLaine are both excellent choices for their roles, giving the kind of quality performances you'd expect, with an unexpectedly good chemistry between them.  I wish Cage would appear in more films like this, since I often find his choice of pictures puzzling.  The rest of the cast takes a backseat to the star performances.  The writing is good, allowing the relationship to develop naturally between the characters.  I do wish there had been a few more laughs and that the ending had not come so quickly.

That's quite a plausible thing about this movie, and the rest of it enjoyable too. Even though it lets itself down a couple of times, Guarding Tess is still enjoyable none-the-less, and will appeal to many audiences.Doug (Nicolas Cage) is a Secret Service Agent who has just completed his stint in charge protecting Tess Carlisle (Shirley MacLaine), widow of a former U.S. President, and close personal friend of the President. He finds that she has requested that he not be rotated but instead return to be her permanent detail. Doug is crushed. He wants off her detail. She is very difficult to guard and makes her detail crazy with her whims and demands. Doug returns with no idea of how to continue dealing with her.Guarding Tess has most of the things to please a willing audience: an original and effective story, 2 pitch-perfect performances from Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine, some intriguing realistic situations and bright reviews from the critics. I found all of these things to be very impressive facts about the movie, especially the storyline, which dreams up tonnes of ideas as to why Tess should be a pain. The characters are original and you can relate to some of the messes they get into, especially the Doug's craziness of wanting to get away from Tess and do some real Secret Service work. There are a few flaws that stop the movie from being as stunning as their 2 main performers. The comedy never really hits the spot as well as it should. Sure, there are a couple of unashamed giggles, but with a premise so neat, you should expect laughs-out-loud and a lot of them. The film also could've ended better, but you'll still have a good time, guaranteed.Guarding Tess is a good and old-fashioned movie that has a strong mind to please it's audience.

I personally like less the ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" tough guy side of his roles and extremely appreciate his soft tender side; roles like ""Family Man"" and this movie, ""Guarding Tess"".This is an endearing role of the dynamics between two individuals, Tess [Shirley McClaine - former President's wife] and her retirement secret service detail - headed by Cage.  Like I was taught about flying - its usually 99% boredom followed by moments of sheer terror - their detail that guards Tess has the same dynamic.  Always on guard - to walk the dog or get her lunch, etc . . . . .

But when his current assignment is over and he gladly returns to Washington, he is told he has to go back.  Tess called the president and wants him to stay.  It is an almost constant battle of wills between them, with Tess usually winning.A key scene is of her wheeler-dealer businessman son (Edward Albert)coming to ask her to endorse a high-end golf club/housing development.

Later, she is viewing video of television coverage of her husband's funeral, during which her son appears to be feeling nothing, while Doug's composure breaks.  Brief, and covered quickly, but there's no doubt how he felt.  Nicolas Cage is certainly a very good actor.  We understand that Tess wants Doug close to her because he loved her husband and is the son she wished she had.  Also, no one knows that she has an inoperable brain tumor and does not have long to live.Suffice it to say that her affection for him is justified when she is kidnapped.  To Doug's great professional humiliation, top agents descend from Washington and take control; but Doug, unlike anyone else in the agency, realizes almost at once who is responsible and stops at nothing to extract the information he needs to save Tess's life.In the hands of two less-edgy actors it would probably be completely forgettable; but it works.

The First Lady is played well my Shirley MacLaine. The agent feels he is wasted in such a detail and wants desperately to get back on detail to the White House...and the First Lady wants him to stay. The two seem to thrive on confrontation with each other. She does her best to break every procedure the Secret Service is supposed to follow.If you pay attention in the movie you will see why the First Lady actually loves the agent so much and wants him with her.

Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances. The story was lightly funny at first, but didn't really go anywhere. The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange, and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation, it was still weird. The climax came at the end, and was very entertaining, for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot.

8505,AY3FXAAUZ0CYV,076780676X,WC Alaska,"[7, 8]","Shirley MacLaine and Nicolas Cage are magic in this movie. Hugh Wilson deserves kudos for his excellent direction in this superior film.  Nicolas Cage plays the part of an intelligent, aspiring Secret Service agent who  thinks that he's completing his tour of duty with former First Lady Tess  Carlisle, when, to his dismay, she's requested that he stay on permanent  assignment.  He tries on various occasions to sabotage his assignment  through outrageous acts directed towards Tess, but the old political  warhorse turns around every situation to her benefit, calling the President  and complaining, to the point that the President is calling up Cage and  chewing him out to get along with the &quot;cagey&quot; first lady.  Underneath the friction  are suble revelations that change the entire  outlook of the movie. For instance, one begins to realize how much Cage  cares for the former first lady's husband in a scene where she watches old  videos of her husband's funeral when, spotted in the congregation, Cage is  lowering his head to shed tears at the passing of the President. Further  revelations unfold when Tess visits with her son that results in a very  unsatisfactory, shallow encounter leaves her feeling a need to make a  connection with someone who actually cares for her, and Agent Cheznic  fulfills this need without even realizing it. Subtle, classy humor is the  rule of the day, and Cage and MacLaine pull it off in style.  The pace  picks up towards the last half of the movie when the first lady is  kidnapped, and Cage, through feelings of affection and guilt, turns up the  heat on the situation and suspects to begin a frantic search.  Watch  carefully and watch again at the many subtle scenes and extremely excellent  performances by this cast of gifted actors.",5,Shirley and Nicolas are Magic,958262400,"05 14, 2000",2000,1794,"['Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'are', 'magic', 'movie', 'Hugh', 'Wilson', 'kudos', 'excellent', 'direction', 'superior', 'film', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'part', 'intelligent', 'aspiring', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'completing', 'tour', 'duty', 'former', 'First', 'Lady', 'Tess', 'Carlisle', 'when', 'dismay', 'requested', 'stay', 'permanent', 'assignment', 'various', 'occasions', 'sabotage', 'assignment', 'outrageous', 'acts', 'directed', 'towards', 'Tess', 'old', 'political', 'warhorse', 'around', 'situation', 'benefit', 'calling', 'President', 'complaining', 'point', 'President', 'calling', 'up', 'Cage', 'chewing', 'out', 'get', 'quot', 'cagey', 'quot', 'first', 'lady', 'friction', 'are', 'suble', 'revelations', 'change', 'entire', 'outlook', 'movie', 'instance', 'one', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'Cage', 'cares', 'former', 'first', 'lady', 'husband', 'scene', 'where', 'old', 'videos', 'husband', 'funeral', 'when', 'spotted', 'congregation', 'Cage', 'lowering', 'head', 'shed', 'tears', 'passing', 'President', 'Further', 'revelations', 'unfold', 'when', 'Tess', 'son', 'results', 'very', 'unsatisfactory', 'shallow', 'encounter', 'feeling', 'need', 'make', 'connection', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'Agent', 'Cheznic', 'need', 'even', 'realizing', 'Subtle', 'classy', 'humor', 'rule', 'day', 'Cage', 'MacLaine', 'pull', 'off', 'style', 'pace', 'up', 'towards', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'lady', 'kidnapped', 'Cage', 'feelings', 'affection', 'guilt', 'up', 'heat', 'situation', 'suspects', 'begin', 'frantic', 'search', 'Watch', 'carefully', 'watch', 'again', 'many', 'subtle', 'scenes', 'extremely', 'excellent', 'performances', 'cast', 'gifted', 'actors']",N/A
