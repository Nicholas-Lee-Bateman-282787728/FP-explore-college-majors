I never had, but this film, based on a true story, is about a difficult child who has trouble succeeding at anything she tries, until she finds a swimming coach who realizes that her determination and stamina are the makings of a marathon swimmer.  Marilyn has trouble shining in the midst of award-winning swimmers all around her on the team, but through persistence, she ends up having the opportunity to do a marathon swim never tried before, between the US and Canada, across Lake Ontario. Even Florence Chadwick gives up, but 16-year old Marilyn Bell makes it. After watching this moving film, I looked Marilyn Bell up on the Internet and found she had once swum the Straits of Juan de Fuca, near where I live in Washington. This is a family film, because it focuses on parent-child interaction, as well as the stresses of growing up and finding a niche in which to excel. I found it a very inspiring movie.",4,Amazing and true!,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,1026,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'Florence', 'Chadwick', 'famous', 'swimmers', 'have', 'heard', 'Marilyn', 'Bell', 'never', 'had', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'difficult', 'child', 'who', 'trouble', 'succeeding', 'anything', 'swimming', 'coach', 'who', 'determination', 'stamina', 'are', 'makings', 'marathon', 'swimmer', 'Marilyn', 'trouble', 'shining', 'midst', 'award-winning', 'swimmers', 'team', 'persistence', 'up', 'having', 'opportunity', 'do', 'marathon', 'swim', 'never', 'tried', 'US', 'Canada', 'Lake', 'Ontario', 'Even', 'Florence', 'Chadwick', 'up', '16-year', 'old', 'Marilyn', 'Bell', 'watching', 'moving', 'film', 'looked', 'Marilyn', 'Bell', 'up', 'Internet', 'found', 'had', 'once', 'swum', 'Straits', 'Juan', 'de', 'Fuca', 'where', 'live', 'Washington', 'family', 'film', 'parent-child', 'interaction', 'as', 'well', 'stresses', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'niche', 'excel', 'found', 'very', 'inspiring', 'movie']",HEART - The Marilyn Bell Story

Eyon ""Little Raven""","[2, 2]","Rabid Canadian patriotism can't take the fun out of this fast-moving film freely adapted from a real-life event: the 1954 contest to be the first to swim across Lake Ontario.Hell, I'd swim Lake Ontario just to get at ultra-talented and super-cute Caroline Dhavernas (dah-ver-na) who plays Marilyn Bell -- whose 21-hour conquest of the lake and the weather and the limits of human endurance unquestionably demonstrates 'heart'.The campy bits with the typical anti-American caricature may not work for some, but for me, it took the edge off the melodrama of the story. Just don't expect historical accuracy, such as Marilyn's missing years with the swimming club before the crossing, and the unmentioned other swimmer who attempted the crossing and didn't make it (she was Canadian and it seems only Americans are allowed to be shown failing).",4,Immortalizing an obscure event,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,841,"['Rabid', 'Canadian', 'patriotism', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'fun', 'fast-moving', 'film', 'freely', 'adapted', 'real-life', 'event', '1954', 'contest', 'be', 'first', 'swim', 'Lake', 'Ontario.Hell', ""'d"", 'swim', 'Lake', 'Ontario', 'just', 'get', 'ultra-talented', 'super-cute', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'dah-ver-na', 'who', 'Marilyn', 'Bell', '21-hour', 'conquest', 'lake', 'weather', 'limits', 'human', 'endurance', 'unquestionably', ""'heart'.The"", 'campy', 'bits', 'typical', 'anti-American', 'caricature', 'may', 'not', 'work', 'took', 'edge', 'melodrama', 'story', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'such', 'Marilyn', 'missing', 'years', 'swimming', 'club', 'crossing', 'unmentioned', 'other', 'swimmer', 'who', 'attempted', 'crossing', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'was', 'Canadian', 'only', 'Americans', 'are', 'allowed', 'be', 'shown', 'failing']",HEART - The Marilyn Bell Story

903053,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B0009A40Y8,Lola's Mom,"[0, 0]","This movie introduced me to a woman I'd never heard of before but will never forget.In 1954, this girl was the first person to ever swim across Lake Ontario, from the NY side to the Canadian side. 21 hours in the water, over 32 miles. She passed out three times. Fell asleep...and trudged on when American swimming starlet Florence Chadwick was forced to bail due to hypothermia.In the movie, we meet a sixteen-year-old Marilyn. She has a horrid mother, a mother that tells her she's not good anything...so it's best to not try. Naturally, this drives Marilyn to be good at something. I think driving her along was def the desire the please that awful mother.Marilyn approaches a coach known for making swimmers into champions. He refuses to take her on at first and she proceeds to stay in the pool and swim for two hours straight. She's persistent.Meanwhile, the CNE (some kind of Canadian entertainment people) hire the famous Florence to swim lake Ontario, as they're desperately trying to compete with television and draw in the crowds. This was funny, actually. A very nice touch, the two competing publicity people. You'd have to see it to understand it. It's even more hilarious when their plans go awry and they suddenly sing a different tune. At first, when Marilyn announces she's competing against the starlet, the CNE people are mad...but they sorta betrayed their own people by bringing in an American to cross their lake.So Marilyn has a heck of a lot to proof--to her mother, her country, her coach, herself...and that stuck up Florence who waited like 4 days to do the swim...ugh. Long story.The last half of the movie is Marilyn actually swimming it...and I swear I didn't think she'd make it. I felt my own muscles ache as I watched her. I got mad at her coach as he yelled at her. I wanted to scream at her mother, ""Are you happy now?? Oh, NOW that's your girl?"" I felt the eels around her legs.And...this is a true story! At the age of sixteen, Marilyn Bell was the first to swim across Lake Ontario. She proceeded to become the youngest to swim the English Channel and she retired at 19 to be a teacher.This is a woman worth learning about. I recommend watching this incredible movie or just taking a moment of your day to think about this incredible feat.",5,Memorable,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,2278,"['movie', 'introduced', 'woman', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'will', 'never', 'forget.In', '1954', 'girl', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'ever', 'swim', 'Lake', 'Ontario', 'NY', 'side', 'Canadian', 'side', '21', 'hours', 'water', '32', 'miles', 'passed', 'out', 'three', 'times', 'Fell', 'asleep', 'trudged', 'when', 'American', 'swimming', 'starlet', 'Florence', 'Chadwick', 'was', 'forced', 'bail', 'due', 'hypothermia.In', 'movie', 'meet', 'sixteen-year-old', 'Marilyn', 'horrid', 'mother', 'mother', 'not', 'good', 'anything', 'best', 'not', 'try', 'Naturally', 'Marilyn', 'be', 'good', 'something', 'think', 'driving', 'along', 'was', 'desire', 'please', 'awful', 'mother.Marilyn', 'coach', 'known', 'making', 'swimmers', 'champions', 'take', 'first', 'stay', 'pool', 'swim', 'two', 'hours', 'straight', 'persistent.Meanwhile', 'CNE', 'kind', 'Canadian', 'entertainment', 'people', 'hire', 'famous', 'Florence', 'swim', 'lake', 'Ontario', ""'re"", 'desperately', 'trying', 'compete', 'television', 'draw', 'crowds', 'was', 'funny', 'actually', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'two', 'competing', 'publicity', 'people', ""'d"", 'have', 'see', 'understand', 'even', 'more', 'hilarious', 'when', 'plans', 'go', 'awry', 'suddenly', 'sing', 'different', 'tune', 'first', 'when', 'Marilyn', 'competing', 'starlet', 'CNE', 'people', 'are', 'mad', 'sorta', 'betrayed', 'own', 'people', 'bringing', 'American', 'cross', 'lake.So', 'Marilyn', 'heck', 'lot', 'proof', 'mother', 'country', 'coach', 'stuck', 'up', 'Florence', 'who', 'waited', '4', 'days', 'do', 'swim', 'ugh', 'Long', 'story.The', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'Marilyn', 'actually', 'swimming', 'swear', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'make', 'felt', 'own', 'muscles', 'ache', 'watched', 'got', 'mad', 'coach', 'yelled', 'wanted', 'scream', 'mother', 'Are', 'happy', 'now', 'Oh', 'NOW', 'girl', 'felt', 'eels', 'legs.And', 'true', 'story', 'age', 'sixteen', 'Marilyn', 'Bell', 'was', 'first', 'swim', 'Lake', 'Ontario', 'proceeded', 'become', 'youngest', 'swim', 'English', 'Channel', 'retired', '19', 'be', 'teacher.This', 'woman', 'learning', 'recommend', 'watching', 'incredible', 'movie', 'just', 'taking', 'moment', 'day', 'think', 'incredible', 'feat']",HEART - The Marilyn Bell Story
