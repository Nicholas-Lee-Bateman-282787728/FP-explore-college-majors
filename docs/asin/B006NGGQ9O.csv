I love yoga & have been practicing for quite a long time, but I can tell you that (at least in ashtanga) it doesn't transform anyone into this beatific creature (except when filming promos for Instagram or YouTube).The message is good at times but if anyone wanted to make an interesting film about yoga they might try to at least admitting to some of the dark side.This film is mainly a platform for Seane Corn, who I don't mind. She seems sincere enough. My favorite speaker was Angela Farmer. I basically liked all of them except Cyndi Lee. For some reason I got a big, inner ""ewww"" from her vibe.",3,It's a bit simplistic,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,751,"['sales', 'promotional', 'tool', 'involved', 'yoga', 'were', 'really', 'magic', 'bullet', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'many', 'egomaniac', 'severely', 'flawed', 'teachers', 'love', 'yoga', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'least', 'ashtanga', ""n't"", 'transform', 'anyone', 'beatific', 'creature', 'when', 'filming', 'promos', 'Instagram', 'YouTube', '.The', 'message', 'good', 'times', 'anyone', 'wanted', 'make', 'interesting', 'film', 'yoga', 'might', 'try', 'least', 'admitting', 'dark', 'side.This', 'film', 'mainly', 'platform', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sincere', 'enough', 'My', 'favorite', 'speaker', 'was', 'Angela', 'Farmer', 'basically', 'liked', 'Cyndi', 'Lee', 'reason', 'got', 'big', 'inner', 'ewww', 'vibe']",Yogawoman
1517643,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B006NGGQ9O,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","&#34;Yogawoman&#34; (2011 release; 84 min.) takes a look at the yoga scene for woman. As the movie opens, we are given some basic facts such as the roots of yoga in India, the role (more non-role) of woman in yoga historically, and how prior to the 1960s and 70s there were no female yoga teachers in the US. That started to change some 40 years ago, with rapid expansion for women. (There is a hilarious archive clip from those early days courtesy of WCET in Cincinnati--where I live--in which Lilias Folan gives a yoga lesson.) l Nowadays, there are 20 million yoga practitioners, of which an astonishing 85% are women. As we hear testimonial after testimonial, it is clear that many believe that yoga is an excellent tool with which to battle the stress of the world we live in today.Couple of comments: first, I couldn't help but feel that this is not an 'investigative' documentary, but rather that it is an 'educative' one, in fact almost an infomercial for a product called 'yoga'. And I'm not suggesting that this is any different from what this DVD portrays itself to be. Second, please note that the documentary is narrated by none other than Annette Bening. Third, the soundtrack is very much new-age like, in fact reminding me at times of the classic Windham Hill new age albums from the mid/late 80s. I liked the music quite a bit.&#34;Yogawoman&#34; was first released in 2011. It is now getting renewed exposure with the re-release of the DVD by US distributor Passion River, and it's also available as an Amazon Instant Video. If you are a woman and into yoga, you will definitely want to check this out. For the rest of us, it's more of a curiosity than anything else.",4,3.5 stars...

One thing I had not realized was that yoga started out being dominated by men---something you would never guess when you look at classes filled by women. I enjoyed listening to the people who were interviewed for this documentary, and it was fun watching people practice yoga, as well. There is something extremely fluid and beautiful when someone moves through a series of poses. The entire thing was well worth watching. I might even watch it again sometime.

1517646,A1J9SUX6DLLADK,B006NGGQ9O,ubalu,"[20, 23]","This is a program by some Western women Yoga practitioners/instructors using Yoga as a platform. Through the practice of Yoga asanas, they aim at understanding and coping with women's cycles of life and enhancing every aspect of life. There are sections in the video on applying Yoga to every stage from childhood to advanced age. The therapeutic value of Yoga is highly emphasized. These yoga women expand the program to attempts at managing stress, and coping with and healing serious illnesses of the body. They also reach out to the world, to some of the disadvantaged areas of Africa, improving the self-identity and self-image of the population there. They build self-esteem in the women and introduce community and social services.It is all about women's unity and applying women's influence and power to better women and children, which will spill into all areas of their lives and make calmer, happier families and world.This is a very good program with great ideas, but there are some questions. Do the Yoga women work in the slums and disadvantaged areas in the US? If they do, it is not included the video. Are they overlooking the needs in their own country and going all the way across the world to help? The program shows a Yoga woman working in a US detention center for teens, but nothing more on work in the depressed areas in the US.There is one huge mistake in the video. One of the Yoga women states that women in India were not allowed to practice Yoga. This is not true at all, on two levels. Here are the facts: The old Indian culture did not allow `combined' class of men and women together in a class, especially physical programs, because it was considered immodest. Women, especially privileged women learned Yoga at home or in informal women-only settings. In India, the place of origin of Yoga Science and Philosophy, it was and is practiced as a complete system of spirituality, not just the physical culture/asanas the West does. The under-privileged population of India did not have the resources, they received their `exercise' simply through physical work. They tried calmness through prayer (Bhakti Yoga) and helpfulness to others (Karma Yoga).The West has isolated just the one limb of Yoga- asanas/'yoga postures' from the whole system and is finding out how therapeutic just this one limb is. The few who try to practice all limbs of Yoga have a glimpse of the whole picture.Human every-day angels have been doing service throughout history, with or without a platform.
