1444566,A3UM5IR9AZL1WZ,B00578K2H6,"David Crumm ""Editor of ReadTheSpirit magazine""","[11, 11]","Leaders around the world still are sorting out the aftermath of the vast crimes against humanity that swept through Cambodia in the 1970s. As recently as spring 2012, U.S. and Cambodian officials made front-page news by trying to reconcile the theft of a priceless Cambodian statue that apparently was stolen in the mid-1970s and wound up in a Sotheby's auction.Even more important than sorting out reparations from cultural crimes in that era, the first of the Khmer Rouge war criminals was not convicted until 2010 and human-rights investigations continue in Cambodia to this day. Many investigators and journalists--like those you will meet in the historic video record in `Enemies of the People'--are still working to pierce the veil of secrecy about what happened during the bloody reign of Khmer Rouge terror. In that era, countless Cambodians who are alive today were brutally tortured--and 2 million Cambodians were murdered. (Some estimates place the death toll lower or higher.)The fact that few perpetrators have been brought to justice is shocking. But, why should you care? Well, as a journalist myself, I've got a longtime commitment to spreading information that aids in global peacemaking. The release of collected video from the extensive `Enemies' filmmaking project, within this new DVD set, is exactly the kind of peacemaking effort we all can encourage.When a version of the documentary aired in 2011 on PBS, I had a chance to interview the brave Cambodian journalist Thet Sambath. For years, he risked his life to find and interview Khmer Rouge killers. His body of work paved the way for the creation of this full-scale documentary film along with Rob Lemkin. Sambath has been a leading investigative journalist for a Cambodian English-language newspaper, the Phnom Penh Post. In 2011, he won the prestigious Knight International Journalism Award. The Sambath-Lemkin documentary, now, has racked up a whole shelf of additional awards and honors. Now, Sambath and Lemkin are working on a second film, as well. Your purchasing and spreading the news about their first project will help them in their ongoing efforts.What are their motives? In our 2011 interview, Thet Sambath clearly explained why this film differs from many other movies about crimes against humanity. Truth be told, many movies focus more on the horrors, gore and suspense of such crimes throughout world history. The focus in `Enemies of the People' is squarely on reconciliation and peacemaking.In 2011, Thet told me: ""We would like there to be people-to-people reconciliation between victims and perpetrators. There are thousands of Khmer Rouge perpetrators in Cambodia and abroad including the U.S. We want it to be possible they can all come forward and confess."" I asked, ""Why is that so important?"" He added, ""So the new generation can understand what happened and why. We must never repeat the mistakes of the past. We need to move forward to a brighter future.""Finally, let me urge you: If you're intrigued by this film, buy it now. One of the unfortunate truths about today's media market is the fact that the delivery of movies to American viewers is changing dramatically right now. That means DVD sales in the U.S. are declining and many important DVD titles come and go--and potentially may vanish from the market without warning. I hope that Lemkin's and Sambath's supplement-stuffed DVD edition will continue to be on sale indefinitely. But my word of warning is: Get it now. This particular edition of the film includes lots of supplemental material that will help orient you to the Khmer Rouge era--and also to the aftermath for survivors of this massive crime against humanity. There's even a booklet in this current edition that is quite helpful to those who want to understand this tragic era--and the potential road ahead that we all may encourage in seeking peace.",5,Buying This Historic Documentary Encourages Reconciliation,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,3877,"['Leaders', 'world', 'still', 'are', 'sorting', 'out', 'aftermath', 'vast', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'swept', 'Cambodia', '1970s', 'As', 'recently', 'spring', '2012', 'U.S.', 'Cambodian', 'officials', 'made', 'front-page', 'news', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'theft', 'priceless', 'Cambodian', 'statue', 'apparently', 'was', 'stolen', 'mid-1970s', 'wound', 'up', 'Sotheby', 'auction.Even', 'more', 'important', 'sorting', 'out', 'reparations', 'cultural', 'crimes', 'era', 'first', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'war', 'criminals', 'was', 'not', 'convicted', '2010', 'human-rights', 'investigations', 'continue', 'Cambodia', 'day', 'Many', 'investigators', 'journalists', 'will', 'meet', 'historic', 'video', 'record', 'Enemies', 'People', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'pierce', 'veil', 'secrecy', 'what', 'happened', 'bloody', 'reign', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'terror', 'era', 'countless', 'Cambodians', 'who', 'are', 'alive', 'today', 'were', 'brutally', 'tortured', '2', 'million', 'Cambodians', 'were', 'murdered', 'estimates', 'place', 'death', 'toll', 'lower', 'higher', 'fact', 'few', 'perpetrators', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'justice', 'shocking', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'Well', 'journalist', ""'ve"", 'got', 'longtime', 'commitment', 'spreading', 'information', 'global', 'peacemaking', 'release', 'collected', 'video', 'extensive', 'Enemies', 'filmmaking', 'project', 'new', 'DVD', 'set', 'exactly', 'kind', 'peacemaking', 'effort', 'can', 'encourage.When', 'version', 'documentary', 'aired', '2011', 'PBS', 'had', 'chance', 'interview', 'brave', 'Cambodian', 'journalist', 'Thet', 'Sambath', 'years', 'risked', 'life', 'find', 'interview', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'killers', 'body', 'work', 'paved', 'way', 'creation', 'full-scale', 'documentary', 'film', 'Rob', 'Lemkin', 'Sambath', 'been', 'leading', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'Cambodian', 'English-language', 'newspaper', 'Phnom', 'Penh', 'Post', '2011', 'won', 'prestigious', 'Knight', 'International', 'Journalism', 'Award', 'Sambath-Lemkin', 'documentary', 'now', 'racked', 'up', 'whole', 'shelf', 'additional', 'awards', 'honors', 'Now', 'Sambath', 'Lemkin', 'are', 'working', 'second', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'purchasing', 'spreading', 'news', 'first', 'project', 'will', 'help', 'ongoing', 'are', 'motives', '2011', 'interview', 'Thet', 'Sambath', 'clearly', 'explained', 'why', 'film', 'differs', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'many', 'movies', 'focus', 'more', 'horrors', 'gore', 'suspense', 'such', 'crimes', 'world', 'history', 'focus', 'Enemies', 'People', 'squarely', 'reconciliation', 'peacemaking.In', '2011', 'Thet', 'told', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'people-to-people', 'reconciliation', 'victims', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'thousands', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'perpetrators', 'Cambodia', 'abroad', 'including', 'U.S.', 'want', 'be', 'possible', 'can', 'come', 'forward', 'confess', 'asked', 'Why', 'so', 'important', 'added', 'So', 'new', 'generation', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'must', 'never', 'repeat', 'mistakes', 'past', 'need', 'move', 'forward', 'brighter', 'future', 'Finally', 'let', 'urge', ""'re"", 'intrigued', 'film', 'buy', 'now', 'One', 'unfortunate', 'truths', 'today', 'media', 'market', 'fact', 'delivery', 'movies', 'American', 'viewers', 'changing', 'dramatically', 'right', 'now', 'DVD', 'sales', 'U.S.', 'are', 'declining', 'many', 'important', 'DVD', 'titles', 'come', 'go', 'potentially', 'may', 'vanish', 'market', 'warning', 'hope', 'Lemkin', 'Sambath', 'supplement-stuffed', 'DVD', 'edition', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'sale', 'indefinitely', 'word', 'warning', 'Get', 'now', 'particular', 'edition', 'film', 'lots', 'supplemental', 'material', 'will', 'help', 'orient', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'era', 'also', 'aftermath', 'survivors', 'massive', 'crime', 'humanity', 'even', 'booklet', 'current', 'edition', 'quite', 'helpful', 'who', 'want', 'understand', 'tragic', 'era', 'potential', 'road', 'ahead', 'may', 'encourage', 'seeking', 'peace']",Enemies of the People

But, unlike, say Nazi Germany, it is not as studied; the psychology of how neighbor turns against neighbor. This outrageous few years is not the stuff of museums and American history classes. Many do not even know what happened. Those who do still ask why.Approximately one quarter of the population lost their lives; one quarter - that is not a misprint. Men, women and children. The Khmer Rouge regime murdered over a neighboring country's political movements, (Vietnam), and the paranoia that grew within two of Cambodia's leaders that ""infiltrators"" would take down their new communist regime.After executing any high-level officials the two felt may be party resisters they took aim at farmers and workers. Villagers considered traitors (without trial or proof) were put to death.Thet Sambath, who lost his father, mother and brother to the Khmer Rouge has become a journalist. And most recently, leaving behind his family, and safety, he has been working for years to gain the trust of a few still-living players in the ""Killing Fields,"" and the actual Second in Command's trust. Your stomach churns as Sambath smiles and documents confessions of their crimes in the late 1970s.Though it has been decades since the killings there is still a country-wide silence about who did what and why. Sambath (along with co-director Rob Lemkin), weave through the agonizing footage of kindly-looking old men and women who once slaughtered their neighbors.I can not think of any other mass-murder-in-history documentary that has captured (on film) the confessions of those directly involved. Some regretful, some filled with shame...others still standing by their decision that the deaths were to protect their country. The footage is remarkable. Sambath undertook the years of sacrificing and under cover friendships to document the crimes for future generations. He uncovers the truth as painful as it must have been for him personally.This is an extremely important documentary. You will be moved to tears as a realization that so many died without reason starts to unfold. You realize, fear of being killed themselves, power over others, and ""orders"" from unverified sources lead to genocide.After sweeping through film festivals, Enemies of the People"" is now available on DVD; which is great as you may need several stop-and-starts, the subject matter is so upsetting.",5,One of the most important documentaries ever produced,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,2450,"['Khmer', 'Rouge', 'reign', 'Cambodia', 'notorious', 'notch', 'history', 'timeline', 'say', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'not', 'studied', 'psychology', 'how', 'neighbor', 'turns', 'neighbor', 'outrageous', 'few', 'years', 'not', 'stuff', 'museums', 'American', 'history', 'classes', 'Many', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'do', 'still', 'ask', 'why.Approximately', 'one', 'quarter', 'population', 'lost', 'lives', 'one', 'quarter', 'not', 'misprint', 'Men', 'women', 'children', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'regime', 'murdered', 'neighboring', 'country', 'political', 'movements', 'Vietnam', 'paranoia', 'grew', 'two', 'Cambodia', 'leaders', 'infiltrators', 'would', 'take', 'down', 'new', 'communist', 'regime.After', 'executing', 'high-level', 'officials', 'two', 'felt', 'may', 'be', 'party', 'resisters', 'took', 'aim', 'farmers', 'workers', 'Villagers', 'considered', 'traitors', 'trial', 'proof', 'were', 'put', 'death.Thet', 'Sambath', 'who', 'lost', 'father', 'mother', 'brother', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'become', 'journalist', 'most', 'recently', 'leaving', 'family', 'safety', 'been', 'working', 'years', 'gain', 'trust', 'few', 'still-living', 'players', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'actual', 'Second', 'Command', 'trust', 'stomach', 'churns', 'Sambath', 'smiles', 'documents', 'confessions', 'crimes', 'late', '1970s.Though', 'been', 'decades', 'killings', 'still', 'country-wide', 'silence', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'why', 'Sambath', 'co-director', 'Rob', 'Lemkin', 'weave', 'agonizing', 'footage', 'kindly-looking', 'old', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'once', 'slaughtered', 'neighbors.I', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'other', 'mass-murder-in-history', 'documentary', 'captured', 'film', 'confessions', 'directly', 'involved', 'regretful', 'filled', 'shame', 'others', 'still', 'standing', 'decision', 'deaths', 'were', 'protect', 'country', 'footage', 'remarkable', 'Sambath', 'years', 'sacrificing', 'cover', 'friendships', 'document', 'crimes', 'future', 'generations', 'truth', 'as', 'painful', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'personally.This', 'extremely', 'important', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'tears', 'realization', 'so', 'many', 'died', 'reason', 'starts', 'unfold', 'realize', 'fear', 'being', 'killed', 'power', 'others', 'orders', 'unverified', 'sources', 'lead', 'genocide.After', 'sweeping', 'film', 'festivals', 'Enemies', 'People', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'great', 'may', 'need', 'several', 'stop-and-starts', 'subject', 'matter', 'so', 'upsetting']",Enemies of the People

Not nearly as much of Nuon Chea as we would have hoped for, but significant admissions nonetheless. Mention of the purge of the Vietnamese and the Khmer Krom (translated as ""ethnic minority"" in the subtitles) is interesting, though strangely the ongoing tribunal seems not to be planning to try the leadership on genocide against the Vietnamese, only genocide against Cham Muslims. For those interested in reading party policy explicitly inciting crimes of genocide against the Vietnamese, the Revolutionary Flag, distributed to party members at the time, could hardly have been more clear on that subject. The recently released memoirs of Vietnamese foreign ministry officials reveal that China coerced the Vietnamese into ceasing to speak about genocide against the Vietnamese people in return for normalization of relations with China.
