Ralph Waite, Richard Thomas, & all the &#34;characters&#34; these adults & then children became are absolutely timeless!  When Ralph Waite passed, the next day I ordered all 9 (nine) Seasons just because I can afford, my husband allowed me to & I simply wanted them in my &#34;collection&#34; of the best years gone by.
