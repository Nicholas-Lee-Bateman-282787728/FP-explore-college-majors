349046,AWA88F5TOX8VL,6302985250,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[4, 4]","[THE IMPOSSIBLE YEARS DVD - (1968) - Widescreen Presentation - Directed by Michael Gordon]  A solid, family-friendly screwball comedy that illustrates how American society went from being adult driven to teenage driven within a few short years and the results, both good and bad, of such a societal shift in the paradigm that persists today. This would soon come to be referred to as the Generation Gap. Or so would say psychiatrist Jonathan Kingsley (David Niven), whose eldest daughter, Christina Ferrare, is a beautiful chain-smoking seventeen year old who gets arrested for carrying a protest banner on the good doctor's campus that has an inappropriate word on the rear side she insists she wasn't aware of. This eruption sets off a chain of events in the Kingsley household as mom (Lola Albright in a bad wig) and dad experience firsthand the growing pains of their two young daughters' struggles for identity, independence and, of course, the opposite sex. This isn't 'the right stuff' for the good doctor's campus credibility, as he's a well-published, alleged 'expert' on adolescent behavior in the throes of a new book, and currently under review for a stuffy, snooty faculty position - ouch.Christina Ferrare is surprisingly good in her first role, completely believable and enchanting as an articulate young lady who morphs from a partying bohemian, a bedeviled and bemoaning teenager into a worldly, stately statue of womanly beauty over the course of a summer. She looks gear and fab in an array of bikinis that epitomize this time period, as do the other lasses who attend the shindigs she throws in her parents backyard - you know, the one with the unsupervised, Olympic-sized swimming pool, the huge buffet table with catered food and the open bar overflowing with alcoholic beverages for the thirsty, lustful youths in constant need of refreshments who then have to drive themselves home afterwards, half of which are unlicensed and uninsured. (You think I'm joking? Watch this flick and find out - it's all there in the fine details). Yes, kids, these WERE the good old days, make no mistake about it... sigh.David Niven is in fine comedic form as the shrink who has control issues and an editor whose biggest ambition currently is to ghost write the doc's new book (played by a nerdy-looking Chad Everett in big black-framed glasses), Lola Albright as the mostly mechanical, overmedicated mom of the 60's, Ozzie Nelson as the recently-divorced, neurotic next door physician with an oversexed son who plays trumpet like Louie Armstrong and looks like one of the Beach Boys, and Darleen Carr as the precocious younger thirteen year-old sister. Don't freak out when the flick opens with a hideously unhip pop tune by The Cowsills (I had a ""kill-me-now"" moment myself), once the opening credits roll, the horrors end and the good-natured fun begins. Make no bones about it - the teenage years are tough, especially on the parents...Warner Bros. Archive Collection audio and video are superb, as usual, even with the accompanying hefty pricetag, and this one makes a great double-bill with 'Don't Make Waves', also from WB Archives.

David Niven plays a psychiatrist who is run ragged trying to keep his free spirited teenage daughter, played by the beautiful Cristina Ferrare, sheltered from her new found sexuality.  I saw this film when I was in 8th grade and it has always held a special place in my heart. It was part of my growing up. I still remember it fondly. I remember that this film was rated ""G"" and there was quite a commotion made about that because of all the references to human sexuality that it contained. We have sure come a long way since this film was released. Lola Albright, Chad Everett and the beloved Ozzie Nelson were also in the cast.

349055,A1JRSEI92D90J1,6302985250,Grelber37,"[2, 2]","This DVD's jacket calls The Impossible Years a ""60s generation-gap comedy."" This 1968 dramedy does present the generational clash of its times, and it does so in an intelligently humorous and heartfelt manner. Had John Hughes made movies in the 1960s, he would have made The Impossible Years. One could consider The Impossible Years also a lighter companion piece to The Graduate, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Easy Rider, and other films making a social comment upon the changing times.The plot for The Impossible Years resembles that of What About Bob? Prof. Kingsley (Niven) thinks that he is such an expert on teenagers, and his distinguished work leads him toward great career advancement. However, one case undercuts his supposed ""brilliant"" knowledge and problematizes his best-laid plans. And, this difficult case lives very close to him--in his own home. Linda Kingsley (Cristina Ferrare) is Prof. Jonathan Kingsley's rebellious seventeen-year-old daughter. As she becomes an adult, she displays ""problem"" behaviors. She joins campus protests, fails classes, smokes cigarettes, keeps a slovenly room, and wears revealing outfits. And, most of all, she has ""problems"" with the opposite sex. Sexual rebellion plays a large role in this work just before the Sumer of Love. Director Michael Gordon did Pillow Talk, and The Impossible Years is often another light sex comedy.  The social scientist finds that he can no longer control and understand his children. Much social commentary and insightful comedy follows.  Niven and Ferrare (all of eighteen at the time) do great jobs in their roles.Is The Impossible Years good? Yes. The highest compliment that I can give The Impossible Years is this. I am not a baby boomer, yet I love and appreciate this film. The Impossible Years is very funny. It has witty and realistic dialogue and situations. It calls a viewer to laugh and to also think. It has slapstick and schtick. For example, people fall into swimming pools while fully clothed, and they crash into each others' cars. In The Impossible Years, humor occurs on many levels.The Impossible Years is heartfelt. I felt for the Kingsleys. Families struggle when parents and kids have a parting of the ways. The parents are baffled and struggle. The kids struggle as they become adults. As one tagline puts it, ""the teenage years are tough--especially for the parents."" Similar to a Hughes movie, The Impossible Years switches tone toward its denouement. Eventually, Linda is in a more mature romantic relationship. Eventually, she needs a more independent living situation than that at home. She must become a woman instead of a big teenager playing around with her boyfriends and generally getting on her parents' nerves. A viewer feels for the situation. We have all witnessed the late teen departing the nest.As mentioned, the cast makes this movie happen. Niven was a master actor, and he is on his game here--from the silliest scenes to the most weighty. Ferrare is a very talented woman to this day, and she shows those talents in this role. Perhaps, being only eighteen at the time helps. The supporting cast supports too. I was never once distracted by bad acting.Could The Impossible Years be better in any ways? I offer a brief note. The Impossible Years is rated-G. A 1968 movie, it premiered in the MPAA's nascency. In reality, The Impossible Years is more like a hard PG-13. Why? Well, the story contains somewhat explicit sexual dialogue, partial nudity on several occasions, and aggressive sexual ""play."" You see, Linda's boyfriends are kind of grabby and otherwise piggish. Their behavior is presented always as improper and ungentlemanly. However, their aggression is played for comedic effect. The scenes are like a Peppy LePew cartoon. These boys will be boys. On one hand, these scenes are artifacts of the time, and today's audiences might still have a good laugh at ultra-awkward situations. On the other hand, current audiences might see such behavior as quite unfunny.Other humor might be a little dated as well. We have no pies in the face. But, asmentioned, The Impossible Years has its share of physical comedy and cute dry quips do occur throughout the film. Then again, audiences tolerate and like both of those things on sitcoms and such.",4,"Not even a baby boomer, I like The Impossible Years",1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,4276,"['DVD', 'jacket', 'Impossible', '60s', 'generation-gap', 'comedy', '1968', 'dramedy', 'present', 'generational', 'clash', 'times', 'so', 'intelligently', 'humorous', 'heartfelt', 'manner', 'Had', 'John', 'Hughes', 'made', 'movies', '1960s', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'One', 'could', 'consider', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'also', 'lighter', 'companion', 'piece', 'Graduate', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'other', 'films', 'making', 'social', 'comment', 'changing', 'times.The', 'plot', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'What', 'Bob', 'Prof.', 'Kingsley', 'Niven', 'such', 'expert', 'teenagers', 'distinguished', 'work', 'great', 'career', 'advancement', 'However', 'one', 'case', 'supposed', 'brilliant', 'knowledge', 'problematizes', 'best-laid', 'plans', 'difficult', 'case', 'very', 'close', 'own', 'home', 'Linda', 'Kingsley', 'Cristina', 'Ferrare', 'Prof.', 'Jonathan', 'Kingsley', 'rebellious', 'seventeen-year-old', 'daughter', 'adult', 'problem', 'behaviors', 'campus', 'protests', 'classes', 'smokes', 'cigarettes', 'slovenly', 'room', 'wears', 'revealing', 'outfits', 'most', 'problems', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Sexual', 'rebellion', 'large', 'role', 'work', 'just', 'Sumer', 'Love', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Gordon', 'did', 'Pillow', 'Talk', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'often', 'light', 'sex', 'comedy', 'social', 'scientist', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'control', 'understand', 'children', 'Much', 'social', 'commentary', 'insightful', 'comedy', 'Niven', 'Ferrare', 'eighteen', 'time', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'roles.Is', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'good', 'Yes', 'highest', 'compliment', 'can', 'give', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'am', 'not', 'baby', 'boomer', 'yet', 'love', 'appreciate', 'film', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'very', 'funny', 'witty', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'viewer', 'laugh', 'also', 'think', 'slapstick', 'schtick', 'example', 'people', 'fall', 'swimming', 'pools', 'fully', 'clothed', 'crash', 'others', 'cars', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'humor', 'occurs', 'many', 'levels.The', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'heartfelt', 'felt', 'Kingsleys', 'Families', 'struggle', 'when', 'parents', 'kids', 'have', 'parting', 'ways', 'parents', 'are', 'baffled', 'struggle', 'kids', 'struggle', 'become', 'adults', 'one', 'tagline', 'teenage', 'years', 'are', 'tough', 'especially', 'parents', 'Similar', 'Hughes', 'movie', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'tone', 'denouement', 'Eventually', 'Linda', 'more', 'mature', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Eventually', 'more', 'independent', 'living', 'situation', 'home', 'must', 'become', 'woman', 'instead', 'big', 'teenager', 'playing', 'boyfriends', 'generally', 'getting', 'parents', 'nerves', 'viewer', 'feels', 'situation', 'have', 'witnessed', 'late', 'teen', 'departing', 'nest.As', 'mentioned', 'cast', 'movie', 'happen', 'Niven', 'was', 'master', 'actor', 'game', 'here', 'silliest', 'scenes', 'most', 'weighty', 'Ferrare', 'very', 'talented', 'woman', 'day', 'talents', 'role', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'only', 'eighteen', 'time', 'supporting', 'cast', 'supports', 'too', 'was', 'never', 'once', 'distracted', 'bad', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'be', 'better', 'ways', 'offer', 'brief', 'note', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'rated-G.', '1968', 'movie', 'premiered', 'MPAA', 'nascency', 'reality', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'more', 'hard', 'PG-13', 'Why', 'Well', 'story', 'somewhat', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'dialogue', 'partial', 'nudity', 'several', 'occasions', 'aggressive', 'sexual', 'play', 'see', 'Linda', 'boyfriends', 'are', 'kind', 'grabby', 'otherwise', 'piggish', 'behavior', 'presented', 'always', 'improper', 'ungentlemanly', 'However', 'aggression', 'played', 'comedic', 'effect', 'scenes', 'are', 'Peppy', 'LePew', 'cartoon', 'boys', 'will', 'be', 'boys', 'one', 'hand', 'scenes', 'are', 'artifacts', 'time', 'today', 'audiences', 'might', 'still', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'ultra-awkward', 'situations', 'other', 'hand', 'current', 'audiences', 'might', 'see', 'such', 'behavior', 'quite', 'unfunny.Other', 'humor', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'dated', 'well', 'have', 'pies', 'face', 'asmentioned', 'Impossible', 'Years', 'share', 'physical', 'comedy', 'cute', 'dry', 'quips', 'do', 'occur', 'film', 'Then', 'again', 'audiences', 'tolerate', 'things', 'sitcoms', 'such']",The Impossible Years VHS

349057,A20JYIHL1W1U54,6302985250,"hille2000 ""hille2000""","[16, 27]","THE IMPOSSIBLE YEARS is an interesting look at being a parent and a teenager in the late 1960s. On one hand you have David Niven playing a psychiatrist who is unable to understand the behavior of his oldest teenage daughter played by Cristina Ferrare. On the other hand you have Ferrare as a seemingly carefree adolescent starting out as the misunderstood teenage grub and in the final analysis emerging as the beautiful and free adult butterfly. Niven is dutifully and infinitely concerned yet remains totally perplexed by her behavior. Ferrare however has the situation completely under control. In this case less is more. This is a comedy but I wonder about the statement it makes. If you look at the decade before and a film such as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE it makes you wonder. REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE gave us a world upside down where for almost the entire film the roles of teenager and parent are reversed. Yet REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE ends with the teenager clutched by his parent who promises to be there and take each step along with his child. Both parent and teenager have learned and grown during the process of that story. REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE was indicative of the fear, paranoia and confusion prevalent during the 1950s. Yet in its conclusion it reverts back to the idea that the hope for traditional values will prevail. If THE IMPOSSIBLE YEARS was made as a film in the 50s it would probably not have been a comedy. The issues confronting parents and teenagers were different but were just as hefty from a moralistic standpoint. THE IMPOSSIBLE YEARS ends on a completely different note than REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. It ends with complacency. THE IMPOSSIBLE YEARS was made during that narrow window of time during the 60s when we enjoyed prosperity and our immutable cocktail parties. The morality of the Vietnam conflict was just becoming apparent to the American civilian population. The dark shadow of war had not descended over the country.  The term activism was slowly creeping into the colloquial vocabulary of the time. THE IMPOSSIBLE YEARS could easily be taken as fluff but I think it is actually an important film. David Niven represents the old guard of cinema's representation of sound parenthood. James Dean's screen parents were definitely treading on perilous waters. Fifteen years later the parents were to see time pass them by and leave them still dedicated as they actually always were but are now worrisome impotent shadows of a era and morality long gone and never to return.

Its not just parents trying to do the right thing but being deceived by psychiatry. With a comic touch we see David Niven as a lost-in-space psychiatrist who writes and talks his pyscho-babble but when it is thrown at him by his own family, he dismisses it as nonsense. Truth was never more plain. Parents giving their teens money and material goods as a guilt substitute for time and interest is portrayed by all the families in the movie. The work career is exalted over the true career as a caring parent. This is a true classic commentary on the postwar U.S.Education and colleges are the target of some well written and acted comedic scenes.

I felt the 7O was too high for a VHS but since I could not obtain this highly sought after film otherwise, I did pay... but was horrified when I saw that the prices have doubled in less than 2 weeks.I now see that these greedy vultures are charging TWICE the price I paid less than 2 weeks ago. Don't pay the l45 - 2OO do11ar prices these crooks are charging. I was at least greatful to see that the seller I purchased from was not the one who jacked up the price. These prices are beyond criminal. Some as bad as 3 times the price.If they lose sales from just 2 people who read this... then their attempts to gouge will backfire on them far more than their attempt to burn the shoppers. The more sales they lose, will cost them every cent of this gouging profit and much more. They will have burned their own bridges by trying to gouge a quick buck at the shoppers expense. They have no idea just how deep this gouging will have on their sales. So make a list... The following crooks who are charging l45 - 2OO do11ar prices don't deserve any patronage from shoppers for any future products and should be banned for gouging:SusieQwik (l45),w00dysb00ks (l45),Jessicavoo (l7O),DVDp0sterVHS (l95),sv0b0da4o (2OO)I'm sure you can figure out which ones they are. Start keeping a list of crooks like these who viciously gouge shoppers at the most heinous rates... so you can remember who NOT to do business with on future purchases. Just pull out your list of crooks each time you shop and select from someone else, buy a slightly used copy at much lower costs... or wait a few months until another se11er is available before buying.If the studios would put this movie on DVD, these crooks would not be able to give away the VHS tapes.
