I give high marks for Laurence Fishburne since his presence allowed Deep Cover to gel. Had the role gone to, say, Larenz Tate, Deep Cover wouldn't work. Although the film reeks of poor professionalism, Bill Duke effectively infused some style in the story, but I question the accuracy of the details. So, that is why I was lenient enough to give a rating of `7' for Deep Cover. Charles Martin Smith surprisingly did well. Jeff Goldblum was probably bit of a disappointment. Comparing with Donnie Brasco, Deep Cover is a lot better film. Interestingly enough, there is a Playstation 2's Grand Auto Theft III feel to Deep Cover. All in all, I am intrigued enough to see Deep Cover again for a recheck of my opinions.9/10: Starting off awkwardly, Deep Cover gains momentum as soon as Laurence Fishburne hits the screen and is thrown a curveball question by Charles Martin Smith. From there on, Bill Duke shows what style is all about, and he does this with taste of film noir quality. Laurence Fishburne is the coolest ever when he pulls that sexy furtive look and eyes on others. That's really a major turn on for any women, and that's also why his character works the best. Deep Cover is a great film that is filled with twists and turns throughout an intricate maze of Scarface like drug dealing. The plot is quite similar to Donnie Brasco, but Laurence Fishburne and the stylizing of Bill Duke's vision are the reason why the film stands apart. I loved Jeff Goldblum in this one too because he has the ability to look unnatural on-screen, but when he acts, he is so natural himself. All in all, Deep Cover is a wonderful film noir that will get better with additional viewings, and Laurence Fishburne is in a class of his own. I am raising the rating of Deep Cover from `7' to `8'.",4,Laurence Fishburne Is the Coolest.,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,1889,"['Viewed', '6/05', '9/10Rate', '86/05', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'somewhat', 'amateurishly', 'made', 'story', 'good', 'quality', 'give', 'high', 'marks', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'presence', 'allowed', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'gel', 'Had', 'role', 'gone', 'say', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'reeks', 'poor', 'professionalism', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'effectively', 'infused', 'style', 'story', 'question', 'accuracy', 'details', 'So', 'why', 'was', 'lenient', 'enough', 'give', 'rating', '7', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'Charles', 'Martin', 'Smith', 'surprisingly', 'did', 'well', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'was', 'probably', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'Comparing', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'lot', 'better', 'film', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Playstation', '2', 'Grand', 'Auto', 'Theft', 'III', 'feel', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'am', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'see', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'again', 'recheck', 'opinions.9/10', 'Starting', 'off', 'awkwardly', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'gains', 'momentum', 'as', 'soon', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'screen', 'thrown', 'curveball', 'question', 'Charles', 'Martin', 'Smith', 'there', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'what', 'style', 'taste', 'film', 'noir', 'quality', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'coolest', 'ever', 'when', 'sexy', 'furtive', 'look', 'eyes', 'others', 'really', 'major', 'turn', 'women', 'also', 'why', 'character', 'best', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'great', 'film', 'filled', 'twists', 'intricate', 'maze', 'Scarface', 'drug', 'dealing', 'plot', 'quite', 'similar', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'stylizing', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'vision', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'apart', 'loved', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'one', 'too', 'ability', 'look', 'unnatural', 'on-screen', 'when', 'so', 'natural', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'wonderful', 'film', 'noir', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'additional', 'viewings', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'class', 'own', 'am', 'raising', 'rating', 'Deep', 'Cover', '7', '8']",N/A

The story moves very fast, which tells you something.As someone who loves narration, I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne's deep-voiced first-person narrating. He was smooth in this gritty 1990s film noir (neo-noir, as they call it) filled with hard-boiled characters, rough language and some brutal scenes wrapped around a drug story. The early '90s produced some fine neo-noirs.However, as rough as that sounds, they don't overdo the violence but the profanity can make you wince at times. It also has the normal Liberal cheap shots against Republicans: this time George Bush Sr. (The major villain, a South American drug lord is pictured as a friend of Bush's. And, you also get the usual baloney of the U.S. Government and the DEA being bad guys. If that isn't enough, they also play the ""race card"" in here.Yet, I still liked this film. At least they also took a shot at phony Liberals, who Jeff Goldblum's character portrays. Goldblum's ""David Jason"" actually had the best lines in the film, however. He is shown as morally-bankrupt atheist.This movie is unusual in that the main character - Fishburne's ""Russell Stevens"" - goes from good guy to bad guy back to good guy!

Michael Corleone is interesting in the Godfather films because he WANTS to be a good father, husband and man, but he keeps getting dragged into criminal situations that he would avoid if he could.  By contrast, in Scarface Al Pacino portrays a sociopath and I quickly grew tired of his ""I'm the baddest bad guy there is"" act.""Deep Cover"" is a movie that has layers and Laurence portrays these many layers in an acting performance that is one of the best I have ever seen.  His character grew up in the streets.  He watched his father killed and is determined to grow up and stay on the straight and narrow.  He becomes a policeman.  Because of his intelligence and background he is recruited to go undercover to infiltrate a drug ring.  He is hesitant, but Charles Martin Smith's DEA Agent character talks him into it.  Smith has had a great career playing nerdy government types, and you can see that HE can't go infiltrate this drug ring, so Laurence seems a good choice.Under cover Fishburne descends by layers, either becoming or simply pretending to become exactly the kind of man he has tried to avoid his entire life.  Jeff Goldblum is flip and charming in a sociopath lawyer-turned-drug dealer kind of way - reminiscent of Sean Penn in Carlito's Way.  Clarence Williams III is absolutely terrific in his few scenes as the good street cop who doesn't know that Fishburne is actually a cop too, and tries to steer him away from the trouble that he seems headed for.What really makes Deep Cover burn is the performance of Laurence Fishburne.  He is so convincingly conflicted about putting on the act of becoming a drug dealer.  Will he be put into a position to commit serious crimes?  To kill?  After he has spent such a long time undercover becoming a Prince of the street, what will he do when he is offered the chance to move up to the big time in the drug ring?  The climactic scene of ""Deep Cover"" contains one of the most intense acting performances I have ever seen.  It would be worth watching this film only for that scene - but it's a good ride getting there.

467708,A1U48QKVYOQKWG,6305505802,MilesAndTrane,"[19, 20]","Unlike many other films that have taken the undercover cop story and pursued it in a typical fashion, &quot;Deep Cover&quot; takes a tense, intimate approach.  Director Bill Duke creates a quiet masterpiece casting  Laurence Fishburne as a by-the-book cop assigned to infiltrate a major  cocaine empire in Los Angeles.  His connection inside is Jeff Goldblum (in  probably his best performance ever), a supposed clean-shaven Jewish lawyer  who secretly longs for the thrill of a gangster's life while trying to  maintain a family at home.  Duke does not glorify these drug dealers as  Scarface-type millionaires who revel in money &amp; mansions but rather  paints them as quiet, suspicious businessmen who hold no true alliances to  anyone while nesting in pool halls &amp; boxing gyms.  There is never a  moment where any of these characters are seeking fame &amp; fortune.  Instead, they are looking for recognition of their power over both their  friends &amp; foes.Fishburne soon finds himself sucked into the  dealer's life against his will, doing whatever he can to infiltrate the  organization despite how far &quot;deep&quot; he's involved in it (as  opposed to the cliche that the cop decides he likes being a drug dealer).  Meanwhile, Jeff Goldblum also enters  the chaos that's unraveling, learning  to embrace the thug within him that was waiting to emerge.  The film has  the unmistakable look &amp; sound of the early 90's (a good time in film  &amp; music if you ask me), but it has aged well due to sharp  cinematography and a fine soundtrack.  The film has a slightly distracting  sub-plot involving Fishburne and a Christian cop played by Clarence  Williams III, but Williams pulls it off with such conviction that you don't  mind.  There is also a great performance by character actor (and Spike Lee  regular) Roger Guenever Smith as a switchy, mid-level dealer.  Possibly one  of the most overlooked &quot;cop&quot; films of the 90's, and a must-have  for fans of Laurene Fishburne or Jeff Goldblum.",4,"A superior, yet intimate portrait of an undercover cop",945302400,"12 16, 1999",1999,2020,"['many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'taken', 'undercover', 'cop', 'story', 'pursued', 'typical', 'fashion', 'quot', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'quot', 'tense', 'intimate', 'approach', 'Director', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'quiet', 'masterpiece', 'casting', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'by-the-book', 'cop', 'assigned', 'infiltrate', 'major', 'cocaine', 'empire', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'connection', 'inside', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'supposed', 'clean-shaven', 'Jewish', 'lawyer', 'who', 'secretly', 'thrill', 'gangster', 'life', 'trying', 'maintain', 'family', 'home', 'Duke', 'not', 'glorify', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Scarface-type', 'millionaires', 'who', 'revel', 'money', 'amp', 'mansions', 'rather', 'paints', 'quiet', 'suspicious', 'businessmen', 'who', 'hold', 'true', 'alliances', 'anyone', 'nesting', 'pool', 'halls', 'amp', 'boxing', 'gyms', 'never', 'moment', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'seeking', 'fame', 'amp', 'fortune', 'Instead', 'are', 'looking', 'recognition', 'power', 'friends', 'amp', 'foes.Fishburne', 'soon', 'sucked', 'dealer', 'life', 'will', 'doing', 'can', 'infiltrate', 'organization', 'how', 'far', 'quot', 'deep', 'quot', 'involved', 'opposed', 'cliche', 'cop', 'being', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Meanwhile', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'also', 'chaos', 'unraveling', 'learning', 'embrace', 'thug', 'was', 'waiting', 'emerge', 'film', 'unmistakable', 'look', 'amp', 'sound', 'early', '90', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'amp', 'music', 'ask', 'aged', 'well', 'due', 'sharp', 'cinematography', 'fine', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'slightly', 'distracting', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Fishburne', 'Christian', 'cop', 'played', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'Williams', 'off', 'such', 'conviction', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'character', 'actor', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'regular', 'Roger', 'Guenever', 'Smith', 'switchy', 'mid-level', 'dealer', 'Possibly', 'one', 'most', 'overlooked', 'quot', 'cop', 'quot', 'films', '90', 'must-have', 'fans', 'Laurene', 'Fishburne', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum']",N/A

467710,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,6305505802,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[6, 7]","The opening scene of this film is probably the best, and sets up nicely the tone of the remainder of the film.  It is Christmas time and snowing heavily as a father drives his son to the liquor store, snorts some coke, and then asks the boy what he wants for Christmas.  He then robs a liquour store at gunpoint, and is shot in the back in front of his son Russell and next to a fake Santa.  The scene captures a nightmare from a child's perspective, that will haunt and inform him until the end.  It is a nice example of how an effective opening scene can simultaneously set a tone, develop sympathy for a main character, and (naively and simplistically but memorably) explain a contradictory set of motivations that will drive him throughout the film.  He doesn't want to be like his father, so he will want to be straight.  But he knows his father loved him, so he won't be quick to judge someone like his father; and he will be looking for a father figure throughout the film.  The film is really not so much about drugs as about parenting and the relation of the child to the missing parent.He finds a surrogate father, at first, in his racist boss at the DEA, where he works.  The boss sends him on a mission precisely into the kind of life that his own father had warned him to avoid (by words, if not by example, except for the example of getting himself killed).  Yet he continually reminds him that he is doing this effectively to save people like his father.  This first surrogate father seems to be everything his father wasn't: educated, successful, and ""clean.""  Still, just as Russell's father asked him to sit by while he committed a crime, Russell's boss asks him to turn away from an investigation when it gets political.He finds a better father figure in a ""preacher"" cop, who warns him in the same tone as his father had, but unlike his father practiced what he preached.  At the same time, he is one who clearly has faced the demon in himself that he is trying to exorcise in others.  Effectively, the movie is about Russell (the lead character played well by Laurence Fishburne) learning to face up to the fact that nothing he does will redeem his father or bring him back, and growing up by not merely avoiding his father's sins but by passing through and beyond them.  In the end, he is neither a ""straight arrow"" or a ""lost soul"" but is faced with a choice that he poses to the audience, in order to suggest that there are no easy answers to the existential questions faced by those who are caught up in the world that killed Russell's father.  (In a subplot, he develops a relationship with a young hispanic boy whose mother is in effectively the same position as was his own father.)On top of that, Russell is paired with a ""brother"" of sorts, a lawyer played by Jeff Goldblum, who is in many ways his mirror image.  Unlike Russell, David (Goldblum) has everything: a beautiful family, a nice house, a good job.  He doesn't do crime, like Russell's father, out of necessity but out of a fascination with the other side, with the criminal element and even (in a not entirely developed but intriguing sub theme) with the idea of being black (he has a black lover, he is fascinated nearly to the point of an erotic attraction by Russell - who he describes in action as a ""beautiful beast"").  Unlike Russell's father who hated the life of crime that he felt obligated to pursue, David gives up his family to pursue the dark life of crime for its own sake. It is against this ""double"" that Russell defines himself -- refusing in the end to be a criminal and insisting that he is still a cop.Sure it's simplistic, but it's a fun and entertaining film, that plays with the psychology of motivation and with moral questions that are inevitable in the ""war on drugs"" (or the ""war on terror,"" for that matter).  The directing is solid and some scenes like the first one are quite good.  The script is engaging and mostly clever, with convincing characterizations.  The reversals in the story and the fact it uses a grand scheme to address highly personal issues of morality and choice are to be expected from a film that was co-scripted by Michael Tolkin -- who also wrote Altman's ""The Player"" and wrote and directed ""The Rapture.""  There are some extraneous side plots here and there, and both the DEA and the mafia didn't seem very well developed or plausible.  For that matter, the idea that with a little bit of luck and a charismatic ""tough"" attitude one can get to the top of the drug mafia food chain in a matter of weeks or months is sheer fantasy (of a sort that makes ""Miami Vice"" look realistic).  Still, the fantasy elements are really subordinate to the personal story of a boy facing up the consequences and implications of a tragic childhood event.  Worth seeing if you can get in to this kind of thing.",4,"Solid and well-acted 90's ""war on drugs"" fantasy - implausible but entertaining",1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,4836,"['opening', 'scene', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'up', 'nicely', 'tone', 'remainder', 'film', 'Christmas', 'time', 'snowing', 'heavily', 'father', 'son', 'liquor', 'store', 'coke', 'then', 'boy', 'what', 'Christmas', 'then', 'liquour', 'store', 'gunpoint', 'shot', 'back', 'front', 'son', 'Russell', 'next', 'fake', 'Santa', 'scene', 'nightmare', 'child', 'perspective', 'will', 'haunt', 'inform', 'end', 'nice', 'example', 'how', 'effective', 'opening', 'scene', 'can', 'simultaneously', 'set', 'tone', 'develop', 'sympathy', 'main', 'character', 'naively', 'simplistically', 'memorably', 'explain', 'contradictory', 'set', 'motivations', 'will', 'drive', 'film', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'father', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'straight', 'father', 'loved', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'quick', 'judge', 'someone', 'father', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'father', 'figure', 'film', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'drugs', 'parenting', 'relation', 'child', 'missing', 'parent.He', 'surrogate', 'father', 'first', 'racist', 'boss', 'DEA', 'where', 'boss', 'mission', 'precisely', 'kind', 'life', 'own', 'father', 'had', 'warned', 'avoid', 'words', 'not', 'example', 'example', 'getting', 'killed', 'continually', 'doing', 'effectively', 'save', 'people', 'father', 'first', 'surrogate', 'father', 'be', 'everything', 'father', 'was', ""n't"", 'educated', 'successful', 'clean', 'Still', 'just', 'Russell', 'father', 'asked', 'sit', 'committed', 'crime', 'Russell', 'boss', 'turn', 'away', 'investigation', 'when', 'political.He', 'better', 'father', 'figure', 'preacher', 'cop', 'who', 'same', 'tone', 'father', 'had', 'father', 'practiced', 'what', 'preached', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'who', 'clearly', 'faced', 'demon', 'trying', 'exorcise', 'others', 'Effectively', 'movie', 'about', 'Russell', 'lead', 'character', 'played', 'well', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'learning', 'face', 'up', 'fact', 'nothing', 'will', 'redeem', 'father', 'bring', 'back', 'growing', 'up', 'not', 'merely', 'avoiding', 'father', 'sins', 'passing', 'end', 'straight', 'arrow', 'lost', 'soul', 'faced', 'choice', 'audience', 'order', 'suggest', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'existential', 'questions', 'faced', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'world', 'killed', 'Russell', 'father', 'subplot', 'relationship', 'young', 'hispanic', 'boy', 'mother', 'effectively', 'same', 'position', 'was', 'own', 'father', 'top', 'Russell', 'paired', 'brother', 'sorts', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'mirror', 'image', 'Unlike', 'Russell', 'David', 'Goldblum', 'everything', 'beautiful', 'family', 'nice', 'house', 'good', 'job', ""n't"", 'do', 'crime', 'Russell', 'father', 'necessity', 'fascination', 'other', 'side', 'criminal', 'element', 'even', 'not', 'entirely', 'developed', 'intriguing', 'sub', 'theme', 'idea', 'being', 'black', 'black', 'lover', 'fascinated', 'nearly', 'point', 'erotic', 'attraction', 'Russell', 'who', 'action', 'beautiful', 'beast', 'Unlike', 'Russell', 'father', 'who', 'hated', 'life', 'crime', 'felt', 'obligated', 'pursue', 'David', 'up', 'family', 'pursue', 'dark', 'life', 'crime', 'own', 'sake', 'double', 'Russell', 'refusing', 'end', 'be', 'criminal', 'insisting', 'still', 'cop.Sure', 'simplistic', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'psychology', 'motivation', 'moral', 'questions', 'are', 'inevitable', 'war', 'drugs', 'war', 'terror', 'matter', 'directing', 'solid', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'script', 'engaging', 'mostly', 'clever', 'convincing', 'characterizations', 'reversals', 'story', 'fact', 'grand', 'scheme', 'address', 'highly', 'personal', 'issues', 'morality', 'choice', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'was', 'co-scripted', 'Michael', 'Tolkin', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Altman', 'Player', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Rapture', 'are', 'extraneous', 'side', 'plots', 'here', 'there', 'DEA', 'mafia', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'plausible', 'matter', 'idea', 'little', 'bit', 'luck', 'charismatic', 'tough', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'top', 'drug', 'mafia', 'food', 'chain', 'matter', 'weeks', 'months', 'sheer', 'fantasy', 'sort', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'look', 'realistic', 'Still', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'are', 'really', 'subordinate', 'personal', 'story', 'boy', 'facing', 'up', 'consequences', 'implications', 'tragic', 'childhood', 'event', 'seeing', 'can', 'get', 'kind', 'thing']",N/A
467711,A1X910WAOVYV8M,6305505802,"Nathan ""Cawntry-fried Calypso Beach Bum""","[13, 14]","I, like so many other people who grew up in the time I did, was first attracted to this film solely through the title song by Dr. Dre on the soundtrack to the film.  It was ridiculous how much I heard that song get played all over the radio and the hype it surrounded the movie with during that spring of 1992.  In fact, it, in many ways, has outlasted the film itself in terms of pop culture's memory.  And that is actually a shame.This a superior thriller, taking the undercover cop story and crafting a tension-drenched and surprisingly subtle movie.  And though it begins to lose its bottom by the end and becomes a little contrived, for the first three quarters of the movie it is expertise and a whole lot more unpredictable than most films of its genre.  Veteran actor Laurence Fishburne stars, in, surprisingly, his first lead role, as an L.A. cop who is assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a major cocaine empire in Los Angeles.  It is a job he reluctantly takes; as a child he witnessed his junkie father killed while pulling a stickup on Christmas Eve.  The flashback of this is shown as the opening scene and is one of the most disturbing in the film, as the young child, who had just listened to his father ask him what he wanted for Christmas, watches the whole bloody incident in horror and pain from the parked car.  This plays heavily on his conscience and his psychic well-being as the film goes on.  He goes everywhere from the seedy streets of the inner-cities and ghettos as a cocaine dealer and manages to get all the way to the highest ranks of the organization.  He does this by working his way into the circle of a mid-level drug distributor.  A supposedly clean-shaven man who owns a house, has a beautiful wife, and an eight-year-old daughter whom he practices the multiplication tables with in the morning.  This key character is played with nervous ingenuity by Jeff Goldblum, in one of his most impressive performances, and is the symbol of the disturbing depths that a man's greed can go to.All of this, while extremely strong assets, are more or less pretty routine in films such as these.  Director Bill Duke, however, manages to take it a step further and elevates this film with style and class.  He has Fishburne narrate the story and allows the langage to be poetic and colorful, something that derives from classic 1940s film noir.  My favorite line in the narration is on Fishburne's first day on the streets as a dealer when the voice-over says ""The great thing about life on the streets is you know how it's gonna be.  It's always the same.  It's always getting worse.""  The strongest and most potent scenes in the film are the ones dealing directly with Fishburne's struggles with the moral decisions he must make.  The ""deeper"" involved he gets in the criminal life, the more he begins to realize the cold and inhuman manner with which the government and authorities have been cast.  It's not that he decides he likes being a drug dealer, it's actually the exact opposite.  He becomes more and more determined to infiltrate the organization, by any means necessary, no matter how violent and chaotic it gets.  As I said, the film does begin to lose its bottom by the end, as the plot becomes slightly overblown, however, I won't go into details as it would spoil some surprises.  And overall the courage and conviction of the performances causes you to forget the lackluster final quarter.  Roger Ebert said that this was ""a drama disguised as a thriller"" and I will have to agree with that statement.  It is much more dependent on characters than on action scenes, and that is what makes it so much better and more intelligent that most of its genre.  Everywhere in this film there is the unmistakeable look and feel of the early '90s, whether it's in the great soundtrack, the sharp cinematography, the fast-paced editing and camera movements, or the screen sweeps that segue from scene to scene.  It was a good time in movies and music, if you ask me, but this film has aged much better than its closest companion 'New Jack City' has.

One person told me that you don't have a complete DVD collection without Scarface. Well, I beg to differ!. Deep Cover is such an intelligently made movie that I feel that your DVD collection must include this movie. Laurence Fishburne's performance was riveting! Jeff Goldblum was fabulous as well. Fishburne plays a moralistic cop who goes undercover to catch a very powerful drug lord; hoping to stop drug trafficking into this country. Unfortunately, he has to do the one thing he is trying to stop; the selling of drugs. He becomes a drug dealer himself in an effort to make contact with a powerful drug lord. He is so good at being a drug dealer that he is not sure if he is a ""cop pretending to be a drug dealer or a drug dealer pretending to be a cop!"" He finds himself caught up in murder as well as drugs. He,later, meets up with his future partner in crime, Goldblum, who is a amoralistic lawyer who has been in drug dealer prior to his relationship with Fishburne. Fishburne,later, discovers that he has been bamboozled by the chief DEA. The DEA is really hoping to be in some form of partnership with this drug lord who they want Fishburne to make contact with. Fishburne finds himself circling an emotional, self awareness drain as he takes a sniff of crack and a drink of alcohol( something he swore he would ""never do"") as he realizes taht he has been used. He was driven by the fact that as a child he saw his drug addicted father get shot after he robbed a store and shot the store employee. The movie consists of several unknown actors who contributes to the success of this movie. Oh, I should mention Clarence Williams III who was is known for his role in the original TV series ""The Mod Squad."" Williams' plays a religious DEA cop who is determined to bring Fishburne to justice, never knowing that he is an undercover agent.

467716,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305505802,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","Strong performances by Laurence Fishburne and Jeff Goldblum dominate this story of a cop who goes undercover as a drug dealer, in order to ""Do some good,"" in ""Deep Cover,"" directed by Bill Duke.  When he is ten years old,  Russell Stevens Jr. witnesses the killing of his drug addicted father, who  is shot as he attempts to rob a liquor store, while his son waits in the  car.  Twenty years later, Russell (Fishburne) is a cop, making good on the  promise he made to himself the day he watched his father die; he wasn't  going to end up like that.  And he was going to make a difference.  When  Gerald Carver (Charles Martin Smith), an agent with the DEA, approaches him  with the offer of an assignment to go under cover as a drug dealer, to help  them dismantle the South American pipeline supplying most of the West  Coast, and ultimately bring those individuals responsible to justice,  Russell accepts; but only after coming to terms with his initial misgivings  about taking on such a role.  He'll be in so deep, he'll actually have to  become another person; he'll be living the life full time, and it may take  a year or more to accomplish what they set out to do.  He takes the name  John Hull, and goes in.  This is a decent action film with a pretty  good story, but there isn't much here that hasn't been done before; what  sets this one apart from many others like it, however, are the two stars.  Fishburne, especially (still billed here as ""Larry""), takes a fairly  routine character and gives him substance.  He has such a commanding screen  presence that it makes everything that goes down seem credible; he  seemingly has the innate ability to know his character from the inside out,  and what a difference that can make, especially to a movie like this.  Goldblum, as well, takes his character of attorney David Jason to the  limit.  He lends a smarmy edginess to him, as he gradually takes his  initial cool resolve to the brink of reason, then on past to the point of  no return.  Smith is not nearly as effective as the Princeton educated  agent with clean hands, who drives Russell to depths from which he may  never return, but Fishburne is such a good actor that it lifts Smith's  performance to a higher level, too.  Clarence Williams III, as Taft, the  cop with the penchant for scripture, is believable enough, but there is  something disquieting about watching him; he never blinks, which can be  distracting at times.  The supporting cast includes Victoria Dillard  (Betty), Sydney Lassick (Gopher), Gregory Sierra (Felix), Roger Guenveur  Smith (Eddie), Rene Assa (Guzman), and Arthur Mendoza (Gallegos).  Duke  gives a brisk pace to the film, and maintains it throughout, but keeps it  all rather routine and unimaginative.  ""Deep Cover"" then, is a reasonably  satisfying movie, due mainly to the aforementioned performances, which  really make it seem more substantial than it is.",3,Strong Performances Take It Deep,961632000,"06 22, 2000",2000,2914,"['Strong', 'performances', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'dominate', 'story', 'cop', 'who', 'undercover', 'drug', 'dealer', 'order', 'Do', 'good', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'directed', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'When', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'Russell', 'Stevens', 'Jr.', 'killing', 'drug', 'addicted', 'father', 'who', 'shot', 'rob', 'liquor', 'store', 'son', 'waits', 'car', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Russell', 'Fishburne', 'cop', 'making', 'good', 'promise', 'made', 'day', 'watched', 'father', 'die', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'end', 'up', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'difference', 'When', 'Gerald', 'Carver', 'Charles', 'Martin', 'Smith', 'agent', 'DEA', 'offer', 'assignment', 'go', 'cover', 'drug', 'dealer', 'help', 'dismantle', 'South', 'American', 'pipeline', 'supplying', 'most', 'West', 'Coast', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'individuals', 'responsible', 'justice', 'Russell', 'only', 'coming', 'terms', 'initial', 'misgivings', 'taking', 'role', ""'ll"", 'be', 'so', 'deep', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'have', 'become', 'person', ""'ll"", 'be', 'living', 'life', 'full', 'time', 'may', 'take', 'year', 'more', 'accomplish', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'name', 'John', 'Hull', 'decent', 'action', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'before', 'what', 'one', 'apart', 'many', 'others', 'however', 'are', 'two', 'stars', 'Fishburne', 'especially', 'still', 'billed', 'here', 'Larry', 'fairly', 'routine', 'character', 'substance', 'commanding', 'screen', 'presence', 'everything', 'down', 'seem', 'credible', 'seemingly', 'innate', 'ability', 'know', 'character', 'inside', 'what', 'difference', 'can', 'make', 'especially', 'movie', 'Goldblum', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'attorney', 'David', 'Jason', 'limit', 'smarmy', 'edginess', 'gradually', 'initial', 'cool', 'resolve', 'brink', 'reason', 'then', 'past', 'point', 'return', 'Smith', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'Princeton', 'educated', 'agent', 'clean', 'hands', 'who', 'Russell', 'depths', 'may', 'never', 'return', 'Fishburne', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'Smith', 'performance', 'higher', 'level', 'too', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'Taft', 'cop', 'penchant', 'scripture', 'believable', 'enough', 'something', 'disquieting', 'watching', 'never', 'blinks', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'times', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Victoria', 'Dillard', 'Betty', 'Sydney', 'Lassick', 'Gopher', 'Gregory', 'Sierra', 'Felix', 'Roger', 'Guenveur', 'Smith', 'Eddie', 'Rene', 'Assa', 'Guzman', 'Arthur', 'Mendoza', 'Gallegos', 'Duke', 'brisk', 'pace', 'film', 'rather', 'routine', 'unimaginative', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'then', 'reasonably', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'due', 'mainly', 'aforementioned', 'performances', 'really', 'make', 'more', 'substantial']",N/A
467717,ALS0041SS519N,6305505802,ROGER L. FOREMAN,"[3, 3]","I haven't seen this movie for quite a few years, but I became a huge fan of Laurence Fishburne because of it.  I remembered loving the dialogue of the film and the intrinsic moral struggles of Fishburne's character.  I had also forgotten that Michael Tolkin (THE PLAYER, AMONG THE DEAD--a novel, and CHANGING LANES) wrote the screenplay.  All until I purchased it on DVD last week and watched it Friday evening.  Man, that's a lot to forget. . . .Fishburne is simply spectacular in a quietly disturbing and understated way.  His eyes tell much of the story.  One of the reviewers called him ""broding,"" and this is a good description.  His character doesn't want the assignment but flourishes in it.  Doing a bad thing well has its own rewards and punishments.  Goldblum--hardly one's first thought at Oscar time each year--is excellent as Fishburne's ""partner"" in crime.  Everybody else is, at the very least, very good:  Fishburne's superior officer, his lady friend, the drug dealers, the cop/preacher chasing Fishburne.Tolkin does an admirable job of mixing the music of the movie, fairly heavy hip hop (at least for my taste) with its dialogue.  Fishburne's lines as narrator, at times, are very rhythmic and poetic, blending with the undercurrent of music.  He is also fairly profound at moments, going well beyond his profession (whether as cop or drug dealer) to be a father figure to the little boy who lived across the hall.  The only argument one could really make is that Tolkin's dialogue is a bit too ""preachy"" at times and possibly a bit too profound in some pressure-packed moments--would these thugs come up with these lines in these situations?  It doesn't matter to me.  I'll give Tolkin bonus points for writing a clever, smart, quick screenplay, complete with the moral ambiguities he seems to love and the less-than-happily-ever-after ending we all should have expected from him.Bottom line:  this is one of the best crime/drug movies I can think of, and Fishburne's performance (really his break-out one) is well worth a rental, at the very least.  It is ""out of the box"" enough and performed so well as to be highly recommended.",5,I'd Forgotten How Good This Movie Is. . . !,1042416000,"01 13, 2003",2003,2151,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'remembered', 'loving', 'dialogue', 'film', 'intrinsic', 'moral', 'struggles', 'Fishburne', 'character', 'had', 'also', 'forgotten', 'Michael', 'Tolkin', 'THE', 'PLAYER', 'AMONG', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'novel', 'CHANGING', 'LANES', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'last', 'week', 'watched', 'Friday', 'evening', 'Man', 'lot', 'forget', '.Fishburne', 'simply', 'spectacular', 'quietly', 'disturbing', 'understated', 'way', 'eyes', 'tell', 'much', 'story', 'One', 'reviewers', 'called', 'broding', 'good', 'description', 'character', ""n't"", 'want', 'assignment', 'flourishes', 'Doing', 'bad', 'thing', 'well', 'own', 'rewards', 'punishments', 'Goldblum', 'hardly', 'one', 'first', 'thought', 'Oscar', 'time', 'year', 'excellent', 'Fishburne', 'partner', 'crime', 'Everybody', 'else', 'very', 'least', 'very', 'good', 'Fishburne', 'superior', 'officer', 'lady', 'friend', 'drug', 'dealers', 'cop/preacher', 'chasing', 'Fishburne.Tolkin', 'admirable', 'job', 'mixing', 'music', 'movie', 'fairly', 'heavy', 'hip', 'hop', 'least', 'taste', 'dialogue', 'Fishburne', 'lines', 'narrator', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'rhythmic', 'poetic', 'blending', 'undercurrent', 'music', 'also', 'fairly', 'profound', 'moments', 'going', 'well', 'profession', 'cop', 'drug', 'dealer', 'be', 'father', 'figure', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'lived', 'hall', 'only', 'argument', 'one', 'could', 'really', 'make', 'Tolkin', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'too', 'preachy', 'times', 'possibly', 'bit', 'too', 'profound', 'pressure-packed', 'moments', 'would', 'thugs', 'come', 'up', 'lines', 'situations', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Tolkin', 'bonus', 'points', 'writing', 'clever', 'smart', 'quick', 'screenplay', 'complete', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'love', 'less-than-happily-ever-after', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'him.Bottom', 'line', 'one', 'best', 'crime/drug', 'movies', 'can', 'think', 'Fishburne', 'performance', 'really', 'break-out', 'one', 'well', 'rental', 'very', 'least', 'box', 'enough', 'performed', 'so', 'well', 'be', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
