1019048,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B000I405E4,Anticlimacus,"[1, 1]","I blame no one but myself for not loving this movie the first time around, as Re-Cycle is the posterchild for viewer-induced disappointment. For me personally, I expected something that mirrored the Silent Hill videogames - and considering how those Californian simpletons mucked up their attempt at a Silent Hill movie, I was drooling at the mouth to see if Re-Cycle succeeded where they had failed.Obviously, I deluded myself into believing that Re-Cycle was trying to be something it was never meant to be. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed after an initial viewing. Where were all of the incredibly disturbing, blood-soaked images? Where were the detailed puzzles? Where were the violent death scenes? They were nowhere - and I was angry that Re-Cycle turned out to be its own movie with its own themes. Go figure.Months later I started to think of the movie more and more. I thought to myself, ""Yeah, that movie was mediocre, but that one scene was really cool."" Then I pondered, ""Wow, that other scene was sweet too, and that other one was awesome."" Eventually, I decided to give it another go. That ""other go"" happened last night, and I ended up watching one heck of a movie.The fantasy elements kick in at around the 40-minute mark, but Re-Cycle doesn't stoop to boring you during the opening segments with superfluous exposition. From minute one it grabs you with some well-executed (albeit conventional) horror elements that become much less conventional during a second viewing when you identify references to the main theme of the film.Once the fantasy elements hit, Re-Cycle becomes a non-stop fantasy adventure. I cannot remember a horror film in recent memory with such relentless pacing. Much of this is owed to its fragmented transport of the lead protagonists. They may escape one danger by going through a door, but on the other side of that door is a completely different environment that is no less perilous. Some have criticized Re-Cycle for being scattershot and unfocused, but I would respectfully disagree considering how almost every single horror element references back to the overarching theme of the film. It's no masterpiece, but it works quite well - especially when you identify the references upon a second viewing.I truly feel sorry for Hollywood fanboys. East Asian cinema already mops the floor with Western cinema in terms of scriptwriting, cinematography, hand-to-hand action sequences, sound, youthful acting talent, and sheer originality (just to name a few). Now, they've given us a fantasy film that mops the floor with the excessively bloated, overrated, self-indulgent twaddle known as Lord of the Rings.Take the ending to Re-Cycle as an example. The finale within the Transit realm is quite simply the most intense, incredible fantasy sequence I've ever seen. I must admit that I've rewatched that scene about 30 times over the past few days. I'm totally, unequivocally ADDICTED to it. It's so much better than any scene in LOTR.Better yet, I didn't have to slug through a bunch of generic characters speaking painfully generic dialogue while walking very, very slowly within vast landscapes for 600 friggin minutes like LOTR. Nor did I have to sit through half a dozen superfluous, drawn-out endings stacked one on top of the other. That might be the formula for winning Oscars and attracting moviegoers who like their fantasy films as vanilla as humanly possible, but I personally like my fantasy films with some - oh, I don't know - emotion. In a nutshell, Re-Cycle elicited some excitement (especially near the end), whereas LOTR stagnated in a realm of perpetual boredom.On a side note, I can't really understand why Oxide Pang is so relentlessly criticized (to the point of unreasonableness) by so many people. It's exceedingly ironic that the people who complain about his scripts are the very same people who shout ""masterpiece"" when referring to those Japanese horror flicks from the 1960s (which will remain nameless) that have some of the worst scriptwriting in the history of horror cinema. In addition, Oxide's use of camera and sound is exceptional, and probably second only to Ryuhei Kitamura or Christopher Doyle.Nothing this guy does is ever good enough for anyone, even though his movies are better than 90% of everyone else's. Diary, The Detective, Abnormal Beauty, Re-Cycle, The Eye, and Revenge (from the Bangkok Haunted anthology) combine to form the most impressive recent horror/thriller portfolio outside of Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Compare Oxide Pang to any American horror director and guy becomes an instant legend.",4,"Huge Disappointment Upon First Viewing, Huge Triumph Upon the Second",1233273600,"01 30,

1019049,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000I405E4,Anton Ilinski,"[4, 4]","Re-cycle is a relatively new tour de force by Pang brothers and probably one of their last movies made in Hong Kong. After Re-cycle Oxide Pang shot Diary - a curious little psychological thriller and then both he and his brother Danny moved to Hollywood. Hope they'll succeed there because after all these years of making really nice movies it'll be a shame if they blow their chance there.To tell the truth Re-cycle is a film like no other I've seen. I wouldn't be able to find a similar one neither in Asian cinema nor in Western cinema. Maybe if you need some resembling I'd recall What Dreams May Come with Robin Williams and The Cell with Jennifer Lopez although the second one stands pretty far. You won't find a single similar film in the Pangs' filmography. Neither their ""Bangkok trilogy"" nor their ""The Eye trilogy"" nor Ab-normal Beauty, nor The Tesseract are close to what they invented here. They invented, some people invested, and finally we got a real piece of art, an outstanding film, a picture which you ought to see even if you're not a big fan of Hong Kong cinema and of Pang brothers in particular. It's like Citizen Kane or The Matrix - you've got to see it to... just to see it. In no way I'm comparing Re-cycle to the above-mentioned two, it's just that this movie is something very rare nowdays, a movie made with sheer devotion, bright imagination and limitless fantasy. It's really like no other. You may not like the story-line or CGI (they're great though) or acting, but anyway if you want to see something fresh - try this one.It's useless to retell the story, I'd just say a few words that pretty much say it all - a young writer (played by beautiful Angelica Lee from Koma and The Eye) finds herself in her imaginary world. What at first looks like a world of dreams or illusions then turns out a world of all things rejected, refused and negated - from thoughts to people. Certainly Lee's character has some mission to accomplish in this world, and I have to say this place is full of peril and is not so easy to leave.Two-disc Hong Kong edition has great booklets with some art design where you're shown what you (along with Angelica Lee's character) are going to encounter in the world of Re-cycle (believe me even the sketches impress a lot, not mentioning the movie itself). Here are some places' names, and the rest is up to your imagination untill you see the film: Playground of the Damned, Forest of Hang, Toy Ruin, City of Books, Ghost's Bridge, Embryo Tunnel... I say you may not like Re-cycle after all, but you'll definately appraise its ingenuity. By the way I'll be much surprised if it's not in a remake list of all major Hollywood studios. And just as a remark - Re-cycle became a real hit in Asia and was very warmly received at Cannes film festival.",4,ARE YOU IN CHIME WITH YOUR INNER WORLD?

Erland,"[1, 2]","As I sat back and prepared myself for my first viewing of `Re-Cycle', the '06 supernatural / horror offering courtesy of the Pang brothers my expectations where set on experiencing stellar special effects, a somewhat challenging storyline and a few thrills and chills now and then. All that along with the presence of the beautiful Angelica Lee in the starring role was sure to provide some worthwhile cinematic entertainment. What I didn't expect was a modern, Buddhist version of Dante Alighieri's `Inferno' along with a biting social commentary concerning abortion and veneration of one's ancestors.Synopsis: Young and successful novelist Ting-Yin (Angelica Lee) decides to expand her literary horizons by applying her trade to the horror genre. A happenstance comment made by a friend upon learning of her decision is all but ignored but not surprisingly serves as a foreshadowing of what is to come. The comment you ask? It's ""they say writing about spirits brings them to life"". A prophetic utterance if ever I heard one.Soon eerie, inexplicable things begin to happen while she's alone at home (isn't that always the case). At first she attempts to ignore these happenings, probably attributing them to an overactive imagination but when crumbled, discarded pages of her new book begin to float out of the trash can and flatten out she begins to lose it. In an attempt to maintain her sanity Ting-Yin leaves her apartment, descends in the elevator and walks out the front door. Unfortunately the anticipated relief she hoped to find in the outside world turns out to be something totally other and unrecognizable.Ting-Yin has entered into a world reserved for abandoned things, which just happens to also include all the characters and storyline contained on the crumpled pages of her novel discarded and thrown in the trash. Like Dante in his classic journey through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, frightened Ting-Yin is in way over her head until she meets an enchanting little eight year old girl in a red coat who in Virgil-like fashion serves as her tour guide through this haunted landscape that appears to be a strange combination of graveyard and dump.Not wanting to delve too deeply into the storyline and spoil it for anyone I'll just say that an unexpected relationship begins to form between the two as they journey through the dangerous terrain towards ""the Transit"", the only exist from this phantom world back into Ting-Yin's universe. There are numerous lessons to be learned along the way, the most important coming from the little girl with no name who Ting-Yin eventually names Ting-Yu.Critique: `Re-Cycle' is an amazing and complicated film that can be enjoyed on a number of levels, containing all the special effects and haunting imagery you could ask for.

1019053,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B000I405E4,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[1, 1]","Mainstream horror films today seems so derivative that finding a movie that simply tries to break out of the mold is in itself a treat.  'Re-cycle' isn't groundbreaking, but its weaknesses aren't from repeating (or re-cycling, ha!) the same worn-out storylines.  Instead, the directors, Oxide and Danny Pang, smash together elements of several sub-genres of horror to come up with a creepy fun movie with scenes of intense and interesting imagery.Angelica Lee is Tsui Ting-Yin, a successful writer who's last effort was made into a wildly popular film, and whose agent has alerted the press that her next novel is a supernatural tale called 'Re-Cycle'.  In a rather heavy-on-the-expository press conference, Tsui is asked if she is afraid of the superstition that writing about the supernatural may invoke it.  After a moment's pause, she claims to be intrigued by the idea.Sure enough, her writing efforts bring on bizarre events, and during this section the directors succeed at creating an extremely creepy mood.  Eventually, Tsui transitions out of reality and into a dream world of 'the abandoned', where she is pursued (and assisted) by the abandoned creations of the real world as she tries to get back home again.  Here the movie by turns seems a mish-mash of zombie flicks, Japanese ghost stories, and Asian fairy tales a la Miyazaki's anime, which is a rush at first, but by the films final act feels crammed and directionless and just too much.!!!!*** SPOILERS***!!!Some viewers may find the ending difficult or exploitive, as it deals with the emotional effects of an abortion Tsui had years before.  I think this will depend on each individual's perspective, and those that are uncomfortable with this theme may want to pass on the movie.  Personally, while I tend to agree with the overall message that abortion may have far-reaching consequences, I'm not sure this is the venue for that argument.  Additionally, the scenes are quite emotional, which could be painful for some viewers.!!!!*** END SPOILER ***!!!Despite these weaknesses, and a few other worn out horror film conventions, 'Re-Cycle' still delivers several spooky moments and offers up a bizarre dreamscape in the land of 'The Abandoned'.  It'll be interesting to see if the Pang Brothers revisit this type of horror tale again - and prune a few of the elements until it doesn't feel quite so overwhelming.  As it is, the film's positives outweigh the negatives, but I also feel that it could have been much, much more.",4,Creepy fun.,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,2497,"['Mainstream', 'horror', 'films', 'today', 'so', 'derivative', 'finding', 'movie', 'simply', 'break', 'mold', 'treat', ""'Re-cycle"", ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'weaknesses', 'are', ""n't"", 'repeating', 're-cycling', 'ha', 'same', 'worn-out', 'storylines', 'Instead', 'directors', 'Oxide', 'Danny', 'Pang', 'smash', 'together', 'elements', 'several', 'sub-genres', 'horror', 'come', 'up', 'creepy', 'fun', 'movie', 'scenes', 'intense', 'interesting', 'imagery.Angelica', 'Lee', 'Tsui', 'Ting-Yin', 'successful', 'writer', 'who', 'last', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'wildly', 'popular', 'film', 'agent', 'alerted', 'press', 'next', 'novel', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'called', ""'Re-Cycle"", 'rather', 'heavy-on-the-expository', 'press', 'conference', 'Tsui', 'asked', 'afraid', 'superstition', 'writing', 'supernatural', 'may', 'invoke', 'moment', 'pause', 'be', 'intrigued', 'idea.Sure', 'enough', 'writing', 'efforts', 'bring', 'bizarre', 'events', 'section', 'directors', 'succeed', 'creating', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'mood', 'Eventually', 'Tsui', 'reality', 'dream', 'world', ""'the"", 'abandoned', 'where', 'pursued', 'assisted', 'abandoned', 'creations', 'real', 'world', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'again', 'Here', 'movie', 'turns', 'mish-mash', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'Japanese', 'ghost', 'stories', 'Asian', 'fairy', 'la', 'Miyazaki', 'anime', 'rush', 'first', 'films', 'final', 'act', 'feels', 'crammed', 'directionless', 'just', 'too', 'much.', '***', 'SPOILERS***', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'ending', 'difficult', 'exploitive', 'emotional', 'effects', 'abortion', 'Tsui', 'had', 'years', 'think', 'will', 'depend', 'individual', 'perspective', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'theme', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'movie', 'Personally', 'tend', 'agree', 'overall', 'message', 'abortion', 'may', 'have', 'far-reaching', 'consequences', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'venue', 'argument', 'Additionally', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'emotional', 'could', 'be', 'painful', 'viewers.', '***', 'END', 'SPOILER', '***', 'weaknesses', 'few', 'other', 'worn', 'out', 'horror', 'film', 'conventions', ""'Re-Cycle"", 'still', 'several', 'spooky', 'moments', 'up', 'bizarre', 'dreamscape', 'land', ""'The"", 'Abandoned', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'revisit', 'type', 'horror', 'tale', 'again', 'prune', 'few', 'elements', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'film', 'positives', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'also', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'more']",Re-cycle (Director's Edition) 2 disc/gift set
1019054,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B000I405E4,bunnyrabbit4,"[33, 38]","THE PROS....This film starts out with some of the best chill/thrill/ photography that I have seen in a long time. It also works off the stark beauty of the lead actress whose subtle emotional displays are frequently seen in close up. Blu-ray is usually showcased with nature scenes, but its ability to capture the human face is what most interests me. The special effects here are also beautiful and run seamlessly along side of a variety of camera and editing techniques. It is a feast of the small stuff done well, like chopping a few seconds of film out of an action sequence to create a feeling of dimensional shift and unreality. Each scene is artistically framed for maximum effect. Especially in the begining of the film, the edits literally keeping you jumping. Elements of traditional Asian masks are blended with simple make up techniques to keep the film from becoming bogged down with too much flashy CGI. Often I find that CGI films have one or two scenes that everyone talks about and once you've seen them the funs over. This film uses a variety of subtle color shifts, camera movements and sets to approach each scene with a fresh cinematic voice. Speaking of voice, you really don't have to worry about the film being in Cantonese. Once the films gets going there is minimal dialog.THE CONS....I was so visually engaged by the film that I did not began to worry about the plot until the last 15 or 20 minutes. Even after the social issue theme intruded on what had been a very good visual ride, the film managed to shift gears again at the very end and give me something to mull over as the credits rolled. But that last 15 could have been so much better. If I could edit this film I would take out a jarring, sugary sweet montage sequence near the end. I felt like it removed me too far from the film's psychological edginess. Exiting the lead character from her strange world while her pain over a loss was at its zenith would have made the film and last few minutes work much better. Horror films that seek to send moral or emotional messages frequently make this kind of mistake since the message is invariably part of the plot resolution. I agree with another reviewer that the script deserves a three, but the photography and CGI are 5 star. I can't wait to share this one with friends.",4,I'm Glad I own it inspite of its flaws,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,2309,"['PROS', '.This', 'film', 'out', 'best', 'chill/thrill/', 'photography', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'also', 'stark', 'beauty', 'lead', 'actress', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'displays', 'are', 'frequently', 'seen', 'close', 'Blu-ray', 'usually', 'showcased', 'nature', 'scenes', 'ability', 'capture', 'human', 'face', 'what', 'most', 'interests', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'beautiful', 'run', 'seamlessly', 'side', 'variety', 'camera', 'editing', 'techniques', 'feast', 'small', 'stuff', 'done', 'well', 'chopping', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'action', 'sequence', 'create', 'feeling', 'dimensional', 'shift', 'unreality', 'scene', 'artistically', 'framed', 'maximum', 'effect', 'Especially', 'begining', 'film', 'edits', 'literally', 'keeping', 'jumping', 'Elements', 'traditional', 'Asian', 'masks', 'are', 'blended', 'simple', 'make', 'up', 'techniques', 'keep', 'film', 'becoming', 'bogged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'flashy', 'CGI', 'Often', 'find', 'CGI', 'films', 'have', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'talks', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'funs', 'film', 'variety', 'subtle', 'color', 'shifts', 'camera', 'movements', 'sets', 'approach', 'scene', 'fresh', 'cinematic', 'voice', 'Speaking', 'voice', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'film', 'being', 'Cantonese', 'films', 'going', 'minimal', 'dialog.THE', 'CONS', '.I', 'was', 'so', 'visually', 'engaged', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'began', 'worry', 'plot', 'last', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'Even', 'social', 'issue', 'theme', 'intruded', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'visual', 'ride', 'film', 'managed', 'shift', 'gears', 'again', 'very', 'end', 'give', 'something', 'mull', 'over', 'credits', 'rolled', 'last', '15', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'edit', 'film', 'would', 'take', 'out', 'jarring', 'sugary', 'sweet', 'montage', 'sequence', 'end', 'felt', 'removed', 'too', 'far', 'film', 'psychological', 'edginess', 'Exiting', 'lead', 'character', 'strange', 'world', 'pain', 'loss', 'was', 'zenith', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'Horror', 'films', 'seek', 'send', 'moral', 'emotional', 'messages', 'frequently', 'make', 'kind', 'mistake', 'message', 'invariably', 'part', 'plot', 'resolution', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'script', 'three', 'photography', 'CGI', 'are', '5', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'share', 'one', 'friends']",Re-cycle (Director's Edition) 2 disc/gift set

I was sitting down on a chilly afternoon with some tea and figured this would be a great movie to relax and cuddle up under a blanket.  What I found in Re-Cycle was one of the most astonishingly beautiful movies I have ever watched.  I truly wish I would have purchased this in Blu-Ray.The beauty was mildly underplayed by a 'spirit/ghost' which takes focus within the first half of the movie.  The protagonist in the film is an author exploring her boundaries by drifting from romance novels to a darker, more haunting world.  Despite precautions that when writing about the subject she places herself in harms way to be subjected to ghosts and spirits.  She calmly revels in the idea of experiencing this.This first part of the movie does this and focuses on the mild yet extremely effective ghost story surrounding the author.  The effects were done tastefully and subtly and therefor caught my interest immediately.  I prefer story-driven and character-driven suspense to power horror and Re-Cycle snatched me immediately by doing so.  As the spirits progressively become more prominent, the movie descends down into a vibrant and extravagant world of dismal fantasy.Here, the visuals take precedence and captivate the viewer in surroundings that are breathtakingly beautiful and vast to regions that are dreadfully compelling and dark.  At no point did I ever want to look away from this film.  As the author progresses through this discarded world of remnants, we begin to learn about her, her guide and the world in which she finds herself.  While the stories are not overly twisted and confusing, there is enough intelligence to the film to satisfy just about all viewers.  I began to feel for the characters as their journey stretched farther and came to a close.And when I thought the movie was done, leaving me with a positive, elegant and refined sense of beauty and wonderment, the film adds in one final scene that brings parts of the movie together and leaves you to question a bit about it, too.  I am so pleased with the ending as it did not leave the movie in a linear fashion where it is evident what happened, why it happened, and so on.  The ending allowed moderate interpretation which, for me, leaves it open for additional viewings.This is not a horror movie, it is more fantasy than horror.  While watching the film, I got the feeling of a darker The Chronicles of Narnia mixed with a little bit of Ringu.Overall, Re-Cycle was a great watch and trip.  The visuals are nothing shy of captivating and beautiful and I would recommend this movie to any potential buyers in Blu-Ray.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Imagine a dimension where all things that have been discarded and abandoned go -- broken toys, unwanted babies, the forgotten elderly, even fictional characters who never made the cut.After a run of relatively disappointing movies, Danny and Oxide Pang return with a vengeance in ""Re-Cycle,"" a hauntingly vivid journey that sends Angelica Lee into such a world. This is not your typical Asian horror movie with ripoffs of ""The Ring"" -- this is a dark fantasy journey into a ghastly, bittersweet otherworld full of secrets and lost things, like a Lewis Carroll horror story.Ting-Yin (Lee) is a bestselling author riding high with her ""My Love"" trilogy, which is being adapted into a movie. Her next book, a horror novel named ""Re-Cycle,"" is announced as well.All seems perfect, save for an ex-boyfriend (Lawrence Chou) who has just divorced his wife and wants back. And when Ting-Yin starts writing ""Re-Cycle,"" she starts glimpsing a strange long-haired woman in her apartment -- and ends up inadvertently wandering into a desolate, ruined city full of zombies, stairs, creaking carnivals and masked children. It's a dimension of the discarded, and it stretches through nightmarish forests, cities, fields and decaying bridges filled with witchlight.When she's attacked by ghouls, Ting-Yin is rescued by a little girl who offers to help her get back home. After consulting with an old man in a vast library, Ting-Yin is told that she must find the Transit that leads back to her world. But Ting-Yin and the little girl Ting-Yu -- who seems strangely familiar to her -- are being pursued by a strange faceless woman, who is determined to keep Ting-Yin there forever""Re-Cycle"" is a very different movie from anything the Pang Brothers have done before -- it's fantasy rather than straight horror, and more in the vein of a grimier ""Mirrormask"" or a more horrific ""Pan's Labyrinth."" You could even consider it a sort of nightmarish ""Alice in Wonderland,"" if Notsowonderland were populated by zombies, ghouls, fetuses and the occasional weird little old man.For the first twenty minutes, ""Re-Cycle"" looks pretty much like a standard Asian horror movie, with a black-haired woman darting around in the shadows and lots of weird occurrences. But when Ting-Yin wanders into this other world, suddenly things become pure dark fantasy, and this rather generic character blossoms as she becomes close to little Ting-Yu.And the Pangs' direction is pretty brilliant. They flood the skies with strangely coloured light, and give the fields and cities a mummified, dead feeling. There's not a lot of dialogue in this movie, which makes the vivid imagery all the more important -- we travel from a land of crumbling buildings and grotesque forests to sunny fields and floating mountains. It's poisonous, yet somehow still beautiful.Yet there are also moments of whimsy, such as Ting-Yu riding in to the rescue on a giant toy horse. And while there's some straight-out horror like the faceless woman and the whole fetus cavern scene, the Pangs also imbue some scenes with poignancy. One particularly heartbreaking scene takes place among the elderly who were neglected and forgotten, and who plaintively hold up their hands to Ting-Yin in hopes of receiving a grave flower.Angelica Lee is the glue that holds this movie together -- rather than doing the standard horror performance of running around looking scared, she gives a subtle, layered performance with moments of dread, surprise, tension, sorrow and love. And Yaqi Zeng gives a magnificent performance as the mysterious Ting-Yu, who has a heavily foreshadowed connection to Ting-Yin. Their final scene together is utterly heartbreaking, yet somehow satisfying.The ending is a bit of a brain-twister, though. It makes sense in a bizarre way, given what has been written before, but it feels vaguely incomplete and leaves you wondering just what will happen next.""Re-Cycle"" is a haunting, horrifying ride through a strange world where the abandoned things end up, and shows the Pang Brothers in top form.

Both this film and Diary (an Oxide solo effort) reached operatic proportions at times. They are not content to hire up a few jingles and play them over and over throughout the film in some sort of branding effort. Each scene has its own soundtrack. Often times the soundtrack seems to lead the scene. I hesitate to call it music video-like because that smacks of demotion, but it is like a music video in the sense that the music is as important as the video.Re-cycle reminded me of Terry Gilliam's work, but not as desolate or oppressive. It's a beautiful film made edgy by the Pang Brothers tendency to genre hop, mixing in horror as well as melodrama. I think most would agree the Pangs are quite skilled and creative in the visual department but seem to lack a command of the story telling part. I say, ""so what"". I'm happy to be fully engaged while the film is playing and my only after thoughts be fond memories. I don't always need to have a deep philosophical discussion of what a film was trying to say.There may be better ruminations on the basic idea of this film, and it's a good one--exploring a place where all that's forgotten or abandoned congregates--(Spider Forest comes to mind), but few will be as engaging as this multimedia masterpiece.

1019081,APRNS6DB68LLV,B000I405E4,"Rob Slaven ""slavenrm@gmail. com""","[1, 1]","We picked this movie mainly because it had the word 'phantasmagorical' in the description.  Any movie that uses that word is almost guaranteed to be worth watching.  On the whole, it was a good pick.The story is anything but straightforward, but in a nutshell, an author gets sucked into a world built of her own discarded ideas and has to find a way to escape.  I won't say more for fear of spoilers but this is one EXCEPTIONALLY creepy movie both in concept and in execution.  It sustains this creepiness without a great deal of violence and not really any gore to speak of; it's a deeply psychological terror.On the positive side of things, this movie is visually stunning to the Nth degree.  I found myself wishing that we'd been able to see this in the theatre instead of on a television.  This would be one to sit near the front in the center of the theatre for.  Even on the small screen this one has a yawning depth of visuals.  Also, as I said above, the story is extremely nerve-wracking but doesn't have to splash blood on you to do it.To the negative, the story fades a bit towards the end.  The movie veers into what would appear to be a visual polemic against abortion; while the scenes around this topic are exceptionally horrifying and effective, one does get the sense of being lectured to a bit.  Near the very end the special effects seem unnecessarily forced and don't really add to the story in any way.  At times when the movie tries to be an action flick rather than a psychological horror things just don't work out in its favor..To sum up, an extremely disturbing and well-executed movie about the place where all those discarded objects and ideas in our lives go.  Highly recommended if you want to be terrified out of your mind and want to exercise your eyeballs.  Those seeking a more erudite offering may be a bit disappointed.  Good escapist horror mostly unencumbered by detailed storyline.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great!

1019082,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B000I405E4,Ron,"[0, 1]","This story starts out with a writer under pressure from her manager and or publisher to write a fourth story involving ghosts. The title has already been chosen and will be called Re-Cycle.I was amazed by the direction this story took me on. I thought it was just a ghost story, but it winds up being so&#8230;so much more about life, the choices we make, the consequences of those choices, not being able to take back those choices and finally trying to live with the consequences of those choices.I am still trying to adjust to other cultures and the mannerisms used by their actors, directors and writers in their story telling. Sometimes their gestures seem comical when in reality they are not and vise versa, so I have to keep a keen eye on the action/story to read into what they are really saying.This story starts out a little slow with a supernatural presence making itself known to the writer and helping her write the story. The writer is unexpectedly thrust into different dimensions to guide her on a journey she thinks is to help her write her new book at first, but her journey is far from what she could have ever imagined. The story might find you wondering WTH is going on here, but be patient the story does come together quite well and you'll see the light.  I don't want to give the details of her journey and spoil the story for those who haven't watched it yet.&#34;WARNING&#34; I will tell you about one stage of her journey that may be hard for some viewers to watch. The writer passes through a tunnel filled with fetuses at different stages of development (some are healthy and others are malformed) Again I only mention this to warn viewers who may be alarmed, offended, upset or traumatized by the images. This is a key component to the story and reveals quite a bit to the writer.The story evolves in so many different directions, but brings the viewer full circle through the choices that the writer has made and to the realization of the consequences of her choices that she must now live with.This story will leave the viewer contemplating their own life choices after watching the writer experiencing the heart felt choices that she has made over the years.This movie does slow down at times and does get a little confusing, but it comes together to give the viewer a clear picture of what this story is all about through (cool special effects, sights and sounds) and will leave you thinking about your own life and the choices you've made!

Mired in pointless sequels and quick cash-ins, I figured. Well, this offering brought the freshness back for me.  ""Recycle"" plays like an Asian horror version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" as imagined by Stephen King and envisioned by Guillermo del Toro.  It's a meta-fictional fantasy nightmare about guilt and coming to terms with your past that is explored through the experience of a struggling writer searching for a good horror story.  At one point the author (played by the ever-more-gorgeous Angelica Lee) tells a reporter that she would like to experience terror that wells up from the heart.  Careful what you wish for, eh?The first act of this film leads you to believe you are in for another uber-creepy haunting tale with lots of long black hair -this cliche is even referenced which is actually quite funny- and slow build-ups punctuated by horrific scares.  And it works, too.  but then it all changes. Turns out that ghosts and presumably many other supernatural happenings are caused by the bleeding of an alternate world into ours or vice-versa. All of the sudden we're transported along with our heroine to what is described as a dimension for the abandoned, where the forgotten and discarded things of our world find their resting place, waiting to be ""recycled"" into what is implied to be a new life.  Very Buddhist, but dark as hell.  The visuals here are absolutely wonderful. From a massive land of lost toys (apparently they grow real big when they are abandoned) to any number of the dimension's horrifying zombie-like denizens to a truly disturbing cavern filled with fetuses this dimension is amazing to look at adn creepy as can be.  My favorites are a group of hanged men with unsettlingly stretched-out necks and aggressive demeanor.  Along the way she encounters a nameless little girl who becomes her guide through the Lovecraftian Chinese dystopia.  I have to admit I saw the twist coming a mile away, but I still found it to ring true as an astoundingly bold (as in: would not fly in America), emotionally affecting, and philosophically deep choice of endings.  Bravo.I'm pretty irked that ""Recycle"" hasn't gotten more attention.  If I hadn't read Woopak's typically deep and insightful review than I never would have heard of this.  That is, until the inevitable lame American remake (offer up any bet you like if you don't think it will happen, I will take it) complete with lame upbeat ending.  I'm already ticked off about it and it hasn't even happened yet.  The story takes some pages out of Stephen King's library (The Langolierscomes to mind) and some of the metafictional aspects of the latterDark Towerbooks, adds a Guillermo del Toro feel along with a spattering of Asian horror conventions, but remains very much it's own entity.  Definitely a unique and rewarding experience overall, but it doesn't quite reach the highest echelon of Asian cinema it was reaching for though I can't really expain why.  Maybe it was the silly ""hell money"" bit that turned me off.  If you're looking for a visually interesting and philosophically fresh take on Asian horror, than be sure to check this one out.

1019093,A2O0LIVTTFU75I,B000I405E4,W Mianecke,"[1, 3]","This film has some significant factors in its favor; strong performances from Angelica Lee and her wonderful young co-star, emotionally charged set pieces, and some truly creepy moments. It's unfortunate and frustrating that it has significant elements which work against it success. The green screen work is excessive and often the actors are inaccurately lit in the foreground, ruining the illusion. Some sequences go on far too long and lose their potential impact. For every original idea and image, there seem to be two incredibly derivative ones. For example, the poor-man's-Romero-zombies used to portray many of the abandoned spirits. And, do we REALLY need yet another film with malevolent, long-haired female spirits lurking about in the background? Do we need more running-water-as-threat sequences? These tired retreads cripple the more original visuals. Another problem, common to many Asian genre scripts, is superfluous explanatory dialogue. The exact nature of the most disturbing sequences in the film is made quite clear with preceding explanations and very clear visuals. Yet, the whole thing gets explained by a character after the fact. (one could argue that this is because the sequence has a direct link to that character's nature) Finally, the music is incredibly generic. keyboard attempts at orchestral strings feel cheap when accompanying the lush visuals. However, I still recommend the film. There are incredibly touching character-driven moments throughout, and some truly effective tension-release sequences.",3,almost successful but still worth watching,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,1539,"['film', 'significant', 'factors', 'favor', 'strong', 'performances', 'Angelica', 'Lee', 'wonderful', 'young', 'co-star', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'set', 'pieces', 'truly', 'creepy', 'moments', 'unfortunate', 'frustrating', 'significant', 'elements', 'work', 'success', 'green', 'screen', 'work', 'excessive', 'often', 'actors', 'are', 'inaccurately', 'lit', 'foreground', 'ruining', 'illusion', 'sequences', 'go', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'lose', 'potential', 'impact', 'original', 'idea', 'image', 'seem', 'be', 'two', 'incredibly', 'derivative', 'ones', 'example', ""poor-man's-Romero-zombies"", 'used', 'portray', 'many', 'abandoned', 'spirits', 'do', 'REALLY', 'need', 'yet', 'film', 'malevolent', 'long-haired', 'female', 'spirits', 'lurking', 'background', 'Do', 'need', 'more', 'running-water-as-threat', 'sequences', 'tired', 'retreads', 'cripple', 'more', 'original', 'visuals', 'problem', 'common', 'many', 'Asian', 'genre', 'scripts', 'superfluous', 'explanatory', 'dialogue', 'exact', 'nature', 'most', 'disturbing', 'sequences', 'film', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'preceding', 'explanations', 'very', 'clear', 'visuals', 'whole', 'thing', 'explained', 'character', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'sequence', 'direct', 'link', 'character', 'nature', 'Finally', 'music', 'incredibly', 'generic', 'keyboard', 'attempts', 'orchestral', 'strings', 'feel', 'cheap', 'when', 'accompanying', 'lush', 'visuals', 'However', 'still', 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'incredibly', 'touching', 'character-driven', 'moments', 'truly', 'effective', 'tension-release', 'sequences']",Re-cycle (Director's Edition) 2 disc/gift set
1019094,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000I405E4,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 1]","It's close to Halloween, so I figured I should review at least 2 horror films this month. I saw ""RE-CYCLE"" late 2006 but neglected to share my thoughts on it partly because, well, I thought Amazon didn't have this film available and put this on the back burner. Haven't really seen a decent, ""newer"" Asian horror film this month, so may as well go back to one of the year-old ones that I enjoyed at least.Synopsis partially derived from the back cover:Chu Xun (Angelica Lee) is a young writer whose first novel has become a major bestseller in Asia. ""RE-CYCLE"" is her next book, the first one she's written about the supernatural. Every reader eagerly awaits the publication of her new book since they mostly believe that her writings can bring impact to their lives.Ever since Chu Xun began writing her new book, a lot of unexplained things begin to happen. Later on, the young writer discovers that the heroine of her new book has found her way from the ""fictional world"" into the real world. One night, Chu gets caught into the ""other"" existence, a world of mind-bending and intense horror...""RE-CYCLE"" is the handiwork of the Pang brothers (The Eye 1 & 2, Forest of Death), they're identical twins, with each a different but similar style of directing. After the dismal ""The Eye 10"" and the mediocre ""The Messengers"", one wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that they have lost their touch. Nope, the Pangs are very much alive and ""Re-cycle"" helps them redeem themselves while Angelica Lee gives as a strong a performance as in ""The Eye"".The brothers still have the skill to create tension in the screenplay. In the past, they've been considered to be ""pioneers"" of something fresh and new in the horror genre, ""Re-cycle"" do offer the same ""cool"" tricks from their other successful films. The film does have a pulse-pounding, effective soundtrack, slow reveals and the intensified build-up reminiscent of ""The Eye"". To the brothers' credit, they manage to pull off something new in this film, the film is more of a mind-bender in the 3rd act and the superb performance by Angelica Lee seals the deal.In the mysterious desolate fantasy world of ""Re-cycle"", the same shadowy creatures and the ""charcoaled"" undead pursues Chu, while she is desperately trying to get out. The mystery is how did she get into this predicament in the first place? With the film's foreshadowing, the screenplay is a fun watch for attentive moviegoers. The details given and from the script to visuals to the whole sequences, all these play a purpose. The thoughtful storytelling, while indeed solid, also makes it somewhat predictable. Thankfully, the predictability doesn't ruin the film's pacing, the film did succeed immersing me in its runtime. The film changes its tone/pace at times, from slow-buildups to intense, creepy chase sequences while the usual shocking cheap scares are used sparingly.One thing that helps the film is the stunning visuals and set designs. The desolate fantasy world is given exquisite detail, the imagery is beautiful at the same time creepy and scary. But hey, the film isn't perfect, some designs ARE a bit over the top. The ghouls still have that ""fake"" crazy  look, but thankfully, the eerie atmosphere compensates and it can still prove engrossing.Angelica Lee once again gives a great performance as usual. The film's key to its success lies with Lee as with ""Koma"" and ""The Eye"". While the film doesn't always ""click"", Lee succeeds in expressing the needed emotions and kept me interested for the most part. The emotional aspect does resonate effectively partly because of the film's themes. Lee is mostly doing a ""reaction"" role but she brings much needed depth and dynamic charisma to give her character a tangible feel.I have the standard edition 1-disc region-3 release from Universe Laser.VIDEO/AUDIO: Anamorphic Widescreen 1.78 ratio. EXCEPTIONAL picture quality, you can really tell that it shot in 1080p cameras. Strong black levels coincide with radiant and natural colors. The transfer is very clean and sharp.  The 5.1 Dolby/6.1 DTS track are as exceptional as the picture quality. The sound is crisp and very clear. The DTS Cantonese track is the way to go if you're equipped. The English subtitles are excellent and very visible.In closing:RE-CYCLE may have a climax that may leave a lot of viewers scratching their heads, but if you were attentive the whole 109 minutes when the Pangs set their ground rules and logic, it does make sense. This film shows that the Pangs still have the savvy to involve and excite their audience when they're in control. It is better than their Hollywood outing; ""The Messengers"".RECOMMENDED! For horror fans.

1019095,A3E6EEPLHZU8OD,B000I405E4,"Zach Kluckman ""Tigereyes""","[0, 0]","Wow. To put it briefly, this film is a whole new level, for the Pang brothers and for horror films in general. This movie transcends horror quickly, despite starting off in similar fashion to other memorable ghost flicks like the Ring, Ju-On, etc. But, in true Pang fashion, the directors have taken the opportunity to mislead the audience into expecting the usual fare and then delivering something completely beyond the promise of a few good jumps.THe brilliance of the Pangs is seen in the ability to take things we have seen before and invest them with an actual sense of building dread through the use of music and ambient sound. That said, this film, like the Eye, quickly moves beyond any mere horror film limitations. I think its fair to say that this movie is transcendental of genre, delving into realms of fantasy and surealism in poignent, poetic ways, creating a film that is a series of moments of truly sublime beauty (in the old artististic sense of the word)that lay at the heart of a surrealist landscape meant for artists, poets, and anyone who has ever forgotten someone or something precious.I will say this too, while the film could easily have gotten heavy handed at times...it does not, nor does the symbolism. The symbolism throughout the film is often very subtle...and effective. There are several moments when you may want to pause just to consider something you've seen or just to stare at the brilliant camerawork, lighting and effects of the film. Truth is, this movie is utterly enthralling and more than the mere eye-candy some have suggested. Although the end may feel a bit awkward, it helps to consider the clues that build up to it. Highly recommended viewing if you're looking for a movie with more style and story than the usual crappy hack and slash torture flick....",5,This is a whole new level...utterly sublime!,1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,1807,"['Wow', 'put', 'briefly', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Pang', 'brothers', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'movie', 'horror', 'quickly', 'starting', 'off', 'similar', 'fashion', 'other', 'memorable', 'ghost', 'flicks', 'Ring', 'Ju-On', 'etc', 'true', 'Pang', 'fashion', 'directors', 'have', 'taken', 'opportunity', 'mislead', 'audience', 'expecting', 'usual', 'fare', 'then', 'delivering', 'something', 'completely', 'promise', 'few', 'good', 'jumps.THe', 'brilliance', 'Pangs', 'seen', 'ability', 'take', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'invest', 'actual', 'sense', 'building', 'dread', 'use', 'music', 'ambient', 'sound', 'said', 'film', 'Eye', 'quickly', 'mere', 'horror', 'film', 'limitations', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'movie', 'transcendental', 'genre', 'delving', 'realms', 'fantasy', 'surealism', 'poignent', 'poetic', 'ways', 'creating', 'film', 'series', 'moments', 'truly', 'sublime', 'beauty', 'old', 'artististic', 'sense', 'word', 'lay', 'heart', 'surrealist', 'landscape', 'meant', 'artists', 'poets', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'forgotten', 'someone', 'something', 'precious.I', 'will', 'say', 'too', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'gotten', 'heavy', 'handed', 'times', 'not', 'symbolism', 'symbolism', 'film', 'often', 'very', 'subtle', 'effective', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'when', 'may', 'want', 'pause', 'just', 'consider', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'stare', 'brilliant', 'camerawork', 'lighting', 'effects', 'film', 'Truth', 'movie', 'utterly', 'enthralling', 'more', 'mere', 'eye-candy', 'have', 'suggested', 'end', 'may', 'feel', 'bit', 'awkward', 'consider', 'clues', 'build', 'up', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'more', 'style', 'story', 'usual', 'crappy', 'hack', 'slash', 'torture', 'flick']",Re-cycle (Director's Edition) 2 disc/gift set
