Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 9]","THE LEGEND OF TILLAMOOK'S GOLD (a/k/a THE TILLAMOOK TREASURE, 2006, 105 minutes, rated PG) is one of those very tough films to review. It is supposed to be a family film, though it has some unpleasant family scenes, exactly one swear word (""s.o.b."")--and is dismally rotten. So much so that I cannot ascertain if it is theatrical or a TV film.Set in the beautiful town of Manzanita, Oregon (filmed almost entirely on location...it's a real town), we are introduced to 14-year-old Julie Kimbell (Suzanne Marie Doyon, no major talent here that I can sense but I suspect it is her father, writer Richard Doyon, who is responsible for this).This is a dysfunctional-family-lonely-teen-girl-treasure-hunt movie...and as if that were not enough, I found it insulting to Natives as well as African Americans. Julie is surrounded by asinine family members including her irritating parents, uncle and grandfather (a most welcome Max Gail--the first and only time I've seen him since his ""Barney Miller"" days).Throw in an insulting back-handed Native subtext and you've got a good idea what this thing is like. My old family acquaintance, Floyd Red Crow Westerman as Standing Elk, in his last screen appearance, is the token Indian Patsy here. However, he and the great Max Gail create a chemistry that is sadly wasted here--like everything else. Further, this film makes Americans look stupid as hell.I always say if you cannot (or will not) portray something correctly in a film, you are against it fundamentally. Directors never learn, and PRESTO!!--an Indian pops up where an Indian should not be. Oh, Oregon Natives may or may not have been insulted by this. I know I was, and Floyd Red Crow must have needed what money he got from this or he'd not have given it a second thought!Obsessed with her hunt for the legendary Tillamook gold treasure, Julie was saved by one grace: at least this film is not about vampires, werewolves, ghosts or demons. She is plagued by the vision of a dead slave, but that is handled so stupidly that I will not waste a further word on it. All this reminded me too much of TWILIGHT--something I'd rather forget.What I want to know is this: WHY oh why is this kind of quality intention (the ONLY quality here except for the locations) ALWAYS ruined by bad directors and crummy dialogue? They mounted better plays at my junior high school.Another breath of fresh air so sorely needed here is young Oregon native Escher Holloway as Eddy, Julie's love interest. This boy has potential, and I can only hope he's started fulfilling some of it. He's since been on ""CSI:NY"" and first starred in WHEN A STRANGER CALLS.The story unfolds in a sagging, horrible way--I was fit to be tied half way through it. Julie finds the treasure, loses it to save her inept father, and then the treasure in the end is forgotten completely. Great writing, keep it up.The one thing they got right was shooting mostly on location, with additional filming on location in North Carolina and California. It is a well-blended film only in that I cannot tell one locale from another.Meanwhile, I'd go out on a limb and get a slightly spicier PG-rated teen's movie for the kids (THE SASQUATCH DUMPLING GANG is an excellent choice). TILLAMOOK might capture the 8-year-old imagination, only because it seems to have been written and directed by an 8-year-old. The culpable party here was Jane Beaumont Hall, whose sole distinction is that she directed two short films.

Every movie about gold you see. It's always like ' throw the gold away and let's dance in our rags'. I'm very spiritual. Spirituality and poorness have nothing to do with each other. You'd think that Gods and Goddesses would want her to help her family get ahead so her dad could relax, finish his book and no longer be in debt living in his brother's house off his money. Hollywood wants joy for the 3% in the world and the other 97% work at Taco Bell and McDonald's. And if they're really lucky be button pushers.
