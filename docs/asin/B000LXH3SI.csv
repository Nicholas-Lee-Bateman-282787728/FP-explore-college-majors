But when the first season came to dvd my cousin bought the first season and let me barrow it since I hadn't seen it.instantly I was hooked. I found it a deep, emotional ,exciting series. With great characters , wonderful stories that truly pulls you in and keeps you wanting more.The second season builds nicely on the events that took place in the first season . One Character's development bugged me, but everyone else made up for it.Plus there are many improvements to make up for it. Many of the stories are even deeper to the point you might be in tears after watching . You really feel for the characters, This show may truly be one of the best shows ever on TV. Defiantly one of the best on the WB . Which is saying alot because back in their heyday they had some great shows.If you have yet to watch everwood I highly recommend you give it a chance assumming you like amazing drama's with real life problems and successesOne Note: Don't start with this season, You must see the first season to start with as if you don't see it you won't get as much enjoyment or have the understanding of things refferenced in this season.Once you see that I'm sure you will defiantly want to get your hands on this season.I just wish the 3rd season would come to dvd.

1041612,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000LXH3SI,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 4]","....You won't want to leave. Such as I found out that fall of 2002 when Everwood premiered on the WB. After such a phenomenally wonder debut season(one of the best I've seen), Everwood sailed into season 2 and it didn't disappoint. What was the outcome of Colin's surgery?. What will happen with Amy and Ephram?. Season one ended on a cliffhanger, and season 2 starts off with the wrap up and into what would be another wonderful season. Of course, it took 5 years for season 2 to finally come out!. Hopefully, we won't have to wait that long for the remaining 2 seasons.Okay, if you are getting season 2, then you have probably seen season one, so there is probably no reason to get into what the show is all about since you probably already know. If you haven't seen season 2 yet, I will try to be as spoiler free as I can.The season starts off with ""The Last Of Summer"", a wonderful season opener that reveals the outcome of Colin's surgery. It's a great episode that may lead to thinking something but then pulls the rug out from under you. It also features another Emmy worthy performance by Treat Williams near the end. What happens in this episode will lend itself to the path that Amy(Emily Van Camp)finds herself on this season. It can get a bit rough going, a little dark, but never short of brilliant, with great writing and acting all around(then again, this is Everwood, so that shouldn't be surprising). Elsewhere, Marcia Cross(Desperate Housewives)joins the cast as Harold's sister, Linda, and something blooms between her and Andy. But Linda has something to reveal to him and her family. Sarah Lancaster(Chuck)also appears as Madison, a new babysitter for Delia(Vivien Cardone), and a possible new love interest for Ephram(Gregory Smith). The rest of the cast is back and everyone shines in just about everything they do. They all have their characters down pat. And what characters they are. All of the characters are so fleshed out and real. No ""stereotype cut-out #1"" in the bunch. Tom Amandes continues to enthrall as Dr. Harold Abbott, the one time lone doctor in Everwood, who becomes more of a friend to Andy than a somewhat comical enemy from season one. Chris Pratt also evolves as Bright, who could of been a one night jock/bully like we originally thought in the pilot. His Bright has become a real person, and the relationship with Ephram was one of the show's greatest assets. But the young Gregory Smith and Emily Van Camp, the show's two main teens, are astonishing as ever. Wonderful young actors who seem to be way beyond their years.So, besides the premiere, what else does season 2 of this great show hold?. Lots. Without giving too much away. A three story episode interlocks in the great ""Three Miners From Everwood"", complete with guest appearance by the always welcome Beau Bridges. ""Blind Faith"" finds Andy trying to help a reverend who is going blind; A health issue along with new romances spring up in ""Just Like In The Movies""; Thanksgiving rolls around in ""Unhappy Holidays"", complete with plenty of drama and a guest appearance from legend Betty White; A parent/child split in ""Family Dynamics""; Going to the next level in a two relationships that may not turn out how the characters planned in ""No Sure Thing""; The last 4 episodes are all wonderful too - ""Sick"", ""Do Or Die"", ""Your Future Awaits"", and the finale, ""The Day Is Done"". The finale may be my favorite EW finale out of it's 4 seasons. A deep family secret is created in this episode that will have big repercussions in season 3. It's just wonderful. Then again, so is this entire season. James Earl Jones also has a recurring role as Will Cleveland, who is teaching Ephram the piano. He received an Emmy nomination for his role. He is wonderful indeed!. I tried to be as basic as I could with the episode descriptions, and not let any names slip out. You should enjoy where the season goes as you watch.Season 2 of Everwood is perfect television. It's a family drama laced with wonderful humor, real characters, and top notch writing, directing, and acting. Everwood is a show that allows it's main characters, as much as we have grown to love each and every one of them, make mistakes, some painful, do or say the wrong thing, make us upset and not like them at times, and allows for them to face and go through real consequences of their actions and those around them. A lot of family shows have ""special episodes"" where something is done with at the end of the hour, or a major issue is relegated to a guest star, a friend of one of the kid's or whatever who is never seen again. No, the characters on Everwood do it and they have to go by what they do. Some of it is serious, some of it is just life. It's a show that doesn't talk down to it's audience, or teenagers. It hits on some tough subject matter(this season and others)and doesn't shy away from it or wrap it up in a bow at the end of the episode. Just going listing things that are going on this season - death, depression, pills, hooking up with the town 'rebel', a health issue coming out as a couple gets serious, and so on. Taken out of context, it may seem a bit much. A bit soap opera-y. Seeing it together as a whole is a whole other experience. Everwood is a show with a lot of intelligence, creativity, heart, and a heck of a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera. It's all pulled together wonderfully. In my review for the season one DVD, I said that Everwood ""put fresh spins on old conventions"", and that remains to be true this year. You may see familiar things on Everwood, but they put their own stamp on it, or throw in a unique twist. And they have the actors and writers to pull it off brilliantly.In the end, season 2 of Everwood was a fantastic year for a wonderful, warm, smart, funny, touching, poignant, intelligent show. A show that should of lasted longer than it did. Everwood is true quality televison at it's best.",5,Once You Enter Everwood....,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,5925,"['.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'Such', 'found', 'out', 'fall', '2002',

For those looking for a 'sleeper' show they may have missed out on, it's hard to go wrong with Everwood, and at these prices (compared to other 20+ episode hour long dramas) it's a steal.Now give us seasons 3 and 4 quick!!!P.S.

1041645,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000LXH3SI,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","Season Two of EVERWOOD is a splendid follow up to its rookie season.  It is large focused on three major relationships that the show's three main characters have:  Andy Brown's relationship with Dr. Abbott's sister, played by Marcia Cross; Ephram's relationship with Delia's college-aged girlfriend, played endearingly by CHUCK's Sarah Lancaster; and Amy's ill-advised relationship with a guy with a drug problem.  The most original of the three was Emphram's.  It was a classic case of the right guy and the right girl meeting each other, but at precisely the wrong time.  It is a challenge for any show to pull off a 16 year old boy and a 20 year old girl dating (ten year later it would have been a big nothing), but they did it well without pulling any punches.  Even as you know that Ephram and Amy will end up together (I am watching the show for the first time -- Seasons One and Two on DVD and Seasons Three and Four thanks to a friend show is a fanatic for the show and has lent me her VHS tapes, a pretty large box of them -- but it is one of those shows where you know from the outset who is going to end up with whom, the whole show being a ritual about how the writers can invent enough ways to keep them apart), you enjoy watching an impossible yet oddly healthy relationship.  And one of the characteristics of the show is that it then takes some nasty twists and unexpected turns.Season Two is filled with many highlights, including a couple of guest appearances by James Earl Jones as a grumpy old man who befriends Ephram and becomes his tutor in jazz piano.  Bright, who started the series off as a jerk, gradually becomes Ephram's best friend and a very likable character.  And there are several nice guest appearances, like J. K. Simmons, who plays a mechanic who ""hears"" things about people's futures, Beau Bridges as someone who is building a lighthouse in his backyard, and an artificially endowed Kristen Bell, just before becoming a star on VERONICA MARS, as a high girl who has a breast implant rupture.  The saddest appearance was that of Kellie Waymire, a likable character actress who graced several TV series as a guest before died of a heart attack at age 36.  She appeared in shows like THE X-FILES and WONDERFALLS, and this was her final performance before her death.  It was nice that at the end of the episode they memorialized her.I really have loved both seasons of EVERWOOD, but I wish the final two seasons were out on DVD.  There are some really good shows that still haven't been brought out on DVD.  The most grievous failure has been not bringing MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE out on DVD (how is that even possible?), but this is a close second.  Hopefully I can go back and review the next two seasons on DVD.I do have two major quibbles with the show.  Near the end of Season Two Dr. Abbott's professional liability carrier suspends his insurance because they had not disclosed the medical condition of Dr. Abbott's sister.  I work in a med mal claims department for a major med mal insurance company.  There is no way in the world that anyone would cancel insurance!  They might up his premium, but  nothing more.  What a crock!  Policies might not be renewed for having some serious problems, but let's face it, there is only one way that the vast majority of people will not get insured:  failure to pay premium.  Anyone doctor or any hospital can get insurance if they are willing and able to pay the premium.  And $50,000 premium?  He should come to us!  He's getting ripped off!  (Now entering the no exclamation point zone.)  My second complaint is with the way the entire town ostracizes Dr. Brown after the death of Colin after the surgery that ended Season One.  It was simply not believable that a town would be so complete in its rejection.",5,A strong sophomore season for a superb show,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,3790,"['Season', 'Two', 'EVERWOOD', 'splendid', 'follow', 'up', 'rookie', 'season', 'large', 'focused', 'three', 'major', 'relationships', 'show', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'Andy', 'Brown', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Abbott', 'sister', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Cross', 'Ephram', 'relationship', 'Delia', 'college-aged', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'endearingly', 'CHUCK', 'Sarah', 'Lancaster', 'Amy', 'ill-advised', 'relationship', 'guy', 'drug', 'problem', 'most', 'original', 'three', 'was', 'Emphram', 'was', 'classic', 'case', 'right', 'guy', 'right', 'girl', 'meeting', 'other', 'precisely', 'wrong', 'time', 'challenge', 'show', 'pull', 'off', '16', 'year', 'old', 'boy', '20', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'dating', 'ten', 'year', 'later', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'nothing', 'did', 'well', 'pulling', 'punches', 'Even', 'know', 'Ephram', 'Amy', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'am', 'watching', 'show', 'first', 'time', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'DVD', 'Seasons', 'Three', 'Four', 'thanks', 'friend', 'show', 'fanatic', 'show', 'lent', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'pretty', 'large', 'box', 'one', 'shows', 'where', 'know', 'outset', 'who', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'whom', 'whole', 'show', 'being', 'ritual', 'how', 'writers', 'can', 'invent', 'enough', 'ways', 'keep', 'apart', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'impossible', 'yet', 'oddly', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'one', 'characteristics', 'show', 'then', 'nasty', 'twists', 'unexpected', 'turns.Season', 'Two', 'filled', 'many', 'highlights', 'including', 'couple', 'guest', 'appearances', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'Ephram', 'tutor', 'jazz', 'piano', 'Bright', 'who', 'started', 'series', 'off', 'jerk', 'gradually', 'Ephram', 'best', 'friend', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'are', 'several', 'nice', 'guest', 'appearances', 'J.', 'K.', 'Simmons', 'who', 'mechanic', 'who', 'hears', 'things', 'people', 'futures', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'someone', 'who', 'building', 'lighthouse', 'backyard', 'artificially', 'endowed', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'just', 'becoming', 'star', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'high', 'girl', 'who', 'breast', 'implant', 'rupture', 'saddest', 'appearance', 'was', 'Kellie', 'Waymire', 'likable', 'character', 'actress', 'who', 'graced', 'several', 'TV', 'series', 'guest', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'age', '36', 'appeared', 'shows', 'X-FILES', 'WONDERFALLS', 'was', 'final', 'performance', 'death', 'was', 'nice', 'end', 'episode', 'memorialized', 'her.I', 'really', 'have', 'loved', 'seasons', 'EVERWOOD', 'wish', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'out', 'DVD', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'shows', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'brought', 'out', 'DVD', 'most', 'grievous', 'failure', 'been', 'not', 'bringing', 'MALCOLM', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIDDLE', 'out', 'DVD', 'how', 'even', 'possible', 'close', 'second', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'review', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'DVD.I', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'major', 'quibbles', 'show', 'end', 'Season', 'Two', 'Dr.', 'Abbott', 'professional', 'liability', 'carrier', 'insurance', 'had', 'not', 'disclosed', 'medical', 'condition', 'Dr.', 'Abbott', 'sister', 'work', 'med', 'mal', 'claims', 'department', 'major', 'med', 'mal', 'insurance', 'company', 'way', 'world', 'anyone', 'would', 'cancel', 'insurance', 'might', 'up', 'premium', 'nothing', 'more', 'What', 'crock', 'Policies', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'renewed', 'having', 'serious', 'problems', 'let', 'face', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'insured', 'failure', 'pay', 'premium', 'Anyone', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'can', 'get', 'insurance', 'are', 'willing', 'able', 'pay', 'premium', '50,000', 'premium', 'should', 'come', 'getting', 'ripped', 'off', 'Now', 'entering', 'exclamation', 'point', 'zone', 'second', 'complaint', 'way', 'entire', 'town', 'ostracizes', 'Dr.', 'Brown', 'death', 'Colin', 'surgery', 'ended', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'town', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'complete', 'rejection']",Everwood: Season 2

Warner Brothers are usually really good for this - I have many of their R1 releases that haven't been 'locked up'. Warner's American counterparts are far superior than the English releases which traditionally lack special features and get split into part-seasons. And Everwood will probably never be released in the UK! So this was the best option.FINALLY I have another season of Everwood! Another 22 episodes to get lost in all over again. I loved the second season when it was on TV and hope seasons 3 and 4 follow - but for this to happen, I know WE have to purchase this one! So if you're undecided about it, don't be. Everwood was one of the underrated gems that often garnered critical praise but didn't always gather the masses as much as their sexier, hipper equivalents The O.C. and One Tree Hill did.I don't know if you've tried watching the O.C. lately, but even a few years hasn't been kind to it. Littered with pop culture references and gimmick guest stars like Paris Hilton, its age quickly shows. Everwood created its own world, and even though its been 4 longggg years since last on DVD - the world and stories are as vivid, relevant and engulfing as ever.There's been a quiet packaging change to a 6-disc plastic case slotted into a cardboard slipcase (which luckily matches the chunkier season 1 exactly!) but to be honest the change is for the better - I imagine we're all starting to run out of DVD space, so smarter packaging fits happier on shelves!Go for it guys - you know Warner are going to keep an eye on this - so lets keep them coming.",5,Back to Everwood,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,1676,"['got', 'boxset', 'today', 'Amazon.com', 'delivered', 'UK.Firstly', 'was', 'glad', 'played', 'R2', 'DVD', 'player', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'are', 'usually', 'really', 'good', 'have', 'many', 'R1', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', ""'locked"", 'up', 'Warner', 'American', 'counterparts', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'English', 'releases', 'traditionally', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'split', 'part-seasons', 'Everwood', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'UK', 'So', 'was', 'best', 'option.FINALLY', 'have', 'season', 'Everwood', '22', 'episodes', 'get', 'lost', 'over', 'again', 'loved', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'hope', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'follow', 'happen', 'know', 'WE', 'have', 'purchase', 'one', 'So', ""'re"", 'undecided', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'Everwood', 'was', 'one', 'underrated', 'gems', 'often', 'garnered', 'critical', 'praise', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'gather', 'masses', 'as', 'much', 'sexier', 'hipper', 'O.C', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'did.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'watching', 'O.C', 'lately', 'even', 'few', 'years', ""n't"", 'been', 'kind', 'Littered', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'gimmick', 'guest', 'stars', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'age', 'quickly', 'Everwood', 'created', 'own', 'world', 'even', 'been', '4', 'longggg', 'years', 'last', 'DVD', 'world', 'stories', 'are', 'vivid', 'relevant', 'engulfing', 'been', 'quiet', 'packaging', 'change', '6-disc', 'plastic', 'case', 'slotted', 'cardboard', 'slipcase', 'luckily', 'chunkier', 'season', '1', 'exactly', 'be', 'change', 'better', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'starting', 'run', 'out', 'DVD', 'space', 'so', 'smarter', 'packaging', 'fits', 'happier', 'shelves', 'Go', 'know', 'Warner', 'are', 'going', 'keep', 'eye', 'so', 'keep', 'coming']",Everwood: Season 2
