I tend to hate slap stick and sophomoric humor; this gets pretty close to that edge, but stays just enough off that I can love it.  The idea of Coconut Pete as the lesser known version of Jimmy Buffett is great, and his angst at being overshadowed is very funny (son of a son of a..bi**h).  The characters are fun and not too over the top (unlike their Beerfest performance - terrible).  The filming location is awesome - a tropical beach (which, if my eyes serve, is also the same beach where I Still Known What You Did Last Summer was filmed (mexico?)).

I know everyone says Super Troopers was better, but that's because they didn't think this would be a different movie.  I like the way they were able to make such big character transitions for this.  It really amazes me how people didn't like it because it was also a horror movie.  They stepped into a territory that many can unsuccessfully stay in, but I think they really pulled it off.  The characters and dialogue were pretty funny, especially Machete Phil.  That scene surprised me.  I couldn't believe what I had seen.  These guys are the funniest group since Kids in the Hall and Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  No movie scares me much anymore so I watched this to laugh, see some gore, and also, unexpectedly, see the diversity of characters they can play.  I'm really surprised with Kevin Heffernan.  He seemed natural as Farva, and then he is very smart in this one.  I liked Putman because his humor was more of a subtle thing than blatantly obvious like the others.  Him and Jenny was a hilarious running joke.  The killer surprised me.  I didn't expect it to be him.  He really creeped me out.  This movie is definitely worth a purchase, and also people should watch it like they have never seen Super Troopers.  It can still be very entertaining.  I hope to work with Broken Lizard one day.  They inspired me to pursue my dream of making movies, one I had been debating over for a long time.  Thanx guys if u ever read this review.

If you get the humor, you will not have any regrets about buying the dvd.  My only gripe is the DVD itself.  Aside from a commentary track and a soundtrack spot, we get absolutely nothing.

I enjoyed Super Troopers and thought it had some really funny moments, so I expected similar results from Club Dread. I honestly don't remember laughing once.One major problem with the film is that it seemed like it couldn't decide between being a spoof of horror films or an actual horror film, and either way it failed to entertain. I just didn't find the dialogue or characters interesting, with one exception. I actually enjoyed Bill Paxton as Coconut Pete, an obvious reference to Jimmy Buffett. I thought the songs written by Coconut Pete were good parodies of some of Buffett's popular songs.

While Club Dread falls short compared to the comical impact of Super Troopers, it does have some hidden gems and may appeal to most Broken Lizard fans. These guys are just the kings of brainless humor.I'm a fan of horror/comedies and this one does an okay job. The scares work, and there are a few parts where you'll actually find yourself inching toward the edge of your seat, but not necessarily on the edge of it. One reviewer mentions Shaun of the Dead in their Club Dread review. There is no comparison. In no way does Club Dread reach the caliber of Shaun of the Dead, which is one of the funniest, and scariest horror/comedies I've ever seen.Club Dread is funny in some parts, scary in some parts, and I will watch it again (someday) because it is entertaining. But it is not one of the best horror/comedies I've ever seen, and can't be lumped in with the likes of Shaun of the Dead. Club Dread is campy, dumb, full of sexual innuendo and drunk partiers. It works on its own level. Come on, we're talking about Broken Lizard here.The drawbacks of the film are Jay speaking in a faux British accent while wearing a dreadlock wig.

It also kept me guessing, right untill the very end. I found it to be rude, crude, and vicious fun. It is the second film in the comedy troop ""Broken Lizard"" who made a film about two years ago called ""Super Troopers"" which I have never seen. I almost gave this movie five stars, but was stopped because of the first scene. I thought that the first scene was a little dull, and after that I was scared that the entire movie would be a waste of time. I was very very wrong. The movie stars Bill Paxton, who I thought was great in this as Coconut Pete, Brittany Daniel from ""Joe Dirt,"" and the leader of Broken Lizard, Jay Chandrasekhar, who played a tennis instructor who thinks that his playing is great.The movie takes place on Pleasure Island resort in Costa Rica. Run by former former rock star Coconut Pete. He has young people come and have a good time, away from phones, and other technology, and wants his visitors to have a good time with the staffers. The staffers include Putnam, the tennis instructor, Sam, the captain of the ""Fun Police"" and Jenny, the aerobics instructor who has a reputation of sleeping with many of the staff members. Jenny becomes interested with the new masseur Lars whose has hands like magic, much to the dismay of Putnam. All of the staff members are ready to have fun for the week, untill one of the staff members is killed. More and more start to die, and they are killing people based on the lyrics of Coconut Pete's songs. Pete hired the security guard Hank to help them find out who is killing everybody, as they try and survive the week at the resort, all while suspecting everybody including each other.""Club Dread"" sounds like a spoof, but it is not. It is pure horror/comedy. I thought that it was scarier then recent horror films like ""Freddy vs Jason"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" and I liked how it was hilarious as well. It wasn't to long in the end, and I felt that the entire money was worth the money that it spent. I don't see how it didn't make alot of money, but it will probally do much better when it comes out on video. I thought Bill Paxton was a big highlight as Coconut Pete, and he was hilarious. It has graphic violence, and graphic nudity, but it was still a great film. If it wasn't for the beginning, it would be a five star movie, and mabye one of the best of the year.

The major problem is the feeble attempt to be a comedy-horror-spoof film. Unfortunately, the comedic overtures are never funny unless you are fifteen years old and the horror scenes are not funny nor scary unless you are thirteen years old.Sixteen and seventeen year old boys will like the extended version for the brief scenes of girls topless or nude but they are gratuitous like most of the scenes. It seemed like I was watching skits from a comedy workshop which were well performed but nothing more than acting exercises. I was left wondering why so much effort was put into making this film because the script is nothing but a collection of lame situations for cliche characters.Young men will enjoy looking at Brittany Daniels but her character is pedestrian and she is never more than eye candy. Unfortunately, she is never exploited as a sex symbol and in the end is simply an attractive girl in a bikini. She like all the characters is not enough to sustain your interest. You can talk on the phone or go to the toilet while watching this film and never miss anything important.

616867,A1I8F97AHES8YD,B00005JMDW,George Graham,"[3, 7]","Those Broken Lizard guys are at it again, this time spoofing horror movies and island getaways. Coconut Pete (Bill Paxton) is a washed-up hippie musician, his biggest hit Pina Coladaburg, a song written seven years before Margaritaville, but the latter got all the attention. Now Pete owns an island designed strictly for drinking, sex, music, and general wackiness. There's even the Fun Police, Sam (Lizard member Erik Stolhanske), who declares, ""If you refuse to have fun, fun will be provided for you!"" Other employees: British tennis instructor Putman (Lizard member/ director Jay Chandrasekhar), who has a thing for aerobics instructor Jenny (Brittany Daniel), as do most of the men on the island; new masseur Lars (Lizard member Kevin Heffernan, now immortally known as Farva), who gives heavenly massages; Juan (Lizard member Steve Lemme), the handsome lothario (I think he has a job on the island) who falls for guest Penelope, whom he calls Peenalope; and Dave (Lizard member Paul Soter), Pete's nephew, the island DJ, and the main source for drugs on the island. Then bodies start piling up, and Sam's activities board starts getting names crossed out on it when someone dies. The killer could be anyone, but who has the motive? Lars, the new guy who has a bit of an obsession with Pete? Dave, whose parents were killed at one of Pete's concerts? Sam, who seems to accuse everyone but himself? Penelope, with a mysterious past? Juan, who spent time in a mental institution? Whoever it is, they need to get a better costume than a knock-off of the fisherman outfit from I Know What You Did Last Summer.Not quite as hilarious as Super Troopers or Puddle Cruiser, the Lizards' last two movies, Club Dread is still very funny, with tons of quotable lines. Chandrasekhar is hysterical as Putman, nailing a Cockney accent; Heffernan good as the basic opposite of Farva; ditto for Lemme as Juan (he played Mac in Super Troopers); and Paxton is perfect as Coconut Pete, who is too drunk to know what's really going on. There are many memorable scenes, like Pete's exasperated explosion after two workers can't guess the secret ingredient in Pete's special meal; Putman's odd dream about who the killer is; and the destruction of most of the horror movie cliches in the book- the vehicle that won't start, the drug users and horny college-age kids who you know are dead right off the bat, the dark history of a worker at the island that died years ago and still haunts everyone, the killer's long explanation of why they did it, the old pro who stands up against the killer, the looks at the beginning between characters to dark music to say, 'Could they be the killer?', the killer that WILL NOT DIE, and so on. So if you liked Broken Lizard's other movies, you'll love this. You'll also enjoy it if you're tired of horror move cliches, or if you want to see a bit TOO much of Jay Chandrasekhar and Paul Soter.

Three years after its successful debut in ""Super Troopers,"" the Broken Lizard comedy troupe is back and as hilarious as ever.In ""Club Dread,"" the flippant ensemble tackles the formulaic contemporary horror genre. One by one, a masquerading assailant hacks down undutiful employees at a Costa Rican resort called Paradise Island. The killer employs a machete as his/her weapon of choice and saunters along at a leisurely pace when in pursuit of a naughty counselor (i.e. Jason Voorhees). What sets this villain apart is his/her facial guise. Instead of a William Shatner mask spray-painted white as seen in ""Halloween"" or a circa 1965 goalie mask from ""Friday the 13th,"" this blood-thirsty maniac dons a ritualistic tribal mask.By the light of a campfire, we are told by counselor Dave that some years ago, an adolescent male named Phillip was lead astray by fellow staffers and made an inadvertent necrophiliac. He lost his nerve and butchered in cold blood all those within his eye line. He then cleaved off his penis and vanished into the woods. To this day, as the story goes, Machete Phil stalks the jungle beckoning ""Where's my penis?""Is Machete Phil the homicidal lunatic on the prowl, or is it one of Paradise Island's very own staff members? Could it be Lars, the pleasantly plump masseuse (Rodney Farva from ""Super Troopers""); Juan, the Latino studmuffin with an appetite for bestiality; or perhaps even the nimble, tantalizingly hot - yet cuckoo - Penelope? Better still, is it beyond doubt to suspect the hideaway's owner, Coconut Pete, a brain-dead '70s rock icon? After all, the killer's code of slaughter does strictly abide by one of his most popular songs.""Club Dread"" is ""Exit to Eden,"" only tack on more hysterical flair along with a manipulative psychopath and lose the always atrocious Rosie O'Donnell.

They are, in fact, two words I had hoped never to see in the same sentence. But sure enough, someone out in Tinseltown woke up one day with an idea. ""Eureka,"" this bloke must have shrieked, ""Why not make a horror movie about a maniac hunting down a bunch of scantily clad kids at a resort located on a tropical island?"" Moreover, said idiot must have mused further as he quickly started making phone calls to his fellow industry yucks: ""Why stop there? Why not make this slasher film a COMEDY too! And better yet, we can get the Broken Lizard comedy troupe to write the script!"" Yippy! Ain't this idea a gas! Actually, I hate writing such a caustic introduction to a review of Jay Chandrasekhar's ""Club Dread"" because I actually enjoyed parts of the film. I didn't enjoy most of it, only a pathetic wretch could, but I thought some of the horror elements actually worked well. The comedy aspect of the movie, however, is about as funny as the Titanic, the Hindenberg, and the Great Chicago Fire rolled into one.""Club Dread"" starts off by introducing us to two yucks, one male and one female, stumbling around in a tropical rainforest looking for a place to...well, you'll see. They are soon joined by another female, and all three march into a nearby cave to engage in...well, you'll see. Sadly, a cloaked nutcase shows up, picks up a conveniently placed machete, and starts carving the kids up. One of the females nearly makes it back to the resort before losing her head to this madman (or madwoman?). Then the movie flashes back one hour so we can see a boatload of young tourists arriving at this very same island in order to spend a week of fun and sun at Coconut Pete's island getaway. Who is Coconut Pete? A washed up musician in the vein of Jimmy Buffet who opened up the resort as a way of making beaucoup bucks off of his fading reputation, that's who. In the movie's only masterstroke, they got none other than Bill Paxton to play the alcoholic, mentally addled Pete, and he does a marvelous job. Unfortunately, we have to wade through a lot of other actors to catch those brief yet ever so precious moments when Paxton the Great appears onscreen. Yet even this actor cannot salvage the shipwreck that is ""Club Dread.""Let's meet the ""counselors"" of Camp Coconut Pete, shall we? There's alluring fitness instructor Jenny (a VERY buff Brittany Daniel), a hispanic named Juan (Steve Lemme), the island's ""fun"" policeman Sam (Erik Stolhanske), the new masseur Lars (Kevin Heffernan), and director Jay Chandrasekhar in the role of the dreadlocked tennis instructor with an annoying British accent named Putnam. I'm probably forgetting a few, but who cares? Joining these cardboard cutouts are island guests Penelope (Jordan Ladd) and the mouthy kid from ""Freaks and Geeks,"" Samm Levine, now all grown up with no place to go--except for movies like this, I guess. The film basically consists of these dolts running around wondering what to do once they learn about the murderer, a murderer who leaves clues about what he's doing either carved into the bodies of his victims or on a chalkboard. It soon becomes quite obvious that any of the people we meet could be the one stalking and slashing as there are plenty of red herrings tossed about at different times to throw us off the trail. The use of these false clues automatically brings to mind the infamous Italian gialli pictures I love so much, but I would rather not go there. Comparing this movie to a giallo makes me want to cut my tongue off with a rusty scalpel.So why did I despise ""Club Dread"" so much? Because it isn't funny. It's supposed to be funny. There are people trying very heard to be funny. There are set pieces constructed for the sole purpose of being funny. There are lines of dialogue the viewer suspects SHOULD be funny. But funny is an elusive concept well out of reach of this movie. On only one occasion did I crack a smile with this movie, namely learning that one of Coconut Pete's album's goes by the name ""Sea Shanties and Wet Panties."" The rest of the time I felt like cracking my television set with an axe. The rest of the movie? Not funny. A live version of Pac Man with people dressed up in fruit costumes? Not funny. Lars's magical touch that makes women swoon? Not funny. Jay Chandrasekhar? Not funny. Are you starting to get the idea? The horror elements of the movie provided the slightest relief from the plethora of unfunniness, but just barely. I did like the torn in half bit, and there's a head on a turntable that might have saved the day. But even the copious use of sauce isn't enough to revive this film. ""Club Dread"" is definitely DOA.Extras on the disc include a couple of commentary tracks you wouldn't--and shouldn't--be caught dead listening to and a separate audio track with samples of the film's music. So why am I going to give this movie three stars after giving it a sound thrashing? Bill Paxton, my friends. There are few movies that wouldn't benefit from having Bill Paxton make an appearance, and in the case of ""Club Dread,"" the benefit equals two full stars! He's that helpful here, with his unkempt hair and stoner sensibility. They should have chucked the script and placed Coconut Pete center stage. Alas that they didn't because the movie suffers dreadfully for it.

Cockrel,"[4, 9]","Watching ""Club Dread"" I found it hard to believe that this movie was made by the same Broken Lizard comedy team that gave the world ""Super Troopers.""While the latter film was one of the funniest comedies of the last five years, ""Club Dread"" is so spectacularly unfunny that it makes you wonder if ""Super Troopers"" was a fluke.At its core, ""Dread"" seems a parody of slasher flicks in general and of ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" in particular.  The killer on the loose at a tropical resort plotline is lifted directly from that earlier film.But the movie fails to elicit even a single chuckle.  Part of the problem is that many scenes are way too violent for a comedy.  In fact, the killings are generally played straight and are bloody enough to fit right into any modern slasher film.  At the same time, all the lame jokes keep things from getting too serious.The end result is a movie that is schizophrenic in that it seems to want to work as a horror film AND as a comedy.  Ultimately, ""Club Dread"" is too violent to be funny and too much of a wanna-be yukfest to be truly frightening.In trying to achieve two goals, the movie fails at both.The performances of actor/director Jay Chandrasekhar and the other members of Broken Lizard lack the anarchic glee and razor sharp wit that made &quot;Super Troopers&quot; a &quot;must see and then see again&quot; classic.  Bill Paxton plays an always-sloshed Jimmy Buffet-style singer whose resort is the center of the action.  One wonders if he wasn't drunk out of his mind, when he agreed to this role.I have high hopes for Broken Lizard and hopefully their third film outing will see them on surer footing.

616887,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JMDW,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","I was not one of the many who loved SUPER TROOPERS. Having seen numerous movies made by comedy troupes that turned skits into films like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE and THE GROOVE TUBE, I knew that these comedic groups could put together something good. Not so here. I found the movie more juvenile than many and in this day and age that is saying a lot.The same holds true for their second big screen endeavor. The jokes and humor found here are sophomoric at best, the kind of jokes that poor radio DJs and first year high schoolers laugh at. Worse yet, this movie has a hard time trying to decide just what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a horror film or a comedy? It tries to be both but not enough so to have it succeed at either.The movie revolves around a tropical resort, owned by a mildly successful singer named Coconut Pete (Bill Paxton), that revolves around his series of hits. Coconut Pete is obviously based on Jimmy Buffet, a fan of the film I have heard. Songs that focus on drinking exotic alcoholic drinks and chasing women are the mainstay of Pete. And the same holds true of this island resort where nearly everyone is guaranteed to match up with someone. And that is the whole function of this resort it seems.The movie begins with a trio of counselors running off into the jungle and hooking up only to be slaughtered by the mysterious killer running around on the island. Dressed in a native type disguise, he carries a machete and isn't afraid to use it. One by one the camp staff begins to find themselves killed off. As their numbers dwindle, they become more concerned about just who the killer is, not trusting one another and sticking close together. That is until it interferes with the plot device of having them be alone.The movie is an excuse for well endowed actresses to remove their tops and teen jokes to be made about women in general. None of the characters are believable, something that I realize has never stopped a horror film from being made, but in this case they are really far out. Everything from an English speaking dreadlocked tennis pro to a hefty masseuse with a magic touch for orgasmic release.Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me was that as I watched, I found myself trying to decipher just what it was that this group was trying to do. Was it really a comedy? If so it wasn't funny (except for the Buffet references). Was it trying to be a horror film, paying tribute to those not so distant classics of slaughter on vacation? Again, if so it failed as the prepubescent gags got in the way.The group here needed to focus, to make a choice, and then they might have made a decent movie. Instead we are treated to a horror film with laughs that fall flat. Or is it an unfunny comedy with people getting hacked to pieces? This movie fails on both counts.I've heard that the Broken Lizard group has another film in the works already. I would like to think that they would learn from their mistakes. But since that didn't happen from SUPER TROOPERS to this one, I doubt it. Perhaps the most mystifying question of all is that with all of the stories out there to tell, all of the movies that could be made, theirs get the green light.

616888,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JMDW,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[4, 9]","Broken Lizard's Club Dread works better as a thriller than as a comedy. It manages to build suspense better than it builds laughs. Not to say the film isn't funny, it has some pretty decent jokes, but  a lot of the time the jokes ruin moments of great suspense. Perhaps if Broken Lizard struggled not to be so funny, they would have had a terrific slasher film on their hands.Like in Scream, everybody's a suspect to the brutal yet zany murders going on at Coconut Pete's Pleasure Island during a long Spring Break getaway. No one is safe and anyone can go next. Beginning with a triple murder, then rewinding to an hour before, the film gets off to a good start and slowly builds its way to a bloody and satisfying conclusion. It's not one of those films where you try to guess who the killer is, but it's certainly a lot of fun seeing him (or her) chase around the helpless victims as everyone runs crazy trying to hide and figure out the mystery. In fact, the mystery is a lot more clever than the ones in any recent slasher film, Scream excluded of course. And Club Dread tells the story far more effectively, starting with the three murders and rewinding to introduce us to the cast, and suspects. It's brilliant, it works, and it's pretty shocking no other slasher film has done it before.The film has lovable performances from the cast of Broken Lizard, who are joined by the beautiful Brittany Daniel (Sweet Valley High) in what is, so far, her best big-screen role.  Perhaps the reason this was such a box-office flop is that it came at the wrong time.After a string of terrible modern slasher flicks, and endless spoofs, America had grown sick of the slasher trend started by Scream. Had the film been released five years ago, word of mouth would have gone out and the film would have become a hit. People were expecting another Scary Movie. That Club Dread is not.

Student Bodies was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen (though I grant you, I was twelve or thirteen at the time), and Pandemonium was a thing of beauty. Granted, it hasn't held up too well in the ensuing two decades, but it was still a pretty fun romp. After all the horrid reviews of Club Dread, I wondered if it had messed up the formula, or whether people were simply prejudiced against teen comedy slasher flicks (Student Bodies never got the recognition it deserved, either). Well, now I've seen it, and I have to say, it was kind of a mix of both.Plot? You need a plot? A bunch of people are on a deserted pleasure island. A serial killer starts doing his thing. The staff have to find the killer before there aren't any of them left to do so. There you go.Honestly, it's not as bad as all that. As with Pandemonium, the writers brought in some decently big names (headlined by Bill Paxton). Unlike Pandemonium, they also brought in some very attractive young ladies whose main collective job is to bare as many parts of the body not normally bared in public as possible. For most males, this alone will serve to make the movie at least watchable. Most of the jokes are intensely stupid, though the writers (a professional comedy troupe, who were also responsible for 2001's Super Troopers), who also play most of the main parts in the film, do have the sense of timing to bring off even some of the world's oldest gags, and they introduce a few of (slightly) newer vintage that still work, as well.There are a few decent performances. Bill Paxton makes a great washed-up Jimmy Buffett wannabe, and Jordan Ladd (Cabin Fever) turns in a performance that's surprisingly good for the first half of the film (after which she heads for stereotype city, but what can you expect?).Not brilliant filmmaking by any means, but really, not as bad as most would have you believe.

616900,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMDW,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 18]","Ever since ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" came out in 1974, the movie landscape has been littered with low budget horror films in which an insane (usually masked) killer goes about methodically slicing and dicing a group of teenagers, preferably while they're having sex, smoking pot or playing nasty little tricks on one another.  ""Club Dread"" wants desperately to be a parody of the ""slasher film"" genre, but the film turns out to be almost as bad as the movies it's lampooning.  ""Club Dread"" is as lacking in laughs as most of its target films are lacking in chills.  The movie takes place at a remote island resort that apparently caters exclusively to nitwit college students whose hormones are locked in overdrive and who seem to be on a perpetual spring break.  The movie opens just as someone has begun knocking off all the employees of the club one by one - and it is up to the increasingly small number of survivors to track down the killer.This is the second film by the comedy team that calls itself Broken Lizard.  The first was a genial and riotous farce labeled ""Super Troopers,"" released in 2001.  One would think that in the three years between that effort and this one the writers Jay Chandrasekhar (who also directed the film), Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Eric Stolhanske could have come up with something a bit better than a tired old ""10 Little Indians"" knockoff.  Rarely does the screenplay explore the black humor potential of the material, settling instead for corny wisecracks and limp-wristed slapstick.  Those who are determined to sit through this drivel should at least know that the second half is slightly more amusing than the first.  But that sure isn't saying much.""Club Dread"" is a horror comedy that provides neither horror nor comedy to any appreciable degree.

First off, the whole spoofing on the horror movie thing was done and actually done well in Scary Movie, but Club Dread actually takes its horror seriously and tries to throw in a mix of comedy to try and liven up the old and tired slasher formula. I was expecting more from the people who did Super Troopers but after viewing the trailer I knew it would be a bomb, and to comfirm that, I saw the movie tonight and it was pathetic. Every funny scene was already used in the Theatrical Trailer, so there were no surprises- a few jumps here and there when someone would pop up.

I cannot begin to comprehend how anyone could see it as such.  Gore does not equal horror.  Is it scary?  No.  Is it supposed to be?  No. It is just a horror parody, much like the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; series but not as broad and zaney.I do really like Broken Lizard as a comedy ensemble.  They play off of each other really well.
