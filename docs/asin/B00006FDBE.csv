Chow,"[4, 4]","`Master of the Flying Guillotine' is a sequel to `The One Armed Boxer' also written, directed and staring Jimmy Wang Yu.This film is so grindhouse camp, if it wasn't for the fact that it starred Jimmy Wang Yu you'd think this was a Quentin Tarantino film.The Plot: After the deaths of the One Armed Boxer's enemies, their master an old blind man armed with a flying guillotine is out to avenge their deaths.The One Armed Boxer runs a martial arts school teaching his students to use their talents for good not evil. They enter a large martial arts tournament which features an elaborate plethora of evil fighters. Including an Indian who can grow his arms to 12 feet long, and a barefoot fighter dressed like a Native American simply called, ""a foreigner.""Somehow the One Armed Boxer becomes a wanted man with a price on his head and all the henchmen, including the guillotine master come after him.The One Armed Boxer uses his head as well as his arm and sets a series of elaborate traps for each them which results in so of the best fight scenes EVER! Albeit totally unrealistic the fight scenes are spectacular due to their cleverness and surprisingly good special effects.The music is also fantastic and very appropriate for a fast paced thriller. It's a memorable rock and roll score. (sure they didn't have rock and roll in ancient China but it still works)Historical Note: Although the flying guillotine was a real basket shaped mechanical device it is usually portrayed as a fighting weapon. While it did exist, there is virtually no historical mention of its use.  Most historians agree that it was probably used like the French guillotine for public executions to strike fear into the hearts of citizens.

713182,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B00006FDBE,Draconis Blackthorne,"[0, 0]","Evocation: Among many of the presentations shown on a weekend showcase named ""Black Belt Theatre"" which aired on Saturday afternoons in the 80's, this one stood out as the most memorable by far. Driven by justified vengeance, a blind hermit monk with hefty eyebrows goes forth from his home in the clouds high above upon a mountain to avenge two of his pupils, seeking ""the one-armed man"" responsible. And as we know, in Chinese cinema, all monks are masters in Kung Fu. But what was most remarkable is the weapon he wields - literally, a ""flying guillotine"", actually, an ingenious design and idea in theory, in which when unravelled from its compact form, reveals what appears essentuially like a red and black ""bee-keepers hat"" with five criss-crossing blades at its inner base, and a saw-blade design along the outer edges, which when thrown, a mesh enclosure is activated, descending around the head and neck of the opponent, decapitating them, as the head is retrieved by the thrower.Probably because of this ponderation, I once arranged a weapon Myself by attaching a sawblade to a chain, affixed with a bolt and nut through the chain and the center of the blade, and what I essenially concluded with was a weapon that if thrown at an opponent, could wrap itself around their neck, and with enough force, the sawblade could quite possibly decapitate them. At the very least, some very palpable hits would be suffered, even if it struck an extremity or the torso.. Another time, I considered the arrangement of removing the blades from a chainsaw, wrapping electrical tape around one's hands, and what one would essentially wield would be flying knives.The first kill transpires in a bar in which a drunken bum claims to be an invincible one-armed fighter in order to get out of paying the bill for his dinner. The monk just so happens to be nearby awaiting his ""vegetarian noodles"", and forthwith dispatches of the dreg, swearing to kill every one-armed man he comes upon.The second kill happens at the actual tournament, upon which another one-armed fighter was present. The ""one-armed man"" turns out to be a Kung Fu instructor who becomes alerted to the monk's intentions at a tournament featuring several schools and styles including a Mongolian with a Vlad-like moustache, an Indian with extending arms {his accent dubbed in an accent reminiscent of Apu from the Quickie-Mart; to catch shoplifters and reach items across the store}, a Tibetan kick-boxing fighter here characterised as a filthy, barefoot, and uncouthe barbarian, staff vs. tri-staff, tonfa wielded by a mysterious cloaked Japanese contender, a lovely girl proficient at the eagle-claw, the always amusing monkey style vs. snake style, preying mantis, etcetera {and I Am sure much of Mortal Kombat was based upon this movie} - and thus sets out to plan his clever methods of self-preservation.Finally, the monk finds the Kung Fu teacher and persues him into a coffin shoppe temporarily converted into a battleground, in which traps have been arranged. So essentially, he realizes that he was no match for the magnificent weapon, and cheats his way to survival. And with the help of his students, manages to kill the afore-mentioned kick-boxer who also happened to become the monk's asistant, in an exceedingly cruel manner of fighting him in a small shack with a metal floor, which has been fire-heated in order to singe the flesh from the soles of his feet. Any attempt to flee out the window was met with spears.Also notable are the garments worn by the monk, most particularly the Grammadon on his robe, lest it be confused for the Nazi Swaztika, thus asserting that this is indeed an ancient symbol signifying the four elements. A Chinese character which means ""ten thousand"" and ""longevity"". It was originally a symbol of Buddha's heart, and was a term borrowed from Sanskrit.",5,Watch your head!,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,3857,"['Evocation', 'many', 'presentations', 'shown', 'weekend', 'showcase', 'named', 'Black', 'Belt', 'Theatre', 'aired', 'Saturday', 'afternoons', '80', 'one', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'memorable', 'far', 'Driven', 'justified', 'vengeance', 'blind', 'hermit', 'monk', 'hefty', 'eyebrows', 'forth', 'home', 'clouds', 'high', 'mountain', 'avenge', 'two', 'pupils', 'seeking', 'one-armed', 'man', 'responsible', 'know', 'Chinese', 'cinema', 'monks', 'are', 'masters', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'remarkable', 'weapon', 'literally', 'flying', 'guillotine', 'actually', 'ingenious', 'design', 'idea', 'theory', 'when', 'unravelled', 'compact', 'form', 'what', 'essentuially', 'red', 'black', 'bee-keepers', 'hat', 'five', 'criss-crossing', 'blades', 'inner', 'base', 'saw-blade', 'design', 'outer', 'edges', 'when', 'thrown', 'mesh', 'enclosure', 'activated', 'descending', 'head', 'neck', 'opponent', 'decapitating', 'head', 'retrieved', 'thrower.Probably', 'ponderation', 'once', 'arranged', 'weapon', 'Myself', 'attaching', 'sawblade', 'chain', 'affixed', 'bolt', 'nut', 'chain', 'center', 'blade', 'what', 'essenially', 'concluded', 'was', 'weapon', 'thrown', 'opponent', 'could', 'wrap', 'around', 'neck', 'enough', 'force', 'sawblade', 'could', 'quite', 'possibly', 'decapitate', 'very', 'least', 'very', 'palpable', 'hits', 'would', 'be', 'suffered', 'even', 'struck', 'extremity', 'torso..', 'time', 'considered', 'arrangement', 'removing', 'blades', 'chainsaw', 'wrapping', 'electrical', 'tape', 'one', 'hands', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'essentially', 'wield', 'would', 'be', 'flying', 'first', 'kill', 'transpires', 'bar', 'drunken', 'bum', 'claims', 'be', 'invincible', 'one-armed', 'fighter', 'order', 'get', 'paying', 'bill', 'dinner', 'monk', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'nearby', 'awaiting', 'vegetarian', 'noodles', 'forthwith', 'dispatches', 'dreg', 'swearing', 'kill', 'one-armed', 'man', 'upon.The', 'second', 'kill', 'actual', 'tournament', 'one-armed', 'fighter', 'was', 'present', 'one-armed', 'man', 'out', 'be', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'instructor', 'who', 'alerted', 'monk', 'intentions', 'tournament', 'featuring', 'several', 'schools', 'styles', 'including', 'Mongolian', 'Vlad-like', 'moustache', 'Indian', 'extending', 'arms', 'accent', 'dubbed', 'accent', 'reminiscent', 'Apu', 'Quickie-Mart', 'catch', 'shoplifters', 'reach', 'items', 'store', 'Tibetan', 'kick-boxing', 'fighter', 'here', 'characterised', 'filthy', 'barefoot', 'uncouthe', 'barbarian', 'staff', 'vs.', 'tri-staff', 'tonfa', 'wielded', 'mysterious', 'cloaked', 'Japanese', 'contender', 'lovely', 'girl', 'proficient', 'eagle-claw', 'always', 'amusing', 'monkey', 'style', 'vs.', 'snake', 'style', 'preying', 'mantis', 'etcetera', 'Am', 'sure', 'much', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'was', 'based', 'movie', 'thus', 'sets', 'out', 'plan', 'clever', 'methods', 'self-preservation.Finally', 'monk', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'teacher', 'coffin', 'shoppe', 'temporarily', 'converted', 'battleground', 'traps', 'have', 'been', 'arranged', 'So', 'essentially', 'was', 'match', 'magnificent', 'weapon', 'cheats', 'way', 'survival', 'help', 'students', 'kill', 'afore-mentioned', 'kick-boxer', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'become', 'monk', 'asistant', 'exceedingly', 'cruel', 'manner', 'fighting', 'small', 'shack', 'metal', 'floor', 'been', 'fire-heated', 'order', 'singe', 'flesh', 'soles', 'feet', 'attempt', 'flee', 'out', 'window', 'was', 'met', 'spears.Also', 'notable', 'are', 'garments', 'worn', 'monk', 'most', 'particularly', 'Grammadon', 'robe', 'lest', 'be', 'confused', 'Nazi', 'Swaztika', 'thus', 'asserting', 'indeed', 'ancient', 'symbol', 'signifying', 'four', 'elements', 'Chinese', 'character', 'ten', 'thousand', 'longevity', 'was', 'originally', 'symbol', 'Buddha', 'heart', 'was', 'term', 'borrowed', 'Sanskrit']",N/A

A lot of the fight correography in these 70s Kung Fu film far surpassed what was made in the west and to this day, I don't think western cinema can match the fight correography (with a few exceptions).I can tell that the main character who plays the one-armed bandit never had any formal training in the martial arts or his training was very limited.  Perhaps this is why he always plays one-armed characters.  It's easier to hide a lack of skills if you pretend to have one arm.I liked the film commentary on the DVD but it's interesting that they didn't talk about how the character who played the Indian yogi was not really an Indian but a chinese made up to look that way.  He looked very caricatured.  I can see how something like that could easily be taken as very offensive to Indians.  The character who played the Jappanese fighter however was not caricatured like many Chinese films have done during this time period.  Another interesting thing about the expert commentators is that they erroneously said that the only fighter from a style different from Kung Fu was the Thai Boxer.  This is not true because there was a Mongolian wrestler and Mongolian wrestling is a very ancient original martial art.

This has got to be one of the biggest blunders in the martial arts film industry's history. Whoever thought of a rivalry between a one-armed fighter and a blind man w/ a guillotine hat must've been a true genius.  It's hard to imagine that this film got any praise at all in China, let alone from the reviewers on Amazon.com. The fight scenes are obviously fake with so many missed punches you'd think the whole cast was cross eyed.  There are a few cheap, hokey effects which include but aren't limited to: the decapatation of people by the blind man thanks to his trusty guillotine, the extension of some arab's arms that dramatically choke his victims, and a fight scene in a burning house which amazingly lasts so long you'd think the whole place would've already been charred with the remains of the fighters' bones.  Needless to say, just about every aspect of this film is utterly hilarious.  Nothing can or should be taken seriously at any point during this catastrophe.  The one-armed fighter himself looks like a drunk and you can easily see that his arm is tucked under his shirt.  In fact I suppose if he were to be an inspiration to others as many of my fellow reviews are claiming in their reviews of this trash I suppose I'd have to agree that he would be with many disabled martial arts fanatics.  &quot;Yes my friends, you too can make an ass of yourself on the big screen and exploit yourself to a lifetime of ridicule and embarrassment&quot;.

Influential to video games with its gimmicky fighters, it's flying guillotine, memorable characters(one-armed boxer, blind monk), and various fighting techniques.  It has deservedly attained cult status because of these and more.  The fight scenes, including a long tournament of numerous(although fairly brief) fights between different contenders is worth the watch alone.  Most of the fight scenes are good, esp. for a movie this old.  The only scenes  that kinda disappoint are the ones that contain the one-armed boxer in them(Jimmy Wany Yu just isn't that impressive in his martial arts or charismatic in his performance, resulting in more than one veiwer rooting for his opponents instead i'm sure).  There are some cheesy elements like the dubbing, Jimmy walking up walls(???), some less than convincing decapitations...then again, this movie has flying guillotine-induced decapitations,  Jimmy walking up walls(!!!),  and classic cheesy 70's dubbing!  See, it's all how you look at things or perceive them.Anyhow,  the dvd has a good picture quality, a lot more extras(including audio commentary, deleted scenes, original languge option, etc) than usually afforded to old-school kung fu films,  and again a great extended tournament fight that is reason enough to watch if not buy this dvd.  I'm glad I have this in my collection anyway.

Sure, it's not a ""masterpiece"" but as others have noted, the influence of this film on other martial arts flicks is irrefutable! Now, for the break down:Story- The execution is choppy but the intent is more original than most of its 60s and 70s contemporaries. I won't go into plot detail because that would be redundant.Fight Scenes- It's all about the FU and effects. Obviously, you can't expect Iron Monkey or Crouching Tiger but it's still very entertaining even if it is a little embarrassing compared to today's standards. Though, in all fairness, many could fairly argue that its entertainment value still outweighs that of Crouching Tiger!! I would!DVD quality- This current offering appears to be better than many when it comes to quality of restoration, especially in picture clarity. Obviously, there is some film wear but it's not in the least bit distracting. The sound is also a tad cloudy at times but it doesn't detract.Extras- The fact that such a film would include extras at all is a plus. In this case, the extras are phenomenal. We get some commentary, we get stills and we get biographies and trailers. Sure, if this were a brand new flick we all would be griping but this is more love than most flicks of this type are ever given!!!Price- It's a great deal considering the entertainment value, the quality of the restoration and the extras!!!",5,Fun-FU!!!,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,1493,"['Kung-Fu', 'gem', 'occasional', 'flaccid', 'acting', 'cheese', 'riddled', 'effects', 'plenty', 'entertainment', 'film', 'Sure', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'influence', 'film', 'other', 'martial', 'arts', 'flicks', 'irrefutable', 'Now', 'break', 'down', 'Story-', 'execution', 'choppy', 'intent', 'more', 'original', 'most', '60s', '70s', 'contemporaries', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'detail', 'would', 'be', 'redundant.Fight', 'Scenes-', 'FU', 'effects', 'Obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'even', 'little', 'embarrassing', 'compared', 'today', 'standards', 'Though', 'fairness', 'many', 'could', 'fairly', 'argue', 'entertainment', 'value', 'still', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'would', 'DVD', 'quality-', 'current', 'offering', 'be', 'better', 'many', 'when', 'quality', 'restoration', 'especially', 'picture', 'clarity', 'Obviously', 'film', 'wear', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'distracting', 'sound', 'also', 'tad', 'cloudy', 'times', ""n't"", 'detract.Extras-', 'fact', 'film', 'would', 'include', 'extras', 'plus', 'case', 'extras', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'get', 'commentary', 'get', 'stills', 'get', 'biographies', 'trailers', 'Sure', 'were', 'brand', 'new', 'flick', 'would', 'be', 'griping', 'more', 'love', 'most', 'flicks', 'type', 'are', 'ever', 'given', 'Price-', 'great', 'deal', 'considering', 'entertainment', 'value', 'quality', 'restoration', 'extras']",N/A

Take your head RIGHT-OFF! Even though the production value wasn't very high for this gem of an independent film, the guillotine is very rich in red and looks a lot better than the previous guillotine movies.I very much enjoyed Wang Yu's character as the wise martial arts master, and because he has one arm as a handicap to being a master, just shows how good he really is. The master of the guillotine is wonderful to watch, with the haunting music upon his entrance...It makes you not want to be his enemy. Very good job with this bad guy. There are other good characters as well, but these two are the focal points.The screenplay and plot I enjoyed because of little things that Wang Yu put in the film. Little subtle things like how the guillotine master jumps through his own roof in the beginning, and that is used as foreshadowing. It never gets boring, and the plot is great too. Instead of the hero getting revenge, it's flipped. The hero is being stalked by a masterful killer.
