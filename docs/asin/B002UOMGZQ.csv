1290365,AK0CENM3LUM28,B002UOMGZQ,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","9 / B002UOMGZQIf we ever have trouble with Artificial Intelligence, ""9"" indicates, the source of the problem will not be because of a flaw in the intelligence, but rather in the lack of a human spirit working within that intelligence. Ironically, this point is demonstrated best not through the workings of the rather didactic plot, but simply by feeling very much like a movie created by a soulless machine, crossing off checkpoints on the apocalyptic movie list methodically, while bringing nothing new to the proceedings.Which is odd, because I had genuinely been looking forward to ""9"", but it just seemed to fall flat, like a soda that had been left in the fridge too long, and it's difficult to say why.Wall-Eshowed us that it was very possible to identify with non-human protagonists - but an investment of time was required, showing the loneliness and hopelessness of post-apocalyptic life, and providing a motivation (like friendship and romance) beyond mere survival. And for sheer adventure movie impact, scores of good post-apocalyptic movies have done a superb job of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, so why does ""9"" fall so flat and short?Perhaps its because of our lack of attachment to the protagonists, after all - everything feels slightly *off* from the get-go. The titular 9 comes to life in a deserted world, but the strictures of his artificial intelligence are very unclear. Unlike Wall-E, he appreciates (from the get-go) the world through human eyes - he instantly recognizes a dead body on the floor before him and is startled by the implications. His companions, too, have human insight and emotions, but none seem to know who they are or where they come from - a vexing question that the movie continually dodges. Indeed, the movie leaves quite a few technological and philosophical questions unanswered, apparently in service to a rather rushed plot.""9"" isn't without its good points. Despite the rushed feel of the film, I do appreciate the short length of the film, in a world where most recent movies vie to push the three hour limit. The character 7, too, is a fantastic example of what a Hollywood female can be when given the chance - 7 is a pure ""action girl"" without being singled out as a girl, period (easy enough in a cast with no genders, I suppose). And the movie's experimental, dark nature is appreciated, even if I felt the final product just wasn't as robust as I'd hoped. If you go into ""9"" with medium expectations, you may enjoy the film - just don't go in with the high hopes that I'd had.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Soulless,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,2563,"['9', '/', 'B002UOMGZQIf', 'ever', 'have', 'trouble', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', '9', 'indicates', 'source', 'problem', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'flaw', 'intelligence', 'rather', 'lack', 'human', 'spirit', 'working', 'intelligence', 'Ironically', 'point', 'demonstrated', 'best', 'not', 'workings', 'rather', 'didactic', 'plot', 'simply', 'feeling', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'created', 'soulless', 'machine', 'crossing', 'off', 'checkpoints', 'apocalyptic', 'movie', 'list', 'methodically', 'bringing', 'nothing', 'new', 'proceedings.Which', 'odd', 'had', 'genuinely', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', '9', 'just', 'seemed', 'fall', 'flat', 'soda', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'fridge', 'too', 'long', 'difficult', 'say', 'why.Wall-Eshowed', 'was', 'very', 'possible', 'identify', 'non-human', 'protagonists', 'investment', 'time', 'was', 'required', 'showing', 'loneliness', 'hopelessness', 'post-apocalyptic', 'life', 'providing', 'motivation', 'friendship', 'romance', 'mere', 'survival', 'sheer', 'adventure', 'movie', 'impact', 'scores', 'good', 'post-apocalyptic', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats', 'so', 'why', '9', 'fall', 'so', 'flat', 'short', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'attachment', 'protagonists', 'everything', 'feels', 'slightly', '*off*', 'get-go', 'titular', '9', 'life', 'deserted', 'world', 'strictures', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'are', 'very', 'unclear', 'Wall-E', 'get-go', 'world', 'human', 'eyes', 'instantly', 'dead', 'body', 'floor', 'startled', 'implications', 'companions', 'too', 'have', 'human', 'insight', 'emotions', 'none', 'seem', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'come', 'vexing', 'question', 'movie', 'continually', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'technological', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'apparently', 'service', 'rather', 'rushed', 'plot', '9', ""n't"", 'good', 'points', 'rushed', 'feel', 'film', 'do', 'appreciate', 'short', 'length', 'film', 'world', 'where', 'most', 'recent', 'movies', 'vie', 'push', 'three', 'hour', 'limit', 'character', '7', 'too', 'fantastic', 'example', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'female', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'given', 'chance', '7', 'pure', 'action', 'girl', 'being', 'singled', 'out', 'girl', 'period', 'easy', 'enough', 'cast', 'genders', 'suppose', 'movie', 'experimental', 'dark', 'nature', 'appreciated', 'even', 'felt', 'final', 'product', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'robust', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'go', '9', 'medium', 'expectations', 'may', 'enjoy', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'high', 'hopes', ""'d"", 'had.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

During which, apparently, all of mankind has been wiped out. However one scientist was able to create a set of dolls and infuse them with his spirit and they are all that is left of us as a species.The machines still hunt through the ruins looking for enemies to destroy and these living dolls are on the menu. But when doll #9 finally awakens, it may be time for the status quo to change.I really enjoyed this film and recommend it highly. I would say the film is suitable for teens and older.

Even so, it took every bit of will power I had in me to not walk out of the theater.Granted, I didn't hate it... it didn't offend me, although I felt gypped. The animation is not as mind-blowing as people have said. At least, no more mind-blowing than anything Pixar has put out.The biggest problem with 9 is the writing. Most of the lines in the film are cliche to the extent of being hilariously bad -- just as laughable as the cliche little personalities of the characters 1 through 9. I was literally laughing out loud when I think I should have been... I dunno... moved? Crying? Hiding my tears in order to seem tough?You have one character that repeats the same cryptic line, ""Go back to the source! Go back to the source,"" like some kind of jerk. And that's JUST the thing with this movie -- without giving too much away about the plot or how the movie ends -- the characters are very one-dimensional. They each have their own way of responding to things, and they never develop, change, or progress throughout the movie. I feel as though the writer is trying too hard to emphasize each character's uniqueness, and it becomes overkill after not-too-long. Only at the conclusion of the movie does it become apparent why the writer wrote for each of the characters in this way. Until then, the movie is frustrating to watch. I think it would have been less frustrating if the ""big reveal"" at the end was part of the plot all along. At least then I could empathize with the characters instead of becoming irritated.Some people (either on IMDB or here on Amazon -- I don't remember) said that the viewer just needed to think about what was being said, etc. That's fine & dandy, but really, this is one movie that I just didn't find to be very profound. There is no gap in my understanding of the plot, believe you, me.

And the movie starts great! The world is dead as machines that mankind made to make far for them made war with them. The only living creatures left are nine small golems and at least one skeletal animal made of machine parts and a lot of sharpened metal intent on the killing or capturing the golems. As 9 meets up with the other golems the story progresses well, but unresolved questions hinder what started out with so much promise.Focus Films says that the ""the very future of civilization may depend on"" the golems in the official synopsis. The question is: what civilization can there be with only a few ""living"" golems on an entire post-apocalyptic world? What can the golems do to save humanity or repopulate the world with life? What is the point of creating the golems? Why were the 8 golems hiding from the single skeletal cat-like creature and why didn't they simply team up and kill it?

Now that I've seen it, I'm sorry I waited so long.This movie is visually breathtaking, and that alone is worth the price of a rental.  The steampunk character design is actively fascinating, in that you'll want to pause the movie from time to time to see how things fit together.  The characters' personalities are well-defined and interesting (I'd say on par with a Pixar movie, which is to say better than most live-action movies), and as for the story, it's actually quite engaging and even subtly intelligent.People who complain about the story being weak and feeling incomplete are ACTUALLY complaining that it's depressing.  They'll probably flame me for saying that, but it's true.  This is not a movie for young children or even most adults, as it does not pull punches when it comes to death.  I don't want to include any spoilers, so let's just say this movie would be way more at home with a European audience than an American one.  That's not a slight against the US -- it's just that we go to the movies generally expecting that they'll end up with the good guys being rewarded and the bad guys being punished (or at least converted to good guys), and that doesn't really happen here.  The ending you do get with this movie is just short of brilliant if you're paying close attention.Some people have griped about the story being cliche because it involves technology turning against humans, but that's like claiming the story of The Matrix is cliche.  It's all about the execution, and it's executed here in a way you have not seen before.  (Side note -- did anybody else pick up a reference to the Philip K. Dick story ""Second Variety""?)  It won't be everyone's favorite movie, but if you're willing to pay attention and put aside some of your expectations, it just may be yours.",5,Underrated because it's bleak,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,1939,"['hesitated', 'see', 'movie', 'got', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'most', 'negative', 'ones', 'said', 'story', 'was', 'weak', 'big', 'deal', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'waited', 'so', 'long.This', 'movie', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'alone', 'price', 'rental', 'steampunk', 'character', 'design', 'actively', 'fascinating', ""'ll"", 'want', 'pause', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'fit', 'together', 'characters', 'personalities', 'are', 'well-defined', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'say', 'par', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'say', 'better', 'most', 'live-action', 'movies', 'story', 'actually', 'quite', 'engaging', 'even', 'subtly', 'intelligent.People', 'who', 'complain', 'story', 'being', 'weak', 'feeling', 'incomplete', 'are', 'ACTUALLY', 'complaining', 'depressing', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'flame', 'saying', 'true', 'not', 'movie', 'young', 'children', 'even', 'most', 'adults', 'not', 'pull', 'punches', 'when', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'include', 'spoilers', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'more', 'home', 'European', 'audience', 'American', 'one', 'not', 'slight', 'US', 'just', 'go', 'movies', 'generally', 'expecting', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'good', 'guys', 'being', 'rewarded', 'bad', 'guys', 'being', 'punished', 'least', 'converted', 'good', 'guys', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'here', 'ending', 'do', 'get', 'movie', 'just', 'short', 'brilliant', ""'re"", 'paying', 'close', 'attention.Some', 'people', 'have', 'griped', 'story', 'being', 'cliche', 'technology', 'turning', 'humans', 'claiming', 'story', 'Matrix', 'cliche', 'execution', 'executed', 'here', 'way', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'before', 'Side', 'note', 'did', 'anybody', 'else', 'up', 'reference', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'story', 'Second', 'Variety', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'movie', ""'re"", 'willing', 'pay', 'attention', 'put', 'aside', 'expectations', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'yours']",N/A

I purchased it in Blu-Ray and they weren't kidding on the package when they said ""Perfect Picture and Purest Sound Available."" This is what Blu Ray is all about,i had to turn down my surround sound due the sound quality being so crisp and clear and consistent throughout the whole movie. The blu ray really shows the detail on the characters and scenery beautifully. This is one of the better Blu Rays I've seen.Now onto the material in the movie. Some say its not a movie for kids due to the scene in the beginning. I don't see a huge issue with it, most kids will understand the premise of the movie if you explain it. The characters were all fantastic and each one brought importance to the storyline which contained such a deep message(which has been conveyed in many reviews and does show on the special features). Ultimately the inventor creates the rag dolls, and with each doll he uses a piece of his soul to bring them to life. Ultimately to make up for creating the machines, that are souless beings(it goes much further into it, but I don't want to give away spoilers etc.) This film was very fast paced and not a moment was wasted, I was watching and didn't even check the time once. I do that often when watching movies as usually about halfway through i loose interest. I realize that being an animated movie, generally speaking the time is alot shorter than most films. But the length was perfect,very rarely can I appreciate everything in a 2-3 hour film. They worked so well with the 80 minutes they used, you see character developement, back story(cause and effect), as well as diving deeper into the origins of the rag dolls. I saw bits and pieces of other movies in this picture such as Terminator(the obvious reference to human builds machine, machine gets smart and kills human), as well as the design of the machines which very very closely resembles that of War of the Worlds(2005). That did not bother me, as those are two of my favorite movies anyway. In fact, I actually appreciated it. However, as i stated above there is a much deeper meaning to this film so keep your eyes and ears open :)I had read some so-so reviews on here and I did take them into consideration before watching, but for me, my expectations were surpassed. Everyone has a different taste in film, but I highly recommend this. You could do alot worse for 80 minutes out of your life ;)--Also don't forget to watch the 10 minute short that the film is based on. well worth it!",5,Brilliant,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,2493,"['adore', 'film', 'purchased', 'Blu-Ray', 'were', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'package', 'when', 'said', 'Perfect', 'Picture', 'Purest', 'Sound', 'Available', 'what', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'i', 'had', 'turn', 'down', 'surround', 'sound', 'due', 'sound', 'quality', 'being', 'so', 'crisp', 'clear', 'consistent', 'whole', 'movie', 'blu', 'ray', 'really', 'detail', 'characters', 'scenery', 'beautifully', 'one', 'better', 'Blu', 'Rays', ""'ve"", 'seen.Now', 'material', 'movie', 'say', 'not', 'movie', 'kids', 'due', 'scene', 'beginning', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'huge', 'issue', 'most', 'kids', 'will', 'understand', 'premise', 'movie', 'explain', 'characters', 'were', 'fantastic', 'one', 'brought', 'importance', 'storyline', 'contained', 'deep', 'message', 'been', 'conveyed', 'many', 'reviews', 'show', 'special', 'features', 'Ultimately', 'inventor', 'rag', 'dolls', 'doll', 'piece', 'soul', 'bring', 'life', 'Ultimately', 'make', 'up', 'creating', 'machines', 'are', 'souless', 'beings', 'much', 'further', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'etc', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'not', 'moment', 'was', 'wasted', 'was', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'check', 'time', 'once', 'do', 'often', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'usually', 'halfway', 'i', 'loose', 'interest', 'realize', 'being', 'animated', 'movie', 'generally', 'speaking', 'time', 'alot', 'shorter', 'most', 'films', 'length', 'was', 'perfect', 'very', 'rarely', 'can', 'appreciate', 'everything', '2-3', 'hour', 'film', 'worked', 'so', 'well', '80', 'minutes', 'used', 'see', 'character', 'developement', 'back', 'story', 'cause', 'effect', 'as', 'well', 'diving', 'deeper', 'origins', 'rag', 'saw', 'bits', 'pieces', 'other', 'movies', 'picture', 'such', 'Terminator', 'obvious', 'reference', 'human', 'builds', 'machine', 'machine', 'smart', 'kills', 'human', 'as', 'well', 'design', 'machines', 'very', 'very', 'closely', 'War', 'Worlds', '2005', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'movies', 'anyway', 'fact', 'actually', 'appreciated', 'However', 'i', 'stated', 'much', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'film', 'so', 'keep', 'eyes', 'ears', 'open', 'had', 'read', 'so-so', 'reviews', 'here', 'did', 'take', 'consideration', 'watching', 'expectations', 'were', 'surpassed', 'Everyone', 'different', 'taste', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'could', 'do', 'alot', 'worse', '80', 'minutes', 'life', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'watch', '10', 'minute', 'short', 'film', 'based', 'well']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","There are so few times in life when a piece of entertainment can literally enrapture you but when one does come around, you wonder how you lived so long without seeing something like it. And this was my experience with 9, a single digit movie based on a single digit 11 minute short film of the same name, both directed by young genius Shane Acker.The 11 minute film 9 was nominated for an Oscar in 2006 for Best Short, but didn't win. But it did get the notice of Tim Burton, who had fallen in love with Acker's idea and world. He wanted to see more of 9's bizarre existence and so, in true entrepreneurial fashion, they went out and did just that.I have to admit here that I'd never heard nor seen the original 2005 short upon which this film was an extension (you can now view the 11 minute version on YouTube so that's not a problem anymore).  But after watching this, I IMMEDIATELY searched out the short film. Amazing. What's more amazing is that Acker took years and years to develop his work - and the technology - in order to give the burlap sack-like characters a sense of computer reality unrivaled before or since. And, if it is possible, even more amazing, I found it's visuals to be of a higher standard than the new AVATAR film everyone is raving about. Yes, they are THAT good. Every frame of this 79 minute film is brilliantly colored, muted and darkened. Looking at it, one gets a sense of near hypnosis, unable to pull their eyes away from what is, in every sense, wondrously appealing ...in a dark and dreary sort of way.What else draws you in is the world that surrounds these nine characters. The simplicity (if you think about their names, 1 - 9) is perfectly formed from the beginning. The dangers aren't unique to human history, but to non-humans, this is a weird existence. The surrounding world is a mesh of alternate reality and, yet, familiarity. Songs such as ""Over The Rainbow"" play on ancient phongraphs while WWII weaponry bombard our heroes alongside advanced robots. Tell me that's something you've seen before?!The voices actors were perfect choices, from Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings) as the title character 9, to Christopher Plummer (Inside Man) as 1. Plummer's distinctive voice added a darker quality considering his past acting efforts ...which pulled the story up even further in my eyes (and ears).What else should surprise viewers is that the film cost a measly $33 million to make and is only 79 minutes in length. Whereas things like Avatar cost significantly more and run three times as long.If you really want to be transported to another world, and see what it might be like to view it from the eyes of strangers, don't look to Avatar, look toward 9. You won't be disappointed.

1290384,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B002UOMGZQ,buru buru piggu,"[4, 7]","Released on 9/9/09, 9 is computer animated film about 9 rag dolls, the sole ""survivors"" of a war-ravaged alternate universe, given life through a magical talisman invented by an aged scientist. Termed ""stitchpunk"" by its fans, it blends the aesthetics of a steampunk world (resembling WWII-era Western Europe) with science fiction, action, and some mysticism/ancient metaphysics. At 80 minutes, it is short.Yes, the CG-work is absolutely fantastic and masterfully crafted, but what about the story? The theme of technology turning against us is a familiar one in sci-fi, especially anime. A well-meaning scientist invents an artificially intelligent robot capable of creating other machines, but it is soon made to create machines of war by an evil chancellor. World war starts, and the machines soon start exterminating humanity. The art direction is taken directly from Nazi-era Germany, depicting a corrupt and technology-obsessed military regime, complete with red, white, and black flags and insignias. The robot walkers are shaped like German infantry helmets. This part of the story is shown way too quickly, only as a flashback and a film news reel lasting a few minutes. More time could've been spent explaining this plot element and why the machines started killing all of mankind, and the resistance against them. There is not enough story development here and I feel this is a real weakness of the film. It's presented as a given that the machines just took over and destroyed the world, without showing you the protracted struggle against them by military forces.Instead, all we know is the world is destroyed somehow and all that's left are the dolls and some machines hunting them down. What follows is one battle scene or chase after another as they try to find sanctuary. They're cool battle sequences with some fantastic mechanical design, but they don't flesh out the characters. I would've liked to see how they survived during the war before 9 came.9 didn't do very well at the box office or with critics, and I can see perhaps why. Maybe it was the mishandled marketing strategy that left people confused. Some viewers mistook the film as being directed or designed by Tim Burton and were disappointed, an easy thing to do from casually glancing at the movie poster and seeing his name in big letters at the top, or because of the Oogie Boogie-like (doll 8). Being a first-time feature director, few moviegoers have heard of Shane Acker and the marketers tried to ride Burton's coattails and to a lesser extent, Russian director, Timur Bekmambetov's (Wanted, Daywatch, Night Watch).Maybe it was CG fatigue on the part of the audience, who are tired of the endless streams of CG animations every year. Certainly, the movie poster didn't do anything to pique my interest or differentiate it from a sea of other CG/sci-fi films produced every year. Because of its apocalyptic wasteland setting and artificial lifeforms, some people also unfairly compared the film to Wall-E. And for its ragdolls and dark vision, 9 suffered comparisons toCoralineas well (from steampunk icon Neil Gaiman). Or maybe it was just the character design of the dolls. 9 looks like Sack Boy from the popular PS3 gameLittleBigPlanet, right down to the zipper and burlap cloth texture, but he's not cute at all. This film is definitely not for kids. All the dolls are a bit creepy looking. For example, 5 has a metal plate sewn over half his head from a wound. We have dark, apocalyptic landscapes, and depictions of humans getting mowed down and gassed by the machines. Half of the dolls die in the film, shown in a visually disturbing manner.

1290390,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002UOMGZQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","""9"" is an astonishing technical achievement, and of that, I think we're all in agreement. Just looking at this film is an experience unto itself; production design, art direction, and visual effects work in harmony to create a bleak but beautiful post apocalyptic landscape of rubble and shadow. The character designs, a combination of burlap and biotechnology, are refreshingly original. As far as spectacle goes, ""9"" is mesmerizing, having the power to draw the audience's attention before engulfing it in a fluid, textural world of imagination and style. While I haven't been too impressed with the process as of late, this is a film that probably should have been released in 3-D, if not for the story, then for the joy of wanting to reach out and feel the surfaces coming off the screen. A lot of work went into creating the look of this film, and it most definitely paid off.But for everything it achieves aesthetically, ""9"" is ponderous and enigmatic, a story that requires more conjecture than most, I suspect, are willing to apply. This, we may not agree on. We know that it takes place in devastated future, after humanity had lost a war against super intelligent machines of their own creation. We know that humanity is extinct; the only remaining life forms are not really life forms at all, but animate ragdolls with cloth for skin, scopes for eyes, and numbers for names. We know that the latest ragdoll, #9 (voiced by Elijah Wood), has just come to life in the attic of a formerly well-respected scientist, whose lifeless body lies rotting on the floor below. We know that eight other ragdolls are out hidden amongst the rubble of the city, and that a monstrous machine with an animal skull affixed to its head is after them, hoping to find a special talisman with mystical powers.Most importantly, we know that #9 must convince #s 1 through 8 that there's more to the machine than meets the eye. This puts him at odds with #1 (voiced by Christopher Plummer), who has apparently appointed himself as the leader and rules only through fear. When #2 (voiced by Martin Landau) is kidnapped by the evil machine, for example, #1 would rather let him die and move on rather than try to rescue him. #9 is not wired that way, and the pun is partially intended. Hoping to rescue #2 and discover the truth behind the machine and its ability to suck souls, he relies on the assistance of the one-eyed #5 (voiced by John C. Reilly), the rebellious #7 (voiced by Jennifer Connolly), and the mute #s 3 and 4, identical twins who communicate to each other via shutter-like eye blinks.We know all this is happening. But really, what's going on in this movie? What is the message that director Shane Acker and writer Pamela Pettler are trying to send? That as long as ragdolls are alive, humanity can continue to exist? There is an explanation for how these dolls were brought to life in the first place, and while it is basically sound, it also raises questions as to the nature of the human soul. The final shot hints at a hopeful future, although I can't help but wonder how such a thing would be possible, seeing as there's nothing biological about a doll made out of cloth, metal, and wood. It has been suggested that life, in the strictest sense, is not dependent on biology, that soul or spirit is immaterial and not bounded by organic matter. Life continuing in the absence of flesh and blood may be the message being sent, but as I already said, this movie requires a lot of conjecture.I admit that I might have missed something along the way, and if that's the case, I apologize. Even if I failed to see the subtexts in ""9,"" I can still give it credit for getting me to ponder the mysteries of life and what it means to exist. If you choose to think about this film in those terms, it can potentially be the basis for a very stimulating debate. To make things easier on myself, I choose to focus on the film's technical aspects and how wonderfully atmospheric they are. A mood develops the instant the first shot appears, which shows human hands inserting a strand of thread into the eye of a needle. Much later on, after the characters are established, we take a closer look at the artistically prophetic #6 (voiced by Crispin Glover) and realize he's wearing a black and white striped suit, a nod to Tim Burton, one of the film's producers.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me take a moment to address the film's PG-13 rating. While I firmly believe that children in general can tolerate more unpleasantness than adults give them credit for, be aware that some younger audiences may find ""9"" a bit too much to handle, and this is in spite of a running time of less than eighty minutes. Many of the scenes featuring the evil machines are loud and intense, and some may be bothered by the sight of a dead body (even though the face isn't shown). It's an animated film, but there are no cute or cuddly characters, and the comedy relief is used sparingly. And if I had trouble figuring out the story, imagine what it would be like for a six-year-old. Parents: Take heed of the rating and understand that ""9"" was made for older audiences.",4,The Dolls Shall Inherit the Earth,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,5155,"['9', 'astonishing', 'technical',

1290394,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002UOMGZQ,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","From what I've heard, 9 is pretty much the short story extended into a full length animated feature film. I never read the short story, so I just had the film to fall back on. I went with a group of friends and it seemed like a good portion of them were bothered by some of the voice actors in the film. Elijah Wood and John C. Reilly being the main ones that stuck out. It is a bit hard to hear or see Elijah Wood in anything without thinking of Frodo from Lord of the Rings. It just seems like an odd departure for John C. Reilly since we've seen him in mostly PG-13 (Talladega Nights) and R-rated (Step Brothers and Walk Hard) comedies, as of late. To tell the truth though, neither one really bothered me. I got sucked into the film pretty easily and while I already knew about Elijah Wood, the entire voice cast (especially Martin Landau, Christopher Plummer, and Crispin Glover) seemed to fit their roles pretty well. So that didn't really seem to be an issue.What did catch me off guard, however, was how short 9 was. The film isn't even 80 minutes long, which is only slightly longer than Cloverfield. The length of the film doesn't usually bother me if it's at least an hour and a half long, but paying around $10 for a film this short seems a bit steep. So that may be something to take into account if you decide you want to see this film. I highly suggest either seeing the matinee or waiting to see the film on DVD for this purpose alone.The film itself was pretty enjoyable and exactly what the trailers advertised it would be. The animation is pretty spectacular as each fiber on the rag dolls is animated to a certain extent and the action scenes almost make you feel like you're right in there with them. The story is decent if you don't put much thought into it, but it felt a bit rushed and incomplete at times. The ending is obviously left open-ended for potential sequel purposes (but what would they call it? 9(2)?) Each doll stands out on their own and has their own personality so they're easy to distinguish from one another. Needless to say, the majority of the characters are given a chance to shine in the film. The designs of the machines, what they're made of, and how they're made was also interesting to watch. The film's length is a bummer on one hand, but good on the other as it's too short to really lose interest in anything that's going on.9 throws you head first into a dark, animated, post-apocalyptic world that makes you want to stay strapped in through all of its twists and turns.

Venturing outside, he discovers a desolated retro-futuristic post-war wasteland that architecturally resembles that of Interbellum Europe. Whilst wandering amongst the ruins, he happens across ""Two"" who is, like himself, another rag doll. ""Two"" resolves to take ""Nine"" to take safety, but as they are about to set out on their journey they are confronted by a terrifying machine. ""Two"" is abducted by the machine and ""Nine"" resolves to rescue his would-be saviour. But in the course of his journey, he will face unimaginable dangers, meet more of his own kind and discover the awful truth about the destruction of the world of which he has become a reluctant part...Shane Acker's ""Nine"" marries the sensibilities of Steampunk and ""Pinocchio"" with those of ""The Terminator"" and sets them against a back-drop which resembles the ruined ""Everytown"" from William Cameron Menzies'H.G. Wells - Things to Come;it may just be the most darkly evocative piece of CGI animation that has ever or will ever be brought to the big-screen by a Hollywood studio.Despite featuring a wealth of American acting talent (including Elijah Wood, Jennifer Conolly, Martin Landau and Christopher Plummer) and a largely conventional ""quest"" plot, It's tone is closer to that of the darker work of Terry Gilliam and European animators and cartoonists such as Rene Laloux and Jean ""Moebius"" Girard. An early scene in which ""Nine"" happens across the corpse of a dead mother and child in a ruined car locates it far outside of the warm and fluffy sensibilities of a ""Toy Story"" or a ""Madagascar""; as do the deeply scary adversaries that ""Nine"" faces in the course of his quest (one in particular - which resembles a cross between a Gorgon, a Cobra and a deeply sinister doll - could no doubt give more impressionable children nightmares for weeks)For my own part - and despite it's relative brevity (the film only lasts roughly an hour and nine minutes) - I was transfixed by Acker's vision. He has expanded the scope and breadth of his original Oscar nominated animated short (which is available as an extra on the DVD) and created a luridly beautiful and spookily evocative portrait of a world destroyed through a combination of unscrupulous government and runaway technology. There is a wealth of sumptuous detail to be enjoyed here (in my first viewing alone, I noticed visual references to the ""Manhattan Project"", World War One photography, H.G. Wells, Greek mythology and even one rather cheekily explicit reference to Geoff Taylor's painting, ""Panic In The Streets"" - which progressive rock fans will remember from the inlay booklet ofJeff Wayne's Musical Version Of The War Of The Worldsalbum)  and visually at least, I suspect that this is a film which demands repeated viewings to fully appreciate all that is going on in it.""Nine"" is not quite the masterpiece that it could have been - both my partner and I felt that the denouement of the film felt hurried and didn't reach the logical conclusion towards which the plot was obviously heading - but it is a deeply fascinating piece of dark fantasy which takes genuine risks within an animated medium which for far too long has been the preserve of the infantile. For that reason, I recommend that you turn down the lights, turn up the sound and allow yourself to be immersed in Shane Acker's uniquely gloomy vision.",4,I Think Therefore I'm Burlap,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,3506,"['Nine', 'action-figure', 'sized', 'Burlap', 'rag', 'doll', 'who', 'ruined', 'laboratory', 'dead', 'scientist', 'idea', 'who', 'how', 'gotten', 'there', 'Venturing', 'outside', 'desolated', 'retro-futuristic', 'post-war', 'wasteland', 'architecturally', 'Interbellum', 'Europe', 'Whilst', 'wandering', 'ruins', 'Two', 'who', 'rag', 'doll', 'Two', 'take', 'Nine', 'take', 'safety', 'are', 'set', 'out', 'journey', 'are', 'confronted', 'terrifying', 'machine', 'Two', 'abducted', 'machine', 'Nine', 'rescue', 'would-be', 'saviour', 'course', 'journey', 'will', 'face', 'unimaginable', 'dangers', 'meet', 'more', 'own', 'kind', 'discover', 'awful', 'truth', 'destruction', 'world', 'become', 'reluctant', 'part', 'Shane', 'Acker', 'Nine', 'sensibilities', 'Steampunk', 'Pinocchio', 'Terminator', 'back-drop', 'ruined', 'Everytown', 'William', 'Cameron', 'Menzies', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Things', 'Come', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'most', 'darkly', 'evocative', 'piece', 'CGI', 'animation', 'ever', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'brought', 'big-screen', 'Hollywood', 'studio.Despite', 'featuring', 'wealth', 'American', 'acting', 'talent', 'including', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Jennifer', 'Conolly', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'largely', 'conventional', 'quest', 'plot', 'tone', 'closer', 'darker', 'work', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'European', 'animators', 'cartoonists', 'such', 'Rene', 'Laloux', 'Jean', 'Moebius', 'Girard', 'early', 'scene', 'Nine', 'corpse', 'dead', 'mother', 'child', 'ruined', 'car', 'far', 'warm', 'fluffy', 'sensibilities', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Madagascar', 'do', 'deeply', 'scary', 'adversaries', 'Nine', 'course', 'quest', 'one', 'particular', 'cross', 'Gorgon', 'Cobra', 'deeply', 'sinister', 'doll', 'could', 'doubt', 'give', 'more', 'impressionable', 'children', 'nightmares', 'weeks', 'own', 'part', 'relative', 'brevity', 'film', 'only', 'roughly', 'hour', 'nine', 'minutes', 'was', 'transfixed', 'Acker', 'vision', 'expanded', 'scope', 'breadth', 'original', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'animated', 'short', 'available', 'extra', 'DVD', 'created', 'luridly', 'beautiful', 'spookily', 'evocative', 'portrait', 'world', 'destroyed', 'combination', 'unscrupulous', 'government', 'runaway', 'technology', 'wealth', 'sumptuous', 'detail', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'here', 'first', 'viewing', 'alone', 'noticed', 'visual', 'references', 'Manhattan', 'Project', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'photography', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'even', 'one', 'rather', 'cheekily', 'explicit', 'reference', 'Geoff', 'Taylor', 'painting', 'Panic', 'Streets', 'progressive', 'rock', 'fans', 'will', 'remember', 'inlay', 'booklet', 'Wayne', 'Musical', 'Version', 'War', 'Worldsalbum', 'visually', 'least', 'suspect', 'film', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'going', 'Nine', 'not', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'partner', 'felt', 'denouement', 'film', 'felt', 'hurried', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'towards', 'plot', 'was', 'obviously', 'heading', 'deeply', 'fascinating', 'piece', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'genuine', 'risks', 'animated', 'medium', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'been', 'preserve', 'infantile', 'reason', 'recommend', 'turn', 'down', 'lights', 'turn', 'up', 'sound', 'allow', 'be', 'immersed', 'Shane', 'Acker', 'uniquely', 'gloomy', 'vision']",N/A

Elfman's music supports the mood of this film well.It is important to remember that this is an animation, but not a children's movie.  There is a considerable amount of violence, a novel depiction of drug use, and the imagery of a ruined and desolated world might upset many youngsters.Definately not for everyone, but a 'must see' for Burton fans.E.

The visual effects were excellent and the voice acting was great but the story felt lacking. I hadn't recommended it to any friends. I would have given it maybe 3 stars.Then, I picked it up on DVD. I found a slimmed down version of the DVD with limited extras for approx $10 in a local PC store. This made all the difference in the enjoyment of watching the movie at my own pace and having the commentary and being able to watch the original film short was so much better.Review of the film short:I personally felt that the film short which the creator made for his college thesis was better than the actual movie. There are no voice actors in the short. It was explained that the writing, directing, production (everything) had to be done by the one college student from start to finish. This is a testiment to his ability to make a film from scratch by himself. Lots of film students do this but not on this level. It really is a MUST SEE. They explain that because its a film short and you only see the main character 9 learning to survive an encounter with one of the hunter machines, there was no back story showing how he was made, where the hunters come from, etc. That is why the full length ""9"" was made. I know I said the full length movie felt lacking but I felt the film short was just more entertaining even though there was less back story.I highly suggest people watch the film short and then watch the full length 9.In the behind the scenes they don't have to explain any of the hidden messages or morales to the story. They describe the making of it and why there is more back story shown.I'm tempted to pick it up on Bluray for more special features and better visuals.People have said this is an ADULT film. Well, although it is more mature than the average animation, I felt this is the kind of movie that can be used to explain some of the more difficult lessons in life to the younger generation (if needed).",4,Enjoyed more the 2nd time around,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,2030,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'saw', 'theater', 'first', 'walked', 'theater', 'feeling', 'bit', 'blah', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'excellent', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'felt', 'lacking', 'had', ""n't"", 'recommended', 'friends', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'maybe', '3', 'stars.Then', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'found', 'slimmed', 'version', 'DVD', 'limited', 'extras', 'approx', '10', 'local', 'PC', 'store', 'made', 'difference', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'movie', 'own', 'pace', 'having', 'commentary', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'original', 'film', 'short', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better.Review', 'film', 'short', 'personally', 'felt', 'film', 'short', 'creator', 'made', 'college', 'thesis', 'was', 'better', 'actual', 'movie', 'are', 'voice', 'actors', 'short', 'was', 'explained', 'writing', 'directing', 'production', 'everything', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'one', 'college', 'student', 'start', 'finish', 'testiment', 'ability', 'make', 'film', 'scratch', 'Lots', 'film', 'students', 'do', 'not', 'level', 'really', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'explain', 'film', 'short', 'only', 'see', 'main', 'character', '9', 'learning', 'survive', 'encounter', 'one', 'hunter', 'machines', 'was', 'back', 'story', 'showing', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'where', 'hunters', 'come', 'etc', 'why', 'full', 'length', '9', 'was', 'made', 'know', 'said', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'felt', 'lacking', 'felt', 'film', 'short', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'entertaining', 'even', 'was', 'less', 'back', 'story.I', 'highly', 'suggest', 'people', 'watch', 'film', 'short', 'then', 'watch', 'full', 'length', '9.In', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'explain', 'hidden', 'messages', 'morales', 'story', 'describe', 'making', 'why', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'shown.I', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'pick', 'up', 'Bluray', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'better', 'visuals.People', 'have', 'said', 'ADULT', 'film', 'Well', 'more', 'mature', 'average', 'animation', 'felt', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'explain', 'more', 'difficult', 'lessons', 'life', 'younger', 'generation', 'needed']",N/A

In fact, the German word for nine is neun, which sound fairly similar to nine. Also, the German word for no is nein. Was the character nine meant to say no to one, who said questions should not be asked about their origin? There's also the fact that the war presented here is largely based on World War 2, which was against... guess who? There are also other ways this word could be manipulated into having more meanings that I won't go into here.But the sad thing is, I doubt there was that much thought put into things. Sadly, this movie is devoid of thinking, original, at least. I hate to knock it, because the creator seems to believe in what he's presented. But that's not enough to say that something is better than it is.As stated, nothing in this movie is original. The idea of transfering your thoughts into another being has been done many times and has been done much better in some cases. We get yet another movie with references to World War 2. How many times can Hollywood focus on this war?Then there's the typical ""technology is bad"" storyline. Well, let's see, how was this movie made? With the technology of film, with the technology that comes from CG animation made via the technology of computers, etc. It's not technology that's the problem in general, it's the kind of technology and how it's used.9 is also the typical character who is bewildered by something that is simple to understand but yet, somehow capable of figuring out complex solutions to things the next moment, only to do something utterly idiotic the next, and so on. Think of all those shows where an alien doesn't understand what tears are, but then they know everything else about human behavior.We also have beasts that are nothing but direct copies of other movies, such as War of The Worlds and a few other movies. I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling it. But, then again, there's not much to spoil.I think it's finely animated and the actors do a good bit of voice acting, but there's just not enough here, whether it's in telling an original story or at least telling one that's more than mildly interesting, or even one that makes you feel something; in order to give it a better review.

With Burton producing, you know you will have darker elements as well.One excellent aspect of 9 is simply its depth and originality. It's not a simple animated by any means, as it explores humanity vs. technology in some ways, but also the abuse of power from a high-standing human (The Chancellor). Also, each rag doll has a unique trait and strength that they use to help each other with their cause against the various machines, so they have human aspects. Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, and Crispin Glover are some of the cast who lead the voices of the dolls.Tim Burton fans should give this one a try.

There really isn't much of one here, just enough really to keep you moving without ever actually engaging emotionally (another problem with Burton material more often than not).You don't get to care about these characters. They look like puppets and they feel exactly like puppets going through the motions of a story whose outcome has no more meaning for them than the box in which they will be stored when the puppet show is done.In other words, if you don't care about the mouse you don't care when the cat eats him.The ending of this story is just weak, anticlimactic and, for me at least, totally unsatisfying.I did buy the DVD because of the awesome visuals but I don't see this film finding a place in many hearts or minds who aren't keyed for this sort of thing.

Matot ""GMS""","[1, 1]","This is a post apocalypse story about the struggle of a group of tiny mechanical toys to out live the machines that destroyed the world.It appears civilization halted sometime around 1940, there appears to have been a great war. We have no idea how much time has gone by between then and when this story begins. The only things still moving are a dinosaur skeleton-like killing machine, and a group of tiny hand made toys that appear to be alive. These toys have numbers painted on their backs (used as names), the higher the number the more advanced they appear to be.Sometime during the great war, a scientist was forced to build an intelligent machine that has the ability to make any other machines it needs. Suspecting the ability of his machine to be used for evil, the scientist created nine little mechanical toy people to try to save life, and transferred his soul into them giving them life energy but costing him his life after he builds #9. At first the intelligent machine builds military hardware (that looks a lot like something from the 1977 Star Wars or the 2005 War Of The Worlds movies). Eventually it turned against all life killing everything from grass to insects to animals.The story is thin on details of what came before or why things are the way they are now, sort of a mid-story brief glimpse into this tiny struggle to out-survive the only remaining killing machine. Even though the characters in this film look like cute retro toys this is not a story for little children. While there are no humans and no blood the deaths and the injuries these little folks suffer might be very scary for little humans today. It is likely to be frightening to children because of the realistic expressions of shock and horror on the faces of the toys as they witness the demise of the other toys.This movie is short, perhaps an hour and a quarter long. It moves along at a good clip and leaves little time with no action. It borrows themes from several prior films, like War of the Worlds, Terminator, and Star Wars. Many of the scenes take place just a few inches above the ground creating a very original perspective for a movie.If you are into; history, retro, WW2, action/adventure, steampunk, or sci-fi then this movie is likely to please again and again.

Basically man has destroyed the world leaving a sole survivor to attempt to save life on planet earth.  Ironically the sole survivor is the scientist who engineered the destruction of mankind via the creation of a machine with superior artificial intelligence.  Clearly the scientist has read the Harry Potter series of books and chooses to sustain life by splitting his soul into nine (9) pieces and embedding them into Horcruxes.  It's also clear that the scientist really had an affinity for Dolby the House Elf as he puts all nine soul fragments into socks of different sizes.The story focuses on one sock, aptly named ""9"" and his search for meaning and existence.  He quickly runs into a few pairs of other socks and finds a small society led by ""1"", a cautious sock who wants to prevent his return to the proverbial sock drawer at all costs.  A power struggle ensues where the subsistence based society butts heads with the pursuit of freedom.""9"" leads a rag tag bunch of socks in search of their creator and accidentally awaken the Skynet-like mechanical overlord that destroyed humanity.

I think the movie was marketed wrong in some respects because they made it out to be this big thing ""from"" Tim Burton (A Nightmare Before Christmas) and Timor Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Wanted) which made you think this was going to be some sort of weird offspring of the two filmmakers' styles.Instead, it was a thoughtful and visually impressive film that tells a story that might be a bit heavy handed and might seem simplistic but still does what it's supposed to do. I think some people were pissed because they made it out to be something from one of the two directors (they produced this, they didn't direct) and it wasn't.Sure, it has that whimsical yet odd feeling that Tim Burton imbues in his films. And yes, there are a couple of nods to Bekmambetov's camera style (he likes moving through cracks and odd spaces to transition from one scene to the next). But, in the end it's more about telling the story and displaying the art of the film.Maybe I'm biased because I liked the little things that you might not notice right away. For example, the film is a lot more visual. The dialog in places is non-existent, relying on expressions and inference. And, there are really well thought out places like the library where they used a simple but realistic cataloging system (the strings from a specific page lead to the rest of the information).In the end, this film is more a simple tale set on the backdrop of an alternate timeline with a (heavy-handed) dash of allegory. If you're a fan of 3D animation, you definitely have to see this film. It's not about technology (despite the storyline in the film)...it's more about artistry and doing things like conveying the story without dialog, imagining how a ""new"" world would develop out of the old, and--I guess--thinking about the message the story is trying to hit you over the head with.If you're looking for a Tim Burton or Timor Bekmambetov movie, this ain't it.

Voices for the characters were well chosen and added to the characters connectivity to the story and the audience.Negatives:(1.) The collaboration and underlying egotism amongst the directors, writers and animators was so disjointed that the story lacked cohesiveness with countless storyline holes leaving the nouveau audience with much puzzlement as to what is going on in this story (plot).  We spend so much time asking ourselves what is the source and point of this or that scene that we end up losing the story and more importantly not having an opportunity to appreciate the animation or engaging with the characters as believable entities.(2.) The color palette for this movie is black and more black which is a cheap and convenient device for creating mood but only seems to work for the people who create a film because they know what's going on even when they can't see what's going on. For the audience, viewing a film for the first time and trying to distill so much information, it makes it much more difficult to understand the movie. In addition the complex, intricate and beautiful scenes fail to be appreciated by the audience because they last so briefly while being barely visible. This is another example of the egotism of the production crew becoming so engrossed in their own world with their high tech equipment that they forget about the lowly audience with TVs that may not meet their studio standards.(3.) There is nothing new or creative in retelling the same old story of robots destroying humans and leaving an industrial wasteland.

A lot of hope, followed by a lot of heart-ache.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------These days, the ""producer"" tag is thrown around like Lindsey Lohan's baby sister. It's a good marketing ploy: pay a well known director to use his or her name so people can say, ""a film by so-and-so,"" without actually lying. It's a hype-builder technique, and sometimes the film lives up to it.Guillermo Del Toro ""produced"" The Orphanage, and it was almost as amazing as Pan's Labyrinth. Quentin Tarantino produced Iron Monkey, and I fell asleep for the first time during a kung-fu movie. Martin Scorsese produced You Can Count On Me, and I was mesmerized(granted, it didn't have much Scorsese flair.) John Carpenter produced the only Halloween movie without Michael Myers, Halloween III: Season of The Witch. So, it's a hit-or-miss situation. In the movie 9, we miss, but barely.Who's the big director for this film? Some guy who did animation for Lord of the Rings: Return of the King named Shane Acker. That's no small role, considering how seamless the CGI really was in that trilogy, but please, from that to directing a feature-length animation that would be awe-inspiring? Not too well thought out.The story, as far as I could tell, goes like this: SkyNet takes over the world with their hunter-killer Terminator robots, finally killing off the human race in order to rust in peace for eons. One survivor, a scrawny scientist, creates a gang of ragdolls called ""stitchpunks"" to take back what's left of the world in order to...collect mildew in peace. These ragdolls, in fact, have been infused with the scientist's soul using some weird-looking bottlecap, and it is up to the last of them, 9, to gather the group to fight SkyNet's mother brain, and make the world safe for life to bloom again.Confused? I was, too, especially when Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't make one cameo.Visually, the movie is amazing. All of the animation has a full, textured feel that made me think, ""Woah, is this claymation with fabric?"" This was not the case, but it really was that good. Post-apocalyptic Earth was vast and colorful. Action sequences were intense. In this sense, Tim Burton should be proud to have this movie attached to his name.The story, unfortunately, acts like filler for a visual juggernaut. It treaded a certain middle ground, when it would have been best served on one side or the other in terms of plot vagueness. Let me explain.9 starts the viewer off in what seems to be another unknown world, just like the namesake ragdoll, #9. This is always an interesting concept, as you learn things as the character learns them, and are always wondering what happens next.For a while, the movie stays this course. Then, closer to the end, the movie feels the need to explain the history of the world in 20 seconds, completely nullifying the feelings you have at the beginning of the movie. If they kept the movie going on its own terms without the need to slap the viewer in the face with an explanation, this movie would have been amazing. Instead, we get rushed to the end for the big, awe-inspiring soul theme.

The machines won of course. But on that last machine the mad scientist who was not completely mad built a plug-in that had to be brought and that plug-in is working two ways. It activates the machine if it is plugged into the machine or it is the destroying element if it is activated when off the machine. Then he creates some nice little mechanical humanoids whose mission it is to destroy the mechanical folly that destroyed the world. The last of these little technical androids is number Nine and he will succeed in his mission. The details are in the film itself. It is nave, slightly frightening, definitely sickening about the silliness and gullibility of human beings. It is also full of hope that these little nice mechanical androids who are given the planet after this catastrophe will be better than human beings. Human beings had been created by God and these by a not so mad after all scientist. You can imagine the madness of God who created such an unmanageable species.

Alford,"[2, 4]","Originally an amazing independent animated short by Shane Acker which took him four years to create, it was turned into a full-length motion picture produced by Tim Burton with Acker acting as director. This movie basically juggernauts the concept of ""stitchpunk"".Set in a post-apocalpytic Earth, the film opens up with a small mechanical humanoid burlap sack(which looks like he's out of Little Big Planet)named 9 awakens in a dilapidated building and finds a strange talisman. After realizing the world is in ruins, he encounters 2, another robot like himself. 2 recognizes the talisman as something special, but gets captured by a large robot cat monster. 9 tries to go after him, but is taken in by the other sack-people, each one of which has its own number. Their leader 1 forbids a rescue attempt on 2, but 9 heads out with 2's friend 5. They manage to destroy the cat-bot with the help of the adventurous 7, and 2 is saved. However, 9 gets the talisman and instictively connects it to a large apparatus called the Fabrication Machine activates and sucks the life out of 2 in the process. 9, 7, and 5 run to an abandonned library run by 3 and 4 where they learn the history of the Fabrication Machine. It was made for a dictator-run country who took it from a scientist to create weapons of mass destruction, which of course later on turn on humanity, where in the end they wipe each other out. The scientist who made it survived long enough to put his soul into to the nine seperate robots which make up the little stitch people. The Machine creates a flying robot to capture the other #s, so they seek to stop the it at its source, but not without 7 and 8 getting captured. They manage to free 7 before torching the place, but 8 gets its soul sucked too. After believing they defeated the enemy, the remaining #s settle back for one of the only really cheery moments on the whole movie, only to find out that the Machine survived, which takes 5 and 6 souls too. 9 goes back to the scientist's room where he first awoke to find the secret of the Machine's power. 9 manages to rip the talisman from it after 1 hastily sacrafices himself. The remaining #s then set the souls of the departed ones free into the heavens.The movie is a pretty direct adaptation of Acker's original short movie, except it actually adds the other #s into it, and expands on the whole reason for why the world is the way it is. The animation is very well executed in this, although not much on the Pixar level. It might give off the appearance of a stop-motion production, which is nothing new for Tim Burton, even if it seems to help and sometimes hurt the film in when there are times that they could've elaborated more on the plot and characters instead of going from one chase scene to another. But, the characters are really intriguing, and the dark feel of this forbiding world they live in. There's also a fine sense of scale for these diminutive robots in a land of dead giants. It's a great achievement for having an independent production turned into a feature film. The only real major problem with the movie is that it is a little too short, as minus the closing credits it clocks in about 70 minutes, where they could've added a little more interaction with some of the characters and expanded the plot a little more. But, I'd still recommend this for someone looking for a mature sci-fi adventure film, with some great metaphysical aspects to keep the philosphers happy too.",4,The age of Stitchpunk has begun!,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,3471,"['Originally', 'amazing', 'independent', 'animated', 'short', 'Shane', 'Acker', 'took', 'four', 'years', 'create', 'was', 'turned', 'full-length', 'motion', 'picture', 'produced', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Acker', 'acting', 'director', 'movie', 'basically', 'concept', 'stitchpunk', '.Set', 'post-apocalpytic', 'Earth', 'film', 'up', 'small', 'mechanical', 'humanoid', 'burlap', 'sack', 'Little', 'Big', 'Planet', 'named', '9', 'awakens', 'dilapidated', 'building', 'strange', 'talisman', 'realizing', 'world', 'ruins', '2', 'robot', '2', 'talisman', 'something', 'special', 'captured', 'large', 'robot', 'cat', 'monster', '9', 'tries', 'go', 'taken', 'other', 'sack-people', 'one', 'own', 'number', 'leader', '1', 'forbids', 'rescue', 'attempt', '2', '9', 'heads', '2', 'friend', '5', 'manage', 'destroy', 'cat-bot', 'help', 'adventurous', '7', '2', 'saved', 'However', '9', 'talisman', 'instictively', 'large', 'apparatus', 'called', 'Fabrication', 'Machine', 'activates', 'life', '2', 'process', '9', '7', '5', 'run', 'abandonned', 'library', 'run', '3', '4', 'where', 'learn', 'history', 'Fabrication', 'Machine', 'was', 'made', 'dictator-run', 'country', 'who', 'took', 'scientist', 'create', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'course', 'later', 'turn', 'humanity', 'where', 'end', 'wipe', 'other', 'out', 'scientist', 'who', 'made', 'survived', 'long', 'enough', 'put', 'soul', 'nine', 'seperate', 'robots', 'make', 'up', 'little', 'stitch', 'people', 'Machine', 'flying', 'robot', 'capture', 'other', 's', 'seek', 'stop', 'source', 'not', '7', '8', 'getting', 'captured', 'manage', 'free', '7', 'torching', 'place', '8', 'soul', 'sucked', 'too', 'believing', 'defeated', 'enemy', 'remaining', 's', 'settle', 'back', 'one', 'only', 'really', 'cheery', 'moments', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'Machine', 'survived', '5', '6', 'souls', 'too', '9', 'back', 'scientist', 'room', 'where', 'first', 'awoke', 'find', 'secret', 'Machine', 'power', '9', 'manages', 'rip', 'talisman', '1', 'hastily', 'sacrafices', 'remaining', 's', 'then', 'set', 'souls', 'departed', 'ones', 'free', 'heavens.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'direct', 'adaptation', 'Acker', 'original', 'short', 'movie', 'actually', 'other', 's', 'whole', 'reason', 'why', 'world', 'way', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'not', 'much', 'Pixar', 'level', 'might', 'give', 'off', 'appearance', 'stop-motion', 'production', 'nothing', 'new', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'even', 'help', 'sometimes', 'hurt', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'times', 'could', ""'ve"", 'elaborated', 'more', 'plot', 'characters', 'instead', 'going', 'one', 'chase', 'scene', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'intriguing', 'dark', 'feel', 'forbiding', 'world', 'live', 'also', 'fine', 'sense', 'scale', 'diminutive', 'robots', 'land', 'dead', 'giants', 'great', 'achievement', 'having', 'independent', 'production', 'turned', 'feature', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'short', 'closing', '70', 'minutes', 'where', 'could', ""'ve"", 'added', 'little', 'more', 'interaction', 'characters', 'expanded', 'plot', 'little', 'more', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'someone', 'looking', 'mature', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'film', 'great', 'metaphysical', 'aspects', 'keep', 'philosphers', 'happy', 'too']",N/A

Wilkerson,"[1, 1]","In a post apocalyptic wasteland where a war between man and machines has killed every living thing, a scientist creates nine living beings each called by their number. Led by 1 (Christopher Plummer) they hide in the ""Sanctuary."" But when 9 (Elijah Wood) sets off a doomsday type machine while trying to rescue 2 (Martin Landau) they must either hide or fight for their lives.It seems that 2009 was the year of the return of the post apocalyptic movie. Of course, with the massive success of 2007's I Am Legend it was only a matter of time before the rest of Hollywood followed suit. And it did, releasing Terminator: Salvation, The Road, 2012, and The Book of Eli. The genre even found it's way into computer animated features with Shane Acker's 9. The road to 9 started off with a highly acclaimed, and Oscar nominated, short film that caught the eye of visionary directors Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch, Wanted) and Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Sweeney Todd) who saw the potential in Acker's short to become a feature film and signed up to produce the film. So how does the former short fare as a feature length film?Fairly well, even if at a slim 79 minutes it still feels short on running time. Acker has a real eye for the unique, and his visual creations are breathtaking and at some points even frightening. The computer animation is so meticulous in it's attention to detail that at times you have to wonder if you're watching stop motion animation, especially considering that in the scheme of the world of the movie the robots and the nine are made largely from common household items and (gasp!) bones and other assorted average materials. Ackers also wastes no time diving right into the action of this movie making it a real edge of your seat thrill ride from start to finish.But that's part of the problem, with the short running time of the film and the fact that you're almost dropped right into the middle of an action scene you really feel like you've missed something. Really, 9 feels like half a movie, or almost like being with a couple friends talking amongst themselves about an even you weren't there for with people you don't know. Towards the end you're let in on what you feel you've missed out on, but the movie still doesn't completely feel like a coherent whole. On top of that the characters aren't completely fleshed out. Part of this is by design since the characters are simply parts of the whole, but even the character that should be a fully developed character doesn't feel fleshed out. Because of this the story relies more on the frailties and limitations of stature for it's main characters to cause the audience to feel for them rather than actually causing you to genuinely feel for the characters as individuals.All in all, despite it's limitations in story telling, I would have to recommend this movie. The inventiveness and visual style alone are worth the price of admission (and possible the DVD price), and I look forward to seeing more of what Shane Acker will bring us in the future. That's to say nothing of the all star voice cast which includes Elijah Wood, Martin Landau, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and John C. Reilly.

The movie seemed like the story painted itself into a corner and tied its hands from what could have been amazing. I will give examples further into the review.The plot of this post apocalyptic sci-fi movie is about 9 little dolls made of hackysack material (that are really robots underneath) try to stop an evil machine that makes twisted little, evil machine animals using old parts. Basically, this evil machine has destroyed all life on Earth along with every human. There is nothing alive on Earth but these 9 ""sack boys."" The scientist that created the evil super machine to win a war also made these 9 sack dolls. The evil machine creates a single twisted robotic creature at a time to find and kill all of the living dolls. Once one twisted robotic creature is destroyed, another is created. So its lather, rinse, repeat.There are a wide variety of evil robotic creatures sent out to destroy the heroes (one at a time of course). Each creature seems to have something taken from the movie ""Toy Story."" Things like doll heads, bird skeletons and tinker toys that made up the bodies. It really felt like someone saw ""Toy Story,"" had a nightmare about it and wrote the movie. Because of this fact, the movie just doesn't feel very original.There is a rich back story that it seems like has been done before (and better) by other movies. The back story is divvied bit by bit, all while introducing the 9 sack boys one at a time until the twins. First is 9, ""the unknowing hero,"" then its 2, ""the informant,"" 1, ""the leader who is strict in not facing the evil machine,"" 4 is the brutal thug of a sack boy puppet with a giant blade that enforces the wishes of 1, the list goes on and on. Their personalities were stereotypes with no deviation, but how can there be deep personalities when their sole purpose for existence is to survive?The visuals are good, but it really lacked life. Of course how much life could there be when killer robots destroyed all life on planet Earth? The entire movie is devoid of blues and the color pallet seems to consist of mostly browns. There are bright greens, but not with plants, instead with the souls that get stolen out of the sack boy puppets. The ""sack boy dolls"" themselves seemed stolen from the Playstation game ""Little Big Planet,"" only the video game has more charm with its ""sack boy"" of a main character.You can skip this movie, its okay!

Tim Burton was the producer so look for some eerie stuff. Shane Acker is the director. The human race has been wiped out, and a group of nine little puppet-like figures or rag dolls are all that's left, a spark of life except for some monsters. The movie concentrates on Number 9 who looks like his body is made of burlap with a zipper down his front. He meets the others. Number One, the leader, has a bishop-like hat (and the voice of Christopher Plummer), and his followers have taken refuge in a ruined church. There's a one-eyed puppet, Number 5, that befriends 9.It's a ruined industrial landscape with a lot of mechanical bits and pieces lying around. A forbidding desolate landscape that's creepy and scary is the background for the story. The industrial complex has gone mad. A scientist has left the nine little figures as some semblance of humanity on Earth to carry on in case the human race was wiped out.In one scene some of the nine rag dolls have been killed off, and their spirits rise to Heaven, leaving only a few to propagate a new race.

What makes ""9"" different than the rest is the look and feel of the movie as a whole while the plot is basic the animation is different, cool looking and looks very different from the recent crop of animated movies.""9"" is set in a post apocalyptic world seemingly some time around the World War II timeline where machines created by man have reduced the world to a waste land. After a neat opening sequence we are slowly introduced to 9 characters that are basically rag dolls, with plenty of personality, each different.These 9 are the only survivors after the war, that is until 9 (Elijah Wood, ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy) awakens the big brain of the machines while trying to save 2 (Martin Landeau, ""Ed Wood""). The rest of the film is the 9 trying to evade and fight the machines and find a way to stop them.The problem is it's hard to describe the plot without making it sound stupid and simple, while it is simple it's far from stupid. The voice actors fit each character, 5 (John C. Reilly, ""Chicago"", ""Step Brothers""), 1 (Christoper Plummer, ""The Insider"", ""National Treasure"") 6 (Crispin Glover, ""Back to the Future"", ""The Frighteners"") and 7 (Jennifer Connelly, ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"").

1290453,AO80ZID761BZH,B002UOMGZQ,Joseph_,"[0, 1]","That almost won an Academy Award.Just like I almost liked this movie.Almost.""9"" takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the only creatures alive are several rag-doll robots and a cat-like robot intent on murdering all of them. When the final doll comes to life- 9 - he is born in a swirl of confusion, grief, and mystery. He soon finds the other ragdolls, and, asking questions and braving the odds, he transforms their world as the struggle to save the last of the human race begins.I started this movie with apprehension, because I'm not fond of dark Tim movies, and I don't really love movies that have a dead Earth between its thumbs. But I decided to try it anyways, and when I finished it, I had several thoughts, with more than one opinion.First of all, this is not a ""bad"" movie, no failure in my eyes. It has potential and a deep storyline, with excellent acting and beautiful CGI. But it doesn't feel like great material, like a movie I'd enjoy enough to buy and re-watch. See, the plot is rather confusing, and feels bumbling, with rises and falls that blend blindly, so that it feels as shabby and rough sometimes as the burlap cloth the dolls are made of. With rather unbelievable plot twists (the female doll, 7, who killed the cat-robot ends up being a damsel in distress at the end) and too many monster machines (by the third time they'd killed a robot, I was like, can little ragdoll people honestly kill 'em off that easily?), I didn't completely enjoy it.However, I think it's really worth a watch. It tries to deliver a message about evolution and freedom and peace, and all those qualities are what kept my eyes on the screen for however long it was. Kids really shouldn't watch it, but here's the weird thing about ""9"": it's PG-13, so obviously it's meant for teens and adults, yet it feels a bit like a kid's movie, with no themes that an adult can truly enjoy. So it's really in-between categories, with none to really claim for itself, and that is what really frusterated me about this movie. It could have been an amazing movie, and if the director and all them had just worked a bit harder, I believe it could have been more of a classic Tim-related movie.But it wasn't.

1290454,A3K9PJC6QHCZM3,B002UOMGZQ,J.P.E.W.,"[2, 3]","This story is a good character drama/adventure that enlists some well established stars and some rising stars as acting talent.  The consistency of animation design in maintaining scale reference and establishing mood tones offers a wonderful palette to the viewer.  It is easy to settle in and accept the story as it unfolds as if it were live action.Something of a Darwinian fantasy, but it does not megaphone the rhetoric like is often a temptation in sci-fi/fantasy.  It leaves such elements in the distant background and focuses on character development and character conflict.  The result is a very human drama in non-human skin.  It succeeds on a level that I think ""Wall e"" attempted but didn't quite capture.  ""Wall e"" is still a fair production that made it's mark with a somewhat different tone and texture.  ""9"" is darker but is not what I would call typically ""Burtonesque.""  It is a collaboration that has foundation on an acclaimed animation short (included on the DVD) which was apparently designed to launch a larger story.The story comes full circle with some resolution and a glimmer of optimism.  This story doesn't even pretend to answer all the questions it creates, and I think it works better without trying to.  I think that the best stories don't give too much away, and the same is true of critical reviews.**********After posting this review I read some of the others and have more to say.I believe that some people are confusing plot development and/or character development with an exhibitionist style of presentation that leaves little or nothing to the imagination (i.e. Harry Potter.)  You may not find the development dynamic enough for your tastes but it is there.  This story is vague enough to allow imagination and theological/philosophical perspective to fill in the gaps.  This movie is NOT AN ATTACK ON ANY BELIEF because it serves more as an open metaphor that the viewer can interpret many different ways. Tone and character are what it stands or falls on.It amazes me whenever people complain of lack of development in an action tale.  Even in real life, high stress environments AT BEST put a damper on social or intellectual exposition and AT WORST destroy the life and the motive together before it even has the chance to present itself.  A real action drama isn't a soapbox or tea party or debate.  It moves too fast to ""get to know"" much else than confusion.  Be thankful for whatever ""development"" an action drama gives you.

Together they discover the secret of how the world was destroyed and the reason for their existence while battling ""The Machine."" As the numbers struggle for survival they come to realize that each of them has a piece of the answer to the riddle of their world and they need each other.The characters are computer generated, and they look like sock puppets but you find yourself very quickly forgetting that, and you start to care about the characters, their plight, their safety, their concerns. Each character is developed as fully as it can, even a couple characterizations that could have safely remained clich&eacute;s like that of 8, who is a bully and enforcer of 1 is later shown to have some quite human attributes and when the machines attack it is 8 who leaves all differences behind and uses his brawn to save the others. The other characterization that could have remained a clich&eacute; is that of ""The Machine"" it could have been a static Darth Vader like symbol of all that is bad and evil, but even the ""The Machine"" is shown to have been at one point an innocent that has it's use and functions corrupted.9 is one of the most pure filmmaking experiences I've had in a long time. 9 started life as a 7-8 minute animated short by Shane Acker. The short didn't have speaking parts, characterization was delivered through expression and body language and 9 the feature film carries on that original intent, although not totally wordless a lot of subtle, nuanced points are shown subtly with expresssion, tone, body language, and doesn't overly rely on the human actors who voice the characters. And the actors who do voice the characters do an excellent job. Christopher Plummer, Crispin Glover, Martin Landau, Jennifer Connelly, Elijah Wood all seem to be the perfect casting for the roles.I read some of the other reviews that suggested 9 is a kids movie, but it doesn't seem to be. Yes, the characters are cute and would seem to have great merchandising potential, but the world revealed in the movie has some depth to it. If you want to let your kids see the movie, I wouldn't hesitate, the darker elements aren't that dark, probably less than the average Disney movie and aren't horrific or traumatizing for younger viewers.There are plenty of bonus features and they are all around excellent. There are a lot of behind the scenes looks at the creation of the movie talking with everyone from Shane Acker who created the original short and directed the feature. Production designers of every ilk talk about their participation in the movie but it's never boring or too technical. The bonus features include the original short the movie is based on.As a reviewer you find that good books or movies generate a lot of ideas, questions, and thought as you watch or read, 9 does that extraordinarily well. After watching 9 I think you'll find yourself satisfied with the experience.

1290458,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B002UOMGZQ,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[3, 6]","I really enjoyed the movie WALL-E.  Apparently so did director Shane Acker, who remakes the best of that movie in this, his debut film.  But he also cribs bits from every recent sci-fi or fantasy film that was any good at all.  You could make a drinking game out of spotting them: the eye of Sauron on the body of a Matrix creature; landscapes from of Mad Max or the Terminator; soundscapes from any film by Spielberg.  Acker steals anything that isn't nailed down.In the near future, a tiny canvas doll named 9 awakens in a bleak, war-ravaged world.  In mere minutes he finds eight others of his kind, but alienates their leader and revives a forgotten evil that takes up where it left off.  9 quickly slays every monster the evil throws at him, but only at great cost.  Soon, as the last battle between Man and machine falls to the last one standing, only 9 has the secret that can restore life to our world.This feature caroms from idea to idea with the haste of a small kid telling a campfire story.  As much happens in this movie as happened in Avatar, but with far less control and balance, dragging us along in its breathless, clich&eacute;-ridden wake.  And though Acker posits a detailed world rich with sci-fi potential, by the end I'm no wiser than I was at the beginning, and way more confused.  So many interesting ideas, but so little actually going on.  What a shame.Among the bonus features, you'll find Acker's original ten-minute short on which this feature is based.  The short is so good that it ironically only serves to point up how good the feature isn't.  The short presents a wordless, image-driven world of smart psychological horror and hard-won triumph that I actually enjoyed watching.  Paradoxically, by explaining nothing, the concise mythic short gives us everything.  By explaining everything, the feature leaves us with nothing.My girlfriend and I laughed as we pointed out every stolen image in this movie, hooting and catcalling the whole way.  It's never a good sign if the DVD's paying audience heckles the film.  9 is laden with the potential for so many good, smart, exciting films, but instead of making one of those, Acker makes this unintentionally hilarious mess.  I actually feel a little bad for the guy.

So that was my expectation going in.  However, the film kinda left me feeling inconclusive, even disappointed at the end.There's no real believable setup at the beginning.  There's no real tie-in between the initial catasrophe and the presences of the rag dolls.  Even though it's explained later, it's by then too late to change the first impression: Why do I really care about these stupid rag dolls?  They represent nothing I relate to.Ultimately, mankind gets to survive in the form of three rag dolls who have inherited a world they have no absolutely no relation to whatsoever?  The progeny of a people they have no knowledge of at all?  Mankind is as lost at the end as at the beginning?  They won nothing they didn't already have, except maybe the power to have their misery unimpeeded and uniterrupted by persecution?There's three of them left, with apparently no way to procreate and repopulate, and no real memory of the world before, and no real memory even of who they are.  So what's the point?  They saved the world so the three of them could live in the new world alone for ever?You are left wondering what exactly did this ""scientist"" hope to achieve with his little inventions?

1290473,A204UDH31JJ5ZW,B002UOMGZQ,Logan Stewart,"[0, 1]","I particularly wanted to watch 9 in theatres, as the big-screen sounds and animation for such a movie is something that a home theatre cannot hope to compare to. The movie is directed by Shane Acker, produced by Tim Burton, and features the voices of Elijah Wood (9), John C. Reilly (5), and Jennifer Connelly (7).The film begins with 9, a stitchpunk doll, waking up to a desolate world, ruined from war and devoid of life. A scattering of machines walk the harsh landscape, all the time looking for any signs of life (presumably that's what they're doing). 9 spies a group of other stitchpunks walking on the horizon, and he makes his way out of the destroyed building, grabbing a mysterious looking object before he leaves.This starts a journey that is epic in scale, as the fate of all life is put on the battlefield. There are 9 total stitchpunks, and each one is unique and special. Together they must overcome difficulties and restore life to the ravaged world.To me, watching 9 was like watching a movie version of a video game. The characters can rummage through the piles of junk and customize their weapons or apparel, there's a archetypal antagonist, and the quest to save life fits in there perfectly.I had two major problems with 9. First, I felt that the characters were all mostly flat and stereotyped. The hero is 9, a young idealist. The other stitchpunks fall neatly in line. There's an untrusting one. There's a mean brute. There's a few kind and trusting ones. There's a wizened pair that have the answers to questions. There's a love interest for 9. There's a crazy one, who somehow has the answer to the mysterious object 9 took from the beginning. And the machines are all just wanting to wipe out all traces of life. The characterization for this film fell short, and I didn't feel any connection to any of them.The second problem I had was that the movie didn't seem to have much of a plot, or a backstory, either. Sure, the characters did things, but the things they did were mostly dull and not too exciting. And when they did important things, they were predictable and expected. Even the ending was predictable. And the backstory, which had potential, was typical and lacking sufficient explanation.Despite the flat characters and the less-than-stellar plot, the movie wasn't all in shambles. The film was an absolute joy to watch. The CGI is amazing. The unique post-apocalyptic art style the designers were shooting for worked superbly, and I enjoyed seeing the art in action. The stitchpunks each have their own individual design, and every one of them were cool to look at. Some of the inventions they come up with are also pretty impressive.Overall, I paid $6 for a matinee ticket to an okay movie. Was it worth it? Yes. Did I learn anything or feel anything special from watching it? No. Nothing new, anyway. Terminator, The Matrix, and WALL-E have already taught us not to put too much stock in machines, and that they'll eventually turn against us. Would I recommend this to you? Yes, and no. If you want to see some pretty cool artistic ideas in a bleak world and you don't care to spend money on that, go for it. If you're looking for an epiphany, you may have to try something else.",3,"Meh...

At any rate, it is unique, it is different, it is as far from a disney cartoon as possible. Made by Starz Animation and Relativity Media, distributed by Focus Features. Stars the voices of Elijah Wood, Martin Landau, Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Connelly, and several others. It is a post-apocalyptic world in which all humans are dead, destroyed by the machines that turned on their creators the humans. Oh, those foolish Humans! It is far darker and far more original than &#34;Astro Boy&#34; and others that try to deal with a war-devastated future. It shows that Shane Acker is a truly original visionary.Though dark, there is much hope in the end. The idea of burlap dolls with movement and intelligence -- and souls that can be resurrected to go on to Heaven is daring and unusual for a film. Do robots have souls? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Here a scientist transfers parts of his soul into tiny robots wrapped in burlap. And they alone survive along with a war machine that tries to destroy and assimilate  their souls. The idea that in the end humans are finished and only robots survive is not new. &#34;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&#34; had that idea, too. But here the tiny robots are more sympathetic and they spend the time running around in a ruined landscape trying to figure out who they are, at the same time rescuing their comrades and destroying the Machine. It is an anti-war film. It is also Steampunk in that the architecture, vehicles, pictures, etc., resemble the 1930s. Art Deco factories, for instance. But it is the SF element of future robotics, soul transfer by mechanical means, and robots that live and think for themselves that are the chief motifs of the film. There is no slick, streamlined architecture of the stereotypical SF film. All the backgrounds are of bombed out, ruined Europe, circa 1918.Acker doesn't play it safe. This is an alternate history of what might have happened in WWI that never ended until all humans were exterminated. A fascinating idea,The characters are warm and approachable, aspects of a single mind: their creator-scientist. Some are grumpy authoritarian types, others open-minded inquiring types, others all action and cunning, others mute and autistic yet genius, others inventive tinkerers, etc. All aspects of one human soul.An adventure film in a gigantic bombed out ruined city, a quest, with anachronistic gadgets, seemingly homemade and improvised. Very different from the slick SF films of the usual variety. This is a film that marches off to its own path and refuses to be a cliche of the SF genre. War film, horror film, sci-fi film, adventure fantasy -- steampunk.In the 5 extra feature documentaries nobody mentions steampunk, but it is a steampunk film. And a wonderful one.

There are ragdolls fighting in a post-apocalyptic landscape, but beyond that the trailers don't convey much.  It probably didn't help that 9 was released amidst a swirl of movies with ""nine"" in the title.9 takes place in a steampunk cross between Terminator and Little Big Planet, where the soulless Fabrication Machine known as BRAIN has destroyed all of humanity in an alternate history version of World War II. 9 is a Tim Burton tale of good and evil, as evidenced by the soft cloth of the ""stitchpunk""-style green-eyed homunculi and the soulless red eye of BRAIN (Binary Reactive Artificially-Intelligent Neurocircuit). Similar to the premise of the sci-fi flop Virus, BRAIN sees everything as raw material, including organic remains. It fashions a series of increasingly lethal scouts, all with the sole purpose of absorbing and retrieving the souls of the heroic homunculi.These poor little dolls are in for a world of hurt.  Not much larger than a human hand, they embody all the traditional survivalist tropes of the post-apocalyptic genre: the power hungry leader (1), the befuddled but kind scientist (2), the innocents (3 and 4), the apprentice (5), the crazy prophet (6), the tough chick (7), the muscle (8), and of course or titular hero (9) who bucks the system. In this little slice of hell, the homunculi battle for both dominance and survival.But really this is about fights between little stitch dolls and cyborgs. And what fights they are! There's the Cat Beast, the Winged Beast, and the Seamstress, and of course the BRAIN itself. The battles are as much symbolic as they are exciting, contrasting human vs. machine, soul vs. soulless, emotion vs. logic.There are problems however. The biggest issue being that 9 is as much responsible for the plight of the homunculi as he is the solution.  There are twists along the way, but the emotional heft lent to the struggle of these human-analogues is weakly supported by its simplistic setting.

1290499,A42GFMF12V7XR,B002UOMGZQ,Paul J. Mular,"[2, 3]","The moment I started watching this I was blown away by the beauty & detail of the animation.  We are presented with a 1940's world where dictators managed to end our world with fantastic machines.  The scientist who made these machines managed to try to preserver human soles in the rag-doll creatures he created.  This is their story, trying to understand who they are & fighting against the evil machines.This started out as a school project (which is included here in the bonus material) which won an award and got the attention of others, including Tim Burton.  The story was expanded upon, including some back story on the world that led to this apocalypse.  I strongly disagree with others, to me this does NOT feel like a short film expanded & padded out to a feature.  The story is very thoughtful & moves at a rather brisk pace.  You may find the need to watch it again as you feel you missed something.  At around 80 minutes, the story does not drag on.Consider that the ending comes from the original 10 minute student film (no spoilers here), I doubt this student had any intentions of sequels. Those accusing this film of being the breeder for sequels are just looking too much into the ending.  This is not a Disney movie.Animation wise, this is quite on par with Pixar & is far above much of what is being produced today. The screen is just loaded with lush details & a perfect pallet of colors that help set the mood for that scene.  Great care was taken to get the right hues.Don't be fooled by the single disc release, at 80 minutes there is plenty of room for bonus material.  The unused scenes & alternate ending are interesting, but the documentary explaining the process of expanding the original 10 minute film and the use of the voice talent is much better than some on 2-disc releases.  Other documentaries explain the 1940's look, throwing in some modern day gadgets to make you feel there is something different here, and the use of reference video recordings for the action (nothing new about this, Disney did this over 60 years ago).  You will not feel cheated by the single disc release.

The film projector focus was off a little while watching it in the theater but I still enjoyed the story. I'm sure there could have been more exposition of characters, but the main essence of the movie is survival in an unfamiliar world and the relationships between the characters seemed to reflect this. Trying to understand the detailed lives and relationships of your new comrades kind of takes a back seat to a respectful working relationship when constantly being assaulted by creatures bent on the destruction of you and your comrades. So the story makes sense to me, especially since the movie is about things that occur over a period of about 2-3 days.Now the Blu-Ray experience is EXCELLENT with this title. 9 has very good visuals (very nice textures and animation sequences, all very sharp of course) but where it really shines is in the audio department. WHooAA! The DTS HD Master Audio presentation has very good attention to detail (eye movement, finger movement, body movement, etc..), very intelligable speech at good levels, nice dynamic use of surrounds, and the low end is incredible - deep reaching, finely articulate, and properly loud bass. This is a top tier audio quality Blu-Ray, and very good in the visuals as well.

But what separates ""9"" from the pack is that unlike ""9"", those films were unable to raise the level of the media beyond that of ""kiddie fare"" or fluff.  ""Igor"" and ""Corpse Bride"" quickly spring to mind-each having had great potential for something dark and appealing but chose instead to squander it away on juvenile dialog, fart jokes, gross out humor or misplaced song and dance numbers.  For the first time (although The Tale of Despereaux came pretty darn close) a darker computer animated film has come along along where the tone of the film actually matches its dark visuals.  I can't stress my appreciation for that enough.Make no mistake, ""9"" is not a silly, happy-go-lucky film, nor is it chock full of song and dance numbers, it will not make you laugh, the characters do not burp or fart or burst into annoying song.  That being said, ""9"" is the first of these darker computer animated films I actually liked.  Right from the beginning, the audience is thrust into a dark post-apocalyptic world brimming with danger, intrigue and wonderfully unique characters.  No fart jokes, or silly antics apply here-just an epic journey reminiscent of Lord of the Rings with oddly charming little burlap clockwork people.  Characters are placed in real danger in this film and death is a real threat at every turn.  9's visuals are stunning, the script is well written and the music is fittingly creepy.  If you have younger kids, this film was not made for them.  But if you have an interest in computer animation as a media form and you want something satisfying that doesn't pander strictly to the kiddie-set, ""9"" is your film.

1290508,A30JVMVY6KL3EK,B002UOMGZQ,Robert D. Watson,"[0, 1]","The animation is stunning, the plot is more than a little lacking.'9' is a very short film running about 75 minutes, and it's CGI world is a thing to behold, unlike anything I've seen since the Final Fantasy movies.  Rich in detail, crisp in execution, its appearance is really the main draw of the entire movie, and I think that unfortunately, the directors decided to focus a little too much on what they could do with the graphics and animation, and not enough on telling a cohesive story.Basically the story is about some little burlap-sack people who are trying to survive in a desolate wasteland.  Trying is the key word, since they are under CONSTANT attack from the various smaller machines that are built by the primary antagonist, a machine that caused the destruction of all of mankind.It's a good premise, and full of good ideas, but it's not told in a good way.  First, we see 9 waking up, then 9 meets 2, then 9 and 2 get attacked by a robot cat.  9 then meets more sack people, who are then attacked again.  They go on a little adventure, meet another sack person, and are attacked.  They then meet everyone else, and are then attacked again.  We learn a little about the world, and then there's another battle.  A little more backstory, a lot more battle.  Story, battle, story, battle.  The unfortunate thing is that the little plot we get is actually pretty engaging for most of the film, and could have carried the movie if developed a little further, but because of the constant stream of CGI awesomeness (and it is indeed a feast for the eyes), the story is left on the backburner...and then the plot holes start to emerge.You'll end the movie with a lot more questions than answers, particularly about the future of earth, the motivation of the characters, and so forth.  A lot of questions with so few answers make the ending scene, and the fact that the film is so short, might leave many viewers lacking.  Watching it a second time will show that there were a few glaring plot holes that are easy to overlook the first time, and nearly story-killing the second time.That said, if you take it as it is, you'll be entertained and astonished by how good computer animation movies have become when time and effort is put into them.  With solid action sequences (even if there are far too many), plus a good adventure story, I'd say '9' gets my vote as recommended, but you probably want to rent it.  I can't imagine too many people needing to see it twice.NOTE: You, as a parent, know your kids best, but this movie is a lot like Coraline, which I think was a fantastic movie that shouldn't really be shown to just any child without previewing it first.  '9' is far less frightening, but there are some death scenes which I think might be a little intense for those under the age of 8 or 9.",3,"Strange, yet good in it's own way",1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,2811,"['animation', 'stunning', 'plot', 'more', 'little', 'lacking', '9', 'very', 'short', 'film', 'running', 'about', '75', 'minutes', 'CGI', 'world', 'thing', 'behold', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'movies', 'Rich', 'detail', 'crisp', 'execution', 'appearance', 'really', 'main', 'draw', 'entire', 'movie', 'think', 'unfortunately', 'directors', 'decided', 'focus', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'graphics', 'animation', 'not', 'enough', 'telling', 'cohesive', 'story.Basically', 'story', 'little', 'burlap-sack', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'survive', 'desolate', 'wasteland', 'Trying', 'key', 'word', 'are', 'CONSTANT', 'attack', 'various', 'smaller', 'machines', 'are', 'built', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'machine', 'caused', 'destruction', 'mankind.It', 'good', 'premise', 'full', 'good', 'ideas', 'not', 'told', 'good', 'way', 'First', 'see', '9', 'waking', 'up', 'then', '9', 'meets', '2', 'then', '9', '2', 'get', 'attacked', 'robot', 'cat', '9', 'then', 'more', 'sack', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'attacked', 'again', 'go', 'little', 'adventure', 'meet', 'sack', 'person', 'are', 'attacked', 'then', 'meet', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'then', 'attacked', 'again', 'learn', 'little', 'world', 'then', 'battle', 'little', 'more', 'backstory', 'lot', 'more', 'battle', 'Story', 'battle', 'story', 'battle', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'little', 'plot', 'get', 'actually', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'most', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'movie', 'developed', 'little', 'further', 'constant', 'stream', 'CGI', 'awesomeness', 'indeed', 'feast', 'eyes', 'story', 'left', 'backburner', 'then', 'plot', 'start', 'emerge.You', ""'ll"", 'end', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'particularly', 'future', 'earth', 'motivation', 'characters', 'so', 'forth', 'lot', 'questions', 'so', 'few', 'answers', 'make', 'ending', 'scene', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'short', 'might', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'lacking', 'Watching', 'second', 'time', 'will', 'show', 'were', 'few', 'glaring', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'easy', 'overlook', 'first', 'time', 'nearly', 'story-killing', 'second', 'time.That', 'said', 'take', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'astonished', 'how', 'good', 'computer', 'animation', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'when', 'time', 'effort', 'put', 'solid', 'action', 'sequences', 'even', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'adventure', 'story', ""'d"", 'say', '9', 'vote', 'recommended', 'probably', 'want', 'rent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'needing', 'see', 'twice.NOTE', 'parent', 'know', 'kids', 'best', 'movie', 'lot', 'Coraline', 'think', 'was', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'shown', 'just', 'child', 'previewing', 'first', '9', 'far', 'less', 'frightening', 'are', 'death', 'scenes', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'intense', 'age', '8', '9']",N/A

Okay, whatever. The film opens with a mystery - who is this strange doll-like creature that has woken up without a voice and the number 9 written on his back? He probably doesn't even know himself. So, off we go on a voyage of learning. Soon he is terrorized by lethal machines that snap, stab and attack, then he finds others of his kind. The enemy is alive, but it is sleeping. Then he wakes it up... and real problems start. The movie is not about finding answers, but about righting wrongs and bringing life back - not to its earlier form, but the less-bad situation of the start of the film. How frustrating. The plot, unfortunately, doesn't really make any sense. But, in a way, you don't care, because you feel for the creatures you see, and the effects are beautiful. The creatures are effectively sewn out of sack cloth, and the animation captures it lovingly, as it does the strange lighting and the great action scenes. A very nice film, in spite of everything.

Many of the concepts are clever and new and the elaborate action sequences provide the thrills, though the setting and man vs. machine apocalypse have seen more than their share of incarnations. But what the story lacks in expected profoundness, the generally impressive visual designs more than make up for. All nine ""stitchpunk"" protagonists are memorable and easily distinguishable (the variety of celebrity voices don't hurt), and the enemy machines possess all manner of sharp weaponry and enormous statures. Perhaps the focus on action over origins keeps the excitement from fading, but for a world so full of possibilities, it seems like the answers should have been as exhilarating as the explosions.""Stitchpunk"" creation 9 (Elijah Wood) awakens to a desolate world ravaged by war. Full of questions, he ventures forth and encounters 2 (Martin Landau), a being like himself, only less complex in design. But before he can learn much about his surroundings or his past, his newfound friend is captured by a gargantuan metal beast and dragged away to a mysterious factory. 9 soon discovers more stitched beings, including the one-eyed 5 (John C. Reilly), the cryptic 6 (Crispin Glover), the battle adept 7 (Jennifer Connelly), the brutish 8 (Fred Tatasciore), the mute twins 3 and 4, and their ominous leader 1 (Christopher Plummer), who rules the group with fear and paranoia. In a hasty attempt to rescue 2, 9 accidentally activates a terrible creation, and must now lead the group on a perilous mission to uncover the secrets of the past in order to save their future.The blind pursuit of technology brought humankind closer to doom, leaving in its wake the charred remains of civilization and the arrival of tiny, intellectual patchwork puppets. With little more than a couple of sentences to explain the vast, frightening, ""Terminator 2"" post-apocalyptic world, 9 jumps right into the mystery and wonder of deciphering a new existence and fending off mortifying, robotic creatures. Gathering clues about these strange critters and learning about their purpose is half the fun, although with a short runtime and way too much to clarify, the plot suffers from abrupt solutions. The introduction of a mystical talisman, for example, provides a rather unlikely and vague explication for the formidable predicaments.As with most futuristic and science-fiction films, the setup often requires so much background that either it's left obscure or it envelopes the entire movie. With 9, the setting is dwarfed by the visuals, focusing almost entirely on incredibly creative designs and taught action sequences. The environment is beautiful in its daunting desolation, and the enemies are wickedly crafted from mercilessly sharp, rusty and jagged metal scraps. The nine sack dolls are also inventively pieced together with the oddments of the shattered human race (the remnants of steampunk), and like The Magnificent 9, each serves a unique mental and physical purpose. With fascinating, abrasive visuals, a PG-13 rating and a few scares that are quite intense for younger audiences, 9 confirms the birth of a notably adult computer animated feature.- The Massie Twins",3,9 Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,3396,"['would', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', '9', 'simply', 'instance', 'visual', 'artistry', 'masking', 'underwhelming', 'post-apocalyptic', 'story', 'closer', 'inspection', 'plot', 'actually', 'only', 'suffers', 'too', 'many', 'ideas', 'truncated', 'runtime', 'Many', 'concepts', 'are', 'clever', 'new', 'elaborate', 'action', 'sequences', 'provide', 'thrills', 'setting', 'man', 'vs.', 'machine', 'apocalypse', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'share', 'incarnations', 'what', 'story', 'expected', 'profoundness', 'generally', 'impressive', 'visual', 'designs', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'nine', 'stitchpunk', 'protagonists', 'are', 'memorable', 'easily', 'distinguishable', 'variety', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'enemy', 'machines', 'manner', 'sharp', 'weaponry', 'enormous', 'statures', 'Perhaps', 'focus', 'action', 'origins', 'keeps', 'excitement', 'fading', 'world', 'so', 'full', 'possibilities', 'answers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'exhilarating', 'explosions', 'Stitchpunk', 'creation', '9', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'desolate', 'world', 'ravaged', 'war', 'Full', 'questions', 'ventures', 'forth', 'encounters', '2', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'being', 'only', 'less', 'complex', 'design', 'can', 'learn', 'much', 'surroundings', 'past', 'newfound', 'friend', 'captured', 'gargantuan', 'metal', 'beast', 'dragged', 'away', 'mysterious', 'factory', '9', 'soon', 'discovers', 'more', 'stitched', 'beings', 'including', 'one-eyed', '5', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'cryptic', '6', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'battle', 'adept', '7', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'brutish', '8', 'Fred', 'Tatasciore', 'mute', '3', '4', 'ominous', 'leader', '1', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'who', 'rules', 'group', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'hasty', 'attempt', 'rescue', '2', '9', 'accidentally', 'terrible', 'creation', 'must', 'now', 'lead', 'group', 'perilous', 'mission', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'past', 'order', 'save', 'future.The', 'pursuit', 'technology', 'brought', 'humankind', 'closer', 'doom', 'leaving', 'wake', 'charred', 'remains', 'civilization', 'arrival', 'tiny', 'intellectual', 'patchwork', 'puppets', 'little', 'more', 'couple', 'sentences', 'explain', 'vast', 'frightening', 'Terminator', '2', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', '9', 'jumps', 'right', 'mystery', 'wonder', 'deciphering', 'new', 'existence', 'fending', 'off', 'mortifying', 'robotic', 'creatures', 'Gathering', 'clues', 'strange', 'critters', 'learning', 'purpose', 'fun', 'short', 'runtime', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'clarify', 'plot', 'suffers', 'abrupt', 'solutions', 'introduction', 'mystical', 'talisman', 'example', 'rather', 'unlikely', 'vague', 'explication', 'formidable', 'predicaments.As', 'most', 'futuristic', 'science-fiction', 'films', 'setup', 'often', 'so', 'much', 'background', 'left', 'obscure', 'entire', 'movie', '9', 'setting', 'dwarfed', 'visuals', 'focusing', 'almost', 'entirely', 'incredibly', 'creative', 'designs', 'taught', 'action', 'sequences', 'environment', 'beautiful', 'daunting', 'desolation', 'enemies', 'are', 'wickedly', 'crafted', 'mercilessly', 'sharp', 'rusty', 'jagged', 'metal', 'scraps', 'nine', 'sack', 'dolls', 'are', 'also', 'inventively', 'pieced', 'together', 'oddments', 'shattered', 'human', 'race', 'remnants', 'steampunk', 'Magnificent', '9', 'unique', 'mental', 'physical', 'purpose', 'fascinating', 'abrasive', 'visuals', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'few', 'scares', 'are', 'quite', 'intense', 'younger', 'audiences', '9', 'birth', 'notably', 'adult', 'computer', 'animated', 'feature.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

There had only been the machines that he had built to keep himself from becoming obsolete, and there had been the carnage that these things left behind. One creator, did something different, however, and had left something differtent behind. By instilling everything he had within a few patchwork dolls, he had left a few seemingly small dolls to look after the world mankind was leaving behind. And, amongst them, was the newly awakening 9.When I watched the movie the first time, I managed to get ahold of an advanced DVD and really didn't know anything about it. When I read the back I wasn't sure what to expect, either, but what I found was a story that went well beyond compelling. We pick up the story as 9 awakens, and we follow him through a world that looks like it has been bled slowly. Seeing things this way helps introduce the world, too, because the world we see is being viewed through new eyes on both our front and on 9's front. So, the atmosphere that is instilled is very moody and very dark, but it still maintains a touch of innocence because of 9.The look of the movie itself is very inspired as well. I really loved the way all the textures could be seen very beautifully, and i loved how everything - from size to the sinister way that certain things looked - impacted each frame. The movie looked really thought out and like it had been worked on for quite some time and, had it been advertised a little better, it seemed like it would have hit a lot harder than it did.Aside from the look of the place and the climate that this cast, there was also the storyline that we were given. Not only did we see 9 when he woke to this new world, but we also saw a piece of something esle that seemed rather insignificant at the time. As we watch and as our cast grows we see how this piece becomes something more, just as 9 becomes something more. This leads to quite a few plot twists and turns, making for a movie that I not only enjoyed watching but that I would enjoy watching more than once. From the question of ""what is 9"" to the notion of ""what exists within this world,"" everything had an answer. I liked that, too, because too few answers sometimes hurts a story just as badly as over-explanation can.While not something I would show to little kids, i thought the movie - while dark - was not overly dark and could be something all ages could enjoy. Sure, little ones could have nightmares and I WOULD watch it first to see if I approved of it - different parents, different tastes - I can say that I have seen movies that were a lot darker and were showcased for a lot younger audience. I also have to say that I enjoyed this as an adult, and this does not normally happen when I sit down and watch a kid's flick. So, would recommend this movie? Amen. Despite the fact that it did not have much to offer on the ""bonus front"" (some people care about this - I am not one of those), I can say that this movie touched me and that i liked it. Perhaps others would disagree and, if so, that is their argument to be made.

It IS for smart kids(with intelligent parents who can explain it to them) maybe age 7 and up.

That's another thing I HATE about the Pixars: kid jokes that are meant to be hip and quirky but instead are hopelessly obnoxious, and adult humor that never ventures beyond the comedy palette of the soccer mom.

1290531,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B002UOMGZQ,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 0]","When it comes to the world of animation, creative juices go in every direction. Still, in the end the finished product is going to be the make or break of the outcome when giving your gift to the public. Unfortunately when it comes to animation it is normally associated with family and child appeal. At this point in animations history unless your work relates to immaturity or pop culture humiliation it will be very seldom and an adult audience will find interest.With all that said we are introduced to the film `9'. The backdrop is a post apocalyptic world where the human race was destroyed by man made machines. Now, we can immediately point a finger and say rip off, until we are introduced to the main characters which happen to be man made rag dolls. 9 is the newest one who awakes long after the battle is over. He has no idea where he is or why is he here. All he knows is that he holds something important and the friends he meets along the way help him piece together his past as well as his purpose and what he must do to rebuild the future.Shane Acker, the director of `9' originally had these characters in an academy award nominated short film. To spread this story out into a 90 minute film was a challenge and in my opinion broke new ground at the same time is still incomplete. The first major positive without a doubt had to be the concept. For animation a drama is not something you usually see. The plot falls on the lines of Don Bluth story telling like `An American Tale' or `Titan AE'. Those films have the same first major flaw, which is the attempt to make an animated drama non child oriented. While `9' does have a PG-13 rating, it is because of the scary cyberpunk like machines that run amuck and of course the fact that characters die. However, that brings the second flaw which is the lack of dialogue. As much as Shane Acker wants his worlds to be based upon visuals, the movie going public needs dialogue due to its dying attention span. The dialogue was very well done because of its stellar voice cast. It really brought those rag dolls heart and made them believable. What I loved the most about this movie was the whole mystery of the discovering the reason why these characters were here. In the beginning you knew who was creating them, but you didn't know why he was. In the end when all is brought into fruition you reflect on everything you saw and are left in complete awe.

1290534,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B002UOMGZQ,Westley,"[75, 93]","""9"" is an animated film based on the 2005 Academy Award nominated short film of the same name (which is included on the DVD).  The film is the work of animator Shane Acker and was co-produced by Tim Burton, who got involved with the project after seeing Acker's short film.  Although Burton did not write or direct ""9,"" the film is very consistent with his past animated work such as ""Corpse Bride.""  Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the movie focuses on a rag doll robot (!) named 9 who suddenly becomes sentient.  As he explores his world, he discovers that the only other inhabitants are other, similarly numbered rag doll robots as well as a strange cat-like machine who hunts them.  He befriends the other robots and changes their world drastically.The world created in this film is fascinating and unlike any other animated film I've seen.  I particularly loved the use of contrasts, including having the robots made of burlap and other unexpected materials (Acker has referred to the bots as ""stitchpunks"").  The ""look"" of ""9"" is by far its main draw, though, because unfortunately the plot is a rather drab and predictable affair with the robots fighting the cat-like machine (and then other machines).  I found myself getting irritated by the repetitious battles and wanted to see more of this intriguing world.  Likewise, I wanted to see more of the adorable ""stitchpunks,"" especially the ""cataloguing"" scholars 3 and 4.  Unfortunately, as soon as the robots are introduced they almost immediately start chasing the machines.As with other Tim Burton produced animated films, ""9"" is not targeted toward children (it's rated PG-13); however, the plot was too juvenile to keep me interested.  I actually strongly preferred the short film, which I watched after the feature-length movie.  Indeed, the short film packs a real emotional wallop that is sadly missing in the full-length version.  ""9"" is a noble failure (well semi-failure), and I applaud what Acker and Burton have tried to accomplish with this terrific looking film.  I just wish that the plot had been worthy of the animation.",3,"""We had such potential, such promise.""",1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,2097,"['9', 'animated', 'film', 'based', '2005', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'short', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'included', 'DVD', 'film', 'work', 'animator', 'Shane', 'Acker', 'was', 'co-produced', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'project', 'seeing', 'Acker', 'short', 'film', 'Burton', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'direct', '9', 'film', 'very', 'consistent', 'past', 'animated', 'work', 'such', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'Set', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'movie', 'rag', 'doll', 'robot', 'named', '9', 'who', 'suddenly', 'sentient', 'world', 'only', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'other', 'similarly', 'numbered', 'rag', 'doll', 'robots', 'as', 'well', 'strange', 'cat-like', 'machine', 'who', 'other', 'robots', 'changes', 'world', 'drastically.The', 'world', 'created', 'film', 'fascinating', 'other', 'animated', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'particularly', 'loved', 'use', 'contrasts', 'including', 'having', 'robots', 'made', 'burlap', 'other', 'unexpected', 'materials', 'Acker', 'referred', 'bots', 'stitchpunks', 'look', '9', 'far', 'main', 'draw', 'though', 'unfortunately', 'plot', 'rather', 'drab', 'predictable', 'affair', 'robots', 'fighting', 'cat-like', 'machine', 'then', 'other', 'machines', 'found', 'getting', 'irritated', 'repetitious', 'battles', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'intriguing', 'world', 'Likewise', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'adorable', 'stitchpunks', 'especially', 'cataloguing', 'scholars', '3', '4', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'soon', 'robots', 'are', 'introduced', 'almost', 'immediately', 'start', 'chasing', 'machines.As', 'other', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'produced', 'animated', 'films', '9', 'not', 'targeted', 'children', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'however', 'plot', 'was', 'too', 'juvenile', 'keep', 'interested', 'actually', 'strongly', 'preferred', 'short', 'film', 'watched', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'short', 'film', 'real', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'sadly', 'missing', 'full-length', 'version', '9', 'noble', 'failure', 'well', 'semi-failure', 'applaud', 'what', 'Acker', 'Burton', 'have', 'tried', 'accomplish', 'terrific', 'looking', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'worthy', 'animation']",N/A

1290536,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002UOMGZQ,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[51, 70]","Based on the award-winning short film by Shane Acker, the CGI-animated full-length feature film ""9"" intends to expand on its myth and story. Acker himself takes the helm as director in this film co-produced by Tim Burton along with Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted). When I first saw the trailer for ""9"", I was blown away. I tempered my expectations when I went into the theater and did watch the film with an open mind. The film is a visually stunning piece with superb set designs and fluid animation whose style may have been inspired by traditional stop-motion animation.In unknown time and place, a curious doll-like creature with the number ""9"" (Elijah Wood) on its back awakens to find his supposed creator (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) dead. ""9"" has awakened in a barren world, this world is now a wasteland, destroyed by war; a war waged between humans and machines. ""9"" discovers that he is not alone, stumbling across a similar creature called ""2"" (Martin Landau) who also gets kidnapped by a mechanical monster. ""9"" then discovers that he is a ""stitch punk"" and there are more of his kind being led by ""1"" (Christopher Plummer). ""9"" sets out to rescue ""2"" but instead awakens an evil with the use of a talisman that may doom them all. It is now up to ""9"" and his brethren to try to discover the truth behind their creation....""9"" is the last created ""stitch punk"" and he is the final piece of the puzzle in the ""9"" mythos. These creatures are miniature creations that resemble a sack held together by either leather strings, metal snaps, buttons, zippers, or shoe strings. They have camera-like eyes and instant access to their innards. The characters in ""9"" are well thought out, # 1 is the supposed leader and the cautious kind--whose sensibilities are all about preservation. # 2 is the explorer and the inventor. # 3 and 4 are twins who are also mute, they keep the history of mankind. # 5 (John C. Reilly) is a healer and a skilled mechanic. # 6 (Crispin Glover) has near-psychic abilities who channels his visions through his drawings. # 7 (Jennifer Connelly) is a warrior and # 8 is the bodyguard of # 1, strong and fierce, yet innocent in a way. # 9 is the curious, selfless protagonist of the film. There is something relevant in the number ""9"", one can say that they are different ""characters"" or potentials of mankind. Acker definitely intended the film to revolve around the creatures in creating this world so full of obstacles that this miniaturized creatures can take advantage of with their size. Acker's keenness and passion for his creations are the film's highlights; the film is a stunning work of visual marvel and storytelling. It is a grand display of idiosyncrasy.The world that the ""stitch punks"" live in is pretty barren with nothing else left living. While the characters can indeed be enthralling, Acker does lose his way a little in the film's direction. When you think about the plot in ""9""; it makes very little sense. I found it hard to believe that `stitch punks' #'s 1-8 never had the chance to try and figure out their reasons of being. # 7 also points out that there is a battle but none were visible, save one mechanical beast, which was by the way dispatched so easily. No other machines were shown up until the `awakening' was brought into bear. I also found it hard to believe that there are no other surviving `organisms'; war is indeed horror but insects would always survive. Details were left out, giving the viewer several plot gaps to fill in.The `stitch punks' characterization seem to be presented as they know what to do, but they don't know what and why they are there for. I found hard to buy into the fact that these creatures were designed as the `hope for the future' when they obviously were just contented to exist until events triggered by ""9"" managed to set things in motion. Time (and the passage of) needed to be more specific in the film to give the film's plot needed credibility. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered such as; why did it take so long for ""9"" to come along? How did the professor survive all those years? How many years have passed? The film's final act attempts to explain everything that also gives a sense of the mystical but it doesn't match its past groundwork. If they were meant to reignite the earth, then other things that you factor in such as the `mechanical monster-maker' would serve no purpose (can't discuss without spoiling the movie). The film is all about belief, philosophy and destiny with no viable application or expediency.The animation-work in ""9"" is nicely executed. The colors, set designs are no means something really groundbreaking but I did appreciate its style. It does convey a mood that matches the film's tone. The film is also quite action-packed that action lovers will no doubt be entertained. The designs of the mechanical beasts were good, they mimic things that can be just freaky. The world of ""9"" is meticulously crafted. The film is a sci-fi mystery until things start to get moving, and the film becomes an actioner with plenty of swift although a bit repetitive movements. ""7's"" moves become redundant after awhile.""9"" isn't exactly a bad film but the film does feel too short and would have benefited to be much longer. Acker's storytelling had a lot of things going for it, but it just curiously stopped short in its execution and never realizes its journey. The `stitch punks' were involved in a mystery that had some compelling things going for it but they just weren't allowed to move around the depths of its core. Acker does rely too much on theatrics and never allows the viewer for a `nesting` stage to augment the wonder. The film is an average CGI-generated flick that may please those who like special-effects blockbusters but will turn off those who look for an intricate storyline. I appreciate brainless entertainment, but ""9"" pretends to have something deeper and ends up not fulfilling its promise. But ""9"" has its originality and vision. It is conscious that it is mighty eccentric and interesting; too bad the resolution is unsatisfying.Recommended with caution, Rent it first  [3 Stars= Good, Flawed But with Redeeming
