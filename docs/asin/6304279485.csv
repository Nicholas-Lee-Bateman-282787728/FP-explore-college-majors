While the title is ""Get up and Dance"", it doesn't always show the moves, and the choppy editing makes it hard for a young child to follow.  The dance instructor's voice is shrill and she yells instead of singing.  I'm assuming that was simply for her to be heard over the children, but it is unpleasant to listen to.  ""I'm a Little Airplane"" is a cute, retro sounding song that looks like a music video, but unless you dance with your child, there's no ""dance"" instruction with this song.  My 2 year old loves Elmo, and there is a song at the end where Elmo dances- basically it looks like an Elmo puppet shaken in front of a black screen for about of half of the song, and then it cuts off.  Obviously there are other children who do enjoy this video, but I recommend that you rent, borrow or check it out of the library first to see if your child likes it before you buy.",1,Disappointing,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,1020,"['hate', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'leave', 'bad', 'review', 'video', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'same', 'standards', 'other', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'productions', 'title', 'Get', 'up', 'Dance', ""n't"", 'always', 'show', 'moves', 'choppy', 'editing', 'hard', 'young', 'child', 'follow', 'dance', 'instructor', 'voice', 'shrill', 'instead', 'singing', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'was', 'simply', 'be', 'heard', 'children', 'unpleasant', 'listen', ""'m"", 'Little', 'Airplane', 'cute', 'retro', 'sounding', 'song', 'music', 'video', 'dance', 'child', 'dance', 'instruction', 'song', '2', 'year', 'old', 'Elmo', 'song', 'end', 'where', 'Elmo', 'dances-', 'basically', 'Elmo', 'puppet', 'shaken', 'front', 'black', 'screen', 'half', 'song', 'then', 'off', 'Obviously', 'are', 'other', 'children', 'who', 'do', 'enjoy', 'video', 'recommend', 'rent', 'borrow', 'check', 'library', 'first', 'see', 'child', 'buy']",Sesame Street - Get Up and Dance VHS

""Amazon Junkie""","[0, 0]","I wanted a DVD that featured children (not animation) and encouraged movement (instead of just passive sitting on the floor watching the TV).  My 19 month old was entranced and we danced around for almost the whole DVD. She loved it.  Like any Sesame Street DVD it is produced well - no shaky camera syndrome.

411011,A3BKNXX8QFIXIV,6304279485,"J. Finkel ""Jack of Trades""","[0, 0]","'Sesame Street: Get Up and Dance' is 30 minutes of outrageous fun and exercise for my 2 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves Sesame Street and she has no interest in any other programs, which is good since Sesame Street is somewhat educational.  Her favorite character is Big Bird, so naturally she was going to love this video no matter what.  The narrative involves Big Bird throwing an impromptu dance party for Radar's birthday, complete with imaginary pizza and lots of kids to demonstrate the dances.My wife and I love the DVD just as much because it gives us alternative to having her veg out on the couch when she really wants to watch something on TV.  Throughout the entire half hour she won't even sit down and it seems she gets quite a workout.  Not a day goes by that she won't request watching this DVD.  It is also great for when my daughter is playing with her friend - they will dance along together and get even more wound up.  If I'm not too busy, I'll dance along too...and we often break out into one of the dances from this video randomly during the day (a nice change up from the hokey pokey).",5,BEST Video We Own,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1120,"[""'Sesame"", 'Street', 'Get', 'Up', 'Dance', '30', 'minutes', 'outrageous', 'fun', 'exercise', '2', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'absolutely', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'interest', 'other', 'programs', 'good', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'somewhat', 'educational', 'favorite', 'character', 'Big', 'Bird', 'so', 'naturally', 'was', 'going', 'love', 'video', 'matter', 'what', 'narrative', 'Big', 'Bird', 'throwing', 'impromptu', 'dance', 'party', 'Radar', 'birthday', 'complete', 'imaginary', 'pizza', 'lots', 'kids', 'demonstrate', 'dances.My', 'wife', 'love', 'DVD', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'alternative', 'having', 'veg', 'couch', 'when', 'really', 'watch', 'something', 'TV', 'entire', 'half', 'hour', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'sit', 'down', 'quite', 'workout', 'Not', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'request', 'watching', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'when', 'daughter', 'playing', 'friend', 'will', 'dance', 'together', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'wound', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'busy', ""'ll"", 'dance', 'along', 'too', 'often', 'break', 'out', 'one', 'dances', 'video', 'randomly', 'day', 'nice', 'change', 'up', 'hokey', 'pokey']",Sesame Street - Get Up and Dance VHS

They still enjoy it just as much and the picture quality seems better.I grew up with sesame street and they still are the best when it comes to childrens programs.  I had parents who exposed me to jazz.  I love it and so do my sons so seeing the legendary Joe Williams perform Birdland Jump at the ""Birdland"" club was worth purchasing this alone. (If your parents were jazz fans you will love this subtle nod to jazz traditions and Charlie Parker.)The dance teacher character has a loud voice but not unlike the voice a teacher would use to be heard over a room full of active kids who are all taking at once, to me it did not seem annoying - a matter of taste.In fairness to the other reviewers the plot is Bigbird throwing a dance party.
