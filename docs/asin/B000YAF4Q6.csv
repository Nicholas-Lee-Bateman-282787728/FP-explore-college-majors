1118225,A1X93ES4DITTWK,B000YAF4Q6,Blueberry Muffin,"[19, 27]","I took my teenage sister to see this movie last week. If Chris Brown wasn't in it, I don't think she would've been interested. Chris Brown, by the way, really impressed me in this movie. His acting is great and his singing, in my opinion, has improved a lot. I thought he was great in ""Stomp the Yard"" despite his small role and I would love to see him in more movies in the future.At first glance, ""This Christmas"" seems like a family film. However, if you do watch this with your family, make sure there are no little children around because there are too many inappropriate things in this movie:1) The mother in the film, Loretta, and her boyfriend Joe, who is a DEACON in a church,  have been living together -in Loretta's house- for the past several years. They're not married and Loretta's youngest son ""Baby"" accuses her of being afraid of marrying Joe due to a bad marriage she had in the past. I thought Joe was going to propose to Loretta at the end of the movie, but it never happened.3)The oldest daughter, Lisa, has a husband, Malcome, who is cheating on her. While he is in the shower, Lisa confronts him about it. Malcome, not knowing that Lisa squirted baby oil all over the floor, wraps  his lower body with a towel and comes out of the shower. The entire scene is of Malcome slipping and sliding on the bathroom floor with Lisa beating him with a leather belt. Even though Malcome is wearing a towel, he is not fully overed, he's slipping and sliding on the floor AND YOU CAN SEE HIS PRIVATE PARTS AS HE ATTEMPTS TO GET UP OFF THE FLOOR. I saw TOO much. Laz Alonso is an extremely handsome man, but the entire scene looked like S&M; to me.2) The middle daughter, Kelli, has a one night stand with a guy she met at the club. A few days later she sneaks this STRANGER inside her mother's house so they can  sleep together. Supposedly they went to high school together and the guy claimed he liked her back in the day, but I don't know. For a successful Harvad-educated woman getting up in age, I guess Kelli was desperate for a man.3) The youngest daughter, Mel, brings her boyfriend over for the holidays. They are only boyfriend/girlfriend, but they are allowed to sleep together in the same bed as well as play hanky panky in the closet and it's no big deal even though there is a young niece and nephew and other family members in the house.Sorry, that I gave away parts of the movie, but this isn't a Huxtable Christmas movie and people need to know this before watching it with children around.

Yes I laughed a good 10 times (that's a lot for a film).Chris Brown can't act. Yeah he needs to stick with singing. But you know, who cares, the film was fun.This isn't G rated family fun. The PG-13 comes from two scenes, one a lingerie scene that is, well PG-13 warm. The other is when Kelli decides to get revenge on her husband Malcom and mercilessly whips him with a belt after he falls on baby oil. It's a very funny scene, but PG-13.Delroy Lindo and Loretta Devine are really wonderful in this film. Delroy in particular is good here as the Deacon lover.Yes it's predictable. Yes it's campy. I did fast forward through a lot of the music, not because I didn't care for it. The director left almost full songs in here and it seriously interrupted the story flow.The sound mix was also off pretty badly, voices were very muted and low volume; and the music was very loud.

Regina King is one of my favorites and she definitely did not disappoint in this movie. Idris Elba and Columbus Short are so handsome their mere presence made this movie enjoyable to watch.The family drama, in my opinion, was not plausible. Although it's never really stated, from conversations it appears that Senior, the husband of the matriarch Ma'Dere has been gone for many years. All of her children grew up without him, and are now adults. It just made no sense to me that she'd still be afraid of how they would feel if she divorced him and moved on with her life.My other issue with this movie was that although it's titled This Christmas, and has lots of Christmas songs playing in the background, Christmas was more of a prop or back-drop for this movie than a major theme. This film could easily take place at Easter, Thanksgiving, or even the 4th of July and nothing about the plot would need to be changed.But this was an enjoyable movie.

I enjoyed Soul Food, but this movie is much better!Regina King is a beautiful, talented actress who does well in both dramatic and comedic roles. If you want a good laugh, you have got to see her in this movie! Delroy Lindo is cool no matter what role he plays. Idris Elba is a fine actor who brought depth to the film.

1118283,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000YAF4Q6,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[12, 23]","Cons: I despised the movie ""Waiting to Exhale"" because I think women who destroy a man's property because she's mad that he's cheating on her is not only corny, but it's childish. There was an SUV scene in this movie that was beyond stupid to me, and I turned up my lip in disgust. Then there was another scene that annoyed me about a domestic dispute, but I heard females cheering during that part. For the life of me, I do not understand why females think it's funny for a man to be physically abused under ANY circumstances, but if a man does it, then it's wrong (and this is coming FROM a woman's perspective). That scene almost made me walk out of the theater because it's so hypocritical and shows just how adolescent a female can be and not know how to use her wits instead of her hands to solve an issue--situations like this separate technically grown females from grown women.There were some plot scenes that were a little overused, such as the mother's name, the mother cooking big meals, the couple going through marital issues, and the one son being chased by bookies. After awhile, I started thinking the plot to this movie was a blend of several other movies I've seen.  However, it's not like these plots are not common within African American households, so I shrugged and kept watching.Pros: Chris Brown. Flat out, he made this movie interesting for me. Whereas Columbus Short was the highlight of ""Stomp the Yard"" and Chris Brown fell to the sidelines, Chris Brown really showed out tremendously within this movie. I liked him as a singer before, but I LOVE him as a singer now.  He did a couple of songs within this film, and I've never heard his pipes be so on point. I was impressed and grinned big during every one of his scenes.  He's such a great artist no matter what he does: acting, dancing, singing, comedy (he isn't a comedian, but he's hilarious). Other than Chris Brown, there were some stellar actors in this movie like Idris Elba (even with his rough hairstyle); Delroy Lindo (who gets more handsome and charismatic in every single movie I see him in and always an excellent actor); Laz Alonso (who played a jerk to a tea--great job!); Regina King (love her acting generally but did NOT care for her character in this movie at all); Sharon Leal (who I'm seeing more and more--she's such a pretty woman and does a great acting job as well); Keith Robinson (the pantry scene was cute); Lauren London (pretty woman and improving in every single movie she's in, although I think my favorite will always be ""ATL""); Loretta Devine (who played a great mother, but I liked her spin with having a man and her own mind; her back story with her ex was a refreshing switch from the usual widow story); and David Banner trying out his acting chops.  All of the actors were cool in this film. The scene in Chicago looked way too warm for the wintertime.  I enjoyed the musical parts of the plot and all of the siblings got along. I also appreciated how they flipped the script on the white wife scene (although I won't go into that and ruin the plot).I enjoyed the film, but those cons are what gave this movie three stars.

Luckily audiences will find a special gift at their local multiplexes from Preston A. Whitmore, a filmmaker whose latest picture comes wrapped up with so much holiday mush that it would be hard for even the biggest scrooge to scowl at its spirited Christmas messageIt's the most wonderful time of the year again, and the Whitfield family plans to continue their holiday tradition of bringing the entire clan back home for a few days of presents, good eating and family squabbling. The only problem with This Christmas is that each of the children has brought more than just gifts. Absence without leave, surprise pregnancies, interracial relationships, cheating husbands and angry bookies are just a few of the surprises in store for the family's matriarch, Ma Dear, making it a Christmas that will either tear the Whitfield's apart or bring them closer than they've ever been before.With This Christmas, Preston A. Whitmore successfully bounced back from his sophomore slump. The choice to ""Crossover"" into the holiday genre is a big move, though looking at the filmmaker's oeuvre, he seemingly defies categorization. Written with heart, This Christmas isn't just impressive for its well balanced drama and comedy. Its ability to transcend its targeted audience to become a holiday film that can be enjoyed by anyone who has ever experienced family dysfunction makes the picture a refreshing surprise.With an all-star, African American cast including Delroy Lindo, Loretta Devine, Idris Elba and the lovely Sharon Leal, Screen Gems certainly seems to be pushing the racial factor when marketing This Christmas. While this strategy will probably draw in adequate box-office receipts (See Tyler Perry's success), This Christmas will draw the majority of its fans next Christmas when it finds a wider audience on DVD.Though many of the family's problems translate to touching and humorous bits of cinema, This Christmas ultimately suffers from one fatal flaw, too much conflict and no easy way out of it. There is so much going on, that the tidiest and most satisfying conclusion seems far too difficult to reach. It also seems that the character of Joe, played by Delroy Lindo, has the answers to everything. Able to pacify everyone from street thugs to the U.S. government in a single night, Joe gives Santa Claus a run for his money on this Christmas Eve.However plausibility isn't the strong suit of the Whitfield family. There are plenty of nit-picky details audiences will pick up on that could easily take them out of the narrative. While viewers might scoff at bits such as buying the picture-perfect Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, the performances from the actors, tight editing and gorgeous cinematography will help get you through This Christmas.If filmmakers should write what they know, then Preston A. Whitmore certainly knows Christmas and family far better than war or basketball. A solid holiday outing sure to please any audiences that comes across the film, Whitmore's well executed dramady should resonate far longer than This Christmas.-Joe Russo",3,This Christmas Movie Review,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,3152,"['Christmas', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'pass', 'cinematic', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'Luckily', 'audiences', 'will', 'find', 'special', 'gift', 'local', 'multiplexes', 'Preston', 'A.', 'Whitmore', 'filmmaker', 'latest', 'picture', 'wrapped', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'holiday', 'mush', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'even', 'biggest', 'scrooge', 'scowl', 'spirited', 'Christmas', 'messageIt', 'most', 'wonderful', 'time', 'year', 'again', 'Whitfield', 'family', 'plans', 'continue', 'holiday', 'tradition', 'bringing', 'entire', 'clan', 'back', 'home', 'few', 'days', 'presents', 'good', 'eating', 'family', 'squabbling', 'only', 'problem', 'Christmas', 'children', 'brought', 'more', 'just', 'gifts', 'Absence', 'leave', 'surprise', 'pregnancies', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'cheating', 'husbands', 'angry', 'bookies', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'surprises', 'store', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Ma', 'Dear', 'making', 'Christmas', 'will', 'either', 'tear', 'Whitfield', 'apart', 'bring', 'closer', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'before.With', 'Christmas', 'Preston', 'A.', 'Whitmore', 'successfully', 'bounced', 'back', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'choice', 'Crossover', 'holiday', 'genre', 'big', 'move', 'looking', 'filmmaker', 'oeuvre', 'seemingly', 'categorization', 'Written', 'heart', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'just', 'impressive', 'well', 'balanced', 'drama', 'comedy', 'ability', 'transcend', 'targeted', 'audience', 'become', 'holiday', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'experienced', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'picture', 'refreshing', 'surprise.With', 'all-star', 'African', 'American', 'cast', 'including', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'lovely', 'Sharon', 'Leal', 'Screen', 'Gems', 'certainly', 'be', 'pushing', 'racial', 'factor', 'when', 'marketing', 'Christmas', 'strategy', 'will', 'probably', 'draw', 'adequate', 'box-office', 'receipts', 'See', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'success', 'Christmas', 'will', 'draw', 'majority', 'fans', 'Christmas', 'when', 'wider', 'audience', 'DVD.Though', 'many', 'family', 'problems', 'translate', 'touching', 'humorous', 'bits', 'cinema', 'Christmas', 'ultimately', 'one', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'too', 'much', 'conflict', 'easy', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'tidiest', 'most', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'far', 'too', 'difficult', 'reach', 'also', 'character', 'Joe', 'played', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'answers', 'everything', 'Able', 'pacify', 'everyone', 'street', 'thugs', 'U.S.', 'government', 'single', 'night', 'Joe', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'run', 'money', 'Christmas', 'Eve.However', 'plausibility', ""n't"", 'strong', 'suit', 'Whitfield', 'family', 'are', 'plenty', 'nit-picky', 'details', 'audiences', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'could', 'easily', 'take', 'narrative', 'viewers', 'might', 'scoff', 'bits', 'such', 'buying', 'picture-perfect', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'performances', 'actors', 'tight', 'editing', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'will', 'help', 'get', 'Christmas.If', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'write', 'what', 'know', 'then', 'Preston', 'A.', 'Whitmore', 'certainly', 'Christmas', 'family', 'far', 'better', 'war', 'basketball', 'solid', 'holiday', 'outing', 'sure', 'please', 'audiences', 'film', 'Whitmore', 'well', 'executed', 'dramady', 'should', 'resonate', 'far', 'longer', 'Christmas.-Joe', 'Russo']",This Christmas

The major, universal family issues were all accounted for, with some delicious new surprises to boot! I was hugely entertained from start to finish! Even the &#34;overrated&#34; traditional &#34;Black movie&#34; Soul Train ending, was a joy! I had fun. I was moved to tears, I wanted that fight between the sisters, I needed the &#34;Make Up&#34; scene between them. God knows, I was living to see the eldest son give Joe his props and blessings, that Madea and Joe could Love &#34;Out Loud&#34;.
