Barry ""THE reviewer""","[2, 3]","A movie like this only comes around once in a lifetime, and I don't necessarily mean that in a strictly negative tone, or for that matter a positive one. There's only one way to describe a movie like The Garbage Pail Kids movie, and that way is with ""bizarre"" or one of its many synonyms.It's absolutely astonishing that a movie studio would fund, produce, and widely distribute this picture to theatres. The script is, in a word, abysmal. Dozens of obvious questions are raised at the outset; Why does Dodger(our hero) virtually live at Manzini's Antique Shop? How has said shop stayed in business having not sold a single item in months? Why does a twentysomething looking goon continue spend his life picking on a 14 year old wimp? All of these questions are quickly relegated to the back-burner when one sets eyes on the Garbage Pail Kids for the first time. Aside from most of the kids being hideous(Nat Nerd and Valerie Vomit in particular), the puppetry is atrocious. Dialogue is rarely lip synced, and when it is the mouth movements are incredibly stiff. Amazingly, poor quality of the costumes is paled only by the stupidity of the film's plot,revolving around Dodger's efforts to woo Tangerine away from ""Juice"", the same goon who keeps chasing Dodger around and stealing his lunch money. Fortunately for Dodger, the titular Garbage Pail Kids are apparently endowed by their Creator with unsurpassed fashion design skills, the very same skills Tangerine is trying to use to hit the big time and move to New York! The kids put their abilities to work and sew Dodger a hideous jacket to impress Tangerine, and before you know it we've got a love triangle of such depth not seen since...ever. Or not.Laughably bad performances abound, although even McKenzie Astin as Dodger delivers an Oscar-worthy performance in contrast to Ron MacLachlan as Juice, who delivers unequivocally the worst performance I have ever seen in a non-pornographic motion picture.All of this is overshadowed by the scenes of the Garbage Pail Kids general tomfoolery, which includes such wacky hijinks as stealing a Pepsi truck, breaking into a sweat shop while singing ""We Can Do Anything by Working With Each Other!"", roasting hot dogs over an open fire, causing mayhem in a movie theatre, and most incredibly, participating in a biker bar brawl, kicked off by driving an ATV straight through the window. I am not being hyperbolic in the least when I describe each and every one of these scenes as a unique spectacle in the history of cinema. I cannot imagine there will ever be a film made with a more innately ""weird"" quality than this one. If you have any curiosity whatsoever about this film, I recommend you see it. There truly isn't and most likely never will be another experience in cinema quite like watching The Garbage Pail Kids Movie.",5,Once-in-a-lifetime film experience,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,2828,"['movie', 'only', 'around', 'once', 'lifetime', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'strictly', 'negative', 'tone', 'matter', 'positive', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'describe', 'movie', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'movie', 'way', 'bizarre', 'one', 'many', 'synonyms.It', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'movie', 'studio', 'would', 'fund', 'produce', 'widely', 'distribute', 'picture', 'theatres', 'script', 'word', 'abysmal', 'Dozens', 'obvious', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'outset', 'Why', 'Dodger', 'hero', 'virtually', 'live', 'Manzini', 'Antique', 'Shop', 'How', 'said', 'shop', 'stayed', 'business', 'having', 'not', 'sold', 'single', 'item', 'months', 'Why', 'twentysomething', 'looking', 'goon', 'continue', 'spend', 'life', 'picking', '14', 'year', 'old', 'wimp', 'questions', 'are', 'quickly', 'relegated', 'back-burner', 'when', 'one', 'eyes', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'first', 'time', 'Aside', 'most', 'kids', 'being', 'hideous', 'Nat', 'Nerd', 'Valerie', 'Vomit', 'particular', 'puppetry', 'atrocious', 'Dialogue', 'rarely', 'lip', 'synced', 'when', 'mouth', 'movements', 'are', 'incredibly', 'stiff', 'Amazingly', 'poor', 'quality', 'costumes', 'paled', 'only', 'stupidity', 'film', 'plot', 'revolving', 'Dodger', 'efforts', 'woo', 'Tangerine', 'away', 'Juice', 'same', 'goon', 'who', 'chasing', 'Dodger', 'stealing', 'lunch', 'money', 'Fortunately', 'Dodger', 'titular', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'are', 'apparently', 'endowed', 'Creator', 'unsurpassed', 'fashion', 'design', 'skills', 'very', 'same', 'skills', 'Tangerine', 'trying', 'use', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'kids', 'put', 'abilities', 'work', 'sew', 'Dodger', 'hideous', 'jacket', 'impress', 'Tangerine', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'love', 'triangle', 'such', 'depth', 'not', 'seen', 'ever', 'not.Laughably', 'bad', 'performances', 'abound', 'even', 'McKenzie', 'Astin', 'Dodger', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'contrast', 'Ron', 'MacLachlan', 'Juice', 'who', 'unequivocally', 'worst', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'non-pornographic', 'motion', 'picture.All', 'overshadowed', 'scenes', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'general', 'tomfoolery', 'such', 'wacky', 'hijinks', 'stealing', 'Pepsi', 'truck', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'shop', 'singing', 'Can', 'Do', 'Anything', 'Working', 'Other', 'roasting', 'hot', 'dogs', 'open', 'fire', 'causing', 'mayhem', 'movie', 'theatre', 'most', 'incredibly', 'participating', 'biker', 'bar', 'brawl', 'kicked', 'off', 'driving', 'ATV', 'straight', 'window', 'am', 'not', 'being', 'hyperbolic', 'least', 'when', 'describe', 'one', 'scenes', 'unique', 'spectacle', 'history', 'cinema', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'there', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'film', 'made', 'more', 'innately', 'weird', 'quality', 'one', 'have', 'curiosity', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'recommend', 'see', 'truly', ""n't"", 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'experience', 'cinema', 'quite', 'watching', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'Movie']",N/A

248337,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,6301254945,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 2]","Something like ""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"" makes it fruitless to complain for obvious reasons.  If the name sounds like crap, and the film looks like crap, then it is, by definition, crap. But do I deserve to criticize the movie so foully when its identity is being foul? That's like complaining about a gnome for being short, Satan for being evil, or Robin Williams for being hyperactive. But does that mean I should give a pass and not bother getting bent over shape by its putridness? Not exactly.I like to recall a movie that not many have seen. It's calledFreaked, which is about freaks, and its impetus is to freak people out. However, that isn't all there is with that film, as it had hysterical jokes that are outside its shock value. The freaks are unique with compelling personalities about them, some have a good sense of wit, and few even have unpredictably funny backstories; plus, it has Keanu Reeves as a werewolf. It's a good cult classic, very enjoyable, and people should give this movie a chance. But shameless recommendation aside, the point is you can look like a duck and talk like a duck, but that doesn't necessarily mean you should act like a duck; in this movie, all the ugly ducklings did is keep quacking in hopes of being swans.The film's about Dodger, your typical bullied wuss, who works at an antiqued store owned by Cpt. Manzini, a magician of endless proverbs...and hardly did any magic besides magically turning on a laundry machine. Manzini warned Dodger about not opening what he called 'Pandora's Pail', but the bullies taught him a lesson for being a protagonist and accidentally knocked the magical pail down, letting loose the abortions from the Cabbage Patch nursery. And my gosh, the design on those Kids look horrible, and their badly-functioned mouths make their lip-synching worse than a '80s anime dub.  Here's the Garbage Gang: there's Greaser, the '50s punk with the voice ofTigger; Valerie, who regurgitates; Phil, the smelly one; Tessie, the snot-nosed girl; Windy, the flatulence master; Nat Nerd, the 'whiz' kid; and Ali Gator, the foot fetishist...or foot eater, whichever. Together, when they're not helping Dodger with his problems and finding their other friends in trash bins, they tried to see who can outgross the other (that's the premise of the movie).Probably because I've seenan even grosser movie, it doesn't have a lot of 'eww' value as I thought. Valerie only vomited once, Windy's farts are colorless, Nat pees himself but everyone avoided it, and I don't even know what's so ugly about Phil. Matter of fact, if one could pinpoint the ugliest character of the movie, I say it'd be Dodger. He didsn't seem to care about going back to his real family, he exploited the talents of the Garbage Gang for his selfish gain, and he creepily stalked a way-older-than-him, gaudy fashion-designer named Tangerine; seriously, her clothes and fashion sense are even uglier than Nat Nerd. The Garbage Gang were at least selfless enough to make clothes for Dodger and nurse him when he's injured, and he decided to take advantage of their kindness? He's no better than Juice and his gang, the antagonists of the film, and albeit wooden and hilariously corny they were, they knew they're bullies.I'm surprised I didn't hate ""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"" as much I as anticipated.  It does have a few charms to make it cult worthy (bad 80s quality, corny acting, campy songs worth gleeing), but I thought this is a lesser film.  Not because of its ugliness, but because of how small and aimless it is.  Probably due to budgetary reasons, but there's not much in the film to expand (locations, origins, etc.), and it can be very uneventual; much of the film's time is on the Gang fooling around for no reason, or fooling their way into a flag for a convenient future solution (the bikers from 'The Toughest Bar In The World').

There are novels, plays, true stories, comic-books, video games and...trading cards? The woefully mis-handled Mars Attacks was based on a brilliant trading card series and it was hardly high art. A lower-lever trading card such as the Garbage Pail Kids is hardly likely to make great cinema. If this sort of thing cannot appeal to you (I have broad tastes and I'm a bit too understanding of flawed films) then don't even bother watching.I wanted to rent this movie when I was a kid but my grandmother (who always evaluated the videos first) thought it looked quite inappropriate (I subsequently went for Rambo: First Blood Part II, which she thought was more fitting for a 7-year-old). Since it's one and only incarnation on video tape in the late-80s (theatrical prints promptly vanished) this film has been totally non-existant. Luckily (if you like this sort of thing) MGM bought the rights, found a dusty print and spruced it up to give us a brand new digital incarnation of The Garbage Pail Kids Movie. With erm...garbage like this getting a DVD release I must ask where the hell is Bigfoot and Howard the Duck?Direcor Rodney Amateau (a rather fitting-sounding surname) could have made this an animated movie (eg Care Bears) but no, he actually had the audacity and nerve to attempt it in live action. Note how I said 'attempt' and not 'succeed'.The animatronics are just horrible. Where is Jim Henson when you need him? So bad is the puppetry that the kids cannot even close their mouths and no one even bothered to lip-sync the dialogue. They are also disgusting beyond reason (as one who is familiar with the trading cards would expect). But after while they tend to grow on you (like an ulcer) and if you switch your brain off you might find that the film is alright.There's nothing magical here. Even for a film packed with horrendously 80s fashion and production design there isn't even much nostalgic appeal. The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is certainly nothing like The Dark Crystal or even Ewoks: Caravan of Courage. Hell, it's even many leagues beneath Masters of the Universe. But, if curiousity takes control of you and you simply MUST own the film then go ahead. Just remember what I said about switching your brain off.The DVD is in not bad-looking 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (considering most prints were probably left abandoned in an old mine somewhere) with Dolby Mono sound.

Dodger (Mackenzie Astin) is a 12 year old orphan who lives with Mancini and after school he works there as his assistant as he falls in love with a lovely fashion designer named Tangerine (Katie Barberie) who is a sight for sore-eyes. However in the weird junk store there is a strange yet magical garbage pail that originally came from outer space years ago and Mancini has kept it secure so that no one could ever open it. But one day Tangerine's tough boyfriend named Juice (Ron MacLachen) with his gang beats up Dodger in the store they accident make the pail fall unleashing a gang of weird looking kids. Their names are Valerie Vomit, Greaser Greg, Ali Gator, Nat Nerd, Messie Tessie, Foul Phil, and Windy Winston as they are gross and disgusting alien-esque kids from some other world as they want to change the life of the poor sap and get him to like the girl that he desires.Based on the popular 80's trading card phenomenon, this live-action attempt to bring the cards to life isn't really as bad as some people say. First off the cards back in 1985 made TOPPS Trading Cards a smash company as the leading makers of trading cards, back then the Cabbage Patch Kids were very popular yet the Topps company thought up an idea to make a trading card series that spoofs and satirizes those dolls in various ways including nausating and violent ways called ""The Garbage Pail Kids"". The cards were a runaway success with many children even though some parents and teachers weren't too happy about the cards's images but some knew boys loved disgusting things and spawned merchandise of all sorts, then in 1986 Atlantic Pictures got the rights for a feature length movie based on the cards. Written and directed by Rod Amateau who did some episodes of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" didn't do too bad to make the franchise into a movie even though it was made on a low budget with some cheap laytex masks that hardly move on the midget actors that play the title heroes.

248358,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6301254945,Robert I. Hedges,"[5, 5]","""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"" is absolutely breathtaking in its badness. Spawned in the 1980's, this spinoff of the series could have (and should have) been done with animation, but was instead made with horrifyingly creepy animatronics and suits. To say that these suits are bad is an understatement (several can't even close their mouths), but with character names like Messy Tessie. Foul Phil, Valerie Vomit, and Ali Gator, what are you expecting? I was expecting some camp value from this, the most revolting kid's movie of the 1980's (or any decade, for that matter,) but was grossly (you'll pardon the pun) disappointed. Perhaps I am being too hard on this movie, as I don't have any emotional links to it from childhood, but I sometimes find that entertainment comes in the most unusual of places. Charitably, I gave the film two stars, mostly for the audacity to actually make this thing, with bonus points for getting a famous British actor, the late Anthony Newley, to play the role of Captain Manzini. He must have really needed the money.The plot concerns Mackenzie Astin as Dodger, a waif who pretty much lives in Manzini's antiques store. He inadvertently releases the Garbage Pail Kids onto the world and into the midst of the worst-conceived love story to ever find its way to the big screen. Tangerine is Juice's kept woman. They are both about ten years older than Dodger, so I am unsure why either party would be interested in the other. Nonetheless, Dodger has a crush on Tangerine, and it's obvious why: she treats him badly, turns him over to Juice for regular beatings, is a total user, has terrible frizzy hair, and wears the worst clothes in history. That's a bit of an issue as she is aiming to become a famous designer. Dodger quickly enlists the Garbage Pail Kids as slave labor to make clothes for her to sell out of her car at a dance club. I would not have expected a movie featuring the Garbage Pail Kids to have a fashion subplot. At any rate, through a series of events which include lots of flatus, vomiting, and incontinence, a theft of a Pepsi Truck (How much did Pepsi pay for this product placement?), a disastrous fashion show, and a little incarceration in the ""State Home For The Ugly"" (which looks as menacing as a middle school,) the kids show Dodger the true meaning of friendship, and all is well in the universe. I was a bit surprised that Tangerine was nasty till the end, but that ended up being a lesson for Dodger on the frailty of physical beauty. (I guess.)The film is much less entertaining from a camp perspective (or any perspective) than I expected, and much grosser. You know it's a bad movie when the kids go to a theatre and see a Three Stooges movie (which they find hilarious, naturally,) and are immediately upstaged by it. They show quite a bit of the Stooges movie (I don't know which one, and it doesn't matter anyway): this should be a lesson to never show a better movie inside your own movie. The film also has a number of other low points: it contains the worst bar fight, the worst star-crossed lovers, the worst alligator with a foot fetish, and the worst TV repair scene (think ""mucus"") in film history. Bonus features include terrible music with amazingly bad lyrics, and some Ed Wood day versus night confusion.While this will appeal to some preadolescent children, I think most will agree with Captain Manzini that Pandora's Garbage Can should have been kept closed.",2,"""A Topps Chewing Gum Production.""",1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,3442,"['Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'Movie', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'badness', 'Spawned', '1980', 'spinoff', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'animation', 'was', 'instead', 'made', 'horrifyingly', 'creepy', 'animatronics', 'suits', 'say', 'suits', 'are', 'bad', 'understatement', 'several', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'mouths', 'character', 'names', 'Messy', 'Tessie', 'Foul', 'Phil', 'Valerie', 'Vomit', 'Ali', 'Gator', 'what', 'are', 'expecting', 'was', 'expecting', 'camp', 'value', 'most', 'revolting', 'kid', 'movie', '1980', 'decade', 'matter', 'was', 'grossly', ""'ll"", 'pardon', 'pun', 'disappointed', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'links', 'childhood', 'sometimes', 'find', 'entertainment', 'most', 'unusual', 'places', 'Charitably', 'gave', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'mostly', 'audacity', 'actually', 'make', 'thing', 'bonus', 'points', 'getting', 'famous', 'British', 'actor', 'late', 'Anthony', 'Newley', 'play', 'role', 'Captain', 'Manzini', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'needed', 'money.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Mackenzie', 'Astin', 'Dodger', 'waif', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'lives', 'Manzini', 'antiques', 'store', 'inadvertently', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'world', 'midst', 'worst-conceived', 'love', 'story', 'ever', 'find', 'way', 'big', 'screen', 'Tangerine', 'Juice', 'kept', 'woman', 'are', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'Dodger', 'am', 'unsure', 'why', 'party', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'other', 'Nonetheless', 'Dodger', 'crush', 'Tangerine', 'obvious', 'why', 'badly', 'Juice', 'regular', 'beatings', 'total', 'user', 'terrible', 'frizzy', 'hair', 'worst', 'clothes', 'history', 'bit', 'issue', 'aiming', 'become', 'famous', 'designer', 'Dodger', 'quickly', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'slave', 'labor', 'make', 'clothes', 'sell', 'car', 'dance', 'club', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'expected', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Garbage', 'Pail', 'Kids', 'have', 'fashion', 'subplot', 'rate', 'series', 'events', 'include', 'lots', 'flatus', 'vomiting', 'incontinence', 'theft', 'Pepsi', 'Truck', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'Pepsi', 'pay', 'product', 'placement', 'disastrous', 'fashion', 'show', 'little', 'incarceration', 'State', 'Home', 'Ugly', 'as', 'menacing', 'middle', 'school', 'kids', 'show', 'Dodger', 'true', 'meaning', 'friendship', 'well', 'universe', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'Tangerine', 'was', 'nasty', 'end', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'lesson', 'Dodger', 'frailty', 'physical', 'beauty', 'guess', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'entertaining', 'camp', 'perspective', 'perspective', 'expected', 'much', 'grosser', 'know', 'bad', 'movie', 'when', 'kids', 'go', 'theatre', 'see', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'movie', 'find', 'hilarious', 'naturally', 'are', 'immediately', 'upstaged', 'show', 'quite', 'bit', 'Stooges', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anyway', 'should', 'be', 'lesson', 'never', 'show', 'better', 'movie', 'own', 'movie', 'film', 'also', 'number', 'other', 'low', 'points', 'worst', 'bar', 'fight', 'worst', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'worst', 'alligator', 'foot', 'fetish', 'worst', 'TV', 'repair', 'scene', 'think', 'mucus', 'film', 'history', 'Bonus', 'include', 'terrible', 'music', 'amazingly', 'bad', 'lyrics', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'day', 'versus', 'night', 'confusion.While', 'will', 'appeal', 'preadolescent', 'children', 'think', 'most', 'will', 'agree', 'Captain', 'Manzini', 'Pandora', 'Garbage', 'Can', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'closed']",N/A

Not gourmet, because that would imply one can make qualified distinctions between bad films. All I can really use is my ""film badness"" theory: there's Good Bad (a film so bad it's good), Mediocre Bad (a film that tried to be something better and failed) and Bad Bad (a film that is so bad that it's really not enjoyable to watch even to mock).""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"" falls somewhere between Bad Bad and Good Bad, and much closer to Bad Bad. I strongly caution that unless you plan watching this travesty in segments, this film will wear you down and make you question the nature of existence over a bottle of Wild Turkey. A side effect of watching this is ""Howard the Duck"" suddenly looks like ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" by comparison. Try it, you'll see. You may even write an apology letter to George Lucas, though it's better you don't.The main flaw with this film (if one can be picked from the many, many flaws available) is the Garbage Pail Kids themselves. For those of you old enough to remember, they were a popular (?) trading card set in the Time Before Pokemon that were a crass parody of Cabbage Patch Kids, which were a kind of bloated doll of some sort. So, keeping with the theme of the cards (hey kids, don't you like gross things?!?), our six Pail Kids are The Guy Who Farts, The Girl Who Vomits, The Guy Who is Killer Croc as a Kid, The Guy Who is a Baby, and The Guy With Explosive Acne Who Wets Himself Constantly. I may be forgetting a Kid, but there's your main cast. They are awkwardly played by little people, have no charm whatsoever and all have COMPLETELY DEAD EYES sunk deep in their gruesome animatronic heads. Try not to look into their eyes, you may never forget the soulless horror that lurks beneath.The second major flaw that destroys this film is that the story (such as it is) is abjectly terrible. In a nutshell: There's a wizard (the David Copperfield kind, not the Harry Potter kind) who has a mysterious pail full of The Kids. His hapless assistant knocks the can over, the Kids escape and cause harmless mischief (and fart a lot), the hapless assistant falls in love with a teenage ice queen who's into fashion, the Kids tailor some clothes, the Kids get put in an inexplicable prison, they Kids get saved by the wizard and his hapless assistant, there's a fashion show the Kids crash and the ice queen learns a valuable lesson about being nice to people. The pacing is grinding, there's no conflict, and...what am I saying, this film is Bad Bad, you know, hard to watch. I feel that the director was going for comedy, but there isn't a single funny moment, gag or line in the entire affair, unless you split your sides over fart jokes.
