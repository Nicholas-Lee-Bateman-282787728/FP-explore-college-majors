Why can't Hollywood stick to the facts, especially when true events are more interesting and translatable to the screen? Why?1 star for making a mostly fictional movie. 3 stars for music and performances.I wish a real artist of a director had brought to the screen this important history and done so with a much better script that stuck to the well known historical facts. This is an okay film about an epic, original, only-in-America story that deserved nothing short of first-rate film treatment. ""Cadillac Records"" does have a fantastic cast. The actor playing Howlin' Wolf is great for example, but the script paints a slightly embarrassing and arguably one-dimensional portrait of the man while focusing almost entirely on Muddy Waters, played by the talented Jeffrey Wright. But Wright doesn't look or talk like Muddy. Adrien Brody plays Leonard Chess (looks nothing whatsoever like him) while the film entirely omits the existence of the other brother and partner with whom he made music history! The film does succeed in capturing the typical rip-off deals owners made with their musicians back in the day and hence the title of the film. Chess Records is named ""Cadillac Records"" here because the brothers Chess preferred paying their musicians with a nice, shinny Cadillac over money. I do like how the more rural, seemingly less sophisticated Howlin Wolf turns down the car, preferring the money he is owed. Howlin Wolf deserved a bigger portrayal in this film. Includes Mos Def in an entertaining turn as Chuck Berry and in one of the films more cinematic moments there is a black and white mug shot of Chuck Berry juxtaposed with color footage of happy, white surf boarders on either side of it while ""Surfin' USA"" is playing: The Beach Boys took the melody from a Berry song (""Sweet Little Sixteen""). ""Cadillac Records"" does a good job portraying the racial discrimination and societal changes these performers endured. The lovely Beyonce Knowles ably plays Etta James and she is nice to look at, but the portrayal of James in the film is misleading. She already had a career before hooking up with Chess and speaking of hooking up, it isn't clear she did with Leonard. And Leonard doesn't die while driving away from the studio after selling it.All in all, a paint by numbers level quality here, loose with the facts and liberal with so-called ""artistic license"" film that's perhaps a slight step above television production due to a talented cast. It's maybe worth a look, especially if you enjoy Hollywood treatments of music history. But in my opinion music history is seldom done justice by Hollywood and it wasn't with this film.",3,Hollwood treatment.,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,2662,"['Thumbs', 'down', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'stick', 'facts', 'especially', 'when', 'true', 'events', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'translatable', 'screen', 'Why', '1', 'star', 'making', 'mostly', 'fictional', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'music', 'performances.I', 'wish', 'real', 'artist', 'director', 'had', 'brought', 'screen', 'important', 'history', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'script', 'stuck', 'well', 'known', 'historical', 'facts', 'okay', 'film', 'epic', 'original', 'only-in-America', 'story', 'deserved', 'nothing', 'short', 'first-rate', 'film', 'treatment', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'have', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'actor', 'playing', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'great', 'example', 'script', 'slightly', 'embarrassing', 'arguably', 'one-dimensional', 'portrait', 'man', 'focusing', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'played', 'talented', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Wright', ""n't"", 'look', 'talk', 'Muddy', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'entirely', 'existence', 'other', 'brother', 'partner', 'whom', 'made', 'music', 'history', 'film', 'succeed', 'capturing', 'typical', 'rip-off', 'deals', 'owners', 'made', 'musicians', 'back', 'day', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'Chess', 'Records', 'named', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'here', 'brothers', 'Chess', 'preferred', 'paying', 'musicians', 'nice', 'shinny', 'Cadillac', 'money', 'do', 'how', 'more', 'rural', 'seemingly', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'down', 'car', 'preferring', 'money', 'owed', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'deserved', 'bigger', 'portrayal', 'film', 'Mos', 'Def', 'entertaining', 'turn', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'one', 'films', 'more', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'black', 'white', 'mug', 'shot', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'juxtaposed', 'color', 'footage', 'happy', 'white', 'surf', 'boarders', 'side', 'Surfin', 'USA', 'playing', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'took', 'melody', 'Berry', 'song', 'Sweet', 'Little', 'Sixteen', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'societal', 'changes', 'performers', 'endured', 'lovely', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'ably', 'Etta', 'James', 'nice', 'look', 'portrayal', 'James', 'film', 'misleading', 'already', 'had', 'career', 'hooking', 'up', 'Chess', 'speaking', 'hooking', 'up', ""n't"", 'clear', 'did', 'Leonard', 'Leonard', ""n't"", 'die', 'driving', 'away', 'studio', 'selling', 'it.All', 'paint', 'numbers', 'level', 'quality', 'here', 'loose', 'facts', 'liberal', 'so-called', 'artistic', 'license', 'film', 'perhaps', 'slight', 'step', 'television', 'production', 'due', 'talented', 'cast', 'maybe', 'worth', 'look', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'Hollywood', 'treatments', 'music', 'history', 'opinion', 'music', 'history', 'seldom', 'done', 'justice', 'Hollywood', 'was', ""n't"", 'film']",N/A
1225565,AGEIT17HENDIS,B001P3SA8U,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","It seems almost anti-climatic to be reviewing this particular film, Cadillac Records, about the rise of Chess Records and its driving force, owner Leonard Chess, in the maelstrom of the Chicago blues explosion of the 1940's and 1950's. Why?  Over the past year or so, along with the usual left wing political books by the likes of Leon Trotsky and James P. Cannon that are the core items that I review in this space, I have been fervently doing a personal search for, and reflection on, the roots of American music. And nothing is more central to an exploration of the American songbook than the various expressions of the blues from its roots in the black quarters of plantation society down South, through to the immense process of black urbanization in the mid-20th century and with it the electrification of the blues and further on the use of that genre to form the basis for Rock `n' Roll that was central to much of the musical history of the last half of that century.Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Jimmy Reed, Howin'Wolf, Chuck Berry and the divine Ms.  Etta James are all names that should be familiar to knowledgeable blues fan and whose fame and fortune, rises and falls form the core of this film. They are also names prominent among those that have been reviewed in this space so this is a real treat. The Chess Record saga is narrated by the actor who plays the producer, ""talent hunter"", songwriter and musician Willie Dixon, a huge force in the expansion of Chess Records and Chicago blues in general. And this is as it should be. Willie Dixon wrote for both Muddy Waters (the classic ""Hoochie Coochie Man"", among others) and Howlin' Wolf (the most famous being ""The Red Rooster"", a song later covered by The Rolling Stones, enthusiastic blues aficionados, and one of my first exposures to the raw electric blues sound. Thanks, Willie). He was also at Chess when the music shifted away from the Chicago blues to the `jump' of rock `n' roll driven by the likes of Chuck Berry who could ""crossover"" to all those white teenagers like me trying to break out of the music of our parents' generation. He was also there when Ms.  Etta James came on the scene with her R&B; style that also was an attempt to do that same crossover with a black woman singer.According to the notes to this film it is based on a true story, that of Leonard Chess and the blues stars mentioned above. How much truth there actually is included in the script is beyond the scope of this review.  I would note that one of the segments of Martin Scorsese's PBS multi-part Blues homage in 2003 dealt with the role of Chess Records as part of the total blues picture and featured Leonard Chess's son, Marshall, a record producer in his own right. Some of his comments do not exactly jibe with the presentation of the facts in this film. That is a subject for further research and discovery.Some important themes, nevertheless, are explored in the film, even if obliquely. The relationship between a young hustling Jew (and his brother, not noted in the film) from Poland trying to make a buck in America and young blacks trying to get out from under the rural ""Jim Crow"" South in mid-20th century America. The question of interracial sex, both male and female when that was very, very taboo. Martial infidelity, a constant problem in the music industry (and elsewhere). Exploitation of blacks, both financially and musically, by the white-dominated music power structure, including Leonard Chess. The touchy question of black identity and self-respect, addressed very nicely in the tensions between Muddy, as a representative ""Uncle Tom"", and Howlin' Wolf (or Chuck Berry), as the ""New Black Man"", coming out of new black consciousness of the civil rights struggle blazing away during that period. Addressing those issues should keep us busy for a while.Let's finish up with a few kudos, though. A musical tribute to a record company and a famous record producer could have been a piece of fluff. While, as noted above, the film raised a number of questions about what really went on back then the heart of the movie is driven by the blues and the need to express oneself in that genre, whether as a job or a way of life. The performers carried the day. The camaraderie and falling out between Muddy and Little Walter is worked nicely. The struggle's of Etta James (Beyonce is rather fetching here, by the way, as Etta) to break through as an artist works.  And so on.The Cadillac automobile formed a symbol for Americans, black and white, back in these days. The artists presented here deserved their Cadillacs. More enduring though, as noted at the end of the film, all the main players here have been inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. I challenge anyone to argue against those inclusions. Watch this film and then get on the Internet and download the music. Yes, that's the ticket.",4,In The Prime Of The Chicago Blues Explosion,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,4877,"['almost', 'anti-climatic', 'be', 'reviewing', 'particular', 'film', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'rise', 'Chess', 'Records', 'driving', 'force', 'owner', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'maelstrom', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'explosion', '1940', '1950', 'Why', 'past', 'year', 'so', 'usual', 'left', 'wing', 'political', 'books', 'likes', 'Leon', 'Trotsky', 'James', 'P.', 'Cannon', 'are', 'core', 'items', 'review', 'space', 'have', 'been', 'fervently', 'doing', 'personal', 'search', 'reflection', 'roots', 'American', 'music', 'nothing', 'more', 'central', 'exploration', 'American', 'songbook', 'various', 'expressions', 'blues', 'roots', 'black', 'quarters', 'plantation', 'society', 'South', 'immense', 'process', 'black', 'urbanization', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'electrification', 'blues', 'further', 'use', 'genre', 'form', 'basis', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'was', 'central', 'much', 'musical', 'history', 'last', 'half', 'century.Muddy', 'Waters', 'Little', 'Walter', 'Jimmy', 'Reed', ""Howin'Wolf"", 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'divine', 'Ms.', 'Etta', 'James', 'are', 'names', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'knowledgeable', 'blues', 'fan', 'fame', 'fortune', 'rises', 'form', 'core', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'names', 'prominent', 'have', 'been', 'reviewed', 'space', 'so', 'real', 'treat', 'Chess', 'Record', 'saga', 'narrated', 'actor', 'who', 'producer', 'talent', 'hunter', 'songwriter', 'musician', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'huge', 'force', 'expansion', 'Chess', 'Records', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'general', 'should', 'be', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'wrote', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'classic', 'Hoochie', 'Coochie', 'Man', 'others', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'most', 'famous', 'being', 'Red', 'Rooster', 'song', 'later', 'covered', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'enthusiastic', 'blues', 'aficionados', 'one', 'first', 'exposures', 'raw', 'electric', 'blues', 'sound', 'Thanks', 'Willie', 'was', 'also', 'Chess', 'when', 'music', 'shifted', 'away', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'jump', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'driven', 'likes', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'who', 'could', 'crossover', 'white', 'teenagers', 'trying', 'break', 'music', 'parents', 'generation', 'was', 'also', 'there', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Etta', 'James', 'came', 'scene', 'R', 'B', 'style', 'also', 'was', 'attempt', 'do', 'same', 'crossover', 'black', 'woman', 'singer.According', 'notes', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'blues', 'stars', 'mentioned', 'above', 'How', 'much', 'truth', 'actually', 'included', 'script', 'scope', 'review', 'would', 'note', 'one', 'segments', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'PBS', 'multi-part', 'Blues', 'homage', '2003', 'dealt', 'role', 'Chess', 'Records', 'part', 'total', 'blues', 'picture', 'featured', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'son', 'Marshall', 'record', 'producer', 'own', 'right', 'comments', 'do', 'not', 'exactly', 'presentation', 'facts', 'film', 'subject', 'further', 'research', 'discovery.Some', 'important', 'themes', 'nevertheless', 'are', 'explored', 'film', 'even', 'obliquely', 'relationship', 'young', 'hustling', 'Jew', 'brother', 'not', 'noted', 'film', 'Poland', 'trying', 'make', 'buck', 'America', 'young', 'blacks', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'rural', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'America', 'question', 'interracial', 'sex', 'male', 'female', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'taboo', 'Martial', 'infidelity', 'constant', 'problem', 'music', 'industry', 'elsewhere', 'Exploitation', 'blacks', 'financially', 'musically', 'white-dominated', 'music', 'power', 'structure', 'including', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'touchy', 'question', 'black', 'identity', 'self-respect', 'addressed', 'very', 'nicely', 'tensions', 'Muddy', 'representative', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'New', 'Black', 'Man', 'coming', 'new', 'black', 'consciousness', 'civil', 'rights', 'struggle', 'blazing', 'away', 'period', 'Addressing', 'issues', 'should', 'keep', 'busy', 'while.Let', 'finish', 'up', 'few', 'kudos', 'though', 'musical', 'tribute', 'record', 'company', 'famous', 'record', 'producer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'piece', 'fluff', 'noted', 'film', 'raised', 'number', 'questions', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'back', 'then', 'heart', 'movie', 'driven', 'blues', 'need', 'express', 'genre', 'job', 'way', 'life', 'performers', 'carried', 'day', 'camaraderie', 'falling', 'out', 'Muddy', 'Little', 'Walter', 'worked', 'nicely', 'struggle', 'Etta', 'James', 'Beyonce', 'rather', 'fetching', 'here', 'way', 'Etta', 'break', 'through', 'artist', 'works', 'so', 'on.The', 'Cadillac', 'automobile', 'formed', 'symbol', 'Americans', 'black', 'white', 'back', 'days', 'artists', 'presented', 'here', 'deserved', 'Cadillacs', 'More', 'enduring', 'though', 'noted', 'end', 'film', 'main', 'players', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'inducted', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'argue', 'inclusions', 'Watch', 'film', 'then', 'get', 'Internet', 'download', 'music', 'Yes', 'ticket']",N/A

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[2, 3]","As with many pop music history enthusiasts looking forward to this film I myself was up and rearing to go when it finally came out on DVD.I mean Adrian Brody,Jeffrey Wright?MAN it had the makings for a classic and Beyonce',someone I feel suffers from mass self imposed over exposure,actually got me interested to see her performance as Etta James,even if obviously she is very wrong for the film in terms of waistline. So.....my dad rented it and decided after watching it,while it had it's good points it pressed the point of racial violence a little too heavy for his book;there is one scene here that is particularly unpleasant but I decided to give the DVD a whirl myself. Well...the violence didn't upset me as much as another point made by reviewers this doesn't have 100% historical accuracy. Then again......neither did other music doc's I've loved such asThe Temptations. What you'll see in this movie is how the rough and tumble lives of these early R&B; and rock n roll pioneers such as Muddy Waters,performed wonderfully by Wright but also Willie Dixon,Howlin' Wolf and of course Beyonce's Etta. Of course the character who gets the most sketched out is Columbus Short,a great actor as well as Little Walter,a character whose short fuse and self victimizing nature get's the most overall screen time hear and results in many the films most ""R"" rated moments.Whereas everyone else pretty much underplayed their roles. The films plot revolved primarily around the personal and professional tentions as Cedric The Entertainer as Dixon provides the occasional narration,all while music history is being made and rock n roll history is being created from the ground up as various blues styles are clashing with electricity and post war cultural standards are changing all the roles.I would've preferred to see more of that history making aspect played up.But this was a story about the people.That brings me to the main thing that may either draw you to or away from this;there's an undercurrent of negativity to this as civil rights and personal struglles are the main focus and the emphasis tend to be on mainly on the beginning of the whole ""sex,drugs and rock n roll"" aspects of the culture. Just a look at how the history of Chuck Berry,performed in a great puckish way by Mos Def and Etta James. Strangly where it should be intense the film ebbs;the lead character of the factually barnstorming Leonard Chess (whose brother Phil isn't even mentioned here,not to mention Chess staple Bo Diddly) is portrayed too nuanced by Brody.Not to knock a good actor but the role required a lot more emotionalism and loudness then it was given.But that may be picking nits. Many musical biopics such as this have taken huge factual leaps for the same of dramatic content. Sometimes it utterly ruins the film,sometimes it almost saves it and other times no one's going to give a care. With me it's 50/50.While I'd have loved to see an honest,fact based story about this subject there's always going to be the ""entertainment factor"" of the old Hollywood clishe. So it's good for what it is but for a truly accurate and often very entertaining look at the real history of Chess Records look for the PBS documentary 'Record Row:The Cradle Of Rhythm & Blues',narrated by Etta James herself.I have it on VHS but if you didn't happen to catch it-it's pretty rare these days,this will have to do.",4,Likeable Film But.....Got To Deal With The Facts,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,3388,"['many', 'pop', 'music', 'history', 'enthusiasts', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'was', 'up', 'rearing', 'go', 'when', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'DVD.I', 'mean', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'MAN', 'had', 'makings', 'classic', 'Beyonce', 'someone', 'feel', 'suffers', 'mass', 'self', 'imposed', 'exposure', 'actually', 'got', 'interested', 'see', 'performance', 'Etta', 'James', 'even', 'obviously', 'very', 'wrong', 'film', 'terms', 'waistline', 'So', '..my', 'dad', 'rented', 'decided', 'watching', 'had', 'good', 'points', 'pressed', 'point', 'racial', 'violence', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'book', 'one', 'scene', 'here', 'particularly', 'unpleasant', 'decided', 'give', 'DVD', 'whirl', 'Well', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'upset', 'as', 'much', 'point', 'made', 'reviewers', ""n't"", 'have', '100', '%', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Then', 'again', 'neither', 'did', 'other', 'music', 'doc', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'such', 'asThe', 'Temptations', 'What', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie', 'how', 'rough', 'tumble', 'lives', 'early', 'R', 'B', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'pioneers', 'such', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'performed', 'wonderfully', 'Wright', 'also', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'course', 'Beyonce', 'Etta', 'course', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'sketched', 'out', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'great', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'Little', 'Walter', 'character', 'short', 'fuse', 'self', 'victimizing', 'nature', 'get', 'most', 'overall', 'screen', 'time', 'hear', 'results', 'many', 'films', 'most', 'R', 'rated', 'everyone', 'else', 'pretty', 'much', 'roles', 'films', 'plot', 'revolved', 'primarily', 'personal', 'professional', 'tentions', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Dixon', 'occasional', 'narration', 'music', 'history', 'being', 'made', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'history', 'being', 'created', 'ground', 'up', 'various', 'blues', 'styles', 'are', 'clashing', 'electricity', 'post', 'war', 'cultural', 'standards', 'are', 'changing', 'roles.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'history', 'making', 'aspect', 'played', 'up.But', 'was', 'story', 'people.That', 'main', 'thing', 'may', 'either', 'draw', 'away', 'undercurrent', 'negativity', 'civil', 'rights', 'personal', 'struglles', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'emphasis', 'tend', 'be', 'mainly', 'beginning', 'whole', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'aspects', 'culture', 'Just', 'look', 'how', 'history', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'performed', 'great', 'puckish', 'way', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Etta', 'James', 'Strangly', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'intense', 'film', 'ebbs', 'lead', 'character', 'factually', 'barnstorming', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'brother', 'Phil', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'here', 'not', 'mention', 'Chess', 'staple', 'Bo', 'Diddly', 'portrayed', 'too', 'nuanced', 'Brody.Not', 'knock', 'good', 'actor', 'role', 'required', 'lot', 'more', 'emotionalism', 'loudness', 'then', 'was', 'given.But', 'may', 'be', 'picking', 'nits', 'Many', 'musical', 'biopics', 'such', 'have', 'taken', 'huge', 'factual', 'leaps', 'same', 'dramatic', 'content', 'utterly', 'film', 'almost', 'other', 'times', 'one', 'going', 'give', 'care', '50/50.While', ""'d"", 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'honest', 'fact', 'based', 'story', 'subject', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'clishe', 'good', 'what', 'truly', 'accurate', 'often', 'very', 'entertaining', 'look', 'real', 'history', 'Chess', 'Records', 'look', 'PBS', 'documentary', ""'Record"", 'Row', 'Cradle', 'Rhythm', 'Blues', 'narrated', 'Etta', 'James', 'herself.I', 'have', 'VHS', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'catch', 'it-it', 'pretty', 'rare', 'days', 'will', 'have', 'do']",N/A
1225570,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B001P3SA8U,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[2, 2]","""Cadillac Records""(2009)------------------------------------------Let me start by saying that I am a huge, lifelong fan of Chess Records, particularly of Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter, as well as Sugar Pie DeSanto and others.  Having a movie that celebrates this fabled, groundbreaking, immensely important, immensely influential blues powerhouse is a good thing. But, like almost all ""historical"" films and biopics, this is riddled with unnecessary factual errors and other shortcomings.  Also, it just wasn't as great as it could have and should have been.I think perhaps the biggest problem was with the portrayal of label co-founder Leonard Chess (and, um, hey, what happened to his brother, who also ran the label?). I think Adrien Brody, who I like and respect as an actor, was badly miscast in this role.  He had none of the rough edges that I image a figure like Chess would have had, none of that big city ruggedness or tough-guy street smarts: it just wasn't there. He also seemed to have little chemistry with any of his fellow actors, and little feel for the role. I also imagine that a guy like Chess would have been immensely charming and likable, even when he was jerking you around, but I didn't get that from Brody's portrayal, either -- his Chess was saintly and businesslike, but not a guy you'd want to have a drink with, or record for. Ah, what someone like Paul Rudd could have done with this part!Also, there's the tiresome Hollywood habit of mucking with the facts when making a ""historical"" film. Other reviewers have noted several problems... what stood out for me was the general timeline: the Beach Boys are famous before Elvis Presley; Little Walter is killed sometime (apparently) around 1965 (instead of '68, when he actually died) and the big wowzer ending is when Muddy Waters & Co. are invited to tour Europe in the late 'Sixties, after Chess Records had been sold and the whole shebang was long over (in fact, pioneering blues musician, Waters included, had been touring Europe for several years by then, and had already been lionized by the Rolling Stones and the British blues bands for half a decade... The film shows this happening much later than it really did.)The whole messing up the facts thing baffles me.  It seems that Hollywood screenwriters have given themselves a blank check to re-write whatever they want to in historically-oriented films, in the interest of ""tweaking"" the script, giving it more dramatic oomph, etc., and they will sarcastically remark that all of us who complain are just being too literal and taking things too seriously. The thing is, though, that details *do* matter, and if you don't want to stick to the facts, then why pick a historical topic for your film?  If you think you've got a good story to begin with, shouldn't it be good enough to tell without blatantly distorting the facts?  It's laziness on their part, not creative genius.Anyway, ""Cadillac Records"" was fun enough, but it could have, and should have, been great. It's worth watching, and hopefully it will succeed in turning some folks onto the classic urban blues recordings of the 1950s. It got me to dig out some of my old LPs.

1225571,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B001P3SA8U,Baberufus,"[1, 2]","This movie is a great reference to a part of the history of American music that is way overlooked--Chicago Blues. Most people don't realize that Muddy Waters was, by way of musical lineage, one of the fathers of rock and roll. But the most important aspect of Muddy's (as well as that of Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, et al) place in musical history is the music itself--Chicago Blues. Even if rock and roll, heavy metal, and hip hop were never invented, these blues icons would still be marked in history for their achievements in Chicago blues music. 2003 was the 100th anniversary of the blues, and despite Martin Scorsese's noble effort in recognizing this with his PBS documentary of the Blues in that year, I didn't notice much of a blues revival stemming from that year. It's nice to have movies like this that remind us from time to time what the roots of American music really are!I was really impressed with the actors in this movie--they did a great job in portraying their respective characters, including their own singing, which was great! I was particularly impressed with the authenticity of Jeffrey Wright's both singing and acting aspects of the portrayal of Muddy Waters.Some of the details of this story are skewed for effect in this movie, I'm sure, but overall I found it faithful enough in its depiction of how it all came about and went. I must say, though, that I find it hard to believe that Howlin' Wolf actually threatened to kill Muddy if he stole any of his band members again. I know they were rivals, but I have trouble believing they hated each other that much--maybe I'm wrong--I was just surprised to hear something like that in the script.Adrien Brody does a fine job of portraying Leonard Chess, but Robert DeNiro would have been PERFECT. DeNiro even looks now a lot like Leonard Chess did back then (Brody is simply much younger than Chess was at the time), and I'm sure the makeup team would have had no problem in creating a dead ringer of Chess out of DeNiro! And Chess's legendary tough-guy type attitude? That's right down DeNiro's alley! But alas, I guess they couldn't afford DeNiro, as this was a pretty low-budget film.So despite the flak that this movie is getting in respect to authenticity, I'm giving it five stars, because it is in fact a very good movie and a great effort in preserving the memory of Chicago Blues!",5,A great tribute to the fathers of Chicago Blues!,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,2367,"['movie', 'great', 'reference', 'part', 'history', 'American', 'music', 'way', 'overlooked', 'Chicago', 'Blues', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'was', 'way', 'musical', 'lineage', 'one', 'fathers', 'rock', 'roll', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'Muddy', 'as', 'well', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Little', 'Walter', 'et', 'al', 'place', 'musical', 'history', 'music', 'Chicago', 'Blues', 'Even', 'rock', 'roll', 'heavy', 'metal', 'hip', 'hop', 'were', 'never', 'invented', 'blues', 'icons', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'marked', 'history', 'achievements', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'music', '2003', 'was', '100th', 'anniversary', 'blues', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'noble', 'effort', 'recognizing', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'Blues', 'year', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'blues', 'revival', 'stemming', 'year', 'nice', 'have', 'movies', 'remind', 'time', 'time', 'what', 'roots', 'American', 'music', 'really', 'are', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'actors', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'respective', 'characters', 'including', 'own', 'singing', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'authenticity', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'singing', 'acting', 'aspects', 'portrayal', 'Muddy', 'Waters.Some', 'details', 'story', 'are', 'skewed', 'effect', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'overall', 'found', 'faithful', 'enough', 'depiction', 'how', 'came', 'went', 'must', 'say', 'though', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'actually', 'threatened', 'kill', 'Muddy', 'stole', 'band', 'members', 'again', 'know', 'were', 'rivals', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'hated', 'other', 'much', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'was', 'just', 'surprised', 'hear', 'something', 'script.Adrien', 'Brody', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'PERFECT', 'DeNiro', 'even', 'now', 'lot', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'Brody', 'simply', 'much', 'younger', 'Chess', 'was', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'makeup', 'team', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'creating', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Chess', 'DeNiro', 'Chess', 'legendary', 'tough-guy', 'type', 'attitude', 'right', 'down', 'DeNiro', 'alley', 'alas', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'DeNiro', 'was', 'pretty', 'low-budget', 'film.So', 'flak', 'movie', 'getting', 'respect', 'authenticity', ""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'effort', 'preserving', 'memory', 'Chicago', 'Blues']",N/A

1225576,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001P3SA8U,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","I feel it's becoming all too obvious that I enjoy films with great music. Add a historical bent to it and you've REALLY got me hooked. So, no surprise, CADILLAC RECORDS really captivated me.As the older musical population dies out, most of our youth have no idea where the origins of their music revolution started. A sad but true statement that can be tested by asking any person under 30 who Muddy Waters was. Or Little Walter. Or Etta James. They may not even know the name Chuck Berry! Gasp!Cadillac Records helps set the historical record straight. A (semi-) true story surrounding a white man named Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody, HOLLYWOODLAND) who signs some of the most noted (and destructive) musical talent of the 40s, 50s, and 60s, he set up a studio and was the first white man to pull in men (and women) of color. Most notable among them was the amazing Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright, LADY IN THE WATER), a blues plucking sharecropper barely out of slavery who's voice and guitar sounds struck a chord with the public. Along with him came Little Walter (Columbus Short, WAR OF THE WORLDS) who's harmonica playing startled all who heard it. And later came Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and the incredible Etta James (Beyonce Knowles, DREAMGIRLS). And who could EVER forget the incomparable Chuck Berry (Mos Def, 16 BLOCKS). All of these men and women signed on with Cadillac Records and became smash hits overnight. But with success came tumult. Drugs, racism, womanizing, money, and personal conflict all took tolls on these amazing players.For me, the best parts of this flick were watching Jeffrey Wright LIVE the life of Muddy. His voice and mannerisms made me feel like I was watching a reincarnation of the man and not simply a characterization (which is why I feel Wright should've gotten top billing for the film and not Adrien Brody). There were two large acting surprises for me, too: Beyonce and Mos Def. Both aren't known for their acting abilities, particularly Mos Def since his annoying performance in 16 Blocks. Beyonce did okay in Dreamgirls, but here she shines with a new light as Etta James. Watching her sing ""At Last"" sent chills up my spine. She grasped the significance of that song and pulled down a truly inspired role. And Mos Def as Chuck Berry really surprised me. He leapt around and swooned just like the stock footage I'd seen of Berry. Great job.The sets, costumes, and filming were simply exemplary, too. I really felt like I was in the 40s thru 60s.The only flaw in the film was that it really had no plot. There wasn't a goal ...other than to show you the lives of these wonderful and tormented men and women. But that didn't bother me overly much. Still, it's something to consider when watching it.No review would be complete without mentioning the soundtrack. Astounding! The tunes are a walk down memory lane and recount the history of who started the new music revolution. Beach Boy fans and Led heads (Led Zeppelin fans) beware!Yo kids! Wanna know where rap came from?(NOTE: Some have complained about the historical inaccuracies and deletions. I understand them, but that doesn't make this film a bad flick.)",4,"Muddy, Walter, James, and Berry ...All On One Label!",1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,3159,"['feel', 'becoming', 'too', 'obvious', 'enjoy', 'films', 'great', 'music', 'Add', 'historical', 'bent', ""'ve"", 'REALLY', 'got', 'hooked', 'So', 'surprise', 'CADILLAC', 'RECORDS', 'really', 'captivated', 'older', 'musical', 'population', 'out', 'most', 'youth', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'origins', 'music', 'revolution', 'started', 'sad', 'true', 'statement', 'can', 'be', 'tested', 'asking', 'person', '30', 'who', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'was', 'Little', 'Walter', 'Etta', 'James', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'name', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Gasp', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'set', 'historical', 'record', 'straight', 'semi-', 'true', 'story', 'surrounding', 'white', 'man', 'named', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'HOLLYWOODLAND', 'who', 'signs', 'most', 'noted', 'destructive', 'musical', 'talent', '40s', '50s', '60s', 'set', 'up', 'studio', 'was', 'first', 'white', 'man', 'pull', 'men', 'women', 'color', 'Most', 'notable', 'was', 'amazing', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', 'blues', 'plucking', 'sharecropper', 'barely', 'slavery', 'who', 'voice', 'guitar', 'sounds', 'struck', 'chord', 'public', 'came', 'Little', 'Walter', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'who', 'harmonica', 'playing', 'startled', 'who', 'heard', 'later', 'came', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'incredible', 'Etta', 'James', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'DREAMGIRLS', 'who', 'could', 'EVER', 'forget', 'incomparable', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Mos', 'Def', '16', 'BLOCKS', 'men', 'women', 'signed', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'became', 'smash', 'hits', 'overnight', 'success', 'came', 'tumult', 'Drugs', 'racism', 'womanizing', 'money', 'personal', 'conflict', 'took', 'tolls', 'amazing', 'players.For', 'best', 'parts', 'flick', 'were', 'watching', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'LIVE', 'life', 'Muddy', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'reincarnation', 'man', 'not', 'simply', 'characterization', 'why', 'feel', 'Wright', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'top', 'billing', 'film', 'not', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'were', 'two', 'large', 'acting', 'surprises', 'too', 'Beyonce', 'Mos', 'Def', 'are', ""n't"", 'known', 'acting', 'abilities', 'particularly', 'Mos', 'Def', 'annoying', 'performance', '16', 'Blocks', 'Beyonce', 'did', 'okay', 'Dreamgirls', 'here', 'new', 'light', 'Etta', 'James', 'Watching', 'sing', 'Last', 'sent', 'up', 'spine', 'grasped', 'significance', 'song', 'pulled', 'down', 'truly', 'inspired', 'role', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'really', 'surprised', 'around', 'swooned', 'just', 'stock', 'footage', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Berry', 'Great', 'job.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'filming', 'were', 'simply', 'exemplary', 'too', 'really', 'felt', 'was', '40s', 'thru', '60s.The', 'only', 'flaw', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'had', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'goal', 'other', 'show', 'lives', 'wonderful', 'tormented', 'men', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'overly', 'much', 'Still', 'something', 'consider', 'when', 'watching', 'it.No', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'soundtrack', 'Astounding', 'tunes', 'are', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'recount', 'history', 'who', 'started', 'new', 'music', 'revolution', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'fans', 'Led', 'heads', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'fans', 'beware', 'Yo', 'kids', 'Wan', 'na', 'know', 'where', 'rap', 'came', 'NOTE', 'have', 'complained', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'deletions', 'understand', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'bad', 'flick']",N/A

1225580,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B001P3SA8U,Chris Luallen,"[0, 0]","This movie tells the story of the Chicago electric blues scene that emerged in the post-World War II era and the profound influence it had on the future of popular music, especially rock and roll. Len Chess is a Jewish immigrant from Poland who attempts to bring black music to a wider audience. The early part of the film features Muddy Waters, the man who brought the blues of the Mississippi Delta to an urban audience by plugging his guitar into an ampiflier. He is joined by the talented but self-destructive harp player, Little Walter. Later Chess brings in other major blues musicians such as Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon, along with rock and roll pioneer Chuck Berry. The final 1/3 of the movie focuses on singer Etta James and her relationship with Chess.The music featured here is outstanding and blues fan will likely enjoy the movie for that alone. I liked the first 2/3's of the film better. But the last 1/3, focused mainly on James, begins to drag and go off course. It also feels disconnected to the rest of the film, almost like the director, Darnell Martin, was making a different movie altogether.

1225581,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001P3SA8U,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","As unfamiliar as I am with the music of 1950s artists like Muddy Waters, Etta James, Chuck Barry, and Howlin' Wolf, I was intrigued by ""Cadillac Records,"" a film that dramatizes their story along with that of Chicago's Chess Records. ""Dramatizes"" is, of course, a fancy term for ""historically inaccurate."" Consider the fact that Chess Records was founded by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess; not only does the film depict Leonard as the sole founder, it doesn't even acknowledge that Phil existed. This isn't to say that the film doesn't get the job done; even if liberties were taken with history, it still manages to be both compelling and entertaining, telling the story of people who had little going for them other than their love of music. On one side, there are the black artists struggling to find success in a segregated world. On the other side, there are the white men--in this case, Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody)--who wanted to bring that black sound to the airwaves. Most of the time, such men could only rely on independently run radio stations known for playing race music, and even then, bribes were sometimes necessary.The film begins by showing the humble beginnings of both Chess and Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright). The former was a down-on-his-luck club owner from Chicago while the latter was a plantation worker from Mississippi. After his goal of opening his own club literally goes up in flames, Chess becomes aware of Waters' music and essentially makes him a creative partner. They then begin visiting race music radio stations in the Deep South, Chess armed with a vinyl record and a bit of extra money to encourage the DJs. The airplay created a demand for blues music, which allowed Chess to start a new record label and open a studio in the middle of Chicago. As an extra incentive, Chess buys his musicians brand new Cadillacs; it's a nice gesture, although there is a definite sense of desperation in what he's doing, not helped by the fact that he often relies on royalties to make payments.I can't say much about the real Leonard Chess, but the film version is such a fascinating character, able to recognize good music yet lacking a lot of financial and social know-how. His marriage to a young woman of Polish descent named Revetta (Emmanuelle Chriqui) is often troubled, mostly because a balance between business and family is never really maintained. There also comes a point when he meets Etta James (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) and begins falling in love with her. She's also a fascinating character, and not just because of her incredible singing voice--assertive, opinionated, and bold, she's not someone to be messed with. Part of it comes from self-esteem issues, believing she's no better than her mother, a prostitute who had an affair with her father, Minnesota Fats. She often flirts with Chess, but she never quite lets him in, not until that pivotal moment when Chess says, ""I'm not your father, and you're not your mother.""The film also explores the relationship between Waters and his wife, Geneva Wade (Gabrielle Union), who tries her hardest to look past Waters' numerous extramarital affairs. Their story is intertwined with that of Little Walter (Columbus Short), who lives with Waters as they both sing exclusively for Chess. Walter, young and impetuous, soon stumbles his way into alcoholism, and while this made for good drama, his inner demons are never really examined. Granted, ""Cadillac Records"" is loaded with characters; if all of them were fully developed, the film would be hours long. Still, Walter deserved a bit more than he was given.Minor subplots featuring Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Chuck Berry (Mos Def) are effective, if a little condensed. Wolf, with his quiet, raspy voice and tremendous height (6'4""), is quite intimidating. He doesn't get along too well with Waters, who he feels is just one of Chess' business pawns. Unlike Waters, Wolf keeps his money well guarded, even going so far as to pay for the health benefits of his band. And as for Berry, who blended blues with country, he doesn't appreciate the fact that white musicians are getting all the credit for inventing rock `n' roll (incidentally, Mos Def has been just as vocal on the subject).The film is narrated by Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), the singer/songwriter known for ""You Shook Me,"" ""I Ain't Superstitious,"" and ""Little Red Rooster."" Whether or not this was a necessary addition to the screenplay, I'm not sure; turning him into a storyteller is an interesting idea, yet he doesn't add all that much to the story besides some exposition. Still, Cedric the Entertainer is well cast, as is everyone else in this movie. Knowles is the most convincing as Etta James, an independent yet vulnerable woman. But as I said at the start of this review, this movie is more focused on music than it is on historical fact; my praise for Knowles is more of a testament to the skills of writer/director Darnell Martin than it is to the real Etta James. In spite of this, and in spite of the fact that my knowledge of 1950s music is limited, ""Cadillac Records"" is an engaging, entertaining movie.",4,The Music That Defined a Generation,1229990400,"12

Okay, she's doing an acting job, playing Etta James. But, she doesn't sing like Etta James, she sings like Beyonce, which is unforgivable; she is not playing herself and should not be singing in her style. Jeffrey Wright is not, by profession, a singer, but he does a stand up job as Muddy Waters. Actually, he is pretty amazing. But Beyonce is no Etta James and doesn't even try to be, which she should have.Other than her flawed performance as one of the greatest jazz singers in history, I loved the film. Granted, as others have pointed out, it is a history written in highpoints. But, ya know, it's a film and can't include everything. Leonard Chess and Sam Phillips were probably the most important pioneers in the recording of indigenous music in the United States. Maybe somebody will do a good film about Sam Phillips.Oh boy, I probably shouldn't have said all that, but, as Jerry Lee said in one of his songs, It Just came out. Listen, guys. Good film. Jeffrey Wright is a terrific actor who doesn't do enough, and man, the guy can really sing. The film at least gives an overview of how that great blues sound came to be recorded. You get  a taste of how things were back then, and how guys like Muddy Waters started out.

I JUST got around to watching this and I must say that it was great.  Jeffry Wright is indeed a GREAT actor - I WILL say better than Denzel or whoever is the best male actor out.  Whatever role he plays, you are thinking of that character, not the actor.  Too many 'actors' play a role, but you are thinking, ""that's Will Smith"" or ""that's Brad Pitt.""  Wright is Wright on!First, I heard of Muddy Waters, Little Walter Etta James and of course Chuck Berry, but Chuck is the only one who's songs I was aware of.  I knew next to nothing about the others except that British rock groups always paid homage to Muddy Waters as influence.  So if nothing else, movies like these helped to shine a light on these acts and make those of us not in the know aware of their music.I watched, and as I always do, I like to research to see how much was true and what the people actually looked like.  I knew what Etta and Chuck looked like before hand, but not the rest.  I can say that for once a film got people who actually looked like the people!  People say that Beyonce cannot act, but she did a respectable job.  Mos-Def as Chuck Berry was good as they have similar features.  Mos Def did a great job.  Remember - he was an actor BEFORE he became a rapper!One thing I noticed, but was not surprised about was the Chess brothers and the film referring to him as white, but not noting that he (they) were Jewish, which they seem to dominate the music business and were instrumental in ripping off black artist - which they did show, just not in the name of Jews.  They also showed how white artists stole from them which is good.  As years continue to go by, history keeps being change so that Rock starts with Elvis and is further refined by The Beatles.  It appears as if only the British artist acknowledge the source - black America, while white America likes to take and dismiss black creativity.  I suppose this is why British artist are better at rock than most white Americans.Great film, truer to real life than many films and if nothing else, is great for the historical record for where rock and other musics came from.  Without black America, there would be no unique American culture.  We would be like Australia - without the American influence.",4,Great film.

Adrien Brody plays Leonard Chess and Jeffrey Wright gives a solid performance as the Mannish Boy himself, Muddy Waters. The movie shows the early success Chess had with blues records and then how they suffered when rock n' roll took over and the blues recordings stopped selling. The last third of the movie also touches on the British invasion with the Rolling Stones recording one of Muddy's songs at Chess studios and getting a hit record out of it while Muddy struggled to earn a living.Cadillac Records is a well done music movie. Its pace is even and the performances are good all around. The music is recreated by the actors who do a great job for non-singers (excluding Beyonce of course). Because it's a story that takes place over many years their isn't time for much character development so we never find out anything revealing about Leonard Chess or Muddy Waters although we do get a glimpse into the struggles of Little Walter and Etta James. The biggest failure of the movie is the attention to facts.

1225586,ALVJW5NXDBSDO,B001P3SA8U,C. Park,"[2, 2]","I will say up front- I am a huge Chess Records fan. I don't think you can like anything even approaching rock music without loving at least SOMETHING that label put out. I think labels like Chess and Stax did as much to change people's attitudes about race as MLK or the sit-in movement. So it is in my mind criminal to not only tell this story without the panache it deserved, but it also misused two fantastic actors- Adrien Brody and Jeffrey Wright, whom I have loved and wanted to see more of since ""Basquiat"".How could it go wrong? By taking the same well-worn paths as every other movie set in a time period that necessitates a careful attention to production. Period films in my mind often fail (me anyway) because of the picturesque yet somehow lifeless sets. I know that most people may not pay attention to these things, but it always bugs me when its done wrong. I couldn't help but think of the film ""Far From Heaven"" with its super-saturated colors and period angles, and how those types of techniques would have been perfect for a film like this. Those pink cadillacs, those candy-colored dresses- a sense of a color and a sense of place would have rescued this from the VH-production values that stultify the story.And what a story it could have been. Muddy Waters ascent from sharecropper to music legend is a drama in and of itself. Why did it not move? Why were the characters seemingly so two-dimensional? Why did one not get a sense at all of the hardships that Muddy faced, and the dramatic difference in his lifestyle after his success? Why were the filmmakers so easily satisfied with showing a few muddy fields and a couple dirt roads? Why was the second Chess brother left out? Why did one not get a sense of the Chess brothers as people? And why the horrible, typical slide guitar incidental music that's used in every drama set in the south, no matter how far from the Delta it may be?I hope at some point that someone else makes this story walk.

I have to go back to ""The Buddy Holly Story"" in 1978 to recall a better portrayal of popular music translated to the screen.  The criticism of both films seem to be with the dramatic license the makers take.  I won't argue with the distortion of the facts but as long as the essence of the story is captured I take no objection.  The thing I find admirable about ""Cadillac Records"" is that it's not some slick sugar-coated confection(see ""Ray"").  This is a tough film about musicians who legitimately suffered for their art.  What is amazing is director Darnell Martin juggles so many personal stories satisfactorily in a relatively short running time.  You could easily make a miniseries with the material here.  The cast is uniformly excellent but I'd like to give special attention to Beyonce Knowles' portrayal of Etta James.  Previously I dismissed Knowles as a pretty voice and face probably unfairly since the only films I saw her in were ""Austin Powers"" and ""Dreamgirls"" where she had an underwritten part.

His first days are spent as a vinyl salesman selling from his home and office on wheels, old Cadillac.  Soon he meets a troubled and temperamental Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright), to who he provides contract and Cadillac for the first shot. Of course he would accept it and would go to symbolically windy Chicago where, like Ray Charles, he would become club attraction, radio sensation and tends to opiates.From the rear seat of the car business began to expand, and thus eventually arrived different, equally cranky, but equally talented singers such as harmonica player Little Walter, grumpy Chuck Berry (Mos Def), an intimidating Howlin 'Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and the sensual and provocative Etta James (Beyonce) that will fundamentally change the musical tradition and music history. From smoky clubs that frequented marginal, social outcasts and the lowest social structure, with a curious but frightened and unquestionably the few members of the 'elite' that absorb incognito rhythms, moving to almost all radio stations across America, but slowly tramping the way to on the vinyl shelves all around the world.Of course, the temporal context are unhappy '50 's. when racial segregation and McCarthy policy ruled USA, and the black population could barely stand up for their piece of bread, let alone the glory.

Brody has a hard time carrying a film of this caliber by himself as Chess really isn't given much to do, other than give Cadillac's to his artists.

The ""father & son"" relationship displayed between Muddy & Lil Water was endearing to watch and Short continues to command the screen with this performance. Some of the female cast such as Gabrielle Union & Emuallanle Chrquri are wasted as long suffering housewives, and as for Beyonce, with the material she's given she does a decent job as Etta James.

1225595,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B001P3SA8U,Dexter Manning,"[3, 5]","It's a musical showcasing unknown artists who perform songs in strange but inventive ways never  heard before. It's about their de facto representative, their rise to dizzying success as well as their many troubles and, in some cases, their fall to dreadful lows. It is about their struggles (and agent's maneuvering) to be heard on the radio and thereby sell their records. It's about life in the big city and race relations during times of segregation. It's about addiction. Clubs. Showbiz. Records. Radio. Payola. Loyalty. Flamboyance. Big houses and shiny, new cars. Fidelity and infidelity. Sex. Drugs. Even rock and roll. And, it's a true story. But, it's not ""Dreamgirls."" Nor is it ""Ray."" Or ""La Bamba."" Or even ""Hustle & Flow."" Although it does bear more than a little resemblance to those films and others of similar ilk.There are so many films of this type that there should be an actual name for this subgenre, one that sticks. This time around, the movie is called ""Cadillac Records,"" a shiny, new vehicle written and directed by Darnell Martin. The storyline truly resembles so many other biographies about the rise of musical legends that it almost need not be explained here, but I'll devote the next three paragraphs to a brief summary, which you may feel free to read carefully, skim sporadically, or skip entirely.I'll bypass the typical backstory the movie features of unprivileged childhoods and young-adulthoods and cut to the chase. The ""agent"" is really music club proprietor-turned-record label owner Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody: ""The Pianist""; ""The Darjeeling Limited""), who firsts discovers a skeptical but talented Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright: ""Syriana""; ""Quantum of Solace"") at his club in Chicago before it burns to the ground. Chess then takes a gamble by replacing the club with Chess Records, signing, as his first artist, Waters, a bluesman previously seen playing curbside, whose Southern upbringing influences the distinct sound of his music. Chess' group of new artists grows to include Muddy's harmonica-playing sidekick Little Walter (Columbus Short), personable and cavalier Chuck Berry (Mos Def, inhabiting his character with an appropriately humorous personality), affable songwriter Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), imposing, lady-stealing Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and independent-minded Etta James (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, in a role with much similarity to her turn in ""Dreamgirls"" but better realized here). Also in the picture is Chess' devoted wife, Revetta (Emmanuelle Chriqui).All the artists and Chess himself would eventually go on to attain ""hall of fame"" status but, long before that, had to deal with life in and around the music biz (see the first paragraph), including rampant racial discrimination, which touches even the white-skinned Chess, merely for associating with African-Americans, whether or not they are top musicians whose tunes are copied by other bands, like the Beach Boys, almost verbatim. As Muddy says in the narration, the only time a Black man and a White man could be seen in a car together was if the Black man was driving. In another scene, Berry is thrown out of a club he is scheduled to perform in because, to the management's disbelief, he is not White, as seen in the club's poster portraying him as such. In times of crisis, Chess spends time repeatedly telling his performers that just because they sing the blues doesn't mean they must also live the blues.Why is the movie called ""Cadillac Records"" and not the more accurate ""Chess Records""? Because, Chess made a point of giving each of his successful stars not only a fine house but a shiny, sleek Cadillac, complete with those 1950s tailfins, his own preferred make of dream car since the time he was a man struggling to open his club.The whole affair is a mix of drama, comedy and, yes, music. Plenty of music. The storyline is relatively predictable--we know the general arc of the story not necessarily because anything in Martin's script is a giveaway but because Hollywood film biographies of artists and entertainers tend, unfortunately, to follow similar paths, no matter which medium the artist worked in, or whether the movie concerns a single individual or a larger group, such as this film does. But, as was the case in another show business musical, ""Dreamgirls,"" that fact does not impact on our enjoyment of the music itself. Fans of the music are in for a treat, and will undoubtedly pick up the film's soundtrack (though at my screening, I didn't notice any excitable members of the audience wildly applauding and cheering as when I saw ""Dreamgirls,"" but no matter).""Cadillac Records"" is much more low-key than ""Dreamgirls"" (more similar, perhaps, to ""Ray""). Its cinematography and production design (by Anastas Michos and Linda Burton, respectively) are much less dazzling and flamboyant. And it is much less hyped. But it works reasonably well as a film, which, when making a movie, should be the first and foremost goal. Although it is not inspired enough to break away from the typical artist-biography path, it does tell its story better, is better directed, features better acting (Knowles included) and is better accomplished in terms of basic filmmaking technique (e.g., editing) than ""Dreamgirls.""Nevertheless, like any such musical, the standout feature is the fine music, the whole reason the film exists, crafted for fans and fans-to-be.

Second (and bare in mind that I love jeffrey Wright as an actor) but he was all wrong for Muddy Waters. Especially considering that had him sing his own parts. Jeffrey can hold a tune but he doesnt have real soul pipes. And how powerful Muddy's voice was is not really shined on in the movie b/c Jeffrey can't carry the right tone. But he can act and he pulled off the dramatic part its just that with that voice you never buy him as Muddy Waters.Secondly, Beyonce can't act. She can sing but she can't act and watchingher try to be dynamic is just pityful.Now the good things: Mos Def, Columbus Short, Cedric the Entertianer, and Eamon Walker nail their roles as Chuck Berry, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, and Howlin' WOlf. The problem is that they werent the main characters and the movie was anchored on Jeffrey Wright and Beyonce. And there was too much story to cram into a movie.

There, I heard a type of music that immediately addicted me.  KDIA in Oakland, later KWBR broadcast an unending stream of genuine blues, R & B, and soul, not aimed at Whites, or caring what they thought.  Big Don Barksdale and Bouncin' Bill Doubleday held court, filling me with a love for the music that I have never lost  It was everywhere, in every home, every car, every place, and I couldn't get enough.  Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Sun House and all the all Delta Blues and Chicago Blues were my gods.  Not old enough, nor well-heeled enough for the club scene in SF, the radio was my connection that fed my addiction.  I knew all about the difficulty of life for those men and women as they struggled just to survive and make their music heard, and seethed with fury when slick White boys like the Beach Boys and Pat Boone started to steal the real music and get air play while my heroes were seldom heard.  I agree large parts of this movie are fictional, but the rough life and the hardship are not.  I believe racism will blight this movie, and it will never get the play it deserves, just as the ""race"" music didn't.  Yes, it is fictionalized, yes, it does leave out some great players, and yes, the music is not perfectly reproduced.  How could it be, considering the actors aren't the originals?  They do a pretty damn good job in my opinion.  They also have not had to live the abject poverty and open violence of the virulent discrimination of the times that informs the original men.  I think many of the Greats would be bemused to find that every great musician now pays tribute to their influence and true genius; I think even the incredible Keith Richards never fully understood why an angry and hostile Chuck Berry was so brusquely dismissive when he agreed to play with Keith.  If you weren't there, if you didn't live through it, no amount of book larnin' and movies are going to truly make you understand just how bad it was, and just how hard it was.

Drugs, alcohol and money continue to destroy regardless of race, religion or goal.  One has  to admire a hard working young man going from picking crops in the field to making music.  However, paranoia  and  the desire for more is so destructive.  This reminded me of the recent ""Walk the Line"" movie.  And for years i've heard about the struggles of Chuck Berry.  I'd love to see a sequel that goes from this era of R&B and shows Phil Spector's ""Wall of Sound"" generation.  So many of the musicians and singers are still around, and this would tie together a wonderful story of a beginning, a middle and maybe a 3rd movie that takes us to Jimmy Buffett, Greatful Dead as well as breakups of groups such as the Beatles, Beach Boys and others.

The home of some of the greatest music ever made, most of which was made at a fascinating time in American history by a series of African-American musicians who had escaped the South while working for the son of Polish Jews....There's a lot of material here.  Unfortunately, the film tries to jam all of it in.  The first half of the movie is carried along by the music (some of which is horribly lip synched by the way), but when the tone of ""Cadillac Records"" changes, the melodrama piles up in a way that is utterly unconvincing.It would have been far better for the film makers to focus on one of Chess' stars and their relationship with BOTH Chess brothers.  Instead, we get a series of cliched and entirely predictable scenes involving historical figures.  Look - there's Muddy Waters giving Little Walter his first taste of whiskey (shades of ""The Dewey Cox Story"").  Look, there's Howlin' Wolf in his battered pick up truck.  Oh dear, Chuck Berry's music just integrated a concert by getting those white and black kids to dance together.And don't even get me started on the overwrought scenes with Beyonce as Etta James.By trying to cram everything in the movie, the film makers drained all of the emotion from the story.  By the time Little Walter dies in Muddy Waters' wife's arms, I was tempted to turn away.  But the music was so good, I figured I'd stick it out to the end of the movie.Sadly, ""Cadillac Records"" piles up so many cliches that it ultimately becomes meaningless.",2,Cliches Overwhelm Story,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,1626,"['people', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'film', 'founding', 'growth', 'Chess', 'records', 'fertile', 'ground', 'indeed', 'home', 'greatest', 'music', 'ever', 'made', 'most', 'was', 'made', 'fascinating', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'series', 'African-American', 'musicians', 'who', 'had', 'escaped', 'South', 'working', 'son', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'lot', 'material', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'tries', 'jam', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'carried', 'music', 'horribly', 'lip', 'synched', 'way', 'when', 'tone', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'changes', 'melodrama', 'up', 'way', 'utterly', 'unconvincing.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'makers', 'focus', 'one', 'Chess', 'stars', 'relationship', 'BOTH', 'Chess', 'brothers', 'Instead', 'get', 'series', 'cliched', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'scenes', 'involving', 'historical', 'figures', 'Look', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'giving', 'Little', 'Walter', 'first', 'taste', 'whiskey', 'shades', 'Dewey', 'Cox', 'Story', 'Look', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'battered', 'pick', 'up', 'truck', 'Oh', 'dear', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'music', 'just', 'integrated', 'concert', 'getting', 'white', 'black', 'kids', 'dance', 'together.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'overwrought', 'scenes', 'Beyonce', 'Etta', 'James.By', 'trying', 'cram', 'everything', 'movie', 'film', 'makers', 'drained', 'emotion', 'story', 'time', 'Little', 'Walter', 'dies', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'wife', 'arms', 'was', 'tempted', 'turn', 'away', 'music', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'figured', ""'d"", 'stick', 'out', 'end', 'movie.Sadly', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'cliches', 'ultimately', 'meaningless']",N/A

How did Chuck Berry end up singing ""No Particular Place To Go"" in the late 50s when he didn't write and record it until 1964? Where's Phil Chess, brother of Leonard, and Marshall Chess, son of Leonard, who had a LOT to do with the success of the label? The title at the beginning that says ""This film is based upon true events"" rings a lot more accurately than one might suppose, with the chronology all out of whack and a LOT of supposition about how things were back then by Darnell Martin, who wrote the screenplay as well as directed this movie.And yet, when you see how ably all of the actors embody their roles and how much Martin has gotten the grit and muscle of this piece of American musical history, these frustrations drop away and seem like mere nitpicking. More than anything it shows the crossroads where two different minority cultures---African-Americans and Jewish emigrants from Europe---find a bond and help it grow, through a combination of mutual self-interest and admiration. It doesn't hurt, too, that the music throughout is HOT, even after all these years. All of the actors are superb, with Eamonn Walker as Howlin' Wolf and Columbus Short as the doomed Little Walter particularly grabbing your attention every time they're onscreen. Adrien Brody's portrayal of Leonard Chess shows a man who's sincere about his love for the music he records and the musicians making it, while at the same time not above bribes and a little backstage double-dealing to further his ends. And Jeffrey Wright's Muddy Waters and Beyonce's Etta James ring true to their sources and then some.In sum: a real treat for first-time viewers, and one of the best films of 2008.",4,Lightning in a bottle,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,1884,"[""'re"", 'more', 'passing', 'familiar', 'birth', 'growth', 'Chess', 'Records', 'Chicago', 'careers', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Etta', 'James', 'etc.', 'lot', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'How', 'did', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'end', 'up', 'singing', 'Particular', 'Place', 'Go', 'late', '50s', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'record', '1964', 'Where', 'Phil', 'Chess', 'brother', 'Leonard', 'Marshall', 'Chess', 'son', 'Leonard', 'who', 'had', 'LOT', 'do', 'success', 'label', 'title', 'beginning', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'lot', 'more', 'accurately', 'one', 'might', 'suppose', 'chronology', 'whack', 'LOT', 'supposition', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'Darnell', 'Martin', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'directed', 'movie.And', 'yet', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'ably', 'actors', 'embody', 'roles', 'how', 'much', 'Martin', 'gotten', 'grit', 'muscle', 'piece', 'American', 'musical', 'history', 'frustrations', 'drop', 'away', 'seem', 'mere', 'nitpicking', 'More', 'anything', 'crossroads', 'where', 'two', 'different', 'minority', 'cultures', '-African-Americans', 'Jewish', 'emigrants', 'Europe', 'bond', 'help', 'grow', 'combination', 'mutual', 'self-interest', 'admiration', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'too', 'music', 'HOT', 'even', 'years', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'doomed', 'Little', 'Walter', 'particularly', 'grabbing', 'attention', 'time', ""'re"", 'onscreen', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'portrayal', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'man', 'who', 'sincere', 'love', 'music', 'musicians', 'making', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'bribes', 'little', 'backstage', 'double-dealing', 'further', 'ends', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Beyonce', 'Etta', 'James', 'ring', 'true', 'sources', 'then', 'some.In', 'sum', 'real', 'treat', 'first-time', 'viewers', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2008']",N/A

1225619,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B001P3SA8U,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[38, 41]","Cadillac Records is the story of Chess Records opened by Leonard Chess in Chicago in the late 40's, and which quickly became a successful and influential record label (would Rock `n' Roll have existed without Chess?)The movie is narrated by Willie Dixon (Cedric The Entertainer) and he tells of Chess' (Adrian Brody) beginnings with a bar and a club on the south side of Chicago. The main players in the movies are Muddy Waters (Jeffery Wright) and Little Walter (a standout performance by Columbus Short) who are respectively the best guitar and harp players in Chicago. Chess discovers them when they crash his club and show up the band that is playing. Through the fortuitous burning down of his club Chess opens Chess Records and seeks out Waters, records him, and starts touring him in the south. Chess insures radio airplay with a little payola and Waters career takes off and so does Chess Records. When the money comes rolling in Chess pays Waters with new Cadillac's. New artists join Chess Records, Little Walter, the movie features Columbus Short singing My Babe that is such a standout it would be on MTV as a video if MTV still played videos. Willie Dixon comes on board as a writer/producer for Chess, Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker), Chuck Berry (Mos Def), and Beyonce as Etta James.The movie is shy about the financial liberties Chess took in paying his artists. Earlier in this review I mentioned that Chess bar burned down and their seems to be the inference that Chess could have done it for the insurance money. Chess' habit also of paying his artists in Cadillac's in lieu of cash, unfortunately he never asked his artists if that's how they would like to be paid. He also kept Waters on a short leash parsing out money to him and keeping him coming back to Chess for money. Chess rationalized this convincing himself that he was ""taking care"" of his artists, this paternal and essentially plantation mentality had to fuel some resentment between Waters, who had come from the cotton fields of the south, and Chess. Howlin' Wolf is one of the few artists at Chess that asked for and received his money. At one point Chess offers Wolf an advance and he refuses because he knows it isn't good to ""borrow against the store"" a way workers were kept in debt to companies.I read some of the previous reviews which mentioned some inaccuracies and events out of order. You have to remember movies are only the highlights of a life, in two hours you don't have time to show the events without a little license taken, events get compressed, characters combined into one, fictional scenes added to illustrate unknown or disputed periods in a life. One thing I did notice though is the anachronism in the time line in the movie. The Rolling Stones (some actors who look very little like The Stones, you only guess they're The Stones by their haircuts) come to pay homage to their idols, and Chuck Berry hears The Beach Boys on the radio and a couple of scenes later we see on TV a 1950's era Elvis on the TV.All the performances of the movie are good, I just found the presentation a little to typical of the genre. I liked how the ending links the music created at Chess Records with music that has come after Rock `n' Roll and Rap, it's a nice segue from the events in the movie to the present.The bonus features are disappointing, there's some deleted scenes, and two featurettes that I almost missed. The first is the actors talking about their characters and how they fit into the history of Chess Records, and the second is about the production design of the movie.",3,"Sex, Guns, Rythmn & Blues, and Payola",1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,3577,"['Cadillac', 'Records', 'story', 'Chess', 'Records', 'opened', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'Chicago', 'late', '40', 'quickly', 'became', 'successful', 'influential', 'record', 'label', 'would', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'have', 'existed', 'Chess', 'movie', 'narrated', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Chess', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'beginnings', 'bar', 'club', 'south', 'side', 'Chicago', 'main', 'players', 'movies', 'are', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Jeffery', 'Wright', 'Little', 'Walter', 'standout', 'performance', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'who', 'are', 'respectively', 'best', 'guitar', 'harp', 'players', 'Chicago', 'Chess', 'when', 'crash', 'club', 'show', 'up', 'band', 'playing', 'fortuitous', 'burning', 'club', 'Chess', 'Chess', 'Records', 'out', 'Waters', 'records', 'touring', 'south', 'Chess', 'radio', 'airplay', 'little', 'payola', 'Waters', 'career', 'so', 'Chess', 'Records', 'When', 'money', 'rolling', 'Chess', 'Waters', 'new', 'Cadillac', 'New', 'artists', 'join', 'Chess', 'Records', 'Little', 'Walter', 'movie', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'singing', 'Babe', 'standout', 'would', 'be', 'MTV', 'video', 'MTV', 'still', 'played', 'videos', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'board', 'writer/producer', 'Chess', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Beyonce', 'Etta', 'James.The', 'movie', 'shy', 'financial', 'liberties', 'Chess', 'took', 'paying', 'artists', 'Earlier', 'review', 'mentioned', 'Chess', 'bar', 'burned', 'down', 'be', 'inference', 'Chess', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'insurance', 'money', 'Chess', 'habit', 'also', 'paying', 'artists', 'Cadillac', 'lieu', 'cash', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'asked', 'artists', 'how', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'paid', 'also', 'kept', 'Waters', 'short', 'leash', 'parsing', 'out', 'money', 'keeping', 'coming', 'back', 'Chess', 'money', 'Chess', 'rationalized', 'convincing', 'was', 'taking', 'care', 'artists', 'paternal', 'essentially', 'plantation', 'mentality', 'had', 'fuel', 'resentment', 'Waters', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'cotton', 'fields', 'south', 'Chess', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'one', 'few', 'artists', 'Chess', 'asked', 'received', 'money', 'one', 'point', 'Chess', 'Wolf', 'advance', ""n't"", 'good', 'borrow', 'store', 'way', 'workers', 'were', 'kept', 'debt', 'companies.I', 'read', 'previous', 'reviews', 'mentioned', 'inaccuracies', 'events', 'order', 'have', 'remember', 'movies', 'are', 'only', 'highlights', 'life', 'two', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'show', 'events', 'little', 'license', 'taken', 'events', 'get', 'compressed', 'characters', 'combined', 'one', 'fictional', 'scenes', 'added', 'illustrate', 'unknown', 'disputed', 'periods', 'life', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'anachronism', 'time', 'line', 'movie', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'very', 'little', 'Stones', 'only', 'guess', ""'re"", 'Stones', 'haircuts', 'come', 'pay', 'homage', 'idols', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'radio', 'couple', 'scenes', 'later', 'see', 'TV', '1950', 'era', 'Elvis', 'TV.All', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'just', 'found', 'presentation', 'little', 'typical', 'genre', 'liked', 'how', 'ending', 'music', 'created', 'Chess', 'Records', 'music', 'come', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'Rap', 'nice', 'segue', 'events', 'movie', 'present.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'disappointing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'featurettes', 'almost', 'missed', 'first', 'actors', 'talking', 'characters', 'how', 'fit', 'history', 'Chess', 'Records', 'second', 'production', 'design', 'movie']",N/A

1225626,AKR6UK8O6DM6X,B001P3SA8U,"Lemas Mitchell ""Libertarian/ Empiricist""","[2, 4]","Synopsis:1. A poor white guy has a girlfriend and has Big Dreams. He starts out as a junkyard owner and then moves into nightclub work. After his club burns down, he is able to put his money into what became Chess records.2. He signs a bunch of earthy, gritty black musicians from various places who make some hit singles.3. Said black musicians just have tons of problems through which Chess helps them all. These problems form a big chunk of the movie.4. The label signs Etta James (later in the movie) and she has a drug addiction and sells everything in the house.5. Chess finally sells the label (for whatever reason) and then dies.Review:1. One unintended benefit of this movie was to show that color had NOTHING TO DO with why these musicians stayed broke so often. They were up singing and grinning every night and seemed to not be able to count very well. And had nothing to show for all their hard work. (Contrast this with someone as canny as Ray Charles.) These people were driving around in Cadillacs and flat broke.2. The plot was enough to keep me interested-- if only to find out how many inaccurate things I could spot. The acting was decent and earthy --although I wonder if Muddy Waters  ever really sounded like that in real life (like he had a mouth full of hay after gargling with sulfuric acid). I sure haven't seen any interviews where he sounded like that. Those Southern accents were also a bit over the top. (Oh the irony of black actors in a movie doing bad black accents.)3. There was not nearly as much information in this movie as there *could* have been, and that is probably the weakest point.Inaccuracies:1. Little Walter DID NOT die on the floor of Muddy Water's house.2. The film made us believe that Chuck Berry was jailed ONLY for having sex with an underage girl. It turns out that he had a criminal record from before and had been in the hoosegow before. So, what might have been a probation or a lighter sentence turned into a heavier sentence because of recidivism. And apparently he was a slooooow learner. He went to jail *again* in the 70s for tax evasion.3. This one is questionable. Was Etta James' mother really a prostitute? I've not been able to find anything to that effect.4. Leonard Chess did not fall dead right after selling his label, but three months later.5. Was Etta James *ever* as slim and attractive as Beyonce Knowles? All the photos in which I've ever seen her (no matter what age) show her as short and, um, rubenesque. (At one point, she was 400 pounds-- and under six feet.)6. The narrator referred to where some of the characters were initially working as ""plantations."" Um, sorry, but two things: 1) Plantations were about 100 years before the action of this movie; 2) No single character in the movie was old enough to have been born on a plantation or into slavery. The accurate word was ""sharecroppers,"" but I guess that was a small detail that was lost.Final verdict:This is worth a matinee fare or a rental off the New Releases shelf. It was interesting (for a first watch), but not worth more than a single movie ticket (as in, not enough for a date).",3,A good showcase of why musicians stay broke; Not quite accurate,1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,3126,"['Synopsis:1', 'A', 'poor', 'white', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'Big', 'Dreams', 'out', 'junkyard', 'owner', 'then', 'nightclub', 'work', 'club', 'down', 'able', 'put', 'money', 'what', 'became', 'Chess', 'records.2', 'signs', 'bunch', 'earthy', 'gritty', 'black', 'musicians', 'various', 'places', 'who', 'make', 'hit', 'singles.3', 'Said', 'black', 'musicians', 'just', 'have', 'tons', 'problems', 'Chess', 'problems', 'form', 'big', 'chunk', 'movie.4', 'label', 'signs', 'Etta', 'James', 'later', 'movie', 'drug', 'addiction', 'everything', 'house.5', 'Chess', 'finally', 'label', 'reason', 'then', 'dies.Review:1', 'One', 'unintended', 'benefit', 'movie', 'was', 'show', 'color', 'had', 'NOTHING', 'TO', 'DO', 'why', 'musicians', 'stayed', 'broke', 'so', 'often', 'were', 'up', 'singing', 'grinning', 'night', 'seemed', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'count', 'very', 'well', 'had', 'nothing', 'show', 'hard', 'work', 'Contrast', 'someone', 'as', 'canny', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'people', 'were', 'driving', 'around', 'Cadillacs', 'flat', 'broke.2', 'plot', 'was', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'many', 'inaccurate', 'things', 'could', 'spot', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'earthy', 'wonder', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'ever', 'really', 'sounded', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'mouth', 'full', 'hay', 'gargling', 'sulfuric', 'acid', 'sure', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'interviews', 'where', 'sounded', 'Southern', 'accents', 'were', 'also', 'bit', 'top', 'irony', 'black', 'actors', 'movie', 'doing', 'bad', 'black', 'accents.', '3', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'movie', 'there', '*could*', 'have', 'been', 'probably', 'weakest', 'point.Inaccuracies:1', 'Little', 'Walter', 'DID', 'NOT', 'die', 'floor', 'Muddy', 'Water', 'house.2', 'film', 'made', 'believe', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'was', 'jailed', 'ONLY', 'having', 'sex', 'underage', 'girl', 'out', 'had', 'criminal', 'record', 'had', 'been', 'hoosegow', 'So', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'probation', 'lighter', 'sentence', 'turned', 'heavier', 'sentence', 'recidivism', 'apparently', 'was', 'slooooow', 'learner', 'went', 'jail', '*again*', '70s', 'tax', 'evasion.3', 'one', 'questionable', 'Was', 'Etta', 'James', 'mother', 'really', 'prostitute', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'anything', 'effect.4', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'dead', 'right', 'selling', 'label', 'three', 'months', 'later.5', 'Was', 'Etta', 'James', '*ever*', 'slim', 'attractive', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'photos', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'show', 'short', 'um', 'rubenesque', 'one', 'point', 'was', '400', 'pounds', 'six', 'feet.', '6', 'narrator', 'referred', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'initially', 'working', 'plantations', 'Um', 'sorry', 'two', 'things', '1', 'Plantations', 'were', 'about', '100', 'years', 'action', 'movie', '2', 'single', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'plantation', 'slavery', 'accurate', 'word', 'was', 'sharecroppers', 'guess', 'was', 'small', 'detail', 'was', 'lost.Final', 'verdict', 'matinee', 'fare', 'rental', 'off', 'New', 'Releases', 'shelf', 'was', 'interesting', 'first', 'watch', 'not', 'more', 'single', 'movie', 'ticket', 'not', 'enough', 'date']",N/A

1225628,A22G6XU1L486N3,B001P3SA8U,"Lionel Bourg ""Rock and Roll Gypsy""","[0, 0]","CADILLAC RECORDS(2008)---Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright, Gabrielle Union, Cedric The Entertainer, Beyonce Knowles, Columbus Short, Emmanuel Chriqui, Eamonn Walker.A film that tells the story of the legendary blues record label, Chess/Checker Records.  As with most films of this kind, there is some blending of ""artistic license"" and the historical facts.  However, as a devoted ""blues freak"", whose first album purchase was by a Chess/Checker artist, I found that, for the most part, the story is told with a great deal of factual accuracy and a minimum of ""dramatic enhancement"".  The label was started by Leonard Chess(nee,Czyz) and his brother Phil, two immigrant Polish Jews.  The unifying theme of the film is the relationship that developed between Leonard and Muddy Waters(aka, McKinley Morganfield).  Leonard owned a bar called the Macomba Lounge on Chicago's South Side that catered predominantly to blacks and featured black musicians.  As a result of owning the nightclub, Leonard began to realize that the real money was to be made by recording the artists who played the blues music that his customers came to hear.  From the insurance money he got as a result of an ""unfortunate"" fire that burned down the Macomba, Chess started his record label.  Chess became the home of a virtual, ""Who's Who"", of Chicago blues artists, many of whom had migrated north from the cotton fields of their native south.  By ""plugging in"" and amplifying the blues music they had brought with them, they effected a revolution in the genre.  In addition to Muddy Waters, who was perhaps the single most important figure in that revolution, artists who recorded for Chess included: Etta James; Howlin' Wolf(aka, Chester Burnett); Little Walter Jacobs, who was one of the first to amplify his blues harmonica playing, and is generally regarded as the greatest blues harpist ever; Bo Diddley(aka, Ellas McDaniel); and, the Father of Rock & Roll Guitar, Chuck Berry.  In addition to these performers, Chess was blessed by having on board a gentleman by the name of Willie Dixon, who was the ""house bass player"" and, much more importantly, wrote the bulk of the songs recorded by Waters, Wolf, Jacobs, et. al.---his list of writing credits is simply stunning---and far too lengthy to list here.  Suffice it to say that the bulk of what became the basic ""blues canon"" was written by two men: Willie Dixon and Robert Johnson.  The time frame of the story is compressed, but the story is told accurately and it doesn't gloss over some of the uglier aspects of the story.  It is well-known that Chess took a ""paternalistic"" approach to his artists---he ""took care of them"", doling out money whenever they needed to pay the rent or buy a home or needed bail money to get out of jail.  He also was in the habit of buying his artists a new Cadillac when they had a #1 record, hence the title of the film.  But, he also cheated many of them when it came to paying the artist's royalties they were entitled to, and the film depicts that aspect of the ""Chess story"" candidly.  With the rise of rock & roll, and the so-called ""British Invasion"" of the 60's, Chess was eventually forced to sell the label and died of a heart attack shortly thereafter, which is where the film ends.  Some of the Chess artists experienced ""career revivals"" when the British blues musicians who worshiped them, and grew up listening to their records, brought them to Europe to tour and hired them to open their shows in the U.S.  The various actors portraying the principals all give effective, convincing portrayals.  Adrien Brody is quite good as Chess, and Jeffrey Wright and Beyonce Knowles are particularly good as Muddy Waters and Etta James, respectively.  The only real criticisms I have of the film are: 1)Instead of using the actual recordings of the various artists, the actors portraying them do the singing and, while they all do a credible job, given their historical importance, I think it would have been better to have them ""lip-synch"" the original recordings; and 2)no mention whatsoever is made of Bo Diddley, who was one of the seminal figures of early rock&roll---he; also wrote many songs that became ""blues standards"", e.g., ""Who Do You Love""; ""Mona""; ""I'm a Man""; etc.  This seemed to me an incredible omission.  But, those cavils aside, this is a ""must-see"" film for any fan of the blues or for anyone who might like to know more about the genre and the performers who put ""the blues"" on the musical map.",4,Spinning Blues Into Gold!,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,4484,"['CADILLAC', 'RECORDS', '2008', '-Adrien', 'Brody', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'Emmanuel', 'Chriqui', 'Eamonn', 'Walker.A', 'film', 'story', 'legendary', 'blues', 'record', 'label', 'Chess/Checker', 'Records', 'most', 'films', 'kind', 'blending', 'artistic', 'license', 'historical', 'facts', 'However', 'devoted', 'blues', 'freak', 'first', 'album', 'purchase', 'was', 'Chess/Checker', 'artist', 'found', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'told', 'great', 'deal', 'factual', 'accuracy', 'minimum', 'dramatic', 'enhancement', 'label', 'was', 'started', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'nee', 'Czyz', 'brother', 'Phil', 'two', 'immigrant', 'Polish', 'Jews', 'unifying', 'theme', 'film', 'relationship', 'developed', 'Leonard', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'aka', 'McKinley', 'Morganfield', 'Leonard', 'owned', 'bar', 'called', 'Macomba', 'Lounge', 'Chicago', 'South', 'Side', 'catered', 'predominantly', 'blacks', 'featured', 'black', 'musicians', 'result', 'owning', 'nightclub', 'Leonard', 'began', 'realize', 'real', 'money', 'was', 'be', 'made', 'recording', 'artists', 'who', 'played', 'blues', 'music', 'customers', 'came', 'hear', 'insurance', 'money', 'got', 'result', 'unfortunate', 'fire', 'burned', 'down', 'Macomba', 'Chess', 'started', 'record', 'label', 'Chess', 'became', 'home', 'virtual', 'Who', 'Who', 'Chicago', 'blues', 'artists', 'many', 'whom', 'had', 'migrated', 'north', 'cotton', 'fields', 'native', 'south', 'plugging', 'amplifying', 'blues', 'music', 'had', 'brought', 'effected', 'revolution', 'genre', 'addition', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'who', 'was', 'perhaps', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'figure', 'revolution', 'artists', 'who', 'recorded', 'Chess', 'included', 'Etta', 'James', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'aka', 'Chester', 'Burnett', 'Little', 'Walter', 'Jacobs', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'amplify', 'blues', 'harmonica', 'playing', 'generally', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'blues', 'harpist', 'ever', 'Bo', 'Diddley', 'aka', 'Ellas', 'McDaniel', 'Father', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Guitar', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'addition', 'performers', 'Chess', 'was', 'blessed', 'having', 'board', 'gentleman', 'name', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'who', 'was', 'house', 'bass', 'player', 'much', 'more', 'importantly', 'wrote', 'bulk', 'songs', 'recorded', 'Waters', 'Wolf', 'Jacobs', 'et', 'al.', '-his', 'list', 'writing', 'credits', 'simply', 'stunning', '-and', 'far', 'too', 'lengthy', 'list', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'bulk', 'what', 'became', 'basic', 'blues', 'canon', 'was', 'written', 'two', 'men', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'time', 'frame', 'story', 'compressed', 'story', 'told', 'accurately', ""n't"", 'gloss', 'uglier', 'aspects', 'story', 'well-known', 'Chess', 'took', 'paternalistic', 'approach', 'artists', '-he', 'took', 'care', 'doling', 'out', 'money', 'whenever', 'needed', 'pay', 'rent', 'buy', 'home', 'needed', 'bail', 'money', 'get', 'jail', 'also', 'was', 'habit', 'buying', 'artists', 'new', 'Cadillac', 'when', 'had', '1', 'record', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'also', 'cheated', 'many', 'when', 'came', 'paying', 'artist', 'royalties', 'were', 'entitled', 'film', 'aspect', 'Chess', 'story', 'candidly', 'rise', 'rock', 'roll', 'so-called', 'British', 'Invasion', '60', 'Chess', 'was', 'eventually', 'forced', 'sell', 'label', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'where', 'film', 'Chess', 'artists', 'experienced', 'career', 'revivals', 'when', 'British', 'blues', 'musicians', 'who', 'worshiped', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'records', 'brought', 'Europe', 'tour', 'hired', 'open', 'shows', 'U.S', 'various', 'actors', 'portraying', 'principals', 'give', 'effective', 'convincing', 'portrayals', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'quite', 'good', 'Chess', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Etta', 'James', 'respectively', 'only', 'real', 'criticisms', 'have', 'film', 'are', '1', 'Instead', 'using', 'actual', 'recordings', 'various', 'artists', 'actors', 'portraying', 'do', 'singing', 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'given', 'historical', 'importance', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'lip-synch', 'original', 'recordings', '2', 'mention', 'whatsoever', 'made', 'Bo', 'Diddley', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'seminal', 'figures', 'early', 'rock', 'roll', '-he', 'also', 'wrote', 'many', 'songs', 'became', 'blues', 'standards', 'e.g.', 'Who', 'Do', 'Love', 'Mona', ""'m"", 'Man', 'etc', 'seemed', 'incredible', 'omission', 'cavils', 'aside', 'must-see', 'film', 'fan', 'blues', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'like', 'know', 'more', 'genre', 'performers', 'who', 'put', 'blues', 'musical', 'map']",N/A

Leonard is going to open up a bar and club for Negro Artists to play and drink in &#8211; it will be called the Macomba Lounge. Her white father just sneers at this dreamer and his big ideas&#8230;Meanwhile down South in Stovall, Mississippi a car drives up to a shack and two men exit &#8211; one of them is the legendary Folk Music collector for the Library of Congress Alan Lomax. The black man they&#8217;ve come to see is Morgan McKinleyfield &#8211; MUDDY WATERS (a stunning outing for Geoffrey Wright). Right there at his plywood home they record him &#8211; and for the first time Muddy Waters hears his own voice and unique slide technique. It&#8217;s all the mighty man needs &#8211; he packs his guitar case and meagre belongings and heads for the metropolis where a Blues Man can get noticed&#8230;Quite apart from the obvious brilliance and groundbreaking nature of the music &#8211; there are three things that make &#34;Cadillac Records&#34; rock as a film.First up is the extraordinary casting; not only is each character spot on - in some cases they actually seem to physically be the original singers. Geoffrey Wright gets the lion&#8217;s share as the mercurial and stunning Muddy Waters whose Blues made women go weak at the knees and men worship at his coiffeur (and gave the label the star and start it needed). There&#8217;s Cedric The Entertainer as the big burly double-bass playing genius songwriter WILLIE DIXON - who some would say was the true Hero of Chess Records (&#34;My Babe&#34;, &#34;I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man&#34;, &#34;Bring It On Home&#34;, &#34;Help Me&#34;, &#34;Little Red Rooster&#34;, &#34;Wang Dang Doodle&#34; and more &#8211; he wrote them all). There&#8217;s Mos Def as the lyrically-brilliant hit-writing CHUCK BERRY who dragged the label out of the declining Blues scene into the exploding Rock 'n' Roll era (despite his miserly ways and penchant for the younger ladies). And straight off the street at 17 years of age is the wildly volatile Columbus Short as the electrifying harmonica prodigy LITTLE WALTER (rated by many as the best harp player who ever lived). But it's England's Eamonn Walker as HOWLIN' WOLF and America's Beyonc&eacute; Knowles as ETTA JAMES that send the whole proceedings into the stratosphere. They bring both of these huge forces of nature to electrifying musical life right in front of you (Etta also gave Chess a lead into the burgeoning Sixties Soul market). Lesser-known names (but just as important) like Jimmie Rogers, Hubert Sumlin and James Cotton are all represented too.The second aspect to the movie&#8217;s success is the music: using sympathetic Blues men like Chris Thomas King to remake the well-known classics &#8211; it gives their creation in the studio a stunning sense of new excitement. You feel those slide licks and harmonica warbles and power vocals - you feel the crowd and the band in those sweaty clubs heaving with the sound of freedom and sex.And although it&#8217;s not historically accurate when it comes to the actual story of the label and its founder &#8211; the third winner is that Writer/Director Darnell Martin doesn&#8217;t shirk the darker side. We get graphic depictions of Muddy&#8217;s home-wrecking womanizing and spendthrift ways, Little Walter&#8217;s gun-totting murderous madness and descent into alcoholism, Etta&#8217;s stunning voice but volatile nature and eventual terrible drug habit - and even Leonard&#8217;s liberal attitude towards payola (Chuck Berry&#8217;s song-writing credits and therefore royalties were split and given to others like DJ Alan Freed).The BLU RAY picture is lovely throughout and when the pink, blue and red Cadillacs are on screen &#8211; all shining chrome and garish paintjobs &#8211; they look good enough to lick. The Aspect Ratio is 2.35:1 so there are bars on the top and bottom of the screen &#8211; but even stretched to Full Aspect &#8211; it looks great.Audio is English TRUEHD 5.1, Russian (VO) and Spanish.

1225633,A17BUUBOU0598B,B001P3SA8U,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[21, 22]","Cadillac Recordsis a very good movie that brings to life the early years of Chess Records, the Blues and Rock and Roll.  It takes some artistic license with music history.  But it succeeds in creating a compelling story that introduces younger audiences to the lives of music legends like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Howlin' Wolf, Willie Dixon, Chuck Berry and Etta James.  Movies based on real events are always a challenge.  Problems with timeline  continuity may irk those who are already well educated on the music.  Yet writer / director Darnell Martin deserves praise for all of the accurate history that this movie succeeds in squeezing into two hours.For those wondering if they should see this movie, my answer is an unequivocal ""yes.""  Those who are interested in the special features and more details on the history, please read on.THE STORYThe story of Chess Records hinges on the relationship between two key characters, Len Chess, played by Adrien Brody, and Muddy Waters, played expertly by Jeffrey Wright.  When Chess decides to record Waters, the history of music is forever changed and Chess Records is put on the map.Columbus Short is great as Little Walter, the volatile harmonica player and Blues singer who, at the young age of 17, started playing with Muddy Waters.  Even at that age, he was already a master of his instrument having been a street performer before his teens.  He first appears on Muddy's recordings but eventually becomes a hit recording artist for Chess Records on his own.Eamonn Walker also puts in a great performance as legendary blues singer Howlin' Wolf.  He clashes with Muddy over women and band members.  We also get to see the record label grow into a major force with artists who cross-over to mainstream radio, such as Chuck Berry, played by Mos Def, and Etta James, played by Beyonce Knowles.  Mos Def puts in a good performance as Berry, but Beyonce really shows her tremendous growth as an actress.The legendary song-writer Willie Dixon is played by Cedric The Entertainer, who is mainly the narrator and has limited screen time.  Even as a fan of Cedric the Entertainer, I think it was a stretch to cast him as Willie Dixon.  He is simply too old to portray a young Dixon during the 50s, and I found his accent distracting.The success of Chess Records is bitter sweet, as some of its artists succumb to their demons and over time more of their music is copied by other artists.  Still, we get a clear picture of the tremendous influence that early Blues musicians had on Rock and Roll.THE MUSICMusical tastes vary, and to many people no re-creation of any blues classic could ever live up to the original.  Yet I really think that the music of this movie is very well done, considering that not all of the actors had formal training and they produced this film with limited time and money.  Steve Jordon produced the music for the movie, directing the actors on their singing and arranging for professional musicians to re-record the arrangements.In addition, Terrence Blanchard lent his accomplished hand to the score of the movie.  While the score mostly blends into the background, that is a sign of how well made it is.  The music is a central character in this movie and they made the right choices here by employing two incredible musical minds.SPECIAL FEATURESThere is a standard production feature included that has interviews excerpts from the director and cast members.  There are some valuable insights into the technical aspects of the production, including sets, wardrobe and makeup.Deleted Scenes: There are some interesting deleted scenes included here.  In one, Len introduces Phil Chess to Muddy.  Many think Phil's character wasn't in the movie at all because this scene was cut.  Played by Shiloh Fernandez, Phil actually does still have some other scenes in the movie: one where he introduces Etta to Len and a few others in the recording studio.  But while Phil at least has face time, the Great Bo Diddly is unfortunately not in the movie.  There were just too many characters to cast, it seems.  Other deleted scenes include one of Len and his wife, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui, an alternate take of the scene where Howlin' Wolf threatens Muddy, and two different versions of a scene where musicians are locked out of Chess studios.DIRECTOR COMMENTARY: While I religiously watch special features, I rarely enjoy the director's commentary as much as I did with this movie.  Director Darnell Martin communicates just how tight the budget was, including:**  The scene where Len Chess pays Vincent Dinofrio, a radio DJ in the movie, to play Muddy Waters record was shot on a set that had been built that day while the paint was still wet!**  Because they couldn't budget for wigs for the actors who played the Rolling Stones, several were cast for hair alone.**  Perhaps most incredibly, many of Columbus Short's scenes were filmed in one take.  The company that insured the film put strict limits to avoid any cost overruns due to filming delays.THE HISTORY (*** SPOILERS ***)The director admits in the commentary that there was no evidence of any of the intimacy between Len and Etta that is portrayed in the movie.  She stands by the story that Chess did ensure that Etta was returned the deed to her home upon his death.  She also seems to play on the fact that Len resisted Etta's affections because of race.  One other interesting fact: she reiterates it was likely that Minnesota Fats was Etta's father.The conflict that arose between Wolf and Muddy over guitarist Hubert Sumlin was indeed based upon real events.  Muddy did take Hubert for his own band, and Wolf did threaten Muddy over it.  Hubert Sumlin was an extra in the movie and vouched for the scene where Wolf stands up to Len.Also of note is the story that Little Walter killed his impersonator, which according to the commentary was based on Sonny Boy Williamson's account.  Sonny played with Walter and knew him well.CONTINUITY PROBLEMSThere are several issues with chronology in the movie.  Some changes add drama to the story.  Yet even giving the director the creative benefit of the doubt, it is very difficult to tell what year it is as the movie wears on.  Some facts seem to suggest it's 1957, then people from 1964 show up and suddenly we are back in 1960.  While the significant timeline errors don't make this a less enjoyable movie, they do ensure that anybody who studies the history of this music will either be incredibly annoyed by the inconsistencies or feel the need to study the movie to find them all.It seems strange that Chuck Berry discusses the Beach Boy's copying his hit ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" before he is arrested.  It's a significant continuity issue since he eventually served 5 years under that conviction, and in the movie there is barely a mention of the time that elapses before he re-appears.There are similar chronological changes made to introduce Muddy Waters and the Rolling Stones.  The Rolling Stones did actually record at Chess Studios during their 1964 US tour, though I am not sure if they met during that original recording session.  The Stones didn't yet have a hit in the US.  Muddy toured in the UK and Europe in the late 50s, but here they imply the Stones set up his first UK tour in the late 60s. It also seems strange that introduce them before Elivs Prestley.CONCLUSIONNo flaw takes anything away from the great performances by the cast, the very good direction by Darnell Martin and the wonderful music that has been recreated so well for this movie.  I definitely recommend this film to all fans of music history.  And if you are a Blues fan, I would guess you likely have already seen the movie.  Don't let a critical eye prevent you from enjoying this movie for what it is.  This is a film that is well designed to introduce the music of the Blues and early Rock and Roll to a wider audience than ever before.  And that is something that I definitely think deserves praise.Enjoy.",4,"Cadillac Records - A Very Good Movie, Despite Continuity Issues",1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,7983,"['Cadillac', 'Recordsis',

1225634,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001P3SA8U,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 2]","Cadillac Records tells the story of Chess Records, a recording company founded by the two Chess brothers. Chess Record helped make Etta James, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf and so many more artists famous or even living legends; and that's wonderful. The plot moves along at a good pace although this is not the way things happened in real life and that's a shame. For example, there were two Chess brothers but in this film we only see one of them, Leonard Chess. The plot is also a bit complicated since there are several principle actors in this film. Nevertheless, Cadillac Records is a story about music and race relations; it provides a great deal of insight into just how well good music brought about positive change in American society. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography for the crowded fight scenes really shines. The acting is outstanding.The movie itself begins with a brief shot of Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer) who narrates at times to tell the entire story as a flashback. We quickly meet Leonard Chess (Adrian Brody), an ambitious young man who wants to get ahead in this world. Leonard first opens a club in Chicago; but just about the time he meets a few budding artists including Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright), Little Walter (Columbus Short) and Jimmy Rogers (Kevin Mambo), Leonard's nightclub mysteriously burns down. Leonard takes the insurance money and buys space for a recording studio--and after a few bribes to some disc jockeys he gets his first recordings from these artists onto the airwaves. Their careers take off like soaring jets and Chess Records clearly will be around to stay. Leonard also starts a tradition that if a singer makes a hit record he will reward them with a Cadillac. Over time other budding artists including Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Etta James (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) become part of the ""family"" that is Chess Records.It's fascinating to watch the movie; we see how fatherly Leonard Chess is to his team. For example, Chess always makes sure that Muddy Waters has some money to get by long after Muddy's records have stopped selling. Unfortunately, however, we also see Leonard begin to cheat on his wife Revetta (Emmanuelle Chriqui) with Etta James; and Muddy Waters and other musicians sometimes accuse Leonard of taking advantage of them. In addition, these musicians carry enough weapons on them to make me think this is some kind of gangster movie cloaked in the guise of a musical! There's much more action in this movie, too.But the plot is really not the true message of this film. It's particularly important to tell this story because so few people remember who Muddy Waters was; they may not own any of his albums and I myself had never heard of Howlin' Wolf or Willie Dixon. I enjoyed some incredible acting as the movie shows the creative and interpersonal tensions between them that must have built up over years of working together so closely.The DVD has a couple of featurettes about the film and how they made it happen.

This like all biopics condenses stories and leaves out tons of people , the worst omission is the other chess brother however.  That was just not a good thing at all. However watching this movie you do a get a feel for how r and b (rock) came to be and how chess really helped to create it. the acting is great throughout. and beyonce proves she can act and she really needs to go away from the stale format of hip hop and become the diva she is musically. I would give this movie four stars just because it attempts to tell one of the most important musical tales of all time how rock came from the blues around 1947 or so long before allen freed gave r an b it's new name.  The characters are well defined and the story is a basic one but without this movie many people would never know how important muddy waters and the rest of them really were. Bo diddley is missing in action though and that is just not a good thing at all either. This movie looks great on blu ray and it has deleted scenes and other features.  IT's well worth watching to get the basic although distorted story of chess records and the early rock days. For that reason we need more stories about this era and I don't think one star reviews because they didn't give a character more time when they are telling a general story is a good thing either.

He ran the legendary company with his brother, Phil, through the 1950s and '60s.[2] The label started selling albums from the back of Chess' Cadillac,[3] and launched the careers of legendary musical personalities such as blues singers and harmonica and guitar players Little Walter and Howlin' Wolf, blues musician Muddy Waters, soul legend Etta James[4] and guitarist singer-songwriters Chuck Berry and Bo DiddleyCastingOriginally, Matt Dillon was slated to play the role of Chess,[5] but the role was ultimately given to Academy Award-winner Adrien Brody due to scheduling conflicts with Dillon.[6] Early announcements of the cast also included Columbus Short as Little Walter , Jeffrey Wright as Muddy Waters,[2] and Grammy Award winning singer Beyonc&eacute; Knowles as Etta James. According to director Martin, she wrote the role of James with Knowles in mind.[7]As production increased the roster had grown to include Canadian actress Emmanuelle Chriqui as Revetta Chess, Tammy Blanchard as Isabelle Allen, and comedian Cedric the Entertainer as Willie Dixon.[8][9][3] Final line ups of the cast also grew to include rapper Mos Def as Chuck Berry, and Gabrielle Union in the role of Geneva Wade, Muddy Waters' girlfriend.[10]FilmingThe filming of Cadillac Records started in February 2008, in Newark, New Jersey and Mississippi, United States.[8] Martin directed the film,[2][4] and shot for Sony BMG Film.[5]Cadillac Records was produced by Andrew Lack and Sofia Sondervan,[9] and co-executive produced by Beyonc&eacute; Knowles.[2]MusicAmerican multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and music producer Steve Jordan will produce the soundtrack to the film.[11] Knowles recorded five songs for the soundtrack, including a cover version of Etta James' ""At Last"" which will be released on December 2, 2008 as its lead single.[12] Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Columbus Short, and Eamonn Walker recorded songs for the soundtrack, and Raphael Saadiq, Knowles' sister Solange, Mary Mary, Nas, Buddy Guy and Elvis Presley also appears on the album.

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 64% of critics gave positive reviews based on 70 reviews. Its concensus state that ""What Cadillac Records may lack in originality, it more than makes up for in strong performances and soul-stirring music."" [14] Another review aggretator, Metacritic, gave the film a 64/100 approval rating based on 26 reviews classifying that the film has ""generally favorable reviews"". [15]Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film 3 stars and stated in his review that ""The film is a fascinating record of the evolution of a black musical style, and the tangled motives of the white men who had an instinct for it."" [16] Elizbeth Weitzman of the Daily News awarded the film with 3 stars and wrote in her review, ""Writer-director Darnell Martin clearly respects the fact that the history of Chess Records is a worthy subject."" [17] Most critics praised the film for its music, but complain about its script. Jim Harrington of the Mercury News praised Knowles' vocal performance and wrote in his review that Beyonc&eacute; Knowles captivating voice and the film's other pluses can't outweigh the glaring omissions from the story line for this critic"" and ""Chess Records deserves, and will hopefully someday get, a better spin than the one delivered by ""Cadillac Records.""

Anyone into music should understand the invaluable contributions they made to the development of rock and blues. Regarding the performances, they were all quite good. Unfortunately, as noted by others, many were too glossed over. I'd have rather seen more on Muddy and Wolf, the two who really put Chess on the map even before Chuck, and whose stories could indeed make an entire film unto their own. The one major flaw was Beyonce as Etta James. Her performance was, at least in my opinion, barely adequate. She simply cannot act. And even though she's a singer, she's clearly not even close to Etta's league and never will be. Beyonce entertains. Etta truly touches your soul, something Beyonce isn't capable of. To that end, why not use Etta's own recordings and dub them as opposed to lackluster imitations?

I'm sure it plays fast a loose with ""the facts"" as much as anyone alive knows the facts, but the story, the performances, the sound quality are so far beyond ""good,"" I can't even describe them in words. There were so many times I found myself trembling with excitement watching this movie, as though I was actually there seeing the original players perform these songs for the first time. I was privileged to see both Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf perform at Newport, Rhode Island in the 1960s, so this subject has been of great interest to me throughout my life. I was prepared, however, to expect very little from a group of rappers fooling with this great old music. It feels so good to be wrong when someone else does something this right. There's been plenty of talk about Beyonce Knowles' stunning performance as Etta James, and she does, indeed, bring tears to my heart in this role as both an actress and a singer. And Adrian Brody and Jeffrey Wright carry the film as Leonard Chess and Muddy Waters. But don't for one minute underestimate the staggering power of Eamonn Walker as Howlin' Wolf, Gabrielle Union as Geneva Wade, Columbus Short as Little Walter, and Mos Def as a spot-on Chuck Berry. If you love the blues and rock & roll, don't hesitate for one minute. This is the best dramatic movie about the blues or rock & roll to date. If you loved La Bamba, Cadillac Records will blow you out of the water. I've never been the least bit interested in following the career of Beyonce, but I'll tell you, she won a new fan tonight. I'm putting this sound track on my iPod tomorrow and I will check out her records. Now, if they'll just spin it off and let Eamonn Walker do a movie on the life of Howlin' Wolf, and Mos Def devote an entire film to Chuck Berry's life, I'll be delighted.

The Chess greats have been my life-long heroes, and as a harp player I was particularly thrilled to see Little Walter given so much attention in a Hollywood movie--no matter how maudlin. And boy is this movie maudlin! Really cheesy stuff, but movingly acted by the cast and with great art direction (cars and amplifiers are photographed with almost fetishistic love of the period).Unfortunately the film had some major shortcomings, some of which I've already seen mentioned by other reviewers. The biggest disappointment for me was the omission of one of the absolute greats of the era--Sonny Boy Williamson II, who had a HUGE influence on 60's blues rock. He was also a hilarious character and would've added much to the story. Although Eamonn Walker did a very credible job on Howlin' Wolf's vocals and the great Kim Wilson did justice to Little Walter's playing, some of the other musical elements were a trifle lacking. Jeffrey Wright's singing was quite weak, and Beyonce's contemporary R&B; riffing was a bit anachronistic (although she seemed to have made some effort to emulate James' phrasing). Having a completely irrelevant contemporary pop song by Beyonce during the credits was a travesty--obviously forced upon the filmmakers by her manager or something...it really marred an otherwise earnest effort.",4,Entertaining and Sincere In Spite of Hollywood Schmaltz,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,1451,"['4', 'stars', 'flaws', 'just', 'anyone', 'who', 'raise', 'public', 'awareness', 'musicians', 'should', 'get', 'huge', 'props', 'Chess', 'greats', 'have', 'been', 'life-long', 'heroes', 'harp', 'player', 'was', 'particularly', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Little', 'Walter', 'given', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'maudlin', 'boy', 'movie', 'maudlin', 'Really', 'cheesy', 'stuff', 'movingly', 'acted', 'cast', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'cars', 'amplifiers', 'are', 'photographed', 'almost', 'fetishistic', 'love', 'period', '.Unfortunately', 'film', 'had', 'major', 'shortcomings', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'omission', 'one', 'absolute', 'greats', 'era', 'Sonny', 'Boy', 'Williamson', 'II', 'who', 'had', 'HUGE', 'influence', '60', 'blues', 'rock', 'was', 'also', 'hilarious', 'character', 'would', ""'ve"", 'added', 'much', 'story', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'did', 'very', 'credible', 'job', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'vocals', 'great', 'Kim', 'Wilson', 'did', 'justice', 'Little', 'Walter', 'playing', 'other', 'musical', 'elements', 'were', 'trifle', 'lacking', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'singing', 'was', 'quite', 'weak', 'Beyonce', 'contemporary', 'R', 'B', 'riffing', 'was', 'bit', 'anachronistic', 'seemed', 'have', 'made', 'effort', 'emulate', 'James', 'phrasing', 'Having', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'contemporary', 'pop', 'song', 'Beyonce', 'credits', 'was', 'travesty', 'obviously', 'forced', 'filmmakers', 'manager', 'something', 'really', 'marred', 'otherwise', 'earnest', 'effort']",N/A

To say she WORKED, ""At Last"" and ""All I Could Do Was Cry"" is a MASTERPIECE of understatement.  Her singing those two songs alone were worth the price of admission.Growing up, my biggest connection with Chess Records were the sermons of Rev. C.L.Franklin and choice cuts by his daughter, Aretha. Later, many stalwart gospel artists also constituted my biggest connection with Chess so seeing/hearing some of the history behind this very important label was indeed interesting.  Of course, much of it was conjecture/supposition but related in a very comfortable way by the incomparable Cedric the Entertainer, who portrays Willie Dixon.Quite honestly, the story itself is rather sketchy...moreover, I don't know if this is necessarily a detraction. It becomes infinitely more important to follow the beginnings of such stalwart artists as Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Etta James, and Chuck Berry.  Jeffrey Wright is commanding and excellent as usual as Muddy Waters, Mos Def is just wonderful as Chuck Berry, Eammon Walker (have been a fan of his since ""Oz"")was most effective as Howling Wolf and yet, strangely enough, I found myself cringing when Beyonce started cussin'as Etta James.  She and Columbus Short, who portrayed Little Walter, pretty much wallowed in self-pity resulting in, what else, self-destructive behavior and both gave solid performances.

In the 1950's biopic, Cadillac Records, Wright gives us a Muddy Waters portrayal that is worthy of Academy Award consideration. But his performance is definitely not the only award worthy performance on display here. Relative newcomer, Columbus Short, 26, turned in a stellar performance as blues harmonica man, Little Walter. Earlier he won acclaim for his role in Stomp the Yard. But the biggest surprise for me was the portrayal of Etta James by Beyonce Knowles. The former ""Beyonce"" is truly deserving of every accolade she is sure to receive for a heart-wrenching performance of a strong, yet self-destructive blues singer. Her acting is superb, and her singing will bring tears to your eyes.Mos Def is a believable Chuck Berry and, with more to do in this film, could have easily handled it. Eamonn Walker, whom you'll recognize from The Wire, is a haunting Howlin' Wolf. Gabrielle Union is given a meaty role as Muddy Waters's woman, and she shows us a depth of feeling that most actresses worth their salt would die to sink their teeth into. Cedric The Entertainer, playing songwriter Willie Dixon. The Dixon part of the story is vital because it flies in the face of the scenario that white men were the only people who made money from early black music. Tying all of these brilliant performances together is the central character of Leonard Chess, the owner of Chess records, as played by Adrien Brody.This film far exceeded my expectations in every respect, because it tells an untold story that pulls no punches. It is a human story, complete with genius, flaws and foibles. It is the story of Leonard Chess, Muddy Waters and the birth of the Chicago Blues. It tells the story without losing its entertainment value. It also shows how white artists of the day, ripped off black music. Chuck Berry, for example, sued the Beach Boys for copyright infringement... and won.I highly recommend this movie to those who want to be connected with the foundation of Rock `n Roll and Blues. 5 Big Stars - one each for Wright, Knowles, Short, Mos Def and Union.",5,Solid Performances in a Taste of R&B History,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,2194,"['Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'ever', 'given', 'bad', 'performance', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'master', 'becoming', 'character', '1950', 'biopic', 'Cadillac', 'Records', 'Wright', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'portrayal', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'Award', 'consideration', 'performance', 'definitely', 'not', 'only', 'award', 'worthy', 'performance', 'display', 'here', 'Relative', 'newcomer', 'Columbus', 'Short', '26', 'turned', 'stellar', 'performance', 'blues', 'harmonica', 'man', 'Little', 'Walter', 'Earlier', 'won', 'acclaim', 'role', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'portrayal', 'Etta', 'James', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'former', 'Beyonce', 'truly', 'deserving', 'accolade', 'sure', 'receive', 'heart-wrenching', 'performance', 'strong', 'yet', 'self-destructive', 'blues', 'singer', 'acting', 'superb', 'singing', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes.Mos', 'Def', 'believable', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'more', 'do', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'handled', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'Wire', 'haunting', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'given', 'meaty', 'role', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'woman', 'depth', 'feeling', 'most', 'actresses', 'worth', 'salt', 'would', 'die', 'sink', 'teeth', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'playing', 'songwriter', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'Dixon', 'part', 'story', 'vital', 'face', 'scenario', 'white', 'men', 'were', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'money', 'early', 'black', 'music', 'Tying', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'together', 'central', 'character', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'owner', 'Chess', 'records', 'played', 'Adrien', 'Brody.This', 'film', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'respect', 'untold', 'story', 'punches', 'human', 'story', 'complete', 'genius', 'flaws', 'foibles', 'story', 'Leonard', 'Chess', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'birth', 'Chicago', 'Blues', 'story', 'losing', 'entertainment', 'value', 'also', 'how', 'white', 'artists', 'day', 'ripped', 'off', 'black', 'music', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'example', 'sued', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'copyright', 'infringement', 'won.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'connected', 'foundation', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'Blues', '5', 'Big', 'Stars', 'one', 'Wright', 'Knowles', 'Short', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Union']",N/A

1225651,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B001P3SA8U,Robin Friedman,"[46, 50]","An outstanding new book, Ted Gioia's  ""Delta Blues"" (2008) tells the story of ""The Life and Times of the Mississippi Masters who Revolutionized American Music.""  Much of Gioia's book is devoted to the blues singers who left the Delta in the late 1940s and relocated to other American cities, including Chicago. With Gioia's book fresh in my mind, I was eager to see ""Cadillac Records"", a new movie which tells of transplanted blues, early rock and roll, and Chicago  -- and of the association of many great blues artists with Chess Records and Leonard Chess. The movie offers compelling portraits of Muddy Waters and Howling Wolf, of the Mississippi Delta,  together with Little Walter, Willie Dixon, Chuck Berry, guitarist Hubert Sumlin, and Etta James together with its portrait of Leonard Chess. The movie is directed by Darnell Martin.Gioia writes: ""Like Muddy Waters, the Chess brothers were outsiders trying to establish themselves in Chicago."" (""Delta Blues, p. 216).  Leonard and Philip Chess (born Lijzor and Fiszel Czyz) arrived in the United States in 1928. Leonard  progressed from working in his father's junk shop, to opening a liquor store and nightclub, the Macomba Lounge on Chicago's South Side, to establishing the Chess record label to record black artists in the areas of blues, gospel, doo-wop, and rock. Philip Chess does not appear in the movie.  But Leonard receives a tough and accurate portrait from Adrien Brody in ""Cadillac Records"" as a new American determined to make a success of himself.Muddy Waters was born McKinley Morganfield as a sharecropper in the Mississippi Delta.  In 1943, Alan Lomax visited Waters, as he was already known, and made a celebrated series of blues recordings with Waters singing and playing acoustic bottleneck guitar. The movie opens with an excellent scene between Lomax and Waters in Mississippi (filmed in Louisiana).  Shortly thereafter, Waters moved to Chicago and changed Delta Blues and music when he electrified his instrument.  Waters would make several efforts to adapt during the course of a long career.  Much of ""Cadillac Records"" is told in his voice and through his eyes, portrayed by Jeffery Wright.Howling Wolf, born Chester Burnet, also was a musician from the Mississippi Delta. A physically large and formidable man who resembled a linebacker more than a musician, Wolf was already middle-aged when he came to Chicago. He was old enough to have known early Delta  blues singers Charlie Patton and Son House.  Wolf, portrayed by Eamonn Walker in ""Cadillac Records"", arrived in Chicago from Memphis, with a surly sharp temper and more of a head for business than some other rural singers. Wolf and Waters, and the sometimes jealous relationship that developed between them, is well portrayed in this movie.The movie also offers excellent portrayals of Little Walter, (played by Columbus Short) with his drinking and fighting and unmatchable artistry on the harmonica.  His own tendencies to attract and to give violence are graphically portrayed.  Chuck Barry (Mos Def) is portrayed as the founder of rock and roll, a style that would for a time displace Chess's bluesmen. We see him ""crossing over"" to white audiences in this movie, in the face of a heavily segregated Chicago, and serving jail time for contributing to the delinquency of minors at the height of his career. The movie shows other white rock groups plagiarizing from Berry.  Songwriter and bassist Willie Dixon (Cedrick the Entertainer), like Wolf a large man,  wrote and helped produce much of Wolf's and Water's material.  The vulnerable, troubled, foul-mouthed and greatly talented Etta James was added to Chess's artists when the label thought it needed a woman performer.  James is portrayed by Beyonce. She makes a stunning presence in this movie with her passionate performance of James's classic ""At Last"". (The violinists in the studio raise their heads from their instruments in disbelief as James/Beyonce  wails in recording ""At Last"", creating an unforgettable image of what needs to be said about this song.)The movie suggests that James and Leonard Chess became romantically involved. This is likely incorrect.  Many of the details of the story are also probably historically inaccurate. But the film is a story rather than a documentary and should be judged for its own effectiveness and for the way it portrays its characters and its times. And here I thought it succeeded admirably. The movie captures the blues as it moved from the Delta to Chicago. These musicians have only recently received some of the recognition that their artistry deserves. Leonard Chess, with his mixture of paternalism, insight, ambition, and probable exploitation of his talented musicians, is aptly portrayed.  The difficult transition from their rural roots that Waters, Little Walter, and the other musicians experienced in Chicago, and their struggles with alcohol, violence, promiscuity and racism, are properly emphasized in the movie. And the soundtrack brings ""Cadillac Records"" to life. The songs are not performed by the original artists, but the performances especially Beyonce's as Etta James, are captivating.""Cadillac Records"" is a gritty portrayal of blues, rock, Leonard Chess, and the record company he founded. The movie tells of a unique American art form, developed by outsiders and immigrants, which continues to make large contributions to American culture.Running time: 107 minutesRobin

Instead I rushed to the theater as soon as I found out that Mos Def and Columbus Short were in the film, plus I enjoyed seeing the guy who plays Muddy Waters on the CNN Show with D.L. Hughley.Mos Def, as usual, played his part to a tea. It always amazes me to find out he wanted to be an actor first instead of a hip hop lyricist, but he's excellent at both. I hope he never quits either, and I loved his role as Chuck Berry, specifically when he performed. Columbus Short as Walter was crazy. Once again, (like in ""Stomp the Yard) he played a character with a hair-trigger temper, and he did it well. I LOVED his hair in this film. He was definitely ""pretty,"" and Walter's antics had everybody in the theater laughing or gasping. The actor who played Muddy Waters did a phenomenal job, as he does in other movies I've seen him in (although I can't think of any offhand). But what threw me was that I thoroughly enjoyed Beyonce's performance. I just about covered my ears every time she cursed because it sounded so crazy coming out of her mouth, but she was cursing like an episode of ""Def Comedy Jam."" She reached deep down into a diva aura for this one and did great!I also liked the performance of the Jewish guy who was the manager of Chess Records, specifically his romantic scenes. I was impressed. Actually every single person in the film played their role nicely. I couldn't think of anybody I'd rather see play their parts than them.Basically the movie is about different African American firsts and greats in the R&B; and Rock n' Roll market who are trying to make a career in music, rise above segregation, deal with music being stolen from them from other artists (I hope all Elvis Presley fans and Beach Boys fans watch this movie, but I doubt they will), but these folks aren't perfect. They all have at least one weakness holding them back and are very human.The only con I have for the film isn't really a con because the film seems to be based on a true story all the way through. Minus Short's character, everybody was unfaithful. It was almost like the music industry and monogamy were polar opposites, which made me a little sad watching the film.

1225666,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001P3SA8U,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Darnell Martin's ""Cadillac Records"" chronicles the history of Chess Records, one of the most important labels in the history of blues and rock'n'roll. This is quite an ambitious project, however; any record company - Atlantic, Sun and Motown, to name a few - has a long history and it is impossible to tell it in less than two hours. The result is a mixed bag: great music and not-so-great storytelling.In ""Cadillac Records,"" it seems, the history is less about the people involved in the music industry than about the music itself. Adrian Brody plays Leonard Chess, the co-founder of Chess Record, but the film doesn't show what kind of person he really was. In spite of Adrian Brody's effective acting, his character remains sketchy.Some reviewers accuse the film of its historical inaccuracies. Even to a casual viewer like me, it is obvious that ""Cadillac Records"" is not very accurate in factual details. Chuck Berry (played by Mos Def) appears with his trademark duck walk, but Bo Diddley is nowhere to be seen.But the most disappointing thing is the rushed and unfocused story of the film. ""Cadillac Records"" starts as the story of Leonard Chess and Muddy Waters, then Little Walter (played by Columbus Short) and Howlin' Wolf (played by Eamonn Walker) step in. While we can't be sure whose story we should be following, Chuck Berry arrives, followed by Etta James (played by Beyonc&eacute; Knowles). The narrative is weak, barely saved by the wonderful acting from the cast, especially Jeffrey Wright as Muddy Waters and Mos Def as charming Chuck Berry. Still, talented players like Gabrielle Union and Cedric the Entertainer (as Willie Dixon) are not given a chance to shine.What makes ""Cadillac Records"" special is its soundtrack music and slightly nostalgic atmosphere of the 1950s.

1225667,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001P3SA8U,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","Cadillac Records is really the story of Chess Records founded by a businessman named Leonard Chess who signed some of the biggest black entertainers in the music business during the 50s and 60s. Supposedly Chess Records came to be known as Cadillac Records due to Chess's penchant for paying his musicians with Cadillacs and not cash.I've read that there were quite a few liberties taken with the historical record in composing the screenplay. This is particularly true of Leonard Chess (played by a miscast Adrien Brody) who purportedly short-changed the musicians who were under contract to him (the Chess in ""Cadillac Records"" is more of a good-natured cheerleader who always tries to be a great friend to the musicians he hires).The chief flaw of Cadillac Records is that it doesn't have a central protagonist. Just as we're getting used to Muddy Waters as the main character, he's supplanted by Little Walter and Howlin Wolf. Then suddenly Chuck Berry takes the spotlight only to be replaced by Etta James. Unfortunately, the shelf life of musicians (and even big time musicians) is not very long--usually only a few years in the spotlight.Mos Def is excellent as a wild and creative Chuck Berry but his screen time is much too short for such a seminal figure. Each of the four main characters have one or two things that happen to them that's quite interesting. With Chuck Berry, it's the fact that he was arrested for violating the Mann Act--having sex with underage girls and traveling over interstate lines. Little Walter ends up shooting a man for simply using his name in a musical group (I couldn't understand why there was no investigation into that shooting). In addition to Muddy Water's womanizing, there's also some attention paid to his financial problems that occurred after he no longer was churning out hit records.While Beyonce looks real fine as Etta James, her acting is a bit over the top as she portrays the singer's descent into heroin addiction. I didn't buy Leonard Chess's flirtation with Etta James and Brody and Beyonce simply have no chemistry together.Cadillac Records is narrated by songwriter Willie Dixon played by Cedric the Entertainer. The film needs a narrator to compensate for the lack of a strong story arc. Nonetheless, Cadillac Records is worth seeing for the music and the recreation of a bygone era.
