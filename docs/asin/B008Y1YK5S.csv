1578603,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008Y1YK5S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 6]","I can, and have been, critical of Lifetime made-for-TV movies for ripping ""based on actual events"" cases from the headlines and turning them into rather lurid fodder for fictionalized dramatic recreations. It is one of their go-to genres. Sometimes you don't need all the media hype and sensational coverage to deliver a compelling true life story.  But that subtlety is generally lost in the translation.  With the title ""Blue-Eyed Butcher,"" the network announces that it isn't taking the restrained approach with this story of a Houston marriage gone wrong.  But really, the case played out very publicly and even became a crusade for Nancy Grace (not exactly known for her demure opinions) so maybe subtlety was already off the table!  If you've ever seen one of these interpretations before, ""Blue-Eyed Butcher"" does not veer from the expected formula.  Indeed, you know exactly where you are headed from the very first scene.  Despite this lack of imagination, however, I must admit that I found the movie better than expected (if not exactly a revelation).Based on a 1993 case, a Texas man was strapped to his bed, stabbed repeatedly (at last count, we settled on 193 times) and buried in his backyard.  His wife, as you might expect, was the primary culprit facing intense media scrutiny and legal proceedings (including a pretty horrific courtroom recreation which seems unbelievable but actually happened).  Although this is all public record and not really a spoiler as the movie presupposes you know the details of the case, I will refrain from divulging anything more about the specifics.  ""Blue-Eyed Butcher"" is split into two halves--basically before and after the murder.  Sara Paxton and Justin Bruening play the ill fated couple.  Neither is painted as a saint, but still appear surprisingly likable.  As they set up a family, the two share an easy chemistry that quickly, and without preamble, shifts to abuse.  As tensions and domestic violence escalate, what's a young mother to do?  Well, that's where the moniker Blue-Eyed Butcher comes into play!  Part of the reason that this unfolds better than some Lifetime films is that this really is a fascinating and unsettling subject matter.We do see Grace footage as she tears into the young woman, and Lisa Edelstein steps up as an aggressive prosecutor.  The courtroom scenes do have a vigor and energy.  Edelstein is single-minded, Paxton is weepy.  And the further we go, the flashback recreations add texture to the trial posturing.  Despite its formulaic approach, I still liked ""Blue-Eyed Butcher.""  Both Bruening and Paxton seem like talented actors and are unaccountably appealing considering the circumstances, but the real star is the monstrous crime itself.  The real life incident captured the nation's interest, and this makes it apparent why.  If you like this sort of entertainment, there are a lot of less interesting offerings available.  But if this isn't really your cup of tea, I'm not sure the movie is strong enough to change your opinion.  A solid, but not remarkable, Lifetime event.
