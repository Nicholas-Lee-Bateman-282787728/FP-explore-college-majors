Set in 2020, when giant robots have overtaken the boxing circuit, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlien Kenton, a former boxer-turned-robot trainer who is saddled with caring for his estranged young son Max when Max's mother dies. When the pair discover an obsolete sparring bot called Atom in a junkyard, they decide to rebuild him together, and an unlikely bond develops.

The thing about this movie is that I could see the depicted robot fights, the computer technology, basically everything about it, as coming about in the normal course of our society. A wholly believable story, probably one of the easiest SF movies to watch in terms of suspending disbelief in quite some time -- and it's worth mentioning that this actually *is* science fiction in the classic sense; a little technology, all of it reasonable, around which wraps a good story. It's not a fantasy, as are many so-called SF stories today.So here we have really great robots, some awesome robot fighting, a not-overly annoying kid, and scenes that are (obviously intentionally) reminiscent of big-arena sports today, all combined with some feel-good stuff in the classic sense.It kind of looks like a kid's movie before you watch it; then when you watch it, there are adult-ish elements; at the end, I wondered who they thought they were marketing to? Perhaps that's why this didn't do all that well at the box office: the kid probably turned off the hard core SF types, the violence probably turned off legions of mommies and daddies, and the people who did go and enjoy it didn't make the case to others that it really wasn't a kid's movie or a movie that is all that violent in the living-things-getting-hurt sense of the word.Well, whatever the case there may be, I say, forget anything anyone says and just sit down with the desire to be entertained. I think you'll find that entertainment is delivered as desired, and in spades.They clearly set it up (very well) for a sequel, but it's unlikely we'll see one, again because of the box office performance.

1392027,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B004A8ZWW4,Arch Stanton,"[7, 10]","I'm going to take the unusual step of stating the worst thing about this film at the very beginning. It is exactly the same as every other boxing/sport movie out there. The only thing different is the gimmick of having a robot as the fighter and the main character as the trainer. Having said that, on to the good things. As far as gimmicks go this one isn't bad. The concept may sound silly but what it allows for is giving the kid a major role in the film. This film is really about a father/son relationship. A VERY strained one too. Hugh Jackman hasn't seen his kid in years (since birth in fact) and when he gets custody of him after the mother's death his first act is to sell him to the kid's aunt for enough money to buy a new robot to train. Now in a film like this there would usually be very little for the kid to do. He would fill essentially the same role as the romantic interest, just being there to show the main character's human side. In this film the kid has a major role. He's the one who finds the robot and he's the one whose drive carries the plot forward. The robot boxing is almost secondary to the growing father/son bond.As might be obvious from the section above, the entire film rests on how well the father/son relationship works. With Hugh Jackman being a known factor it all rests on the choice of kid. Fortunately they chose well. I'm always a little finicky about child actors. They tend to either underplay or overplay their parts. Fortunately, the only overacting here comes in the context of the matches themselves where the characters are supposed to be performing and not simply reacting. The kid is a real find and manages to pull off strong willed without coming off as just stubborn. Hugh Jackman is excellent as usual as the impulsive and absentee father. His character is really a prick in the beginning having no obvious redeeming factors. As with all stories of this sort he's had a change of heart by the end, but the change comes gradually and doesn't feel forced. It helps that his son is an awful lot like him, which makes it easy to see why the two would bond.Other reviews have said that this is the movie thatTransformersshould have been, and there's a lot of truth to that. The man/machine interactions capture a fair amount of wonder and they never seem fake. Each bot has a unique appearance making it easy to tell them apart, unlike the previously mentioned film. The robots look real, and there were never any moments where you doubted that the characters were interacting with them. I feel that this was due to the use of a large number of practical effects instead of relying solely on cgi. What I really respected about this film was the way that it managed to capture all of the standard moments of this genre without hitting all of the cliches. There were many moments that I was waiting for with great non-anticipation but which never showed up. While the outcome of the film is never really in doubt the way in which the film gets there is very well handled. That said one or two of the characters were pretty stereotypical. The vile redneck Southerner is just an overused cliche by this point and the rich, evil foreigners vs. the small, underdog Americans has been done to death in so many movies.So in conclusion: This film adds nothing new to the sporting genre. It is basically the same story done a thousand times before. But while it may not be original it makes up for it by having a lot of heart and telling the same old story with a great deal of skill. The acting is excellent as are the effects. And the robot fights are quite thrilling. Coming to this movie with an open mind I was impressed at how well it all fit together in one entertaining package. Despite operating on what seems like a cheap gimmick it managed to mine that idea for all the dramatic potential it had.

1392028,A32T2H8150OJLU,B004A8ZWW4,ARH,"[0, 0]","As much as I hate to say it, I actually liked this movie.  The movie does express some creativity, but maybe it's because it has so much nostalgia-factor for someone my age.  Nostalgia!?  Yeah, let me explain.  When I was a kid one of the hottest toys to come out was ""Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.""  We never had one at our house, but a few lucky kids in the neighborhood had one and it was a real treat when you had a chance to play.  The popularity of that game has inspired its re-release [[ASIN:B00005BY8V Rock 'Em Sock 'Em ROBOTS Game].  Anyway, in this classic game two players face each other across a tiny ring, but they don't fight each other directly.  Each player has a set of controls which they use to try to ""knock the block"" off of their opponent.  The same thing happens in this movie, except the action is amped up about a billion times.Hugh Jackman is cast nicely as a down and out, has-been fighter from the days when people actually boxed each other.  Then came the robots and he couldn't quite make that transition.  In the process he lost his career, his wife, and pretty much everything.  He does have his son though.  And his son is simultaneously fanatical about robot boxing and about fixing things.

I love some of his other movies like Night of the Museum, Big Fat Liar, and Cheaper by the Dozen. In Night of the Museum and Real Steal they both show his imagination about what could and will happen in the future. The actors in the movie were also great and very passionate. The characters they played were very similar to who they were in real life.The theme is both action and drama. It is action because in the future instead of people boxing they have robots. It is an action packed movie and is also very dramatic. It is dramatic because his son which lives with his x-wife and he hasn't seen his father for eight years has to live with his dad because his mother died. They are constantly fighting and getting used to each other but they eventually make it happen and win the robot fighting championship. My favorite scene is when the dad and the kid are looking in a junk yard for a new robot to fight. The kid finds one and decides to try to bring it back to life. The dad who was in the business his whole life says he is a piece of garbage and will never win a fight. Then the kid and the dad have a fight on whether it's worth it. It costs a lot of money to fix it up and the dad refuses to pay for it. The kid takes all of the inheritance from his mom and fixes it. I love that scene because it shows the true character of the dad and the child.I thought the effects were really cool because it takes place in the future and the props were what you would picture in the future. Even though it was rated pg-13 I really think that the age of 10 and up can watch it. It was rated pg-13 only because of language and violence. Altogether I thought it was a pretty great movie. Out of 10 I would probably rate it a 9.5.

At one point in the story, the audience actually started clapping and cheering loudly. Now if you can wow a crowd as tough to please as NYC moviegoers, that's a huge credit to your film. I left the theater with a smile, knowing that it was $13.50 and 2 hrs well spent.Real Steel is a classic underdog story. It's about an irresponsible absentee father and his estranged son whose lives are transformed through their love of robot boxing. No one expected him to win, and no one expected his robot to last, but like all underdog stories, they surprise you and defy the odds. It's got good looking leads, cool animatronics/CG robots, humor, a hot Russian adversary babe, and lots of exciting fight choreography (Sugar Ray Leonard provided boxing consultation). Set about 10 years in the future, the science fiction elements are woven perfectly into the setting, which is modern and familiar, like present day America. The look of the film in certain scenes is a throwback to simpler times like the 40's and 50's instead of the shiny futuristic stuff you'd see in hard science fiction films. There's a great sense of nostalgia and innocence to the visual feel of Real Steel. We get some great vistas of rural America and ""classic"" small town life -- the kind of imagery that you'd perhaps see in a Norman Rockwell painting.This is a great looking film that's entertaining and makes you feel good at the end. There's a lot of product placement for HP, Dr Pepper and Microsoft, but they are not overly obnoxious. You can catch an ""XBOX 720"" gag in the boxing venue. Catch it in theaters if you can.

It has been proven over and over with the ""Rocky"" and ""Karate Kid"" movies. Quite honestly, it would be a waste of time to list them all. Yet, throughout time, people still love them, regardless of the fact the scripts are as predictable as Monday morning. ""Real Steel"" is no different. The only difference in ""Real Steel"" is that it is set in the near future where humans no longer stand in the ring getting hit, but giant rockem' sockem' robots with quite a bit more mobility are doing the dirty work.Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, a former boxer and presently a low-life swindler who is in deep to numerous debt collectors. In his desperation to scramble up money to keep going in the robot boxing business, he is willing to risk everything at a moments notice and has no desire to know or have custody of a son named Max (Dakota Goyo). He is so void of anything moral, he takes a $50,000 bribe in order to take his son for one summer and sign away his parental rights to the mother's Aunt. See where this is going? I did, too.""Real Steel"" is full of clich&eacute; and predictability from beginning to end. There is a mountain of things to criticize. There is very thin development of the relationship between father and son, yet that storyline holds the purse strings. The final battle is not just similar to ""Rocky"", it is nearly a mirror of the movie ""Rocky"", all the way up to the `Adrian!' moment. I believe I even heard a few notes of the same song that ended the movie ""Rocky"" at the end of ""Real Steel"". The bad guys in the film are so clich&eacute; and over the top, it nearly ruined it for me. They are the stereotypical bad guys from the fight movies; the 'Cobra Kai' from ""Karate Kid"", `Drago' from ""Rocky 3"", except even more over the top.All that being said, the fight movie formula works. The robot animation is spectacular and realistic. It is a spectacle movie and if you want to see something like that, then ""Real Steel"" will not disappoint. It is entertaining from beginning to end and will be a great movie for those who don't mind the fact that its script has been done many times before.

Until the son's mother dies and he has to look after him for a few months. Charlie is down on his luck, a former boxer who makes bad decisions. His robot boxer gets wrecked and he buys a new one with money he got from Max's new custodial parents to look after Max for the summer. But his poor decisions cause this one to be wrecked too.He and Max go to a junkyard to salvage parts, and Max recovers a robot which Charlie is not interested in. Turns out that the robot, though small, is built to take a beating. Max begins to train him, they begin to win fights, and I won't tell the rest. But the story is a much one of father and son renewing a relationship as the sci fi robot boxing parts.Evangeline Lilly is great as Bailey, Charlie's best friend and sometimes lover.

1392074,A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,B004A8ZWW4,D. Alexander,"[4, 4]","This is essentially a father-son bonding experience over a boxing robot. Hugh plays an absentee father and former boxer who makes a living controlling a robot against various adversaries. Dakota is soon thrust in his lap, finds an aptitude for the sport, and becomes Hugh's better half in the enterprise as they travel around boxing. Dakota eventually obtains his own robot, and the two field it against the top robot champion in a Rocky-esque showdown.It's a very slickly-produced movie. The special effects are flawless: we might as well inhabit a world with giant lumbering robots. The fight scenes are least as exciting as those in Warrior and better than anything in Transformers. The latter is particularly surprising; the robots here are the equivalent of RC cars, but through evocative design and the emotional investment of the human characters, they have more personality than the sentient Transformers.There is a romantic subplot that involves the daughter of Hugh's former trainer, but it's of no consequence. More interesting are the various unscrupulous characters that inhabit Hugh's underworld early in the  movie. The real standout, though, is Dakota. He's absolutely convincing as hurt, slighted son, and later in his bonding with Hugh and the robot. Tremendous range in general, and not just for a child actor. He constantly steals scenes from Hugh.I do have a few nits to pick. This version of Hugh is significantly dumber than Wolverine. His early misfortunes are self-inflicted from errors improbable for the experienced robot handler he portrays. It's hard to suspend disbelief when your hard-luck protagonist blows his last shot by half-assing fight preparation. There's also a lack of personal growth at odds with the upbeat ending. He doesn't care about the kid at the outset, but while he becomes less bitter as the movie progresses, he ends up less a father than an accomplice. A number of like plot threads are left open after the final match. This is all a bit unsatisfying, but leaves the franchise primed for a sequel that should appear in 2014.My second nit involves some rather heavy-handed string-pulling by the director. We've got shots of the cute kid with a single tear, longing gazes by the romantic interest, extended montages, some truly cheeseball announcer commentary, and an emotional score that announces itself when we're supposed to feel something. The pity of it is, the actors don't need all this assistance, and most of it just pulled me out of the story.  The pastiche of Hollywoodisms isn't so egregious as in something like Pearl Harbor, but they do take away from could otherwise have been a fairly powerful film.All that aside, it's a very original premise with lots of excitement and good acting. The plot arc was transparent almost from the get-go, but I still wanted to stick around to see how it played out. That's a pretty solid endorsement.And how is it for children? The CGI robot battles won't raise eyebrows, though the two lead humans do get beaten up in one short scene. Obscenities are rare. The F-bomb doesn't make an appearance. There's no onscreen sex or anything resembling it. Gambling is a constant presence. The emotional scenes are no more traumatic than those in the Land Before Time. I'd say that any kid 8 or above should be fine.",4,"Slick and exciting, albeit heavy-handed",1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,3308,"['essentially', 'father-son', 'bonding', 'experience', 'boxing', 'robot', 'Hugh', 'absentee', 'father', 'former', 'boxer', 'who', 'living', 'controlling', 'robot', 'various', 'adversaries', 'Dakota', 'soon', 'thrust', 'lap', 'aptitude', 'sport', 'Hugh', 'better', 'half', 'enterprise', 'travel', 'boxing', 'Dakota', 'eventually', 'own', 'robot', 'two', 'field', 'top', 'robot', 'champion', 'Rocky-esque', 'showdown.It', 'very', 'slickly-produced', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'flawless', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'inhabit', 'world', 'giant', 'lumbering', 'robots', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'least', 'exciting', 'Warrior', 'better', 'anything', 'Transformers', 'latter', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'robots', 'here', 'are', 'equivalent', 'RC', 'cars', 'evocative', 'design', 'emotional', 'investment', 'human', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'personality', 'sentient', 'Transformers.There', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'daughter', 'Hugh', 'former', 'trainer', 'consequence', 'More', 'interesting', 'are', 'various', 'unscrupulous', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'Hugh', 'underworld', 'early', 'movie', 'real', 'standout', 'Dakota', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'hurt', 'slighted', 'son', 'later', 'bonding', 'Hugh', 'robot', 'Tremendous', 'range', 'general', 'not', 'just', 'child', 'actor', 'constantly', 'scenes', 'Hugh.I', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'nits', 'pick', 'version', 'Hugh', 'significantly', 'dumber', 'Wolverine', 'early', 'misfortunes', 'are', 'self-inflicted', 'errors', 'improbable', 'experienced', 'robot', 'handler', 'hard', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'when', 'hard-luck', 'protagonist', 'last', 'shot', 'half-assing', 'fight', 'preparation', 'also', 'lack', 'personal', 'growth', 'odds', 'upbeat', 'ending', ""n't"", 'care', 'kid', 'outset', 'less', 'bitter', 'movie', 'up', 'less', 'father', 'accomplice', 'number', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'left', 'open', 'final', 'match', 'bit', 'unsatisfying', 'franchise', 'primed', 'sequel', 'should', 'appear', '2014.My', 'second', 'nit', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'string-pulling', 'director', ""'ve"", 'got', 'shots', 'cute', 'kid', 'single', 'tear', 'longing', 'gazes', 'romantic', 'interest', 'extended', 'montages', 'truly', 'cheeseball', 'announcer', 'commentary', 'emotional', 'score', 'when', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'something', 'pity', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'assistance', 'most', 'just', 'pulled', 'story', 'pastiche', 'Hollywoodisms', ""n't"", 'so', 'egregious', 'something', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'do', 'take', 'away', 'could', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'powerful', 'film.All', 'aside', 'very', 'original', 'premise', 'lots', 'excitement', 'good', 'acting', 'plot', 'arc', 'was', 'transparent', 'almost', 'get-go', 'still', 'wanted', 'stick', 'around', 'see', 'how', 'played', 'out', 'pretty', 'solid', 'endorsement.And', 'how', 'children', 'CGI', 'robot', 'battles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'two', 'lead', 'humans', 'do', 'get', 'beaten', 'up', 'one', 'short', 'scene', 'Obscenities', 'are', 'rare', 'F-bomb', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'onscreen', 'sex', 'anything', 'resembling', 'Gambling', 'constant', 'presence', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'traumatic', 'Land', 'Time', ""'d"", 'say', 'kid', '8', 'above', 'should', 'be', 'fine']",Real Steel

The story was interesting from beginning to end, the acting was great, and the special effects were awesome.This movie has been branded a boxing movie and even ""Rocky with robots,"" but I would argue that this is more of a story about a father and his estranged son that build their relationship.  They simply use robot boxing as their common interest to bond over.  The fighting scenes are obviously great, but thankfully, they're only the finishing touches to this movie.  The story and relationships provide for a great foundation and an all around well done picture.  This is what separates it from other ""man movies"" since the scenes without boxing still progress the story and keep your interest peeked.One aspect that made this movie more ""believable"" and down-to-earth is that instead of being 100's of years into the future and with over the top electronics, the movie is set in the year 2020 and the technology is just a little more advanced than today.  This saves you from being distracted by flying cars and computer chips in people's brains.  Compare this to ""Transformers"" where it takes Optimus Prime 5 minutes to transform and where a cell phone becomes a living organism.Hugh Jackman, of course, delivers a solid performance, but more importantly, Dakota Goyo (who plays the son) is GREAT.  Too often we've seen great movies tarnished by child actors who need a little more practice before they get cast in a blockbuster movie (Star Wars: Episode 1 comes to mind).  But Dakota does a great job of being the smart alecky boy who loves video games and robot boxing.The special features on the blu ray aren't too spectacular, but maybe I had high hopes since I like the movie so much.

1392094,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B004A8ZWW4,dylan21484nj,"[0, 0]","Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) was a not-very-successful pugilist until he was forced into retirement when human fighters are replaced by hulking robots. Apparently, men beating each other to a pulp wasn't enough carnage for fight fans, facilitating the transition into full-sized Rock'em Sock'em Robots, although I can imagine that doctors who pointed to boxing as a source of brain damage and early-onset Parkinson's Disease would likely be pleased by such a change.Charlie is forced to change with the sport he loves, training bots to battle in underground battles held at rodeos, factories, and condemned zoos. Charlie longs for a shot in the World Robot Boxing league, but his arrogance has left him with a string of destroyed bots and owing thousands of dollars that he can't pay back.Forced to attend a custody hearing for his estranged 11 year old son Max (newcomer Dakota Goyo), Charlie talks Max's wealthy uncle into paying him to take care of Max for the summer. A huge robot fight fan, Max quickly takes an interest in his father's profession, much to Charlie's chagrin. When Charlie and Max break into a junkyard in search of replacement parts for a broken bot, Max discovers Atom, a discarded sparring bot that was built to endure a lot of punishment but not dish much out. Max insists on using Atom to get into the robot boxing world, and Charlie grudgingly agrees to train Atom to fight like a human boxer. The once-contentious father and son bond as Charlie's boxing savvy and Max's unwavering faith in Atom (as well as Max's amusing dance moves) lead to Atom's rise through the underground ranks, catching the eye of the WRB. And after Atom impressively defeats a WRB contender, Max publicly issues a challenge to Zeus, the reigning undefeated champ, leading to a ""David vs. Goliath"" showdown for all the metal marbles (or would that be ball bearings?).Also populating this film are Lost's Evangeline Lilly, essentially filling out the ""Adrian role"" as Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlie's deceased trainer who has turned her father's old boxing gym into a pseudo-Frankenstein's workshop for Charlie's bots. Anthony Mackie from The Hurt Locker appears as Finn, an underground promoter and one of Charlie's few ""friends,"" and Kevin Durand as Ricky, one of Charlie's former in-ring adversaries who Charlie owes money to after skipping out on a bot-fighting bet.Real Steel prescribes to all the cliches started by the Rocky films of a down-on-his luck underdog who defies the odds and gets a shot at the big time, but the film also has a little bit in common with another Sylvester Stallone film, Over The Top. Both films involve a father and his estranged son who grate on each other at first, but end up working out their abandonment issues and bond over a similar interest even as outside forces and their own clashing personalities threaten to rip them apart. Many would also find shades of the Transformers films in the ""battling robots"" plot, but unlike those films whose attraction lied mainly in mechanical carnage of CGI-bot-on-CGI-bot violence, Real Steel's strength lies in its human players, namely Charlie and Max, giving the film a soul. And you can't help but cheer when Charlie starts shadow boxing at ringside during the Zeus fight.",4,"Formulaic, but an enjoyable crowd pleaser film",1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,3267,"['Charlie', 'Kenton', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'not-very-successful', 'pugilist', 'was', 'forced', 'retirement', 'when', 'human', 'fighters', 'are', 'replaced', 'hulking', 'robots', 'Apparently', 'men', 'beating', 'other', 'pulp', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'carnage', 'fight', 'fans', 'facilitating', 'transition', 'full-sized', ""Rock'em"", ""Sock'em"", 'Robots', 'can', 'imagine', 'doctors', 'who', 'pointed', 'boxing', 'source', 'brain', 'damage', 'early-onset', 'Parkinson', 'Disease', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'pleased', 'such', 'change.Charlie', 'forced', 'change', 'sport', 'training', 'bots', 'battle', 'underground', 'battles', 'held', 'rodeos', 'factories', 'condemned', 'zoos', 'Charlie', 'shot', 'World', 'Robot', 'Boxing', 'league', 'arrogance', 'left', 'string', 'destroyed', 'bots', 'owing', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'back.Forced', 'attend', 'custody', 'hearing', 'estranged', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Max', 'newcomer', 'Dakota', 'Goyo', 'Charlie', 'Max', 'wealthy', 'uncle', 'paying', 'take', 'care', 'Max', 'summer', 'huge', 'robot', 'fight', 'fan', 'Max', 'quickly', 'interest', 'father', 'profession', 'much', 'Charlie', 'chagrin', 'When', 'Charlie', 'Max', 'break', 'junkyard', 'search', 'replacement', 'parts', 'broken', 'bot', 'Max', 'Atom', 'discarded', 'sparring', 'bot', 'was', 'built', 'endure', 'lot', 'punishment', 'not', 'dish', 'much', 'out', 'Max', 'using', 'Atom', 'get', 'robot', 'boxing', 'world', 'Charlie', 'grudgingly', 'train', 'Atom', 'fight', 'human', 'boxer', 'once-contentious', 'father', 'son', 'bond', 'Charlie', 'boxing', 'savvy', 'Max', 'unwavering', 'faith', 'Atom', 'as', 'well', 'Max', 'amusing', 'dance', 'moves', 'lead', 'Atom', 'rise', 'underground', 'ranks', 'catching', 'eye', 'WRB', 'Atom', 'impressively', 'WRB', 'contender', 'Max', 'publicly', 'issues', 'challenge', 'Zeus', 'reigning', 'undefeated', 'champ', 'leading', 'David', 'vs.', 'Goliath', 'showdown', 'metal', 'marbles', 'would', 'be', 'ball', 'bearings', 'populating', 'film', 'are', 'Lost', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'essentially', 'filling', 'out', 'Adrian', 'role', 'Bailey', 'Tallet', 'daughter', 'Charlie', 'deceased', 'trainer', 'who', 'turned', 'father', 'old', 'boxing', 'gym', 'pseudo-Frankenstein', 'workshop', 'Charlie', 'bots', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Finn', 'underground', 'promoter', 'one', 'Charlie', 'few', 'friends', 'Kevin', 'Durand', 'Ricky', 'one', 'Charlie', 'former', 'in-ring', 'adversaries', 'who', 'Charlie', 'money', 'skipping', 'out', 'bot-fighting', 'bet.Real', 'Steel', 'prescribes', 'cliches', 'started', 'Rocky', 'films', 'down-on-his', 'luck', 'underdog', 'who', 'odds', 'shot', 'big', 'time', 'film', 'also', 'little', 'bit', 'common', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'film', 'Top', 'films', 'involve', 'father', 'estranged', 'son', 'who', 'grate', 'other', 'first', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'out', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'bond', 'similar', 'interest', 'even', 'outside', 'forces', 'own', 'clashing', 'personalities', 'threaten', 'rip', 'apart', 'Many', 'would', 'also', 'find', 'shades', 'Transformers', 'films', 'battling', 'robots', 'plot', 'films', 'attraction', 'lied', 'mainly', 'mechanical', 'carnage', 'CGI-bot-on-CGI-bot', 'violence', 'Real', 'Steel', 'strength', 'human', 'players', 'namely', 'Charlie', 'Max', 'giving', 'film', 'soul', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'when', 'Charlie', 'shadow', 'boxing', 'ringside', 'Zeus', 'fight']",Real Steel

1392099,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B004A8ZWW4,ElectricMelody,"[2, 2]","**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 10/11/11**Real Steel is the kind of movie you can predict at nearly every turn, yet it really doesn't matter. Though it's not quite my favorite film of the year, it made me feel more ecstatic at its end than any other movie of 2011. To borrow a clich&eacute;, it's the ""feel good movie of the year."" I feel so dirty typing those lame words, but it's true.Yes, if you've seen a boxing movie or a family drama, you've pretty much experienced this story already, but it's such a powerful, archetypal tale. And Real Steel tells it perfectly. Every good boxing movie needs some secret weapons. This one's got two. First, the robots. Dear god, the robots. They are so frickin' cool. Each one featured has its own look and personality to match, but it's Atom, the ""protagonist"" robot, that really gets under your skin. In a lot of ways, this is a ""boy and his robot story,"" and Atom's got just enough humanity to make him feel real. The special effects are jaw-dropping, so jaw-dropping that you'll forget you're watching something from a computer. Best of all, they're present to serve the story... not the other way around.But as kickass as the robots are, the movie's real strength lies in its leads. Hugh Jackman's played variations on his Real Steel character before and, perhaps because of that, has it down pat. He's clearly enjoying himself, which translates to the screen. The arc his character goes through is expected, but so satisfying. There's a bit at the end that totally got me. Just the look on his face. You'll know what I mean when you see it. Then there's young Dakota Goyo. Where do I begin? I've gotta be honest and say that the trailers for this movie made him out to be the typical, annoying Hollywood kid. It's a disservice, because his performance in this movie is nothing short of astonishing. He's got more charisma than any kid actor I've seen in a long time and really, really commits to his scenes. Most of the tears I shed (and there were quite a few... I'm an ultra sappy moviegoer if the movie is right) were doen to him. I just can't believe that such a young kid can take over a film like this. It really was his from the moment he was onscreen.So there you go. See it. It's the kind of the movie that's so much better than you'd expect given the premise. Don't expect a reinvention of the wheel, but go in to see those established wheels spinning quite productively and passionately. It's a crowd pleaser, for sure.",5,Much Better than I had Expected!!,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,2500,"['**Originally', 'posted', '1', 'Hits', 'Planet', '10/11/11**Real', 'Steel', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'predict', 'nearly', 'turn', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'not', 'quite', 'favorite', 'film', 'year', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'ecstatic', 'end', 'other', 'movie', '2011', 'borrow', 'clich', 'eacute', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'year', 'feel', 'so', 'dirty', 'typing', 'lame', 'words', 'true.Yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'boxing', 'movie', 'family', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'experienced', 'story', 'already', 'such', 'powerful', 'archetypal', 'tale', 'Real', 'Steel', 'tells', 'perfectly', 'good', 'boxing', 'movie', 'secret', 'weapons', 'one', 'got', 'two', 'First', 'robots', 'Dear', 'god', 'robots', 'are', 'so', 'frickin', 'cool', 'one', 'featured', 'own', 'look', 'personality', 'match', 'Atom', 'protagonist', 'robot', 'really', 'skin', 'lot', 'ways', 'boy', 'robot', 'story', 'Atom', 'got', 'just', 'enough', 'humanity', 'make', 'feel', 'real', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'jaw-dropping', 'so', 'jaw-dropping', ""'ll"", 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'something', 'computer', 'Best', ""'re"", 'present', 'serve', 'story', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'as', 'kickass', 'robots', 'are', 'movie', 'real', 'strength', 'leads', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'played', 'variations', 'Real', 'Steel', 'character', 'perhaps', 'down', 'pat', 'clearly', 'enjoying', 'screen', 'arc', 'character', 'expected', 'so', 'satisfying', 'bit', 'end', 'totally', 'got', 'look', 'face', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'Then', 'young', 'Dakota', 'Goyo', 'Where', 'do', 'begin', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'trailers', 'movie', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'typical', 'annoying', 'Hollywood', 'kid', 'disservice', 'performance', 'movie', 'nothing', 'short', 'astonishing', 'got', 'more', 'charisma', 'kid', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'really', 'really', 'scenes', 'Most', 'tears', 'shed', 'were', 'quite', 'few', ""'m"", 'ultra', 'sappy', 'moviegoer', 'movie', 'right', 'were', 'doen', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'young', 'kid', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'moment', 'was', 'onscreen.So', 'there', 'go', 'See', 'kind', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'better', ""'d"", 'expect', 'given', 'premise', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'reinvention', 'wheel', 'go', 'see', 'established', 'wheels', 'spinning', 'quite', 'productively', 'passionately', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'sure']",Real Steel

Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a screw-up. He fathered a son he hasn't seen in years. He has a robot he drives around the country picking up gigs for chump change. His son's mother dies and he's happy to let boy's aunt take custody of him....for a price. Through a fluke he ends up with the boy for a few weeks. They come across an old robot which they fix up and take on tour where they proceed to climb the bot-fight ladder to the ultimate match.This is a nifty flick, but it could have been so much more with only a few minor changes. First off the is the script. I don't know that I'd change anything there. I liked it just fine. What I would change is Hugh Jackman. I just don't think he's that good. I did see him recently in &#34;The Prisoners&#34; and he was really good, but generally he has nowhere near the gravity to pull this off. I'd put in someone like Russ Crowe, Michael Fassbender or maybe Ryan Gosling. I'd also put in a different director. If you look at Shawn Levy's history, he's done all cutesy, light weight stuff. Put in Pete Travis or Alfonso Cuaron and this could have been a true powerhouse of a film. Now, being based on a kids toy from the early 60's, maybe light and cute is what the producers were going for, but I saw so much potential in making this, not just an entertaining flick, but a truly great film.Now, with over 500 reviews already logged for this movie, I'd be really surprised if anyone even reads this.

MI. It turned to be one exciting film that we both enjoyed from beginning to end.Real Steel takes place in the year 2020 where boxing is now done  by robots that fight to the death.  Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, a washed up former fighter turned robot boxing promoter that has been down on his luck for a good while.  Charlie has been trying to hit it big in robot boxing, but ends up owing large sums of money to some very dangerous people.One day he finds out that his former girlfriend has died, leaving him as the official guardian to his 11 year old son Max (played by Dakoto Goyo), who Charlie has not seen since since Max was a baby.  Max's aunt (played by Hope Davis) wants Charlie to give up custody of Max to her and her very rich husband.  And Charlie sees this situation as a way to get quick cash to buy another fighting robot so that he can get out of debt.But what Charlie does not count on is the fact that his son Max is one tough kid that shows him how to have the heart to try to win again against the odds.  And Max teaches Charlie that when you do what you love, the money will come.Real Steel is an exciting and endearing film.  Even though we all knew how the story would end, we could not help cheering for Charlie as he discovers how to finally be a dad and how to finally be a winner. And Dakoto Goyo who played Max is one awesome kid actor who made everyone in the audience fall in love with him.  My son likes his movies exciting and the fight scenes in Real Steel are in your face loud and graphic.  It was like watching a giant robot boxing video game on the movie screen.The most exciting part of the movie for me were the scenes that were filmed right here in Detroit.  Yep, this movie contains footage and aerial shots of downtown Detroit, including Cobo Hall and the GM Renaissance Center.  I was bursting with Detroit pride when I saw my city on the big screen.Just a warning to parents that this film is rated PG-13 because of the graphic boxing violence and because it contains quite a bit of adult language.If you like a real good underdog story that is funny, captivating and heartfelt, Real Steel delivers on all counts and will open in theaters nationwide of Friday, October 7th, 2011.",4,It's like watching a giant robot boxing video game on the movie screen...,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,2415,"['Monday', 'September', '28', '2011', 'son', 'were', 'invited', 'advance', 'screening', 'new', 'DreamWorks', 'Pictures', 'movie', 'Real', 'Steel', 'was', 'shown', 'Uptown', 'Palladium', 'Birmingham', 'MI', 'turned', 'be', 'one', 'exciting', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'beginning', 'end.Real', 'Steel', 'place', 'year', '2020', 'where', 'boxing', 'now', 'done', 'robots', 'fight', 'death', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Charlie', 'Kenton', 'washed', 'up', 'former', 'fighter', 'turned', 'robot', 'boxing', 'promoter', 'been', 'down', 'luck', 'good', 'while', 'Charlie', 'been', 'trying', 'hit', 'big', 'robot', 'boxing', 'up', 'owing', 'large', 'sums', 'money', 'very', 'dangerous', 'people.One', 'day', 'out', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'died', 'leaving', 'official', 'guardian', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Max', 'played', 'Dakoto', 'Goyo', 'who', 'Charlie', 'not', 'seen', 'Max', 'was', 'baby', 'Max', 'aunt', 'played', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Charlie', 'give', 'up', 'custody', 'Max', 'very', 'rich', 'husband', 'Charlie', 'situation', 'way', 'get', 'quick', 'cash', 'buy', 'fighting', 'robot', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'debt.But', 'what', 'Charlie', 'not', 'count', 'fact', 'son', 'Max', 'one', 'tough', 'kid', 'how', 'have', 'heart', 'try', 'win', 'again', 'odds', 'Max', 'teaches', 'Charlie', 'when', 'do', 'what', 'love', 'money', 'will', 'come.Real', 'Steel', 'exciting', 'endearing', 'film', 'Even', 'knew', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'end', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'cheering', 'Charlie', 'how', 'finally', 'be', 'dad', 'how', 'finally', 'be', 'winner', 'Dakoto', 'Goyo', 'who', 'played', 'Max', 'one', 'awesome', 'kid', 'actor', 'who', 'made', 'everyone', 'audience', 'fall', 'love', 'son', 'movies', 'exciting', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Real', 'Steel', 'are', 'face', 'loud', 'graphic', 'was', 'watching', 'giant', 'robot', 'boxing', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'most', 'exciting', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'right', 'here', 'Detroit', 'Yep', 'movie', 'footage', 'aerial', 'shots', 'downtown', 'Detroit', 'including', 'Cobo', 'Hall', 'GM', 'Renaissance', 'Center', 'was', 'bursting', 'Detroit', 'pride', 'when', 'saw', 'city', 'big', 'screen.Just', 'warning', 'parents', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'graphic', 'boxing', 'violence', 'quite', 'bit', 'adult', 'language.If', 'real', 'good', 'underdog', 'story', 'funny', 'captivating', 'heartfelt', 'Real', 'Steel', 'delivers', 'counts', 'will', 'open', 'theaters', 'nationwide', 'Friday', 'October', '7th', '2011']",Real Steel

Jackman was so relentlessly clueless that it was impossible to take him seriously enough for the emotional story to register.

The movie lost me near the beginning, when [* mild spoiler *] Jackman's hardships resulted from things like putting everything on the line in big robot fights and then not reading the instruction manual, or looking away from the action when a 2,000 pound bull is charging his robot in the arena. The obstacles put in Jackman's path were so predictable that there are many eye-rolling moments as the story unfolds, and the big finish was simply lacking in imagination or emotional impact.

1392114,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004A8ZWW4,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","REAL STEEL is a clever movie in that it takes a video game concept (though the idea is from a short story by Richard Matheson interpreted by Jeremy Leven, Dan Gilroy and written for the screen by John Gatins), keeps intact the videogame lovers' approach to fantasy and action, and introduces some adult versions of acting out  that make for a solid message.At first the movie seems trite - a grown man, ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman, buff, surly and in fine acting condition) buys and sells and enters robots who perform in a circus style boxing arena where years earlier real men boxed. We soon discover that this is future-set story where robot boxing is a popular sport and centered on a struggling promoter (Jackman) who thinks he's found a champion in a discarded robot. During his hopeful rise to the top, he also discovers he has an 11-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo), in the midst of a custody battle with Charlie's deceased wife's sister and husband (Hope Davis and James Rebhorn).  Charlie, ever on the outlook to pay off his debts and find financing for buying new robots to train for boxing matches,  makes a deal with the couple, and agrees to care for Max for a summer while the couple visit Europe.  Max wants to know his father but on his terms.  The two males are aided by the owner of Charlie's training gym - Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) - and it is her intervention that helps the two males join forces and become involved with a discarded robot, Atom, they make a champion by working together.The tenderness of the film takes a while to settle in, but in the end it is not easy to deny that the story of a reluctant father and a self sufficient son finding that arm platform of relationship, able to endure disappointments as well as triumphs.  Jackman and Goyo are a terrific team and the other cast members, especially  Lilly and Anthony Mackie, are solid. Shawn Levy's direction deserves credit for pulling the whole thing together. This is not just another silly CGI flick: there is a core a beauty to the film that makes it not only entertaining but heartwarming, too.

It's also an update of films like The Champ, in which a child helps a former achiever to reach again for the top, as a success and as a person.As Levy also remarks in the commentary, the choice of likable star Hugh Jackman for a role that is unlikable for a good portion of the film is a major reason for how well it succeeds. Perhaps by design, Jackman never really comes across as a believable jerk, though he is very earnest and real in the role (despite his occasional tangles between his Australian accent with a ""street tough"" American dialect). He's ably supported by Dakota Goyo as his estranged young son (a performance that could make or break the film, but it this case ""makes"" it) and Evangeline Lilly, whose relatively small role radiates immense charm and appeal.The robots and the spectacular effects are stars, of course, in this type of film, but Levy is careful to keep the real and the steel in balance. Visually, the filmmakers achieved what he calls a ""retro modern"" look in that takes place a few fictitious years from now. In order to make the robots more relatable to the actors, a combination of CG and full-size robots were created.Levy also makes great use of the Michigan locations -- very stark and Blade Runner-ish without augmentation, thanks to the highly industrial look of gigantic assembly plants and scrapyards. In an early fight sequence, hundreds of extras are seen throughout a sprawling structure that was not a special comp effect, but a real place where large automobile parts where shipped in by train.Real Steel isn't designed to be confused with The Artist.

The recurrent problem is that producers don't want intelligent, creative, thought provoking, challenging movies because they'll lose audience share which means investors won't be happy. So they have the final ""no"" if there isn't enough formula story bits and actor marketability.Thus, acting was bland, read the short lines and stand around looking photogenic. Jackman in his narcissistic body hugging t-shirts was just script acting. Lilly was totally unbelievable as a salvage robot repairman; cast only an an attractive romantic interest for Jackman. Goyo also photogenic cast for mass marketing reasons.The script writing both dialogue and scene construction were just inane, stupid, dumb. Unless your'e under the age of 13 and haven't seen more than a small number of movies by which to compare. The dialogue sounded like it came from ""The Dummies Guide to Formulaic Scriptwriting"" book. Practically every line has been heard so many times in movies you could say them before the actors. Unimaginative storyline: Son is forced to live with uncaring, never seen, dad. They form a bond based on shared fantasy of game playing. Bad Eastern European foes supported by bad Japanese techies - stereotyping! Boy finally changes dad by his more adult like behavior. Feel good happy ending.Main ethical points of the movie were:(1.) Challenging a parent for a payoff.(2.) Stealing is OK, just be sneaky about it.(3.) Fighting is OK, as long as you win.(4.) Winning, usually at whatever the cost, is what's important.

Turns out, it IS a rock 'em sock 'em robot punching flick, but it is awesome. Enough human elements are introduced to ground the wackadoo premise. Atom, the underdog boxing robot, works on your bump of sympathy, sneaks past your defenses, clocks you with its unexpected soulfulness. Yes, I am anthropomorphising an inanimate object, but that is one damn evocative boxing robot.In the near future, the Sweet Science has replaced its human pugilists with metal robots, robots being more durable and destructive and therefore more likely to sate our cravings for carnage and claret.

Charlie Kenton's line of debt continues to mount because an impulsive character like Charlie can't be bothered to think things thru and he usually ends up with his nads in a sling. Fleeing another incurred debt, Charlie learns of an old girlfriend's passing and, even more relevant, that this leaves him possibly stuck with their eleven-year-old kid Max. It's a measure of Hugh Jackman's appeal that you still find him likable even though his role calls for his being a shirker, a welcher, and an absentee father. The film, naturally, gives him opportunities for redemption, and Jackman makes it work. But, don't get it twisted, no one sells the heel-to-hero journey quite as grandly as Tom Cruise.Because of this and that, Charlie Kenton ends up taking his estranged, suspicious son on the road, and Max turns out to be an avid robot boxing fan. Crummy luck or sheer inept boxing strategizing has caused Charlie's robots to succumb to getting their metal mugs caved in. One night, during an illegal run thru a metal scrap yard (in search of enough parts to construct another fight 'bot), Charlie and Max stumble upon a buried robot, an old and smaller model named Atom. Max promptly adopts it like it's a pet. It's apropos; thematically, REAL STEEL exudes a huge whiff of ""a boy and his dog.""Atom is a relic, an old Generation II model, a lowly sparring 'bot. It's able to absorb massive doses of punishment but isn't much in the way of an offensive arsenal. What it does have is a rare ""shadow"" function which allows it to mimic Charlie's boxing moves... and Max's dancing. Yes, boxing DANCING robots!! Take that, Bumblebee!This kid, Dakota Goyo, who plays Max, bursts out of nowhere and makes an impact with his good acting and savvy and moxie. Max is a spirited kid who won't back down, and I found myself admiring him as the grown-up in this father-and-son pair. And I dare you not to think it adorable when you watch Max and his robot bust out their dance routine during their ring walk. If you've seen your share of sports movies then the story thread hits familiar beats. But it's easy to yield to the underdog theme. Atom is clearly smaller and not as sleek and less powerful than the monster robots he faces in the ring. The fights are rousing. Metal smashing metal, servos and gears and widgets and other metallic whatnot sent hurtling willy-nilly. Maybe it helped that Sugar Ray Leonard was consulted for the fight choreography. Atom certainly exhibited some slick moves. I know the theater audience was frequently vocal and involved and cheering. We track Atom's rise in the pugilistic ranks as he gains street creds and word of mouth pub. It's not long before he cracks the World Robot Boxing scene and set to take on the mighty Zeus, the greatest robot boxer of all time.Throw in an Evangeline Lilly who makes the most of her limited role as the romantic interest, and what we have is a movie that doesn't lack for warmth and heart and surprising emotional content. REAL STEEL caters towards them kids, but there's also enough here for grown-ups to savor. The robots, whether animated thru CG or animatronics, are flawlessly rendered. I hear there's already a sequel in the works. Good. Maybe then they'll address the topic of Atom's sentience which was sort of hinted at but then promptly dropped.

I'll watch this again and probably like it more on Dvd when comes out. Not to say I didnt like it, but also just saw ""Warrior"" recently, both fighting movies and both movies dealing w/family struggles, but ""Warrior"" comes out the winner on soooo  many differnt fronts. But Real Steels fighting was great and the soundtrack absolutely ROCKED, espcially if you like Electronic/hip hop/rock all rolled into one...check it out. That said, it had great moments and then went down a little and slowed down a little, picked back up, went down a little, picked back up and went down a little. Then had a fantastic fight in the final battle. Again, the action w/ the robots blew away anything Michael Bay tried to do w/ Transformers. You could actually see who was fighting who, logically figure out what what happening and still enjoy the action. Well done.

I have no interest in the Rocky franchise. Still, what harm was there in renting it? My opinion now hurts.Charlie Kenton is a ""has-been,"" no longer able to catch up to his past debts. But that's not the only reason he no longer holds robot fights. That, along with a custody battle for his young, estranged son, sets off a small series of events that help bring him back up to the world of robot fights. Especially with how the robot he's using, ""Atom,"" is a first-generation fighter with a couple features that help the fight progression keep level.At first, like in the show Spartacus, Charlie has to go through underground, dirty-style fighting rings. Beyond that, he's also getting to know his son, who has a very good, working knowledge on the history of robot fighting.On the angles: even though Evangeline Lily's character, Bailey Tallet, is considered, from the amazon.com review, to be the perfunctory love interest, I did not catch a strong ""love interest"" angle through the movie. Maybe hints of attraction, but nothing that forces the film away from the action, nor the drama that drives the scenes. Then there's the ""underdog"" subtheme, showing how a little kid, with a huge heart, can have people's attention and seriously peeve off the big-corporate people (how he stands up to the Japanese boss and his assistance with his outright gall actually had me cheering, something I normally don't do for a movie). It didn't feel off-setting for this movie. Instead, it felt contextually appropriate for that to be here. It also felt appropriate for the kid, young and highly rambunctious and extremely energetic, to have the most energy in his acting for this film. Jackman's character is also rambunctious, but appropriately less-than for an adult. Lily' character is more of a grounding character so the guys don't get too wild and set everyone in a good background check, of sorts.Durand does a decent presentation of a man seeking his money from the man who owes him a debt (even if he has to be a typical southern-style loan shark), and Yune's character is both serious and seriously comical (particularly with how his machine's defeated and how he reacts to it, it made me crack up pretty good).So, all-in-all, this was a surprisingly good film to watch, with a breakout performance by a new actor, memorable performances by veteran actors and actresses, great special effects, a nice storyline to keep things going, and truly excellent fight scenes with each robot (and humans), along with good dashes of subtle humor to keep it grounded and not so bland with testosterone.Now for the hard part: waiting for the sequel to come out.",5,Junkyard beginnings,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2741,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'commercials', 'saw', 'was', 'compared', 'Rocky', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'have', 'interest', 'Rocky', 'franchise', 'Still', 'what', 'harm', 'was', 'there', 'renting', 'opinion', 'now', 'Kenton', 'has-been', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'catch', 'up', 'past', 'debts', 'not', 'only', 'reason', 'no', 'longer', 'robot', 'fights', 'custody', 'battle', 'young', 'estranged', 'son', 'off', 'small', 'series', 'events', 'help', 'bring', 'back', 'world', 'robot', 'fights', 'Especially', 'how', 'robot', 'using', 'Atom', 'first-generation', 'fighter', 'couple', 'help', 'fight', 'progression', 'keep', 'level.At', 'first', 'show', 'Spartacus', 'Charlie', 'go', 'underground', 'dirty-style', 'fighting', 'rings', 'Beyond', 'also', 'getting', 'know', 'son', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'working', 'knowledge', 'history', 'robot', 'fighting.On', 'angles', 'even', 'Evangeline', 'Lily', 'character', 'Bailey', 'Tallet', 'considered', 'amazon.com', 'review', 'be', 'perfunctory', 'love', 'interest', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'strong', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'hints', 'attraction', 'nothing', 'film', 'away', 'action', 'drama', 'scenes', 'Then', 'underdog', 'subtheme', 'showing', 'how', 'little', 'kid', 'huge', 'heart', 'can', 'have', 'people', 'attention', 'seriously', 'peeve', 'off', 'big-corporate', 'people', 'how', 'up', 'Japanese', 'boss', 'assistance', 'outright', 'gall', 'actually', 'had', 'cheering', 'something', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'off-setting', 'movie', 'Instead', 'felt', 'contextually', 'appropriate', 'be', 'here', 'also', 'felt', 'appropriate', 'kid', 'young', 'highly', 'rambunctious', 'extremely', 'energetic', 'have', 'most', 'energy', 'acting', 'film', 'Jackman', 'character', 'also', 'rambunctious', 'appropriately', 'less-than', 'adult', 'Lily', 'character', 'more', 'grounding', 'character', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'wild', 'set', 'everyone', 'good', 'background', 'check', 'sorts.Durand', 'decent', 'presentation', 'man', 'seeking', 'money', 'man', 'who', 'debt', 'even', 'be', 'typical', 'southern-style', 'loan', 'shark', 'Yune', 'character', 'serious', 'seriously', 'comical', 'particularly', 'how', 'machine', 'defeated', 'how', 'made', 'crack', 'up', 'pretty', 'good', '.So', 'all-in-all', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'breakout', 'performance', 'new', 'actor', 'memorable', 'performances', 'veteran', 'actors', 'actresses', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'nice', 'storyline', 'keep', 'things', 'going', 'truly', 'excellent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'robot', 'humans', 'good', 'dashes', 'subtle', 'humor', 'keep', 'grounded', 'not', 'so', 'bland', 'testosterone.Now', 'hard', 'part', 'waiting', 'sequel', 'come', 'out']",Real Steel
1392129,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B004A8ZWW4,Jason,"[2, 4]","There is no doubt this movie is relatively entertaining on purely robot fights, but there are plenty of reasons why it's not a 5-star movie.Based in the ""near"" future, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a former fighter who uses the majority of his resources in life fueling his problems as a degenerate gambler with ADHD (either that, or he cares not to watch his fights or read instruction manuals).  Charlie nickels and dimes his way through life, shunning responsibility in favor of the next robot fight he'll bet upon and inevitably lose.  Along comes his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) and a heaping dose of Deus ex machine to save the day.  In no time at all they steal a decommissioned sparring robot that, through the gee-whiz engineering prowess of a wunderkind 11 year old, is suddenly knocking on the door of the championships with only a few fights on record.  Will they win?  Will Charlie and his son reconcile?  Anyone who has seenOver the Topshould know the answers already, and, like me, should start calling the movie Reel Steal.Underdog vs. champion movies work really well.  Mixed with sports they work even better.  But if we learned anything from The Blind Side, irritating children who command far too much screen time do not work all that well.  The script is clich&eacute;-ridden, and Goyo is irritating beyond belief  Seriously, he's ""Hmong actors inGran Torino""-horrible.  Nearly ruined, Real Steel's FX rises above Goyo's hip-hop Anakin portrayal and provides a bunch of seamless, metal crunching battle scenes.  Had this movie just stuck to the futuristicRock 'Em Sock 'Em ROBOTSroutine, it would have worked much better.  As it stands, however, sentimentality was thrown in, with a kid and father who never actually acknowledge one another other than business partners, and a third wheel (Evangeline Lilly) who was so cursory she probably got paid in game room tokens.Kids will enjoy the entire movie.  Discerning viewers will nit-pick the very corny melodrama, lack of character development, and mixed messages (seriously, the dude actively commits grand larceny with his kid).

Of course not, but with all the garbage that comes out these days, this movie was a pleasant surprise.Its story is made up of, or reminds you of, other movies you may have seen. Rocky, Transformers, and Over The Top are the ones that stand out for me. Overall, it works. A problem I have with many movies these days is a difficulty feeling any connection to whats going on or major characters. There are plot holes, things move to fast, or it just doesn't work. Real Steel is able to have fun with the fighting robots while also having a story between a father and son, and both sides of the movie come together to make what ends up being a decent movie.You really dislike Hugh Jackman early in the film. He is basically a scumbag and deadbeat dad. Though they don't go into too much detail through out the film, you can tell part of why he has become this way is because he was a pretty good boxer in the past and was replaced by these robots which made him obsolete. I really was getting into the fight scenes and they were done in the Rocky way, which means you are almost cheering from your seat for the good guy to win in the end.Overall there's not much I can say against this movie. It gets a little dull a couple of times earlier in the movie, and a couple of the minor parts in the movie were not really necessary, but the negative reviews for this movie really make no sense to me.

A washed up boxer, Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is trying to make a living on the road fighting and sponsoring his own robot.  Living on a shoestring, Charlie owes money to everyone he knows. He was a contender who had some great fights but he never got the chance to finish as robot boxing took over and became more popular with the people because it usually is a fight to the finish.Charlie winds up losing all of his money, his fighting robot is destroyed and he is desperate to stay in the game.  Charlie's ex-girlfriend that was raising his son dies unexpectedly and Charlie is now faced with trying to raise a son he doesn't even know.  He sees his son as a burden to have on the road.  Max, the son (Dakota Goyo) is just like his dad, stubborn, arrogant and smart.They are reluctantly teamed up to find a robot and tour the low end of the fighting circuit.  They assemble a robot from junk yard parts and pieces of Charlie's old robots and come up with a winner.  This movie is about a robot and a young boy seemingly becoming friends while a father and son get to know each other and bond together as family.This is a great movie with a lot of action and good fight scenes.

He's down on himself so much that he won't even tolerate hearing accolades of his past triumphs.  Charlie pushes everyone away so far and hard that he can't even remember how old his own son is (who is 11).The ultimate scumbag, Charlie sells custody of his son (Max, played by Dakota Goya; Thor).  But to collect, he must spend the summer with him.  He uses the $50K custodial bounty to buy an ex-pro robot boxer to pit in a dirty underground fight. Guess how that turns out for this winner?Charlie teaches Max about haste, greed, theft, and the history of sport-fighting that led to the robot boxing sensation.  Max, a fan of robot boxing, teaches him how to dream with his devout support of an obsolete model junkyard robot.  Because Max won't let up, Charlie has no choice but to submit and teach him about the sport.  ""You've played video games, right?  Well this is just like that.  Except that this one's a 1000 pound robot.""  Atom, as Max names him, is a sparring bot that mirrors fighting styles.  Atom is under-sized, fast and designed to take hits, not deliver them.  Charlie has doubts.  Max has dreams.  And Atom is special.Charlie teaches Max what the audience wants and trains the bot to box.  Max works up a mean robot shadow-dancing routine to give Atom a persona.  Atom serves as a friend to the boy and an inspiration to both of them.  This makes Charlie smile for reasons beyond money.  When he sees Max win with Atom, it's as if Charlie begins to think he can, too.  They quickly beat some big names and make one for themselves and go pro aiming for Zeus, the pro-champ and an evolving, fully autonomous robot.  How do you beat that?For the boxing enthusiasts out there, Sugar Ray Leonard sets up an original rope-a-dope for our junkyard scrapper in honor of Muhammad Ali.

1392161,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B004A8ZWW4,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","When I first saw previews for this movie, my first thought was ""Hey, they finally made a movie out of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots game.""  Silly, I know, but in this day and age where they can make a successful film franchise out of a toy line (the ""Transformers"" films) and a Disneyland ride (the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films), then why not a game?  It could work if they have the right people behind it, right?  (This was before the bomb that was ""Battleship"" came out, mind you...)Unlike the aforementioned ""Battleship"" movie, however, ""Real Steel"" is a wonderful movie.  It's not a heavy science-fiction film, or really even an action film despite featuring fighting robots.  It's a film with heart behind its metallic brawn, and even though the robots get plenty of screen time it's the human element that makes this film shine.Based loosely on a Richard Matheson short story, ""Real Steel"" follows Charlie, a washed-up former boxing champ turned fighting-robot manager who's deeply in debt and has just lost his last fighting robot in a particularly brutal match.  He finds himself a reluctant caretaker to his estranged son, Max, and ends up taking the boy with him as he travels the country, trying to scrape together funds to buy or build a new robot and pay his debts.  When Max comes across an outdated sparring bot abandoned in a junkyard and decides to restore it and fight it, Charlie is skeptical... but Atom, Max's bot, turns out to be far tougher than anyone realizes, and soon Atom becomes a sensation in the underground fighting league.  And it may be Atom that ends up drawing father and son together.The plot of this movie is fairly predictable -- you've probably seen it in a hundred sports movies before and are likely to see it again.  But that doesn't mean the plot doesn't work here.  The premise of a near-future where robots do the fighting in the boxing ring adds a fresh twist to the plot, and the characters bring a lot of heart to their roles.  Hugh Jackman proves to be a versatile, phenomenal actor, and brings a gruff pathos to his role as Charlie.  Max starts off as the typical whiny child, but develops into a likable and spunky kid as the movie progresses.  The ""villains"" of this film (the creator and manager of the champion fighting bot Zeus, and a borderline-sadistic promoter to whom Charlie owes money) are fairly one-note and flat, but that just makes it all the more satisfying when they get their just dues.  And Atom, despite being mute and personality-less throughout the film, somehow manages to win the viewers heart as well -- who doesn't like an underdog story, and want to see the little guy win?The visual effects in this film are phenomenal as well.  The film is portrayed as a ""near-future"" where many elements are similar, but the robots don't come across as a jarring addition.  At times it's easy to forget one is watching CGI effects and not actual machinery, and each of the fighting bots has its own unique look.  It makes me wish this movie had come with a decent toy line, because I know I would buy myself a miniature version of Atom or Noisy Boy if I could.  Oddly enough, the most jarring ""special effects failure"" in the film comes from the fight in the opening scene, where a fighting robot takes on a bull -- it's quite easy to tell when they stop using an actual animal and start using a CGI dummy.  But then, visual effects haven't come far enough to produce animals that don't look fake, I suppose...This film has been described as ""Rocky with robots,"" and I have to say it's an accurate description.  It has a LOT of heart, great acting, and a story that has been told many times but manages to not be stale or cheesy here.  Even if you're not a sci-fi fan, I'd give this movie a look -- it's a good heartwarming film, and the robots are just the cherry on top for me.Recommended for ages 10 and up, due to language and violence.",5,Rocky meets Transformers -- a robot movie with a lot of heart,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,3908,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Hey', 'finally', 'made', 'movie', 'Rock', ""'Em"", 'Sock', ""'Em"", 'Robots', 'game', 'Silly', 'know', 'day', 'age', 'where', 'can', 'make', 'successful', 'film', 'franchise', 'toy', 'line', 'Transformers', 'films', 'Disneyland', 'ride', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'films', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'game', 'could', 'work', 'have', 'right', 'people', 'right', 'was', 'bomb', 'was', 'Battleship', 'came', 'out', 'mind', 'aforementioned', 'Battleship', 'movie', 'however', 'Real', 'Steel', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'not', 'heavy', 'science-fiction', 'film', 'really', 'even', 'action', 'film', 'featuring', 'fighting', 'robots', 'film', 'heart', 'metallic', 'brawn', 'even', 'robots', 'get', 'plenty', 'screen', 'time', 'human', 'element', 'film', 'shine.Based', 'loosely', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'short', 'story', 'Real', 'Steel', 'Charlie', 'washed-up', 'former', 'boxing', 'champ', 'turned', 'fighting-robot', 'manager', 'who', 'deeply', 'debt', 'just', 'lost', 'last', 'fighting', 'robot', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'match', 'reluctant', 'caretaker', 'estranged', 'son', 'Max', 'up', 'taking', 'boy', 'country', 'trying', 'scrape', 'together', 'funds', 'buy', 'build', 'new', 'robot', 'pay', 'debts', 'When', 'Max', 'outdated', 'sparring', 'bot', 'abandoned', 'junkyard', 'decides', 'restore', 'fight', 'Charlie', 'skeptical', 'Atom', 'Max', 'bot', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'tougher', 'anyone', 'realizes', 'soon', 'Atom', 'sensation', 'underground', 'fighting', 'league', 'may', 'be', 'Atom', 'up', 'drawing', 'father', 'son', 'together.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'fairly', 'predictable', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'hundred', 'sports', 'movies', 'are', 'likely', 'see', 'again', ""n't"", 'mean', 'plot', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'premise', 'near-future', 'where', 'robots', 'do', 'fighting', 'boxing', 'ring', 'fresh', 'twist', 'plot', 'characters', 'bring', 'lot', 'heart', 'roles', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'be', 'versatile', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'gruff', 'pathos', 'role', 'Charlie', 'Max', 'typical', 'whiny', 'child', 'likable', 'spunky', 'kid', 'movie', 'villains', 'film', 'creator', 'manager', 'champion', 'fighting', 'bot', 'Zeus', 'borderline-sadistic', 'promoter', 'whom', 'Charlie', 'money', 'are', 'fairly', 'one-note', 'flat', 'just', 'more', 'satisfying', 'when', 'get', 'just', 'dues', 'Atom', 'being', 'mute', 'personality-less', 'film', 'somehow', 'manages', 'win', 'viewers', 'heart', 'well', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'underdog', 'story', 'want', 'see', 'little', 'guy', 'win', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'well', 'film', 'portrayed', 'near-future', 'where', 'many', 'elements', 'are', 'similar', 'robots', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'jarring', 'addition', 'times', 'easy', 'forget', 'one', 'watching', 'CGI', 'effects', 'not', 'actual', 'machinery', 'fighting', 'bots', 'own', 'unique', 'look', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'come', 'decent', 'toy', 'line', 'know', 'would', 'buy', 'miniature', 'version', 'Atom', 'Noisy', 'Boy', 'could', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'most', 'jarring', 'special', 'effects', 'failure', 'film', 'fight', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'fighting', 'robot', 'bull', 'quite', 'easy', 'tell', 'when', 'stop', 'using', 'actual', 'animal', 'start', 'using', 'CGI', 'dummy', 'then', 'visual', 'effects', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'far', 'enough', 'produce', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'fake', 'suppose', 'film', 'been', 'described', 'Rocky', 'robots', 'have', 'say', 'accurate', 'description', 'LOT', 'heart', 'great', 'acting', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'manages', 'not', 'be', 'stale', 'cheesy', 'here', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'sci-fi', 'fan', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'look', 'good', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'robots', 'are', 'just', 'cherry', 'top', 'me.Recommended', 'ages', '10', 'up', 'due', 'language', 'violence']",Real Steel

This is a 5-star fantastic, funtastic, futuristic movie with a lovely human redemptive plot that gives it focus, meaning and purpose.  It is easy to imagine this becoming a mind-bending rock'em sock'em robot comupter-generated sci-fi geek movie.  But it's not; in fact, it is far from it!  What it is, is a love story that happens to involve fighting robots, and the love story is multi-level and done so well that you'd best have that proverbial box of tissues with you. I guarantee your eyes will water as this film lands a kcockout blow to your heart.Mix 1979's ""The Champ"" (relationship of Ricky Schroder and Jon Voight) with 1976's ""Rocky"" (relationship of Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire) and throw in some Rock'em Sock'em robots, and you have a story that will sweep your tech imagination away, while at the same time delivering devastating uppercuts to your heart.I usually do not praise too many movies enthusiastically, but I can't praise this movie enough for scoring one KO after another in terms of acting, casting, script, screenplay, music, drama, and climactic ending.  It's all here, and it leaves you wanting more as the credits roll.The film centers around the evolving relationship between absentee, deadbeat, scam-artist father, Charlie (Hugh Jackman) and betrayed and emotionally distant son Max (Dakota Goyo). Charlie used to be top-ranked boxer and a man people respected, but he lost his self-respect, lost his marriage, lost his only son, and as the movie begins, he is one short step ahead of several loan sharks wanting their money. Charlie's a loser with a capital ""L"".  He is still in the fight game, but now boxing involves robots, and Charlie's robots are as junky as he is.  But then fate steps in in the form of his long-lost son, Max, and a new robot called Atom.  Suddenly, the equation of loss that is Charlie's life changes, and the question then becomes one of redemption, not only for Charlie himself, but also for Max and Charlie's girlfriend, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly).  Can Charlie  find the inspiration to fight to save himself, his son, and his future, or will he once again weasle away and and throw everyone under the bus in the process?  No spoilers here!  You have to see this for yourself, and in the process, you will remember this film for a long time to come.  Like me, you will be cheering in the final moments of the film, not only for Atom the robot, who is fighting against virtually insurmountable odds, but also for Charlie, who is fighting against pretty steep odds himself.This film is not deep.  It probably won't win any Academy awards, but it might just win your heart.Rated PG-13 (language).kone",4,Real Steel Delivers a Knockout to the Heart,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,2702,"['Folks', 'Real', 'Steel', 'real', 'deal', '5-star', 'fantastic', 'funtastic', 'futuristic', 'movie', 'lovely', 'human', 'redemptive', 'plot', 'focus', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'easy', 'imagine', 'becoming', 'mind-bending', ""rock'em"", ""sock'em"", 'robot', 'comupter-generated', 'sci-fi', 'geek', 'movie', 'not', 'fact', 'far', 'What', 'love', 'story', 'involve', 'fighting', 'robots', 'love', 'story', 'multi-level', 'done', 'so', 'well', ""'d"", 'best', 'have', 'proverbial', 'box', 'tissues', 'guarantee', 'eyes', 'will', 'water', 'film', 'kcockout', 'blow', 'heart.Mix', '1979', 'Champ', 'relationship', 'Ricky', 'Schroder', 'Jon', 'Voight', '1976', 'Rocky', 'relationship', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'throw', ""Rock'em"", ""Sock'em"", 'robots', 'have', 'story', 'will', 'sweep', 'tech', 'imagination', 'away', 'same', 'time', 'delivering', 'devastating', 'uppercuts', 'heart.I', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'praise', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'enthusiastically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'movie', 'enough', 'scoring', 'one', 'KO', 'terms', 'acting', 'casting', 'script', 'screenplay', 'music', 'drama', 'climactic', 'ending', 'here', 'wanting', 'more', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'film', 'centers', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'absentee', 'deadbeat', 'scam-artist', 'father', 'Charlie', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'betrayed', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'son', 'Max', 'Dakota', 'Goyo', 'Charlie', 'used', 'be', 'top-ranked', 'boxer', 'man', 'people', 'respected', 'lost', 'self-respect', 'lost', 'marriage', 'lost', 'only', 'son', 'movie', 'one', 'short', 'step', 'ahead', 'several', 'loan', 'sharks', 'wanting', 'money', 'Charlie', 'loser', 'capital', 'L', 'still', 'fight', 'game', 'now', 'boxing', 'involves', 'robots', 'Charlie', 'robots', 'are', 'as', 'junky', 'then', 'fate', 'steps', 'form', 'long-lost', 'son', 'Max', 'new', 'robot', 'called', 'Atom', 'Suddenly', 'equation', 'loss', 'Charlie', 'life', 'changes', 'question', 'then', 'one', 'redemption', 'not', 'only', 'Charlie', 'also', 'Max', 'Charlie', 'girlfriend', 'Bailey', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Can', 'Charlie', 'find', 'inspiration', 'fight', 'save', 'son', 'future', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'weasle', 'away', 'throw', 'everyone', 'bus', 'process', 'No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'have', 'see', 'process', 'will', 'remember', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'will', 'be', 'cheering', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'Atom', 'robot', 'who', 'fighting', 'virtually', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'also', 'Charlie', 'who', 'fighting', 'pretty', 'steep', 'odds', 'himself.This', 'film', 'not', 'deep', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Academy', 'awards', 'might', 'just', 'win', 'heart.Rated', 'PG-13', 'language', '.kone']",Real Steel

This is how the story goes: In the near-future, where the sport of boxing has gone hi-tech, Charlie Kenton is a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring. Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback.The cast led by Hugh Jackman (as Charlie) is great. The directing by Shawn Levy (who also produced) is great. The story by Dan Gilroy & Jeremy Leven & the screenplay by John Gatins is great.The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore is great. The film editing by Dean Zimmerman is great. The casting by Richard Hicks & David Rubin is great. The production design by Tom Meyer is great.

Now he operates a giant robot in the new boxing ring. Unfortunately, he's a lousy human being. He's fathered a kid but cares nothing for his offspring. His main concern is making money with the bots.When he's called to court for a custody hearing, Jackman makes a deal in order to ""watch"" his son for the summer for a large sum of money. (He's the cliched low-life.)During the summer, father and son find and update an old sparring robot in order for it to fight in the arenas. This bot was created to take a beating and in this way is very much the robotic version of the Italian Stallion.The film tries very hard to get you to believe this robot is alive, having it stare into a mirror and shadow box with the boy, but we're lucky in that they kept it lifeless. It's just a robot but people still cringe when the punches are delivered.Young boys will love the boxing robots and the high-octane music while their moms will enjoy seeing Hugh Jackman become a better man.Seriously, Jackman is the reason this movie is so good.

Oleson,"[2, 4]","The filmmakers hit their target audience with this fight themed drama about a washed up boxer (Hugh Jackman) who is now heavily invested in robot fighting which is now all the rage in a near future America.  Unfortunately, Charlie (Jackman) must have taken too many hits to the head as he makes ridiculous bets with guys who insist on getting their money now when they win.  What a concept.  Charlie finds out that a former flame has died - his reaction, OK - and that he now has custody of a son aged somewhere between 8 and 11.  He's really not sure.  Max (Dakota Goyo) has an aunt who wants to adopt him.  Charlie agrees but not until he bribes the aunt's rich husband for $50K.  That's enough to get another fighting robot.Charlie agrees to take Max for the summer, and then turn him over to his aunt.  Max knows nothing about this of course.  Max becomes an asset because he knows his roboboxing.  They find a discarded sparring robot at a junk yard and clean him up.  What do ya' know.  He starts to win.  I'm about as bored writing this plot as the film often becomes.  Every match outcome is easily predicted.  We know that the reluctant father and the lonely boy will bond.  We know Charlie will reconcile with his current girlfriend (an underutilized Evangeline Lilly).  If you've ever seen ""Rocky"" or the new ""Warrior"" or the old animated ""Iron Giant"", then you've probably seen this one too.It really isn't all that bad however.

I left pleasantly surprised...It's set in the near future where boxing and even mixed martial arts doesn't display enough carnage for audiences. They turn to 8 foot robots controlled by human ""trainers"" to get their fix. Hugh Jackman turns in one of his best non-Wolverine performances as a no good father and former boxer who now uses fighting robots to make (or in his case lose) money. He chooses to sell his son, left alone after his mother died, for $100,000 to the boy's Aunt and Uncle. But first he has to spend a couple of months with him while the boy's future guardians are in Europe. It turns out that his 11-year-old knows even more than he does about robotic fighting. They end up stumbling upon an older model bot (named Atom) in a junk yard and from there they begin to train it and almost in Rocky like fashion Atom becomes a crowd favorite and gets a shot at the title. I thought the boy actor was excellent as well. He had a lot of attitude, but he never got annoying. Evangeline Lilly of Lost fame is here to showcase her beautiful face, but doesn't get much more to do than be a love interest for Jackman's character.The CGI is great. Unlike most scenes in the Transformers movies, you can actually tell the robots apart and the action is easy to follow.Sure it has the usual corny moments and the giant robots fighting in a ring sometimes comes off silly, but I really enjoyed Real Steel. It sometimes feels like an emotional family film about the relationship between a boy and his father, but it doesn't get too sappy and there is plenty of action to balance out all of the feel good stuff.

My son, who is about the same age as the boy in the film, really enjoyed it.Real Steel is about a washed up loser named Wolverine who decides to fight robots after getting kicked out of the X-Men.  Well... maybe that's not entirely accurate, but the dude is a washed up loser nonetheless.  The guy fights robots for a living, but hits a bit of a hurdle when a girl that he knocked up dies and he gets temporary custody of the kid.One thing the guy has going for him is his pseudo girlfriend - I think she was lost on some island or something before making it back to civilization to date losers who fight robots.  Well... regardless of her origins, she likes filthy dudes who gamble and make poor life decisions.Sooo... to make a long story short, the kid finds an old sparing robot named ""Atom"" (get it, Adam?) buried in a junk heap, fixes it up, and takes to the robot fighting circuit.  Etc, etc, etc.Hey - is it just me or do some of the fight scenes - especially in the last fight with Zeus, mimic Rocky fights?  I swear I was watching Rocky with robots.  I'm not saying it was just close either... I'm talking nearly identical.  I bet you could do a side-by-side comparison and track some of the same moves.Oh - and did anyone else get the impression that perhaps the sparing robot was actually designed by that crazy Asian engineer who designed Zeus?  Recall that he gets asked if Zeus was his best creation and he avoids the question.  Also recall that the owner of Zeus wants to buy Atom - for no reason really.  Also recall that the Asian engineer is always casting worried looks around when he see Atom.  Why?  The movie never actually explains this.  Seems to me like there was a sub-plot that got left out.In terms of special effects, the robots look pretty good.  Frankly, the Transformer movies should have done something a little more like Real Steel.  The fighting robots look ""feasible"" whereas the Transformers look like a bunch of CGI nonsense.The end result is a movie in which basically everything is predictable - including the end if you have seen Rocky.  However, I don't think that detracted from the film.  My son really liked it and he is in the demographic this film is shooting for.You, of course, know that my taste is impeccable and you live your life based on my reviews.  If you don't, then you better start!  Therefore, you can feel safe watching this film.  4 stars.  Never throw around 5 stars lightly.  I'd probably give it 3 stars based on just my unquestionable taste, but I'm bumping it to 4 because of my son's fondness for the film",4,Worth it,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,2644,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'My', 'son', 'who', 'same', 'age', 'boy', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.Real', 'Steel', 'washed', 'up', 'loser', 'named', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'fight', 'robots', 'getting', 'kicked', 'X-Men', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'dude', 'washed', 'up', 'loser', 'nonetheless', 'guy', 'fights', 'robots', 'living', 'bit', 'hurdle', 'when', 'girl', 'knocked', 'up', 'dies', 'temporary', 'custody', 'kid.One', 'thing', 'guy', 'going', 'pseudo', 'girlfriend', 'think', 'was', 'lost', 'island', 'something', 'making', 'back', 'civilization', 'date', 'losers', 'who', 'fight', 'robots', 'Well', 'regardless', 'origins', 'filthy', 'dudes', 'who', 'gamble', 'make', 'poor', 'life', 'decisions.Sooo', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'kid', 'old', 'sparing', 'robot', 'named', 'Atom', 'get', 'Adam', 'buried', 'junk', 'heap', 'fixes', 'up', 'robot', 'fighting', 'circuit', 'Etc', 'etc', 'etc.Hey', 'just', 'do', 'fight', 'especially', 'last', 'fight', 'Zeus', 'mimic', 'Rocky', 'fights', 'swear', 'was', 'watching', 'Rocky', 'robots', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'just', 'close', ""'m"", 'talking', 'nearly', 'identical', 'bet', 'could', 'do', 'side-by-side', 'comparison', 'track', 'same', 'moves.Oh', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'get', 'impression', 'perhaps', 'sparing', 'robot', 'was', 'actually', 'designed', 'crazy', 'Asian', 'engineer', 'who', 'designed', 'Zeus', 'Recall', 'asked', 'Zeus', 'was', 'best', 'creation', 'question', 'Also', 'recall', 'owner', 'Zeus', 'buy', 'Atom', 'reason', 'really', 'Also', 'recall', 'Asian', 'engineer', 'always', 'casting', 'worried', 'looks', 'when', 'see', 'Atom', 'Why', 'movie', 'never', 'actually', 'was', 'sub-plot', 'got', 'left', 'out.In', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'robots', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'Frankly', 'Transformer', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'Real', 'Steel', 'fighting', 'robots', 'look', 'feasible', 'Transformers', 'look', 'bunch', 'CGI', 'nonsense.The', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'basically', 'everything', 'predictable', 'including', 'end', 'have', 'seen', 'Rocky', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'detracted', 'film', 'son', 'really', 'liked', 'demographic', 'film', 'shooting', 'for.You', 'course', 'know', 'taste', 'impeccable', 'live', 'life', 'based', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', 'better', 'start', 'Therefore', 'can', 'feel', 'safe', 'watching', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'Never', 'throw', 'around', '5', 'stars', 'lightly', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'based', 'just', 'unquestionable', 'taste', ""'m"", 'bumping', '4', 'son', 'fondness', 'film']",Real Steel

1392215,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B004A8ZWW4,Nathan T.,"[2, 6]","I did enjoy the movie. However, I can confidently say that it's not seriously that great of a movie for a few reasons and I'll just go straight to the point:1. Obvious, predictable, overused underdog story. It's predictable and a movie about boxing or even a movie about fighting using the underdog raising above the challenge is overused. The story contained little twist of any type to make you second guess the upcoming events.2. A minor complaint but I enjoy the kid (Dakota Goyo) who reminds me of the little adorable kid in Star Wars episode 1 (Jake Lloyd). There was the scene where he was screaming on the mic in my opinion sounded obnoxious and made him seem like an overconfident noisy brat. I was not fond of the way he yells into the mic, wished it was done a bit differently. Minor complaint but a complaint, whether you see it or not.3. I feel a bit bad for Aunt Debra, who tries to adopt him, and the way he treats her like she's the bad person. She seemed very nice in the movie and the boy treats her or rather gives the impression of a high degree of dislike that I don't really understand and disapprove of. He should have been more nice and explained to her why he want to follow his dad instead of the way he reacted.4. The fight scenes were...well...they're nice but again predictable and it's more of a ""I've seen this before"" only this time with robots. The fights scenes were the typical nature of an underdog story. There's nothing new to see, rather it's sad to say that the movie doesn't even add in any new element to boxing. The robots don't have any special ""robotic"" movies, it's just boring o' boxing but with robots.It's a nice movie, but no way a five stars movie. Fun, but nothing's note worthy, from the drama scenes involving the dad and the son to the fight scenes involving the robots, nothing was exceptional. Definitely not a great movie, just fun to watch. Is it a keeper? Yeah sure, but nothing memorable like ""oh man do you remember that scene where...?"" or ""oh, I can't wait till they get to the part where...""And to the reviewers calling this film ""brilliant"" and so forth....you're exactly the type of people the movie industry wants.

1392223,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B004A8ZWW4,Only-A-Child,"[0, 1]","""Real Steel"" (2011) is a considerably above average example of what I call the ""CGI laser light show"" movie genre, much better than most (insert ""Sucker Punch"" here). Think ""The Champ"" (1931) with elements from ""Transformers"" (2004), ""Rocky"" (the 1976 original), and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991).At its core it is another redemption tale as aging boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) gets a chance to be a father to the now eleven year-old son he abandoned at birth (Max Kenton - nicely played by Dakota Goyo).  Charlie is informed that his ex-wife has died and he leaps at the chance to cut a deal with his wealthy sister-in-law to give her custody of the boy.  But through a series of somewhat contrived events the jaded Charlie ends up with Max for the first summer.The secret to this type of fairy tale lies in how well they connect with viewers; if the movie can get viewers to strongly identify with the character (in this case Max) as he gets a huge rush from suddenly becoming part of the robot-fighting world, the viewer will get hooked. Then the challenge is to keep them hooked for as long as possible. ""Real Steel"" hooks you and provides this vicarious rush well past the midway point, in large part because of the twist of having Max bond with the robot as a surrogate father, much in the spirit of ""Terminator 2"" but also nicely integrated with the ongoing dynamic of the old robot being Charlie's twin or at least the piece than completes him . But eventually the wheels fall off, or in this case get knocked off by a ""Rocky"" scripted overreach.  The illusion bursts and most viewers crash back to reality because it takes too much mental energy to suspend disbelief when the team breaks into the glitzy celebrity world. From that point on it is just overwrought melodrama, with the inspirational ""redemption on steroids"" theme aggressively shoved down each viewer's throat.Of course this surfeit of clich&eacute; might have been palatable but for Kevin Durand's overplayed heavy.  Like a series of cardiac arrests the heart of the movie first begins beating irregularly during his debt collection sequence, is then severely damaged by his lame homeboys routine, and finally succumbs from his sequence at the conclusion of the first round of the climatic fight.  These would make great deleted scenes for the DVD release but should have been mercifully trimmed from the already too-long film.The one positive of the glitzy sequences was Olga Fonda's ""Farra Lemkova"" character, an amped up to super-hotness play on WWE's Stephanie McMahon.  She provided the film's most interesting images, a kind of an embodiment of slick temptation.  Can't say the same for Karl Yune's Asian robot designer who essentially was tasked with the Apollo Creed role.  Part of Rocky's success lay in Creed's newly acknowledged respect for Rocky at the conclusion of the film, this allowed the ending to transcend its clich&eacute; elements because it nicely blunted the obvious good vs evil dynamic.  Yune was not allowed to play his character this way and ""Real Steel"" loses considerable depth, dimension, and IQ points because of it.Then again, what do I know?

1392226,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B004A8ZWW4,pastapadre,"[3, 4]","Real Steel will likely be described by many as ""Rocky with robots"" and that isn't too far off from the central themes that drive the emotions and plot developments. What the film does really well though is balance a family dynamic with the robot boxing action - blending the typical inspirational sports story with a futuristic scenario and relatable characters. It's brilliantly handled and leads to some of the most crowd-pleasing moments I've ever experienced in theater - creating the disctinctly rare desire to see it multiple times.The story takes place in 2020 and centers on Charlie (Hugh Jackman), a down-on-his-luck former boxer turned robot fighter who has to take care of his 11 year old son Max for the summer. The two come across an underdog in a ""sparring bot"" named Atom who they fix up, train, and fight as they climb the ranks into the established WRB (World Robot Boxing) league.Though it started a little slow, in establishing the circumstances for Charlie, once Atom is discovered it picks up steam and delivers every step of the way. One of few things taken issue with is how he is handed over his son for the summer even though he never showed any capacity to take care of him despite having custody rights. Overlooking that though it made for the effective element of the two getting to know each other through their shared experiences and how Atom inspired something in them both as well as others. Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) anchors Charlie as a reminder of where he came from and that leads to additional pay-off at the end.Pleasantly surprising is how restrained the futuristic elements are presented - everything was plausible and as though it could have realistically evolved out of today's technology. The robots were certainly advanced but it was interesting to see how they had changed from generation to generation. The top dog in WBR is suitably intimidating as are some of the other foes met along the way. They basically have their own personalities.The fights are exceptionally well choreographed and entertaining and that is probably due in large part to bringing in Sugar Ray Leonard to be a consultant on the boxing scenes. These are of course robots but given that they're controlled by humans and in some circumstances regulated by league rules the fights don't just make for a free-for-all but instead tell a story. That is especially important for how Charlie integrates some of his personality into Atom through the training and in-ring strategy.I was completely invested in what was happening on screen. I can't recall ever reacting in the manner that I did at this film for another - applauding and fist pumping at certain moments and cringing from the abuse dealt out during fight scenes. It was also quite funny throughout and it had an excellent score.Full of genuine moments between characters, fantastic robot fighting sequences, and a good number of laughs - Real Steel will have appeal for all audiences. Far more than just a robot boxing film it generates some real emotion and is completely satisfying in its crowd-pleasing nature. Rarely do I make blanket recommendations but I will do so here.

First of all let me say, and my rating should suggest, that I recommend this film. I enjoyed it as a fun popcorn movie. Will I buy it? Probably not; but I would watch it again for sure. This film is pure escapsim but in a much more endearing way than most cgi robot films. This is Rocky meets Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, an odd combination but one that works overall.Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly really make this story work on a much higher level than it should. There is some unrealistic and forced dialogue that is delivered well enough and sincerely enough to keep it from being distracting. The child actor does a decent job and though he isn't always quite natural I can't fault him and he has the personality needed for the role (perhaps his look just reminds me too much of the awful kid who played Anakin Skywalker in Phantom Menace, but this child is far more spirited and likable). The rest of the casting is fun, if not a little stiff, but the film moves along at a pace where you just enjoy the ride and characters serve their purpose.The real stars of the film are Hugh, Evangeline and the young kid (Dakota Goyo) and they keep you involved. Then there is the Real selling point who might also be considered a star, the robot, Atom. He is well designed and even a likable character despite not having a single line of dialogue. I kept expecting them to go in the direction of the robot having an artificial intelligence but thankfully things are left more light and ambiguous.Other positives, the CG is great overall, the cinematograhpy is well done and doesn't make you sick or lose track of the fights. The fight arenas are each different and each of the fights, which can feel repititive in a film like this, feels fresh and distinct in enough ways to stand as unique.The story has some points that don't play as naturally as they could, expository lines and forced scenes, but ultimately all is forgiven in the final showdown when the final blows are thrown as they are (both literally and metaphorically). If the climax of the film doesn't make you cheer it at least makes you feel good and returns you for a brief moment to a level of nostalgic childhood excitement.We all know where the film is going, but it is fun getting there. And we've never seen it done with robots before, so why not? Go out see this film and have some fun, its a good film for the preteen/young adolescent crowd or for families (despite some colorful dialogue from both father and son).

Me neither.I ask the question, because more often than not, blockbusters, or cheesy b movie or fun concepts seem to be falling under that trap nowadays that I assume was set by the otherwise stellar film Inception, where they tried to be too deep and took themselves seriously.Alright, I'll admit, I'm somewhat lying by answering ""no"" to the question. We did have the 90s, where film's weren't overly pretentious, where they knew what they weren't anything deep, and just went with it and was fun as a result. The Mummy was one I can name. And now, the first movie in a while to just focus kn being entertaining has come out: Real Steel.I was lucky to catch the film at an advance screening tonight, and even despite being a free screening, I felt like I put my money to good use.The film takes place in 2027 and centers around Charlie Kenton, a burnt out boxer who owes over thousands of dollars in unpaid lost robot fights- robot fights having replaced human boxing. After a fiasco that is the result of losing A match against a bull, he discovers an ex girlfriend who had his son has died, and his rather bratty son is being taken not custody by adoptive parents. The parents are given $100 ,000 for custody and Charlie looks after his bratty son, Max, while the adoptive parents are in Italy.After he loses yet ANOTHER fight, which is surprising considering this robot, Noisyboy, is a world renowned robot, he and Max take to the wrecked robot yard to find pieces to create a new robot, when a fall down a cliff results in finding Atom, a G20 sparring bot. They take the bot home and, despite being a sparring bot, Max believes Atom has true potential. After winning a match at a zoo, they realize Atom's true potential, and climb their way up the ladder, in a series of fights leading to the ultimate fight- a fight against a champion robot named Zeus.Real Steel is pure, unadulterated fun. Not once did I feel bored, or beaten over the head with pretentious ""symbolism"". I went in with no expectations but just a fun rock em sock em robot movie, and came out feeling good about myself and impressed.The reason I enjoyed this so much is for the fact that It knew it wasn't anything deep. I mean, when you have a movie about fighting robots, you want just that, and it gives you that. This wasn't like Transformers 2 or 3 (though 3 was enjoyable) where they took themselves too seriously, and focused more on humans running around trying to figure out supposed conspiracies than the robot fighting. Sure this has some family drama, which is essential to the plot, so no worries there... But even there, the film doesn't take itself too seriously.The film is a tad predictable, which does kind of detract (but only slightly), as you know how the fights are going to end. That said, the predictability does not prevent the fights from being fun and suspenseful. On the topic of the fights themselves, they are ridiculously well done and shot. Apparently they were done with real boxers wearing motion capture suits, and it shows, the fighting is realistic, fluid and human like. The Twin City fight was probably my favourite in the movie! And the final fight is intense, sure to have many on the edge oft heir seats.In short, Real Steel is proof that movies are able to be enjoyable despite being not overly deep, and furthermore are more enjoyable for not trying to be too deep.

I've read a few of the Amazon reviews, but chose to keep an open mind and discover the world created by director Shawn Levy, a film that was generally accepted by the critics. I remember the Richard Matheson story that was presented on the Twilight Zone TV episode, though it really takes it's own identity. I enjoyed Hugh Jackman, and his turnaround character as the dad, and young Dakota wasn't as annoying (to me) as some others thought. Evangeline Lilly was sweet and tough, as necessary, and was an endearing medium.The film's only Oscar nom is for Visual Effects, which were totally believable, but I think it's Harry Potter's year to win.I like the underdog, feel-good films a lot. There's a lot of nastiness and mean-spirited stuff that, to me, needs to be countered with ""fluff"" like this. And it's not really fluff, and it's not just for kids. Some of the emotions presented may not be entirely understood by most kids, except for the bullying.One thing I especially liked was the fact that the custody battle was handled with intelligence and genuine concern, and the kid's own issues really mattered. Hope Davis was quite fine, as the kid's aunt, a performance layered with kindness as well as suspicion. Kindness wins.That can't be a bad thing.Another film on a similar theme is ""Win Win""; no special effects, but another film about a lost kid who someone actually cares for. No one's seen that film.

So when I found it on sale at my local Target store recently, I just couldn't help myself and had to pick up a copy.In the year 2020, Human boxing is replaced by robots duking it out in the ring instead. Well, we all know that is not going to happen. Of course Robot boxing WILL be a reality in the future, for sure. But I'm almost certain that Humans will still have boxing matches also.Anyway, Hugh Jackman stars as Charlie, a former boxer who now owns and operates an old beat-up robot boxer named Ambush, which he uses at county fairs and other small shows in battles with other robots to earn a living. He's pretty much a self-centered jerk who suddenly finds himself having to take care of his 11-year-old son, Max, who he abandoned years ago. The two go on robo-battle matches together, where the impatient knee-jerk reactive Charlie embarrasingly loses his latest robo-fighter, Noisy Boy, in a match against another robot named Midas. Noisy Boy gets pretty much trashed in it's losing battle with Midas, leaving Charlie robotless and in desperate need of money, and of course another robot. Later that evening on their way back home from the fight, Charlie and Max obtain an old, abandoned Robo-Boxing training robot named Atom, which they steal from a junkyard in the middle of a rainy night.Max and Charlie clean and polish Atom up, upgrade him, and train him with lots of fancy new moves, then enter him into underground boxing matches where Atom wins fight after fight, and eventually makes his way into an WRBC (World Robot Boxing Championship) match that is televised live on ESPN. Amazingly Atom wins the fight in an upset that has the crowd roaring with applause. After the match, Max makes an announcement live on TV where he challenges the top contending robot champ of all champs, The mighty Zeus, who is the latest in advanced robot boxing technology. Can Atom defeat the mighty Zeus and gain worldwide recognition as a worthy contender, and more importantly, does Charlie finally realize what a schmuck he's been, and become a better Father to his Son, Max?Well, you will just have to watch the movie to find out.Real Steel is a great heartwarming family movie that is loaded with lots of fun, action, and robot fighting scenes that will please the entire family and have them cheering by the movie's end.

1392257,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B004A8ZWW4,Russ Nickel,"[5, 8]","Real Steel is Rocky...WITH ROBOTS. The only difference is that Rocky is named Atom, and instead of rooting for him, you're rooting for the estranged father-son team who controls him with a joystick. It might be the most clich&eacute; thing since sliced bread, but who cares? It's ridiculously fun to watch, maybe because robot boxing is literally the best sport of all time.For example, there was this one part when this robot fought this other robot. Holy crap. It was awesome. And then the robots were jumping all around, and one of their heads came off this one time, and another time one of them exploded, and there was this sick Japanese one, and this really badass undefeated one named Zeus. Whoa.Zeus serves as the main villain sort of. He's Rocky's Apollo Creed, but you know that he's even more hardcore because Zeus is higher up in the chain of command than Apollo. Since Zeus is just a robot, he can't really be a villain though. The actual bad guy is probably this hardcore Asian dude who programmed Zeus to be INVINCIBLE!! Asian guy looks super badass and is always glaring and snarling and he has the best lines in the movie, like ""He has been programmed for every possible contingency!"" and ""The outcome of any match is inevitable!""One of the best parts of this movie is Atom's storyline. In Rocky, it makes sense to see him training and improving, and you can really root for him. Here, the writers need to go out of their way to make the tug-at-your-heartstrings Atom a likable character, and one of the main ways they do it is by giving him a ""shadow function,"" meaning that when you flip a switch he turns into a mimic, copying exactly what you do. That way, instead of training looking like a scene from Hackers, with Hugh Jackman inputting a ton of lines of code into a computer, you get to see Jackman literally teach the robot boxing moves.Atom's got a cute face and these big blue eyes, so he seems almost alive. In fact, pretty early on, the movie hints at him being sentient. The fact that he has a shadow function and can constantly learn from his surroundings lends credence to this theory, and maybe that's why this amazing bot was found discarded in a junkyard...because he was becoming dangerously self-aware! I was excited for that plotline, but it was just a big mislead. In fact, it was so big of a mislead that I don't think it was supposed to be there at all and I just read really heavily into things for no reason. I wonder if anyone else felt the same way.Atom's a sparring bot, which means he was built for other bots to practice on and he can take a lot of hits, but that's pretty much all we know about him. When he gets knocked down, he gets back up, cause, you know, it wouldn't be good sparring practice if he just stayed on the ground. It's actually surprisingly emotional to see this robot constantly struggle to his feet, but when you think about, without the whole sentience thing, it's not particularly impressive. Ooh, his wiring didn't short circuit. Ahh, he's not out of energy. Wow, he's still got all his limbs.Throughout the film, Max keeps talking about how Atom can do things no bot has ever done before, and that's why he's so amazing, but the movie makes very sure not to ever mention or show any of these so-called ""things."" Walking out of that theater, I was totally unaware of how in the world Atom had succeeded at anything. It's not like he had heart, or drive, or even any particular skill. I think there was probably some witchcraft involved in a deleted scene. Eye of newt, tongue of shrike, make this robot Rocky-like.I'm not sure if I've made this clear yet, but this movie is AWESOME. I absolutely loved it. The complete absurdity of it all was fun and never once got on my nerves, and the robot battles were almost sweeter than in Transformers. The kid was actually a good actor, and the movie was surprisingly emotional. Oh, and Evangeline Lily of Lost fame managed to land an another acting role, so that makes me relatively happy.

1392271,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B004A8ZWW4,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[27, 34]","Here's Real Steel in a nutshell. Remember that old board game called Rock Em' Sock 'Em Robots? Well now it's a movie. I mean the old game was just two robots fighting it out in a boxing ring. That's Real Steel. Rocky with hydraulic fluid. Your average underdog story. Add a love interest tired of her beau staying the underdog and a dysfunctional father/son relationship and you pretty much hit all the standard marks for an average plot line. I know that's what I thought when I was hearing about the movie. However when I saw the trailers something about it told me this was going to be a really fun movie to watch. Sure enough it was.So Real Steel is essentially the same, tired old story told that has been spun in Hollywood over and over again, but with robots. Sounds mediocre, huh? Unoriginal plot points is actually the norm these days. Only Real Steel hits these marks with such gusto and polish that it really stands out in that rat race. It's not a masterpiece of script and story, mind you. But then again that's not the intent. This is a feel good, popcorn movie through and through. It's good to see one that at least takes its audience seriously enough to make a well thought out escape.Lets start off with our main character Charlie (Hugh Jackman). To put it simply he is a jerk for better half of the movie. I mean the kind of jerk you just simply cannot like. Eventually the jerk gets a clue and starts to become the kind of guy you can't help but root for. This takes take a well written script and a talented actor to make the jerk and his eventual turnaround believable. You gotta give Jackman credit for his portrayal of Charlie. It's a character with a lot of heart, even when you hate him.Next character of focus is Charlie's estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo). As kid actors go we have a winner. Enough teen indignant defiance to carry the family feuding and enough big eyed wonder of a child to carry the story. From there you have a very good ensemble of supporting actors. Again good, solid acting with very few boughs of melodrama (most of which just feels like it was needed).Since this is a movie about fighting robots the ""real"" stars have to be just as good as the live actors. The robots in the film all come in a wide variety of designs and demeanor. More so the designs also give off a lot of character. The starring robot, Atom, has just enough characteristics to make him the likeable robot with stuff like rounded features on the face and glowing blue 'eyes'. It's not just with the look of the robot that keep you interested, which can range from junkyard mean to dark and polished shiny monsters, but also with other qualities like poise and stance, how they walk, even how they fight. The production used motion capture technology used in the movie Avatar and had boxing star Suger-Ray Leonard advise in the fight scenes. Again the results show a refinement in design and execution that makes the whole experience with the 'bot feel more real and organic.The story flows with good pacing. It's not all fights all the time, and the off-time is worth watching. The underdog success story at first feels like it stays in the under part for a while, but then again that's part of the charm as you see just how much Charlie screws up his life. When we are full on in the big leagues is where all the previous stuff really pays off with the big exciting fight and all that feel-good emotions you would be used to by now on movies like this. The only segment in Real Steel that I have a gripe about is the middle when they start the transition from underdog to rising star. There simply isn't any significant robots fights in between. We don't really see Atom build up his reputation with any additional matches. This is a shame because the movie is really at its best showing these fights. You don't even get a decent fight montage. Still that's my only gripe for an otherwise very entertaining movie.The Blu-Ray release will of course be in 1080p and have a DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio soundtrack. DVD will have Dolby Digital 2.0. Both the DVD and Blu-Ray are announced with a host of features with the Blu-Ray rounding out some nice extra features. Here are the list list of extras (* denotes Blu-Ray exclusive):Audio Commentary With Director Shawn Levy*Countdown to the Fight: The Charlie Kenton Story* - An ESPN-esque expose set right before Atom's big fight with the champ. It covers Charlie's boxing career with interviews with key characters in the film. It also talk about Atom from a sports commentator perspective. Pretty neat little featurette.Sugar Ray Leonard: Cornerman's Champ* - Really cool featurette on Sugar Ray and his involvement with the movie. Hearing him talk in the interviews and hearing how the producers and actors take to his direction gives me a renewed level of respect for the boxing champ. Probably the most feel-good extra in the bunch.Making of Metal Valley - Behind the scenes of the what it took to create the robot junk yard as well as the development of the biggest stunt in the movie in said junkyard.Building the Bots - Interest, if short, making of documentary on the robots. Most of the 'bots were built as well as computer generated and there is a lot of talk about the virtues of using practical effects. Only problem is you don't see enough of the practical effects in action on this feature.Deleted and extended scenes - One of each. There is a slightly extended scene with Charlie's first robot Ambush that has more stuff with the kids. I can see why they took most of the stuff out, but there is a second of footage here and there that would have done well to stay on the final cut. Next is not so much a deleted scene as a set of deleted or extended scenes that follow a particular story arc. Again I agree with the deletion, but I have to admit there was some nice scenes taken out (even if they did mess with the flow of the movie).Bloopers and outtakes - Just as it sounds. A montage of mess-ups for you to enjoy. Not much in the way of belly busting funny, but if you like the behind the scenes camaraderie that you usually see in stuff like this it will satisfy.Real Steel Second Screen: Ringside With Director Shawn Levy*  - This is to access interactive content on your PC or iPad while simultaneously watching the movie. It's worthless if you do not have a device to sync to.I am normally the type of person who shies away from ""popcorn flicks"" but this one is very well worth making the exception. It's fun and excitement for the whole family.

The robots are neither good or evil, but basically shaped by the owner's intent.  Dakota Goyo plays his 11 year old son Max who eventually becomes interested in robot-fighting as well.  Robot fighting has become such a strong influence in Charlie's life to the extent that he is met with some confrontational situations.  For example, Kevin Durand plays his archrival Ricky.  Ricky does not hesitate to aggressively confront Charlie when he wins the robot matching victories.  Ricky even boasts of the time that he ""handled"" Charlie to settle a gambling debt from a robot fight.  Charlie's son Max influences him to have more of a fighter spirit in all areas of his life.  In addition, Charlie's character starts to become more careful in his robot fighting dealings as the movie progresses. This is attributed to the positive influence of his son, and the stronger connection of father and son that increases as the movie progresses.

He owes a lot of money as he doesn't pay up on his losing bets. When his ex dies, she leaves behind, Max his 11 year old estranged son. He sells the ""rights"" of parenthood over to his ex's sister...but here's the catch. The new parents are going to Italy and they need Hugh to take care of his son for the summer until they get back. Got the plot figured out yet? Yawn.While this sounds similar to ""Paper Moon"", Dakota Goyo is no Tatum O'Neill. Jackman comes across as Clint Eastwwood light. Jackman and Goyo were unconvincing in their roles, doing little more than reading lines. On the other hand, Evangeline Lilly as Hugh's girlfriend, gives us a good performance, what little we see of her. At times the movie was more like ""Short Circuit"" than ""Rocky"" demonstrating its appeal to children. Electronic money transfers apparently have disappeared in this age and everything is done in cash, making it easier to get beat up and robbed.In the stadium runway, Goyo gets tossed a t-shirt aka ""Mean"" Joe Greene commercial style. The robot special effects were fantastic. But what really made the movie unbelievable was that the 11 year old hates hamburgers. There is an underground amateur boxing circuit where robots box. I liked this aspect of the movie as it has quirky characters and that ""Thunder Dome Mad Max"" aspect to it. Unfortunately there wasn't enough of it. They could of made all kind of odd bots with weird owners, but opted to have Jackman recite dull cliche lines instead. The climax not only reminds you of a ""Rocky"" rope-a-dope episode, they also stole lines from the film.

Life is pretty much as it is today, with one major exception:  a new sport of robot boxing has emerged.  Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a former boxer down on his luck, scrapes together a living by tinkering with junked robots and fighting them against bulls at rodeos and county fairs.  Hardly a model of integrity and honesty, he takes bets he can't cover and hightails it out of town when he loses.  Charlie owes money to everyone.Charlie abandoned his son Max at birth.  Now 11, Max (Dakota Goyo) has just lost his mother.  Charlie allows the boy's aunt (Hope Davis) and her wealthy husband (James Rebhorn) to raise Max and agrees -- for a hefty fee --  to look after the boy for the summer while they vacation in Europe.The movie combines the story of an absentee father reconnecting to his son and a ""Rocky""-like feel-good movie but with robots slugging it out in the ring.  The problem is that it's tough to identify with or root for a metallic entity.  When two human fighters are going at it, we see the struggle, the pain, the bursts of energy, and the will to win.  With robots, however, special effects steal the story.  Still, Jackman is great to watch as he ably conveys contempt, anger, frustration, compassion.  His tremendous charisma elevates this action drama several notches.The three-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy edition includes four featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, and bloopers.

Charlie Kenton (Jackman) is a former boxer who is now involved in the world of robot boxing. After making a bet that his robot can win a match at a rodeo he is once again in the hole to someone. When he is told that his ex has died and he is now in charge of his 11 year old son he finds a way to pay people back. When his son finds a old robot that he fixes up Charlie's outlook changes. This is a movie that is hard to review. On one hand (for me at least) it was pretty sappy and felt like a remake of ""Rocky 4"". On the other hand this is a great family movie that younger boys will love. The action was very good and the boxing was fun to watch. The dialog and story were pretty cheesy but in terms of a family movie they fit. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you are looking for a manly boxing movie with lots of fighting and action then you may be disappointed. If you are looking for a family movie to watch with your son then this is what you want. Overall, a good movie for families.

And with ever-increasing technological advances, robot death-matches may be a coming attraction destined for a venue near you. Though probably not in the not-to-distant future depicted in this Hugh Jackman science-fiction movie.It's 2020 and Charlie Kenton (Jackman) is a boxer whose days in the ring are long-behind him thanks to the emergence of robot boxing. He now controls other fighters (robots) from the sidelines. Unfortunately, he's had a long run of bad luck and is in serious debt. He's then hit with the news that the son he never sees was recently orphaned when his mother, and Charlie's former girlfriend, died. At the custody hearing he sees Max (played by Dakota Goyo), Max's wealthy Aunt Debra (played by Hope Davis) and her husband Marvin (played by James Rebhorn). Marvin (Rebhorn) tells Charlie that while they want custody and know that he doesn't, they have plans for the summer and they are willing to pay a six-figure sum if Charlie will care for Max until they return. And at that time he'll relinquish all claims to Max. Soon Max and Charlie find a robot to replace the one lost in Charlie's most recent bout and embark on the process of training it and repaying Charlie's debts.I wasn't expecting much from this film given the premise and the fact that some of Jackman's previous films (the X-MEN series and Wolverine follow-up) left me disappointed. I was surprised and very pleased to see this film outshine those in execution and conclusion. Jackman's role isn't all that different from ones past but the tone and supporting characters make for an extremely enjoyable two hours and seven minutes.",4,Iron Man meets The Fighter,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1718,"['world', 'cage', 'matches', 'underground', 'brawling', 'boxing', 'sadly', 'tame', 'comparison', 'ever-increasing', 'technological', 'advances', 'robot', 'death-matches', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'attraction', 'destined', 'venue', 'probably', 'not', 'not-to-distant', 'future', 'depicted', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'science-fiction', 'movie.It', '2020', 'Charlie', 'Kenton', 'Jackman', 'boxer', 'days', 'ring', 'are', 'long-behind', 'thanks', 'emergence', 'robot', 'boxing', 'now', 'other', 'fighters', 'robots', 'sidelines', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'long', 'run', 'bad', 'luck', 'serious', 'debt', 'then', 'hit', 'news', 'son', 'never', 'was', 'recently', 'orphaned', 'when', 'mother', 'Charlie', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'died', 'custody', 'hearing', 'Max', 'played', 'Dakota', 'Goyo', 'Max', 'wealthy', 'Aunt', 'Debra', 'played', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'husband', 'Marvin', 'played', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'Marvin', 'Rebhorn', 'Charlie', 'want', 'custody', 'know', ""n't"", 'have', 'plans', 'summer', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'six-figure', 'sum', 'Charlie', 'will', 'care', 'Max', 'return', 'time', ""'ll"", 'relinquish', 'claims', 'Max', 'Soon', 'Max', 'Charlie', 'find', 'robot', 'replace', 'one', 'lost', 'Charlie', 'most', 'recent', 'bout', 'embark', 'process', 'training', 'repaying', 'Charlie', 'debts.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'film', 'given', 'premise', 'fact', 'Jackman', 'previous', 'films', 'X-MEN', 'series', 'Wolverine', 'follow-up', 'left', 'disappointed', 'was', 'surprised', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'film', 'outshine', 'execution', 'conclusion', 'Jackman', 'role', ""n't"", 'different', 'ones', 'tone', 'supporting', 'characters', 'make', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'two', 'hours', 'seven', 'minutes']",Real Steel

Excited spectators are no longer watching human boxers. They are watching huge robots clashing, controlled by humans. There are even underground robot fight clubs. And the top of the new sports is WRB, World Robot Boxing league. On paper the story of ""Real Steel"" sounds ridiculous. On screen, it works.Directed by Shawn Levy (""The Pink Panther"" ""Night at the Museum""), ""Real Steel"" follows the story of a down-on-luck boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) and his estranged 10-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo). Their strained relationship is apparent from the onset, but things slowly start to change when Max discovers an obsolete ""sparring bot"" buried in the junkyard. Charlie doesn't think so, but Max believes the old robot can fight (he calls it ""Atom""), and persuades the reluctant father to give Atom a chance.Despite the film's incredible setting and some stereotyped supporting characters including a robot genius Tak Mashido (Karl Yune) and his wealthy sponsor Farra Lemcova (Olga Fonda), ""Real Steel"" delivers. The ""Rocky""-like story is familiar, but remains compelling, thanks to the thrilling boxing fight sequences helped by first-rate visual effects (especially of Atom), and strong acting from the stars Jackman and Dayo.More like a father-and-son drama than a sci-fi action, ""Real Steel"" is a real winner.",4,Real Winner,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1414,"['year', '2020', 'just', 'eight', 'years', 'now', 'human', 'boxing', 'replaced', 'giant', 'robot', 'boxing', 'Excited', 'spectators', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'watching', 'human', 'boxers', 'are', 'watching', 'huge', 'robots', 'clashing', 'controlled', 'humans', 'are', 'even', 'underground', 'robot', 'fight', 'clubs', 'top', 'new', 'sports', 'WRB', 'World', 'Robot', 'Boxing', 'league', 'paper', 'story', 'Real', 'Steel', 'ridiculous', 'screen', 'works.Directed', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Night', 'Museum', 'Real', 'Steel', 'story', 'down-on-luck', 'boxer', 'Charlie', 'Kenton', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'estranged', '10-year-old', 'son', 'Max', 'Dakota', 'Goyo', 'strained', 'relationship', 'apparent', 'onset', 'things', 'slowly', 'start', 'change', 'when', 'Max', 'obsolete', 'sparring', 'bot', 'buried', 'junkyard', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Max', 'old', 'robot', 'can', 'fight', 'Atom', 'reluctant', 'father', 'give', 'Atom', 'chance.Despite', 'film', 'incredible', 'setting', 'stereotyped', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'robot', 'genius', 'Tak', 'Mashido', 'Karl', 'Yune', 'wealthy', 'sponsor', 'Farra', 'Lemcova', 'Olga', 'Fonda', 'Real', 'Steel', 'delivers', 'Rocky', 'story', 'familiar', 'compelling', 'thanks', 'thrilling', 'boxing', 'fight', 'sequences', 'helped', 'first-rate', 'visual', 'effects', 'especially', 'Atom', 'strong', 'acting', 'stars', 'Jackman', 'Dayo.More', 'father-and-son', 'drama', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'Real', 'Steel', 'real', 'winner']",Real Steel
1392292,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004A8ZWW4,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","**This review may contain spoilers**RATING: 2.5 out of 5.0'Real Steel' is based on the 1956 Richard Matheson short story, 'Steel', which was later made into a Twilight Zone episode starring Lee Marvin. You might recall in the Twilight Zone episode, Marvin gets into the ring with a robot opponent after boxing has been outlawed in the future. 'Reel Steal' doesn't aspire to such tragic heights: here, the robots are merely controlled by their human handlers at ringside with WiFi-like control boxes.What 'Real Steel' does have is a solid plot. The New York Times may be correct in assessing that it is a ""well wrought out entertainment"". On the other hand, it's basically geared toward the pre-adolescent market with a very predictable storyline.My problem with the film are its principal characters. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, the former boxer turned robot trainer/manager who is pretty much a caricature of a dumb, impulsive, child-like man who's solely driven by material concerns. This is a role that probably would have been better played by a young Mel Gibson in his heyday. Here, Jackman tries hard but fails to make an unlikeable character, likable.Kenyon is unsympathetic from the get-go--welshing on a bet with the sleazy promoter, Ricky, and then skipping town. The dark moment of Real Steel's second act, when Ricky and his goons beat up Kenyon for failing to pay up on the bet, is indicative of why we're unable to root for Kenyon, even after two thirds of the story is complete. Even Kenyon can hardly protest, as the beat down appears not to be completely unjustified.And then there's little Max (Dakota Goyo), who Charlie accepts $100,000 for from the boy's wealthy aunt and uncle, in exchange for full parental custody. The precocious Max, for my tastes, appears to be a little too aggressive and confident for a preteen, and the sight of a father and son, interacting on just about the same level of maturity, comes off as more comical than realistic.The strength of 'Reel Steel' lies in the escalating tension of the fight scenes. The robots themselves (most of them anyway), seem to be modeled on 'Transformers'; but Atom, Max's 'bot', rescued from a junkyard, is more a cross between the steely intelligence of a humanoid Robocop and cuddly Spielberg extraterrestrial.Perhaps the best of the fight scenes occur early on. In the opening scene, Kenyon's obsolete robot, 'Ambush', lives up to his name, when he's slaughtered by a real-life bull at a rural fair. Using the money he obtains from giving up custody of Max, Charlie purchases 'Noisy Boy', a secondhand 'World Robot Boxing League' (WRB) Japanese model, who also ends up as a pile of junk, while being roundly destroyed by Midas, the illegal circuit champion.After the discovery of the discarded 'Atom', an obsolete 'second generation' sparring bot, Max and Charlie try their luck in an unsanctioned outdoor meet, featuring a crowd of unsavory boxing enthusiasts who look like extras from a Mad Max movie. The spiked hair trainer with a robot called 'Metro', steals the show, as he attempts to take down Atom with great panache, but ultimately ends up having his own robot destroyed in the process.A montage follows with the media soon promoting Atom as the people's champion. With his growing fame, Max and Charlie obtain a legally WRB sanctioned fight with 'Twin Cities', a double headed robot, who Atom easily knocks out. This gives Max the opportunity to get up in the ring and challenge Farra Lemkkova and Tak Moshido, the Russian mogul owner and Japanese computer genius trainer, of the intimidating world champion, Zeus.SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD: To the writer's credit, the underdog Atom, does not defeat the physically superior Zeus. True to form, the world champion retains his title, winning on points. Still, Max and Charlie can take comfort that Atom is now the 'people's champion', and he was able to stand toe to toe with the champ.In the end, 'Real Steel' proves to be a real mixed bag. You have a great deal of variety in the various fight venues and a clever mix of actors in giant robot suits doing their thing, coupled with some excellent Avatar-like effects. But the overwhelmingly predictable tale of loser father redeemed along with an in-your-face, overenthusiastic pre-teen boxing enthusiast peddling his win-at-any-cost unwholesome wares, tends to turn this somewhat compelling narrative into a less than successful 'B' picture as opposed to a high-level, sci-fi fantasy entertainment.",2,"Neat, futuristic robot boxing tale undermined by predictable

All the actors do well and the story, with some important exceptions, is well written.

At this point in the movie (first 10 minutes or so) I almost got up to leave as I despise animal cruelty.  I stayed to see how far they were actually going to take that scene.  I know it is just a movie and no real bull was actually hurt making it, but seriously - this is supposed to be the future and a live animal fight is considered an OK and fun family activity (children are present in the rodeo scene)!!?!

1392300,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B004A8ZWW4,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","Director Shawn Levy (""Night At the Museum"")manages to combine Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots withRocky (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)and elements of Richard Matheson's story ""Steel"" (which was previously adapted forThe Twilight Zone: Season 4 [Blu-ray]) to create an entertaining science fiction adventure and crowd pleaser with heart.SPOILERS:Former boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) coulda been a contender but now he carts his boxing robot to and from events like carnivals for a quick buck while avoiding his gambling debts and trying to help his girlfriend Bailey (Evangeline Lily)keep her gym afloat. Charlie's world changed when boxing became about robots NOT people.Charlie becomes a reluctant father when a former girlfriend dies and his son Max (Dakota Goyo)needs a guardian. Rather than fight the boy's aunt (Hope Davis) for the boy, Charlie ""sells"" his son to her wealthy husband but agrees to keep the boy during the summer so that they can travel to Europe wihtout the boy. Charlie plans on using the money to buy a new robot that will allow him to continue to make a living but when the boy discovers a junked sparring robot named ATOM with unique programming, Charlie and Max discover a bond they didn't realize they had AND manage to make it to the show--a boxing match with Zeus.END OF SPOILERS:Levy does a good job of balancing sentiment with action and while the hand of Steven Spielberg is evident in the script structure of the film, Levin makes the film his own. The script by John Gatins (based on Matheson's story as well an earlier screenplay by Dan Gilory and Jeremey Leven that the bulk of this film is drawn from)creates memorable characters and gives Jackman and his co-stars good material to work with.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a richly detailed presentation. The gritty look of the film is maintained and blacks are deep and rich throughout. The film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.39:1.The lossless 24 bit 7.1 soundtrack sounds terrific whether listening on a 5.1 (which is what I have) or even in stereo.The special features include:(Blu-ray exclusive)""Real Steel Second Screen"" which allows you to watch the film with director Levy but you have to download an iPad app for this and either watch it on your iPad or use via BD Live (I watched it with the iPad app)so you're essentially watching two screens at once for comparison acting as sort of a commentary track.(Blu-ray exclusive)""Sugar Ray Leonard: Cornerman's Champ"" takes us behind-the-scenes showing Leonard working with Jackman and those who did the CGI and practical effects robots to make the boxing look convincing.(Blu-rary exclusive)""Countdown to the Fight: The Charlie Kenton Story"" is a 15 minute piece that gives us the rise and fall of Kenton as a boxer in character the entire time presented like an ESPN real special.""The Making of Metal Valley"" focuses on one sequence in the film rather than giving us a typical ""making of"" featurette on the whole film allowing a bit more depth on the making of the sequence where Max and Charlie discover ATOM.""Building the Bots"", a blooper reel and deleted scenes round out the extras.There are two Blu-ray editions I know of--a three disc set with a digital copy and a two disc set with Blu-ray and DVD set. I have the latter. There's also the DVD set as well.Bottom line: ""Real Steel"" is an entertaining and great looking Blu-ray with some great special features.Recommended.",4,"""Rocky"" combined with Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots entertaining science fiction film with heart",1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,3469,"['Director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'Night', 'Museum', 'combine', 'Rock', ""'em"", 'Sock', ""'em"", 'Robots', 'withRocky', 'Two-Disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'Blu-ray', 'Packaging', 'elements', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'story', 'Steel', 'was', 'previously', 'adapted', 'forThe', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Season', '4', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'create', 'entertaining', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'heart.SPOILERS', 'Former', 'boxer', 'Charlie', 'Kenton', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'coulda', 'been', 'contender', 'now', 'boxing', 'robot', 'events', 'carnivals', 'quick', 'buck', 'avoiding', 'gambling', 'debts', 'trying', 'help', 'girlfriend', 'Bailey', 'Evangeline', 'Lily', 'keep', 'gym', 'afloat', 'Charlie', 'world', 'changed', 'when', 'boxing', 'became', 'robots', 'NOT', 'people.Charlie', 'reluctant', 'father', 'when', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'dies', 'son', 'Max', 'Dakota', 'Goyo', 'guardian', 'Rather', 'fight', 'boy', 'aunt', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'boy', 'Charlie', 'son', 'wealthy', 'husband', 'keep', 'boy', 'summer', 'can', 'travel', 'Europe', 'boy', 'Charlie', 'using', 'money', 'buy', 'new', 'robot', 'will', 'allow', 'continue', 'make', 'living', 'when', 'boy', 'junked', 'sparring', 'robot', 'named', 'ATOM', 'unique', 'programming', 'Charlie', 'Max', 'discover', 'bond', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'AND', 'manage', 'make', 'show', 'boxing', 'match', 'Zeus.END', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'Levy', 'good', 'job', 'balancing', 'sentiment', 'action', 'hand', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'evident', 'script', 'structure', 'film', 'Levin', 'film', 'own', 'script', 'John', 'Gatins', 'based', 'Matheson', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'earlier', 'screenplay', 'Dan', 'Gilory', 'Jeremey', 'Leven', 'bulk', 'film', 'drawn', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Jackman', 'co-stars', 'good', 'material', 'work', 'with.The', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'richly', 'detailed', 'presentation', 'gritty', 'look', 'film', 'maintained', 'blacks', 'are', 'deep', 'rich', 'film', 'presented', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1.The', 'lossless', '24', 'bit', '7.1', 'soundtrack', 'sounds', 'terrific', 'listening', '5.1', 'what', 'have', 'even', 'stereo.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'Blu-ray', 'exclusive', 'Real', 'Steel', 'Second', 'Screen', 'watch', 'film', 'director', 'Levy', 'have', 'download', 'iPad', 'app', 'watch', 'iPad', 'use', 'BD', 'Live', 'watched', 'iPad', 'app', ""'re"", 'essentially', 'watching', 'two', 'screens', 'once', 'comparison', 'acting', 'sort', 'commentary', 'track', 'Blu-ray', 'exclusive', 'Sugar', 'Ray', 'Leonard', 'Cornerman', 'Champ', 'behind-the-scenes', 'showing', 'Leonard', 'working', 'Jackman', 'who', 'did', 'CGI', 'practical', 'effects', 'robots', 'make', 'boxing', 'look', 'convincing', 'Blu-rary', 'exclusive', 'Countdown', 'Fight', 'Charlie', 'Kenton', 'Story', '15', 'minute', 'piece', 'rise', 'fall', 'Kenton', 'boxer', 'character', 'entire', 'time', 'presented', 'ESPN', 'real', 'special', 'Making', 'Metal', 'Valley', 'one', 'sequence', 'film', 'rather', 'giving', 'typical', 'making', 'featurette', 'whole', 'film', 'allowing', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'making', 'sequence', 'where', 'Max', 'Charlie', 'discover', 'ATOM', 'Building', 'Bots', 'blooper', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'round', 'out', 'are', 'two', 'Blu-ray', 'editions', 'know', 'three', 'disc', 'set', 'digital', 'copy', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'latter', 'also', 'DVD', 'set', 'well.Bottom', 'line', 'Real', 'Steel', 'entertaining', 'great', 'looking', 'Blu-ray', 'great', 'special', 'features.Recommended']",Real Steel

1392302,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004A8ZWW4,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[130, 157]","Real Steel, directed by Shawn Levy, is one of the very few movies I've seen in recent years where the audience I was in actually broke into applause in various scenes.  A masterfully done tale of underdogs - a boy and his dad and a discarded robot - going against the odds, it really does get you pumped up to that level.  I got a bigger kick out of this movie than I have from any other this year.  It really is that much fun to watch.The germ idea for Real Steel comes from a 1956 short story by Richard Matheson that was made into a classic Twilight Zone episode, and the look is right out of the Transformers franchise, but the heart - and there's a lot of it in this film - comes in equal measure from two films one would ordinarily have never linked together:  John Avildsen's boxing classic Rocky (1976) and Peter Bogdanovich's Depression-era con-man & kid road trip classic Paper Moon (1973).The plot is set in the not so distant future of 2020, where human boxing has been completely displaced by robot boxing.  Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a former boxer who now gets by ""managing"" a robot boxer named Ambush, is about as down on his luck as it gets.  Deep in debt and barely able to keep Ambush functional, Charlie is reduced to working the fringes of the boxing circuit and even exhibiting Ambush in county fairs where he puts the robot up against things like wild bulls. Which turns out to be a really bad idea when Ambush ends up getting smashed to pieces by a bull that weighs almost three times what he had agreed to, leaving Charlie fleeing in his van afterwards to avoid the exhibition promoter (Kevin Durand) to whom he now owes twenty thousand dollars.  In this opening scene, we learn two things that tell us why Charlie is in the straits he's in: (1) he frequently makes really bad decisions, especially when he's desperate, and (2) he lets himself get distracted instead of keeping his mind on what he's doing - a bad thing to have happen when your robot is fighting a two-and-a-half ton bull.Shortly after this disaster, while wondering how he's going to be able to afford another robot, Charlie unexpectedly finds out that an old ex-girlfriend of his has died, leaving behind an eleven-year-old boy named Max (Dakota Goyo), a son Charlie hasn't seen since he was an infant.  Thinking that it's just a matter of signing over custody to the boy's aunt Debra (Hope Davis) and her new husband Marvin (James Rebhorn), Charlie shows up at the courthouse, only to quickly realize that Marvin is rich and that the opportunity he's been needing has landed right in his lap.  Abruptly seeming to change his mind about signing the boy over, Charlie privately talks Marvin into an agreement where he'll give up custody rights to the boy, but only for $100K.  Not wild about adopting Max to begin with, Marvin grudgingly agrees, but only on the condition that Charlie keep the boy for the next three months so that the kid doesn't interfere with his plans for their summer vacation in Europe.  Charlie, not wild about being saddled with a kid, reluctantly agrees, getting half the money up front, the other half to be handed over when he delivers the kid at the end of the summer.  The deal done, Marvin departs with Debra, leaving Charlie face-to-face with Max for the first time.  And clearly, neither of them are thrilled by this arrangement.  Max is even less thrilled when he finds out that he's been ""sold"" to his aunt and uncle and angrily demands that Charlie give him half the money.  Which Charlie can't because he's already spent most of it buying a replacement robot named Noisy Boy.  Seem familiar?  It's right out of Paper Moon, as are some other key moments in the film.)Charlie takes Max to an old boxing gym that now serves largely as a repair shop for robot boxers, run by his friend Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lily).  The two of them have history together as Bailey's father was Max's trainer back in the days when Max was a boxer and the boxing gym was still a boxing gym.  Bailey knows Max better than he knows himself, and she's the first one to recognize just how much Max and Charlie are alike.  But the similarities quickly come out when Noisy Boy is delivered and Max stares at the robot with fanboy adoration, rattling off a string of fight statistics that even Charlie wasn't aware of.  He also turns out to know the Japanese commands needed to operate Noisy Boy from all of the video games he's played.Things finally seem to be looking up and Charlie gets an old fight promoting friend Finn (Anthony Mackie) to get Noisy Boy on the evening's fight card at the local arena.  But once again, Charlie's hopes are dashed by bad decisions and not keeping his mind on what he's doing.  Faced with once again having to try to come up with a robot but with no money to pay for one, Charlie takes Max along as he night-raids a junkyard looking for robot parts.  As they wander through the place in the dark and the rain, Max falls off the edge of a pit and is barely saved when he's snagged on the exposed arm of a buried junked robot.  Excited over having found an entire robot, Max insists on digging him out, which Charlie wants no part of.  Hours later, when the sun is finally rising, we see a worn-out and thoroughly mud-bedraggled Max hauling the recovered robot back to the van where Charlie is waiting.  Max just glares at his father for a moment, then starts hitting and kicking at him in a blind, exhausted and exasperated fury.  The scene is absolutely priceless.Back at the gym, Max sets about cleaning up the salvaged robot, an older-gen sparring `bot built to take massive punishment but not to deal it out. He discovers that the `bot is named Atom, and that Atom has a shadow mode where he copies the movements of whoever is operating him.  Max, convinced that Atom can take on actual boxer robots and win, pesters Charlie until Charlie finally arranges for Atom to get a match in an unsanctioned off-the-grid makeshift outdoor arena. In spite of himself, Charlie gets caught up in Max's dogged determination and enthusiasm and the two begin working together. From there on, the film shifts into Rocky mode and its Charlie and Max and their underdog robot Atom going up against the odds.The supporting cast is superb.  Evangeline Lilly's Bailey is quite convincing as a woman who knows Charlie well enough to care about him but to be wary of him at the same time.  The same holds true for Anthony Mackie's Finn, who lets Charlie talk him into match-ups that he knows are a bad bet but he can't prevent from happening. Kevin Durand's Ricky is affably ruthless as a ""good ol' boy"" promoter who gets Charlie in hock and then takes it out of his hide later.  John Gatins (who wrote the screenplay) brings over-the-top trash-talk bravado to his pierced and mohawked Kingpin, the manager of the robot Atom is first put up against.  And Karl Yune and Olga Fonda are pitch perfect as Tak Mashido and Farra Lemkova, the arrogant brains and ice-cold business savvy behind the reigning World Robot Boxing League champion, Zeus, the ultramodern engine of destruction that Max, Charlie and Atom must ultimately face.And the robots themselves are impressive.  Not mere CGI fabrications, twenty-six animatronic robots were created for the movie.  A combination of CGI and the simul-cam motion capture technology developed for Avatar was used for the scenes where you see the robots moving independently or fighting in the ring.  Each boxing robot has a distinctive look and feel tailored to suggest varying levels of sophistication and menace. Everything about Atom, on the other hand, symbolizes the underdog nature of Charlie and Max.  Older generation, less sophisticated, more scarred and far less shiny, and a little smaller than most of the robots he's put up against, Atom also has soft blue-oval eyes that subtly suggest empathic connection.  There's no sentience behind them, no artificial intelligence, but Atom nonetheless ""sees"" Max and Charlie, and in him they see themselves.But the heavy lifting rests on the chemistry between Hugh Jackman's Charlie and Dakota Goyo's Max.  Hugh Jackman's Charlie is spot on, a subtle portrayal of a man always reaching for the brass ring - and always tripping himself up before he can grab it.  Jackman brings this out beautifully - you can see the desperate agony on his face each time when Charlie realizes the brass ring is slipping away from him yet again.  But something nonetheless keeps Charlie going on, something inside him just won't let him quit, and Jackman brings out that side of him as well. Dakota Goyo's Max is a younger - and very possibly smarter - Charlie that life hasn't beaten down yet.  He is that voice inside Charlie that won't let him give up.  And in Max, Charlie finds himself all over again.Highly, highly recommended.",5,"Mix Rocky with Paper Moon, add in robots, and voila!

There was an attempt to redeem him but way too late in the movie and far too little content to that redemption... there's no real emotional climax for the father it seems.All story criticisms aside, there are some genuine worthwhile points in this film, the interactions between the kid and his robot are solid ""boy and his dog"" tropes, with the added layer of the robot serving as a surrogate father figure for the son. My kids loved it - but all agreed the dad was worthless. Even at the end, the best we get from him is pretty lacking.",3,The robots are far better actors than H.

1392308,AP3B615GM191G,B004A8ZWW4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 4]","In today's Hollywood, originality seems to be a lost concept, with nearly every movie a sequel or a remake of some kind.  Remarkably, however, though ""Real Steel"" is indeed an amalgamation of many previous boxing movie themes, it provides just enough originality to make viewers feel like they are watching those themes for the first time.For a basic plot summary, ""Real Steel"" begins with the future story of Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a deep-in-debt deadbeat who now is reduced to taking low-level fights controlling the robots that dominate the sport of boxing.  Just when his luck seems to have run out, however, Charlie inherits his long-abandoned son Max (Dakota Goyo) and the pair find a long-abandoned robot in the scrap heap.  The combination of the two serve to give Charlie something positive to live for once again.As mentioned in the opener, this film almost blatantly rips off themes from ""The Champ"", ""Rocky"", and pretty much every boxing flick this side of ""Million Dollar Baby"" ever made.  At one point, a scene involving the robot boxing champion Zeus mirrors Ivan Drago of ""Rocky IV"" fame.Yet, because of the futuristic setting and respect for the sport of boxing, ""Real Steel"" still manages to succeed where so many other films fail...making viewers care in the end.  Even though (while viewing) I pretty much knew what was going to transpire (at least emotionally) in the end, it didn't matter because I was still riveted by the spectacle of it all!What really helps is that the entire film is based on the real-life premise that boxing is a ""dying sport"" and thus something different is needed to revive it in the face of MMA.  Thus, robots are introduced and touted as the greatest fighting creations of all-time.  But is that really the case?!  Those are the types of plot issues that this film (successfully) grapples with.Also, though the auxiliary cast is solid as well, Jackman stands out for his ability to effortlessly slip into the role of Charlie.  Though the drama involving his son and potential love interest (Evangeline Lilly of LOST fame in a subdued, yet emotional role) might provide the tear-jerker moments for some, I was most captivated by the journey of Charlie from beginning to end.  Jackman captures that journey expertly.Thus, while perhaps not an American classic, ""Real Steel"" is a film that can be enjoyed on a number of different levels.  Though I would most recommend it to boxing aficionados, fans of sci-fi, future tech, and just plain emotional drama will also enjoy the ride.",4,Will Make You Care In The End,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,2535,"['today', 'Hollywood', 'originality', 'be', 'lost', 'concept', 'nearly', 'movie', 'sequel', 'remake', 'kind', 'Remarkably', 'however', 'Real', 'Steel', 'indeed', 'amalgamation', 'many', 'previous', 'boxing', 'movie', 'themes', 'just', 'enough', 'originality', 'make', 'viewers', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'themes', 'first', 'time.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Real', 'Steel', 'future', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Kenton', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'deep-in-debt', 'deadbeat', 'who', 'now', 'reduced', 'taking', 'low-level', 'fights', 'controlling', 'robots', 'dominate', 'sport', 'boxing', 'Just', 'when', 'luck', 'have', 'run', 'out', 'however', 'Charlie', 'long-abandoned', 'son', 'Max', 'Dakota', 'Goyo', 'pair', 'find', 'long-abandoned', 'robot', 'scrap', 'heap', 'combination', 'two', 'serve', 'give', 'Charlie', 'something', 'positive', 'live', 'once', 'again.As', 'mentioned', 'opener', 'film', 'almost', 'blatantly', 'off', 'themes', 'Champ', 'Rocky', 'pretty', 'much', 'boxing', 'flick', 'side', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'point', 'scene', 'involving', 'robot', 'boxing', 'champion', 'Zeus', 'mirrors', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'fame.Yet', 'futuristic', 'setting', 'respect', 'sport', 'boxing', 'Real', 'Steel', 'still', 'succeed', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'fail', 'making', 'viewers', 'care', 'end', 'Even', 'viewing', 'pretty', 'much', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'transpire', 'least', 'emotionally', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'still', 'riveted', 'spectacle', 'What', 'really', 'entire', 'film', 'based', 'real-life', 'premise', 'boxing', 'dying', 'sport', 'thus', 'something', 'different', 'needed', 'revive', 'face', 'MMA', 'Thus', 'robots', 'are', 'introduced', 'touted', 'greatest', 'fighting', 'creations', 'all-time', 'really', 'case', 'are', 'types', 'plot', 'issues', 'film', 'successfully', 'grapples', 'with.Also', 'auxiliary', 'cast', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'Jackman', 'out', 'ability', 'effortlessly', 'slip', 'role', 'Charlie', 'drama', 'involving', 'son', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'LOST', 'fame', 'subdued', 'emotional', 'role', 'might', 'provide', 'tear-jerker', 'moments', 'was', 'most', 'captivated', 'journey', 'Charlie', 'beginning', 'end', 'Jackman', 'journey', 'expertly.Thus', 'perhaps', 'not', 'American', 'classic', 'Real', 'Steel', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'number', 'different', 'levels', 'would', 'most', 'recommend', 'boxing', 'aficionados', 'fans', 'sci-fi', 'future', 'tech', 'just', 'plain', 'emotional', 'drama', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'ride']",Real Steel
