899406,A6W68M8K0BKGD,B0008KLVB4,"C. S. Schofield ""The Crank""","[0, 0]","The reviews of Walker seem to fall into two categories; those who flat out love the show on its own merits, and those who think that it is a classic for sheer awfulness. I happen to belong to the first category, with one caveat; I come to the show looking for more of the same kind of action that typified American martial arts movies in the 1980's. Nobody is ever going to mistake Chuck Norris for Peter O'Toole, but on the other hand O'Toole wouldn't have made a particularly convincing action hero. even his Lawrence was a plotter and a talker, not a fighter.Nobody who calls Walker 'the worst television show' has ever seen a real turkey (like My Mother The Car, for example). And nobody who says that Norris is a dead awful actor has seen many really bad films .... or many of the '80's karate flicks either. Among the chop-and-kick crew from that era, Norris does rather well ...  which is why he had a career rather than a handful of films descending from theatrical release to direct-to-video. Few Karate/Kung-Fu actors really act very well. Jet Li is learning, Chow Yun Fat is an actor first, Jackie Chan is a clown first and an actor second. The rest of the Honk Kong fraternity don't strike me as better than Norris. On our side of the pacific the only actor who really did both well was Brandon Lee. Seagal is a ham, Van Damn is about on Norris's level, and nobody else spring to mind. As for Norris in this show, well .... Walker doesn't stretch him much, which is good ... he didn't deal well with being stretched beyond a certain point. Instead the show plays to his strengths; a reasonably solid b-actor range, and physical action.This isn't Law and Order. It isn't subtle at all. Subtle is fine in its place, but when you want to cheer on the good guys and boo the bad guys, Walker fits the bill to a ""T"".",5,Depends what you like......,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,1822,"['reviews', 'Walker', 'seem', 'fall', 'two', 'categories', 'who', 'flat', 'out', 'show', 'own', 'merits', 'who', 'think', 'classic', 'sheer', 'awfulness', 'happen', 'belong', 'first', 'category', 'one', 'caveat', 'come', 'show', 'looking', 'more', 'same', 'kind', 'action', 'typified', 'American', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', '1980', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'going', 'mistake', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'other', 'hand', ""O'Toole"", 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'action', 'hero', 'even', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'plotter', 'talker', 'not', 'fighter.Nobody', 'who', 'Walker', ""'the"", 'worst', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'seen', 'real', 'turkey', 'My', 'Mother', 'Car', 'example', 'nobody', 'who', 'Norris', 'dead', 'awful', 'actor', 'seen', 'many', 'really', 'bad', 'films', 'many', ""'80"", 'karate', 'flicks', 'chop-and-kick', 'crew', 'era', 'Norris', 'rather', 'well', 'why', 'had', 'career', 'rather', 'handful', 'films', 'descending', 'theatrical', 'release', 'direct-to-video', 'Few', 'Karate/Kung-Fu', 'actors', 'really', 'act', 'very', 'well', 'Jet', 'Li', 'learning', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'actor', 'first', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'clown', 'first', 'actor', 'second', 'rest', 'Honk', 'Kong', 'fraternity', 'do', ""n't"", 'strike', 'better', 'Norris', 'side', 'pacific', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'well', 'was', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Seagal', 'ham', 'Van', 'Damn', 'Norris', 'level', 'nobody', 'else', 'spring', 'mind', 'Norris', 'show', 'well', 'Walker', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'much', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'deal', 'well', 'being', 'stretched', 'certain', 'point', 'Instead', 'show', 'strengths', 'reasonably', 'solid', 'b-actor', 'range', 'physical', 'action.This', ""n't"", 'Law', 'Order', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'Subtle', 'fine', 'place', 'when', 'want', 'cheer', 'good', 'guys', 'boo', 'bad', 'guys', 'Walker', 'bill', 'T']",Walker Texas Ranger - The Final Season
899407,A1RI3XMZHQXPD2,B0008KLVB4,C. Taylor,"[9, 17]","Yes. That's right. Soon they will probably release all the Walker episodes on DVD and these episodes, released as season 8 or 10, will have all the extras, out-takes, promos, interviews, gag reels, documentaries, etc. etc. etc. Just the idea alone that the box has no season number on the side is enough to make anyone collecting the series sick.  This was done because I don't think that the Norris production company even knows which season the last season was as their is some question as to if the first three episodes were a separate season, part of the first season, or just aired pilot episodes. Anyway, there would be no way in hell they could get away with releasing the first three episodes as season #1.There is a huge problem with releasing the entire run of Walker: Texas Ranger in volumes. When the series originally debuted as a summer series it was suppose to run for several episodes. But Norris, who produced the show himself, ran through the budget halfway through episode #3. Asking CBS for more money to finish the season, instead he was only given enough to finish the third episode in post and the three were aired. When the ratings proved good CBS ordered more episodes giving Norris a chance to finish the initial summer season and continue it to the end of the year.The first season mess aside, The season before the last season is something else that could be a problem. Problem #1, there is a crossover episode with ""Martial Law"" where part one takes place on the series ""Martial Law"" and part two takes place on ""Walker: Texas Ranger"". [ This is also a problem for Martial Law should they ever decide to release them on DVD. ] The other is the spin off series ""Sons of Thunder"" which replaced Walker for a few weeks, although walker did make many guest appearances as well as the SOT cast showing up on many episodes of W:TR. When CBS reran some of the Sons of Thunder episodes they were retitled as Walker: Texas Ranger. Norris's production company must now decide if those episodes count as a different series or now as sub episodes of the Walker series.And then there is those TV movies with Walker which may or may not count as episodes. No wonder they simply released the last season instead of trying to figure out the mess of the seasons before.Perhaps another reason why this season was chosen was the addition of Nia Peeples to the cast. Sadly, in the last couple of seasons Chuck Norris was in his 60's and could not physically carry the episodes anymore. So new characters were introduced to do much of the legwork, and bar fights, that Walker usually did. It was his age that finally convinced Norris to end the series after 8 years. In an amazing wrap-up episode they were even able to bring back a long dead character, CD Parker.  Noble Willingham had played the role for six years but left the series to run for congress. As he was campaigning his characters absence was explained as ""Away on a fishing trip"". When he won his congressional seat and was not coming back, they decided to end one of the episodes with Walker getting a letter saying that CD had died in his sleep, and the character was buried. In the last episodes of the series ""The final showdown prts 1 & 2"" The villains not only hunt down all the rangers but let walker know that CD did not die of natural causes but was poisoned, giving Walker a huge motive for revenge. The episode also saw the birth of Walkers daughter as well as flashbacks showing the fate  of Hayes Cooper [ Walkers alter ego from 100 years earlier ]And then they decided to make a TV movie, ""Trial by fire"" which ends with a cliffhanger. That suggests a new season of Walker, which means this box set is not really the final season after all.",1,One star for no extras and what will obviously be re-released wit extras later on.,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,3727,"['Yes', 'right', 'Soon', 'will', 'probably', 'release', 'Walker', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'released', 'season', '8', '10', 'will', 'have', 'extras', 'out-takes', 'promos', 'interviews', 'gag', 'reels', 'documentaries', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'Just', 'idea', 'alone', 'box', 'season', 'number', 'side', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'collecting', 'series', 'sick', 'was', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Norris', 'production', 'company', 'even', 'season', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'question', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'were', 'separate', 'season', 'part', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'aired', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'Anyway', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'hell', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'releasing', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'season', '1.There', 'huge', 'problem', 'releasing', 'entire', 'run', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'volumes', 'When', 'series', 'originally', 'debuted', 'summer', 'series', 'was', 'suppose', 'run', 'several', 'episodes', 'Norris', 'who', 'produced', 'show', 'ran', 'budget', 'halfway', 'episode', '3', 'Asking', 'CBS', 'more', 'money', 'finish', 'season', 'instead', 'was', 'only', 'given', 'enough', 'finish', 'third', 'episode', 'post', 'three', 'were', 'aired', 'When', 'ratings', 'proved', 'good', 'CBS', 'ordered', 'more', 'episodes', 'giving', 'Norris', 'chance', 'finish', 'initial', 'summer', 'season', 'continue', 'end', 'year.The', 'first', 'season', 'mess', 'aside', 'season', 'last', 'season', 'something', 'else', 'could', 'be', 'problem', 'Problem', '1', 'crossover', 'episode', 'Martial', 'Law', 'where', 'part', 'one', 'place', 'series', 'Martial', 'Law', 'part', 'two', 'place', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', '[', 'also', 'problem', 'Martial', 'Law', 'should', 'ever', 'decide', 'release', 'DVD', ']', 'other', 'spin', 'series', 'Sons', 'Thunder', 'replaced', 'Walker', 'few', 'weeks', 'walker', 'did', 'make', 'many', 'guest', 'appearances', 'as', 'well', 'SOT', 'cast', 'showing', 'up', 'many', 'episodes', 'W', 'TR', 'When', 'CBS', 'reran', 'Sons', 'Thunder', 'episodes', 'were', 'retitled', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Norris', 'production', 'company', 'must', 'now', 'decide', 'episodes', 'count', 'different', 'series', 'now', 'sub', 'episodes', 'Walker', 'series.And', 'then', 'TV', 'movies', 'Walker', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'count', 'episodes', 'wonder', 'simply', 'released', 'last', 'season', 'instead', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'mess', 'seasons', 'before.Perhaps', 'reason', 'why', 'season', 'was', 'chosen', 'was', 'addition', 'Nia', 'Peeples', 'cast', 'Sadly', 'last', 'couple', 'seasons', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'was', '60', 'could', 'not', 'physically', 'carry', 'episodes', 'anymore', 'So', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'do', 'much', 'legwork', 'bar', 'fights', 'Walker', 'usually', 'did', 'was', 'age', 'finally', 'convinced', 'Norris', 'end', 'series', '8', 'years', 'amazing', 'wrap-up', 'episode', 'were', 'even', 'able', 'bring', 'back', 'long', 'dead', 'character', 'CD', 'Parker', 'Noble', 'Willingham', 'had', 'played', 'role', 'six', 'years', 'left', 'series', 'run', 'congress', 'was', 'campaigning', 'characters', 'absence', 'was', 'explained', 'Away', 'fishing', 'trip', 'When', 'won', 'congressional', 'seat', 'was', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'decided', 'end', 'one', 'episodes', 'Walker', 'getting', 'letter', 'saying', 'CD', 'had', 'died', 'sleep', 'character', 'was', 'buried', 'last', 'episodes', 'series', 'final', 'showdown', 'prts', '1', '2', 'villains', 'not', 'only', 'hunt', 'down', 'rangers', 'let', 'walker', 'know', 'CD', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'natural', 'causes', 'was', 'poisoned', 'giving', 'Walker', 'huge', 'motive', 'revenge', 'episode', 'also', 'saw', 'birth', 'Walkers', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'flashbacks', 'showing', 'fate', 'Hayes', 'Cooper', '[', 'Walkers', 'alter', 'ego', '100', 'years', 'earlier', ']', 'then', 'decided', 'make', 'TV', 'movie', 'Trial', 'fire', 'cliffhanger', 'new', 'season', 'Walker', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'really', 'final', 'season']",Walker Texas Ranger - The Final Season
