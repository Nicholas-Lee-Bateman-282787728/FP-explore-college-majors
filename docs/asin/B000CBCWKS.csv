955905,AFAGGH1YKK4NP,B000CBCWKS,Geoffrey C. Newman,"[8, 8]","If you love crime dramas,especially the one's based on true stories,then ""The FBI Murders"" is the film for you.Despite it's low-budget ""Made-for-TV"" trappings...I consider this to be just as powerful as the Al Pacino/Robert DeNiro thriller ""Heat"".For those of you who don't remember, ""In the line of duty"" was a series of TV movies profiling the couragous and sometimes harrowing true tales of law enforcement officers and their bravery under fire.Over the years,the quality of these hard-hitting dramas have lost their luster...But the ""FBI Murders"" stands out as one of the best in the crime genre.This particular movie centers on two Vietnam vets (David Soul and Michael Gross) who use their military training to pull off a string of violent,commando-style,bank and armored car robberies from the Fall of 1985 to the Spring of 1986 in Florida to support their families,mistresses,and lavish lifestyle after their series of hair-brained ""get rich quick"" schemes fall through.Their lightning-quick strikes and disappearances has left the police,and even the FBI's elite robbery task force,one fatal step behind.Like the film ""Heat"",which I referenced earlier,the film focuses on the personal lives of the robbers and the agents.Michael Gross turns in a chilling character that is a far cry from his ""sensitive dad"" persona of ""Family Ties"".Gross's character is a scary psychopath who may or may not have been behind the brutal murder of his first wife and who is certainly abusive to his current wife and children despite his aura of Christian respectability.David Soul on the other hand is the opitamy of the ""slow burning fuse"".He's cold,calculating,and throughly dangerous.On the FBI side,the focus is on the lead investigator in the robberies played by Ronny Cox.He's a straight arrow veteran who has no wife and kids...he's married to the FBI.What's worse is he's having to break in a hot-shot kid (Bruce Greenwood in an early role) as his new partner.The rest of the FBI unit is the picture of the ""brotherhood of lawmen"" cliche.They kid around with one another,they even have affectionate names and a few of them have interesting personal stories.For instance,when the head of the department (the actor's name escapes me, unfortunately) learns that a civilian who followed the bandits after one of their heists,traces the killers into the agent's neighborhood,the agent grow afraid that his family could end up victims and begins prowling the area for their getaway car.Another agent grapples with trying to make his young son understand that he doesn't go around getting into gunfights like the TV Cop Shows portray.As the tension builds around these personal stories....the robbers are getting more and more desperate.And the agents are getting more and more determaned.And that climaxes into what has now been called one of the FBI's bloodiest shoot-outs.For high tension and high drama...this movie delivers.",5,Shocking

Based on actual events in Miami, Florida (I'm not sure how embellished), ""In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders concerns a pair of military trained bank- robbers and the FBI task force who attempted to identify and apprehend them. This is a far cry from the fictional movies that attempt to glorify G-Men or violent criminals.Both sides are portrayed in their real life bumbling glory as the robbers act stupidly and recklessly and the task force basically stumbles into them and is ill prepared for the confrontation. But this makes the story quite fascinating and if you connect with it you will probably want to watch it several times.The film is structured as two parallel stories and what suspense there is stems from the viewers knowledge that the two stories will eventually intersect with each other, you just don't know how or when it will occur.The strength of the film (besides its real life feel) is the characterization of the two robbers, played by David Soul and Michael Gross. Although their backgrounds are fragmentary, it appears that they bring out the worst in each other and their crime spree continues more for the adrenaline rush it provides. They begin to really get off on the violence and power, their crimes are almost random which tends to work in their favor as the investigation can find little logic or pattern behind their activities.The film's weakness is the parallel story of the task force. This was a far cry from a cerebral Sherlock Holmes type investigation so you eagerly wait for them to cut back to Soul and Grace. The characterizations are generally shallow and weak so almost all viewers will end up identifying with the two criminals; even though they have a lot of mad dog qualities. Doug Sheehan is quite effective as the task force commander, but the Bruce Greenwood - Ronny Cox pairing (rookie and veteran) never really connects.  Greenwood has gone on to do some amazing stuff under Atom Egoyan's direction, he obviously has far more talent than he shows in this role.The violent climax is worth waiting for, although the violence is in real time, the confrontation has the slow-mo feel of a Sam Peckinpah production.Then again, what do I know?

955918,AWJC2DP07N5ZM,B000CBCWKS,"Vladimir Moya ""Vlad""","[0, 0]","This TV movie is one of the best and most memorable TV movies from the 80s. The movie was broadcast in 1988 based on a real event from 1986. The movie concerns bank robberies perpetrated by two former Army buddies in Miami and the FBI agents who tail them. The movie does a great job of establishing its two sides the good versus the bad. As to be expected, the bad guys are undoubtedly the stars as you can plainly see by the DVD cover. The two baddies are played by TV icons of the 70s and 80s. Bill Matix is played by Michael Gross who at the time was riding high as Steven Keaton the patriarch of the sitcom Family Ties. His partner in TV crime is Mike Platt played by David Soul, who in the 70s played Detective Hutch in the cop series Starsky & Hutch. Mike and Bill are old friends from the Army who remain close in civilian life. They seem to be in the landscape business but they have a series of other ventures, chief among them is armed robbery. They shake down a  man who has sold them broken pinball machines and on the spur of the moment become bank robbers by jacking an armored car. They get little money but their appetite for bank robbing is whetted so they set forth on a crime spree that shocks all of Miami. On their heels quickly is the FBI, more specifically a special team force dubbed &#34;The Funsters&#34;. We first meet their rookie member Agent Dove played by Bruce Greenwood who has just started his FBI career. He's introduced to his commander Agent Grogan played by veteran actor Ronny Cox. The movie does a good job of establishing rapport and chemistry between the FBI agents. Although they are the drab good guys, the viewer gets a sense that these men genuinely like each other and like working together. They are all decent dedicated lawmen who play by the rules and then go home to their families. The antagonists on the other hand are sneaky and sly. In particular Gross' character Matix is seen in church preaching about how &#34;the good Lord&#34; has blessed him and his new family. Matix's last wife was murdered and the investigation is still trailing him. The viewer gets enough clues to figure out that Matix may have had something to do with her murder. His new wife or girlfriend is now pregnant which infuriates Matix to the point of telling the woman to leave for good. She does and by the middle of the movie Matix has a new gf named Vicky played by 80s starlet Teri Copley. Soul's character Platt has a more stable environment at home but Platt is literally a ticking time bomb who loves automatic weapons and their potential violence. He brags to his stepson that he was trained for Vietnam until &#34;some wimp in Washington pulled the plug&#34;. He encourages the boy to join the Army and &#34;kick butt&#34;. Platt is the undeniable leader of the bank robbing pair. The duo talk about their earlier robberies of drug dealers but Platt claims that drug dealers are too well-armed now and that they would be safer shooting it out with the police. It's a harbinger of things to come! The bank robberies continue and even increase in frequency. Platt even decides that the duo should rob the same bank twice in just a few days! The robbers use Army techniques like smoke screens and camofluage outfits complete with black ski masks. They are vicious in their misdeeds as they shoot and kill an armored car guard in the back just to rob him. They also steal cars for their robberies by ambushing target shooters in the Everglades. One of these robberies proves to be their undoing as their victim actually survives being shot several times and identifies the duo. This sets up the closing act which is simply unforgettable! The shootout between Platt/Matix and the FBI Funsters is something you won't soon forget. IMO it's much more memorable than the movie &#34;Heat&#34;. In fact I would rate this humble little TV movie as being much more satisfying and entertaining a movie than the big screen &#34;Heat&#34; with Deniro and Pacino. Just my opinion but I recommend this DVD if you can get it and like my title says it's fun to watch this movie repeatedly!",5,Great made for TV movie is good for multiple viewings!,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,4109,"['TV', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'TV', 'movies', '80s', 'movie', 'was', 'broadcast', '1988', 'based', 'real', 'event', '1986', 'movie', 'concerns', 'bank', 'robberies', 'perpetrated', 'two', 'former', 'Army', 'buddies', 'Miami', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'tail', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'establishing', 'two', 'sides', 'good', 'versus', 'bad', 'be', 'expected', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'stars', 'can', 'plainly', 'see', 'DVD', 'cover', 'two', 'baddies', 'are', 'played', 'TV', 'icons', '70s', '80s', 'Bill', 'Matix', 'played', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'Steven', 'Keaton', 'patriarch', 'sitcom', 'Family', 'Ties', 'partner', 'TV', 'crime', 'Mike', 'Platt', 'played', 'David', 'Soul', 'who', '70s', 'played', 'Detective', 'Hutch', 'cop', 'series', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'Mike', 'Bill', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'Army', 'who', 'remain', 'close', 'civilian', 'life', 'seem', 'be', 'landscape', 'business', 'have', 'series', 'other', 'ventures', 'chief', 'armed', 'robbery', 'shake', 'down', 'man', 'who', 'sold', 'broken', 'pinball', 'machines', 'spur', 'moment', 'become', 'bank', 'robbers', 'jacking', 'armored', 'car', 'get', 'little', 'money', 'appetite', 'bank', 'robbing', 'whetted', 'so', 'set', 'forth', 'crime', 'spree', 'Miami', 'heels', 'quickly', 'FBI', 'more', 'specifically', 'special', 'team', 'force', 'dubbed', '34', 'Funsters', '34', 'first', 'meet', 'rookie', 'member', 'Agent', 'Dove', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'just', 'started', 'FBI', 'career', 'introduced', 'commander', 'Agent', 'Grogan', 'played', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'establishing', 'rapport', 'chemistry', 'FBI', 'agents', 'are', 'drab', 'good', 'guys', 'viewer', 'sense', 'men', 'genuinely', 'other', 'working', 'together', 'are', 'decent', 'dedicated', 'lawmen', 'who', 'play', 'rules', 'then', 'go', 'home', 'families', 'antagonists', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'sneaky', 'sly', 'particular', 'Gross', 'character', 'Matix', 'seen', 'church', 'preaching', 'how', '34', 'good', 'Lord', '34', 'blessed', 'new', 'family', 'Matix', 'last', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'investigation', 'still', 'trailing', 'viewer', 'enough', 'clues', 'figure', 'out', 'Matix', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'murder', 'new', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'now', 'pregnant', 'Matix', 'point', 'telling', 'woman', 'leave', 'good', 'middle', 'movie', 'Matix', 'new', 'gf', 'named', 'Vicky', 'played', '80s', 'starlet', 'Teri', 'Copley', 'Soul', 'character', 'Platt', 'more', 'stable', 'environment', 'home', 'Platt', 'literally', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'who', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'potential', 'violence', 'stepson', 'was', 'trained', 'Vietnam', '34', 'wimp', 'Washington', 'pulled', 'plug', '34', 'boy', 'join', 'Army', '34', 'kick', 'butt', '34', 'Platt', 'undeniable', 'leader', 'bank', 'robbing', 'pair', 'duo', 'talk', 'earlier', 'robberies', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Platt', 'drug', 'dealers', 'are', 'too', 'well-armed', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'safer', 'shooting', 'police', 'harbinger', 'things', 'come', 'bank', 'robberies', 'continue', 'even', 'increase', 'frequency', 'Platt', 'even', 'duo', 'should', 'rob', 'same', 'bank', 'twice', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'robbers', 'use', 'Army', 'techniques', 'smoke', 'screens', 'camofluage', 'outfits', 'complete', 'black', 'ski', 'masks', 'are', 'vicious', 'misdeeds', 'shoot', 'kill', 'armored', 'car', 'guard', 'back', 'just', 'rob', 'also', 'steal', 'cars', 'robberies', 'ambushing', 'target', 'shooters', 'Everglades', 'One', 'robberies', 'be', 'undoing', 'victim', 'actually', 'being', 'shot', 'several', 'times', 'duo', 'up', 'closing', 'act', 'simply', 'unforgettable', 'shootout', 'Platt/Matix', 'FBI', 'Funsters', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'IMO', 'much', 'more', 'memorable', 'movie', '34', 'Heat', '34', 'fact', 'would', 'rate', 'humble', 'little', 'TV', 'movie', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', '34', 'Heat', '34', 'Deniro', 'Pacino', 'Just', 'opinion', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'can', 'get', 'title', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'repeatedly']",In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders
