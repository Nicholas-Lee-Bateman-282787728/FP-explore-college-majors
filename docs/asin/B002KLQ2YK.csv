1275104,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B002KLQ2YK,Compay,"[1, 1]","The Echo is a remake of the 2004 Filipino horror flick ""Sigaw"", also shot by director Yam Laranas.  While it's a visually impressive movie, I was a bit let down at its lack of originality.What's enjoyable about this film is that it's an atmospheric thriller.  Laranas has a quality cast to work with, and offers good visuals.The film also shines an interesting spotlight at what's known as the ""Bystander Effect.""  The Echo takes a page from real life examples of this effect, which had really occurred with New Yorkers such as Kitty Genovese.The problem is that aside from that psychological effect, the film's concept just isn't original.  Countless other horror flicks have used the ""right a wrong to end the curse"" theme.  The Ring, The Grudge, Flatliners, Sometimes They Come Back.The whole point of showing what happens when people don't help others is wasted thanks to the randomness of the victims (a witnessing neighbor is spared, yet a random visitor isn't).  The film also drags on, making the audience wait a little too long for the payoff.So while it was shot well, this would have been a much more enjoyable movie had it incorporated a more unique concept.  I'd suggest renting it before you consider buying the DVD.",3,Shot Well - But Borrows From Too Many Movies,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,1230,"['Echo', 'remake', '2004', 'Filipino', 'horror', 'flick', 'Sigaw', 'also', 'shot', 'director', 'Yam', 'Laranas', 'visually', 'impressive', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'lack', 'originality.What', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'Laranas', 'quality', 'cast', 'work', 'good', 'visuals.The', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'spotlight', 'what', 'known', 'Bystander', 'Effect', 'Echo', 'page', 'real', 'life', 'examples', 'effect', 'had', 'really', 'occurred', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'such', 'Kitty', 'Genovese.The', 'problem', 'aside', 'psychological', 'effect', 'film', 'concept', 'just', ""n't"", 'original', 'Countless', 'other', 'horror', 'flicks', 'have', 'used', 'right', 'wrong', 'end', 'curse', 'theme', 'Ring', 'Grudge', 'Flatliners', 'Sometimes', 'Come', 'Back.The', 'whole', 'point', 'showing', 'what', 'when', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'others', 'wasted', 'thanks', 'randomness', 'victims', 'witnessing', 'neighbor', 'spared', 'yet', 'random', 'visitor', ""n't"", 'film', 'also', 'making', 'audience', 'wait', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'payoff.So', 'was', 'shot', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'had', 'incorporated', 'more', 'unique', 'concept', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'renting', 'consider', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A

Recently out of prison, he's trying to put his life back together. He moves into his recently deceased mother's apartment and weird stuff starts happening. He's seeing and hearing things that, as it turns out, are not really happening. But his girlfriend and others in the building are experiencing the same hallucinations involving a resident cop who may have beaten his wife to death. So what's the scoop?That's where the movie falters. It does a decent enough job of building things and planting clues, but in any movie of this sort everything usually builds to a punchline. Here the punchline never comes. The movie just sort of stops and things aren't resolved.This has a lot going for it. The performances are good. The set direction is great. The building where most events take place is an old New York City building long in need of repair. Everything has a run down, decrepit feeling to it which adds to the overall sense of despair. The shuddering, Japanese style, ghostly apparitions have been overplayed in too many horror movies as of late. Thank God they keep it to a minimum here. But, overall, this has a good look and feel to it. The music score is good and, overall, it's a very professional effort.

No teens trapped in a mental home or the woods being chased by silly looking, hillbilly cannibals or an apparently immortal, deranged serial killer. THE ECHO mostly takes place in a poor tenement environment that is both bleak & believable (although why the lead actor doesn't bolt at the first sign of horror is anyone's quess, but then we wouldn't have a movie, would we?)On the DVD jacket we learn that ECHO has the same executive producers who backed THE GRUDGE, and you can see elements in this film--good, scary images.Again, the actors are excellent, playing REAL people. For example, the lead character is Bobby, a shortish, butch--yet sensitive. In one scene his boss in the auto repair shop accuses him of pilfering $300 & fires him. He doesn't want to fire Bobby, but his hands are tied in the matter considering how hard he worked to get the place of opening his own shop. Later when he goes to (I think) rehire Bobby, he can't find him--but does run into some very malicious little ghosts with attitude. You find yourself rooting for him because he's a nice guy, but unfortunately...My only problem with the film (and I felt this was true of THE GRUDGE as well) was a sense that the script was not as fully developed as it could be, but then the characterizations & actors are good enough & the terror well done enough to pretty much overcome this.I recommend THE ECHO for renting & for collection purchase.",4,Very Engaging Horror,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,1531,"['ECHO', 'great', 'elements', 'going', 'strong', 'characterizations', 'actors', 'can', 'easily', 'identify', 'teens', 'trapped', 'mental', 'home', 'woods', 'being', 'chased', 'silly', 'looking', 'hillbilly', 'cannibals', 'apparently', 'immortal', 'deranged', 'serial', 'killer', 'ECHO', 'mostly', 'place', 'poor', 'tenement', 'environment', 'bleak', 'believable', 'why', 'lead', 'actor', ""n't"", 'bolt', 'first', 'sign', 'horror', 'anyone', 'quess', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'would', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'learn', 'ECHO', 'same', 'executive', 'producers', 'who', 'backed', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'can', 'see', 'elements', 'film', 'good', 'scary', 'images.Again', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'playing', 'REAL', 'people', 'example', 'lead', 'character', 'Bobby', 'shortish', 'butch', 'yet', 'sensitive', 'one', 'scene', 'boss', 'auto', 'repair', 'shop', 'pilfering', '300', 'fires', ""n't"", 'want', 'fire', 'Bobby', 'hands', 'are', 'tied', 'matter', 'considering', 'how', 'hard', 'worked', 'get', 'place', 'opening', 'own', 'shop', 'Later', 'when', 'think', 'rehire', 'Bobby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'run', 'very', 'malicious', 'little', 'ghosts', 'attitude', 'find', 'rooting', 'nice', 'guy', 'unfortunately', 'My', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'true', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'well', 'was', 'sense', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'could', 'be', 'then', 'characterizations', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'terror', 'well', 'done', 'enough', 'pretty', 'much', 'this.I', 'recommend', 'ECHO', 'renting', 'collection', 'purchase']",N/A

Thus, I rented it (I do like to see these things without silly blocking and commercials) and sat down with it over the weekend to see if it lived up to its promise. Then, in the opening credits, I saw ""produced by Roy Lee"", and figured I'd hate it. Lee has been responsible for about half the unbearable slew of remakes that have come out of Hollywood in the past five years, and most of them have been worthless. Which made it all the more surprising when this one was actually about as good as I had originally expected it to be.The Echo, based on the Filipino film Sigaw and directed by the original director, is the story of Bobby (Jesse Bradford, a solid character actor you've seen in at least a dozen films; Bring It On, Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, Flags of Our Fathers, many others), who just got out of prison and moves into the East Village roach motel his late mother used to live in while trying to get his life back together. He's working on that, gets himself a job and starts kinda-sorta hooking back up with his old girlfriend, but he's getting really, really annoyed at the cop who lives nextdoor who's always beating on his wife and kid. But there's a problem: when he finally calls the cops and gets a domestic unit sent out to take a report, there's no one in the apartment...Laranas (Patient X) was, at least in the remake (I haven't seen the original yet, will soon), heavily influenced by the Kitty Genovese case; its invisible, historical fingerprints are smeared all over this script. That may end up being a bit of a spoiler, though once Bobby understands what he's dealing with, there's no real secret about what needs to be done about it (one of the movie's best scenes is a confrontation between Bobby and the only other person living on the floor, a recluse played by Pruitt Taylor Vince); in this regard, the film is something of a letdown, because the only real suspense to be had is whether Bobby's got the cojones to do what needs to be done. On the other hand, as far as American remakes of Asian horror films go, this is one of the few from the past few years that hasn't either been markedly inferior or simply unnecessary. If you're wondering whether any of those still exist, pick this up and have your faith bolstered, if only a little. ***",3,Better than expected.,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,2388,"['Echo', 'Yam', 'Laranas', '2008', 'saw', 'trailers', 'Echo', 'Chiller', 'TV', 'actually', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'Thus', 'rented', 'do', 'see', 'things', 'silly', 'blocking', 'commercials', 'sat', 'down', 'weekend', 'see', 'lived', 'up', 'promise', 'Then', 'opening', 'credits', 'saw', 'produced', 'Roy', 'Lee', 'figured', ""'d"", 'hate', 'Lee', 'been', 'responsible', 'unbearable', 'slew', 'remakes', 'have', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'worthless', 'made', 'more', 'surprising', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'originally', 'expected', 'be.The', 'Echo', 'based', 'Filipino', 'film', 'Sigaw', 'directed', 'original', 'director', 'story', 'Bobby', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'solid', 'character', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'dozen', 'films', 'Bring', 'Luhrmann', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'prison', 'moves', 'East', 'Village', 'roach', 'motel', 'late', 'mother', 'used', 'live', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'working', 'job', 'kinda-sorta', 'hooking', 'back', 'up', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'getting', 'really', 'really', 'annoyed', 'cop', 'who', 'nextdoor', 'who', 'always', 'beating', 'wife', 'kid', 'problem', 'when', 'finally', 'cops', 'domestic', 'unit', 'sent', 'out', 'take', 'report', 'one', 'apartment', 'Laranas', 'Patient', 'X', 'was', 'least', 'remake', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'yet', 'will', 'soon', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Kitty', 'Genovese', 'case', 'invisible', 'historical', 'fingerprints', 'are', 'smeared', 'script', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'bit', 'spoiler', 'once', 'Bobby', 'what', 'dealing', 'real', 'secret', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'scenes', 'confrontation', 'Bobby', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'living', 'floor', 'recluse', 'played', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'regard', 'film', 'something', 'letdown', 'only', 'real', 'suspense', 'be', 'had', 'Bobby', 'got', 'cojones', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'other', 'hand', 'as', 'far', 'American', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'go', 'one', 'few', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""n't"", 'either', 'been', 'markedly', 'inferior', 'simply', 'unnecessary', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'still', 'exist', 'pick', 'up', 'have', 'faith', 'bolstered', 'only', 'little', '***']",N/A

I guess it does depending on whether you want to be jumping out of your seat from scene one, or let the movie build to keep you interested in what's about to happen next. I liked the way it built up because it held my interest to try and figure out what was going to happen next.'The Echo' is not your typical ghost/paranormal/horror movie. Yet it still has just enough elements of all three. I don't want to say too much about the movie because I don't want to give anything away or spoil it for others. What I will say is this has every element of every scary movie, every ghost movie, and every creepy paranormal movie. The only difference is it's done in a way that actually has a point and real meaning beyond a curse or an angry spirit terrorizing ppl just for the sake of being creepy.There's a real sense of purpose and meaning to what's going on that we don't find out until the end. Anyone who says this movie is predictable is wrong. I highly and strongly recommend 'The Echo' for anyone who likes this genre to begin with.

1275125,A1ISW6NMR45Y71,B002KLQ2YK,Tome Raider,"[0, 1]","I rented this off of Netflix with limited expectations.  It seems nowadays I  am disappointed far more often than pleased when it comes to horror films.  I just can not stand all the blood-and-guts and other tired cliches which are apparently the common denominators of the current horror genre.From the beginning this film grips you with a character you can empathize with.  He has just been released from prison: so he has few friends, no credibility, and you know he will be the first suspect in any conflict which may cross his path.  And yet, we can see almost immediately that he is fundamentally a good guy, a decent person.I especially liked the fellow ex-con who hires him for a job.  I didn't make note of this actor's name, but he totally hammered the role.  This is one of those guys who has made mistakes and is pulling himself up by the bootstraps to pay for it for the rest of his life.  And, he wants to help others who want to help themselves.  He sees good in our protagonist, and wants to help him re-integrate into society.The ex-girlfriend is beautiful and kind, and she feels guilty that she played a role in setting the stage for the crime which sent our man to prison.  Can they reconcile?  We hope so, right from the beginning.Other reviewers have explained the plot.  I'll only say that I thought the atmospherics were first rate.  I had goose bumps on my skin for a good portion of the movie.What makes this movie really stand out, in my mind, is the vivid ""moral to the story"" which is clarified in the end.  The ghosts here needed something which they were never given in life. I thought it was a keen reminder that we all have an obligation to keep an eye out for one another.  Normally I don't watch horror movies for any type of ""moral guidance,"" but I thought this was so artfully presented that it knocked this movie from ""solid contender"" to ""top tier.""I collect horror movies (the good ones anyway), and I will definitely be buying this for my collection.

1275126,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B002KLQ2YK,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[1, 2]","I would say that this belongs in the ""horror-extremely lite"" genre, though it's more in the range of a ghost tale than towards the slasher range of the spectrum. As I'm more inclined to watch ghost stories, finding psychological motivation (sadness, betrayal, untimely death, etc.) behind paranormal activity more stimulating to view in a film than just a series of shocking visuals thrown together, I don't mind that. If you don't want a movie filled with foul language (it doesn't matter to me one way or the other, but it does to some people, so that's why I bring it up), this could be the film for you. There's no nudity in it. By today's standards, the shock value of what few graphic scenes that there are is very minimal. I can't say that I jumped or was even surprised once while viewing this, let alone did it scare me or even stay w/ me for a bit afterwards. It isn't a movie that's likely to make you keeping lingering over the details when you're done watching it.I found myself viewing the film from an actor's standpoint, at least in terms of the protagonist's character. I thought he could've been a little bit more ""animated"" in places, and in the beginning, he was just downright boring- but, overall, this wasn't a horrifically-acted film. Carlos Leon, while no Olivier, was certainly passable in playing the main characters' boss, and was a sympathetic guy here. Leon has a surprising ""presence"" to him, which is about the only thing that stood out to me in the movie. The girl who played the main character's on-again, off-again girlfriend, while attractive enough, wasn't anyone who'll sets the world on fire. Again, she gave a passable performance, but not memorable. Character development was quite one-dimensional here, so I don't necessarily fault the actors- but better actors could've perhaps bumped this from a two-star movie to a three-star film.I did think that the movie (unsurprisingly, considering who made it) was very similar in setting to ""Dark Water"", though was less effective in the creepiness department. I didn't find ""Dark Water"" scary, either, but at least it was slightly better at character development & plot than this was- not great, but better. Hoepfully, that'll give you a point of reference (if you've seen Dark Water, that is!) If you're expecting something as good as ""The Grudge"" or ""The Ring""- look elsewhere! This is a low-budget flick, and could pass for a made-for-television one (which maybe it was & I just don't know it). It's not the worst film I've ever seen, and I've most definitely seen worse acting & plots in my life. The main character was easy enough to empathize with after a bit. The plot was fairly predictable, and the ""motivations"" on the part of the main ghoulies were definitely stretched beyond anything reasonable, raised more questions than answers & it all was laced w/ inconsistency. But if you just want to look at a flick, to get you through a boring evening, you could do worse than this.",2,"Not especially scary, but nice not to see a ridiculous amount of gore, violence or foul language used",1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2974,"['would', 'say', 'horror-extremely', 'lite', 'genre', 'more', 'range', 'ghost', 'tale', 'towards', 'slasher', 'range', 'spectrum', ""'m"", 'more', 'inclined', 'watch', 'ghost', 'stories', 'finding', 'psychological', 'motivation', 'sadness', 'betrayal', 'untimely', 'death', 'etc', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'more', 'stimulating', 'view', 'film', 'just', 'series', 'shocking', 'visuals', 'thrown', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'filled', 'foul', 'language', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'people', 'why', 'bring', 'up', 'could', 'be', 'film', 'nudity', 'today', 'standards', 'shock', 'value', 'what', 'few', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'minimal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'jumped', 'was', 'even', 'surprised', 'once', 'viewing', 'let', 'alone', 'did', 'scare', 'even', 'stay', 'bit', 'afterwards', ""n't"", 'movie', 'likely', 'make', 'keeping', 'lingering', 'details', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'watching', 'it.I', 'found', 'viewing', 'film', 'actor', 'standpoint', 'least', 'terms', 'protagonist', 'character', 'thought', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'animated', 'places', 'beginning', 'was', 'just', 'downright', 'boring-', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrifically-acted', 'film', 'Carlos', 'Leon', 'Olivier', 'was', 'certainly', 'passable', 'playing', 'main', 'characters', 'boss', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'guy', 'here', 'Leon', 'surprising', 'presence', 'only', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'movie', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'character', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'girlfriend', 'attractive', 'enough', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'who', ""'ll"", 'sets', 'world', 'fire', 'Again', 'gave', 'passable', 'performance', 'not', 'memorable', 'Character', 'development', 'was', 'quite', 'one-dimensional', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fault', 'actors-', 'better', 'actors', 'could', ""'ve"", 'perhaps', 'bumped', 'two-star', 'movie', 'three-star', 'film.I', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'unsurprisingly', 'considering', 'who', 'made', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'setting', 'Dark', 'Water', 'was', 'less', 'effective', 'creepiness', 'department', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Dark', 'Water', 'scary', 'either', 'least', 'was', 'slightly', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'was-', 'not', 'great', 'better', 'Hoepfully', ""'ll"", 'give', 'point', 'reference', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dark', 'Water', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'as', 'good', 'Grudge', 'Ring', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'low-budget', 'flick', 'could', 'pass', 'made-for-television', 'one', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'worst', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'most', 'definitely', 'seen', 'worse', 'acting', 'plots', 'life', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'easy', 'enough', 'empathize', 'bit', 'plot', 'was', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'motivations', 'part', 'main', 'ghoulies', 'were', 'definitely', 'stretched', 'anything', 'reasonable', 'raised', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'was', 'laced', 'w/', 'inconsistency', 'just', 'want', 'look', 'flick', 'get', 'boring', 'evening', 'could', 'do', 'worse']",N/A
