The film, like most straight-up action films released this year, disappeared from the theaters pretty quickly. It has my kind of cast in Jason, J.Lo, Nolte, and Chiklis. An action film with a good cast, usually means I'm gonna like it. I actually liked it better than I thought I would.I know nothing of the novels, so I can't judge it from it. I've been pleasantly surprised by the props I see Statham getting. The action genre isn't generally one that gets a lot of praise, but I also feel Jason Statham is underrated as an actor, and doesn't get the general props he deserves. This is a film that could have been pretty routine, but Statham gives it a little something more. I thought J. Lo's character gave the film a different female angle than most films in general. I liked the twist even if others didn't. I do like action films that have a little humor to them, and thought both J. Lo and surprising even Statham added some much needed humor to a film that was otherwise pretty violent and dark. I believe Michael Chiklis is was of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. I don't think there is any part that guy can't play.I would consider this a definite buy. I can't say this is the most positive action hero film I've ever seen. Statham's character, IMO, really isn't a nice guy.  Not even sure I can say he's the lesser of the 4 evils in the films. I think that is what I really liked about the film though.

1488225,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B005LAIILM,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[0, 1]","""Parker"". . .This was an extraordinarily bad film adaptation of crime novelist Donald Westlake's ultimate antihero, the hardass heistman named Parker.  The movie starts out halfway okay, and cascades into shrill, dense, badly choreographed, badly scripted, emotionally inert violence. It's a pity: the Parker character is one of crime fiction's best, and deserved much, much better than this overly obvious, clumsily made, incredibly trite, by-the-numbers tedium.  Lead actor Jason Stratham tries his best to summon the seething cool of the main character, and had he been better framed, perhaps he might have succeeded. He is hobbled by co-star Jennifer Lopez who comes to dominate the film midway through, and she is pure cinematic death -- overacting, over-emoting, endlessly whiny and shrill, and hard for viewers to feel sympathy for. The script devolves into excessive exposition, punctuated by brisk, soulless violence.None of the stylishness the character original Parker stories are built on was present here -- partly this may be due to the choice to place the story in the crass confines of the present day, rather in the original Eisenhower/Kennedy-era setting.

1488238,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B005LAIILM,Brian Maitland,"[0, 0]","I had no idea who this Parker was going in but it is based on a series of crime novels by Donald Westlake. The first thing that pops into mind when the movie starts with this great awe-inspiring shot of the Ohio State Fair amusement rides is this is going to be one thrilling ride. The other two locations of New Orleans and Palm Beach, Florida, really are also ""stars"" in this movie and bring a lot to the story.The story does move but word of warning, for this violent genre, it is incredibly bloody. Honestly, I think that's a good thing as often violence in crime noir movies can be cartoonish and people get hurt or die with very little pain. The fight and shoot-'em-up scenes seem incredibly real.Statham is again playing a role he's made for. The cast all-around is brilliant from Nick Nolte playing Parker's dad to the guy from Repo Man who did all his best thinking on the bus as one of Michael Chiklis's crew of thieves.Finally, seeing Jennifer Lopez in this you'll be reminded of her role in Out Of Sight. It also sparked me to reassess (assess in the first place even) J-Lo's acting career. Look, I'm a child of the New Wave and listen to The Raveonettes in 2013 so I'm not exactly in the J-Lo lamestream pop demo but acting-wise she really is not getting her due. OK, she won awards for playing the Tejano singer Selena but I'm talking everything from her crime noir roles to her role as a newsreporter in Bordertown to her comedic turn in Maid In Manhattan. I mean, the woman can act period and has range. Sure, there are the jokes about the box office bomb in Gigli, but isn't it about time we start heaping praise on how good Jennifer Lopez is as an actress?In this she plays a world-weary divorced woman back living with her crazy, but wise, mother (brilliantly played by Patti LuPone) who is run ragged at a real estate agency in Palm Beach. I didn't buy how quickly she trusted Parker but I got over it and went with where the movie wanted to take us.All in all, despite the lukewarm reviews when this came out, if you like Statham, crime noir and an action pic with good dialogue and some nice twists, this is worth your time. Now five stars is high praise; just don't expect cinematic greatness. For the genre it's five stars.Extras are only a Making Of which is just a run-of-the-mill short really.",5,some obvious plot holes but still good noir,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,2320,"['had', 'idea', 'who', 'Parker', 'was', 'going', 'based', 'series', 'crime', 'novels', 'Donald', 'Westlake', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'when', 'movie', 'great', 'awe-inspiring', 'shot', 'Ohio', 'State', 'Fair', 'amusement', 'rides', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'thrilling', 'ride', 'other', 'two', 'locations', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Florida', 'really', 'are', 'also', 'stars', 'movie', 'bring', 'lot', 'story.The', 'story', 'move', 'word', 'warning', 'violent', 'genre', 'incredibly', 'bloody', 'Honestly', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'often', 'violence', 'crime', 'noir', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'cartoonish', 'people', 'get', 'hurt', 'die', 'very', 'little', 'pain', 'fight', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'scenes', 'seem', 'incredibly', 'real.Statham', 'again', 'playing', 'role', 'made', 'cast', 'all-around', 'brilliant', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'playing', 'Parker', 'dad', 'guy', 'Repo', 'Man', 'who', 'did', 'best', 'thinking', 'bus', 'one', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'crew', 'thieves.Finally', 'seeing', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reminded', 'role', 'Out', 'Sight', 'also', 'sparked', 'reassess', 'assess', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'J-Lo', 'acting', 'career', 'Look', ""'m"", 'child', 'New', 'Wave', 'listen', 'Raveonettes', '2013', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'J-Lo', 'lamestream', 'pop', 'demo', 'acting-wise', 'really', 'not', 'getting', 'due', 'OK', 'won', 'awards', 'playing', 'Tejano', 'singer', 'Selena', ""'m"", 'talking', 'everything', 'crime', 'noir', 'roles', 'role', 'newsreporter', 'Bordertown', 'comedic', 'turn', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'mean', 'woman', 'can', 'act', 'period', 'range', 'Sure', 'are', 'jokes', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'Gigli', ""n't"", 'time', 'start', 'heaping', 'praise', 'how', 'good', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'actress', 'world-weary', 'divorced', 'woman', 'back', 'living', 'crazy', 'wise', 'mother', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Patti', 'LuPone', 'who', 'run', 'ragged', 'real', 'estate', 'agency', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'how', 'quickly', 'trusted', 'Parker', 'got', 'went', 'where', 'movie', 'wanted', 'take', 'us.All', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'like', 'Statham', 'crime', 'noir', 'action', 'pic', 'good', 'dialogue', 'nice', 'twists', 'time', 'Now', 'five', 'stars', 'high', 'praise', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'cinematic', 'greatness', 'genre', 'five', 'stars.Extras', 'are', 'only', 'Making', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'short', 'really']",Parker

Jason Statham can do the action, but then again, don't look for the fancy fight choreography of the first Transporter, 'cause you won't find it here.  Nick Nolte is his aging mentor/almost father-in-law ... but he looks like he is going to have a stroke in every scene - which just made me nervous.  Emma Booth is his girlfriend, but not sure if the film shows enough of the back-story to make this character necessary - in fact the whole subplot of Jennifer Lopez (a realtor Parker uses to find the people who double crossed him)/girlfriend/Parker is kind of underdeveloped and just sort of muddies the film, forget about the attempt to flesh out Lopez's relationship with her mother .... Michael Chiklis and crew are serviceable baddies, but do some very stupid things ... like sending a guy they obviously don't trust to finish off Parker.  Then again, if he had just walked up and shot him in the head a few times the movie would have been over in 15 minutes.

It's not that it's a bad movie; it just feels like it has direct-to-DVD (I hesitate to say Blu-ray) production.  The script leaves a lot to be desired; PAYBACK (the director's cut) did a much better job of capturing Donald Westlake's character, and presented a much more engaging atmosphere; here, Statham--usually charismatic, and actually a good actor--is forced to utter awful one-liners that seem like throwaways; you can even see him fighting a wince on a few occasions.The plot is almost nonexistent, which isn't such a big deal.  Parker is crossed and left for dead; he comes back for vengeance.  Sound familiar?  The story is slow-burning for a Statham vehicle (he's miscast), which actually gives the supporting cast (especially Michael Chiklis and Micah Hauptman) time to shine.  In a random third-act appearance, Jennifer Lopez is delightful; her character interrupts the story and is utterly pointless, but the actress is in fine form.  Taylor Hackford's direction is uneven; certain moments have a nice creative spark--Statham makes for the world's most menacing priest--but much of the film feels clunky.  Better dialogue would have helped; another actor in the lead role couldn't have hurt, either.  No offense to Statham--when it comes to action movies, few do it better these days, and every now and then he'll give us a drama to prove he's got the chops--but he's miscast, and the film suffers.

Westlake (using the pseudonym Richard Stark) would create 24 novels featuring a relentless and remorseless professional thief known as Parker.While the first novel ""The Hunter"" was adapted into the 1967 film ""Point Blank"" and later in 1999 for ""Payback"", many of the novels would feature Parker who worked with other professionals to pull of a variety of heists, the books would feature the dangerous situations and the careful planning of Parker and others to pull of a heist, but also going after people who have tried to kill him including those who represent major crime syndicates.In 2000, Richard Stark's 19th novel ""Flashfire"" would receive a film adaptation by filmmaker Taylor Hackford (""The Devil's Advocate"", ""Ray"", ""Proof of Life"")  and a screenplay by John J. McLaughlin (""Black Swan"", ""Man of the House"", ""Hitchcock"").The film would star Jason Statham (""The Transporter"", ""Snatch"", ""Crank""), Jennifer Lopez (""Main in Manhattan"", ""Monster-in-Law"", ""Out of Sight""), Michael Chicklis (""The Shield"", ""The Commish"", ""Fantastic Four"" films), Emma Booth (""The Boys are Back"", ""Blood Creek"", ""Introducing the Dwights""), Nick Nolte (""The Thin Red Line"", ""Warrior"", ""Hulk""), Clifton Collins (""Star Trek"", ""Mindhunters""), Bobby Cannavale (""Win Win"", ""The Bone Collector"", ""The Other Guys"") and Patti Lupone (""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Witness"", ""City by the Sea"").VIDEO:""Parker"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40: 1 aspect ratio).  It's important to note that the film didn't have a high budget but for the most part, the film does have wonderful detail when it comes to closeups of the talent, outdoor scenes, especially in Palm Beach look vibrant and colorful.  Black levels are nice and deep, I didn't notice any softness and for the most part, skin tones look natural and picture quality looks very good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As one can expect from an action-driven film, ""Parker"" shines with its lossless English 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack.  Great use of surround channels with scenes featuring large crowds, explosions are also heard via LFE and gun shots are crystal clear.  But the fight scene between Parker and Kroll is where surround usage is used effectively.  Dialogue is crystal clear and great use of ambiance for environments.Subtitles are in English SDH, English and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Parker"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary with director Taylor Hackford.Bringing the Hunter to Life: The Making of Parker - (7:28) Adapting  the novels for the big screen.

Jason Statham did many of the stunts featured in the film along with Daniel Bernhardt.Who is Parker - (2:32) A featurette about Parker and what Donald Westbrook accomplished with his novels.JUDGMENT CALL:I'm sure that when one creates a film based on a well-known and beloved crime novel series, you need to find a director who is passionate about the subject and make film true to its roots.  For filmmaker Taylor Hackford, there is no doubt that he was passionate about this film.But with that being said, one's passion and filmmaking ability can only go so far with the budget that you have to make the film.  The good news for this film is that Jason Statham is an action star that can pull off ""Parker"" with amazing efficacy.The problem lies within the story.  For the most part, ""Parker"" is able to have its fair share of success and failures for several reasons.The story of ""Parker"" definitely goes into details of a seasoned veteran when it comes to pulling off major heists.  Based on the 19th novel in the series, perhaps the film could have explained Parker's history much more, especially his relationship with Hurley and Claire.  Claire has played a big part in the novels, but for ""Parker"", her character is limited to a girlfriend who patches him up when he's injured.The acting for the film has its moments of ups but also its moments of downs, Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Chiklis and even the short time that Patti Lupone is in the film, all do a great job, but somehow with the acting and certain scenes that were chosen (such as the closing scene for the film), it made the film seem like a popcorn action B-movie, and with Statham and Lopez as your headlining talent, I suppose part of me was expect a popcorn action A-movie.While the film is interesting as the protagonist, Parker, is a criminal with a moral code, yet won't hesitate to killing people if they go against his code, the storyline is quite average.  We know the man is bent on revenge after being shot and being left for dead.  It's just that you want more from the story than what you are actually getting.Thus, we have Jennifer Lopez as Leslie, the other side of the coin to headliners in this film.  A woman who is down on her luck, can't make enough money and she is depressed about her life.  Until she meets Parker.  There is sexual chemistry with Parker and Leslie, but it was already established that Parker is a one-woman guy and his heart is for Claire.  But the stupid decision made by Leslie and how she gets herself involved and into trouble is just so ridiculous.  But I suppose that is something about money, some people will sacrifice their life for it.  And Leslie is so down on her luck, she would put her self in the path of getting killed in order to make sure that Parker does his job right.The pacing of the film also tries to give us flashbacks of Parker's past.  For what reason?  Granted, this film is based on the 19th novel, while the first has been done before via Mel Gibson's ""Payback"" but perhaps, if the director wanted us to know more about the past of Parker and how he met Claire, the film to kick things off with is how those two met and then this film become a sequel.While I prefer a bit more suspense to the banal revenge film, you do get comedy, you do get to see Jennifer Lopez strip down to her bra and panties (and still looking as amazing as ever) and those who dig that and the action sequences (which are fantastic, especially the fight between Parker and Kroll), you're left with a good popcorn action film.But I suppose that with Statham films, you want to see kick-ass action, you want to see great fight choreography and the storyline tries to support it.  But based on Donald E. Westlake's (via his pseudonym Richard Stark) well-known novel series, there is too much story about Parker that has yet to be told.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is very good, lossless soundtrack is fantastic and you also get five special features, two which are exclusive on Blu-ray.Overall, ""Parker"" is a Jason Statham film that does lives up to its action and gritty storyline.  While it may not be the perfect film based on one of Donald E. Westlake's novels nor is it Statham's best action film so far, it does deliver in popcorn action that fans come to expect from a Statham film.",3,"""Parker"" is a Jason Statham film that does lives up

1488303,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005LAIILM,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","The quote at the top is the unique code of thief Parker (Jason Statham) and that code along with genuine concern and appreciation for those in need is what makes this character an interesting diversion from not only Staham's usual roles but also brings a sense humanity to the role of criminal that is embedded in the Parker character from the double named author Donald E. Westlake/Richard Stark has created in a series of books. The concept works and gets us through an otherwise rather repetitious, excessively long on action/short on plot movie. Taylor Hackford works with a fine cast but the characters from John J. McLaughlin's screenplay could have been cast by far less expensive actors and no one would have noticed the difference.Parker is asked to join 4 other guys - Michael Chiklis, Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins Jr. and Micah A. Hauptman - to pull of a theft during an Ohio State Fair. They pull off the job flawlessly and Parker wants to part ways with them. But because he refused to join them for another job (one involving stealing millions of dollars of diamonds to be auctioned for charity) they try to kill him. They dispose of his body but a sweet country couple finds him and he is still alive and takes him to the hospital. After recovering he sets out to get back at the ones who tried to kill him, another one of his codes. He learns where they are (West Palm Beach) and poses as a wealthy Texan looking to buy a house. He hires a Realtor, Leslie Rogers (Jennifer Lopez) to show him around (Lopez silly cranky mother is a bit part for Patti LuPone). He is actually trying to find out where they're holed up. And when he finds it, he sets out on his plan to get them. But when they learn he is alive, they contact the mobster to take care of him. So he sends a killer to take care of him.One of the puzzling sidebars is Parker's relationship with his girlfriend Claire (Emma Both) whose father Hurley (Nick Nolte) seems somehow involved and approving of Parker's occupation. The presence of Claire prevents any love relationship with Lesley and that rather negates the need to have cast Jennifer in a fairly flimsy role. Adding Bobby Cannavale (a fine actor) in a toss away bit part also makes little sense. But the film is like that - motivational elements are often missing or contradicted making the plot a bit difficult to follow. Couple that with the fact that view of the actors enunciate clearly enough to understand what they are saying and those are some of the reasons the movie just doesn't make it big. For fans of Jason Statham action flicks this will satisfy.  It just could have been tighter in budget with unknown actors in most of the parts and edited down a step to maintain the audience's attention span.

(It's not the money, it's the principal!) This is a series of heists, each one planned to the nth degree and carried out with cold-blooded precision.This R-rated thriller only pauses occasionally to introduce another character and maybe have a few laughs. We dash from a state fair (where our hero is a priest!), to Florida where he poses as a wealthy Ecuadorean-born Texan. You're gonna have to trust me on that! There are also some nice scenes with a farm couple and with a hospital patient.We see:* Jason Statham (""Safe"") Guess who plays the title role? Yup. He is beaten, shot, stabbed, and choked, but this dependable old Timex just keeps on ticking...* Jennifer Lopez (""The Back-up Plan"") seems to be in this just to provide occasional squeals of fear, tears of frustration over her recent divorce and groans of exasperation about her soap opera-watching mom. She's actually not too bad this time.* Patti Lupone (""30 Rock"" on TV) almost steals the show in her few scenes. Between her and her darling little dog (maybe a Papillon?) she makes us laugh out loud!* Michael Chiklis (""Vegas"" on TV) is the head thug who betrays our hero. This guy is mean!* Nick Nolte (""Gangster Squad"") is a quasi father-in-law. No, our hero isn't married, but almost!* Emma Booth (""The Boys are Back"") is resourceful and loving as the nurse/lover our hero seems to need on a semi-regular basis.* Bobby Canavale (""Boardwalk Empire"" on TV) is the sweet Palm Beach cop who has it bad for Ms. Lopez.With Jennifer Lopez in the cast, we KNOW they will exploit her physical attributes... smile ...which they DO! In addition, expect lots of gunfire, ferocious fisticuffs, stabbings, blood, blood and blood. We always know how a Jason Statham movie will end, but it's always lots of fun getting there.

1488338,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B005LAIILM,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","Parker is a character tailor-made for Jason Statham. Parker is a loner tough guy who can get a job done. Most of his jobs are of the illegal sort, but at least Parker has a moral code that puts him in the sympathetic-to-likable category. He doesn't steal from people who can't afford it and he doesn't hurt people who don't deserve it. Statham as Parker definitely has the skills to get things done without killing and has enough charm to make him seem almost like a good guy.The movie begins with a heist at the Ohio State Fair. The weekend ticket sales are somewhere between a million and 1.5 million dollars, making a good haul for five well-organized thieves. Parker does the organizing. The heist goes mostly without a hitch except one of the guys sets fire to hay bales by a stage rather than the live stock pens, which endangered some lives. The fire is only supposed to be a distraction that facilitates the getaway. The guy doesn't really care but Parker is ready to take his cut and dump these losers during the getaway.The problem is the other brainy guy in the group, Melander, has another heist he's ready to do but he needs all five guys. Parker declines. Melander decides Parker can't live if he knows about the plan (though the information about the plan is rather meager and doesn't really justify killing Parker). Naturally, when the four other guys try to kill Parker, he just about makes it out alive. After a brief gunfight, Parker jumps from the moving car but is knocked unconscious on the road. The guys stop and they send the guy who messed up the fire to shoot Parker dead. As you might imagine, he messes up the shooting, leaving Parker for dead rather than dead. Parker is discovered by a good Samaritan family who take him to a local hospital. Before he even recovers, he escapes the hospital and seeks revenge against the four that done him wrong. The trip will take him to some dodgy places in exotic locales like New Orleans and Miami as he tracks down their next heist in order to kill them.Jennifer Lopez is shoe-horned into the story as a Miami real estate agent who is pretty desperate. She drives Parker (who is posing as a wealthy Texan) around to various houses he might rent though he is actually trying to find the bad guys' hideout. When she finally figures out something of what he's up to, she helps him for a cut of the heist. Too bad for her Parker isn't interested so much in the heist or in her as a girlfriend (he's got one back in Chicago to whom he remains faithful, another check in the sympathetic-to-likable category). But he's an upstanding guy and by the end of the film he's taking care of her and the family who were good Samaritans to him.The movie Parker is much like the heists in the film. A somewhat clever set-up leads to a simple smash-and-grab of valuables with a getaway tagged on the end. I enjoyed it well enough. It had some good laughs and lots of hard-hitting Statham action. The fights get a little graphic and the consequences don't last for long. Parker had a knife jabbed through his hand which was a problem during the fight but later, after his girlfriend sews up the wound, everything is fine. Also, when he left the hospital after gun shot wounds and a concussion he was back in fighting form in a day or two. Realism isn't the movie's strong point or even something remotely close to what they've done. Sometimes stuff like that bothers me but other times I just go with it. Going in with low expectations is a requirement for this film. Mine were low enough to make it enjoyable but I'm not sure I can recommend it.Oh, and here's a fabulous line delivered perfectly by Statham when he's ""interrogating"" a guy with a bar stool: If you don't tell me what I need to know, I'm gonna press down on this chair until it crushes your trachea. Trust me, it's agonizing. Plus, there's the posthumous humiliation of having been killed with a chair.Parental advisory:  In addition to the dubious morality of all the characters except for the Samaritan family, there's lots of violence and bad language. And Parker makes sure Jennifer Lopez isn't wearing a wire when she offers to help him out. So we all get to see her in her underwear, which isn't a spoiler because it's in the trailer.

1488339,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005LAIILM,J. Richardson,"[0, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Every time we get word of another Jason Statham movie I try not to get my hopes up. As of late he seems to be pumping out one forgettable film after the next, but judging from the trailers for Parker, his latest effort looked promising. A lot of critics stated that the movie starts off strong and kind of loses its steam as it continues on, and I have to say I agree with that. Whether this is because of the source material or just a general lack of direction, Parker never seems to ignite into the action flick it should, and could have been. It has confidence and drive, but it lacks consistency.As if the title wasn't clear, you follow a man by the name of Parker (Statham), a thief who believes that the crime is forgivable so long as you don't steal from the poor and you don't hurt anyone in the process. He's a man with a set of rules which include the promise that if he says he will do something he will get it done - remind you of anyone? After performing a job with Melander (Michael Chiklis), Hardwicke (Micah A. Hauptman), Carlson (Wendell Pierce), and Ross (Clifton Collins, Jr.) things turn sour. During the theft a few things go wrong and Hardwicke screws up on his part. After refusing to assist these men in their next job, Parker is then beat, shot, and left for dead on the side of the rode. The movie continues from there as Parker attempts to get his revenge.On the less violent side of the movie you have Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez), a struggling real-estate agent who lives with her mother (Patti Lupone). After stealing a call from a co-worker, Leslie gets paired up with Parker as he ""looks for a house"". Unfortunately, her character, as well as her attraction to Parker, never goes anywhere. Leslie is flat and cliched as we see J. Lo struggle to make the character important. Sadly, after all her effort, Leslie still comes off as annoying, whiny, and utterly useless for the entire movie. Still, you have to give it to Lopez for the effort. She played the role well; unfortunately the role was annoying and forgettable.What really drives this film forward is Statham's ability to play the same role over and over again while still make it interesting to watch. We've seen this badass character before, we've seen Statham take out bad guys and get into brawls, but you can't complain because it's Statham. With that said, only a handful of these fights feel somewhat original. Most of them are the same thing we've seen in dozens of films before, only this time they look more stiff and scripted. Parker is probably not for the squeamish as we see Statham leaving a bloody mess after each fight - about every 20 minutes - and he has a knife protruding out of his hand for what seems like a decade.Which brings me to my last major point, the movie is just too long for its own good. Running at close to two hours, Parker is a film that feels long in its final 25 minutes or so. I had my fill at that point and I was ready for it to be over. To my dismay, Parker continued on and I sat there until the credits rolled. There were a handful of scenes that didn't really feel too important in the grand scheme of things and they could have arrived at the same scenarios without wasting the viewer's time. Short and sweet is the key to making films of this genre worthwhile. Anything more than that and it becomes tiresome and repetitive.Finally, I thought the casting was well done and everyone gave solid performances. I already mentioned Statham and Lopez, but the other four crooks, Chiklis in particular, were enjoyable to watch. What killed some of that enjoyment was the fact that they didn't really get a lot of screen time. They were never in a scene without the other three which left them receiving maybe 15 minutes of screen time, 20 minutes tops. You also got to see Nick Nolte play Parker's mentor Hurley. While he too didn't get a lot of screen time, he still delivered in the few scenes he found himself in.Overall Score: 6.5/10 - Parker is in no way a bad film, but it seems to lack something substantial. It isn't terribly memorable and it doesn't do a great job of utilizing the entire cast. Still, for what it's worth the fight scenes are nice and I found that it kept me on my toes throughout majority of its running time.

Assuming a new disguise and forming an unlikely alliance with a woman on the inside, he looks to hijack the score of the crew's latest heist.Having loved the first Transporter movie that Statham was in, I have since been hoping for something that reached that level of plot and action that made Transporter a good movie.  Unfortunately the sequels failed to live up to those expectations and since that time, Jason Statham has pretty much played the same role over and over and over in most of the movies he has been, including this one.Not to say that this is a terrible movie, but nothing new from Statham.  The action is decent enough with an ok enough but somewhat unrealistic plot with J Lo as the real estate agent looking to get into the action.  I have never been a fan of J Lo's acting and in this movie, it is not anything Oscar worthy.  Even with the action, the movie tends to drag out and seems to be a bit too long and is somewhat uneven in its pacing and has a fairly predictable ending.For those that like Statham(which I do) and don't mind him playing the same type of character in every movie (which I don't) then there is enough action to keep you entertained.

1488367,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B005LAIILM,MadMacs,"[6, 9]","Does it seem like you've seen it before? Sure. But that's not always a bad thing. I've noted it ten times a thousand, if you're going to do a rip, at least do it correctly. It's amazes me that even though the working blueprint is literally in front of some of these filmmakers - they still manage to screw the pooch. So, let's give credit where its due. The creatives behind this film did it right.Jason Statham once again delivers the action goods.Playing an independent thief hired to lead a team of fellow thieves, Parker is known for two things. First, planning. It's an often overlooked job in the criminal world. Equivalent to a battlefield commander, it's one that usually doesn't get the accolades of the more high profile jobs like safe cracker or the insider. And Parker is a top shelf planner. The standard that he sets is that everyone follows the bleeping plan - no deviations. Second, the deal is the deal. Once it's agreed to, there are no further negotiations. None. Two very simple rules of his trade. Both of which will be broken.Unfortunately, the crew he's been hired to lead has another agenda. He's given the choice: Roll with it - or he's not going to live to complain.Having come to an unsurprising impasse, several rounds from a Glock are unloaded into him; the body unceremoniously dumped into a roadside ditch.Bad news for the crew, he's not dead. Worse news for them - since he's not dead - he's pissed. And Parker has a major bone of contention that he's going to ram into the two-faced scumbags who turned on him.Very glad to see Nick Nolte finally accepting that old age comes for us all. Always a favorite actor, it broke my heart to see him go off the rails with that insane quixotic pursuit of forever youth. With very strong performances in 'Warrior' and 'The Gangster Squad', he's completely back. And I'm damn appreciative that the gravel voiced performer has climbed off the ledge. Genuinely hope he has many more years with us.Not a fan of Jennifer Lopez's thespian efforts. Over her lengthy fluff-filled resum&eacute;, I can only citeone single instancewhere I thought she completely embodied her character, becoming the person described in the script. Until now. And I'm not talking about 'Selena'.In this production she takes on a lightweight role - but importantly - that was the point. Had she attempted to gild the lily as a downtrodden nearly broke realtor, the essence of her performance would've been undermined, warping itself into melodramatic ridiculousness and superficiality; basically representative of so many of her past efforts. Jennifer played it straight for the most part, so the character was amusingly out-of-place and tangibly alive. However late in her career, hopefully this awareness is a trend.Overall, 'Parker' is a very entertaining flick and a fine addition to the action library.Move Recommendation:- If you enjoyed Nick Nolte in this film, check out ""The Good Thief"" from 2002. An outstanding heist flick that I wish had had greater exposure during its release.Personal Note:- Before I get slammed by the self-appointed ""red pens"" of the world, allow me to say this: Yes, if I had to choose between Parker or Porter - I would go with the Aussie's 'Payback' as the better of the two.",4,"Snap, Crackle and Pop - Bones That Is",1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,3254,"['seem', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sure', 'not', 'always', 'bad', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'ten', 'thousand', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'rip', 'least', 'do', 'correctly', 'amazes', 'even', 'working', 'blueprint', 'literally', 'front', 'filmmakers', 'still', 'manage', 'screw', 'pooch', 'So', 'let', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'creatives', 'film', 'did', 'right.Jason', 'Statham', 'once', 'again', 'action', 'goods.Playing', 'independent', 'thief', 'hired', 'lead', 'team', 'fellow', 'thieves', 'Parker', 'known', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'planning', 'often', 'overlooked', 'job', 'criminal', 'world', 'Equivalent', 'battlefield', 'commander', 'one', 'usually', ""n't"", 'get', 'accolades', 'more', 'high', 'profile', 'jobs', 'safe', 'cracker', 'insider', 'Parker', 'top', 'shelf', 'planner', 'standard', 'everyone', 'bleeping', 'plan', 'deviations', 'Second', 'deal', 'deal', 'agreed', 'are', 'further', 'negotiations', 'None', 'Two', 'very', 'simple', 'rules', 'trade', 'will', 'be', 'broken.Unfortunately', 'crew', 'been', 'hired', 'lead', 'agenda', 'given', 'choice', 'Roll', 'not', 'going', 'live', 'complain.Having', 'come', 'unsurprising', 'impasse', 'several', 'rounds', 'Glock', 'are', 'unloaded', 'body', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'roadside', 'ditch.Bad', 'news', 'crew', 'not', 'dead', 'Worse', 'news', 'not', 'dead', 'pissed', 'Parker', 'major', 'bone', 'contention', 'going', 'ram', 'two-faced', 'scumbags', 'who', 'turned', 'him.Very', 'glad', 'see', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'finally', 'accepting', 'old', 'age', 'favorite', 'actor', 'broke', 'heart', 'see', 'go', 'off', 'rails', 'insane', 'quixotic', 'pursuit', 'forever', 'youth', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', ""'Warrior"", 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'completely', 'back', ""'m"", 'damn', 'appreciative', 'gravel', 'voiced', 'performer', 'climbed', 'ledge', 'Genuinely', 'hope', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'us.Not', 'fan', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'thespian', 'efforts', 'lengthy', 'fluff-filled', 'resum', 'eacute', 'can', 'only', 'citeone', 'single', 'instancewhere', 'thought', 'completely', 'embodied', 'character', 'becoming', 'person', 'described', 'script', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', ""'Selena'.In"", 'production', 'lightweight', 'role', 'importantly', 'was', 'point', 'Had', 'attempted', 'gild', 'lily', 'downtrodden', 'nearly', 'broke', 'realtor', 'essence', 'performance', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'undermined', 'warping', 'melodramatic', 'ridiculousness', 'superficiality', 'basically', 'representative', 'so', 'many', 'past', 'efforts', 'Jennifer', 'played', 'straight', 'most', 'part', 'character', 'was', 'amusingly', 'out-of-place', 'tangibly', 'alive', 'However', 'late', 'career', 'hopefully', 'awareness', 'trend.Overall', ""'Parker"", 'very', 'entertaining', 'flick', 'fine', 'addition', 'action', 'Recommendation', 'enjoyed', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'film', 'check', 'Good', 'Thief', '2002', 'outstanding', 'heist', 'flick', 'wish', 'had', 'had', 'greater', 'exposure', 'release.Personal', 'Note', 'get', 'slammed', 'self-appointed', 'red', 'pens', 'world', 'allow', 'say', 'Yes', 'had', 'choose', 'Parker', 'Porter', 'would', 'go', 'Aussie', ""'Payback"", 'better', 'two']",Parker

1488372,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIILM,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Donald Westlake was one of the greatest crime authors to ever put word to paper. His books have been turned into numerous films but most have been based on the character he created under the pseudonym Richard Stark. That character's name is Parker and such films as PAYBACK and POINT BLANK have been about him but never used his name. That changes with the release of PARKER.Jason Statham stars as Parker, the hard edged professional thief and all around tough guy who uses a few simple rules: don't steal from people who can't afford it and don't hurt people who don't deserve it. Parker also makes a point of telling people on the wrong end of his gun that if they simply do as he says and are honest with him they have nothing to fear. Both of these rules are strictly followed by Parker but perhaps not always by the associates he chooses to work with.The latest heist involves the box office receipts from the Ohio State Fair. Parker's best friend Hurley (Nick Nolte) puts him in touch with a crew that needs his planning expertise. Headed by Melander (Michael Chiklis) they succeed in their heist but down the road he tells Parker that he'd like him to put his share into another robbery they have planned that will result in a bigger payoff. Parker declines but Melander tells him he's taking his share anyway. Gunplay follows and Parker is left for dead at the side of the road. But if he were dead then this would be the shortest feature film ever made.Parker is saved by a family in a truck and taken to a hospital. Before he can be questioned, he leaves and heads for home calling his girlfriend Claire (Emma Booth) Hurley's daughter on the way. He tells her to leave and then calls Hurley next. The warning doesn't quite come in time as Hurley lets him know that Melander was being backed by the Chicago mob and one of the team is tied to them. An assassin shows to kill Claire but she escapes.Parker's code of ethics kicks in full blast. Though Hurley shows with his portion of the initial robbery sent from Chicago Parker's main goal now is to take revenge on those who betrayed him and get his share back from them. He finds out their plans for the next heist and while the Chicago mob tries to take him out, he follows the first crew down to Palm Beach. There he poses as a Texas millionaire and has local real estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez) help him find a home to purchase. In reality he's looking for a secluded unused house he can hide out in.Leslie is down on her luck and living with her mother. A few things make her suspicious and she confronts Parker. After some discussions he decides he can trust her and use her to help him out as well. He then discovers more about this planned heist with information Leslie provides him and sets out to take the score once the robbery goes down. But, as they say, the best laid plans.What makes the movie interesting, as well as the character of Parker, is this moral code that he has that he follows to the end. He often seems to care less about the money than the principal of the treatment he earned. In so doing the crew sets in motion a chain of events that will not end happily for them. And while when we step back we know that Parker is indeed a career criminal, we find ourselves rooting for him all the way.Statham does a great job as Parker portraying the character as written; a man who uses few words when they are not called for and uses them sparingly when they are. Statham plays him as a man of action but not the same way he's done many of his characters in the past which was more action and less acting. He's better than that and proves it here. Lopez does a fine job as Leslie though her role feels minor for the star power she can draw to a film.The movie looks great and uses various tones to differentiate between the settings it takes place in. This is a result of the keen eye of director Taylor Hackford, the director of such films as WHITE NIGHTS, AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and RAY. Hackford has always taken the films he's worked on and brought them to a level not expected for the stories chosen.PARKER is filled with plenty of gory violence and flowing blood during fight sequences so be aware. This is also to say that there is plenty of violence in the film so go in knowing this. But if that's not a problem then expect a heist film filled with double crosses, gunplay, fight scenes and a character whose set of rules could cost him more than money.",4,AN ETHICAL BAD GUY,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,4461,"['Donald', 'Westlake', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'crime', 'authors', 'ever', 'put', 'word', 'paper', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'numerous', 'films', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'character', 'created', 'pseudonym', 'Richard', 'Stark', 'character', 'name', 'Parker', 'such', 'films', 'PAYBACK', 'POINT', 'BLANK', 'have', 'been', 'never', 'used', 'name', 'release', 'PARKER.Jason', 'Statham', 'Parker', 'hard', 'edged', 'professional', 'thief', 'around', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'few', 'simple', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Parker', 'also', 'point', 'telling', 'people', 'wrong', 'end', 'gun', 'simply', 'do', 'are', 'honest', 'have', 'nothing', 'fear', 'rules', 'are', 'strictly', 'followed', 'Parker', 'perhaps', 'not', 'always', 'associates', 'work', 'with.The', 'latest', 'heist', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'Ohio', 'State', 'Fair', 'Parker', 'best', 'friend', 'Hurley', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'touch', 'crew', 'planning', 'expertise', 'Headed', 'Melander', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'succeed', 'heist', 'road', 'Parker', ""'d"", 'like', 'put', 'share', 'robbery', 'have', 'planned', 'will', 'result', 'bigger', 'payoff', 'Parker', 'Melander', 'taking', 'share', 'anyway', 'Gunplay', 'Parker', 'left', 'dead', 'side', 'road', 'were', 'dead', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'shortest', 'feature', 'film', 'ever', 'made.Parker', 'saved', 'family', 'truck', 'taken', 'hospital', 'can', 'be', 'questioned', 'heads', 'home', 'calling', 'girlfriend', 'Claire', 'Emma', 'Booth', 'Hurley', 'daughter', 'way', 'leave', 'then', 'Hurley', 'next', 'warning', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'time', 'Hurley', 'know', 'Melander', 'was', 'being', 'backed', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'one', 'team', 'tied', 'assassin', 'kill', 'Claire', 'escapes.Parker', 'code', 'ethics', 'kicks', 'full', 'blast', 'Hurley', 'shows', 'portion', 'initial', 'robbery', 'sent', 'Chicago', 'Parker', 'main', 'goal', 'now', 'take', 'revenge', 'who', 'betrayed', 'get', 'share', 'back', 'out', 'plans', 'next', 'heist', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'take', 'out', 'first', 'crew', 'down', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Texas', 'millionaire', 'local', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Leslie', 'Rodgers', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'help', 'find', 'home', 'purchase', 'reality', 'looking', 'secluded', 'unused', 'house', 'can', 'hide', 'out', 'in.Leslie', 'down', 'luck', 'living', 'mother', 'few', 'things', 'make', 'suspicious', 'Parker', 'discussions', 'can', 'trust', 'use', 'help', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'more', 'planned', 'heist', 'information', 'Leslie', 'out', 'take', 'score', 'robbery', 'down', 'say', 'best', 'laid', 'plans.What', 'movie', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Parker', 'moral', 'code', 'end', 'often', 'care', 'less', 'money', 'principal', 'treatment', 'earned', 'so', 'doing', 'crew', 'motion', 'chain', 'events', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'happily', 'when', 'step', 'back', 'know', 'Parker', 'indeed', 'career', 'criminal', 'find', 'rooting', 'way.Statham', 'great', 'job', 'Parker', 'portraying', 'character', 'written', 'man', 'who', 'few', 'words', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'called', 'sparingly', 'when', 'are', 'Statham', 'man', 'action', 'not', 'same', 'way', 'done', 'many', 'characters', 'past', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'less', 'acting', 'better', 'here', 'Lopez', 'fine', 'job', 'Leslie', 'role', 'feels', 'minor', 'star', 'power', 'can', 'draw', 'film.The', 'movie', 'great', 'various', 'tones', 'differentiate', 'settings', 'place', 'result', 'keen', 'eye', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'director', 'such', 'films', 'WHITE', 'NIGHTS', 'AN', 'OFFICER', 'A', 'GENTLEMAN', 'RAY', 'Hackford', 'always', 'taken', 'films', 'worked', 'brought', 'level', 'not', 'expected', 'stories', 'chosen.PARKER', 'filled', 'plenty', 'gory', 'violence', 'flowing', 'blood', 'fight', 'sequences', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'also', 'say', 'plenty', 'violence', 'film', 'so', 'go', 'knowing', 'not', 'problem', 'then', 'expect', 'heist', 'film', 'filled', 'double', 'crosses', 'gunplay', 'fight', 'scenes', 'character', 'set', 'rules', 'could', 'cost', 'more', 'money']",Parker

In fairness he tends to play the same character in all of his films (with some minor variations), I don't hold that against him, I like that character and it works well in a lot of stories. Unfortunately it doesn't work so well in this one.It starts well with a slick robbery in which he shows himself to be the skilled, calm member of the team (he plays the honourable criminal capable of handling himself in this film). The team then double crosses him and leaves him for dead, so he quite rightly starts hunting him down.For this type of film to work you need three things, the first is a decent hero which it has. The second is a decent enemy, which it lacks, sort off. The crew have some familiar faces and almost make a good team for the hero to pit his skills against. The team don't really match their skills, in fact the only real peril Statham has is against a contract knife man (which is admittedly a good fight).The third is that of a gimmick or a sidekick, here the film does a little better. Jennifer Lopez plays a sexy real estate who is down on her luck and see Statham as a potential client. She figures out what is going on and becomes more involved in the plot. She doesn't really really raise the film to any great height, but she isn't too annoying.In fairness this wasn't ever likely to be a great film and if you like action then he's done better films, but it's not terrible and it did entertain me for an hour and a half.",3,Fun action,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1553,"['like', 'watching', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'action', 'good', 'action', 'star', 'excellent', 'moves', 'fairness', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'films', 'minor', 'variations', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'like', 'character', 'well', 'lot', 'stories', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'one.It', 'well', 'slick', 'robbery', 'be', 'skilled', 'calm', 'member', 'team', 'honourable', 'criminal', 'capable', 'handling', 'film', 'team', 'then', 'double', 'crosses', 'dead', 'so', 'quite', 'rightly', 'hunting', 'down.For', 'type', 'film', 'work', 'need', 'three', 'things', 'first', 'decent', 'hero', 'second', 'decent', 'enemy', 'sort', 'off', 'crew', 'have', 'familiar', 'almost', 'make', 'good', 'team', 'hero', 'pit', 'skills', 'team', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'match', 'skills', 'fact', 'only', 'real', 'peril', 'Statham', 'contract', 'knife', 'man', 'admittedly', 'good', 'fight', '.The', 'third', 'gimmick', 'sidekick', 'here', 'film', 'little', 'better', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'sexy', 'real', 'estate', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'see', 'Statham', 'potential', 'client', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'more', 'involved', 'plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'really', 'raise', 'film', 'great', 'height', ""n't"", 'too', 'annoying.In', 'fairness', 'was', ""n't"", 'ever', 'likely', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'like', 'action', 'then', 'done', 'better', 'films', 'not', 'terrible', 'did', 'entertain', 'hour', 'half']",Parker

Granted Statham is pretty good at what he does most of the time, but I've seen this character too many times.  He is of course Parker, the thief with a heart of gold.  Rather than get an honest job, he steals money from the Ohio State Fair and heiresses charity auctions.  Here's a suggesting, get a job repossessing cars.  Parker can break into a car, put his hands under the steering column and start it up in about 10 seconds, but who's counting?With the help of the father (Nick Nolte) of his live-in girlfriend (Emma Booth), Parker works with a nefarious bunch of criminals with the intent of knocking over the proceeds ($1 million) of the Fair.  Things don't go perfect but the end result is successful.  With an even split, everyone walks away with 200 grand.  Parker wants his cut, the other thugs want to reinvest the money in a bigger job (heiress jewelry collection).  When Parker refuses, he is stabbed, shot and left for dead.Now it's all about revenge and Parker is pissed.  He is rehabilitated and finds his way to Miami where the big heist is to take place.  Wanting some idea of where the bad guys might hole up, he poses as a rich Texan (LOL on the accent) looking for a second or third house.  And he engages the services of real estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez).  Leslie is about to have her car repossessed and needs a sale so cuddles up to Parker.  Eventually she offers to help him with is plan to get back at his former partners.  Why?  No reason that makes any sense.Parker is too loyal to his girlfriend for things to go too far with Leslie, but does insist she strip to her undies so he can see if she's wearing a wire.  Now, don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with Jennifer Lopez in her underwear but just what was this scene all about.  Yep, just getting a look at Ms. Lopez and her famous booty.  Her character is ridiculous and changes the tone of the film from a full fuelled revenge thriller to a comedy.  Oscar winner Taylor Hackford (""Ray"") directed and produced this mess.

Westlake wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark, about an amoral professional thief named Parker, you will have some quibbles about this adaptation of the novel FLASHFIRE.  I'm a snobbish and self-righteous fan of Stark/Parker, and I expected to hate this movie.  Actually, I found myself giving it 4 stars out of 5.  It's not a bad effort at all, with Jason Statham and JLo performing very nicely.  The pace lags a bit here and there, but overall the film is not bad.  The film has a nice crop of supporting actors.If you don't know (or care) about the novels, but you're a Jason Statham fan, you might just enjoy this film.  Yes, it's a well-worn caper/betrayal/revenge plot, and the screenplay, while a decent effort, loses a lot of the fine details in the novel.  It's definitely worth a shot, though I would recommend renting it rather than purchasing it.  I saw it via NetFlix.  Give it a chance.I continue to feel that the bravura adaptation of Stark's THE HUNTER was the film POINT BLANK with Lee Marvin.  Mel Gibson starred in an adaptation of the same novel, called PAYBACK, but the better version of the latter is PAYBACK STRAIGHT UP: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.  I own that one.  Out there from the past are adaptations THE OUTFIT, THE SPLIT (from the novel THE SEVENTH), SLAYGROUND (very, very poor), and even a French film.

1488423,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005LAIILM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Parker (Taylor Hackford, 2013)I am not entirely sure why Taylor Hackford felt the need to &#8220;reboot&#8221; the Parker franchise when Hollywood's first modern Parker film, 1999's Payback, was such an unbridled joy. Brian Helgeland's film gets that perfect balance of action, comedy, and sheer edge-of-your-seat disgust from Westlake's novels down pat (tell me you didn't close your eyes during the scene with the hammer and Mel Gibson's toes and I will call you a liar to your face). It was a movie that cried out for the same connections to adapt any other dozen Donald E. Westlake novels, but for some reason that never happened, leaving one sterling film. And so Hackford and his cronies could have started, well, anywhere else in the Parker mythology instead of going after the same book, but that's what they did&#8212;though if you aren't familiar with the novel, and maybe even if you are, if you know Helgeland's film you will likely be questioning a few times whether this is actually an adaptation of the same book. It is, unfortunately. And you know, I didn't hate this movie anywhere near as much as it may sound like I did reading over that paragraph, but I think I would have liked it a lot more if I didn't have Payback sitting in the back of my mind to hold up as a yardstick for what Parker should have been and never was.Plot: Parker (The Transporter's Jason Statham) is a career criminal who made his money by keeping his head low and being one of the best at his job. He gets hired as a part of a crew for what seems like a standard robbery, but once they've gotten away, Melander (The Shield's Michael Chiklis), the unofficial leader of this loose confederation of crooks, changes the game on Parker, promising a score at least ten times as large if he's willing to invest his share of this take. When Parker refuses, the rest of the gang attack him, dump him by the side of the road, and leave him for dead. After a long period of recovery, Parker&#8212;never one to forget about money he's owed&#8212;tracks Melander and the rest of the gang to get his share of the loot, picking up a wannabe sidekick (Out of Sight's Jennifer Lopez) along the way.Jason Statham, over the past few years, has quietly morphed into this generation's Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8212;a reliable action star, enjoyable to watch whenever he appears onscreen, and bringing a moxie to otherwise generic action films in which he appears.  (Admit it, without Schwarzie, you would never have watched Commanda. Actually, while we're at it, admit it: you watched Commando.) But he doesn't have the force of personality that Schwarzie always brings to his roles. As a result, Statham usually ends up as an actor like Parker does as a thief&#8212;you remember enjoying the performance but you don't remember much about it otherwise. For a thief, that's a good thing. For an actor, it usually means not being able to keep up with the rest of the cast. That is definitely the case here, with the huge personalities onscreen. Patti LuPone as J-Lo's mom steals every scene she's in (all of which, if memory serves, contain Statham). Michael Chiklis gets roles based on that boisterous personality, as does Bobby Cannavale.

Directed with brio and panache by Taylor Hackford, the film features Jason Statham as a big-time robber who's left for dead by his cohorts (Michael Chiklis, Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins, Jr., and Bobby Cannavale) after a post-heist falling out, proving once again that there is no honor among thieves. Statham spends the rest of the film plotting his revenge against the men, employing real estate agent Jennifer Lopez as an unlikely accomplice to that end.While I probably could have done with a bit more of Chiklis and company and a bit less of Lopez, I must say that ""Parker"" has enough energy and spirit to ride up and over most of its shortcomings, including succumbing to that third-act curse that afflicts far too many action movies these days. The film is just offbeat enough to be engaging and wise enough not to take itself too seriously.

1488446,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B005LAIILM,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[8, 16]","We so often discuss what a movie is, that for a change I want to tell you up front what  Taylor Hackford's adaptation of Richard Stark's ""Flashfire"" is not. Parker is not thrilling, it is not surprising , it is not well made, it is not clever, it is not well acted even by actors who are generally pretty good, it is not satisfying, in short it is not a good film, it is not a movie worth watching. I could say it is not worth talking about or writing about, but that's what I do, plus I've already seen it.Telling the story of a master criminal, that's Parker, who after a big heist at a county fairgrounds finds himself double crossed by his partners. Surviving the multiple gun shots and the jump from a fast moving vehicle, he tails the creeps to Florida where there next heist is set to go down. At this point Parker seems nearly indistrucable and goes on a rampage of vengeance against his former colleagues.Starring the usually reliable tough guy action star Jason Statham as the title character. This is the first Parker movie to actually use the character's name, I think that is the only positive here. Previously incarnations have been portrayed by Lee Marvin (in Point Blank), Robert Duvall (in the Outfit) and Mel Gibson (in Payback). All of these adaptations are infinitely better, Point Blank is actually one of the greatest action movies ever made. The only thing Statham shows in that he is not in the hard man  league of Marvin, Duvall or Gibson, it is surprising just how bad he actually is here. But in all fairness he is monumentally miscast, first off he's British,  second he is just a different sort of action star, usually playing heroes, even if a reluctant one. Marvin, Duvall and occasionally Gibson all mastered in playing anti-heroes, which Parker most certainly is,  Statham is as wrong for this role as Tom Cruise was for Jack Reacher.He is also given a fairly lousy script by John J. McLaughlin, author of the excellent Black Swan,  to work with. It is so padded with clich&eacute;s and false sounding dialogue that it is unable to find a proper rhythm. And further more, McLaughlin's under plotted script doesn't even have a single plot twist, it just travels from point A to B.As with director Hackford, you might be surprised to find the script is by McLaughlin. But a closer inspection of his credits will also reveal the equally awful Man of the House, which had Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas ranger protecting a group of cheerleaders.Even a strong supporting cast is left floundering. Jennifer Lopez is an unlikely leading lady for the Stath, but she almost pulls her part off. Playing a troubled and desperate  real estate agent who is more than willing to scheme and help Parker in his purists, is actually a far more interesting  character than Statham, not necessarily Parker. But a third act brain fart turns her into an idiotic damsel in distress and ruins the role.Also cast is the very good  actor Michael Chiklis as Parker's double crossing partner, but he is given even less to do than Statham. Chicklis, the star of the excellent TV series ""the Shield"", is on movie screens far too little. He would have made a much better Parker, but the role he has is both underwritten and under developed. He is a poor excuse for a villain, he is nothing, except a big bore.Also on hand is the legendary Nick Nolte playing Parker's mentor and potential father-in-law. One of the greatest actors of all time, see his work in the recent Warrior, but this marks the second movie in two weeks that Nolte is under utilized. Here, he is not only wasted, but disappears in the middle of the film without any explanation given.Directed by Taylor Hackford, a wildly uneven filmmaker. Hackford, an academy award winner, who's credits include Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning portrayal of Ray (Charles), the superior Keanu Reeves-Al Pacino vehicle the Devil's Advocate, and the excellent, but largely forgotten Stephen King adaptation Dolores Clairborne. But he is also responsible for the misguided Jeff Bridges-James Woods starrer  Against All Odds, it self a remake of the renowned film noir Out of the Past.The late Dennis Hopper once said that ever director's favorite genre is film noir. That may be, but not ever director is cut out for it. Hackford lives down to his name when it comes to the hard boiled.I thought the Stath was finished with this kind of movie. After two very good Expendables movies and the thoroughly watchable, but predictable Safe. I thought he had left behind his string of recent turkeys such as the Mechanic, Transporter 3 and Killer Elite. But here he comes back thunderous in another terrible vehicle that is a notch or two below recent direct to DVD flicks starring Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steve Austin.The action scenes are poorly handled too, Hackford clearly has no idea how to stage them. A fight between Statham and 90's martial arts star Daniel Bernhard is badly choreographed and dull for doing so.And don't even get me started on the big guy's Texas accent. Coming just one week after Peter Stormare's ""southern drawl"" in the Last Stand. Statham manages to out shame him, but at least it offers the movie's only (unintentional) humor.Parker is so under developed that a supporting character played by Bobby Cavanagh, as a police officer with an unhealthy fixation on Lopez, comes across as creepy and a stalker. But the character serves nearly no purpose, I don't think Lopez ever realizes that he's stalking her. This is a subplot that warrants it's own movie and it goes absolutely nowhere, it's even forgotten before the end credits.Parker runs a staggering and painful 118 minutes. There isn't enough story for 90 minutes, let alone nearly two hours. Boredom sets in after about the first fifteen minutes when the picture is nowhere near the finish line.Set in Palm Beach, Florida the setting will conjure memories of Elmore Leonard. But even the worst Leonard adoptions have had more grit and originality than this. The casting of Lopez may also help recall memories of the great Out of Sight, which will also illustrate just how far her career has fallen, from co-starring with George Clooney to Jason Statham.see

1488463,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B005LAIILM,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Jason Statham is THE action hero of generation X, and may be one of the best action heroes of all time. The man seems to channel elements of Willis, Stallone, & Schwarzenegger into every film he does, not to mention he is one of the hardest working actors in Hollywood. At first his films got a reputation for moving too fast and being a bit confusing, but with every film, he has gotten better and better, and to date his crowning achievement is Parker. Parker is a thief for hire, one of the best money can buy. When an old friend hooks him up with an ambitious crew, Parker is eager to get started on a job, that promises seven figures. The job goes off without a hitch, but on the way back the crew lets Parker know that this was just seed money for a much larger and almost impossible job. When Parker refuses to partake, he winds up left for dead on the side of the road, with only one thing on his mind, revenge. This film puts a new twist on a classic story and it is done to near perfection by a top star and veteran Director, Taylor Hackford (Ray, The Devil's Advocate). Statham makes the story with his best performance to date and has plenty of help to ensure this movie is his crown jewel. The list of Emmy and Academy Award winners is this film is staggering. I won't list them all, as you can see the full cast on IMDB, but when you put that many stars together, the result is almost always going to be magic. In the end the film does turn out to be somewhat predictable, but it's one of those times where you really just don't care. Parker is two hours of excitement with all the comedy, explosions, twists, and turns you could hope for. I can't possibly recommend it enough for fans of the Action genre. In an Action film it's hard to get a good cast and even harder to get a decent story to go with the mayhem, but Parker has that an more.

I will start by saying that I am a Statham fan, but lately he is beginning to repeat himself. He started off strong with Lock Stock and Snatch then hit Transporter and decided I'm gonna do this guy all the time now. I do enjoy his movies because they are entertaining but you can only see the same thing so many times. He has been trying to break out of that role little by little and this is his biggest departure.

Though severely wounded, Parker tracks down the money and those who betrayed him.The premise may sound familiar to some moviegoers. ""Parker"" is based on a book ""Flashfire"" by Donald E. Westlake (or Richard Stark, his pseudonym), an installment of the author's long-running crime novel series featuring the professional criminal Parker, and its first book happens to be ""The Hunter,"" basis of ""Point Blank"" starring Lee Marvin in 1967, and ""Payback"" starring Mel Gibson in 1999 (though in both films the main character's name is changed).So, directed by Taylor Hackford, ""Parker"" feels more like a modern-day film-noir or character study than an action movie. You don't have many action sequences in ""Parker,"" but when they happen, they are very bloody. There is one standout scene about a knife-wielding assassin (Daniel Bernhardt), which turns out more violent than that of Jason Bourne.Jason Statham does what he does, and does it effectively as a career criminal with a personal code of honor, but the film's pace is too slow even for this genre and Jennifer Lopez's character, a Miami relator Leslie as comedy relief, is underused. The heist sequences are lazy and unexciting, and most of the interesting supporting players including Michael Chiklis, Clifton Collins Jr. and Nick Nolte are wasted.

This time he's in the film adaptation of Richard Stark's novel 'FLASHBACK' , one of 29 novels involving the character Parker, a professional thief who works and lives by his own personal code. Actually Richard Stark is the pseudonym for Donald E. Westlake of which the film is in memoriam to.  Adapted for the screen by John McLaughlin , the film is a variation of Director John Boorman's POINT BLANK'- 1967 and its remake Director Brian Helgeland's 'PAYBACK'-1999 in that Parker is double crossed by his men during a bank heist and spends the entire film hunting them down for his share of the take.  The bank heist also resembles Director Stanley Kubrick's 'THE KILLING'-1956 including the clown makeups instead of masks and a state fair rather than a race track being robbed.  The cast is excellent including an extremely evil performance by Michael Chiklis, a wonderful turn by Patti Lupone as a middle age crisis mom and a haggard cameo by Nick Nolte.  The real scene stealer is Jennifer Lopez as real estate agent Leslie Charles.  She incinerates the screen and proves that she is one of the most underrated actresses in the business approaching the role with spunk, pathos and smoldering eroticism showing more maturity than her other memorable perf in Director Steven Soderbergh's 'OUT OF SIGHT'-1998 .  Producer /Director Taylor Hackford who helmed the memorably eerie Al Pacino opus 'THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE'-1999 takes up the reins admirably composing his revenge motif like a pressure cooker bolero and spacing the action set pieces in such a way as to not overwhelm the viewer. It is Statham's show all the way as he immerses himself into the role giving it a dimension lacking in some of his other efforts.  This Blu-Ray release by Sony Entertainment delivers the goods in gorgeous 1080p showing off the Florida locations and the photography by J.Michael Muro in a clean 2.35 transfer with 5.1 DIS HD MA.  It has audio commentary with Director Hackford and 4 featurettes : BRINGING THE HUNTER TO LIFE: THE MAKING OF PARKER; WHO IS PARKER?(a study of the character in the novels); BROKEN NECKS AND BLOODY KNUCKLES (a short take on the stunts in the film) and THE ORIGIN OF PARKER.

Even for a Jason Statham movie released in Janurary, Parker is surprisingly awful. I felt like I was watching a T.V movie. Statham gave a lazy performance as Parker and nothing about his character was interesting. The directing was really poor and whoever was directing really was just doing this for the paycheck. The writing was even worse. It went between being a brutal revenge story and a crime caper action comedy too much and felt really unbalanced. The story was boring and played out like the most generic of these types of films. The action scenes weren't terrible, but they were very run-of-the-mill and there was nothing about them that made them exciting or entertaining to watch. What made the film even worse was that there were visible errors in the film that any director should've been able to notice such as an early scene in the film where Jason Statham is walking in the rain and you can clearly see where the hose is moving over Statham to make it look like it's raining. It only gets worse once Jennifer Lopez's annoying one dimensional character gets introduced.Parker should've been a fun movie and there's really no excuse for it being as terrible as it is. After seeing this garbage, I honestly don't have any desire to see a Jason Statham movie again for a while (Unless it's Crank 3).The tagline for Parker reads &#34;To Get Away Clean, You Have To Play Dirty&#34;, and that's exactly what the people behind this film did.",1,One of Jason Stathams Worst Films!,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1812,"['generally', 'enjoy', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'movies', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'generic', 'go', 'along', 'still', 'tend', 'enjoy', 'most', 'part.Unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'Parker.Based', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'trailers', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'Parker', 'expecting', 'be', 'great', 'least', 'decent', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'Even', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'movie', 'released', 'Janurary', 'Parker', 'surprisingly', 'awful', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'T.V', 'movie', 'Statham', 'gave', 'lazy', 'performance', 'Parker', 'nothing', 'character', 'was', 'interesting', 'directing', 'was', 'really', 'poor', 'was', 'directing', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'paycheck', 'writing', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'went', 'being', 'brutal', 'revenge', 'story', 'crime', 'caper', 'action', 'comedy', 'too', 'much', 'felt', 'really', 'unbalanced', 'story', 'was', 'boring', 'played', 'out', 'most', 'generic', 'types', 'films', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'were', 'very', 'run-of-the-mill', 'was', 'nothing', 'made', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'even', 'worse', 'was', 'were', 'visible', 'errors', 'film', 'director', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'notice', 'such', 'early', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'walking', 'rain', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'where', 'hose', 'moving', 'over', 'Statham', 'make', 'look', 'raining', 'only', 'worse', 'once', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'annoying', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'introduced.Parker', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fun', 'movie', 'really', 'excuse', 'being', 'as', 'terrible', 'seeing', 'garbage', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'movie', 'again', 'while', 'Crank', '3', '.The', 'tagline', 'Parker', 'reads', '34', 'Get', 'Away', 'Clean', 'Have', 'Play', 'Dirty', '34', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'film', 'did']",Parker
