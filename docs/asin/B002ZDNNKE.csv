You get the impression that this was the highlight of his life and everything thereafter was downhill. The second is a angry man either very late teens or more likely in his 20's who starts downhill and seeks out every slippery slope that he can find. He ends up in jail and learns to box as a way of channaling his aggression but even more to &#34;think&#34; and understand the results of his actions whether in the ring or in life.For those that think that films made in Asia are only martial art films, the films from Korea have a dose of violence with thought provoking consequences.",4,I picked this movie partially based on the actor Choi Min-sik,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,707,"['short', 'movie', 'two', 'individuals', 'one', 'amature', 'boxer', 'who', 'had', 'won', 'silver', 'medal', 'earlier', 'life', 'get', 'impression', 'was', 'highlight', 'life', 'everything', 'thereafter', 'was', 'downhill', 'second', 'angry', 'man', 'very', 'late', 'teens', 'more', 'likely', '20', 'who', 'downhill', 'out', 'slippery', 'slope', 'can', 'find', 'up', 'jail', 'box', 'way', 'channaling', 'aggression', 'even', 'more', '34', 'think', '34', 'understand', 'results', 'actions', 'ring', 'life.For', 'think', 'films', 'made', 'Asia', 'are', 'only', 'martial', 'art', 'films', 'films', 'Korea', 'have', 'dose', 'violence', 'thought', 'provoking', 'consequences']",N/A

1300099,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B002ZDNNKE,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[4, 4]","Crying Fist follows Tae-shik (Choi Min-sik), a Boxing Silver Medalist turned human punching bag, and Sang-hwan (Ryu Seung-beom), a young street criminal that ends up in jail. Tae-shik and Sang-hwan turn to boxing in order to change their lives, where they learn to fight their inner demons before they fight each other. Crying Fist is a triumphant film that is much more than a typical sports film.The story is amazing; it manages to be much more than the typical ""underdog"" or ""fight for money I need"" sport film. The problems and hardships these character go through are told and shown in vivid detail, and it tries to teach some life lessons. The ending of the film is amazing, you may not be able to predict the victor; I won't spoil the ending, but it has more meaning and significance. The boxing felt authentic and thrilling. Choi Min-sik and Ryu Seung-beom give spectacular performances, and so does the supporting cast. The music was also great.I watched this on Amazon Prime Instant Video. The video quality isn't amazing, but good enough. There was a green line on the side of the video throughout the entire video, though. Also, between the 1:19:00 and 1:21:00 mark, or so, the movie freezes between two frames that continuously repeat, so you miss two minutes that have some significance. (as of 1/11/13)Overall, Crying Fist is a spectacular film with a meaningful message and amazing boxing. The film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, but a purchase is highly recommended.",5,A Triumphant Film That Is Much More Than A Typical Sports Film....

1300100,A2XZWMTCQWOIX3,B002ZDNNKE,Norm,"[0, 0]",I liked this movie and may even love it if I watch and pay full attention to it instead of multi-tasking at the time.  The movie is not difficult to follow as far as its story line and there are not so many things going on that it is confusing to follow.  The film is in its native language with English subtitles which does not detract from the experience - and the accompanying description as a story of redemption - a tale that holds true for anyone who finds themselves in that situation.  I'm sure I would have loved it if I had had the time to sit and relax and pay full attention.,4,When You Come to the Fork in the Road - Take It,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,587,"['liked', 'movie', 'may', 'even', 'love', 'watch', 'pay', 'full', 'attention', 'instead', 'multi-tasking', 'time', 'movie', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'confusing', 'follow', 'film', 'native', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'not', 'detract', 'experience', 'accompanying', 'description', 'story', 'redemption', 'tale', 'true', 'anyone', 'who', 'situation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'had', 'had', 'time', 'sit', 'relax', 'pay', 'full', 'attention']",N/A

1300102,A7BQF2Y5QBIC0,B002ZDNNKE,Verrcktheit Reviews,"[6, 6]","In a sport where their must be a loser, there is often a clear destinction between the protagonist and antagonist. However in Ryoo Seung-wan's Crying Fist this is hardly the case. By the time the film hits its climax one can barely decide who deserves victory, and each character carries strong emotional resonance with you. Movies involving sports often glamorize them in a way that makes them fun to watch but also very uncommon compared to the real thing. This is also not the case in Crying Fist. The fighting scenes displayed show what boxing is more often the not actually a kin too. Choreeographed beautifully one has trouble telling that the fight scenes aren't real as you become so lost in the film. The acting is also amazing, both Choi Min-sik and Ryoo Seung-bum pummel you with emotionally heavy strikes that make you feel like you're ready to break down as they do. The soundtrack placed behind the scenes is also notabley well done. It's not the usual fight and win boxing style score you find in movies like Rocky and The Hurricane, but rather it feels more like the music set to a sad drama. It works extremely well to pull the film together and make you feel as though you are in the ring with both men as they fight to prove themselves to the world, their families, and who they are. Finally the director (Ryoo Seung-wan) deserves mention for the way he pulled all the characters and their troubles together in a way that made you feel for not only the stars, but the minor characters as well. This is an amazing film that is one of the best of the genre, and a new personal favorite of mine.*it is important to know that this DVD is region 1 and playable in the US as it is not listed in the advertised details on Amazon",5,"Beautiful film filled with emotion and power, one of the best films of 2005",1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,1740,"['sport', 'where', 'must', 'be', 'loser', 'often', 'clear', 'destinction', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'However', 'Ryoo', 'Seung-wan', 'Crying', 'Fist', 'hardly', 'case', 'time', 'film', 'climax', 'one', 'can', 'barely', 'decide', 'who', 'victory', 'character', 'strong', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'Movies', 'involving', 'sports', 'often', 'glamorize', 'way', 'fun', 'watch', 'also', 'very', 'uncommon', 'compared', 'real', 'thing', 'also', 'not', 'case', 'Crying', 'Fist', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'displayed', 'show', 'what', 'boxing', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'actually', 'kin', 'too', 'Choreeographed', 'beautifully', 'one', 'trouble', 'telling', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'become', 'so', 'lost', 'film', 'acting', 'also', 'amazing', 'Choi', 'Min-sik', 'Ryoo', 'Seung-bum', 'pummel', 'emotionally', 'heavy', 'strikes', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'ready', 'break', 'down', 'do', 'soundtrack', 'placed', 'scenes', 'also', 'notabley', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'usual', 'fight', 'win', 'boxing', 'style', 'score', 'find', 'movies', 'Rocky', 'Hurricane', 'rather', 'more', 'music', 'set', 'sad', 'drama', 'extremely', 'well', 'pull', 'film', 'together', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'ring', 'men', 'fight', 'prove', 'world', 'families', 'who', 'are', 'Finally', 'director', 'Ryoo', 'Seung-wan', 'mention', 'way', 'pulled', 'characters', 'troubles', 'together', 'way', 'made', 'feel', 'not', 'only', 'stars', 'minor', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'amazing', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'genre', 'new', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', '*it', 'important', 'know', 'DVD', 'region', '1', 'playable', 'US', 'not', 'listed', 'advertised', 'details', 'Amazon']",N/A
