I never payed attention to this show until the death of Carroll O'Connor, there was marathon to pay tribute to him and I fell in love with this lovable bigot with a heart of gold. My fave episode from season 1 is the one where Edith gets jury duty and Archie misses her while she's away, it's sweet. I highly recommend this groundbreaking show.

688762,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B00005Y4RZ,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[3, 4]","Although the packaging leaves a little to be desired, just ""take one for the team"" and enjoy this for what it is. Along with its analogue look (it looks like video tape) and old-time TV sound, you will quickly forget these drawbacks as you are catapulted back to 1971, to see the complete, uncut episodes, from the beginning, of quite possibly the funniest program in all of TV.See what happens when you throw ""the rules"" to the four winds? Things are SO crippled by political correctness today, and that is why most ""modern"" TV programming can't hold a candle to this bonfire. Nobody's feelings were spared, and guess what? People laughed anyway! Today's television exec's can learn a thing or two from releases like this. Guess what? PEOPLE LIKE THIS STUFF!""All In The Family's"" cast is populated with people I wouldn't like if I knew them: Archie Bunker is a loud-mouth bigot, Mike is a loud-mouth bleeding-heart liberal, Edith is an air-head, and Gloria is a whiny, spoiled brat. But basing your like or dislike of a program on liking the people in the show, is fatal to the viewing experience. All four key cast members are top-notch actors, and they do a magnificent job. They are 100% believable. Most households have several high-volume arguments a week, and this is one reason the show has such enduring popularity: the fights, particularly between Mike and Archie, are legendary. And funny. EXTREMELY funny. And the irony is, the presence of Edith. On the surface, she's downright stupid. But, watch a little closer; she's got a certain worldly wisdom to her, and actually, she's the glue that holds the family unit together. The shrill voice and rambling conversations, annoying as they are, are downright hilarious, especially when Archie is trying to make her stop.Watching these classic shows, the time really does fly by. I could have knocked a star off because the discs are stacked in the case, one on top of another, on yet another, and you have to navigate to each show individually (unless you have a programming feature on your disc player), but in this case, the sum is way more than its parts.Again, this was quite possibly the funniest show ever to air on TV.

No previous sitcom was anything like this. Norman Lear created AITF inspired by a UK sitcom,""Till Death Do Us Part"". Richard Dreyfuss auditioned for Rob Reiner's role of Michael Stivic before he(Dreyfuss) became a movie star. Dreyfuss and Reiner had attended Beverly Hills High School together. AITF,however,was not an immediate hit. It had become a hit in 1971-72. There was a flashback episode in a later season where Mike Stivic had met the Bunkers. What happens? Archie calls Mike a meathead meaning ""dead from the neck up"". Mike leaves repeatedly yelling to Archie, ""You're prejudice"" while Archie is singing ""God Bless America"". Mike had a beard in that scene. Also,the late Vincent Gardenia is seen,not as his later recurring character Frank Lorenzo,but as Jim Bowman,a neighbor of the Bunkers' who sold his house to Louise and Lionel Jefferson,seen shortly thereafter.

I never really watched the show until last year and now I never miss it.  It's absolutely hilarious.  Carroll O'Connor was (in my humble opinion) a comic genius in his own right.For the record, two pilot episodes were created for &quot;All In The Family&quot;.  The first pilot from 1968 was entitled &quot;And Justice For All&quot; which was rejected by ABC.  This pilot episode is considered LOST, therefore it is understandable why it is not on the set.However, in 1971 creator Norman Lear created a 2nd pilot for the show which was originally titled &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; which was produced in 1969.  Up until the early '90s, this pilot episode was lost, and apparently now is aired on TV Land.What I don't understand is why they couldn't include this pilot episode on the set.  It makes no sense to me.  This reason, and this reason only is why I will not purchase the set.  Nowadays with television series' being released on DVD, 9 times out of 10, the pilot IS included.  So the &quot;All In The Family&quot; set will always feel somewhat incomplete as far as I'm concerned.But still, if you're a fan of the show, you really can't go wrong, as long as you're willing to forgive this little misconception on the part of Columbia/Tri Star home video.",3,Worth Every Cent..........Despite Lack Of The Pilot,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,1353,"['must', 'say', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'buy', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'fan', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'show', 'last', 'year', 'now', 'never', 'miss', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'was', 'humble', 'opinion', 'comic', 'genius', 'own', 'right.For', 'record', 'two', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'were', 'created', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'first', 'pilot', '1968', 'was', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Justice', 'All', 'quot', 'was', 'rejected', 'ABC', 'pilot', 'episode', 'considered', 'LOST', 'understandable', 'why', 'not', 'set.However', '1971', 'creator', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'created', '2nd', 'pilot', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'titled', 'quot', 'Days', 'quot', 'was', 'produced', '1969', 'early', ""'90s"", 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'lost', 'apparently', 'now', 'aired', 'TV', 'Land.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'include', 'pilot', 'episode', 'set', 'sense', 'reason', 'reason', 'only', 'why', 'will', 'not', 'purchase', 'set', 'television', 'series', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', '9', 'times', '10', 'pilot', 'IS', 'included', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'set', 'will', 'always', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'incomplete', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.But', 'still', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'willing', 'forgive', 'little', 'misconception', 'part', 'Columbia/Tri', 'Star', 'home', 'video']",N/A

688767,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B00005Y4RZ,"B-MAN ""B""","[6, 10]","but ALL IN THE FAMILY on DVD won't be or will it? I almost always wait until I own a DVD before I review it so I can give a detailed account of everything that is on it, so I decided to come back and update my review since I just received this DVD set today. Obviously the show is 5+ stars in quality but my 3 star review is for presentation on DVD. I had already heard that this DVD set was going to be a ""bare bones"" set with no extra features. In my opinion, that was a bit of an understatement. First, there are NO extra features - NO commentary, behind the scenes, interviews, photo galleries, and not even bios of the cast. Second, there is no ""play all"" episodes feature or ""scene selection"". So you have to select the episode you want to watch each time and you can't skip to the beginning scene instead of watching the opening ""those were the days"" song. The sound is english mono which didn't really surprise me but I did have to turn up the TV a little more than normal. The subtitle options are english and spanish. The packaging is a ""tri-fold"" case (like Fawlty Towers) which I kind of like because its compact. The discs are clear on the surface which will pick up fingerprints very easily. Concerning the content itself, this set features the first season - consisting of 13 episodes on three discs. Discs 1 & 2 have 4 episodes each and Disc 3 has 5 episodes. The set could have easily consisted of two discs, especially with the absence of any extra features. The episodes in this set (as titled from the included booklet)are:01. Meet the Bunkers02. Writing the President03. Oh, My Aching Back04. Judging Books by Covers05. Archie Gives Blood06. Gloria's Pregnancy07. Mike's Hippie Friends Come to Visit08. Lionel Moves into the Neighborhood09. Edith has Jury Duty10. Archie is Worried About his Job11. Gloria Discovers Women's Lib12. Success Story13. The First and Last SupperI hate to say it, but in terms of presentation of this DVD set, those involved sort of ""dropped the ball"". I think that the sound and transfer could have been better.  Also only 4-5 25 minute episodes on each disc without anything else on the discs? I feel that it was rushed out on 3 discs for profit reasons and it wasnt given the care and presentation it so deserved. 3 disc sets are fine (see other popular shows on 3 discs) if they have a good amount of extras.  I really hope that Season 2 is released with much more care and features! At the top of this package it says ""The Emmy Award-Winning, Ground-Breaking Series"" - Well any series worthy of that label deserves much much more in way of features and design. ALL IN THE FAMILY deserves this not only because of it's importance in television history and the memory of Carroll O' Connor, but for the many fans who will cherish owning the series in digital form. Don't get me wrong this DVD set is still much better than the VHS compilations wether you buy them or tape them off television, but thats to be expected right? Its DVD! This DVD set can easily be recommended because well its DVD. That and because this is the only way you can get the ""unedited"", commercial free, complete first season of ALL IN THE FAMILY. So if you can rejoice in that alone (and you really don't have a choice if you want this show) then I say order yours today. I had to have one or else I would've felt like a ""weird wolf""!",3,Meathead may be a person of very little quality...,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,3359,"['IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'will', 'almost', 'always', 'wait', 'own', 'DVD', 'review', 'can', 'give', 'detailed', 'account', 'everything', 'decided', 'come', 'back', 'update', 'review', 'just', 'received', 'DVD', 'set', 'today', 'Obviously', 'show', '5+', 'stars', 'quality', '3', 'star', 'review', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'had', 'already', 'heard', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bare', 'bones', 'set', 'extra', 'features', 'opinion', 'was', 'bit', 'understatement', 'First', 'are', 'NO', 'extra', 'features', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'photo', 'galleries', 'not', 'even', 'bios', 'cast', 'Second', 'play', 'feature', 'scene', 'selection', 'have', 'select', 'episode', 'want', 'watch', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'beginning', 'scene', 'instead', 'watching', 'opening', 'were', 'days', 'song', 'sound', 'english', 'mono', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', 'did', 'have', 'turn', 'up', 'TV', 'little', 'more', 'normal', 'subtitle', 'options', 'are', 'english', 'spanish', 'packaging', 'tri-fold', 'case', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'kind', 'like', 'compact', 'discs', 'are', 'clear', 'surface', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'fingerprints', 'very', 'easily', 'Concerning', 'content', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'consisting', '13', 'episodes', 'three', 'discs', 'Discs', '1', '2', 'have', '4', 'episodes', 'Disc', '3', '5', 'episodes', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'consisted', 'two', 'discs', 'especially', 'absence', 'extra', 'features', 'episodes', 'set', 'titled', 'included', 'booklet', 'are:01', 'Meet', 'Bunkers02', 'Writing', 'President03', 'Oh', 'My', 'Aching', 'Back04', 'Judging', 'Books', 'Covers05', 'Archie', 'Blood06', 'Gloria', 'Pregnancy07', 'Mike', 'Hippie', 'Friends', 'Come', 'Visit08', 'Lionel', 'Neighborhood09', 'Edith', 'Jury', 'Duty10', 'Archie', 'Worried', 'Job11', 'Gloria', 'Discovers', 'Women', 'Lib12', 'Success', 'Story13', 'First', 'Last', 'SupperI', 'hate', 'say', 'terms', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'set', 'involved', 'sort', 'dropped', 'ball', 'think', 'sound', 'transfer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Also', 'only', '4-5', '25', 'minute', 'episodes', 'disc', 'anything', 'else', 'discs', 'feel', 'was', 'rushed', 'out', '3', 'discs', 'profit', 'reasons', 'wasnt', 'given', 'care', 'presentation', 'so', 'deserved', '3', 'disc', 'sets', 'are', 'fine', 'see', 'other', 'popular', 'shows', '3', 'discs', 'have', 'good', 'amount', 'extras', 'really', 'hope', 'Season', '2', 'released', 'much', 'more', 'care', 'top', 'package', 'Emmy', 'Award-Winning', 'Ground-Breaking', 'Series', 'Well', 'series', 'worthy', 'label', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'way', 'features', 'design', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'not', 'only', 'importance', 'television', 'history', 'memory', 'Carroll', 'O', 'Connor', 'many', 'fans', 'who', 'will', 'cherish', 'owning', 'series', 'digital', 'form', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'set', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'VHS', 'compilations', 'wether', 'buy', 'tape', 'off', 'television', 'thats', 'be', 'expected', 'right', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'recommended', 'because', 'well', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'unedited', 'commercial', 'free', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'ALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'So', 'can', 'rejoice', 'alone', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'want', 'show', 'then', 'say', 'order', 'yours', 'today', 'had', 'have', 'one', 'else', 'would', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'weird', 'wolf']",N/A
688768,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00005Y4RZ,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 2]","Granted, I'm not the biggest ""All in the Family"" fan. So other reviewers may give this a better review.But from my view, I think we miss the point of this show if we just see Archie as a bigot here. In this 1st season, he is seen as a bigot who hates almost everyone. He is always yelling at his son in law Michael; he calls Edith some 'not so nice names.' And he can be very unpleasant. (Though still funny.)BUT, BUT, I think we need to watch this knowing that he's going to mellow quite a bit during the series. He doesn't like Jews. But eventually he will not only take care of a 10 year old Jewish girl, but he will go into business with a Jewish man. (Murray Klein) He doesn't like Spanish people. But eventually he will allow a Spanish medical student to stay in his house.He is always making remarks about his son in law Michael. But he will cry heavily when Michael moves out. He calls Edith all sorts of names. But after she dies, he will find one of her slippers and fall into tears.I may not be the biggest fan of this show. But I do feel we have to watch it knowing that Archie is a bigoted man who will gradually learn to not only accept, but love as well.A side note we should keep in mind is that in later seasons, we can see that while Michael and Gloria see Archie as vicious, Archie sees Michael and Gloria as vicious. (A point underlined in Season 3's ""Everybody Tells the Truth."")As far as this season goes, I think my favorite episode was # 12 (""Success Story""). Archie is unusually nice to Michael here. We can see that whatever Archie feels about Michael, he will not insult Michael in front of guests. There is also a touching sadness in that Archie thinks his very rich friend Eddie is so happy, and Eddie confesses to Michael how sad he really is.All in all, this is an interesting saga of a bigot who over 9 seasons of this show and 4 seasons of the sequel show ""Archie's Place"" gradually learns to not only accept, but love.",3,The Start of a Long Journey,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,1952,"['Granted', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'Family', 'fan', 'other', 'reviewers', 'may', 'give', 'better', 'review.But', 'view', 'think', 'miss', 'point', 'show', 'just', 'see', 'Archie', 'bigot', 'here', '1st', 'season', 'seen', 'bigot', 'who', 'almost', 'everyone', 'always', 'yelling', 'son', 'law', 'Michael', 'Edith', ""'not"", 'nice', 'names', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'still', 'funny', 'BUT', 'BUT', 'think', 'need', 'watch', 'knowing', 'going', 'mellow', 'quite', 'bit', 'series', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jews', 'eventually', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'care', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'will', 'go', 'business', 'Jewish', 'man', 'Murray', 'Klein', ""n't"", 'like', 'Spanish', 'people', 'eventually', 'will', 'allow', 'Spanish', 'medical', 'student', 'stay', 'house.He', 'always', 'making', 'remarks', 'son', 'law', 'Michael', 'will', 'cry', 'heavily', 'when', 'Michael', 'out', 'Edith', 'sorts', 'names', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'slippers', 'fall', 'tears.I', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'biggest', 'fan', 'show', 'do', 'feel', 'have', 'watch', 'knowing', 'Archie', 'bigoted', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'gradually', 'learn', 'not', 'only', 'accept', 'love', 'well.A', 'side', 'note', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'later', 'seasons', 'can', 'see', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'see', 'Archie', 'vicious', 'Archie', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'vicious', 'point', 'underlined', 'Season', '3', 'Everybody', 'Truth', 'As', 'far', 'season', 'think', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', '12', 'Success', 'Story', 'Archie', 'unusually', 'nice', 'Michael', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'Archie', 'Michael', 'will', 'not', 'insult', 'Michael', 'front', 'guests', 'also', 'touching', 'sadness', 'Archie', 'very', 'rich', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'so', 'happy', 'Eddie', 'Michael', 'how', 'sad', 'really', 'is.All', 'interesting', 'saga', 'bigot', 'who', '9', 'seasons', 'show', '4', 'seasons', 'sequel', 'show', 'Archie', 'Place', 'gradually', 'not', 'only', 'accept', 'love']",N/A
688769,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005Y4RZ,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 6]","The #1 Nielsen rated program from 1971 to 1976, All In The Family is quite simply one of the greatest television programs in history. Inspired by The Honeymooners and The Flintstones, All In The Family features its own loud-mouthed, opinionated blowhard sporting a hidden soft and sensitive side. Like Ralph Kramden and Fred Flintstone, Archie Bunker fulfills his role to absolute perfection, and the result is TV magic. Well-written and outright hilarious, All In The Family broke ground in the 70's with its willingness to tackle all the social issues and societal taboos of its day. Topics included racism, bigotry, sexism, homosexuality, death, and other namby-pam, socialist and liberal-feminist ideals (or at least that's how Archie would put it!) A titan among television sitcoms, All In The Family spawned a pair of shows which topped the ratings in their own right - Maude and The Jeffersons...Carroll O'Connor plays the role of Archie Bunker, the titular head of the Bunker household. Loud and crass, Archie freely dispenses his bigoted remarks and ignorant comments from the living room of his Queens, New York home. Joining Archie is his loving and ditsy wife Edith (Jean Stapelton), his beautiful and progressive daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), and her ultra-liberal husband Mike (Rob Reiner) whom Archie refers to as ""Meathead"". As Gloria and Mike's modern ideas clash with Archie's old school beliefs, all hell breaks loose in the Bunker household, but the Bunkers don't spend all their time arguing as they're inevitably held together by the immutable bond of love...The All In The Family DVD (Season 1) features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Meet the Bunkers"" in which it's Edith and Archie's anniversary, and Edith manages to drag a reluctant Archie to church. Meanwhile, Mike and Gloria work overtime to create a celebration the Bunkers will never forget... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Archie Gives Blood"" in which Archie refuses to participate in the blood drive because he's afraid of having his blood mixed with that of another race, and ""Edith Has Jury Duty"" in which Edith's conviction to hold steadfast as the lone juror in favor of a defendant's acquittal proves correct when the true culprit comes forward...Below is a list of episodes included on the All In The Family (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Meet the Bunkers)Episode 2 (Writing the President)Episode 3 (Oh, My Aching Back)Episode 4 (Archie Gives Blood)Episode 5 (Judging Books By Covers)Episode 6 (Gloria's Pregnancy)Episode 7 (Mike's Hippie Friends Come to Visit)Episode 8 (Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood)Episode 9 (Edith Has Jury Duty)Episode 10 (Archie is Worried About His Job)Episode 11 (Gloria Discovers Women's Lib)Episode 12 (Success Story)Episode 13 (The First and Last Supper)The DVD Report",5,Season 1 of an instant television classic!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2838,"['1', 'Nielsen', 'rated', 'program', '1971', '1976', 'Family', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'television', 'programs', 'history', 'Inspired', 'Honeymooners', 'Flintstones', 'All', 'Family', 'own', 'loud-mouthed', 'opinionated', 'blowhard', 'sporting', 'hidden', 'soft', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', 'Fred', 'Flintstone', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'role', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'result', 'TV', 'magic', 'Well-written', 'outright', 'hilarious', 'Family', 'broke', 'ground', '70', 'willingness', 'tackle', 'social', 'issues', 'societal', 'taboos', 'day', 'Topics', 'included', 'racism', 'bigotry', 'sexism', 'homosexuality', 'death', 'other', 'namby-pam', 'socialist', 'liberal-feminist', 'ideals', 'least', 'how', 'Archie', 'would', 'put', 'titan', 'television', 'sitcoms', 'Family', 'spawned', 'pair', 'shows', 'topped', 'ratings', 'own', 'right', 'Maude', 'Jeffersons', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'role', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'titular', 'head', 'Bunker', 'household', 'Loud', 'crass', 'Archie', 'freely', 'bigoted', 'remarks', 'ignorant', 'comments', 'living', 'room', 'Queens', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'Joining', 'Archie', 'loving', 'ditsy', 'wife', 'Edith', 'Jean', 'Stapelton', 'beautiful', 'progressive', 'daughter', 'Gloria', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'ultra-liberal', 'husband', 'Mike', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'whom', 'Archie', 'refers', 'Meathead', 'Gloria', 'Mike', 'modern', 'ideas', 'clash', 'Archie', 'old', 'school', 'beliefs', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Bunker', 'household', 'Bunkers', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'arguing', ""'re"", 'inevitably', 'held', 'together', 'immutable', 'bond', 'love', 'All', 'Family', 'DVD', 'Season', '1', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Meet', 'Bunkers', 'Edith', 'Archie', 'anniversary', 'Edith', 'manages', 'drag', 'reluctant', 'Archie', 'church', 'Meanwhile', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'work', 'overtime', 'create', 'celebration', 'Bunkers', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Archie', 'Blood', 'Archie', 'participate', 'blood', 'drive', 'afraid', 'having', 'blood', 'mixed', 'race', 'Edith', 'Has', 'Jury', 'Duty', 'Edith', 'conviction', 'hold', 'steadfast', 'lone', 'juror', 'favor', 'defendant', 'acquittal', 'proves', 'correct', 'when', 'true', 'culprit', 'forward', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'All', 'Family', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Meet', 'Bunkers', 'Episode', '2', 'Writing', 'President', 'Episode', '3', 'Oh', 'My', 'Aching', 'Back', 'Episode', '4', 'Archie', 'Gives', 'Blood', 'Episode', '5', 'Judging', 'Books', 'Covers', 'Episode', '6', 'Gloria', 'Pregnancy', 'Episode', '7', 'Mike', 'Hippie', 'Friends', 'Come', 'Visit', 'Episode', '8', 'Lionel', 'Into', 'Neighborhood', 'Episode', '9', 'Edith', 'Has', 'Jury', 'Duty', 'Episode', '10', 'Archie', 'Worried', 'Job', 'Episode', '11', 'Gloria', 'Discovers', 'Women', 'Lib', 'Episode', '12', 'Success', 'Story', 'Episode', '13', 'First', 'Last', 'Supper', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

It was very well-written and well-acted, at least for the first few seasons. TV audiences had never seen anything quite like it and they were hooked!No one was prepared for a character like Archie Bunker. Here was a man who had opinions and ideas that were quite repulsive to the average American. Or at least that we claimed were repulsive. In truth, his views were and are shared by a great many people. Watching the show now I was amazed at how recent it all feels. The only thing different, really, is that Archie, a hard-core Republican neo-con before neo-cons existed, was also a staunch union member. That wouldn't be the same if the show was done now. Admitedly, nowadays you don't have people talking quite as directly about their prejudices as Archie did, but they're still there, just lurking in the back of the mind and coming out in code (ie: ""Urban"" instead of ""colored"").Sadly, this series is given the shaft on DVD. It has even less extras than early Paramount DVDs, where they'd list ""Chapter Stops"" as a special feature (one which this DVD set lacks, btw). Given that all the main actors, plus Norman Lear, are still alive and kicking (except Caroll O'Connor, of course), one would think they would have at the very least assembled them for an audio commentary on the pilot. But no. No retrospectives, no commentaries, no news clips on the controversy of the show, nothing. That is the one and only reason this set gets three stars instead of five. It's still worth owning for the episodes, but otherwise... eh. They could've done a lot better. Mind you, seasons two and three, which I also own, didn't improve on this any.

688779,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00005Y4RZ,David Von Pein,"[24, 25]","What a treat to have all of these famous Archie-isms now on DVD.  Carroll O'Connor's Archie Bunker shall live forever as one of the finest characters ever created for the small screen.  Always controversial, but always well-written, was the character of Archibald Bunker of 704 Houser Street in Queens.These 13 first-season episodes of &quot;All In The Family&quot; (as well as nearly the entire batch of episodes contained in the Season Two follow-up DVD boxed set) are some of my favorites of the entire series (which ran for all or part of nine seasons, from January 1971 to April 1979).The debut episode, which probably had the show's creators on pins and needles when it first aired, is a fabulous premiere program for Archie and his gang.  Take note how Edith, in show #1, isn't quite the totally dominated housewife that she'd become in later episodes.  She holds her own a few times with her hubby in the &quot;Meet The Bunkers&quot; debut.  Such as her jab at Archie about the church service they just attended: &quot;Mister religion here wasn't quite seeing eye to eye with the sermon&quot;.  :)You'll get to see the entire &quot;epilogue&quot; sequences for each program on these DVDs as well, rather than the usual trimmed-down-for-more-commercials versions that are likely to be shown on broadcast TV.Other first-rate Season One episodic Archie adventures include such Classics as &quot;Lionel Moves Into The Neighborhood&quot; (which features the burst-out-loud hilarious &quot;Watermelon Rinds&quot; Archie-ism!); &quot;Edith Has Jury Duty&quot;; and &quot;Archie Gives Blood&quot;.The picture quality is, sadly, not very good on this set of DVDs.  Not much better, if any, than VHS quality. Many scenes are downright blurry; and might have you rubbing your eyes.  But keep in mind the age of these programs, and the added fact that the show was shot on &quot;tape&quot; in the first place (not &quot;film&quot;), which is bound to take the quality of any video release down a few notches.No chapter stops are included either. Nor is a &quot;slipcase&quot; box for housing the fold-out package containing the actual discs. (But that latter point is just a picky one; for there's no real risk of the discs getting damaged by having no outer box/carton.  My discs, thus far, have not burst into flames, nor have they fled to Cuba on their own, for lack of a more durable and appropriate outer package.)  :)Sound quality isn't really anything to write home about either.  It's a mono soundtrack being utilized on the discs, and sounds quite &quot;tinny&quot; and harsh at times.  But the dialogue, in general, is still very well understood, which is the most important thing.Even with the negatives about the video quality, lack of extras (there's absolutely none here), no slipcase, and no chapter selections, this boxed set of the first thirteen episodes of &quot;All In The Family&quot; still comes very highly recommended by this Archie Bunker fan!  Because, even a blurry and grainy Archie on DVD is certainly better than no Mr. Bunker whatsoever!",5,Good News: Archie Bunker's On DVD!,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,3064,"['What', 'treat', 'have', 'famous', 'Archie-isms', 'now', 'DVD', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'shall', 'live', 'forever', 'one', 'finest', 'characters', 'ever', 'created', 'small', 'screen', 'Always', 'controversial', 'always', 'well-written', 'was', 'character', 'Archibald', 'Bunker', '704', 'Houser', 'Street', 'Queens.These', '13', 'first-season', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'nearly', 'entire', 'batch', 'episodes', 'contained', 'Season', 'Two', 'follow-up', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'are', 'favorites', 'entire', 'series', 'ran', 'part', 'nine', 'seasons', 'January', '1971', 'April', '1979', '.The', 'debut', 'episode', 'probably', 'had', 'show', 'creators', 'pins', 'needles', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'fabulous', 'premiere', 'program', 'Archie', 'gang', 'Take', 'note', 'how', 'Edith', 'show', '1', ""n't"", 'quite', 'totally', 'dominated', 'housewife', ""'d"", 'become', 'later', 'episodes', 'own', 'few', 'times', 'hubby', 'quot', 'Meet', 'Bunkers', 'quot', 'debut', 'Such', 'jab', 'Archie', 'church', 'service', 'just', 'attended', 'quot', 'Mister', 'religion', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seeing', 'eye', 'eye', 'sermon', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'entire', 'quot', 'quot', 'sequences', 'program', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'usual', 'trimmed-down-for-more-commercials', 'versions', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'shown', 'broadcast', 'TV.Other', 'first-rate', 'Season', 'One', 'episodic', 'Archie', 'include', 'such', 'Classics', 'quot', 'Lionel', 'Into', 'Neighborhood', 'quot', 'burst-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'quot', 'Watermelon', 'Rinds', 'quot', 'Archie-ism', 'quot', 'Edith', 'Has', 'Jury', 'Duty', 'quot', 'quot', 'Archie', 'Gives', 'Blood', 'quot', 'picture', 'quality', 'sadly', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'set', 'DVDs', 'Not', 'much', 'better', 'VHS', 'quality', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'downright', 'blurry', 'might', 'have', 'rubbing', 'eyes', 'keep', 'mind', 'age', 'programs', 'added', 'fact', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'quot', 'tape', 'quot', 'first', 'place', 'not', 'quot', 'film', 'quot', 'bound', 'take', 'quality', 'video', 'release', 'down', 'few', 'notches.No', 'chapter', 'stops', 'are', 'included', 'either', 'quot', 'slipcase', 'quot', 'box', 'housing', 'fold-out', 'package', 'containing', 'actual', 'discs', 'latter', 'point', 'just', 'picky', 'one', 'real', 'risk', 'discs', 'getting', 'damaged', 'having', 'outer', 'box/carton', 'My', 'discs', 'thus', 'far', 'have', 'not', 'burst', 'flames', 'have', 'fled', 'Cuba', 'own', 'lack', 'more', 'durable', 'appropriate', 'outer', 'package', 'Sound', 'quality', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'being', 'utilized', 'discs', 'quite', 'quot', 'quot', 'harsh', 'times', 'dialogue', 'general', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'understood', 'most', 'important', 'thing.Even', 'negatives', 'video', 'quality', 'lack', 'extras', 'absolutely', 'none', 'here', 'slipcase', 'chapter', 'selections', 'boxed', 'set', 'first', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Family', 'quot', 'still', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'fan', 'even', 'blurry', 'grainy', 'Archie', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'better', 'Mr.', 'Bunker']",N/A

The sitcom revolves around blue-collar worker Archie Bunker (played by the beloved Carroll O'Connor) and his family. A bigot, Archie makes no bones about his racial and political views. His wife Edith, who he refers to as Dingbat, is ditzy, but her sweetness and good heart provide a perfect balance for the harsh character of Archie. Also residing in the Bunker house is Archie's daughter Gloria and her husband Michael. Some of the greatest commentary and comedic moments come from the verbal sparring between the narrow-minded Archie and the thoughtful, liberal Meathead.In this collection, you'll be getting the following episodes:1. ""Meet The Bunkers""- It's Archie and Edith's wedding anniversary, so Gloria and Mike try to whip up a party atmosphere for them.2. ""Writing the President""- Upon learning that Mike has written a letter of criticism to President Nixon, Archie becomes so upset that he writes a letter of his own in praise of Nixon.3. ""Oh, My Aching Back""- Archie tries to sue for whiplash after a minor auto accident and seeks out a Jewish lawyer to fight the case for him.4. ""Archie Gives Blood""- Archie becomes a blood donor, but he insists on knowing who the blood will be going to because his theory is ""black blood"" is different from ""white blood.""5. ""Judging Books By Covers""- Archie ridicules one of Mike and Gloria's friends for being gay.6. ""Gloria's Pregnancy""- Archie goes through the ceiling when he finds out that Gloria is going to have a baby and Mike has no means of supporting the child.7. ""Mike's Hippie Friends Come To Visit""- Mike invites a young couple to spend the night at the Bunker house, but runs into objections when Archie finds out the visitors are not married.8. ""Lionel Moves Into The Neighborhood""- Archie tries to prevent a black family from moving into his neighborhood. The family turns out to be the Bunkers' friend Lionel Jefferson and his parents.9. ""Edith Has Jury Duty""- Over Archie's objection, Edith accepts a call to serve on a jury hearing a murder case which may keep her away from home for weeks.10. ""Archie Is Worried About His Job""- Archie spends a sleepless night worrying because he thinks he's about to lose his job.11. ""Gloria Discovers Women's Lib""- Gloria discovers Women's Lib and winds up moving out of the Bunker household after an argument with Mike during which she demands that he treat her as an equal.12. ""Success Story""- After Eddie Frazier, a wealthy friend of Archie's, arrives from Beverly Hills, Archie organizes a reunion of their old army buddies.13. ""The First And Last Supper""- At the same time that Archie is circulating a petition to keep more black families from moving into the neighborhood, Edith accepts an invitation to have dinner with the Jeffersons.

Meet The Bunkers (12/1/71): Title explains it all, introduces us to the zany world of bigot Archie Bunker (the late, great Carroll O'Connor, RIP), slow-witted wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), their daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), and her liberal, anti-Archie husband Mike Stivic (Rob Reiner). Also introduced in this episode is Lionel Jefferson (Mike Evans, RIP). Gloria and Mike serve Archie and Edith an anniversary brunch, only for a big argument to break out between Archie and Mike. Sets the tone for the series. 7.5/102. Writing The President (19/1/71): Mike writes a letter to Richard Nixon about what's wrong in the US, Archie responds by writing a letter to Nixon about what's right. 8/103. Oh, My Aching Back (26/1/71): Archie has a minor fender-bender with a Jewish woman, and doesn't care until Lionel tells him about his parents getting money from a lawsuit. 8/104. Archie Gives Blood (2/2/71): Mike goes down to the blood bank to donate blood and asks Archie if he'd like to do the same, though Archie doesn't want his blood in the body of a person of a different race. 8/105. Judging Books By Covers (9/2/71): Roger, a friend of Mike and Gloria's stops by for a visit. When Archie looks at him, he immediately writes him off as gay. 7/106. Gloria's Pregnancy (16/2/71): Gloria comes home from the doctor's and tells everyone she's pregnant. An argument between Archie and Mike follows and Mike quits school, gets a job in Detroit and plans to move there, only halted when Gloria suffers a miscarriage. 6.5/107. Mike's Hippie Friends Come To Visit (23/2/71): Some of Mike's hippie friends need somewhere to stay before flying to Europe, and of course, Archie disapproves of an unmarried couple under his roof 8/108. Lionel Moves Into The Neighbourhood (2/3/71): Archie's old neighbour sells his house, which puts him into a fear of a Jewish family moving into the neighbourhood, but they happen to be a black family, namely the Jeffersons - Lionel, his mother Louise (Isabel Sanford, RIP), father George (Sherman Hemsley, not seen until Season 4) and uncle Henry (Mel Stewart, first seen in finale of this season). 8/109. Edith Has Jury Duty (9/3/71): Edith is chosen for jury duty, which naturally excites her as she never gets out of the house (courtesy of Archie, who wants her to stay and cook and clean for him). Archie must fend for himself in the prolonged trial period. 8.5/1010. Archie Is Worried About His Job (16/3/71): Archie stays up all night, worried he might lose his job as the company is in the midst of cuts. Edith, Gloria and Mike can't sleep either and an array of people come to the front door. 9/1011. Gloria Discover's Women's Lib (23/3/71): Gloria discover's women's lib and tries to get Edith involved in it. When Mike doesn't approve of Gloria's ways, she gets angry and storms off. 8.5/1012. Success Story (30/3/71): One day in the Bunker household, a delivery man brings two gifts, both for Archie (fancy cigars and assorted alcohol), from his friend Eddie Frazier (William Windom), who's made it big in the used car business, though Mike thinks Eddie isn't as successful as he's made out to be. 7.5/1013. The First And Last Supper (6/4/71): Archie's all ready for the Mets game, but Edith's already agreed to go to dinner with the Jeffersons. Archie makes up an excuse, as does George, who sends his brother Henry over to the Bunker house instead. 8/10Whilst the first season isn't as good as later seasons (I'm watching Season 4 at the moment), it's definitely worth picking up if you love comedies and/or you're sick of modern television and want some stuff from the good ol' days.LONG LIVE THE BUNKERS!",5,The Key To The Door,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,4032,"['Family', 'first', 'highly', 'groundbreaking', 'season', 'eat', 'dust', 'Green', 'Acres', 'premiered', 'extremely', 'shaky', 'CBS', '10', 'million', 'people', 'January', '12', '1971', 'hilarious', 'thought-provoking', 'comedy', 'unlocked', 'taboo', 'issues', 'threw', 'television', 'screen', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before.Here', 'episode-by-episode', 'thoughts', 'Note', 'episodes', 'are', 'airdate', 'order', ':1', 'Meet', 'Bunkers', '12/1/71', 'Title', 'introduces', 'zany', 'world', 'bigot', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'late', 'great', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'RIP', 'slow-witted', 'wife', 'Edith', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'daughter', 'Gloria', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'liberal', 'anti-Archie', 'husband', 'Mike', 'Stivic', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Also', 'introduced', 'episode', 'Lionel', 'Jefferson', 'Mike', 'Evans', 'RIP', 'Gloria', 'Mike', 'serve', 'Archie', 'Edith', 'anniversary', 'brunch', 'only', 'big', 'argument', 'break', 'out', 'Archie', 'Mike', 'tone', 'series', '7.5/102', 'Writing', 'President', '19/1/71', 'Mike', 'letter', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'what', 'wrong', 'US', 'Archie', 'writing', 'letter', 'Nixon', 'what', 'right', '8/103', 'Oh', 'My', 'Aching', 'Back', '26/1/71', 'Archie', 'minor', 'fender-bender', 'Jewish', 'woman', ""n't"", 'care', 'Lionel', 'parents', 'getting', 'money', 'lawsuit', '8/104', 'Archie', 'Blood', '2/2/71', 'Mike', 'down', 'blood', 'bank', 'donate', 'blood', 'Archie', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'same', 'Archie', ""n't"", 'want', 'blood', 'body', 'person', 'different', 'race', '8/105', 'Judging', 'Books', 'Covers', '9/2/71', 'Roger', 'friend', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'stops', 'visit', 'When', 'Archie', 'immediately', 'off', 'gay', '7/106', 'Gloria', 'Pregnancy', '16/2/71', 'Gloria', 'home', 'doctor', 'everyone', 'pregnant', 'argument', 'Archie', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'school', 'job', 'Detroit', 'plans', 'move', 'there', 'only', 'halted', 'when', 'Gloria', 'miscarriage', '6.5/107', 'Mike', 'Hippie', 'Friends', 'Come', 'Visit', '23/2/71', 'Mike', 'hippie', 'friends', 'need', 'somewhere', 'stay', 'flying', 'Europe', 'course', 'Archie', 'unmarried', 'couple', 'roof', '8/108', 'Lionel', 'Into', 'Neighbourhood', '2/3/71', 'Archie', 'old', 'neighbour', 'house', 'fear', 'Jewish', 'family', 'moving', 'neighbourhood', 'happen', 'be', 'black', 'family', 'namely', 'Jeffersons', 'Lionel', 'mother', 'Louise', 'Isabel', 'Sanford', 'RIP', 'father', 'George', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'not', 'seen', 'Season', '4', 'uncle', 'Henry', 'Mel', 'Stewart', 'first', 'seen', 'finale', 'season', '8/109', 'Edith', 'Has', 'Jury', 'Duty', '9/3/71', 'Edith', 'chosen', 'jury', 'duty', 'naturally', 'never', 'house', 'courtesy', 'Archie', 'who', 'stay', 'cook', 'clean', 'Archie', 'must', 'fend', 'prolonged', 'trial', 'period', '8.5/1010', 'Archie', 'Worried', 'Job', '16/3/71', 'Archie', 'up', 'night', 'worried', 'might', 'lose', 'job', 'company', 'midst', 'cuts', 'Edith', 'Gloria', 'Mike', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'either', 'array', 'people', 'come', 'front', 'door', '9/1011', 'Gloria', 'Discover', 'Women', 'Lib', '23/3/71', 'Gloria', 'discover', 'women', 'lib', 'tries', 'get', 'Edith', 'involved', 'When', 'Mike', ""n't"", 'approve', 'Gloria', 'ways', 'angry', 'storms', '8.5/1012', 'Success', 'Story', '30/3/71', 'One', 'day', 'Bunker', 'household', 'delivery', 'man', 'two', 'gifts', 'Archie', 'fancy', 'cigars', 'assorted', 'alcohol', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'Frazier', 'William', 'Windom', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'used', 'car', 'business', 'Mike', 'Eddie', ""n't"", 'as', 'successful', 'made', 'out', 'be', '7.5/1013', 'First', 'Last', 'Supper', '6/4/71', 'Archie', 'ready', 'Mets', 'game', 'Edith', 'already', 'agreed', 'go', 'dinner', 'Jeffersons', 'Archie', 'up', 'excuse', 'George', 'who', 'brother', 'Henry', 'Bunker', 'house', 'instead', '8/10Whilst', 'first', 'season', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'later', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'watching', 'Season', '4', 'moment', 'definitely', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'love', 'comedies', 'and/or', ""'re"", 'sick', 'modern', 'television', 'want', 'stuff', 'good', 'ol', 'days.LONG', 'LIVE', 'BUNKERS']",N/A
688782,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B00005Y4RZ,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","I've been a fan of ""All in the Family"" from its inception in January 1971. I remember every week looking forward to the upcoming episode with great anticipation. I agreed with the assessment of a friend that it was ""the funniest half hour on television."" When summer reruns came, I watched them all. What was true of the first year was true of the next and of every year through the last season (season nine). And when reruns from earlier years began appearing on daytime TV, I watched whenever I could. Needless to say, I never tired of them. Thankfully, I now have the DVD's of all nine years.Being a midseason replacement, the first year consists of just 13 episodes. However, they represent some of the classics, including ""Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood"" (detailing the Jefferson's move into the house next door), ""Judging Books by Covers"" (in which Archie is convinced that a friend of Mike's is gay, only to find out that he isn't but that a former professional football player whom Archie knows and admires is), and ""Oh, My Aching Back"" (in which Archie tries to find a Jewish lawyer to get compensation for a supposed injury suffered in a minor accident, figuring that Jews make the best lawyers).In addition to there being some really great episodes in this series, the first year is worth watching and comparing to later years to see how each of the main characters developed over the years. In particular, one will notice that Edith becomes more assertive as time goes on. On the other hand, Archie, perhaps because of his experiences along the way, while he remains prejudiced, becomes less blatantly bigoted.",5,Great beginning,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1626,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Family', 'inception', 'January', '1971', 'remember', 'week', 'looking', 'forward', 'upcoming', 'episode', 'great', 'anticipation', 'agreed', 'assessment', 'friend', 'was', 'funniest', 'half', 'hour', 'television', 'When', 'summer', 'reruns', 'came', 'watched', 'What', 'was', 'true', 'first', 'year', 'was', 'true', 'next', 'year', 'last', 'season', 'season', 'nine', 'when', 'reruns', 'earlier', 'years', 'began', 'appearing', 'daytime', 'TV', 'watched', 'whenever', 'could', 'Needless', 'say', 'never', 'tired', 'Thankfully', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'nine', 'years.Being', 'midseason', 'replacement', 'first', 'year', 'just', '13', 'episodes', 'However', 'represent', 'classics', 'including', 'Lionel', 'Into', 'Neighborhood', 'detailing', 'Jefferson', 'move', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'Judging', 'Books', 'Covers', 'Archie', 'convinced', 'friend', 'Mike', 'gay', 'only', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'former', 'professional', 'football', 'player', 'whom', 'Archie', 'Oh', 'My', 'Aching', 'Back', 'Archie', 'find', 'Jewish', 'lawyer', 'get', 'compensation', 'supposed', 'injury', 'suffered', 'minor', 'accident', 'figuring', 'Jews', 'make', 'best', 'lawyers', '.In', 'addition', 'being', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'series', 'first', 'year', 'watching', 'comparing', 'later', 'years', 'see', 'how', 'main', 'characters', 'developed', 'years', 'particular', 'one', 'will', 'notice', 'Edith', 'more', 'assertive', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'Archie', 'perhaps', 'experiences', 'way', 'prejudiced', 'less', 'blatantly', 'bigoted']",N/A

But a heated discussion that leads to the question of whether or not Archie is predjudiced alters the party atmosphere.2.

Archie Gives Blood- Archie tries to chicken out of giving blood saying he is worried about who the recipient will be.6. Gloria's pregnancy-A very touching episode. Gloria discovers she is pregnant. Mike decides to quit college and get an apt. to support Gloria and the baby.7. Mike's hippie friends come to visit-Mike invites his unmarried hippie friends to spend the night and Archie objects.8. Lionel moves into the neighborhood-Archie's is not prepared for the first black family to move into the neighborhood.

The world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households.  Archie Bunker's old fashioned values were being challenged.

Not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion? Quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone.Certainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970's.  Carol O'Connor, Jean Stapelton, Sally Struthers, and Rob Reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times.

All In The Family evolved into one of TV's most successful series, and rightfully so.During the first season, it is clear that Jean Stapleton's character, Edith, was not as developed as the others. Toward the end of the first season, however, Stapleton had turned Edith into the vibrant character that continued for the duration.It is great to have an entire season, in chronological order, on one reasonably priced DVD set.

688795,A2F3VXUI3KBWIC,B00005Y4RZ,John McWhorter,"[12, 33]","As a 30-something TV fan, I am as titillated as anyone at the prospect of having a whole season of this show in my home and getting a look at shows I haven't seen since I was a kid. But watching these 13, I was surprised to find that the show really doesn't hold up nearly as well as, for example, SANFORD AND SON or MARY TYLER MOORE. I did not find these shows ""classic"" -- rather, the show, though pioneering in its time, is now a period piece.For one, the show shows its descent from old-style sitcoms more clearly than many of its time. Gloria, one gradually realizes, does not work -- she's just a stay-at-home wife as one would expect in, say, HAZEL -- which had only aired a few years before, after all. The directors shuffle the characters all over the set during dialogue without motivation just for ""flow"" -- i.e. people getting up from dinner and crossing the living room to emphasize a point -- as old sitcoms often did because their directors came from the theatre world. We remember this show for its ""relevance"" and ""freshness"" -- yet in a couple of episodes, a ""wacky neighbor"" walks on and spouts some irrelevant ""shtick"" lines as if this were JACK BENNY. O'Connor and Stapleton, both fresh from stage careers, play to the rafters, with O'Connor even getting sweaty under the arms, giving many episodes an air of THE HONEYMOONERS. Which was, after all, only 15 years in the past at the time.Which is to say that this show was more a product of its era than we often remember, especially in these early episodes -- and when other shows of its time were less so. Yet I remember the electric effect the show had when it premiered (though I was too young to understand much of it). Each episode broaches a subject unheard of in a sitcom -- or often, television in general -- bigotry, homosexuality, ""hippies"", etc.That was great then -- it helped sitcoms grow up. But now that they have and we are so used to these things on TV, the seams show -- most episodes baldly hang ""controversial"" topics on typical sitcom mechanics. Example: one show has the Jeffersons (more properly Louise and her brother in law) come to dinner. Archie and the brother in law exchange angry barbs as the audience howls. Now, in 1971 that was rich stuff. But today, it's ordinary, even pass&eacute; -- and the plot itself hinges on things like Edith having to fake a broken ankle too transparently to pass among intelligent people, and that is, really, I LOVE LUCY stuff. Of course Lucy was still doing this kind of thing on HERE'S LUCY while these shows were airing. But that just goes to show that this show is not as much one for the ages as we might remember.In another show, Gloria ""discovers"" women's lib -- but if she and Mike are so socially aware otherwise, how would she receive feminism as such a revelation in 1971? And then just for this episode, bleeding heart liberal Mike suddenly becomes a ""male chauvinist"" just to provide Gloria with a foil to fight against. This kind of blithe inconsistency in characterization does not a classic sitcom make, especially not in the seventies.And I must join some of the other reviewers in decrying the picture quality. ALL IN THE FAMILY need not look like THE MATRIX, but these prints are unusually muddy for a DVD -- they don't look any better than a home videotaping from NICK AT NITE. Videotape from this era can look sharper than this, and we are being a bit gypped by this schlock production standard. And NO extras? Bloopers? And where's that pilot?All in all, then, this show is more history than entertainment. It's hardly unpleasant, and I suspect later episodes are a little slicker and solider than these. But in terms of plunking down cash for these, I would walk rather than run.",3,"When the dust has cleared, this is a period piece",1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,3736,"['30-something', 'TV', 'fan', 'am', 'as', 'titillated', 'anyone', 'prospect', 'having', 'whole', 'season', 'show', 'home', 'getting', 'look', 'shows', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'kid', 'watching', '13', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'show', 'really', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'SANFORD', 'AND', 'SON', 'MARY', 'TYLER', 'MOORE', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'shows', 'classic', 'rather', 'show', 'pioneering', 'time', 'now', 'period', 'piece.For', 'one', 'show', 'descent', 'old-style', 'sitcoms', 'more', 'clearly', 'many', 'time', 'Gloria', 'one', 'gradually', 'not', 'work', 'just', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'say', 'HAZEL', 'had', 'only', 'aired', 'few', 'years', 'directors', 'shuffle', 'characters', 'set', 'dialogue', 'motivation', 'just', 'flow', 'i.e', 'people', 'getting', 'up', 'dinner', 'crossing', 'living', 'room', 'emphasize', 'point', 'old', 'sitcoms', 'often', 'did', 'directors', 'came', 'theatre', 'world', 'remember', 'show', 'relevance', 'freshness', 'yet', 'couple', 'episodes', 'wacky', 'neighbor', 'walks', 'spouts', 'irrelevant', 'shtick', 'lines', 'were', 'JACK', 'BENNY', ""O'Connor"", 'Stapleton', 'fresh', 'stage', 'careers', 'play', 'rafters', ""O'Connor"", 'even', 'getting', 'sweaty', 'arms', 'giving', 'many', 'episodes', 'air', 'THE', 'HONEYMOONERS', 'Which', 'was', 'only', '15', 'years', 'past', 'time.Which', 'say', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'product', 'era', 'often', 'remember', 'especially', 'early', 'episodes', 'when', 'other', 'shows', 'time', 'were', 'less', 'so', 'remember', 'electric', 'effect', 'show', 'had', 'when', 'premiered', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'much', 'episode', 'subject', 'unheard', 'sitcom', 'often', 'television', 'general', 'bigotry', 'homosexuality', 'hippies', 'was', 'great', 'then', 'helped', 'sitcoms', 'grow', 'up', 'now', 'have', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'things', 'TV', 'seams', 'show', 'most', 'episodes', 'baldly', 'hang', 'controversial', 'topics', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'mechanics', 'Example', 'one', 'show', 'Jeffersons', 'more', 'properly', 'Louise', 'brother', 'law', 'come', 'dinner', 'Archie', 'brother', 'law', 'exchange', 'angry', 'barbs', 'audience', 'howls', 'Now', '1971', 'was', 'rich', 'stuff', 'today', 'ordinary', 'even', 'pass', 'eacute', 'plot', 'things', 'Edith', 'having', 'fake', 'broken', 'ankle', 'too', 'transparently', 'pass', 'intelligent', 'people', 'really', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'stuff', 'course', 'Lucy', 'was', 'still', 'doing', 'kind', 'thing', 'HERE', 'LUCY', 'shows', 'were', 'airing', 'just', 'show', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'ages', 'might', 'remember.In', 'show', 'Gloria', 'discovers', 'women', 'lib', 'Mike', 'are', 'so', 'socially', 'aware', 'otherwise', 'how', 'would', 'receive', 'feminism', 'such', 'revelation', '1971', 'then', 'just', 'episode', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'liberal', 'Mike', 'suddenly', 'male', 'chauvinist', 'just', 'provide', 'Gloria', 'foil', 'fight', 'kind', 'blithe', 'inconsistency', 'characterization', 'not', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'make', 'especially', 'not', 'seventies.And', 'must', 'join', 'other', 'reviewers', 'decrying', 'picture', 'quality', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'need', 'not', 'look', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'prints', 'are', 'unusually', 'muddy', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'better', 'home', 'videotaping', 'NICK', 'AT', 'NITE', 'Videotape', 'era', 'can', 'look', 'sharper', 'are', 'being', 'bit', 'gypped', 'schlock', 'production', 'standard', 'extras', 'Bloopers', 'where', 'pilot', 'then', 'show', 'more', 'history', 'entertainment', 'hardly', 'unpleasant', 'suspect', 'later', 'episodes', 'are', 'little', 'slicker', 'solider', 'terms', 'plunking', 'down', 'cash', 'would', 'walk', 'rather', 'run']",N/A

""Boob-tubing"" as my father like to call it, was seriously frowned apon. But every Saturday night, like clockwork, my whole family gathered around our little 19"", b&w set with rabbit ears to view the further comedic TV exploits, that took place in the 704 Hauser St. living room between Archie, Edith, ""Meathead"" and the ""Little Goil"". My family and the rest of the American television viewing audience had never seen anything like ""All in the Family"". It was a well written, hilarious, TV sitcom performed by a talented group of actors about the serious issues of the day, using some very 'frank' language. This wasn't about if Mr. Clampett would take his money out of Mr. Drysdale's bank. Nor was it about creating a radio out of coconuts to get off of a tropical island. Instead Archie and the rest of the Bunkers screamed and argued about the Vietnam War, politics, the economy, race relations, women's lib, homosexuality, religion, student protest Etc. We had never seen anything like this. And you know what? It was really good! Norman Lear's teleplays were well written, emotionally moving and very funny as they drove home the topical issues of the day.This was a historic first in the world of TV sitcoms! It also helped that the show had one of the best television acting ensembles (with exception to ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") of the 1970s. The characters created by actors Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Rob Reiner & Sally Struthers will forever go down in television history. Now finally, the Emmy award winning show is being put out season by season to the DVD format. In this first season we get to see the early creation of the characters. Archie isn't as mellow as his later incarnations (he uses some pretty course, racist language). Edith isn't as sweet and 'dingbat-like' in her persona. We get great episodes like the premiere (""Meet the Bunkers"") as well as comic classics like the episode where the Jeffersons move next door (""Lionel Moves into the Neighborhood""). My personal favorite is ""Gloria's Pregnancy"". In that episode we get to see a more tender side of Archie Bunker after Gloria suffers a miscarriage.As for the DVD itself, the picture quality is only fair. No extras are provided, which is a shame since I think fans would love to have some commentaries from Producer, Norman Lear and the cast. Even so, I would highly recommend this excellent, historic, TV comedy be made a part of any DVD collection!",5,"""Gee, Our Old LaSalle Ran Great...""",1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,2685,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', '1970s', 'parents', 'were', 'forever', 'trying', 'get', 'read', ""'good"", 'book', 'go', 'outside', 'get', 'fresh', 'air', 'excercise', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stop', 'lapping', 'up', 'endless', 'episodes', 'Mannix', 'Room', '222', 'Boob-tubing', 'father', 'call', 'was', 'seriously', 'frowned', 'apon', 'Saturday', 'night', 'clockwork', 'whole', 'family', 'gathered', 'little', '19', 'b', 'w', 'set', 'rabbit', 'ears', 'view', 'further', 'comedic', 'TV', 'exploits', 'took', 'place', '704', 'Hauser', 'St.', 'living', 'room', 'Archie', 'Edith', 'Meathead', 'Little', 'Goil', 'family', 'rest', 'American', 'television', 'viewing', 'audience', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'Family', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'hilarious', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'performed', 'talented', 'group', 'actors', 'serious', 'issues', 'day', 'using', 'very', ""'frank"", 'language', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'Mr.', 'Clampett', 'would', 'take', 'money', 'Mr.', 'Drysdale', 'bank', 'was', 'creating', 'radio', 'coconuts', 'get', 'tropical', 'island', 'Instead', 'Archie', 'rest', 'Bunkers', 'screamed', 'argued', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'politics', 'economy', 'race', 'relations', 'women', 'lib', 'homosexuality', 'religion', 'student', 'protest', 'Etc', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'teleplays', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'very', 'funny', 'drove', 'home', 'topical', 'issues', 'day.This', 'was', 'historic', 'first', 'world', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'also', 'helped', 'show', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'acting', 'ensembles', 'exception', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', '1970s', 'characters', 'created', 'actors', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'will', 'forever', 'go', 'down', 'television', 'history', 'Now', 'finally', 'Emmy', 'award', 'winning', 'show', 'being', 'put', 'out', 'season', 'season', 'DVD', 'format', 'first', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'early', 'creation', 'characters', 'Archie', ""n't"", 'as', 'mellow', 'later', 'incarnations', 'pretty', 'course', 'racist', 'language', 'Edith', ""n't"", 'sweet', ""'dingbat-like"", 'persona', 'get', 'great', 'episodes', 'premiere', 'Meet', 'Bunkers', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'classics', 'episode', 'where', 'Jeffersons', 'move', 'next', 'door', 'Lionel', 'Neighborhood', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Gloria', 'Pregnancy', 'episode', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'tender', 'side', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'Gloria', 'miscarriage.As', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'only', 'fair', 'extras', 'are', 'provided', 'shame', 'think', 'fans', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'commentaries', 'Producer', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'cast', 'Even', 'so', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'historic', 'TV', 'comedy', 'be', 'made', 'part', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

And, prior to ""All in the Family"" when these things wereaddressed, it was with such kit gloves that it rendered it almost meaningless.And in creating a main character who was a paradoxically lovable if terribly foolish and arrogant bigot, creator Norman Lear crossed intodicey, politically incorrect territory that was shocking at the time.The show was also helped by that fact that both Caroll O'Connor as the bigoted working class Archie and Jean Stapleton as his ever optimistic,good hearted, sadly subservient and not very bright wife managed to turn these potential cartoons into very human characters, simultaneouslyabsurd, but still real enough that they reminded you of those relatives you inevitably cringed through Thanksgiving with, and somehow loved despitetheir awful flaws. (ala my own grandfather's seemingly endless ""that colored boy can sure play ball"" refrain).On the other hand, the series has dated as time has moved on. In the days before serialized series, the 'lessons', often about complexsocial issues, still had to be summed up in a brief 24 minutes of story time. Also, the supporting and guest actors didn't always rise to thelevel of O'Connor and Stapleton, so that they did indeed become cartoony. And elements do get repetitive quickly, especially in this eraof 'binge watching' multiple episodes in a single sitting. For example, the pretty generic and predictable political arguments between right-wing Archie and his left-wing son in law (Rob Reiner) do get old by the 3rd or 4th one in a sitting.To those who grew up more recently, it may be hard to grasp why this show was such a huge deal. And for those of us who grew up watching it,time has slightly dulled it's punch. But there's no question that this one show changed TV and American popular culture forever, and deservesit's reputation based on that.I agree with those deeply disappointed in the DVD presentation.  I understand that the original tapes may have faded, but other shows fromthe era look better.  Far more frustrating are the lack of extras; commentary, the original pilot, etc.  The sort of things that a landmark showsuch as this would richly deserve.",4,Changed U.S. television and culture,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2488,"['easy', 'impressive', 'see', 'why', 'sit-com', 'was', 'so', 'revolutionary', 'time', 'Prior', 'Family', 'issues', 'racism', 'feminism', 'homosexuality', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'were', 'rarely', 'touched', 'network', 'dramas', 'much', 'less', 'comedy', 'TV', 'was', 'place', 'where', 'thereal', 'issues', 'problems', 'effected', 'real', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'exist', 'prior', 'Family', 'when', 'things', 'wereaddressed', 'was', 'such', 'kit', 'gloves', 'rendered', 'almost', 'meaningless.And', 'creating', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'paradoxically', 'lovable', 'terribly', 'foolish', 'arrogant', 'bigot', 'creator', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'crossed', 'intodicey', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'territory', 'was', 'shocking', 'time.The', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'helped', 'fact', 'Caroll', ""O'Connor"", 'bigoted', 'working', 'class', 'Archie', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'ever', 'optimistic', 'good', 'hearted', 'sadly', 'subservient', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'wife', 'managed', 'turn', 'potential', 'cartoons', 'very', 'human', 'characters', 'simultaneouslyabsurd', 'still', 'real', 'enough', 'reminded', 'relatives', 'inevitably', 'cringed', 'Thanksgiving', 'somehow', 'loved', 'despitetheir', 'awful', 'flaws', 'ala', 'own', 'grandfather', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'colored', 'boy', 'can', 'sure', 'play', 'ball', 'refrain', '.On', 'other', 'hand', 'series', 'dated', 'time', 'moved', 'days', 'serialized', 'series', ""'lessons"", 'often', 'complexsocial', 'issues', 'still', 'had', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'brief', '24', 'minutes', 'story', 'time', 'Also', 'supporting', 'guest', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'rise', 'thelevel', ""O'Connor"", 'Stapleton', 'did', 'indeed', 'become', 'cartoony', 'elements', 'do', 'get', 'repetitive', 'quickly', 'especially', 'eraof', ""'binge"", 'watching', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'single', 'sitting', 'example', 'pretty', 'generic', 'predictable', 'political', 'arguments', 'right-wing', 'Archie', 'left-wing', 'son', 'law', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'do', 'get', 'old', '3rd', '4th', 'one', 'sitting.To', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'more', 'recently', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'grasp', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'such', 'huge', 'deal', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'time', 'slightly', 'dulled', 'punch', 'question', 'one', 'show', 'changed', 'TV', 'American', 'popular', 'culture', 'forever', 'deservesit', 'reputation', 'based', 'that.I', 'agree', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'understand', 'original', 'tapes', 'may', 'have', 'faded', 'other', 'shows', 'fromthe', 'era', 'look', 'better', 'Far', 'more', 'frustrating', 'are', 'lack', 'extras', 'commentary', 'original', 'pilot', 'etc', 'sort', 'things', 'landmark', 'showsuch', 'would', 'richly', 'deserve']",N/A

Bernabo,"[60, 67]","When ""All in the Family"" premiered on CBS on January 12, 1971, ""TV Guide"" introduced it as ""A Lighthearted Look at Prejudice,"" warning viewers ""Situation comedy takes a giant step with this adult social satire.""  In retrospect, even that declaration is an incredible understatement.  Other than the ""Texaco Star Theater,"" which made Milton Berle ""Mr. Television"" and sold millions of television sets, there is not another show in the history of television as significant as ""All in the Family.""  Before its abbreviated first season there were ""idiot"" situation comedies like ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Hogan's Heroes,"" and ""My Mother the Car.""  After ""All in the Family"" came relevant shows like ""Maude,"" ""The Jeffersons,"" and ""M*A*S*H"" and nobody doubts that it was AITF that changed the rules of the game.Produced by Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin, ""All in the Family"" was based on the British series ""Till Death Do Us Part.""  The family in question were the Bunkers, which consisted of bigoted Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor), his kindly ""dingbat"" wife, Edith (Jean Stapleton), their naively idealistic daughter, Gloria (Sally Struthers), and her husband, Michael Stivic (Rob Reiner), an argumentative liberal ""meathead"" who sorely tries Archie's deeply conservative soul.  Archie Bunker was unlike anything ever seen on television: he held every negative racial or ethic stereotype in the book and used slurs never before heard on television.  But the series also dealt with serious issues.  ""All in the Family"" is the only television series in history to finish 1st in the Nielsen's five years running and all four stars won multiple Emmys in their respective acting categories.Included on this DVD are the thirteen episodes that made up the first season, when the show was a mid-season replacement: (1) ""Meet the Bunkers,"" written by Norman Lear, where a surprise anniversary party for the Bunkers is just another excuse for Archie and Mike to have a fight; (2) ""Writing the President"" finds Mike and then Archie writing President Nixon on the state of the Union; (3) ""Archie's Aching Back"" finds Archie hiring a Jewish lawyer to get a large settlement in a minor traffic accident; (4) ""Archie Gives Blood,"" although he is afraid his blood will get mixed with those of a different race; (5) ""Judging Books by Covers,"" thinks one of Mike's friends is gay, but it turns out that it is one of Archie's drinking buddies instead; (6) ""Gloria Is Pregnant,"" but suffers a tragic miscarriage in the first television show I remember making me cry; (7) ""Now That You Know the Way, Let's Be Strangers,"" has Mike inviting a hippy friend to spend the night; (8) ""Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood"" despite Archie's efforts to keep a black family from buying the house next door; (9) ""Edith Has Jury Duty"" in a sitcom version of ""12 Angry Men""; (10) ""Archie Is Worried About His Job"" and nobody can sleep that night; (11) ""Gloria Discovers Women's Lib"" and angrily leaves the house when Mike refuses to treat her as an equal partner; (12) ""Success Story"" finds Archie reevaluating his definition of success when he runs into an old Army buddy; (13) ""The First and Last Supper"" has the Jeffersons coming to dinner at the Bunkers, except husband George (who is not seen until season 3) refuses to enter the house of his white neighbor.""All in the Family"" is one of the greatest television series of all time and I do not know of two many television critics or historians who do not have it down as one of the five best situation comedies ever aired.  Too bad this DVD does not include the two failed pilots Lear put together for ABC, but the greater shame is that this is a bare boned edition with just the episodes.

688814,AL4MKKO24563R,B00005Y4RZ,Michael K. Beusch,"[17, 20]","NBC loves to hang the moniker ""greatest ____ ever"" on its TV shows as if saying so makes it so. First, The Cosby Show was the greatest sitcom ever, then Seinfeld, then Friends. Of course, according to NBC, ER is the greatest program in the history of television, so we all have to discuss comedy programs in and of themselves. If NBC spent nearly as much time creating good new shows as it does in shamelessly overhyping their old shows, they probably would still be ahead of CBS in the ratings.For my money, no sitcom will ever top the great All in the Family in any respect -- acting, writing and overall influence. To get an idea of what dire straits TV comedy was in before All in the Family, take a look at an episode of one of the other sitcoms that was on the air at the time: Family Affair, The Brady Bunch, the last, sad days of Bewitched, The Beverly Hillbillies. The country had grown up, but television sitcoms had stayed rooted in the same dated themes of the 1950's and 1960's: either sterilized white bread families or gimmicky hocus pocus that took the place of the quality writing of classics like I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners and The Dick Van Dyke Show. Subjects like Vietnam, flower children, drugs, poverty, racism, homosexuality and rape were taboos.Enter Archie, Edith, Mike and Gloria who dealt with all those issues and more head on in every episode. While Carol Brady scolded her children for saying the word ""stinker,"" Archie Bunker held a lengthy dissertation on the phrase ""god damn it."" While Samantha Stevens was still dealing with her wacky witch and morlock relatives, the Bunkers were coming face to face with a transsexual. While the perpetually backwards residents of The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction and Green Acres discussed barn dances and pig raising, the Bunkers talked about the bombing of Cambodia and Watergate.To be sure, Archie Bunker was a caricature -- a personification of all the old time, outdated prejudiced values that were so out of step in the early 70's. Creator Norman Lear's political perspective is cleary on the side of Mike and Gloria Stivic rather than Archie or Edith. However, Lear, who modeled the character of Archie on his father, wisely gave Archie Bunker a good soul. It's clear that deep down, Archie is a good person who can't deal with the changes in his life and the country without lashing out angrily at them.The supreme achievement of All in the Family is that it takes all that anger and controversy and makes them funny. In the episode where the Jeffersons move into the neighborhood, for example, Archie's bigoted opposition to letting a black family could have made the situation ugly and very, very unfunny. However, Archie's opposition and fear is lampooned, making the point that discriminating on the basis of race is ridiculous. It's certainly deeper and more meaningful than Soup Nazis or finding out which two members of the Friends ensemble will sleep with each other next.In addition, the cast is probably the best ever assembled for sitcom with the possible exceptions of The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Carroll O'Connor as Archie, Jean Stapleton as Edith, Rob Reiner as Mike Stivic and Sally Struthers as Gloria are absolute magic together and still manage to convey how much they love each other even while they argue about and disagree about everything. In addition, the supporting cast would later include so many great actors and actresses as so many great characters that All in the Family would spawn five spinoffs. A true measure of how much the characters come to mean to the audience is in the episode ""Gloria's Pregnancy."" When Gloria miscarries, Archie goes to comfort her.

It is a show truly worthy of a DVD release.This first season DVD set contains all 13 episodes of the first season. This includes the classic first episode, Gloria's miscarriage (which ends in a touching scene with Carroll O'Connor and Sally Struthers as father and daughter), and the hilarious attempt to invite the new neighbors, the Jeffersons (before their own series began) to dinner, in spite of Archie's objections.Throughout its nine seasons, All in the Family willingly (and effectively) tackled issues previously undiscussed in the context of a situation comedy. But it would have been all for naught were it not for the perfect portrayal of Archie Bunker by Carroll O'Connor, who plays off his loving, understanding wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), whose kindness and tolerance is a perfect contrast to Archie's ignorance and bigotry. Mike (Rob Reiner) and Gloria (Sally Struthers) provide hilarious liberal counterpoints to Archie's reactionary conservatism.I can't wait for season two, which provides such AITF gems as the death of Cousin Oscar, the two appearances of Cousin Maude (played by Bea Arthur in the role that got her a spinoff series, which would also be quite welcome on DVD), and, of course, a visit by some guy named Sammy Davis, Jr.You absolutely need to buy this DVD set, even though extras are nonexistent and picture quality is only average (the show was shot on videotape, and the first season production values were always a little shaky).

I have tons of funny memories of watching this show, and  growing up in the 1970's brings back memories of the way things used to be. It was funny to have Gloria do a trick that Archie can't do. Gloria had placed a chair under the closed door of the closet and was able to lift the chair up without bending her knees or body. Gloria had done this to prove to Mike her husband that women can do certian things that men can't do. It was hilarious to see. Now personally, I think that Archie Bunker is considered the origianl Grumpy Old Man, as he complains constantly and nothing in the world would make him happier than for him to have is beer or his Froot Loops. From all the episodes, my all time favorite and funniest moments is when Archie answers any question within an argument by giving it the ol Bronx Cheer or the Raspberry. Everytime he does that I crack up, as he has the biggest raspberry fight with Mr. Jefferson in the ""Last Supper."" Episode. But the only few vulnerabilities for Archie is when his wife Edith starts to sing a happy song for every joyous occasion, and Archie is about ready to explode and agony. And the interesting part is when sometimes Archie speaks, he has that Bronx accent when he pronouces certain words in a certain way. At times he's very impatient and wants things to go his own way without interupptions. It's the best and most funniest of all classic tv.

688822,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005Y4RZ,P Magnum,"[5, 7]","All In The Family debuted on CBS in January of 1971 and immediately ushered in a new era of television programming.  Sitcoms that centered around families normally portrayed them as happy, loving families where mom cooked breakfast every morning and dad made a good living in some office.  Problems were solved in a half-hour and everything was swell.  The Bunkers were the opposite of all that.  They constantly bickered with one another and rarely did they see eye to eye with one another.  Carroll O'Connor stars as Archie Bunker, a working stiff whose views on life, America and ethnic groups fall to the right of right.  He is at constant odds with his daughter Gloria, played by Sally Struthers, and her liberal husband Mike, played by Rob Reiner over politics, race relations and everything else.  Archie's wife Edith, played by Jean Stapleton, is the in the middle of the two groups, a bit to dizzy to take one side or the other.  The show took on countless subjects like feminism and homophobia that were taboo at the time as well as on a weekly basis examining the wide generation gap that was forming between the adults who were World War II veterans or of that era and their children who were anti Vietnam and the counterculture.  Every week, Archie's narrow minded views were challenged by Mike and Gloria as well as Lionel Jefferson (Mike Evans) a young black man, whose father owned a cleaners that Bunkers used.  The way Lionel plays along with Archie's comments on race are some of the funniest moments in the first season.  One of he best episodes is when Archie finds out that his neighbor has sold his house to a black family.  He tries to organize the neighbors to start a collect to buy the house so the black family cannot move in.  He gets Lionel to try to help him by talking trying to talk the black family into selling the house back to the neighbors.  Lionel plays along, but in the end reveals to a shocked Archie that it is his family that has purchased the house.  The show could also be poignant as in the episode in which Gloria gets pregnant.  Archie is at first upset over the news as Mike is an out of work college student and he fears that they will not be able to support the baby.  Eventually, Archie warms up to the idea and comes home with a stuffed animal in hand only to learn that Gloria had a miscarriage.  The final between Archie and Gloria is touching and a tear jerker.  The show of course set off a firestorm of protests and boycotts, but the show evolved in a rating juggernaut and the show was a success at the 1970-71 Emmy Awards winning Best Comedy Series, Best New Series and Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Ms. Stapleton.",5,Meet The Bunkers,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2686,"['Family', 'debuted', 'CBS', 'January', '1971', 'immediately', 'ushered', 'new', 'era', 'television', 'programming', 'Sitcoms', 'centered', 'families', 'normally', 'portrayed', 'happy', 'loving', 'families', 'where', 'mom', 'cooked', 'breakfast', 'morning', 'dad', 'made', 'good', 'living', 'office', 'Problems', 'were', 'solved', 'half-hour', 'everything', 'was', 'swell', 'Bunkers', 'were', 'opposite', 'constantly', 'bickered', 'one', 'rarely', 'did', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'one', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'working', 'stiff', 'views', 'life', 'America', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'fall', 'right', 'right', 'constant', 'odds', 'daughter', 'Gloria', 'played', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'liberal', 'husband', 'Mike', 'played', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'politics', 'race', 'relations', 'everything', 'else', 'Archie', 'wife', 'Edith', 'played', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'middle', 'two', 'groups', 'bit', 'dizzy', 'take', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'show', 'took', 'countless', 'subjects', 'feminism', 'homophobia', 'were', 'taboo', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'weekly', 'basis', 'examining', 'wide', 'generation', 'gap', 'was', 'forming', 'adults', 'who', 'were', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veterans', 'era', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'anti', 'Vietnam', 'counterculture', 'week', 'Archie', 'narrow', 'minded', 'views', 'were', 'challenged', 'Mike', 'Gloria', 'as', 'well', 'Lionel', 'Jefferson', 'Mike', 'Evans', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'father', 'owned', 'cleaners', 'Bunkers', 'used', 'way', 'Lionel', 'Archie', 'comments', 'race', 'are', 'funniest', 'moments', 'first', 'season', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'when', 'Archie', 'out', 'neighbor', 'sold', 'house', 'black', 'family', 'organize', 'neighbors', 'start', 'collect', 'buy', 'house', 'black', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'Lionel', 'try', 'help', 'talking', 'trying', 'talk', 'black', 'family', 'selling', 'house', 'back', 'neighbors', 'Lionel', 'along', 'end', 'shocked', 'Archie', 'family', 'purchased', 'house', 'show', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'poignant', 'episode', 'Gloria', 'pregnant', 'Archie', 'first', 'upset', 'news', 'Mike', 'work', 'college', 'student', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'support', 'baby', 'Eventually', 'Archie', 'idea', 'home', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'hand', 'only', 'learn', 'Gloria', 'had', 'miscarriage', 'final', 'Archie', 'Gloria', 'touching', 'tear', 'jerker', 'show', 'course', 'set', 'off', 'firestorm', 'protests', 'boycotts', 'show', 'evolved', 'rating', 'juggernaut', 'show', 'was', 'success', '1970-71', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'winning', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'Best', 'New', 'Series', 'Best', 'Lead', 'Actress', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'Ms.', 'Stapleton']",N/A

""All in the Family"" was probably one of the most un-politically correct programs on television at the time - which contributed to the programs incredible success.Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor) portrayed the uneducated, bigoted, blue-collar worker that did the very best he could for his family. Beneath the crude exterior, Archie had a heart. The casting for the show was brilliant, in addition to Carroll O'Connor there was Jean Stapleton (Edith), Sally Struthers (Gloria) and Rob Reiner (Mike Stivic). The interaction between these characters is priceless.This program brought back a lot of great memories.

Much of the mentioned issues were of course, tackled with much comic effect.All in the Family also introduced us to Ediths' Cousin Maude (played by Bea Arthur) would have her own spin off series, MAUDE, which lasted 7 seasons from 1972 - 1978.  Also, the Jeffersons, the Bunkers next door neighbour, who would later have their own spin off series as well, THE JEFFERSONS, which was the most successful spin off in television history, which lasted 11 seasons from 1975 - 1985.  ALso, some great characters, like Irene and Frank Lorenzo (played by Betty Garrett and the late Vincent Gardenia), Beverely La Salle (played by the late Divine who appeared in three later episodes) and much more.The Complete First Season has thirteen episodes in all ...""Meet the Bunkers"" has Edith and Archie celebrating their 22nd Anniversary but there is a heated discussion on whether Archie is predujiced.  Lionel comes to Archie's aid with much comic results.""Writing the President"" has both Micheal and Archie writing a letter to President Nixon with opposite views of what is wrong with America.""Oh, My Aching Back"" has Archie suffering those whiplash blues when he is rearended while moonlighting as he demands he be represented by a Jewish lawyer.""Judging Books By Its' Covers"" has Gloria and Mike inviting their friend Roger for a lunch who Archie thinks is gay but it is Archie's beer drinking buddy who is, as Roger is straight.""Archie Gives Blood"" has Archie and Mike at the blood bank donating blood as Archie demands to know where his blood is going but faints at his own bag of blood.""Gloria's Pregnancy"", has Gloria thinking she is pregnant.""Mike's Hippie Friends Come to Visit"" the Bunkers as Archie is steaming mad and is up in a mad uproar when the visitoors deicde to spend the night that has Archie sharing his views on unmarried couples.""Lionel Moves into the Neighbourhood"" has Archie steaming mad when he finds out that he will have a black family as neighbours.  The episode that introduced us to the Jeffersons.""Edith has Jury Duty"" has Edith on jury duty on a much controversial murder case that may have away from the house for a long time.  A classic episode, written by Susan Harris, who created the Golden Girls.""Archie is Worried About His Job"" has Archie worried that he may lose his job due to job cutbacks.  He tries to find out from the night guard if his job may be affected.""Gloria Discovers Womans' Lib"" has Gloria devouring books of Womens' Lib and demands that all people in the household are all equal and shall be treated as equals.""Success Story"" has an old army buddy of Archies' paying a visit to the household as the buddyshares his successful life story with the Bunkers.""The First and Last Supper"" has Archie fuming as Edith accepts an invitation of dinner with the Jeffersons at the Bunkers' house.All in the Family Complete First Season begins and ends quite well.

Ignorant, bigoted, Archie, clueless Edith, uppity Gloria, and the strident Mike were the greatest comedy ensemble ever. Each member appeared to balance out the others. This show had appeal because, it showed the dark and light side of the characters in the most poignantly human ways. The 4 episodes that I recall most are The Bunkers Anniversary, Glorias Pregnancy, The Petition, and Gloria Moves Out. In 3 of them Archie was his usual belligerant self, while in Glorias Pregnancy Archie showed a tender side that many viewers did not think he could have when he learns his daughter lost her baby. The look between father and daughter would touch anyone with a heart. This first season set the stage for a refreshing truthful look at the contemporary issues of society at that time. This classic show turned fear, controversy, and anger in on itself with wickedly funny scripts. Unlike, some of the recent revered shows like Seinfeld which was about nothing, and whose characters had little redeeming traits. AITF's characters had virtues as well as glaring faults.

Beginning to fade from the network landscape were rural sitcoms that featured country folk in unmemorable situations. Instead, starting with ""All in The Family"" TV comedy would deal with controversial issues told with a comedic side. As Jean Stapleton (Edith Bunker) once said, ""the best way to deal with tough issues is to use humor; then the difficult situation is brought to its knees"". Other sitcoms of the seventies like ""Mary Tyler Moore"", ""Good Times"", and ""Maude"" all dealt with the current issues of the day that made headlines, but ""All in The Family"" towered all other shows in that regard. In the first season alone the series dealt with bigotry toward African/Americans and homosexuality, all taboo topics in the early 1970's. CBS even offered a disclaimer before the original episode broadcasts just in case some viewers would find the shows offensive.""All in The Family"" made its network debut as a midseason replacement (finishing at #34 for the season) and CBS buried it in a terrible timeslot. It wasn't until the summer when repeats of the first season were shown that ""All in The Family"" became the TV phenomenon that it was. By the second year it was firmly established as the #1 rated series on American television, and it was an Emmy-award sitcom, winning in its first year for Best Comedy and Best Actress in a Comedy for Jean Stapleton.In this wonderful boxset all 13 season one episodes are included uncut and remastered. For keen viewers who love watching DVD's with an eye for extraordinary color and clarity, yes the episodes are clear and vibrant, but the colors are poor. This is in no way due to how the series was transferred to DVD, but the way the show was originally produced. Norman Lear, the series creator, had actually wanted CBS to air the sitcom in black and white, but thankfully the network refused. Instead, Norman decided to use as little color with ""All in The Family"", so the episodes look drab and dreary because Norman felt that since the show dealt with dark issues, the series should be broadcast using drab colors to reflect the series' mood.All of the seasons of ""All in The Family"" will be made available soon since 2010 when ""Shout!"" announced they would be releasing the remainder of the last three seasons.
