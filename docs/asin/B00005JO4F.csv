639335,A2HPUXRSATB9EC,B00005JO4F,"Ellen Wertheimer ""British novel reader""","[6, 33]","I was delighted when this series finally emerged on DVD.  I remember loving it when I watched it as a young person, and I was looking forward to reacquainting myself with the lovable characters and heartwarming picture of family life I recalled it as presenting.A major disappointment was in store for me.  Unlike Family (with Sada Thompson), which is as superb today (on DVD) as I had recalled it as being on TV, Eight is Enough proved to be, in a word, awful.  The acting is wooden and unrealistic, and the scripts are worse.  Everything and everyone are shallow beyond belief.  I suppose it is a good thing in a way that there is no real suffering, angst, or anger called for in any of the scripts, as none of the actors would be capable of portraying such emotions anyway.  But they do not even convey real happiness with any success, either.  In short, any convincing portrayal of any emotion at all is utterly lacking; but, as I said, none is called for by any of the trivial scripts in any event.The series does have one real advantage, and that is as a soporific.

This show transports me back to a simpler time when I was in high school and the world was not hooked on instant messaging, the internet and cell phones. Back in a time when people communicated with one another face to face.I have missed being able to see this GREAT show on TV. I think one of the reasons this show was so good was it was done by LORIMAR PRODUCTIONS, the same company that did - ""THE WALTONS"". ""THE WALTONS"" was another TV favorite of mine. They had great writers on this show that knew how to relate to their audience. Unlike all the garbage that is being produced today for television. This show dealt with modern topics of the day and how the Bradford family handled them..Thank you Dick Van Patten as Tom Bradford. You did a great job in that role! You were a GREAT dad!THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INVOLVED in the production! It was ""SUPER""! You ALL we're ""SUPER""!

But I did grow up watching the show when I was a kid in the 80's.  Gotta say Nicholas was my idol growing up. He seemed like the whole show to me. I loved everybody on it but he just had the best lines and had the best quips. Now watching the show again in 2012 he still has the best lines and comic quips. He was the star of the show then and is the star of the show now. I heard over the years that Adam Rich spent time in and out of jail and was addicted to drugs from a very young age. Sad if that really is true. I saw pretty much every episode when I was a kid. Saw it some again in the early 2000's when they showed it again on that religious family cable channel. That was a nice refresher. Saw the first episode that featured Mark Hamill and minor scream queen Kimberly Beck (Friday the 13th Part 4, Massacre At Central High and Nightmare At Noon along with the too-groovy-for-words Roller Boogie) on the internet back in 2007 when they had free tv shows from the past on a certain website. Interesting to see the mother on there because I was so used to Betty Buckley as the step mom when I was a kid. Think the original mom died of breast cancer while dating a 20 something John Travolta at the time. But having the dvd of the first season was a great experience. What also really stood out was the breathtaking picture quality with hardly any flaws. I think a reviewer said on here it looked the show was taped today and they are totally right. Funny to see Willie Aames so young. He went on to co-star along with Scott Baio in Charles In Charge and be a nuisance on Celebrity Fit Club. I remember Grant Goodeve being the coolest older brother ever and he still is. Love Dick Van Patten. ALWAYS! He still rocks even in his 80's. He's still a working actor guest starring in Hot In Cleveland occasionally. The sisters are all cutie pies. Just have to mention that Dick Van Patten's sister, Joyce Van Patten, outshines Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade and the other two famous comedians in the comedy Grown Ups. Funniest damn person in the movie while also being in her 70's. After evisiting Eight Is Enough the last few days I was having fun watching some future stars guest star on the show.

639347,AN7ENTRR9UKYE,B00005JO4F,"Michael E. Pajak ""monarchmike""","[12, 14]","I've been waiting for this set as long as everyone else, and couldn't wait for it to arrive so that I could finally trash my VHS tapes recorded from syndicated edited TV versions.Well, the GOOD news is that these 9 episodes are overall very clear and sharp, the best I've seen them for a 35 year old show from 1977. And they all contain the opening ""teaser"" scenes from just before the opening credits, and the closing ""tag"" scenes from just before the closing credits that typically are missing from the syndicated versions. Plus, there is a bonus special feature of the recent Eight Is Enough Cast Reunion that occurred on 3/1/2010 during the Great TV Families Reunited Week on The Today Show.But, there are some issues with this set for die-hard completists. So, for those of you who get bored with history lessons, or who believe that everything they read on Wikipedia and other internet websites is absolutely true, then you might as well stop reading now.Everyone knows that Diana Hyland played Joan Bradford, the original mom on the series, and that she died during production of the first season. She had filmed only 4 episodes (counting the Pilot) before she became ill. She subsequently voice recorded some telephone conversion scenes for a couple more episodes before she passed away.The original production order of episodes were:1. Pilot NTENSJMD (features Diana Hyland)2. Schussboomer (features Diana Hyland)3. Pieces of Eight (features Diana Hyland)4. Turnabout (features Diana Hyland)5. Quarantine (phone conversation with Diana Hyland)6. The Gipper Caper (phone conversation with Diana Hyland)7. V Is for Vivian8. Hit and Run9. Women, Ducks and the Domino TheoryNow when Eight Is Enough aired on Tuesdays on ABC during the Spring of 1977, they only aired 8 episodes (counting the Pilot). The order of these episodes and their airdates is INCORRECT on this DVD set and just about all internet website listings. Amazon's own instant video listings can't even get the WRONG dates correct.The correct order and airdates for Spring 1977 is as follows. And all 8 of these episodes had opening credits which included Diana Hyland, and all of them (except the Pilot) had the opening and closing credits with the 10 cast members posing in front of their house for a family photo.3/15/77 Pilot NTENSJMD3/22/77 Schussboomer3/29/77 The Gipper Caper4/05/77 Pieces of Eight4/12/77 Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory4/19/77 Turnabout4/26/77 Quarantine5/03/77 V Is for VivianWhen Eight Is Enough returned for the Summer of 1977, now on Wednesdays, ABC had Lorimar replace the opening and closing credits with the new soon-to-be 2nd Season opening and closing credits. This version featured the remaining 9 cast members forming a human pyramid by the side of the house. AND new scenes and dialogue were filmed and recorded to REPLACE the phone conversion scenes and voice recordings by Diana Hyland in the previous episodes for their reruns.8/10/77 Hit and Run8/17/77 Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory (repeat)8/24/77 The Gipper Caper (repeat)8/31/77 V Is for Vivian (repeat)9/07/77 pre-empted for David Copperfield's The Magic of ABC Fall Preview SpecialThis DVD set contains a mixture of the Spring 1977 original episodes and the Summer 1977 original and repeat episodes (with the replaced scenes and credits).And finally, 3 of the episodes on this DVD set: Quarantine, Hit and Run, and The Gipper Caper have the WRONG closing credits. They all have the closing credits from Women, Ducks and the Domino Theory. It makes it looks like Charlene Tilton was a recurring character as Tommy's crush Wendy Springer in 4 episodes.All in all, this really is a great DVD set. And it was a joy to re-watch all these episodes. So, if you can get past the incorrect episode order, the repeat episodes with the replaced scenes, and the 3 wrong closing credits, you'll have a blast getting reacquainted with the Bradford Clan.",4,"Yes, Eight Is Enough's 1st Season Has Finally Arrived, But.....",1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,3914,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'set', 'as', 'long', 'everyone', 'else', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'arrive', 'could', 'finally', 'trash', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'recorded', 'syndicated', 'edited', 'TV', 'versions.Well', 'GOOD', 'news', '9', 'episodes', 'are', 'overall', 'very', 'clear', 'sharp', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', '35', 'year', 'old', 'show', '1977', 'contain', 'opening', 'teaser', 'scenes', 'just', 'opening', 'credits', 'closing', 'tag', 'scenes', 'just', 'closing', 'credits', 'typically', 'are', 'missing', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'bonus', 'special', 'feature', 'recent', 'Eight', 'Is', 'Enough', 'Cast', 'Reunion', 'occurred', '3/1/2010', 'Great', 'TV', 'Families', 'Reunited', 'Week', 'Today', 'Show.But', 'are', 'issues', 'set', 'die-hard', 'completists', 'So', 'who', 'get', 'bored', 'history', 'lessons', 'who', 'believe', 'everything', 'read', 'Wikipedia', 'other', 'internet', 'websites', 'absolutely', 'true', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'stop', 'reading', 'now.Everyone', 'knows', 'Diana', 'Hyland', 'played', 'Joan', 'Bradford', 'original', 'mom', 'series', 'died', 'production', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'filmed', 'only', '4', 'episodes', 'counting', 'Pilot', 'became', 'ill.', 'subsequently', 'voice', 'recorded', 'telephone', 'conversion', 'scenes', 'couple', 'more', 'episodes', 'passed', 'away.The', 'original', 'production', 'order', 'episodes', 'were:1', 'Pilot', 'NTENSJMD', 'features', 'Diana', 'Hyland', '2', 'Schussboomer', 'features', 'Diana', 'Hyland', '3', 'Pieces', 'Eight', 'Diana', 'Hyland', '4', 'Turnabout', 'features', 'Diana', 'Hyland', '5', 'Quarantine', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Diana', 'Hyland', '6', 'Gipper', 'Caper', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Diana', 'Hyland', '7', 'V', 'Vivian8', 'Hit', 'Run9', 'Women', 'Ducks', 'Domino', 'TheoryNow', 'when', 'Eight', 'Enough', 'aired', 'Tuesdays', 'ABC', 'Spring', '1977', 'only', 'aired', '8', 'episodes', 'counting', 'Pilot', 'order', 'episodes', 'airdates', 'INCORRECT', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', 'internet', 'website', 'listings', 'Amazon', 'own', 'instant', 'video', 'listings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'WRONG', 'correct.The', 'correct', 'order', 'airdates', 'Spring', '1977', '8', 'episodes', 'had', 'opening', 'credits', 'included', 'Diana', 'Hyland', 'Pilot', 'had', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', '10', 'cast', 'members', 'posing', 'front', 'house', 'family', 'photo.3/15/77', 'Pilot', 'NTENSJMD3/22/77', 'Schussboomer3/29/77', 'Gipper', 'Caper4/05/77', 'Pieces', 'Eight4/12/77', 'Women', 'Ducks', 'Domino', 'Theory4/19/77', 'Turnabout4/26/77', 'Quarantine5/03/77', 'V', 'Is', 'VivianWhen', 'Eight', 'Is', 'Enough', 'returned', 'Summer', '1977', 'now', 'Wednesdays', 'ABC', 'had', 'Lorimar', 'replace', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'new', 'soon-to-be', '2nd', 'Season', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'version', 'featured', 'remaining', '9', 'cast', 'members', 'forming', 'human', 'pyramid', 'side', 'house', 'new', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'were', 'filmed', 'recorded', 'REPLACE', 'phone', 'conversion', 'scenes', 'voice', 'recordings', 'Diana', 'Hyland', 'previous', 'episodes', 'reruns.8/10/77', 'Hit', 'Run8/17/77', 'Women', 'Ducks', 'Domino', 'Theory', 'repeat', '8/24/77', 'Gipper', 'Caper', 'repeat', '8/31/77', 'V', 'Is', 'Vivian', 'repeat', '9/07/77', 'pre-empted', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'Magic', 'ABC', 'Fall', 'Preview', 'SpecialThis', 'DVD', 'set', 'mixture', 'Spring', '1977', 'original', 'episodes', 'Summer', '1977', 'original', 'repeat', 'episodes', 'replaced', 'scenes', 'credits', '.And', 'finally', '3', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'Quarantine', 'Hit', 'Run', 'Gipper', 'Caper', 'have', 'WRONG', 'closing', 'credits', 'have', 'closing', 'credits', 'Women', 'Ducks', 'Domino', 'Theory', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', 'was', 'recurring', 'character', 'Tommy', 'crush', 'Wendy', 'Springer', '4', 'episodes.All', 'really', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'joy', 're-watch', 'episodes', 'So', 'can', 'get', 'incorrect', 'episode', 'order', 'repeat', 'replaced', 'scenes', '3', 'wrong', 'closing', 'credits', ""'ll"", 'have', 'blast', 'getting', 'reacquainted', 'Bradford', 'Clan']",Eight Is Enough: Season 1

639352,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005JO4F,P Magnum,"[2, 6]","Eight Is Enough was a late 70's TV show that was based on the writings of newspaper columnist Tom Braden.  Starring as Tom Bradford, Dick Van Patten entered the TV hall of fame as one of the most memorable TV fathers of all time.  The first season is a supremely short nine episodes and featured the late Diana Hyland as Tom's wife Joan.  She only appears in the first four episodes as she became sick with breast cancer and eventually succumb to the disease shortly after the showed debuted.  She was written out of the rest of the season and season two shows that Tom had become a widower.  I wonder why the show's producers didn't replace her with another actress since she hadn't become entrenched in role.  Probably it was out of respect, but some of the better scenes in the first episodes is the interchange between Tom & Joan on raising the kids.  This was lost in the later seasons and could have been a strong part of the show. The first episode is interesting to watch as Mark Hamil played the role of eldest son David.  He seemed like a great casting choice as he bears a slight resemblance to both Mr. Van Patten & Ms. Hyland and he seems to fit in with rest of the family.  In retrospect, Grant Goodeve who replaced Mr. Hamil in the series seems like an odd choice because he doesn't look like he fits into the family with his dark looks.  The nine episodes show Tom trying to juggle his job, finances and raising his eight kids.  He wants to be liberal and ""modern"" as he is in his columns, but finds himself reacting a little differently when it comes to his own kids.",4,TV Classic,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,1584,"['Eight', 'Is', 'Enough', 'was', 'late', '70', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'writings', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'Tom', 'Braden', 'Starring', 'Tom', 'Bradford', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patten', 'entered', 'TV', 'hall', 'fame', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'TV', 'fathers', 'time', 'first', 'season', 'supremely', 'short', 'nine', 'episodes', 'featured', 'late', 'Diana', 'Hyland', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Joan', 'only', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'became', 'sick', 'breast', 'cancer', 'eventually', 'succumb', 'disease', 'shortly', 'showed', 'debuted', 'was', 'written', 'rest', 'season', 'season', 'two', 'shows', 'Tom', 'had', 'become', 'widower', 'wonder', 'why', 'show', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'replace', 'actress', 'had', ""n't"", 'become', 'entrenched', 'role', 'Probably', 'was', 'respect', 'better', 'scenes', 'first', 'episodes', 'interchange', 'Tom', 'Joan', 'raising', 'kids', 'was', 'lost', 'later', 'seasons', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'strong', 'part', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Mark', 'Hamil', 'played', 'role', 'eldest', 'son', 'David', 'seemed', 'great', 'casting', 'choice', 'slight', 'resemblance', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Ms.', 'Hyland', 'fit', 'rest', 'family', 'retrospect', 'Grant', 'Goodeve', 'who', 'replaced', 'Mr.', 'Hamil', 'series', 'odd', 'choice', ""n't"", 'look', 'family', 'dark', 'looks', 'nine', 'episodes', 'show', 'Tom', 'trying', 'juggle', 'job', 'finances', 'raising', 'eight', 'kids', 'be', 'liberal', 'modern', 'columns', 'reacting', 'little', 'differently', 'when', 'own', 'kids']",Eight Is Enough: Season 1

When I grew up I always wanted to live in a neighborhood like the Bradfords and have friends like Tommy with three or more hot, available, sisters...unfortunately, when I did grow up it was during the 80's and I lived in Texas. Needless to say, life was nothing like the television show and still to this day, I have yet to find a community or a group of people that are as cool as the ones portrayed in this show. The last of the 'Star Wars' saga is coming out this month in the theaters and back then the original 'Star Wars' movie had just come out and 'Eight Is Enough', a show which epitomizes the values of an era that has long come and gone has not been given a DVD release like 'The Brady Bunch' or 'The Partridge Family'. I liked 'The Brady Bunch' and 'TPF' but it always seemed fake to me like 'The Monkees' and I never really got into it like 'EIE'. If whomever is in charge of the rights to this show would put it out on DVD with a really cool 1970's-ish cover (NO DOUBLE SIDED DVD'S!!!) and some cool special features I'd buy it in a heartbeat, and be eternally grateful. It's a shame that in the time that we're living in we don't have more positive family role models on television, and instead have channel after channel of reality shows and military/cop dramas that aren't nearly as cool as 'Chips', 'Magnum P.I.', or 'Simon & Simon', in my opinion. Oh, also, release 'Simon & Simon' on DVD and I'll buy that as well.

639357,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B00005JO4F,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[8, 9]","On April 17th, 2012 one of the most beloved family series of all-time makes its debut finally on DVD. ""Eight Is Enough"" arrives for purchase in stores in a two-disc set featuring all season 1 episodes. The reason the set contains so few shows is because ""Eight Is Enough"" was a mid-season replacement on ABC in the spring of 1977 and ordered by the then head of the network Fred Silverman who wanted to go after the young audience. What better way to achive that feat than by featuring a one hour weekly drama revolving around eight kids at various ages.In season one the pilot, which debut on March 15th, 1977, was a bit different than other produced episodes. First of all the part of David was played by a pre-""Star Wars"" Mark Hamill, Nancy was played by Kimberley Beck and Thommy by an unknown actor named Chris English. Once the pilot was bought by ABC those roles subsequently went to the actors who played the roles until the cancellation of the series in 1981.Season one also featured the beautiful Diana Hyland as the matriarch of the Bradford clan, Joan. With  Dick Van Patten playing the father and running a newspaper, Joan was contented on being a housewife and raising 8 kids. However, Diana was only able to tape the first four shows before she fell ill (Diana died of cancer in the arms of her then boyfriend John Travolta). Hyland passed away just 12 days after the pilot aired forcing the producers to come up with the issue on how to deal with the character of Joan. That problem was solved when the series came back in the fall of 1977.The DVD boxset will feature, as a special bonus, an ""Eight Is Enough"" reunion special produced for this set.The following is the complete episode guide of all shows from season one along with their airdates:1. ""Never Try Eating Nectarines Since Juice May Dispence"", March 15, 1977 (PILOT)2. ""Schussboomer"", March 22, 19773. ""Pieces of Eight"", March 29, 19774.

Pristine audio and visual. The series has never looked this good. Crystal clarity, you can see the stitching on Tom's jacket and on the upholstery of his car. The vibrant colors shine throughout.As I watched the pilot again, I was amazed at the chemistry between Dick and Diana and realised it would only be enjoyed for a few episodes before her untimely passing....Of course as everyone knows David, Tommy and Nancy would be recast by the second episode. I enjoyed every one of the nine first season episodes, culminating in the The Gipper Caper. I found myself teary-eyed when Mary reads Tom's draft for his article....It still packs a punch 35 years later...Interestingly the end credits for Gipper are from episode 5) Women, Ducks And the Domino Theory....The reunion from 2010 was a treat - Dick, Betty, Grant, Laurie, Connie, Willie (in New York) and Dianne (from Los Angeles).A must-have for fans of quality entertainment that stands the test of time.
