It's 3 separate season dvd's shrink-wrapped together.  One of my dvds were off the spindle so it has scratches on it.  If I had known that this wasn't an actual &#34;Box Set&#34; I probably wouldn't have bought it.  The three separate dvds they picture aren't even the ones you receive so that's deceptive too.  I'm not as disappointed as I am annoyed.

Definitely a must-have for the fan of light-hearted murder-mysteries. No gory death scenes, mostly fun, and always entertaining storylines in each episode.The video quality on the discs are fine for the age of the original show. No complaints here. They don't look like they're re-mastered, but even playing on my HD television, the quality and clarity was quite good, especially considering that they're recorded in standard definition.This is a good purchase (or gift) for anyone who enjoys similar shows like: Matlock, Monk, Poirot, Columbo, Psych, and Murder She Wrote (Cabot Cove episodes), etc.",5,"Father Dowling and Sister ""Steve"" made it to DVD, hooray!",1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,676,"['Purchased', 'directly', 'Amazon.Finally', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'released', 'DVD', 'Definitely', 'must-have', 'fan', 'light-hearted', 'murder-mysteries', 'gory', 'death', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'fun', 'always', 'entertaining', 'storylines', 'episode.The', 'video', 'quality', 'discs', 'are', 'fine', 'age', 'original', 'show', 'No', 'complaints', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', ""'re"", 're-mastered', 'even', 'playing', 'HD', 'television', 'quality', 'clarity', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'considering', ""'re"", 'recorded', 'standard', 'definition.This', 'good', 'purchase', 'gift', 'anyone', 'who', 'similar', 'shows', 'Matlock', 'Monk', 'Poirot', 'Columbo', 'Psych', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'episodes', 'etc']",Father Dowling Mysteries: The Complete Series

I really like that a priest goes about solving crimes that the police arrest the wrong person for the crime and he finds the clues to solve the mystery.  He also has help from one of his sisters at the church who is streetwise and knowledgeable about many things.  I especially like the episode &#34;The Consulting Detective Mystery&#34; where Sherlock Holmes has to give him the confidence to go on solving crime when the wrong person gets arrested for a crime committed by someone else.
