What starts as a gritty, realistic and entertaining as hell cop show ends up being a true American work of art. Far richer and more complex and enthralling than ANY film that has come out this decade let alone any other t.v. show. This review stands for all five seasons of the show as the sum is greater than any single part. Although I do have to single out Season Four as simply remarkable.Watching the entirety of the series (five seasons in total) is just one of the most overwhelming and rewarding viewing experiences imaginable. 'The Wire' is one for the ages.HBO is currently planning on releasing the entire series in one grand package later this fall.  A worthy addition to any DVD library.",5,I know you're probably sick of hearing this...but 'The Wire' really IS the best show ever produced for American television!!,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,817,"['hyperbole', 'B.S', 'lie', 'HBO', ""'The"", 'Wire', 'just', 'anything', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'produced', 'television', 'What', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'cop', 'show', 'up', 'being', 'true', 'American', 'work', 'art', 'Far', 'richer', 'more', 'complex', 'enthralling', 'ANY', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'decade', 'let', 'alone', 'other', 't.v', 'show', 'review', 'five', 'seasons', 'show', 'sum', 'greater', 'single', 'part', 'do', 'have', 'single', 'out', 'Season', 'Four', 'simply', 'remarkable.Watching', 'entirety', 'series', 'five', 'seasons', 'total', 'just', 'one', 'most', 'overwhelming', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experiences', 'imaginable', 'Wire', 'one', 'ages.HBO', 'currently', 'planning', 'releasing', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'grand', 'package', 'later', 'fall', 'worthy', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library']",The Wire: Season 5
1134429,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B00123BY6S,Adam,"[70, 74]","I'll begin this review as a review of the series, then move on to Season 5 in particular:I have long thought that some of the best stuff on TV can be found among HBO's Original Series. I'm a big fan of some of HBO's better known dramas including Rome and The Sopranos, as well as of some lighter fare such as The Ali G Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Strangely, I'd barely even heard of The Wire until about a year ago, when a friend of mine (who generally has very good taste) was raving about it.  At his suggestion, I purchased Season One on DVD.  I was hooked about half way into the series, and I eagerly devoured Seasons 1-4 on DVD just in time to catch Season 5 as it aired on HBO.  I can't pay this series high enough praise - to me, it transcends the TV medium, and rather than compare it to other TV series, I'd rank it up there as one of the greatest stories ever told (or rather the greatest stories I've had the good fortune of reading, hearing, or viewing).  Many reviews rave about The Wire as an excellent TV Series, though in my opinion this excellent work would more appropriately be compared to an epic novel than to anything on the small screen.The Wire has rightfully been praised for, among other things, 1) it's realism and 2) it's excellent character development, but what really sets The Wire apart is its tackling of complex, timeless themes such as poverty, suffering, lawlessness, and the underlying forces (such as beuracracy, corruption, and greed) that lead to the ultimate failure of the system to correct these issues.  The Wire takes a close, and very critical view of how our political, educational, media, and law enforcement institutions fail to eliminate the poverty and drug problems that plague Baltimore.  As in most great epics, the lines between good and evil aren't clear as there are drug dealers we sympathize with and even respect, and police officers we despise (and vice versa).  There are cold-hearted killers who live by strict, even admirable ethical codes (Omar) and those on the other side of the law with such a disregard for any such ethical code (Mayor Carcetti) it makes the viewer sick, especially given the parallels with too many real world figures.As I touched on before, The Wire's realism is another attribute worth noting, as this series pulls off ""realism"" better than any fictional TV series I can recall.  Granted, I'm an upper middle class nerd who's lived a coddled life, so I may not be the best qualified reviewer to comment on the realism of a show about drug dealers in the West Baltimore projects, but to me it achieves realism in a way that many if not most television (as well as big screen) dramas fail. It isn't over dramatized.  It doesn't have that polished, studio feel of most TV but rather the gritty feeling of the streets of Baltimore. The cops look and generally act like cops (they don't look like models; they live in crummy apartments and work in filthy cubicles; some battle alcohol problems or deal with boring, tired relationships). The ""bad guys"", similarly, look and act like rational participants in ""the game"" would be expected to in real life.  This point ties in with the excellent character development - and in fact a few of the roles are played not by career actors but by real world products of the Baltimore drug game (The Deacon and Snoop stand out as notable examples).Ultimately, The Wire succeeds to such a degree as a Series because, as the creators put it in one of the bonus features that came with Season 4: The Wire isn't made by people with careers in the TV business.  As a result, it doesn't feel like television, but rather, like great storytelling.************************************************************************And Season 5 specifically:I won't say much about Season 5, as I don't think it's useful to spoil the plot.  I will say that Season 5 is every bit as good as the Seasons that lead up to.  McNulty's character makes some pretty bold choices early in the season, and it's unclear whether he's a desperate man on a downward spiral or the only man willing to do what needs to be done, potentially sacrificing himself in the process.The ""side plot"" in Season 5 focuses on the newspaper (The Baltimore Sun), much as Season 2 focused on the stevedores and Season 4 explored the school system.  Not surprisingly, the newspaper is as disfunctional as the schools or the political system - an under-staffed local rag that desperately tries to put together any ""story"" they can sell while missing the real story right in front of their eyes (that is, the story that we as viewers have been enjoying for the past 5 seasons).A handful of new characters are introduced, and a battle of ethics takes place at the newspaper much like that we've seen unfold at the PD for four seasons now, with the Baltimore Sun's version of Jim McNulty (Gus) sticking to his old school ideals of telling the truth while glory seeking newcomer Templeton makes up his own truth, with few visible consequences.  The hunt for Marlo continues and, the highlight of the story, the clash between Marlo and Omar Little (the best character in the series, in my opinion) really heats up.  As far as action and suspense are concerned, Season 5 doesn't disappoint.By ending the series with Season 5, the producers wrap up the story quite well.  In too many cases, otherwise good TV Series go on too long, driven by greed or perhaps the egos of the producers instead of by the story, and fade into mediocrity (the Sopranoes) or into convoluted, meandering storylines (Lost).  By having Season 5 wrap up the series, while the producers do leave us wanting for more, they ultimately leave us with the feeling of finishing up and closing a long, satisfying book.  No, not all the threads are tied up, some are left loose, and the Baltimore we leave behind at the end of Season 5 isn't much different than we found it in Season 1.  But we are left with the satiated feeling of finishing a complete story, well told and well concluded.",5,One of the best series on TV?

1134430,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B00123BY6S,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[6, 6]","This final season of this brilliant series fails to match the heights of the previous years. It's still riveting TV but for the first time I felt as if the plot was becoming a little unrealistic.I don't want to play the spoiler here so I won't reveal which aspect of the story I felt was far-fetched. But it was pretty central to the action.Having said that, we do get a penetrating and withering look at the newspaper industry that as a journalist I can attest is all too accurate.At the Baltimore Sun, the newsroom is decimated by buy-outs to the point that the paper can't cover the news. A young hotshot appears and starts fabricating quotes and then entire stories. His editors, eager to gain a Pulitzer, encourage him. The one veteran voice of reason in the newsroom, trying to maintain ethical standards, is ignored, overruled and finally demoted. It's sad but true.This series has been a superb examination of one of the most important challenges facing our country -- the sacrifice of an entire generation of young African American males to drugs. The writers looked at the city from every angle and found corruption wherever they looked. Even the police and politicians who try to do good end up corrupted and tarnished.

1134431,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B00123BY6S,A Reviewer,"[0, 0]","I was someone who was exposed to The Wire beginning with the 2nd season on DVD, and I loved it so much that I've spent the summer buying the rest of the seasons and watching them all the way through. Seasons 4 and 5 I thought were a big step up for an already incredible series and while people will always have their favorite seasons, the quality has never wavered. Season 5 is in my opinion as strong as any of them and it felt much faster-paced than some of the others; for the first time since Season 2 I found myself watching multiple episodes in a row just because I was so hooked.Some reviewers have commented that the main storyline felt a little too cartoonish and unrealistic, but I didn't think it was any more cartoonish than, say, ""Hamsterdam"" from Season 3, so I don't understand that criticism at all. I also don't see how that aspect could have stopped anyone from loving the ending, which wraps the series up so beautifully.If there's one complaint to be had it's that the fact that this season is only 10 episodes long (vs the 12-13 of the others) so if some ideas feel a *little* less fleshed out than those from other seasons, that's the reason. Still, that small weakness doesn't stop this season from being a classic like the rest of them.",5,Season 5 ends the show on a great note,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,1261,"['was', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'exposed', 'Wire', 'beginning', '2nd', 'season', 'DVD', 'loved', 'so', 'much', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'summer', 'buying', 'rest', 'seasons', 'watching', 'way', 'Seasons', '4', '5', 'thought', 'were', 'big', 'step', 'up', 'already', 'incredible', 'series', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'quality', 'never', 'wavered', 'Season', '5', 'opinion', 'as', 'strong', 'felt', 'much', 'faster-paced', 'others', 'first', 'time', 'Season', '2', 'found', 'watching', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'row', 'just', 'was', 'so', 'hooked.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'main', 'storyline', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'unrealistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'say', 'Hamsterdam', 'Season', '3', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'criticism', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'aspect', 'could', 'have', 'stopped', 'anyone', 'loving', 'ending', 'series', 'up', 'so', 'one', 'complaint', 'be', 'had', 'fact', 'season', 'only', '10', 'episodes', 'long', '12-13', 'others', 'so', 'ideas', 'feel', '*little*', 'less', 'fleshed', 'out', 'other', 'seasons', 'reason', 'Still', 'small', 'weakness', ""n't"", 'stop', 'season', 'being', 'classic', 'rest']",The Wire: Season 5

1134433,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00123BY6S,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 1]","The fifth and final season of The Wire is given the task of wrapping up all the loose ends from previous seasons and also to give space to a new storyline element, that of the media. With the police, criminals, politicians, working class and teachers already covered, moving into the newspapers is the logical next port of call, especially since many of the show's writers cut their teeth as journalists at one time or another.Thanks to the efforts of the ever-redoubtable defence attorney Maurice Levy, Marlo Stanfield and his crew have avoided jail time, despite being linked to 22 bodies discovered in vacant housing in Baltimore. New mayor Tommy Carcetti wants the murders solved, so the Major Crimes Unit has been reconstituted with most of the old team back in play: Kima, Freamon, McNulty and Sydnor. Meanwhile, Herc has been forced to leave the police and is now working for Levy as a private investigator, and Omar is enjoying a holiday life down in the Caribbean, having apparently left behind the game for good. Unfortunately, Carcetti has inherited a massive education budget deficit from his predecessor and is forced to divert substantial financial resources away from the police to the schools. The Major Crimes Unit is disbanded, and even the street cops find their vehicle maintenance funding being pulled. With the police off his back, Marlo's consolidation of control over the city's drug trade suddenly ramps up to a new and dangerous level and he vows to settle his score with Omar.With bodies dropping but no funds available to investigate them, McNulty comes up with a scheme to get attention and resources back to the police force but, needless to say, it backfires spectacularly. At the same time, the Baltimore Sun is facing cutbacks but an ambitious young reporter, Scott Templeton, finds unorthodox means of finding new stories that please the bosses but annoy his editor.The final season of The Wire has a lot of ground to cover, as the police force's attempts to take down Marlo hit a brick wall and a new case rapidly rises to prominence, whilst a whole new facet of the city is explored through the newspaper. Simultaneously, many subplots running from the previous season continue to be explored, such as the continuing trials of the former schoolchildren from Prez's class (although only Dukie and Michael have a lot of screen time this season, Namond and Randy being reduced to cameos) and Marlo's attempt to dispose of the last barrier between him and total control of the city's drug trade. As a result a lot of other storylines fall behind. Carver and Herc appear a lot less than before (although when they do appear, they have some important things to contribute to the show's ending), Prez only has a brief cameo and the school storyline is pretty much abandoned. Cutty also only has a brief appearance, although given that his rehabilitation arc through Seasons 3 and 4 is pretty much complete that is more understandable.The name of the game this year is resolution. McNulty and Freamon are out for Marlo's blood and plan to bring down his organisation and put him in jail at any cost, and the extraordinary (and increasingly illegal) lengths they go to achieve that are breathtaking. Having played the system for four seasons prior without much to show for it, the two police officers are at breaking point, which isn't surprising. We also see Carcetti, the wonder boy who wanted clean stats and a new dawn for his city, being driven down by the system into the same morass of murky compromises and grey morality that blighted his predecessor. The newspaper storyline is nicely handled, and encapsulates the idea of people trying to do the right thing and getting beaten back for it whilst those who ride and exploit the system can succeed. It's a very cynical view of the world, although one that seems to be depressingly backed up by reality.But inbetween the cracks there are rays of light. Michael has been put through the wringer in the show's last two seasons and done some very bad things, but towards the end he comes to the realisation that he is in the game but not a gang player, which leads to a very logical end point for him, whilst Bubbles' traumas over the years finally lead him down the path of redemption. It would have been easy for the writers to have had Bubbles rehabilitate at the end of Season 1, but making his journey much longer and more painful before the possibility of a happy ending presents itself results in a more satisfying resolution.The series ends by showing us the hard-won victories the forces of law and order have achieved, but elsewhere many of the villains are still at large with blood on their hands. Some of the 'good guys' are left broken, or homeless, or without their jobs, or as drug addicts. But some people get what's coming to them, and the series ends with a long, lingering shot of Baltimore, a crime-addled, bankrupt city where the people are just struggling to survive day by day. It was this city, which stands in for pretty much any city in America, that was the real star of the show. David Simon and his writers, directors and actors are to be commended by giving us the definitive portrait of the American city in the 21st Century, and that portrait is not a positive or a happy one. But it has a ring of truth and authenticity to it that no other cop or lawyer show has ever achieved.Season 5 of the The Wire (*****) is a fitting end-point to the series, and a fine capstone to one of the greatest TV shows of all time. Storylines and mysteries stretching back to Season 1 are resolved satisfyingly, but no easy answers are given and the ending is anything but neat.",5,An excellent finale to the series,1233619200,"02

1134435,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B00123BY6S,billy,"[14, 16]","After the dizzying heights of season 4, in my mind the greatest single television season ever created, was their anyway that the fifth season of The Wire couldn't disappoint at least a little bit?A lot about the final season seemed hurried.  Be it McNulty's descent back in to self destruction, the surprisingly surface level characterizations of the news reporters, the thoroughly half backed and unrealistic plot that all of the action hinged on, really took a lot of the punch out of The Wire.  Still, a lot was good about season five as well.  The street drama was very strong, with Marlo's growing ruthlessness, Cheese's characterization, Michael and Dukie's touching relationship, Omar's legendary status taking a very surprising hit, and one absolutely chilling scene that I won't spoil.  The political aspect was just as cynical as ever, with Carcetti going from idealistic reformer to political opportunist in the span of three seasons.  It's quite a fall from grace.The main problem was that David Simon didn't have enough time to tell his story.  There was way more plot than ten episodes could hold, and as a result some things got rushed.  3 more hours would have given Simon and company enough time to explore some of the themes and characters, particularly the newsroom stuff.  Everyone felt like such broad characters in the newsroom.  Gus, the idealistic city editor, Scott Templeton, swarmy and scarily ambitious young reporter who does whatever it takes to get ahead, and Alma, the nave young reporter who's struggling to maintain her integrity in this environment.  And I can't forget about the editor James Whiting, who wants everything to be Dickensian, a nod to what critics frequently call The Wire.  I never really felt that the term fit, because The Wire's social critiques actually had bite, where Dickens' work never felt like it was all that harsh or critical.  This season though, it felt like typical ineffective and toothless Dickens.Another problem was McNulty.  I actually hoped he wouldn't come back.  I felt that The Wire had moved past McNulty, to a more emotionally resonant place.  They achieved something miraculous last season, and part of it was phasing out the main character, a high functioning alcoholic who can't help but self destruct and break the rules.  I was done with McNulty, and to see him back and worse than ever just felt like a rehash.  The Wire never really looks back, it always looks forward, but this felt like McNulty from season 2.  Plus his fall again seemed very quick, although we're suppose to keep in mind that the season is taking place a year after season 4.  Though we don't see McNulty getting worse over time, it just seems to happen.I won't even get in to the whole main plotline that grabs every aspect of the story.  All I will say is that my jaw dropped when I saw it first, and then it just kept getting more and more ridiculous, building in to some huge edifice that never seemed real.  You could argue that The Wire isn't suppose to be realistic, but this is the first time I've felt they've gone to the level of parody to make their critiques about Baltimore institutions.  Plus the Clay Davis plotline went by way to quick and ended in a rather goofy way.Still, the street aspect was uniformly good throughout.  Marlo is a genuinely scary character.  He's so much more ruthless and efficient than Avon and Stringer.  He's never caught up in the trappings of wealth; it's all about the crown for him.  Michael came in to his own this year, as a character struggling against the pull of the violent drug life while still maintaining some of his humanity.  Dukie's story was very touching as well.  The Omar plot felt a bit odd to me, but it also felt realistic. Cheese, played well by Method Man, came in to his own this season.  He makes you hate him by the end of the season.  Chris and Snoop continue to scare me as well.  There is no one as cold blooded as these two on television.  And I can't forget about Kenard, who has one of the most memorable moments of the season.The politics were pretty strong as well.  Carcetti is just painful to watch.  He's gone from the idealistic reformer to the political opportunist in about three seasons.  Simon doesn't have a lot of nice things to say about politics, and this is a pretty bleak view.  Narese Campbell comes in to her own here as well.  Perhaps the biggest surprise is Michael Steintorf, played by Neil Huff.  He turned in to a political hit man here, and I almost started to sweat every time he's on screen.  Watch his conversation with Bill Rawls in the last episode to see what I mean.And I can't forget about Bubbles, who put in a genuinely touching performance this season.  I wish he had more to do, but what we got was amazing.Despite the problems with this season, it is still very good, and it was still better than most of what was on television, and I still tuned in to watch religiously every Sunday.  For a first time viewer, there is a ton of continuity and it would be best to watch the first four seasons before purchasing season 5.  All the pieces matter, so it's important to absorb every episode.  If you're a fan already, you're probably going to pick this up anyway.  There is more good than bad here, but it's more of a victory lap than a tour de force like the rest of the series is.  The show lives on in my mind.  The names change, but the game remains the same.",4,"A Come Down from Season 4, but it Was Still Fantastic.  4.5 Stars",1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,5426,"['dizzying', 'heights', 'season', '4',

This link leads to a collection of the first four seasons of this remarkable ""docu-drama"", although I have yet to view an episode that would not stand alone as a prime time TV movie and some are more than worthy of theatrical release.Those of you who have caught a few episodes already know that you can tune into these without attention to order in rotation as each segment is well written, well acted and well produced.And now a word of caution for those of you who may have consider viewing these for the first time. The stories played in ""The Wire"" are based of actual events of the very recent past and are continuing to unfold in a town near you. These are very edgy, very raw, very vivid and violent stories, but they are very real. Tonight these stories will repeat in Oakland, in East Saint Louis, in Los Angeles, in Cleveland, in Philadelphia, in Newark, in Boston, in Houston, in New Orleans ... and in Baltimore, on a corner of those streets in the ""bad part of town"" where most of us seldom venture, even in daylight.The origins of this ""show"" are based in ""Homicide The Complete Series Seasons 1-7 DVD SET"" an acclaimed series from the '90s, "" ... not only the greatest cop drama of the 90's, it's one of the best ever. ..."" (Amazon review). Interestingly or possible fore ordained, several of the players and company from ""Homicide ..."" show up in the writing and character acting in ""The Wire"".When your kids approach the age of serious questions, you could do a whole lot worse than show them these.

1134452,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00123BY6S,James Hiller,"[4, 4]","Maybe it's only at the end of something that we begin to truly appreciate what we had all along. For five seasons, we lived and breathed with the citizens of Baltimore; the drug life that thrives on the streets, and the police that strive to stop it. The characters, written so complete and so believable, are alive to us, and dare I say, could be our friends and companions, albeit fictional? We've lived on the streets, and seen many crimes and killings, and experienced pain and sometimes joy. The Wire has been a total experience, one of the best television shows ever on the tube, and it's hard to say goodbye.In ten episodes, the Wire wraps up. Much has been opined about the quality of the final shows, how some people felt let down, and incomplete. I found the final ten to be very complete, very true to the intent of the series, and very emotional. The series truly adjusts its focus back to McNulty, an excellent cop who will go to any length to solve his problems, ethics be damned. In order to fully fund the police department, he decides to rig a series of deaths to make it seem like a serial killer. Soon, the ""spree"" catches fire, and McNulty is in it up to his eyeballs. My contempt for McNulty overall grew with his character development this season; which is probably most true to his character, but it didn't make me like him.  Additional storylines cover the endless chain of drug people that simply take up where others leave off, and Marlo's gang is no exception. In seemingly trying not to repeat the fall of Barksdale and Bell, Marlo's story wraps in an interesting way, with some just desserts being handed out.One story that had me absolutely entranced was Bubble's journey. From addict to recovery poster boy, Bubs upswing from his season four heartbreaking suicide attempt was a true American hero story, and it becomes aptly covered in the Baltimore Sun, which provides the ""focus"" for the season, albeit a slightly unfocused one.  However, as Bubs story progressed, it was his that compelled me the most, and I was drawn into it with a quet dignity. I guess you feel overtly protective of him through the series, and maybe waiting for him to fall off the wagon once again. Bubs finds his dignity this season, and it's beautiful.However, in a sad note, two of the four boys who stole last season, return to heartbreaking results. Almost as if to replace Bubs as an addict, Duquan, or Dukie, finally eeks out of Michael's life to start living on the streets, and becomes the new addict. Plot wise I recognized why that happened, but it totally broke my heart. Who wasn't rooting for Dukie, a child who's life was being evicted from apartment after apartment, who excelled in school, and made a connection with Mr. Prez? And then it begs to wonder, how many Dukies are there on our city streets, and how many of them do we as a society step over and ignore?The Wire was always a complicated show, and it never took it's assignment lightly, a slice of American life that has never been captured in such a complete and honest way. Will people look back fifty years from now, from an idyllic society, and wonder how anyone ever lived through such times and not tried to stop it? Only time will tell.

What you watch when you turn this show on is, more or less, reality.  With the exception of a few Rod Serling made-for-TV movies in the 1950's, I'd say Simon is the greatest realist to ever grace the boob tube, even with the mandatory HBO precedent for overwrought political correctness.The show ends as it has to end.  The culmination of events are as logical and brutal as a chess game played by Donald Trump and Bobby Fisher.  Detective Jimmy McNulty and company have reached such a point of futility in ""the war on drugs"" that McNulty finally embraces his true destiny with nutcase gusto: the role of Don Quixote, full of schemes and plans that are borne of the truest intentions but which are bound to fail because they are not based in a reality that is essentially corrupt.Along with his partner Lester and a few guys in the Baltimore Divison, he decides to risk it all in a righteous power play against Marlo Stanfield.  He is the capitalist answer to Avon Barksdale's family weaknesses, Stringer Bell's self divided incompetence, and Bodie's old school ethics.  This monster whom one could interpret as an incarnate devil if one wanted to forget that sociopaths like this are all too common in the ghetto--they even made a movie about one with Denzel WashingtonAmerican Gangster (2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition)and prettied him up.  Using an illegal wiretap obtained by the none too bright and non-police any more adjutant Herc, both cops decide to go above and beyond the call of the constitution to put Marlo and Co. behind bars.  ""Marlo doesn't get to win,"" a crazed McNulty tells Bunk.  ""We get to win.""  Is Simon saying that McNulty is corrupt as Marlo, only wanting to one up the other in this human chess game?

A big part of the attraction of the Wire was that the ""good guys"" were not destined to win as they are in most shows, and we have hard time defining who the good guys really are. Just like in real life, sometimes good people do bad things and bad people do good things. The Wire's universe is a closed system, in which very little of the outside world penetrates, and the forces within grow in intensity, forcing the characters to discharge energy from one imploding system to another. The characters are like wild animals of the savannah competing for limited resources without the limitations of human moral codes. For many fans of The Wire, it is almost a badge of honor that it has been ignored by the Emmys, sparing it from competing by satisfying the need for happy endings with drivel that satisfies but does not nourish. Season 5 does not disappoint; the threads of the past four seasons come together in a  storm plays no favorites; just as in real life, the fact that one is good or evil matters not in the final accounting.

Okay.'The Wire' is one of those shows that critics love to proclaim as the greatest TV drama of all time and that your friend will mock you for not having seen it by now. I went into 'The Wire' with the highest of expectations as I began to watch it a few weeks ago. I essentially feel that seasons 1-3 lived up to all the praise that this show has and continues to receive. Season 4 was very good but in my opinion a step below the borderline perfect first 3 seasons. But season 5? The final season?Before watching the very first episode of 'The Wire', I came to Amazon's site and took a quick look at the reviews of each of the five seasons. I was just curious to see how many people had taken the time to review the show and what the breakdown was between 1-5 stars. Not surprisingly the majority of reviews fell in the 4-5 star range for all 5 seasons.But something struck me during this quick exercise. I noticed a 'most helpful' critical review of season 5 on this site which proclaimed this specific season as 'Where The Wire Stopped Being Real'. I did not read this review beyond the title but noticed that the reviewer gave the season 2 stars and that 13 of 20 Amazon members agreed with this statement.I kept this moment in mind as I began season 5 but did not fixate on it. Sadly, it turned out that that Amazon reviewer was onto something.One of the many great elements of 'The Wire' is how realistic it all feels. There are few, if any, liberties taken with respect to plot. Everything in the previous 4 seasons felt entirely plausible to me. So to see McNulty start things off with his serial killer scheme, I began to see this show fall apart.Curious to see what 'professionals' thought, I took the time to read some reviews by quasi famous 'critics' to see if they agreed with my feeling that this was an absurd story line. Surprisingly I found many critics justified this plot turn because McNulty had hit rock bottom. Personally, I'm not buying it. And the fact that this season is almost entirely based on this plot line in some regard is wildly troubling.I also got tired of Marlo Stanfield during season 5. He was never as interesting or complex as Stringer or Avon. Greggs seemed to play a smaller part in season 5 a la McNulty in season 4, which I didn't like. Omar deserved a better death than a random kid. Bunk spent most of the final season mad at Jimmy. In its totality, it just didn't really work for me.With all that said, this is still 'The Wire', so you are going to get great acting and for the most part engaging story lines. I just think this main story was a huge let down. (I should mention that I did enjoy the newspaper storyline, but felt that it could have and should have received a variety of plot lines a la the seaport in season 2.)Overall, 'The Wire' is without question one of the best TV drama's ever made. Well......kinda. I'd give that distinction to seasons 1-3. Season 4 was still excellent but not quite as brilliant as the first 3 seasons. But season 5, in my humble opinion, was such a let down that I can't refrain from letting that somewhat stain my overall assessment of this TV series.

1134475,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00123BY6S,Michael Crane,"[1, 1]","""The Wire"" is hands-down the best show I have ever seen.  Period.  Now, I know that I said the same thing about ""Carnivale"" (which still remains a top favorite of mine), but I could have never expected a show like this.  A series so captivating and intriguing.  Not one bad episode, not one weak season.  All of the characters, good or bad, you cared about or were interested enough to take the journey with them.  The fact that this show never won an Emmy and was only nominated once for a writing credit, is an absolute travesty and I've never forgiven the Emmys ever since.  But enough gushing.  ""The Wire:  Season 5"" is a bittersweet and appropriate goodbye to one of the best shows out there, and there was no slacking or cutting-corners.The city of Baltimore is in even worse conditions than before under a new Mayor who is forced to make budget cuts in the worst places, such as the Baltimore police department.  This causes cases to go ""hush"" and unrest with the department who has yet to see a single penny for their over-time.  Marlo and his crew are still dealing, and use the weakness of the police department to their advantage to start killing again after having to play it safe.  That's not the only thing on Marlo's mind, however.  He's also thinking revenge, and his crew will do a horrible act that will force anti-hero and robber of drug-dealers Omar out of retirement.  Budget cuts have also effected the Baltimore Sun, a newspaper that is also forced to do ""more with less,"" and a writer who doesn't mind creating his own stories, people and quotes will write himself into a story about a serial killer who is targeting the homeless.  Jimmy McNulty, after being pulled from the Marlo Stanfield case is back to being a Detective, and while you may remember him cleaning up his act somewhat in the previous season, he has gone back to his hardcore-drinking and fooling-around-with-other-women ways.  But this is McNulty at his most self-destructive, for when he has become fed up with the politics and higher-ups ignoring low-profile murders, McNulty decides to do something so desperate that could not only end up costing him his badge but could also send him to prison if he gets caught.  These are only a few of the stories that lay ahead in this powerful season.What can I say about the show and this season that hasn't been said already?  It's always hard to be satisfied with a final season when you know that this is it.  I'm sure some were disappointed by it because of that, but I loved it.  And it only gets better each time I watch it.  The writing, directing, acting... phenomenal.  Never has there been a show, in my opinion, where you run into so many characters and none of them are flat.  They all have a drive and reason, and you care about every single story and angle.  While this is referred to as a ""cop show,"" I don't call it that.  The reason for that is the show focuses on EVERYONE.  You see perspectives from the cops, but you also see it from the crooks and dealers.I can't even begin to name off all of the actors who do an outstanding job, because THEY ALL DO.  Now how rare is that?  I love how each season focuses on something different, and the newspaper angle was a great idea.  It shows you that politics are being played EVERYWHERE.  At the paper, at the police department, at city hall and even on the streets.  Sides are taken and people are betrayed on all fronts.The real power of the show is its unflinching brutality.  I don't mean non-stop violence or over-the-top gore.  I mean realistic drama centering around characters who are real to us and the fact that there are no storybook endings that await them.  The drug trade/world is not a pretty one and this show is not shy about showing it without glamorizing or sugarcoating it.  The show's brutal nature will not be for everyone.The DVD set contains some interesting behind-the-scenes features and commentary on select episodes.  I wished there were more extras, but I think there are more on the complete series box set that came out awhile ago.  I won't pick that up now, but if it ever comes out on Blu-Ray I will be first in line!""The Wire: Season 5"" is how a great series should end.  There will be surprises and there will be devastating moments.  While I am sad that this is it, I don't see where else they could go after this and this is how the creators always saw how the series would end.  It is one of the best acted and written shows I have ever seen.  If you haven't given it a chance, I strongly encourage you to take the journey from the very beginning.  If you are caught up and are starting this final season, you are in for a treat.  Just remember that it may require a few viewings to really appreciate it.  All good shows do, after all.  -Michael Crane",5,"""Because brother, when you were good, you were the best we had...""",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,4788,"['Wire', 'hands-down', 'best', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Period', 'Now', 'know', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'Carnivale', 'still', 'top', 'favorite', 'mine', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'expected', 'show', 'series', 'captivating', 'intriguing', 'Not', 'one', 'bad', 'episode', 'not', 'one', 'weak', 'season', 'characters', 'good', 'bad', 'cared', 'were', 'interested', 'enough', 'take', 'journey', 'fact', 'show', 'never', 'won', 'Emmy', 'was', 'only', 'nominated', 'once', 'writing', 'credit', 'absolute', 'travesty', ""'ve"", 'never', 'forgiven', 'Emmys', 'ever', 'enough', 'gushing', 'Wire', 'Season', '5', 'bittersweet', 'appropriate', 'goodbye', 'one', 'best', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'slacking', 'cutting-corners.The', 'city', 'Baltimore', 'even', 'worse', 'conditions', 'before', 'new', 'Mayor', 'who', 'forced', 'make', 'budget', 'cuts', 'worst', 'places', 'such', 'Baltimore', 'police', 'department', 'cases', 'go', 'hush', 'unrest', 'department', 'who', 'yet', 'see', 'single', 'penny', 'over-time', 'Marlo', 'crew', 'are', 'still', 'dealing', 'use', 'weakness', 'police', 'department', 'advantage', 'start', 'killing', 'again', 'having', 'play', 'safe', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'Marlo', 'mind', 'however', 'also', 'thinking', 'revenge', 'crew', 'will', 'do', 'horrible', 'act', 'will', 'force', 'anti-hero', 'robber', 'drug-dealers', 'Omar', 'retirement', 'Budget', 'cuts', 'have', 'also', 'effected', 'Baltimore', 'Sun', 'newspaper', 'also', 'forced', 'do', 'more', 'less', 'writer', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'creating', 'own', 'stories', 'people', 'quotes', 'will', 'write', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'targeting', 'homeless', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty', 'being', 'pulled', 'Marlo', 'Stanfield', 'case', 'back', 'being', 'Detective', 'may', 'remember', 'cleaning', 'up', 'act', 'somewhat', 'previous', 'season', 'gone', 'back', 'hardcore-drinking', 'fooling-around-with-other-women', 'ways', 'McNulty', 'most', 'self-destructive', 'when', 'become', 'fed', 'up', 'politics', 'higher-ups', 'ignoring', 'low-profile', 'murders', 'McNulty', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'desperate', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'costing', 'badge', 'could', 'also', 'send', 'prison', 'caught', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'stories', 'lay', 'ahead', 'powerful', 'season.What', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'season', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'already', 'always', 'hard', 'be', 'satisfied', 'final', 'season', 'when', 'know', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'disappointed', 'loved', 'only', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'Never', 'there', 'been', 'show', 'opinion', 'where', 'run', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'none', 'are', 'flat', 'have', 'drive', 'reason', 'care', 'single', 'story', 'angle', 'referred', 'cop', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'reason', 'show', 'EVERYONE', 'see', 'perspectives', 'cops', 'also', 'see', 'crooks', 'dealers.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'name', 'off', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'THEY', 'ALL', 'DO', 'Now', 'how', 'rare', 'love', 'how', 'season', 'something', 'different', 'newspaper', 'angle', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'politics', 'are', 'being', 'played', 'EVERYWHERE', 'paper', 'police', 'department', 'city', 'hall', 'even', 'streets', 'Sides', 'are', 'taken', 'people', 'are', 'betrayed', 'fronts.The', 'real', 'power', 'show', 'unflinching', 'brutality', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'non-stop', 'violence', 'over-the-top', 'gore', 'mean', 'realistic', 'drama', 'centering', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'fact', 'are', 'storybook', 'await', 'drug', 'trade/world', 'not', 'pretty', 'one', 'show', 'not', 'shy', 'showing', 'glamorizing', 'sugarcoating', 'show', 'brutal', 'nature', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'interesting', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'commentary', 'select', 'episodes', 'wished', 'were', 'more', 'extras', 'think', 'are', 'more', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'ago', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'now', 'ever', 'out', 'Blu-Ray', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'Wire', 'Season', '5', 'how', 'great', 'series', 'should', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'surprises', 'will', 'be', 'devastating', 'moments', 'am', 'sad', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'else', 'could', 'go', 'how', 'creators', 'always', 'saw', 'how', 'series', 'would', 'end', 'one', 'best', 'acted', 'written', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'take', 'journey', 'very', 'beginning', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'are', 'starting', 'final', 'season', 'are', 'treat', 'Just', 'remember', 'may', 'require', 'few', 'viewings', 'really', 'appreciate', 'good', 'shows', 'do', '-Michael', 'Crane']",The Wire: Season 5

1134483,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00123BY6S,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[96, 101]","That quote by Bunk (Wendell Pierce) in the opening episode of the final season of David Simon's brilliant The Wire sets the stage for the events that unfold in these final ten episodes of the beloved HBO series.Picking up from the fourth season, Mayor Carcetti (Aidan Gillen) is pouring money into the Baltimore school system, which prompts the police force to work without paid overtime, and also finds the ever self-destructive Jimmy McNulty's (Dominic West) wiretap on murderous drug dealer Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector) put to a premature end.  Things begin to change however, when McNulty, along with Freamon's (Clarke Peters) help, manipulate and orchestrate an imaginary, homeless preying, serial killer that garners national attention, all in an effort to put Marlo away once and for all.Also, much like the previous season focused on the broken education system, the fifth season focuses on the impact of the media in the form of the Baltimore Sun; as editor Gus Haynes (longtime series director Clark Johnson) deals with the downsizing of his staff, and the rise of a reporter (Thomas McCarthy) who may be making up his stories.  In the meantime (proving that The Wire is indeed the most multilayered television drama ever created), other subplots abound, including a revenge driven Omar (Michael K. Williams) returning with Marlo in his sights; young Michael (Tristan Wilds) and Dukie (Jermaine Crawford) learn just how dire their situation is; Bubbles (Andre Royo) finds light at the end of the tunnel; and Daniels (Lance Reddick) prepares to take on the role of Commissioner.  Most notably however is the impact of the actions of McNulty and Freamon; an impact that ends up effecting everyone in striking distance and beyond, and sets the stage for the final episode of the series, which is one of the most brilliant pieces of television to ever materialize.  Not everyone walks away clean (or walks away at all) and rides into the sunset, but it is a perfect way to end a perfect series, and with appearances from familiar faces aplenty along the way, things couldn't have been wrapped up better.All in all, the final season of The Wire further proves the frequently mentioned point of just how unbelievably good this show was, and how much of a shame it is that it never achieved the kind of uber-popularity that it deserved compared to many of HBO's other shows.  Either way, longtime fan or late newcomer, there is nearly nothing better than The Wire, even to its bittersweet end.""...you gotta keep the devil way down in the hole...""",5,"""The bigger the lie, the more they believe""",1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2551,"['quote', 'Bunk', 'Wendell', 'Pierce', 'opening', 'episode', 'final', 'season', 'David', 'Simon', 'brilliant', 'Wire', 'stage', 'events', 'unfold', 'final', 'ten', 'episodes', 'beloved', 'HBO', 'series.Picking', 'up', 'fourth', 'season', 'Mayor', 'Carcetti', 'Aidan', 'Gillen', 'pouring', 'money', 'Baltimore', 'school', 'system', 'police', 'force', 'work', 'paid', 'overtime', 'also', 'ever', 'self-destructive', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty', 'Dominic', 'West', 'wiretap', 'murderous', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Marlo', 'Stanfield', 'Jamie', 'Hector', 'put', 'premature', 'end', 'Things', 'begin', 'change', 'however', 'when', 'McNulty', 'Freamon', 'Clarke', 'Peters', 'help', 'manipulate', 'orchestrate', 'imaginary', 'homeless', 'preying', 'serial', 'killer', 'garners', 'national', 'attention', 'effort', 'put', 'Marlo', 'away', 'once', 'all.Also', 'much', 'previous', 'season', 'focused', 'broken', 'education', 'system', 'fifth', 'season', 'impact', 'media', 'form', 'Baltimore', 'Sun', 'editor', 'Gus', 'Haynes', 'longtime', 'series', 'director', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'downsizing', 'staff', 'rise', 'reporter', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'making', 'up', 'stories', 'meantime', 'proving', 'Wire', 'indeed', 'most', 'multilayered', 'television', 'drama', 'ever', 'created', 'other', 'subplots', 'abound', 'including', 'revenge', 'driven', 'Omar', 'Michael', 'K.', 'Williams', 'returning', 'Marlo', 'sights', 'young', 'Michael', 'Tristan', 'Wilds', 'Dukie', 'Jermaine', 'Crawford', 'learn', 'just', 'how', 'dire', 'situation', 'Bubbles', 'Andre', 'Royo', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'Daniels', 'Lance', 'Reddick', 'take', 'role', 'Commissioner', 'Most', 'notably', 'however', 'impact', 'actions', 'McNulty', 'Freamon', 'impact', 'up', 'effecting', 'everyone', 'striking', 'distance', 'stage', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'pieces', 'television', 'ever', 'materialize', 'Not', 'everyone', 'away', 'clean', 'walks', 'away', 'sunset', 'perfect', 'way', 'end', 'perfect', 'series', 'appearances', 'familiar', 'aplenty', 'way', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'wrapped', 'up', 'better.All', 'final', 'season', 'Wire', 'further', 'frequently', 'mentioned', 'point', 'just', 'how', 'unbelievably', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'shame', 'never', 'achieved', 'kind', 'uber-popularity', 'deserved', 'compared', 'many', 'HBO', 'other', 'shows', 'way', 'longtime', 'fan', 'late', 'newcomer', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'better', 'Wire', 'even', 'bittersweet', 'end', 'got', 'ta', 'keep', 'devil', 'way', 'down', 'hole']",The Wire: Season 5
1134484,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B00123BY6S,Olukayode Balogun,"[5, 5]","There's a scene at the beginning of episode one of this season of ""The Wire"" involving a suspect and a photocopier that fans of the classic NBC series ""Homicide: Life On The Street"" will very much appreciate. Indeed, Detective Munch (played by Richard Belzer), one of the stars on ""Homicide"" before he made the move to his present home on ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"", was actually in that classic scene. I mention Belzer because he actually makes a cameo appearance later on in this season of ""The Wire"", much to my surprise and delight. David Simon, who as fans will know, is the brains behind both these series, also makes a blink-and-you'll-miss-it non-speaking appearance later on in the season.Then there's a scene at the opening of episode two, where Bubbles (played by Andre Royo), who I just adore, tells the audience at his local Narcotics Anonymous meeting that he's been clean for fifteen months. My heart was smiling along with my face as I put my knife and fork down - I was watching while having breakfast - and joined in the applause. Not only did I feel that I was right there in the meeting room, but after four seasons, I've begun to feel like I actually know Bubbles and have grown to love the drug fiend with a heart of gold that he is. I was totally happy for him.Meanwhile, McNulty (played by Dominic West), co-opting an exasperated Freamon (played by Clarke Peters) and to the complete disgust of Bunk (played by Wendell Pierce), resorts to desperate measures to secure funding for his detail's hunt for Marlo (played by Jamie Hector) and somehow, a ""Baltimore Sun"" reporter finds himself drawn in and way over his head. It was fascinating to watch the machinations of the police and media working side by side and in many respects, in conjunction with each other. McNulty gets what he wants and the funding flows in from the Mayor's office but has he bitten off more than he can chew?For me though, the nectar to be savoured this season was watching the development of the seemingly inevitable showdown between Omar (played by Michael K. Williams) and Marlo. The actual end was hinted at before it actually happened, but it still came as a shock. It left me somewhat dissatisfied. It was somewhat of an anticlimax.But still, all this is why I love this show so much. Like most fans, I've been following most of the characters since the first season and they've become almost like family. I'm not sure I've identified this closely with characters from any other series I've ever watched. Ever.The final season of ""The Wire"" ended here in the UK recently and my local TV guide was full of praise when it premiered. (The first two or three seasons passed them by completely but better late than never, right?). The show was even featured on the BBC's highly-respected programme ""Newsnight Review"" and it was equally exalting: ""The best TV you've never seen,"" one reviewer said. ""A modern epic,"" said another. I agree with every single word.My local TV guide, ""Radio Times"", was also waxing lyrical just before the final season aired. Call me smug but I've been telling anyone who would listen about ""The Wire"" since the first season, as have all true devotees of this brilliant HBO show - and so, Amazon permitting, I'm taking the liberty of sharing the magazine's comments (with a few minor edits) with the Amazon community. This is what they said:""It has never won big audiences or major awards, but ""The Wire"" has repeatedly been described by critics [and fans alike] as ""the best drama on TV"". Why do they rate it so highly? Its forensic realism for one thing, along with a pitiless examination of corruption in police and local government - and all this as the background to a police procedural with complex characters, intelligent plotting and a total absence of cop-show clich&eacute;. If you've promised yourself to give it a look, do it soon, as the fifth and final season begins on [UK cable channel] FX on Monday [the 21st of July].This series is also the swansong for the Yorkshire-born [I did not know this], Eton-educated [didn't know this either] Dominic West who stars as boozy cop Jimmy McNulty. After six years of playing an American anti-hero, he's going on to play Oliver Cromwell, the man once voted the tenth greatest Briton of all time, in [UK terrestrial] Channel 4's epic drama ""The Devil's Whore"", coming this autumn...""Elsewhere, the magazine also states:""The fifth series of the compelling cop drama has finally arrived and it doesn't disappoint. Creator David Simon has again shifted focus to another ailing institution, [and this time it's] the press. At a fictional version of ""The Baltimore Sun"" (where Simon worked in real life), a team of journalists produces the same stories day in, day out. Disillusioned city editor Gus Haynes (Clark Johnson) stalks between desks, his balding pate gleaming, demanding ""Where else would you rather be, huh, kids?""He's one more cog in the city's worn-out machinery and he knows it. Elsewhere, the battle between Baltimore's drug dealers and a cash-strapped police department continues. This is a drama at its best: gritty, smart and completely addictive...""Like I said, I agree with every word. I've watched all four previous seasons of ""The Wire"" and I can say with ease and without the slightest intent at hyperbole, that it is the best thing I've ever watched on TV. This is a series that has taken multi-layered storytelling to new levels of complexity. No other series ever has managed to get me to invest in every season on DVD and I doubt any other series ever will. I'm sorry to see it end but I think those behind it are doing the right thing. Best to go out on a high.If you haven't seen this piece of genius yet, I urge you to give it a try. It does require focus and patience but the payoff is huge, which makes it ideally suited to DVD (the language is indigenously authentic, which makes the subtitles really handy for me) and this is a show that doesn't even attempt to mollycoddle or help you along in any way (which for me, makes the review button equally handy on occasion). If you're a genuine connoisseur of good TV, do yourself a favour and buy this. In fact, buy all five seasons if you can. The politics is as rough and tumble as any I've seen on ""The West Wing"", the gangsters are as real (and as ruthless) as they are on ""The Sopranos"" and the police procedure equals ""Homicide: Life On The Street"", ""NYPD Blue"" or ""Law & Order"" effortlessly. And even though I have some media experience, the media angle to this final season just opened up a whole new world to me.On the con side, there are only ten episodes to this season and, as I forgot to mention when I reviewed season four, the packaging of the fourth and fifth season DVDs are not quite as sturdy as the first three were but I'm probably nitpicking. None of that is really important if I'm totally honest. To me, this is the best TV show ever. My hat goes off to David Simon, the cast, crew, directors, writers and absolutely everyone else involved with it.So don't be one of those who got left behind and catch up now. If I were a lottery winner I'd buy all five seasons for all my friends and family. One weekend - probably this coming winter - I'm going to stock up my fridge and cupboards with plenty of food and drink, switch off my phone and watch all five seasons back to back. It's going to be heavenly :)As reviews go, this is one of my longer ones but I could write a thesis on this show. I suspect someday, someone probably will.",5,The Best TV Show Ever: The Final Chapter,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,7523,"['scene', 'beginning', 'episode', 'one', 'season', 'Wire', 'involving',

Before Season Four, I thought Season Three was the best. Now all I can say is the series as a whole, is the best I've ever seen of all the crime shows. I don't care that some of the others have gone on for more seasons than this one ever lasted. This series tops them all - no exceptions (and I used to be an enormous fan of THE SHIELD).The characters played, were so convincing that you cried for the suffering of some, and hated and despised the actions of others, as if they were real people. These feelings could go for both cops and the bads guys. The acting was absolutely First Class.I thought I was going to be bored out of my mind with the scenes from the newsroom, until I realized just how much more important their part was in bringing forth the stories to the public. Yes, they were an important and integral part that was intelligently added (and rightly so) in this final season.I don't think I'll ever forget, Marlo, Chris and Snoop (stone killers), Omar (body armor, shogun and whistling), McNulty (the best and worst), Bunk (cigar), Kima, Lester (The Wire man himself), Stringer Bell (excellent - Idris Elba), Avon, Bubs (fantastic story), Prop Joe, Duquan, Royce, Prez, Hauk, Michael Lee, Ellis Carver, and the entertainingly obnoxious, Senator Clay (Sheeeeee-it) Davis.My personal favorites from the above list, in my fictional category: ""Should have won an Emmy,"" were both bad guys - Stringer Bell, played by Idris Elba; and Omar Little, played by Michael K.

1134488,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00123BY6S,R.A. McKenzie,"[52, 57]","***EDIT NOTE (August 7th, 2008)***I have learned from IGN that by the end of this year - early 2009 at the latest - all 5 seasons of THE WIRE will be released in a box set.  I will write a review once Amazon puts up an item for purchase.If you want to go in fresh, then I suggest not reading any Season Five reviews.  But if you've already started, then read on.  I've done everything possible to avoid spoilers, yet critique from my own point of view.***ORIGINAL REVIEW***Typing reviews on TV seasons can be problematic.  If you're a newcomer to the series who just wants to know whether THE WIRE held up through all 60 episodes, the short answer is a resounding ""Yes!""  This series took big chances with each season, and each episode was carefully constructed and executed.  They don't call this show a ""visual novel"" for nothing.  THE WIRE is easily the most realistic TV series ever produced, and mastered the art of slow build-up.But for those who missed out on Season Five, I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible.  If you're looking for a debate, go to IMDB --- you'll find plenty to fight about.Trying to discuss plot threads and outlines of this Season would take an entire website, so let's split this up into the key players:THE POLICE---Season Five lets the Major Case Squad return to its roots as they track Marlo Stanfield, but the twist is that the entire police force is underpaid with morale at an all-time low.  Whatever happened to Baltimore's economy since last year has crippled the cops from doing good policework, let alone keep the stats at an acceptable level.  The few individuals who're motivated to work the cases, however, choose a shockingly unethcial approach.  This approach (which I don't want to give away) opens up the classic question: ""Do the ends justify the means?""  Some fans thought this scenario was unbelieveable, but I say there've been more elaborate methods of deceit in this country's history.  The police department's ethics and morals are really put through the ringer, this time.  You might have to take a grain of salt, but I think most viewers will grow to love the cops' creativity by the series' end.  Also, we finally get some closure on the past between Daniels & Burell, but in true WIRE fashion, we don't learn everything.  Overall, the threads involving Baltimore law enforcement worked very well, in my opinion.THE POLITICS---There is some sweet material here, even though it's basically two stories.  The first is Clay Davis's fate.  I couldn't have predicted any of the twists that followed, and still can't believe them after I think about it.  I'm very impressed that a minor colorful character really evolved into one of the Season's most memorable figures --- just when you think you've witnessed the climax, Davis's tale comes back with another layer.  Also in THE WIRE's political focus is Tommy Carcetti's ongoing struggle to balance his ambition and his civic duties.  These scenes were well-acted, but I was disappointed that nothing really changed within the offices.  I know that's the point of the story, but it only works for so many consecutive episodes.  However, I still think that Season Five portrays a good examination of general politics, warts and all.THE STREETS---Both my favorite and least favorite aspect of Season Five.  Marlo Stanfield and his crew lay low, and kinda toy with the cops a bit in the first episode.  ""The Game"" of the drug trade no longer has room for the idealists from seasons' past; this generation's players are more eager to violence and swift resolutions.  I'm glad THE WIRE never becomes a bloodbath, but I'm disappointed that such cold violence failed to grip me.  My problems with this part of the story were mainly because I didn't care enough about the dealers.  Marlo, Snoop, Partlow, Slim Charles, Cheese, and Prop Joe...the actors are all up to the task, but the story wasn't as brilliant as its predecesors.  Even the arcs involving teens Michael and Duquan didn't move me a lot, which surprising because they're such tragic characters; it's scary to think the real world is even harder on America's lower-class youth.  However, keep in my mind I'm disappointed by THE WIRE's standards --- these tough scenes surpass any other TV urban drama.  Where Season Five is at its best is with our everyman Bubbles.  Andre Royo's performance treads delicately between subtle and dramatic, and he's never been better in the role.  Bubbles represents every person in the world: if you give your attention to even the smallest person, a compelling story is waiting to come out.  Speaking of stories...THE NEWSROOM---Each season, THE WIRE reveals a new side of Baltimore.  For Season Five, we meet the press from inside the Baltimore Sun.  The editing room vibe is just as important as the characters who inhabit them.  Everyone from the greedy management to disillusioned veterans, and from ambitious journalists to a stoic editor jump on a hot story --- the only catch is that some of Baltimore's finest may not be so fine after all.  Clearly, David Simon (creator/writer) knows this field like the back of his hand.  Even if you didn't know he used to be a Baltimore Sun reporter, you'd swear Simon lived within this arena.  I think most of Season Five's detractors focused on this story arc.  My only real gripe is that the Sun's management isn't given enough depth: we've seen these bosses a million times before (they'll do anything for the greatest profit, or coverage, regardless of quality).  Like the Streets angle, the actors are pitch-perfect, but the story had a few more yards to go.  Still, conflicted journalism is always an interesting subject, and THE WIRE did an excellent job with it.CLOSING THOUGHTS---THE WIRE is a show we'll never get again.  The acting is flawless; what I mean is that no character dominates the show.  From start to finish, everyone on THE WIRE shares an equal prescence.  The writing is also superb, especially when watching on DVD.  How did we ever survive the week-by-week schedule?  THE WIRE is much stronger when you take it all in one sitting.Sadly, Season Five is easily my least favorite for two reasons.AND PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU WANT NOTHING SPOILED!*  Each episode features a brief cameo from previous seasons' cast.  Cameos and guest appearances are fine, but very few of them contributed anything unique.  For example: Cutty gets a few brief scenes with Duquan.  Cutty basically tells the confused teen that he doesn't know what the world holds for us.  It's nice to see them interact, but the ideas are a bit recycled.  THE WIRE has always been able to give us little details without distracting from the big picture.  In Season Five, these cameos took me out of the moment.*  But here is my biggest problem with Season Five:First off, some fans didn't like how THE WIRE jumped from the streets to the docks, or how one year suddenly became about school children and not the police.  However, no one can deny THE WIRE was always tried to expand its horizons.  This is a fact.Where Season Five slips up is that David Simon tries to resolve just about everything.  I always thought this show was stronger when some issues remained ambiguous, and when not every question was answered.  There was a sense of irony in each season's resolution.  But in THE WIRE's final act, Simon apparently couldn't let some questions go.  The Series Finale is superb, no doubt.  But Simon's attempt to connect everything together makes the world of Baltimore feel much smaller.Maybe THE WIRE is about an interconnected world after all.However, don't let my little nitpicks prevent any of you from watching this outstanding series' conclusion.If you're a fan, you're gonna pick up Season Five anyway.If you're a skeptic, have faith and spend the money.If you're a newcomer to the series, I envy you.

1134489,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00123BY6S,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","I had a hard time watching this all the way through:  characters I had come to like and respect were making what could prove fatally bad choices in pursuit of their goals.  This engaged me all the more in this unbelievably realistic and complex story, which I have pretty much watched straight through for the past few months (now on a 2nd round, with a maximum of 2 episodes per day, which as with any great novel you see much more than the 1st time).  The characters continue to evolve, as does the situation of an American city in crisis.  The great focus in this season is the press:  at a moment of declining circulation, it is struggling to maintain journalistic standards yet appeal to readers.McNulty (the bad good guy), for all his talents, is sliding back into a downward spiral with alcohol, lies, and bar pickups.  He crosses professional boundaries into dangerous new territory and tries his hardest to ruin his new relationship, alienating almost all of his old friends.  Even his life might be at stake.  He is one of the best and most realistically multi-facetted characters that has ever been on TV.Meanwhile, Daniels seems annointed for greatness, given a chance to actually clean up the police dept., a job that would perfectly fit his talent and experience.  To do so, however, he must cross the worst kind of political minefield as well as confront his past.  It isn't pretty.  Many other characters also evolve - not necessarily by growing - in realistic ways.  The thuggishly stupid Hurk reveals his true core, allying himself with the sleazy drug lawyer.  Carver, meanwhile, is growing into a great cop, after some crucial mentoring from Bunny, who also nurtures the only child to escape the corner from season 4.  Such a pleasure to contemplate, characters that can live in the imagination after the series finished!  Of course, the fates of Marlo (the new prince) and Omar (the good bad guy) seem to come full circle.  Nothing that comes is completely expected.The politics has also made me want to learn about Baltimore.  Never has a show so stimulated my interests into a new direction (with the possible exception of Star Trek as a kid).  Carcetti the mayor makes some fateful choices, furthering himself while compromising on his agenda, often from no fault of his own.  (""They always disappoint."")  But there are so many other characters who advance and manipulate, clearly showing how out of their depth the Maryland prosecutors are.  Bubbles, invited to climb the stairs, in particular has an interesting resolution.Warmly recommended.  No wonder they use this at Harvard to stimulate discussion on America's cities - it is a wonderful place to start because the viewer cares so much about all the players.",5,an agonizing conclusion to the best TV series ever,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,2739,"['had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'way', 'characters', 'had', 'come', 'like', 'respect', 'were', 'making', 'what', 'could', 'prove', 'fatally', 'bad', 'choices', 'pursuit', 'goals', 'engaged', 'more', 'unbelievably', 'realistic', 'complex', 'story', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'watched', 'straight', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'now', '2nd', 'round', 'maximum', '2', 'episodes', 'day', 'great', 'novel', 'see', 'much', 'more', '1st', 'time', 'characters', 'continue', 'evolve', 'situation', 'American', 'city', 'crisis', 'great', 'focus', 'season', 'press', 'moment', 'declining', 'circulation', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'journalistic', 'standards', 'yet', 'appeal', 'readers.McNulty', 'bad', 'good', 'guy', 'talents', 'sliding', 'back', 'downward', 'spiral', 'alcohol', 'bar', 'pickups', 'professional', 'boundaries', 'dangerous', 'new', 'territory', 'hardest', 'ruin', 'new', 'relationship', 'alienating', 'almost', 'old', 'friends', 'Even', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'stake', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'realistically', 'multi-facetted', 'characters', 'ever', 'been', 'TV.Meanwhile', 'Daniels', 'annointed', 'greatness', 'given', 'chance', 'actually', 'clean', 'up', 'police', 'dept.', 'job', 'would', 'perfectly', 'fit', 'talent', 'experience', 'do', 'so', 'however', 'must', 'cross', 'worst', 'kind', 'political', 'minefield', 'as', 'well', 'confront', 'past', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'Many', 'other', 'characters', 'also', 'evolve', 'not', 'necessarily', 'growing', 'realistic', 'ways', 'thuggishly', 'stupid', 'Hurk', 'true', 'core', 'allying', 'sleazy', 'drug', 'lawyer', 'Carver', 'meanwhile', 'growing', 'great', 'cop', 'crucial', 'mentoring', 'Bunny', 'who', 'also', 'only', 'child', 'escape', 'corner', 'season', '4', 'pleasure', 'contemplate', 'characters', 'can', 'live', 'imagination', 'series', 'finished', 'course', 'fates', 'Marlo', 'new', 'prince', 'Omar', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'seem', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'Nothing', 'completely', 'expected.The', 'politics', 'also', 'made', 'want', 'learn', 'Baltimore', 'Never', 'show', 'so', 'stimulated', 'interests', 'new', 'direction', 'possible', 'exception', 'Star', 'Trek', 'kid', 'Carcetti', 'mayor', 'fateful', 'choices', 'furthering', 'compromising', 'agenda', 'often', 'fault', 'own', 'always', 'disappoint', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'advance', 'manipulate', 'clearly', 'showing', 'how', 'depth', 'Maryland', 'prosecutors', 'are', 'Bubbles', 'invited', 'climb', 'stairs', 'particular', 'interesting', 'resolution.Warmly', 'recommended', 'wonder', 'use', 'Harvard', 'stimulate', 'discussion', 'America', 'cities', 'wonderful', 'place', 'start', 'viewer', 'so', 'much', 'players']",The Wire: Season 5

1134492,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00123BY6S,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","HBO's ""The Wire"" is the crown jewel of the cable channel's deservedly famous roster.  Steeped in the real Baltimore, beloved but broken home town for the show's creators Ed Burns and David Simon, ""The Wire"" has offered the most consistently excellent, riveting television over its first four seasons, each of which tackled a single theme of Baltimore's compelling story of a city falling apart.  From the futile, noble struggle of all-too-human police against all-too-human drug dealers, to the destruction of the Baltimore docks as a pillar of the community, to civic corruption, to the collapse of the Baltimore school system, ""The Wire"" brought urban collapse into our homes as nothing has before.The fifth season was advertised as the final entry before it ran, and the writers wrote it as such.  As a result, the writers confronted not only this season's theme, the destruction of journalism as an institution, but also the wrapping up of the dizzying number of plot strands that kept ""The Wire"" so fresh.  The newspaper stories ring all too true as the Baltimore Sun slashes its journalistic standards along with its payroll, mortgaging its credibility in the hopes that a young writer could win a Pulitzer even though his stories are obviously fabricated.  At the same time, the police force is being torn apart from the inside due to rampant budget cuts.  Everyone's favorite screw-up of a detective, Jimmy McNulty, fabricates a serial killer in order to bring attention (and therefore funds) to the PD.  Marlo continues to battle to become Baltimore's drug kingpin, while Omar strives to bring Marlo down.  Bubbles strives toward sobriety, and Bunk tries to save McNulty's soul.In other words, it's just the usual stuff for ""The Wire.""Perhaps the only criticism I have is that the show might go too far in wrapping up every single loose end - the series finale seems like one long epilogue/send-off.

This show is the most criminally underwatched shows I can think of other than arrested development. Despite the outpouring of critical and academic praise this show has received it still is not well known or watched by enough people. The ratings were modest enough and I'm sure the dvd sales are fairly strong but as good as this show is it should have been a smash hit. But that's just one of those truths about life- most people are stupid and wouldn't know a good show if it came up and punched them in the gut. Which, in a way, this show does quite often. It's cynical, dark, tragic, and almost anarchist but it also happens to be an extremely authentic portrayal of life in most American cities. Despite all the darkness and cynicism though, it is also quite hilarious. The characters' banter between one another is always funny no matter how many times I watch it. There has to be some humor in a show this dark, much like breaking bad, which is a show most often compared to this one as far as ""best show ever made."" I love both but I have to say this one matters so much more. It should and is being used as curriculum in certain universities around the country.

Frustrated that Marlo still running his corners with impunity and new Mayor Thomas Carcetti (Aidan Gillen), Jimmy McNulty decides to bend the rules beyond the breaking point and sets up a fake series of crimes to pull funds into the investigation. The Baltimore Sun Newspaper, facing buyouts and cuts, lets a new, young hotshot get away with falsification of stories because there's no fact checking. Soon the two are racing down a parallel track towards a dangerous end.The spiraling storylines that The Wire is known for again keep thing racing at a breakneck pace. Bubbles is trying to come clean, as singer Steve Earle plays his drug counselor. A crooked councilman discovers he's about to get hung up in court, and one of the finest gangster characters ever lensed, Omar (Michael K. Williams, who completely owns the gay gangster with a shotgun) goes on a one man path of revenge. Just about everyone left alive shows up, and while they may complete their stories, they are by no means resolved.That kind of storytelling, where the ends my be visible but not tidy, that made ""The Wire"" a series that defied most Television parameters.
