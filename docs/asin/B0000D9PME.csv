777166,A17VI5JKD3AQFH,B0000D9PME,cd-heaven,"[53, 56]","Gary Moore performing at the Monster's of Rock, opening for Whitesnake?  What is this a joke?  Gary Mooreand the word Rock in the same sentence?!$&amp;*(@ I thought Gary sworn off rock, sworn off all his old 80's heavyrock songs and just wanted to concentrate on the &quot;blues&quot;.  Well guess what my friends, Gary Moore has finallyawaken from his coma he slipped into around 1990, and it back fricking rocking again!!!!!!!!!!!!!And he hasn't missed a beat!!!!  I just picked this up to cure my curiousity of if time has affected Gary's rock chopsand I got my answer with the first note played on Shapes of Things, Gary Moore proves again that he is still thebest rock guitarist period!  My jaw hit the floor, as Gary Moore just shreds, and rips through new rock tunes, old 80'srock classics from his solo years/Lizzy years, and some covers that just quite simply question why he had abandonedrock music for almost 14 years.This DVD concert is incredibly done!  The sound and picture quality are first rate.  Beautifully shot with multiple camerasbut not over done (ala Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio release).  Gary and his band just smoke.  The band was touring in support of their Scarsalbum released in 2002.  Gary's band only consist of 2 other memeber.  Cass Lewis on bass and Darrin Mahoney on drums.That's it. No synths. No keyboards. Nothing but guitar, bass, and drums. And of course Gary's vocals.Gary was opening for Whitesnake on this tour, and was given a 60 minute performance time to crank and he waste noneof that time.  10 songs performed including Shapes, Free's Wishing Well, Scars' Recitfy, Stand Up, and  Just Can't Let You Go.Walking By Myself and Out in the Fields from Garys solo years, and (his pre-days in Lizzy's  Don't Believe A Word, which he just nailswith a twin guitar sounding solo/leads (You'll ask yourself as you watch, how does he do it!!!)  Gary's encore is thescorching, mesmerizing  Parisienne Walkways.  And since Moore is just hot, he does not fail on this.  All togethera 60 minute rock marathon!!!Now, do not be scared off by the low running time of this DVD. The special features are just the icing on the cake!!! Althoughit is not very detailed on the DVD case, the soundcheck footage is AWESOME!!!! You see Gary and the band crank outand additional 15 minutes live on stage.  They do Shape of Things and Don't Believe a Word.  Also, you Gary just jam a biton his guitar.  The last special feature is the interview which last around another 15 minutes and is very very worth while.Gary is a very intellectual guitarist and does not just sit there and go &quot;duh this and duh that&quot;.  This 30 minutes of bonusfootage push the DVD running time into 90 minutes, instead of the 63 minutes listed on the DVD case.  Very very nice.All in all, if you are a Gary Moore fan, or just a fan of guitar rock, you will not be disappointed with this.Welcome back to the world of rock, Gary, I can't wait to hear MOORE!!!!!",5,Gary Moore + Rock = Let me scratch my head on this one!,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,2960,"['Gary', 'Moore', 'performing', 'Monster', 'Rock', 'opening', 'Whitesnake', 'What', 'joke', 'Gary', 'Mooreand', 'word', 'Rock', 'same', 'sentence', 'amp', '*', '@', 'thought', 'Gary', 'sworn', 'off', 'rock', 'sworn', 'off', 'old', '80', 'heavyrock', 'songs', 'just', 'wanted', 'concentrate', 'quot', 'blues', 'quot', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'friends', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'finallyawaken', 'coma', 'slipped', '1990', 'back', 'fricking', 'rocking', 'again', ""n't"", 'missed', 'beat', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'cure', 'curiousity', 'time', 'affected', 'Gary', 'rock', 'chopsand', 'got', 'answer', 'first', 'note', 'played', 'Shapes', 'Things', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'again', 'still', 'thebest', 'rock', 'guitarist', 'period', 'jaw', 'hit', 'floor', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'just', 'shreds', 'rips', 'new', 'rock', 'tunes', 'old', ""80'srock"", 'classics', 'solo', 'years/Lizzy', 'years', 'covers', 'just', 'quite', 'simply', 'question', 'why', 'had', 'abandonedrock', 'music', 'almost', '14', 'years.This', 'DVD', 'concert', 'incredibly', 'done', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Beautifully', 'shot', 'multiple', 'camerasbut', 'not', 'done', 'ala', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'Rock', 'Rio', 'release', 'Gary', 'band', 'just', 'smoke', 'band', 'was', 'touring', 'support', 'Scarsalbum', 'released', '2002', 'Gary', 'band', 'only', 'consist', '2', 'other', 'memeber', 'Cass', 'Lewis', 'bass', 'Darrin', 'Mahoney', 'synths', 'keyboards', 'Nothing', 'guitar', 'bass', 'drums', 'course', 'Gary', 'vocals.Gary', 'was', 'opening', 'Whitesnake', 'tour', 'was', 'given', '60', 'minute', 'performance', 'time', 'crank', 'waste', 'time', '10', 'songs', 'performed', 'including', 'Shapes', 'Free', 'Wishing', 'Well', 'Scars', 'Recitfy', 'Stand', 'Up', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Let', 'Go.Walking', 'Myself', 'Out', 'Fields', 'Garys', 'solo', 'years', 'pre-days', 'Lizzy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'A', 'Word', 'just', 'nailswith', 'twin', 'guitar', 'sounding', 'solo/leads', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'watch', 'how', 'do', 'Gary', 'encore', 'thescorching', 'mesmerizing', 'Parisienne', 'Walkways', 'Moore', 'just', 'hot', 'not', 'fail', 'togethera', '60', 'minute', 'rock', 'marathon', 'Now', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'off', 'low', 'running', 'time', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'Althoughit', 'not', 'very', 'detailed', 'DVD', 'case', 'soundcheck', 'footage', 'AWESOME', 'see', 'Gary', 'band', 'crank', 'outand', 'additional', '15', 'minutes', 'live', 'stage', 'do', 'Shape', 'Things', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Word', 'Also', 'Gary', 'just', 'biton', 'guitar', 'last', 'special', 'feature', 'interview', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'very', 'very', 'worth', 'while.Gary', 'very', 'intellectual', 'guitarist', 'not', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'go', 'quot', 'duh', 'duh', 'quot', '30', 'minutes', 'bonusfootage', 'push', 'DVD', 'running', 'time', '90', 'minutes', 'instead', '63', 'minutes', 'listed', 'DVD', 'case', 'Very', 'very', 'nice.All', 'are', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'fan', 'just', 'fan', 'guitar', 'rock', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'this.Welcome', 'back', 'world', 'rock', 'Gary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hear', 'MOORE']",N/A

777168,A2HRVE5MUWP0PN,B0000D9PME,"Ken Pierce ""Editor, PiercingMetal.com""","[10, 10]","I have enjoyed the music of Gary Moore for several years, but being in the States he seldom makes his way over here.  Since this was the case, I was glad to see the release of a DVD filmed at this years ""Monsters Of Rock"" tour.  This piece was filmed as part of Gary touring for his ""Scars"" album.  Joining him in the band is Cass Lewis on bass, and Darrin Mahoney on drums.  Fans might be interested in the fact that Gary seems to have stepped back into his roots of Rock once again.  He took some time off and became a blues man (and while it was done quite well), I still like to see him kicking some serious ass on the strings.  He has not lost any of his skill at this medium.This DVD is essentially a straight ahead concert from beginning to end.  The only additional footage is several minutes of sound-check and some backstage interview footage.  These two portions serve as the Bonus Features, making that aspect somewhat lacking.  Given the scope of Gary Moore's back catalog, Sanctuary should have included a couple of videos, or perhaps even some vintage footage from other ""Monsters Of Rock"" festivals.  Gary Moore has been a steady performer at this festival, so the footage has to be out there and this is what fans will want to see.The DVD moves quite quickly also.  I found this not only because of its 63 minute length but because the songs flow so smoothly.  It was over before I knew it, so I let it run again to just listen to the songs.  I am guessing the shortness of its length was because Gary was on the opening spot during this tour for Whitesnake.  63 minutes seems like a normal running time for a pre-headliner goes onstage.  The songs are listed below for the reader, I was surprised to see two of my favorites excluded (""I'm Always Gonna Love You"", and ""Victims Of The Future"".Song Listing:Shapes Of Things To Come, Wishing Well, Rectify, Guitar Intro, Stand Up, Just Can't Let You Go, Walking By Myself, Don't Believe A Word, Out In The Fields, Parisienne Walkways.While I have the aforementioned criticisms I did enjoy this DVD quite a bit.  As a matter of fact, I say all fans should go out and grab this since it is like being at the show.

I think the idea of just a basic rock band, with guitar, bass and drums was a good idea, but Gary's mates who are playing bass and drums simply don't care! They are playing like if they were not interested with the show, showing no guts, no energy, no vibe. Maybe they're reflecting the audience's lack of interest.  I was shocked by this. They are playing alongside one of the most underrated guitarrists of all time, and apparently don't give a dim about that...Also, Gary's performance is very uneven, maybe because his carrer was always a little bit unfocused and irregular, so the set lilst is a shamble.Gary's physical apperance is also disturbing, but this is not the important thing. He is playing his white guitar apparently in unusual manner, like he, also, don't care about the gig.
