1423711,A3DFI6J9S1WBED,B004PQBYVE,G. B. Brown,"[14, 16]","Violet Tendencies is not without its charms.  Mindy Cohn's portrayal of the 40 year old fag hag is spot on; she's funny, outrageous, exuberant, irrepressibly bawdy.  Watching cheerfully she describe FUPA (you'll have to watch the movie to find out!) to her date, then her understated reaction to his response sums up her character.  Cohn's facial expressions are priceless, her acting a sheer pleasure to watch.  There are some nice scenes with her gay friends - including a failed intervention (""something's about to go down and I need to warn you"").  Violet's interactions with her beautiful coworker end up being an odd non-starter after a very funny early scene in a restaurant.The rest of the film takes itself a little too seriously.  The coupling and nesting and uncoupling of the gay couples feels forced.All in all, Violet Tendencies was charming enough but a little less than I'd hoped for.",3,I wanted to like it more than I actually liked it,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,900,"['Violet', 'Tendencies', 'not', 'charms', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'portrayal', '40', 'year', 'old', 'fag', 'hag', 'spot', 'funny', 'outrageous', 'exuberant', 'irrepressibly', 'bawdy', 'Watching', 'cheerfully', 'FUPA', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'date', 'then', 'understated', 'reaction', 'response', 'up', 'character', 'Cohn', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'priceless', 'acting', 'sheer', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'are', 'nice', 'scenes', 'gay', 'friends', 'including', 'failed', 'intervention', 'something', 'go', 'down', 'need', 'warn', 'Violet', 'interactions', 'beautiful', 'coworker', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'odd', 'non-starter', 'very', 'funny', 'early', 'scene', 'restaurant.The', 'rest', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'coupling', 'nesting', 'uncoupling', 'gay', 'feels', 'forced.All', 'Violet', 'Tendencies', 'was', 'charming', 'enough', 'little', 'less', ""'d"", 'hoped']",N/A
1423712,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B004PQBYVE,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[0, 3]","The plot and the movie's outcome of this made in Canada movie ""Violet Tendencies"" is so obvious that no thinking is required in this film.  I knew the plot and its conclusion after the first few minutes and after the characters and their problem were established.  The main character is Violet (played by Mindy Cohen of the old TV series ""Facts of Life"") who is a very  serious ""Fag Hag"" that has reached the age of forty (40) and is  tired of seeing her gay male friends pairing up and having relationships.  She only has gay male friends and lives her life through them.  At ""middle age"" she wants a ""real"" man of her own with a man that she can wake up with.  After many attempts and much advice on how to land someone interested in her and not her gay friends,  she accepts the fact that she is really happy and fulfilled as she is.It seems that I have seen the main plot and subplots of this movie so many times before.  There are no surprising twists or turns to this movie.  Be advised that this film is purported to be in New York city--the city scenes are far too clean appearing;I think it was filmed in a Canadian city.",2,No thinking required,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",2011,1130,"['plot', 'movie', 'outcome', 'made', 'Canada', 'movie', 'Violet', 'Tendencies', 'so', 'obvious', 'thinking', 'required', 'film', 'knew', 'plot', 'conclusion', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'characters', 'problem', 'were', 'established', 'main', 'character', 'Violet', 'played', 'Mindy', 'Cohen', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'Facts', 'Life', 'who', 'very', 'serious', 'Fag', 'Hag', 'reached', 'age', 'forty', '40', 'tired', 'seeing', 'gay', 'male', 'friends', 'pairing', 'up', 'having', 'relationships', 'only', 'gay', 'male', 'friends', 'life', 'middle', 'age', 'real', 'man', 'own', 'man', 'can', 'wake', 'up', 'many', 'attempts', 'much', 'advice', 'how', 'land', 'someone', 'interested', 'not', 'gay', 'friends', 'fact', 'really', 'happy', 'fulfilled', 'have', 'seen', 'main', 'plot', 'subplots', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'are', 'surprising', 'twists', 'movie', 'Be', 'advised', 'film', 'purported', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'city', 'scenes', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'clean', 'appearing', 'think', 'was', 'filmed', 'Canadian', 'city']",N/A
