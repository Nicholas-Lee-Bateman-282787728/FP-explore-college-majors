It is one of the best films of it's time. I got a kick out of the way Sean Connery said &#34;Adversary&#34; though. Listen for it. It's hilarious. Mel Gibson made fun of it in his movie &#34;What Women Want&#34;. This is the last film that Alec Baldwin made that he was dashing. Since then he's sort of ballooned out. Sam Neill's lines about raising sheep in Montana is memorable as well, although a little naive. Sort of a reflection of the lack of understanding that Russians had of America at that time.",4,Good rendering,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,606,"['do', ""n't"", 'regard', '34', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', '34', 'as', 'highly', 'do', '34', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', '34', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'got', 'kick', 'way', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'said', '34', 'Adversary', '34', 'Listen', 'hilarious', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'made', 'fun', 'movie', '34', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', '34', 'last', 'film', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'made', 'was', 'dashing', 'then', 'sort', 'ballooned', 'out', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'lines', 'raising', 'sheep', 'Montana', 'memorable', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'naive', 'Sort', 'reflection', 'lack', 'understanding', 'Russians', 'had', 'America', 'time']",N/A

1410804,A7Y6AVS576M03,B004IK30M8,gobirds2,"[2, 2]","Interesting to see THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and THE SUM OF ALL FEARS together. A good comparison of Jack Ryan's portrayals. THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Great score by Basil Poledouris. THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was somewhat a disappointment to me. I can forgo any complaints about the casting of the main character. The story is the culprit here or the truncation of the story near the finale. This is actually a very engrossing film until the final third. The film titillates the viewer tediously divulging events and characters constructing a complex framework of suspense, paranoia and intrigue that ultimately delivers a devastating situation to the world's two superpowers. It is amazing that the scriptwriter, the director or both did not know how to culminate all these events into a climax equal to the impressive filmmaking up to that point. Throughout this film the villains seemed to hold great power and influence and were in absolute control of events that they were manipulating. In the final third of the film the rug gets pulled out from under them and the rest of us. The escalation of the US/Soviet conflict almost seemed superficial and hurt the the film. However, Jerry Goldsmith's score seemed to pull out some thoughtful reflective reactions on the Soviet side during this phase of the film. In all, SUM OF ALL FEARS has a frightful scenario and the villains are not who you think. Interesting stuff. Also there were great performances from Liev Schreiber, Morgan Freeman, Michael Byrne and Philip Baker Hall.",5,A Good Comparison of Jack Ryan's Portrayals,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,3382,"['Interesting', 'see', 'THE', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'THE', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'together', 'good', 'comparison', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'portrayals', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'incredibly', 'minimalist', 'screenplay', 'expectations', 'film', 'strengths', 'are', 'characters', 'actors', 'portray', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Captain', 'Marko', 'Ramius', 'great', 'bravado', 'charisma', 'relying', 'greatly', 'mesmerizing', 'screen', 'presence', 'maneuver', 'entire', 'direction', 'film', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'amusing', 'dutiful', 'Dr.', 'Petrov', 'role', 'well', 'suited', 'rest', 'cast', 'out', 'histrionics', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'realistic', 'convincing', 'performances', 'bring', 'authenticity', 'realism', 'drama', 'film', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Greer', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Captain', 'Vasily', 'Borodin', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Commander', 'Bart', 'Mancuso', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Dr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Pelt', 'impressive', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'Political', 'Officer', 'Ivan', 'Putin', 'bring', 'needed', 'sense', 'pragmatism', 'collective', 'roles', 'bolster', 'dramatics', 'emotion', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'best', 'performances', 'truly', 'manner', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'Baldwin', 'perfectly', 'conveyed', 'analytical', 'mind', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'embodied', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'also', 'brilliant', 'dedicated', 'officer', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'perhaps', 'conflict', 'carrying', 'out', 'duties', 'full', 'extent', 'country', 'political', 'dictates', 'ambitions', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'wonderful', 'role', 'regard', 'flawlessly', 'liked', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'character', 'immensely', 'US', 'Commander', 'who', 'truly', 'rely', 'instincts', 'logical', 'interpretation', 'facts', 'events', 'face', 'what', 'put', 'list', 'performances', 'point', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'how', 'think', 'conduct', 'heart', 'film', 'Great', 'score', 'Basil', 'Poledouris', 'THE', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointment', 'can', 'forgo', 'complaints', 'casting', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'culprit', 'here', 'truncation', 'story', 'finale', 'actually', 'very', 'engrossing', 'film', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'viewer', 'tediously', 'divulging', 'events', 'characters', 'constructing', 'complex', 'framework', 'suspense', 'paranoia', 'intrigue', 'ultimately', 'devastating', 'situation', 'world', 'two', 'superpowers', 'amazing', 'scriptwriter', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'culminate', 'events', 'climax', 'equal', 'impressive', 'filmmaking', 'up', 'point', 'film', 'villains', 'seemed', 'hold', 'great', 'power', 'influence', 'were', 'absolute', 'control', 'events', 'were', 'manipulating', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'rug', 'pulled', 'out', 'rest', 'escalation', 'US/Soviet', 'conflict', 'almost', 'seemed', 'superficial', 'hurt', 'film', 'However', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score', 'seemed', 'pull', 'out', 'thoughtful', 'reflective', 'reactions', 'Soviet', 'side', 'phase', 'film', 'SUM', 'OF', 'ALL', 'FEARS', 'frightful', 'scenario', 'villains', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'think', 'Interesting', 'stuff', 'Also', 'were', 'great', 'performances', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Michael', 'Byrne', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall']",N/A
