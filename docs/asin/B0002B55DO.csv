We were having trouble getting him to understand what he was supposed to do on the potty- he'd just sit there. This video really helped! The songs are catchy and simple, so he could understand and even sing them himself, and relate to what was happening. It also uses mostly older kids, which he liked, because he was interested in being a ""big kid.""In all, this is a video to use if you have a child who is over 3 and still not using the potty. You may get the songs stuck in your head. When we first watched it, we were worried that it seemed more geared to girls than boys, but my sons both love it. The over-acting actually works well for the kids, too, and will make you giggle.We love it, even watching it 3 times a day. :)",5,Absolutely Wonderful,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,858,"['have', 'autistic', '4-year-old', 'desperately', 'needed', 'be', 'potty', 'trained', 'order', 'get', 'inclusion', 'setting', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'potty-', ""'d"", 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'video', 'really', 'helped', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'simple', 'could', 'understand', 'even', 'sing', 'relate', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'also', 'mostly', 'older', 'kids', 'liked', 'was', 'interested', 'being', 'big', 'kid', 'video', 'use', 'have', 'child', 'who', '3', 'still', 'not', 'using', 'potty', 'may', 'get', 'songs', 'stuck', 'head', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'were', 'worried', 'seemed', 'more', 'geared', 'girls', 'boys', 'sons', 'love', 'over-acting', 'actually', 'well', 'kids', 'too', 'will', 'make', 'giggle.We', 'love', 'even', 'watching', '3', 'times', 'day']",Potty Power - For Boys & Girls
