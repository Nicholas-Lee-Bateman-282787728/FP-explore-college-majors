There are precious few comic book-BASED movies that can stay true to the original storyline and retain a quality movie.  This was one of them (the Original Michael Keaton-starring Batman was good too).The opening scenes of X2 were gripping as they introduced you to Kurt Wagner, the Nightcrawler.  He's got the mutant power to &quot;bampf&quot; or teleport into a cloud of smoke.  Beyond that, just watch the opening scene... It's great.The story for X2 is loosely based on the Graphic Novel, God Loves, Man Kills.  I'm not completely familiar with the novel, so I can't argue how true to the story the movie was, but I liked the way that this was done.  It introduced &quot;new&quot; mutants to people in certain scenes, and dropped hints towards future people who will be in movies.It was good for the average watcher too, as the original X-men movie went into the introductions to characters, while this one was more story driven.I can't rave enough about the quality of this movie, especially after the disappointing &quot;Daredevil&quot; movie and somewhat disappointing &quot;Spider-man&quot; movie (I don't like when a character's origin from the comic books is basically SLAUGHTERED).",5,FINALLY A COMIC BOOK MOVIE THAT FOLLOWS THROUGH!,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,1296,"[""'m"", 'picky', 'moviegoer', 'like', 'movies', ""'m"", 'also', 'picky', 'comic', 'book', 'reader', 'like', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'precious', 'few', 'comic', 'book-BASED', 'movies', 'can', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'storyline', 'retain', 'quality', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'Original', 'Michael', 'Keaton-starring', 'Batman', 'was', 'good', 'too', '.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'X2', 'were', 'gripping', 'introduced', 'Kurt', 'Wagner', 'Nightcrawler', 'got', 'mutant', 'power', 'quot', 'quot', 'teleport', 'cloud', 'smoke', 'Beyond', 'just', 'watch', 'opening', 'scene', 'great.The', 'story', 'X2', 'loosely', 'based', 'Graphic', 'Novel', 'God', 'Loves', 'Man', 'Kills', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'familiar', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'how', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'liked', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'introduced', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'mutants', 'people', 'certain', 'scenes', 'dropped', 'hints', 'future', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'movies.It', 'was', 'good', 'average', 'watcher', 'too', 'original', 'X-men', 'movie', 'went', 'introductions', 'characters', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'story', 'driven.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rave', 'enough', 'quality', 'movie', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'quot', 'Daredevil', 'quot', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'quot', 'Spider-man', 'quot', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'character', 'origin', 'comic', 'books', 'basically', 'SLAUGHTERED']",N/A

771122,A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F,B0000BWVCJ,Ahmed,"[5, 7]","X2: the X-men United was excellent. It is definitely one of the best movies of 2003! The special effects were cool and it&#65533;s really hard not to like this. This action packed sequel is one of the best sequels I&#65533;ve ever seen. It&#65533;ll probably top the long list of sequels that are being released this year. The special effects were the most fascinating thing in this movie. There is also more character development. The story is great, the cast ensemble is perfect, and the special effects are visually stunning. The movie is inspiring, thought-provoking, funny. Most of the cast from the 2000 box-office hit returned. This includes the Oscar-winning actresses Anne Paquin (Rogue) and Halle Berry (Storm). Mystique is chubbier, Storm got a haircut, Famke Janssen got a trim, and Wolverine has a female version of him so yes, a lot has changed. Night crawler (Alan Cumming) is quite annoying but I like Kelly Hu. She makes a great female Wolverine! There are several memorable scenes in this sequel and the movie has all the charm that great movies need. The X-men movie franchise is in my opinion the best comic book to movie franchise ever. The movie gets quite crazy but it remains on the topic. It&#65533;s the most expensive movie ever made in Canada! It&#65533;s the most rambling superhero saga to date!It has everything that an excellent movie needs. It has a story, a theme, cinematography, a good score, a great cast, and impressive special effects (something that big destruction movies really need). This time the movie is funnier and it&#65533;s as fictional as a movie can get. It really concentrated on it&#65533;s fantasy storyline.The story revolves around the X-men, the good mutant group that consists of mutants, each born with a distinctive genetic mutation, which manifested itself astonishing powers. They live in a world that fears them but the X-men protect the people. They are Magneto&#65533;s enemies. Magneto is the leader of the evil mutant group but is in a plastic prison at the moment. He escapes. In the meantime Wolverine travels across Canada in search of his whereabouts and meets a &#65533;female&#65533; Wolverine (played by Kelly Hu) and this continues the tradition of the fascinating kung fu moves in the X-men movies (The Mystique-Wolverine fight in X-men marked the beginning of it). The X-men face their most dangerous mission yet. They have to combat against their enemies, Magneto&#65533;s gang, that threatens people and mutants too.Overall it&#65533;s a thunderous, explosive, dazzling sensory overload that takes us into its world for over two hours but leaves us rather unchanged by the experience. Bryan Singer is such a good director that it makes you see why it&#65533;s important to have a director who was once the comic-book&#65533;s fan, direct the movie (same thing happened with Spiderman). The frustrations are without difficulty overshadowed by the fine look of the motion picture.",5,The long awaited sequel was worth the wait!,1051833600,"05 2, 2003",2003,2958,"['X2', 'X-men', 'United', 'was', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2003', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'cool', '65533', 's', 'really', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'action', 'packed', 'sequel', 'one', 'best', 'sequels', '65533', 've', 'ever', 'seen', '65533', 'll', 'probably', 'top', 'long', 'list', 'sequels', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'year', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'most', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'movie', 'also', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'perfect', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'visually', 'stunning', 'movie', 'inspiring', 'thought-provoking', 'funny', 'Most', 'cast', '2000', 'box-office', 'hit', 'returned', 'Oscar-winning', 'actresses', 'Anne', 'Paquin', 'Rogue', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', 'Mystique', 'chubbier', 'Storm', 'got', 'haircut', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'got', 'trim', 'Wolverine', 'female', 'version', 'so', 'yes', 'lot', 'changed', 'Night', 'crawler', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'quite', 'annoying', 'like', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'great', 'female', 'Wolverine', 'are', 'several', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'sequel', 'movie', 'charm', 'great', 'movies', 'need', 'X-men', 'movie', 'franchise', 'opinion', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'franchise', 'ever', 'movie', 'quite', 'crazy', 'topic', '65533', 's', 'most', 'expensive', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Canada', '65533', 's', 'most', 'rambling', 'superhero', 'saga', 'date', 'everything', 'excellent', 'movie', 'needs', 'story', 'theme', 'cinematography', 'good', 'score', 'great', 'cast', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'something', 'big', 'destruction', 'movies', 'really', 'need', 'time', 'movie', 'funnier', '65533', 'fictional', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'concentrated', '65533', 'fantasy', 'storyline.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'X-men', 'good', 'mutant', 'group', 'mutants', 'born', 'distinctive', 'genetic', 'mutation', 'manifested', 'astonishing', 'powers', 'live', 'world', 'X-men', 'protect', 'people', 'are', 'Magneto', '65533', 's', 'enemies', 'Magneto', 'leader', 'evil', 'mutant', 'group', 'plastic', 'prison', 'moment', 'meantime', 'Wolverine', 'Canada', 'search', 'whereabouts', '65533', 'female', '65533', 'Wolverine', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'tradition', 'fascinating', 'kung', 'fu', 'moves', 'X-men', 'movies', 'Mystique-Wolverine', 'fight', 'X-men', 'marked', 'beginning', 'X-men', 'face', 'most', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'yet', 'have', 'combat', 'enemies', 'Magneto', '65533', 's', 'gang', 'people', 'mutants', 'too.Overall', '65533', 's', 'thunderous', 'explosive', 'dazzling', 'sensory', 'overload', 'world', 'two', 'hours', 'rather', 'unchanged', 'experience', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'such', 'good', 'director', 'see', 'why', '65533', 's', 'important', 'have', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'comic-book', '65533', 's', 'fan', 'direct', 'movie', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Spiderman', 'frustrations', 'are', 'difficulty', 'overshadowed', 'fine', 'look', 'motion', 'picture']",N/A

Not that the original was in any ways bad, but it more rushed and didn't get a chance to spend time on a lot of the other characters.Here they did what they obviously wished they had the time and budget for in the first movie.More of the Mutants were showcased.  Though it was still centered on Professor X and Wolverine, it brought a bunch the other characters into the side stage.  To name a few; Iceman, Pyro, Kitty Pride, Collosus, Banshee, Nightcrawler, etc....  Plus they gave more screen time to the sultry butt kicker Mystique, whom was given a bit more depth.The bad guys were again, interesting and possessed depth.  Stryker the driven war vetran that is seemingly obsessed with controlling all mutants.  The reasons why he was given the authority to do what he did and how it was carried out was frefreashing, and believable.  Notice the president was more concerned about how it would look the to public than on any sort of personal morality.  Magneto appeared again as the classic anti-hero, still focusing on his own agenda's.The action sequences were longer and more brutal.  Did you notice that the only person that you see die in the first one was the senator.  True you see Toad get shocked and seem like he dies, but he is a mutant and a rather enjoyable bad guy, who knows.  Sabretooth seemed to die, but in the comics he has survived many seemingly critical wounds, and survived.  This includes having his spine broken, so he could very well show again.  This movie wolverine has an actual body count and goes through special ops like they were children.  What would you expect from a barely under control psychopath with unbreakable bones and claws.All in all this was a great movie, still had some elements that were a bit hard to grasp, but it was a comic book movie and a sci fi, that is part of the game.  It treats the characters and situations with dignity and makes you care about what is going on, for good and bad guys.rent or buy this if you like sci fi or plain and simple action movies, you won't be disappointed.",5,Will please even non sci fi fans.,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,2116,"['was', 'unusual', 'sequel', 'surpassed', 'original', 'many', 'ways', 'Not', 'original', 'was', 'ways', 'bad', 'more', 'rushed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'spend', 'time', 'lot', 'other', 'characters.Here', 'did', 'what', 'obviously', 'wished', 'had', 'time', 'budget', 'first', 'movie.More', 'Mutants', 'were', 'showcased', 'was', 'still', 'centered', 'Professor', 'X', 'Wolverine', 'brought', 'bunch', 'other', 'characters', 'side', 'stage', 'name', 'few', 'Iceman', 'Pyro', 'Kitty', 'Pride', 'Collosus', 'Banshee', 'Nightcrawler', 'etc', 'gave', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'sultry', 'butt', 'kicker', 'Mystique', 'whom', 'was', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'depth.The', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'again', 'interesting', 'possessed', 'depth', 'Stryker', 'driven', 'war', 'vetran', 'seemingly', 'obsessed', 'controlling', 'mutants', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', 'given', 'authority', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'how', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'was', 'frefreashing', 'believable', 'Notice', 'president', 'was', 'more', 'concerned', 'how', 'would', 'look', 'public', 'sort', 'personal', 'morality', 'Magneto', 'appeared', 'again', 'classic', 'anti-hero', 'still', 'focusing', 'own', ""agenda's.The"", 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'longer', 'more', 'brutal', 'Did', 'notice', 'only', 'person', 'see', 'die', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'senator', 'True', 'see', 'Toad', 'get', 'shocked', 'seem', 'mutant', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'Sabretooth', 'seemed', 'die', 'comics', 'survived', 'many', 'seemingly', 'critical', 'wounds', 'survived', 'having', 'spine', 'broken', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'show', 'again', 'movie', 'wolverine', 'actual', 'body', 'count', 'special', 'ops', 'were', 'children', 'What', 'would', 'expect', 'barely', 'control', 'psychopath', 'unbreakable', 'bones', 'claws.All', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'still', 'had', 'elements', 'were', 'bit', 'hard', 'grasp', 'was', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'sci', 'fi', 'part', 'game', 'characters', 'situations', 'dignity', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'good', 'bad', 'guys.rent', 'buy', 'like', 'sci', 'fi', 'plain', 'simple', 'action', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

""Inspiring Mind""","[0, 1]","I'll say this...the sequel DOES make a few improvements on the original and thus doesn't fall victim to the stereotypes about sequels.  It also doesn't come to THE END; so I was sure to be awaiting number three(potentially good selling point as long as there is a three).  Being not a die-hard fan but a avid observer of such a diverse group of characters working together in a set/pre-designed world, I DID find certain changes to what I knew somewhat unsettling.  I also realized that had I not known what I did(and this is advice to those who are informing others who aren't familiar with the comics/cartoons: DON'T inform them; let them see the movies uninformed as I went to see the Lord of the Rings films unread.), I probably would have enjoyed the movies better.  Best regards go to those who sold the first movie: Hugh Jackman(wolverine), Patrick Stewart(professor X), Famke Janssen(jean grey)(who looked much better/closer to how Jean appears at the time though her part here seemed subdued) and Ian Mckellan(magneto).  I just hope Miss Storm doesn't walk out or make things difficult. Her part was fine, and she just needs to stay cool and get a better wig:P(the somewhat short hair seems unauthentic).  I'd also like to see Juggernaut and the origin of Rogue's ""evolved capabilities""(and perhaps her birth origin if that doesn't become too difficult) worked into the next film(rather than tell Storm's story which doesn't necessarily relate to the next phase as it seems to be playing out.).",4,You almost had me at Cerebro.

As such, I was expecting X-2 to be equally disappointing, if not more so. Boy, am I glad to be wrong!X-2 is what the first movie should have been like (ie closer to the comic). We are forever stuck with the problems of the characters such as Kitty Pryde's character being put in Rogue's body so that in fact we get neither character, Iceman being a student of the school when in fact he is one of the original X-Men, Pyro taking up screen time when he was never part of the X-men (and a stupid character anyway)... I could go on.X-2 also continues the flaw of the first film in that the X-Men are nothing more than few characters with some odd powers they barely control when they should be a fully functioning team with absolute control over their powers. What separates the X-Men from every other mutant is their comraderie and intense training. In the comics, they are powerful, saving the world many times over. In the movies we are constantly seeing them get their butts kicked because they have to stop and concentrate before using any powers. This has improved however. Nightcrawler for instance is one bad mofo who is very close to what he should be. Jean-Grey discovers her powers are increasing (appearantly after the events of the first film) and by the end, she is how she should have been all along. Fans of Wolverine will get to see him actually be Wolverine for once.X-2 succeeds partially because it doesn't attempt to give you some goofed up ""starting-out"" story like the first film. It plays like an issue of the comics; you pick an issue up, the action is already flowing, and you have to catch up. From the very opening scene of the movie, you know this is a different film than the first. Every super powered character in the film just seems to be more awe inspiring, capturing the magic of comic book heroes (for the most part).This film sees an even bigger threat to the world than the first film. The previews make it seem to be a threat to the school and about Wolverine's past, when in fact those are really only small parts of it. It's better if you don't know the plot, as I didn't. The finale is ripped out of one of the most dramatic events in X-Men history, and for the fans that recognize it, there is a nice teaser at the very end that makes me think the best is yet to come!If you liked the first X-Men movie, you really should see X-2. It's going to go down in history as one of the few sequels that's actually better than the original (by a good margin I should add). There's more action, more characterization, more FX, and most importantly more story. It's still not as good as it could have been, but considering how lacking the first film was, it's good enough!",4,Better than the first!,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,2812,"['was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'weak', 'plot', 'horrible', 'treatment', 'characters', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'such', 'was', 'expecting', 'X-2', 'be', 'equally', 'disappointing', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'Boy', 'am', 'glad', 'be', 'wrong', 'X-2', 'what', 'first', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ie', 'closer', 'comic', 'are', 'forever', 'stuck', 'problems', 'characters', 'such', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'character', 'being', 'put', 'Rogue', 'body', 'so', 'fact', 'get', 'character', 'Iceman', 'being', 'student', 'school', 'when', 'fact', 'one', 'original', 'X-Men', 'Pyro', 'taking', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'never', 'part', 'X-men', 'stupid', 'character', 'anyway', 'could', 'go', 'on.X-2', 'also', 'flaw', 'first', 'film', 'X-Men', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'few', 'characters', 'odd', 'powers', 'barely', 'control', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'fully', 'functioning', 'team', 'absolute', 'control', 'powers', 'What', 'X-Men', 'other', 'mutant', 'comraderie', 'intense', 'training', 'comics', 'are', 'powerful', 'saving', 'world', 'many', 'times', 'movies', 'are', 'constantly', 'seeing', 'get', 'butts', 'kicked', 'have', 'stop', 'concentrate', 'using', 'powers', 'improved', 'however', 'Nightcrawler', 'instance', 'one', 'bad', 'mofo', 'who', 'very', 'close', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Jean-Grey', 'discovers', 'powers', 'are', 'increasing', 'appearantly', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'end', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'along', 'Fans', 'Wolverine', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'actually', 'be', 'Wolverine', 'once.X-2', 'partially', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'give', 'goofed', 'up', 'starting-out', 'story', 'first', 'film', 'issue', 'comics', 'pick', 'issue', 'up', 'action', 'already', 'flowing', 'have', 'catch', 'up', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'know', 'different', 'film', 'first', 'super', 'powered', 'character', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'more', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'capturing', 'magic', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'most', 'part', '.This', 'film', 'even', 'bigger', 'threat', 'world', 'first', 'film', 'previews', 'make', 'seem', 'be', 'threat', 'school', 'Wolverine', 'past', 'when', 'fact', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'small', 'parts', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'finale', 'ripped', 'one', 'most', 'dramatic', 'events', 'X-Men', 'history', 'fans', 'recognize', 'nice', 'teaser', 'very', 'end', 'think', 'best', 'yet', 'come', 'liked', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'X-2', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'few', 'sequels', 'actually', 'better', 'original', 'good', 'margin', 'should', 'add', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'characterization', 'more', 'FX', 'most', 'importantly', 'more', 'story', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'considering', 'how', 'lacking', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'enough']",N/A

Yeah, Spiderman is good and all, but there's just something about X-Men that I find more interesting-- maybe because everyone can find something to relate to in an X-Men character. And I like that there's more than one hero and that the bad guy is a mutant, yet unlike the mutant heroes.This is the second installment, the third is on the way (can't wait!) and we re-join the mutants at ""Mutant High,"" which is also the secret base of the elite X-Men. The film begins with an action scene, one of the best I've ever seen, in which a mutant teleporter attempts to kill the President as a protest against the anti-mutant sentiment that has swept the nation. Jean and Storm are sent by Xavier, the leader of the X-Men, to track down the teleporter, who was actually forced to attack the President by a man named Stryker, a non-mutant who has developed a mind-controlling serum and also has a great dislike for mutants and hoped his attack would force the government to get rid of the mutants.Great film, lots of cool action scenes, and some of the holes of the first film are finally filled in, getting more information about Wolverine. You don't have to like comics to like this movie, just have a like for action or a like for a good story. This movie has both. This movie isn't quite as comic bookey as Spiderman 2 was actually.

This movie was a tremendous follow-up to the first film, and (for me at least) surpassed it in nearly all aspects.  First of all, the characters from the first film are very nicely developed, especially those of Wolverine and Rogue.  Second, many mutants with small parts in the first one and even more who never made appearances at all are now part of the team, and get in on the action.  And finally, the action sequences, special effects, and storyline are absolutely amazing!Nightcrawler, Colossus, Iceman--these are all familiar X-men to many, yet they had no role (or insignificant in Iceman's case) in the first film.  It was great to see the action with these and other new mutants.  Also, Wolverine's past is more fully explored, and the relationship between Magneto and Xavier is also developed (the fact that they have to work together, to some extent, to defeat a common enemy shows that they really are two men with the same purpose, but a different way of accomplishing their goals).  I was very impressed with the twists and turns taken in the relationships of the characters, and the development of the X-man saga.The special effects for this film were absolutely breathtaking, as were the action sequences.  The film opens with a spectacular display by Nightcrawler, and is soon followed up by a berserker rage by Wolverine.  There are several great sequences in the film, and the sight of each mutant using his or her powers (Magneto breaking out of his cell comes to mind) makes you want to stand up and cheer.With the colossal success of these movies and the Spider-Man film, Marvel movies seem to be riding high.  I would love to see a movie involving both Spidey and the X-men, but that's not likely to happen any time soon.

It has action, a message, and a story line that does its best not to insult movie goer's intellegence.The film starts shortly after the battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood that ended the first film. There has been an attempt on the life of the President of the United States by a strange mutant who teleports. The mutant is the Amazing Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) and he is seemingly under someone's control. The person in control is William Stryker (Brian Cox) who adds another layer to the already complex mix of characters. Stryker is a human who wants to eliminate the mutants and is not above kidnapping Xavier to do it.This film has elements of action, revenge, comedy and even an unresolved love triange. It's impossible to go into much detail without destroying the fun. This is one of the few big budget blockbusters that should be seen. It's a great second feature in a developing franchise that promises much more in the future.The disc that I viewed included two commentary tracks: one with Singer and cinematographer Tom Sigel; the second with the producers and writers. Both tracks were informative and aid greatly in ones understanding both of the comic universe created and the production in particular.

That being said, there are spoilers ahead, so if you don't want to know, stop reading now.So what does X2 offer us? A look into the world of the X-Men that's even more in depth than the first one. Opening shortly where the first film left off, Wolverine returns to the mansion (with Cyclop's bike) with mutant hatred at an all time high after an attempt on the President's life by Nightcrawler.With Jean and Storm tracing the renegade mutant, and Cyclops and Xavier heading out to find out what connection, if any, Magneto had, Logan finds himself babysitting the kids in the mansion.Little do they know the whole event was orchestrated by William Stryker, a man who hates mutants. And with the Mansion unguarded, Stryker takes Xavier prisoner and launches an all out war on the Xavier Institute.We finally get to see Wolverine cut loose, and he leaves bodies all over the place this time out.Mystique, in the meanwhile, aids Magneto in his escape from the plastic prison we last saw him in, in a scene that highlights the use of his powers in a beautifully composed scene.Recognizing a common threat, Magneto and the X-Men join forces to stop Stryker, in the meanwhile, learning more about the origins of Wolverine, and witnessing Jean Grey's powers rising in scope and effect (a prelude of things to come, if you've read the books).Jean sacrifices herself to save the others, and the movie ends with a scene reminiscent of another sci-fi which I will not name, but I will say that it was also the second in its series.All in all, a perfect comic book film, faithful not only to the source material, but also to the details from the first film in the series, with no continuity errors that I could find.",5,"Sometimes, you have to have faith...",1051833600,"05 2, 2003",2003,1763,"['just', 'saw', 'X2', 'theater', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'stop', 'reading', 'what', 'X2', 'offer', 'look', 'world', 'X-Men', 'even', 'more', 'depth', 'first', 'one', 'Opening', 'shortly', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'Wolverine', 'mansion', 'Cyclop', 'bike', 'mutant', 'hatred', 'time', 'high', 'attempt', 'President', 'life', 'Nightcrawler.With', 'Jean', 'Storm', 'tracing', 'renegade', 'mutant', 'Cyclops', 'Xavier', 'heading', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'connection', 'Magneto', 'had', 'Logan', 'babysitting', 'kids', 'mansion.Little', 'do', 'know', 'whole', 'event', 'was', 'orchestrated', 'William', 'Stryker', 'man', 'who', 'mutants', 'Mansion', 'unguarded', 'Stryker', 'Xavier', 'prisoner', 'out', 'war', 'Xavier', 'Institute.We', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Wolverine', 'cut', 'loose', 'bodies', 'place', 'time', 'out.Mystique', 'meanwhile', 'aids', 'Magneto', 'escape', 'plastic', 'prison', 'last', 'saw', 'scene', 'use', 'powers', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'scene.Recognizing', 'common', 'threat', 'Magneto', 'X-Men', 'join', 'forces', 'stop', 'Stryker', 'meanwhile', 'learning', 'more', 'origins', 'Wolverine', 'witnessing', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'powers', 'rising', 'scope', 'effect', 'prelude', 'things', 'come', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', '.Jean', 'sacrifices', 'save', 'others', 'movie', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'sci-fi', 'will', 'not', 'name', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'also', 'second', 'series.All', 'perfect', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'faithful', 'not', 'only', 'source', 'material', 'also', 'details', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'continuity', 'could', 'find']",N/A

""X2"" ups the antie with greater special effects, more mutants, and a far darker atmosphere.  Hugh Jackman was excellent in his portrayal of Wolverine, with a greater resemblence to his comic-book counterpart than in the first movie, particularly with his famous berserker-rage.  The cameo of Collossus was the most exciting in the movie; too bad he wasn't in there longer.  Other than a few subtle inaccuracies (Collossus wasn't Russian, Pyro wasn't Australian, etc.) the movie was flawless in continuing where the first left off.  The tie-in with Jean's struggling with the phoenix force was a nice addition as well, paying homage to perhaps the greatest storyline in X-Men history (too bad they weren't in outer space when it happened).

771162,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B0000BWVCJ,casualsuede,"[4, 5]","The first one was better because it was something we had never seen before. Having read the comic books, I wondered if Hugh Jackman was a good choice to play the hardened Wolverine or if Halle Berry would make a good Storm.So the sequel is supposed to be bigger and better in it's action sequences because we have the background story as well, but it is not necessarily so in this movie. There is alot of action, but much of it is of the generic type. The fight between Mystique and Wolverine was much better than the one between Deathstrike and Wolverine (in this one the action was so cut and jerky that I couldn't see clearly half the time). I was not impressed with most of the characters and a few of them took a step backwards in this movie.The characters of Cyclops and Storm are key examples. It is hard to make Halle Berry asexual and unexciting, but Director Bryan Singer made it so. Cyclops comes off as a semi-gay, nsync fan who is the fall guy for the blossoming Wolverine/Jean Grey relationship. Other characters whose motivation is a mystery is Pyro. He's a jerk but for him to run off with Magneto and Mystique doesn't make sense.Another character that is weakened from the original movie is Rogue. In the first movie, she (played by the highly capable Anna Paquin) has a teen angst spin that was mildly interesting, but in this one she turns into a helpless, sniveling whiner who only is interested in getting it on with Iceman. However, they decide to expand the role of Iceman and he becomes more of a 3D character.Not all is lost though, Jean Grey is always interesting and fascinating and is played with appeal by Famke Janssen (even if she develops mysterious powers without explanation like Evy O'Connell from the ""Mummy Returns""). She is by far the most facinating character in this movie.Not far behind is the new character ""Nightcrawler"", played by Alan Cumming. However, Singer does not spend enough time fleshing out the character and by the end of the movie, all we know is that he is German, was from a freakshow, has angelic carvings on his body and is very religious. They need to expand his role in X3.Rebecca Romaine-Stamos returns as the seductive (yet repulsive) Mystique. She is the fire of the group and is not afraid to show her emotions through the movie. Wolverine should be as upfront as she is.Overall, the feel of this movie is not different from a James Bond movie. There are the big set pieces, the mad conqueror, characters with interesting names and the world domination plot. It is not original, or even as good as the first movie and I'm sure that non followers will be stumped by the Phoenix plot of X3.....Rating: C-",2,Not as good as the first one,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,2668,"['first', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Having', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'wondered', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'play', 'hardened', 'Wolverine', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'Storm.So', 'sequel', 'supposed', 'be', 'bigger', 'better', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'background', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'necessarily', 'so', 'movie', 'alot', 'action', 'much', 'generic', 'type', 'fight', 'Mystique', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'Deathstrike', 'Wolverine', 'one', 'action', 'was', 'so', 'cut', 'jerky', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'clearly', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'most', 'characters', 'few', 'took', 'step', 'backwards', 'movie.The', 'characters', 'Cyclops', 'Storm', 'are', 'key', 'examples', 'hard', 'make', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'asexual', 'unexciting', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'made', 'so', 'Cyclops', 'off', 'semi-gay', 'nsync', 'fan', 'who', 'fall', 'guy', 'blossoming', 'Wolverine/Jean', 'Grey', 'relationship', 'Other', 'characters', 'motivation', 'mystery', 'Pyro', 'jerk', 'run', 'off', 'Magneto', 'Mystique', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.Another', 'character', 'weakened', 'original', 'movie', 'Rogue', 'first', 'movie', 'played', 'highly', 'capable', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'teen', 'angst', 'spin', 'was', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'one', 'helpless', 'sniveling', 'whiner', 'who', 'only', 'interested', 'getting', 'Iceman', 'However', 'decide', 'expand', 'role', 'Iceman', 'more', '3D', 'character.Not', 'lost', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'always', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'played', 'appeal', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'even', 'mysterious', 'powers', 'explanation', 'Evy', ""O'Connell"", 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'far', 'most', 'facinating', 'character', 'movie.Not', 'far', 'new', 'character', 'Nightcrawler', 'played', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'However', 'Singer', 'not', 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'end', 'movie', 'know', 'German', 'was', 'freakshow', 'angelic', 'carvings', 'body', 'very', 'religious', 'need', 'expand', 'role', 'X3.Rebecca', 'Romaine-Stamos', 'returns', 'seductive', 'yet', 'repulsive', 'Mystique', 'fire', 'group', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'emotions', 'movie', 'Wolverine', 'should', 'be', 'as', 'upfront', 'feel', 'movie', 'not', 'different', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'are', 'big', 'set', 'pieces', 'mad', 'conqueror', 'characters', 'interesting', 'names', 'world', 'domination', 'plot', 'not', 'original', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'non', 'followers', 'will', 'be', 'stumped', 'Phoenix', 'plot', 'X3', '..Rating', 'C-']",N/A

Meanwhile, anti-mutant hysteria is mounting in Washington, fed by the sinister Southerner William Stryker, who has a secret agenda.

Meanwhile, Magneto's cohort Mystique arranges his escape from prison, and he seeks out Xavier's pupils, knowing that in order to save mutantkind from extermination they must find and rescue the Professor.I was delighted to see in this film the introduction of one of my favorite X-ers, Kurt Wagner/The Incredible Nightcrawler, a demonic-looking teleport (and devout Catholic).  There's also a brief view of someone whom I suspect is Colossus, the young Russian who can transform his body into steel.  The effects, of course, are fantastic, and the scenes in the beleaguered school and in Stryker's secret base under Alkali Lake (where Wolverine finally learns the truth about himself--or at least part of it) are non-stop thrill-a-minute action told with wonderful pace and careful attention to necessary exposition.  Magneto displays once again the flashes of decency that make him one of the most intriguing of Marvel villains.  And, of course, Xavier and his team are splendid.  This film has convinced me that I definitely want the X-Men to have shelf space in my DVD collection, and I'll be adding both it and its predecessor as soon as I can.",5,A superior sequel!,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,2280,"['still', 'good', 'bit', 'Wolverine', 'second', 'entry', 'franchise', 'X-2', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'also', 'chance', 'other', 'members', 'team', 'shine', 'join', 'Wolverine', 'Prof.', 'Xavier', 'school', 'fruitless', 'journey', 'Alkali', 'Lake', 'Alaska', 'where', 'believed', 'might', 'find', 'clues', 'how', 'became', 'what', 'Meanwhile', 'anti-mutant', 'hysteria', 'mounting', 'Washington', 'fed', 'sinister', 'Southerner', 'William', 'Stryker', 'who', 'secret', 'agenda', 'pursuit', 'imprisoned', 'Magneto', 'drugs', 'learns', 'Prof.', 'Xavier', 'supercomputer', 'Cerebro', 'Professor', 'can', 'literally', 'find', 'human', 'mind', 'world', 'even', 'billions', 'time', 'Stryker', 'Xavier', 'Cyclops', 'are', 'visiting', 'Magneto', 'prison', 'Special', 'Forces', 'detachment', 'invade', 'school', 'knowing', 'Storm', 'Jean', 'Gray', 'are', 'away', 'only', 'thing', 'most', 'students', 'capture', 'Wolvie', 'who', 'be', 'ferocious', 'fighter', 'defense', 'military', 'long', 'enough', 'bulk', 'escape', 'series', 'secret', 'tunnels', 'Meanwhile', 'Magneto', 'cohort', 'Mystique', 'escape', 'prison', 'out', 'Xavier', 'pupils', 'knowing', 'order', 'save', 'mutantkind', 'extermination', 'must', 'find', 'rescue', 'Professor.I', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'film', 'introduction', 'one', 'favorite', 'X-ers', 'Kurt', 'Wagner/The', 'Incredible', 'Nightcrawler', 'demonic-looking', 'teleport', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'also', 'brief', 'view', 'someone', 'whom', 'suspect', 'Colossus', 'young', 'Russian', 'who', 'can', 'transform', 'body', 'steel', 'effects', 'course', 'are', 'fantastic', 'scenes', 'beleaguered', 'school', 'Stryker', 'secret', 'base', 'Alkali', 'Lake', 'where', 'Wolverine', 'finally', 'truth', 'least', 'part', 'are', 'non-stop', 'thrill-a-minute', 'action', 'told', 'wonderful', 'pace', 'careful', 'attention', 'necessary', 'exposition', 'Magneto', 'once', 'again', 'flashes', 'decency', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'Marvel', 'villains', 'course', 'Xavier', 'team', 'are', 'splendid', 'film', 'convinced', 'definitely', 'want', 'X-Men', 'have', 'shelf', 'space', 'DVD', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'be', 'adding', 'predecessor', 'as', 'soon', 'can']",N/A

X2 is the complete formula for what a Summer Blockbuster should be all about!The movie is great! All of the original cast of X1 (except the deceased) returns in the sequel. Which was great to see, because if even one person was missing from the movie, this film would not have been as great. We also have some new characters in the group, both good and bad such as: Nightcrawler, Lady Deathstrike and Colossus just to name a few.With a bigger budget and a bigger cast, the FX of X2 is completely out there. As I said, the first 10 minutes of the movie is very intense and left me speechless. It was Awesome. I was also very impressed at the story of this second movie. Waiting 3 years, everyone has changed and are all evololving differently, from looks to powers. But, what really got to me was how strong and mature X2 is. The characters are equally put forward, which was good to see since this is a big cast with many things going on at once, everyone is well organised and is put on the screen equally (sometimes). But, overall X2 has everything I wanted that X1 didn't.X1 was more of an introduction for the audiences to get to know what these characters are dealing with in society (it also lacked a bit on the action). As for X2, it showed that, with way more punches to keep the audiences involved. Bryan Singer, directs the film, once again, with complete honesty and respect for each character and really empathises with them. He shows that he has a certain connetion with this movie and Is really trying to be faithful to the comic book series. Overall an Excellent Achivement. Good Work Bryan!The ending was very emotional and unexpected. The performances are great! With Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart being the best as always. Brian Cox is a great addition, to the talented cast, as the mean villain Stryker, ready to get revenge. Halle Berry, fresh from her Academy win, is showing off her best talent. So is Famke Jansen, James Marsden, Anna Pacquin and the incredible Hugh Jackman.Overall, X2 is a cool and fun film. While it is a more serious story that the first, it also has some major jokes to keep the audiences laughing.

We later find out that Nightcrawler's attack was orchestrated by Striker, the father of a mutant who he claims Xavier failed to help.  Striker has devloped a way to control the mutants to do whatever he wants.  His ultimate goal is to destroy all of the world's mutants.  As a result the mutants both &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; must join forces to save their kind.From the beginning to the end, this movie left me off the edge of my seat.  The storyline was done exceptionally as well as the special effects.  They never overshadowed the scene and were never over done.  The fight scenes were nothing short of spectacular.  I especially enjoyed the fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike even though it could have been a bit longer. Another action scene that stood out in my mind is Striker's planned attack on Xavier's school.  In this scene we got a chance to see the various abilities of Xavier's younger students as they fought back. We also got a chance to see Wolverine kick some major ass.The acting was suprisingly good all actors seemed to fit comformtably into the character roles and it never seemed like they were &quot;trying&quot; to be their character.While I really enjoyed the first X-Men, this one was much much better.  4 stars don't do this movie justice so I give it a 5.",5,"As good as the first one was, this was almost twice as good",1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,1491,"['expected', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'expected', 'be', 'good.The', 'movie', 'Nightcrawler', 'attacking', 'white', 'house', 'attempt', 'assinate', 'president', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Nightcrawler', 'attack', 'was', 'orchestrated', 'Striker', 'father', 'mutant', 'who', 'Xavier', 'failed', 'help', 'Striker', 'devloped', 'way', 'control', 'mutants', 'do', 'whatever', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'destroy', 'world', 'mutants', 'result', 'mutants', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'must', 'join', 'forces', 'save', 'kind.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'left', 'off', 'edge', 'seat', 'storyline', 'was', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'never', 'overshadowed', 'scene', 'were', 'never', 'done', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'fight', 'Wolverine', 'Deathstrike', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'longer', 'action', 'scene', 'stood', 'out', 'mind', 'Striker', 'planned', 'attack', 'Xavier', 'school', 'scene', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'various', 'abilities', 'Xavier', 'younger', 'students', 'fought', 'back', 'also', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'Wolverine', 'kick', 'major', 'ass.The', 'acting', 'was', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'actors', 'seemed', 'fit', 'comformtably', 'character', 'roles', 'never', 'seemed', 'were', 'quot', 'trying', 'quot', 'be', 'character.While', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'X-Men', 'one', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'better', '4', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'so', 'give', '5']",N/A

If you are a follower, then this movie is great. Once again, Wolverine makes this movie go and I'm glad most of the focus has been on him in the first two movies. His attitude and aggressiveness is frickin' awesome. He did however meet a mutant that was pretty much his equal.....almost. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. I will also say that the plot is pretty simplistic: Brian Cox plays a military officer by the name of William Striker bent on killing all of the mutants while Magnito and Xavier try to stop him...there's a lot of fighting and explosions throughout. Turns out that Striker and Wolverine have a past. I won't give too much of the movie away, so that's all I am going to reveal. My favorite characters are still Storm-because of Halle Berry of course, Wolverine, and Mystique...For once, Magnito and Mystique help the X-Men in their quest against Striker. All of the new characters just added to the experience and they were not overdone. Thank God. The Night Crawler was a little weird, but there wasn't too much emphasis placed on him which was a good thing. As I said before, most of the emphasis is placed on the original characters, while working the younger characters in slowly. Overall, I rate the experience an A. I would have rated it an A+, but the plot was a little weak. Who watches X-Men because of the plot anyway. You watch it because you love it and it's cool! If you love X-Men, this movie will not disappoint. If you're looking for some intellectual piece with an intricate plot, then look elsewhere. X-Men is cool and the action is awesome, and the special effects were well done. This is a sequel that was nicely done.

Tolley ""Chris Tolley""","[0, 1]","I have always enjoyed the X-Men comics, and the two feature films have done a fine job of following the spirit of the comics, if not the exact detail of the charactors and their stories. X2 is certainly one of the best comic adaptations ever put to film, due to the seriousness the actors and director obviously put into it. If they played it tongue-in-cheek, it would have been a disastor. All the roles are intelligently realized here, only a couple of beefs, though. The relationship between Rogue and Wolverine, so touching in the first film, is much more distant here. And what happened to Storm and Rogue's accents here? Storm being from Africa, and Rogue from Louisiana, each had noticeable accents in the first film, yet neither had them here. Oh well. Brian Cox as the bad guy was very good. One thing, I do wish his link to Wolverine was explained a bit better. Overall, the film moves well, grags little, and has action sequences that are well-done, with great effects. The ending leaves me more than ready for X3. I can't wait! Anyway, enjoy this film, because most comic-book movies aren't this well-done (remember the later Batman movies?).",4,United We Stand,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,1154,"['have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'two', 'feature', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'following', 'spirit', 'comics', 'not', 'exact', 'detail', 'charactors', 'stories', 'X2', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'due', 'seriousness', 'actors', 'director', 'obviously', 'put', 'played', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disastor', 'roles', 'are', 'intelligently', 'realized', 'here', 'only', 'couple', 'beefs', 'though', 'relationship', 'Rogue', 'Wolverine', 'so', 'touching', 'first', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'distant', 'here', 'what', 'happened', 'Storm', 'Rogue', 'accents', 'here', 'Storm', 'being', 'Africa', 'Rogue', 'Louisiana', 'had', 'noticeable', 'accents', 'first', 'film', 'yet', 'had', 'here', 'Oh', 'well', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'wish', 'link', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'explained', 'bit', 'better', 'Overall', 'film', 'moves', 'well', 'grags', 'little', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well-done', 'great', 'effects', 'ending', 'leaves', 'more', 'ready', 'X3', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Anyway', 'enjoy', 'film', 'most', 'comic-book', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'well-done', 'remember', 'later', 'Batman', 'movies']",N/A

771183,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B0000BWVCJ,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[1, 2]","X2 is a great movie, and this DVD is loaded with extras.  I waited way too long to finally take a look at this film.Director Bryan Singer did a great job, even better than the first X-Men, creating a movie that even people who know nothing about the X-men comic books will enjoy.  This movie draws the viewer right into the plot and keeps them on the edge of their seat.  The fight scenes are amazing, the characters have addictive personalities, and the story flows at just the right pace.Charles Xavier/Prof. X is played, of course and once again, by Patrick Stewart.  His character really doesn't have a lot of EXCITING parts, but the X-Men need a leader, and he fits the bill.  Stewart is very believable in this role.  We may see a little too much of him though, since the other characters are so much more interesting.Logan/Wolverine is played by Hugh Jackman.  He is absolutely perfect in his part.  I can't picture anyone else playing Wolverine.  His character only has a few moments that fall a little short of believable, like when he is seeking out William Stryker's hideout but doesn't think about the fact that it might be underground - even though the mutant school has a plane under the basketball court...go figure.  The other part that left me scratchin' my head was when the kids at mutant high store their Coke and Pepsi in a non-refrigerated cabinet even though they have a gi-normous refrigerator in the kitchen.  This was added to the script just to have Ice Man / Bobby Drake show his chillin' powers.  Scenes like that did not need to be forced into the movie - the viewers are not morons.  Other than those two very small mistakes, I found the scriptwriting for Wolverine to be better than I could have ever dreamed!  Zak Penn and David Hayter know how to write!  Great job, guys.Ian McKellen plays Eric Lensherr/Magneto.  He is fantastic in his role.  I really believe this guy thinks he is a mutant!Halle Berry manages to hole her own as Storm/Ororo Munroe, but I think she could have pushed a little more spice into her character.  Better than Cat---, oh, I won't even go there....Famke Janssen is very believable as Jean Grey, but how exciting is it to watch mind-powers?  It would have been cool to see her in more action scenes, like tossing people around with tele-whatever.James Marsden plays Scott Summers/Cyclops.  I never realized how hard it is to relate to a character when you can't see their eyes.  He did a great job in a part where you can't tell where the heck he is looking!  That cannot be an easy role.  Maybe I should ask Jamie Foxx how tough it is?Anna Paquin nails the role of Rogue.  She was absolutely born to play that role.  Talk about a comic book character coming to life - she did just that.Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is Mystique from this day forward.  She could almost jump this movie to an R rating.  Mutants aren't all bad. :-)William Stryker is played by Brian Cox.  What a jerk!  I think that is what he was going after, so good show ole' chap.Alan Cumming plays Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, one of the most memorable roles I have ever seen.  Man, this guy is one of THE best actors in the world today.  The directing, the acting, and the stunts involved with Nightcrawler are superb.  Everyone involved with the development and end-result of this character should pat themselves on the back.  I was totally impressed!Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike is played by Kelly Hu.  Hu really grabs the screen at first knuckle crack!  She has that IT factor so many stars strive for.  She fit the role of Deathstrike better than the orignal concept turned out.  You rock, Kelly!The plot is pretty simple:  Bad guy hates mutants, he wants them to be blamed for an attack on the president, the mutants find out the truth, and both sides are trying to stop the other before it is too late.  Some times, simple works best!  Like in X2's case.X2 DVD deliver the goods.

Aside from Superman, Spider-Man, and the first X-Men movie there have not been many that would be considered noteworthy. But with the first X-Men movie something changed.The first X-Men movie was not perfect, but was pretty darn close. It was very true to the spirit of the comic it was based on, featured good one-liners, and was over all a very enjoyable experience. I gave the first X-Men movie a five star rating, I liked it that much. For a sequel to surpass the original when I gave the original a five star rating is something spectacular. I wish there was a rating that I could give X2 that would be double what I gave the original, it was that drastically improved, and the original was not so severely flawed to begin with.The acting in X2 was improved over the original, with Halley Barry (Storm) having dropped the cheesy accent, and James Mardesen not being as dry as he was in his previous outing. Everyone seems to be much more comfortable with their roles this time, and much more capable. Nightcrawler is loveable and funny just like in the comic books, yet you also feel sorry for him in that even his fellow mutants seem to be taken a back by his appearance at first glance. Alan Cummings did wonderful in this role. One compliant I had in the comics was Lady Deathstryke and her cheesy dialogue. They kept her quiet for the movie; as a result she came off as cooler, and much deadlier.The plot is also loosely based on my all time favorite X-Men story, God loves Man Kills, and so it was nice to see so many references to the source material, as well as a number of mutant cameos like Colossus, Shadow Cat (albeit played by a different actress than X1) and many others.The best part of the movie was the way the movie ended. I am trying not to give out too many spoilers these days, but Phoenix fans will get a kick out of the movie's ending. Let us hope that it does not take too long for them to get the third movie under way, when considering how much better this movie was than the original, I now have very high expectations for the third film, especially since it very likely will end up being a movie version of the legendary Phoenix Saga! All in all, this movie definitely warrants repeat theater viewings, and is now one of my most anticipated DVDs, second only to the Two Towers Extended Edition.

In recent years, the comics have gotten stale and almost impossible to follow (A situation that Marvel Comics has turned around lately), and despite giving the first X-Men film more than one chance, I really didn't think much of it. So I tried to keep my expectations low for X-2...The good news is- It's MUCH better than it's predecessor! X-2 doesn't need to bombard viewers with as much information (Since that was mostly taken care of in the first film), and can pretty much hit the ground running. We pick up right where the first film left off: Magneto is in jail, Wolverine is looking for clues to his past, and anti-mutant hysteria is running rampant. Enter William Stryker, a fanatical Government employed mutant-hater, excellently played by Brian Cox. He sends blue-skinned mutant Nightcrawler to tear up the White House and rough up the President in the awesome opening sequence, therby ensuring Presidential cooperation with the anti-mutant agenda. Stryker wastes no time at all setting up a covert forces strike team, and their first target is.....Professor Xavier's school. Seems like they picked the wrong time to visit, though; The kids are home alone with their ""Babysitter"".....Wolverine! Let's get ready to RUMMMMBBBLLEEEE!!!Before you know it, it's all-out war between Stryker and the assembled mutant faction; Magneto is sprung from prison, Xavier and Cyclops are captured and used by Stryker, and the stage is set for a winner-take-all brawl at Alkali Lake, where Wolvie just might find out some interesting tidbits about his Adamantium skeleton and claws.....Fans disappointed by the lack of action in the first film will be in their glory here, as the number of fights have been ratcheted waaayyy up, including an excellent throw-down between Wolverne and Deathstrike, played by the lovely Kelly Hu, and Wolverine's berserker rage in the mansion. Gotta love the way he dispatches Stryker's goons...! Director Bryan Singer has assembled an excellent cast, and each character gets his or her moment to shine. The new additions, Cox and Hu, do a great job with their respective roles, and the end sets the stage for X-3. Longtime fans will appreciate the appearances by X-Men mainstays like The Beast, Colossus, Siryn, Artie, and Kitty Pryde, and be on the lookout for mentions of Gambit and Franklin Richards, among others.Bad news...? The film starts strong but gets a little draggy towards the end; Maybe some tighter editing was needed. Also, considering how heavily the film relies on characters and situations developed by X-Men comic-book scribe Chris Claremont, including the plot lifted whole-cloth from his legendary graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", I was more than a little dismayed not to see him acknowledged in the credits.X-2 isn't a perfect film, but it's a BIG step up from the previous X-Men movie, and a great way to start the summer movie-going season.",4,X-Fans Will Be Happy With X-2,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,2958,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'was', 'around', '9', 'years', 'old', 'recent', 'years', 'comics', 'have', 'gotten', 'stale', 'almost', 'impossible', 'follow', 'situation', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'turned', 'around', 'lately', 'giving', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'chance', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'So', 'tried', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low', 'X-2', 'good', 'news', 'is-', 'MUCH', 'better', 'predecessor', 'X-2', ""n't"", 'need', 'bombard', 'viewers', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'was', 'mostly', 'taken', 'care', 'first', 'film', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'pick', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'Magneto', 'jail', 'Wolverine', 'looking', 'clues', 'past', 'anti-mutant', 'hysteria', 'running', 'rampant', 'Enter', 'William', 'Stryker', 'fanatical', 'Government', 'employed', 'mutant-hater', 'excellently', 'played', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'blue-skinned', 'mutant', 'Nightcrawler', 'tear', 'up', 'White', 'House', 'rough', 'up', 'President', 'awesome', 'opening', 'sequence', 'therby', 'ensuring', 'Presidential', 'cooperation', 'anti-mutant', 'agenda', 'Stryker', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'covert', 'forces', 'strike', 'team', 'first', 'target', '..Professor', 'Xavier', 'school', 'picked', 'wrong', 'time', 'visit', 'kids', 'are', 'home', 'alone', 'Babysitter', '..Wolverine', 'Let', 'get', 'ready', 'RUMMMMBBBLLEEEE', 'know', 'all-out', 'war', 'Stryker', 'assembled', 'mutant', 'faction', 'Magneto', 'sprung', 'prison', 'Xavier', 'Cyclops', 'are', 'captured', 'used', 'Stryker', 'stage', 'set', 'winner-take-all', 'brawl', 'Alkali', 'Lake', 'where', 'Wolvie', 'just', 'might', 'find', 'out', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'Adamantium', 'skeleton', 'claws', '..Fans', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'action', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'glory', 'here', 'number', 'fights', 'have', 'been', 'ratcheted', 'waaayyy', 'up', 'including', 'excellent', 'throw-down', 'Wolverne', 'Deathstrike', 'played', 'lovely', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'Wolverine', 'berserker', 'rage', 'mansion', 'Got', 'ta', 'love', 'way', 'Stryker', 'goons', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'assembled', 'excellent', 'cast', 'character', 'moment', 'shine', 'new', 'additions', 'Cox', 'Hu', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'end', 'stage', 'X-3', 'Longtime', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'appearances', 'X-Men', 'mainstays', 'Beast', 'Colossus', 'Siryn', 'Artie', 'Kitty', 'Pryde', 'be', 'lookout', 'mentions', 'Gambit', 'Franklin', 'Richards', 'others.Bad', 'news', 'film', 'strong', 'little', 'draggy', 'end', 'tighter', 'editing', 'was', 'needed', 'Also', 'considering', 'how', 'heavily', 'film', 'relies', 'characters', 'situations', 'developed', 'X-Men', 'comic-book', 'scribe', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'including', 'plot', 'lifted', 'whole-cloth', 'legendary', 'graphic', 'novel', 'God', 'Loves', 'Man', 'Kills', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'dismayed', 'not', 'see', 'acknowledged', 'credits.X-2', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'BIG', 'step', 'up', 'previous', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'great', 'way', 'start', 'summer', 'movie-going', 'season']",N/A

While some characters have been scaled back in the story line (such as Cyclops and Rogue), this movie gives us more of Storm and her ability to control weather, young X men in training, Iceman and Pyro, and the Xavier-like Jean Gray.  Villains held over from the previous film are Mystique, whose role also expanded in this film and Magneto, played by the always talented Ian McCellan. Bryan Singer did a good job of juggling the meagerie of mutant characters under the care of Dr. Xavier.  I also like how he exhibits the theme of being an outsider in the movie, such as the one scene in which Bobby (Iceman) returns home.  The scene has Iceman ""coming out"" to his parents and revealing the dreadful news that he is a mutant.  It plays like a young man revealing his homosexuality to his parents and shows the broader scope of the theme of exclusion felt by the mutants to the rest of human society.  The most interesting new addition is Nightcrawler, played perfectly by the charming actor, Alan Cumming.  The scenes with Nightcrawler transporting are extremely well done and I hope we learn more about the blue skinned mutant in the next film.  The story line with Wolverine continues with some resolution but leaves plenty of information in the dark for the inevitable sequel.  There is a death in the film that I felt was unnecessary--I won't say who--but it would have been interesting to see this character return.  However, with the number of heroes and villains in the world of the X Men, there are plenty of new characters to choose from for the next movie. If you haven't seen the first film, you might want to check it out before seeing this one, although it isn't completely necessary.  There is enough interesting things going on in this movie to keep your attention and make you a fan of this group of heroes.  The ending also hints at things to come in the next film (for one hero in particular), making me eager to see the next one and dreading the wait for it to appear in theaters!

The plot, such as it is, exists mostly as a framing device for a succession of spectacular scenes in which the mutants from the first film, along with some new ones, engage in a series of battles, pursuits, and narrow escapes. Director Bryan Singer and the screenwriters pack in as many mutants as possible and pepper the film with brief, efficient, effective character moments.

Even when they do, the fans are general a bit jaded, knowing what to expect on the second go around, so even if it is as good, it's not as fresh.  Expectations can really hurt a film.  Everyone is so excited they often expect MORE, and so are let down no matter how good the film is.  So going in, sequels have a hard road.  When one is as good it's rare; when it's BETTER that is unbelievable.  WEll, believe it - X 2 is even better.The characters are set, so this film gives the chance to explore them a little deeper.  Glad to say the whole cast is back.  Super fun to see Gandolf being a bad guy!  Ian McKellan is back as Magneto the mutant who sees the destruction of mankind as the only way for the mutants to survive.  Patrick Stewart is Professor Charles Xavier, the kindly mentor who has a safe haven for mutants and works for their betterment for all.  Back also are Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine; Halle Berry magnificent as Storm; Famke Janssen as Jean Grey and Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly .  Also, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, Magneto's new sidekick, Brian Cox (the first Hannibal Lector) as Striker, his mutant killer Yuriko Oyama is played well by Kelly Hu and super addition is Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler.  The whole cast does a wonderful job.When we last saw Magneto, he'd been imprisoned within a plastic jail, since any metal can be reformed and used by him.  Everyone was happy at the school run by Xavier, while Logan was off trying to figure out his past.  The Senator was now a mutant.After the Nightcrawler attacks the president in a protest for Mutant's rights, Striker is able to pressure the president into a campaign against Xavier's School, playing right into Magneto's plans.  Short order, Mystique has Magneto free, but Xavier has been taken by Strike who is trying to manipulate him into killing all the mutants.  Thus in a switch, the good mutants must work with Magneto to free Xavier.It's lightning pace, wonderful effects, great fight scenes and stronger character development.

What's more it is bigger (some $50million), better, darker, longer, more action-packed and generally more exciting, with a substantial increase in the sexual tension.In this highly enjoyable sequel, the warring parties from the first instalment are forced into a partnership of necessity to battle against an army scientist, Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), who is determined to wipe all mutant life. To this end, in an excellent opening sequence, he coerces a teleporting mutant by the name of Nightcrawler into an attempt on the President's life with the purpose of turning both the public and the oval office against mutant kind.All the favourite X-people from the first instalment including Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Storm (Halle Berry), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey). In addition they are joined by three very noteable additions, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Pyro (Aaron Stamford) and Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu). Although Sabretooth and Toad are missing in action from the first movie they're not exactly missed (because lets face it they aren't the most exciting X-characters anyway)!One of the things I most enjoyed about X2 is how much more there was than the first movie. More action, more humour, more X-Men (and X-children) a longer running time, and in particular, more Halle Berry, more Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Famke Janssen, looking even more glamorous, more alluring and displaying more X-powers (as Dr Jean Grey) than she did in the first movie.That said, the film is still dominated by two actors; Brian Cox (one of Scotland's finest actors) who makes an excellent villain as Colonel Stryker and Australian actor Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. For it is their personal conflict and previous history that encapsulates the battle between good and evil that is at the heart of this sequel. However, they are ably supported by all the previously mentioned cast members and the addition of the excellent character Nightcrawler, played by another Scotsman, Alan Cumming.Kudos must also go to scriptwriters Mike Dougherty and Dan Harris and Director Bryan Singer, who was much criticised for the lack of action in the opening movie of this very profitable franchise. Dougherty and Harris have injected some subtle humour mainly absent from X-Men and Singer (with help from Editors John Ottman & Elliot Graham) has done well to seamlessly cram it all into 130 minutes, whilst still managing to keep to his promise of a darker sequel. Although critics may argue that much of the intelligence and thought-provoking elements from the first movie are much diluted X2 is still one of the finest comic book movie to date and exactly what X-fans were looking for in a sequel. Not only does X2 pave the way for a summer of superheroes, with The Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk imminent, but it also sets us up for the inevitable X3, although this is going to be hard to top.",5,"***** BIGGER & BETTER *****,",1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,3094,"['X-Men', 'are', 'back', '2003', 'first', 'blockbuster', 'X2', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'What', 'more', 'bigger', '50million', 'better', 'darker', 'longer', 'more', 'action-packed', 'generally', 'more', 'exciting', 'substantial', 'increase', 'sexual', 'tension.In', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'sequel', 'warring', 'parties', 'first', 'instalment', 'are', 'forced', 'partnership', 'necessity', 'battle', 'army', 'scientist', 'Colonel', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'determined', 'wipe', 'mutant', 'life', 'end', 'excellent', 'opening', 'sequence', 'teleporting', 'mutant', 'name', 'Nightcrawler', 'attempt', 'President', 'life', 'purpose', 'turning', 'public', 'oval', 'office', 'mutant', 'kind.All', 'favourite', 'X-people', 'first', 'instalment', 'including', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Magneto', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Professor', 'X', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Storm', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Rogue', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Mystique', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Cyclops', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Dr', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'addition', 'are', 'joined', 'three', 'very', 'noteable', 'additions', 'Nightcrawler', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Pyro', 'Aaron', 'Stamford', 'Yuriko', 'Oyama', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'Sabretooth', 'Toad', 'are', 'missing', 'action', 'first', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'missed', 'face', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'exciting', 'X-characters', 'anyway', 'One', 'things', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'X2', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'More', 'action', 'more', 'humour', 'more', 'X-Men', 'X-children', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'particular', 'more', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'more', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'looking', 'even', 'more', 'glamorous', 'more', 'alluring', 'displaying', 'more', 'X-powers', 'Dr', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'did', 'first', 'movie.That', 'said', 'film', 'still', 'dominated', 'two', 'actors', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'one', 'Scotland', 'finest', 'actors', 'who', 'excellent', 'villain', 'Colonel', 'Stryker', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'personal', 'conflict', 'previous', 'history', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'heart', 'sequel', 'However', 'are', 'ably', 'supported', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'cast', 'members', 'addition', 'excellent', 'character', 'Nightcrawler', 'played', 'Scotsman', 'Alan', 'Cumming.Kudos', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'scriptwriters', 'Mike', 'Dougherty', 'Dan', 'Harris', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'who', 'was', 'much', 'criticised', 'lack', 'action', 'opening', 'movie', 'very', 'profitable', 'franchise', 'Dougherty', 'Harris', 'have', 'injected', 'subtle', 'humour', 'mainly', 'absent', 'X-Men', 'Singer', 'help', 'Editors', 'John', 'Ottman', 'Elliot', 'Graham', 'done', 'well', 'seamlessly', 'cram', '130', 'minutes', 'whilst', 'still', 'managing', 'keep', 'promise', 'darker', 'sequel', 'critics', 'may', 'argue', 'much', 'intelligence', 'thought-provoking', 'elements', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'much', 'diluted', 'X2', 'still', 'one', 'finest', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'date', 'exactly', 'what', 'X-fans', 'were', 'looking', 'sequel', 'Not', 'only', 'X2', 'pave', 'way', 'summer', 'superheroes', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'Hulk', 'imminent', 'also', 'up', 'inevitable', 'X3', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'top']",N/A

Director Bryan Singer reteams with his first ensemble of characters including  Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Storm (Halle Berry), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Cyclops (Marsden) and Jean Grey (Janssen) with nemesis Magneto (McKellen) and Mystique (Stamos) while building up the history of the compelling Wolverine (Jackman) and introducing teleportic Nightcrawler (Cummings) and menacing Lady Deathstryke (Kelly Hu) as the assistant to military general Stryker (Brian Cox) who plans to invoke the Anti-Mutant Registration Act and eliminate them. X-Men 2 establishes itself in full throttle with canted CGI-action scenes including the exciting escape from the X-Mansion as well as the climactic showdown at Alkali Lake. Singer deftly avoids overcrowding and sculpts each character with dimension and emotions while impresses upon audience with a portrait of misfits and xenophobic alienation, that gains renewed resonance with post-911 era. The struggle of good versus evil becomes increasingly blurred with Xavier and Magneto confronting the enemy with different intentions.

771201,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B0000BWVCJ,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[1, 1]","Well I have no idea where to begin how amazed I am at the second installment in the blossoming X-Men movie franchise. The first movie from 2000 was a great start but had quite a few flaws to it and had a lot of room for improvement from there. Well, I'm proud to say that a good amount of that room is filled up with with lots more action packed storyline and much more intense plot. Let me just say that ""X2: X-Men United"" is a marvelous follow-up to the first X-Men movie and while that movie was very good, this one trashes that one by a mile with much more action-packed plot and greater intensity.This movie also brings a lot of new characters into the picture such as Nightcrawler and newcomer Pyro.The movie begins with the human and mutant societies sharing the planet except that the skyrocketing prejudices have polarized the two societies following an incident in D.C. and the anti-mutant hysteria reaches dangerous levels to where a vicious anti-mutant army general named William Stryker (Played by Brian Cox) launches an attack against the School For The Gifted and uses an experimental drug that manages to control the minds of mutants and makes them answer any questions that Stryker asks them and is on a quest to build his own version of Cerebro to use against the mutant population through the mind of the now captive Charles Xavier. Meanwhile Magneto escapes from the plastic prison and unlike the last movie, he teams up with his former rivals to fight against Stryker's forces. Meanwhile Wolverine goes back to Canada to try to remember his past and encounters the site of the long abandoned experimental lab, or is it abandoned?This movie, following the footsteps of the first X-Men movie, has tons and tons of action packed sequences, and much darker and bitterer atmosphere to the movie especially towards the ending.This movie still has it's flaws but nowhere near as much as the previous X-Men movie. Rogue, seaming looking more like a pure victim than a psychologically scarred character, plummets from a potential super heroine down to just a background character and played virtually no part in the events in the movie. I just hope that she plays a MUCH larger role in the next X-Men movie, whenever that one comes out. Storm fared a little better than in the last one, showing more personality and character and more intelligence but still nowhere near as much of the punch that the comic book character really has. Gambit still hasn't surfaced yet and he's one of my favorite characters. In terms of the missing characters, it's not necessarily bad that their not here as the comic books have SO many characters that it's impossible to bring every one of them onto one movie so I can't necessarily blame the moviemakers for leaving them out in this movie. Hopefully, Gambit, Jubilee, and Beast will surface in the next installment in this marvelous franchise.On the other extreme though, the characters that fared well in the first movie, are even better than they were in the last one. Wolverine shows a chilling rage during the beginning part of the movie. Patrick Stewert proves that he IS Professor Charles Xavier. No one in my opinion could've played Xavier better than Stewert. Sir Ian McKellan does even better as the villainous master of magnetism Magneto. Magneto is even more chilling in this movie than in the last one. To me, it's great to see the rivalry between Magneto and Xavier continue to develop yet they have to work together to stop Stryker and to me, it shows how it seems like Xavier and Magneto are like two sides of the same coin but each side has conflicting goals. Brian Cox though steals the spotlight as he gives a chilling role as the extremely evil general William Stryker. Most of the rest of the characters are also improved. We also bring in Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler and also future villain Pyro. There are lots more characters besides the ones I mentioned that deserve attention but the three I mentioned are the highlights.I view X2 as the movie where the possible war between mutants and normal humans seems to be in the beginning stages of this movie and it almost parallels what the possible outcome would be in the real world should prejudice overtake the minds of the societies of our world and lead to destructive rioting and even civil warfare. I think that both this and the first X-Men film have powerful messages of the dangers of discrimination against those who are `different' and how it causes devastation on all sides of the conflict.The special effects once again are amazing and the Cerebro room is absolutely amazing and how it shows the locations of the normal humans and the locations of the mutant populations. It almost is unsettling to see especially if there is technology that can locate every living human on the planet.This movie is getting a lot of the justice that it deserves with it's success at the box office along with Spider Man. I have to say that this is the age of Marvel Comic moviemaking and the blossoming of two powerful franchises and let's hope they have a long lifetime as opposed to what happened with the Batman movie series with the disastrous ""Batman & Robin"" movie. It can't stop here with the second X-Men movie though. There's just so much more to bring out that this movie needs to continue well past the second X-Men movie. Until all that happens, ""X2"" will definitely deliver the action and entertainment to keep us entertained until it happens. Perhaps the third one should involve the Sentinels.""X2"" is a near epic result of great casting, great script, and strong plot and is destined to become a future classic. There's more than I can give out in words.",5,"""The war is coming, and I intend to fight it""",1052697600,"05 12, 2003",2003,5687,"['Well', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'begin', 'how', 'amazed', 'am',

771203,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0000BWVCJ,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 6]","Although still a bit cluttered and slow-moving in parts, this was a vast improvement on the first ""X-Men"" film, which I thought was a complete dud. A couple of things are happening: first, obviously, special effects technology is finally catching up to the imaginative stretch of the early comicbook artists, and the action is starting to look cool enough to be convincing and fun. The opening sequence with the teleporting Nightcrawler is a good example -- not true, perhaps, to the character's original power as seen in the '70s, but very cool onscreen.Second, the studios are starting to get a sense of how to pace these things. For some reason movie producers who take on comicbook plots always seem to feel the need to endlessly stop the plot dead so we (the audience) can stare at the heros and bask in their awesome presence, a legacy, I'm afraid, of the uber-dismal ""Batman"" franchise. Personally, as a longtime comicbook reader, I just want them to get on with it and hit me with some action! I'm way over the point where it's amazing to me that these characters are on screen -- I want to see them do stuff. This film did a pretty good job moving in that direction. They assumed a fair amount of familiarity with the various characters, and that the audience for this film was prepared to see amazing and uncanny powers manifest themselves onscreen, and the tendency to explain, explain, explain was minimized in favor of action. The pacing of the action was a bit slow (it felt like they were just padding the movie at times) but in general they seem to be getting the idea. At the end of the film I thought, what they really need is to get to the point where making these blockbusters is as routine and as fluid a process as producing the comics -- if we were up to, say, X-Men Movie #12, I bet things would be a lot smoother and more fun.

Bryan Singer is an average director who sometimes finds himself in the middle of a very good script and although he tries very hard to ruin it with his mediocre talent, the story rises up and makes him look good.  Another example of this is ""The Usual Suspects.""  I actually cared whether or not the X-Men succeeded this time around.  In the first film the only compelling characters were Wolverine and Rogue, and I'm still scratching my head at the casting of Ian McKellen as Magneto.  Magneto was a huge guy!  That said, they could not have cast finer actor than Ian, so I'm torn.

Mok,"[5, 7]","The first X-Men was a huge disappointment for me, the illustrious Marvel Comics characters rendered ultra-stylish but very flat because the film was spread out too thin over too many characters.  On X2, the story and writing became much tighter, but the characters are still a little more preoccupied with showing off their powers than developing emotional facets.  The result is another good-looking film, with good action sequences but not a great deal of emotional involvement.I still can't accept a majority of the casting choices.  Given one of the main subplots of this film is the legendary Jean Grey-Wolverine-Cyclops romantic triangle, it was a mistake on the writers' part to make Cyclops even less of a character than the rest of the cast.  Wolverine is still our main character, taking up the most screentime and with the most important arc, so making his rival Cyclops such a shallow shadow of a character was a fatal misstep.  Halle Berry as Storm is a disaster, projecting no sense of power, leadership, or charisma, perpetually stuck on an oh-pity-me expression; and Anna Paquin sleepwalks her way through another role.  As a person who is doomed never to be able to have human contact, Rogue needs much more anger and fire in her emotional spectrum, and Paquin barely manages to give us just a sad pubescent look.  The character problem, however, is less glaring than in the first X-Men film.  Hugh Jackman remains a joy to watch, even if he's still too young for the role of Wolverine, and Alan Cumming deserves the accolades he got as new character Nightcrawler, giving this film some much-needed humour and eccentricity.The story's been tightened this time, with a better script and dialogue, even though it still has the feel of a series of mutant-power (and CG-effects) showcases rather than a cohesive, progressive plot.  It's still a step up from the original in that this time I actually cared about what was going to happen next, whereas in the first one I just waited for the whole thing to be over.The ending of this film will set off alarm bells in X-Men fans; if they are indeed about to invoke the fabled ""Dark Phoenix"" plot, the next installment has the promise of being either the greatest comic-book film ever made, or a colossal dud that flunks the expectations.  Bryan Singer sets it up well at the end here, though I fear that if the thin characterizations of the first two X-Men films persist, then the emotional punch of the Dark Phoenix story may fail to come through.  One can only hope, though:  The Jean Grey-Wolverine relationship in the original comics was heartbreaking, dark and endearing at the same time; I certainly wish they would nail it on the next film.  In the meantime, X2 is good enough as entertainment, even if it's not particularly deep -- once again, a disappointing treatment of the characters of the X-Men comics, some of the most troubled and fascinating characters in comic-book history.",3,"Far better than the first; still short on character, story.",1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,2952,"['first', 'X-Men', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'illustrious', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'characters', 'rendered', 'ultra-stylish', 'very', 'flat', 'film', 'was', 'spread', 'out', 'too', 'thin', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'X2', 'story', 'writing', 'became', 'much', 'tighter', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'little', 'more', 'preoccupied', 'showing', 'off', 'powers', 'developing', 'emotional', 'facets', 'result', 'good-looking', 'film', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'emotional', 'involvement.I', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'majority', 'casting', 'choices', 'Given', 'one', 'main', 'subplots', 'film', 'legendary', 'Jean', 'Grey-Wolverine-Cyclops', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'was', 'mistake', 'writers', 'part', 'make', 'Cyclops', 'even', 'less', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'Wolverine', 'still', 'main', 'character', 'taking', 'up', 'most', 'screentime', 'most', 'important', 'arc', 'making', 'rival', 'Cyclops', 'shallow', 'shadow', 'character', 'was', 'fatal', 'misstep', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', 'disaster', 'projecting', 'sense', 'power', 'leadership', 'charisma', 'perpetually', 'stuck', 'oh-pity-me', 'expression', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'way', 'role', 'person', 'who', 'doomed', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'human', 'contact', 'Rogue', 'much', 'more', 'anger', 'fire', 'emotional', 'spectrum', 'Paquin', 'barely', 'give', 'just', 'sad', 'pubescent', 'look', 'character', 'problem', 'however', 'less', 'glaring', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'joy', 'watch', 'even', 'still', 'too', 'young', 'role', 'Wolverine', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'accolades', 'got', 'new', 'character', 'Nightcrawler', 'giving', 'film', 'much-needed', 'humour', 'eccentricity.The', 'story', 'been', 'tightened', 'time', 'better', 'script', 'dialogue', 'even', 'still', 'feel', 'series', 'mutant-power', 'CG-effects', 'rather', 'cohesive', 'progressive', 'plot', 'still', 'step', 'up', 'original', 'time', 'actually', 'cared', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'whereas', 'first', 'one', 'just', 'waited', 'whole', 'thing', 'be', 'over.The', 'ending', 'film', 'will', 'set', 'off', 'alarm', 'bells', 'X-Men', 'fans', 'are', 'indeed', 'invoke', 'fabled', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'plot', 'next', 'installment', 'promise', 'being', 'greatest', 'comic-book', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'colossal', 'dud', 'expectations', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'up', 'well', 'end', 'here', 'fear', 'thin', 'characterizations', 'first', 'two', 'X-Men', 'films', 'persist', 'then', 'emotional', 'punch', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'story', 'may', 'fail', 'come', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Jean', 'Grey-Wolverine', 'relationship', 'original', 'comics', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'dark', 'endearing', 'same', 'time', 'certainly', 'wish', 'would', 'nail', 'next', 'film', 'meantime', 'X2', 'good', 'enough', 'entertainment', 'even', 'not', 'particularly', 'deep', 'once', 'again', 'disappointing', 'treatment', 'characters', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'most', 'troubled', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'comic-book', 'history']",N/A

The beauty of having read 20-plus years of continuity allows us to bridge gaps and make assumptions involuntarily. We already HAVE a director's cut in our heads. What you really want to know about is the acting and the effects. And here they are:Wolverine: If you had any doubts about Hugh being perfect, this will throw them to the floor and tromp them. One of my complaints with the first film was that Wolvie was kinda weak. He got trashed by Mystique (granted, an butt-kicking Mystique who is better than her comic counter part) and Sabretooth. Here though, Wolvie gets to go berserk. Mmmm... berserk. The whole mansion scene is a fan-service and oh what joy does it elicit. Logan kills, maim, and generally destroys. He's the best there is at what he does. But what he does isn't very pretty.Nightcrawler: Oh. My. God. Alan ""I am Een-veenceebahl!"" Cummings IS Kurt Wanger. His accent is dead on. His face is all but perfect. The only problem I had with his appearance was that there wasn't enough shadowplay ... it was TOO blue. But during the night scenes... it's an Alex Ross painting come to life. And they got his teleporting right! Remember the Claremont runs when Kurt would take down a group of foes by teleporting behind them and flooring them in succession? He DOES that! No mention made of his BAMF! stench though.Jean: I don't want to give anything away, but this isn't the Jean from the first movie. Oh, it's still Famke Janssen, but when she used Cerebro, it changed her. And I think you can guess how. I didn't care for her much in the first film, but now... god, you can why Logan loves her.Cyclops: James Marsden needs to die. Remember the old Cyclops? The dorky-but-cool, I-can-take-down-the-entire-team-by-myself Scott? What happened to him? I don't like comic Cyclops as a person, but I always though he was kinda cool. Movie-Cyclops is just a dork. It's a wonder why Wolverine just doesn't break him. I can't believe this weenie is playing Jesse Custer... they'd better cast Cass better.Storm: Halle Berry is okay, but Storm just doesn't do much. When you consider that she was usually the second or third main character in the comic stories and you give her a minor role in the movie... it's not going to cut it. I won't miss Halle is she doesn't return for the sequel though.Stryker: Why don't we see more of Brian Cox? He's been in, I think, four of my favorite movies these past few years. He's a great actor and his Stryker is cold, but there's a hint of pain beneath it all.Deathstrike: Never mentioned by her alias in the film. God, she's beautiful. Unfortunately, she's the red-shirted-crewman of the film ... the only reason she's there is to throw down with Wolverine. And she does. And it's cool. Too bad she only had a single line of dialogue.Mystique: Didn't care for her much in the first film. Then, she was just Generic Half-naked Henchwoman. In ""X2"" we see her devotion to Magneto. I love her scenes as Senator Kelly too (Bruce Davidson did a great job playing Mystique-as-Kelly). She's definitely become a central character and much thanks to Rebecca Stamos for enduring all that make-up. And she can actually act! They didn't really let her in the first, but she's darn good here.Magneto and Professor X: They're played by Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. If these guys ever make a mistake, I'll let you know.Now then, cameos, cameos, cameos. Colossus is there and his part is great (pretty funny too) and when he metals up ... awe inspiring. Too bad it was so short. Syren (or is it Siren? Theresa Cassidy, anyhow) is there, same with Kitty ""Katya"" Pryde and we see the girls use their powers. Worst-Mutant-Ever Artie has a few seconds of screen time (thankfully he's not annoying). You'll catch a glimpse of human Hank McCoy, a soundbyte of Sebastion Shaw (which nixes the argument that Stryker's kid was Mastermind), and a few names on Stryker's computer. In addition, one of the folders on Stryker's desktop is marked ""Project Wideawake"" ... Sentinels anyone?! Maybe in X3. My favorite cameo was the RonCo guy, Ron Popeil when that little kid is watching TV.The ending of the movie is very well done. There will of course be an X3 which leaves the question of its plot. The movie seems to hint towards Dark Phoenix which would be awesome were it done right. Personally, I would love to see Proteus. Maybe if they did that Cyclops-beating-down-Wolverine-and-Nightcrawler scenario I might respect James Marsden more... nah, probably not. Sentinels are always a possibility (as mentioned with the Project Wideawake folder). In any case, if Hugh, Brian, Famke, and Alan return we'll have a surefire hit.In short: See this movie. See it twice. Quit your job and live at the theatre if you must. Because this movie is probably the best comic adaptation to screen. Maybe not the best movie, but certainly the best translation. Seen it twice already and I'll probably see it several more times ... and I don't usually do that. Last movies I can recall were ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Matrix"". Until ""Watchmen"" or ""Preacher"" hits the screen, the ""X-Men"" will have no trouble holding their title against the other comic-movie contenders.",5,A review for the fans: Snikty snikty

And the second X-Men movie from Bryan Singer is pretty much everything a big summer movie should be and more.  It's got all the big effects and spectacle you want, but it doesn't serve it up in the typical vacuum familiar to most of these kinds of flicks.  It has a sensible (relatively speaking) and interesting plot.  It manages to establish interesting characters and give them all room to breathe.  And it has lots of fighting and stuff blowing up.  Sounds like easy accomplishments for a movie, but it's so rare to be somewhat of a miracle that X2 manages to pull it off.Singer deserves the lion's share of credit.  Derided by the press prior to the movie's release (he was depicted as a tempermental control freak who alienated actress Halle Berry - whose mailed-in performance is one of the relatively few low points of the film), Singer proves that movies like X2 benefit from having a fanboy dictator at the helm.  X2 stays true to its comic roots without feeling slavish, and Singer manages to convey themes as dark as genocide, racism, homophobia, post-traumatic stress, and the Holocaust in X2 without having them weigh the whole experience down.  This is an action movie with a brain and style of its own.It doesn't hurt that Singer has assembled perhaps the most attractive cast in the universe for his film, peppered with sharp character actors (Alan Cumming, Brian Cox) to provide a nice balance.  Vets Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen again give the Xmen storyline a dramatic flair that stops just short of taking itself too seriously.  Hugh Jackman also remains the film's centerpiece as Wolverine, the hero guys want to be and women swoon over.  He's Han Solo with a cooler haircut.There are plenty of neat little surprises too.  A quick exchange between Iceman and Wolverine provides a poignant scene of male mutant binding.  Cameos from beloved Xmen characters sprout up here and there.  And there's a neat reference to Brian DePalma's Femme Fatale.  Those may seem like small pleasures, but it's that kind of attention to detail that makes X2 special.  It treats the small scenes with the same importance as the big scenes, and that's a critical element of its success.  Along, of course, with effects that make your eyes pop out of your head.Overall, X2 is one of the best filmgoing experiences of the year.

771213,A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB,B0000BWVCJ,D. Rodgers,"[2, 4]","2000's smash hit X-Men certainly deserved a sequel (or two, or three), especially with all the cash it made and how the first one ended. Now the X-Men are back together once again, and this time they've got some new friends, including Nightcrawler and Pyro, and as well as some new enemies like William Stryker and Lady Deathstrike (his personal mutant ""assistant""/slave). This time the X-Men find themselves locked in an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mystique (their nemeses from the first film) against an evil military scientist named William Stryker, whose main goal is to eradicate the world of mutants once and for all.X2: X-Men United is in many ways an improvement over the first film. It's more psychological, it's longer, there's more action, more mutants, more of Wolverine slicing it up and like the first film it's never boring or drags, right from the get-go X2 is fierce and exciting. In fact, X2 is almost the perfect comic book film... almost. The one little, weak link in X2, for me at least, was Nightcrawler. Now, I like the character of Nightcrawler, but I honestly didn't care that much for Alan Cumming, he came off as a bit weak, and kind of ""dorky"". The character of Nightcrawler really just seems like a huge convenience to the plot; like the scene where he rescues Rogue in the X-Jet, which was oh so very convenient. But the one thing I liked about Nightcrawler, besides that awesome opening sequence in the White House, was his religious side, which I thought was interesting and made me sympathize with the character a little more.Pretty much everything in X2 works perfectly fine, which I attribute all that success to the amazing cast (Jackman, McKellen, Stewart, Marsden, Janssen, Berry, Paquin, Cox, Romijn), and the fact that the film was written and directed by the same people who clearly knew what they were doing back in 2000, and here they show us once again they still know what they're doing, and they aren't afraid to up the ante and take it up a notch. If you liked the first X-Men there's really no reason at all why wouldn't enjoy or like X2 as much, or maybe even more than the first film. It still has those surprising moments of humor, and plenty of action, maybe even more so than the original. And like the original, X2 sets itself up for a third film; let's just hope it turns out (at the very least) as good as the first two films, if not better.",5,"""Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.""",1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,2404,"['2000', 'smash', 'hit', 'X-Men', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'sequel', 'two', 'three', 'especially', 'cash', 'made', 'how', 'first', 'one', 'ended', 'Now', 'X-Men', 'are', 'back', 'together', 'once', 'again', 'time', ""'ve"", 'got', 'new', 'friends', 'including', 'Nightcrawler', 'Pyro', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'enemies', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Lady', 'Deathstrike', 'personal', 'mutant', 'assistant', '/slave', 'time', 'X-Men', 'find', 'locked', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'Magneto', 'Mystique', 'nemeses', 'first', 'film', 'evil', 'military', 'scientist', 'named', 'William', 'Stryker', 'main', 'goal', 'eradicate', 'world', 'mutants', 'once', 'all.X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'many', 'ways', 'improvement', 'first', 'film', 'more', 'psychological', 'longer', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'mutants', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'slicing', 'first', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'drags', 'right', 'get-go', 'X2', 'fierce', 'exciting', 'fact', 'X2', 'almost', 'perfect', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'almost', 'one', 'little', 'weak', 'link', 'X2', 'least', 'was', 'Nightcrawler', 'Now', 'like', 'character', 'Nightcrawler', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'that', 'much', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'weak', 'kind', 'dorky', 'character', 'Nightcrawler', 'really', 'just', 'huge', 'convenience', 'plot', 'scene', 'where', 'Rogue', 'X-Jet', 'was', 'oh', 'so', 'very', 'convenient', 'one', 'thing', 'liked', 'Nightcrawler', 'awesome', 'opening', 'sequence', 'White', 'House', 'was', 'religious', 'side', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'made', 'sympathize', 'character', 'little', 'more.Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'X2', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'attribute', 'success', 'amazing', 'cast', 'Jackman', 'McKellen', 'Stewart', 'Marsden', 'Janssen', 'Berry', 'Paquin', 'Cox', 'Romijn', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'clearly', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'back', '2000', 'here', 'show', 'once', 'again', 'still', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'ante', 'take', 'up', 'notch', 'liked', 'first', 'X-Men', 'really', 'reason', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'like', 'X2', 'much', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'first', 'film', 'still', 'surprising', 'moments', 'humor', 'plenty', 'action', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'original', 'original', 'X2', 'up', 'third', 'film', 'let', 'just', 'hope', 'out', 'very', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'better']",N/A

Now, the only thing stopping me from a full 5 stars is the fact that the plot is simplistic and rehashed from similar movies. You know the type - bad guys (once good) were wronged by the good guys and now seeks ultimate revenge. Had the plot been more original, it would boost the score one notch. Then again, it's based on a comic book series so how deep can it really get? I feel no particular need to explain the story as it's been done thoroughly by other reviewers and I never like to divulge the story line or it spoils it for the rest.However, having said that, I was so impressed with the characterization, acting, and special effects. The latter was amongst the best I've viewed bar none, particularly for the genre. It totally makes up for the lack of originality in the plot.Do yourself a favor, whether you are a die-hard comic book fan or a person who tends to dislike sci-fi or action movies, this flick will not disappoint!

771215,AYB3CG5IVMTSN,B0000BWVCJ,Dustin Merton,"[0, 1]","there is so much to tlak about x2 that i could fill this whole space.  the action is a lot higher in this movie and the story fits so well that this movie garners multiple viewings.  in x-men 1 bryan singer had to introduce all the characters and their powers to all fo the x-men neophytes, which is understandable.  but he wastes no time on introduction in this movie.  in my opinion the opening scene with nightcrawler is the best sequence in the movie.  singer has shown nightcrawler in a way that could not be done in the pages of comic books.  watching nightcrawler teleport so fast and efficiently is simply breathtaking.  the action does not stop there either, singer jumps right into the assault on xavier's school.  at this point you get to see wolverine finally cut loose...  plus singer gives you a buffet of characters from the books.  colossus powereing up and turning into steel is very cool, siryn is also cool when she cuts loose with her voice, there are just so many to go over.  iceman is one of my favorite characters from the comics as well as in the movies, he just hits all the right notes for me.  i love when he creates his ice wall.  in the next movie they should show iceman completely ice his body like in the comics, it would be too cool.  jean and storm go off to find nightcrawler, and he breaks your heart.  it is sad to see someone so pure and likeable taken advantage of and made to do evil by people such as william stryker.  however by the end of the movie you love him with all his heart because he is such a good person with a soul made out of pure gold.  i have not forgotten about magneto either, unfortunately he is taken advantage by stryker also but i love the way he breaks out of prison, he may be bad but he is bad in all the right ways.  mystique rocks also, she is so cool it is beyond words.  especially as she flips off the guards at the dam while slithering behind the door.  also take a look at the computer screen when she looks at stryker's files, you will see many names of x-characters fro the comics, the on i saw most clearly was jamie maddox, the multiple man.  also keep a look out fro mystique as rebeccas romijn stamos in the bar with the security guard, on the tv in the bar you see a human henry mccoy a.k.a the beast.  the scene at bobby drake's house is also entertaining and educational.  the comics have always made the point of how different people are treated simply for their differences.  when his mother asks him if he has tried not being a mutant, it is reminicent of the same question homosexuals encounter when asked have you tried not to be gay.  his brother proceeds to call the police, in an display of stupidity whene someone panics when confronted with something they do not understand.  pyro really gets to show off here as well as rogue.  when pyro cuts loose and almost kills people rogue saves the day by absorbing pyros power to control flame and put the fires out.  in the x-jet all the x-men almost die except storm unleashes a plethora of tornadoes to shake the plains in pursuit of the x-men.  jean also steps in the try and disarm the missiles, and almost accomplishes this feet, but they are forced to be saved by magneto, ironically.  although magneto helps the xmen he also has alternative plans, like any smart bad guy.  the fight b/w wolverine and deathstryke is a highlight of the movie, its kinda nice to see wolverine get[s] whooped a little bit.  at the end it is awesome to see jean really use her power to its fullest extent in order to save the day.  singer also gives you a clue as to his plans for a third movie, all i can say is the phoenix.  there is humor through out the movie also.  the humor is very subtle but is timed perfectly.  my favorite funny part was when magneto and mystique are snickering like school girls at rogue and then tell her that they love what she did to her hair.  people who are ian mckellen fans will pick up on the truly ironic funniness of the statement.  but rogue is hilarious when she is ready to fight both of them right then and then there and takes her gloves off.  x2 has all the right elements of a great summer blockbuster.  it has action, humor, depth, sincerity, and [great] charcters and story.  go see this movie 800 times and enjoy yourself the whole time every time you see it.  i dont see how anyone could be disappointed by this film, my prediction is it will be the best movie of the summer, but note i have not seen the matrix reloaded yet so after i see that, i will be able to judge which will be the best.  see ya at the theater.",5,X-MEN 2 IS THE KING OF COMIC MOVIES,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,4588,"['so', 'much', 'tlak', 'x2', 'i', 'could',

771221,A2F89BTWLSEEKF,B0000BWVCJ,Edward M. Erdelac,"[3, 3]","After being pleasently surprised by the first X-Men movie, I went to this one with the trepidation I have come to know from such sequels as `Blade II,' `Terminator 2,' and `Highlander 2.'  Usually after filmmakers have a hit with their first film (usually due to the amount of time invested in their scripts and actors over the amount of money in their special FX budget), they are heady with success by the second and chuck characterization and plot out the window in favor of boffo FX.I'm happy to type this is not the case with X2.  There is more of everything which worked for the first film - more characterization, more plot, more mutants, more film, more cameos (and nods to the fans - watch for Remy `Gambit' LeBeau's name on a computer screen and Hank `The Beast' McCoy being interviewed on Tv at a bar).The only thing I found lacking in this film was the presence of Sabretooth (while not a particularly memorable character in the first film, he DOES have a lot to do with Logan's past), and screen time for Cyclops.  However, what we do see of Cyclops is very well done, particularly in the performance of James Marsden, the man behind the visor.  In the five or ten minutes of time he has to emote throughout the film, he does a memorable job.  And did I miss it?  Where was Stan Lee's cameo?But there's so much more to like in this movie than those minor quibbles.  I should mention the quality of this cast - particularly the supporting characters, as the main players showed their admirable talents in the first film and do no wrong in this one either (in the case of Halle Berry as Storm, there is an actual improvement).  Alan Cummings gives an affecting portrayal of Nightcrawler, a unique looking mutant with the ability to teleport.  Spirituality and faith, something usually sadly lacking today's movies gets a good representation in his character -a young man with the appearance of a devil and the heart of a saint.  On the other hand, we have Aaron Stanford giving an awesome show as Pyro, a slacker of a mutant with `something dangerous in him' and the ability to maniuplate fire.  Pyro is the raging youth given the power to enact his angst on the adult world - he swings from typical teenaged apathy to gleeful violence with the kind of believability Hayden Christian was sorely lacking in Star Wars 2.  Shawn Ashman as a likable Iceman plays as a polar (pun intended) opposite to Pyro - he's the well-adjusted son to Pyro's broken home kid (there's a great scene where Pyro looks at one of Iceman's family photos with longing - superb!).  Even the brief cameos by Jubilee, Shadowcat and others are memorable - evidence of great casting which I hope will be more utilized in X3.  Of particular note is Daniel Cudmore as Colossus, whose physical presence in the flesh is just as impressive as when he shifts to his armored skin.  With the one underplayed line `I can help,' he serves to establish his character as a benevolent protector.  One can only hope we'll see more of him next time.The FX - something which is most often the downfall of a sequel (too many, usually) are used to great effect.  The escape of Magneto from his plastic prison is brilliant and exciting...the teleportation of Nightcrawler is well done (there's a nebulous, paint-in-the-water after effect that takes the BAMF! and smell of brimstone description of the comics to a new graphic level), and the escape of the children from the X-Mansion is great.  But where's the Danger Room?  I have full confidence in Synger's ability to pull that off in the next one...Story-wise, the individual skeins of characters in the first film are nicely woven in the sequel, attaining new heights -most signifigantly with Jean Gray and Logan.  The better (or worse?) part of Logan's past is revealed, and there is a great arc in Jean Gray's progression as a character which elevates this beyond the status of a mere inbetweener and puts it on par with Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek 2, and Godfather II in the way of superb chapters.  I hope this isn't truly a trilogy, and that Synger and the fantastic group of filmmakers he has put together agree to more of these films, because I just don't see how ending the series in the next one could be satisfactory (but then, I didn't see how X2 could be good, either!).  I wish there was more time spent on Rogue and Iceman, and its my hope that Synger knows not to introduce too many more mutants, for the plot could become convoluted if he panders to too many hopeful fanboys.  In short, Colossus and The Beast, yes!  Gambit and Forge, no!  As much as I would like to see such characters on screen, they would work better as cameos.  Let's see the story of the X-men we have.  To wrap it up, its very rare nowadays that we see a franchise of such quality as X-Men - something which appeals to a mass audience, is approved of by die-hard fans, and yet has a deeper, important message as well (that of tolerance, love - both of the self and others, and basic goodness).

Luck has it that this in fact surpasses the first one and ranks as one of my favorite sequels of all time.Professor Charles Xavier and his former friend and now enemy Magneto parted ways long long ago on their beliefs about the 'normal' humans treatment of mutants. The mutant world divided into the X-Men and the anti-human organizations lead by Magneto and Mystique. These two worlds in the mutant societies clash over the issue of humans and mutants living together. However ALL mutants' lives are in jeopardy when a vicious rogue general named William Stryker organizes a violent militant anti-mutant organization to track down and kill every mutant on Earth and launches an assault on Xavier's School for The Gifted.Now the mutants from both sides and that includes Xavier and his nemesis will have to put aside their differences and unite under one banner to defeat the threat that is William Stryker.This movie really does the trick of surpassing the original. Hugh Jackman delves even deeper into his role as Wolverine and this movie sheds more light on Wolverine's past involving his days as a victim of numerous experiments.THis movie is also a very scary example of the dangers of discrimination should it be left unchecked or even encouraged such as what happened in World War II.The DVD edition also has a lot of cool 'behind the scenes' extras along with some deleted scenes that never made it on the film include one of Jubilee who isn't in the movie itself.Go and buy this DVD when time and money allow it!",5,One of the best sequels in many years.,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,1700,"['Being', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'turned', 'off', 'whole', 'concept', 'sequels', 'however', 'was', 'ready', 'see', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'United', 'quot', 'heartbeat', 'considering', 'how', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'Luck', 'fact', 'first', 'one', 'one', 'favorite', 'sequels', 'time.Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'former', 'friend', 'now', 'enemy', 'Magneto', 'parted', 'ways', 'long', 'long', 'ago', 'beliefs', ""'normal"", 'humans', 'treatment', 'mutants', 'mutant', 'world', 'divided', 'X-Men', 'anti-human', 'organizations', 'lead', 'Magneto', 'Mystique', 'two', 'worlds', 'mutant', 'societies', 'clash', 'issue', 'humans', 'mutants', 'living', 'together', 'However', 'mutants', 'lives', 'are', 'jeopardy', 'when', 'vicious', 'rogue', 'general', 'named', 'William', 'Stryker', 'violent', 'militant', 'anti-mutant', 'organization', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'mutant', 'Earth', 'assault', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted.Now', 'mutants', 'sides', 'Xavier', 'nemesis', 'will', 'have', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'unite', 'one', 'banner', 'defeat', 'threat', 'William', 'Stryker.This', 'movie', 'really', 'trick', 'surpassing', 'original', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'even', 'deeper', 'role', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'more', 'light', 'Wolverine', 'past', 'involving', 'days', 'victim', 'numerous', 'experiments.THis', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'scary', 'example', 'dangers', 'discrimination', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'unchecked', 'even', 'encouraged', 'such', 'what', 'happened', 'World', 'War', 'II.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'also', 'lot', 'cool', 'scenes', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'include', 'one', 'Jubilee', 'who', ""n't"", 'movie', 'itself.Go', 'buy', 'DVD', 'when', 'time', 'money', 'allow']",N/A
771223,AKZMP6OOE89GV,B0000BWVCJ,Elite14,"[2, 3]","Now this is how to do a comic book movie!!! This film will satistfy almost any movie fan, and leave them wanting more. It's got tons of action, interesting characters, a good storyline and might even make you shead a tear or two. What more can you ask for from a summer blockbuster (even though it came out in May) movie?I enjoyed the first X-Men quite a bit. While it wasn't the best movie I had seen, it was definately the best comic book movie I have seen since the original Superman. Like many others, I was eagerly awaiting a sequal. And it does not disappoint. Not much has changed from the last movie. The focus of the film is still how humans can't accept mutants breathing the same air as them, so they try to wipe them out. X2 just has a different villain &amp; goes about it a different way.The opening scenes of this movie are amazing. They involve the new mutant, Nightcrawler, trying to asassinate the president of the United States. It definately shows off his mutant powers of teleportation, and the special effects will blow your mind. After a great opening like that, you are automatically hooked.The movie then goes with Wolverine as he goes back to the site where he was &quot;made&quot;, so to speak. All he finds is rubble of, what used to be, a scientific lab. He then returns to the X-Men mansion. There you get re-introduced to all of the X-men and some new ones. Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm, Rogue &amp; all the rest are here. Iceman plays a much larger role in this picture. He is now Rogue's boyfriend. You are also introduced to a new X-man named Pyro. He is around the same age as Iceman &amp; Rogue, but way more unstable and likes to show off his powers too much for Professor Xavier's liking.After hearing of Nightcrawler's asassination attempt on the president, Xavier sends Jean Grey &amp; Storm to go find the mutant and bring him back to the mansion. Xavier and Cyclops go visit Magneto, who is now being held prisoner in a plastic cage. Wolverine gets to stay home with the kids &amp; babysit. Due to the assination attempt, the president gives Col. William Stryker the o.k. to raid the X-men mansion in hopes of finding the mutant that attacked him. Stryker has his own agenda, however and wants all mutants wiped off the face of the planet.At that point the story &amp; action picks up quite a bit. Bryan Singer (the director) does a great job of seamlessly blending 3-4 storylines together and they are all going on at once. Stryker (played by Brian Cox) is the villain of the film and is trying to make his own cerebro and use Prof. X to kill every mutant on earth. Wolverine has a long &amp; storied past with Stryker. Which I won't get into (might ruin some plot lines), but you learn the origin of Wolverine. Stryker has been holding Magento prisoner for some time now, and he plans a nice escape and teams with the X-men to try to stop Stryker, or so the X-Men think. To make a long story short, it all comes together in the end and it's a very good storyline. The climax of the film is VERY well done and I will bet you at least shed one tear while watching it. This is how you not only do a comic movie, but any movie. It's well acted, well scripted, &amp; well directed. In some other director's hands, this could have been just another action movie involving comic book characters. Brian Singer brings all togther and makes it what it is. I am hoping they make a third film and bring Singer back to complete a trilogy.The DVD is loaded with special features. And they are all quite good, and not useless like some of the Terminator 3 supplements that I just viewed. There are commentaries, behind the scenes, a making of documentary, 11 featurettes, deleted scenes, and trailers. It's quite a good package and if it wasn't the for the Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers Exended Edition DVD, this might be the best DVD of the year.",4,A rare sequal that outshines the original........,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,3877,"['Now', 'how', 'do', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'film', 'will', 'satistfy', 'almost', 'movie', 'fan', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'got', 'tons', 'action', 'interesting', 'characters', 'good', 'storyline', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'shead', 'tear', 'two', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'even', 'came', 'out', 'May', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'X-Men', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'definately', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Superman', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'sequal', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Not', 'much', 'changed', 'last', 'movie', 'focus', 'film', 'still', 'how', 'humans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'mutants', 'breathing', 'same', 'air', 'try', 'wipe', 'out', 'X2', 'just', 'different', 'villain', 'amp', 'different', 'way.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'amazing', 'involve', 'new', 'mutant', 'Nightcrawler', 'trying', 'asassinate', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'definately', 'mutant', 'powers', 'teleportation', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'blow', 'mind', 'great', 'opening', 'are', 'automatically', 'hooked.The', 'movie', 'then', 'Wolverine', 'back', 'site', 'where', 'was', 'quot', 'made', 'quot', 'speak', 'rubble', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'scientific', 'lab', 'then', 'X-Men', 'mansion', 'get', 're-introduced', 'X-men', 'new', 'ones', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Cyclops', 'Storm', 'Rogue', 'amp', 'rest', 'are', 'here', 'Iceman', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'picture', 'now', 'Rogue', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'new', 'X-man', 'named', 'Pyro', 'same', 'age', 'Iceman', 'amp', 'Rogue', 'way', 'more', 'unstable', 'show', 'off', 'powers', 'too', 'much', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'liking.After', 'hearing', 'Nightcrawler', 'asassination', 'attempt', 'president', 'Xavier', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'amp', 'Storm', 'go', 'find', 'mutant', 'bring', 'back', 'mansion', 'Xavier', 'Cyclops', 'go', 'visit', 'Magneto', 'who', 'now', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'plastic', 'cage', 'Wolverine', 'stay', 'home', 'kids', 'amp', 'babysit', 'Due', 'assination', 'attempt', 'president', 'Col.', 'William', 'Stryker', 'o.k', 'raid', 'X-men', 'mansion', 'hopes', 'finding', 'mutant', 'attacked', 'Stryker', 'own', 'agenda', 'however', 'mutants', 'wiped', 'off', 'face', 'planet.At', 'point', 'story', 'amp', 'action', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'director', 'great', 'job', 'seamlessly', 'blending', '3-4', 'storylines', 'together', 'are', 'going', 'once', 'Stryker', 'played', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'villain', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'own', 'cerebro', 'use', 'Prof.', 'X', 'kill', 'mutant', 'earth', 'Wolverine', 'long', 'amp', 'storied', 'Stryker', 'Which', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'might', 'ruin', 'plot', 'lines', 'learn', 'origin', 'Wolverine', 'Stryker', 'been', 'holding', 'Magento', 'prisoner', 'time', 'now', 'nice', 'escape', 'teams', 'X-men', 'try', 'stop', 'Stryker', 'so', 'X-Men', 'think', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'together', 'end', 'very', 'good', 'storyline', 'climax', 'film', 'VERY', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'bet', 'least', 'shed', 'one', 'tear', 'watching', 'how', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'comic', 'movie', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'scripted', 'amp', 'well', 'directed', 'other', 'director', 'hands', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'action', 'movie', 'involving', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'togther', 'what', 'am', 'hoping', 'make', 'third', 'film', 'bring', 'Singer', 'back', 'complete', 'trilogy.The', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'useless', 'Terminator', '3', 'supplements', 'just', 'viewed', 'are', 'commentaries', 'scenes', 'making', 'documentary', '11', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'quite', 'good', 'package', 'was', ""n't"", 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Two', 'Towers', 'Exended', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'DVD', 'year']",N/A

They have always defined the essence of the movie and have always set the impression that would last long after the movie is finished.For these kids of spiritual ascensions are people drawn to watch motion pictures - for these singular and rare moments in which the thought and belief that there is hope for mankind - in all of its diversity - emerge in its most glorious incarnation.=============================================================In this film, the mutants, whatever their goals may be, stand united (at least for a while) against a common and formidable enemy that wishes to destroy them because of what they are. As with many science fiction releases, there is a strong reference in the events of this film to the dark and terrible past of humanity.This readiness to allude and remind the viewers parts of human history, as was the case in the first X-Men movie, gives this movie the right to exist and stand as an important educational vehicle for the young generation, this film's main audience.

771227,A2BZ2AO3EOVXYC,B0000BWVCJ,E. Santos,"[0, 0]","Before I even begin, I have to stress out my point that this is a review of X2 as a stand-alone movie.  We all know that this is a sequel, but to give a fair review, I have to write about this film without having to compare it to the first installment.The whole plot of the film zeroes in on a military officer named Mr. William Stryker.  His disappointment in life lies in the fact that his son is a mutant.  Therefore he goes out on a mission to destroy every living mutant on the planet.  We also learn later on in the film that it is this character who was responsible for the creation of the X-Men character, Wolverine.Because of this sudden appearance of Mr. William Stryker, the X-Men and the other mutants Magneto and Mystique are forced to join forces whether they like it or not.  New X-Men characters are introduced in this film and are given more character depth- namely Iceman (a.k.a. as Bobby Drake), and Pyro.  Iceman has the ability to create all forms of ice either with a simple touch, or one breath.  Pyro has a similar power, the difference is that he can manipulate fire in all forms and use it to destroy his enemies.  His weakness is that he can only control the fire, he cannot ignite it.  Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Halle Berry, and Famke Jemsen all come back to reprise their roles as Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, and Dr. Jean Grey.  The same goes with Ian McKellen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Magneto and Mystique.In X2, the title can't be more apt because despite their differences in opinion about how to deal with the human race accepting the mere existence of mutants, they are uncomfortably forced to unite to defeat their enemy, Mr. William Stryker.I find this film impressive because a lot of comic book characters have been turned into movies such as Superman, Spiderman, Batman, and Daredevil.  However, director Bryan Singer manages not to create a film that is not too comic booky, silly, or downright stupid.  It has a PG-13 rating because kids are not going to totally absorb the lesson in this film.  Children may walk away wishing they had extra-ordinary powers and become X-Men as well, but they still won't be able to grasp the whole genesis of X2- with the exception of the (no pun intended) intellectually gifted kids.  Some of the characters of this film are given a lot of character depth; which is imperative in every film.My disappointment in X2 lies in the fact that I its one hour and 55 minutes of screen time, they still fail to give character development in Cyclops, Storm, and Mystique.  We delve deeper into the psyche of Wolverine and why he has all this rage exploding inside him.  We also are entertained into how Iceman's family reacts when they learn that their son is a mutant.  I was laughing when Iceman's mother asks him, ""Have you ever tried...not being a mutant?""

I saw the first x-men movie and thought it was a c+ movie, spider-man was a b-, dardevel was a c, and the hulk was a d+. This movie was one of the best action movies this year. In fact, it might be one of the best action movies I have ever seen. The major reason I enjoyed this movie is because of the story line. It isnt the normal ""theres a bad guy loose and the super hero kills him and the world it a safer place again,( while getting the girl)."" This movie is more of a anti super hero movie. It is much darker then most comic book movies but still maintains a comedic sence. The super heros in the movie are anti super heros because everyone who they save hates them, and it is on a bigger scale then spider-man. Anouther thing about this movie is the fact that their are a team of x-men instead of one or two super heros agenst one or two super villins. another plus is the fact that the story is based around a probelm that can never be solved. The probelm is the growing fear of the mutant kind on earth. Every year more and more mutants are born, and every year there are more people to hate them. Even families are separated by this as shown when the iceman reterns home after his school was invaded by government officals. After showing his family his mutation, his brother calls the police in jealousy, and states that his family is under attack by mutants.

771236,A26IVJJTXOE85B,B0000BWVCJ,Georgio Alfani,"[2, 4]","HEY! YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED! GET A LIFE!SPOILER WARNINGThe sequel to the beautifully character driven original, ""X-Men"" has more action, a longer running time, and a larger cast this time around. For many people these attributes constitute credentials for a ""better"" film but in my opinion ""X2"" SLIGHTLY falters in the story telling department when compared to the first film simply because the film abandons several character's development; characters who were developed and introduced in the first film, only to be pushed to the side in favor for the Wolverine character. Before I begin my analysis I'd like to state that I am the hugest X-Men fan in my area. I meet a lot of people who say they love X-Men but when I actually converse with them I found out that they are merely fans of the cartoon and actually know very little about X-Men at all.With that being said, i thought the opening scene to the film was great and there is no denying that the film's greatest highlight is the inclusion of the character Nightcrawler, who is played impeccably by Alan Cumming and whose action scenes are crafted beautifully by the special effects department. The main plot of the film is an intriguing one, based on the X-Men graphic novel, ""God Loves, Man Kills.""  Bryan Singer made some changes to the storyline, which is a SLIGHT  shame because the original story would have complimented the religious character Nightcrawler greatly. The original story  had such a deep meaning, using a lot of religious symbolism, which lead to the drawing of comparisons to mutants as angels or demons in a society that was swarming with fear of the new mutant phenomenon. All this was changed in order to tell Wolverine's story, so essentially this film is combining two stories and putting them into one, which in its own right is pretty well done. The other story is the Weapon X saga and what Brian Singer has done is taken William Stryker, the villain from ""God Loves, Man Kills"" and made him the architect of Wolverine's unbreakable skeleton. Willian Stryker, who is played impeccably by Brian Cox, is the other strong point of this film. He plays his role with great conviction and the best scene in the film is when he finally reveals his malicious plot to Professor X. It also must be noted that the cinematography is beautiful as well as Singer's directing...but his writing is an entirely different matter which i will touch on later.Another excellent scene that must be noted is when Magneto, played exceptionally once again by Ian McKellen, rips the blood iron out of police guard's body. The inclusion of this scene is almost worth forgiving all the other inconsistancies in this film.  ALMOST.There are several characters in this film who feel left out and feel like they stand around and don't contribute much to the story, namely the characters Cyclops Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro. Cyclops' role feels cast aside in favor for Wolverine and it sticks out like a sore thumb. He is simply missing for a good hour and fifteen minutes with little explaination as to where he went. The lack of urgency into his wherababouts is nowhere to be seen, especially in his true love Jean Grey, which for me is an example of poor storytelling. Jean flirts with Wolverine too carefree and mentions she is worried about her lover but it cannot be seen on the surface at all. I understand that it's okay not to have Cyclops at the center of the film, as he wasn't even part of the X-Men team for most of the 80's, but to introduce a character in the first film and to simply push him aside with little explanation of his whereabouts is what I consider poor storytelling. If you want to take him out of the highlight, do it right, and for me this was only a hint of what was to come in an even worst handling of the character in the next film, X3.All the scenes with Iceman, Rogue, and Pyro feel misplaced, like a channel was changed to Disney Channel or Teen Nickelodeon. Clearly Singer doesn't read the comics or novels because his interpretation of these characters is so far off that it makes me cringe. During this film's down times the dialogue is not at its best. References to boyfriends, girlfriends and babysitting, it feels misplaced in a sci-fi environment, especially X-Men.The lack of character development for Rogue's character is disappointing as well. Her character in the first film, while changed to a young girl with no super powers and more in an innocent phase in her life, was still appreciated because she was a vital role to the main plot and I felt her introduction would lead to the eventuality of her becoming the Rogue we all know and love; strong spirited and fighting in a deep struggle to control her powers. There is nothing like that here. She is simply Iceman's girlfriend and all hope of her becoming the Rogue that we all know and love is abandoned. The thing I abhor the most about this film is the relationship that Brian Singer created for her, which is with the Iceman character. This is so far off from the comic that I cannot turn a blind eye to it. It feels blasphemous, putting her in a relationship with the Iceman character. In the comic book there is a beautiful story that is told, where she is in a relationship with a character named Gambit, a playboy type character. She struggles in finding trust for him and he struggles in trying to prove his love for her, knowing he can have any woman he wants, he chooses the woman he can't touch. It is a very touching story and better executed than the sappy love story Singer has created. What also must be noted is they way Singer conceptualizes Rogues reactions to Iceman's advances. When Iceman makes a pass at her she is hardly resistant at all, while in the books, THE REAL ROGUE would punch you in your face if you tried to make an advance at her because she is greatly traumatized by her childhood experience with touching another person, which was executed beautifully in the first film. In X2, she simply says, ""I don't want to hurt you....Oh well, let's give it a try."" That's not Rogue's character at all!!! She is suppose to struggle with her powers and push people away from her in fear that she'll kill them!! Okay, so Singer didn't give Rogue superpowers, that's fine, but to completely change her personality is a crime and a great injustice to such a great character that is beloved by X-Men fans. The love story Brian Singer has come up with is flat, boring, typical, and I know the scene where Rogue and Iceman are holding hands while contemplating the possibility of death is suppose to symbolize similar prospects of the Gambit-Rogue love affair but its execution feels so downgraded and meaningless that it is almost laughable.Here's an excerpt from a REAL romance from X-Men 24 between Rogue and Gambit. This is what was butchered and watered down by Brian Singer. This is one of the greatest romances ever and the main reason why i cannot turn a blind eye to Singer's butchering of this great love story. remember, Rogue cannot touch anyone, yet Gambit, a man who could have ANY woman, chose the one he can't touch...Gambit strokes Rogue's hair and tries to put his cheek to Rogue.Rogue: ""No! I can't...Because I know if I hurt you...I know...I'll just want to die!""Tears come to Rogues eyes. Gambit holds her.Gambit: ""Then we won't kiss Rogue. Simple as that...Maybe that's just fine now for you and me. Maybe we both have to learn that there is more to love than just the physical. I know what's inside you, chere....Maybe we'll both end up learning what love really means and I can't think of anyone else to learn with than you, Rogue...That's all that matters.""WHAT BRIAN SINGER AND HIS WRITERS HAVE DONE IS A DISGRACE TO THE ROGUE CHARACTER!!! What do we get instead of this deep and epic romance? we get a horny iceman who can't take no for an answer, who doesn't consider how Rogue feels, he just wants to make-out. And a Rogue who kisses iceman for 2 seconds and when her power does take effect, it barely does nothing. The consequences of her using her power is completely undermined! When she touches someone, she absorbs their memories and it's a big deal. Here it's nothing but a walk in the park, especially the scene where she ""controls"" Pyro. I still can't believe this gets by all these X-Men ""fans.""The Iceman character's personality is another thing that was compromised by Brian Singer. His whole personality has been changed into that of a total wannabe Justin Bieber teenage heart throb, while in the comic he was a humorous and confident smart ass. The Iceman character would have been a great oppurtunity to use some very witty and intelligent dialogue, it's a shame.Another scene that was pointless was the camping scene, or at least a good 's of it. The reason why Magneto just so happens to be standing in that particular geographic location while the Blackbird is crashing is never explained, or better yet you can't explain it, it's simply ridiculous that he would be coincidentally there. The scene where Mystique tries to seduce Wolverine is pointless. I would have much rather have utilized that time frame to see where Cyclops was and it feels like Brian Singer lost all objectivity in telling an X-Men story, a story that is an assemble piece, in exchange for the popular-at-the-moment-character Wolverine. I felt it was unwise to introduce Cyclops and Rogue in the first film and completely abandon their development.It was good to see Storm get a little more to do this time around, namely having a friendship with Nightcrawler, who helps her regain her faith. I also enjoyed the handling of the Weapon X saga...it was really well done. i love the scene where wolverine breaks out of the facility and has blood all over his hands screaming in agony!! That 10 second clip was better than the entire x-men origins movie!!I also enjoyed the special effects, namely Storm's tornado's and the epic fight scene between wolverine and deathstrike. And finally we get to see wolverine cut loose, tearing enemies to shreds who invade the x-mansion!despite this films flaws, the goods outweigh the bads...",4,Good but FAR from perfect,1268092800,"03

It isn't often that sequels are superior to the first film - in this case it is definitely true.The first film wasn't horrible, but as a fan of the comics, it was disappointing on several casting levels as well as the plotline and flow.X2 makes none of the first film's errors:  it is action from the moment the movie starts and it ends the same way.  A new mutant has infiltrated the White House and threatens the President.  For those of us familiar with the comics, we know this mutant to be Nightcrawler, but to those unfamiliar, you find out eventually.  In fact, this film manages to step up not only the action and the pace, but integrates a love triangle very prominent in the comics, and effectively uses a few other new mutants.  We are introduced to a mutant of unbelievably strong psychic power (Legion in the comics?) and are able to witness a pre-mutant Hank McCoy (Beast) on television, while witnessing a list of mutants whose names many will recognize.  These are just a few of the things that are thrown out there for the comics fans.  Possibly the biggest thing thrown out there to us is in the final moments of the film.  I won't divulge it here, but suffice it to say that those who haven't read the comics may feel that something is lacking in the ending of the film....For those of us who know the comics, we'll eagerly await the next installment.I'm not necessarily nuts about the ""mutated"" life lines assigned to our heros.  (i.e. Iceman is one of the original X-Men, but the movie makes him a much younger novice.)  I'm also not nuts about the original casting of Halle Berry as Storm - yes, she's gorgeous and now that she's got an Oscar she's more of a draw than before - BUT - Chris Claremont once said that Storm was modelled after the model/actress Iman, who is not only very much alive, but doesn't look much different than she did years ago - and she IS African as Storm is supposed to be)......X2: X-Men United is a really great action film that will have you laughing and cheering and leaving the theater wanting more!",4,This movie kicks major booty and is a heck of a lot of fun!,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,2198,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'four', '5', 'genre.X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'unbelievble', 'follow-up', 'what', 'was', 'just', 'mediocre', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'often', 'sequels', 'are', 'superior', 'first', 'film', 'case', 'definitely', 'true.The', 'first', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'fan', 'comics', 'was', 'disappointing', 'several', 'casting', 'levels', 'as', 'well', 'plotline', 'flow.X2', 'none', 'first', 'film', 'errors', 'action', 'moment', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'new', 'mutant', 'infiltrated', 'White', 'House', 'President', 'familiar', 'comics', 'know', 'mutant', 'be', 'Nightcrawler', 'unfamiliar', 'find', 'out', 'eventually', 'fact', 'film', 'step', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'action', 'pace', 'love', 'triangle', 'very', 'prominent', 'comics', 'effectively', 'few', 'other', 'new', 'mutants', 'are', 'introduced', 'mutant', 'unbelievably', 'strong', 'psychic', 'power', 'Legion', 'comics', 'are', 'able', 'witness', 'pre-mutant', 'Hank', 'McCoy', 'Beast', 'television', 'witnessing', 'list', 'mutants', 'names', 'many', 'will', 'recognize', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'thrown', 'out', 'there', 'comics', 'fans', 'Possibly', 'biggest', 'thing', 'thrown', 'out', 'there', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'here', 'say', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'comics', 'may', 'feel', 'something', 'lacking', 'ending', 'film', '.For', 'who', 'know', 'comics', ""'ll"", 'eagerly', 'await', 'next', 'installment.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'necessarily', 'mutated', 'life', 'lines', 'assigned', 'heros', 'i.e', 'Iceman', 'one', 'original', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'much', 'younger', 'novice', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'nuts', 'original', 'casting', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', 'yes', 'gorgeous', 'now', 'got', 'Oscar', 'more', 'draw', 'BUT', 'Chris', 'Claremont', 'once', 'said', 'Storm', 'was', 'modelled', 'model/actress', 'Iman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'much', 'alive', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'different', 'did', 'years', 'African', 'Storm', 'supposed', 'be', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'really', 'great', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'cheering', 'leaving', 'theater', 'wanting', 'more']",N/A

Vernon ""gv""","[0, 0]","My expectations for summer blockbuster sequels have been virtually destroyed by recent summers which gave us watered down mush like ""MIB II"" and the feeble Star Wars sequels. Besides, the original X-Men was just a good, if not fully realized, superhero movie. I probably would have been happy if the sequel merely lived up to the original.Within the first 20 minutes ""X2"" establishes itself as that rarest of beasts: the sequel that surpasses its predecessor on virtually every point of comparison. If anything it's even truer to the comic, as a cigar-chomping Wolverine comes into his own with the kind of brief responses and one-liners his animated counterpart has spat out for years.The newcomers are engaging, especially Nightcrawler, who opens the film with an action sequence that is made truly breathtaking with rocket-fast camera work, imaginative editing and cutting-edge special effects. Everything I've read so far makes reference to this sequence and with good reason. There is nothing like an action movie that grabs you by the throat from frame one.We learn more about the returning characters from the first film and we get to see them interact in new ways, some not by choice but by necessity. We understand more about what makes them who they are in a way that is universal to anyone who's ever felt excluded or outside looking in. This is due mainly to absolutely top-notch acting from almost everyone. It's like nobody has told Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellan that they're in a comic book movie and their line readings run the gamut from earnest to grave to brutally funny. I was starting to think Magneto was going to be sidelined for the film but when his moment in the sun arrives, McKellan is so good I actually was cheering for him.On that point, I'll just say that my audience was cheering, laughing, and applauding throughout the film. Seattle audiences are desperately snooty and we're quick to show our displeasure for cheese or lazy filmmaking (a la Star Wars 1999-present) and all I can tell you is this film is a true crowd pleaser.

771243,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B0000BWVCJ,Hazen B Markoe,"[1, 1]","With the huge success of X-MEN, it was only natural that a sequel would eventually follow. Indeed, X-MEN proved to be the harbinger of the current trend of high budget superhero films based on the Marvel comics.  X-MEN UNITED is that rare sequel that both builds and improves upon what has gone on before in the first film.  Basically picking up where the original left off, things get off to a rollicking start when a strange blue-skinned mutant attempts to assassinate the President.  Later, it turns out that government agent William Stryker (Bryan Cox) is behind the attack in order to further a plot to destroy all mutants.  As a result, the heroic X-Men must join forces with old foe Magneto (Ian McKellen) to stop Stryker's plans.Like any sequel should be, X2 is a bigger, better, and more fun film than the original.  With much of the set-up already taken care of, the film starts off quickly and never lets go.  Most of the original cast reprise their roles and they never miss a beat. Hugh Jackman leads the way as the surly Wolverine, remaining a solid focus for the audience to identify with.  Patrick Stewart's Professor X and McKellen's Magneto again provide the film's philosophical center with their solid performances.  Compared to the last film, Halle Berry actually gets more to do as weather-witch Storm and she makes the most of it with some touching moments.

771244,A2BMUX71WMN56M,B0000BWVCJ,Herr Frog,"[2, 2]","I usually write reviews for more grown-up stuff than this, but the X-Men movies really moved me.  I loved this movie, and went back to the place where I once dreamt of having my own superpowers and flying around the backyard.I loved both X-Men movies, and enjoyed the 2nd one as much as the first.  This is the best attempt at rendering a comic book into a movie, bar none, as far as I am concerned.  The directing was marvelous, the events, scenes, fights, everything was so well coordinated and choreographed that it just felt very cohesive and coherent.  And unlike so many other attempts at making a comic book hero come to life, the spirit of the comic book has been carried onward faithfully, and very artistically.The original X-Men was the greatest comic book series going on in Marvel Comics, and was a work of art.  It was also my very favorite as a child, and watching the movie version, either I or II, really brings the whole X-Men experience back to life for me.  The X-men were a raw dose of the real substance of ""science fiction"" that was less respectable, and often more artistic.  And it was the artistic side that brought me back again and again.  The original comic book was drawn in an expressive fashion that really did something for me.  They did more than find better ways to say ""Blam!"" And the movie was true to that spirit.And as for the story and characters: The pathos of the outcast, the Macbeth-like role of the Wolverine, and the various mutants' ""powers,"" ancient magical powers dressed up as science; this is some of the stuff that made the X-Men so powerful an experience for any dejected 12 year-old with a quarter (like me) way back when.  And even now I think fondly of my childish fantasies of developing my native telepathic powers and joining the ranks of the X-Men, so those local boys wouldn't ever beat me up and steal my lunch money again. If I could have worked that out, I would have been able to spend a lot more playing Asteroids.It was also great seeing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos without her makeup for a little while.  Definitely the most gorgeous Russian bad-gal actress I have looked upon for a while.  She really steals the show in that skimpy blue outfit.I can't wait for X-Men III to come out, and I guess it should be beginning production in a early August.

""X2"" is a too busy and farfetched, but it keeps twisting, and it features a great villain in Styker. In theme and approach, ""X2"" is similar to the second and best instalment of the ""Star Trek"" series, ""Wrath of Khan"" -- ""X2"" features a large sacrifice from a major character, and serves as a launching pad for future instalments.

I was a sort of comic collector from 1980-90 and the X-MEN comics were always chock full o' great characters, complex stories, and great action.  Both movies have delivered those qualities and more.  It would be nice to see a comic book turned movie actually start a series instead of a few haphazard sequels that get sillier as realeased.  This movie rocks.  X-MEN was a nice intro for XAVIER's gifted students, in X2 the mutants really strut their stuff, both dramatically and with a fine showcase for their uncanny abilities.  Some great action set pieces highlight this crafted flick as well as a story that unlike most super hero movies is engaging and intelligent.  I can't wait for X3 to see what will happen next, how many sequels these days can you say that about?  Not many at all.

I think what hurt X-men 1 is that the special effects werent as good as X2 although the storyline was strong. From start to finish there was action, drama, mystery and storyline within storylines. I think the directors main goal with this was to make it watchable and &quot;easy to relate&quot; to someone who has never followed the Xmen series before. Being that I have (Also a big Xmen fan), I payed close attention to how close the charaters followed thier actual description in the comic books. There are so many underlying messages brought up by the story line like discrimination, faith, religion, Trust, and Humanity. The main one being discrimination which many people can relate to. The intro is one of the coolest parts of the movie that takes nightcrawler to a whole different dimension. Overall they took Xmen to a whole different level with this one. Special Effects, Story line, the in-depth conflicts shown within each character, and timing of it all makes for a good movie.

When the movie is based on characters and their development, it is easier to have a successful series.  Star Wars is one example of this; James Bond also avoided a set pattern.  The X-Men series is another example.As in the rest of the series, the theme is dealing with prejudice.  This movie has the most chilling human villain Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox), who creates a crisis for the purpose of achieving his ultimate goal:  ridding the earth of all mutants.  The good guy mutants and the bad guy mutants unite to save the mutants, but Magneto is just as ready to destroy all humans as Stryker is to destroy all mutants.  It is up to the X-Men to save the day.This movie gives fleeting glimpses of several of the characters, giving Pyro more of a role, while giving a brief scene with Kitty passing through walls.  It also gives a short introduction to Cyclops and Banshee.  The main new character is one of my two favorites, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming, doing a wonderful job).  (My other favorite, The Beast, has to wait to Part 3.)I found this movie more exciting than the first.  However, it had a few scenes I found unnecessary, including a couple of PG-13 rated sex scenes.  I'm also uncomfortable with men fighting women, which happened in both scenes, including a lengthy battle between Jackman's Wolverine and a woman.  As a result, I would not recommend this movie as highly as the first and the third.

It is not often that a sequel is actually better than the first movie, but this one definitely breaks the mold.  Casting Ian McKellan as Magneto was pure genius!

It was a good idea to show just how alienated and isolated the mutants are from the humans.

771253,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0000BWVCJ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This second opus is bringing the war inside the human camp because one military scientist who had had the chance, though not to his taste, of having a mutant son and who had manipulated him so much that  he had managed to take complete control of him, is provoking, or at least trying to, an open war of total destruction against the mutants. This time bad and good mutants unite to defeat that man though the bad mutants take over the game of the bad human and redirect the weapon from total destruction of mutants to total destruction of human beings. This drastic situation is saved in due time and just in time by the good mutants though the bad ones manage to escape and the good ones must sacrifice one of themselves to assure the escape. That will be essential later and it builds a promise because the death of a hero is always compensated by his or her resurrection, generally in that type of literature with an inverted personality. But the film is well built, the special effects are interesting, rich and at times funny. The dramatic tension is perfect and the President of the USA who was going to declare the state of emergency to take control of the mutants is informed by the good mutants about the actions of his mad scientist, and also head of some kind of national security, and we understand this President of the USA changes his ideas and convictions and moves towards a compromise with the mutants. But of course we know it can't last since the President was more or less forced to act that way and the bad mutants are still out there somewhere plotting evil.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,"Evil is among human beings, and mutants, alike",1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,1717,"['second', 'opus', 'bringing', 'war', 'human', 'camp', 'one', 'military', 'scientist', 'who', 'had', 'had', 'chance', 'not', 'taste', 'having', 'mutant', 'son', 'who', 'had', 'manipulated', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'managed', 'take', 'complete', 'control', 'provoking', 'least', 'trying', 'open', 'war', 'total', 'destruction', 'mutants', 'time', 'bad', 'good', 'mutants', 'unite', 'defeat', 'man', 'bad', 'mutants', 'take', 'game', 'bad', 'human', 'redirect', 'weapon', 'total', 'destruction', 'mutants', 'total', 'destruction', 'human', 'beings', 'drastic', 'situation', 'saved', 'due', 'time', 'just', 'time', 'good', 'mutants', 'bad', 'ones', 'manage', 'escape', 'good', 'ones', 'must', 'sacrifice', 'one', 'assure', 'escape', 'will', 'be', 'essential', 'later', 'promise', 'death', 'hero', 'always', 'compensated', 'resurrection', 'generally', 'type', 'literature', 'inverted', 'personality', 'film', 'well', 'built', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'interesting', 'rich', 'times', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'perfect', 'President', 'USA', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'declare', 'state', 'emergency', 'take', 'control', 'mutants', 'informed', 'good', 'mutants', 'actions', 'mad', 'scientist', 'also', 'head', 'kind', 'national', 'security', 'understand', 'President', 'USA', 'ideas', 'convictions', 'moves', 'towards', 'compromise', 'mutants', 'course', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'last', 'President', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'forced', 'act', 'way', 'bad', 'mutants', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'somewhere', 'plotting', 'evil.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

771258,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000BWVCJ,Jeffrey Leach,"[5, 5]","Goodness, there sure have been a lot of movies based on comic books coming out in the past few years. We've seen ""Spiderman"" and its sequel, ""Elektra,"" ""Daredevil,"" ""Sin City,"" ""Hellboy,"" ""The Punisher,"" and probably a few others I'm forgetting. Heck, we can expect to see new installments in the ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" franchises soon, too. Personally, I haven't seen any of the above listed films with the exception of the first Spiderman, and it's likely I won't see more than a couple of them any time soon. I'm not trying to bash comic books or anything like that, but for some reason I tend to shy away from films based on this medium. Why? I hear very bad things about many of these films, most of which involve complaints about how the films forego important things like plot and character development in favor of shock and awe special effects. If I remember correctly from my comic book reading days, most of the stories dealt heavily with superheroes faced with moral quandaries and personality problems that translated over into the real world. Not so in the movies. The emphasis here is on blowing stuff up and using the biggest CGI effects possible.There are exceptions: ""Spiderman"" did a good job focusing on the characters' problems. So did ""X-Men"" and ""X2: X-Men United."" I have seen these movies, and I liked all three of them. ""X2,"" however, is arguably the best of the lot. The film continues the story of the characters we saw in the first film--namely Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos)--while adding a few new faces. After the X-Men saved the world in the first film, not much changed regarding human/mutant relations. Normal people still freak out whenever they see someone shape change, produce fire out of thin air, or any of the other assorted abilities common to mutants. The opening sequences of ""X2"" do little to alleviate such fears. An attack on the White House by a mutant with the ability to teleport (Nightcrawler, played effectively by Alan Cumming) nearly costs the president his life. The result is a crackdown on mutants everywhere with the resurrection of the dreaded Mutant Registration Act, a draconian measure that will severely restrict the activities of mutants everywhere.The man in charge of carrying out the new act is General William Stryker (deliciously evil Brian Cox), a man whose new mission allows him to carry out his own personal vendetta against Xavier and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. I won't spoil the reasons behind the vendetta, but his official mission sees him launch an attack against Xavier's school in order to round up the freaks. Unfortunately, he picked a bad time to make an appearance--Wolverine is back from his soul searching and is ready to kick some serious you know what. While he assists in salvaging what he can from the fiasco at Xavier's pad, the rest of the X-Men are out and about trying to track down the mutant responsible for the attack on the White House. If they can find this person, they reason, they might be able to head off the impending crackdown. Of course, their mission soon discovers that Stryker's fingerprints are all over the place. Too, Magneto manages to escape from his plastic prison and, with the oddly alluring Mystique at his side, throws a few wrenches into the whole process. By the time the movie comes to an end, we've seen the overall storyline advance amidst an avalanche of mind-blowing special effects including but not limited to huge tornados, rushing walls of water, and whipsaw quick fight sequences. Fun stuff!Heartfelt thanks should go to director Bryan Singer for masterfully balancing the action and CGI with numerous character driven arcs. It's great to see fights and mutant powers blasting away at everything in sight, don't get me wrong, but it's more interesting to see how the characters develop. And in that department Singer and company do a good job. The whole human versus mutant conflict receives fresh treatment, as does Wolverine's eternal struggle to understand who he is and how he came to be. The latter is probably the most intriguing element in the storyline due to its relevancy. Who among us hasn't struggled to understand our identity at some point in life? Of course, most of us haven't been the subject of government experimentation that grafted metal to our bones and wiped our memories clean in the process, but you get the idea. And while the movie simplifies that theme so even the densest dolts in the audience will catch on, it's still an almost universal human issue that resonates with all of us. CGI and character dynamics aside, ""X2"" is a lot of fun if for no other reason than checking out all the babes. Halle Berry (not a favorite of mine), Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and Kelly Hu provide more than enough eye candy for us older ""kids"" in the audience.""X2: X-Men United"" has something for everyone. And check out the extras on the two-disc set! That's what I call a DVD! I won't waste time going over them in detail except to say that the sheer number of supplements guarantees a viewer can spend plenty of time exploring every aspect of this film's production process if he or she wishes to do so. If you haven't seen ""X2"" yet, prepare to be blown away. One hopes the next installment will surpass the previous two, but the absence of Singer behind the camera should cause some concerns. Oh well, even if the next one stinks we've still got these two great films to watch over and over again.",5,Fantastic!,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,5642,"['Goodness', 'sure', 'have', 'been', 'lot',

Professor Xavier sends is Senior pupils to track him down. When they do, they find that there is something very wrong about the whole situation.  Soon after, the school is attacked and the mutants get split up and venture across the country.  Magento, still imprisoned in a plastic cell, finds a way to escape and join up with Xavier's group.Everyone returns from the first movie and some other mutants from the long running comic series are introduced.  Colossus crashes into the story line, but is all too quickly shoved aside, a shame considering his popularity in the comic.  A young but brash Pyro comes on the scene with an obvious pre-disposition of becoming evil.  But the most impressive is Nightcrawler, played with complete bravada and emotion by Alan Cumming.  Brian Cox plays William Stryker, the Government scientist bent on destroying the mutants through his resources in the military.  He plays a bad guy so well you love to hate him.The story and characters are solid and riveting.  All returning actors play their roles with comfort and stride.  All are given plenty to do.  Along the way story lines weave in and out of one another.  The attraction between Jean Grey and Logan heats up, as well as with Rogue and Bobby (Iceman).  Storm and Nightcrawler form an obvious bond as she reassures him that he can belong in society while he sparks her desire to have faith in God.The action scenes are fantastic and brutal in some places, especially with Wolverine in full fighting mode, he doesn't care if he kills anyone.

I liked the first but after seeing this one I saw just how good the first one could have been. The first was basically just a small introduction. Now that all the characters were introduced we have a sequel that's all action and has no time for introduction. The result is one [heck] of a ride, this film gave me the feel that I was actually watching the cartoon series from the 90's that I loved. I can't say the first film really gave me that feel at all eventhough I did like it.I have a problem with the fact that they didn't give Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike a history. In the comic book they were ex lovers. Deathstrike blames Wolverine for the death of her scientist father in the comic, you don't get that here. Instead she's just a mutant being controlled by the evil mutant hater General Striker (Brian Coxx ""the original Hannibal Lector from Manhunter""). I also disapointed that the first film didn't give Wolverine and Sabortooth a history as well. I was hoping they'd bring Sabortooth back so they could have Wolverine figure out that his past connects to Sabortooth.The first also was short, it spent most of it's time introducing the characters when not all of them were even there. In this sequel we don't get Beast or Gambit but we do get Night Crawler. Alan Cummings ""Spy Kids"", pulls off the role just awesome. The special effects that make it so he can appear where ever he wants are just great. The make-up for that character are well done as well. Colosis who is also another popular X-Man has a short but cool cameo where he saves some mutant children at the school.This film is a lot more like the comic book than the first and should do many X-Men fans proud. The whole Jean Grey sub-plot will surprise but delight most X-Men fans such as myself. I don't wanna give anything away but I find that with Jean Grey the film does have sort of a Star Trek 2 ending. Part 3 already is giving me a Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock sorta feel and it's not even out yet. Part 3 will probably be largely surrounded around Jean Grey's character just like Star Trek 3 was with Spock. I can't wait for that though. I don't wanna give anything but for any X-Men fans that know of the Phoenix saga you are gonna love this. I wouldn't mind seeing a new Mutant villain come around for the 3rd one as well though. I'm dieing to see Juggernaut for instance. Apocolyse would be cool as well. X-Men 2 is another strong movie for Marvel and could possibly be the best.

771264,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0000BWVCJ,Joe Sherry,"[0, 0]","Bryan Singer should be proud of his work on X2.  Not only did he have to keep the fans of the first movie happy, he had to continue to please the fans of comics happy, keep Marvel happy and at the same time he had to improve upon the first X-Men movie.  Oh, and he also had to make the studio a lot of money to recover for the investment of making the movie.  No small task, for any of it.  What does Bryan Singer do?  He makes a better movie and improves on all aspects of the first X-Men film.The movie starts with an amazing attack on the President by Nightcrawler (a teleporter).  Throughout the movie, Nightcrawler was the most interesting character with the best mutant talent (as far as how it plays out on screen), and the action involving Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) was just so visually impressive that I just had to sit back in near awe at how impressive his scenes were.  The first one was the most impressive, but Nightcrawler is what helped make this movie as good as it ended up being.With this attack on the President, General Stryker (Brian Cox) takes this as his opportunity to attack the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters (AKA the base for the X-Men and a training school for mutants).  At the time of the attack, Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen), and Storm (Halle Berry) are all away from the school.  This only leaves Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) left to defend the students.  This attack gives Wolverine to really shine and show why he is one of the toughest members of the X-Men.Magneto (Ian McKellan) is still in his glass prison and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) is working to free him.  I don't want to keep repeating myself, but this is yet another very impressive scene.  The attack on the school forces the mutants (X-Men and Magneto) to band together to fight off the threat of General Stryker and Lady Deathstryke (Kelly Hu).  Stryker is working to rid the world (or at least America) of mutants.This is one of the better comic book movies that have come out recently.  While it may not be as good as Batman (1989) or the first Superman, this is better than most.  There is so much more action than the first X-Men movie and it sets up a sequel (probably the third and final X-Men film that Bryan Singer makes).  This is much darker than the first movie and is worth watching for fans of action movies, comics, or just the X-Men.  It is a lot of fun to watch and I'm very glad that I went to see this one.",5,better than the first one,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,2486,"['Bryan', 'Singer', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'work', 'X2', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'have', 'keep', 'fans', 'first', 'movie', 'happy', 'had', 'continue', 'please', 'fans', 'comics', 'happy', 'keep', 'Marvel', 'happy', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'improve', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'Oh', 'also', 'had', 'make', 'studio', 'lot', 'money', 'recover', 'investment', 'making', 'movie', 'No', 'small', 'task', 'What', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'do', 'better', 'movie', 'improves', 'aspects', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film.The', 'movie', 'amazing', 'attack', 'President', 'Nightcrawler', 'teleporter', 'movie', 'Nightcrawler', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'best', 'mutant', 'talent', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'out', 'screen', 'action', 'involving', 'Nightcrawler', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'visually', 'impressive', 'just', 'had', 'sit', 'back', 'near', 'awe', 'how', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'were', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'most', 'impressive', 'Nightcrawler', 'what', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'ended', 'up', 'being.With', 'attack', 'President', 'General', 'Stryker', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'opportunity', 'attack', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Youngsters', 'AKA', 'base', 'X-Men', 'training', 'school', 'mutants', 'time', 'attack', 'Professor', 'X', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Cyclops', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Jannsen', 'Storm', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'are', 'away', 'school', 'only', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'left', 'defend', 'students', 'attack', 'Wolverine', 'really', 'shine', 'show', 'why', 'one', 'toughest', 'members', 'X-Men.Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'still', 'glass', 'prison', 'Mystique', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'Stamos', 'working', 'free', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'keep', 'repeating', 'yet', 'very', 'impressive', 'scene', 'attack', 'school', 'mutants', 'X-Men', 'Magneto', 'band', 'together', 'fight', 'off', 'threat', 'General', 'Stryker', 'Lady', 'Deathstryke', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'Stryker', 'working', 'rid', 'world', 'least', 'America', 'mutants.This', 'one', 'better', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Batman', '1989', 'first', 'Superman', 'better', 'most', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'up', 'sequel', 'probably', 'third', 'final', 'X-Men', 'film', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'much', 'darker', 'first', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'fans', 'action', 'movies', 'comics', 'just', 'X-Men', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'went', 'see', 'one']",N/A

Brian Singer knew what worked and what didn't in the first film and made sure this one had the kinks worked out. Almost all the characters have enough screentime to get thier personalities across. Surprisingly, the character ""Nightcrawler"" comes off as both more capable and more sympathetic than his four-color counterpart.Ian McKellen once again gives an outstanding performance, managing at times to overshadow every other actor on screen with him... even Patrick Stewart, which is saying something. Stewart manages to have his own spotlioght moment however at the end, showing that even the most peaceful mutant can be pushed only so far.Knowing the books, I have a pretty good idea what the ending means in terms of what the next film will cover; I hope Singer & Co. are up to the challange.Someone mentioned spin-offs of the characters and other teams might be forthcoming.

To his credit Singer does an admirable job delving into intolerance with the X-Men mutants providing a fantastic allegory with racial and religious intolerance. And of course Patrick Stewart is brilliant once more as Professor Xavier, with his old friend and nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen), assuming a more important role in this installment, and McKellen's portrayal nearly as riveting as his Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. However, Alan Cummings almost steals every scene he's in as Nightcrawler. And I agree with a previous reviewer that it is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, which provides the emotional heart of this film.

Rouge (Anna Paquin) and Bobby Drake a.k.a. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) seem to be having a beautiful relationship together and Logan a.k.a. Wolverine (Huge Jackman) is still struggling to discover his true past and to find out on something on a man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) who made his adamantium skeleton and claws, now after the threat at the white-house it seems humans seem to hate mutants more. Now Stryker has terrorized the X-men mansion and kidnaps some of the mutant students including Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) himself so he can learn the secrets of the computer Cerebro so that Stryker can make a version of Cerebro himself to harm all mutants. Now it's up to Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and now teamed up with Magneto (Ian Mckellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) to try to save both humanity and mutants alike from this new menace.A sequel that surpasses on a great original but makes it better.

The budget is obviously bigger as we see the truly amazing special effects in the beginning of the film, and though the action never quite again reaches its high-point as in the beginning, it sets the film up for other non-stop action sequences, just like the James Bond movies are known for doing.But that's not all ""X-Men 2,"" or ""X2"" as the posters abbreviate, is all about. It has an important human element that adds to the pure, non-stop, full-blooded action-spectaculars throughout the film. The cast is bigger, the budget is bigger, the story is bigger, and the action is plentiful. Teenagers will enjoy the action side, and adults will probably enjoy the human side to the story. It seamlessly combines both these two elements/techniques even more than the original film did. I didn't expect to enjoy this film more than the first, but I must say I did.It reunites the old cast for a continuation of the struggle for mutants and humans to live together in the same world.[...] ""X-Men"" was an excellent comic-book adaptation, in more ways than one, and ""X-Men 2"" is only better. It contains more action than ""Spider-Man"" and its human factor is even more active than it was in the original, which is ironic, since the original was praised for having both action and human attributes.The cast is first-class, but the real scene-stealer, just like in the original, is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The Aussie actor disguises his accent with a rough American one, just like British chap Bob Hoskins did in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"". If the filmmakers want a new James Bond after Pierce Brosnan, they need look no farther, because though he may not look the part in this film, Jackman can look very suave and proper (see ""Kate and Leopold""), and is my top choice for the next Bond.Comic book films are usually hit-or-miss. They're never in between. ""X-Men"" was an unexpected hit, but more than that, a good unexpected hit. It wasn't all hype. It was smart, action-packed and hat a great character side to it. Like I said before, ""X-Men 2"" improves upon all this and is the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor.I expect ""X-Men 2"" to break some box office records, and unlike other films, I can honestly say that it deserves it.",4,Better than the first!,1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,2340,"['[', ']', 'P', 'sure', 'X2', 'right', 'track', 'sequel', 'anything', 'better', 'budget', 'obviously', 'bigger', 'see', 'truly', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'beginning', 'film', 'action', 'never', 'quite', 'again', 'high-point', 'beginning', 'film', 'up', 'other', 'non-stop', 'action', 'sequences', 'just', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'are', 'known', 'doing.But', 'not', 'X-Men', '2', 'X2', 'posters', 'abbreviate', 'important', 'human', 'element', 'pure', 'non-stop', 'full-blooded', 'action-spectaculars', 'film', 'cast', 'bigger', 'budget', 'bigger', 'story', 'bigger', 'action', 'plentiful', 'Teenagers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'action', 'side', 'adults', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'human', 'side', 'story', 'seamlessly', 'two', 'elements/techniques', 'even', 'more', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'first', 'must', 'say', 'did.It', 'old', 'cast', 'continuation', 'struggle', 'mutants', 'humans', 'live', 'together', 'same', 'world.', '[', 'X-Men', 'was', 'excellent', 'comic-book', 'adaptation', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'X-Men', '2', 'only', 'better', 'more', 'action', 'Spider-Man', 'human', 'factor', 'even', 'more', 'active', 'was', 'original', 'ironic', 'original', 'was', 'praised', 'having', 'action', 'human', 'attributes.The', 'cast', 'first-class', 'real', 'scene-stealer', 'just', 'original', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'Aussie', 'actor', 'accent', 'rough', 'American', 'one', 'just', 'British', 'chap', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'did', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'need', 'look', 'farther', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'part', 'film', 'Jackman', 'can', 'look', 'very', 'suave', 'proper', 'see', 'Kate', 'Leopold', 'top', 'choice', 'next', 'Bond.Comic', 'book', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'hit-or-miss', ""'re"", 'never', 'X-Men', 'was', 'unexpected', 'hit', 'more', 'good', 'unexpected', 'hit', 'was', ""n't"", 'hype', 'was', 'smart', 'action-packed', 'great', 'character', 'side', 'said', 'X-Men', '2', 'improves', 'rare', 'sequel', 'better', 'predecessor.I', 'expect', 'X-Men', '2', 'break', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'honestly', 'say']",N/A

The film starts off with a good James Bond stlye opening (an action sequence). Then the film continues rapidly with great action, some suspense and a few laughs.Director Brian Singer was able to out do himself. I'll admit I'm not a really big comic book fan. As well as I don't like that many comic books that make it to the big screen. Such as Spiderman/Daredevil. I just saw X-Men about three days ago and I thought it was pretty interesting but to short. I liked how everything seemed like it came right from the comic books and Tv shows which I remember watching as a child. It seemed like the new comic book series that would replace the Batman saga. The film was dark creepy and extrodinary all in one.Now for X2 X-Men United. This film picked up right where the first one left off. It was nice to see a sequal that actually blended in with it's prequel. The action was better. The story was better. The characters were better, and the whole concept is much bigger. More laughs for action, and for of the X-Men's Jet. The effects were all right. It looks like Brian Singer learned how to make better 3D graphics this time. The film does have it's downers such as how they some-what rush through everything. As well as it would be good to watch the first film before you see the second so that you can remember exactly were Wolverine is in the begining, and what the President is talking about with Senator Kelly. Lucky for me I saw the movie just a few days before, I saw the second one so it really helped. By the way, if there are any soundtrack fans wanting to know if the music is good it's great because this time around it's composed and conducted by John Ottman (Lake Placid). I recommend this film to any body that would like to have a good time at the movies... so enjoy.",4,X2 - X-treme Film of the Year,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,1864,"['X2', 'X-men', 'United', 'was', 'superb', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', 'film', 'good', 'James', 'Bond', 'stlye', 'opening', 'action', 'sequence', 'Then', 'film', 'rapidly', 'great', 'action', 'suspense', 'few', 'laughs.Director', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'was', 'able', 'out', 'do', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'big', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'As', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'many', 'comic', 'books', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'Such', 'Spiderman/Daredevil', 'just', 'saw', 'X-Men', 'three', 'days', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'short', 'liked', 'how', 'everything', 'seemed', 'came', 'right', 'comic', 'books', 'Tv', 'shows', 'remember', 'watching', 'child', 'seemed', 'new', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'would', 'replace', 'Batman', 'saga', 'film', 'was', 'dark', 'creepy', 'extrodinary', 'one.Now', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'film', 'picked', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'sequal', 'actually', 'blended', 'prequel', 'action', 'was', 'better', 'story', 'was', 'better', 'characters', 'were', 'better', 'whole', 'concept', 'much', 'bigger', 'More', 'laughs', 'action', 'X-Men', 'Jet', 'effects', 'were', 'right', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'learned', 'how', 'make', 'better', '3D', 'graphics', 'time', 'film', 'have', 'downers', 'such', 'how', 'some-what', 'rush', 'everything', 'As', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'watch', 'first', 'film', 'see', 'second', 'can', 'remember', 'exactly', 'were', 'Wolverine', 'begining', 'what', 'President', 'talking', 'Senator', 'Kelly', 'Lucky', 'saw', 'movie', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'saw', 'second', 'one', 'really', 'helped', 'way', 'are', 'soundtrack', 'fans', 'wanting', 'know', 'music', 'good', 'great', 'time', 'composed', 'conducted', 'John', 'Ottman', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'recommend', 'film', 'body', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'so', 'enjoy']",N/A

Usually sequels are never as good as the originals but this one I think is a step ahead. The groundwork had already been laid in X-Men so this movie could just jump right of the ground into the story. This movie has a great deal about Wolverine trying to figure out who he is and how he got his adamantium skeleton. Some new characters are also introduced, including Nightcrawler and Deathstrike. The highlight of the movie is definitely the Wolverine - Deathstrike battle at the end. I think its the best scene out of all the X-Men movies. Another cool scene is when Wolverine steals Cyclops's Mazda RX-8 which is a really cool car. I do think this movie could have used more Cyclops in it, as he is one of my favorite X-Men characters.

Although many folks might deride the paper and ink monthly series, the comic book is really an American art form, and one that's difficult to turn into a film.  X2 did well, picking up nicely on the heels of X-Men -- more mutant hatred and fear and welcome Nightcrawler.  He is my favorite!  The scene where Nightcrawler busts into the White House is superb -- honestly, the best bit of action you'll see in all the Marvel movies thus far!!!  But be warned -- although X2 is not as dark as Daredevil or sullen and sci fi as the Hulk, it has moments which may frighten the kids.  The scene where those paramilitary dudes are breaking into the school for gifted children is all too realistic a threat today.  But its just a movie. . . or a comic, or both.X2 is a little more grown up than Spiderman.  There is less romance than that movie too.  You will love this movie if you love the X-men.  And if you don't know them, it will help you get to know them.  You'll learn more about Wolverine and his past, and see more of Magneto and his henchwoman.  The interaction between the whole group is outstanding.  And if you don't like mutants, you will still enjoy the action and story of X2.Two questions you might ask yourself -- will there be an X2.5 release with the bigger bonus features as they did with the first movie?

Wolverine is ok X Men First Class or as I call it First Nap can kiss my a  *  *. Now X2 does what I want it to it. It is the closest we will get to the animated X Men show from the early to late 90's another reason I like this movie is cause it doesn't just focus on Wolverine as much more characters have a story. So this maybe another long review-retrospective. Directed by Bryan Singer again. All the main cast is back Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janseen, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romjin & Anna Paquin. The newer cast consists of Brian Cox as Colonel William Stryker, Kelly Hu as Deathstrike & Alan Cumming as Kurt Vagner aka Nightcrawler. The story is Nightcrawler goes to The Whithouse tries to sneaks into The Oval Office it looks as if he is going to kills The P resident but he is shot by a Secret Service Agent but he left a note on knife that says Mutant Freedom Now. Meanwhile we learn that Jean Grey is having problems controlling her telepathic powers & is having a series of headachs. Wolverine has returned & is no closer to finding out his past. Then you're introduced to Colone William Stryker who has this ambition to kill all mutants. He he's been having Magneto drugged & he told Stryker where The Mansion is at. Mystique who has been posinhg as Senator Robert Kelly finds out where Magneto is being held at  as well as Stryker's plans. Jean Grey & Storm go to Boston to find Nightcrawler & Professor X & Cyclops go to see Magneto who is in prison. Wolverine stays behind to take care of the kids. Colonel Stryker has Xavier captured as well as Cyclops with the help of Deatstike. Meanwhile the mansion is under attack by Stryker's men. They have to get out of there Stryker's men manage to take some of the kids Wolverine runs into Stryker who starts talking to him the rest of the mutants are esacping Bobby puts a block of ice in front of Stryker & his men. They escape & take Cycolps's car. I did laugh at the part where Pyro turns on the radio & N Sync is playing Hugh Jackman's reaction is priceless. They get to Boston where Bobby lives 1 thing leads to another Bobby tells his parents about him being a mutant his brother who I guess is jealous calls the cops saying they are being held hostage. The Cops arrive Wolverine is shot in the head Pyro goes off & starts attacking the cops with fire blowing up cop cars Rouge grabs a hold of his leg & stops him. The Blackbird arrives they get out of there. Then they are followed by some Air Force Fighter Jets Storm uses her powers to cause the piolets to eject but 1 of them fire missiles at The Blackbird Jean causes 1 of the missiles to explode & tried to destroy the other 1 but it grazed the end of The Blackbird. Rouge is pulled out of The Blackbird & Noightctrawler teleports out of there to get her & bring her back Colonel Strker has Professor X & Cyclops who is being reeducted as he calls it. Stryker has his Son Jason who is drugged & totally messed up control The Professor he has had a 2nd Cerebro built & is going to have all the mutants killed. Magneto escaped from prison with Mystique's help they form a temporary alliance with The X Men. Through the reading of Nightcrawler's mind Jean finds out that Stryker's headquarters is in a Dam. Mystique sneaks in transformed as Wolverine she is caught she beats up the guards & allows the others to get in. Wolverine goes after Stryker he gets in a fight with Deathstrike & this fight was really good I wish it could've been longer but I liked what we hgot. Magneto, Mystique & Jean Grey go to get The Professor but they're attaked by Cyclops who has been brain washed. Jean tells them to go on  she faces Cyclops manages to beat him when she forces his own blast back at him & breaks the mind control that he was under. The Dam is about to collapse. Wolverine stops Stryker from escaping he messes him up pretty good Stryker pleads with him. He tells him he was  the 1 that wanted it done to him. Magneto finds where The Professor is at kills the rest of Stryker's guards Mystique turns into Stryker she tells Jason to kill all the humans. Magneto & Mystique leave & take Stryker's helicopter Pyro decides to join with them. With the help of Nightcrawler Storm goes into The Cerebro room saves The Professor. They try to escape The Blackbird is having problems taking off The Dam has burst & is flooding the area also killing Stryker. Jean gets out she uses her powers to stop the flood to allow enough time for the others to get out of there. So that meant we were going to get The Phoneix stroyling only not what me or anybody else wanted. The X Men go to The Whitehouse & tell The President that Humans & Mutants must work together to stop a war. Professor X supplies The President up of what Stryker was really doing. That's pretty much the movie. Now if I didn't do a good job explaining the plot in my review & retrospective then I'm sorry about that. Not much wrong with it other than Wolverine getting focused on but not as much as part 1 & part 3. BGut the cast is great & worked well yet again. Good fight scenes very good set up for The Phoenix stroyline which they should've done better. Bryan Singer did a very good job. Patrick Stewart was great again. Ian McKellen was great. Hugh Jackman did a really good job. Famke Janseen was good. Halle Berry was decent. Brian Cox did a good job. Kelly Hu served her purpose have a really good fight scene. Alan Cumming was good. Rebecca Romjin was fine again. Anna Paquin did fine again. Not much else to say it's a solid sequel better than the 1st. I was thinking about reviewing X Men The Last Stand I won't I'll save it for 06 in film.

Now, all main characters are already introduced to those people who watched the first one, but have not a close relation to the comics.At first, I thought X-2 would focus mainly on Wolverine, but that&#65533;s not true. Sure, in the moives Wolverine is still the most popular character, but he&#65533;s not alone. Every major mutant character has the chance to be a good time on screen. Every one of them is given dimension, I could see they were well-developed for screen. Even so, X-2 is not, as may happen in other similar situations, a show-case for every hero to automaticaly and pointlessly display what he/she is capable of. Every mutant&#65533;s actions is made acording to a good script, and Brian Singer&#65533;s competent direction is able to give credibility to the movie (of course, credibility based on the premises of such a movie).I said the scrip is good. There are no boring fight scenes every two minutes, I could find no major sequence-continuity mistakes, no rushed conclusions, and what is best, the story doesn&#65533;t treat the viewer as an idiot. The only flaw I noticed is that the movie starts a little too fast, but that may be one more reason to keep the eyes on the screen. There are some funny moments too, mainly with Ian McKellen and his out-of-date uniform.Speaking of Ian McKellen, pay attention to the casting: we don&#65533;t see this reunion of stars every day. McKellen, Patrick Stewart (the perfect Xavier), Brian Cox (as the common enemy of the mutants, that&#65533;s why the title &#65533;X-Men united&#65533;), Hugh Jackman, Allan Cumming (amazing as the dark, catholic-fervorous Nightcrawler), everyone of them exeperienced, competent actors. And the women: all of them beautiful and talented: Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen (her best role so far), Rebecca Romijn (remember to close your mouth in the scene where she is not wearing make-up).Not to mention the great visual effects.

Yet before going off half-cocked and just throwing a sequel together, several key elements must first come together. The first thing that is key to most sequels' success is getting the original film's cast back together, once that is accomplished a great script must be on hand that equals, and hopefully surpasses the original film's story, and third, the budget must always be better, especially for a film of this magnitude.  Luckily, Fox Studios and Bryan Singer accomplished all of this, and so audiences worldwide were presented with an incredible sequel with ""X2: X-Men United"".""X2: X-Men United"" basically picks up where ""X-Men"" left off, Wolverine is still searching for where he comes from, Magneto is still locked inside his plastic prison, Mystique is masquerading as Senator Kelly, and Professor Xavier and the rest of the X-Men are trying to ensure peace between humans and mutants.  This time though, the threat to humanity is not solely evil mutants, this time the threat is humanity, as a renegade general named, Stryker (Brian Cox), is determined to see all mutants dead or dying, and if some normal people get in the way, so be it.  The X-Men must gather together and team-up with Magneto and Mystique to stop this mutant massacre or all hope will be lost.""X2: X-Men United"" gave audiences everything they loved about the original film, and more.  More action, an even bigger, more dramatic story, more special effects, and more mutants.  In ""X2: X-Men United"" audiences were introduced to the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), also Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro were given more screen time, and several other recognizable mutants made cameos; such as, Colossus, Siren, and Kitty Pryde.""X2: X-Men United"" simply put, was just an incredible film, and built brilliantly on what ""X-Men"" had started.

I love the X-Men comics, I loved the first movie and I love Hugh Jackman. Anyway, I thought that this was the perfect sequel to the first movie. The first one was basically an introduction of concepts and characters. Setting the stage, so to speak. I am so glad they didn't reiterate issues in the second one to familiarize the audience with information covered in the first movie. It's definitely not a sequel that can be seen without seeing its predecessor. I loved everything about this movie. The special effects were awesome-especially Nightcrawler's ""bamf"" smoke. I loved the developement of Mystique's character- I always thought she was certainly Magneto's best ally- Sabretooth was a massive screwup who couldn't be trusted with the most simple of tasks. I don't think there's a single thing in the first movie that he did right. Anyway, Mystique got the job done time and again. Another character that I think was developed excellently in X2 was Jean Grey. In the first movie I sensed the depth to her character, her lack of self-esteem and frustration with Scott's overprotectiveness, but in X2 you could really see where her character was going. I can't wait to see her Phoenix persona in X3. Oh, and I thought Bruce Davison did a great job acting as Mystique acting as Senator Kelly. I loved the cameos by Colossus and Siren.

771295,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0000BWVCJ,K. Driscoll,"[9, 9]","When taking into account all the comic book movies that have hit the theater recently this may sound like a bold statement, but really it's not.  This may be a large grossing sub-genre but it isn't really that many movies we're talking about.  With X2 though, I'm inclined to go even further and say it's one of the best sci-fi action films of all time...seriously.  In terms of strictly comic book movies, it's simply either this or Batman Begins.  I say X2 wins even in that comparison, but I'm certainly willing to accept the opposite view.The film opens with a brilliant introduction to a crucial character, the German teleporter Nightcrawler who looks like a little blue demon but possesses an intense devotion to Catholicism, and his introduction does not serve to assist in painting him as a hero.  More of an anti-hero I guess.  I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't actually seen it but X2 opens with one of the more memorable action sequences of recent date and the film contains three more specific sequences that are just as good.  Magneto's inevitable escape from his plastic prison is one of them.One of the other memorable scenes sets up the real storyline for X2 quite nicely and introduces us to other mutant heroes in the process.  William Stryker, an inventive military man, is motivated by his personal experience with mutant-kind to actually organize an assault on Charles Xavier's school for mutants.  He wishes to gain access to the mutant tracking device called Cerebro and destroy all of them.  His teams' assault is truely great action-filmmaking. The X-Men and Magneto, with his loosely forming band of mutants who agree with his politics on how to respond to humanity, find a common enemy in Stryker.  The relationship established between Charles and Magneto in the first film is really important here as younger mutants develop and choose sides.  I have to say, if I were in their predicament I may certainly be swayed by Magneto's extremism.  The character developement here for supporting roles is important to note.  Mystique and Pyro are really great villains here with massive emotion behind their actions and it's never over-stated, but it enhances the meaning and consequences to action sequences so well.The other incredible action scene is when Bobby Drake's family calls the cops on him and his new mutant friends.  There are enough under-stated layers in this scene and the characters; Wolverine, Rogue, Bobby and Pyro, are still consistent.  The police show up and Pyro reveals his wrath.  I always get excited for that scene even though I know he's wrong in his reaction.  I mentioned four action sequences but the fun doesn't end there.  Lady Deathstryke, who has been brainwashed by Stryker, and Wolverine have a great fight scene. Other scenes during the climax are just as impressive and all the while we are given enough tid-bits of so many characters that we still manage to care and even get a bit surprised near the end.  It's a shame this wasn't pulled off in the third film.X2 is unique in the sense that the plot is secondary and the film's primary operative is to develop the characters for more climactic stories.  I think the screenplay succeeds in this sense but overall the screenplay (written by voice actor David Hayter) is not one of the film's strengths and can require a more robust imagination to really appreciate.  Overall though, within the context of a complete trilogy, X2 is nearly perfect.",5,Possibly the Greatest Comic Book Movie Ever,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,3468,"['When', 'taking', 'account', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'have', 'hit', 'theater', 'recently', 'may', 'sound', 'bold', 'statement', 'really', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'large', 'grossing', 'sub-genre', ""n't"", 'really', 'many', 'movies', ""'re"", 'talking', 'X2', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'go', 'even', 'further', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'films', 'time', 'seriously', 'terms', 'strictly', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'simply', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'say', 'X2', 'wins', 'even', 'comparison', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'willing', 'accept', 'opposite', 'view.The', 'film', 'brilliant', 'introduction', 'crucial', 'character', 'German', 'teleporter', 'Nightcrawler', 'who', 'little', 'blue', 'demon', 'intense', 'devotion', 'Catholicism', 'introduction', 'not', 'serve', 'assist', 'painting', 'hero', 'More', 'anti-hero', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'actually', 'seen', 'X2', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'action', 'sequences', 'recent', 'date', 'film', 'three', 'more', 'specific', 'sequences', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Magneto', 'inevitable', 'escape', 'plastic', 'prison', 'one', 'them.One', 'other', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'up', 'real', 'storyline', 'X2', 'quite', 'nicely', 'other', 'mutant', 'heroes', 'process', 'William', 'Stryker', 'inventive', 'military', 'man', 'motivated', 'personal', 'experience', 'mutant-kind', 'actually', 'organize', 'assault', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'school', 'mutants', 'gain', 'access', 'mutant', 'tracking', 'device', 'called', 'Cerebro', 'destroy', 'teams', 'assault', 'truely', 'great', 'action-filmmaking', 'X-Men', 'Magneto', 'loosely', 'forming', 'band', 'mutants', 'who', 'agree', 'politics', 'how', 'respond', 'humanity', 'find', 'common', 'enemy', 'Stryker', 'relationship', 'established', 'Charles', 'Magneto', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'important', 'here', 'younger', 'mutants', 'develop', 'choose', 'sides', 'have', 'say', 'were', 'predicament', 'may', 'certainly', 'be', 'swayed', 'Magneto', 'extremism', 'character', 'developement', 'here', 'supporting', 'roles', 'important', 'note', 'Mystique', 'Pyro', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'villains', 'here', 'massive', 'emotion', 'actions', 'never', 'over-stated', 'meaning', 'consequences', 'action', 'sequences', 'so', 'other', 'incredible', 'action', 'scene', 'when', 'Bobby', 'Drake', 'family', 'cops', 'new', 'mutant', 'friends', 'are', 'enough', 'under-stated', 'layers', 'scene', 'characters', 'Wolverine', 'Rogue', 'Bobby', 'Pyro', 'are', 'still', 'consistent', 'police', 'show', 'up', 'Pyro', 'wrath', 'always', 'get', 'excited', 'scene', 'even', 'know', 'wrong', 'reaction', 'mentioned', 'four', 'action', 'sequences', 'fun', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'Lady', 'Deathstryke', 'who', 'been', 'brainwashed', 'Stryker', 'Wolverine', 'have', 'great', 'fight', 'scene', 'Other', 'scenes', 'climax', 'are', 'just', 'impressive', 'are', 'given', 'enough', 'tid-bits', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'still', 'manage', 'care', 'even', 'get', 'bit', 'surprised', 'end', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'pulled', 'off', 'third', 'film.X2', 'unique', 'sense', 'plot', 'secondary', 'film', 'primary', 'operative', 'develop', 'characters', 'more', 'climactic', 'stories', 'think', 'screenplay', 'sense', 'screenplay', 'written', 'voice', 'actor', 'David', 'Hayter', 'not', 'one', 'film', 'strengths', 'can', 'require', 'more', 'robust', 'imagination', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Overall', 'context', 'complete', 'trilogy', 'X2', 'nearly', 'perfect']",N/A

Unlike most reviewers, I didn't think this film was any better than the first.  I do believe that it is a good film in its own right.  The first sequence, the attack on the White House, is by far the best sequence of the movie.  Nightcrawler was one of my favorite X-men growing up.  I also enjoyed the fact that they included his deep Catholic faith.  The comic actually toyed with this character becoming a priest.Overall, the action sequences in this film were great.  The Deathstryke/Wolverine battle was one of the most violent sequences I've seen in comic-to-screen adaptation.  It was more violent than all of &quot;Daredevil.&quot;  Wolverine came out of his shell in this movie by racking up a huge bodycount.As far as the story goes, it played out very well and very evenly.  It was just as solid as the first flick and if you enjoyed the first one, this one will not let you down.  The pacing of the movie is quite swift, which could cause a non-comic fan to lose track of some of the characters and their abilities.  The ending was left wide open and if you do follow the comic, you know that something special will be rising in the inevitable part three.A good action movie with a solid story and brilliant effects.

Not one of Cumming's best performances, but the makeup was so challenging that I don't mind much.  The film's opening scene, Nightcrawler's failed assassination attempt, is one of the best scenes in the franchise.Ian McKellen is excellent as Magneto, and I liked Patrick Stewart as Professor X.  Storm's hairstyle is better here than in the other movies, though Scott and Jean are still annoying.The part near the end where Wolverine chooses to live in the present rather than dwell in the past was cheesy, with him carrying that kid in a bit of too-blatant symbolism; but whatever.

771304,A16X61RLY1YJL7,B0000BWVCJ,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[3, 6]","""X2 X-Men United"" is, simply put, an exhilarating and exciting follow up to the first movie.  Cartoons and comic books aside, as a theatrical/DVD release, this movie entertains as much or more than the first one.  Yes, many a fan of those cartoons and comic books are reeling from the major differences and those nuances left out of the movies but, just for a minute, take a look at this film and its predecessor from a completely open perspective and you will clearly see that this film has all of the elements that make for a successful action/adventure movie and yes, it does have a plot and that plot is very well thought out.One of the better aspects of this film and the first is that there are elements that were set up in the first film that weren't paid off in that film but are paid off here such as; Wolverine and his mysterious past and Jean Grey's future...  Along with those payoffs, there are some great new character arcs that are set up in this outstanding film.The entirety of the cast from the first film makes their return in this film and there are some great new additions to the cast of actors/characters.  Long time fans of Star Trek are most assuredly familiar with Patrick Stewart and his exceptional acting abilities and, just as in the first film, it's wonderful to see him on screen with Famke Janssen, who most will recognize as Kamala from one of Star Trek The Next Generation's best episodes.  Ian McKellen, most recently of ""The Lord of the Rings"" fame makes a return appearance as Magneto and performs to his wonderful standards.The ever beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos performs brilliantly as Mystique just as Halle Berry does with Storm and I'm sure taking a huge cut in pay.  New to cast and series is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and his performance is astonishing to say the least.  Hugh Jackman has to be one of the luckiest men in the world when considering how many takes it might've taken when he has Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Halle Berry and Famke Janssen all portraying an attempted seduction of Wolverine...I've never watched any other films that Bryan Singer has directed but with this and the first X-Men movie, one can definitely tell that this director has a long future in directing action films.The Premise:A teleporting mutant makes an attempt on the life of the President, right in the oval office after easily wading through the Secret Service, but he stops short of killing the President and disappears from the White House.  Not long thereafter, we're reintroduced to the X-Men and they're after the teleporting mutant who attempted to take out the President and Wolverine's makes his return.  Unbeknownst to them though, William Stryker, who is played exceptionally well by Brian Cox, is a government agent who has plans to eliminate all of the mutants on the planet...What follows from there is one of the best action/adventure genre movies that I've ever watched.  I would highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films from this genre, whether you're into the comics or not.  I personally have never read them and have followed the characters quite easily as the producers and the director have gone out of their way to ensure that those of us that don't follow the X-Men regularly will have no problem following the film.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Full-Length Commentary with Director Bryan Singer and Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, ASC-Full-Length Commentary with the Writers and Producers-""Nightcrawler Attack"" Interactive Multi-Angle Scene Study-""Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal"" In-Depth, Behind-the Scenes Exploration-""The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men"" The Ultimate Making-Of Documentary-Extraordinary X2 Featurettes:*""The Secret Origin of X-Men"" A Complete Anthology*""Nightcrawler Reborn"" The Adventure Before X2*""Introducing the Incredible Nightcrawler"" Character Study & More-11 Deleted/Extended Scenes-Still Galleries-Theatrical Trailers",5,X-2 X-Men United - An exceptional sequel!,1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,3932,"['X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'simply', 'put', 'exhilarating', 'exciting', 'follow', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'Cartoons', 'comic', 'books', 'aside', 'theatrical/DVD', 'release', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'first', 'one', 'Yes', 'many', 'fan', 'cartoons', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'reeling', 'major', 'differences', 'nuances', 'left', 'movies', 'just', 'minute', 'take', 'look', 'film', 'predecessor', 'completely', 'open', 'perspective', 'will', 'clearly', 'see', 'film', 'elements', 'make', 'successful', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'yes', 'have', 'plot', 'plot', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out.One', 'better', 'aspects', 'film', 'first', 'are', 'elements', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'paid', 'off', 'film', 'are', 'paid', 'off', 'here', 'such', 'Wolverine', 'mysterious', 'past', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'future', 'payoffs', 'are', 'great', 'new', 'character', 'arcs', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'outstanding', 'film.The', 'entirety', 'cast', 'first', 'film', 'return', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'new', 'additions', 'cast', 'actors/characters', 'Long', 'time', 'fans', 'Star', 'Trek', 'are', 'most', 'assuredly', 'familiar', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'abilities', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'wonderful', 'see', 'screen', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'who', 'most', 'will', 'recognize', 'Kamala', 'one', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'best', 'episodes', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'most', 'recently', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'fame', 'return', 'appearance', 'Magneto', 'performs', 'wonderful', 'standards.The', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'performs', 'brilliantly', 'Mystique', 'just', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', ""'m"", 'sure', 'taking', 'huge', 'cut', 'pay', 'New', 'cast', 'series', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Nightcrawler', 'performance', 'astonishing', 'say', 'least', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'be', 'one', 'luckiest', 'men', 'world', 'when', 'considering', 'how', 'many', 'might', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'when', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'all', 'portraying', 'attempted', 'seduction', 'Wolverine', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'other', 'films', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'directed', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'director', 'long', 'future', 'directing', 'action', 'films.The', 'Premise', 'teleporting', 'mutant', 'attempt', 'life', 'President', 'right', 'oval', 'office', 'easily', 'wading', 'Secret', 'Service', 'short', 'killing', 'President', 'disappears', 'White', 'House', 'Not', 'long', 'thereafter', ""'re"", 'reintroduced', 'X-Men', ""'re"", 'teleporting', 'mutant', 'who', 'attempted', 'take', 'out', 'President', 'Wolverine', 'return', 'Unbeknownst', 'William', 'Stryker', 'who', 'played', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'government', 'agent', 'who', 'plans', 'eliminate', 'mutants', 'planet', 'What', 'one', 'best', 'action/adventure', 'genre', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'films', 'genre', ""'re"", 'comics', 'not', 'personally', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'have', 'followed', 'characters', 'quite', 'easily', 'producers', 'director', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'ensure', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'X-Men', 'regularly', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'following', 'film', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Full-Length', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Cinematographer', 'Newton', 'Thomas', 'Sigel', 'ASC-Full-Length', 'Commentary', 'Writers', 'Producers-', 'Nightcrawler', 'Attack', 'Interactive', 'Multi-Angle', 'Scene', 'Study-', 'Wolverine/Deathstrike', 'Fight', 'Rehearsal', 'In-Depth', 'Behind-the', 'Scenes', 'Exploration-', 'Second', 'Uncanny', 'Issue', 'X-Men', 'Ultimate', 'Making-Of', 'Documentary-Extraordinary', 'X2', 'Featurettes', '*', 'Secret', 'Origin', 'X-Men', 'A', 'Complete', 'Anthology*', 'Nightcrawler', 'Reborn', 'Adventure', 'X2*', 'Introducing', 'Incredible', 'Nightcrawler', 'Character', 'Study', 'More-11', 'Deleted/Extended', 'Scenes-Still', 'Galleries-Theatrical', 'Trailers']",N/A

It is often difficult for a movie such as this to walk a fine line without crossing over it.  Many motion picture writers and directors miss one very important aspect of filmmaking:  Reason.  You can fill a film with special effects and extraordinary characters, but if you don't have a good reason for why a character looks, behaves, or strives for something, then it is my belief that you are lost.  The sequel chooses to have more fun in the wake of sheer unbelievabilty, while maintaining plausible and often unexpected reasoning behind each action and character trait, and therefore is superior to the original.  Another credit to the filmmakers lies in the way they juggle an ensemble cast as large as X2.  The later BATMAN movies proved that just because you have a big name in a role, doesn't mean people will always go along for the ride.  This film manages better character development, in less time, with less familiar actors.  I have never picked up an issue of the X-MEN comic, and my only knowledge of the story comes straight from the two films.  But I must say that for as bizarre as this film is, it is very entertaining and, at moments, quite humorous.  I also spoke to a number of patrons after the screening, and all agreed that X2 was more enjoyable than X-MEN.  If you are a fan of the comic, I don't think you'll be at all disappointed.

771307,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000BWVCJ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Even more so that its predecessor, ""X2: X-Men United"" is more of a treat for those of us weaned on Marvel Comics and know the complete back story of every single mutant superhero who pops up through the movie. When Dr. Hank McCoy (Steve Bacic) is shown debating the rights of Mutants on television we recognize he is one of the original merry mutants in yellow spandex, the Beast. During the final shot of the film we nod knowingly because our intimate knowledge of ""X-Men"" #101 means we recognize the strange shape and can hazard a pretty good guess as to what happens in the third X-Men movie before the credits even start to roll on this one.This film is better than the first one, which is a very good sign in the world of Hollywood where a sequel is one thing but a franchise is even better. The first time around the X-Men, the good mutants of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), had to stop Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his bad mutants (the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for those who know their X-Men lore), although there were humans trying to push a Mutant Registration Act through Congress. This time it is the ordinary humans who are after all the mutants in the world, ironically, by using mutants in the effort. In charge of the effort is General William Stryker (Brian Cox), who has found a means of extracting information from Magneto about Xavier's School for Gifted Children as well as some other ways of allowing him exercise some degree of mind control.The worst thing I can say about ""X2"" is that it begins with the best action sequences the entire film. A mutant gets into the White House and goes after the President (Cotter Smith) in the Oval Office. We know that this is Kurt Wagner (Alan Cummings), a.k.a. Nightcrawler, who has the gift of teleportation (apparently without the omnipresent of brimstone this time around). This surprises us because he is one of the ""good"" mutants, but the answer will be forthcoming. He is one of the few new characters introduced into the mix and the tatoos they have worked into Nightcrawler's make-up are superb; on the basis of Nightcrawler and Zhaan from ""Farscape,"" there simply need to be more blue chracters on television and in the movies.Anyhow, Nightcrawler's attack on the President gives Stryker carte blanche to go after the mutants and his first target is the school in Westchester, New York. When the troops hit Xavier's school is probably the second best action sequence in the film, and we are still only a half hour into the film (the final action sequences has great significance but is considerably less spectacular). For those who remember when Marvel editor Jim Shooter put his foot down about X-Men characters doing any actual killing (e.g., a whole planet of asparagus people), it is rather surprising to see Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) slicing and dicing his way through the shock troops. From that point on the goal is for the X-Men to stay ahead of Stryker's army and try to stop his plan and save mutant-kind.There are echoes of a lot of different epic adventures from the X-Men comic books in this film. The script by Michael Dougherty and Daniel P. Harris is based on a story created by David Hayter, Zak Penn, and director Bryan Singer, who were obviously inspired by the writers (Stan Lee, Len Wein, and Chris Claremont) and artists (Jack Kirby, Dave Cockrum, and John Byrne) of the comic books. There is still Wolverine trying to get between Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Scott Summers/Cyclopes (James Marsden), as well as the sudden spikes in Jean's powers. Rogue (Anna Paquin) is trying to figure out a way of having the most tentative of physical relationships with Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), while John Allerdyce/Pyro (Aaron Stanford) is trying to figure out whether or not he should switch sides. There are a lot of characters being juggled here; Halle Berry has an Oscar and is one of the good mutants, but she does not have much to do except exercise her powers to control the weather periodically. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos gets more to do as Mystique, except, of course, you can never tell.Ultimately what makes this film less than perfectlly satisfying is the fact that the nature of the characters compels the writers to create artificial restraints. When Marvel put out the ""Ultimate X-Men"" comic books it proved what I had long suspected: that you can really only have one fight between the X-Men and Magneto for all the marbles because as long as he has his helmet on, the Mutant Master of Magneticism is pretty much invincible. This is proven in ""X2"" when Magneto finally escape; keep in mind how he does it and then come up with a reason why he does not simply go out and do that to every human being on earth. Similarly, when the troops attack the school, there is more fleeing than fighting, although the tranquillizer darts used by the invaders do not work on the armored Piotr Rasputin/Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) or Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat (Katie Stuart) with her ability to walk through walls. Granted, the important thing is to get the kids to relative safety, but Wolverine does not have to do the Horatio at the bridge act.The key to where the next film can succeed even better is contained in the climax, not only in terms of story of self sacrifice involved but also in the promise of rebirth. In other words, the next time around ""X-Men"" can reach operatic heights if they do any justice at all to the Dark Phoenix epic.

Not only is it the outstanding, better-than-the-first sequel others have described. Not only is X2 the truer heir (in my humble opinion) to the title of modern-day myth than the one that sold its soul to special effects and ""enhanced versions"" (try enhancing Haydn Christiansen's acting! but I digress)  But X2 is also a biting, subversive statement on the present political coup.I submit in evidence the scene near the beginning, after the attack on the President, when the Professor is discussing damage control:Storm: ""They could reinstate the mandatory registration act.""Prof.  ""Or worse, the President could declare a state of emergency...""Also, the scene between the Senator and Stryker--hell bent on war! Producing ""evidence"" of a threat at the school.And near the end, again in the President's office, when Wolverine says ""We'll be watching you."" Anybody see Whoopie's recent stand-up TV special?These are only some examples of what struck me. Look for it next time around and you'll be surprised. The metaphors flying around this movie are like the pinballs of iron in Magneto's scene.Great, great cast! And no one could be better cast as Wolverine than Hugh Jackman.

The X-Men are subsequently forced into a collaboration with their mortal enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) to clear their names and destroy an all-powerful threat from humankind...Opening with a scene-setting quote from Abraham Lincoln, followed by one of the most astonishing action set-pieces of recent years (underscored by the 'Dies Irae' from Mozart's 'Requiem'), and closing with an extended confrontation between Good and Evil that tops anything in the original X-MEN (2000), Bryan Singer's powerhouse sequel ups the ante in terms of spectacle and excitement, whilst simultaneously expanding and developing the radical subtext (a minority group forced to take a stand against prejudice) inherent in the original Marvel comic strip.Beautifully filmed, and performed with gusto by a dedicated cast (including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Brian Cox, relegating Patrick Stewart, James Marsden and Anna Paquin to secondary roles this time out), the narrative unfolds with bold precision, constantly surprising the audience with inventive visuals and heartfelt emotional drama (the mutant 'coming out' scene - played with knowing irony by young Shawn Ashmore - will resonate especially with gay viewers).

I was expecting something different in terms of story and direction with this film. It fell short for my excitement.Then I saw it a second time - I loved it. The second time I got passed the lack of original story and started to see the process of the characters coming through. Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) tried to include lots of visuals and actions. Creating villains and believable situations that move the movie along. The effects and action sequences were brilliant.The standout performances included first and foremost Alan Cuming (Annie, Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas) as Night Crawler. His performance was simple and believable. He had heart and compassion and the most incredible mutant ability to date - teleportation. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Roller Ball, Fem Fatalle) as Mystique and Famke Janssen (I Spy, Don't Say A Word) as Jean Grey both had significantly larger parts in this film and were great fun to watch. Also Halle Berry (Die Another Day, Monsters Ball) had some incredible scenes of her weather abilities. Hugh Jackman (Kate and Leopold, Oklahoma) as Wolverine was astonishingly real and motivated for this movie. Sir Ian McKellon (Lord Of The Rings, David Copperfield) was extremely devious as Magneto and the best villain to watch. He seemed to be having a lot of fun with this one.The parts of Patrick Stewart (Star Trek, Animal Farm, Prince Of Egypt) as Charles Xavier and James Marsden (Alley McBeal, Disturbing Behavior) as Cyclops were very small and really the only week points in the story. The president was week and the whole underling White House connection was poor.The story was simple - Humans Vs. Mutants.

771318,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0000BWVCJ,"Maine Writer ""David""","[2, 2]","I thought the first X-Men movie was a mess.  I liked bits of it, particularly Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, and some of scenes were electrifying, including the ""cage"" match and the train sequence where Magneto lifts Wolverine into the air and gives him a stretch.  What was wrong with it?  Tone deaf story-telling, for one.  I'd come to expect that from Bryan Singer.  After watching Apt Pupil, I had low expectations about his ability to know a plot hole if it smacked him in the head.  I was right.  The dialogue was mainly lame, as well.  Add to that a rather stupid story with inexplicable inconsistencies.But enough of X-Men the first.  What of this effort?  It's a better movie.  Significantly so.  It still has big problems, and small ones (like Wolverine standing in the frozen tundra and exhaling with no ""breath"" to be seen).  But the dialogue is at various times snappy, funny, and energetic.  There must have been a new screenwriter involved, because X-2 has no lines that make you want to burst out laughing.  (Remember in X-Men when Storm and Toad have a dreadful exchange about the effects of lightning?)  The lightness of some of the lines provides a terrific counterpoint to dramatic and intense evil that the film depicts.  I, frankly, never expected a menace as dark and deep as Stryker and company, nor did I expect the fascinating twist at the end.  Frankly, one of the things that was missing from X-Men was a depiction of the vainglorious side of Magneto, in which his pride and arrogance go hand in hand with almost god-like powers.  This is a truly ""magnetic"" persona, one who can call and army of followers with his grand ideas and charisma.  McKellan does a star turn in this one (even though he still can't help but mumble some lines).Jackman, as expected, is terrific (although his hair looks just plain stupid in some of the scenes--in what appears to be an effort to mimic the comic books; it isn't the hair so much as the silly appearance that detracts from the scenes).  Anna Paquin is as insufferable and whiny as in the first film.  Rebecca Romijn does a really great, nuanced performance as Mystique (not to mention a drop dead gorgeous scene where she appears as herself, without the blue skin).  Alan Cumming is wonderful as Nightcrawler, who comes across as closest to the selfless superhero mold.  And Aaron Stanford gets an honorable mention as a terrific Pyro.  Brian Cox makes a formidable villain.I could run through the story problems--there are a few--and the fact that this movie could have been so much better.  But, I'm content to leave those points unmentioned.  Go in for a roller coaster ride with interesting plot twists, fun lines, and some great performances.  And then, for me, say a prayer that Halle Berry and Anna Paquin don't make it into X-3.  That, alone, would improve the franchise immeasurably.",4,"Pleasing effort, but many small and not so small flaws.",1051833600,"05 2, 2003",2003,2870,"['thought', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'was', 'mess', 'liked', 'bits', 'particularly', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'performance', 'Wolverine', 'scenes', 'were', 'electrifying', 'including', 'cage', 'match', 'train', 'sequence', 'where', 'Magneto', 'Wolverine', 'air', 'stretch', 'What', 'was', 'wrong', 'Tone', 'deaf', 'story-telling', 'one', ""'d"", 'come', 'expect', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'watching', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'ability', 'know', 'plot', 'hole', 'smacked', 'head', 'was', 'right', 'dialogue', 'was', 'mainly', 'lame', 'as', 'well', 'Add', 'rather', 'stupid', 'story', 'inexplicable', 'inconsistencies.But', 'enough', 'X-Men', 'first', 'What', 'effort', 'better', 'movie', 'Significantly', 'so', 'still', 'big', 'problems', 'small', 'ones', 'Wolverine', 'standing', 'frozen', 'tundra', 'exhaling', 'breath', 'be', 'seen', 'dialogue', 'various', 'times', 'snappy', 'funny', 'energetic', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'screenwriter', 'involved', 'X-2', 'lines', 'make', 'want', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'Remember', 'X-Men', 'when', 'Storm', 'Toad', 'have', 'dreadful', 'exchange', 'effects', 'lightning', 'lightness', 'lines', 'terrific', 'counterpoint', 'dramatic', 'intense', 'evil', 'film', 'depicts', 'frankly', 'never', 'expected', 'menace', 'dark', 'deep', 'Stryker', 'company', 'did', 'expect', 'fascinating', 'twist', 'end', 'Frankly', 'one', 'things', 'was', 'missing', 'X-Men', 'was', 'depiction', 'vainglorious', 'side', 'Magneto', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'almost', 'god-like', 'powers', 'truly', 'magnetic', 'persona', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'call', 'army', 'followers', 'grand', 'ideas', 'charisma', 'McKellan', 'star', 'turn', 'one', 'even', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'mumble', 'lines', '.Jackman', 'expected', 'terrific', 'hair', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'what', 'be', 'effort', 'mimic', 'comic', 'books', ""n't"", 'hair', 'so', 'much', 'silly', 'appearance', 'scenes', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'insufferable', 'whiny', 'first', 'film', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'really', 'great', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Mystique', 'not', 'mention', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'scene', 'where', 'herself', 'blue', 'skin', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'wonderful', 'Nightcrawler', 'who', 'closest', 'selfless', 'superhero', 'mold', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'honorable', 'mention', 'terrific', 'Pyro', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'formidable', 'villain.I', 'could', 'run', 'story', 'problems', 'are', 'few', 'fact', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', ""'m"", 'content', 'leave', 'points', 'unmentioned', 'Go', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'fun', 'lines', 'great', 'performances', 'then', 'say', 'prayer', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'X-3', 'alone', 'would', 'improve', 'franchise', 'immeasurably']",N/A

Sequels are rarely better than their predecessors, but X-Men United shows improvement on almost every front.  The acting is solid, the effects and filming are even more amazing than before, and the plot is head and shoulders better than the first, which was in many ways a rehash of the comic books.  This is a testament to the work of Bryan Singer (also responsible for King Kong) and the writers, and proof that popular entertainment does not have to be completely banal.The story kicks off when the president's office is invaded by a mutant.  A demonic looking teleporter who seems to be a representative of a mutant's lib movement.  A barb tailed terrorist who is, for all purposes, unstoppable.  In the chaos that ensues William Stryker (Brian Cox) steps in with a plan to invade Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) school and capture the mutants.  The attack is only partially successful, and it quickly becomes clear to the viewer and the X-Men that Stryker's agenda is more than defending the president.  He wants to destroy all mutants driven by his own anger over Xavier's failure to 'cure' his son.Cox is brilliant as the psychotic Stryker, and with a villain so despicable that Magneto seems almost likeable, you will quickly become emotionally involved in the race to keep all out war from breaking out between the increasing number of mutants and populations that feel threatened by those whose powers seem almost magical.  As such, the story becomes a parable of human fear in the face of things beyond our control and how quickly that turns to anger and violence.The film introduces many new faces that will become more important in later films (such as the so far ill-fated X-Men 3).  Pyro (John Allerdyce), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), and Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), for example.  The latter, by the way turns in an outstanding performance in a supporting role.  Hats off to the unsung heroes who do the animation and effects work as well - everything seems smooth and seamless.

This is not the case with X2, in fact it is better than the original. X2 grabs you from the beginning and smacks you around like the naughty child you are with an outstanding opening action sequence where Night Crawler breaks into the White House and tries to send a message to the president. This is by far the best action sequence of the year 2003. With the amazing special effects that actually make Night Crawlers teleporting look real, the exhilarating music track, and a** kicking action, it is obvious from the beginning that this is film making at its finest.The makers of both these films did such a great job in not only making the X-Men seem real, but they were able to present them in a manner that was not corny, and found a way around the multi colored spandex of the comic book. In addition, they stay very true to the comic book and in no where is this more evident in the portrayal of Wolverine and the intense rage he possesses. In fact during the scene when Wolverine was rumbling with the invading special forces in Professor X's school, I almost jumped out of my chair and proclaimed ""OH GOD, YES!""X2 has great action, great writing, great directing, great production, and great acting.

771323,A1HFIKNWLABJIN,B0000BWVCJ,"mark ""weeping_guitar""","[0, 0]","Building on the vast success of the first X-Men film director Bryan Singer has not only a hit with the second installment, X2, but he's hit it out of the ballpark. The first film was essentially an extended character and story introduction and in those regards it works very well, but here everything is bigger and better from the special effects, outfits, music score, characters, story, etc (and hair styles!). It's just brimming with confidence and it plays out to be my favorite comic-book film ever created.The White House goes under siege. With a ""bampf"" we see the teleporting blue-skinned mutant known as Nightcrawler take the president's life to the edge of a knife. Needless to say the strained mutant/human relationship is once again heightened and a mysterious military scientist William Stryker is all over the situation. He's been involved in the mutant issue as long as anybody, his son is a mutant it turns out, and knows about it all, even Xavier's School and Wolverine's history. There is a lot going on throughout, but the multiple threads never seem to get too distanced from each other and they all lead back to one man, Stryker, who now has kidnapped Professor Xavier and is well prepared to exploit his powers.The real strength of the film is in the actors. Even with the film featuring a dozen or so central characters there doesn't seem to be too much lack as far as building them and giving them something to do. The only real victim would probably be Cyclops, which is shame as he's one of the central leaders of the team. Ian McKellen plays Magneto with such a driven, menacing edge he's a thrill to watch. His escape from his plastic cell displays what true presence and awe the man can evoke. For the most part the returning characters are that much better with Halle Berry's Storm given her due leadership role, Patrick Stewar's Professor Xavier showing us why he's held in high regard, and especially Famke Janssen's Jean Grey who delivers the film's emotional climax quite grandly. The real surprise for me was the Mystique character, which here is brought much more to the front and for good reason as she's both the ideal eye-candy and morphing deadly assassin all in one. Allan Cumming too impressed me as Nightcrawler, who unlike the other mutants relies on his religious faith to guide him, not anger or hope. Of course, the real star is still Hugh Jackman's Wolverine who possesses such a animalistic power and presence, you'd swear he sweats testosterone. That's not to say he can't do the slower scenes (Wolverine and Jean Grey's time together especially are well done), but he's such a knockout in the action ones.Like I mentioned before, the big difference here is confidence and every inch of the film is brimming with it from the director to the cast to the story. Singer was able to get the budge this film deserved based off the first film's success and he and 20th Century Fox have used that to their benefit. The film appears to be made first for the comic fan, which is how it should be (there's a final hint at the end as to where X3 will be taking us). There's many quick shots and references to mutants that have yet to make an appearence in the film series. This film never insults the viewer, it's constantly raising the bar for the audience to keep up with. My favorite part is that they never sink down to make it more general audience friendly, they challenge you to become part of their world and it succeeds. It's the comic film for the grown-up, the thinking man's hero adventure.",5,The War  Has Begun,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,3541,"['Building', 'vast', 'success', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'not', 'only', 'hit', 'second', 'installment', 'X2', 'hit', 'ballpark', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'essentially', 'extended', 'character', 'story', 'introduction', 'regards', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'everything', 'bigger', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'outfits', 'music', 'score', 'characters', 'story', 'etc', 'hair', 'styles', 'just', 'brimming', 'confidence', 'out', 'be', 'favorite', 'comic-book', 'film', 'ever', 'White', 'House', 'siege', 'bampf', 'see', 'teleporting', 'blue-skinned', 'mutant', 'known', 'Nightcrawler', 'take', 'president', 'life', 'edge', 'knife', 'Needless', 'say', 'strained', 'mutant/human', 'relationship', 'once', 'again', 'heightened', 'mysterious', 'military', 'scientist', 'William', 'Stryker', 'situation', 'been', 'involved', 'mutant', 'issue', 'as', 'long', 'anybody', 'son', 'mutant', 'out', 'even', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Wolverine', 'history', 'lot', 'going', 'multiple', 'threads', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'too', 'distanced', 'other', 'lead', 'back', 'one', 'man', 'Stryker', 'who', 'now', 'kidnapped', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'well', 'prepared', 'exploit', 'powers.The', 'real', 'strength', 'film', 'actors', 'Even', 'film', 'featuring', 'dozen', 'so', 'central', 'characters', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'lack', 'as', 'far', 'building', 'giving', 'something', 'do', 'only', 'real', 'victim', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'Cyclops', 'shame', 'one', 'central', 'leaders', 'team', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Magneto', 'driven', 'menacing', 'edge', 'thrill', 'watch', 'escape', 'plastic', 'cell', 'what', 'true', 'presence', 'awe', 'man', 'can', 'evoke', 'most', 'part', 'returning', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', 'given', 'due', 'leadership', 'role', 'Patrick', 'Stewar', 'Professor', 'Xavier', 'showing', 'why', 'held', 'high', 'regard', 'especially', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'who', 'film', 'emotional', 'climax', 'quite', 'grandly', 'real', 'surprise', 'was', 'Mystique', 'character', 'here', 'brought', 'much', 'more', 'front', 'good', 'reason', 'ideal', 'eye-candy', 'morphing', 'deadly', 'one', 'Allan', 'Cumming', 'too', 'impressed', 'Nightcrawler', 'who', 'other', 'mutants', 'relies', 'religious', 'faith', 'guide', 'not', 'anger', 'hope', 'course', 'real', 'star', 'still', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'who', 'animalistic', 'power', 'presence', ""'d"", 'swear', 'testosterone', 'not', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'slower', 'scenes', 'Wolverine', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'time', 'together', 'especially', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'such', 'knockout', 'action', 'mentioned', 'big', 'difference', 'here', 'confidence', 'inch', 'film', 'brimming', 'director', 'cast', 'story', 'Singer', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'budge', 'film', 'deserved', 'based', 'off', 'first', 'film', 'success', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'have', 'used', 'benefit', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'first', 'comic', 'fan', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'final', 'hint', 'end', 'where', 'X3', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'many', 'quick', 'shots', 'references', 'mutants', 'have', 'yet', 'make', 'appearence', 'film', 'series', 'film', 'never', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'raising', 'bar', 'audience', 'keep', 'up', 'favorite', 'part', 'never', 'sink', 'down', 'make', 'more', 'general', 'audience', 'friendly', 'challenge', 'become', 'part', 'world', 'comic', 'film', 'grown-up', 'thinking', 'man', 'hero', 'adventure']",N/A

Ironically, perhaps the hardest thing to do is simply to entertain without informing or educating. A movie can educate the audience about a certain subject, and be critically praised, even if it is not very well made. If a movie is designed just to be a `popcorn' film or a blockbuster, then it damn well better know what it is doing. ""X2"" was produced, as far as I can tell, only for entertainment, but it does this exceptionally well. Its subject matter is banal because it is, after all, based on a comic book. No matter! It is one of the sleekest, best executed movies of 2003. The CGI effects and set designs are brilliant. The attention to detail is amazing. It is a fairly rare example of a sequel topping the original. I thoroughly enjoyed it.In this episode the mutants find themselves reluctantly in a war with normal human beings over control of the planet. At first, they are not sure of who or what caused this conflict. Even after they find our what caused it, they are not entirely sure of what to do. Their quest to solve the problem makes for a riveting, nail-biting story.Like the original film, one of the movie's assets is its cast, which includes Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellan, Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin, all of whom reprise their roles. Somewhat like ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, there is just enough character definition to let these actors give much more than cardboard performances.

I think this movie isn't as great as X-Men 1, but very well done.The plot seems to run dry. Some guy wants to kill all mutants using cerebro, which was that machine they used to find mutants. It is completely different from X1, but that isn't why the movie is good. It is because of the action, and the characters. If you don't love the characters, you won't love the movie. My dad said the reason he didn't like starwars 2 was because of Anakin, and he is right(noone wants to listen to a whiner). All the characters in this movie you can like, Storm can be stupid at times though. I don't want to give it away, but when Jean states ""Its targeting something else"", Storms reply is ""If its not targeting blahblah then what is it targeting?"". Dude, Storm, every single person in that room understands what Jean is talking about, you are just making yourself look stupid. The action is great also. At first you think Wolverine is gonna do that thing where instead of killing people he slashes their guns in half, your wrong. He actually stabs people, for real. There isn't any blood, but its awesome. I mean he must stab 100 people. It is very cool. Storm does some stuff. Even though shes got a pretty big picture on the cover, she is not a main character at all. They have introduced some more mutants too, and it basically highlights the new recruits. Night crawler is major with his transport skill, and Colossus throws these 2 guys. Then there is Pyro. Pyro states that he is the worst mutant of them all, yet he can't even create fire, and you will see what I mean by that. One thing you may notice is that they have changed Pyro, in X1 he was the guy who made the small flame, and iceman froze it. He had blonde hair and looked alot different, they got a new guy to do him in this movie. The humor is alright, and Wolverine does most of it, but some of the people in the theatre would just not stop laughing.

Once you've seen the first, you will definitely want to see the second, especially since you get to see even more of the rather lovely Hugh Jackman.All the old characters are brought back to fight another day, and we also get introduced to some new characters - some of the kids from the school get a bigger role, including Rogue's boyfriend, who will make sure that your drink is always `ice' cold. Another great new character is ""Nightcrawler"", played brilliantly by fellow Scot, Alan Cumming, who is almost as bad as Mystique, having at one point to be in make-up for 10 hours! (He appears topless in one scene, so that adds on the extra hours)All the now well known characters appear at the start, but they don't all appear at the end. Now, I wonder what that could mean? I was quite shocked at the apparent death of this particular popular character, as it seemed totally unnecessary, but never mind.Hugh Jackman is terrific once more as Wolverine, although he meets the female version of him, resulting in some rather painful looking scenes. There are also a few glimpses into his past, and it gets revealed about how he came to be as he is.Anna Paquin appears, and gets a quite good role, although the originally `white' streaks in her hair seem to have turned blonde between films! Her relationship with her `ice cool' boyfriend, briefly introduced during the previous film, develops, although not by much, judging by the effect she has on people!In this film, the humans are the baddies, and the renegade mutants join with the good guys to fight the threat. This results in some spectacular action scenes with explosive special effects.There are a huge amount of extras on the two disc dvd version, covering almost everything you could possibly want to know about the making of this film, from pre-production to post-production, including the special make-up effects used on Nightcrawler and Mystique.The four-disc special edition DVD containing both films and stacks of extras is highly recommended and well-worth the purchase price.",3,"Watch the first for intros, watch this for the action",1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,2162,"['Once', 'more', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'director', 'X-Men', 'brings', 'spectacular', 'sequel', 'possibly', 'more', 'more', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'second', 'especially', 'get', 'see', 'even', 'more', 'rather', 'lovely', 'Hugh', 'Jackman.All', 'old', 'characters', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'fight', 'day', 'also', 'get', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'kids', 'school', 'get', 'bigger', 'role', 'including', 'Rogue', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'sure', 'drink', 'always', 'ice', 'cold', 'great', 'new', 'character', 'Nightcrawler', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'fellow', 'Scot', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'who', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'Mystique', 'having', 'one', 'point', 'be', 'make-up', '10', 'hours', 'topless', 'one', 'scene', 'extra', 'hours', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'characters', 'appear', 'start', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'appear', 'end', 'Now', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'mean', 'was', 'quite', 'shocked', 'apparent', 'death', 'particular', 'popular', 'character', 'seemed', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'never', 'mind.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'terrific', 'once', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'female', 'version', 'resulting', 'rather', 'painful', 'looking', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'glimpses', 'past', 'revealed', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'Paquin', 'quite', 'good', 'role', 'originally', 'white', 'streaks', 'hair', 'seem', 'have', 'turned', 'blonde', 'films', 'relationship', 'ice', 'cool', 'boyfriend', 'briefly', 'introduced', 'previous', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'judging', 'effect', 'people', 'film', 'humans', 'are', 'baddies', 'renegade', 'mutants', 'join', 'good', 'guys', 'fight', 'threat', 'results', 'spectacular', 'action', 'scenes', 'explosive', 'special', 'are', 'huge', 'amount', 'extras', 'two', 'disc', 'dvd', 'version', 'covering', 'almost', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'know', 'making', 'film', 'pre-production', 'post-production', 'including', 'special', 'make-up', 'effects', 'used', 'Nightcrawler', 'Mystique.The', 'four-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'containing', 'films', 'stacks', 'extras', 'highly', 'recommended', 'well-worth', 'purchase', 'price']",N/A

771343,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0000BWVCJ,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 1]","The summer season is once again upon us at the box office and the major movie studios have a hell of a one planned this year. Though it had been typically taboo to open a major tentpole feature prior to the four-day Memorial Day weekend, times have changed with The Mummy, Gladiator, and The Mummy Returns posting numbers in the realm of $40 - $70 million the first weekend of May. That weekend officially became the new starting point for the summer season when Spider-Man blew the competition away with its $114.5 million opening weekend take in 2002. The summer season once again kicks off with a comic-book adaptation, this year with X2: X-Men United, the highly anticipated sequel to the 2000 original. The comic-book adaptation genre has re-emerged in the past year or two to become the latest rage now amongst the major movie studios, all of which hoping to come away with an exciting, and financially successful, new franchise in their hands. With Daredevil, which opened earlier this year, proving to be a modest success at the box office, one would think that X2 would have no problems but then that person would be slightly off base. After its opening weekend, the original X-Men film slowed down significantly but not so much so that it failed to be successful. Could that be the same with this film? With an expanded production budget and an enormous marketing campaign, X2 will definitely need a good running start if it were to be as successful or more so then its predecessor.The story picks up right where the original X-Men film left off with Magneto confined in prison and Professor Xavier, along with his team of mutants, fighting to protect both human and mutant kind alike from outside forces that threaten them. The war between men and mutants, which had been discussed heavily in the original film, seems to be drawing closer to actualization as moves made by certain individuals have created conflicts that will become of greater concern to everyone as time progresses. The latest confrontation comes in the form of the attempted assassination of the president by an unknown mutant assailant, which gives William Stryker ample opportunity to enact a special mission to infiltrate Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted. Though he manages to capture several of the students within the children, he isn?t interested only in them but rather he has his sights set on all the mutants on the planet. The X-Men must now unite forces with Magneto?s rebel band of mutants to fight for their share of the world and to prevent the destruction of all mutant kind. The story for X2: X-Men United is exceptionally well done and exemplifies vast improvement from the original film which divulged too much into character development and concentrated less on action sequences. The only problem is that this film suffers from the same problem that plagued Daredevil earlier this year in that it contains several story elements that would not be as easily understood except by devoted comic-book fanatics.Most cast members from the original X-Men film have returned for the highly anticipated sequel and they exhibit an attitude in their recurring roles of comfortability, which makes their performances all the more enjoyable. There is no doubt in anyone?s mind that Hugh Jackman is Wolverine ? plain and simple. He is able to present such a roguish and high octane persona on screen that it is almost eerie how he is able to successful slip into the role so easily. Patrick Stewart once again presents a magnificent performance as Professor Charles Xavier, as he had in the original film. Despite not being featured as much as before, Stewart still plays an essential part in the whole story. Ian McKellen gives an absolutely chilling performance as Magneto. He plays out the role so well that you might actually believe he is that character much like he did with the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings series. Out of all the new additions to the stellar cast, Alan Cumming is quite possibly the biggest highlight in the role of Nightcrawler. Cumming successfully provides a character full of emotion, which was a pleasant surprising considering many had expected the character to be for mere special effects purposes rather then the more in-depth approach that was given.Overall, X2: X-Men United exceeds all expectations not only by successfully kicking off the summer with an exuberant bang but by vastly surpassing its modestly disappointing predecessor. Although the film as a whole was nearly perfect, there were some minor things to pick at. First off, there were several members of the cast that were pointlessly added to the film, most notably Kelly Hu?s Lady Deathstrike. She never really did anything for the film except the final fight sequence with Logan but other then that there was nothing for her to do. There are rumors that she may have an expanded role in the third installment but when it comes to this film, she could have easily been left out or cut back at least. Cyclops, who appeared briefly in the beginning and the end of the film, was another character that seemed to have been pointlessly added to the feature. Secondly, it would have behooved Bryan Singer to have eliminated an action sequence or two as there to have been too many of them strung together, despite their choreography being nearly perfect. And lastly, the ending, though magnificently done, will confuse many movie-goers not familiar with either the comic book or cartoon series. But perhaps a better explanation will be given when X3 hits theaters in 2006. X2 gives an exhilarating kick-off to the new summer season and sets the bar pretty high for all those to follow.",4,The Moose Hole - 'X'-Traordinary!,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,5683,"['summer',

Moore,"[1, 2]","You have to hand it to Stan Lee and the gang at Marvel Comics: overseeing the movies made from their comics, they've made sure that Hollywood's done a bang-up job, both literally and figuratively. This is true both for Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" movies and Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" series. In both series of movies, the special effects are absolutely state-of-the-art, and the action sequences are a total wow. But they are also well-written and impeccably cast, with characters an audience can actually care about. ""X2: X-Men United"" has the same advantage as ""Spider-Man 2""--since most of the main characters were already introduced in the first film, the sequel can get down to the business of creating an engrossing story for them. In the case of ""X2,"" the story hinges on a dastardly plot to frame the mutants for an assassination attempt on the President, leading to a worldwide hue-and-cry against them. All the old characters are back, and there are some intriguing new ones--Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the ostensible assassin, and the hissable Stryker (Brian Cox), who seeks revenge on the mutants. In any case, Bryan Singer takes as much care with the performances and the characters--their interrelations and motivations--as he does with the makeup and the action sequences, and it pays off big. All the performers are very good, but the three top-lined ones--Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman--stand out. It's wonderful to see such consummate classical actors as Stewart and McKellen play antagonists, particularly such semi-friendly ones as Xavier and Magneto. As Wolverine, Jackman--a sort of Mad Max/Snake Plissken type among the mutants--is riveting. If you compare what he does here with what he does as Curly in ""Oklahoma!"", you can only conclude that here is a superstar in the making.",5,"Exciting, touching, and fun.",1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,1816,"['have', 'hand', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'gang', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'overseeing', 'movies', 'made', 'comics', ""'ve"", 'made', 'sure', 'Hollywood', 'done', 'bang-up', 'job', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'true', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'series', 'series', 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'absolutely', 'state-of-the-art', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'total', 'wow', 'are', 'also', 'well-written', 'impeccably', 'cast', 'characters', 'audience', 'can', 'actually', 'care', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'same', 'advantage', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'already', 'introduced', 'first', 'film', 'sequel', 'can', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'creating', 'engrossing', 'story', 'case', 'X2', 'story', 'dastardly', 'plot', 'frame', 'mutants', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'President', 'leading', 'worldwide', 'hue-and-cry', 'old', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'are', 'intriguing', 'new', 'ones', 'Nightcrawler', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'ostensible', 'assassin', 'hissable', 'Stryker', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'revenge', 'mutants', 'case', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'as', 'much', 'care', 'performances', 'characters', 'interrelations', 'motivations', 'makeup', 'action', 'sequences', 'off', 'big', 'performers', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'three', 'top-lined', 'ones', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'stand', 'out', 'wonderful', 'see', 'such', 'consummate', 'classical', 'actors', 'Stewart', 'McKellen', 'play', 'antagonists', 'particularly', 'such', 'semi-friendly', 'ones', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'Wolverine', 'Jackman', 'sort', 'Mad', 'Max/Snake', 'Plissken', 'type', 'mutants', 'riveting', 'compare', 'what', 'here', 'what', 'Curly', 'Oklahoma', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'here', 'superstar', 'making']",N/A

X-Men 1 was charged with introducing all of the characters, which limited the type of story that could be effectively told. X3, on the other hand, focussed very little on character development and was more about action. X2, then, is the perfect balance of style and substance. While it does not necessarily have as many complex action sequences as the third, it also is not limited in the way that the first movie was. That said, X2 is an enjoyable action flick that does not sacrifice good storytelling for action sequences. The characters are well thought-out and more developed than in the other two movies, and the story is probably the best of the three. This movie is not for everyone, but even casual fans of the X-Men comics or those who are interested in learning more about the stories should check this movie out. For the most part, it can stand on its own, and requires little existing knowledge about the X-Men universe, although those who know more about the comics will be able to appreciate this movie on a deeper level and pick up on things that others might just gloss over (such as the hint of Jean's emergence as Phoenix at the end).",4,Best Of The Trilogy,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,1263,"['seeing', 'X-Men', '3', 'Last', 'Stand', 'can', 'confidently', 'say', 'best', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'X-Men', '1', 'was', 'charged', 'introducing', 'characters', 'limited', 'type', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'effectively', 'told', 'X3', 'other', 'hand', 'focussed', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'X2', 'then', 'perfect', 'balance', 'style', 'substance', 'not', 'necessarily', 'have', 'many', 'complex', 'action', 'sequences', 'third', 'also', 'not', 'limited', 'way', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'said', 'X2', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'good', 'storytelling', 'action', 'sequences', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'thought-out', 'more', 'developed', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'story', 'probably', 'best', 'three', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'even', 'casual', 'fans', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'stories', 'should', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'little', 'existing', 'knowledge', 'X-Men', 'universe', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'comics', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'deeper', 'level', 'pick', 'up', 'things', 'others', 'might', 'just', 'gloss', 'over', 'such', 'hint', 'Jean', 'emergence', 'Phoenix', 'end']",N/A

Whereas the first film spent a lot of time introducing the characters, this one introduces only three new characters: Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Nightcrawler, and those introductions are well-integrated in the plot. The first film's coherence suffered considerably from all the backstories. But ""X2: X-Men United"" is able to concentrate its energies on plot with improved results. The story makes more sense and is much more satisfying than the first film. Both films suffer from having too many characters, which sometimes seem to be like so many gadgets, each with its own gimmick. But I think we're stuck with that problem. Director Bryan Singer has done a good job. ""X2"" is a lot of fun. It may not be as socio-politically complex as the comic books, but it does manage to raise issues of abuse of power, constitutional protections, minority rights, and the politics of fear, if only briefly. The public is told by their leaders and by the media to fear Mutants, and so the public is inclined to look the other way when their rights are violated and they are flagrantly persecuted.

X2 is one of my favorite comic book films, and is without a doubt my favorite X-Men film.  Nearly everything the first film did right, this movie improved upon.  Nearly everything the first film did wrong, this film did right.I like the characters more here, especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  Wolverine gets much needed development in this movie.  We finally get info of how Wolverine became Wolverine and why he lost his memory.  We learn that his past is heavily connected to a man named William Striker (Brian Cox), who is one of the main villains of this film.We also focus more on Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) in this film.  We see her powers developing rapidly and she taps into a new power later in the film it seems, which is left open for explanation in the next film.  We also get introduced to a new mutant named Nightcrawler Alan Cumming), who I really like.  I was never a big fan of Nightcrawler, but I think he was handled well here.  I also like his relationship with Storm (Halle Berry), who I actually like a bit more here.  I love the make-up effects for him, as well as the effect for when he is teleporting.We also focus more on Ice Man (Shawn Ashmore) and learn a bit about him.  We also get more focus on a mutant named Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who gets probably one of the more interesting developments in the movie.However there are a couple problems in the movie and they involve two character; Scott (Cyclops) and Professor X Patrick Stewart).  Professor X really gets shunned in this film and being used as a pawn which I was sad to see.  The first film did not give him much to do either.  That is one of the problems that the first movie had that this one did not fix.  I get why but I still do not like that.  Cyclops (James Marsden) also gets shafted in this film.  This one of the few things that the first film did right and this did not.  The first X-Men at least gave Cyclops something to do though it was not that much.  He, though, he is pretty much shunned entirely.  Scott is supposed to be the leader of the X-Men, and he is one of my favorite X-Men.  Seeing him get treated the way he does in these movies is a bit aggravating.The driving factors in this film, other than Wolverine, are definitely the villains.  Magneto (Ian McKellen) is back and is as cunning as ever.  You also have the new villain William Striker.  What is great about this movie is the social commentary.  The first film had the social commentary of humans and mutants, but here it is more in the foreground and is brought to its furthest ends through these two villains.  On one hand you have Magneto who believes that mutants are the next stage in evolution and that humans are obsolete.  On the other hand you have striker who views mutants as a disease that needs to be wiped out.  They are two sides of the same coin and they play off each other perfectly.  Usually when you have multiple super-villains in one movie the end result is a cluttered mess, but not here.  There is no super-villain team-up either like in many superhero films.  These two hate each other.Overall, X2 is a brilliant film and a must see for X-Men fans.  Even if you are not a fan of comic book movies I would still recommend that you give this a chance.

The movie was great in every possible way and I found very little to zero flaws during this movie.For starters, X2 is certainly better than the first movie.  This reason being simply that the first movie was more of an introduction to the whole idea of X-Men for the audience that was not familiar with X-Men as a whole.  However, this movie really gets into the hard core storylines such as Jean & Cyclops' relationship, Wolverine's past, and adds some interesting if not critical characters like William Stryker, Pyro, and Nightcrawler.The movie never gets boring and always keeps you into it with its great acting and eye-popping action.  But make no mistake about it, X2 really focuses in on the storylines of the comic book which has made X-Men a successful franchise.A lot of credit has to be given to Bryan Singer for directing this film because he was able to stick to the main plots without making any real significant changes to the X-Men storyline.  He also improved this film by getting rid of Sabretooth and Toad since those characters really were never critical to the comics nor are they in Singer's 1st film.  Also, Singer cleverly keeps out the most annoying character, Jubilee, from the movie.  In fact, this DVD reveals how a minor scene that included Jubilee was deleted.  Some characters that Singer may want to introduce in the next film are Beast, Mr. Sinister, or even Omega Red.  He may want to consider giving Colossus a bigger role if he includes Omega Red.But most of all, Singer has to include Gambit in the next film.  His real name (Remy Lambeau) is shown in one scene as another reviewer already wrote and Henry McCoy (Beast) is briefly shown on a TV set in one scene.  So one has to expect that they will be included in the next film.Overall, X2 is brilliantly directed and screenplayed.  The DVD is awesome in that it's a two disc set which has plenty of features that really go behind the scenes of X2.If you're an X-Men fan, don't hesitate buying this DVD.  Buy it right away, you won't regret it!  I can't wait until X3 comes out because it will be interesting to see where Singers goes with the the transformation of Jean into the Phoenix.",5,A Great Sequel!!,1070582400,"12 5, 2003",2003,2225,"['X2', 'simply', 'awesome', 'movie', 'great', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'possible', 'way', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'zero', 'flaws', 'movie.For', 'starters', 'X2', 'certainly', 'better', 'first', 'movie', 'reason', 'being', 'simply', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'introduction', 'whole', 'idea', 'X-Men', 'audience', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'X-Men', 'whole', 'However', 'movie', 'really', 'hard', 'core', 'storylines', 'such', 'Jean', 'Cyclops', 'relationship', 'Wolverine', 'past', 'interesting', 'not', 'critical', 'characters', 'William', 'Stryker', 'Pyro', 'Nightcrawler.The', 'movie', 'never', 'boring', 'always', 'keeps', 'great', 'acting', 'eye-popping', 'action', 'make', 'mistake', 'X2', 'really', 'storylines', 'comic', 'book', 'made', 'X-Men', 'successful', 'franchise.A', 'lot', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'directing', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'stick', 'main', 'plots', 'making', 'real', 'significant', 'changes', 'X-Men', 'storyline', 'also', 'improved', 'film', 'getting', 'rid', 'Sabretooth', 'Toad', 'characters', 'really', 'were', 'never', 'critical', 'comics', 'are', 'Singer', '1st', 'film', 'Also', 'Singer', 'cleverly', 'out', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'Jubilee', 'movie', 'fact', 'DVD', 'how', 'minor', 'scene', 'included', 'Jubilee', 'was', 'deleted', 'characters', 'Singer', 'may', 'want', 'introduce', 'next', 'film', 'are', 'Beast', 'Mr.', 'Sinister', 'even', 'Omega', 'Red', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'giving', 'Colossus', 'bigger', 'role', 'Red.But', 'most', 'Singer', 'include', 'Gambit', 'next', 'film', 'real', 'name', 'Remy', 'Lambeau', 'shown', 'one', 'scene', 'reviewer', 'already', 'wrote', 'Henry', 'McCoy', 'Beast', 'briefly', 'shown', 'TV', 'set', 'one', 'scene', 'So', 'one', 'expect', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'next', 'film.Overall', 'X2', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'screenplayed', 'DVD', 'awesome', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'plenty', 'features', 'really', 'go', 'scenes', 'X2.If', ""'re"", 'X-Men', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buying', 'DVD', 'Buy', 'right', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'X3', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'where', 'Singers', 'transformation', 'Jean', 'Phoenix']",N/A

The characters are more developed, the action tighter and more gripping and the story more  compelling.  This is a truly statisfying thriller.  The best performance in the movie is a tie: I would have to give that honor to Hugh Jackman again for his evolution as Wolverine, Brian Cox as the sinister, mutant-hating Col. Stryker, Ian McKellan for the wicked Magneto and surprisingly Alan Cumming as the religious Nightcrawler.  The movie starts off with a bang as Nightcrawler attempts to assinate the President in a headspinning opening sequence.  The film moves from there, held together by the stern and tight direction of Bryan Singer and a meatier script where original writer David Hayter gets aid from two other wirters, who help develop the characters more and give the movie a healthy dose of humor.  The climax is an extended sequence at Alkalai Lake, where special effects and an atmosphere of  impending doom take over leaving you leveled from it.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 4]","There's no question that bigger, bolder, better, faster applies to the X-Men sequel, with a whole array of new characters, more stunts, an obviously bigger budget and a returning cast.  This time round the X-Men must club together to defeat mutant-hating Synger (Cox), who is attempting to trick Professor X (Stewart) into destroying all the world's mutants using his telepathic powers.  Alongside Jackman's hulking Wolverine, there are some great new characters, most notably Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler.  A seemingly bizarre casting choice, he works surprisingly well as a German teleporting mutant paired up with Halle Berry's Storm.  Of the kids at the training academy, Iceman's powers are displayed with a light touch, along with his look-but-don't-touch relationship with Paquin's Rogue.  Pyro doesn't really get much screentime but, without giving away too much plot, there's a distinct feeling there'll be more of him in X-Men 3.The acting, as a whole, is good.  In particular, James Marsden isn't nearly as irritating this time round, and actually gets a chance to act in the final scenes.  Famke Janssen proves that she can be quite a presence, and McKellen gives it his all.  But there's no doubt that this Jackman's movie, and he gives it his all to come across as the dark mysterious type.  This fits in seamlessly with the references to his murky past and the fact that his mean streak is shown in full this time round.As for the film itself, it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, so the exposition-packed first installment really pays off.  The fight scenes are more impressive, particularly between Wolverine and his female equivalent, an energetic Kelly Hu.  There are also plenty of exciting stunts and the scene where the military break into the academy is very well staged indeed.  Even the obligatory 'human' element of the storyline is anything but cheesy, and mostly quite subtle.  Witness Storm and Nightcrawler, Rogue and Iceman and, in particular, Wolverine and Jean Grey.

Following a Presidential assassination attempt by a mutant, the community at large, already full of anti-mutant sentiment, begins to call for even greater sanctions against mutant-kind.  The X-men are soon forced to join forces with the mutant terrorist Magneto to stop a hate-Mongers insidious plot and to simply ensure the continuation of the mutant race.THE COOL STUFFS:Going far beyond the first movie, even more mutants from the comics make appearances in this movie including Beast, Siryn, Colossus, Shadowcat, etc.  The action sequences in this film are MUCH improved from the first one. Making their ""major"" debuts in this film are Iceman, Pyro, Nightcrawler and Deathstrike.One of the great improvements in this movie is the simple fact that Wolverine is allowed more free reign in this film to simply kick butt.  One of my pet peeves with the first film was the amount of ""pulling of punches"" they did with the violence level.  That is not an issue with this film. Wolverine was allowed to go into ""berserker"" mode and cut the bad guys up in this film.For comic purists some developments in this film include a further look into Wolverine's Weapon X background as well as Jean Grey's Phoenix powers.PET PEEVES:I still take SOME issue with the movie's disregard for the comic's original continuity and storylines.  Iceman and Rogue as well as Pyro are presented as classmates at Xavier's.  Oh well,  the improved action makes up for some of this.Best Scenes:1. Nightcrawler versus the Secret Service2. Wolverine and Colossus defending the school3. Pyro takes out the cops4. Professor X uses Cerebro5. Wolverine vs. DeathstrikeTHE VERDICT:Waaaaay better than the first.

Anno,"[0, 1]","Bryan Singer, who became a Marvel Master after just one film adaptation of the classic comics, follows X-Men with this engaging sequel, which is as profound and intelligent as it is visually impressive and audience-pleasing. Despite introducing the blue-skinned, teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler, and becoming more action-alert than the first film, X2's spotlight is shone on Logan/Wolverine as he inches closer to uncovering the truth behind his past. But before he can do so, he must match wits with the iniquitous scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox), whose past is as murky and mingled as Logan's own.Singer's continuation of the eventual trilogy (not counting the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine)--one that ended with 2006's unworthy The Last Stand (which Singer opted out of to direct Superman Returns)--was one of 2003's top-grossing box-office hits, raking in over $85 million in its first weekend alone and nearly $215 million all-together, far exceeding its predecessor (which earned barely over $157 million), and is certainly one of the sci-fi genre's most exciting films.

Ludwig,"[34, 38]","Hey, pardon my pun, but it's so refreshing to see a comic book movie that doesn't feel like solely a comic book movie that could never happen even in a parallel dimension that looked like a comic book. I mean, yes, Daredevil and Batman and all the rest were fun and all, but they never had the ""look"" that made you say, ""by God, they've done it, I'm looking at life anew!"" Well, with X-2, they've done it, my friends...The first X-Men film was a necessary sacrificial lamb. With so many characters, good and bad, and each character having all their own ongoing multiple storylines and backgrounds and yadda yadda yadda, the first flick chopped all the excess fat and brought the comic book to life in a very realistic and engrossing world...However, it did have its flaws as well as a flat climax that felt like merely a prologue for future X-Films rather than a memorable first entry (though still better than most comic book tripe nevertheless).X-2 one-ups all of that, though...Everyone from the first is back for more and even some newbies hitch a ride. Nightcrawler has been made into a gem of a character by Alan Cumming. The opening sequence with him involved in an assassination attempt is awesome and unrelenting. Pyro was always a silly ""goofy-villain-with-bad-costume"" in the X-books but he's much more compelling as an angst-ridden teen fighting temptation from the dark side of mutant powers, kind of like Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episode 2, but in this film it doesn't make you the moviegoer roll your eyes or consider suicide. There's a brief cameo from Colossus, another goodie mutie who will no doubt have a bigger and highly anticiapted role in the inevitable (and very welcome) X-3...All the other charaters from the original are even better here and it's hard to give all of them equal playing time in such a movie, but in the end everyone knows the real title of these movies: ""Wolverine and his Amazing Friends."" Got it? Get used to it. Hugh Jackman as Wolvie is so good that it should be illegal to play a comic character that well. Absolutely criminal. Quick, someone call the acting police and give Michael Jai White a copy of X1 and X2, tell him that's how to play a badass. Then laugh at him for ruining ""Spawn"" anyway.Needless to say, the plot is a foregone conclusion here and it's all just an excuse to -gasp- develop the characters. What? A popcorn movie with unobtrusive character development?

Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 5]","Consider the first X-Men film a plot progressing set up, because from the first opening scene in X2 your thrown head first into one of, if not the, best comic to film adaptions of all time, and one of the few times a sequel out do's the original. Almost all of the first film's entire ensemble cast returns: Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Hugh Jackman (ever perfect as Wolverine), Ian McKellan (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) are all back. Also, the film goes more in depth with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and introduces us to beloved characters Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming who turns out to be nearly perfect in the role) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). The storyline finds the X-Men months after the events in the first film, under siege by General Stryker (Brian Cox) who has his own agenda for mutant kind. Eventually the X-Men must team up with Magneto to stop him, and this is where the film shines. Director Brian Singer was critiqued quite a bit when it was said that the first film wasn't action packed enough; well, he made up for it here as X2 is action packed from beginning to end and the film pushes the limits of it's PG-13 rating. The performances are great, and while Jackman is his usually terrific self as Wolverine, he isn't the focus this time around and we get to see Berry more developed as Storm, Romijn-Stamos gets more screen time as well, and Janssen is better now as Jean Grey than anyone could have ever thought before. The special effects are nothing short of incredible; from Wolvie popping his claws to Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) popping hers, to Colossus' body turning to steel to Pyro's fire spewing shootout with the cops you will be in awe of the special effects wizardry. The only complaint here is that with the exception up towards the end of the film is once again Cyclops is a criminally underused character. Marsden is a good actor and Cyclops is a very interesting character and it is a shame he has gone so underused. All in all, X2 is much better than I could have ever hoped it to be, and this is undoubtadly one of the finest comic to film adaptions of all time.",5,Light years beyond the first film,1061942400,"08 27, 2003",2003,2234,"['Consider', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'plot', 'progressing', 'set', 'up', 'first', 'opening', 'scene', 'X2', 'thrown', 'head', 'first', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'comic', 'film', 'adaptions', 'time', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'sequel', 'out', 'do', 'original', 'Almost', 'first', 'film', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'returns', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Professor', 'X', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'ever', 'perfect', 'Wolverine', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Magneto', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Storm', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Cyclops', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Rogue', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'Mystique', 'are', 'back', 'Also', 'film', 'more', 'depth', 'Iceman', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'Pyro', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'beloved', 'characters', 'Nightcrawler', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'role', 'Colossus', 'Daniel', 'Cudmore', 'storyline', 'X-Men', 'months', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'siege', 'General', 'Stryker', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'own', 'agenda', 'mutant', 'kind', 'Eventually', 'X-Men', 'must', 'team', 'up', 'Magneto', 'stop', 'where', 'film', 'shines', 'Director', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'was', 'critiqued', 'quite', 'bit', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'first', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'action', 'packed', 'enough', 'well', 'made', 'up', 'here', 'X2', 'action', 'packed', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'limits', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Jackman', 'usually', 'terrific', 'self', 'Wolverine', ""n't"", 'focus', 'time', 'around', 'get', 'see', 'Berry', 'more', 'developed', 'Storm', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'well', 'Janssen', 'better', 'now', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'before', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'incredible', 'Wolvie', 'popping', 'claws', 'Deathstrike', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'popping', 'hers', 'Colossus', 'body', 'turning', 'steel', 'Pyro', 'fire', 'spewing', 'shootout', 'cops', 'will', 'be', 'awe', 'special', 'effects', 'only', 'complaint', 'here', 'exception', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'Cyclops', 'criminally', 'underused', 'character', 'Marsden', 'good', 'actor', 'Cyclops', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'shame', 'gone', 'so', 'underused', 'X2', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'hoped', 'be', 'undoubtadly', 'one', 'finest', 'comic', 'film', 'adaptions', 'time']",N/A

""X2"" has more ground-pounding action and suspense, dynamic fighting scenes, more laugh-out-loud humor, and more awesome special effects than what the first ""X-Men"" film gave you back in 2000! Director Singer did a tremendous job in making this sequel and I see no reason why they should ever replace him in case there is a script for ""X3""! The all-star cast from the first film, including Patrick Stewart (TV's ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""), Hugh Jackman (""Swordfish""), Ian McKellen (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), Oscar winner Halle Berry (007: ""Die Another Day""), Famke Janssen (007: ""Goldeneye""), James Marsden (""Disturbing Behavior""), Anna Paquin (""Finding Forrester""), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (""Femme Fatale""), and a brief appearance by Bruce Davison (""X-Men""), gave flawless performances all the way, which makes ""X2"" the best film in their careers! Joining the original cast are Alan Cumming (""Spy Kids""), Brian Cox (""The Ring""), Kelly Hu (""The Scorpion King""), Shawn Ashmore (seen briefly in ""X-Men""), and Aaron Stanford (""Tadpole""), in which they too did an outstanding job with their performances.""X2"", in a nutshell, focuses on Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) and his team of X-Men: Storm (Berry), Cyclops (Marsden), Jean Grey (Janssen), Rogue (Paquin), and last, definitely not least, Wolverine (Jackman), as they and their enemies Magneto (McKellen) and Mystique (Romijn-Stamos) team up against a common enemy. The common enemy: General William Stryker (Cox), a renegade military leader with only one purpose in mind: mutant genocide by way of the Anti-Mutant Registration Act. During the film, ""X2"" also introduces us to some new characters, including Nightcrawler (Cumming), a.k.a. Kurt Wagner (pronounced ""Vagner""), who has the ability to teleport through walls and other objects in no time flat, Iceman (Ashmore), a.k.a. Bobby Drake, who has the ability to freeze anyone or anything he touches, Pyro (Stanford), a.k.a. John, who has the ability to manipulate fire, and Deathstrike (Hu), a.k.a. Yuriko Oyama, who has the same amount of abilities as Wolverine has, but different. And you'll see what I mean when she and Wolverine go head-to-head against each other! The film also talks about Wolverine trying to piece together some answers about his shadowy past that made him what he is right now. And, as with any comic-based film adaptation, there will definitely be some surprises along the way!In conclusion, ""X2"", without a doubt, will easily be one of the best summer films ever made (although ""X2"" will be in competition with ""The Matrix: Reloaded"", ""The Hulk"", and ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""), not to mention that it will be one of the best films of 2003! With powerful storytelling, top-notch performances, suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and special effects that will blow you away, ""X2"" will be among one of those films that reminds us as to why we go to the movies in the first place! ""X2"" is a film that you'll want to watch over and over again, and you'll see why when it is released on DVD!

771370,ASY6KK1FIED52,B0000BWVCJ,"""nukemind""","[3, 3]","X2 is probably the best sequel to a superhero film since Superman II.  Yes, it's that good and easily surpasses the first film in every way.  The first film was perhaps necessary as an introduction to the many people who hadn't heard of the X-Men.  With this film, the X-Men are back and more of the traditional old school ""new"" X-Men are introduced.  The film is loosely based upon an X-Men graphic novel called ""God Loves, Man Kills"" as well as borrowed snippets from other X-Men stories (including the beginning of the Phoenix saga) that have been fused together for the screenplay that brings in a few original elements as well.  The theme of man's intolerance towards his fellow man continues as the forces of hate attempt to destroy the mutants.  X2 promotes this theme quite effectively as it also tackles real issues, sometimes in allegorical form, such as terrorism and what constitutes a freedom fighter.  The opening sequence with Nightcrawler (a new X-Man not seen in the first film) makes his appearance in a big way in the compelling opening segment.  The action is non-stop and the characters are all so interesting that many of them could indeed have films of their own.  This comes with the decades of comicbook material that has been written for them of course.  Thus, Wolverine's rapid falling in love scenario reflects the attraction between Logan and Jean Grey in the comics that has taken years to develop, whereas in the film it's more of a love at first sight compression due to time constraints.  This is fine as the movie attempts to cover a lot of ground and manages to do so by sacrificing natural character development for a very big cast of characters.Singer deserves a lot of credit for making a film that is literally teeming with interesting characters though.  In such films, it can be reduced to a convoluted mess.  Not so with Singer's able direction.  The characters mostly get their limelight moments (some more than others), but it is the sum of the parts that make the movie fun to watch.  For those uninitiated with comicbooks, the story might be difficult to follow, but if you pay attention it can be accessible to anyone.  If you know the background of the characters, you'll understand everything without too much effort.  For laypersons, the special effects and action alone are worth the price of admission.I recommend this film to the many readers of the X-Men who grew up reading about their world where issues regarding diversity and tolerance were explored with an increasingly adult slant.  This film brought back some great memories of my childhood and teenhood and for that alone I was very entertained.  The acting by the principal actors is top-notch with Sir Ian McKellan having the presence with the most gravitas, while Brian Cox again delivers a great job as the villain of the piece.  Hugh Jackman is a great Wolverine and inbues his character with the right balance of style and emotion.  Alan Cumming deserves some mention for his German accented Nightcrawler rendition, as he acts convincingly through the tons of makeup.  The rest of the cast all play their parts quite effectively as well.  It's rumored that Halle Berry was not pleased with her shortened screen-time and perhaps the next film will give her Storm character more of a pivotal role.  The star of the X-Men is Wolverine though.  He is the most popular in the comics because he combines a sense of danger and mystery that interests people.  Thus, for this reason, the events in the X-Men emanate from Wolverine, sometimes to the detriment of the other characters.  So although this is an ensemble piece, it's a Wolverine-centered film and I, for one, have no problem with that.  And I can't wait for X-Men 3, which will, no doubt, feature the Dark Phoenix (another revered storyline from the comics) saga that is probably the most definitive X-Men story written.",5,X2-Wolverine remains the star with an ever expanding cast,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,3891,"['X2', 'probably', 'best', 'sequel', 'superhero', 'film', 'Superman', 'II', 'Yes', 'good', 'easily', 'first', 'film', 'way', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'perhaps', 'necessary', 'introduction', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'X-Men', 'film', 'X-Men', 'are', 'back', 'more', 'traditional', 'old', 'school', 'new', 'X-Men', 'are', 'introduced', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'X-Men', 'graphic', 'novel', 'called', 'God', 'Loves', 'Man', 'Kills', 'as', 'well', 'borrowed', 'snippets', 'other', 'X-Men', 'stories', 'including', 'beginning', 'Phoenix', 'saga', 'have', 'been', 'fused', 'together', 'screenplay', 'few', 'original', 'elements', 'well', 'theme', 'man', 'intolerance', 'fellow', 'man', 'forces', 'hate', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'mutants', 'X2', 'theme', 'quite', 'effectively', 'also', 'real', 'issues', 'sometimes', 'allegorical', 'form', 'such', 'terrorism', 'what', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Nightcrawler', 'new', 'X-Man', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'film', 'appearance', 'big', 'way', 'compelling', 'opening', 'segment', 'action', 'non-stop', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'interesting', 'many', 'could', 'indeed', 'have', 'films', 'own', 'decades', 'comicbook', 'material', 'been', 'written', 'course', 'Thus', 'Wolverine', 'rapid', 'falling', 'love', 'scenario', 'attraction', 'Logan', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'comics', 'taken', 'years', 'develop', 'whereas', 'film', 'more', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'compression', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'fine', 'movie', 'attempts', 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'manages', 'do', 'so', 'sacrificing', 'natural', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'big', 'cast', 'characters.Singer', 'lot', 'credit', 'making', 'film', 'literally', 'teeming', 'interesting', 'characters', 'such', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'Not', 'so', 'Singer', 'able', 'direction', 'characters', 'mostly', 'get', 'limelight', 'moments', 'more', 'others', 'sum', 'parts', 'make', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'uninitiated', 'comicbooks', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'follow', 'pay', 'attention', 'can', 'be', 'accessible', 'anyone', 'know', 'background', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'everything', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'laypersons', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'many', 'readers', 'X-Men', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'world', 'where', 'issues', 'regarding', 'diversity', 'tolerance', 'were', 'explored', 'increasingly', 'adult', 'slant', 'film', 'brought', 'back', 'great', 'memories', 'childhood', 'teenhood', 'alone', 'was', 'very', 'entertained', 'acting', 'principal', 'actors', 'top-notch', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'having', 'presence', 'most', 'gravitas', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'again', 'great', 'job', 'villain', 'piece', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'great', 'Wolverine', 'inbues', 'character', 'right', 'balance', 'style', 'emotion', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'mention', 'German', 'accented', 'Nightcrawler', 'rendition', 'convincingly', 'tons', 'makeup', 'rest', 'cast', 'play', 'parts', 'quite', 'effectively', 'as', 'well', 'rumored', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'was', 'not', 'pleased', 'shortened', 'screen-time', 'perhaps', 'next', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'Storm', 'character', 'more', 'pivotal', 'role', 'star', 'X-Men', 'Wolverine', 'most', 'popular', 'comics', 'sense', 'danger', 'mystery', 'interests', 'people', 'Thus', 'reason', 'events', 'X-Men', 'emanate', 'Wolverine', 'sometimes', 'detriment', 'other', 'characters', 'So', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Wolverine-centered', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'X-Men', '3', 'will', 'doubt', 'feature', 'Dark', 'Phoenix', 'revered', 'storyline', 'comics', 'saga', 'probably', 'most', 'definitive', 'X-Men', 'story', 'written']",N/A

The story, which takes place after the events of the original X-Men, is no slouch. Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) is coping with his origins, Jean-Grey(Famke Janseen) has those nasty headaches, Xavier(played wonderfully by Patrick Stewart) is still the strong father figure, Cyclops still stands around, and we are introduced to one of the coolest characters to grace a film adaptation of a comic book series, Nightcrawler. The film also introduces a rather... ""human"" villain, Stryker, which has a dastardly plan to eliminate all of our heroes. The plot is complex, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, and the pace is fast, making sure all of the audience is kept intrigued. I personally enjoyed X2 far more than ""The Last Stand"", and for good reason. Director Bryan Singer has a knack to make some of the most bland scenes fun and tense, and all of the battles or actions scenes really never get old, specifically the beginning of the film with Nightcrawler. The Blu-Ray is one of the finest representations I have seen yet! The colors are spot-on, the black levels are inky, and the contrast is never blown out. The DTS-HD MA is also a great mix, with surrounds used to wonderful effect. Dialogue is never an issue, and the bass is definitely powerful. Skip to the scene where the ""Invaders"" go into the institute, and you will hear exactly what I mean.

However Singer does still get bogged down on introducing new characters and forming many various plot lines that all need to be covered in the space of two hours.

Just about all of the characters in this movie have a balanced time on screen and they all get to show off their powers. The only one who was left out was Cyclops. But he does have more to do this time than last time. Storm gets a lot more to say and plays an important role in the outcome of the story.

She went from a nobody in the first film to the most incredibly cool character in this one! When you go to see this movie be on the look out for Gambit's name on a computer screen (Remy LeBeau) and Beast on a TV screen (Hank McCoy.)

I've watched and read everything I possibly could on X-men in my youth and I must say the movies live up to my expetations of it lots of action and fighting! With some politics and slight romance. However, some of the scenes [two to be exact] have sexual content that borderlines the PG-13 rating ""almost"" but it doesn't go overboard [thanfully]. be sure to think twice before letting a younger child see this or just cover his/her eyes with your hands. The fights are outstanding, they really get your blood flowing and send shivers down your spine! The battle between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was too cool, and there is one scene that might remind some of DBZ [Dragon ball Z], but I'm not telling. The plot is also exceptional much like its predecessor. ""After a devastating attempt on the President's life, and the revelation that a mutant was involved, public pressure to ratify the Mutant Registration Act increases, an act which would force all mutants in the nation to publicly declare themselves mutants and dictate the nature of all of their powers to the federal government.""An attack on Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted (labeled a Mutant training facility by the media), leads to an unlikely alliance with the recently escaped Magneto in a frantic race to stop William Stryker, a military leader with a hatred of mutants, before he can succeed in his plan to destroy all mutants.Stryker has orchestrated the attack on the President to get official approval for his attack on all mutants.He is able to control mutants with a powerful drug, and gains control over Professor Xavier through Jason, one of the professor's former students, who is able to project powerful visions in the mind, blinding a person to reality. Stryker has created a copy of Professor Xavier's machine Cerebro which, we learn, was invented by then-friends Professor Xavier and Magneto. In the process, Wolverine learns some of his forgotten past and how his body was enhanced with a superstrong adamantium skeleton.""

771381,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B0000BWVCJ,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","If nothing else, this film stays very loyal to the constancy set up by the first film.  Most of the cast return, mainly all those whose characters didn't die.  The conflict, or the ""war"" as Magneto puts it, is still there and this is another battle.Magneto, played by Sir Ian McKellen, is still in his specially-designed plastic prison (again, an awesome facility) and a no menace comes to take up the mantle of the film's antagonist.  This menace is covert government operative William Stryker, played by Brian Cox, who seeks to eliminate mutants from the Earth altogether.  He leads an attack on the X-mansion where Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, who's just returned from a failed expedition that might have provided clues about his mysterious past, realizes he has a history with the madman.Wolverine and several students escape Stryker's soldiers and head out to reunite with Storm and Jean Grey, played by Halle Berry and Famke Janssen respectively, who are tracking down the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler, played by Alan Cumming, up in Boston.  Meanwhile, Professor Charles Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart, and Scott Summers/Cyclops, played by James Marsden, are captured while visiting Magneto in his plastic prison to ask him about a recent assassination attempt on the President of the United States, an attack they know Nightcrawler is responsible for but believe that there's someone else behind it.  And then there's the fact that Magneto escapes from this prison with the aide of Mystique, played by Rebecca Romijn, soon after all these attacks...that's quite a setup.This film immediately did not rehash what happened in the first film via either long flashbacks or a repeat of the plot.  No, this was very much a continuation of the story and that is awesome.  It lived up to its predecessor and left us all excited about what would happen next.  Scott Summers developed a bit more of a personality, though I'm hesitant to say that's a good thing because he was possessed for about half of his scenes.  Alan Cumming was a great addition as the teleporting Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, though I found his opening scene a little too farfetched...really, the bullets follow him while he's teleporting?  They get close enough to do that but he's not wounded or taken down by them?  It defies my suspension of disbelief.Overall, a great follow-up and living proof that the world of the X-Men, and comic book movies, still have much to offer.  And this might be the kid inside me talking, but I really enjoyed Patrick Stewart's monologue to the President near the end.  Of course, Hugh Jackman's closing line definitely helped.

771388,A319YRDK8Y39N,B0000BWVCJ,"""qmlhcb""","[0, 0]","I was absolutely blown away by this movie. And that's an understatement.If you've read many of my reviews, you'd know how rare it is for me to give any movie five stars. I save them for films that really do something to me, and that usually means heavy dramas like ""The Pianist"" or revolutionary films like ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Moulin Rouge."" No way did I expect ""X2"" to wear the same crown.Sure I had seen the first film, and been moderately happy with it flaws and all. When I heard a big positive buzz on this one though, I became excited. Much better then the first? Cool. And that's the frame of mind I went in to see it with, thinking it would be a significantly better film then the one I gave three stars to; say maybe a four star movie.This, my friends, is now my favorite comic book movie. Sorry original Batman and Superman films, sorry Spiderman. You used to be my top picks, but ""X2"" came along. Go figure it'd be a sequel.""X2"" does everything right the first one did wrong. Many amazing action scenes, each one better then the best moments in the original. Stronger characterizations and relationship building. A much stronger plot that is more involving, urgent and dire. And an ending that impacts you with a crater-sized hole. It's true that it borrows a lot from other great sci-fi films. The ending is, in fact, a quite obvious lift from another well known franchise. But I found I didn't care. That's because director Bryan Singer and his crew did the job right and created equally strong versions of prior-used themes and scenes...But my favorite moments all stem from the characterization incorporated into the film (such as a scene with Wolverine and various students at the school on what seems to be a normal night), and the flushing out of its theme of prejudice. ""X2"" takes the first film's analogy comparing humans afraid of X-men to real world homophobia to a new level. Military renegade Will Striker (Brian Cox) has been determined to ""heal"" mutants to make them regular human, similar to real groups that try to convert homosexuals to be straight. The ability comic books and their films have (along with other sci-fi tales) to deal with current issues in an analogy is a fantastic way to deal with subjects, and ""X2"" doesn't come close to dropping the ball. Oh, and there are just so many memorable moments in ""X2."" Every few minutes in the film, I saw something I tried to remember, only to forget it shortly after by another great scene. Look for them, but you'll probably have to see it again just to remember them all.This movie does have some minor flaws, but really they're just nit-picks. ""X2"" doesn't really allow you to dwell on them though, because the next genius scene will wipe any memory of them away. Check this one out.

It is no wonder that the movie was one of the biggest hits of 2000.""X2: X-men"" goes more in-depth in answering some of the questions that plagued me about part one, chiefly the origin of Logan/Wolverine, the Wolverine/Cyclops/Jean Grey triangle, and the uneasy relationship between Professor X and Magneto. There are also some intriguing introductions (Pryo, Colossus, and Iceman) that set the stage for further development in the subsequent third episode.While the special effects are eye-popping, the actors underneath all that latex and muscle manage to pull off some pretty believable performances. The classically trained Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen show why they are at the top of their craft. Critics may scoff that a film like ""X2"" is not of the same caliber of, say ""A Beautiful Mind"", but that should not belittle the actors that bring life to their respective roles. With such a large ensemble cast, it is logical that screen time is limited, but Halle Berry, James Marsden, and Anna Paquin do the best that they can in the allotment given them.Brian Cox is appropriately sinister as the nemesis to mutants everywhere. He seems to have graduated from the Rip Torn School of Villainy.And Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, as well as Kelly Hu, could show those ""angels"" that work for a man named ""Charlie"" a thing or two about butt kicking. The damsels are stunning in appearance and craft.Newcomer Allan Cumming (""Nightcrawler"") brings just the right about of pathos and savagery to his role as a manipulated mutant.

In the near future, an assassination attempt on the US President by an unknown mutant triggers a vengeful military scientist's (Brian Cox) plot to destroy all mutants. Now to ensure their future, the X-Men must rely on the aid of new allies and old rivals to save millions of lives. ""X2"" is one of those rare sequels that actually succeed over the original. The 2004 summer blockbuster contains a complex but well-structured storyline, a top-notch cast and some strong emotional subplots. Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and Ian McKellen deliver some fine performances. Hugh Jackman continues to superbly dominate the role of Wolverine and Alan Cummings is stunning as the gentle teleporting Nightcrawler. Director Bryan Singer adds much excitement in this sequel without diminishing the value of its story and characters. The action sequences and visual effects are quite amazing and a considerable improvement over the first film.If you thought that ""X-Men 1.5"" was a great DVD then you'll be pleasantly surprised with ""X2: X-Men United"" 2-Disc Widescreen Edition.

771405,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000BWVCJ,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 6]","""X2: X-Men United"" is the widely admired sequel to ""X-Men,"" one of the finest movies ever to be derived from a comic book series.  The original film, in addition to being a superb piece of action cinema, dealt with such weighty issues as prejudice and alienation, showing how groups of people who are seen as ""different"" from the norm are often ostracized from and mistreated by society as a whole.  By creating an entirely new set of people to serve as its outcasts - in this case, mutants endowed with extraordinary physical and mental powers - the film was able to strip the issue of bigotry down to its barest essentials and to make us see anew just how great a part ""irrational fear of the unknown"" plays in determining the ways we treat others.  Quite an accomplishment for a film that was designed, essentially, to be little more than a commercial popcorn entertainment.This second entry in the series, though it has generally received more positive reviews than the first one, seems less concerned with message and theme and more concerned with action and plotting.  Part of the reason for this may lie in the fact that the initial film, because it was introducing both the characters and the concepts to the audience, was forced by necessity to deal with the theme in a more direct and comprehensive manner.  Perhaps when it came to ""X2,"" director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter simply felt that the theme had been explored sufficiently in the first installment and that any further concentration on it would appear redundant.  The problem is that, without that added intellectual and sociological dimension, ""X2"" starts to feel an awful lot like every other comic book action film - heavy on adventure and special effects and weak on character development and point.  In fact, even with the added bonus of almost 30 extra minutes in this episode (it runs an overlong 134 minutes), many of the characters in the film do little but stand around and look helpless while a select few run around saving the day and getting all the valuable screen time.There's a wonderful scene about halfway through the film in which a teenage mutant boy ""comes out"" to his genuinely astonished parents, informing them that their ""ordinary, average"" child (whom they had just considered ""highly gifted"") has been harboring a deep dark secret within himself, a revelation that no parent would ever want to hear and no child would ever want to have to make.  The reaction of both stunned disbelief and reluctant acceptance (""We still love you no matter what you are"") on the part of the boy's family speaks to anyone who has had to face a similar situation in his own life.  ""X2"" could use more scenes like this one to help the audience connect better with both the characters and the events taking place on screen.  And it was scenes like this one that made the original ""X-Men"" soar as a movie, for that film really seemed to be able to zero in on universal aspects of human nature.  ""X2"" doesn't do nearly as impressive a job in this regard.Every so often, ""X2"" feels as if it too is getting ready to expound on one of its potentially intriguing themes - as when the President of the United States has to decide whether to take draconian action against what he believes may be a ""terrorist"" organization among the mutants - only to have the concern fizzle in a welter of action movie clich&eacute;s.  After all, what could be more pertinent, timely or relevant to today's world than the threat of terrorism and the potential for civil rights abuses arising from the fear it causes?  Instead of making this premise the crux of their movie as they should have, the filmmakers drag all the characters over to some secret underground complex next to a snowbound lake to do battle with a pretty conventional villain and have them indulge in all the explosions, gun battles, kickboxing fight sequences etc. that are the standard accoutrements of any self-respecting modern day action film.People seem to be enamored of ""X2,"" even more, perhaps, than they were of the original ""X-Men.""  I wish I could count myself among them.  But as one who genuinely loved the original, I must say that I am less than enamored with this particular installment.  I may be a minority dissenting voice in this regard, but I view ""X2,"" for all its special effects wizardry, as a disappointing missed opportunity, a film that fails to develop on a deeper level the great themes that were laid out for it in the original.

Well, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and the rest of them are good lawbreakers, then. X-2 is excellent. It picks up where the first leaves off, but because it doesn't have to spend time doing the ""set up"" as the first movie did, it can get up and running right away, which it does. X-2 almost never slows down except to let you catch your breath for a moment, then takes off again.Nightcrawler is extremely well done; he was a much-anticipated addition to the cast, and he works well. The changes in his background were expected, and they manage to keep the essence of his character unchanged.Halle Berry, who seemed rather uncertain of how to portray Storm in the first movie, has stepped forward and grabbed the opportunity to play one of the coolest female characters in comicdom with both hands. NOW we see the woman that was once worshipped as a goddess, who has both beauty and a force of presence hard to rival on any count. Well done!Jean Grey and Scott Summers... we're finally getting some of the chemistry right here.Hugh Jackman's Wolverine just keeps getting better. He seems to have ""gotten"" the idea early on, but with the additional screen time he's managed to seriously hone the presentation.Stewart and McKellen... what a team. Both have marvelous stage presence and acting ability, and project their characters with an intensity rarely seen in ANY type of film. Xavier's warmth of character and Magneto's fanatical, Machiavellian attitude both dominate their respective scenes (Magneto's jailbreak is one of the more horrific scenes I've watched recently, even though it manages to avoid extreme gore).The overall plotline works well, drawing on several of the comic's most successful themes and characters while adding the necessary unique approach for a movie version. The ending clearly sets up for X3 what is probably the single most well-known sequence in comic-book history; the question is whether it will be possible for them to pull it off.Wonderful superhero work.

771411,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0000BWVCJ,Samuel McKewon,"[22, 22]","The defining characteristic of ""X2: X-Men United"" is the approval bestowed upon it by fans of the origin comic books; whereas the original ""X-Men"" movie was seen as truncated and flat in parts, the sequel delivers the goods fans craved: a full half-hour more action, and a dazzling opening sequence that features a mutant attack on the U.S. President. The mutant is a newcomer: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) a German circus runaway with blue skin that can bounce and teleport at alarming speeds. Director Bryan Singer watched his first ""X-Men"" effort start with a slow burn of introducing the setup and character; ""X2"" had the ""geeks"" bouncing out of their seats.What follows is a superhero movie on par with ""Spider-Man"" and the best parts of the ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" series. ""X2"" is a too busy and farfetched, but it keeps twisting, and it features a great villain in Col. Styker (Brian Cox) a military scientist bent on erasing the mutants from the Earth. In theme and approach, ""X2"" is similar to the second and best installment of the ""Star Trek"" series, ""Wrath of Khan"" -- ""X2"" features a large sacrifice from a major character, and serves as a launching pad for future installments. Just about anything could happen in ""X3,"" and that's a testament to how well this movie is structured. Every important mutant is still on the playing field.After the Nightcrawler attack -- a spectacular, dizzying assault through the hallways of the White House right to the president's desk -- ""X2"" sends its characters in various directions. Stryker, who has the president's ear, convinces the chief that the mysterious mutant school run by wheelchair-bound Xavier (Patrick Stewart) could be behind the attack. The real source is a nifty twist, but Stryker nonetheless storms the school while Xavier is away visiting his imprisoned enemy/friend Magneto (Ian McKellen).Though human, Stryker is as formidable as either Xavier or Magneto -- he has methods of coercing mutants, putting him in position to rid the world of them through Cerebro, a special tracking machine only Xavier can use; how Stryker tricks Xavier into using it is one of the movie's best secrets. Because Stryker means to destroy the mutants for good; Magneto sets aside his grudge match with Xavier to save both their hides, hence the title.Stryker also holds the key to the identity of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the steel-knuckled, mutton-chopped tough man of the mutant school. ""X2"" has a full plate of characters, but Jackman's the star; Wolverine does most of the fighting, and serves as a romantic possibility for X-woman Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), a telekinetic with growing strength and X-girl Rogue (Anna Paquin), whose powers were coveted in the original movie, but not worth much this time.Also onboard is Storm (Halle Berry) who finds and connects with a confused Nightcrawler, and bad-girl Mystique (Rebecca Romejn-Stamos) whose shape-shifting gifts bust Magneto out of prison and hack into Stryker's computer for his master plan.Singer strains to offer every mutant decent screen time, which spreads ""X2"" a little too thin in the middle; one mutant that figured prominently in the first movie, Cyclops (James Marsden), mostly tags along in the sequel. Despite the generosity, Cox and Jackman return the forefront again and again as Stryker and Wolverine size each other up. Cox, actually, has played a similar role once before in the terrible Keanu Reeves vehicle ""Chain Reaction;"" what seemed cartoonish about his military monster in that movie works just about perfect here. Jackman  has a look about him that fits the part, and he's surprisingly funny to boot -- the throwaway lines of  David Hayter's script are one of ""X2's"" prime pleasures.There aren't as many action sequences as you'd expect -- the canvas is so big, a good part of the movie is spent just leaving and arriving -- and none match the opening Nightcrawler attack, but there is enough for a fight junkie to appreciate. And though there's a bit of social commentary mixed into the movie's fabric, ""X2"" is nothing less than a fantasy. There's a climax, so to speak, beyond the climax, and then another climax beyond that, which is annoying, but it sets the table for a major transformation of Jean's character. Singer obviously has his options wide open for the third installment, which will presumably pit good and bad mutants against one another again. ""X2"" ends with Magneto having gained a precious new weapon for round three.For what it does, ""X2"" does it very well. Singer is clearly serious about not letting the franchise descend into camp as ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" eventually did -- there are dumb moments, but they're quickly forgotten. It improves on the original and improves the chances of the series at the same time.",4,Top shelf superhero movie,1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,4774,"['defining', 'characteristic', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'approval', 'bestowed', 'fans', 'origin', 'comic', 'books', 'original', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'was', 'seen', 'truncated', 'flat', 'parts', 'sequel', 'goods', 'fans', 'craved', 'full', 'half-hour', 'more', 'action', 'dazzling', 'opening', 'sequence', 'mutant', 'attack', 'U.S.', 'President', 'mutant', 'newcomer', 'Nightcrawler', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'German', 'circus', 'runaway', 'blue', 'skin', 'can', 'bounce', 'teleport', 'alarming', 'speeds', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'watched', 'first', 'X-Men', 'effort', 'start', 'slow', 'burn', 'introducing', 'setup', 'character', 'X2', 'had', 'geeks', 'bouncing', 'seats.What', 'superhero', 'movie', 'par', 'Spider-Man', 'best', 'parts', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'series', 'X2', 'too', 'busy', 'farfetched', 'twisting', 'great', 'villain', 'Col.', 'Styker', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'military', 'scientist', 'bent', 'erasing', 'mutants', 'Earth', 'theme', 'approach', 'X2', 'similar', 'second', 'best', 'installment', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'X2', 'large', 'sacrifice', 'major', 'character', 'launching', 'pad', 'future', 'installments', 'Just', 'anything', 'could', 'happen', 'X3', 'testament', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'structured', 'important', 'mutant', 'still', 'playing', 'field.After', 'Nightcrawler', 'attack', 'spectacular', 'dizzying', 'assault', 'hallways', 'White', 'House', 'right', 'president', 'desk', 'X2', 'characters', 'various', 'directions', 'Stryker', 'who', 'president', 'ear', 'chief', 'mysterious', 'mutant', 'school', 'run', 'wheelchair-bound', 'Xavier', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'could', 'be', 'attack', 'real', 'source', 'nifty', 'twist', 'Stryker', 'nonetheless', 'school', 'Xavier', 'away', 'visiting', 'imprisoned', 'enemy/friend', 'Magneto', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'human', 'Stryker', 'as', 'formidable', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'methods', 'coercing', 'mutants', 'putting', 'position', 'rid', 'world', 'Cerebro', 'special', 'tracking', 'machine', 'only', 'Xavier', 'can', 'use', 'how', 'Stryker', 'Xavier', 'using', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'secrets', 'Stryker', 'destroy', 'mutants', 'good', 'Magneto', 'aside', 'grudge', 'match', 'Xavier', 'save', 'hides', 'hence', 'title.Stryker', 'also', 'key', 'identity', 'Wolverine', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'steel-knuckled', 'mutton-chopped', 'tough', 'man', 'mutant', 'school', 'X2', 'full', 'plate', 'characters', 'Jackman', 'star', 'Wolverine', 'most', 'fighting', 'romantic', 'possibility', 'X-woman', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'telekinetic', 'growing', 'strength', 'X-girl', 'Rogue', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'powers', 'were', 'coveted', 'original', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'much', 'time.Also', 'onboard', 'Storm', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'confused', 'Nightcrawler', 'bad-girl', 'Mystique', 'Rebecca', 'Romejn-Stamos', 'shape-shifting', 'gifts', 'bust', 'Magneto', 'prison', 'hack', 'Stryker', 'computer', 'master', 'plan.Singer', 'offer', 'mutant', 'decent', 'screen', 'time', 'X2', 'little', 'too', 'thin', 'middle', 'one', 'mutant', 'figured', 'prominently', 'first', 'movie', 'Cyclops', 'James', 'Marsden', 'mostly', 'sequel', 'generosity', 'Cox', 'Jackman', 'return', 'forefront', 'again', 'again', 'Stryker', 'Wolverine', 'size', 'other', 'up', 'Cox', 'actually', 'played', 'similar', 'role', 'once', 'before', 'terrible', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'vehicle', 'Chain', 'Reaction', 'what', 'seemed', 'cartoonish', 'military', 'monster', 'movie', 'just', 'perfect', 'here', 'Jackman', 'look', 'part', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'boot', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'David', 'Hayter', 'script', 'are', 'one', 'X2', 'prime', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'action', 'sequences', ""'d"", 'expect', 'canvas', 'so', 'big', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'spent', 'just', 'leaving', 'arriving', 'none', 'match', 'opening', 'Nightcrawler', 'attack', 'enough', 'fight', 'junkie', 'appreciate', 'bit', 'social', 'commentary', 'mixed', 'movie', 'fabric', 'X2', 'nothing', 'less', 'fantasy', 'climax', 'so', 'speak', 'climax', 'then', 'climax', 'annoying', 'table', 'major', 'transformation', 'Jean', 'character', 'Singer', 'obviously', 'options', 'wide', 'open', 'third', 'installment', 'will', 'presumably', 'pit', 'good', 'bad', 'mutants', 'one', 'again', 'X2', 'Magneto', 'having', 'gained', 'precious', 'new', 'weapon', 'round', 'three.For', 'what', 'X2', 'very', 'well', 'Singer', 'clearly', 'serious', 'not', 'letting', 'franchise', 'descend', 'camp', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'eventually', 'did', 'are', 'dumb', 'moments', ""'re"", 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'original', 'chances', 'series', 'same', 'time']",N/A

771419,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0000BWVCJ,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[3, 17]","X2:X-men United is true to the Comics I used to the read when I was a teenager during the late 80's: convoluted story, a mishmash of plot threads and deaths and violence thrown in just for the sake of it. These movies aren't for us regular joes, they're just for the 30+ year old fanboys who live in their mother's basements and have been reading the comics since they were twelve or thirteen. Don't try to understand it; you'll lose your mind. I never understood why this book was so popular. It should be called X-Mess. I am so tired of these superhero movies. If you can't do them right please don't do them at all.In this pitiful installment, the movie starts with Nightcrawler attacks the president in the oval office in a beautiful special effects sequence. Sadly, this is the only part of the film worth watching. This assault leads to General Stryker to begin his campaign to attack mutants, starting with Xavier's school. Little does anyone know that General Stryker is the one behind the attack on the president. An added subplot is Wolverine searching for his past. In a long sequence, Professor X soon sispatches Storm and Jean Grey to take the blackbird and find Nightcrawler, While he and Cyclops go to talk to the imprisoned Magneto.Storm and Jean Grey find Nightcrawler and he tells them he didn't know anything. Jean surmises he was mind controlled. After the school is attacked, and we get a Colossus cameo Wolverine and a group of X-men hole up at Iceman's house. Iceman ""comes out"" to his parents. The police and military get whiff of this and we get to see Pyro do his thing. Soon the bad guys working at the prison get wind of Xavier and capture him and Cyclops. Magneto makes a thrilling escape with mystiques help. Soon the X-men and the evil mutants team up against Stryker, thus the title X-men united. Everything leads up to a long drawn out face-off at a secret base in a dam where Jean Grey sacrifices herself. Fanboys can drool at the Phoenix effect at the bottom of the lake at the end of the movie and save their pennies for the next sequel. These X-men movies blow chunks. Slow pacing, slow action sequences, and flat acting. In ten years people will be denouncing these movies the same way they do the first Batman Saga. Unfortunately, there won't be a Chris Nolan and David Goyer or a Sam Raimi around to rectify the mistake this time.What makes these movies so horrible is the attempt to please comic fans and not casual filmgoers. If you're a comic fan something like a Colossus cameo is cool, but to a regular moviegoer it means nothing because he does nothing but show up. While it is KEWL for them to use their powers, This takes away from time to develop characters who actually have speaking parts and a role in the story. This dilutes the already slow story and takes away from the overall pacing of the film and wastes valuable screen time main characters like Cyclops, Professor X and Jean Gray could have used to explain their parts of the story. (it's inexcusable the way Cyclops has been treated in this film series. He's the first X-man and leader of the group and he's been given the least amount of screen time.)Yeah, every comic fan wants to see their favorite character onscreen. However, in moviemaking  filmmakers have to focus on the principal characters and their role in the story.The acting is flat in this movie with the exception of a few actors because they get a full part written. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen Shawn Ashmore give solid performances because they actually get a substantial part. Alan Cumming is a great Nightcraler. Cumming steals every scene he's in, making the most of his screen time. James Marsden is an Okay Cyclops and Famke Janssen is a decent Jean Grey. Halle Berry is a terrible Storm. Seeing her in this film and the first one I can say she lacks the presence and personality to play this part. Halle's uninspired acting and facial expressions are a major drag on an already slow movie. Fast forward through her scenes.Pass this Trilogy by and pick up Sam Raimi's first Spider-man or The best superhero movie to date, The Incredibles.",1,"X-mess: Confusing, slow and convoluted.",1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,4141,"['X2', 'X-men', 'United', 'true', 'Comics', 'used', 'read', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'late', '80', 'convoluted', 'story', 'mishmash', 'plot', 'threads', 'deaths', 'violence', 'thrown', 'just', 'sake', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'regular', 'joes', ""'re"", 'just', '30+', 'year', 'old', 'fanboys', 'who', 'live', 'mother', 'basements', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'comics', 'were', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'understand', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'mind', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'X-Mess', 'am', 'so', 'tired', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'right', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'all.In', 'pitiful', 'installment', 'movie', 'Nightcrawler', 'president', 'oval', 'office', 'beautiful', 'special', 'effects', 'sequence', 'Sadly', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'assault', 'General', 'Stryker', 'begin', 'campaign', 'attack', 'mutants', 'starting', 'Xavier', 'school', 'Little', 'anyone', 'know', 'General', 'Stryker', 'one', 'attack', 'president', 'added', 'subplot', 'Wolverine', 'searching', 'past', 'long', 'sequence', 'Professor', 'X', 'soon', 'Storm', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'take', 'blackbird', 'find', 'Nightcrawler', 'Cyclops', 'go', 'talk', 'imprisoned', 'Magneto.Storm', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'find', 'Nightcrawler', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Jean', 'surmises', 'was', 'mind', 'controlled', 'school', 'attacked', 'get', 'Colossus', 'cameo', 'Wolverine', 'group', 'X-men', 'hole', 'up', 'Iceman', 'house', 'Iceman', 'out', 'parents', 'police', 'military', 'get', 'whiff', 'get', 'see', 'Pyro', 'do', 'thing', 'bad', 'guys', 'working', 'prison', 'get', 'wind', 'Xavier', 'capture', 'Cyclops', 'Magneto', 'thrilling', 'escape', 'mystiques', 'help', 'Soon', 'X-men', 'evil', 'mutants', 'team', 'up', 'Stryker', 'thus', 'title', 'X-men', 'united', 'Everything', 'up', 'long', 'drawn', 'face-off', 'secret', 'base', 'dam', 'where', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Fanboys', 'can', 'drool', 'Phoenix', 'effect', 'bottom', 'lake', 'end', 'movie', 'save', 'pennies', 'next', 'sequel', 'X-men', 'movies', 'chunks', 'Slow', 'pacing', 'slow', 'action', 'sequences', 'flat', 'acting', 'ten', 'years', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'denouncing', 'movies', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'first', 'Batman', 'Saga', 'Unfortunately', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'David', 'Goyer', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'rectify', 'mistake', 'movies', 'so', 'horrible', 'attempt', 'please', 'comic', 'fans', 'not', 'casual', 'filmgoers', ""'re"", 'comic', 'fan', 'something', 'Colossus', 'cameo', 'cool', 'regular', 'moviegoer', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'show', 'up', 'KEWL', 'use', 'powers', 'away', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'who', 'actually', 'have', 'speaking', 'parts', 'role', 'story', 'already', 'slow', 'story', 'away', 'overall', 'pacing', 'film', 'valuable', 'screen', 'time', 'main', 'characters', 'Cyclops', 'Professor', 'X', 'Jean', 'Gray', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'explain', 'parts', 'story', 'inexcusable', 'way', 'Cyclops', 'been', 'treated', 'film', 'series', 'first', 'X-man', 'leader', 'group', 'been', 'given', 'least', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'Yeah', 'comic', 'fan', 'see', 'favorite', 'character', 'onscreen', 'However', 'moviemaking', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'focus', 'principal', 'characters', 'role', 'story.The', 'acting', 'flat', 'movie', 'exception', 'few', 'actors', 'get', 'full', 'part', 'written', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'actually', 'get', 'substantial', 'part', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'great', 'Nightcraler', 'Cumming', 'steals', 'scene', 'making', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Okay', 'Cyclops', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'decent', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'terrible', 'Storm', 'Seeing', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'presence', 'personality', 'play', 'part', 'Halle', 'uninspired', 'acting', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'major', 'drag', 'already', 'slow', 'movie', 'Fast', 'forward', 'scenes.Pass', 'Trilogy', 'pick', 'up', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'first', 'Spider-man', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'date', 'Incredibles']",N/A
771420,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B0000BWVCJ,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[15, 23]","As with many movies of this genre, the viewer must suspend some common sense and accept a new reality. The premise of the X-Men franchise is that mankind is evolving... at a geometric rate.  While many remain as humans, more and more &quot;mutants&quot; are born everyday. Seemingly human on the outside, each mutant has a unique mutation that gives them a super-human power. There doesn't seem to be a true &quot;mutation&quot; that is not beneficial... no one is born with an ugly deformity, just a kick-butt super-power.Some can project flames with their thoughts, others can freeze anything they touch. Still others have super hearing, super vision, and some can walk through walls or teleport from one place to another.Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the proverbial godfather of the mutants, known as &quot;X-men.&quot;  While wheelchair bound, Xavier has incredible telepathic abilities. With what seems like an unlimited personal fortune, Xavier has built a school for the &quot;gifted,&quot; a refuge for kids and young adults who are mutants. Young mutants have their talents honed and learn to control their skills by former school graduates.Non-mutated humans are naturally scared of the mutants, which seem to be everywhere. A teleporting mutant wreaks havoc in the White House, knocking out all Secret Service agents before they can even aim their guns at him. The mutant simply delivers a message to the President, but knowing what this mutant is capable of is enough to make the public terrified and willing to suspend civil liberties to anyone exhibiting mutated powers.Nazi-camp survivor, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), is liberated from the metal-free prison from the first X-men film. Now Magneto and other &quot;naughty&quot; mutants must team up with the &quot;good&quot; mutants to protect themselves from a diabolical plot to kill all mutants around the globe.The joining together involves no group hugs or mutual understandings between the hero mutants and the mutants with a score to settle. Only a modicum of respect for each others talents.The central character is still Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). A mutant with a really bad bed hair and big mutton chops. Wolverine has acute hearing, incredible healing abilities, and he has keen fighting skills. In addition, he has had an undestructable metal alloy surgically placed into his hands, which projects giant steal claw-like daggers between his fingers when he senses danger.The special effects in this film are AWESOME. There wasn't one scene in which you could tell that something was either computer generated or not in the same plane of view as the other live action characters. The action is super fast, creative, well choreographed, and just really fun to watch. The ending sets the viewer up for a probable 3rd installment of the X-men series in the not-so-distant future.Is this a deep, life changing film? No way! But if you want to escape into another world for a couple of hours, this is the place to go. As always, the good guys prevail in the end, and a lot of bad people get their butts severely kicked.

The storyline is basically a man named Stryker many years ago discovered his son was a mutant, he sent him to the Professor to get help.  His son was sent back to him basically being told there was nothing they could do to help him and that being a mutant was not a disease.  The son being angry had his parents toyed with them and showed them visions that weren't real...finally one day Stryker's Wife put a power drill to her temple to try and drill out the visions.  Stryker bent on revenge wanted to kill all mutants by using the power of Cerebro.  The whole movie is excellent...Wolverine finds more about who he is...Storm's role is larger and more significant...and who can argue with seeing more of Halle.;)  Mystique although not in a large amount of the movie has some big moments...Rogue, Pyro, Jean Grey also have pivotal roles as well as of course the Professor and Magneto.  The movie has no real letdowns...there is a new addition with the Nightcrawler who is part of many of the crucial scenes to the film.  If you don't have a problem with sitting down for 2 1/2 hours then you will love this movie.  Plenty of action with a great story behind it...you won't find that in too many movies out there now.

771422,AAQ75C4BJUQLO,B0000BWVCJ,Sixto Limiac,"[0, 0]","After futile attempts such as Spawn and Batman and Robin years back, I felt comic book movies shouldn't even bother.  They have appeared on the big screen with little or no success.  The idea of an X-Men appearance would have been ruinous.  However, such grave thinking is history.  After the blockbuster entry of Spider-Man and the first X-Men film, comic books voyaging onto the theaters are no longer a laughing matter.  X2 is a true achievement which implies that in the long run, comic book films are here to stay.Let me get this out of the way and say it, X2 is the best comic book adaptation.  Unlike several movies that fit in the Sci-Fi category, such as the Matrix, X2 can stand on its two feet without bombarding the audience with an excess of computer animation or action sequences that easily become  monotonous or tiring.  Right at the beginning, we are introduced to a mysterious character, Nightcrawler, and the action isn't dreadfully lengthy nor does it impede the plotline.  Its to the point and it enhances the story in everyway.  Some bullet time is thrown in but its done tactfully.  Since the first X-Men movie explained the essence of the characters, X2 makes for a smoother and gratifying movie.What makes the movie so great, despite the considerable cast, are the characters themselves.  The focal plotline gets the job done in the Hollywood aspect, but the characters brought to life from the pages of the comic books is an utter spectacle.  We don't think the mutants are totally fictitious as a parent might from glimpsing at a comic book cover.  The execution, human performance, and the action drive the story without slowing down.  From Rouge's inability to make the affectionate moves on Iceman,  to Wolverine's shady past, the movie has so much story clocked in so little time.  Although, knowing a little history behind the X-Men can really suspend you in anticipation with the hints of Jean Grey altering into the Phoenix.  Surely, this paves the way for a rewarding setup in the next installment.  Comic book enthusiasts should be proud, and those unfamiliar to the X-Men universe really get an abundance of something refreshingly new.I'm sick of the comic, novel, and videogame zealots wailing that the original medium had this and that, and the film itself failed to explain this or showcase that.  I once fit those nonsensical shoes, as I age I begin to understand.  What I have learned from the Lord of the Kings and other comic book adaptations, is that their original mediums can't possibly be covered in a two-hour movie.  To extract every detail form the pages of the Uncanny X-Men is unworkable, if not ludicrous.  Besides, who really desires to see a movie if they know how its going to end?  Do you really want to see how character X transforms into what he is, when you know all the details already?  Adaptations to films, in my view, are about seeing the characters in action and being defined by real, human performance.As a DVD, X2 is bundled with a ton of extras, but the movie itself warrants a recommended purchase alone.  One of the best movies of this year, X2 heightens the wait for other comic book tie-ins such as Spider-Man's sequel, the upcoming Batman, and the Fantastic Four.  There is a new genre in movies and this time it ain't no joke.",5,Best Adaptation From the Pages of Comic Books,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,3303,"['futile', 'attempts', 'such', 'Spawn', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'years', 'back', 'felt', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'have', 'appeared', 'big', 'screen', 'little', 'success', 'idea', 'X-Men', 'appearance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ruinous', 'However', 'such', 'grave', 'thinking', 'history', 'blockbuster', 'entry', 'Spider-Man', 'first', 'X-Men', 'film', 'comic', 'books', 'voyaging', 'theaters', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'laughing', 'matter', 'X2', 'true', 'achievement', 'long', 'run', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'are', 'here', 'stay.Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'say', 'X2', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'several', 'movies', 'fit', 'Sci-Fi', 'category', 'such', 'Matrix', 'X2', 'can', 'stand', 'two', 'feet', 'bombarding', 'audience', 'excess', 'computer', 'animation', 'action', 'sequences', 'easily', 'become', 'monotonous', 'tiring', 'Right', 'beginning', 'are', 'introduced', 'mysterious', 'character', 'Nightcrawler', 'action', ""n't"", 'dreadfully', 'lengthy', 'impede', 'plotline', 'point', 'story', 'everyway', 'bullet', 'time', 'thrown', 'done', 'tactfully', 'first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'explained', 'essence', 'characters', 'X2', 'smoother', 'gratifying', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'considerable', 'cast', 'are', 'characters', 'focal', 'plotline', 'job', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'aspect', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'pages', 'comic', 'books', 'utter', 'spectacle', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mutants', 'are', 'totally', 'fictitious', 'parent', 'might', 'glimpsing', 'comic', 'book', 'cover', 'execution', 'human', 'performance', 'action', 'drive', 'story', 'slowing', 'down', 'Rouge', 'inability', 'make', 'affectionate', 'moves', 'Iceman', 'Wolverine', 'shady', 'past', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'clocked', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'knowing', 'little', 'history', 'X-Men', 'can', 'really', 'suspend', 'anticipation', 'hints', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'altering', 'Phoenix', 'Surely', 'way', 'rewarding', 'setup', 'next', 'installment', 'Comic', 'book', 'enthusiasts', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'unfamiliar', 'X-Men', 'universe', 'really', 'get', 'abundance', 'something', 'refreshingly', 'new.I', ""'m"", 'sick', 'comic', 'novel', 'videogame', 'zealots', 'wailing', 'original', 'medium', 'had', 'film', 'failed', 'explain', 'showcase', 'once', 'fit', 'nonsensical', 'shoes', 'age', 'begin', 'understand', 'What', 'have', 'learned', 'Lord', 'Kings', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'original', 'mediums', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'covered', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'extract', 'detail', 'form', 'pages', 'Uncanny', 'X-Men', 'unworkable', 'not', 'ludicrous', 'Besides', 'who', 'really', 'see', 'movie', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'Do', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'character', 'X', 'transforms', 'what', 'when', 'know', 'details', 'already', 'Adaptations', 'films', 'view', 'are', 'seeing', 'characters', 'action', 'being', 'defined', 'real', 'human', 'performance.As', 'DVD', 'X2', 'bundled', 'ton', 'extras', 'movie', 'warrants', 'recommended', 'purchase', 'alone', 'One', 'best', 'movies', 'year', 'X2', 'wait', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'tie-ins', 'such', 'Spider-Man', 'sequel', 'upcoming', 'Batman', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'new', 'genre', 'movies', 'time', 'ai', ""n't"", 'joke']",N/A

The secret of both the first two movies is giving Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart plenty of screen time.

Add in the ever reliable Brian Cox and you actually have a classy cast.My favourite scene is Magneto's escape from his plastic prison, which is perhaps the highpoint of the film. This scene looks as if its came straight from the comic book form and it works perfectly on film as well.

771427,A2LICSQ2IFE3C5,B0000BWVCJ,"SPM ""scott_maykrantz""","[0, 0]","The first X-Men movie had excellent casting but not much of a plot. This sequel is more of the same. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen were born for their roles in this film. If you read the Byrne/Claremont comic book from the early 1980s, you had to be pleased with the performances of these three actors. The other roles are not as impressive. Halle Berry is too young for Storm and the actor who plays Cyclops has too little charisma. Cyclops was supposed to be the understated leader of the team, the stand-in for Professor X when the heroes were away from the school, but in this movie he just pouts and says &quot;I love you&quot; to Jean Grey a few times.The plot has some major problems. The heroes spend too much time running for cover and trying to figure out what's going on. When they finally got to fight, I was bored. The whole movie seems to take place in about four locations, giving it a claustrophobic feel. Wolverine's claws look good and the movie version of Nightcrawler is okay, but the majority of the superpower special effects have an off-the-shelf feel to them. Cyclops' laser-beam eyes are just a very bright red light, really. Nightcrawler's blue cloud that follows his teleportation looks thin and fake, as well. Very little creativity went into these effects.The best thing about this movie is the decision to keep two essential parts of the Byrne/Claremont comic book --- the internal drama between the characters (the comic had a soap opera feel to it) and the prejudice angle (mutants are a persecuted and feared minority). These two ideas are alive and well in this film, which makes it more than your typical effects-heavy superhero flick.",3,Better than the first X-men movie,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,1688,"['first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'had', 'excellent', 'casting', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'sequel', 'more', 'same', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'were', 'born', 'roles', 'film', 'read', 'Byrne/Claremont', 'comic', 'book', 'early', '1980s', 'had', 'be', 'pleased', 'performances', 'three', 'actors', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'not', 'impressive', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'too', 'young', 'Storm', 'actor', 'who', 'Cyclops', 'too', 'little', 'charisma', 'Cyclops', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'understated', 'leader', 'team', 'stand-in', 'Professor', 'X', 'when', 'heroes', 'were', 'away', 'school', 'movie', 'just', 'pouts', 'quot', 'love', 'quot', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'few', 'times.The', 'plot', 'major', 'problems', 'heroes', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'running', 'cover', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'When', 'finally', 'got', 'fight', 'was', 'bored', 'whole', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'four', 'locations', 'giving', 'claustrophobic', 'feel', 'Wolverine', 'claws', 'look', 'good', 'movie', 'version', 'Nightcrawler', 'okay', 'majority', 'superpower', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'off-the-shelf', 'feel', 'Cyclops', 'laser-beam', 'eyes', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'bright', 'red', 'light', 'really', 'Nightcrawler', 'blue', 'cloud', 'teleportation', 'thin', 'fake', 'as', 'well', 'Very', 'little', 'creativity', 'went', 'effects.The', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'decision', 'keep', 'two', 'essential', 'parts', 'Byrne/Claremont', 'comic', 'book', 'internal', 'drama', 'characters', 'comic', 'had', 'soap', 'opera', 'feel', 'prejudice', 'angle', 'mutants', 'are', 'persecuted', 'feared', 'minority', 'two', 'ideas', 'are', 'alive', 'well', 'film', 'more', 'typical', 'effects-heavy', 'superhero', 'flick']",N/A

771429,ABVULUZ2ILKKO,B0000BWVCJ,Stephen Ressel,"[2, 6]","Having followed the X-Men thru the 70's and 80's, I had to see this movie sometime.  I got it on DVD recently, and despite being baffled by the multitude of scenes filled with hollow writing, and basic film and character flaws, it is SO enjoyable to watch a dozen times or more because of the strength of the film, action and characters.  This might be one of the few non-turkey films that is technically flawed in story and storytelling, but just DARN enjoyable to see again and again.  The designs, acting, colors and movement are so enticing.  On the negative tho, let me present a few notes...First, the entire plot for the film is faulty.  It isn't devastatingly faulty because it plays in forward motion, but falls apart as you back up.  Basically, Stryker made this alternate Cerebro to kill all mutants...why did he have to get Nightcrawler to attack the president?  Why did he need to invade the Mansion??  He could have just said 'Its complete, lets get Xavier and call it a day.'  HOW did Stryker get a hold of Kurt Wagner?!  Its just a mess of implausible, less then pragmatic reasoning.  They wrote the White House scenes only to make symmetrical 'book ends' for the writing - president's office scenes of error and correction.Over all, a lot of scenes had nothing more behind them then what they were.  In terms of writing, this is death, and it made the movie tedious to me.  What this means is that there was no crafty subtext, subreason, sub anything to most scenes.  A lot of scequences were exactly what they were, sometimes merely injected as ways to explain how the world works, but not how the story works.  Examples - Bobby Drake's house, the President's house, the fight in the Adamantium room, the plane fight.Much footwork!  So many scenes/sequences were so poorly thought out.  Nightcrawler grabs Rogue from outside of a moving plane and bamfs back in...yet has trouble bamfing through a 1 foot door at the end.  They layered up that drama all wrong, tho the Nightcrawler/Storm faith vs. eyes stuff was nice.  The writers should have made the Kurt/Ororo sequence some gradiose, tricky maneuver of multiple bamfs.  Why did they go to Bobby Drakes house??  Whats this about?  Why'd the kid call the cops??  Horrid motivation all over this sequence.  I hated all the footwork in the end.  Kurt can teleport, so why wasn't he zapping people all over?  Why was Rogue flying the jet??  Why is Styrker one moment under the jet doubled up in pain, then suddenly he's taking a nice little coffee break as Magneto approaches??  Why did Logan have to carry the kid?  Why did they have to walk over to Stryker chained up?  Why didn't they have Jean stop the water from getting them as they ran TO the plane instead of her stepping OUT of the plane???  Then, her skitish powers give out as the plane rises...she dies....simple.  Instead, they write an 'apology' sequence, after, where Xavier mysteriously explains she 'made a choice'.  She's a dummy, basically.  Why they had Iceman in this show at all was a huge mystery, and why didn't he turn to ice when activating powers?  Instead of Jean leaving the plane and dying in the water, Iceman should have frozen the water so they could fly out.  Simple.  Why didn't the film creatives think of this?  Even a cheap Rogue, 'oops I knocked him out with a victory kiss,' would have been fine and then set up inner conflict in Rogue, who let Jean die, for the next film.  I assume Bobby Drake was only here to provide the obligatory, Hollywood LOVE STORY deemed necessary to any high budget movie.  This film was really about walking, not about the trials and tribulations of super powered weirdos.Lastly, the main characters went OUT of character so often.  Basically, Wolverine and Scott Summers.  These two are the primary engine of conflict within the X-men, and should be very carefully portrayed.  Wolverine should be a gruff jerk, a real spikey character who is mostly self centered and motivated as much for his own reasons as for his team.  While not a bad guy, he is a dangerous person, and not someone anyone would call pleasant.  Scott Summers is the nice white boy who sees himself as, and is granted, the lead of the team.  He gives commands, he organizes, he uses logic and strategy, and sums up situations.  Scott isn't very pleasant either, because he puts up walls between himself and everyone else, aside from the Professor and Jean; both whom he loves dearly for different reasons.  His whole motive and personality was never well established.  The kind of pedastal he puts the prof. on isn't shown properly, nor the pressures of his walls making him NEED Jean as a buffer for his emotional burdens from holding together a group of oddball elements in dedication to his idol/father figure, professor X.  Wolverine changes personality within every scene as he goes from 'nice guy around the house' to 'gruff baddie' for no real reason.  Wolverine should never say 'Thanks', 'Hows it going?' or 'Hey kiddo'....too nice.  He is an aggressive character that is always in the way, brutish and demanding, as well as rudely unappreciative in most situations.There.  I liked a lot of the effects work!  It is a very rewatchable film for me.  I saw it 12 times so far (most times playing in the background).  While the basic ideas are fun, it is fairly hollow.  The charm comes from the use of the powers and character interactions at the best of times.  Some writing is really nicely thought out, but overall it feels like a script and idea put through a paper shredder and then taped together to make work.",4,An oddly rewatchable film...,1077408000,"02

Bryan Singer does an excellent job keeping the action moving and the characters developing.The three sequences that resonated most with me were:1.  Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike.  Up until this point in the movie, Wolverine has probably killed or disabled dozens of adversaries without showing any emotion other than anger.  Then we get to see the shock and horror on his face when he realizes he's killed the only other person with a mutation similar to his own.  This moment shows us that there is a real human being lurking under all of that rage.2.  Iceman running from his parents' house after Pyro's rampage.  He turns and looks back at his (formerly) loving family for probably the last time.  In that moment, he knows nothing in his life would be the same.3.  Pyro joining Magneto and Mystique.  All through the movie, we see Pyro chafing at the restrictions placed on mutants  under Professor Xavier's direction.  This choice, like many decision teenagers are faced with, will shape the rest of his life.The movie have similar developments for all the returning X-men.

It also has a beautifully controlled subtext about ""otherness"" which drives some exquisitely accurate skewers right through the heartless chest of the current US administration.  Singer and his crew have managed something that few comic book adaptations even strive for, let alone achieve: they've taken the source material and made it resonate for a new audience in a new age.  They show us how good an effects-intensive film can and should be.  Beyond the sheer delight of digital imagery and fight sequences, Singer has clearly expended just as much effort on ensuring that the story is engaging and works as a film narrative and not just as two hours of eye candy.  He doesn't make the mistake of staking his film's whole appeal on a few elaborate, digitized set pieces which are entirely revealed by the trailer. ""X2"" confirms his place among the truly interesting directors working today (go back and look at the unfairly neglected ""Apt Pupil"" - his work there is superb, as is McKellen's).

I have seen plenty of sequels in my life, but X2 goes beyond great.One of the best things about this movie was the use of multiple XMen and thier powers.1. Storm summoning multiple tornados in an air fight sequence.2. Rogue using her powers to help calm a fire set by Pyro.3. Pyro using his powers to drive away the police.4. One of my favorite scenes is with Siryn. The ""troops"" break into the mansion and barge into her room. She sits up and activates her sonic scream (those who read the comics know what her power entails). Coming to her rescue is Colossus. He walks into her room and his body transformers into all metal-COOL.5. Professor X freezing the entire mall.6. The ""near the closing"" scene of Jean Grey and the water.Of course there is a great story behind all of this. An attack on the president (by the newest mutant Nightcrawler) causes a ""rogue"" military man to seek vengence on the mutants, specifically Professor X.There is also the intertwining of Wolverine's past which became a little clearer.There were some excellent fight scenes and tremendously eye popping special effects.Another great thing is the character development. We are introduced into the past of Nightcrawler, Wolverine and Iceman (Bobby Drake). We touched on a little more of Storm's hatred of humans. There is the spark of romance and betrayal.We also meet another human experiment with the adamentium; but this time just her ""nails"".Mystique is a pivotal player in the movie this time and I was glad. She has become one of my favorites.Also cleverily placed throughout the movie are subliminal ""X's"". I found a few.I also liked the idea of expanding the use of thier powers. XMen like Jean Grey, Storm and Wolverine.There was also some subtle hints of things to come. During a t.v. interview we meet Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast). While breaking into some computer files, Mystique came across a few names including Remy L. (Gambit). A big scene with Kitty Pride or Shadowcat. Another mention of Jubilee and the boy who can change the t.v. without using a remote.I will be seeing this movie again, again and again.

771438,A2HW4GC6H0L2LR,B0000BWVCJ,"T. George ""anne-with-an-e""","[13, 15]","First off, for those of you who don't know, the background of the films is this: there are two major races on earth - humans and mutants.  Humans are us, basically.  Mutants are folks who are born with a x-factor in their genes which gives them superhuman powers - reading minds, turning things to ice, healing, creating storms, etc.  Due to the mutants' exceptional powers, humans tend to be afraid of them.  Not all mutants are bad, but those that are are nearly unstoppable, and that is incredibly frightening for American and others who are used to safety and security.While the first movie deals with &quot;the good mutants&quot; (led by Xavier) versus &quot;the bad mutants&quot; (led by Magneto), the second movie puts a real twist on this.  Here, one human (Stryker) acts as a mastermind to rid the world of mutants.  Thus, the great mutant minds now need to work together to stop his efforts.The reasons why I enjoyed this film are pretty similar to why I enjoyed the first film.1.  The man Xavier(played masterfully by Patrick Stewart)embodies every ideal we hope for in fellow man.  Though wrongly persecuted, he uses his incredible powers &amp; understanding for good rather than revenge.2.  The relationship betweem Xavier and Magneto (played equally masterfully by Ian McKellen).  This complex friendship and opposition of equals is fascinating...and rare in epic films.  Magneto is everything that Xavier is except that he is shrewder than Xavier and believes the solution to their troubles lay in wiping out humans.3.  The fact that the whole set-up is laced with social commentary.  Most of these themes are overt and are predictable - anti-war, tolerance, the impact of evolution.  Generally, I despise preachy messages.  However, here you can understand why the humans are afraid of the mutants, but you also see the vulnerability of the mutants.4.  I thought Nightcrawler's character development added some spiritual depth to the film.  He quotes from the Bible and speaks of angels and sin...all the while looking like a little devil with his black tail.  This adds the involvement of the heavenlies into a situation that is beyond our control.5.  The action, the cast of characters, the cinematography were all great.  There are some flaws with the logic of the plot, but it wasn't too critical to me.As for performance analysis of the stars, how much they stuck to the comic books, and plot flaws, I will leave that to more able reviewers than myself.  But, as a regular ol' movie watcher, I very much enjoyed the journey to this world the 2nd time round.  And I do hope they make another movie...but only if they can keep up this quality.",4,"In addition to action, there's actually some depth...",1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,2662,"['First', 'off', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'background', 'films', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'races', 'earth', 'humans', 'mutants', 'Humans', 'are', 'basically', 'Mutants', 'are', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'born', 'x-factor', 'genes', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'reading', 'minds', 'turning', 'things', 'ice', 'healing', 'creating', 'storms', 'etc', 'Due', 'mutants', 'exceptional', 'powers', 'humans', 'tend', 'be', 'afraid', 'Not', 'mutants', 'are', 'bad', 'are', 'are', 'nearly', 'unstoppable', 'incredibly', 'frightening', 'American', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'safety', 'security.While', 'first', 'movie', 'deals', 'quot', 'good', 'mutants', 'quot', 'led', 'Xavier', 'versus', 'quot', 'bad', 'mutants', 'quot', 'led', 'Magneto', 'second', 'movie', 'real', 'twist', 'Here', 'one', 'human', 'Stryker', 'mastermind', 'rid', 'world', 'mutants', 'Thus', 'great', 'mutant', 'minds', 'now', 'need', 'work', 'together', 'stop', 'efforts.The', 'reasons', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'similar', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film.1', 'man', 'Xavier', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'ideal', 'hope', 'fellow', 'man', 'wrongly', 'persecuted', 'incredible', 'powers', 'amp', 'understanding', 'good', 'rather', 'revenge.2', 'relationship', 'betweem', 'Xavier', 'Magneto', 'played', 'equally', 'masterfully', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'complex', 'friendship', 'opposition', 'equals', 'fascinating', 'rare', 'epic', 'films', 'Magneto', 'everything', 'Xavier', 'shrewder', 'Xavier', 'solution', 'troubles', 'lay', 'wiping', 'out', 'humans.3', 'fact', 'whole', 'set-up', 'laced', 'social', 'commentary', 'Most', 'themes', 'are', 'overt', 'are', 'predictable', 'anti-war', 'tolerance', 'impact', 'evolution', 'Generally', 'despise', 'preachy', 'messages', 'However', 'here', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'humans', 'are', 'afraid', 'mutants', 'also', 'see', 'vulnerability', 'mutants.4', 'thought', 'Nightcrawler', 'character', 'development', 'added', 'spiritual', 'depth', 'film', 'Bible', 'speaks', 'angels', 'sin', 'looking', 'little', 'devil', 'black', 'tail', 'involvement', 'heavenlies', 'situation', 'control.5', 'action', 'cast', 'characters', 'cinematography', 'were', 'great', 'are', 'flaws', 'logic', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'critical', 'me.As', 'performance', 'analysis', 'stars', 'how', 'much', 'stuck', 'comic', 'books', 'plot', 'flaws', 'will', 'leave', 'more', 'able', 'reviewers', 'regular', 'ol', 'movie', 'watcher', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'journey', 'world', '2nd', 'time', 'round', 'do', 'hope', 'make', 'movie', 'only', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'quality']",N/A

It seems to be the current Hollywood formula again, throw in enough action scenes and you don't need to bother with the remainder.Here is my criticism and why this movie is a failure. What it is about? Superheroes emphasis on HERO. Show me the heroes. There is close to zero character development. Storm and Nightcrawler, OK. The rest lose it. Consider:Professor X, the greatest mind on Earth and advocate of peace, creates a weapon of mass destruction and then his brain gets undermined by a complete dweeb.Cyclops, the leader of the action team, is all but written out of the film and contributes nothing.Jean Grey dies.Wolverine in his biggest battle kills a girl. Wow.Iceman and Rogue show no character development, in fact Rogue is really a step backwards.Mystique is hot but her costume is so absent they are afraid to let you have a good look at her.Magneto is not bad but could be better. The gap between his refined manner and his genocidal character is too great. Plus even Genghis Khan understood you don't kill everybody.When you get down to it the plot is insultingly predictable.

I watched this one with a couple of friends, and they were completely clueless... even with me giving a never-ending commentary on who everyone was, what their powers were, etc.This takes place in an alternate world, where everything's basically the same except that there has been an evolutionary phenomenon: a new species of humans has arisen with special powers. For example: controlling the weather or being able to manipulate fire.Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for these 'mutants', where they're able to excercise their powers and be with their own kind. Professor X even has a machine called 'Cerebro' that has the exact location of every mutant and every human in the entire world. He is the only one that knows how to use it.But things have been happening; the president has recently had an assassination attempt by a person identified as a mutant. The government starts cracking down on all the mutants, and one of the first things that they do is break in Xavier's school. Some students escape, but several are captured... in addition to Professor X himself.Turns out that an evil scientist who works in the government staged the mutant attack because he wanted to break into Xavier's school and steal the plans for Cerebro. Then he gets his own mutant son to convince Xavier to kill all the mutants using the machine.Yada yada, the other mutants of the school arrive at the scene of the crime with their used-to-be-enemies, Magneto and Mystique. But don't think that the beloved bad guys are turning good- the entire thing was a scheme to change Cerebro's mission from eliminating all the mutants to eliminating all the HUMANS.But, of course, the X-Men save the day, but not without casualities. Jean Gray dies saving the crew from a huge flood, and Pyro joins up with Magneto and Mystique.As always, Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) were FABULOUS. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, Halle Berry (Storm) lost the crazy accent.One thing that I hated was that you didn't see much of Rogue any more... in the last movie, she was one of the lead characters.Other than that, great movie, all-star cast.

Again, staying somewhat true to his Weapon X origins.Several new X-men are along for the ride, most notably the spectacular Nightcrawler who has a fantastic sequence where he teleports through the Whitehouse taking out guards in order to kill the president.We also see Bobby Drake as Iceman, Pyro, and a short cameo with the armor skinned Colossus as a student in the school.Also back is Ian McKellan as Magneto and Rebecca Romijn Stamos as Mystique,who joins forces with the X-men to fight Stryker and his troops.Much better story than the first movie and more exciting.

As with the original, it is the seriousness and the gravity with which Bryan Singer approaches his subject matter that continues to keep the X-Men movie franchise from sinking to the depths of such awful comic book movie sequels as BATMAN III & IV and SUPERMAN III & IV.  At their best, comic books are dealing with real life issues and problems under the guise of fantasy.  That is what has made the first two X-Men movies so good, they are a perfect blend of fantasy injected into a ""real world"" setting.This movie has a more somber tone than its predecessor, and one finds it harder to pity the humans in this movie, as we see their ingnorance and intolerance (as well as own reflected back at us) on full display.  As far as action, the sequel far outdoes the original, and watching each mutant display his/her powers more breathtaking.  My only concern is that the movie does not really stand on its own, and screams out for a third installment to complete the story.

What I'm really trying to say is that I miss the Beast, Jubilee and Gambit (especially him!)... I see there was reason to leave out Gambit for he doesnt really have much of a power with exploding cards and all but still, there might have been room. Hopefully they will be encorporated into other sequels (which I'm guessing they'll be more of). Still, it was a good movie and I highly recommend it...

Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[1, 2]","I waited for three years for &quot;X2&quot; to be released, and I walked into the theater saying to myself, &quot;Please God, don't let this movie suck like Batman and Robin&quot;.  I walked out of it a happy person, as Bryan Singer continues the X-Men saga in high fashion.&quot;X2&quot; is an improvement over its predecessor in almost every single way.  It is longer and the charatcers are given more screen time.  The action is better (the military attack on the X-school is probably the film's action highlight).  The script is tighter and more focused, and the film is overall much more ambitious.Singer took some obvious risks with &quot;X2&quot;.  Its themes are very dark for a mainstream comic book movie- genocide, parental rejection, repressed trauma.  Magneto continues to be a great villain- not evil, but horribly misguided.  Forcing him and the X-Men into an uneasy alliance was probably Singer's best move.  The theme of the X-Men's curse is made more obvious here- they are doomed to protect people who hate and fear them.  However, beneath all the darkness, this film is still fun- there's a couple moments of comic relief, and Wolverine still exudes a playful charm.  Singer manages to strike the right balance here between welcome in-jokes and downright campiness, such as what the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise fell into.To make things even better, &quot;X2&quot; is fully loaded with special features, including commentary and several making-of documentaries.  I would highly recommend this film not only for X-Men fans, but fans of good action films in general.  It's much better than most of the other stuff released this year, a welcome relief from the disappointments of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; sequels, and &quot;Terminator 3&quot;.

However on rare occasions it does happen (Terminator 2 and Aliens).  X2 is one of those extremely rare times in movie history.The story behind X2 starts off with Wolverine returning to the mansion shortly after an assination attempt is made towards the president.  The would be assassin is new mutant Nightcrawler.  From that point WIlliam Stryker (Brian Cox) convinces the President to allow him to send a strike team to the X-men Mansion.  As it turns out Wolverine is babysitting that night.  After a kick ... battle sequence (where we see such mutants as Siren, Kitty, and Collosus, and Iceman go into action) every one in the school eventually escapes.  What is not realized is that stryker has captured Cyclops and Proffesor X (Patrick Stewart) and is going to use him (PRofessor X)to destroy all mutants on the planet.  The X-Men must then team up with Mystique and MAgnetto to stop him.  Stryker however has back up as he has Cyclops under a deep mind control sedative and has a deadly assasin, Lady Deathstrike, by his side.  In the end there is a lot of action and deep emotion as the story has the underline telling of civil rights and equality while packing magnificent special effects and incredible action.Everyone who was in the first (outside of Sabertooth and Toad) has returned for the sequel.  The stor is very well done and the action is non stop.  In the end it left implications for a third movie with hints of the Phoenix saga as well as the Sentinals.  This has by far surpassed the first and I am sure many fans will agree.  My only complaint is that the character of Cyclops is still under utilized.  He is still a supproting character and not the leader as he is in the comics.  However he is more 3 dimensional this time with some emotion to him.

The great part of X2 is that the characters are already introduced, so you don't have to waste time telling who everybody is, you can just get straight to the action.  As far as the DVD goes, the picture is stunning and the DTS audio will literally shake your house.  It also has a plentiful selection of extras.  I highly reccomend this DVD to a fan of superhero movies or action movies.",5,"Everything the first movie was, and MORE!",1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,742,"['first', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'was', 'incredible', 'was', 'superhero', 'blockbuster', 'had', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'also', 'had', 'incredible', 'plot', 'many', 'was', 'skeptical', 'sequel', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'sequels', 'great', 'movies', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'terrible', 'So', 'imagine', 'susprise', 'when', 'went', 'saw', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'first', 'movie', 'great', 'part', 'X2', 'characters', 'are', 'already', 'introduced', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'waste', 'time', 'telling', 'who', 'everybody', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'straight', 'action', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'picture', 'stunning', 'DTS', 'audio', 'will', 'literally', 'shake', 'house', 'also', 'plentiful', 'selection', 'extras', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'DVD', 'fan', 'superhero', 'movies', 'action', 'movies']",N/A
771467,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000BWVCJ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 4]","Mutants can't live with them, can't live without them seems to be the preveiling theme of the marvelous X2. Building on the momentum of the first film Director Bryan Singer continues to graft contemporary issues (although, to be fair, the original comic did so as well but not in such a compact fashion)to the X-men story. The major theme of the second feature, like the first, is prejudice and tolerance. Singer handles the themes and the film's story well. Although many of the original elements from the graphic novel involving Stryker have been changed, those changes work dramatically for the film.When we last saw the X-Men, Wolverine had left Xavier's School For Gifted Children and the X-Men compound to discover his origin. He ends up at an abandoned research facility so it appears, on the surface, that his search has reached a dead end. Rogue mutants have become bolder making an attempt on the life of the President. This assassination attempt allows William Stryker the opportunity and excuse he needs to convince the President to sign an order giving him troops to invade Xavier's school and take the X-Men (and the children at the school)captive.Encased in a plastic prison cell, Magneto is a caged bird. When Stryker arrives with a special serum to force Magneto to cooperate in revealing information about Xavier's school and the compound, Magneto sings giving up his old friend to a mutual enemy.Jean Grey's abilities have blossomed in a frightening way since her encounter with Magneto at Ellis Island. Her abilities indicate that she might be more powerful than ever before. She and Storm go in search of the Presidential assassin so they can get to the bottom of who is trying to create a war between humans and mutants. Meanwhile, Stryker attacks Xavier's compound and with Wolverine the only adult around, he goes into high gear fighting them off. All of this becomes central to the conflict between Stryker, Magneto and the X-Men.The performances are all exceptional in particular Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Famke Jannsen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Brian Cox give considerable power and presence to the various roles they play. Unlike some films, the actors here are clearly committed to the material and aren't going through the motions.The DVD looks exceptional although I did notice a bit of edge enhancement. Still, it's nothing serious and doesn't mar an otherwise exceptional presentation. The colors are rich and, unlike the film the Santa Clause (another recent release)the transition from one layer to another in the disc isn't disruptive.The extras are an improvement when compared to the first edition of X-Men on DVD (and comparable to 1.5). On disc one there are two running commentaries with Bryan Singer, Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and a second audio track with various comments from a variety of the actors and producers.Disc two focuses on a wide variety of extras. The Nighcrawler Attack sequence is a multi-angle interactive sequence that is actually quite cool although I doubt you'll go back to it again and again. The Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal provides the nuts and bolds of choregraphing a difficult and demanding fight sequence. The documentary The Second Unanny Issue of X-Men (cleverly titled I might add) is quite good and provides a good glimpse into the production process. It's not the best documentary I've seen included as an extra but provides considerable insight.The Featurettes include The Secret Origin of X-Men, Nightcrawler Reborn, The Adventure Before X2, Introducing The Incredible Nightcrawler and character studies. As before there are deleted scenes although I haven't had the time to investigate all of these fully so can't completely comment.Parents should be warned that there is a bit of bad language and also some suggestive sexual situations in the film.",5,More than human,1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,3858,"['Mutants', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'be', 'preveiling', 'theme', 'marvelous', 'X2', 'Building', 'momentum', 'first', 'film', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'graft', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'be', 'fair', 'original', 'comic', 'did', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'such', 'compact', 'fashion', 'X-men', 'story', 'major', 'theme', 'second', 'feature', 'first', 'prejudice', 'tolerance', 'Singer', 'themes', 'film', 'story', 'well', 'many', 'original', 'elements', 'graphic', 'novel', 'involving', 'Stryker', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'changes', 'work', 'dramatically', 'film.When', 'last', 'saw', 'X-Men', 'Wolverine', 'had', 'left', 'Xavier', 'School', 'Gifted', 'Children', 'X-Men', 'compound', 'discover', 'origin', 'up', 'abandoned', 'research', 'facility', 'surface', 'search', 'reached', 'dead', 'end', 'Rogue', 'mutants', 'have', 'become', 'bolder', 'making', 'attempt', 'life', 'President', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'William', 'Stryker', 'opportunity', 'excuse', 'convince', 'President', 'sign', 'order', 'giving', 'troops', 'invade', 'Xavier', 'school', 'take', 'X-Men', 'children', 'school', 'captive.Encased', 'plastic', 'prison', 'cell', 'Magneto', 'caged', 'bird', 'When', 'Stryker', 'special', 'serum', 'force', 'Magneto', 'cooperate', 'revealing', 'information', 'Xavier', 'school', 'compound', 'Magneto', 'sings', 'giving', 'up', 'old', 'friend', 'mutual', 'enemy.Jean', 'Grey', 'abilities', 'have', 'blossomed', 'frightening', 'way', 'encounter', 'Magneto', 'Ellis', 'Island', 'abilities', 'indicate', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'powerful', 'ever', 'Storm', 'go', 'search', 'Presidential', 'assassin', 'can', 'get', 'bottom', 'who', 'trying', 'create', 'war', 'humans', 'mutants', 'Meanwhile', 'Stryker', 'Xavier', 'compound', 'Wolverine', 'only', 'adult', 'around', 'high', 'gear', 'fighting', 'off', 'central', 'conflict', 'Stryker', 'Magneto', 'X-Men.The', 'performances', 'are', 'exceptional', 'particular', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'Famke', 'Jannsen', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'give', 'considerable', 'power', 'presence', 'various', 'roles', 'play', 'films', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'clearly', 'committed', 'material', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'motions.The', 'DVD', 'exceptional', 'did', 'notice', 'bit', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'Still', 'nothing', 'serious', ""n't"", 'mar', 'otherwise', 'exceptional', 'presentation', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'film', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'recent', 'release', 'transition', 'one', 'layer', 'disc', ""n't"", 'disruptive.The', 'extras', 'are', 'improvement', 'when', 'compared', 'first', 'edition', 'X-Men', 'DVD', 'comparable', '1.5', 'disc', 'one', 'are', 'two', 'running', 'commentaries', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Cinematographer', 'Newton', 'Thomas', 'Sigel', 'second', 'audio', 'track', 'various', 'comments', 'variety', 'actors', 'producers.Disc', 'two', 'focuses', 'wide', 'variety', 'extras', 'Nighcrawler', 'Attack', 'sequence', 'multi-angle', 'interactive', 'sequence', 'actually', 'quite', 'cool', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'Wolverine/Deathstrike', 'Fight', 'Rehearsal', 'nuts', 'bolds', 'choregraphing', 'difficult', 'demanding', 'fight', 'sequence', 'documentary', 'Second', 'Unanny', 'Issue', 'X-Men', 'cleverly', 'titled', 'might', 'add', 'quite', 'good', 'good', 'glimpse', 'production', 'process', 'not', 'best', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'included', 'extra', 'considerable', 'insight.The', 'Featurettes', 'include', 'Secret', 'Origin', 'X-Men', 'Nightcrawler', 'Reborn', 'Adventure', 'Before', 'X2', 'Introducing', 'Incredible', 'Nightcrawler', 'character', 'studies', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'time', 'investigate', 'fully', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'completely', 'comment.Parents', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'bit', 'bad', 'language', 'also', 'suggestive', 'sexual', 'situations', 'film']",N/A

It formed the coming of Wolverine and other Mutants. Because of the good beginning the second left a lot of room for a great story.What happens when the president who is supporting the equality of mutants-is attacked by a mutant? His views on the mutants become affected. The X Men must find Stryker the man who forced Nightcrawler to attack the president and the man responsible for the attack on the School for the Gifted.Through out their findings Magneto breaks out of prison, who then teams with the X Men to try and defeat Stryker who is trying to wipe out all of the mutants.I thought this film was great. They introduced so many more mutants. It's amazing what they can do with special affects. This film is filled with a lot of action and a great story, it won't bore you for a second.

771472,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0000BWVCJ,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men (Widescreen Edition)"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)"" (2006).""X2"" is generally considered the best of the three and goes deeper into the conflict of Xavier's school, Magneto's Brotherhood and the US Government's increasing involvement, as laid out in ""X-Men."" More mutants are introduced. On Xavier's side: Nightcrawler, Colossus and Shadowcat. On the villain side: Lady Deathstrike and Government agent William Stryker.""X2"" has the most depth and features numerous interesting character-defining moments along with great action scenes, like the one between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike near the end. There's also a particularly notable clash when Wolverine and other X-Men are forced to confront Federal agents as they storm Xavier's school. Interestingly, the US Government becomes the proverbial ""bad guys"" and Wolverine refuses to ""pull punches.""Unfortunately, the film overstays its welcome and goes on and on well after Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike, but I'm not complaining.

Wolverine is back at the epicenter of what has become nearly all-out war between mutants and normals, a struggle that sorely tests the resolve of the titular heroes to remain conciliatory towards humanity.  Much of the tension in the film comes in odd and almost touching places.. while there are many of the requisite fights and displays of super powers (all of which are handled expertly), the real traction comes from the interplay between the characters.  From one brother calling the cops on his mutant sibling to the devout prayers of a mutant with more than a passing resemblance to a devil, to the interaction of a father with his mutant son, the real interplay of mutants with humanity is addressed with determination.The plot itself is on par with the earlier film and is just plausible enough to hold interest, although it does slip a bit too easily into the 'entire world at stake' mode that eventually doomed other series such as Superman.
