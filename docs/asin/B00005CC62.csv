581720,A2MH6SBX8IFTY7,B00005CC62,J. Matlock,"[4, 4]","Chino (Charles Bronson) has a small ranch outside of town where he breeds horses.  Jamie (Vincent Van Patten) is a young boy who comes to the ranch looking for work and developes a friendship with Chino.  Catherine (Jill Ireland) plays Chino's love interest.  This doesn't work out due to her half-brother Maral (Marcell Bozzuffi) who is the big rancher in these parts does not care for Chino.  In the end, Maral more or less runs Chino out of town.The movie itself, while it does have some good scenery, misses and is very slow and is rather boring.  Other than the relationship between Chino and Jamie, the plot is pretty flat.  Seemed like the characters were just putting their time in to earn a paycheck.As for the DVD itself, only the movie and scene selection are on the DVD.  The sound is mono and the transfer could have been much better (even though the back of the DVD indicated ""Digitally Remastered for Superior Picture & Sound Quality"".Front Row Entertainment should have done a much better job releasing this DVDHope this review helps you.",3,Great Potential but a Let Down,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,1054,"['Chino', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'small', 'ranch', 'town', 'where', 'horses', 'Jamie', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Patten', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'ranch', 'looking', 'work', 'friendship', 'Chino', 'Catherine', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'Chino', 'love', 'interest', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'due', 'half-brother', 'Maral', 'Marcell', 'Bozzuffi', 'who', 'big', 'rancher', 'parts', 'not', 'care', 'Chino', 'end', 'Maral', 'more', 'less', 'runs', 'Chino', 'town.The', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'scenery', 'misses', 'very', 'slow', 'rather', 'boring', 'Other', 'relationship', 'Chino', 'Jamie', 'plot', 'pretty', 'flat', 'Seemed', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'putting', 'time', 'earn', 'paycheck.As', 'DVD', 'only', 'movie', 'scene', 'selection', 'are', 'DVD', 'sound', 'mono', 'transfer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'even', 'back', 'DVD', 'indicated', 'Digitally', 'Remastered', 'Superior', 'Picture', 'Sound', 'Quality', '.Front', 'Row', 'Entertainment', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'releasing', 'DVDHope', 'review']",Chino
