But when Kevin Kline's character was released on bond, that's pretty much when it fell through the roof. I've never heard of somebody making bail when they are facing life in prison or the death sentence. And then being able to go anywhere you want? Even on bail, you can't leave the city. But yet he was able to sneak around, travel to Savannah, spy on his rival, all without any hindrance from the police. I pretty much figured out why the neighbor replaced his wife with a ""stand-in"". He needed somebody to drive the cigarette boat to prove he was out on the lake; but what I don't understand is why he allowed her to leave unharmed when all was said and done. Not only that, you would think both the police and the insurance company would have done a better job at the investigation, especially when 1.5 mil was on the line. I'm not sure about anybody else, but regardless if the police think they have the right man or not, if money is on the line they usually investigate all ends before making their decision.",2,Consenting Adults,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,1061,"['Not', 'bad', 'first', 'half', 'up', 'murder', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'character', 'was', 'released', 'bond', 'pretty', 'much', 'when', 'fell', 'roof', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'somebody', 'making', 'bail', 'when', 'are', 'facing', 'life', 'prison', 'death', 'sentence', 'then', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'anywhere', 'want', 'Even', 'bail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'city', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'sneak', 'around', 'travel', 'Savannah', 'spy', 'rival', 'hindrance', 'police', 'pretty', 'much', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'neighbor', 'replaced', 'wife', 'stand-in', 'needed', 'somebody', 'drive', 'cigarette', 'boat', 'prove', 'was', 'out', 'lake', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'allowed', 'leave', 'unharmed', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'Not', 'only', 'would', 'think', 'police', 'insurance', 'company', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'investigation', 'especially', 'when', '1.5', 'mil', 'was', 'line', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anybody', 'else', 'regardless', 'police', 'think', 'have', 'right', 'man', 'not', 'money', 'line', 'usually', 'investigate', 'ends', 'making', 'decision']",N/A

Morris ""BeansMommy""","[2, 5]","Do NOT believe the bad reviews this movie got.I saw this several years ago, and for the last 2 years it has driven me crazy trying to remember the NAME of it, so I can buy the DVD !The plot is really a good one. Kevin Spacey and his wife have a loving relationship, although a little boring after so many years together. They become friends with the new neighbors, and the new neighbor talks Spacey into a wife swap early one morning.The neighbor lady turns up dead, and Kevin Spacey is framed for her murder. I believe he makes bond, and soon discovers he was framed, and the man next door's wife is not actually his WIFE, but his partner in crime. Since his wife is ""dead"" he moves in with Spacey's wife, and takes over his bank etc...It gets very suspensful as Spacey sets out to prove his innocence...He also sees the woman he ""murdered"" in another town.What happens really shocked me. The movie is full of twists and turns,and that is what makes it so good. Sure, some of it is a little far fetched, but so are most movies, but not TOO unbelievable.Without giving too much away (believe me, there is so much to this movie, I didn't)it will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end.This movie is not only worth renting, if you are a collector you will want to add it to your collection !",4,Don't believe the bad reviews.,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,1302,"['Do', 'NOT', 'believe', 'bad', 'movie', 'got.I', 'saw', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'last', '2', 'years', 'driven', 'crazy', 'trying', 'remember', 'NAME', 'can', 'buy', 'DVD', 'plot', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'wife', 'have', 'loving', 'relationship', 'little', 'boring', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'together', 'become', 'friends', 'new', 'neighbors', 'new', 'neighbor', 'talks', 'Spacey', 'wife', 'swap', 'early', 'one', 'morning.The', 'neighbor', 'lady', 'up', 'dead', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'framed', 'murder', 'believe', 'bond', 'soon', 'discovers', 'was', 'framed', 'man', 'door', 'wife', 'not', 'actually', 'WIFE', 'partner', 'crime', 'wife', 'dead', 'Spacey', 'wife', 'bank', 'etc', 'very', 'suspensful', 'Spacey', 'out', 'prove', 'innocence', 'also', 'woman', 'murdered', 'town.What', 'really', 'shocked', 'movie', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'what', 'so', 'good', 'Sure', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'movies', 'not', 'TOO', 'unbelievable.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'believe', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'very', 'end.This', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'worth', 'renting', 'are', 'collector', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Because this guy should be arrested, tried and convicted for perpetrating a heinous crime: Wasting 99 precious minutes of anyone's time who sits through this vapid clunker.Matthew Chapman wrote this script.  Matthew Chapman is a very bad writer.Just as convicted PC virus authors are legally restrained from owning or operating a computer, so while on this Earth should the same fate Matthew Chapman suffer.  When he passes from this life, he should be made to watch this dreck of a movie, repeatedly, start to finish, as eternal punishment.I have watched thousands, probably tens of thousands of films in my lifetime.  I can never remember a film where my emotions were so affected during the progression of the movie.  I went from amusement to disbelief, disbelief to incredulity, incredulity to anger, then anger to enraged.  Why?Because Matthew Chapman, Hollywood hack that he is, wasted 99 minutes of my life with a script so preposterous, nonsensical and idiotic that I actually felt insulted after having seen it.This film was produced in 1992.  I imagine the studio must have been pouring through piles of old scripts, searching for something similar to capitalize on the high-profile ""Basic Instinct"", which came out the same year.You could compare Chapman's efforts to ""Basic"" writer Joe Eszterhaus, who had his own well-deserved trash-notoriety in the 90's, but that would actually be insulting Eszterhaus.  And THAT is an accomplishment in and of itself.There is a progression of events which transpire in the production of every film.  The chain starts with a writer and a script.  When Matthew Chapman finished the last page of this piece of refuse, did he feel like he had accomplished something?  Did he  congratulate himself, not realizing he had just completed one of the worst movie scripts of the 1990's?And then you have to wonder about the rest of the chain. If I were any of the principles  in this atrocity, I would have fired any representation that advised me to be involved with it.  What did an accomplished director like the late Alan Pakula, and seasoned actors such as Kevin Kline, Kevin Spacey and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, see in this abortion?You'd think Chapman wouldn't be able to get near the big screen again, but he authored two other scripts that were made into equally bad films: ""The Color Of Night"" (1994) and ""What's The Worst That Can Happen"" (2001).Three films in ten years; what does this guy do a for a day job?  It must be something connected with waste management, because Matthew Chapman certainly seems to be obsessed with the volume production of garbage.If you ever pay to see a film in a theater, and the name MATTHEW CHAPMAN shows up in the opening credits, run for the lobby with your ticket stub and demand your money back.",1,"PUTRID, VACUOUS & INANE...

This feeling becomes exacerbated when he sees his new neighbor (played by Kevin Spacey) leading this adventurous, carefree life and also by his immediate sexual attraction towards Spacey's wife.One day, Spacey tells Kline he knows Kline is attracted to his wife.  Before Kline can protest, Spacey says it's okay and offers Kline a deal -- Kline can have sex with Spacey's wife just as long as Spacey can also have sex with Kline's wife.But there's a catch.Instead of asking for the wives' consent in having sex with these men, these men are just going to take sex from them.  Here's the plan that Spacey proposes....when their wives are sound asleep, both men will sneak out of their houses, go into each neighbor's house, wake up the neighbor's wife, have sex with her, and then sneak back into bed with their own wives.  Since the lights will be kept off, each wife will assume she's having sex with her own husband.And Kline accepts the deal!!  And it's not like he didn't have any chances to back out of this deal either...in the scene where he sneaks into Spacey's house, there's a big staircase he has to climb before he's even able to get into the woman's bedroom.  All that time, climbing all those stairs, could've given him a chance to grow a conscience, but instead he continues the climb and performs the act.It's bad enough this man has sex with another woman without his wife's consent (or this woman's consent either)...but to also lend his wife's body to another man, like she was a prostitute (but a non-consentual one), makes this man one of the most despicable lead characters I've ever seen!  And since neither woman consented to this sexual arrangement, technically this is rape.The next morning, a guilt-ridden Kline tells his wife he loves her and I guess I'm supposed to believe him because he looks so sad when he says it...but I don't.  If I had a husband who ever pulled a stunt like that, not only would I never believe he ever loved me, not only would I immediately divorce him, but I'd also press rape charges against both of these men.And yet, in the end, when his wife finds out the real truth, she forgives him right away as if his betrayal was about as offensive as him forgetting her birthday.We the audience, too, are just supposed to forget this betrayal while Kline is out trying to solve a murder that incriminates him and just be happy the murder gets solved and he ends up back with his wife.  That didn't happen for me.  This character was just too dispicable to root for.

328427,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,6302705509,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","There may be spoilers.This suburban thriller takes a familiar theme of greed, sex and deception and blends them into a modest, but interesting story.  Directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film is set in suburban Atlanta.  Richard and Priscilla Parker (Kevin Kline and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) work in the music industry.  Richard writes and records jingles for commercials and his wife acts in the agent/PR/producer role.  They make a decent living but are in debt and have a daughter in a private high school for the musically gifted.A new couple moves in next door.  Eddy Otis (a blond Kevin Spacey) is an investment counsellor and his wife Kay (also blond Rebecca Miller) is a small time lounge singer with a quiet sultry voice.  The 2 couples become close friends.  Richard is fascinated by the gorgeous Kay and her voice, wondering why she hasn't been recorded.  Priscilla finds Eddy's devil-may-care ways exhilarating.  In short, when they spend time together it's often Eddy with Priscilla and Kay with Richard.  Yeah, you can easily see where this is all going.  That is one of the problems with the film.  The tells are easily spotted.When Eddy notices Richard's attention to Kay, he suggests a one-time only, wife-swap in the middle of the night when the ladies are sleeping.  You know, they wouldn't even know the difference.  Uh, sure.  Richard is offended and breaks off their friendship.  He goes into some trance-like moments, obviously secretly intrigued by the idea.  Priscilla begins to squabble with Richard not knowing why they all can't be friends and suggests that he be more fun-like as Eddy is.  He takes that as a green light and sets up the switch with Eddy.The next day, the police swarm all over the Otis home as Kay has been found murdered.  And guess who suspect number one is.  I shouldn't give too much away, but the movie switches gears as Richard, assisted by a private detective (Forest Whitaker) set out to track down the real killer.  Again, all of this is fairly predictable.  Yet there are still some surprises to come, and that's what makes the film interesting.  The actors do a commendable job, with Spacey chewing up every scene he's in.  Kline is always solid and no exception here.  But I was really impressed with the ladies.  For this film to work they had to sell their causal flirtatious ways.  Too much would have been unrealistic and too obvious.  Too little would have not been enough to encourage the boys.The Blu ray transfer is certainly acceptable if unexceptional.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  There are a few imperfections but rarely are they particularly noticeable.  Black levels are OK but are inconsistent.  Colors are OK but nothing special.  I noticed no flickering.  The audio comes courtesy of DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Much like the video, it is fine but the lack of surround channels is noticeable.  I also found the dialog to be a little hit or miss at times.  Certainly not a great audio experience.  Still it is quite listenable.

Kevin Kline is a great actor, we all know that, and it was nice to see him play such a warm and wonderful husband.  I was shocked to see  Kevin Spacey looking so different, especially with the full head of blond  hair and a tan!  He really looked wonderful; but what a great actor!  He  certainly played this part well.  At first, you don't think he did it, then  you think maybe, and at the end, bingo == he's the creep!  He can play any  part and he certainly will never be typecast!
