793034,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00014NE6C,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 16]","When one sees the production/direction team of Merchant & Ivory, there comes with that name a level of sophistication, or one could say an air of dedication.  This team is notorious for creating detailed cinema focused inward, toward our characters, instead of outside influences.  Having recently viewed ""The Ballad of the Sad Caf&eacute;"", a character driven story about a rural, staunch feminist played by Vanessa Redgrave, the Merchant & Ivory bar had been set.  The ""Sad Caf&eacute;"" was beautifully filmed, powerfully acted by Redgrave, and the story kept me glued to the couch.  It was a challenging film that introduced me to this dynamic duo.  Now, nearly three months later, ""Quartet"" arrived at my door.  Eager to explore another outing with Merchant and Ivory, I eagerly jumped into the world of Paris in the 1920s, filled with parties, wealth, and intelligent corruption.  While ""Sad Caf&eacute;"" centered around one main character, I anticipated what M&I; would do with four taking each scene - well, needless to say, ""Quartet"" was nothing more than just ""Sad Caf&eacute;"" with Redgrave replaced by Maggie Smith.  Sure, the stories are different, but Smith carried this film - throughout the hour and forty minutes, I watched just her, apathetic towards anyone else.  The music was dull, the scenery was again beautiful but teetered on repetitious, and our story was non-existent.  Cheating socialites ... art thieves ... wives attempting to keep control ... the elements were all in place, but M&I; could not carry the raw emotion to this film.  ""Quartet"", simply put, was downgraded to a miserable solo.Merchant & Ivory did a great job in showing us Paris, 1920, both physically and emotionally.  Having watched other films trying to capture the feel and vision of this era, they went above and beyond by handing us scenes in apartments, lounges, and those eccentric party scenes.  The detail towards both the locations and the costumes were amazing, especially for Maggie Smith who seemed perfect in her imagined time and place.  There was even this great scene that demonstrated the sexual consensus during this era.  As this is a film about the honesty of love, it fit well into the dual-emotions being felt by both Smith and Adjani (the woman who moves into Smith and Bates' relationship).  Ivory, directing this film, has done a phenomenal job of building the imagery, such as the places, events, and material feel for ""Quartet"", and he even does a great job in giving us the symbolism of the characters.  Smith, playing the dedicated wife to her husband, HJ (played by Alan Bates), is eerily similar to the youthful Adjani - seemingly unable to say no to the forceful advances of Bates.  Ivory gives us this rare glimpse to see what a youthful Smith may have been experiencing when she first met Bates, and why she allows this destructive m&eacute;nage a trios.  Coupled with the other sexual parodies throughout, Ivory has captured his desired emotions, but where ""Quartet"" fails is that he doesn't know what to do with them.So, our scenes are set up beautifully.  The underlining meaning behind our characters is also in place (giving graduate students something to talk about), but exactly does this film fail.  ""Quartet"" never reaches the level of ""Sad Caf&eacute;"" because outside of Maggie Smith, none of our characters are worth their price.  A maniacal combination of over-the-top acting and horrid editing, one would nearly need to watch ""Quartet"" four times before fully seeing the central characters come to life.  This was a difficult film to follow, because our leads were impossible to stand behind, and our story seemed rushed and never quite developed.  Sure, we had great visuals to accompany them, but it wasn't enough.  I never thought I knew the pressures of Adjani throughout the entire film - the anger of Bates seemed to come from left field (not enough development), and Adjani's husband could have been a cardboard cut-out and still be able to get the job done.  Due to the sub-par acting, Maggie Smith was able to chomp down hard and demonstrate a full range of abilities.  ""Quartet"" is worth watching merely for Smith, but the rest will leave you bored.  It fails because Ivory has created a film with the minority in mind.This is not a film for everyone, and having seen several slow-moving British films, it wasn't even right for me.  Ivory seems to be lacking a universal message, something that one could escape from the film with.  Something that, in a group of friends, one could say ""But I did like this part because...""  For ""Quartet"" it wasn't there.  Perhaps it was the translation from Jean Rhys' novel.  Not everything can be translated from the printed page, and where you could read a scene as less subtle, Ivory went hysterical.  There were just these moments, especially near the end, where instead of coming to a conclusion, Ivory instituted anger, rage, and screaming.  It just didn't work.  It didn't fit these under-developed characters.  My major issue with this film is that events took place that didn't fit our actors.  We were subjugated to watch them do things in this film that I do not believe they would actually do - our character's actions seemed to negate their voice.Overall, ""Quartet"" stimulated my visual senses, demonstrated the power of Maggie Smith, and slipped some symbolic messages deep within the sub-text of the film, but on every other level it failed.  Again, Smith proved that even playing a secondary character, she could take the role, give us those emotion-filled eyes, and steal away every scene possible.  Even when she wasn't on screen, we couldn't help but wonder what she was doing.  Ivory, as director, cannot seem to control the story.  His failure comes with the horrid translation of Rhys' work.  They chose to replace emotion with rage, which transformed the story's irony of love into confusing connections.  Paris, 1920s, was beautiful.  He hit his stride very well with our location, but the rest of the film flopped like a suffocating fish.  ""Quartet"" is a very dry film - due mainly in part to our disastrous actors unable to life and the doldrums the repeating score.  It had quite a bit of potential, but never quite fulfilled any promises.  Merchant & Ivory created a film that some will love, but missed their opportunity to appeal to greater masses.  Not that this film had to be a blockbuster, by strengthening the characters as well as the story, Ivory could have had another solid cinematic experience.  Instead, it fumbled - causing the viewers to be the ones that suffered the most.Grade: **  out of *****",2,"Not quite a Quartet, simply a Maggie Smith solo...",1220054400,"08 30,

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 2]","Strange the Maggie Smith has starred in two movies entitled &#34;Quartet.&#34; This one, dating from the early 1980s, has a stellar cast and comes with the Merchant-Ivory seal of approval - but it's kind of nasty and repellant.Set in Paris in the 1920s, it tells the story of a young woman played by the haunting Isabelle Adjani whose Polish husband, who peddles in stolen or fraudulent art, is sent to prison for a year. Without money, the young woman falls into the clutches of a creepy English couple played by Alan Bates and Smith. Bates is self-absorbed and repellent and Smith's character is pathetic and subservient. The poor young girl is expected to sleep with the older Englishman - and duly does.I failed to get the point of this movie. The characters are all weak or nasty and there's nobody to identify with.

793036,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00014NE6C,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Sadly, this film is unbearably hard to find and yet it is one of the best films of the 80's and one of the best offerings from Merchant Ivory, so I implore you to do what you can to get your hands on a copy (not everyone is willing to spend nearly $100 on a DVD, but seriously, I'd consider dropping $50 if I were you).  James Ivory is obviously in his wheelhouse here, delving into British aristocracy, and yet he makes it all the more alluring and sexualized, which adds to the intrigue and undeniable draw.The film centers on a young woman named Marya who is left destitute when her husband is convicted of theft and sentenced to jail time.  Alone and penniless, she accepts the open arms of a strange older couple, the Heidlers, and winds up being trapped in her new surroundings by their overbearing presence in her life.  The film delves deeply (yet with such restraint) into the themes of alienation and manipulation and uses sharp dialog and a delicate attention to detail to create a lush and consuming atmosphere with real bite.  As the film progresses, the character's find new layers to uncover and keep the audience at the edge of their seats, waiting for the inevitable to take over.And it does.With impeccable technical facets (those costumes and sets are to die for) and a rich story to work with, it was up to the actors to sell this story under the direction of James Ivory, and they do.  Isabelle Adjani is brilliantly reserved, yet in tune with each arc her character goes through.  But, for me, this film is all about Alan Bates and Maggie Smith, who steal every minute they are on the screen with two vastly different characters who are completely in step with each other's manipulation of Marya.  Bates is oddly perverse in a way that is dominating, and Smith is at her finest here in a surprisingly dramatic turn, one that will send shivers down your spine.I think it's clear that I love this film.  It just gets everything right.  I can't recommend this movie enough, seriously.",5,There is more than a quartet of reasons to love this movie!,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,2003,"['Sadly', 'film', 'unbearably', 'hard', 'find', 'yet', 'one', 'best', 'films', '80', 'one', 'best', 'offerings', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'implore', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'not', 'everyone', 'willing', 'spend', 'nearly', '100', 'DVD', 'seriously', ""'d"", 'consider', 'dropping', '50', 'were', 'James', 'Ivory', 'obviously', 'wheelhouse', 'here', 'delving', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'yet', 'more', 'alluring', 'sexualized', 'intrigue', 'undeniable', 'draw.The', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Marya', 'who', 'left', 'destitute', 'when', 'husband', 'convicted', 'theft', 'sentenced', 'jail', 'time', 'Alone', 'penniless', 'open', 'arms', 'strange', 'older', 'couple', 'Heidlers', 'up', 'being', 'trapped', 'new', 'surroundings', 'overbearing', 'presence', 'life', 'film', 'deeply', 'yet', 'such', 'restraint', 'themes', 'alienation', 'manipulation', 'sharp', 'dialog', 'delicate', 'attention', 'detail', 'create', 'lush', 'consuming', 'atmosphere', 'real', 'bite', 'film', 'character', 'find', 'new', 'layers', 'uncover', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats', 'waiting', 'inevitable', 'take', 'over.And', 'impeccable', 'technical', 'facets', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'die', 'rich', 'story', 'work', 'was', 'up', 'actors', 'sell', 'story', 'direction', 'James', 'Ivory', 'do', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'brilliantly', 'reserved', 'yet', 'tune', 'arc', 'character', 'film', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'steal', 'minute', 'are', 'screen', 'two', 'vastly', 'different', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'step', 'other', 'manipulation', 'Marya', 'Bates', 'oddly', 'perverse', 'way', 'dominating', 'Smith', 'finest', 'here', 'surprisingly', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'one', 'will', 'send', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine.I', 'think', 'clear', 'love', 'film', 'just', 'everything', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'seriously']",Quartet - The Merchant Ivory Collection
793037,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B00014NE6C,Bert vanC Bailey,"[0, 0]","Based on Jean Rhys' first novel, this dark story appears to be a thinly-veiled autobiography of when her literary mentor, novelist Ford Maddox Ford, had her as his 'kept woman.' The plot focuses on his foibles and machinations, and those of his colluding wife - almost as much as on the victim's perspective. It's graced with the artful direction and production of the Merchant & Ivory team, including a good script by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.Best of all, however, it's got Isabelle Adjani in the lead - playing the besotted victim of the indolent Brit couple who have her in their thrall. Maggie Smith is fine and also rather striking in her own way, but although she plays her perverse part well, it doesn't show her talents to best advantage (as seems to be the case with just about anything she does these days). Alan Bates, as her husband, is as good as ever in his role as a repressed, post-Victorian user who is only half-aware and half lying to himself about his doings. The supporting cast and settings - Paris in the 1920s - are also all fine and well done.Still, this flick is a coup mostly for Adjani, whose allure is strongly in the fore: exquisitely beautiful, sometimes coy and youthful, she also manages to conjure a womanly yet hesitant anger as she gradually realizes everyone's indifference towards her, and their callousness about her fate. This includes doubts about verging on prostitution with the man who keeps her - which is never stated outright, though the film's direction makes it very clear. Her grasp is also jaded when it comes to the fourth person in the title's quartet: the slippery, never-quite-committed husband she awaits, without material or other support, until he emerges from prison.The extent of the protagonist's naivety would not fare well at the heart of a story in less sensitive hands than those of the Merchant-Ivory team. Conversely, rabid feminists of the sort who filled the landscape in '81, when this came out, would probably find this most frustrating, what with their lucid views about just what makes men tick and blind spots regarding the complicity of women. (I wonder if there are any still about?) In all, a well-realized production (with close captions) of Rhys's story about convoluted passions.Very well worth watching.",5,Dark flick with Adjani shining ever so bright,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,2280,"['Based', 'Jean', 'Rhys', 'first', 'novel', 'dark', 'story', 'be', 'thinly-veiled', 'autobiography', 'when', 'literary', 'mentor', 'novelist', 'Ford', 'Maddox', 'Ford', 'had', ""'kept"", 'woman', 'plot', 'foibles', 'machinations', 'colluding', 'wife', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'victim', 'perspective', 'graced', 'artful', 'direction', 'production', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'team', 'including', 'good', 'script', 'Ruth', 'Prawer', 'Jhabvala.Best', 'however', 'got', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'lead', 'playing', 'besotted', 'victim', 'indolent', 'Brit', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'thrall', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'fine', 'also', 'rather', 'striking', 'own', 'way', 'perverse', 'part', 'well', ""n't"", 'show', 'talents', 'best', 'advantage', 'be', 'case', 'just', 'anything', 'days', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'husband', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'role', 'repressed', 'post-Victorian', 'user', 'who', 'only', 'half-aware', 'half', 'lying', 'doings', 'supporting', 'cast', 'settings', 'Paris', '1920s', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'well', 'done.Still', 'flick', 'coup', 'mostly', 'Adjani', 'allure', 'strongly', 'fore', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'sometimes', 'coy', 'youthful', 'also', 'conjure', 'womanly', 'yet', 'hesitant', 'anger', 'gradually', 'everyone', 'indifference', 'callousness', 'fate', 'doubts', 'verging', 'prostitution', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'stated', 'outright', 'film', 'direction', 'very', 'clear', 'grasp', 'also', 'jaded', 'when', 'fourth', 'person', 'title', 'quartet', 'slippery', 'never-quite-committed', 'husband', 'material', 'other', 'support', 'prison.The', 'extent', 'protagonist', 'naivety', 'would', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'heart', 'story', 'less', 'sensitive', 'hands', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'team', 'Conversely', 'rabid', 'feminists', 'sort', 'who', 'filled', 'landscape', ""'81"", 'when', 'came', 'out', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'most', 'frustrating', 'what', 'lucid', 'views', 'just', 'what', 'men', 'tick', 'blind', 'spots', 'regarding', 'complicity', 'women', 'wonder', 'are', 'still', 'well-realized', 'production', 'close', 'captions', 'Rhys', 'story', 'convoluted', 'passions.Very', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Quartet - The Merchant Ivory Collection
793038,A1GN6YDINU5FKZ,B00014NE6C,"British Boy Toy ""thirty craze""","[25, 30]","I was really surprised by the negative reviews for this film. But Quartet is not the standard Merchant Ivory film at all. The topic may be dark, but there is still great beauty, great acting and great filmmaking in this story of repression, decadence, alienation and the search for something better (even thought the lead character never finds it).Very incredible performances from Adjani, Smith and Bates.  But that's to be expected. And there should be great applause for many of the supporting actors as well: Anthony Higgins(as Adjani's seductive yet caring husband), Sheila Gish(as a chatty,gossipy closet lesbian) and Daniel Chatto (in a supporting role as a melodramatic adolescent pretty boy).See this movie for the rare dramatic performance from Maggie Smith, who can still make on laugh with just a glance or roll of the eyes. Adjani is astonishing, as is to be expected, playing the lead role of the confused and naieve Mayra. It is probably her best performance since her debut in the Story of Adele H.It is actually quite easy to see why Merchant Ivory decided to make the Jean Rhys novel into a film.  There are clear parallels between characters that Rhys writes about and those In EM Forster's novels.  Quartet's main character, Mayra, is an outsider, desperately trying to get to the inside of something that is considered ""normal"".  Forster lived his life in the same way. Both writers, in their journey for a better life, simply wrote about both the joy and pain along the way in their books.I saw this movie a long time ago on video and the quality was not good. I have to give this movie another 5 stars just because of the excellent transfer. It is 100% better in the audio and the screen presentation.

The late Alan Bates serves up a ridiculous performance as her paramour. Maggie Smith tries hard but comes up laughable.

He is disgusted with his older wife and she, in an effort to keep him happy, has a habit of procuring young women to live with them for his benefit.The acting by Smith and Bates (and Isabelle Adjani and Anthony Higgins, as the innocent young couple) is flawless, but the story is sordid, sad, and utterly depressing. It ends on a hopeless note, leaving me sorry I watched it. The glittery, jazzy, Parisian scene is convincing with beautiful sets and costumes, but they couldn't lessen the ugliness of it all.This Merchant-Ivory movie was made in 1981, and is unrelated to this year's, ""Quartet,"" which also stars Maggie Smith.

Set in Paris in the 20's with the wonderful costumes as well as the bars and bistros of Montmarte, it's a treat to watch.  The cast is first rate--the quartet of Bates, Adjani, Smith and Higgins couldn't be better.I didn't read the book from which it was adapted so I can't compare the two.  Obviously it's not a happy story, based on the life of the author.  So what could they do to make it entertaining, besides provide the lush settings and cast?  Well, the scriptwriter, in the interview with the producers, said she tried to ""lift it up.""  If this was uplifting, I don't think I want to read the novel.I was surprised that so few people had reviewed this film.  Perhaps it was panned when it came out---I don't recall every hearing about it.  I can understand, though, the lack of enthusiasm because it's pretty much unrelieved misery.  This doesn't make for good drama.  The heroine, played by Adjani, goes from a bad situation to a worse one and there is no respite.  Likewise the poor wife, played by Smith and her creepy husband, Bates.  Only the guy who was thrown in jail for illegal art dealing and who seems to have the worst luck of all, seems to have a chance for a decent life---he's outta there.I was a student in Paris and could relate to the intensely beautiful and romantic life that it seems to foster so I think I may like this kind of film more than most.  Still, it left me feeling depressed and numb---not a good movie going experience.",3,Paris in the 20's for better or worse,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,1543,"['film', 'splendid', 'visuals', 'expect', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'production', 'Set', 'Paris', '20', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'as', 'well', 'bars', 'bistros', 'Montmarte', 'treat', 'watch', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'quartet', 'Bates', 'Adjani', 'Smith', 'Higgins', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'was', 'adapted', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'not', 'happy', 'story', 'based', 'life', 'author', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'make', 'entertaining', 'lush', 'settings', 'cast', 'Well', 'scriptwriter', 'interview', 'producers', 'said', 'tried', 'lift', 'up', 'was', 'uplifting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'read', 'novel.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'had', 'reviewed', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'panned', 'when', 'came', 'out', '-I', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'hearing', 'can', 'understand', 'lack', 'enthusiasm', 'pretty', 'much', 'unrelieved', 'misery', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'drama', 'heroine', 'played', 'Adjani', 'bad', 'situation', 'worse', 'one', 'respite', 'Likewise', 'poor', 'wife', 'played', 'Smith', 'creepy', 'husband', 'Bates', 'Only', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'thrown', 'jail', 'illegal', 'art', 'dealing', 'who', 'have', 'worst', 'luck', 'have', 'chance', 'decent', 'life', '-he', 'outta', 'there.I', 'was', 'student', 'Paris', 'could', 'relate', 'intensely', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'life', 'foster', 'so', 'think', 'may', 'like', 'kind', 'film', 'more', 'most', 'Still', 'left', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'numb', '-not', 'good', 'movie', 'going', 'experience']",Quartet - The Merchant Ivory Collection
