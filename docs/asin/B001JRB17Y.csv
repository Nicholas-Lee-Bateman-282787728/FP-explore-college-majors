1206666,A3U0S17XYK8XMJ,B001JRB17Y,Alexander Lucard,"[1, 2]","The Secret of the Magic Gourd is a Disney original started out as a novella by Zhang Tianyi, and was first made into a movie in 1963. This remake, which combines live-action and CGI, was the first picture produced by the Disney corporation specifically for the Chinese market, with English speaking audiences as an afterthought. One of the most striking things about the film was watching it in English and then in Mandarin (with the subtitles turned off) to see if I could get a better handle on the language. I should point out that I've been taking Mandarin for several years now, and although my knowledge of the language is far from fluent, I could piece together the story, moods, and most importantly the intonations. What I discovered is that although the English dubbed version of this film is very different (to the point of changing full sentences and topics to better fit the English speaking audience), the overall tone and message of the movie remained the same. Sadly, this message wasn't very good in either case.Wang Bao (or Raymond in the US version) is a lazy, selfish, slacker child who really seems to care little for his family, classmates, or humanity in general. This my friends, is your protagonist. He is an amazingly unlikeable character throughout the entire movie, albeit it MUCH MORE SO in the English dub than in the Mandarin, mainly due to the actor doing his lines.One day Wang Bao finds the magic sentient walking, talking gourd from his grandmother's fairy tales.  ""Hu Lu"" (Or Bailey as it is called in the English version) decides that he will serve the Wang Bao's and use his magical power to grant Bao's every wish. Of course the problem here is that Bao is an extremely selfish child who doesn't understand Newton's Third Law and that everything he wishes for, has to come from someplace else. As well Bailey, not being human is incapable of understanding metaphor or anything other than an extract literal meaning of Bao's wishes. This level of confusion, is of course, where the comedy is supposed to come in.The moral of the movie is that one needs to take responsibility for one's own actions and that it is better to try and fail, rather than to let someone else do the work for you, lest you never grow as a person. I wholeheartedly support this Afterschool Special type message, but due to a combination of acting/subpar writing, one really doesn't get this fully. You spend almost all of the movie hating Bao for being just an awful child who treats everyone around him with disdain and contempt, while you feel so bad for the cute little gourd who just can't please his master and who doesn't understand why he is always so mentally and physically abusive to him. Now I LOVE slapstick ala the 3 Stooges, but man did I think ""Bao is going to grow up to be a wife beater"" from the way he treated the innocent little magical gourd.Bao never truly gets his comeuppance for his actions in this film, which defeats the whole purpose of the movie. At most, he got a wrist slap for cheating on a test instead of full punishment due to how good he has been at everything lately...which was actually Hu Lu's doing. In the end everyone love's him for being awesome and Hu Lu gets thrown into a pond. Only at the very end does Bao apologize for his misdeeds, but that only comes after he wins a Swim Meet and realizes this is the first thing he's ever done on his own without using others to do the work for him. Hu Lu thankfully decides to find another child who will appreciate him better, which is the best part of the movie.The Mandarin cast did a great job, while the American cast was wooden and phoning it in, much like what dubbing used to be for Japanese movies and anime in the 1980's. The actual DVD layout is odd too, as it just goes into the movie and the special features in succession without letting you choose what to watch and when.  The CGI effects, while not up to the level of Pixar, were quite nice and CGI frogs and birds were very well done and quite realistic.In the end, this isn't a bad first effort for Disney gearing itself toward the mainland Chinese market, but it's also not a good one by any means. Bao/Rodney needed to be a lot less prickish in order to make the audience like him, or at least feel sympathy for him. Moreover, the message of ""Take responsibility for your actions"" is diluted into ""Being a jerk gets you a head in life. Only actually try your hardest when your back is up against the wall. Otherwise someone else will do it for you."" That's not cool.Mediocre movie overall, and this is far better off as a rental rather than a purchase.",3,"Not a bad first start for Disney, but the overall product was off the mark.",1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,4622,"['Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'Disney', 'original', 'started', 'out', 'novella', 'Zhang', 'Tianyi', 'was', 'first', 'made', 'movie', '1963', 'remake', 'live-action', 'CGI', 'was', 'first', 'picture', 'produced', 'Disney', 'corporation', 'specifically', 'Chinese', 'market', 'English', 'speaking', 'audiences', 'afterthought', 'One', 'most', 'striking', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'English', 'then', 'Mandarin', 'subtitles', 'turned', 'off', 'see', 'could', 'get', 'better', 'handle', 'language', 'should', 'point', 'out', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taking', 'Mandarin', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'knowledge', 'language', 'far', 'fluent', 'could', 'piece', 'together', 'story', 'moods', 'most', 'importantly', 'intonations', 'What', 'discovered', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'point', 'changing', 'full', 'sentences', 'topics', 'better', 'fit', 'English', 'speaking', 'audience', 'overall', 'tone', 'message', 'movie', 'remained', 'same', 'Sadly', 'message', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'case.Wang', 'Bao', 'Raymond', 'US', 'version', 'lazy', 'selfish', 'slacker', 'child', 'who', 'really', 'care', 'little', 'family', 'classmates', 'humanity', 'general', 'friends', 'protagonist', 'amazingly', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'MUCH', 'MORE', 'SO', 'English', 'dub', 'Mandarin', 'mainly', 'due', 'actor', 'doing', 'lines.One', 'day', 'Wang', 'Bao', 'magic', 'sentient', 'walking', 'talking', 'gourd', 'grandmother', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Hu', 'Lu', 'Or', 'Bailey', 'called', 'English', 'version', 'will', 'serve', 'Wang', 'Bao', 'use', 'magical', 'power', 'grant', 'Bao', 'wish', 'course', 'problem', 'here', 'Bao', 'extremely', 'selfish', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Newton', 'Third', 'Law', 'everything', 'come', 'someplace', 'else', 'well', 'Bailey', 'not', 'being', 'human', 'incapable', 'understanding', 'metaphor', 'anything', 'other', 'extract', 'literal', 'meaning', 'Bao', 'wishes', 'level', 'confusion', 'course', 'where', 'comedy', 'supposed', 'come', 'in.The', 'moral', 'movie', 'one', 'take', 'responsibility', 'one', 'own', 'actions', 'better', 'try', 'fail', 'rather', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'work', 'lest', 'never', 'grow', 'person', 'wholeheartedly', 'support', 'Afterschool', 'Special', 'type', 'message', 'due', 'combination', 'acting/subpar', 'writing', 'one', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'fully', 'spend', 'almost', 'movie', 'hating', 'Bao', 'being', 'just', 'awful', 'child', 'who', 'everyone', 'disdain', 'contempt', 'feel', 'so', 'bad', 'cute', 'little', 'gourd', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'please', 'master', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'always', 'so', 'mentally', 'physically', 'abusive', 'Now', 'LOVE', 'slapstick', '3', 'Stooges', 'man', 'did', 'think', 'Bao', 'going', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'wife', 'beater', 'way', 'treated', 'innocent', 'little', 'magical', 'gourd.Bao', 'never', 'truly', 'comeuppance', 'actions', 'film', 'whole', 'purpose', 'movie', 'most', 'got', 'wrist', 'slap', 'cheating', 'test', 'instead', 'full', 'punishment', 'due', 'how', 'good', 'been', 'everything', 'lately', 'was', 'actually', 'Hu', 'Lu', 'doing', 'end', 'everyone', 'love', 'being', 'awesome', 'Hu', 'Lu', 'thrown', 'pond', 'Only', 'very', 'end', 'Bao', 'apologize', 'misdeeds', 'only', 'Swim', 'Meet', 'realizes', 'first', 'thing', 'ever', 'done', 'own', 'using', 'others', 'do', 'work', 'Hu', 'Lu', 'thankfully', 'find', 'child', 'who', 'will', 'appreciate', 'better', 'best', 'part', 'movie.The', 'Mandarin', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'American', 'cast', 'was', 'wooden', 'phoning', 'much', 'what', 'dubbing', 'used', 'be', 'Japanese', 'movies', 'anime', '1980', 'actual', 'DVD', 'layout', 'odd', 'too', 'just', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'succession', 'letting', 'choose', 'what', 'watch', 'when', 'CGI', 'effects', 'not', 'level', 'Pixar', 'were', 'quite', 'nice', 'CGI', 'frogs', 'birds', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'quite', 'realistic.In', 'end', ""n't"", 'bad', 'first', 'effort', 'Disney', 'gearing', 'mainland', 'Chinese', 'market', 'also', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'means', 'Bao/Rodney', 'needed', 'be', 'lot', 'less', 'prickish', 'order', 'make', 'audience', 'least', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Moreover', 'message', 'Take', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'diluted', 'Being', 'jerk', 'head', 'life', 'Only', 'actually', 'try', 'hardest', 'when', 'back', 'up', 'wall', 'Otherwise', 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'do', 'not', 'cool.Mediocre', 'movie', 'overall', 'far', 'better', 'off', 'rental', 'rather', 'purchase']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 5]","If there was ever any doubt that China couldn't make ...something (anything!), then this film should put that to rest.A Disney feature shot entirely in China and dubbed for American audiences (in this version), THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a mixture of Disneyesque proportions with heavy Chinese influences. Although not troubling in terms of entertainment, it is if you're in the entertainment industry. How far will we go to save an extra buck?The story itself does battle with inconsistencies and an incredibly simple -- if not downright ridiculous -- premise. It is the story of a boy and his ...well ...gourd. A magic gourd rumored to live not far from Bau Hu Lu (Chinese child star Peisi Chen) and spoken of in fable form by Bau's grandmother. The gourd, it is rumored, will grant any wish to whomever is its master. For Bau, who is lazy and wants nothing to do with his school work, it seems like a dream come true when he meets up with the Magic Gourd. But having all your wishes granted can turn to nightmares, as Bau learns. And the lesson is easily transparent for adults and kids alike. Perhaps too transparent.Bau learns a few life basics by doing his own work and becoming a better person for it. No surprise.One of the bigger story issues I had was the occasional incorporation of a frog-friend to the gourd who seemed to have no other purpose than to hop around and croak at us a few times.

When he encounters Bailey, a walking, talking gourd while fishing the amazed Raymond is promised all of his wishes are about to come true. It appears as though he's now the ""luckiest kid on the planet."" However when Bailey begins to take everything Raymond says literally and act on every comment made by his young master things begin to fall apart. Eventually he comes to understand such important lessons as personal satisfaction in one's achievements can only truly be appreciated when obtained honestly and hard work is its own reward.`The Secret of the Magic Gourd' is a kids only film, utterly lacking any underlying currents of nuanced adult comedy that would attract an over 7 year old audience.

Weaver,"[0, 1]","The story of a lazy boy who wishes for everything to be done for him meeting up with a magic gourd who wants to use his power to its full capability and do everything for its master is a great foundation.In the end they both learn the value of hard work and self accomplishment.The Chinese social environment of teamwork, teaching by positive example, and family values also gives this movies a must see review by me.However the English overdub was lackluster and poorly done. While not throughout the film, there are some attempts to Americanize the dialog that just seem out of place as they distract from the story.(goldfish instead of koi, knight instead of horse, reference to food having no MSG, etc.)Most of the animation was fantastic although the gourd looked more like flubber than a vegetable and the one scene with flying food looked like it was all plastic.Had they spent a little more time in the studio and really tweaked the voice acting this could have been a box office hit. And with today's technology, there is really no reason they couldn't have reworked the gourd and had his English speaking match up with the voice.Fortunately the movie has the Chinese voice track, I highly suggest you try that version. While still not as good sound fields as you find in US made movies The Secret of the Magic Gourd has an entirely different feel with the original actors doing the voices.There is no doubt Chinese culture is full of rich stories to share with the world, I look forward to more projects like this!",3,"Really good movie, just missed a couple marks...",1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,1524,"['story', 'lazy', 'boy', 'who', 'everything', 'be', 'done', 'meeting', 'up', 'magic', 'gourd', 'who', 'use', 'power', 'full', 'capability', 'do', 'everything', 'master', 'great', 'foundation.In', 'end', 'learn', 'value', 'hard', 'work', 'accomplishment.The', 'Chinese', 'social', 'environment', 'teamwork', 'teaching', 'positive', 'example', 'family', 'values', 'also', 'movies', 'must', 'see', 'review', 'me.However', 'English', 'overdub', 'was', 'lackluster', 'poorly', 'done', 'not', 'film', 'are', 'attempts', 'Americanize', 'dialog', 'just', 'seem', 'out', 'place', 'distract', 'story', 'goldfish', 'instead', 'koi', 'knight', 'instead', 'horse', 'reference', 'food', 'having', 'MSG', 'etc', 'Most', 'animation', 'was', 'fantastic', 'gourd', 'looked', 'more', 'flubber', 'vegetable', 'one', 'scene', 'flying', 'food', 'looked', 'was', 'plastic.Had', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'studio', 'really', 'tweaked', 'voice', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'today', 'technology', 'really', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'reworked', 'gourd', 'had', 'English', 'speaking', 'match', 'up', 'voice.Fortunately', 'movie', 'Chinese', 'voice', 'track', 'highly', 'suggest', 'try', 'version', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'sound', 'fields', 'find', 'US', 'made', 'movies', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'entirely', 'different', 'feel', 'original', 'actors', 'doing', 'voices.There', 'doubt', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'full', 'rich', 'stories', 'share', 'world', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'projects']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd
1206676,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001JRB17Y,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","This is a really great movie idea given the Disney gloss treatment.To quote my almost 13 year old son, ""it was kind of cheesy, and it made you laugh a few times."" It seems that 13 might just be the upper age limit to watch this movie, or at least to be captivated by it.This was a minor disappointment in a few regards. I remember The International Childrens' Film Festival on television - Skinny and Fatty (not available anywhere on any media) anyone? Those were small movies from around the world that had a memorable message and were absolutely captivating to me, at age 10. Sadly The Secret of the Magic Gourd was just not that kind of film.The bigger disappointment came with the over Disneying of this film. The music was jarring in it's melodrama, strings that reinforced what was already obvious visually. The computer generated effects were decent, but were almost unnecessary - aside from the gourd itself. And the cast that dubbed the film went a bit over the top.This film would actually be a much better film viewed in original Chinese with English subtitles. The sound is infinitely better, the voices blend with the live sound of the film. The expressions in the actors' voices are excellent. The English track was done by a few of the cast from High School Musical. It just doesn't work very well. Sadly, it would be almost impossible for a 8, 9, or 10 year old to keep up reading and watching.The story is sweet. The message is really fantastic. There's a sense at the end of the film, good did triumph. However, the film went on for about 3 minutes too long. There was a logical ending, but the director chose to go on for two more montages. Unfortunate.The filming is first rate. Focus is perfect in every scene. The camera work, movement and framing is outstanding. Technically very well done. There are several slow motion moments that do not fit, it's a very sad technique that is getting more popular. Exposure of the film was perfect. The colors are spot on, and very nice. The production was first rate. Editing was fairly standard, nothing fantastic, but also not bad.Because this is Disney the film managed to get a G rating. My guess, if this had been an independet Chinese film with no Disney backing, it would have gotten a PG rating. There is a scene where the boy gets chinese chess (they are shaped more like American checkers) pieces in his mouth and does a cross between vomitting and spitting them out. We actually all looked away at that moment. There's no violence or extremely scary moments. It's a very well thought out film with a nice message.Almost an hour and a half. The DVD transfer is not good. At several fade to or from black moments there's a ton of compression artifacts that show up. The surround sound was only used to advantage a few times. There was a decent boom at one point that did work the subwoofer. Bonus features are a blooper reel, a making of featurette, a music video, and a DVD game (these are usually really lame). And there are a ton of previews, all horribly hurt by compression artifacts. Disney should have skipped all that and done a higher bit rate transfer on the feature film.A pleasant enough film. The Disney magic should have been left off.April 28 update: There is a film that has a very similar story line,CJ7. If you like childrens' international film to be really international and less glossy, this would be an excellent choice.

The actor's interaction with the animated gourd is decent. You do get a feeling of chemistry between them. However, the movie is pretty lame compared to the movies I grew up with.

The first of Disney's Chinese co-productions, the film did respectable business in China, where it is titled ""Bao hu lu de mi mi.""In the interest of lip synchronization, the young boy's name is changed from ""Bao"" to ""Raymond"" and the Gourd's name is ""Bailey,"" from the Chinese ""Hu lu"" (could it be that the website hulu gets its name from here)?The story, from a classic Chinese children's book, is a dreamlike, present day tale in which a boy learns to be careful what he wishes for -- a theme explored with horror in ""The Monkey's Paw"" and The Twilight Zone and with humor on I Dream of Jeannie. Some of the wacky antics caused by little Bailey in his earnest attempts to please his ""master"" reminded me very much of ""Jeannie.""U.S. film and TV makers might take a closer look at Gourd, with its traditional family, caring teacher and pleasant friends. No bumbling dysfunctional parents (or lack thereof), no caricatured authority figures or no snarky, hip-holding preteens here. The kids aren't always nice to Raymond but they do stick with him in the end.Speaking of hip-holding preteens, the presence of High School Musical star Corbin Bleu is very likely a device to allow youngsters the privilege of watching this movie without eye-rolls and loud sighs from older siblings. But don't underestimate him -- Bleu does a very creditable job. His natural likeability shines through his vocal performance. That's not easy when you've also got to act as well as focus on replacing dialogue recorded and animated for another language.The film largely rises and falls on whether you like Raymond and especially Bailey, and it succeeds thanks to skillful work by the entire American cast, including Bleu and singer/actress Megan Hilty, under the guidance of Disney veteran Rick Dempsey, who also co-wrote the lyrics to the end title song, ""Worlds of Wonder.""The English script also avoids an overabundance of pop culture references and slang. Bailey might say one or two Americanized things here and there, but he's not a boogie-ing gangsta gourd, as I'm sure the Chinese version of the Gourd is not either.Speaking of music, the fine original score by Peter Kam is one of the things I enjoyed most about The Secret of the Magic Gourd, yet I've not seen it available either in an English or Chinese soundtrack album. I'd also like to see an English version of the book.The bonus material is primarily Chinese promotional documentary footage with English subtitles. It would have been nice to see Bleu and the cast working on the dubbing, a very special kind of acting that takes special talent to carry off properly.

1206683,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001JRB17Y,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","From the Department of You Should Know What You're Getting Into: Not that this is that big of a deal but, in viewing the front and back of this dvd jacket, there's not much to suggest that THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a Chinese film. Okay, it's also a Disney venture as Uncle Walt's little studio partnered up with China Film Group and the Hong Kong effects house Centro Digital Pictures to make this film. But, still, what's that all about, that advertising by omission?No such thing as a free lunch, this cautionary adage extending forever back and definitely to 1958, when Zhang Tian Yi's beloved children's novel was first published. This novel is the source material for THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD (or BAO HU LU DE MI MI, in its native tongue), an okay film highlighted with several nifty moments, although you see where it's heading almost from the get-go. Admittedly, it took me a while to get into the movie, but I did end up liking it enough to (mildly) recommend it. With some caveats.It takes place in contemporary China and revolves around 11-year-old Wang Bao (or ""Raymond Bao"" in the English dub). Wang Bao has imagination oozing out of his ears, yet he's a lazy kid and reluctant to apply himself. Wang Bao would rather sleep late or day dream, design space crafts or go fishing. Scholastically, his sloth often costs his study group, which usually ends up with low grades because of his lack of contribution. While out fishing one day, Wang Bao yearns for the easy way out, to get the best grades in class without lifting a finger. Moments later, he nabs the catch of the day - a gourd, and an enchanted talking one.The gourd's name is Hu Lu (inexplicably westernized to ""Bailey"" in the English dub) and it has the ability to grant any wish to its master, of whom Wang Bao is now. And if you thought Wang Bao was a sluggard before, what now that his every whim is catered to? A school of bright-colored fishes jumping into his pail... The sudden ability to swim laps like Aquaman... Soaring in the sky on a diminutive airplane... His schoolwork being done for him... Man, how sweet to have your wishes come true. Until things start going sour, the scenario being flipped. The gourd tends to take his master's wishes too literally, this resulting in various eggs in the face for Wang Bao. It gets bad enough that Wang Bao finds himself being accused of lying and cheating. Plus, things can't surely be on the rosy side if, alarmingly, you're being chased by dinosaurs.As mentioned, we see early on how this movie is going to play out; it's no great shakes figuring out the nature of this morality play. But, in case the imparted lessons fly over the audience's head, the themes of ""be careful what you wish for"" and ""hard work is groovy"" are ran to the ground.This is a live action film which combines animated CG elements. No complaints about the live action part as I feel the actors do a fine job. But I was wary of the CG, which isn't as technologically sound as could've hoped for, particularly with how the gourd is rendered. In its simplicity, the gourd seems to belong in a television cartoon, although it's so darn cute I guess it does grow on you. And same with that frog. Somewhat making up for that feeling of ""Huh!"" the sequences with the fishes circling the sky and the hectic toy invasion are pretty cool, although that last one may have had too much of a TOY STORY vibe. Doubtless, the film's target audience (ages 6 and below?) will eat all this up. But, word to the wise, in an age rife with Harry Potter movies, slick Pixar productions and classic Hayao Miyazaki animation, there's a chance the older sorts may find themselves stifling some yawns. On a sidenote, I always prefer to watch a foreign film in its native tongue, and I have to say it was exasperating whenever the characters' Chinese names are uttered and the English sub-titles would translate them as either ""Raymond"" or ""Bailey.""The film can be viewed in the Mandarin or Cantonese track or in the English dub which showcases the voice of HIGH SCHOOL HIGH's Corbin Bleu as the Magic Gourd. As well, English sub-titles for the hearing-impaired is made available. Bonus features offer 85 seconds of outtakes (featuring the magic gourd as it fumbles its lines and messes up its scenes) and the ""Too Many Toys!"" game (a simple activity in which you're asked to match shapes). Clicking on ""Backstage Disney"" will take you to two options: a Behind the Scenes look (28 minutes long, with English sub-titles) as Directors John Chu and Frankie Chung discuss the film-making process - and the music video of the end credits song ""World of Wonder"" (Chinese version) as sung by Mandopop singer Zhang Hanyun.I can't help but think that THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD would've benefited tremendously if it were instead a short film. As it is, this film does show some imagination and the lead kid is pretty good. But, ultimately, THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD goes down like a Karen Carpenter song, easily digestible but pretty bland.",3,fish may have poured and dinosaurs roared... still I got bored with the

1206685,AM4UVNWCW9NJE,B001JRB17Y,iansomniak,"[3, 5]","This is the story of a Chinese boy by the name of Raymond (a.k.a. Wang Bao) who has a creative imagination, but is chronically lazy and forgetful.  Ray has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning, and he stubbornly refuses to trim his toenails on a regular basis (which, of course, can eventually wreak havoc on one's socks and shoes).  The flaw that gets young Raymond into the most trouble, however, is his habitual failure to study for the rigorous math exams, administered daily by his demanding teacher, Miss Lee.  It seems that in China, students work in groups, so one slacker will negatively affect the whole team's grade.  Thus, Raymond's carelessness infuriates not only his instructor, but his classmates as well.  One fateful afternoon, a dejected Raymond flees the jeers of his peers and heads for the lake to do some fishing.  There he makes a wish, a wish to succeed in school and life without having to do any work or spend any time studying.  Enter Bailey (or Bao Hulu), a diminutive genie in the form of a Chinese bottle gourd.Bailey seems like an odd name for a gourd (Gordon would be better), but this little fellow is no ordinary gourd.  Looking a bit like a dollop of soft-serve ice-cream, this anthropomorphic calabash has widely spaced button-like eyes on the upper half of his body, a hollow mouth in the middle of his belly, and no nose whatsoever.  He appears to be made of plastic, like a Mr. Potato Head toy, and his rubbery limbs stretch and expand like Mr. Fantastic's.  The Magic Gourd is also a shape-shifter, like the Shmoo, who can morph into anything from a speedboat engine to an alarm clock.  He can melt into a puddle or grow into a giant monster...he can even burst into flames at will, without being consumed in the inferno.  What's more, Bailey is an infinitely powerful sorcerer who can fly jet planes and make cheeseburgers and snack cakes materialize out of thin air.  He can build robots...calculate complex mathematical problems...and YES, he can clip toenails like nobody's business!  Can the gourd really free Raymond from life's day-to-day drudgeries...or will he only cause more trouble?The Magic Gourd DVD boasts a beautifully clear and colorful widescreen transfer with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  Bonus features consist of Bailey's computer-animated bloopers; a DVD game; a behind-the-scenes featurette; and a music video of the Chinese version of the movie's theme song.  In addition to the English dub, the Mandarin and Cantonese vocal tracks are included, but the only subtitle choice available for them is the closed captioning of the English version.  Since Bailey the Gourd is trying to do for nail care what Smokey the Bear did for forest fire prevention, it would have been nice if Disney had included a free pair of clippers in the DVD case.  Well, maybe they're saving that for the platinum edition.The tale of the Magic Gourd is apparently a well known story in China, but Americans will probably find the whole concept of a gourd-shaped wizard to be kind of bizarre.  The folks at Disney have tried to Americanize this production by casting High School Musical's Corbin Bleu, changing all the Chinese names and having the characters say the word ""awesome"" a lot...but I doubt that the Magic Gourd will become the next Hannah Montana.  Nevertheless, this is a pretty entertaining family film with a positive message.",4,"""Don't forget to clip your nails!""",1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,3394,"['story', 'Chinese', 'boy', 'name', 'Raymond', 'a.k.a', 'Wang', 'Bao', 'who', 'creative', 'imagination', 'chronically', 'lazy', 'forgetful', 'Ray', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'bed', 'morning', 'stubbornly', 'trim', 'toenails', 'regular', 'basis', 'course', 'can', 'eventually', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'one', 'socks', 'shoes', 'flaw', 'young', 'Raymond', 'most', 'trouble', 'however', 'habitual', 'failure', 'study', 'rigorous', 'math', 'exams', 'administered', 'daily', 'demanding', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Lee', 'China', 'students', 'work', 'groups', 'one', 'slacker', 'will', 'negatively', 'affect', 'whole', 'team', 'grade', 'Thus', 'Raymond', 'carelessness', 'not', 'only', 'instructor', 'classmates', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'fateful', 'afternoon', 'dejected', 'Raymond', 'jeers', 'peers', 'heads', 'lake', 'do', 'fishing', 'wish', 'wish', 'succeed', 'school', 'life', 'having', 'do', 'work', 'spend', 'time', 'studying', 'Enter', 'Bailey', 'Bao', 'Hulu', 'diminutive', 'genie', 'form', 'Chinese', 'bottle', 'gourd.Bailey', 'odd', 'name', 'gourd', 'Gordon', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'little', 'fellow', 'ordinary', 'gourd', 'Looking', 'bit', 'dollop', 'soft-serve', 'ice-cream', 'anthropomorphic', 'calabash', 'widely', 'spaced', 'button-like', 'eyes', 'upper', 'half', 'body', 'hollow', 'mouth', 'middle', 'belly', 'nose', 'whatsoever', 'be', 'made', 'plastic', 'Mr', 'Potato', 'Head', 'toy', 'rubbery', 'limbs', 'stretch', 'expand', 'Mr', 'Fantastic', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'also', 'shape-shifter', 'Shmoo', 'who', 'can', 'morph', 'anything', 'speedboat', 'engine', 'alarm', 'clock', 'can', 'melt', 'puddle', 'grow', 'giant', 'monster', 'can', 'even', 'burst', 'flames', 'will', 'being', 'consumed', 'inferno', 'What', 'more', 'Bailey', 'infinitely', 'powerful', 'sorcerer', 'who', 'can', 'fly', 'jet', 'planes', 'make', 'cheeseburgers', 'snack', 'cakes', 'materialize', 'thin', 'air', 'can', 'build', 'robots', 'calculate', 'complex', 'mathematical', 'problems', 'YES', 'can', 'clip', 'toenails', 'nobody', 'business', 'Can', 'gourd', 'really', 'free', 'Raymond', 'life', 'day-to-day', 'drudgeries', 'will', 'only', 'cause', 'more', 'trouble', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'DVD', 'beautifully', 'clear', 'colorful', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'Bonus', 'consist', 'Bailey', 'computer-animated', 'bloopers', 'DVD', 'game', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'music', 'video', 'Chinese', 'version', 'movie', 'theme', 'song', 'addition', 'English', 'dub', 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'are', 'included', 'only', 'subtitle', 'choice', 'available', 'closed', 'captioning', 'English', 'version', 'Bailey', 'Gourd', 'trying', 'do', 'nail', 'care', 'what', 'Bear', 'did', 'forest', 'fire', 'prevention', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Disney', 'had', 'included', 'free', 'pair', 'clippers', 'DVD', 'case', 'Well', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'saving', 'platinum', 'edition.The', 'tale', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'apparently', 'well', 'known', 'story', 'China', 'Americans', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'whole', 'concept', 'gourd-shaped', 'wizard', 'be', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'folks', 'Disney', 'have', 'tried', 'Americanize', 'production', 'casting', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'changing', 'Chinese', 'names', 'having', 'characters', 'say', 'word', 'awesome', 'lot', 'doubt', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'will', 'become', 'next', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Nevertheless', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'family', 'film', 'positive', 'message']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd

There are many Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Italian and French films which has caught my fancy without actually having high expectations. Of the Asian films, most were martial arts/action movies, with the European films, a lot were drama. Disney's entry to co-producing an international movie seems to take off in good stride EXCEPT I could not ignore the mere cheesiness of this film. Like one reviewer said here, ""there is a certain age limit"" where you can be captivated by this film. Unlike traditional Disney films where both kids and adults develop a cult following, the Secret of the Magic Gourd just doesnt initiate that sentimentality. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie but only to a certain extent. I enjoyed the music, certainly enjoyed the message or lesson of the movie concerning ones independence. I also liked the animation, it certainly does not look like it was cheaply made. Overall, Disney's foray to international co-production seems to head in the right direction. I certainly recommended this movie for kids under 12 years old but for older ones, they might find it not to their liking.

1206688,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B001JRB17Y,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 2]","I am extremely excited about ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" - the first collaboration between Walt Disney Pictures and China Film Group.  It is based on a fairy tale written in the 1950's by famous Chinese author Tianyi Zhang.  Director/producer John Chu successfully brings this story to the big screen.  Filmed in Hangzhou (where the author attended primary school), ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" combines live action with animation; this is accomplished by 3-D special effects from Centro Digital Pictures.""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" teaches children that they must work hard in order to have fulfillment and satisfaction.  They can't rely on others to help them win races and pass tests.  Raymond is a pre-teen who is lazy but highly imaginative.  He dreams of rescuing astronauts from a doomed space station.  He fails at math because he doesn't study.  One day, while fishing, he reels in an adorable talking gourd, Bailey, who promises to grant him his every wish.  In return, Raymond must keep the gourd's existence a secret.Poor Bailey has great intentions but every wish he grants his new master has disastrous (and hilarious) consequences.  For example, Raymond wants to see a dinosaur movie but it is sold out.  Bailey misinterprets Raymond's wish to ""get into the movie.""  Suddenly, Raymond discovers himself being chased by a dinosaur; he is actually inside the film.  Another time, Raymond offhandedly remarks that he wants all the toys in a store.  While bicycling on the highway, he discovers that hundreds of toys are following him home.""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is great entertainment for the entire family.  All ages can benefit from the moral lessons that are taught:  We must all work hard for what we want and never cheat or steal.  The cinematography and animation are beautiful.  The theme song, World of Wonder,"" is performed by Megan Hilty and is very uplifting and inspiring.  It is on a par with the theme songs from Disney classics such as ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and ""Aladdin.""  Chinese friends once told me that Walt Disney`s ""Mulan"" was also based on a Chinese story and was used to encourage children to respect and take care of their aging parents.Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has put together a wonderful DVD package.  First of all, the film is presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  English, Mandarin, and Cantonese language tracks are available with optional English subtitles.  There are several special features:1) Bloopers:  These are hilarious animation shorts of Bailey having accidents, such as the movie dinosaur stepping on him.2) Games & Activities:  ""Too Many Toys!"" is a game that helps children develop hand and eye coordination.  They must match toys with the packing foam cutouts in their shipping crates.3) Music Video:  The Chinese version of ""World of Wonder"" is wonderfully performed by the gorgeous and talented  Zhang Hanyun.  We later learn that she was highly influenced by the theme song from ""The Little Mermaid.""4)  Backstage Disney:  Interviews are conducted with Director/Producer John Chu and other executives.  Zhu Qilong is shown auditioning for his role as Raymond (Wang Bao in the Chinese version).  Many of his scenes are shot in front of blue screens and the animation inserted later.  He must be a very energetic, athletic child in order to perform his numerous action sequences.  This special feature was extremely interesting.5)  Trailers for other live action films (""Space Buddies,"" ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"" etc.) have been provided.Overall, ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is a great DVD to add to anyone's Walt Disney DVD collection.  It will go down in history as another Disney classic.  For me, it provided a great cultural insight into Chinese life.  The Chinese are not much different than we are.  It was interesting to see the children at school playing chess.  My two nephews who are about Raymond's age love to play chess.

Hmm...I don't know kids nowadays are more intelligent to buy this load of make-believe. But there is also something idealistically engaging about thick Mainland Chinese production which will appeal to the kid in you. The cutesy picture brings live action and animation together quite decently to appeal to the younger viewers. There are some imaginative and adorable sequences which involve fishes, chess pieces, a ferocious dinosaur and an army of toys. Just don't expect Pixar standards.The magic gourd is a somewhat awkward creation but Chinese voice actor Chen Pei Si (who also voiced Edna Mode and Mushu in China's version of ""The Incredibles"" and ""Mulan"") brings life to the delightful character with enough zest.Also, watch out for Gigi Leung's otherwise bland performance as a Mathematics teacher who manages to make us giggle in amusement whenever she recites lines which are oh-so-righteous. Child actor Zhu Qi Long (whose biggest screen credit is in Jet Li's Fearless) gives an earnest performance as a kid who, well, just wants to be happy.There are certain sequences which will remind you of other Disney flicks like ""Toy Story"" and ""Dinosaur,"" but of course, not as excitingly rendered and played out as the American versions.

They are obviously trying to take the Chinese made film and make money by throwing a High School Musical voice on it.  To clarify, this is a movie from China with voice overs (which are not done very well at all).  That doesn't ruin the movie but doesn't help.  There are a large number of times when there are signs or labels in Chinese and there is no english subtitle?  That is annoying and detracts from the film which is already in trouble.  The basic story is: a day dreaming/lazy chinese school boy wants all his work done without having to life a finger.  He then walks by his little sister being told a ""fairy tale"" about the magic gourd and falls asleep.  When he ""wakes up"" he goes fishing and catches the magic gourd.  Then shockers of shockers he realizes magic can do more harm than good!  The characters are not likable other than the CGI gourd.  I don't know where the frog on the cover comes in.  He shows up a few times but is not explained or fit into the story.The really disturbing part of this movie is the main character; he is a very bad example.  His parents are non existent and his grandmother is oblivious.  He is constantly running out of school and wanders around town with no supervision or consequences.  He lies, cheats, steals etc.  Now some of this is part of the ""lesson"" about needing to do your own work and not rely on other people/magic, but a lot of it is him.  OVerall, good CGI, fun gourd character then everything else in downhill.

1206692,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001JRB17Y,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[0, 4]","THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a very nice, very sweet family film.  Everyone in my family - my two daughters ages 11  and 3 , my husband, and me - enjoyed this film, each for different reasons.  The wee one was entranced by ""that cute little guy,"" meaning the Magic Gourd.  The 11  year old thought it was a little cheesy, but still liked it enough to watch all the way through with the rest of us.  My husband and I both felt it was a good film for a quiet family evening at home, but it just wasn't anything special.In THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD, Raymond is an 11 year old boy who is not terribly motivated.  He lets his parents down, his teachers down, his friends down.  That is until he discovers the legendary MAGIC GOURD, which will grant his every wish.  Things go well at first, and Raymond impresses all of the people that were previously disappointed in him with his new-found prowess in, well, everything.  But eventually, people start getting hurt, and Raymond comes to realize that reward without hard work is a hollow victory.  In the end, both Raymond and the MAGIC GOURD learn the value of hard work and earning rewards on your own.This film is Disney's first Chinese co-production, and THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a pleasant, cute film.  The problem is that it just isn't anything special.  While the combination of real-life and animation is very well done, and the message that hard work pays off in unexpected ways is an important one, the voice acting, including Corbin Bleu, is lackluster at best, and the dubbing is very out of synch.  There is no excuse for such disappointments in a Disney film.Overall, THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a good choice for a quiet, fun family evening at home.  Younger kids will love it, parents won't hate it, and tweens and teens will tolerate it.

1206693,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B001JRB17Y,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[2, 6]","I watch something like ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" and wonder what possessed someone to bring it over to the states.  There are plenty of great foreign movies that exist.  Most of what we get are made for adults but I have no doubt good family and children films exist outside of the states.  I can't start listing names of which of these films I consider worth bringing over and what aren't because I haven't seen too many of them, but my first impression of ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is that it deserved to be left on the other side of the pond.  This is a harmless but headache inducing film.  It's one of those films where a young boy has dreams of doing something great and one day gets to do that...with a little bit of help of course.The story involves said boy who fishes out a magic gourd one day (voiced in English by ""High School Musical"" supporting character Corbin Bleu) who has the ability to grant wishes.  Likewise the boy wishes for a lot of crazy stuff until some of it makes his life more complicated then it needs to be.  And...there's not a whole lot more to say because this is about as complicated as it gets.  This movie was made by Disney in conjunction with Centro, a Chinese film company.  The history behind the film itself is more interesting then anything in this film.  See, Disney has had a long, troubled history with China.  When Disney released Martin Scorsese's film ""Kundun"" they upset the Chinese government a great deal.The Chinese government, who only lets 20 foreign films into their country each year, made it particularly difficult to crack the market.  This is one of the reasons Disney made ""Mulan,"" to help get on the countries good side again.  Then someone at Disney had the idea if they co-produced a film with a Chinese film company they wouldn't need to fight to get that film on the Chinese market (not a bad idea really).  Thus we now have ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd,"" which is the first in what I expect to be many co-productions between Disney and China.  Obviously the film is not great, but compared to some other Chinese films I've seen this one certainly is very advanced as far as film making is concerned (though by American standards it looks like something you'd see on Cartoon Network).Sadly, though I didn't like the film much I must insist that in the future Disney take better care of the location.  An English dub is fine but the original language track needs to be provided as well (preferably with subtitles).  This is a Chinese production through and through, so it's perplexing that Disney is trying to pass it off as an American film (the cover itself doesn't clue you into the films origins very much).  I know this is for kids and adults likely won't care, but it seems just a tad disrespectful to still be doing this after the ""Princess Mononoke"" fiasco.  At least the bonus music video is in it's original language.  Do I recommend this film?  No.  For a better family Chinese import I'd recommend Stephen Chow's ""CJ7.""  Still, if Disney plans to get serious about their new partnership with China it could lead to some interesting family films in the future.Rating: * Star",1,No Magic Here,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,3164,"['watch', 'something', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'wonder', 'what', 'possessed', 'someone', 'bring', 'states', 'are', 'plenty', 'great', 'foreign', 'movies', 'exist', 'Most', 'what', 'get', 'are', 'made', 'adults', 'have', 'doubt', 'good', 'family', 'children', 'films', 'exist', 'states', 'ca', ""n't"", 'start', 'listing', 'names', 'films', 'consider', 'worth', 'bringing', 'are', ""n't"", 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'first', 'impression', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'deserved', 'be', 'left', 'other', 'side', 'pond', 'harmless', 'headache', 'inducing', 'film', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'dreams', 'doing', 'something', 'great', 'one', 'day', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'help', 'course.The', 'story', 'involves', 'said', 'boy', 'who', 'out', 'magic', 'gourd', 'one', 'day', 'voiced', 'English', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'supporting', 'character', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'who', 'ability', 'grant', 'wishes', 'Likewise', 'boy', 'lot', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'life', 'more', 'complicated', 'then', 'be', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'say', 'about', 'as', 'complicated', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Disney', 'conjunction', 'Centro', 'Chinese', 'film', 'company', 'history', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'anything', 'film', 'See', 'Disney', 'had', 'long', 'troubled', 'history', 'China', 'When', 'Disney', 'released', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'Kundun', 'upset', 'Chinese', 'government', 'great', 'deal.The', 'Chinese', 'government', 'who', 'only', '20', 'foreign', 'films', 'country', 'year', 'made', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'crack', 'market', 'one', 'reasons', 'Disney', 'made', 'Mulan', 'help', 'get', 'countries', 'good', 'side', 'again', 'Then', 'someone', 'Disney', 'had', 'idea', 'co-produced', 'film', 'Chinese', 'film', 'company', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'fight', 'get', 'film', 'Chinese', 'market', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'really', 'now', 'have', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'first', 'what', 'expect', 'be', 'many', 'co-productions', 'Disney', 'China', 'Obviously', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'compared', 'other', 'Chinese', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'certainly', 'very', 'advanced', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'making', 'concerned', 'American', 'standards', 'something', ""'d"", 'see', 'Cartoon', 'Network', '.Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'much', 'must', 'insist', 'future', 'Disney', 'take', 'better', 'care', 'location', 'English', 'dub', 'fine', 'original', 'language', 'track', 'be', 'provided', 'as', 'well', 'preferably', 'subtitles', 'Chinese', 'production', 'perplexing', 'Disney', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'American', 'film', 'cover', ""n't"", 'clue', 'films', 'very', 'much', 'know', 'kids', 'adults', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'just', 'tad', 'disrespectful', 'still', 'be', 'doing', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'fiasco', 'least', 'bonus', 'music', 'video', 'original', 'language', 'Do', 'recommend', 'film', 'No', 'better', 'family', 'Chinese', 'import', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'CJ7', 'Still', 'Disney', 'get', 'serious', 'new', 'partnership', 'China', 'could', 'lead', 'interesting', 'family', 'films', 'future.Rating', '*', 'Star']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd
1206694,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B001JRB17Y,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","Disney has had varied success with their live-action films.  Recent entries like ""The Game Plan,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" and ""Underdog"" have met with varied success.  Older fare such as ""Treasure Island"" and ""Old Yeller"" are looked on as beloved classics by many.  Some of Disney's live-action films (and you could probably include ""Chronicles"" and ""Underdog"" in this group), include animated characters as well.  From ""Mary Poppins"" to ""Pete's Dragon,"" Disney has had reasonable success with these films.What I've noticed with many of the recent live-action Disney films is that they seem to lack the ""spark"" that the classic films had.  While most of them are very good (some quite extraordinary), the childlike magic that once existed in Disney's films seems to be lacking.Thankfully you cannot add to that group ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd.""  It's a Chinese Disney production that features both live-action and animated characters.  It has somehow found the missing spark that I felt had been lost in this modern Disney era.It is based on a book about a young boy who discovers a magic talking gourd that can grant its master any thing he or she might wish for.  The boy, named Raymond, lives his life as easily as he can.  Whether it's skipping homework, sleeping late, or generally just being lazy, Raymond wishes that he could live a relaxed life with none of its consequences.When Raymond ditches school one day to go fishing, he pulls a magical talking gourd out of the lake.  When he learns of the gourd's power, he begins to wish for all sorts of things.  The gourd, called Bailey, is a rather literal being, taking every ""wish"" that Raymond might come up with rather seriously.  This can lead to rather hilarious results.  When Raymond tells his opponent in chess that he'll eat his knight, the gourd makes sure he does.  Other things begin to occur that end up getting Raymond into a ton of trouble (and provide plenty of laughs).Can Raymond ever figure out the lesson that the gourd's wish granting is teaching?  Will he ever realize that the easy way isn't necessarily the best way?  You'll have to watch the DVD to find out.The voice dubbing of the characters features teen Disney Channel star, Corbin Bleu.  He does a wonderful job of making the character his own, including matching up well with the original Mandarin dialogue.Special features include a toy gathering game which is fun for youngsters.  Also included are ""making of"" documentaries, but they are not dubbed and feature only subtitles.  Still, if you can sift through the subtitles, they are rather enjoyable to watch.As stated before, this film captures the ""spark"" of older Disney films.

1206695,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B001JRB17Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There is one thing that really stands out in the fairy tale ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd""--and, thankfully, that is a wonderfully under appreciated gourd. With its crooked grin and sweet, but sad, eyes--our hero struggles to understand the needs and wants of one of the most unappealing movie youths to come around in some time. The gourd (somewhere between a squash and a pumpkin) has a vitality, a humor, and a bizarreness that left me entranced and perplexed. Giving a great, heartfelt performance, this vegetable (technically, I suppose it might be a fruit) pulls out all the dramatic and comedic stops. Its mission in life is to grant wishes to its ""master,"" and although nothing more is ever explained in this fable about the gourd's backstory--I guess you'll either go with it or you won't.The ""master"" in question, however, is a bumbling 11 year old. At first, he seems misunderstood--but as he takes the reins of his own desires, it soon becomes clear how self-involved and truly ungrateful the little brat is! His wishes create havoc and misery for everyone, and he continuously takes his furor out on his new, and only real, friend. The old adage ""Be careful what you wish for..."" has never seemed so true. But our boy never takes responsibility for his own actions, everything is someone else's fault. It becomes grating and irksome--but sit patiently, a big lesson is to be learned.No real consequences, however, ever befall the boy and the film's lesson is cheapened by making the ending so rosy. The boy is embraced by all the students that he has betrayed and cheated--with no real apology. The boy, who made the swim team by cheating, works really hard and competes in the big race. But instead of the message that hard work and ""trying"" are their own reward that should be respected--the boy, instead, wins the race. I guess winning is a better lesson. And watch closely, when the gourd and its master part ways in the end, the closing ""lesson"" and moral introspection is delivered by the GOURD! THE GOURD HAS LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE--NOT THE BOY!Don't get me wrong--I think kids will appreciate the visual appeal of ""Magic Gourd."" The are some nice moments in the visual effects. The gourd provides some genuine whimsy and surely looks delicious. But I don't think ""Magic Gourd"" succeeds as entertainment for the whole family. It's more for the young ones and that's not bad. I just wish the tale had given me a human lead that was half as interesting (or worth caring about) as my dear, dear gourd!

1206696,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B001JRB17Y,Kyle Slayzar,"[3, 4]","Disney has put out some really nice movies in recent years that appeal to a wide audience from Pirates of the Caribbean to it's Pixar films like Wall-E and Monsters Inc.  Best part about such films are their wide appeal to all audiences and not just the traditional child audience.  Films like Toy Story and Miracle dazzled children while adults could sit back and enjoy a film that was made for them too.Enter ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd.""""Magic Gourd"" goes against this tradition in an effort to appeal to children more than adults.  In fact, there was only an instance or two I actually genuinely laughed and it pertained more to the culture clash between Chinese and American culture.  I say this because the entire film is made in China with English subtitles or dub.  Being a hardcore fan of Michael Phelps and everything else US Olympics related I guess I kinda possess a healthy sense of rivalry between my country and China.  That said, it is very hard for me to take the film seriously but more on that later.The premise of the film is very simple.  The protagonist, Raymond, is a very, very, VERY lazy 11-year old that has grandiose dreams and a wild imagination.  While fishing he finds a magical gourd that makes all wishes come true.  Sounds grand right?  Not really, but you'll have to get the film to hear the rest.  The basic moral of the story is that hard work and self-advocacy is more rewarding and fulfilling than having someone do it for you.  It is something I wish more of my countrymen would understand but that's a different debate for a different review (if any).Now, I absolutely loved the landscape filmed.  As an outdoorsman, I found the bamboo woods absolutely breathtaking.  The lake was particularly nice and I can only imagine the kind of fishing they have there.  The computer graphic visuals weren't bad although they were more convincing than what the Chinese did during opening ceremony last summer.  The gourd, which looked more like a piece of... never mind, interacted fairly well with the live action characters and even the environment.Now onto my own personal beefs.First and foremost, this is a movie for children with little consideration for adults.  As a 25-year old male with a love for movies like Red Dawn and Death Wish, this film had very little appeal to me.  Now, before you ask ""Then why did you get it in the first place,"" remember that Disney has spent the last decade and a half trying to appeal to all audiences including adults.  Because of this, you almost get a false sense of marketing from Disney.However, the child appeal will prevail with anyone under the age of 13.  I would recommend this to anyone to parents but don't expect a laugh when you see it.",4,"Great Morals, Beautiful Scenery, Lacks General Appeal",1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,2724,"['Disney', 'put', 'out', 'really', 'nice', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'appeal', 'wide', 'audience', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Pixar', 'films', 'Wall-E', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Best', 'part', 'such', 'films', 'are', 'wide', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'not', 'just', 'traditional', 'child', 'audience', 'Films', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Miracle', 'dazzled', 'children', 'adults', 'could', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'too.Enter', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'tradition', 'effort', 'appeal', 'children', 'more', 'adults', 'fact', 'was', 'only', 'instance', 'two', 'actually', 'genuinely', 'laughed', 'pertained', 'more', 'culture', 'clash', 'Chinese', 'American', 'culture', 'say', 'entire', 'film', 'made', 'China', 'English', 'subtitles', 'dub', 'Being', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Phelps', 'everything', 'else', 'US', 'Olympics', 'related', 'guess', 'kinda', 'possess', 'healthy', 'sense', 'rivalry', 'country', 'China', 'said', 'very', 'hard', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'more', 'later.The', 'premise', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'protagonist', 'Raymond', 'very', 'very', 'VERY', 'lazy', '11-year', 'old', 'grandiose', 'dreams', 'wild', 'imagination', 'fishing', 'magical', 'gourd', 'wishes', 'come', 'true', 'Sounds', 'grand', 'right', 'Not', 'really', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'film', 'hear', 'rest', 'basic', 'moral', 'story', 'hard', 'work', 'self-advocacy', 'more', 'rewarding', 'fulfilling', 'having', 'someone', 'do', 'something', 'wish', 'more', 'countrymen', 'would', 'understand', 'different', 'debate', 'different', 'review', '.Now', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'landscape', 'filmed', 'outdoorsman', 'found', 'bamboo', 'woods', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'lake', 'was', 'particularly', 'nice', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'kind', 'fishing', 'have', 'there', 'computer', 'graphic', 'visuals', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'were', 'more', 'convincing', 'what', 'Chinese', 'did', 'opening', 'ceremony', 'last', 'summer', 'gourd', 'looked', 'more', 'piece', 'never', 'mind', 'interacted', 'fairly', 'well', 'live', 'action', 'characters', 'even', 'environment.Now', 'own', 'personal', 'beefs.First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'children', 'little', 'consideration', 'adults', '25-year', 'old', 'male', 'love', 'movies', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'Death', 'Wish', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'appeal', 'Now', 'ask', 'Then', 'why', 'did', 'get', 'first', 'place', 'remember', 'Disney', 'spent', 'last', 'decade', 'half', 'trying', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'including', 'adults', 'almost', 'get', 'false', 'sense', 'marketing', 'Disney.However', 'child', 'appeal', 'will', 'prevail', 'anyone', 'age', '13', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'laugh', 'when', 'see']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd
1206697,ACH3XM6K1M4AK,B001JRB17Y,L. Jonsson,"[1, 2]","""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is the first collaboration between Walt Disney studios and two prominent Chinese studios, China Film Group and Centro Pictures entertainment.  This film is dubbed in English and has the voice talents of Corbin Bleu from the ""High School Musical"" films. It tells the tale of a good but lazy boy who goes fishing and catches a magic gourd who grants him every wish that he wants.  The gourd is old, wise, but extremely impulsive and grants every wish that Raymond (the main character) asks for with unintentionally hilarious and upsetting results some of the time.  The main theme of the movie, which was based on a best selling kids fantasy book in China, is that a person must earn rewards and praise on their own, and not with anyone else's help.  This is a very good message for kids, because especially nowadays parents unintentionally enable their children to do better when their children should be doing the work themselves.  The special effects are wonderful, the story is easy to follow, it is very family friendly and it is yet another great Disney movie.My kids loved this movie, and were very excited when it came out of the package it was shipped in.  I asked them to help me review it, and the following are some things that I wrote down from what they said in their ""review"":Kyle, age 5: ""I really liked it. My favorite character was the gourd.""Erik, age 7: ""I liked it but I don't know why."" When I asked this son as to what his favorite character was, and his favorite scene in the movie, he said: ""I don't know."" (At Erik's age I get this response a lot).The special features on this DVD include Bloopers, a behind the scenes documentary, one game ""Too Many Toys"" and a music video that is a tie in to the movie in chinese.  The Bloopers are worth the price of the movie alone, except that there are not enough of them.  But that is a very small complaint.  This is a great movie that is a welcome addition to any family movie collection.",5,My kids loved this touching movie!,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,1987,"['Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'first', 'collaboration', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'studios', 'two', 'prominent', 'Chinese', 'studios', 'China', 'Film', 'Group', 'Centro', 'Pictures', 'entertainment', 'film', 'dubbed', 'English', 'voice', 'talents', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'films', 'tale', 'good', 'lazy', 'boy', 'who', 'fishing', 'magic', 'gourd', 'who', 'wish', 'gourd', 'old', 'wise', 'extremely', 'impulsive', 'grants', 'wish', 'Raymond', 'main', 'character', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'upsetting', 'results', 'time', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'kids', 'fantasy', 'book', 'China', 'person', 'must', 'earn', 'rewards', 'praise', 'own', 'not', 'anyone', 'else', 'help', 'very', 'good', 'message', 'kids', 'especially', 'nowadays', 'parents', 'unintentionally', 'enable', 'children', 'do', 'better', 'when', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'work', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'wonderful', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'yet', 'great', 'Disney', 'movie.My', 'kids', 'loved', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'came', 'package', 'was', 'shipped', 'asked', 'help', 'review', 'following', 'are', 'things', 'wrote', 'down', 'what', 'said', 'review', 'Kyle', 'age', '5', 'really', 'liked', 'My', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'gourd', 'Erik', 'age', '7', 'liked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'When', 'asked', 'son', 'what', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Erik', 'age', 'get', 'response', 'lot', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'Bloopers', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'one', 'game', 'Too', 'Many', 'Toys', 'music', 'video', 'tie', 'movie', 'chinese', 'Bloopers', 'are', 'price', 'movie', 'alone', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'very', 'small', 'complaint', 'great', 'movie', 'welcome', 'addition', 'family', 'movie', 'collection']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd

If so, I guess I could understand why...The basic premise is about a kid who constantly daydreams and doesn't get much done (school work, etc.). He wants everything done for him. Enter the ""magic gourd"" capable of granting his every whim.In predictable fashion, he gets everything he wishes for, whether he actually wants it or not. And apparently the gourd is kind of an idiot and keeps screwing up the wishes or fulfilling them in unintended ways. In that way it's kind of like the ""magic genie"" genre, genies being capricious and happy to foul up a wish if you're not careful about how you phrase it.Equally predictably, the poor kid gets tired of the gourd fouling up his life and decides it's better to do his own work and revel in his own accomplishments...To me it felt like a pretty standard story, a bit of a rehash that doesn't do anything particularly new or take many risks. Kids might enjoy it... But there are probably better movies out there? Might be worth a rental for the limited novelty?On the other hand it's kind of nice to see some other culture's attitudes and legends brought to life. Though I think a lot more could have probably been done with it. Say, if it had been made as a period piece rather than being based in a modern school with a kind of hokey plot and equally hokey special effects.Another plus is that it does contain special feature on the ""making of"" and a music video, some interactive games, etc. Again, worth a rental, but I don't know that it'll have any endearing / enduring value.",3,"Only so-so for me...

1206700,A1WXG10FJ353K0,B001JRB17Y,MickeyJoe,"[1, 2]","After viewing this film, the first association I had to my life was the day my Father taught me how to ride a bike.  With training wheels that I thought would never come off, I felt inferior to the other kids in the neighborhood.  I did not believe in myself enough to take the wheels, until my Father said he would simply hold the bike from the back of the seat and run down the street with me. With the wheels off, and my Father behind me, I finally experienced what speed was, instead of wobbling.  It wasn't till I got to the end of the street that I found out my Father was still at the beginning of the street.  I made it all on my own, and promptly fell. After realizing I actually did it, I was able to get the courage to ride the bike back, all the way, bruises and all.It's not exactly the context of the story, however, it is the exact feeling that the film inspires.  Entirely made for personal interpretation, and more importantly, a stepping stone for children to realize they do not have to depend on others.  Be it selfishness, laziness, carelessness or just plain fear.  It goes in many directions.With our main character, Raymond, he is simply a daydreamer.  Spending long hours sleeping, escaping, wandering, in his own world.  He is influenced by his Grandmother who tells a Chinese fairy tale about the secret of the magic gourd which is essentially a genie who will grant every wish.We start the film with Raymond in space, and coming back from a out of this world mission where he is the hero... then he wakes up.  As usual, he gets up late, late for class, late for everything.  Of course, in this daydreaming state of mind, Raymond would never have time for homework.  Therefore, when he goes to math class, he is sure he would never be called to the board... and of course, he is the first that was asked to solve the problem.  He gives up, and then heads to the lake to fish.  It is here that we are introduced by his Granmother's influence, the magice gourd.  I won't tell you how, or many details, but Raymond does come back from the lake with a bucket of goldfish (who will fly in his presence only) ... which is obviously impossible.At this point, we can do whatever we want... even fly.

1206701,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B001JRB17Y,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","A lazy but imaginative 11-year-old boy in China named Raymond discovers a magical, talking, wish-granting gourd named Bailey in Disney's first Chinese co-production, ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"", based on the book by Zhang Tianyi. Raymond sees the enchanted gourd as his easy-ticket through life, and he soon puts Bailey to work helping him catch fish, win swim meets, get into movies, and cheat on his schoolwork. To Raymond's dismay, however, Bailey's help often backfires until he learns to do things for himself and view the gourd as a friend rather than a servant.""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is a colorful family film full of CGI effects and a typical low-budget family film feel. It's a simple fable, and the good points and bad points of the film are easy to pick out. On the bad side, one has a hard time liking Raymond. Until his redemption, he is a pretty crummy kid. Besides that, Bailey the gourd and the other CGI effects look a bit unfinished at times, though this problem is not as frequent as I had anticipated based on things I'd heard. And thirdly, the mishap after mishap course of the film could have done with some more humor or charm as it went through the motions of the fairytale. On the good side, however, there are some fun, imaginative scenes and the overall movie is brightly colored, almost CGI-like itself (though not to the level of something like the recent Speed Racer film), which gives it a visually pleasing quality and helps the weak CGI blend in a bit better. I also can appreciate the simplicity of the story. It's nothing really new, but then again, the cultural aspect makes it different and a simple old fairytale seems rather refreshing nowadays. Overall, it's an entertaining film in a small-scale way and a good start for Disney in this department that I hope they will improve upon (rather than going in the other direction).The DVD is only a single disc, but it has a few bonus features, and one is a lengthy featurette on the film. There are also bloopers, a game, alternate Chinese language tracks, the Fast Play feature, and most enjoyably in my opinion, a music video by an absolutely GORGEOUS singer named Zhang Hanyun (unfortunately, there are no English subtitles for the music video). I find myself giving an extra star for the fine extras of the music video and the making-of featurette, and yes, the DVD is worth buying for the music video alone. Seriously, Zhang Hanyun is jaw-droppingly, stunningly beautiful. But I digress. The film is presented in enhanced widescreen and the English dub features High School Musical's Corbin Bleu as Bailey the Gourd. Personally, I thought he did a fine job with it rather than getting that ""Did they have to use a Disney Channel kid?"" feeling one might expect. Anyway, pick this one up if you are a fan of the Ghibli films. I'm not saying this is as charming and thoughtful as those, but the visuals and simplicity remind me of some of them, so if you love those you may get a bit of enjoyment from ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"". I also suspect this would be a winner with little ones too, but I'm afraid that's something I can't put to the test. Still, what kid doesn't like a story of magical creatures that grant the wishes of children? I know if I could get some wishes out of a gourd, one would be for Zhang Hanyun, ha!",4,"Not outstanding, but enjoyably and imaginative with some great extras!",1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,3330,"['lazy', 'imaginative', '11-year-old', 'boy', 'China', 'named', 'Raymond', 'discovers', 'magical', 'talking', 'wish-granting', 'gourd', 'named', 'Bailey', 'Disney', 'first', 'Chinese', 'co-production', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'based', 'book', 'Zhang', 'Tianyi', 'Raymond', 'enchanted', 'gourd', 'easy-ticket', 'life', 'soon', 'Bailey', 'work', 'helping', 'catch', 'fish', 'win', 'swim', 'meets', 'get', 'movies', 'cheat', 'schoolwork', 'Raymond', 'dismay', 'however', 'Bailey', 'help', 'often', 'do', 'things', 'view', 'gourd', 'friend', 'rather', 'servant', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'colorful', 'family', 'film', 'full', 'CGI', 'effects', 'typical', 'low-budget', 'family', 'film', 'feel', 'simple', 'fable', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'easy', 'pick', 'out', 'bad', 'side', 'one', 'hard', 'time', 'liking', 'Raymond', 'redemption', 'pretty', 'crummy', 'kid', 'Bailey', 'gourd', 'other', 'CGI', 'effects', 'look', 'bit', 'unfinished', 'times', 'problem', 'not', 'as', 'frequent', 'had', 'anticipated', 'based', 'things', ""'d"", 'heard', 'thirdly', 'mishap', 'mishap', 'course', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'humor', 'charm', 'went', 'motions', 'fairytale', 'good', 'side', 'however', 'are', 'fun', 'imaginative', 'scenes', 'overall', 'movie', 'brightly', 'colored', 'almost', 'CGI-like', 'not', 'level', 'something', 'recent', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'film', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'quality', 'weak', 'CGI', 'blend', 'bit', 'better', 'also', 'can', 'appreciate', 'simplicity', 'story', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'then', 'again', 'cultural', 'aspect', 'different', 'simple', 'old', 'fairytale', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'nowadays', 'Overall', 'entertaining', 'film', 'small-scale', 'way', 'good', 'start', 'Disney', 'department', 'hope', 'will', 'improve', 'upon', 'rather', 'going', 'other', 'direction', '.The', 'DVD', 'only', 'single', 'disc', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'one', 'lengthy', 'featurette', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'bloopers', 'game', 'alternate', 'Chinese', 'language', 'tracks', 'Fast', 'Play', 'feature', 'most', 'enjoyably', 'opinion', 'music', 'video', 'absolutely', 'GORGEOUS', 'singer', 'named', 'Zhang', 'Hanyun', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'music', 'video', 'find', 'giving', 'extra', 'star', 'fine', 'extras', 'music', 'video', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'yes', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', 'music', 'video', 'alone', 'Seriously', 'Zhang', 'Hanyun', 'jaw-droppingly', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'digress', 'film', 'presented', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'English', 'dub', 'features', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'Bailey', 'Gourd', 'Personally', 'thought', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'rather', 'getting', 'Did', 'have', 'use', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'kid', 'feeling', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Anyway', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'are', 'fan', 'Ghibli', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'charming', 'thoughtful', 'visuals', 'simplicity', 'remind', 'so', 'love', 'may', 'get', 'bit', 'enjoyment', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'also', 'suspect', 'would', 'be', 'winner', 'little', 'ones', 'too', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'test', 'Still', 'what', 'kid', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'magical', 'creatures', 'grant', 'wishes', 'children', 'know', 'could', 'get', 'wishes', 'gourd', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'Zhang', 'Hanyun', 'ha']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd
1206702,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,B001JRB17Y,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[2, 2]","The Secret of The Magic Gourd is a famous childrens story, written back in the 1950s, that is brought to vivid life by Walt Disney Productions in conjunction with Centro Pictures Entertainment and China Film Group.  It's about a young boy, named Raymond, who has a very vivid imagination but would prefer not to have to work very hard in school to get what he wants.One day, while fishing, Raymond stumbles upon a mysterious creature, named Bailey, who tells Raymond that he can give him anything he wants.  He only needs to ask.  At first it seems like a child's dream come true, with Bailey providing Raymond with all kinds of things, such as food, toy robots, and different kinds of fish.  But Bailey doesn't always understand Raymond's wishes and makes mistakes that ultimately cause Raymond to look bad in front of the other children at school.  In the end, Raymond learns to become more independent and responsible for his own actions, which enables him to be a good son and a much better student.The film took several years to complete, with some very impressive CGI effects that bring Bailey, the magic gourd, and all his amazing abilities to life.  Scenes such as one involving Raymond being chased by a dinosaur in a movie scene that's playing at a local movie theater, comes off quite stunningly.  You can really tell that the years it took to finish the production really paid off.  The message of the film is also a very universal one that will appeal to children all over the world.The problem I had with this US DVD version, lies in the English dubbing of the Mandarin-speaking actors.  It does not fit very well and some of the dialogue is changed in the translation which causes some very awkward moments.  It's almost cartoonish at times, when it shouldn't be.  Happily, the original Mandarin language track (along with another in Cantonese) is also provided on the DVD, which sounds so much more realistic to listen to.  I had a similar experience watchingCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where viewing the film in Mandarin using English subtitles made for a much more enjoyable experience.  Unfortunately, the only English subtitles provided (for the hearing impaired) are for the English-speaking version of the film, so you can never fully understand what the original dialogue, in Mandarin, actually is.  Oddly enough, one of the nicest special features, the ""Making Of"" segment, is completely subtitled due to all the Chinese creator's speaking in their own respective languages.  Raymond's actual Chinese name is Wang Baeo, which you can hear the actor's actually saying in Mandarin for the film, but the English subtitles still say ""Raymond.""  As a result, it's difficult for me to fully recommend this DVD version.Again, the 25 minute ""Making Of"" is quite good and very informative.  You learn the background of the original story and how long it took to make the film and perfect all the effects.  You can really tell that the creators were quite passionate about this work and wanted to produce the best product possible for the audience.  A definite labor of love to be sure.  A short but humorous segment of bloopers is also provided, as well as a music video and a fun little interactive game.  The music video is sung in Mandarin and no English subtitles are provided, but the song is discussed in the ""making of"" segment, which is subtitled and you can read a few lines of the song from there.The film looks great shot with a widescreen aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (enhanced for 16x9 TVs) and the 5.1 Surround is quite good too.  Again, the only real marring is the bad English Dubbing, with no true Mandarin translation of the dialogue in English provided.  This will no doubt irritate some purists and cause them to stay away.The Secret of The Magic GourdRated G, 85 Mins 5.1 Surround SoundEnglish, Mandarin & Cantonese language tracksWidescreen Aspect Ratio 2.35:1English Subtitles For The Hearing Impaired",3,Disney & China's First Big Co-Production Marred By Bad English Dubbing,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,3937,"['Secret', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'famous', 'childrens', 'story', 'written', 'back', '1950s', 'brought', 'vivid', 'life', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Productions', 'conjunction', 'Centro', 'Pictures', 'Entertainment', 'China', 'Film', 'Group', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Raymond', 'who', 'very', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'would', 'prefer', 'not', 'have', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'school', 'get', 'what', 'wants.One', 'day', 'fishing', 'Raymond', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'named', 'Bailey', 'who', 'Raymond', 'can', 'give', 'anything', 'only', 'ask', 'first', 'child', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Bailey', 'providing', 'Raymond', 'kinds', 'things', 'such', 'food', 'toy', 'robots', 'different', 'kinds', 'fish', 'Bailey', ""n't"", 'always', 'understand', 'Raymond', 'wishes', 'mistakes', 'ultimately', 'cause', 'Raymond', 'look', 'bad', 'front', 'other', 'children', 'school', 'end', 'Raymond', 'become', 'more', 'independent', 'responsible', 'own', 'actions', 'be', 'good', 'son', 'much', 'better', 'student.The', 'film', 'took', 'several', 'years', 'complete', 'very', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'effects', 'bring', 'Bailey', 'magic', 'gourd', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'life', 'Scenes', 'such', 'one', 'involving', 'Raymond', 'being', 'chased', 'dinosaur', 'movie', 'scene', 'playing', 'local', 'movie', 'theater', 'quite', 'stunningly', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'years', 'took', 'finish', 'production', 'really', 'paid', 'off', 'message', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'universal', 'one', 'will', 'appeal', 'children', 'world.The', 'problem', 'had', 'US', 'DVD', 'version', 'English', 'dubbing', 'Mandarin-speaking', 'actors', 'not', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'dialogue', 'changed', 'translation', 'very', 'awkward', 'moments', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'times', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'Happily', 'original', 'Mandarin', 'language', 'track', 'Cantonese', 'also', 'provided', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'listen', 'had', 'similar', 'experience', 'watchingCrouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'where', 'viewing', 'film', 'Mandarin', 'using', 'English', 'subtitles', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'English', 'subtitles', 'provided', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'are', 'English-speaking', 'version', 'film', 'can', 'never', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'original', 'dialogue', 'Mandarin', 'actually', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'one', 'nicest', 'special', 'features', 'Making', 'segment', 'completely', 'subtitled', 'due', 'Chinese', 'creator', 'speaking', 'own', 'respective', 'languages', 'Raymond', 'actual', 'Chinese', 'name', 'Wang', 'Baeo', 'can', 'hear', 'actor', 'actually', 'saying', 'Mandarin', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'still', 'say', 'Raymond', 'result', 'difficult', 'fully', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'version.Again', '25', 'minute', 'Making', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'informative', 'learn', 'background', 'original', 'story', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'make', 'film', 'perfect', 'effects', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'creators', 'were', 'quite', 'passionate', 'work', 'wanted', 'produce', 'best', 'product', 'possible', 'audience', 'definite', 'labor', 'love', 'be', 'sure', 'short', 'humorous', 'segment', 'bloopers', 'also', 'provided', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'video', 'fun', 'little', 'interactive', 'game', 'music', 'video', 'sung', 'Mandarin', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'provided', 'song', 'discussed', 'making', 'segment', 'subtitled', 'can', 'read', 'few', 'lines', 'song', 'there.The', 'film', 'great', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'enhanced', '16x9', 'TVs', '5.1', 'Surround', 'quite', 'good', 'too', 'Again', 'only', 'real', 'marring', 'bad', 'English', 'Dubbing', 'true', 'Mandarin', 'translation', 'dialogue', 'English', 'provided', 'will', 'doubt', 'irritate', 'purists', 'cause', 'stay', 'away.The', 'Secret', 'Magic', 'GourdRated', 'G', '85', 'Mins', '5.1', 'Surround', 'SoundEnglish', 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese', 'language', 'tracksWidescreen', 'Aspect', 'Ratio', '2.35:1English', 'Subtitles', 'Hearing', 'Impaired']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd

He's a daydreamer who disappoints his friends, teacher, and parents by not being a ""team player"" and putting his own dreams and desires above the needs of the group. When, out fishing, he finds a magic gourd that grants his every wish, it seems at first to be exactly what he wanted. He learns, though, that effortless success is unsatisfying.The film, a Disney production developed in China and with Chinese filmmakers, looks good and the animation is fun. My kids enjoyed the film a lot, and have seen it a few times. I'd compare it somewhat to Stephen Chow's delightful CJ7 - it has a similar feel, except that CJ7 is (frankly) more inventive and amusing and has a more subtle message. - I was especially interested in the way that standard Disney themes (about the need to see things from another's point of view, to get beyond selfishness, and serve others, to rise to the challenge of taking responsibility for others - think The Aristocats or The Lion King or Freaky Friday or even The Emperor's New Groove), the way these Disney themes would translate into a Chinese context. Surprisingly, they translate very well. There is a greater emphasis in this film on ""group values"" - and when Bao finally decides to give up the gourd it is both because he feels he has hurt his friends and because he wants to take initiative for himself. It is significant (spoiler warning!) that the contest he wins is a team effort, and that the reward for taking initiative is that he is accepted back into the group - upon succeeding on his own terms he is praised by his parents and friends and teacher, all of whom seem to feel that his apparent selfishness has turned out for the best because it has brought honor back to them, to his school and his team and his parents.

Spurned by his classmates for not pulling his weight on the group assignments, Wang Bao wishes that he could get the best grades without ever having to lift one finger.  Hu Lu, the magic gourd, overhears his wish and decides to serve the little boy. However, the gourd's enthusiasm and eagerness to grant the boy's every wish is matched by his little understanding of the human tendency to speak figuratively. And so as Hu Lu misunderstands the intention behind the words but still grants Wang Bao's wishes, the boy finds himself, instead, in trouble or embarrassed in front the very people he wants to impress. The irony is that the more Hu Lu tries to make things easier for his master, the more Wang Bao realizes that true satisfaction and respect comes from achievement and from working hard toward his goalsI watched this movie in Cantonese so that my mother would be able to enjoy it too while I followed the English subtitles.  Even with my limited knowledge of Cantonese, I could tell that the translation was not literal.  What I found funny was that Hu Lu is a character incapable of understanding figures of speech yet in the English subtitles he is uttering expressions such as ""What a cow!""  The English-dubbed version is all right but I'd rather watch this film with its original language track on.As to the animation (by Hong Kong Centro Digital Pictures), it is not going to blow your mind away, but it is not cheap-looking either.

1206709,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,B001JRB17Y,"R. C. Walker ""catu11us""","[0, 6]","This film is a Disney product.  It's cutsey, kitschy, full of small ... yech ... children, and partly animated.  The only problem is that it's cutsey to the max, kitschier than ""Leave It to Beaver"", and the animation!  ...well, the animation's OK, I guess.The ""Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is that it's awful.  There certainly isn't any other secret, because what the magic gourd does is telegraphed to you right up front, and the appearance in the narrative is even less of a surprise than the appearance of an E.T. in ""E.T."".  About the only surprise in the whole thing is that the M.G.'s finger doesn't light up.  Imagine the Disney imagineers forgetting that!The gist of S.o.t.M.G. is that there is a Magic Gourd (yeah, OK, so?) and it will grant you your every wish.  Gourds are singularly unattractive objects (despite the opinions of deluded people who use them as decorations).  Why not a genie?  Disney does great genies.  But no.  We get a yellow gourd with big eyes and an off-side mouth.  A yellow gourd that ... well, here comes the plot.Raymond Bao is your typical 11-year-old boy.  He's Chinese, which makes him statistically typical.  He's lazy and not interested in doing what it takes to be successful at whatever school wants him to do.  He's heard the story of the Magic Gourd and of course wants to find it.  As things turn out, it finds him.Gourds are, as you will recall, basically hollow.  This one is no exception, especially in the upper part, where the brains ought to be.  It therefore never thinks wishes through, but grants them very literally, including brainless (of course) speculations as to what ""master"" really wants.The results are naturally disastrous.  Over and over and over ... and OVER ... again.  You would certainly think somebody would catch on.  The audience ought to right away, but most of reviews of this film seem to indicate a gourd-like quality in the reviewers.  The gourd seems to have caught on in the end, sort of.  Raymond catches on at last and gets rid of the gourd.  He then actually works for a goal (winning a track meet), which of course he does because this is a Disney film.  Not for Disney the moral complexity and ambiguity of trying to explain how it's all right to practice your guts out and still not quite make it.I'm sure some of you are waiting for the other bits like subplots, subtexts, secondary plots, or anything to make this more than a very long 8-minute cartoon.  Actually, ""Magic Gourd"" is even less complex than an 8-minute cartoon.  Animated humor for children is most successful when it aims some of its content toward adult viewers.  Adults need not apply here.What we have here is a film that's got a moral point to hammer home, and hammer it does - so much so that even the most retarded 3-year-old will get the point by the time the story's half-way done.  This klutzy production has nothing on its ... um, ... mind but beating its little viewers about their collective heads with a single point.  The lack of variety is positively stultifying.  I was riveted to my seat with boredom.  Any child with half a brain would be, too - I would hope.  Nobody, however immature, should be subjected to this nursery rhyme gone mad.On the other hand, I can see how children might actually like things like this.  The results from our schools indicate that the little troglodytes flee from mental challenges, despise learning, and are generally less attractive than the pre-Gourd Raymond Bao.  This sort of explains why, for instance, the study of evolution is so unpopular in intellectually challenged areas such as the inbred South and the Midwest.  It's so complicated and hard to understand - like long division.  It's so much easier to believe that some Magic Gourd in the sky made everything.You can, if you wish, inflict this simplistic film on your children, in between episodes of Barney, Yu-Gi-Oh, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, and other mind-rotting fare.

1206712,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B001JRB17Y,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[0, 0]","This is a movie by Walt Disney but is a bit different from the proverbial film that Disney produces.  This is mainly due to the fact that this movie was released by the Chinese film company Centro in 2007 and then just recently released here in the United States by Walt Disney (in partnership with Centro) in 2009.This movie is about a young boy named Raymond.  Raymond struggles with being a perfect person.  These grapples with perfection mainly gravitate towards school achievements and making his family proud of him. One day Raymond is fishing and isn't having any luck catching fish.  He wishes he could catch some fish and this is when he meets Bailey the magic gourd.  When Bailey introduces himself to Raymond and tells him who he is, Raymond doesn't believe him.  Raymond has heard the myth of the magic gourd growing up from his grandmother and believes it is hogwash.  A magic gourd is basically an enchanting creature that is able to make a wish come true.Now Bailey tells Raymond to give him a chance to prove that he is in fact the magic gourd.  After a dramatic exercise of Bailey's abilities, Raymond is now a believer and wants this magic gourds help.  However as the movie progresses, Raymond discovers that his wishes come with unexpected consequences.  For instance, Raymond wants to pass his math test.  So Bailey copies another student's test and puts the answers on Raymond's paper, which makes it appear that Raymond was cheating.  Some of these situations lead to both heartwarming and funny situations.This movie is saturated with CGI (computer generated/graphic images) which would normally bother me, but in this case it just added a surreal element to the film.  I also feel this movie has a great moral, which is honesty; hard work, working together and respect go a long way.  These are great messages for children (and some adults).  The movie doesn't have any bad language and there is some action/violence.  This action/violence that is very minor and so over the top that it (hopefully) will be more exciting than scary.As formerly noted, this was a Chinese movie and was released later in the United States.  This means that the movie is dubbed in English.  I find that most movies that are dubbed can be somewhat difficult to watch and/or taken seriously.  In contrast, I adjusted to this dubbing quickly in this film and it really didn't bother me.  Bailey is a computer generated image so his voice dubbing wasn't a problem at all.  All the voice acting was pretty good.  Corbin Bleu (High School Musical series) provides Bailey's voice and he does a pretty good job.The DVD provides a bunch of features and previews for other Disney movies about to be released and/or re-released on DVD. I found this movie to be enjoyable and I am an adult.  I am sure children would also like this film.  Since this movie wasn't made in America, it has a different flavor, this is a good thing.  Not only will this movie provide entertainment, it will provide children an insight to some Chinese culture.As for the magic gourd Bailey, I found him to be a cute and funny character that happens to look just like a butternut squash!",4,Bailey: butternut squash or magic gourd?,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,3157,"['movie', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'bit', 'different', 'proverbial', 'film', 'Disney', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Chinese', 'film', 'company', 'Centro', '2007', 'then', 'just', 'recently', 'released', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'partnership', 'Centro', '2009.This', 'movie', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Raymond', 'Raymond', 'being', 'perfect', 'person', 'grapples', 'perfection', 'mainly', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'school', 'achievements', 'making', 'family', 'proud', 'One', 'day', 'Raymond', 'fishing', ""n't"", 'having', 'luck', 'catching', 'fish', 'could', 'catch', 'fish', 'when', 'Bailey', 'magic', 'gourd', 'When', 'Bailey', 'Raymond', 'who', 'Raymond', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Raymond', 'heard', 'myth', 'magic', 'gourd', 'growing', 'up', 'grandmother', 'hogwash', 'magic', 'gourd', 'basically', 'enchanting', 'creature', 'able', 'make', 'wish', 'come', 'true.Now', 'Bailey', 'Raymond', 'give', 'chance', 'prove', 'fact', 'magic', 'gourd', 'dramatic', 'exercise', 'Bailey', 'abilities', 'Raymond', 'now', 'believer', 'magic', 'gourds', 'help', 'However', 'movie', 'Raymond', 'wishes', 'come', 'unexpected', 'consequences', 'instance', 'Raymond', 'pass', 'math', 'test', 'So', 'Bailey', 'copies', 'student', 'test', 'answers', 'Raymond', 'paper', 'appear', 'Raymond', 'was', 'cheating', 'situations', 'lead', 'heartwarming', 'funny', 'situations.This', 'movie', 'saturated', 'CGI', 'computer', 'generated/graphic', 'images', 'would', 'normally', 'bother', 'case', 'just', 'added', 'surreal', 'element', 'film', 'also', 'feel', 'movie', 'great', 'moral', 'honesty', 'hard', 'work', 'working', 'together', 'respect', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'are', 'great', 'messages', 'children', 'adults', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'language', 'action/violence', 'action/violence', 'very', 'minor', 'so', 'top', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'exciting', 'scary.As', 'formerly', 'noted', 'was', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'later', 'United', 'States', 'movie', 'dubbed', 'English', 'find', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'dubbed', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'watch', 'and/or', 'taken', 'seriously', 'contrast', 'adjusted', 'dubbing', 'quickly', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Bailey', 'computer', 'generated', 'image', 'so', 'voice', 'dubbing', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'series', 'Bailey', 'voice', 'pretty', 'good', 'job.The', 'DVD', 'bunch', 'features', 'previews', 'other', 'Disney', 'movies', 'be', 'released', 'and/or', 're-released', 'DVD', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'am', 'adult', 'am', 'sure', 'children', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'film', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'America', 'different', 'flavor', 'good', 'thing', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'movie', 'provide', 'entertainment', 'will', 'provide', 'children', 'insight', 'Chinese', 'culture.As', 'magic', 'gourd', 'Bailey', 'found', 'be', 'cute', 'funny', 'character', 'look', 'just', 'butternut', 'squash']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd

The only way for him to do this is to do it himself and not rely on the gourd to do everything for him.This film might work well for parents of young children, as they can use it as a tool for teaching their children the value of hard work and responsibility, but I don't see it being very entertaining for kids over the age of 10 or so.  My 11-year-old son watched it with me and wasn't thrilled with it, and he isn't terribly picky when it comes to movies.  The movie is, for the most part, overly sentimental and a tiny bit heavy handed on the morality.The movie was made for Chinese audiences and is based on a Chinese children's story, so it might not resonate with American audiences. Your average American 11-year-old kid might not even know what a gourd is and it will probably seem like a strange choice for a main character.  With this said, the movie was made for a Chinese audience, so this was exactly what the movie was supposed to be.The acting is slightly sub-par, even for your standard kid's movie, with no standout performances from any of the cast.  I watched it with the dubbed soundtrack, so I am not sure if the original Chinese voices were more inspired, but the voice acting wasn't anything special.The computer animation is passable, but definitely not the greatest you will see.  Some of the CG characters look much better than others, such as the dinosaur in the movie theater.

Along comes a ""magic gourd"" to help fulfill his wishes.  The problem is, some of the things the boy wishes for (or the gourd perceives the boy wants), are taken from someone or somewhere else - not magically appearing.  The boy, Raymond (""Wang Bao"" in the Chinese version), has a lot of adventures getting to fly and all of and being chased by a movie dinosaur that but he finds he spends more time trying to undo the things that the Magic Gourd (""Bailey"" - US version, Hulu or Bao Hulu in the Chinese version) does.  Raymond does say he is sorry to those who he has wronged - especially at the end of the movie.  I do not feel this is a bad young man - he just has some lessons to learn - which he does.This movie was completed in 2007.  It is the first animated film that is a joint production of China and Disney: made by China Group Corporation and Hong Kong Centro Digital.  The US production is directed by Rick Dempsey who also did the English language adaptation. Per the featurette the movie took 4 years to get the script (the original book was written in the fifties), 2 years to film and edit. It took 140 animators 1 year to do the animation.The feature movie lasts 85 minutes and has a 30 minute featurette, Behind the Scenes of the Gourd (in Mandarin Chinese but with excellent subtitles), and the original theme song sung by ""Baby Zhang"" (Zhang Hanyun) in a very cute music video - also in Mandarin Chinese with Chinese characters subtitled.  The song and lyrics were adapted to English and sung by Megan Hilty for the US DVD release (1/27/09).  She also does the voice for Ms. Lee (Ms. Liu in the Chinese version).  There are also ""bloopers"" and a simple interactive game to play.The movie is available in English (with subtitles if wished), Mandarin and Cantonese language tracks.  When I watched the Behind the Scenes featurette, the Chinese directors, music director, actors, etc. talked about the various aspects of making the film.  It was nice to see and hear the actor who did the original voice for the Gourd, Cheng Peisi, who has also played protagonists (voice) for other Disney animated films.  If you watch the movie with the Mandarin Chinese soundtrack, you will hear the original Chinese actors' voices.The voices for the U.S production are Corbin Bleu - Magic Gourd, Megan Hilty as Ms. Lee, Takayo Fischer as Grandma, Drake Johnston as Raymond, etc.  The Chinese actors and voices are Gigi Lueng as Ms. Liu (Ms. Lee - Teacher), Zhu Qi Long as Wang Bao (Raymond in the US version),  Zheng Jia Hao, Wang Ji Kun, Lao Yi Jia and many others.  The movie was filmed in the city of Hangzhou, China.FYI:The DVD is available with a FAST PLAY feature where it plays all the way through for young children who just have to put the DVD into the player OR you can go to the Main Menu for the normal set up of language, subtitles, extra features, etc.  This is explained as soon as you press Menu on your DVD player once the DVD is read and starts playing.",4,Chinese-US Disney Project Very Good Family Movie,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,3472,"['movie', 'excellent', 'animation', 'combined', 'live', 'action', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'only', 'short', 'section', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'attention', 'better', 'families', 'children', 'toddlers', 'pre-teens', 'older.The', 'story', 'boy', 'who', 'lackadaisical', 'doing', 'homework', 'working', 'schoolmate', 'team', 'getting', 'up', 'school', 'time', 'taking', 'care', 'personal', 'grooming', 'etc', 'could', 'have', 'what', 'having', 'lift', 'finger', 'magic', 'gourd', 'help', 'fulfill', 'wishes', 'problem', 'things', 'boy', 'wishes', 'gourd', 'boy', 'are', 'taken', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'else', 'not', 'magically', 'appearing', 'boy', 'Raymond', 'Wang', 'Bao', 'Chinese', 'version', 'lot', 'adventures', 'getting', 'fly', 'being', 'chased', 'movie', 'dinosaur', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'undo', 'things', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'Bailey', 'US', 'version', 'Hulu', 'Bao', 'Hulu', 'Chinese', 'version', 'Raymond', 'say', 'sorry', 'who', 'wronged', 'especially', 'end', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'bad', 'young', 'man', 'just', 'lessons', 'learn', 'does.This', 'movie', 'was', 'completed', '2007', 'first', 'animated', 'film', 'joint', 'production', 'China', 'Disney', 'made', 'China', 'Group', 'Corporation', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Centro', 'Digital', 'US', 'production', 'directed', 'Rick', 'Dempsey', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'English', 'language', 'adaptation', 'featurette', 'movie', 'took', '4', 'years', 'get', 'script', 'original', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'fifties', '2', 'years', 'film', 'edit', 'took', '140', 'animators', '1', 'year', 'do', 'animation.The', 'feature', 'movie', '85', 'minutes', '30', 'minute', 'featurette', 'Scenes', 'Gourd', 'Mandarin', 'Chinese', 'excellent', 'subtitles', 'original', 'theme', 'song', 'sung', 'Baby', 'Zhang', 'Zhang', 'Hanyun', 'very', 'cute', 'music', 'video', 'also', 'Mandarin', 'Chinese', 'Chinese', 'characters', 'subtitled', 'song', 'lyrics', 'were', 'adapted', 'English', 'sung', 'Megan', 'Hilty', 'US', 'DVD', 'release', '1/27/09', 'also', 'voice', 'Ms.', 'Lee', 'Ms.', 'Liu', 'Chinese', 'version', 'are', 'also', 'bloopers', 'simple', 'interactive', 'game', 'play.The', 'movie', 'available', 'English', 'subtitles', 'wished', 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese', 'language', 'tracks', 'When', 'watched', 'Behind', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'Chinese', 'directors', 'music', 'director', 'actors', 'etc', 'talked', 'various', 'aspects', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'hear', 'actor', 'who', 'did', 'original', 'voice', 'Gourd', 'Cheng', 'Peisi', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'protagonists', 'voice', 'other', 'Disney', 'animated', 'films', 'watch', 'movie', 'Mandarin', 'Chinese', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'hear', 'original', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'voices.The', 'voices', 'U.S', 'production', 'are', 'Corbin', 'Bleu', 'Magic', 'Gourd', 'Megan', 'Hilty', 'Ms.', 'Lee', 'Takayo', 'Fischer', 'Grandma', 'Drake', 'Johnston', 'Raymond', 'etc', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'voices', 'are', 'Gigi', 'Lueng', 'Ms.', 'Liu', 'Ms.', 'Lee', 'Teacher', 'Zhu', 'Qi', 'Long', 'Wang', 'Bao', 'Raymond', 'US', 'version', 'Zheng', 'Jia', 'Hao', 'Wang', 'Ji', 'Kun', 'Lao', 'Yi', 'Jia', 'many', 'others', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'city', 'Hangzhou', 'China.FYI', 'DVD', 'available', 'FAST', 'PLAY', 'feature', 'where', 'way', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'OR', 'can', 'go', 'Main', 'Menu', 'normal', 'set', 'language', 'subtitles', 'extra', 'features', 'etc', 'explained', 'as', 'soon', 'press', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'player', 'once', 'DVD', 'read', 'playing']",The Secret of the Magic Gourd

I feel it would have worked better if instead of using western voices and western names of people and the gourd that Disney would have used oriental people who could speak english and also used oriental names. Thank goodness Mulan was not westernized like this one was. I also don't understand the fixation on toe nail clipping. That was brought up 3 times in this movie.  A very forgetable story but maybe it is a great story in China however I don't feel it will play in America.  If you don't want to be disappointed then skip this one. Also, why are these 11 year olds protrayed with such higher intelligence.

1206716,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001JRB17Y,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 3]","Woopak is reviewing a family flick?? No, it can`t be.....Well, every once in awhile, one needs a change of pace so please bear with me when I review this family-friendly flick. ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is adapted from the Chinese original short story by Zhang Tian Yi and is now produced under the Disney flag. Just what is a gourd? A gourd is any of the several trailing or climbing plants related to the pumpkin, squash and cucumber and bearing fruits with a hard rind. This film offers nothing new, and is a cardboard cut-out of a family film; blending magical elements and a ""coming of age"" tale. Nope, it isn't going to win any awards, and I think it is meant to be this way--it is your usual run-of-the-mill kid flick with a very simple story so it can easily connect with kids. Adults may find it corny but kids may find it a little charming with a predictable message that may prove quite invaluable.Raymond is an inquisitive kid who likes doing things the easy way, he is lazy. He discovers a magical, mythical gourd while fishing one day after school. This magical talking gourd calls himself ""Bailey"" and it grant Raymond's every wish. Things seem to be looking up for young Raymond, but whenever Bailey tries to grant his wish, the results aren't to his liking most of the time--Raymond's world is turned upside down.Now, I have to admit, I am not a fan of kid flicks but I also have to acknowledge that these films do have their charm to parents and children. This film does everything straight-forward, and don't expect a film in the caliber of ""Bridge to Terabithia"" or ""Zathura"". ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" is a low budget affair, with the use of decent CGI, studio-quality set designs and a very simple story. Yes, it does very little to involve or connect with the adult mind and honestly, it may prove a little annoying at times. The film does have its charm, and kids will no doubt have no issues understanding what it is trying to say. It uses cheeky humor, sub-par special effects (the frog looks related to the gecko in the Geico insurance commercials) and to be frank, I wasn't impressed at all with the film's quality.However, the film does give a good opening for mothers to talk to their 8-10 year old kids to work hard, and that magic is not needed to achieve success at school--the greatest magical feeling can be had from the simplest things, and success through hard work is more fulfilling. Bailey has all the willingness to aid his youthful master, but it never works out to his liking most of the time. I supposed this is also a commentary with parents occasional disconnections with their kids, and that parents shouldn't always bail their kids out of their troubles. It is invaluable for growing kids to make mistakes, this is how they grow and mature.While I have to admit that I found some parts of the film amusing; Bailey's innocence, his attempts to grant Raymond's desires through his magic is so without responsibility, that usually results in ironically, humorous sequences. Toys coming alive seemed ""borrowed"" from Pixar's ""Toy Story"" and some parts of it does seem ""cute"" but borders dangerously close to becoming an annoyance. The film's problems arise when it doesn't make any valid attempts to connect the viewer to its story, the relationship between Raymond and Bailey is given very little opportunity is breathe. There is enormous potential for a ""genie"" and a lazy boy premise with the easy fix and hard work twist; but the film felt too rushed to realize its promise. The lead actor performed competently enough, but he had very little to work with.The secret to making a great family film is to keep young minds amazed and busy; while the adults keep interest and doesn`t mind the ""cuteness"". Even myths and magic have to have a set of rules to keep the story grounded and this film doesn't make any such attempts in presenting an intriguing complication. Its strong bits of ""not needing magic and true magic is achieved from hard work"" may have charm but it didn't establish a heart and soul in its proceedings.Ultimately, ""The Secret of the Magic Gourd"" isn't so bad as long as one remembers what he is watching; but it pales in comparison with Disney's or Pixar's other offerings. It carries some energy and very little momentum, the film isn't anything special and definitely isn't that creative. Kids will find ""Bailey the Gourd"" mildly interesting, (they love ""Barney"") but the entire family is better off watching something else for ""movie night"".RENTAL [2  Stars = mediocre]Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Pretty much your usual transfer, colors are nice and offers some texture. It has the look of a film. I opted to view the film in the original 5.1 Dolby Digital Mandarin track which was very clear and strong. The subtitles were badly timed at times, unfortunately.Extras: Making of/interactive match-up game/music video/ coming attractions",3,"Be CAREFUL what YOU Wish For, You Just Might Get
