I have watched this dvd several times with pleasure.I enjoyed their mini biographies, the rehearsals, and the ballet created for them, the music as well as the choreography.Fifty years ago there were very few male dancers, great, good, or even mediocre. Today, they seem to be coming up at a steady rate, but these four are at the top of their class.",5,Sheer enjoyment!,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,484,"['extraordinary', 'male', 'dancers', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'dancing', 'utmost', 'therefore', 'communicate', 'enjoyment', 'viewer', 'have', 'watched', 'dvd', 'several', 'times', 'pleasure.I', 'enjoyed', 'mini', 'biographies', 'rehearsals', 'ballet', 'created', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'choreography.Fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'male', 'dancers', 'great', 'good', 'even', 'mediocre', 'Today', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'up', 'steady', 'rate', 'four', 'are', 'top', 'class']",N/A

809625,AI4E5IFOT4QER,B0001L3LWW,James M. Shertzer,"[4, 5]","Originally made in 2004 for PBS' ""Dance In America"" series, this 58-minute documentary intertwines the personal stories of American Ballet Theater's reigning danseurs with the creation of a Mark Morris ballet showcasing their abundant talents. Although they come from very different backgrounds (from the Ukraine, Cuba, Spain and the US) and training, their stories are a testament to their passion for dance and debt to Baryshinov. The personal stories go to lengths to establish them as ""regular"" guys (Ethan Stiefel seems 'married' to his Harley Davidson) but the film include great footage of these dancers early years and triumphs and interesting comments from the teachers and parents whose sacrifices paved their way for their sons' successes. The brief Morris ballet (to Schumann) is an apt and joyful conclusion.",3,Pleasing overview of four great male performers,1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,821,"['Originally', 'made', '2004', 'PBS', 'Dance', 'America', 'series', '58-minute', 'documentary', 'intertwines', 'personal', 'stories', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theater', 'reigning', 'danseurs', 'creation', 'Mark', 'Morris', 'ballet', 'showcasing', 'abundant', 'talents', 'come', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Ukraine', 'Cuba', 'Spain', 'US', 'training', 'stories', 'are', 'testament', 'passion', 'dance', 'debt', 'Baryshinov', 'personal', 'stories', 'go', 'lengths', 'establish', 'regular', 'guys', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', ""'married"", 'Harley', 'Davidson', 'film', 'include', 'great', 'footage', 'dancers', 'early', 'years', 'triumphs', 'interesting', 'comments', 'teachers', 'parents', 'sacrifices', 'paved', 'way', 'sons', 'successes', 'brief', 'Morris', 'ballet', 'Schumann', 'apt', 'joyful', 'conclusion']",N/A
809626,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,B0001L3LWW,R. Nicholson,"[38, 40]","I must admit to some disappointment in this DVD; not because of the quality of the content but rather the content itself.  Also, this disc is short, very short...only 54 minutes in factThis DVD features four of the male stars of todays American Ballet Theatre: That being, Jose Manuel Carreno (Cuba), Angel Corella (Spain), Vladimir Malakhov (Russia) and Ethan Stiefel (USA).I'd expected some extended video of each of the dancers actually dancing, but instead the bulk of the video is more of less a mini biography of each of the dancers with brief snippets of each of them from  previous shows they were in.There is also an extended section showing them rehearsing a dance, a pas de quatre, danced to Scubert's piano quintet; the finished work is about 7 minutes long and shown at the very end of the disc.  This was well done and performed before a live audience.I think the highlight of this disc, to me, was a short segment of each of them on a trampoline, with a single photograph frame capturing some spectacular aerial pose at the apex of their leaps. Unbelievable height and agility.All in all, not quite what I expected when I purchased this DVD. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy it, I did, (getting some insight on the lives of these fabulously talented individual was very interesting,  but it's just not something that I'd probably watch more than once. And watching some of my favorite choreographed dances is something that I do watch on a regular and repeated basis.",4,Short and more biography than actual dancing,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,1488,"['must', 'admit', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'not', 'quality', 'content', 'rather', 'content', 'Also', 'disc', 'short', 'very', 'short', 'only', '54', 'minutes', 'factThis', 'DVD', 'four', 'male', 'stars', 'todays', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theatre', 'being', 'Jose', 'Manuel', 'Carreno', 'Cuba', 'Angel', 'Corella', 'Spain', 'Vladimir', 'Malakhov', 'Russia', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'USA', '.I', ""'d"", 'expected', 'extended', 'video', 'dancers', 'actually', 'dancing', 'instead', 'bulk', 'video', 'more', 'less', 'mini', 'biography', 'dancers', 'brief', 'snippets', 'previous', 'shows', 'were', 'in.There', 'also', 'extended', 'section', 'showing', 'rehearsing', 'dance', 'pas', 'quatre', 'danced', 'Scubert', 'piano', 'quintet', 'finished', 'work', '7', 'minutes', 'long', 'shown', 'very', 'end', 'disc', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'performed', 'live', 'audience.I', 'think', 'highlight', 'disc', 'was', 'short', 'segment', 'trampoline', 'single', 'photograph', 'frame', 'capturing', 'spectacular', 'aerial', 'pose', 'apex', 'leaps', 'Unbelievable', 'height', 'agility.All', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'expected', 'when', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'did', 'getting', 'insight', 'lives', 'fabulously', 'talented', 'individual', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'just', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'probably', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'watching', 'favorite', 'choreographed', 'dances', 'something', 'do', 'watch', 'regular', 'repeated', 'basis']",N/A

I know Corella is the current hearthrob of ABT, and though he's a great dancer, and very handsome in a young-man, open-faced way, the standout for me by far was Carreno, who is a very strong and masculine Cuban-born dancer with a stage presence that can't be denied, even though he never resorts to be mugging to the audience for approval. He's an incredibly powerful dancer, and my oh my, he's built like a god. He reminds me in his bearing of the great, if underappreciated, Fernando Bujones.The last time I saw a live performance by this company, Kevin McKenzie was still dancing (he was good, too! Don't listen to what he says!). So I have been out of it. ABT has definitely BROUGHT it in the last few years.I'm really happy to see anything that is good for ballet. And this is definitely more than good.Valodia, the catlike dancer from the Ukraine, tells the sad story of his lonely childhood at ballet school alone in Russia, and of his mother, who did without to pay for his room and board (as a dancer from the Ukraine, he was apparently considered a second-class citizen by the Bolshoi School administration, and he didn't get the same perks Russian dancers got for free).After being denied a place in the Bolshoi Ballet upon graduation, he went out on his own and won two big competitions. At that point the Bolshoi vouchsafed to make him an offer, whereupon Valodia told them that it was too late (which must have been sweet). The Bolshoi's loss is our gain. I've never seen any male dancer with the flexibility and a three-dimensional way of moving that this dancer has.There are a lot of non-dance moments, but there is enough dance to make this definitely worth seeing.",5,Lock up your dancing daughters,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,1769,"['men', 'are', 'just', 'splendid', 'what', 'dancers', 'physical', 'training', 'come', 'so', 'far', 'know', 'Corella', 'current', 'hearthrob', 'ABT', 'great', 'dancer', 'very', 'handsome', 'young-man', 'open-faced', 'way', 'standout', 'far', 'was', 'Carreno', 'who', 'very', 'strong', 'masculine', 'Cuban-born', 'dancer', 'stage', 'presence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'even', 'never', 'be', 'mugging', 'audience', 'approval', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'dancer', 'oh', 'built', 'god', 'bearing', 'great', 'underappreciated', 'Fernando', 'Bujones.The', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'live', 'performance', 'company', 'Kevin', 'McKenzie', 'was', 'still', 'dancing', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'what', 'So', 'have', 'been', 'ABT', 'definitely', 'BROUGHT', 'last', 'few', 'years.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'happy', 'see', 'anything', 'good', 'ballet', 'definitely', 'more', 'good.Valodia', 'catlike', 'dancer', 'Ukraine', 'sad', 'story', 'lonely', 'childhood', 'ballet', 'school', 'alone', 'Russia', 'mother', 'who', 'did', 'pay', 'room', 'board', 'dancer', 'Ukraine', 'was', 'apparently', 'considered', 'second-class', 'citizen', 'Bolshoi', 'School', 'administration', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'perks', 'Russian', 'dancers', 'got', 'free', '.After', 'being', 'denied', 'place', 'Bolshoi', 'Ballet', 'graduation', 'went', 'out', 'own', 'won', 'two', 'big', 'competitions', 'point', 'Bolshoi', 'vouchsafed', 'make', 'offer', 'Valodia', 'told', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'sweet', 'Bolshoi', 'loss', 'gain', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'male', 'dancer', 'flexibility', 'three-dimensional', 'way', 'moving', 'dancer', 'are', 'lot', 'non-dance', 'moments', 'enough', 'dance', 'make', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
