1540780,ASEMV95I6RNXD,B0080QOL10,AP,"[6, 10]","When you see a movie collection with Colin Firth, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett on the front cover (plus Hugh Grant, Jeremy Northam, etc.), you just assume it will be good. Well, it isn't. It's marketing. I already owned an Ideal Husband (on VHS) so saw it was in this DVD collection and assumed the other films would be similar quality. They are not. I own almost every Jane Austen and period movie ever made and love that genre and usually love British cinema, BBC, etc.; however, the only good films out of this 8-movie collection are An Ideal Husband (excellent, 4.5 stars, really fun movie about politics, love, forgiveness, second chances, etc.) and Her Majesty Mrs. Brown (3.5 stars) about Queen Victoria mourning her husband's loss and the Scottish servant who helps her move past her loss. I also found Restoration very moving/poignant. However, I couldn't even get through the rest of the films -- A Month by the Lake was incredibly boring and pointless with Vanessa Redgrave as an older lady chasing an older man who was flirting with a young nanny (Uma Thurman) and the same basic thing kept happening over and over again -- I had to force myself to watch it. My Life So Far was crass, with an awful performance by Colin Firth as a second-rate, eccentric husband flirting with his brother's wife while his young son looks at naked lady pictures. The Englishman who went up the Hill is okay (3 stars) as it's kind of interesting that a town would put dirt on a hill so it gets taller and can be called a mountain, but most of these movies aren't even the kind I would watch if they were on TV (definitely wouldn't buy or watch again). I haven't watched the others yet -- Sweet Revenge or Tom & VIV, so maybe one of those will be good but I'm not expecting much. So far, only 3 of the 8 were worth having. At the price, it's worth buying the set only for An Ideal Husband and Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown (plus Restoration was good) unless you can get An Ideal Husband by itself for less.

It is amazing no matter how science can prove hill is not a mountain those who believe in the mountain tried to make it so.My fav - An Ideal Husband.  Although I love Jeremy Northam you have to admit the interaction between Minnie Drive and Rupert Everett was fun to watch.  In the middle of all the misunderstandings and intrigue, these two find a way to co-exist.Sweet Revenge was way too out there but it was a little humorous while being dastardly.  I enjoy watching Helena Bonham Carter but it took some time to get into the movie because of her outlandishness.Dame Judi Dench is a marvelous actress and this movie, &#34;Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown&#34;, was so spectacular.  There are times in our life when we need a friend, not just tea, sympathy and a pat on the head.  No matter if you are a queen or horseman, there are times that try your very reason for living.  Judi Dench was absolutely real and marvelous in her role of Queen Victoria.T.S Eliot is a favorite poet.  Tom & Viv was masterfully portrayed and so realistic that I felt that I really had a peek at what they must have been going through.  I have a renewed interest in re-reading works of T.S. Eliot because of his love and the dedication of his life to her.

It is a satisfying mix of comedy, historical drama, romance, and biography. What more can you say except the price is less than renting.

One of the best.An Ideal Husband: A delightful period drama/romance with stellar performances by Minnie Driver & Cate Blanchett. Another of my favorite from this lot.A Month by the Lake: An older (Vanessa Redgrave) lady finds romance in a wonderful adaptation of a story by HE Bates.My Life So Far: Scot lad Fraser lives a somewhat wild childhood and viewers get a very funny accounting of his coming to terms with puberty. Colin Firth is the dad. I'll watch this film again and again.The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain. What will Welsh townsfolk do to retaliate against surveyors (Ian McNeice, Hugh Grant) claiming their prized local mountain is less than 1000 feet--thus a mere `hill'? Another top winner.Sweet Revenge: 2 souls fail to complete suicides off London's Tower Bridge. They form a pact to play a deadly game of revenge against those that drove them to the brink. Lots of UK stars.Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown: Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) gets close and personal during her grief from losing the King with Mr. Brown, a man who cares for her horses and the emotional state of his queen.

Four I'd liked well enough to know I'd want to see them again from time to time--especially Oscar Wilde's ""An Ideal Husband,"" if only for Rupert Everett's hilarious performance.  Also Judi Dench as Queen Victoria in ""Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown"" and Vanessa Redgrave's middle-aged war with a very young  Uma Thurman for the affections of Edward Fox in ""A Month by the Lake"", and  ""My Life So Far,"" based on Sir Denis Forman's memoir of his Scottish childhood*, with Colin Firth as his roving-eyed father.The two I didn't much like the first time I saw them I liked even less the second time. (""Restoration""  with Robert Downey Jr. and ""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain"" with Hugh Grant) but I suspect that's a minority viewpoint.The two I was seeing here for the first time made this purchase well worth the buy all on their own.  ""Sweet Revenge"" with Helena Bonham Carter, Sam Neill and Kristin Scott Thomas is an absolute hoot and I can't believe I'd never heard of it.  ""Tom and Viv"" with Willem Dafoe  and Miranda Richardson tells the sad story of  author T. S. Eliot's  angst-ridden first marriage, back in the days when women with ""female"" problems were diagnosed as mentally ill and carted off to the looney bin.There are no extras--no subtitles, no closed-captioning, no scene indexes. Also,  the product info above gives the impression that Gerard Butler is Dench's co-star in ""Mrs. Brown."" Not so. Dench's co-star is Billy Connolly. Butler plays a  supporting role as Connolly's brother.*Seeing ""My Life So Far"" again reminded me how very much I've loved the book it's based on,Son of Adam, now also sold under the titleMy Life So Far.
