1550823,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B008D9NI86,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","Izak (Yehuda Levi) and Yuni (Joshua Biton) are young cousins in Israel with big plans. Yuni has a brother Levi, who robs banks. Izak's family owns a bar that allows illegal gambling in the back room with unsavory characters. When their lives are threaten in Israel,by a hothead named Tommy (Edward Furlong), they head to the LA to live the American dream. While in America, they manage to step on the toes of a drug czar, Mickey (James Caan) while fixing his car. When Levi gets out of prison and rejoins the family, his criminal ways haven't ended.The film is based on a true story, and during the final credit run they show us actual photos of the characters with spellings such as ""Izak"" as opposed to the traditional ""Isaac."" I found that the story bordered on being exciting, but lacked the Hollywood glitz and drama style to put it into that thriller category.The movie holds your interest, but just when you think it will grab you, it lets go. My biggest complaint is the cliche title. This is the best they could come up with? This is a 2 star film. I added a star for the soundtrack and their attempt to match the music with the era, although they played late 60's music for the 1970s because face it, the music was better.Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (Leilani Sarelle) no sex.",3,ONE WRONG TURN AND YOU CAN CRASH,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,1288,"['Izak', 'Yehuda', 'Levi', 'Yuni', 'Joshua', 'Biton', 'are', 'young', 'cousins', 'Israel', 'big', 'plans', 'Yuni', 'brother', 'Levi', 'who', 'robs', 'banks', 'Izak', 'family', 'bar', 'illegal', 'gambling', 'back', 'room', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'When', 'lives', 'are', 'threaten', 'Israel', 'hothead', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'head', 'LA', 'live', 'American', 'dream', 'America', 'manage', 'step', 'toes', 'drug', 'czar', 'Mickey', 'James', 'Caan', 'fixing', 'car', 'When', 'Levi', 'prison', 'family', 'criminal', 'ways', 'have', ""n't"", 'ended.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'final', 'credit', 'run', 'show', 'actual', 'photos', 'characters', 'spellings', 'such', 'Izak', 'opposed', 'traditional', 'Isaac', 'found', 'story', 'bordered', 'being', 'exciting', 'lacked', 'Hollywood', 'glitz', 'drama', 'style', 'put', 'category.The', 'movie', 'interest', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'will', 'grab', 'go', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'cliche', 'title', 'best', 'could', 'come', 'up', '2', 'star', 'film', 'added', 'star', 'soundtrack', 'attempt', 'match', 'music', 'era', 'played', 'late', '60', 'music', '1970s', 'face', 'music', 'was', 'better.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'nudity', 'Leilani', 'Sarelle', 'sex']",N/A

He is introduced to a life of organized crime at a very young age and has grown accustomed to it. After a member of his family becomes to involved in the world the family decides to movie to Los Angeles. Izek, looking to leave the world behind begins his new life and a quest to live American dream. I have to admit that if a movie is about organized crime in anyway I will watch it. When they are done right they are great, but the problem is that too many try to be ""Goodfellas"" and end up falling flat. While this movie isn't terrible it is also nothing amazing either. I think the biggest problem I had with this is that it didn't know what it wanted to be. Even though it is a true story it seemed like it was trying to hard to have the organized crime aspect (even having James Caan in it) but it didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie. I don't know how to explain what I mean but watch it and you will see. This is not a bad movie but it tended to drag a little and I was starting to lose interest in some parts. Overall, not bad but also a pretty flat movie that had more potential. I give it a B-.",3,Not a bad movie but a little slow in some parts. Tried to hard to put an organized crime aspect in.
