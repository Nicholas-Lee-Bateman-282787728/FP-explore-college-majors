He is unable to follow his own advice, as he goes about creepily stalking his ex-girlfriend, watching while she works, sleeping outside of her house in his car, and being a general pain. His ex claims to be afraid of him, and elicits sympathy and protection from his editor. That is, until Matthew finds someone else, a woman that the movie does not make clear whether or not Matthew really is falling in love with her or just using her to get at his ex. In any case, the plot does thicken, and the tide does turn, as his ex-girlfriend finds herself a little jealous of Matthew's new girlfriend. It is a good plot, and it works, especially when Matthew's ex turns up comatose, badly beaten and might die, while Matthew waits in jail, knowing who did this to her but unable to convince anyone after his own behavior shows him to be obsessed with her. Will the ex-girlfriend live to tell who REALLY did this?

581084,A38YV41LS6RUP0,B00005BCP4,"""dc-76""","[1, 2]","Nice thriller about radio-DJ Matthew (Matthew Settle) who's obsessed with his ex-girlfriend Liz (Gretchen Mol) and thus begins following her after their break up. When he starts seeing another woman (Samantha Mathis) suddenly she is stalked by a friend of him who also is friends with Liz. This situation goes on and on until it escalates....If you're a little bit confused by my brief description of this movie, don't worry...maybe it's my fault. Whatever, &quot;Attraction&quot; is a very entertaining and sexy thriller (mainly thanks to Ms. Mathis). The acting is also very good: Matthew Settle is absolutely believable as the desperate loner who falls in love with someone new without realizing it, while Samantha Mathis delivers a sympathetic and surprisingly sexy performance as his new girlfriend. Tom Everett Scott fares good, too as the negotiator (?) between Settle and Mol whose performance is the only unconvincing in this movie. Since I watched this movie right after &quot;Forever Mine&quot; (where she's great) I was extremely disappointed by her acting. Gretchen is definitely able to do much better as &quot;Forever Mine&quot; shows.Nevertheless &quot;Attraction&quot; is a tense little thriller about relationships, white lies and the way they turn out.",4,Definitely worth watching!!,997833600,"08 15, 2001",2001,1271,"['Nice', 'thriller', 'radio-DJ', 'Matthew', 'Matthew', 'Settle', 'who', 'obsessed', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Liz', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'thus', 'following', 'break', 'up', 'When', 'seeing', 'woman', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'suddenly', 'stalked', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'friends', 'Liz', 'situation', '.If', ""'re"", 'little', 'bit', 'confused', 'brief', 'description', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'maybe', 'fault', 'Whatever', 'quot', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'very', 'entertaining', 'sexy', 'thriller', 'mainly', 'thanks', 'Ms.', 'Mathis', 'acting', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Matthew', 'Settle', 'absolutely', 'believable', 'desperate', 'loner', 'who', 'love', 'someone', 'new', 'realizing', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'sympathetic', 'surprisingly', 'sexy', 'performance', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'good', 'too', 'negotiator', 'Settle', 'Mol', 'performance', 'only', 'unconvincing', 'movie', 'watched', 'movie', 'right', 'quot', 'Forever', 'Mine', 'quot', 'where', 'great', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'Gretchen', 'definitely', 'able', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'Forever', 'Mine', 'quot', 'quot', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'tense', 'little', 'thriller', 'relationships', 'white', 'lies', 'way', 'turn', 'out']",N/A

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 11]","... and along comes ATTRACTION, a tale promising to be about the exploration of four unique friends with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing to the very end.Um ... what's the guess here?These four ""friends"" do little more than go about destroying one another's lives.  They sleep with one another, spy on one another, try to destroy one another's reputations, etc., etc., etc. ... I think you get the picture.  And what's terribly disconcerting is the fact that there's never any motivation provided for them to behave in such a manner.  The talent Tom Everett Scott is wasted in a predictable performance that could've been so much more ... the two-faced friend.  The lovely Gretchen Mol (wasn't she supposed to be 'the next big thing' in Hollywood a few years back?)  is reduced to a sex object.  The talented Samantha Mathis is the only character given more than a single dimension; perhaps if the film had spent more time exploring her plight, these 100 minutes might've been worth committing to celluloid.The film's only saving grace is the gratuitous, near-full-body nude sequence of the lovely Ms. Mathis.  ...On a stylistic note, the film's editor ""attempted"" an artistic stroke by inserting a 'cut' in the middle of select scenes where one friend is speaking with another about behavior.  While it's clear that the cuts are intentional, they come off as meaningless tricks, jarringly pulling the viewer out of the film's narrative to the point of asking aloud, ""What the hell was that?  Did someone just drop the camera?""But, even films as bad as ATTRACTION can have some use in society.

The title was kind of promising; 3. The DVD cover didn't look bad either; 4. I like Gretchen Mol (and since that was put as the last reason, I didn't really expect a lot from her, much less from this movie). So I'm saying ""oh well"" and giving it 2 stars just for her.

Okay, take ""Someone To Watch Over Me"". More twists and turns? Maybe ""Kiss The Girls"" or ""The Bone Collector"" could be entertaining. Not erotic enough?
