I found it extremely improbable that the female CIA agent had gotten through the CIA's background checks with her mental illness problem.  However, in season two, her fellow agents and superiors all know this and they act exactly as I would expect them to act having that knowledge.  They distrust her and don't want to use her.Brody is now in Congress.  He is being groomed as a vice presidential candidate while the current VP would run for president.  His kids now go to the same school as the VP's and his daughter befriends the VP's son. His wife likes the escalation in their lifestyle but still does not like the Brody who returned from the war.  She would rather be with Tom but is trying to do her duty.A new guy is introduced and he is a CIA agent who works with Carrie, Saul and eventually Brody. I thought he was a good new addition to the cast.Our same male and female terrorists are back and they are still hatching plots, which the CIA must thwart. The water gets progressively murkier on whom Brody is working for and this heightens the suspense.  He gets in many tight situations.I frankly don't understand why many viewers were disappointed with this season.

1598364,A3QU74B9N0830G,B009LDCZ7I,Dan Thompson,"[10, 11]","The second season of the critically-acclaimed ""Homeland"" had a lot to live up to. The first season had a raw and frenetic intensity that was missing from television and delivered outstanding performances from it's lead cast. I know I, for one, was worried about what the second season would bring, simply because the first season was so good. I'm happy to report that my worries were unwarranted and so should anyone else's.The thing I love about this show so much is that it keeps me guessing. Most shows on TV today follow a similar formula in which the audience can see what's going to happen long before it ever does. Any big reveals or surprises turn into moments that you wish had been presented earlier so the show could bring you something new. ""Homeland"" turns this idea upside down and throws it out the window. Like the season before it, this second season contains multiple big surprises and I mean QUICK. You won't have to wade through various episodes of filler for things to start happening; it starts out with a bang and doesn't let up.Claire Danes and Damian Lewis are sensational in this show and are more than deserving of the recognition they've receives for their roles. Carrie, played by Danes, is slowly transitioning back into a life of normalcy when a familiar threat rears it's ugly head and drags her back into the world of terrorism and espionage. Brody, played flawlessly by Lewis, has a much larger role this season as he's forced to face the consequences of the decisions he's made since being rescued as a POW for eight years. Another high note from the season is Mandy Patinkin in his continued role as veteran CIA analyst Saul Berenson. I really felt like he deserved more screen time in the first season and was ecstatic that he get's just that here.

1598367,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B009LDCZ7I,D. C. Obraztsov,"[155, 164]","SPOILER-FREEI was worried about season 2 of Homeland; worried that they would not be able to re-capture the atmosphere and intensity of the first.  In a way, I was a little right.  I personally think the first season is quite a bit better, but being in one of the top 5 television dramas currently on television, it's easily a 5/5 stars still.It's really hard to say too much without giving away spoilers.  The best way to put it - things change...and they change A LOT.  The whole dynamics of the show are different this season.  A startling revelation is discovered early on and turns the show completely on its head.  The formula is different, but for the most part, the outcomes are the same.  It is still one of the shows best at creating tension and suspense and is a true CIA thriller.CAST - the actors are superbly cast.  Mandy Patinkin as Saul is incredible as ever this season, and even gets almost a whole episode dedicated to his acting talents.  Claire Danes is perfect as the emotionally unstable, yet brilliant Carrie.  Damian Lewis as Nicholas Brody has a lot of emotions to balance, obviously, and does it well.  The supporting cast is also pretty talented.  Homeland also garnered a lot of attention when they practically stole the Emmys with Best Drama, Best Actor in a Drama (Lewis) and Best Actress in a Drama (Claire Danes).STORYLINE - things are definitely different this season.  Does Carrie get her vengeance for what Brody did to her at the end of last season by telling Estes?  Do her and Brody get romantic again?  You'll just have to see, but things are shaken up and are very different from last season.  And they happen quickly.  It's incredibly difficult to give away much without spoiling, but there's always a black cloud over everything, and you never know what will happen next.  Sometimes it's surprisingly predictable, and other times it's really out of nowhere.BELIEVABILITY - okay, things get a little murky here.  On one hand, this *is* entertainment, not a documentary.  On the other hand, viewers and critics tend to value at least some semblance of realism in their dramas these days, especially on premium cable channels.  There was one episode in particular this season ('Broken Hearts') that really upset a lot of critics and many viewers due to how far they stretched the realm of the possibility.  Forgivable?  Definitely, for a show like this.  But they *were* somewhat resorting to cheap plot tricks to make stuff happen like a B terrorist movie instead of clever writing, so hopefully it was a fluke.FUN FACTOR - lots of fun!  It's a high quality action/thriller/terrorist show, so you can expect plenty of drama, chases, near-deaths, plotting, deception, character moral ambiguity....there's definitely so many fun aspects to it that make it worth watching.If you want to be in the loop of the best shows on television, you should definitely be watching Homeland!",5,"""I'm more alone than I was in the bottom of that hole in Iraq."" - Nicholas Brody",1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,2916,"['SPOILER-FREEI', 'was', 'worried', 'season', '2', 'Homeland', 'worried', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 're-capture', 'atmosphere', 'intensity', 'first', 'way', 'was', 'little', 'right', 'personally', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'being', 'one', 'top', '5', 'television', 'dramas', 'currently', 'television', 'easily', '5/5', 'stars', 'still.It', 'really', 'hard', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'best', 'way', 'put', 'things', 'change', 'change', 'LOT', 'whole', 'dynamics', 'show', 'are', 'different', 'season', 'startling', 'revelation', 'discovered', 'early', 'show', 'completely', 'head', 'formula', 'different', 'most', 'part', 'outcomes', 'are', 'same', 'still', 'one', 'shows', 'best', 'creating', 'tension', 'suspense', 'true', 'CIA', 'thriller.CAST', 'actors', 'are', 'superbly', 'cast', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Saul', 'incredible', 'ever', 'season', 'even', 'almost', 'whole', 'episode', 'dedicated', 'acting', 'talents', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'perfect', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'Carrie', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Nicholas', 'Brody', 'lot', 'emotions', 'balance', 'obviously', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'pretty', 'talented', 'Homeland', 'also', 'garnered', 'lot', 'attention', 'when', 'practically', 'stole', 'Emmys', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'Lewis', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Drama', 'Claire', 'Danes', '.STORYLINE', 'things', 'are', 'definitely', 'different', 'season', 'Does', 'Carrie', 'get', 'vengeance', 'what', 'Brody', 'did', 'her', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'telling', 'Estes', 'Do', 'Brody', 'get', 'romantic', 'again', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'shaken', 'up', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'last', 'season', 'happen', 'quickly', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'spoiling', 'always', 'black', 'cloud', 'everything', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'surprisingly', 'predictable', 'other', 'times', 'really', 'nowhere.BELIEVABILITY', 'okay', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'murky', 'here', 'one', 'hand', '*is*', 'entertainment', 'not', 'documentary', 'other', 'hand', 'viewers', 'critics', 'tend', 'value', 'least', 'semblance', 'realism', 'dramas', 'days', 'especially', 'premium', 'cable', 'channels', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'particular', 'season', ""'Broken"", 'Hearts', 'really', 'upset', 'lot', 'critics', 'many', 'viewers', 'due', 'how', 'far', 'stretched', 'realm', 'possibility', 'Forgivable', 'Definitely', 'show', '*were*', 'somewhat', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'plot', 'tricks', 'make', 'stuff', 'happen', 'B', 'terrorist', 'movie', 'instead', 'clever', 'writing', 'so', 'hopefully', 'was', 'fluke.FUN', 'FACTOR', 'lots', 'fun', 'high', 'quality', 'action/thriller/terrorist', 'show', 'can', 'expect', 'plenty', 'drama', 'chases', 'near-deaths', 'plotting', 'deception', 'character', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'definitely', 'so', 'many', 'fun', 'aspects', 'make', 'worth', 'want', 'be', 'loop', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'Homeland']",N/A

1598378,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009LDCZ7I,Grady Harp,"[36, 49]","After Episode 1 of the second season of HOMELAND was aired a it appeared that this would be an intensely interesting, psychological thriller. All of the ingredients seem to be present - fine writing (Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff), fast paced direction by Michael Cuesta, and a very strong cast including Claire Danes in one of her most challenging roles, Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin.The concept is very much in the public eye at this point - a study of how terrorists are followed and found and how the US Intelligence Service functions. The first episode introduced all of the main characters and fleshed out in a single episode the clues for all of the complicated substories and subplots that the series promises. After eight years absence Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) was thought MIA but is discovered in a filthy cell in Iraq ad brought back to the US in a Marine Victory parade. Brody had been captured with another Marine who was beaten to death and the reasons why Brody survived and his fellow Marine didn't makes CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) suspicious - could Brody have sold out to Iraqi bad guy Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) and that is how he survived torture and captivity? Mathison is driven to see if her concept is correct, gains the backing of her boss Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin, and successfully fills Brody's house with surveillance equipment so his every move can be observed. The sidebars include the fact that in Brody's absence his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) has fallen in love with Brody's best friend Mike (Diego Klattenhoff), and in the intense questioning and shock of being back home Brody begins to remember events of his capture and imprisonment including the fact that he was the one who beat his fellow Marine to death at the behest of Abu Nasir. Brody's physical condition and body language also give signs that perhaps Mathison's concepts that Brody sold out to Abu Nazir and is plotting an attack on America are viable. The stinger is that Carrie is discovered as being on antipsychotic medication since a young girl - making her contributions to intelligence under suspicion. She undergoes therapy including electroshock therapy, lives with her compassionate sister, and since she had stange and seemingly dangerous behaviors she has been let go from her work as an agent. Now with the second season we find a recuperated Carrie, a more convincing Brody who becomes a candidate for Vice President and is now open with his wife and daughter Dana (Morgan Saylor)  about his conversion to Islam, and once again the numbers of events that occur in rapid fire sequence keep us glued to the story. A few new characters - the enigmatic Quinn (Rupert Friend, absolutely brilliant), the suspicious Roya (Zuleikha Robinson), Estes (David Harewood), and even the brief appearance of a character whose significance remains a mystery in  F. Murray Abraham as Dar Adal. The final episode brings Brody back into suspicion at the memorial service of the Vice President Walden (Jamey Sheridan) when a bomb in Brody's car parked outside the CIA building explodes.There is a tense chase and capture of Nazir, and changes which make the relationship between Carrie and Brody bounce up and down. The real test of whether a series will continue is the degree of unanswered questions left to be resolved in the final episode, and this case there are so many unknowns that it makes the anticipation of next session very high. A very successful Second Season.

All of the pieces fit together in keeping this political drama moving in surprising directions. The writers have kept the momentum in Season 2 as alliances and motives shift. The writing is crisp and fresh and stimulates the viewer with a story that delves deep into political, social and moral issues. Here is a show that excels in being well-written, absorbing and intriguing.Season One left CIA agent Carrie Mathison's life shattered. There could have been no better choice to play Mathison than the lovely Clair Danes. Confident Mathison with a remarkable ""gut"" instinct fell into the depths of dispair in Season One.  Her career and confidence were gone.  This hotshot agent became a shell of her former self as she began to question the truth behind rescued hostage Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) and his ties to his former captor the terrorist Abu Nazir.In Season 2, Brody is a congressman fast on his way to becoming a major force in politics. He becomes top choice as the Vice-Presidential candidate when the current VP runs for the Presidency. Brody seems to have it all as he tries to mend the rift with his wife and children. Mathison's life was destroyed in Season One when her theory that Brody had been ""turned"" by Abu-Nazir was ""proven"" wrong--though the viewer knew all along she was correct with her idea.Season Two does not disappoint in its revelations that Mathison's instincts were not wrong. She is on the road to recovery and teaches English as a Second Language when the CIA comes calling.  Although it is not clear how she returns to the CIA, somehow she again becomes a major force in the agency. Let the intrigue continue.HOMELAND keeps us wondering as characters, especially Brody, seem to change alliances and beliefs. How would someone return to their former life after years in captivity? How do ""good"" people become twisted with hate and revenge? There are some fascinated character studies here as new players are introduced this season. Zuleikha Robinson is outstanding as the Palestinian and British-educated journalist Roya Hammad. Hammad is beautiful and thoroughly wicked and devious with contacts in high levels of government. She becomes Brody's mysterious handler and connection to Abu Nazir. Hammad's sinister nature proves that evil can come in any form. Robinson brings depth and substance to the misguided Hammad.Each episode only gets deeper and deeper into the minds of Brody and Mathison who re-ignite their volatile relationship as Brody's family life deteriorates beyond repair. There is a fascinating journey with a moral tinge. Who can be trusted and what is anyone's true intention? Even the ""good"" guys can be bad. Danes gives Carrie Mathison an edge that becomes more and more disturbed as she questions Brody's intentions. Her confused doe-eyed gaze that hovers between madness and sanity say more than any words could.I'm hooked and can't wait for Season 3 on DVD. One disappointing note to mention are the bland and sparse ""extras"" that are included in this DVD set. Damien Lewis's Super 8 Movies-yes, he apparently still has an ancient Super 8 camera-does have some fun behind-the-scenes footage featuring cast and crew. Unfortunately, the extras are limited and give very little insight into the filming and visual effects and storyline.HOMELAND is a fascinating exploration of life in the modern age of terrorism and political unrest. The writers are abreast of current events and the show has a force of reality that is rare on TV.",5,DEEPER JOURNEY INTO MORAL AND POLITICAL INTRIGUE,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,3571,"['HOMELAND', 'amazingly', 'well-written', 'show', 'dream', 'cast', 'pieces', 'fit', 'together', 'keeping', 'political', 'drama', 'moving', 'surprising', 'directions', 'writers', 'have', 'kept', 'momentum', 'Season', '2', 'alliances', 'motives', 'shift', 'writing', 'crisp', 'fresh', 'viewer', 'story', 'deep', 'political', 'social', 'moral', 'issues', 'Here', 'show', 'being', 'well-written', 'absorbing', 'intriguing.Season', 'One', 'left', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'life', 'shattered', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'play', 'Mathison', 'lovely', 'Clair', 'Danes', 'Confident', 'Mathison', 'remarkable', 'gut', 'instinct', 'fell', 'depths', 'dispair', 'Season', 'One', 'career', 'confidence', 'were', 'gone', 'hotshot', 'agent', 'became', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'began', 'question', 'truth', 'rescued', 'hostage', 'Marine', 'Sergeant', 'Nicholas', 'Brody', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'ties', 'former', 'captor', 'terrorist', 'Abu', 'Nazir.In', 'Season', '2', 'Brody', 'congressman', 'fast', 'way', 'becoming', 'major', 'force', 'politics', 'top', 'choice', 'Vice-Presidential', 'candidate', 'when', 'current', 'VP', 'Presidency', 'Brody', 'have', 'mend', 'rift', 'wife', 'children', 'Mathison', 'life', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Season', 'One', 'when', 'theory', 'Brody', 'had', 'been', 'turned', 'Abu-Nazir', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'viewer', 'knew', 'was', 'correct', 'idea.Season', 'Two', 'not', 'disappoint', 'revelations', 'Mathison', 'instincts', 'were', 'not', 'wrong', 'road', 'recovery', 'teaches', 'English', 'Second', 'Language', 'when', 'CIA', 'calling', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'CIA', 'somehow', 'again', 'major', 'force', 'agency', 'Let', 'intrigue', 'continue.HOMELAND', 'wondering', 'characters', 'especially', 'Brody', 'seem', 'change', 'alliances', 'beliefs', 'How', 'would', 'someone', 'return', 'former', 'life', 'years', 'captivity', 'How', 'do', 'good', 'people', 'become', 'twisted', 'hate', 'revenge', 'are', 'fascinated', 'character', 'studies', 'here', 'new', 'players', 'are', 'introduced', 'season', 'Zuleikha', 'Robinson', 'outstanding', 'Palestinian', 'British-educated', 'journalist', 'Roya', 'Hammad', 'Hammad', 'beautiful', 'thoroughly', 'wicked', 'devious', 'contacts', 'high', 'levels', 'government', 'Brody', 'mysterious', 'handler', 'connection', 'Abu', 'Nazir', 'Hammad', 'sinister', 'nature', 'evil', 'can', 'come', 'form', 'Robinson', 'depth', 'substance', 'misguided', 'Hammad.Each', 'episode', 'only', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'minds', 'Brody', 'Mathison', 'who', 're-ignite', 'volatile', 'relationship', 'Brody', 'family', 'life', 'repair', 'fascinating', 'journey', 'moral', 'tinge', 'Who', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'what', 'anyone', 'true', 'intention', 'Even', 'good', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'Danes', 'Carrie', 'Mathison', 'edge', 'more', 'more', 'disturbed', 'questions', 'Brody', 'intentions', 'confused', 'doe-eyed', 'gaze', 'hovers', 'madness', 'sanity', 'say', 'more', 'words', 'could.I', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'One', 'disappointing', 'note', 'mention', 'are', 'bland', 'sparse', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'set', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'Super', '8', 'Movies-yes', 'apparently', 'still', 'ancient', 'Super', '8', 'camera-does', 'have', 'fun', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'featuring', 'cast', 'crew', 'Unfortunately', 'extras', 'are', 'limited', 'give', 'very', 'little', 'insight', 'filming', 'visual', 'effects', 'storyline.HOMELAND', 'fascinating', 'exploration', 'life', 'modern', 'age', 'terrorism', 'political', 'unrest', 'writers', 'are', 'current', 'events', 'show', 'force', 'reality', 'rare', 'TV']",N/A

The director has been able to capitalize on the idiosyncrasy and weirdness of Danes and Lewis characters to bring out an emotional weight and complexity that  carry the series forward and make it irresistible for COINTELPRO aficionados and dabblers in psychological warfare.That's why I find the fundamental dishonesty and deceptiveness that epitomize the show  rather jarring.  The entire Series 2 is based on a terrorist pact between Al Qaeda and Hezbollah which plan and execute a large scale terrorist event in the US. That this does not make sense is obvious to anyone who reads the daily news - Hezbollah and Iran are waging a deadly war against Al Qaeda outfits in Syria, and Shias/Sunnis are vicious competitors in Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Saudi and, of course, Lebanon (where the plot takes place in the first couple of installments). The show's obvious intent is to demonize Moslems across the board,Persians and Arabs alike. Christian Arabs are not above suspicion either - a terrorist tailor, Bassel, has a Maronite (i.e., Christian) name (Bassel/Basil). A CIA director (Saul Solomon) when asked how to look for suspects instructs: ""Look for the dark skinned ones!"".It does not come as a surprise that the show is co-written & co-directed by an Israeli who takes advantage of political ignorance, opportunism and pro-Israel bias that permeates the network (Showtime). In a nutshell, the show also epitomizes Israel's relentless attempts to mold American understanding of the Middle East conflict through media agitprop and lobbying outfits such as AIPAC and WINEP by creating a  narrative where Persians and Arabs (US citizen or not) are to be distrusted as a matter of principle. Ever seen an Israeli bad guy on TV? How about Arabs?  The real life picture is more complicated. Israel has caused US much grief by pushing, through its neocon proxies, the country into the pointless Iraq war, by doing it's best to  scuttle each and every US-led peace initiative in the Middle East and by trying to force us into bombing/boycotting Iran. The most sophisticated spying network in the US is probably that of Mossad yet we hear not a peep about this outfit in the series; nor are there any references to the de facto ethnic cleansing in Israel which keeps fueling the conflict.Despite excellent acting and directing, this show therefore works to undermine peace while serving as an enabler of those who are trying their best to destroy it. It is a simulacrum of the real world, a fantasy that gleefully  fans disinformation, anger and ignorance to benefit an agenda designed to undermine (to use Rush's term) the 'low information voter's' grip on reality. By providing us with good time it also disconnects us from the real world.",3,i am ambivalent,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,2877,"['As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'Homeland', 'one', 'best', 'out', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'Superb', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'casting', 'director', 'been', 'able', 'capitalize', 'idiosyncrasy', 'weirdness', 'Danes', 'Lewis', 'characters', 'bring', 'out', 'emotional', 'weight', 'complexity', 'carry', 'series', 'forward', 'make', 'irresistible', 'COINTELPRO', 'aficionados', 'dabblers', 'psychological', 'warfare.That', 'why', 'find', 'fundamental', 'dishonesty', 'deceptiveness', 'show', 'rather', 'jarring', 'entire', 'Series', '2', 'based', 'terrorist', 'pact', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'Hezbollah', 'plan', 'execute', 'large', 'scale', 'terrorist', 'event', 'US', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'daily', 'news', 'Hezbollah', 'Iran', 'are', 'waging', 'deadly', 'war', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'Syria', 'Shias/Sunnis', 'are', 'vicious', 'competitors', 'Iraq', 'Pakistan', 'Bahrain', 'Saudi', 'course', 'Lebanon', 'where', 'plot', 'place', 'first', 'couple', 'installments', 'show', 'obvious', 'intent', 'demonize', 'Moslems', 'board', 'Persians', 'Arabs', 'alike', 'Christian', 'Arabs', 'are', 'not', 'suspicion', 'terrorist', 'tailor', 'Bassel', 'Maronite', 'i.e.', 'Christian', 'name', 'Bassel/Basil', 'CIA', 'director', 'Saul', 'Solomon', 'when', 'asked', 'how', 'look', 'suspects', 'instructs', 'Look', 'dark', 'skinned', 'ones', '.It', 'not', 'come', 'surprise', 'show', 'co-written', 'co-directed', 'Israeli', 'who', 'advantage', 'political', 'ignorance', 'opportunism', 'pro-Israel', 'bias', 'network', 'Showtime', 'nutshell', 'show', 'also', 'Israel', 'relentless', 'attempts', 'mold', 'American', 'understanding', 'Middle', 'East', 'conflict', 'media', 'agitprop', 'lobbying', 'outfits', 'such', 'AIPAC', 'WINEP', 'creating', 'narrative', 'where', 'Persians', 'Arabs', 'US', 'citizen', 'not', 'are', 'be', 'distrusted', 'matter', 'principle', 'Ever', 'seen', 'Israeli', 'bad', 'guy', 'TV', 'How', 'Arabs', 'real', 'life', 'picture', 'more', 'complicated', 'Israel', 'caused', 'US', 'much', 'grief', 'pushing', 'neocon', 'proxies', 'country', 'pointless', 'Iraq', 'war', 'doing', 'best', 'scuttle', 'US-led', 'peace', 'initiative', 'Middle', 'East', 'trying', 'force', 'bombing/boycotting', 'Iran', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'spying', 'network', 'US', 'probably', 'Mossad', 'yet', 'hear', 'not', 'peep', 'outfit', 'series', 'are', 'there', 'references', 'de', 'facto', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'Israel', 'fueling', 'conflict.Despite', 'excellent', 'acting', 'directing', 'show', 'therefore', 'undermine', 'peace', 'serving', 'enabler', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'best', 'destroy', 'simulacrum', 'real', 'world', 'fantasy', 'gleefully', 'disinformation', 'anger', 'ignorance', 'benefit', 'agenda', 'designed', 'undermine', 'use', 'Rush', 'term', ""'low"", 'information', 'voter', 'grip', 'reality', 'providing', 'good', 'time', 'also', 'real', 'world']",N/A

1598409,A3LA1L1TUXV9TN,B009LDCZ7I,Martin R. Lash,"[5, 5]","A lot of people are complaining that season 2 falls short of season 1; that there is too much about the relationship between Brody and Carrie which gets in the way. I assert that season 1 lays the groundwork for how their relationship develops and becomes more complicated and troubled in season 2. Also, many aspects of the events that deal with the war on terrorism that are set forth in season 1 play out in season 2. The events of season 1 and 2 are intertwined and connected.I am not going to offer any ""spoiler"" comments here but the events in both seasons, especially season 2, are becoming all too familiar these days. This show is, of course, fiction but in a way is not. The last episode called ""The Choice"" leads us to believe that there may be a happy ending with respect to the relationship between Carrie and Brody but the horrors of terrorism get in the way. The finale is a visceral, intense and disturbing experience.But, with respect to the complaints about season 2, there may be a little too many ""mushy"" moments between the two protagonists. But, in an interview in the season 2 extras Danes says that these moments make the tone, at least for a while, be more ""human."" I get that. Both seasons run through at a almost fevered pitch, somewhat like many episodes of my other favorite, ""24."" But ""24"" also allowed Bauer to have some moments of his own, even though they were few.  They do not take away from the show but make the characters seem more real.The writing as in season 1 is brilliant. I am especially moved by how Danes portrays bi-polar disease. She must have looked into the issue or been around people who know what it is like to be bi-polar; to have episodes that can be manic at one time and suddenly become depressive. As someone who has dealt with this problem it is wonderful and also a little scary to witness by Danes' astonishing acting how the disease can over, even consume, one's personality. Her bi-polar moments were almost like a mirror. Maybe not that extreme but a mirror nonetheless.I have to add the the casting is brilliant. Having Mandy Patinkin as Saul who becomes Carrie's father-figure is wonderful. He is such a great actor and I am glad he took on this part. His somewhat world-weary tone is unmistakable. Also how he respects and is confused and frustrated by Carrie's behavior is  great.  Nobody else could have played Saul. Watch for his very moving prayer, in Jewish, at the end. You don't need to understand the words to realize what his prayer is about. Why he is praying becomes evident. I loved that brief moment in the finale.One of the actor in the show that nobody talks about is Morgan Saylor who plays Brody's 16 year old daughter. I am always amazed how film and TV shows can find really great kid actors. Saylor is excellent. She acts like a typical teenager but her character also calls for depth and sensitivity and Saylor does quite well. Check out her reactions to her father's actions in the show's finale and you will see what I mean.A TV critic for the New Yorker said that Homeland is the best show on TV.

The rest of the cast is still very good, especially Mandy Patinkin as Carrie's mentor at the CIA.Spoiler Alert:This season sees Brody (Damian Lewis) transformed into a CIA asset as Carrie and her CIA team turn him against his al-Qaeda captors.  There is a great deal of irony in this script and by the end of season 2 it seems that season 3 will find us completely reversed from the plot in season 1.  In season 1 Carrie was the only person in the USA who believed that Brody was working for al-Qaeda and was about to commit a terrorist attack.  In season 3 it appears that Carrie will be the only person who believes Brody is NOT a terrorist bomber.  Big time irony theme going there.So, bottom line, I still recommend this series for those who don't mind a dark and adult themed show, but it has taken a step back in the intensity of the drama from the first season.

I was afraid that its second season couldn't possibly top the first, and it didn't....but it's still unbelievably fabulous. I don't want to give away all the gory details, but let's just say that as is always the case with this show, nothing went along as I expected it would, and the season finale was INSANE and leaves everything completely up in the air for Season 3.I will gripe for a moment about my only (very, very small) gripes with this show. One, Jessica's character has become even more annoying, and while I sympathize with her plight, she does something with her kids in the next room that should earn her the title of Worst Mom of the Year. Seriously, what was up with that? Second, there is not and never has been any chemistry between Brody and Jessica at all. I guess you can easily explain that by saying that obviously there's no chemistry, because they both changed so much in the eight years that they were apart and have nothing in common anymore. Fine, I get that (though it would be interesting to incorporate some flashbacks of what they were like together before Brody went to war and was taken prisoner). My other gripe, though, is that there's no real chemistry between Brody and Carrie either. It just makes me wonder what their deal truly is as a couple. Are there really feelings there? It never seems like it to me. Or are they just two super messed up people taking comfort in the fact that they've found someone who is just as crazy as they are? I guess only time will tell.Anyway, aside from my ranting...great show, great show, great show!

Claire Danes isn't Jack Baur.  But she plays a great spy suffering from manic depression.  Her character as Carrie Mathison is a CIA operative, unlike Baur's CTU agency.It amazes me how the British actor Damien Lewis can portray the All-American Marine Veteran.  He amazed me in Band of Brothers.  And now Lewis has created this great character - Nicholas Brody.Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson is a really good comeback for Mandy.  I liked him in Criminal Minds.  But he will always be remembered as Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride in 1987 (#Happy25thAnniversary to that movie #PrincessBride btw).Now don't get me wrong here.  I liked the final half of 24's 8 seasons as well as the bits of the first seasons that I've seen.  So I think if 24 can survive 8 seasons, in my opinion, Homeland can too.

1598417,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B009LDCZ7I,Mike S.,"[3, 3]","Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from season 1, and hints (but no major spoilers) from Season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 proceed at your own risk.The fist season of Homeland was very original and told a very good story.  Brody, who had been a POW in Iraq was turned into a terrorist and a part of a plot to execute a terrorist attack in America, which he backed out of.  At the end of season 1 only the viewers knew the truth.  That changes very quickly in Season 2.  The tape he made confessing to the bombing he backed out of comes back to haunt him in multiple ways in the second season.I cannot say too much without giving away a lot of what happens, but there is another terrorist plot in the second season that we don't know the full extent of until about 3/4 of the way through the season finale.  Many of the characters and relationships in the show change, and there are a couple very big twists.  The season ends with some things resolved and other questions left open.  It definitely leaves the show to go into a very interesting direction in the third season and will hopefully keep Brody's storyline from getting worn out.The acting and writing of the show are both top notch again.  I do not think there was a downturn in either from season 1, even though there are some far fetched moments.  The A/V quality of the blu rays are very good, as you would expect.  There is not a ton of bonus material.  There is a very short prologue to the third season, a short film by Damien Lewis, a making of the second season feature and some deleted scenes.  There are also commentary tracks on selected episodes.  All in all, if you are a fan of the first season, you will most likely be a fan of the second.",5,Kept the series compelling and interesting,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,1726,"['Fair', 'warning', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'season', '1', 'hints', 'major', 'spoilers', 'Season', '2', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'season', '1', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk.The', 'fist', 'season', 'Homeland', 'was', 'very', 'original', 'told', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'Brody', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'POW', 'Iraq', 'was', 'turned', 'terrorist', 'part', 'plot', 'execute', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'America', 'backed', 'end', 'season', '1', 'only', 'viewers', 'knew', 'truth', 'very', 'quickly', 'Season', '2', 'tape', 'made', 'confessing', 'bombing', 'backed', 'back', 'haunt', 'multiple', 'ways', 'second', 'season.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'giving', 'away', 'lot', 'what', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'second', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'full', 'extent', '3/4', 'way', 'season', 'finale', 'Many', 'characters', 'relationships', 'show', 'change', 'are', 'couple', 'very', 'big', 'twists', 'season', 'things', 'resolved', 'other', 'questions', 'left', 'open', 'definitely', 'show', 'go', 'very', 'interesting', 'direction', 'third', 'season', 'will', 'hopefully', 'keep', 'Brody', 'storyline', 'getting', 'worn', 'acting', 'writing', 'show', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'again', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'downturn', 'season', '1', 'even', 'are', 'far', 'fetched', 'moments', 'A/V', 'quality', 'blu', 'rays', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'expect', 'not', 'ton', 'bonus', 'material', 'very', 'short', 'prologue', 'third', 'season', 'short', 'film', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'making', 'second', 'season', 'feature', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'selected', 'episodes', 'are', 'fan', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'fan', 'second']",N/A

Both Seasons, however, had me twisting in angst - and I liked it.  I detest waiting for next week or next season.  But Season 1 of Homeland sucked me in.  Only the audience and CIA agent Carrie Matheson (Claire Danes) know that returned POW Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) is a closet terrorist.  He shot and killed his friend without batting an eyelash, wore a C4 vest to kill the vice president of the U.S. (only to back out) and began an affair with Carrie.  The audience does not know if Carrie is really in love with Brody or just trying to gather more information.  As Carrie frantically attempts to derail Brody's terrorist quest, Brody takes out a restraining order on her and warns her to leave him alone.  She cannot and appeals to Brody's daughter to call her father on his cell phone just as he is trying to get the C4 vest to work in an underground bunker.  For her efforts, poor Carrie is arrested and hospitalized.  Defeated and with nobody believing her, Carrie is booted out of the CIA and checks herself in as a patient for her bipolar disorder where she undergoes shock therapy and loses some of her memory including the name of terrorist Abu Nasir's (Navid Negahban) son that Brody had shouted out one night in his sleep.In Season 2, Brody is now a Senator and is planning to run for Vice President.  Carrie is teaching English classes and living with her stable but bipolar father.  The CIA needs her expertise to try to turn a former female contact overseas to capture terrorist Abu Nasir.  Just at the last second Nasir receives a text message warning him of the trap.  Carrie returns to the U.S. and continues to work on the Nasir case (unofficially) and an older recording of Brody explaining his bomb vest attack on the Vice President is discovered in some items that Carrie steals from a contact of Nasir.  Carrie's mentor, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), lets her know what was found and a new CIA agent Quinn (Rupert Friend) works with her in a surveillance sting on Brody.  Finally, Carrie is vindicated but not reinstated to her former job due to her bipolar disorder.  She confronts Brody, he is tortured and agrees to help the CIA.  For some unknown reason, Carrie resumes the affair with Brody.  The season ends with a bang with Carrie wondering if Brody was just manipulating her the entire time.There are many more plot twists, characters, and nefarious deeds than I have mentioned, and although the premise is not as plausible as some other shows of this genre, it is, after all, entertainment that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Danes, though not a classically beautiful woman, is hypnotically attractive. The camera loves the great range of her emotions and facial expressions through the hours and hours in which she occupies the screen.This is not a great second year of any series, but it will do until another great one comes along.

Carrie finds herself pulled into an agency op again when an ""asset"" she was working with approaches the CIA with information with the opportunity to take out Abu Nazir.END OF SPOILERS:The second season did something surprising (I can't give it away) by resolving one major plot point well before the conclusion of the second season a very daring move on the part of the writers/producers/directors/actors on the show that pays off with a surprising conclusion for season two as well.For those that don't buy the love affair between Brody and Carrie, I buy it because they are both very damaged individuals who understand each other better than anyone else does them.

This sense of control is a big part of the reason why ""Homeland"", in its second season, is able to match the intensity of the explosive first.  The producers are able to flesh out the stories/characters on THEIR schedule.For a basic plot summary (with only minor spoilers), Season Two of Homeland sees Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) recovering from her shock therapy, while Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) is still torn between his allegiance to Abu Nezir (Navid Negahban) and his wife/family.  Saying quite literally anything more would be venturing into major spoiler territory, but suffice it to say that the intrigue and unpredictability carries over from Season One.To me, the main reason this show remains great is because it manages to re-invent itself seemingly multiple times per season.  Remember back to watching Season One and how it seemed like a completely different show after 12 episodes?  The same exact thing happens in Season Two.  A show like this (again, given the freedom that network shows do not have) is able to develop plot-arcs in just 12 episodes that some shows take seasons to parcel out.  Simply put, there is a hard-charging philosophy (perhaps this is also a residual effect of the show sharing many creators from the similar-themed ""24"") to this type of storytelling that makes every moment compelling.I truly wish I could write more about this wonderful season, but I really don't want to spoil the experience for you in any form.
