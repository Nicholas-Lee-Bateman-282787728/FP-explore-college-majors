662116,A2YRZPGWLPB2OF,B00005KHJA,Kodi Kodai,"[2, 2]","This collection has the very first Dirty Pair I happened to view and enjoyed immensely some years ago in Japanese language without English subtitles - even though I couldn't understand Japanese at that time! (The  clarity of the action and comedy easily reached beyond the language. That's how good it was.) The OAV I saw was the prison break and rescue episode. I was delighted by the wild action and humorous antics of Kei and Yuri, and I've happily followed their adventures and mayhem ever since.The Dirty Pair are two tough (and very foxy) female agents that get into James-Bondish-science-fiction type high adventures.  Kei and Yuri's antics and adventures has been released in Japan as OAVs, as movies, as a TV series, and as SF literature.The Dirty Pair adventures originally started out as SF novels. The novels are now also available in North America after being translated and brought over by Dark Horse publications. The movies and the OAVs are also available, but one hopes the TV series will not be left far behind. (Anyone who has seen it will recognize the impact it, and the show Lupin III, had on the anime series 'Cowboy Bebop'.)I recommend this OAV series collection to anyone looking for great action/comedy adventures with the (ahem) 'Lovely Angels' team of Kei and Yuri.",5,Girls with Guns that want to have Fun,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,1293,"['collection', 'very', 'first', 'Dirty', 'Pair', 'happened', 'view', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'years', 'ago', 'Japanese', 'language', 'English', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Japanese', 'time', 'clarity', 'action', 'comedy', 'easily', 'reached', 'language', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'OAV', 'saw', 'was', 'prison', 'break', 'rescue', 'episode', 'was', 'delighted', 'wild', 'action', 'humorous', 'antics', 'Kei', 'Yuri', ""'ve"", 'happily', 'followed', 'adventures', 'mayhem', 'ever', 'since.The', 'Dirty', 'Pair', 'are', 'two', 'tough', 'very', 'foxy', 'female', 'agents', 'get', 'James-Bondish-science-fiction', 'type', 'high', 'adventures', 'Kei', 'Yuri', 'antics', 'adventures', 'been', 'released', 'Japan', 'OAVs', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'SF', 'literature.The', 'Dirty', 'Pair', 'originally', 'started', 'out', 'SF', 'novels', 'novels', 'are', 'now', 'also', 'available', 'North', 'America', 'being', 'translated', 'brought', 'over', 'Dark', 'Horse', 'publications', 'movies', 'OAVs', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'one', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'left', 'far', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'will', 'recognize', 'impact', 'show', 'Lupin', 'III', 'had', 'anime', 'series', ""'Cowboy"", 'Bebop', 'recommend', 'OAV', 'series', 'collection', 'anyone', 'looking', 'great', 'action/comedy', 'adventures', 'ahem', ""'Lovely"", 'Angels', 'team', 'Kei', 'Yuri']",Original Dirty Pair - Girls With Guns
662117,A1AQ6NT5X4TMX1,B00005KHJA,Matthew Lafrance,"[11, 11]","This is a very nice DVD containing the first 5 episodes of the 10 episode Dirty Pair OAV series. Not to be confused with any of the movies/OAV's previously released by Streamline. The episodes look similar to the TV series in their designs and animation. The pair tackle five more assignments of galactic significance with their usual carefree manner and disregard for property. Much of the fun is in the pair's rocky friendship. The DVD is well done in several regards. The liberties taken with the dub seem largely to add to the charm of the show or at least not detract from it. My big complaint with the dub is the foul language which, though I don't disapprove of itself, is a little overused. The subtitle is more literal and feels competent. Each episode is selectable directly from the main menu and starts from a preview of the episode, which is very convenient when you just want to know which one it is. You can select Japanese, English, or English with Op/End Lyrics which is also a nice feature. Credits appear before and after every episode and the lyrics alternate between translated and romanji. Bonus material includes a text-less opening animation but no closing. The picture looked like it was taken from a quality master. The sound I can't really comment on but it looks like Dolby Digital 2-channel for both English and Japanese and sounded clear to me. The only thing I could think to add might be a gallery of some kind, or some liner notes. This was intended for VHS or LaserDisk viewing and made during the 80's, it's no Mononoke Hime. Taking this into consideration I think this is a great DVD that is worth the money. I give it four stars. I only hope ADV can release the TV series in a similar fashion.
