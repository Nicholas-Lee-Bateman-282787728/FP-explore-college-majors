I remember this being one of the ""UP ALL NIGHT"" films on USA network as a teen.  It was always 2 mintues of movie, then 5 minutes comercials to make it into the 2 hour time slot. Carefree nudity is present, and the sense of nastalgia makes this worth a watch through once, to laugh at how bad acting can be, and to remember the old days of softcore.",3,They don't make them like this anymore,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,528,"['Sure', 'awful', 'movie', 'poor', 'acting', 'thin', 'plot', 'full', 'cliche', 'poorly', 'timed', 'jokes', 'film', 'genre', 'really', 'lost', 'luster', 'past', '10', 'years', 'remember', 'being', 'one', 'UP', 'ALL', 'NIGHT', 'films', 'USA', 'network', 'teen', 'was', 'always', '2', 'mintues', 'movie', 'then', '5', 'minutes', 'comercials', 'make', '2', 'hour', 'time', 'slot', 'Carefree', 'nudity', 'present', 'sense', 'nastalgia', 'worth', 'watch', 'once', 'laugh', 'how', 'bad', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'remember', 'old', 'days', 'softcore']",N/A
300535,A3P867ODHBLJ3U,6302191661,Harry Young,"[2, 3]","I didn't really like this movie that much. The movie is about guys looking at women, taking pictures of them, and peeping through holes watching them take showers. The women look nice in bikinis, and I guess that is suppose to be the premise of movie, the title says so, women in bikinis galore. I don't really remember the movie that much, I guess that's how forgetful it was. It ends with a bikini contest that the cops try to stop, and how it gets resolved seems stupid, and in the end a female cop gets to try on a bikini as if to say the contest wasn't all that corrupt or illegal. Plus, none of the women are really that pretty, though they have nice bodies.",2,Movie Easy To Forget,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,664,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'movie', 'guys', 'looking', 'women', 'taking', 'pictures', 'peeping', 'holes', 'watching', 'take', 'showers', 'women', 'look', 'nice', 'bikinis', 'guess', 'suppose', 'be', 'premise', 'movie', 'title', 'so', 'women', 'bikinis', 'galore', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'movie', 'much', 'guess', 'how', 'forgetful', 'was', 'bikini', 'contest', 'cops', 'try', 'stop', 'how', 'resolved', 'stupid', 'end', 'female', 'cop', 'try', 'bikini', 'say', 'contest', 'was', ""n't"", 'corrupt', 'illegal', 'none', 'women', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'have', 'nice', 'bodies']",N/A

The movie is cheesy, the plot does not exist, and the females are cute. Basically you have a bunch of females wearing next to nothing bikinis and in some scenes they are nude. Only in the last half hour do you have any kind of story what so ever. You are better off renting the movie or ask a friend to make a copy for you.

So in that one way this is better than the sequel.In all other ways, including and especially writing (believe it or not), Bikini Summer 2 is far superior. This is a fun movie and a must have for those who like this genre, but it's not nearly so fun as its successor. Armstrong carries this movie but she is simply one among many in the sequel. Her character's personality also really changes. In this movie she's somewhat mature, the muse for a song writer; in the sequel, everything is irreverent and over the top, much more in line with what you'd expect from the title.",4,Better in one way than the sequel,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,757,"['get', 'see', 'lot', 'Melinda', 'Armstrong', 'mean', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'awesome', 'considering', 'absolutely', 'none', 'thesequel', 'So', 'one', 'way', 'better', 'sequel.In', 'other', 'ways', 'including', 'especially', 'writing', 'believe', 'not', 'Bikini', 'Summer', '2', 'far', 'superior', 'fun', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'who', 'like', 'genre', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'fun', 'successor', 'Armstrong', 'movie', 'simply', 'one', 'many', 'sequel', 'character', 'personality', 'also', 'really', 'changes', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'mature', 'muse', 'song', 'writer', 'sequel', 'everything', 'irreverent', 'top', 'much', 'more', 'line', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'title']",N/A
