I would recommend Sing a Sing of Wiggles as the best nursery rhymes to get if you want only one, and if your child really likes nursery rhymes like mine this is a good followup DVD.",4,Great Nursery Rhymes,1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,330,"['love', 'new', 'school', 'Wiggles', 'video', 'full', 'costumes', 'computer', 'animated', 'backgrounds', 'add', 'ambiance', 'nursery', 'would', 'recommend', 'Sing', 'Sing', 'Wiggles', 'best', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'get', 'want', 'only', 'one', 'child', 'really', 'likes', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'mine', 'good', 'followup', 'DVD']",The Wiggles: Pop Go the Wiggles
1129222,A3OTA04EV3T5DB,B001132GNE,Allison,"[0, 0]","We have about15 Wiggles DVDs. I was looking forward to having a DVD of nursery rhymes that my kids would recognize, but this fell a little short of being a DVD I would watch over and over again like some of the other Wiggles DVDs. Maybe the nursery rhymes they do in this DVD are more traditional to an Australian child as I thought of how many other cool nursery rhymes they could have done that would have held my kids attention better. I am not a fan of the green screen backgrounds either or the saving of money to clone certain characters in songs. I catch that as an adult, but I guess most kids wont. I think the props and simple backgrounds of some of the first Wiggles DVD's catch my children's attention so much better. As we have watched this over the last few months, this DVD has grown on me, but it is not what I wanted it to be and my 17 month old kids don't usually pick this video out first. It's rated at a three star because some of the songs are kind of boring- but hey! It's the Wiggles so it can never be THAT bad!",3,Hoped it would be better,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,1036,"['have', 'about15', 'Wiggles', 'DVDs', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'having', 'DVD', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'kids', 'would', 'recognize', 'fell', 'little', 'short', 'being', 'DVD', 'would', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'other', 'Wiggles', 'DVDs', 'Maybe', 'nursery', 'do', 'DVD', 'are', 'more', 'traditional', 'Australian', 'child', 'thought', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'cool', 'nursery', 'rhymes', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'kids', 'attention', 'better', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'green', 'screen', 'saving', 'money', 'clone', 'certain', 'characters', 'songs', 'catch', 'adult', 'guess', 'most', 'kids', 'wont', 'think', 'props', 'simple', 'backgrounds', 'first', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'catch', 'children', 'attention', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'watched', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'DVD', 'grown', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', '17', 'month', 'old', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'pick', 'video', 'first', 'rated', 'three', 'star', 'songs', 'are', 'kind', 'boring-', 'hey', 'Wiggles', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'bad']",The Wiggles: Pop Go the Wiggles
1129223,A11HGU745RNY3W,B001132GNE,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","First, I just want to say that I was nervous about Greg being replaced by Sam, but have long since decided that I love them both.  (Yes, I do love The Wiggles!)This DVD is fabulous.  I love ""This Old Man"" and Captain Feathersword as a jack-in-the-box for ""Pop Goes the Weasel.""  I probably love the whole DVD.But I wanted to give The Wiggles kudos for the option of watching the video with an ASL interpreter.  For young deaf children who are too young to read, or for parents who want their children exposed to ASL for whatever reason, this is a fantastic option.  (If you want exposure, ""Signing Time"" is an excellent option).  My children are not deaf, though I am.  We have watched the ASL track several times, and the interpreter did a FABULOUS job of interpreting these songs, some of which I consider to be difficult to translate properly in ASL.  The only sign I didn't recognize was ""skip"" but I'm wondering if it could be an Australian sign.  What a joy!We have and have watched many Wiggles DVD's.  The only one I don't really love is Space Dancing, but then, it is the favorite of my older kids.If you're afraid of joining the Wiggles bandwagon, please don't be.  My three-year-old rarely wants to watch anything else, and they really are a gem.  All five of them, counting Greg!",5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!
