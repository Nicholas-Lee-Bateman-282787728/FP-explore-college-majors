Even though there was not much of a plot going on, C & C's skits were very funny. That skit in the welfare office had me in tears, and just looking at C & C's home with its funny signs and bizarre items was also fun. Also, Cheech's ""Mexican American"" song, followed by Chong's song with absurd lyrics was amusing too. I would have been pleased with this movie if it had all been funny skits like these, even if no plot had developed. But the second half of NEXT MOVIE just drags really badly and is not funny any more. I mean, that long section with Cheech driving the car of that rich couple and telling lame jokes - what the %$!!@# was that?! I also found appalling the three instances of suggested or actual animal abuse in the second half of the film. However, for the funny first half, and for Cheech & Chong's irreverent humor, this movie is popular with many of their fans nonetheless.Even though BORN IN EAST L.A. is probably supposed to be the ""filler"" on here, I actually like it a good deal better than the first film. In it, Cheech (without Chong) mistakenly gets deported to Mexico because he doesn't have his I.D. on him, so he spends most of the movie trying all sorts of ways to get back across the border. Although there's no great purpose or plot to the whole thing, there are numerous funny moments. A great running gag is this painting of Jesus in Cheech's home in L.A. that people interpret all sorts of ways. In one hilarious scene, a guy thinks Jesus is talking to him, but actually a phone is behind the painting and Cheech is calling to leave a message on the answering machine for someone to please rescue him in Mexico. While BORN IN EAST L.A. is not a comedy classic, the story holds my interest all the way through, especially because of the funny bits in it and Cheech's sympathetic performance. Incidentally, this movie arose from Cheech's hit song ""Born in East L.A."" that was a spoof of Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the U.S.A.""Both movies are in widescreen and both have decent picture and sound quality. Each movie is on a separate DVD (so 2 DVDs here), but with only the trailers of each film for bonuses. But heck, at the great price, it's worth getting even if you just like ONE of these films.",3,"A Mixed Bag, But Worth It",1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,2298,"['liked', 'basically', 'first', 'half', 'CHEECH', 'AND', 'CHONG', 'NEXT', 'MOVIE', 'Even', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'going', 'C', 'C', 'skits', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'skit', 'welfare', 'office', 'had', 'tears', 'just', 'looking', 'C', 'C', 'home', 'funny', 'signs', 'bizarre', 'items', 'was', 'also', 'fun', 'Also', 'Cheech', 'Mexican', 'American', 'song', 'followed', 'Chong', 'song', 'absurd', 'lyrics', 'was', 'amusing', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'funny', 'skits', 'even', 'plot', 'had', 'developed', 'second', 'half', 'NEXT', 'MOVIE', 'just', 'really', 'badly', 'not', 'funny', 'more', 'mean', 'long', 'section', 'Cheech', 'driving', 'car', 'rich', 'couple', 'telling', 'lame', 'jokes', 'what', '%', '@', 'was', 'also', 'found', 'appalling', 'three', 'instances', 'suggested', 'actual', 'animal', 'abuse', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'However', 'funny', 'first', 'half', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'irreverent', 'humor', 'movie', 'popular', 'many', 'fans', 'nonetheless.Even', 'BORN', 'IN', 'EAST', 'L.A.', 'probably', 'supposed', 'be', 'filler', 'here', 'actually', 'good', 'deal', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'mistakenly', 'deported', 'Mexico', ""n't"", 'have', 'I.D', 'so', 'most', 'movie', 'trying', 'sorts', 'ways', 'get', 'back', 'border', 'great', 'purpose', 'plot', 'whole', 'thing', 'are', 'numerous', 'funny', 'moments', 'great', 'running', 'gag', 'painting', 'Jesus', 'Cheech', 'home', 'L.A.', 'people', 'interpret', 'sorts', 'ways', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'guy', 'thinks', 'Jesus', 'talking', 'actually', 'phone', 'painting', 'Cheech', 'calling', 'leave', 'message', 'answering', 'machine', 'someone', 'please', 'rescue', 'Mexico', 'BORN', 'IN', 'EAST', 'L.A.', 'not', 'comedy', 'classic', 'story', 'interest', 'way', 'especially', 'funny', 'bits', 'Cheech', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'Incidentally', 'movie', 'arose', 'Cheech', 'hit', 'song', 'Born', 'East', 'L.A.', 'was', 'spoof', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Born', 'U.S.A.', 'Both', 'movies', 'are', 'widescreen', 'have', 'decent', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'movie', 'separate', 'DVD', 'so', '2', 'DVDs', 'here', 'only', 'trailers', 'film', 'bonuses', 'heck', 'great', 'price', 'getting', 'even', 'just', 'ONE', 'films']",N/A
