751939,A2TGV7PXYW2TVI,B000094J89,brez,"[0, 1]",Marvin Gaye and the Band give a great performance of a good mix of soul and funk.I hope the sound the audiance heard was better than the sound on this DVD. At first I had to check the setup on my system and I tried the DVD on another DVD player. In the first track Marvin was barely audible and was drowned out by the band. Even the back-up singers were louder. The balance improved a little but Marvin's singing never gets the prominence it should.Three stars is the average of five for performance and one for sound.,3,Great Performance - Bad Sound Mix,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,518,"['Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Band', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'good', 'mix', 'soul', 'funk.I', 'hope', 'sound', 'audiance', 'heard', 'was', 'better', 'sound', 'DVD', 'first', 'had', 'check', 'setup', 'system', 'tried', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'player', 'first', 'track', 'Marvin', 'was', 'barely', 'audible', 'was', 'drowned', 'out', 'band', 'Even', 'back-up', 'singers', 'were', 'louder', 'balance', 'improved', 'little', 'Marvin', 'singing', 'never', 'prominence', 'should.Three', 'stars', 'average', 'five', 'performance', 'one', 'sound']",N/A

It should never have been released without the sound engineers fixing it.He performed masterfully, from what I could see.  He seemed full of confidence, and projected very well, but you could barely hear him.  The background music all but completely drowned him out.I had to return my copy, thinking it was defective, and that the channels were reversed, as happens on occasion, but after reading the other comments, it seems that every copy was the same.There is really no excuse for this to ever happen.  It's beyond quality control - it just smacks of total incompetence.Look at all the trouble people are put to, or some, who keep it, are stuck with such an inferior performance that thay can't possibly feel good about it.",1,Very Disappointed,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,887,"['was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'live', 'concert', 'especially', 'reading', 'DVD', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'was', 'rare', 'virtually', 'non-existent.This', 'was', 'disaster', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'sound', 'fixing', 'it.He', 'performed', 'masterfully', 'what', 'could', 'see', 'seemed', 'full', 'confidence', 'projected', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'barely', 'hear', 'background', 'music', 'completely', 'drowned', 'out.I', 'had', 'return', 'copy', 'thinking', 'was', 'defective', 'channels', 'were', 'reversed', 'happens', 'occasion', 'reading', 'other', 'comments', 'copy', 'was', 'same.There', 'really', 'excuse', 'ever', 'happen', 'quality', 'control', 'just', 'smacks', 'total', 'incompetence.Look', 'trouble', 'people', 'are', 'put', 'who', 'keep', 'are', 'stuck', 'such', 'inferior', 'performance', 'thay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'feel', 'good']",N/A
751942,AHBKHBIWDTI5I,B000094J89,Kevin Mattingly,"[6, 7]","""Live In Montreux"" is one of the best concerts that I've ever seen by ANYONE. Of course that goes with the territory when you're watching and listening to Marvin Gaye.I've got news for some of you folks; it isn't about a slight audio section not sounding as pristine as you might have wanted it to. It's about the fact that Marvin delivers straight up SOUL in a huge way on this dvd. If you're wanting perfection in the content, however, and not the two seconds of audio that you didn't like you should purchase this dvd immediately.All you have to do is check the track listing and imagine Marvin pouring his guts into these songs and you have an inkling of what this concert is all about. I didn't see anyone there complaining!Marvin performs a large variety of his hits and some that are a little more obscure with his utmost passion which is still unrivaled to this day. His banter with the audience is classy and entertaining. He dances with two women in a very sweet way which was probably the high point of their lives. And after a prop malfunction he does the most touching tribute to Tammi Terrell that I've ever seen. I had tears in my eyes and I'm a man.Marvin is backed by an incredible orchestra and even takes a bit of time to play the drums which, if you know anything about Marvin, takes it back to the beginning of his career with Motown.I would give this dvd 10 stars for any music lover.The only negative aspect to this dvd is that it quickly reminds us of what we're missing in music today.Kevin W.

Girl you REALLY played them and it must have been a major treat to tour with the great Marvin Gaye!A friend gave this to me as she KNOWS how much of a major fan I am of this genius (especially after mentioning to her that I was dying to see the live show)!  Yes the audio is not the best, but just to see his presence is ALWAYS a treat for me!  I had the CD to this concert before the DVD and it makes a WORLD of a difference to see him on stage!The band was TIGHT!  And the singers even TIGHTER!  I wish I was one of the two women who got to dance with Marvin!  This is as close to seeing Marvin live I will ever get as I was a little girl when he passed, but by then I was already familiar with him because one of my first record purchases was 1982's SEXUAL HEALING, which sparked my interest in DJing and Marvin Gaye!One of my highlights for me includes a monologue of him receiving a ""phone call"" about his woman cheating during his performance of GRAPEVINE!  It also shows his talent on the keyboards!From the opening to the closing it is worth seeing and adding this to your collection!  An absolute MUST for Marvin fans!",5,WOW!

Right away I was intrigued that Marvin Gaye was part of the famed Montreaux ""Jazz"" Festival.  I really wanted to hear my favorite ""Gotta Give It Up.""  What a wonderful surprise to find it buffed up with a horn section!  Of course, I went straight to Amazon to get a copy.  Amazon didn't disappoint.  A copy was available at a very reasonable price.What surprised me the most was there were 16 other songs.  I couldn't wait to see how Marvin pulled that off.  Another surprise was I thought ""Gotta Give It Up"" was the finale when I saw it on You Tube, because everybody performed to the hilt.  Marvin danced his soul off too.  But, no.  It was the first cut and Marvin, singers, and muscians gave 100% on all the other 16 songs.When Marvin sat down and played the keyboard for ""Trouble Man"" that's when you know why he was invited to Montreaux.
