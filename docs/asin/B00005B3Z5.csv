I liked the American version better.I'm the type who always enjoys seeing the story from different angles, seeing what different directors can do with the same script.

Understandable, the story arc of the original covered in four hours what the American version covered in about sixteen, leaving six hours for additional subplots.For Americans, the Manchester accent does take some practice, and I'm sure I missed some subtile nuances that I'll catch on the next viewing (and there WILL be a next viewing)....If you can choose between this one and the American version, by all means get the American.

Usually, I ALWAYS like the European version of a production much better than the American remake. But not in this case. Maybe it's partly because I saw the U.S. version first, which is more glitzy and glamourous, but the UK version actually bored me. I didn't like the dialogue as much (had nothing to do with the Manchester accents)for one. For another, I kept comparing the Stuart character to the Brian character. Aiden Gillen (as Stuart) can't hold a candle to Gale Harold (as Brian) in the sexiness department. Also, I had a hard time believing that Stuart(that slight somewhat girly guy) was this huge Canal Street Stud! And, I'm used to the strong dance/pop/rock/trance musical backdrop of the U.S. version, instead of that folksy guitar score in the U.K. version.Since I saw the more dramatic, faster paced, glitzier U.S. version first, the U.K. version seemed boring. If I had seen the grittier, slower paced, artsy-er, more realistic U.K. version first, then I would probably think that the U.S. version was too over-the-top.

Many contemporary political and social issues of the gay community are addressed, though this is even more true of the American version. I prefer the British version, and give it a higher mark, because it was the original and carries all the novelty and excitement that only an original can. Furthermore, the music track is superior to that of the American version, and the characters seem more realistic, more human and natural, and less idealized. I refused to watch the American version for a few years due to my disgust that this series was being re-made over again instead of extended with new episodes. This series was the first of its kind in the entire world and was shown on the BBC throughout the kingdom. I am conservative in rating QAF because I fear being biased and over-enthusiastic, and recognize that much of its appeal arises from its novelty. Few television series have been completely gay, and QAF was by far the best and was quite daring and original for its time. Many ideas, opinions and people that appeared seldom, or maybe never, in any other television show in the entire history of television are being explored in QAF.

580225,A2XWBYHQY5MG9,B00005B3Z5,Ian D. Smith,"[42, 43]","I had seen 'Queer As Folk' in its original cut in the U.K., and I was dutifully impressed by how realistic, breezily fun and uncompromising this series was.  As sexy, glitzy and prettily-cast the American version is, it doesn't have the heart or depth of the British original.One of the most obvious things the U.K. version develops better is its characters.  The non-chalant and irresponsible Stuart is not as cut and dry as his American counterpart (though I personally find the American Brian to be more attractive), and the multi-dimensional character is served by a more interesting actor.  The hapless character of Vince, with his babbling unease, obsession with 'Doctor Who' and endearing modesty is never hard to watch, and he is played with absolute earnest by Craig Kelly.  Nathan, as played by Charlie Hunnam (late of Fox's 'Undeclared') is a fresh-faced and honest character with a well developed transformation from innocent boy to more worldly young man.Without the need to stretch stories out for whole seasons at a time, this miniseries is able to spend just enough time on all the fun and serious moments which comprise the plots of these 8 episodes.  While this series isn't as graphic or as dependent on sex as the Showtime version, it certainly has more than its fair share of controversial situations and characters, and as a result it is a far more daring and relevant production.The DVDs are a bare-bones presentation of the series, condensing all 8 episodes into 4, and editing some scenes while severely altering the soundtrack into basically a series of generic (read: cheap) dance tracks.  While the original score is left largely untouched, there is no 'Sexy Boy' or 'It's Raining Men' for instance in the C1 version, which is disappointing to say the least, as the songs chosen for the original soundtrack added so much.  There are no extra features of any kind on the DVD - a scene selection menu and subtitles would have been in order at least.In the end, this is a must-see miniseries, a triumph for television and a tribute not only to the gay lifestyle, but to good old-fashioned smart dialogue and honest characterization.  The skeleton DVD and the annoying C1 edits may diminish things slightly, but not to those who have never seen it before - it's such a compelling and sincerely fun series.  Gritty, frank and unapologetic, the British 'Queer As Folk' is a testament to truth and realism, obscuring nothing but serving to open many eyes.",4,Refreshing Original,1008806400,"12 20, 2001",2001,2476,"['had', 'seen', 'Folk', 'original', 'cut', 'U.K.', 'was', 'dutifully', 'impressed', 'how', 'realistic', 'breezily', 'fun', 'uncompromising', 'series', 'was', 'sexy', 'glitzy', 'prettily-cast', 'American', 'version', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'depth', 'British', 'original.One', 'most', 'obvious', 'things', 'U.K.', 'version', 'better', 'characters', 'non-chalant', 'irresponsible', 'Stuart', 'not', 'cut', 'dry', 'American', 'counterpart', 'personally', 'find', 'American', 'Brian', 'be', 'more', 'attractive', 'multi-dimensional', 'character', 'served', 'more', 'interesting', 'actor', 'hapless', 'character', 'Vince', 'babbling', 'unease', 'obsession', ""'Doctor"", 'Who', 'endearing', 'modesty', 'never', 'hard', 'watch', 'played', 'absolute', 'earnest', 'Craig', 'Kelly', 'Nathan', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'late', 'Fox', ""'Undeclared"", 'fresh-faced', 'honest', 'character', 'well', 'developed', 'transformation', 'innocent', 'boy', 'more', 'worldly', 'young', 'need', 'stretch', 'stories', 'out', 'whole', 'seasons', 'time', 'miniseries', 'able', 'spend', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'fun', 'serious', 'moments', 'comprise', 'plots', '8', 'episodes', 'series', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'dependent', 'sex', 'Showtime', 'version', 'certainly', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'controversial', 'situations', 'characters', 'result', 'far', 'more', 'daring', 'relevant', 'production.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'bare-bones', 'presentation', 'series', 'condensing', '8', 'episodes', '4', 'editing', 'scenes', 'severely', 'altering', 'soundtrack', 'basically', 'series', 'generic', 'read', 'cheap', 'dance', 'tracks', 'original', 'score', 'left', 'largely', 'untouched', ""'Sexy"", 'Boy', 'Raining', 'Men', 'instance', 'C1', 'version', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least', 'songs', 'chosen', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'kind', 'DVD', 'scene', 'selection', 'menu', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'order', 'end', 'must-see', 'miniseries', 'triumph', 'television', 'tribute', 'not', 'only', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'honest', 'characterization', 'skeleton', 'DVD', 'annoying', 'C1', 'edits', 'may', 'diminish', 'things', 'slightly', 'not', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'compelling', 'sincerely', 'fun', 'series', 'Gritty', 'frank', 'unapologetic', 'British', 'Folk', 'testament', 'truth', 'realism', 'obscuring', 'nothing', 'serving', 'open', 'many', 'eyes']",Queer as Folk British TV Series  VHS

580227,A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX,B00005B3Z5,Ian Phillips,"[3, 4]","When Queer As Folk catapulted onto British television in 1999, I was 19 years old and had only just ""come out of the closet"" to family and friends. Quite strange that immediately afterwards, this show began its 8 episode run on the Britsih network, Channel 4. It all seemed so parallel to what I was going through at that time and if anything was a real eye opener for me as then just being a naieve, innocent 19 year old.Of course the opening episode sparked off outrage from critics and even the governement were not happy with the graphic content of the series with even talk of the series being taken off the air. I have a message to them - its simple, just switch t.v channels! The obvious level of concern stemmed from one of the characters wittingly seen having sex with a mere 15 year old schoolboy. No matter how immoral these situations seem, they do inevitably occur and thats all the writer of the series, Russell Davies was intending to draw upon.The action is set in the heart of Manchester, namely Canal Street, a gay village thats awashed with nightclubs and gay bars. I, myself live in Bolton, a few miles away from Manchester and have to say I absolutely love Canal Street and is not a bit unlike how it seems in the series. The night life is positively buzzing, the music always divine and certainly there are always some interesting characters to meet. Myself and a large group of friends regularly hit Canal Street every weekend and dance the night away at bars such as The Union, Mantos, Via Fosser, Metz and Hollywood Showbar, most of which are seen in this series.The absolutely drop-dead gorgeous Aidan Gillen plays Stuart, an arrogant, unlikeable character who is nearing thirty and has yet to come out of the closet to his parents. Despite how nasty he can become you can almost forgive all from his sheer good looks. In the first episode he scores the night with 15 year old schoolboy, Nathan Maloney. There are some graphic sex scenes with these pair of characters and if you're offended by homeosexuality in any way, its probably best you avoid the series full stop. As the series progresses, Aidan conveys a more two dimensional character, showing that Stuart was infact lonely and screwed up, which most likely stemmed from fear of telling his parents that he was gay. The role is played well and beleavably.Craig Kelly plays the much more likeable, Vince Tyler, whose bubbly personality really shines through and is a fun part in the series. His laughable obsession with Doctor Who and his frequent bad luck whenever he takes a man home for a spot of passion, makes amusing viewing and his timing is impeccable. Its made blatantly obvious from episode 1 that Stuart is madly in love with Stuart, who he has been best friends with since the age of 12. However his affections are sadly not returned by Stuart who prefers to sleep around with the entire gay village rather than settling down into a relationship.Charlie Hunnam takes the role of 15 year old, Nathan Maloney who is struggling to cometo terms with his homeosexuality and most likely had a host of teenagers identifying with his character. He literally crow bars his way onto the infamous gay scene in Manchester and becomes unhealthily obsessed with Stuart. Charlie plays the naieve schoolboy well and beleavably and causes some amusement throughout the series.Amongst the rest of the cast includes Denise Black as Vince's fun-loving, down-to-earth mother, Hazel and is utterly fantastic in the role, conveying a likeable two dimensional character. Her witty one-liners and timing is superb and injects a refreshingly fun side to the series. Carla Henry also causes some amusement as Nathans best friend, Donna, whose loyalty to Nathan is actually quite touching.The first four episodes are seemingly fun and games, following the gang as they plod along Canal Street and inevitably touches on prejudice towads gay men. There is a much darker undertone in episode 3 where the character, Phil, overdoses on heroin. In episode 4, the scene of the funeral takes place and is played out almost like black comedy.From episode 5, the series settles down and concentrates on a host of subplots that all shrewdly link up to the final in the series such as centering on Vinces relationship with a sueve Australian businessman, played by Aussie T.V veteran, Peter O' Brian and Stuarts troubled relationship with his family.The writing is impeccable as are all the performances. Many fun and games to endure as well as moments of genuinely compelling drama. Russell Davies shrewd observation on gay life is overly accurate but in no way is this the be all and end all to how gay men live so view it with an open mind. One of the fun aspects of the series are the characterisations where any gay man will be able to identify with at least one of them.On the whole an impressive series, thats certainly colourful, has many laughs to enjoy and is accompanied by a sizzling soundtrack. The ambience of the nightclubs and drug culture are shrewdly evoked. Without doubt, a classic!",5,Superb Gay Drama,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,5058,"['When', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'catapulted', 'British', 'television', '1999', 'was', '19', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'only',

580228,A35XFZN4MWNKK4,B00005B3Z5,ianphillips@uk.dreamcast.com,"[6, 6]","Queer As Folk is an explosive look at the gay lifestyle as lived in Manchester, England (which is where I actually live and I absolutley love Canal Street). The series was surrounded by a blaze of controversy after the first episode with some of the most graphic, gay scenes shown on British Network Television. The obvious outrage from critics came in the fact that it showed a 29 year gay man having sex with a mere 15 year old. But these situations, however immoral they may seem, do occur and the writers rightly intended to focus on thses subjects. So what emerges are eight grittily realistic episodes with fine blends of comedy mixed in giving it a great balance and these were undoubtedly the ingredients to its smash hit success.The absolutley drop dead gorgeous, Aiden Gillen has the most lengthy role of Stuart Jones. In his startling realistic portrayal he conveys two sides to Stuart - the cocky, arrogant gay man with a chip on his shoulder about being gay, and a side to him that showed that there was just a lonley, screwed up man inside who feared telling his parents and was therefore seemingly blackmailed by his sister. If there were not these two dimensions to the character it possibly would'nt have worked so Aiden Gillen gets top marks for his role although the other two players show their own versatality with Craig kelly as Vince Tyler providing some of the more humorous and lighthearted moments. His fascination with Doctor Who and his continual bad luck when ever he takes a man home for a night of passion are hilarious at times. It's a very likeable and beleavable performance whilst Charlie Hunnam's portrayal of 15 year old Nathan Maloney who had just come out of the closet most likely had a host of young teenagers in the closet idntifying with his character. The character of Nathan is out the closet with a vengeance and is obviously still confused but is seemingly desperate to ease his way into the gay scene. Notably other good performances comes from Carla Henry as Nathans loyal friend, Donna, who raises a smile with her feel good factor and Denise Black as Vince's fun loving, down to earth mother, Hazel Tyler. She is also an essential part of the series who provides a lot of the laughs.The first four episodes of the series is a lot of fun and games although it has a darker undertone where the character, Phil, overdoses on heroin whilst the funeral of Phil that takes place in episode 4 is played out almost like black comedy. The second half of the series seems to settle down into storylines that build to the final such as centering on vince's relationship with an  Aussie business man, played by Peter 'O Brian.Writer Russell T Davies strikingly realistic view of the gay lifestyle is immpecable and that is complimented by the great team of actors involved and as far as i'm concerned if people are that outraged by it then 1) Why watch it in the first place and 2) If they're offended then its simple - just switch channels!! It was a very welcome and pleasant change to have a series focusing on the lives of gay men especially tp a series that seemed overly accurate. Any gay man will be able to identify with one of the characters and this is where a lot of the enjoyment comes in.However Quuer As Folk 2 pales slightly in comparison to the first series. It's a two part special concluding the series and there are some fine moments and performances are great but the gritty realism that was part of the first series is slightly lost and the ending where Stuart and Vince finally get together is great as fantasy but you can't truly believe in it. Adequate is the best way of describing the sequel but the first series is a masterpiece and a true classic, accompanied by a sizzling soundtrack.

Their tone is more pervasively working class and mercifully less psychobabbly. The acting is, in the main, fine. It is a modest effort that succeeds modestly. However, I find the casting significantly flawed to the point that it detracts from believability..... and one cannot suspend disbelief in a show so &quot;realistically&quot; accesorised. Stuart, the character at the center of things, the UK's original for our Brian, just isn't &quot;drop dead gorgeous&quot; nor does he pair well with Nathan (the Brit version of our principal twink). Physicality intrudes..... Nathan, young Charlie Hunnam, is tall and Aiden Gillen is medium to short ..... Their Brian just does not seem written as comanding or interesting as ours, and has been cast small ... whatever possessed them? Mr. Gillen's  size and demeanor detract from an already palely-written central character.... no hint of the force or magnetism such central character is attributed by everyone else. Thus there is a fatal weakness at the core (note: Mr. Gillen may be a fine actor, but I think he is totally, and for the series, fatally miscast). If the American series had not come along, I probably would have viewed this one differently..... I am grateful the Brits did it. But now it truly deserves gratitude and most definitely second place.

Unlike most similar ensemble attempts, there are serious, substantial linkings out to the men's families, workplaces, schools, and lesbian friends. This produces a well-rounded depiction of contemporary gay male life in the U.K. and a sense of the variety of responses and accommodations gays and straights make for one another.The core of the drama is the ostensibly unrequited love retail manager Vince Tyler (played by Craig Kelly) has for long-time friend, publicist and seduction phenom Stuart Jones (played by Aidan Gillen). The drama kicks off with the coming out of 15 year old student Nathan Maloney (played by Charlie Hunnam), who starts off with Stuart, irritating Vince. Complications, subplots, and a variety of potential love interests all intertwine, coming to a satisfying conclusion to Series One. Series Two continues the Series One story reasonably well.The Manchester accent and some local slang appear throughout. Some replays may be needed to get the exact words spoken. There is a script book (with photos) available of the detailed, pre-shooting script. The TV/video/DVD final version has a number of small improvements on the original. You might check it out.The major actors are all brilliant. Surprisingly, the minor actors are too. The plot lines are all reasonable enough, the characters evolve plausibly, and actors look and play their ages. Production values and photography are first rate.

580231,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005B3Z5,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","QUEER AS FOLKThat is a series that can only be British. I remember in the early 60s, or is it slightly later, a theater that played one big success in London at the time in Charring Cross Road, ""No sex Please, we are British"". Times have changed and this series is quite typical of that change. Sex, sex and sex, stopping one inch from hardcore sex, and gay what's more. And yet that film is a lot more than these few erotic episodes. First it is deeply committed to diversity in sexual orientation. All the nuances and shades of gayness are exploited and shown in the most funny and comical way, never derisive, never aggressive, but always in a comic orientation of its own. You cannot imagine the diversity of shades and personalities you may or might find in this community. In fact you have to dip yourself in it, or even soak yourself in it to know. But be careful though to know what you're doing otherwise it might become another famous play on Charring Cross Road, viz. ""The Mousetrap"". Second it strikingly confront the problem of age in a sexual community that is too often marked by transience and instability, especially since these couples are not recognize by the law and do not have the right to marry and create a stable home. That implies gay people are more or less forced to cruise all their life, to be the hunter or to be the prey. That is so clearly shown with the main character who is practically never having two helpings of the same dish. But that is true till a fifteen year old boy he seduces decides to ask for more insistently. That makes the main hero Stuart think maybe he is losing something that will never come back, his youth and he maybe should think of the future and not only of the present, or at most the balance of the hunt and how many people, I mean men and boys, he has shagged. But Stuart has another problem with his childhood friend, Vince, who is gay too, who would like to get Stuart or who would like Stuart to get him, but he is shy and he does not want to find himself involved in the great unstable sexual looting of the vast world. So he gets attached to an older man and this episode, both for Stuart and his friend Vince, is a revelation, an epiphany. They discover they have something in common that they cannot find at all with anyone else, and that is exemplified with the various actors who played Doctor Who. They have a past in common, a tremendous level of personal commitment to each other, generally called friendship, and a sexual attraction and even passion they can easily release, provided they get away from their common environment that is a mousetrap to them, viz. Manchester. Third the series does not hesitate to show what sex is for young male teenagers (fifteen or so) and here the fifteen year old boy, Nathan, is our study case. Nathan, is the living example of that age. Provocative and yet shy, exhibitionistic and yet modest, passionate and yet reserved, light-headed by principle and yet over-thoughtful. In fact he knows one thing: he wants sex. He knows a second thing: he wants gay sex. He finds danger and difficulties exciting, so why not try the macho jock at school who is of course both straight and homophobic, even if... when he closes his eyes and lets himself go, he may accept a helping hand. But this young chick, Nathan, has to learn one thing: Stuart is too old for him. He, Nathan, can only be some kind of a cherry on a pile of ice-cream for Stuart's birthday or any other celebration. But he has nothing in common with Stuart except his sex and his sexual attraction and orientation. And that's the meaning of the second series.

Most everyone who watched the American version immediately believed that Justin and Brian were (could be) deeply in love.

The British version inspired the American but I never connected with a single character on that show.  I found myself hitting fast forward out of boredom.  I would highly recommend that everyone watch all 5 seasons of the US version before watching the British series.

I won't say the British series is &quot;less of&quot; in any way. Both versions have their merits but an All-American gay boy coming from the US will most certainly relate much better with the US version simply because of &quot;culture&quot; which in-turn will make it far more entertaining and easier to understand. I wouldn't say making something easier to understand ""dumb downed.&quot; That's just a cheap shot as far as I am concerned in doing a fair review.

Education seems to be the main focus for this series as many of it's stars and producers... convey in their chat interviews. The US version is most certainly made to educate and entertain, which it most certainly does. The British version (although educates somewhat) seems more in tune to entertain the audience. Rightly so! The British version broke new ground and pushed the envelope on the way Europeans watch prime time TV. That's something that will probably never happen in America-so BRAVO for the UK! If you really want to have a smidgen of understanding the &quot;core&quot; story, I suggest you purchase the first 8 episode DVD British version first and then start watching the more amplified characterization in the US version. You'll see why the US series is quickly becoming one of the most popular and most successful television shows in history.

Finally, I'm always scared by films and television from the U.K. because the regional accents are often indecipherable to my Yankee ear.  Anyway, I bought it and I'm glad I did.First, I had no problem with the accents or the regional idioms.  All the &quot;shagging&quot; and &quot;wanking&quot; wore off on me a bit, actually.

The point is, it's how the story's told that really sells this.The ensemble cast, led by Aiden Gillen, Craig Kelly, and Charlie Hunnam is terrific.

As Stuart, Aiden Gillen, for example, plays a character who &quot;doesn't even have to work for it.&quot;  But it's not so much that he's a god, physically, it's rather his attitude, which is so much more complicated than the voracious party boy he pretends to be.  Craig Kelly broke my heart as Vince, Stuart's best friend, who apparently has been smitten by Stuart since they were both 12.  And Charlie Hunnam swipes every scene he's in as Nathan, the 15 year old who starts out as a victim-waiting-to-happen, and ends up a hero, both to himself and to his adopted community.  The setting is realistic too:  straight people who run the gamut from insane homophobes to fellow-travelers; and gay people who have carved for themselves a community, but who have also found out that the world isn't &quot;Will and Grace&quot; and liberation is an inside job.This show never panders to those who want easy or politically correct answers, or who want everything to be tied up nicely in a bow.  Instead, it overflows with insight.  Inthe U.S. version, this seems mere melodrama.  Here, it works on so many dramatic levels.  One of the best things to be said about it is that it truly is &quot;made for t.v.&quot;  Which is to say that it totally exploits and expands the medium.  I could no more imagine this on the big screen than on the stage.  It does, in other words, everything that T.V. should do and none of the things it shouldn't.There's a lot of sex in the show, some of it more steamy than most U.S. viewers have ever seen on the tube (not counting HBO), but it's never played for shock value.  It propels the story.  It's honest. And yes, it's erotic.So the bottom line is, this is a very fine show, and you're not likely to see it if you don't buy it.  So if you *can* afford it, you probably should.",5,Go Ahead.

580246,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B00005B3Z5,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[2, 2]","I admit I am a self-obsessed fan of the American version of ""Queer as Folk"". I discovered the series in its second year when it was originally broadcast on Canada's ""Showtime"" network and it has become my favorite television show of all-time. I never thought a series about a bunch of gay men living in Pittsburg would replace shows like ""Here's Lucy"", ""Bewitched"", and ""The Golden Girls"" in my heart. but ""Queer as Folk"" has. I have seen me watch the series over and over, sort of what Annie Wilkes does in ""Misery"" with her novels, but thankfully I don't think I am disturbed as Annie; I hope not anyway! So, I recently borrowed a friends box set of the original ""Queer as Folk"" and I have to say that version is excellent too from its daring storylines to the superb acting. What I find interesting is how Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman were able to Amercianize ""Queer as Folk"" for their North American audience by staying true to the series' original bible. It's also neat to compare both versions to see how close the American ""Queer as Folk"" is to the original. This is evident in the pilot episodes as we meet a young teen entering the gay village of a large metropolitan city where he meets an older and successful man who changes his life forever. While there the teen also meets, through his new love interest, various friends and relatives, and it is through the teen that we as an audience are taken on this journey of what gay life is really like.I was a little worried about the strong British dialect of ""Queer as Folk"", but this is a very minor issue as once your immersed into the stories you forget all about the english accents. The original ""Queer as Folk"" really wasn't a series, but a mini-series in American terms as only 10 episodes were filmed for the two year run.This particular box set is long out-of-print and very expensive to purchase from private collectors, but the good news is the studio that owns the original ""Queer as Folk"" is releasing the entire series again in one complete set in the summer of 2011.
