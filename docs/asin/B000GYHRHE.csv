The film follows former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney on her search for the truth concerning the voting irregularities in both the Florida 2000 and Ohio 2004 elections.McKinney is nothing if not controversial. She takes on the government, big corporations, and the media in order to get at what she believes is the truth. In this aspect her work needs to be applauded. The thesis that there is a concentrated effort to diminish Black and Latino votes is a relevant one which needs more discussion.The film is a powerful one that makes its viewers think. The problem with a film of this type is that it is often not seen by a large segment of the population. This is a small film that is worth looking for.

What is so shockingly exposed is the rampant racism and outright criminality that pervades every aspect of the American Political system.I don't feel this film is in any way insincere or short with the truth. It simply shows first hand the abuses that certain Americans face when they want to perform their inalienable rights.This is not solely about race but rather epidemic corruption. The black electorate being deprived of their votes is simply one of the many tools by which the Bush administration can consolidate its power and wealth. Cynthia McKinney was not political lynched because she is black but rather because she questioned the Bush administration and their knowledge of the attacks on 9/11.The fact that American blacks are constantly maligned and disenfranchised in modern America is appallingly obvious. The treatment of blacks in New Orleans being a perfect example. What is so striking is how little integration seems to have worked in America and how separatism is the given norm. Racism seems to have become an even greater problem than it has ever been before and part of the responsibility for this sorry state of affairs has to rest at the feet of the intolerant and insuppressible Bush administration.I absolutely recommend this well-made documentary but I assume it has a small but enlightened audience.,5,Shocking expose of rampant Political Corruption,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,1417,"['American', 'Blackout', 'incredibly', 'enlightening', 'documentary', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'What', 'so', 'shockingly', 'exposed', 'rampant', 'racism', 'outright', 'criminality', 'aspect', 'American', 'Political', 'system.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'way', 'insincere', 'short', 'truth', 'simply', 'first', 'hand', 'abuses', 'certain', 'Americans', 'face', 'when', 'want', 'perform', 'inalienable', 'rights.This', 'not', 'solely', 'race', 'rather', 'epidemic', 'corruption', 'black', 'electorate', 'being', 'deprived', 'votes', 'simply', 'one', 'many', 'tools', 'Bush', 'administration', 'can', 'consolidate', 'power', 'wealth', 'Cynthia', 'McKinney', 'was', 'not', 'political', 'lynched', 'black', 'rather', 'questioned', 'Bush', 'administration', 'knowledge', 'attacks', '9/11.The', 'fact', 'American', 'blacks', 'are', 'constantly', 'maligned', 'disenfranchised', 'modern', 'America', 'appallingly', 'obvious', 'treatment', 'blacks', 'New', 'Orleans', 'being', 'perfect', 'example', 'What', 'so', 'striking', 'how', 'little', 'integration', 'have', 'worked', 'America', 'how', 'separatism', 'given', 'norm', 'Racism', 'have', 'become', 'even', 'greater', 'problem', 'ever', 'been', 'before', 'part', 'responsibility', 'sorry', 'state', 'affairs', 'rest', 'feet', 'intolerant', 'insuppressible', 'Bush', 'administration.I', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'well-made', 'documentary', 'assume', 'small', 'enlightened', 'audience']",American Blackout

It does a good job of showing how there is still widespread discrimination in the electoral process. It also shows how the mainstream media tries to subvert any meaningful discussion of the topic. Rep. McKinney is one of the few members of Congress who has consistently attempted to have a thorough investigation of the way elections are carried out in the this country. This is not a partisan issue in any way to her. It is a human rights issue and an American issue. Even her own party has abandoned her on many occasions.The documentary traces her political career up until her defeat this past election. The wonderful thing about it is that it is not so much a biography of Rep. McKinney, but also an investigation as to the problems with the election system. There are some enlightening bits about the way the media distorts and censors people who speak out against unchecked power.The extras are interesting because they delve into her mishap with Capitol Hill Police and show segments deleted from the final film. There is an interview with four Capitol Hill Policemen who discuss the racism inherent in the department, and gives added perspective on the incident involving Rep. McKinney. The deleted scenes address such topics as AIPAC and the way the media covers politics and war. There are also some other extras that add value to the package.Anyone who wants to get to know what makes Rep. McKinney tick should watch this film.
