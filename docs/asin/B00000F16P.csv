496612,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00000F16P,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","Warning: ""Ganja and Hess"" is not your traditional, cliched vampire film. In fact, there's little about this haunting, confusing movie that IS in any way ordinary -- it's a fragmented, weird movie painted in a surreal palette. Director/writer/actor Bill Gun crams this strange movie with feverish visions and Christian symbolism, and while it frequently doesn't make sense it's still hypnotic.Anthropologist Dr. Hess Green (Jones) had been ancient civilization of Myrthia, and upon returning home he hangs out with his unbalanced research assistant George. Then George goes insane, stabs him with an ancient bone knife, and then kills himself. But Hess doesn't die -- he immediately heals and develops a craving for blood.Enter Ganja (Marlene Clark), George's beautiful wife. She and Hess fall madly in love and happily stays with him as the new mistress of his house... and then, of course, she finds out his dirty little secret, as well as her hubby's body. What is ahead for Ganja and Hess, and how long can a vampire live with his own conscience?By the usual standards, ""Ganja and Hess"" is a failure -- there's no linear storytelling, no ""hero"" or ""villain"" characters, it doesn't explain anything, and I didn't know what was going on for pretty much the first half of the movie (seriously, who's the masked white guy?). Presumably that's why the idiot producers of this movie chopped it up and redistributed it as a wildly different movie.But even though it's slow, choppy and often confusing, ""Ganja and Hess"" is absolutely hypnotic. Bill Gunn's hazy, feverish, slow-moving direction leaves you feeling like you're on a magnificent drug trip, drifting through the increasingly chaotic life of cultured ""vampires."" And the growing sense of horror in this movie is kept subtle, such as when Hess kills a young prostitute for her blood while her baby cries in his crib.And at the same time, he deftly folds in fragments of African culture, powerful Christian belief (specifically, the blood of Christ vs. the bloodlust), and drug addiction (Hess's craving for blood is like a junkie's).But the movie would collapse like a house of cards if it weren't for Duane Jones and Marlene Clark. Both of them give absolutely stunning performances that carry the film through from start to finish. Clark is brilliantly feisty and strong-willed as Ganja, and she's so beautiful that you can't look away; Jones gives a spellbinding performance as a man torn between his primal bloodlust and his conscience.""Ganja and Hess"" is not for people who are looking for another ""Twilight"" -- it's an arty, befuddling movie that still manages to suck you in.

496614,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00000F16P,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[14, 18]","Bill Gunn's Ganja and Hess, originally released in 1973, has had a checkered career, to say the least.  It was chopped, slashed, re-edited, and re-released no less than FIVE times throughout the 70s and 80s with five additional titles--very likely a record.  Its original length of 110 minutes was sliced down to 78 minutes by Fima Novick in the original chopped version (Blood Couple), but as Tim Lucas points out in his terrific essay included in this DVD release, Novick introduced a few elements missing from the original that were actually helpful in clarifying the action.This DVD release is the full director's cut and that is all to the good.  Yet this version of the film is hard to follow unless you have some backstory.  For example, without knowing that the main character, a black intellectual, Hess Green, somehow came across a Myrthian dagger and then accidentally (or is it on purpose?) was scratched or stabbed with it by his assistant, George Meda (played by the director himself)--AND that this dagger's touch can bring on vampirism--you would never know how Hess got to be the way he was.  The scene in which this is supposedly revealed has such vague exposition that it leaves you scratching your head trying to figure out how things got from point A to point B.Yet the film also boasts some brilliant dream imagery, some of the best in any film from the 70s, if not since then as well.  These dream scenes give the film tremendous power.But the dream scenes are juxtaposed with other scenes that seem somewhat too long for their purpose, or that don't really go anywhere.  For example, in one scene, deleted from the chopped version, Hess talks to his son--who looks to be about 13 or 14--speaking in French to him, asking him about his studies at his private school.  This is no doubt meant to bring out Hess' social and intellectual standing as a man of culture and refinement.  But the son is never seen in the rest of the film and the scene seems completely isolated from the rest of the movie.In another scene, Hess visits a white woman from a trashy part of town.  It's obvious what the purpose of the visit is, and this is no doubt to bring out Hess' conflicted character.  This does work to some extent, in that later on, he goes to church, supposedly for absolution based on his deeds, but there is too much fragmentation of purpose working in this film to make it cohere.It's a fascinating failure.  Ganja Meda, played by Marlene Clark, is another frustratingly developed character.  She discovers her husband, George, is dead, but while suspicion definitely points to Hess as the perpetrator, she's walks around mad for a couple of minutes and then is lovey-dovey with him.There are threads here that do fit together and make sense and cohere and there are just as many that don't.  This is not an easily followed film, nor one that lacks intelligence.  With greater coherence, it could have been a brilliant film.  As it is, it is an intriguing, seriously flawed work that comes this close to being an amazing, resonant film.",3,"Peculiar, intriguing, confusing",1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,3059,"['Bill', 'Gunn', 'Ganja', 'Hess', 'originally', 'released', '1973', 'had', 'checkered', 'career', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'chopped', 'slashed', 're-edited', 're-released', 'less', 'FIVE', 'times', '70s', '80s', 'five', 'additional', 'titles', 'very', 'likely', 'record', 'original', 'length', '110', 'minutes', 'was', 'sliced', 'down', '78', 'minutes', 'Fima', 'Novick', 'original', 'chopped', 'version', 'Blood', 'Couple', 'Tim', 'Lucas', 'out', 'terrific', 'essay', 'included', 'DVD', 'release', 'Novick', 'introduced', 'few', 'elements', 'missing', 'original', 'were', 'actually', 'helpful', 'clarifying', 'action.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'full', 'director', 'cut', 'good', 'version', 'film', 'hard', 'follow', 'have', 'backstory', 'example', 'knowing', 'main', 'character', 'black', 'intellectual', 'Hess', 'Green', 'somehow', 'came', 'Myrthian', 'dagger', 'then', 'accidentally', 'purpose', 'was', 'scratched', 'stabbed', 'assistant', 'George', 'Meda', 'played', 'director', 'dagger', 'touch', 'can', 'bring', 'vampirism', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'Hess', 'got', 'be', 'way', 'was', 'scene', 'supposedly', 'revealed', 'such', 'vague', 'exposition', 'scratching', 'head', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'things', 'got', 'point', 'point', 'B.Yet', 'film', 'also', 'brilliant', 'dream', 'imagery', 'best', 'film', '70s', 'not', 'then', 'as', 'well', 'dream', 'scenes', 'give', 'film', 'tremendous', 'dream', 'scenes', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'other', 'scenes', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'too', 'long', 'purpose', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'deleted', 'chopped', 'version', 'Hess', 'talks', 'son', 'who', 'be', 'about', '13', '14', 'speaking', 'French', 'asking', 'studies', 'private', 'school', 'doubt', 'meant', 'bring', 'out', 'Hess', 'social', 'intellectual', 'standing', 'man', 'culture', 'refinement', 'son', 'never', 'seen', 'rest', 'film', 'scene', 'completely', 'isolated', 'rest', 'movie.In', 'scene', 'Hess', 'white', 'woman', 'trashy', 'part', 'town', 'obvious', 'what', 'purpose', 'visit', 'doubt', 'bring', 'out', 'Hess', 'conflicted', 'character', 'work', 'extent', 'later', 'church', 'supposedly', 'absolution', 'based', 'deeds', 'too', 'much', 'fragmentation', 'purpose', 'working', 'film', 'make', 'fascinating', 'failure', 'Ganja', 'Meda', 'played', 'Marlene', 'Clark', 'frustratingly', 'developed', 'character', 'husband', 'George', 'dead', 'suspicion', 'definitely', 'Hess', 'perpetrator', 'walks', 'mad', 'couple', 'minutes', 'then', 'lovey-dovey', 'are', 'threads', 'here', 'do', 'fit', 'together', 'make', 'sense', 'cohere', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'easily', 'followed', 'film', 'one', 'intelligence', 'greater', 'coherence', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'film', 'intriguing', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'work', 'close', 'being', 'amazing', 'resonant', 'film']",Ganja & Hess

It's execution is amaturish and it's plot is hopelessly muddled (except of course if you view plot as something that just interferes with the artist making his point).

496620,A27WSLVJ8WJF86,B00000F16P,"Troy M. Ros ""rastacat1""","[6, 8]","This is an odd movie to say the least. Dr. Hess Green (Duane Jones) acquires the ""addiction"" from a ceremony while travelling in Africa and becomes, basically, a vampire. Not your standard fictional vampire mind you, but someone who has a hunger for blood and cannot die. After that, all similarities with your standard vampire end. He walks in the daylight, sleeps in a bed, goes to church and does not have fangs. He lives on a large estate and has a butler and chauffeur who take care of him. There is a bit of narration from the butler who knows about the doctor's affliction, but it is mostly to get us up to speed at the beginning of the film. A ways into the film Ganja (Marlene Clark) comes to stay with Dr. Hess. She finds evidence of strange goings on and tells Hess an interesting story from her childhood. Somehow this leads to their getting married and him performing the ceremony on her to give her the same affliction he has.There are parts of the film that have a lot of dialog and then other parts that have very little, if any. There are also some extended scenes from a gospel singing church that look more like a documentary than a fictional vampire movie. Flashback scenes are interspersed with dream sequences and at times it is difficult to tell if it is present reality or a dream. There are a few violent scenes where the doctor feeds including one at a whorehouse where he somewhat violently kills his victim and laps up the blood that has spilled. In another scene he robs a medical clinic, walking away with their supply of blood in his leather satchel.I can't say that this is a great movie, but it is somewhat entertaining, if not a little slow. When the film was first screened the producers were disappointed that it was not a traditional ""blaxpoitation"" film and cut it down from 110 minutes to 78 minutes. It bombed and was soon forgotten.All Day Entertainment released the fully restored dvd to much fanfare from fans of the movie back in 1998 and it is still in release.
