With that characterization as his point of departure, Claude Lelouch (who produced, wrote and directed this quiet masterpiece) provides an utterly sophisticated two hour cinematic meditation on all of the subtle ways reality, memory, and dreamlife intersect to create the verisimilitude of the present and a fantasy of what is to come. The narrative for this visually breathtaking excursion into metaphysics and the psychology of love centers on Jeremy Irons as Valentin Valentin (he was born on Valentine's Day), a whimsically inventive jewel thief who relies on disguise and deception to ply his trade. But a large and growing tumor of the brain is playing its own set of tricks on the master illusionist. In a parallel universe Valentin's destiny is tracked by that of a Parisian chanteuse, Jane Lester (Patricia Kaas), who also may be afflicted with a brain mass that is affecting her ability to discern what is real from what is imagined. The two cross paths in Fez at the halfway point of the film as each in their own way runs aground upon the hallucinatory shores of the primitive, light-blasted landscape which is Morocco. And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen is European cinema at its most disarming. Evocative and convincing, the film propels you on a journey you would rather not see come to an end.",5,What Is The Dream and What Is Simply A Memory Of The Future?,1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,1421,"['Now', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'following', 'epigraph', 'Life', 'deep', 'sleep', 'love', 'dream', 'characterization', 'point', 'departure', 'Claude', 'Lelouch', 'who', 'produced', 'wrote', 'directed', 'quiet', 'masterpiece', 'utterly', 'sophisticated', 'two', 'hour', 'cinematic', 'meditation', 'subtle', 'ways', 'reality', 'memory', 'dreamlife', 'intersect', 'create', 'verisimilitude', 'present', 'fantasy', 'what', 'come', 'narrative', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'excursion', 'metaphysics', 'psychology', 'love', 'centers', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Valentin', 'Valentin', 'was', 'born', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'whimsically', 'inventive', 'jewel', 'thief', 'who', 'disguise', 'deception', 'ply', 'trade', 'large', 'growing', 'tumor', 'brain', 'playing', 'own', 'set', 'tricks', 'master', 'illusionist', 'parallel', 'universe', 'Valentin', 'destiny', 'tracked', 'Parisian', 'chanteuse', 'Jane', 'Lester', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'who', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'afflicted', 'brain', 'mass', 'affecting', 'ability', 'discern', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imagined', 'two', 'cross', 'paths', 'Fez', 'halfway', 'point', 'film', 'own', 'way', 'hallucinatory', 'shores', 'primitive', 'light-blasted', 'landscape', 'Morocco', 'Now', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'European', 'cinema', 'most', 'disarming', 'Evocative', 'convincing', 'film', 'propels', 'journey', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'see', 'come', 'end']",N/A

784144,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0000UJLF0,Galina,"[7, 7]","Claude Lelouch's ""And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen"" ... (2002) tries tobe a lot of things. It has the elements of romance, thriller, and dramaand much more. It could be called ""Another Man and Another Woman 36years later"" and it takes us to London, Paris, and Morocco. Asuccessful and creative jewel thief Valentin (Jeremy Irons) sails alonearound the world. The fate brings him to Morocco where he meets a nightsinger Jean (Patricia Kaas) who hopes to escape from the heartache ofthe failed affair. They both suffer from blackouts and amnesia that maybe caused by brain tumors - of course, they were meant to meet. Theywill seek the way to save their lives and then change them.The movie is beautiful to look at, and the songs that Patricia Kaassings are wonderful, the best asset of the movie. I read that Kaas'salbum ""Piano Bar"", a hand-picked collection of the popular love songsinspired Lelouch to make this movie where Kaas debuted as an actress.I've heard her singing before and I like her a lot. I also think thather screen debut was successful. Her songs kept the movie togetherbecause there were too many stories intermingling and even though theywere all interesting and compelling, it was not just easy to keep trackof all them.There was one bitter-sweet moment when I realized that the actress whoplayed a countess in Morocco's hotel and whose jewels were stolen in avery manner Valentin would do, was Claudia Cardinale, yes, The ClaudiaCardinale. She is still a beautiful woman but the first thought thatcame to my mind was, ""What does time do to all of us?""""And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen"" was fun while it lasted.

784145,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000UJLF0,Grady Harp,"[32, 35]","Claude Lelouche has once again teamed with Michel Legrand to continue his examination of the vagaries of love in AND NOW LADIES &amp; GENTLEMEN.  There is a Gallic magic about Lelouche's view of love that is irresistible and this rather long film journey is no exception.  Jeremy Irons is a thief who creates sophisticated heists of jewels by adopting disguises.  He is jaunty, loves the beautiful things in life, and decides to spend his won money to sail a yacht on a long-dreamed journey.  While at sea he has his first blackout which we later learn is due to a brain tumor.  He is taken ashore in Morocco where he encounters a lounge singer (Patricia Kaas) who likewise is subject to blackouts and has strayed to Morocco after the end of an affair with a trumpet player.  Together they plan a pilgrimage to a site of healing, but Irons' character is followed by the police for his jewel heists and is captured, is unable to remember his thefts, and finally is diagnosed as having a brain tumor.  Postop he reconciles with his singer and makes amends for his life of crime.As with all of Lelouche's films there are episodes that blur dreamlife with reality and in this film he uses this technique to perfection.  Much of what really happens is left to the individual's perception.  The settings for this escapade are truly splendid - Morocco has never looked so dreamy, so dramatic, so sun-drenched and inviting.  The real joy of this film are the performances of Irons and Kaas and the added pleasure of seeing old (!) faces from the past such as Claudia Cardinale - no longer the beauty she once was!  Patricia Kaas is a very fine singer and her renditions of old standards take on new substance in her sensitive interpretations.  The only flaw in this film is that it is filmed in both English and French and the dubbing barely matches the subtitles.  That is very distracting.  But forgive that and you have a film that will let you take flight - lightly as with an elegant French aperitif!",5,A Lovely Escapist Venture,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,1997,"['Claude', 'Lelouche', 'once', 'again', 'teamed', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'continue', 'examination', 'vagaries', 'love', 'NOW', 'LADIES', 'amp', 'GENTLEMEN', 'Gallic', 'magic', 'Lelouche', 'view', 'love', 'irresistible', 'rather', 'long', 'film', 'journey', 'exception', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'thief', 'who', 'sophisticated', 'heists', 'jewels', 'adopting', 'disguises', 'jaunty', 'beautiful', 'things', 'life', 'spend', 'won', 'money', 'sail', 'yacht', 'long-dreamed', 'journey', 'sea', 'first', 'blackout', 'later', 'learn', 'due', 'brain', 'tumor', 'taken', 'ashore', 'Morocco', 'where', 'lounge', 'singer', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'who', 'likewise', 'subject', 'blackouts', 'strayed', 'Morocco', 'end', 'affair', 'trumpet', 'player', 'Together', 'plan', 'pilgrimage', 'site', 'healing', 'Irons', 'character', 'followed', 'police', 'jewel', 'heists', 'captured', 'unable', 'remember', 'thefts', 'finally', 'diagnosed', 'having', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Postop', 'singer', 'amends', 'life', 'crime.As', 'Lelouche', 'films', 'are', 'episodes', 'blur', 'dreamlife', 'reality', 'film', 'technique', 'perfection', 'Much', 'what', 'really', 'left', 'individual', 'perception', 'settings', 'escapade', 'are', 'truly', 'splendid', 'Morocco', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'dreamy', 'so', 'dramatic', 'so', 'sun-drenched', 'inviting', 'real', 'joy', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'Irons', 'Kaas', 'added', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'old', 'past', 'such', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'no', 'longer', 'beauty', 'once', 'was', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'very', 'fine', 'singer', 'renditions', 'old', 'standards', 'take', 'new', 'substance', 'sensitive', 'interpretations', 'only', 'flaw', 'film', 'filmed', 'English', 'French', 'dubbing', 'barely', 'subtitles', 'very', 'distracting', 'forgive', 'have', 'film', 'will', 'let', 'take', 'flight', 'lightly', 'elegant', 'French', 'aperitif']",N/A

So without regard for the film's title we are introduced to Valentin Valentin (Irons), a jewel thief who comes up with creative but simple ways of robbing jewelry stores. But then Valentin's life starts to come apart. His relationship with his lover, Franoise (Alessandra Martines), has gone sour, he is suddenly feeling guilty about every crime he has ever committed, and to top things off he is suddenly experiencing blackouts. Meanwhile, in another part of Europe a French chanteuse, Jane Lester (Patricia Kaas, a real-life French chanteuse whose songs provide a counterpoint to the story so pay attention to the lyrics each and every time she sings), also has just ended her romantic relationship and is also suffering from unexplained blackouts, usually while singing.Jane travels to Morocco because assuming the worse from the blackouts she decides to seek healing instead of going to a brain surgeon. Valentin also ends up in Morocco, literally by accident, but their common ailment has cause to bring them together under the misery loves company rubric. He is staying at the same hotel where she is singing, and when Madame Falconetti (Claudia Cardiale) reports the theft of her jewelry, Valentin becomes the obvious suspect. To make things interesting, when he says he had a blackout and does not know if he did the robbery or not, he could be telling the truth. Then again...This is a story for grown ups, mainly because Irons bring a certain gravity to the proceedings because of his age. The fact that his criminal career rests on his brain and that is what is betraying him lends a irony to the tale as well. Then there is a question of whether or not anything we are seeing represents the blackout themselves. The two best parts of this 2002 film are the bank robberies and the songs, even if the former involve people not recognizing Irons in disguise and the later are sung in French (with substitles), and they tend to make the rest of this slowly developing film seem even slower in comparison.Be forewarned that ""And Now...Ladies & Gentlemen"" is one of those films that you are probably going to need to watch twice to make sense of it all. That is not because it is confusing per se, but rather that the ending is open to interpretation depending on how you read the various layers that Lelouch reveals during the final real. For me the journey was more interesting than the destination since I am not sure how much projecting I was doing on what was happening at the end. Still, this is a change of pace film and if you are looking for something different you could do a lot worse. Also, there is ample evidence that this film really resonates with some viewers, which would be great if you are one of those people.",4,An international jewel thief and a chanteuse have blackouts in common,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2986,"['Pay', 'attention', 'title', 'film', 'more', 'think', 'only', 'purpose', 'put', 'towards', 'top', 'alphabetical', 'listing', 'films', 'director', 'Claude', 'Lelouch', 'Man', 'Woman', 'star', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'So', 'regard', 'film', 'title', 'are', 'introduced', 'Valentin', 'Valentin', 'Irons', 'jewel', 'thief', 'who', 'up', 'creative', 'simple', 'ways', 'robbing', 'jewelry', 'stores', 'then', 'Valentin', 'life', 'come', 'apart', 'relationship', 'lover', 'Franoise', 'Alessandra', 'Martines', 'gone', 'sour', 'suddenly', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'crime', 'ever', 'committed', 'top', 'things', 'suddenly', 'experiencing', 'blackouts', 'Meanwhile', 'part', 'Europe', 'French', 'chanteuse', 'Jane', 'Lester', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'real-life', 'French', 'chanteuse', 'songs', 'provide', 'counterpoint', 'story', 'so', 'pay', 'attention', 'lyrics', 'time', 'sings', 'also', 'just', 'ended', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'also', 'suffering', 'unexplained', 'blackouts', 'usually', 'singing.Jane', 'travels', 'Morocco', 'assuming', 'worse', 'blackouts', 'seek', 'healing', 'instead', 'going', 'brain', 'surgeon', 'Valentin', 'also', 'up', 'Morocco', 'literally', 'accident', 'common', 'ailment', 'cause', 'bring', 'together', 'misery', 'company', 'rubric', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'where', 'singing', 'when', 'Madame', 'Falconetti', 'Claudia', 'Cardiale', 'theft', 'jewelry', 'Valentin', 'obvious', 'suspect', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'when', 'had', 'blackout', 'not', 'know', 'did', 'robbery', 'not', 'could', 'be', 'telling', 'truth', 'Then', 'again', 'story', 'grown', 'ups', 'mainly', 'Irons', 'bring', 'certain', 'gravity', 'proceedings', 'age', 'fact', 'criminal', 'career', 'rests', 'brain', 'what', 'betraying', 'irony', 'tale', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'question', 'not', 'anything', 'are', 'seeing', 'blackout', 'two', 'best', 'parts', '2002', 'film', 'are', 'bank', 'robberies', 'songs', 'even', 'former', 'involve', 'people', 'not', 'recognizing', 'Irons', 'disguise', 'later', 'are', 'sung', 'French', 'substitles', 'tend', 'make', 'rest', 'slowly', 'developing', 'film', 'seem', 'even', 'slower', 'comparison.Be', 'forewarned', 'Now', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'one', 'films', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'need', 'watch', 'twice', 'make', 'sense', 'not', 'confusing', 'se', 'rather', 'ending', 'open', 'interpretation', 'depending', 'how', 'read', 'various', 'layers', 'Lelouch', 'reveals', 'final', 'real', 'journey', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'destination', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'projecting', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'happening', 'end', 'Still', 'change', 'pace', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'Also', 'ample', 'evidence', 'film', 'really', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'are', 'one', 'people']",N/A

784153,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0000UJLF0,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Sometimes it's a director's least ambitious films that are their most satisfying. And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen... may just be a piece of romantic fluff from Claude Lelouch, but it's entertaining romantic fluff that doesn't outstay its welcome even at the 128-minute mark. Lelouch is a talented director whose ambition is only rarely matched by his material, usually overcompensating with impressive technique that fails to hide the thinness of the story and characters. While no-one could ever mistake And Now... for having any depth, it's a pure audience pleaser (albeit possibly for a middle-aged cinema audience that no longer exists) that genuinely pleases. It's rarely laugh out loud funny and it's not one of the great screen romances, but it is a charming and engaging number skilfully crafted.It's styled after those glossy widescreen 60s romantic comedies about glamorous people in faraway places, usually involving light comic banter and (possibly) wrongly accused gentlemen jewel thieves. Jeremy Irons, so often a hard actor to warm to, is surprisingly likeable here and shows a real gift for comedy in the jewel robbery scenes (the first of which nods amiably to Lelouch's earlier La Bonne Annee). As is his wont, Lelouch casts yet another popular French singer in the other lead, this time Patricia Kass, who turns out better than initially expected. The two are eventually drawn together by the same neurological symptoms, which cause him to dream of returning his ill-gotten gains and her to forget her lyrics while coming over all monochrome, finding themselves in Morocco and en route to a healing shrine and possible romance. With the exception of Thierry L'Hermitte, Amidou and Claudia Cardinale, most of the cast of familiar faces from French cinema have little to do but make an appearance, but they never overbalance the film in the way that the top-heavy casting so often does in the director's other films.

784154,A16YSAU2757QF3,B0000UJLF0,"X. Wang ""average DVD junkie""","[0, 0]","This movie, directed by Claude Lelouch, is a nice romantic movie. Jeremy Irons is very convincing as the hero, a jewelry thief and a yachtsman with a brain tumor. Patricia Kaas plays the lounge singer who sometimes forgets that she has not finished a song, she has brain tumor also. They meet in Fez, she is seeking the healing and he hits a fishing boat and was saved and a doctor introduces them. Valentine was wrongly accused of a jewelry theft of a rich Italian couple, it turns out that the lover of the Italian lady took the jewelry. Valentine had the operation and was seemingly cured of his tumor. He also amended his ways and paid back the jewelry he took from others. In the end Valentine was sailing into the sunset with Jane(Patricia Kaas). I personally like a sad ending, so I feel the ending is too much of a wish fulfillment. The story is very interesting, the acting is superb, there are nice songs by Patricia Kaas just in case you are getting bored, so the movie is very romantic and sweet. There are minor characters that add to the drama, the Italian lady that got robbed was played by Claudia Cardinale, who was a sex symbol in her glory days, in this movie she is a good backup. Jeremy Irons seems tobe good at playing a doomed lover, or somebody with terminal disease, so this movie suits him well. The movie also likes to repeat the idea that ""life is a deep sleep, and love is a dream"", so in that sense, all the plots and characters are not that important at all, we don't need to take the story that seriously. This movie is entertaining, it has the thrills of jewelry theft, a bit of mystery jewelry theft case, nice singing from Patricia Kaas, do we dare ask for more? Not much sex in this movie, it has plenty of romance. Life is but a dream, why wake up and smell the coffee?",4,romantic French movie with some twists,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,1806,"['movie', 'directed', 'Claude', 'Lelouch', 'nice', 'romantic', 'movie', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'very', 'convincing', 'hero', 'jewelry', 'thief', 'yachtsman', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'lounge', 'singer', 'who', 'forgets', 'not', 'finished', 'song', 'brain', 'tumor', 'also', 'meet', 'Fez', 'seeking', 'healing', 'fishing', 'boat', 'was', 'saved', 'doctor', 'Valentine', 'was', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'jewelry', 'theft', 'rich', 'Italian', 'couple', 'out', 'lover', 'Italian', 'lady', 'took', 'jewelry', 'Valentine', 'had', 'operation', 'was', 'seemingly', 'cured', 'tumor', 'also', 'amended', 'ways', 'paid', 'back', 'jewelry', 'took', 'others', 'end', 'Valentine', 'was', 'sailing', 'sunset', 'Jane', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'personally', 'sad', 'ending', 'feel', 'ending', 'too', 'much', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'acting', 'superb', 'are', 'nice', 'songs', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'just', 'case', 'are', 'getting', 'bored', 'movie', 'very', 'romantic', 'sweet', 'are', 'minor', 'characters', 'add', 'drama', 'Italian', 'lady', 'got', 'robbed', 'was', 'played', 'Claudia', 'Cardinale', 'who', 'was', 'sex', 'symbol', 'glory', 'days', 'movie', 'good', 'backup', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'tobe', 'good', 'playing', 'doomed', 'lover', 'somebody', 'terminal', 'disease', 'movie', 'suits', 'well', 'movie', 'also', 'repeat', 'idea', 'life', 'deep', 'sleep', 'love', 'dream', 'so', 'sense', 'plots', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'take', 'story', 'seriously', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'thrills', 'jewelry', 'theft', 'bit', 'mystery', 'jewelry', 'theft', 'case', 'nice', 'singing', 'Patricia', 'Kaas', 'do', 'dare', 'ask', 'more', 'Not', 'much', 'sex', 'movie', 'plenty', 'romance', 'Life', 'dream', 'why', 'wake', 'up', 'smell', 'coffee']",N/A
