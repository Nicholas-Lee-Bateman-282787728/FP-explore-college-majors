In a sense, it's like Lawrence of Arabia'sSeven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph;it's the book that everybody buys, but nobody reads. It also makes a great paperweight and/or doorstop. While Leo Tolstoy'sAnna Karenina (Oprah's Book Club)has had many adaptations (including one with Vivien Leigh), ""War and Peace"" has been the intimidating one. To quote another epic of the recent century, ""All shall love me and despair.""""War and Peace"" follows the trials, tribulations and triumphs of the Rostovs and Bolkonskys. Like any good soap opera, there are intrigues, love affairs, etc. The BBC took Tolstoy's epic at face value. Instead of using Tolstoy's ruminations on world history, married life, the chapter on the metrosexual Napoleon's toilette (this was beforeSex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset), the directors wisely treat it like ""As the World Turns"" or ""The Young and the Restless."" It's got everything except switched babies and amnesia.""War and Peace"" has Anthony Hopkins as the lovingly bumbling Prince Pierre, Alan Dobie as the cerebrally narcissistic Prince Andrei, and Morag Hood as Natasha. Anthony Hopkins is sterling--the best-known actor in the cast. He's superior to the source material. The ensemble cast and the production are fast-moving, brilliant... it's one of those ""it's better than the book"" or ""I'd rather not read the book."" It's superior, movie-wise, toThe Brothers Karamazov (1958) [VHS] starring Yul Brynner and William Shatner... though the latter is based on a better book (but it does have Captain Kirk!)""War and Peace"", while an emotionally shallow book, managed to inspire a convincing and fun miniseries. It's all about young Russian people looking for love, the tribulations of the super-rich--not unlikeSex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset). All it needs are Manolo Blahniks and designer cupcakes.

409826,AB4F6UHL20U95,6304246579,Anne Rice,"[12, 13]","In 1972, when this series first showed on American television, I watched it with great pleasure. And just this last week, I watched it again.  Never have I seen any adaptation of a novel as faithful as this adaptation.  Pullman did a masterly job.------  The casting is for the most part perfect, but Anthony Hopkins towers head and shoulders over the others as the vibrant star who guides us through the entire saga.  ---- I do think perhaps another Natasha might have been a little more effective, but the actress certainly gives it her all, and is faced, of course with the difficulty of playing a thirteen year old girl and a grown woman later on.  I think she does quite a respectable job.  --- What so moved me however is that so many of the scenes, and so much of the dialogue is taken directly from Tolstoy's masterpiece.  ---- And for this reason, among others, Tolstoy's great love of his created characters, his great courage in probing the depths of their hearts and souls, shines through.  ----- I know of no writer except Tolstoy who writes so beautifully of both men and women, who will devote so much time to exploring the deep feelings of women, as well as men, who will treat a woman figure with the same respect that he shows for a male figure, even Napoleon.  Tolstoy's bravery in examining the ""romantic"" feelings of Pierre for Natasha, or Andrey and Nastasha for each other, or the love of Princess Marya for her husband,  all this is almost incredible.  ----- In America today, critics tend to be cynical and snide about domestic situations described in fiction, or the romantic love a man feels for a woman and vice versa.  Not so Tolstoy.  Such thoughts never entered his mind apparently.  He takes his time describing the feelings of a mother for a baby, the feelings of a young child dreaming of greatness, the feelings of a woman in love, just as he describes in detail Andrey's search for meaning, and Pierre's search for happiness and the good.  ----  And all this is radiant in this series, right along with great battle scenes that seek to capture the true chaos and horror of war.  -----The interiors are gorgeous, the ball room scenes enchanting, the whole a great and impressive work. --------  If you have never read War and Peace, if you are intimidated by the size of the book and by the long passages on war and the philosophy of history, etc. let me suggest this:  watch this series, and then go to the book, and using the series as a road map of sorts look for the various scenes that most impressed you or struck you.  Search out the characters in the series who most engaged you.  And then take what Tolstoy has to give.  ----- You will not find any jarring disconnect between the series and the novel.  The characters you love on the screen, you will find in Tolstoy's words.  And you will find in Tolstoy a profundity perhaps never rivaled by another writer; you will find a profound exploration of love that perhaps has never been equalled in a novel anywhere else. -----  I am grateful for this series, grateful to the patience and faith that went into the making of it, and grateful that we have such a marvelous set of dvds of it today.  Highly recommended.",5,Best adaptation of any novel that I've ever seen.

There are flaws but little point in fault finding.  Tolstoy didn't write a simple story.By todays standards it is stuffy here and there, slow and simplistic.  The Russian production of the late 1960s is intense by comparison in my opinion.Yet there are scenes in the earlier British production that can startle the viewer.  Battle scenes lack the Russian intensity and realism.This long movie was a great effort in its time.  It feels so very British especially due to the acting style of the time.  But not all British productions for tv or the movie theater used this style.  Still, this pretentious acting doesn't dominate every scene.  Some acting is good while some isn't convincing.

409830,ASOT5NHUUHBBM,6304246579,Boston Romance Reader,"[1, 7]","There were glimmers of greatness in this movie but ultimately the entire series fell flat. The best feature of the production are the acting performances specificly of Hopkins, who was wonderful to watch especially as the early Peire. The actors playing Natasha, Countess and Count Rostove, and Princess Maria and her father were also very good. There were some performances I didn't care for, namely Andri, who I suspect is supposed to be some brave heroic character, but whom I found to be a whinney jerk.I had two overriding problems with this production. The editing for the war scense was aimed at creating a specific tone, the problem is that it was obvious that they were trying to coax an emotional reaction, and fell flat. What I mean is before and after every war scene we'd get shot after shot after shot of soldiers sitting around looking sad, soldiers laying around, soldiers hurt, fire, horses, marching, blah blah blah, the first two shots evoked the thought I was supposed to have the next five made me roll my eyes. The extras first of all were not convincing in their suffering so showing it over and over again just made it obvious of what they were trying to do. So much time was devoted to these types of scenes and the war scense themselves were so poorly shot that all the scenes that dealt with the war and battle were just boring. If they'd condenced the war scenes and just shown the battle and the principal cast's reaction to it we could have cut about two hours out of the movie.The second issue was Nepolean. I get that this is a British production, I get that the Russian's didn't speak like British people, but for the sake of enjoying hte film I accepted the fact that these people had British accents and used British phrases. What I can't accept is that the French also had British accents, specificly Neapolean. There needs to be a way to differentite between Russian and French, and with few exceptions there really wasn't.

It is only after reading these other reviews that I learned that this new set is more ""complete"" than what I'd watched on American TV 30 years earlier. It has a new first episode, ""Name Day"". As I watched the DVDs, I was only mildly puzzled that I didn't remember seeing that episode originally. After all, after 30 years, how could one be sure of remembering everything?But now that I know about this addition, several other things I didn't remember from my original viewings can be explained. For example, several times as I was watching these DVD's there were stretches of a few minutes or so where I thought, ""Hmmm, this is boring; this section could easily have been edited out and no one would have missed it."" I don't remember a single moment of feeling this way when I watched the American version several times. Apparently those sections WERE edited out in the original American showing, to ""tighten up"" the narrative. So there were flaws in the original British showing that apparently were NOT there in the original American showing, which makes the original American version more memorable in my opinion.Aside from that reservation, this new set is most welcome. As mentioned above, I've been waiting a long time for this release and I have thought for some time that perhaps it would never be released, for some inexplicable reason. Before I had gotten through the first viewing of this production 30 years ago, it had already prompted me to start my first reading of the novel itself, the first of five that I would make. I'd already seen the American version of the movie and it had not come close to prompting me to pick up the actual novel and read it. I can tell you that you get a very accurate feel for the novel in viewing this production, and you can just see these BBC characters alive in the novel itself, which speaks to the faithfulness of the BBC production.As another reviewer has pointed out, Tolstoy's philosophy of war does accurately come out in this BBC production, through the thoughts and words of three of the characters, Pierre, Andre, and Kutuzov. In the novel, however, Tolstoy's philosophy is not conveyed nearly so explicitly in the actually words of the characters. Perhaps it's rather presumptuous for me to criticize the master that Tolstoy was, but it has always seemed to me a redundancy in the novel that Tolstoy included long, discursive chapters that were external to the narrative of the novel itself to explain his philosophy explicitly, as if he needed to bang us on the head with a hammer to get his ""points"" across. Thankfully, the BBC production could not do this and has the characters themselves speak his philosophy, as mentioned above. I've always thought that a pure novel should never do what Tolstoy did, that any ""philosophy"" should be implicit in the flow of the novel itself. That's a greater artistic challenge, to be sure, but it would almost by definition be more of a work of art if Tolstoy actually does this. After reading the novel three times, I decided to omit those discursive chapters and did so on my next two readings of the novel. I didn't seem to miss anything, although it's hard to judge, since I already had an understanding of his philosophy from having gone through these chapters in my previous three readings. In any case, I was left with the impression that nothing would be missed if Tolstoy had simply omitted those discursive chapters, and if I remember correctly he didn't have to put his philosophy into the mouths of his characters as much as the BBC production necessarily does. The narrative of the novel spoke for itself, as (in my opinion) an artistically successful, proper novel should. The BBC production manages very neatly to solve in a very believable manner the problem of conveying Tolstoy's philosophy of war in the thoughts and words of the three characters mentioned above, even though this is not done in the novel to nearly the extent it is done in the BBC production. It is just seemlessly incorporated into the style of the production, as we are made privy to the thoughts of the various characters (not just these three) throughout the presentation.There are many deeply poignant moments throughout this BBC production, intensely felt moments that carry the viewer to the heights of emotion. One really gets carried along into the drama, very much like what happens in the novel itself. I can't remember ever seeing another video production of a novel that so successfully achieves this. For that reason alone, this is one of the greatest video productions of all time, not to be missed.",5,"Finally, it's available!",1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,5238,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking',

409844,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,6304246579,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[6, 9]","The Story: In 1805 and during the celebrated reign of Russia's ""Alexander the Blessed"", Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Austria to further expand his European empire. The Russians, stalwart allies of the Austrians at that time, stood firmly with their brethren against the infamous Emperor. However, Napoleon swiftly prevailed and, after a time, a treaty was ultimately signed at Tilsit. In 1812, the power-crazed Napoleon rose again to cross the Neiman River into the Russian homeland, again in an effort to expand his dominion. The end result of this tragic conflagration was that Napoleon's army of about 600,000 soldiers was reduced to roughly 60,000 men as the defamed Emperor raced from a charred and mostly deserted Moscow, (which he had taken), back across the frozen Russian landscape in his comfortable carriage (leaving his troops behind to fend for themselves under grueling conditions) for Paris. That encapsulates the military aspect of this tale.But the more intricate story involves both the activities and the peccadilloes of primarily three Russian families of nobility: The Rostovs, the Bolkonskys, and the Bezukovs. The continual thorn of ""The Antichrist,"" Napoleon, really just provides the wallpaper for this larger story of romance, riches, desolation, love, devastation, jealousy, hatred, retribution, nostalgia, joy, grief, naivety, stupidity, and so much more. Tolstoy has woven an incredibly intricate web that interconnects these noble families, the wars, and the common Russian people to a degree that would seem to most incomprehensible to achieve -- but Tolstoy perseveres with superb clarity and enormous insight into the human psyche. His characters are timeless and the reader of the book version of this magnificent story who has any social experience whatever will immediately connect with them all.War and Peaceis a fictional, lengthy novel, based upon historical fact.The Mini-series: This is a 1972 BBC production starring Anthony Hopkins (early on in his notable acting career), consisting of five DVDs and lasting for almost 15 hours! The aspect ratio is 4 x 3 (not letterbox) which is consistent with the dimensions of the traditional television screen. It looks just fine on a widescreen TV as well. The package includes an informative 44-page booklet with behind-the-scenes information about the production along with biographies of the key actors.The first thought that came to my mind about this mini-series is that it is so very complex that most folks will have difficulty in grappling with the entirety of the story unless they have previously read Tolstoy's book:War and Peace (Vintage Classics). It really doesn't matter much which translation that one reads (there are currently 12 English translations and the only divergent edition, in terms of what happens in the book, is this one:War and Peace: Original Version. I usually recommend the Briggs translation for first-timers to the work, although the mini-series is based upon the very similar Rosemary Edmonds translation:War and Peace Volume I. Translated by Rosemary Edmonds. Penguin Classics No L63.This mini-series is a great introduction to War and Peace in the video format because it includes most of the nuts and bolts of Tolstoy's original story; however, in terms of artistic achievement this version cannot hold up to Bondarchuk's 1968 masterpiece film (dubbed in English, in letterbox, with available English and other subtitles):War and Peace (Special Edition). Director Bondarchuk's focus was more on Tolstoy's ""magic"" and less so on including each and every incident, albeit he corralled the most essential ones. I should also mention that the prospective buyer should not even consider acquiring the pathetic Hollywood film version starring Henry Fonda. It's one of the most lamentable book-to-film attempts I've ever seen:War and Peace.Getting back to the BBC-Hopkins mini-series, the directors (Alan Dobie/John Davies) and other production folks unfortunately relented somewhat to their own egos and to that noxious little book-desecrator: ""poetic license."" In doing so, they told this magnificent tale much as a war historian might relate it, rather than seizing upon Tolstoy's meticulous, colorful, and powerful literary painting of the events. Make no mistake about it, this is an incredibly intricate and problematic story to render through the media of film. Allow me to now touch upon the mini-series' very few shortcomings and then I can subsequently summarize my considerable praise for this lengthy production in which the pros far outweigh the cons.The casting was perhaps the most egregious aspect of this production. Ironically, Hopkins himself was a poor choice for the key character of Pierre Bezukhov. We detect, simply by looking at and listening to Hopkins in any environment, that he is incredibly intelligent, gifted, and articulate which is always going to leak through in any role that he plays - unfortunately, the character of Pierre is that of a portly, nave, and bumbling fool. Hopkins simply makes him come off as way too articulate and worldly, despite numerous vain attempts to make him appear less so.A second casting calamity was that of actress Morag Hood who plays the equally important role of Natasha Rostov. To be blunt, Tolstoy created Natasha (in her youth of 13 years old and even later) to manifest every pedophile's fantasy. She is an incongruent blend of vivaciousness, stunning in appearance, uncontained in demeanor, puerile, and a bulwark of beaming sunshine, additionally exuding an untamed spirit unmatchable by any of her female peers.Unfortunately, Hood's virtues are in contrast with this role and she could only be considered beautiful (I hate to toss this bomb but I will anyway) by English standards of the term... Hood's beauty is clearly internal, yet another feature which the egocentric Natasha does not at all share with her. Specifically, Hood's face is too emaciated in its structure and, while she's not actually buck-toothed, she demonstrates an overbite so prominent as to rival that of Hilary Clinton's chompers. This singular and regrettable actuality detracts from the centrality of the story to the degree that we as viewers cannot understand why all the young men plummet at her mere appearance (and in fact, Natasha's prospective lovers do not seem to wish to do so as their roles require!) Particularly in Natasha's teen appearances, the image of Hood's bounding and skipping around the various venues, sporting a young girl's pigtails, simply appears absurd.Boris Drubetskoy (played by Neil Stacy) and Nicolai Rostov (played by Sylvester Morand) were each also far too mature in age to play their teen roles early in the tale, although they were faultless in adulthood in the latter episodes of the story.The tendency of film-makers to gloss over the more magical parts of Tolstoy's Magnum opus illustrates their lack of comprehensive understanding of the story and perhaps their additional inability to convey it with a high level of competence. Two of the moments I'm thinking of in particular include ""the mummers' sleigh ride"" and ""Petya's dream,"" (just prior to the attack on the retreating French convoy.) Both of these important scenes were sadly excluded from the mini-series.My final criticism is one regarding an historical ignominy: the scene at old Count Rostov's renowned banquet where Pierre challenges Dolokhov to a duel. I found it quite distracting from an historical perspective that the banquet was, in this instance, conducted in honor of old General Kutuzov instead of his much-revered assistant, General Bagration, as it should have been. No competent technical advisor in his right mind would have permitted this faux pas of a change from the book to transpire as, at that particular time, Kutuzov was pretty universally scorned by all within his social realm, owing to his disastrous defeat by Napoleon in Austria and elsewhere, (even though he had probably saved the Russian Army through his personally courageous strategies.)And that last comment provides me with the perfect entry to remark upon what fine acting Frank Middlemass conveyed through his role as General Kutuzov, (even though he was misused in that single instance.) Middlemass performed equally memorably in his role as the scandalous and drunken Marmelodov in the terrific mini-series of Dostoyevsky'sCrime & Punishment - The Complete Miniseries.Other key actors deserve a slate of Kudos for their respective appearances in the War and Peace mini-series: David Swift as Napoleon; Anthony Jacobs as old Prince Bolkonsky; Donald Douglas as Tsar Alexander I; Colin Baker as Anatole Kuragin; Rupert Davies as old Count Rostov; Faith Brook as Countess Rostova; Angela Down as Maria Bolkonskya, and; Candita Fawsitt as Julia Karagina, (a comparatively brief but very important role.) The terrific work of all these talented folks added so very much to the overall ambiance and palatability of the film.In total, 20 episodes make up this sprawling color epic and, while it drags just a little here and there, I think that overall it represents a remarkable achievement in film. There was a lot of location shooting of the film in Yugoslavia which yielded spectacular scenery. The outdoor scenes were shot on actual film while the indoor shots were rendered to videotape. Noting those minor flaws which I mentioned previously, I can say without reservation that they are completely overcome by the inclusive comprehensive excellence of this superb mini-series.Highly

These older BBC dramas have a certain timeless quality to them that seem lacking in the more polished versions today. I first saw this production when I was about 10 years old, and it made a lifelong impression on me.  Too bad kids today can't get hooked on something like this.Looking at this series is almost like reading whole chapters from the novel.  Seldem does one find such a complete attempt to translate a book to television.  Many scenes are done in their entirety from the novel.  The acting is superb.  A young Anthony Hopkins converys all the confusion and complexity of Pierre in the book.  Morag Hood is an emotional and vulnerable Natasha. I certainly had a crush on her character when I was younger as did many others it seems! Prince Bolkonsky is dark and forebodding. Even minor characters get development in this production which is quite unique.My version was taped directly off TV when it was shown for one of the last times in the 1980s.  In addition to the fine scenes showing the characters in Russia, the additional scenes showing Napolean and the Austerlitz and 1812 Campaigns are also wonderful.  Several noteworthy Napoleanic military historians were consulted for this production, and their fine imput is evident throughout.  The battle scenes, while perhaps small scale compared to today, are finely crafted and reflect the tactics and formations of the time. I wonder where these scenes were shot, as the extras don't look English for the most part.  The uniforms were researched by John Mollo, a noted historian for military costume.The actor who plays Napolean is perhaps a bit tall, but his mannerisms seem quite accurate.  He makes an impressive L'Empereur! All the actors were part of BBC stock at the time, and they appeared in many other productions.  All of them were good.  The wonderful Russian Imperial Anthem is played by the Band of the Welsh Guards under Major Desmond Walker.  This band was quite popular with the BBC at the time and produced several LPs under their label.  They also toured the USA with the Argylls around this time, and shall be returning to the USA in early 2006 with the Black Watch.  This is perhaps one of the finest adaptations you will ever find for any classic novel.  This is an example how fine Cinema can be in transcribing a novel to the screen.  Too bad it is seldom done so well these days.This series deserves to be brought back out on DVD where improved picture and sound qaulity can only enhance the brilliance of its production.",5,The Finest War & Peace,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2588,"['best', 'most', 'complete', 'version', 'novel', 'made', 'date', 'older', 'BBC', 'dramas', 'have', 'certain', 'timeless', 'quality', 'seem', 'lacking', 'more', 'polished', 'versions', 'today', 'first', 'saw', 'production', 'when', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'made', 'lifelong', 'impression', 'Too', 'bad', 'kids', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hooked', 'something', 'this.Looking', 'series', 'almost', 'reading', 'whole', 'chapters', 'novel', 'Seldem', 'one', 'find', 'such', 'complete', 'attempt', 'translate', 'book', 'television', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'entirety', 'novel', 'acting', 'superb', 'young', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'converys', 'confusion', 'complexity', 'Pierre', 'book', 'Morag', 'Hood', 'emotional', 'vulnerable', 'Natasha', 'certainly', 'had', 'crush', 'character', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'did', 'many', 'others', 'Prince', 'Bolkonsky', 'dark', 'forebodding', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'get', 'development', 'production', 'quite', 'unique.My', 'version', 'was', 'taped', 'directly', 'off', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'one', 'last', 'times', '1980s', 'addition', 'fine', 'scenes', 'showing', 'characters', 'Russia', 'additional', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Napolean', 'Austerlitz', '1812', 'Campaigns', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Several', 'noteworthy', 'Napoleanic', 'military', 'historians', 'were', 'consulted', 'production', 'fine', 'imput', 'evident', 'battle', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'small', 'scale', 'compared', 'today', 'are', 'finely', 'crafted', 'reflect', 'tactics', 'formations', 'time', 'wonder', 'where', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'English', 'most', 'part', 'uniforms', 'were', 'researched', 'John', 'Mollo', 'noted', 'historian', 'military', 'costume.The', 'actor', 'who', 'Napolean', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'tall', 'mannerisms', 'seem', 'quite', 'accurate', 'impressive', ""L'Empereur"", 'actors', 'were', 'part', 'BBC', 'stock', 'time', 'appeared', 'many', 'other', 'productions', 'were', 'good', 'wonderful', 'Russian', 'Imperial', 'Anthem', 'played', 'Band', 'Welsh', 'Guards', 'Major', 'Desmond', 'Walker', 'band', 'was', 'quite', 'popular', 'BBC', 'time', 'produced', 'several', 'LPs', 'label', 'also', 'toured', 'USA', 'Argylls', 'time', 'shall', 'be', 'returning', 'USA', 'early', '2006', 'Black', 'Watch', 'perhaps', 'one', 'finest', 'adaptations', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'classic', 'novel', 'example', 'how', 'fine', 'Cinema', 'can', 'be', 'transcribing', 'novel', 'screen', 'Too', 'bad', 'seldom', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'days.This', 'series', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'out', 'DVD', 'where', 'improved', 'picture', 'sound', 'qaulity', 'can', 'only', 'enhance', 'brilliance', 'production']",War & Peace BBC Production  VHS

This DVD set comes with 5 DVDs (with 4 episodes per DVD) and a 44-page booklet featuring production notes, episode summaries, character profiles, and behind the scenes photographs. Each DVD has a running time of 177 minutes for total running time of nearly 15 hours for the entire series.In short, this is a movie about Russian aristocrats during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the early 1800s. The story follows the main characters as they change (and sometimes die) over the course of the war. The adaptation is much, much better than the King Vidor film from 1956; however, it does not live up to the high quality of the four-part Russian movie from the late sixties.Thanks to my e-book reader, I read War and Peace immediately prior to watching this miniseries. With so much time (15 hours), this miniseries quite admirably manages to include nearly every significant scene from Tolstoy's novel. The miniseries is mostly faithful to the novel; however, I was very much annoyed on a few occasions by unjustifiable deviations from the novel. I understand that television writers, directors, and producers must cater to a television audience's predilections; but this does not excuse vitiating a masterpiece. In any case, if you watch this miniseries, then you will have experienced the scenes and characters from the novel almost completely (without Tolstoy's essays on fate and war).Anthony Hopkins is the star of this miniseries, playing the role of Pierre Bezukhov. As one would expect, Mr. Hopkins does an outstanding job. Considering the huge amount of time Mr. Hopkins was on screen, he must have been exhausted by the end of this shoot. However, I was very disappointed with many of the casting choices. The actors in the Russian version of War and Peace are much better aligned to the characters they play. I was a little disappointed with the BBC's choice for the part of Natasha. The actress is very good; her performance was fine. However, being a 29-year-old woman, she was too old to play the character (who is supposed to be 12 or 13 years old in her first scene). Of course, Natasha ages into her twenties over the course of the novel (miniseries); but, still, the actress, although good, was too old for the part. Also, casting Doctor Who (I mean, Colin Baker) as Kuragin did not work out well.All in all, this is a very good production. It is flawed; but considering the budget, I think the production team did a miraculous job. I appreciate the lengths they went to in order to bring the entire novel to the screen. The King Vidor version from 1956, at 3.5 hours, pales in comparison (even though I, like everyone, love Audrey Hepburn). If you do not mind subtitles, do yourself a favor and watch the (better) Russian version of War and Peace:War and Peace.",5,Excellent adaptation of War and Peace - 15 hours long,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,2895,"['20-episode', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'War', 'Peace', '1972', 'based', 'Leo', 'Nikoleyevich', 'Tolstoy', 'classic', 'novel', 'DVD', 'set', '5', 'DVDs', '4', 'episodes', 'DVD', '44-page', 'booklet', 'featuring', 'production', 'notes', 'episode', 'summaries', 'character', 'profiles', 'scenes', 'photographs', 'DVD', 'running', 'time', '177', 'minutes', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'nearly', '15', 'hours', 'entire', 'series.In', 'short', 'movie', 'Russian', 'aristocrats', 'Napoleon', 'invasion', 'Russia', 'early', '1800s', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'change', 'sometimes', 'die', 'course', 'war', 'adaptation', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'King', 'Vidor', 'film', '1956', 'however', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'quality', 'four-part', 'Russian', 'movie', 'late', 'sixties.Thanks', 'e-book', 'reader', 'read', 'War', 'Peace', 'immediately', 'prior', 'watching', 'miniseries', 'so', 'much', 'time', '15', 'hours', 'quite', 'admirably', 'include', 'nearly', 'significant', 'scene', 'Tolstoy', 'novel', 'miniseries', 'mostly', 'faithful', 'novel', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'annoyed', 'few', 'occasions', 'unjustifiable', 'deviations', 'novel', 'understand', 'television', 'writers', 'directors', 'producers', 'must', 'cater', 'television', 'audience', 'predilections', 'not', 'excuse', 'vitiating', 'masterpiece', 'case', 'watch', 'miniseries', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'experienced', 'scenes', 'characters', 'novel', 'almost', 'completely', 'Tolstoy', 'essays', 'fate', 'war', '.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'star', 'miniseries', 'playing', 'role', 'Pierre', 'Bezukhov', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Mr.', 'Hopkins', 'outstanding', 'job', 'Considering', 'huge', 'amount', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'screen', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'exhausted', 'end', 'shoot', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'many', 'casting', 'choices', 'actors', 'Russian', 'version', 'War', 'Peace', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'aligned', 'characters', 'play', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'BBC', 'choice', 'part', 'Natasha', 'actress', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'was', 'fine', 'However', 'being', '29-year-old', 'woman', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', '12', '13', 'years', 'old', 'first', 'scene', 'course', 'Natasha', 'twenties', 'course', 'novel', 'miniseries', 'still', 'actress', 'good', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'Also', 'casting', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'mean', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'Kuragin', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'well.All', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'flawed', 'considering', 'budget', 'think', 'production', 'team', 'did', 'miraculous', 'job', 'appreciate', 'lengths', 'went', 'order', 'bring', 'entire', 'novel', 'screen', 'King', 'Vidor', 'version', '1956', '3.5', 'hours', 'pales', 'comparison', 'even', 'everyone', 'love', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'subtitles', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'better', 'Russian', 'version', 'War', 'Peace', 'War', 'Peace']",War & Peace BBC Production  VHS

This adaptation does NOT follow the book much at all; although the general progression is the same, many scenes have been jumbled around from where they appear in the original novel.  As an introduction to the novel, this is a great place to start though.  If you have to watch W&P; start with Bondarchuk (for authenticity and fantastic battle sequences), this miniseries (for character study and completeness), and the Hollywood travesty starring Audrey Hepburn and Henry Fonda (for laughs).

409850,A1N5YEQ29VU3C2,6304246579,Trout26,"[13, 13]","The short answer up front is all three (the Hollywood/Hepburn version, the Bondarchuk/Russian version, and the BBC/Hopkins version).  Each sheds a different light on Tolstoy's work (which I have read three times, in different translations).  If you are completely unfamiliar with the work, I recommend starting with the Hollywood version.  At 3 hours, it is the shortest (by half), adequately acted (if not always well cast), has reasonably good sound and picture quality, and provides, at least in outline form, the major plot elements of the novel.  The Russian version is the definitive filming, with it's tens of thousands of extras, authentic locations, and a production budget that could not even be imagined in present-day Hollywood. The primary issues with this version relate to the long history of bad dubbing, bad subtitles, and arbitrary abridgements.  The Rusico (NOT the Kultur) release presents the movie in its original, un-cut, widescreen, 4-part version, with the ability to individually select (or turn off) dubbing and subtitles in any combination.  I cannot recommend this version highly enough (the sacking of Moscow makes the burning of Atlanta from GWTW look like a campfire, the palacial interiors are magnificent, and the Battle of the Borodino is completely unequalled on film). All of this being said, I believe that the BBC production is probably the best representation of the novel as a whole.  At 14 hours (over twice the length of the Russian version and four times the length of the Hollywood version), this one allows for complete character development and a real appreciation of Tolstoy's philosopies of war and culture.  Granted, the scope is not as large (there were only about 1,000 extras used, and the interiors are mostly all BBC studio sets), but the acting is universally superb, the English adaptation is excellent, and it tells the story in greater depth than either of the other two.
