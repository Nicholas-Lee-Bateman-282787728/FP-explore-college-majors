501879,A1SKV3DB53WE6U,B00000I1OB,"Alfuso ""Nomad & Standby""","[7, 10]","Despite the legend, only 150 men were lost and Nolan bore a good part of the responsibility for pointing off in a general direction and refusing to give details of his instructions.  Victorian politics and aristocrat feuds bore the rest.The first part of this film sets it remarkably well.  The convolutions of ""Class"" structure and arogance worked for years before this battle to lose the Light Brigade.Hemmings' Nolan isn't nearly arrogant enough. And Raglan and Cardigan were worse than presented.I personally enjoy reading about the intrigues of this battle and its unfortunate personalities.  The devil is in the details and this film details the wretched conditions of the unfortunate British grunt and the drudgery and distilled *filth* of War. Even the officers in this one were reduced to unwashed bodies and clothes for weeks. The Light Brigade went into battle looking like they'd already lost it.The horses fared worse, 5000 remounts dying of neglect and starvation in a pen in the harbor before the battle. Several hundred more lost in the battle -- more than the number of men lost.One of the better ""eye witness"" accounts of this Charge can be read in Anna Sewell's ""Black Beauty"" when old Captain -- a horse who survived -- gives his stablemates a blow by blow description.  Even the cavalry horses suffered from victimization by elitist arrogance.  This movie misses that. But given its grim subject matter, adding the slaughter of horses would make it unwatchable.I like the layering in this film.  It ""looks"" right.

501881,A3R35CW2QQ0PXN,B00000I1OB,B.,"[11, 12]","This movie ranks at the top of any war movie list. While climaxing with the legendary charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimeran War, the movie also provides an illuminating look into many aspects of Victorian military life and society.The costumes are just unbelievable. There are literally thousands of actors and extras in the movie, all in historically correct livery. The battle scenes alone are worth the price of the DVD. I marveled at the attention of detail and huge spectacle displayed on the screen.On the other hand, movie is a bit heavy handed in its treatment of the politics of the period. For example, there are several sections where the action switches to animated sequences. These segments both explain some of the overall political situation while providing a simplistic, but biting satire of the whole colonial British ambition.The attitudes and behavior of the British Officer corps and upper class in general are savagely treated.  Scene after scene depicts British upper class stupidity. From the officer who insists on finishing his soft boiled egg instead of leading his troops at a critical point in battle to Lord Cardigan's kinky one night stand with a junior officer's wife on the eve of the battle, the movie goes to great length to destroy the credibility of the British officer class. With such petty buffoons running the show, it's hard to imagine how the British built such a vast and wealthy empire.",5,Amazing spectacle with strong social and anti-war commentary,1034208000,"10 10, 2002",2002,1440,"['movie', 'top', 'war', 'movie', 'list', 'climaxing', 'legendary', 'charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'Crimeran', 'War', 'movie', 'also', 'illuminating', 'look', 'many', 'aspects', 'Victorian', 'military', 'life', 'society.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'literally', 'thousands', 'actors', 'extras', 'movie', 'historically', 'correct', 'livery', 'battle', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'marveled', 'attention', 'detail', 'huge', 'spectacle', 'displayed', 'screen.On', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'treatment', 'politics', 'period', 'example', 'are', 'several', 'sections', 'where', 'action', 'animated', 'sequences', 'segments', 'explain', 'overall', 'political', 'situation', 'providing', 'simplistic', 'biting', 'satire', 'whole', 'colonial', 'British', 'ambition.The', 'attitudes', 'behavior', 'British', 'Officer', 'corps', 'upper', 'class', 'general', 'are', 'savagely', 'treated', 'Scene', 'scene', 'depicts', 'British', 'upper', 'class', 'stupidity', 'officer', 'who', 'finishing', 'soft', 'boiled', 'egg', 'instead', 'leading', 'troops', 'critical', 'point', 'battle', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'kinky', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'junior', 'officer', 'wife', 'eve', 'battle', 'movie', 'great', 'length', 'destroy', 'credibility', 'British', 'officer', 'class', 'such', 'petty', 'buffoons', 'running', 'show', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'British', 'built', 'vast', 'wealthy', 'empire']",N/A
501882,A9ANMVCEOQ8P7,B00000I1OB,Bruce Trinque,"[8, 9]","As a depiction of history, this film of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" is considerably more accurate than the Errol Flynn film of the late 1930's.  The costumes are, for the most part authentic, and the military material is drawn from real events, even if there are some alterations (such as the actual victim in the ""black bottle"" incident) made evidently for the sake of brevity and drama.  Once nice touch is that the actual number of men and horse (670) who actually participated in the Charge were in fact used in this re-creation of the event, so the viewer does have some sense of how things actually looked.  Where the film most flagrantly departs from history is in the interaction of some of the characters, depicting for example a sexual liaison between Lord Cardigan and Fanny Duberly, something which never happened.  Made in the late 1960's the film had a very definitely anti-imperialistic ideological agenda, but is still a worthwhile depiction of the mid-Nineteenth Century British Army at war.

501883,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00000I1OB,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 4]","Sometimes a film tries to do too much and thus is criticized for over-reaching. This is certainly the case with the wonderful film ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"". The film attempts to give a full commentary on military life under Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. This was fascinating and well done for we see fellows going through every step; from recruitment through training and on to warfare. The recruiters would come into coal mining villages, inner city slums, and poor factory towns and recruit men and boys into the military. They were given a one shilling piece as a recruitment bonus but they had little idea of the hardships ahead. The aristocracy made up the officers and the wealthy were able to purchase military commissions and for a fee change regiments. The film tries to teach history as well as tell a story, a task that is difficult to achieve. The history of the Crimean War is often told with political cartoons showing the bear of Tsar Nicholas' Russia invade the Crimean peninsula, which is part of the crumbling Ottoman Empire in Turkey. England, France, and a few other states and principalities then declare war on Russia and attempt to drive Russia from the Crimean. The film also is a history lesson in poor leadership for the leadership of the British troops under Commander Lord Ragland, Lord Cardigan, and Lord Lucan.Tony Richardson's direction is masterful and the battle scenes are well filmed so that a viewer can make sense of the chaos. John Gielgud is superb as Commander Lord Ragland. Ragland makes every leadership mistake possible including underestimating the enemy, poor timing, poor use of military intelligence, inability to stop power struggles among the officers under his command, and an odd philosophy that competence is dangerous. Trevor Howard is equally superb as Lord Cardigan. Cardigan is a pompous egotistical narrow-minded abuser of power who is highly threatened by competence in younger officers. Harry Andrews plays Lord Lucan, Lord Cardigan's competitive advisory who interestingly enough is about as incompetent as Ragland and Cardigan. David Hemmings plays the bright innovative young officer, Captain Nolan, who runs head first into this military incompetence trio. Mark Burns and Vanessa Redgrave play a young married couple who are friends with Captain Nolan. Jill Bennett plays an officer's wife who has accompanied her husband on the campaign.The Crimean war was a disaster. Almost half the British troops died of cholera from contaminated drinking water. Lord Ragland takes 30,000 men onto the Crimean peninsula where he not only loses most of his men but also loses vast amounts of military equipment to the Russians and horses to mismanagement. The films is actually one of the finest anti-war films ever produced for it depicts how easily war becomes horrible nonsense in the face of disease and mismanagement.",4,A wonderful anti-war film,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,2885,"['Sometimes', 'film', 'tries', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'thus', 'criticized', 'over-reaching', 'certainly', 'case', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'film', 'attempts', 'give', 'full', 'commentary', 'military', 'life', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'Prince', 'Albert', 'was', 'fascinating', 'well', 'done', 'see', 'fellows', 'going', 'step', 'recruitment', 'training', 'warfare', 'recruiters', 'would', 'come', 'coal', 'mining', 'villages', 'inner', 'city', 'slums', 'poor', 'factory', 'towns', 'recruit', 'men', 'boys', 'military', 'were', 'given', 'one', 'shilling', 'piece', 'recruitment', 'bonus', 'had', 'little', 'idea', 'hardships', 'ahead', 'aristocracy', 'made', 'up', 'officers', 'wealthy', 'were', 'able', 'purchase', 'military', 'commissions', 'fee', 'change', 'regiments', 'film', 'tries', 'teach', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'tell', 'story', 'task', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'history', 'Crimean', 'War', 'often', 'told', 'political', 'cartoons', 'showing', 'bear', 'Tsar', 'Nicholas', 'Russia', 'invade', 'Crimean', 'peninsula', 'part', 'crumbling', 'Ottoman', 'Empire', 'Turkey', 'England', 'France', 'few', 'other', 'states', 'principalities', 'then', 'declare', 'war', 'Russia', 'attempt', 'drive', 'Russia', 'Crimean', 'film', 'also', 'history', 'lesson', 'poor', 'leadership', 'leadership', 'British', 'troops', 'Commander', 'Lord', 'Ragland', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'Lord', 'Lucan.Tony', 'Richardson', 'direction', 'masterful', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'filmed', 'so', 'viewer', 'can', 'make', 'sense', 'chaos', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'superb', 'Commander', 'Lord', 'Ragland', 'Ragland', 'leadership', 'mistake', 'possible', 'including', 'underestimating', 'enemy', 'poor', 'timing', 'poor', 'use', 'military', 'intelligence', 'inability', 'stop', 'power', 'struggles', 'officers', 'command', 'odd', 'philosophy', 'competence', 'dangerous', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'equally', 'superb', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'Cardigan', 'pompous', 'egotistical', 'narrow-minded', 'abuser', 'power', 'who', 'highly', 'threatened', 'competence', 'younger', 'officers', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'Lord', 'Lucan', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'competitive', 'advisory', 'who', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'as', 'incompetent', 'Ragland', 'Cardigan', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'bright', 'innovative', 'young', 'officer', 'Captain', 'Nolan', 'who', 'head', 'first', 'military', 'incompetence', 'trio', 'Mark', 'Burns', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'play', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'Captain', 'Nolan', 'Jill', 'Bennett', 'officer', 'wife', 'who', 'accompanied', 'husband', 'campaign.The', 'Crimean', 'war', 'was', 'disaster', 'Almost', 'British', 'troops', 'died', 'cholera', 'contaminated', 'drinking', 'water', 'Lord', 'Ragland', '30,000', 'men', 'Crimean', 'peninsula', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'most', 'men', 'also', 'vast', 'amounts', 'military', 'equipment', 'Russians', 'horses', 'mismanagement', 'films', 'actually', 'one', 'finest', 'anti-war', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'how', 'easily', 'war', 'horrible', 'nonsense', 'face', 'disease', 'mismanagement']",N/A
501884,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B00000I1OB,Cowboy Buddha,"[11, 13]","Bearing no resemblance whatsoever to the 1930's Errol Flynn version, this Charge Of The Light Brigade is a truly strange enterprise that takes a long and winding route to deliver its popular 1960's anti-war message. The film is by Tony Richardson, who directed the hugely successful Tom Jones, and the style and approach to both films is very similar, even though one was a comedy and the other a history. Richardson certainly provides plenty of period feel and detail. His depiction of some aspects of Victorian life is almost like a social history or even a Dickensian expose. Much of the dialogue is similarly stilted and archaic. The recreation of the 1850's is remarkable yet there are times when the viewer could justifiably cry out: ""Too much information!"" So intent is Richardson on providing a thorough social and political context to the famous military folly that the film's first half is a slow and uncertain affair, coming to life only when the troops arrive in the Crimea. And all the careful realism sits uneasily with the animated series of Punch-like cartoons that link the various portions of the film. So much style crammed into one movie...Still, we do get an incredibly accurate account of the Charge and the events leading up to it. Military incompetence and vanity is demonstrated over and over again, as are the evils of the British class system. The Charge itself is a fascinating sequence of superb film making - showing the horror and brutality (and stupidity?) of war while also stripping away any facades of heroism. Courage is both celebrated and lamented because it is wasted in a vague and worthless cause. But does the film really tell us anything we didn't already know?A brilliant cast helps to bring humanity to the spectacle and the preaching. The performances are all the more amazing considering some of the dialogue the actors have to work with. David Hemmings is outstanding in a role that manages to hold the film together. Trevor Howard is very good as the pompous Lord Cardigan while Harry Andrews more than matches him as Lord Lucan. John Gielgud stays just this side of comedy as the befuddled commander Lord Raglan. Norman Rossington is impressive as a common soldier. Jill Bennett makes a nice contribution as an officer's wife with loose morals but Vanessa Redgrave (the director's wife) has little to do but look pale and helpless.There is no doubt The Charge Of The Light Brigade is an extremely interesting film. Whether it is an entertaining or even enlightening one is very much a matter of taste. It has probably not worn as well as some other films from the 1960's. But it does have some undeniably powerful moments. It is basically a question of whether it is worth wading through everything else to get to those moments.",3,Over Charged...,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,2778,"['Bearing', 'resemblance', 'whatsoever', '1930', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'version', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'truly', 'strange', 'enterprise', 'long', 'winding', 'route', 'deliver', 'popular', '1960', 'anti-war', 'message', 'film', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'who', 'directed', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'style', 'approach', 'films', 'very', 'similar', 'even', 'one', 'was', 'comedy', 'other', 'history', 'Richardson', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'period', 'feel', 'detail', 'depiction', 'aspects', 'Victorian', 'life', 'almost', 'social', 'history', 'even', 'Dickensian', 'expose', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'similarly', 'stilted', 'archaic', 'recreation', '1850', 'remarkable', 'yet', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'viewer', 'could', 'justifiably', 'cry', 'out', 'Too', 'much', 'information', 'So', 'intent', 'Richardson', 'providing', 'thorough', 'social', 'political', 'context', 'famous', 'military', 'folly', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'slow', 'uncertain', 'affair', 'coming', 'life', 'only', 'when', 'troops', 'arrive', 'Crimea', 'careful', 'realism', 'sits', 'uneasily', 'animated', 'series', 'Punch-like', 'cartoons', 'link', 'various', 'portions', 'film', 'So', 'much', 'style', 'crammed', 'one', 'movie', 'Still', 'do', 'get', 'incredibly', 'accurate', 'account', 'Charge', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'Military', 'incompetence', 'vanity', 'demonstrated', 'over', 'again', 'are', 'evils', 'British', 'class', 'system', 'Charge', 'fascinating', 'sequence', 'superb', 'film', 'making', 'showing', 'horror', 'brutality', 'stupidity', 'war', 'also', 'stripping', 'away', 'facades', 'heroism', 'Courage', 'celebrated', 'lamented', 'wasted', 'vague', 'worthless', 'cause', 'film', 'really', 'tell', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'bring', 'humanity', 'spectacle', 'preaching', 'performances', 'are', 'more', 'amazing', 'considering', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'have', 'work', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'outstanding', 'role', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'very', 'good', 'pompous', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'more', 'matches', 'Lord', 'Lucan', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'just', 'side', 'comedy', 'befuddled', 'commander', 'Lord', 'Raglan', 'Norman', 'Rossington', 'impressive', 'common', 'soldier', 'Jill', 'Bennett', 'nice', 'contribution', 'officer', 'wife', 'loose', 'morals', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'director', 'wife', 'little', 'do', 'look', 'pale', 'doubt', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'film', 'entertaining', 'even', 'enlightening', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'matter', 'taste', 'probably', 'not', 'worn', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'films', '1960', 'have', 'undeniably', 'powerful', 'moments', 'basically', 'question', 'worth', 'wading', 'everything', 'else', 'get', 'moments']",N/A
501885,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00000I1OB,Craig Matteson,"[12, 13]","This is a well done and creative movie.  Frankly, I had expected it to play fast and loose with the history of this Victorian military catastrophe in order to make an anti-war statement since 1968 was the height of the Vietnam War and the anti-establishment culture was in full flower.  However, this movie treats the story with seriousness while using beautiful pictures and some wonderfully creative animation that helps evoke the times and move some aspects of the plot along.The animation is in the style of Victorian political cartoons and those that were used in newspaper advertisements of the time.  The animation used by Monty Python to segue between sketches is very close.  It is used to illustrate the masses being urged to a passion for war against the Russians over Turkey, to show the character of some of the officers, and to pierce the bubble of Victorian public respectability.Most of the movie sets up the characters and showing us how life was in 1854.  We learn about the Empire's military was really a collection of private units that were funded by wealthy Peers to the Realm and led by them regardless of their ability.  It was not nearly professional in the modern sense and that point is made several times by Captain Nolan (this is likely put on the character rather than being something held by the actual person).We see how the soldiers were recruited, trained, brutally disciplined, and the pettiness of certain high officers and their celebrity.  We follow the army to Turkey where the action described by Tennyson actually takes place.  The actual Charge of the Light Brigade actually happens in the last act and is, as Tennyson said, the result of multiple blunders.  The finest horsemen of the realm were ordered out to recapture British cannon were, instead, led into the maw of the Russian guns and one third of them were slaughtered and many more were wounded and the Light Brigade became the stuff of legend and buck passing.The movie is very well done, a delight to watch and enjoy all the bucolic scenery of Victorian times as well as the grime of the slums, and the strange attitude they held towards war and the appropriateness of wives to travel with the officers.Very much worth seeing.",5,A well done telling of a legendary military fiasco,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2230,"['well', 'done', 'creative', 'movie', 'Frankly', 'had', 'expected', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'history', 'Victorian', 'military', 'catastrophe', 'order', 'make', 'anti-war', 'statement', '1968', 'was', 'height', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'anti-establishment', 'culture', 'was', 'full', 'flower', 'However', 'movie', 'story', 'seriousness', 'using', 'beautiful', 'pictures', 'wonderfully', 'creative', 'animation', 'evoke', 'times', 'move', 'aspects', 'plot', 'along.The', 'animation', 'style', 'Victorian', 'political', 'cartoons', 'were', 'used', 'newspaper', 'advertisements', 'time', 'animation', 'used', 'Monty', 'Python', 'segue', 'sketches', 'very', 'close', 'used', 'illustrate', 'masses', 'being', 'urged', 'passion', 'war', 'Russians', 'Turkey', 'show', 'character', 'officers', 'pierce', 'bubble', 'Victorian', 'public', 'respectability.Most', 'movie', 'up', 'characters', 'showing', 'how', 'life', 'was', '1854', 'learn', 'Empire', 'military', 'was', 'really', 'collection', 'private', 'units', 'were', 'funded', 'wealthy', 'Peers', 'Realm', 'led', 'regardless', 'ability', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'professional', 'modern', 'sense', 'point', 'made', 'several', 'times', 'Captain', 'Nolan', 'likely', 'put', 'character', 'rather', 'being', 'something', 'held', 'actual', 'person', '.We', 'see', 'how', 'soldiers', 'were', 'recruited', 'trained', 'brutally', 'disciplined', 'pettiness', 'certain', 'high', 'officers', 'celebrity', 'follow', 'army', 'Turkey', 'where', 'action', 'described', 'Tennyson', 'actually', 'place', 'actual', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'actually', 'last', 'act', 'Tennyson', 'said', 'result', 'multiple', 'blunders', 'finest', 'horsemen', 'realm', 'were', 'ordered', 'out', 'recapture', 'British', 'cannon', 'were', 'instead', 'led', 'maw', 'Russian', 'guns', 'one', 'third', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'many', 'more', 'were', 'wounded', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'became', 'stuff', 'legend', 'buck', 'passing.The', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'delight', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'bucolic', 'scenery', 'Victorian', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'grime', 'slums', 'strange', 'attitude', 'held', 'towards', 'war', 'appropriateness', 'wives', 'travel', 'officers.Very', 'much', 'seeing']",N/A

Gielgud is brilliant as  the well-meaning but ineffectual &amp; absent-minded Commander-In-Chief,  Lord Raglan. Harry Andrews glowers and booms as Lord &quot;Look-On&quot;,  Lieutenant General of the Cavalry Division. Trevor Howard &quot;is&quot;  the irrascible Lord Cardigan (quote of the month about his &quot;cherry  bums&quot;: &quot;If they can't fornicate they can't fight, and if they  can't fight I'll flog their backsides raw for all their fine  looks!&quot;)David Hemmings provides the requisite &quot;dash and  fire&quot; as the ill-fated Nolan.This movie is very clever, setting the  scene in England first by illustrating the differences between the genteel  and idle lives of the officers and the sordid lives of the common troopers.  There is also an interesting sub-plot to do with the breaking to the ranks  of a Sergeant Major.The depiction of military folly, absurd rivalries  and infighting amongst Raglan's senior officers, sickness and disease  whilst campaigning and of course such battle sequences as the taking of the  river Alma, really make this movie. It's marred only by some very stupid  sub plots concerning Lord Cardigan's supposed affair with Mrs. Duberly, as  well as Hemming's own adulterous affair with the Vanessa Redgrave  character, which - aside from illustrating some obscure point about  Victorian morality &amp; sexual repression - I couldn't figure out what was  the point!The sequences of the actual charge &quot;into the valley of  death&quot; could have been dealt with better and the film comes to a  strange and abrupt ending right afterwards. However, minor quibbles aside,  as a military history buff I was impressed by how accurate the film-maker  attempted to be when depicting the sequence of events, from the  heart-failure of the French commander, to Ragland's insistence on  husbanding his cavalry brigades to the derision of the rest of the army, to  the refusal of Sir Colin Campbell to form his men up shortly before the  battle of Balaclava.And who could forget the splendid Victorian cartoon  animated sequences!They really ought to make a movie of Flashman At The  Charge next, I think.",4,Where was Lord Look-On..?,966816000,"08 21, 2000",2000,2412,"['Simply', 'put', 'got', 'be', 'one', ""'the"", 'best', 'big', 'screen', 'dramatisations', 'war', 'Victorian', 'era', 'spots', 'Zulu', 'how', 'can', 'even', 'think', 'depicting', 'Chard', 'Bromhead', 'characteristic', 'handlebar', 'moustaches', 'casting', 'superb', 'Gielgud', 'brilliant', 'well-meaning', 'ineffectual', 'amp', 'absent-minded', 'Commander-In-Chief', 'Lord', 'Raglan', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'glowers', 'booms', 'Lord', 'quot', 'Look-On', 'quot', 'Lieutenant', 'General', 'Cavalry', 'Division', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'quot', 'quot', 'irrascible', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'quote', 'month', 'quot', 'cherry', 'bums', 'quot', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fornicate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', ""'ll"", 'flog', 'backsides', 'raw', 'fine', 'quot', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'requisite', 'quot', 'dash', 'fire', 'quot', 'ill-fated', 'Nolan.This', 'movie', 'very', 'clever', 'setting', 'scene', 'England', 'first', 'illustrating', 'differences', 'genteel', 'idle', 'lives', 'officers', 'sordid', 'lives', 'common', 'troopers', 'also', 'interesting', 'sub-plot', 'do', 'breaking', 'ranks', 'Sergeant', 'Major.The', 'depiction', 'military', 'folly', 'absurd', 'rivalries', 'infighting', 'amongst', 'Raglan', 'senior', 'officers', 'sickness', 'disease', 'whilst', 'campaigning', 'course', 'such', 'battle', 'sequences', 'taking', 'river', 'Alma', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'marred', 'only', 'very', 'stupid', 'sub', 'plots', 'concerning', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'supposed', 'affair', 'Mrs.', 'Duberly', 'as', 'well', 'Hemming', 'own', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'character', 'aside', 'illustrating', 'obscure', 'point', 'Victorian', 'morality', 'amp', 'sexual', 'repression', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'sequences', 'actual', 'charge', 'quot', 'valley', 'death', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'better', 'film', 'strange', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'right', 'afterwards', 'However', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'aside', 'military', 'history', 'buff', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'accurate', 'film-maker', 'attempted', 'be', 'when', 'depicting', 'sequence', 'events', 'heart-failure', 'French', 'commander', 'Ragland', 'insistence', 'husbanding', 'cavalry', 'brigades', 'derision', 'rest', 'army', 'refusal', 'Sir', 'Colin', 'Campbell', 'form', 'men', 'up', 'shortly', 'battle', 'Balaclava.And', 'who', 'could', 'forget', 'splendid', 'Victorian', 'cartoon', 'animated', 'sequences', 'really', 'ought', 'make', 'movie', 'Flashman', 'Charge', 'next', 'think']",N/A

Wedekind ""Mr. Weekend""","[7, 7]","This 1968 version of the Charge of the Light Brigade was, for the most part, an accurate portrayal of the British Army at the time of the Crimean War in 1854. The uniforms and actions of both officers and rankers are depicted as they were. A few scenes that didn't happen during the war, however, were thrown in for dramatic effect and to create tension among the various characters involved in the film leading up to the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade. One episode shown in the movie that was inaccurately presented was the ""Black Bottle Affair."" Lord Cardigan (played by Trevor Howard), a snob and buffoon in real life, accused one of his officers, Capt. John Reynolds, a former ""East India Company Officer"" whom he despised, and not, as shown in the movie, Capt. Lewis Edward Nolan (David Hemmings), of serving a bottle of porter in the officers mess instead of champagne as he had ordered to be served. Another scene has Cardigan plying Mrs. Fanny Duberly (Jill Bennet) with drink in order to seduce her. Although Cardigan was a notorious womanizer, he was never accused of having an illicit affair with Fanny. Those minor inaccuracies aside, this was a very good film about the incompetence of the British General Staff during the war that led to the destruction of the Light Brigade. I will admit though, the 1936 movie version starring Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland was much more exciting despite the many glaring historical inaccuracies.

As an adult, I studied the history of the Crimean War (along with other history).  I don't know how I missed this film until now.More accurate by far than the 1939 film, this film examines the claim that glory can be extracted from a series of blunders, incompetences and personality conflicts in the field.  Supported by a wonderful caste playing their roles imppecably, this 1968 remake is devoid of the romance or righteousness of the 1939 film.  I still love the old one, but more for it's romance than accurracy.  This remake does the exact opposite of the Flynn/de Haviland film.  Romance is represented here by a desolate one night stand between Cardigan and one of his subbordinate officer's wives who plays the part of an empty headed beast, hungry for a thrill to the point of bloodthirstiness against Trevor Howard's parody of Cardigan as a ridiculous lover/cavalier.The cartoons are interesting in their style and meaning and their use here causes me to wonder if Monty Python was inspired by their use in this film as it criticizes the ideas of empire and glory.  This is a film that could have only emerged from the compost of the Viet-Nam era.  I wonder how it was received in England since it criticizes all the old ideas of Empire, Queen, country and British chauvanism.  I wonder how much it contributed to the growth of permanent anti-war culture in Britain?  I'd love to read a review of this film from 1968.Few films that claim to be historically based are actually very factual.  There are only a few questionable incidents here.  I am not sure if the note was written inacurrately, but according to this film, Raglan only ordered an andvance with support that he wasn't sure was there and only assumed Lucan would understand the intention to flank the guns not charge them.  This film lays nearly the entire disaster on a Captain Norlan's head.  Noland seems to have understood the intention to flank the guns but after goading his superior officers into a straight on charge, seems to have a change of heart once he sees the devastating reality of their course.  He charges up and hysterically tries to force Cardigan to ride up the valley he seemed to know Raglan intended.  One strength of this film is that it creates a question as to whether anyone attempted to prompt the orders on the field.  Captain Noland was either a loose cannon or a scapgoat - we may never know.  A good historic film should have this effect - to inspire the acquisition of more historical knowledge.As for the charge itself, it is done as it should be, with no soundtract so that the viewer may experience the event without any other emotional support.  My only complaint is that the retreat was also fired upon and the impression is given here that once the cannon lines were reached all firing by the Russians ceased.  Russian calvary did charge in once the guns were breached, but the Brigade was fired upon as it withdrew and the Russians did not pursue.  Cardigan is unscathed, but little account is given the viewer as to how that luck transpired.  A small group that held to him did reach the guns and retreat out.  He must have ultimately been protected by the press of his own men around him.  I think the charge itself should have lasted longer since the this is the climax and the film's title.  A lot more story could have been portrayed such as Cardigan's ride and the 670 horses and men filmed represented more fully.  Think of the effect of a charge that goes on and on to the point that the audience feels that there is no escape.Ultimately, this is an anti-war film and no surprise here.  Perhaps it is a bit exaggerated in some of its scenes, but the point is well made.  War is hell and not entertainment as the horrified spectators attending this expedition find.  That scene, of the sobering of those who revile in the excitment of war, is well done.  Still, the mystery of glory survives.  The few men left on their feet volunteer to ""go again"" prompting Cardigan's gallant understated reply, ""No,no, you've done enough today.""",5,Glory Examined,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,4171,"['boy', 'thrilled', '1939', 'film', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'read', 'Tennyson', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'class', 'adult', 'studied', 'history', 'Crimean', 'War', 'other', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'missed', 'film', 'now.More', 'accurate', 'far', '1939', 'film', 'film', 'claim', 'glory', 'can', 'be', 'extracted', 'series', 'blunders', 'incompetences', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'field', 'Supported', 'wonderful', 'caste', 'playing', 'roles', 'imppecably', '1968', 'remake', 'devoid', 'romance', 'righteousness', '1939', 'film', 'still', 'love', 'old', 'one', 'more', 'romance', 'accurracy', 'remake', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Flynn/de', 'Haviland', 'film', 'Romance', 'represented', 'here', 'desolate', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Cardigan', 'one', 'subbordinate', 'officer', 'wives', 'who', 'plays', 'part', 'empty', 'headed', 'beast', 'hungry', 'thrill', 'point', 'bloodthirstiness', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'parody', 'Cardigan', 'ridiculous', 'lover/cavalier.The', 'cartoons', 'are', 'interesting', 'style', 'meaning', 'use', 'here', 'wonder', 'Monty', 'Python', 'was', 'inspired', 'use', 'film', 'ideas', 'empire', 'glory', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'emerged', 'compost', 'Viet-Nam', 'era', 'wonder', 'how', 'was', 'received', 'England', 'old', 'ideas', 'Empire', 'Queen', 'country', 'British', 'chauvanism', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'contributed', 'growth', 'permanent', 'anti-war', 'culture', 'Britain', ""'d"", 'love', 'read', 'review', 'film', '1968.Few', 'films', 'claim', 'be', 'historically', 'based', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'factual', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'questionable', 'incidents', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'note', 'was', 'written', 'inacurrately', 'according', 'film', 'Raglan', 'only', 'ordered', 'andvance', 'support', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'only', 'assumed', 'Lucan', 'would', 'understand', 'intention', 'flank', 'guns', 'not', 'charge', 'film', 'nearly', 'entire', 'disaster', 'Captain', 'Norlan', 'head', 'Noland', 'have', 'understood', 'intention', 'flank', 'guns', 'goading', 'superior', 'officers', 'straight', 'charge', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'devastating', 'reality', 'course', 'up', 'hysterically', 'tries', 'force', 'Cardigan', 'ride', 'up', 'valley', 'seemed', 'know', 'Raglan', 'intended', 'One', 'strength', 'film', 'question', 'anyone', 'attempted', 'prompt', 'orders', 'field', 'Captain', 'Noland', 'was', 'loose', 'cannon', 'scapgoat', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'good', 'historic', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'effect', 'inspire', 'acquisition', 'more', 'historical', 'knowledge.As', 'charge', 'done', 'should', 'be', 'soundtract', 'so', 'viewer', 'may', 'experience', 'event', 'other', 'emotional', 'support', 'only', 'complaint', 'retreat', 'was', 'also', 'fired', 'impression', 'given', 'here', 'once', 'cannon', 'lines', 'were', 'reached', 'firing', 'Russians', 'ceased', 'Russian', 'calvary', 'did', 'charge', 'once', 'guns', 'were', 'breached', 'Brigade', 'was', 'fired', 'withdrew', 'Russians', 'did', 'not', 'pursue', 'Cardigan', 'unscathed', 'little', 'account', 'given', 'viewer', 'how', 'luck', 'transpired', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'held', 'did', 'reach', 'guns', 'retreat', 'out', 'must', 'have', 'ultimately', 'been', 'protected', 'press', 'own', 'men', 'think', 'charge', 'should', 'have', 'lasted', 'longer', 'climax', 'film', 'title', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'such', 'Cardigan', 'ride', '670', 'horses', 'men', 'filmed', 'represented', 'more', 'fully', 'Think', 'effect', 'charge', 'point', 'audience', 'feels', 'escape.Ultimately', 'anti-war', 'film', 'surprise', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'bit', 'exaggerated', 'scenes', 'point', 'well', 'made', 'War', 'hell', 'not', 'entertainment', 'horrified', 'spectators', 'attending', 'expedition', 'find', 'scene', 'sobering', 'who', 'revile', 'excitment', 'war', 'well', 'done', 'Still', 'mystery', 'glory', 'survives', 'few', 'men', 'left', 'feet', 'volunteer', 'go', 'again', 'prompting', 'Cardigan', 'gallant', 'understated', 'reply', 'No', ""'ve"", 'done', 'enough', 'today']",N/A

Much time is devoted to showing the pomposity and ignorance of the ruling class, who think that war is a wonderful enterprise full of glory and honor. More thought is given to not ruffling the feathers of political allies than it is to drawing up battle plans.The film has a very strange atmosphere. It's part documentary, part soap opera, part auteur classic. The film has a hint of Peter Greenaway's work about it, with odd character interaction, and a strange voyeuristic feel. On top of that, there are odd animated segments sprinkled throughout the picture that express the patriotic fervor and thinking of the day. Now, all that may sound like a negative criticism, but the film, despite the stranger elements on display, is very compelling, and seems to be very accurate in regards to the events and atittudes of the men involved.The highlight of the film is, of course, the Charge of the Light Brigade against heavily fortified Russian positions. The ignorance and incompetence of the commanders still persists even in the face of tragic disaster. The film is a very strong dissertation on the stupidity and the cause and effect of war, using the famous Crimean battle as a foundation.And the charge itself?

501897,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B00000I1OB,Octavius,"[42, 44]","Tony Richardson's 1968 satire of Victorian imperialism set during the Crimean War of 1854-1855. A clever film with subtle humor that is very rich in covering the details of Victorian society such as clothing, mannerisms, class structure, institutions, etc. Although it has somewhat of an uneven plot with strange editing, this film is very well acted with beautiful cinematography.The film is primarily a satirical tragedy as opposed to being an action-drama typical of your standard war films such as 'Saving Private Ryan' for example. The film therefore mostly focuses on the characters' development within their social ranks, how they interact with each other, and what effect their interactions have on society or on them collectively. The film follows the central character, Captain Lewis Edward Nolan of the 15th Hussars. Nolan is a historical character who was a veteran of the wars in India and on very bad terms with his commander, Lord Cardigan (Howard), a boorish man with little concern for his suboordinates. Captain Nolan is also best friends with Mr. Richardson (Mark Burns) and, unfortunately, more than best friends with Mrs. Richardson(Vanessa Redgrave.) Both Nolan and Richardson are longing to see some action with their cavalry regiment and their wishes are soon fulfilled when war breaks out with Russia. Under the command of Earl Lucan and Cardigan (who both hate each other immensely), they are shipped off to the Crimea to join the French and the Turks against the Russians.Again, the title of the film is somewhat deceptive as the legendary charge of the light brigade takes up but the last 15 minutes of the 2+ hour film. Interestingly enough, the duration of the film battle sequence is about the same length as the actual charge: less than 20 minutes. The film is pretty accurate as to the battle but omits the details of the first engagements that took place on October 25, 1854, at the battle of Balaklava. The film does show how the ill prepared British and allied forces were driven back from the Causeway Heights by the Russians and how their canons were taken. The film also shows how Lord Raglan (John Gielgud) issued a rather ambiguous order to recouperate the 'Russian guns' without saying which ones. As such, the Light Brigade headed directly through the North valley towards the furthest Russian gun emplacements to the East as opposed to charging towards the nearest gun emplacements to the South-East on the Causeway Heights. This meant an extended charge through a valley in which the enemy commanded three sides with artillery, infantry, and cavalry contingents. Although the brigade succeeded in dislodging the artillery and routing the Russian cavalry, their numbers were too few to capitalize on their gains: they instead withdrew back to their original positions in an ordered fashion. Starting with approximately 600 men, they returned with only about 200 men. Despite the blunder, their mad charge was undertaken with such order and discipline that, for the rest of the Crimean War, the Russians would often refuse to fight the British cavalry even when they had a significant numerical superiority.In sum, this film is primarily a social and political satire on Victorian England. A viewer would probably have more of an appreciation for this film if he/she's familiar with the social and political norms of that period. This is not a war film per se as most of the plot unfolds in the peaceful and stuffy surroundings of Victorian London. I agree with the other reviewers that the animated political cartoons are a little overdone. The humor in this film being so subtle, the animation serves to expressly remind the audience that the film is more a satire and not a true drama.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[0, 3]","I'm a huge fan of all things European and especially anything to do with Russia... and that is certainly the subject here. The Crimean War was fought when a mid-19th Century Russian Tsar decided to expand his realm south into the lands of the Turks. Access in and out of The Black Sea and to port cities there had always represented a priority concern for the Russians both economically and to benefit their Navy as well.When the Russians finally invaded, the British and the French formed a tenuous alliance to defend the interests and rights of Turkey. The Russians were soon solidly entrenched, particularly in the key strategic region of Savastopol, (Leo Tolstoy was actually a young artilleryman here!), and it became a British priority to soundly defeat these invaders and to send Ivan packing home.All this military build-up eventually led to the so-called *Charge of the Light Brigade,* the subject of the famous poem and a disasterous military engagement for the British. Two key British Army figures associated with the land battles were Lord Cardigan and Lord Raglan, although many more officers of both land and naval forces, some great and some awful, were intimately involved in this conflict. If you wish to know the historical details of this little-known (at least in America) war, I can highly recommendCrimea: The Great Crimean War, 1854-1856.As for this 1968 film, it seems unbearably long and, except for the actual Charge of the Light Brigade near the conclusion of the movie, the boredom becomes fairly grueling. Keep in mind that I particularly love films produced in this window of time (1960s-70s), I'm really keen on British films, and my interest in this specific topic could not be more enthusiastic. It was all I could do to view this footage in one setting.The focus is, of course, on the long build-up to the war, commencing with the training and drilling of the cavalry recruits back in England, their personal relationships, and so on. The exposition of Lord Cardigan's gross incompetence and mean-spiritedness is also a major component of the story.Honestly, I really wish that the entirety of the film was as superb as the savory few moments where well more than 600 British cavalrymen charge the Russian artillery (and subsequently get decimated); however, the average person who is only mildly interested in historical films is going to doze through most of this unfortunate production.The cinematography is excellent in this letterbox color production and the casting and historical outfitting are pretty tops as well but beyond that, there's not much here for most folks.",3,I had hoped for much more -- a slow-mover (details),1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,2611,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'things', 'European', 'especially', 'anything', 'do', 'Russia', 'certainly', 'subject', 'here', 'Crimean', 'War', 'was', 'fought', 'when', 'mid-19th', 'Century', 'Russian', 'Tsar', 'decided', 'expand', 'realm', 'south', 'lands', 'Turks', 'Access', 'Black', 'Sea', 'port', 'cities', 'there', 'had', 'always', 'represented', 'priority', 'concern', 'Russians', 'economically', 'benefit', 'Navy', 'well.When', 'Russians', 'finally', 'invaded', 'British', 'French', 'formed', 'tenuous', 'alliance', 'defend', 'interests', 'rights', 'Turkey', 'Russians', 'were', 'soon', 'solidly', 'entrenched', 'particularly', 'key', 'strategic', 'region', 'Savastopol', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'was', 'actually', 'young', 'artilleryman', 'here', 'became', 'British', 'priority', 'soundly', 'defeat', 'invaders', 'send', 'Ivan', 'packing', 'home.All', 'military', 'build-up', 'eventually', 'led', 'so-called', '*Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'subject', 'famous', 'poem', 'disasterous', 'military', 'engagement', 'British', 'Two', 'key', 'British', 'Army', 'figures', 'associated', 'land', 'battles', 'were', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'Lord', 'Raglan', 'many', 'more', 'officers', 'land', 'naval', 'forces', 'great', 'awful', 'were', 'intimately', 'involved', 'conflict', 'wish', 'know', 'historical', 'details', 'little-known', 'least', 'America', 'war', 'can', 'highly', 'recommendCrimea', 'Great', 'Crimean', 'War', '1854-1856.As', '1968', 'film', 'unbearably', 'long', 'actual', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'boredom', 'fairly', 'grueling', 'Keep', 'mind', 'particularly', 'love', 'films', 'produced', 'window', 'time', '1960s-70s', ""'m"", 'really', 'keen', 'British', 'films', 'interest', 'specific', 'topic', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'view', 'footage', 'one', 'setting.The', 'focus', 'course', 'long', 'build-up', 'war', 'commencing', 'training', 'drilling', 'cavalry', 'back', 'England', 'personal', 'relationships', 'so', 'exposition', 'Lord', 'Cardigan', 'gross', 'incompetence', 'mean-spiritedness', 'also', 'major', 'component', 'story.Honestly', 'really', 'wish', 'entirety', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'superb', 'savory', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'well', 'more', '600', 'British', 'cavalrymen', 'charge', 'Russian', 'artillery', 'subsequently', 'get', 'decimated', 'however', 'average', 'person', 'who', 'only', 'mildly', 'interested', 'historical', 'films', 'going', 'doze', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'production.The', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'letterbox', 'color', 'production', 'casting', 'historical', 'outfitting', 'are', 'pretty', 'tops', 'well', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'most', 'folks']",N/A

Morrison,"[1, 2]","Tony Richardson's &#34;The Charge of the Light Brigade&#34; provides a necessary correction to the warmongering vision of both Tennyson's poem and the film version starring Erol Flynn.  These two works claim heroism where there is only senseless slaughter, an uncaring and power hungry empire, and a less-than-human military hierarchy.  Richardson's version exposes all three of these evils in a film that, though it is sometimes inconsistent in its satiric, tone, is nevertheless on target most of the time.  The actors are effectively caught up in script's intentions, and they deliver performances that are perfect for the context.

This re-make of the old 1936 Errol Flynn classic bares little resemblence, but is more historically accurate.For background sets, unifroms and period feel this movie has few equals. Only the 1968 Waterloo movie can compare with its sets and costumes. The historical accuracy of these sorts of things is what maks this movie a visual treat. The storyline itself is a little hard to follow at times. Depictions of regimental life in the cavalry is excellent, but the Britishisms of the actors are also hard to understand. The story provides striking contrasts between the upper and lower classes in Victorian England, but the droppy romance between Captain Noland and Captain Morris's wife seems contrieved. Although both actual characters, I doubt they knew each other so well, as they were both in different regiments. The adulturous affair is added for plots sake.Lord Cardigan is brilliantly played by Trevor Howard, although a number of his famous controversial ""Black Bottle"" scenes have been combined and attributed to Noland and him. Again this didn't happen, but it is a minor alteration for plot and it does not hurt the movie. It allows us to still see the characters of Cardigan and Noland accurately within the context of the film.Lord Raglan in all his feebleness is also wonderfully portrayed by Sir John Gielgud. The movie accurately shows the Victorian mindset of the British army which was shockingly conservetive but incredibly brave. More details on the battle of the Alma as as well as the events leading up to the Charge at Balaklava would have been nice. Perhaps the editing axed out the Charge of the Heavy Briagde and the 93rd Highlanders Thin Red Line. These episodes would have placed the Light Brigade Charge in better perspective.Still, the depiction of the charge is extremly good and must rank as one the best shown on film. The fact that the director actually used 600 men and horses for the scene is an indication of how much detail was used for this film. This kind of production value is not seen much these days. Cinema and history buffs should love this movie. It deserves to be watched several times as dialogue and rich scenes should be savored over and over again.

Would you ask they fight like fiends of Hell  for money? Or h'ideas? That would be unchristian.""The Charge of the Light Brigade is one of those films that disappointed me on a first viewing (like many, I was expecting an epic adventure film) but which I love more each time I see it.Charles Wood's delicious use of language makes the dialog a joy to listen to, and for the most part the performances do it justice - not just the likes of Trevor Howard, Harry Andrews and John Gielgud's delightfully vague Lord Raglan, but also the smaller roles like Norman Rossington's broken Sergeant and Alan Dobie's impoverished officer Mogg, who makes up in jovial and ignorant arrogance what he lacks in wit. It's an astonishingly ambitious film, and for the most part succeeds, painting a portrait not just of a time and place but a whole state of mind - it's not just the bungles of the Crimean War and the casual cruelty of the army in Richardson's sights but the blind stupidity of Britain's entire Victorian class system.The film is even brave enough to have its nominal hero, David Hemmings' Captain Nolan, be as inadvertently unsympathetic as the superiors he rails against - he might seem more enlightened, but he'll still thoughtlessly finish off his men's breakfast (in one of several scenes cut for this DVD) or push away a wounded soldier. As careless with his men as Raglan is, you can see his point when he dreads the day when professional soldiers like Nolan will run a modern army - ""It will be a sad day for England when her armies are led by men who know too well what they are doing- it smacks of murder.""Perhaps it's that lack of someone to root for that helped kill the film at the box-office (along with Richardson's refusal to have press screenings because he felt critics were not intelligent enough to appreciate the film), but I'd still love to see the four-hour rough cut footage emerge from its prison in the BFI's vaults some day. Several stills exist of deleted scenes (such as Cardigan's encounter with Russian troops on his return from the charge: they let him go in respect of his rank in reality) and although his part as a Russian Prince was otherwise completely cut, Laurence Harvey can still be briefly glimpsed in the theatre scene (along with Donald Wolfit playing MacBeth).What gaps were left by the cuts and budget restrictions (not that the film isn't genuinely spectacular) are admirably filled in by Richard Williams stunningly imaginative and witty animation - old woodcut prints come to life as the British lion puts on his policeman's helmet to stop Russia assaulting Turkey - and John Addison's magnificent score. Amazingly, the pity of it all is not lost under the wit, with the starkest of endings as the generals argue over whose fault it is while flies buzz around dead horses. A truly great film.Sadly, this is not a great DVD.The transfer is for the most part fine, but the animation sequences and the all but unreadable credits do suffer. What really disappoints is the fact that, like the previous laserdisc issue, this is a heavily cut version missing some 6-7 minutes. The ommission of Vanessa Redgrave's horrendous singing may be a merciful release, but the ommission of a reel from the Crimea scenes (including the flogging scene of a sentry who inadvertently shot at Raglan and Cardigan subsequently rewarding the flogged man for his bravery) are definitely not. The only extra is a trailer.Sadly, it appears that despite releasing a video of the longer version (minus a few seconds of vicious horsefalls), the BFI's R2 DVD is the same cut version, albeit with slightly better extras (an interview with Richard Williams and a silent version of the Charge).

Alas, the force was doomed to fail because of the very structure of rich and poor, expectations and experience.How strange it was to see a well-educated and seasoned officer treated poorly because he had been in India.  He knew horses and men and how to bond them into a single fighting unit.  He knew the strategy of winning a war.  Yet, in battle, the generals watched the enemy steal the British guns and allowed it to happen because they could not believe a ""gentleman"" would do this.  No one would listen, or look at the obvious theft as a threat.Each of the segues could have been political cartoons of the time used in some of the animations, I don't know.  However, I found these segues laughable and irritating.  The romantic triangle sub plot was not developed, but when the ""other man"" was killed, I was surprised.I wanted to experience the historical battle, but came away feeling that they certainly needed Patton in that war.  The most telling statement of the war was something like: ""The day an Englishman knows more about war and uses it would be shameful, it would be like murder.""At least it isn't ""The Piano,"" we said as we watched it, but decided in the end that the joke was on those of us who actually sat through it.Victoria Tarrani",1,Full of promise that  it never quite filled.,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,1494,"['historical', 'situations', 'building', 'light', 'Calvary', 'troop', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'differences', 'wealthy', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'impressive', 'common', 'man', 'did', 'indeed', 'become', 'members', 'elite', 'force', 'Alas', 'force', 'was', 'doomed', 'fail', 'very', 'structure', 'rich', 'poor', 'expectations', 'experience.How', 'strange', 'was', 'see', 'well-educated', 'seasoned', 'officer', 'treated', 'poorly', 'had', 'been', 'India', 'knew', 'horses', 'men', 'how', 'bond', 'single', 'fighting', 'unit', 'knew', 'strategy', 'winning', 'war', 'battle', 'generals', 'watched', 'enemy', 'steal', 'British', 'guns', 'allowed', 'happen', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'gentleman', 'would', 'do', 'one', 'would', 'listen', 'look', 'obvious', 'theft', 'threat.Each', 'segues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'political', 'cartoons', 'time', 'used', 'animations', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'However', 'found', 'segues', 'laughable', 'irritating', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'sub', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'developed', 'when', 'other', 'man', 'was', 'killed', 'was', 'surprised.I', 'wanted', 'experience', 'historical', 'battle', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'certainly', 'needed', 'Patton', 'war', 'most', 'telling', 'statement', 'war', 'was', 'something', 'day', 'Englishman', 'more', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'shameful', 'would', 'be', 'murder', 'least', ""n't"", 'Piano', 'said', 'watched', 'decided', 'end', 'joke', 'was', 'who', 'actually', 'sat', 'it.Victoria', 'Tarrani']",N/A
