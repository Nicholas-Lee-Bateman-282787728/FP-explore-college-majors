564279,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B00005221P,Amber,"[3, 5]","This has been one of my favorite shows for years. The English dub is actually very good (especially compared to Cardcaptors and Sailor Moon S), and the animation is easy to look at. Digimon is action-filled and contains a lot of funny scenes. There is also such a diverse group of characters that it doesn't get boring. And they manage to explain the technical details in  a way that a child (or a teenager lacking techno-savvy knowledge) can understand. And no, this is not a Pokemon clone--This is a totally different concept. If you're looking for a Pokemon clone, check out Angelic Layer. The dolls in that show fight battles for their masters, much the way that the Pokemon do. The Digimon are sentient, evolved (no joke intended) beings that are capable of living without humans.This is a wonderful series, and I'm hoping (praying) that the other two parts of Digimon 01 and the second season (Digimon 02) are put on DVD.Oh, and these voices actors manage to pronounce the names correctly ALL THE TIME. Too bad the same can't be said for the actors who did Cardcaptors. To not even be able to pronounce a simple name like Sakura or Kero...sad.Anyway, for those of you flamers of Digimon, I suggest you WATCH the show before you condemn it. That is the only way I'll accept your flames. And I HAVE seen the dub and sub versions of Cardcaptors/Card Captor Sakura, and prefer the sub. And Pokemon...I've seen the dub and sub as well, but don't have an opinion.So, GO WATCH DIGIMON!

At first I hated this show, due to the childish storyline, something that you'll expect to find in a children anime. However, this wasn't the case as the show progressed. It began showing more mature theme and storylines. As I began to watched the episodes, I was eventually hooked and searched high and low for the previous episodes on DVD. To my disappointment they only had it on VHS. But soon I found out that 13 episodes was coming out on DVD, I quickly put my order in and I am sooo glad that I have a copy. I've been watching the episodes over and over again, I just can't get enough.

564281,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00005221P,Carl Cheng,"[38, 38]","When it first came out, I was skeptical.  I did think it was going to be a Pokemon clone as many other type shows were coming out.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Now with the show spanning four seasons (with only the first two connecting), it makes me appreciate more the greatness that is Digimon.  I have to admit that the new seasons just do not live up to my enjoyment of the first two seasons.  I felt it had better flow, better depth, and much better characters.  The whole cast was very likeable and whether that was due to Saban's part in casting great voices or not, I commend them with that.  It is sad to not be able to hear the Japanese counterpart or see it un-edited but it is understandable and I will take what I can get.More about the show.  The first series starts out with seven kids at a summer camp: Tai (Taichi), Izumi (Izzy), Sora, Jo, Mimi, Matt (Yamato), and his brother TK (Takeru).  Unknownst to them but that was where they would embark on a journey of epic proportions (to be cliche).  They see these lights sparkling in the sky like the aurora borealis and then they get their digivices, mysterious handheld machines that help them with their digimons' evolutions and get transported to the Digital World.  They all land in slightly different places and waiting for them were their own respective Digimon.  They got no time to rest as one mean digimon was there to put pressure on them.  The series goes on with MANY plot twists, new evolutions, and amazing themes of courage and friendship.  It might seem cliche and cheesy but it really touched me and it was all done in a very ingenious way.What compelled me to write this review was seeing that others shared my view on digimon.  I really hope what people get out of this review is to at least try watching the series.  Rent or borrow this DVD, watch the new episodes on TV on UPN (season 4), which shows some promise.  Though now that it seems that nothing is going on DVD, much less any home release, I feel a need to buy this DVD finally so that I can indulge in the nostalgia once again, .. and actually many times more.",5,Probably The Best Underrated Series,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,2116,"['When', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'skeptical', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Pokemon', 'clone', 'as', 'many', 'other', 'type', 'shows', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'However', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Now', 'show', 'spanning', 'four', 'seasons', 'only', 'first', 'two', 'connecting', 'appreciate', 'more', 'greatness', 'Digimon', 'have', 'admit', 'new', 'seasons', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'enjoyment', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'felt', 'had', 'better', 'flow', 'better', 'depth', 'much', 'better', 'characters', 'whole', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'likeable', 'was', 'due', 'Saban', 'part', 'casting', 'great', 'voices', 'not', 'commend', 'sad', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'Japanese', 'counterpart', 'see', 'un-edited', 'understandable', 'will', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get.More', 'show', 'first', 'series', 'out', 'seven', 'kids', 'summer', 'camp', 'Tai', 'Taichi', 'Izumi', 'Izzy', 'Sora', 'Jo', 'Mimi', 'Matt', 'Yamato', 'brother', 'TK', 'Takeru', 'Unknownst', 'was', 'where', 'would', 'embark', 'journey', 'epic', 'proportions', 'be', 'cliche', 'see', 'lights', 'sparkling', 'sky', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'then', 'get', 'digivices', 'mysterious', 'handheld', 'machines', 'help', 'digimons', 'evolutions', 'get', 'transported', 'Digital', 'World', 'land', 'slightly', 'different', 'places', 'waiting', 'were', 'own', 'respective', 'Digimon', 'got', 'time', 'rest', 'one', 'mean', 'digimon', 'was', 'there', 'put', 'pressure', 'series', 'MANY', 'plot', 'twists', 'new', 'evolutions', 'amazing', 'themes', 'courage', 'friendship', 'might', 'seem', 'cliche', 'cheesy', 'really', 'touched', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'ingenious', 'way.What', 'compelled', 'write', 'review', 'was', 'seeing', 'others', 'shared', 'view', 'digimon', 'really', 'hope', 'what', 'people', 'get', 'review', 'least', 'try', 'watching', 'series', 'Rent', 'borrow', 'DVD', 'watch', 'new', 'episodes', 'TV', 'UPN', 'season', '4', 'promise', 'now', 'nothing', 'going', 'DVD', 'much', 'less', 'home', 'release', 'feel', 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'finally', 'can', 'indulge', 'nostalgia', 'once', 'again', '..', 'actually', 'many', 'times', 'more']",Digimon - Season 1
564282,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00005221P,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 3]","NOTE: This review focuses on the first two seasons of the entire Digimon series.Ever since Digimon: Digital Monsters aired on the now-defunct FOX KIDS Network back in 1999, some people have dismissed it as a hopeless clone of Pok&eacute;mon. But those who have done their research would know that in actuality the entire Digimon franchise was created BEFORE the Pok&eacute;mon franchise. It's just that the TV shows made it all look as if it was vice versa, since Pok&eacute;mon aired just one year before Digimon. Now, I was never a fan of this Japanese ""monster"" craze, but there was something intriguing about Digimon: Digital Monsters. As a matter of fact, compared to most animated kid's shows these days, this one is actually really good.It's time for Summer Camp, and seven young kids are about to get more than they expect during this time of year. They are somehow transported into another world, where they discover little creatures that evolve into larger beasts whenever there's danger. Seems like a simple premise, but later on in the series it becomes more complicated than usual. Even if it is a clich&eacute; that we've seen many times before (humans find themselves in a different fantastical world), the plot actually progresses as it steadily moves along. It's such an unusual find in kid shows these days, and Digimon is fairly unique in that it has some true plot development from beginning to end. The first thirteen episodes do look like they're intended for kids, but the second half of the first season look as if they're more for adolescents (same goes for the second season). Another thing I should add is that the show is scarcely formulaic. Each episode doesn't repeat itself with just one structure (unlike Pok&eacute;mon or Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, where many of their episodes actually look and feel the same). Granted, the digital monsters do ""digivolve"" somewhere near the end, but still the episodes don't feel like they've been rehashed over and over.But Digimon doesn't only succeed with plot development. I'm going to be perfectly clear about this: this show has some of the most interesting and realistic characters I have ever seen. I am serious: the human characters (Tai, Sora, Matt, Joe, etc.) are what make this show. Even though they're only kids, they do seem to have some unique qualities about them. Their distinctive personalities are what make them fascinating: Tai as the determined but sometimes foolish leader, Sora as the kind and caring tomboy, Matt as the silent lone wolf, Izzy as the clever computer geek, Mimi as the sweet but prissy girly girl, Joe as the no-nonsense ""voice of reason,"" and T.K. as Matt's positive younger brother. In the second season, you have Davis, Yolei, Cody, and Ken, and while they aren't as interesting as the characters in the first season, they are still pretty likeable in some corners. In addition to their distinctive personalities, these sorts of characters are closer to reality than we think: for example, Izzy the computer whiz discovers that he's actually adopted, and that his foster parents have kept it secret for so long. In fact, every one of these kids has their issues (Tai's overprotection over his younger sister Kari, Matt and T.K.'s parents divorced, Joe being forced to become a doctor due to tradition. These issues become a part of some of the conflicts between these characters, and therefore there's a lot of tension in the second half of the first and second seasons when the tone of the show starts to become much darker. These sorts of character developments are what I found so refreshing about this animated kid show: it features troubled characters, differing morals, and hard-hitting realism. This sort of thing is now unfortunately rare these days (watch Total Drama Island, and you'll see what I mean), but thankfully Digimon: Digital Monster is a constant reminder that you CAN do wonders with both character development & plot development.Unfortunately, Digimon: Digital Monsters is not perfect: it has some obvious flaws that one can detect if they only use their eyes and ears. First, the animation in this show is simply awful. In some scenes, you have backgrounds that look only partially complete. In other scenes, freeze-frame is used when an object or a character is moving from one direction to another. Maybe it's because the budget for this show was limited, but whatever the reason, ""unsatisfactory"" is the perfect word I would choose for the animation. Second, the music isn't really anything that's special. You have the infamous theme that's played during the intro, and it's bad. I mean, really, REALLY bad. It's a dreadful aggravation to the ears. The male voices for the lyrics are really agonizing to listen to, and the orchestral music in the entire series (synthesized, obviously) is incredibly mediocre. The rock songs (""Runaround"" & ""Here we Go"") are pretty decent for kids, though. Finally, the screenplays for the show aren't entirely unbearable, but they can be laughable at times (even for a kids show). One-liners and puns become constant, and it can be a bit of a pain as the show progresses. Some of them are indeed funny, but most are overdone.By the way, do these monsters always have to have ""mon"" at the end of their names? It seems unnecessary.....In the end, however, I still have a soft spot for this show. Even though the animation and the music do not hold up very well, the plot and the characters are what make this show. Rarely does an animated series that's intended for kids convey real character development & story progression, and this one really delivers both. Unfortunately, the show fails with continuity, as the third and fourth seasons were so drastically different that most of the fans stopped caring. This would lead to the show's cancellation, as well as a reboot that started just a few years ago. I've never seen the newer seasons since the cancellation, but if it's good enough, it'll restore hope in the entire franchise. And hopefully, the official DVD release of the first and second seasons of Digimon: Digital Monsters will be released sometime in the near future.In short, Digimon: Digital Monsters fails with its poor animation, irritating music, and (sometimes) unintentionally laughable dialogue, but succeeds with its solid plot and intriguing characters.Grade: C",3,Going digital.....in both the right and

Now you mu...","[2, 29]","Because my earlier review of Season One of Digimon was so widely misunderstood, I've decided to edit this review. First off, this ""Season One"" collection of Digimon episodes is not the entire season. It is a single DVD that contains the first bunch of episodes of the season (the Devimon episodes). It also features a few of the Myotismon episodes. While the episodes with Myotismon weren't bad, I HATE the Devimon episodes. Devimon was a boring villain, and those episodes seemed to be aimed at very young children. If you ever saw the incredibly annoying episode called ""Digibaby boom"", you'll know what I'm talking about. When I saw stupid episodes like that, I felt more like I was watching an episode of the Teletubbies than an ""action/adventure"" cartoon. Since this set of Digimon episodes contains episodes that for the most part annoyed the hell out of me, I give this DVD one star.Now that I've criticized the DVD, I will devote the rest of this review to discussing the entire first season of Digimon. I liked a lot of episodes from the first season, BUT THOSE EPISODES ARE NOT INCLUDED ON THIS DVD. If the episodes I actually liked were included, I'd give this DVD a higher rating. Season one would always have a major enemy (or group of enemies) for the Digidestined to defeat. The episodes with Etemon were alright, the episodes with Myotismon were good (with a few exceptions), and the episodes with the Dark Masters were AWESOME. But as I've already said, the episodes I enjoyed aren't on this DVD.As many like to point out, Digimon was made BEFORE Pokemon. Pokemon is a `cute' show that little kids can enjoy, but Digimon is an odd combination of `cute' mixed with `ugly/brutish'. The cute aspects were the rookie digimon, and the digi-destined themselves, who were children. The ugly and brutish aspects were the mega digimon, the evil digimon (like Myotismon and Devimon) and some surprisingly graphic violence, which is aimed at older children. In my case, I LOVED the `ugly/brutish' aspects of the show and HATED the `cute' aspects of the show. That's right - I can't stand the Digidestined, and I was always rooting for the bad guys to win. This DVD contains episodes that largely fall in the `cute' category. Keep in mind, that Digimon was a rather mature show made in Japan that was aimed at teenagers. The geniuses at FOX KIDS dumbed the show down for its American audience, and decided to aim the show at young children. Something I disliked about this is that a lot of young children are exposed to some rather graphic violence (especially in the Digimon movie), but then again, kids today are exposed to graphic violence on a daily basis, so I shouldn't complain. And what follows is the rest of my unedited review, where I discussed what I liked/disliked about Season One of Digimon:Not a single thing in this show is funny - every joke falls flat. But I did like a lot of the Dark Masters' lines, and a lot of Piedmon and Puppetmon's lines made me laugh with glee. The music in this show is HORRIBLE - some of it sounds like Fred Penner playing an electric guitar. And they play that godawful theme song about a million times in every episode. But they had some dramatic music that sounded really cool playing when Piedmon walks up the stairs of his castle and busts down the doors right before having a fight with Angemon. I especially like the way Piedmon will hold two swords by their hilts in each of his hands, then yell ""TRUMP SWORDS!"" and throw them like darts at his opponent. The sight of someone being impaled by one of his swords is most impressive.I liked how all the Dark Masters team up to wipe out the Digi-Destined in one knock out blow. But the Digi-Destined escape (unfortunately), and the Dark Masters figure they're so easy to destroy that it would be more fun for each Dark Master to single-handedly take on the Digi-Destined at a time. Unsurprisingly, the Dark Masters pay dearly for their arrogance. I felt especially bad for Piedmon, who went through the terrifying Gate of Destiny.I like how the Dark Masters are representative of absolute evil - there's no shades of gray here. Their ultimate plan is to eliminate or enslave EVERYONE. I love that plan. None of them have a conscience, or have any delusions that what they are doing isn't evil. Indeed, they derive sadistic pleasure by committing heinous acts - if they were in the real world, such actions would amount to crimes against humanity. The Biblical concepts of `absolute good' and `absolute evil' don't exist in real-life, but it's sometimes refreshing to watch a TV show where they do exist, even if it's a simplified reality. Whether they're screaming ""RIVER OF POWER!"", razing entire cities to the ground, or threatening to destroy the Digi-Destined, I found them so entertaining that a few years ago I taped all the episodes featuring the Dark Masters.The best quote of the show is when Machinedramon busts through a wall and says in his supercool voice ""Oh good. Just what I was looking for. VICTIMS."" Then Machinedramon proceeds to massacre everyone in his path. Another great moment was when Metaletemon was doing a rock song about destroying the Digi-Destined, then an annoyed and infuriated Puppetmon screams ""ENOUGH!"" before the two have a hilarious brawl and spit a lot of insults at each other.I took a glance at some of the other negative customer reviews, and some good points are raised. This DVD set is not the whole season, and some nut only seems to have chosen the absolute worst episodes for inclusion of this set. THE EPISODES WITH THE DARK MASTERS AREN'T INCLUDED! Oh well... Machinedramon ought to use Plan ELIMIN EIGHT on this DVD set - notice their use of wordplay?",1,"The Plot Sickens, as Piedmon Would Say",1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,5706,"['earlier', 'review',

564286,A3PPGICQV3698N,B00005221P,"""smsmercury""","[8, 9]","I think Pokemon is a great show, but I like Digimon better. I like it better because it's funnier. The jokes maybe cheesy and corny at times, but they do a good job of pulling it off. Pokemon has its laughs, but their jokes aren't the ones that are the laugh-out-loud kind. Although, I think the commercials for Pokemon are a lot better and I really like playing the Pokemon video games.Pokemon is basically the journey of a boy and his Pikachu. Digimon is he story of how a group of kids with different strengths and weaknesses become friends with the help of their monsters. They learn more about themselves and become better people. Their relationship with their parents also improves too.I like the characters better. Instead of just Ash, Misty, and Brock all the time helping new-people-that-you- are-probably-only-going-to-meet-once on every episode fighting the same trio of villains (Jessie, James, and Meowth), there are many children all with different personalities. Some are smart, strong, funny, responsible, caring, and sometimes snobbish with all sorts of combinations to form their character. You can also see that the Digimon reflect their partner's personalities. It also has more of a plot. While saving the digital world, they are finding themselves and you can see them maturing and learning. In Pokemon, Ash and Misty are on a quest to become a great Pokemon something-or-other. They do mature, but the series seems to drag on a bit.Unlike Pokemon, the &quot;Digidestined&quot; do not go out and try to beat up monsters to catch them. Instead the monster and the child were meant for each other. Plus they can talk. They don't have to say their name a million times to communicate. The Digimon consider themselves to be friends more than pets. The monsters can also &quot;Digivolve&quot; into many different forms depending, and go back to a previous form. In Pokemon, once they evolve, they can't go back. Pokemon can die, but Digimon never really die, they just get reconfigured.I think Pokemon is great for little kids, but I think Digimon is a step higher than that. They are both great shows to watch, but Digimon allows you to compare yourself and match your personality up with one of several kids. A lot of the kids I know like it better because it allows them to pick out and pretend who they want to be.",5,Digimon- Digital Monsters vs. Pokemon- Pocket Monsters,987811200,"04 21, 2001",2001,2335,"['think', 'Pokemon', 'great', 'show', 'like', 'Digimon', 'better', 'like', 'better', 'funnier', 'jokes', 'maybe', 'cheesy', 'corny', 'times', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'Pokemon', 'laughs', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'ones', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'kind', 'think', 'commercials', 'Pokemon', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'really', 'playing', 'Pokemon', 'video', 'games.Pokemon', 'basically', 'journey', 'boy', 'Pikachu', 'Digimon', 'story', 'how', 'group', 'kids', 'different', 'strengths', 'become', 'friends', 'help', 'monsters', 'learn', 'more', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'relationship', 'parents', 'also', 'too.I', 'characters', 'better', 'Instead', 'just', 'Ash', 'Misty', 'Brock', 'time', 'helping', 'new-people-that-you-', 'are-probably-only-going-to-meet-once', 'episode', 'fighting', 'same', 'trio', 'villains', 'Jessie', 'James', 'Meowth', 'are', 'many', 'children', 'different', 'personalities', 'are', 'smart', 'strong', 'funny', 'responsible', 'caring', 'sometimes', 'snobbish', 'sorts', 'combinations', 'form', 'character', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'Digimon', 'reflect', 'partner', 'personalities', 'also', 'more', 'plot', 'saving', 'digital', 'world', 'are', 'finding', 'can', 'see', 'maturing', 'learning', 'Pokemon', 'Ash', 'Misty', 'are', 'quest', 'become', 'great', 'Pokemon', 'something-or-other', 'do', 'mature', 'series', 'drag', 'bit.Unlike', 'Pokemon', 'quot', 'Digidestined', 'quot', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'try', 'beat', 'up', 'monsters', 'catch', 'Instead', 'monster', 'child', 'were', 'meant', 'other', 'can', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'name', 'million', 'times', 'communicate', 'Digimon', 'consider', 'be', 'friends', 'more', 'pets', 'monsters', 'can', 'also', 'quot', 'Digivolve', 'quot', 'many', 'different', 'forms', 'depending', 'go', 'back', 'previous', 'form', 'Pokemon', 'once', 'evolve', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'Pokemon', 'can', 'die', 'Digimon', 'never', 'really', 'die', 'just', 'get', 'reconfigured.I', 'think', 'Pokemon', 'great', 'little', 'kids', 'think', 'Digimon', 'step', 'higher', 'are', 'great', 'shows', 'watch', 'Digimon', 'compare', 'match', 'personality', 'up', 'one', 'several', 'kids', 'lot', 'kids', 'know', 'better', 'pick', 'out', 'pretend', 'who', 'want', 'be']",Digimon - Season 1
