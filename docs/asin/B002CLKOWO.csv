I didn't quite know what to expect from the movie as most of the reviews seemed to be evenly spread on Amazon and has a just above average rating on IMDb. But it sounded like a movie I'd enjoy so I decided to check it out. I was somewhat surprised actually. It's not a particularly great movie but a good movie nonetheless.The movie follows newlywed couple Silas and Camille. Silas is a petty thief on parole who has recently married his parole officer's niece. This is more a marriage of convenience for Silas as he's truly only wanting to get to Canada. Camille however actually does love Silas though she somewhat starts to think early on he might not return the feeling.On their way to Niagara Falls, the two are involved in a motorcycle crash in which it's discovered later that Camille really did die in the crash. Feeling guilty over what happened, Silas starts being kinder to Camille and the two slowly and truly begin enjoying their honeymoon trip all the while back home, a local sheriff believes Silas has murdered Camille and they go after the two.The movie actually is a fairly sweet romantic comedy. Good news for guys is that it seems to be pretty evenly directed at both genders and not obviously directed at just women like some romantic comedies.  The ending was definitely pretty touching. As far as te actors, I really enjoyed David Carridine as Cowboy Bob the most though all the actors did pretty well. All in all, it's not a movie that will bring a tear to your eye, but is a fun watch.It might not be a movie you'll go crazy over, but I'd say give it a shot with seeing it.",4,A Nice Movie,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,1681,"['submitting', 'review', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Camille', 'first', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'most', 'reviews', 'seemed', 'be', 'evenly', 'spread', 'Amazon', 'just', 'above', 'average', 'rating', 'IMDb', 'sounded', 'movie', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'so', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'actually', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'nonetheless.The', 'movie', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'Silas', 'Camille', 'Silas', 'petty', 'thief', 'parole', 'who', 'recently', 'married', 'parole', 'officer', 'niece', 'more', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'Silas', 'truly', 'only', 'wanting', 'get', 'Canada', 'Camille', 'however', 'actually', 'love', 'Silas', 'somewhat', 'think', 'early', 'might', 'not', 'return', 'feeling.On', 'way', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'two', 'are', 'involved', 'motorcycle', 'crash', 'discovered', 'later', 'Camille', 'really', 'did', 'die', 'crash', 'Feeling', 'guilty', 'what', 'happened', 'Silas', 'being', 'kinder', 'Camille', 'two', 'slowly', 'truly', 'begin', 'enjoying', 'honeymoon', 'trip', 'while', 'back', 'home', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Silas', 'murdered', 'Camille', 'go', 'two.The', 'movie', 'actually', 'fairly', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Good', 'news', 'guys', 'be', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'directed', 'genders', 'not', 'obviously', 'directed', 'just', 'women', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'ending', 'was', 'definitely', 'pretty', 'touching', 'As', 'far', 'te', 'actors', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'David', 'Carridine', 'Cowboy', 'Bob', 'most', 'actors', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'fun', 'watch.It', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'go', 'crazy', ""'d"", 'say', 'give', 'shot', 'seeing']",N/A
1262689,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B002CLKOWO,Enjolras,"[9, 12]","This movie wasn't what I was expecting, in both good and bad ways. With James Franco, Sienna Miller, and David Carradine, this isn't an all-star cast, but it's also a pretty decent one. The film has at times a corny mid-Western, genuine Americana flavor (cowboy showmen, small-town sheriffs, etc.), which makes its low-budget appearance tolerable. You can't take the film too seriously, which means you can actually enjoy it for what it's worth.I thought the plot was emotional and actually made me stop to think how much I should appreciate those I love. Near the beginning of the film, Franco and Miller's characters get married, but the marriage seems destined to be an unhappy one. However, soon afterward, they get into an accident and Miller (Camille) dies. Well, kind of. Her ghost lingers on because she was not prepared to die. The rest of the film is about the couple finally learning to appreciate each other and find the happiness that had eluded them for so long. In a real sense, the ""ghost"" plot device is a metaphor for something like a terminal disease in real life, when we know a loved one will die soon. Camille touchingly shows us to live that small window of life to the fullest.Now, the bad. Like many other films involving supernatural plot twists and ghosts (I'm thinkingThe Sixth Sense), Camille sometimes lacks internal consistency. For example, soon after the dead Camille breaks a finger merely from pulling her hand away from her husband's, she manages to slap him in the face. This certainly doesn't help sell an already implausible concept - namely that Camille is dead, but can interact with everybody normally. If you can forgive such problems and make the intellectual leap into believing the story for the sake of watching the movie, it's not too bad.",3,A weak film with potential,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,1787,"['movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'good', 'bad', 'ways', 'James', 'Franco', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'David', 'Carradine', ""n't"", 'all-star', 'cast', 'also', 'pretty', 'decent', 'one', 'film', 'times', 'corny', 'mid-Western', 'genuine', 'Americana', 'flavor', 'cowboy', 'showmen', 'small-town', 'sheriffs', 'etc', 'low-budget', 'appearance', 'tolerable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'film', 'too', 'seriously', 'can', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'what', 'worth.I', 'thought', 'plot', 'was', 'emotional', 'actually', 'made', 'stop', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'should', 'appreciate', 'love', 'beginning', 'film', 'Franco', 'Miller', 'characters', 'get', 'married', 'marriage', 'destined', 'be', 'unhappy', 'one', 'However', 'soon', 'afterward', 'get', 'accident', 'Miller', 'Camille', 'Well', 'kind', 'ghost', 'lingers', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'die', 'rest', 'film', 'couple', 'finally', 'learning', 'appreciate', 'other', 'find', 'happiness', 'had', 'eluded', 'so', 'long', 'real', 'sense', 'ghost', 'plot', 'device', 'metaphor', 'something', 'terminal', 'disease', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'know', 'loved', 'one', 'will', 'die', 'soon', 'Camille', 'touchingly', 'live', 'small', 'window', 'life', 'fullest.Now', 'bad', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'involving', 'supernatural', 'plot', 'twists', 'ghosts', ""'m"", 'thinkingThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Camille', 'sometimes', 'internal', 'consistency', 'example', 'soon', 'dead', 'Camille', 'finger', 'merely', 'pulling', 'hand', 'away', 'husband', 'slap', 'face', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'help', 'sell', 'already', 'implausible', 'concept', 'namely', 'Camille', 'dead', 'can', 'interact', 'everybody', 'normally', 'can', 'forgive', 'such', 'problems', 'make', 'intellectual', 'leap', 'believing', 'story', 'sake', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'bad']",N/A

Not much different than Snow White, or Cinderella.  But because it is played out by real people, not cartoon characters, it's hard for some people to realize that it's just a romantic story.You can't call it a ""horror comedy"", as there isn't any horror in it.  You can't really call it a ""romantic comedy"", as there isn't much comedy about it. There's no violence to make it an ""action"" film.  There's no gore and barely any sight of blood that would make it a ""horror"" film.  There's scarcely enough bad language to even warrant it's PG-13 rating.What there is is a deeply penetrating love story that asks a simple question: If you were truly in the worse way you could possibly be, would you want someone to have pity, and compassion, and help you?  And if you knew that person, how much would you be willing to sacrifice to help them?  Does love end at death?  Or is it more powerful than that, defeating it, and enduring to the end?When you realize that the story line is almost a remaking of the classic Cinderella story, then you can start to see it for what it is.  She feels worthless and undeserving of love.  He sees through the outward appearances to see a girl who is afraid and confused, and depending upon him to support and strengthen her.  And he rises to the occasion, and sees her through to the end, himself making the ultimate sacrifice for her.Love is stronger than death, and is born out of mercy and compassion for others.That is the story line.  But if all you can see is ""Eeew!  She's dead"", then I'm afraid you will miss all that.  Keep in mind that you, too, are dead.  Is there someone willing to reach even into your grave to help you in your time of need?  Giving up their own life in the process?  As Shakespeare said, ""Aye! There's the rub!""",5,A powerful story of love that sees through outward appearance.,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1874,"[""'m"", 'very', 'suprised', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'fairy', 'tale', 'romance', 'Not', 'much', 'different', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'played', 'out', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'hard', 'people', 'realize', 'just', 'romantic', 'story.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'horror', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'horror', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'much', 'comedy', 'violence', 'make', 'action', 'film', 'gore', 'barely', 'sight', 'blood', 'would', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'scarcely', 'enough', 'bad', 'language', 'even', 'warrant', 'PG-13', 'rating.What', 'deeply', 'penetrating', 'love', 'story', 'simple', 'question', 'were', 'truly', 'worse', 'way', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'would', 'want', 'someone', 'have', 'pity', 'compassion', 'help', 'knew', 'person', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'help', 'love', 'end', 'death', 'more', 'powerful', 'defeating', 'enduring', 'end', 'When', 'realize', 'story', 'line', 'almost', 'remaking', 'classic', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'then', 'can', 'start', 'see', 'what', 'worthless', 'undeserving', 'love', 'outward', 'see', 'girl', 'who', 'afraid', 'confused', 'depending', 'support', 'strengthen', 'occasion', 'end', 'making', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'her.Love', 'stronger', 'death', 'born', 'mercy', 'compassion', 'others.That', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'see', 'Eeew', 'dead', 'then', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'will', 'miss', 'Keep', 'mind', 'too', 'are', 'dead', 'there', 'someone', 'willing', 'reach', 'even', 'grave', 'help', 'time', 'need', 'Giving', 'up', 'own', 'life', 'process', 'Shakespeare', 'said', 'Aye', 'rub']",N/A

He is on parole. He is basically a good guy who likes to steal stuff. He has known Camille (Sienna Miller) since childhood. She is an overly outgoing talker, which drives Silas crazy. Once married they head off to Niagara Falls. Along the way they meet David Carradine, a horse philosopher. He is not the guy you normally want to meet in a movie wearing a wedding dress.Through a mishap (PLOT SPOILER) Camille dies along the way...no wait she's not dead, but comes back to life so she can complete her trip to Niagara Falls with the only man she has ever loved, even if he doesn't return it. Needless to say her being part of the living dead poses some hygiene problems, although the humor didn't work well.Outside of the death issue, the film isn't that quirky. While funny at times, it is not an over whelming comedy. The romantic aspect comes through, but when you play drippy violin music, you can make any scene of a couple coming together feel like something wonderful. The film was shot from the Canadian side of the falls because it is more scenic, but in the production they pretend it is the US.No f-bombs or sex.
