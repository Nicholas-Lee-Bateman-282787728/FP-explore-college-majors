Some of our puritanical American viewers might get stuck on the sexual content and reject this film (probably out of a sense of their own sexual inadequacies).

This film celebrates the uniqueness of the individual human spirit.  This film screams about acceptance and appreciation of oneself -- and to acknowledge and honor the normal and quirky traits we all possess.  This movie is truly a great film.  It will undoubtedly go down as an important cult classic -- I would argue on the same par as cult classics ""The Graduate"" and ""Harold and Maude.""

This one is a fine materialization about weird, yet lovely people.James Spader taking the role of a yellow man, with all the cynical characters that you might find in a lawyer, as if he was born to play such role, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, the sweet beautiful young actress, is amazing in the role of an accidental secretary.Both personalities have strange alienations, maneuvering the sexual (or sensual) relation between them, and developing it based on the courage and tenacious of revealing, though discretely, the freaky approach to interactive with the other became a masterpiece.The movie starts with an invitation by Edward (the lawyer) to Lee (the secretary) to the world of submission that found a receptive answer; the sequences of the movie show the development of an S/M relation in a smart funny way, never boring or exaggerating. The scenes are not explicit to the extent of being offensive to normal viewer, because the movie concentrates on the buildup of the relation so you amazingly find yourself watching the hot succession of a love story. Moreover, pushing things to the limits is something usual in such relations, and it has been presented in a very logic way in the film. The determined sacrifices of the sub (Lee) as the last showdown, replied to by the complicated hesitation of the top (Edward) push the revelation to the ultimatum: we love each other this way.I really loved this movie, found it very spicy and colorful. With the new wave in cinema, were cost, graphic and technology rating the film and attracting the fans, it is so hard to provide such intentionally (definitely not compulsory) low budget, well made and extremely rich film.One minor non-avoidable defect: the joy of watching it for the first time is not repeatable, so if you want to own it, it would be simply for it existence among the collection to remind you about a warm sweet experience.",4,Wish she were my secretary!,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,1989,"['American', 'movies', 'personalities', 'are', 'relatively', 'rare', 'focus', 'rather', 'subject', 'one', 'fine', 'materialization', 'weird', 'yet', 'lovely', 'people.James', 'Spader', 'taking', 'role', 'yellow', 'man', 'cynical', 'characters', 'might', 'find', 'lawyer', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'such', 'role', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'young', 'actress', 'amazing', 'role', 'accidental', 'secretary.Both', 'personalities', 'have', 'strange', 'alienations', 'maneuvering', 'sexual', 'sensual', 'relation', 'developing', 'based', 'courage', 'tenacious', 'revealing', 'discretely', 'freaky', 'approach', 'interactive', 'other', 'became', 'masterpiece.The', 'movie', 'invitation', 'Edward', 'lawyer', 'Lee', 'secretary', 'world', 'submission', 'found', 'receptive', 'answer', 'sequences', 'movie', 'show', 'development', 'S/M', 'relation', 'smart', 'funny', 'way', 'never', 'boring', 'exaggerating', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'explicit', 'extent', 'being', 'offensive', 'normal', 'viewer', 'movie', 'buildup', 'relation', 'amazingly', 'find', 'watching', 'hot', 'succession', 'love', 'story', 'Moreover', 'pushing', 'things', 'limits', 'something', 'usual', 'such', 'relations', 'been', 'presented', 'very', 'logic', 'way', 'film', 'determined', 'sacrifices', 'sub', 'Lee', 'last', 'showdown', 'replied', 'complicated', 'hesitation', 'top', 'Edward', 'revelation', 'ultimatum', 'love', 'other', 'way.I', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'found', 'very', 'spicy', 'colorful', 'new', 'wave', 'cinema', 'were', 'cost', 'graphic', 'technology', 'rating', 'film', 'attracting', 'fans', 'so', 'hard', 'provide', 'such', 'intentionally', 'definitely', 'not', 'compulsory', 'low', 'budget', 'well', 'made', 'extremely', 'rich', 'film.One', 'minor', 'non-avoidable', 'defect', 'joy', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'not', 'repeatable', 'so', 'want', 'own', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'existence', 'collection', 'remind', 'warm', 'sweet', 'experience']",N/A

First and foremost is Maggie Gyllenhaal. When we meet her she is so pretty, so endearing, and so thoroughly vulnerable that we immediately want to protect her. The next is James Spader. Normally seeing his name associated with a movie makes me want to stick hot needles into my eyes. Spader is often found in awful movies and frequently observed being awful in good ones. He exudes a predatory smarm, as though half his soul went missing. But here he is cast against type. Though playing the part of S in this S&M; tango, he's victimized by an obsessive need to control and is far from mastering it.The demure and adorable Ms. Gyllenhaal, by contrast, intentionally populates his letters with typos to incur welcome wrath and discipline, there is strength and power in her weakness. The third is director Steven Shainberg's even-handed way of presenting the affair. Had he gone for smutty leering, or worse, broad belly laughs, the film would quickly have degenerated and become dumb and unpleasant. Instead he delivers a real, erotic yarn about two people getting what they want and need, with no one being hurt. Restraint was carefully employed and the result is a sweet, if unusual love story.

738667,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00008DDSA,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Maggie Gyllenhaal exploded onto the scene in the early aughts, and it was her devilishly stunning turn in the kinky office drama `Secretary' that got her the bulk of her acclaim and spearheaded her to the front of the pack as far as talented young stars were concerned.  I'm still completely floored by the way she crafts such a complex character and still manages to make her feel so simple.The film is adapted from the short story by Mary Gaitskill.  It tells the story of a young woman named Lee who is from a very defunct family and certainly suffers because of it.  On the outset of the film she is being released from institutional therapy and takes a job as a secretary for a lawyer named Mr. Grey.  Almost immediately, their relationship turns toward S&M.;  Both parties are obviously compliant with the idea and looking for the opportunity, and so when it presents itself they take full advantage.  The relationship seems to have nowhere to go but downhill, but `Secretary' takes a surprising turn in direction as it defies logic and creates a home for these emotionally crippled individuals.Spader is wonderful, truly embracing his dominant quality (and the comparisons to `sex, lies and videotape' are warranted) but it is Gyllenhaal who completely owns this film.  The way she filters through all the stages of her character's growth is flawless, and the way she communicates such yearning with her eyes (and the way she `takes it') is just marvelously rendered with great finesse.  She conveys emotions that hit hard and help to add depth to the subject at hand.  That is another thing that is so commendable about `Secretary' is that it never appears to prod or poke fun or dismiss this `situation' as a mere gag or gimmick, but it is always presented in a realistic and accessible way.  This film is far from judgmental, and while the ending can and probably should be seen as a fantastical representation of a day-dream, it is constructed in a way that feels authentic and `appropriate'.I'll echo the sentiments regarding the non-existent backstory for Mr. Grey.

She's very shy, but James Spader's character is attracted to that, against his will, and hires her.  What follows is the story of their attraction to each other and the needs that each one fulfills in the other.  The S&amp;M element is not overblown and is not shown in a nasty, explicit way.  Rather, you see it as just one of the things that gives them an understanding.This is a funny, though still quite dark, love story and by the end of it, you empathize and enjoy the characters, even though they are far from perfect.

After 45 minutes or so, you think you're watching some French psychosexual drama. Then the end of the movie comes, and you find out you've been watching a really good chick flick! Underneath the spicy perversion is a straight-up made-for-each-other love story, and a really good one.The heart of this movie is a truly incredible performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose shy, crooked smiles come off like a deeply repressed Meg Ryan. She is absolutely stunning in this role. The script and directing are merely okay, but she carves a perfect shining jewel of a performance out of a solid rock of material. Her mere presence in any future films will make me take notice! If she starts getting heavier roles, she could turn into another Meryl Streep - her performance reminded me in many ways of Sophie's Choice, despite the much milder source material.James Spader performs his typecast repressed pervert role (Sex Lies and Videotape, Crash) with his normal mumbling flair. It's not that he's a bad actor, it's just that Maggie Gyllenhaal is so much better. He does his part to move the film along and provide the appropriate friction for her to form a character against. Jeremy Davies and Lesley Ann Warren do well as representatives of the life Lee needs to escape.Anyway... if you want a good, dopey love story and aren't afraid of a LOT of kink, and want to see an up-and-coming actress before she starts getting Oscars (she absolutely deserved an Oscar nomination for this role), watch it.

I recall leaving the theater feeling empowered despite knowing that the next day I would have to fetch whatever my boss wanted, when he wanted it. There are bosses, not just the lawyers, who long for the old-fashioned secretary.Bravo to the filmmaker for rendering Secretary's unflinching revelations about emotional pain as unsettling as its erotic depictions of the catharsis of that pain. I found, and still find, the film to be a surreal and vicarious pleasure. Not that what ensues between the boss and assistant in Secretary is unrealistic. Perhaps you know of a solo proprietor whose temp secretaries kept quitting but who now has a full-time assistant. Why is that assistant a perfect match?Intellectually, I admire the filmmaker's courage in commenting poetically upon the ways in which American society conditions women to be passive and to devalue themselves. Leave it to an art/indie film to expose how some (or many?) American women find themselves either stuck in a time warp of adolescent vanity or suffering through existential paralysis. Because American women are taught to identify and value themselves through their relationships with men, it is a total thrill in Secretary to watch the script flip the stereotype of the skirt-chasing boss on its head.In terms of casting, I cannot imagine anyone but Maggie Gyllenhaal in the title role. Her secretary is like the repressed alter ego of Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie the Cat on that hot tin roof -- full of angst but no less smoldering. Maggie G. appears to purr rather than speak. James Spader, who once upon a time seemed typecast as a snooty yuppie, gets the chance in Secretary to fully realize his erotic potential. While his character can be viewed as tongue-in-cheek, he delivers a genuinely quirky and sensitive performance.When you get down to it, the various vicarious experiences in Secretary will please some and repulse others.

The world is a cold and lonely place for human beings because we all need affection and companionship.  But for many reasons, it is terribly difficult to find and connect with soul mates, let alone like minds.I loved the scene when he explains why he thinks she is cutting herself and tells her she doesn't need to do it anymore.  At that moment, if only for a moment, she finally got the understanding and affection she desperately needed and deserved.  And although it didn't occur as suddenly, she definitely came to understand him and what he needed.""Secretary"" delivers the goods for those viewers with mostly prurient interests.  However, I thought the displays of physical intimacy between these two people who come to care for each other, unencumbered by what is generally accepted by society, was gracefully done. No, I don't mean the spanking or humiliation.  I mean, for example, the scenes of tenderness, like the one near the end when he worships every inch of her body (particularly one very special inch).I enjoyed the tension and near anguish portrayed by the actors as they approached terrifying moments requiring all their courage.  Breaking through barriers, taking risks, and experimenting is scary.  I saw these two characters battle through walls of anonymity and loneliness to make a connection with each other.Many narrow lines are walked in this movie.  The most important and dangerous of these lines, of course, was knowing when risky behaviors like these are selfless, tender examples of lovemaking, and when they are selfish, cruel exploitation.  In ""Secretary,"" we are given many clues about it being the former, rather than the latter.  But do we really always know?  Of course not.  Did the characters always know?I would have awarded five stars had the character development for the male lead been anywhere near what it was for her.  And I would have liked more balance between the two of them, in terms of giving and taking.

738682,A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K,B00008DDSA,"brewster22 ""brewster22""","[27, 32]","&quot;Secretary&quot; is a deliciously off-beat dramedy about an emotionally disturbed young girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who gets a job as a you know what for an attorney with his own set of personal problems (James Spader). Soon, she's doing more than typing for him, and he's helping her come out of her reclusive shell.This film on paper sounds almost exactly like &quot;The Piano.&quot; A young woman is given the choice between a conventional relationship and one that superficially might seem perverse, and opts for the perverse one. In both films, what no-one in the heroine's sphere understands is that the man she's involved with is appealing because he's the only one who seems to understand what she needs.&quot;Secretary&quot; is not as sombre as &quot;The Piano,&quot; however, though it's not as rowdy as the premise might lead you to believe.  It's actually a quite substantive film and only occasionally did I think it faltered somewhat in telling its story (particularly toward the end, when Lee embarks upon her hunger strike).  Ironically, in offering herself up for submissive humiliation from her boss, Lee finds the strength she needs to face her own demons and forges a confidence she's never before had.Gyllenhall is spectacular, and gives one of those performances that should put her on the map as a serious actress, if anyone is paying attention.  Spader is pretty good too, but he's upstaged by Gyllenhaal, who owns this movie.Grade: A-",4,"I'd Like That Coffee with a Spanking, Please",1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,1461,"['quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'deliciously', 'off-beat', 'dramedy', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'young', 'girl', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'job', 'know', 'what', 'attorney', 'own', 'set', 'personal', 'problems', 'James', 'Spader', 'Soon', 'doing', 'more', 'typing', 'helping', 'come', 'reclusive', 'shell.This', 'film', 'paper', 'almost', 'exactly', 'quot', 'Piano.', 'quot', 'A', 'young', 'woman', 'given', 'choice', 'conventional', 'relationship', 'one', 'superficially', 'might', 'seem', 'perverse', 'opts', 'perverse', 'one', 'films', 'what', 'no-one', 'heroine', 'sphere', 'understands', 'man', 'involved', 'appealing', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'needs.', 'quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'sombre', 'quot', 'Piano', 'quot', 'however', 'not', 'as', 'rowdy', 'premise', 'might', 'lead', 'believe', 'actually', 'quite', 'substantive', 'film', 'only', 'occasionally', 'did', 'think', 'faltered', 'somewhat', 'telling', 'story', 'particularly', 'end', 'when', 'Lee', 'hunger', 'strike', 'Ironically', 'offering', 'submissive', 'humiliation', 'boss', 'Lee', 'strength', 'face', 'own', 'demons', 'confidence', 'never', 'had.Gyllenhall', 'spectacular', 'one', 'performances', 'should', 'put', 'map', 'serious', 'actress', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'Spader', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'upstaged', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'movie.Grade', 'A-']",N/A
738683,A1V359XAMSXP7Y,B00008DDSA,bryan12603,"[5, 5]","This is a paradigmatic ""cult movie.""  You'll either love it and run out to buy the DVD, or you'll be some combination of baffled and repulsed.The briefest description I can give is that this movie is sort of what a screwball romantic comedy would be like if it were written by the Marquis de Sade.Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a  ""cutter"" (i.e., she inflicts cuts on herself intentionally to deal with the pain and anxiety in her life).  She accidentally cut too deep one time, so her family had her institutionalized.  She has just been released, and is looking for a job, despite having a complete lack of work experience.E. Edward Gray (James Spader) is an attorney.  When Lee shows up to apply for a job at his office, the reception area looks like a battle scene, and the old secretary is leaving in tears.  Gray then asks Lee a series of impertinent questions:  ""Are you pregnant?  Do you plan on being pregnant? Do you live alone?""  She ingenuously answers his questions and is hired that day.Their relationship only gets odder as time goes on.  There is obvious sexual tension between the (virginal, we assume) Lee and the recently divorced Gray.  Step by step, they escalate from intimate boss-employee conversations to out and out BDSM.This bare summary makes the story seem dark and sinister.  But if you have a morbid sensibility, you'll find yourself chuckling at the movie's sly humor, and being touched by the budding romance between Lee and Gray.Spader gives, as usual, a fine performance, but Gyllenhaal is just terrific.  Without her the movie would not work.  She has to seem innocent yet kinky.  She has to believable as a person with serious psychological problems, while having an intoxicating effervescence about her.  She must manifeset subtle and complex expressions in key scenes.  She does it all.One key scene is the first time Gray disciplines Lee.  He humiliates her for a typographical error in a letter she typed, makes her bend over his desk, and then spanks her while forcing her to read the letter out loud.  Gyllenhaal's face and voice capture exquisitely the combination of shock, humiliation and arousal that the scene requires.  When Gray is finished spanking Lee, he leans forward over her, obviously spent from his effort.  His hand is next to hers, and her pinky reaches out to grasp his hand, a subtle indication of the intimacy that they have shared.This intimacy is important, because it becomes clear that the relationship between Gray and Lee is not just about kinky sex.  They are in love, and they need each other.  But will the relationship work out?  Ironically, although Gray is the ""Dom,"" he is the one who needs Lee to guide him by her submission.  But doing so requires that he trust her enough to open up to her.And, yes, it's also a comedy.  Trust me.The movie is based on a fine short story, ""Secretary,"" by Mary Gaitskill, in her collection _Bad Behavior_, which is a great read (although much darker than this movie).",5,"Romance, comedy and BDSM:  What's not to like?",1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,2983,"['paradigmatic', 'cult', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'combination', 'baffled', 'repulsed.The', 'briefest', 'description', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'sort', 'what', 'screwball', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'written', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Sade.Lee', 'Holloway', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'cutter', 'i.e.', 'cuts', 'intentionally', 'deal', 'pain', 'anxiety', 'life', 'accidentally', 'cut', 'too', 'deep', 'one', 'time', 'family', 'had', 'institutionalized', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'looking', 'job', 'having', 'complete', 'lack', 'work', 'experience.E', 'Edward', 'Gray', 'James', 'Spader', 'attorney', 'When', 'Lee', 'up', 'apply', 'job', 'office', 'reception', 'area', 'battle', 'scene', 'old', 'secretary', 'leaving', 'tears', 'Gray', 'then', 'Lee', 'series', 'impertinent', 'questions', 'Are', 'pregnant', 'Do', 'plan', 'being', 'pregnant', 'Do', 'live', 'alone', 'answers', 'questions', 'hired', 'day.Their', 'relationship', 'only', 'odder', 'time', 'obvious', 'sexual', 'tension', 'virginal', 'assume', 'Lee', 'recently', 'divorced', 'Gray', 'Step', 'step', 'escalate', 'intimate', 'boss-employee', 'conversations', 'out', 'BDSM.This', 'bare', 'summary', 'story', 'seem', 'dark', 'sinister', 'have', 'morbid', 'sensibility', ""'ll"", 'find', 'chuckling', 'movie', 'sly', 'humor', 'being', 'touched', 'budding', 'romance', 'Lee', 'Gray.Spader', 'usual', 'fine', 'performance', 'Gyllenhaal', 'just', 'terrific', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'seem', 'innocent', 'yet', 'kinky', 'believable', 'person', 'serious', 'psychological', 'problems', 'having', 'intoxicating', 'effervescence', 'must', 'manifeset', 'subtle', 'complex', 'expressions', 'key', 'scenes', 'all.One', 'key', 'scene', 'first', 'time', 'Gray', 'disciplines', 'Lee', 'typographical', 'error', 'letter', 'typed', 'bend', 'desk', 'then', 'forcing', 'read', 'letter', 'out', 'loud', 'Gyllenhaal', 'face', 'voice', 'capture', 'exquisitely', 'combination', 'shock', 'humiliation', 'arousal', 'scene', 'When', 'Gray', 'finished', 'spanking', 'Lee', 'forward', 'obviously', 'spent', 'effort', 'hand', 'next', 'hers', 'pinky', 'out', 'grasp', 'hand', 'subtle', 'indication', 'intimacy', 'have', 'shared.This', 'intimacy', 'important', 'clear', 'relationship', 'Gray', 'Lee', 'not', 'just', 'kinky', 'sex', 'are', 'love', 'need', 'other', 'will', 'relationship', 'work', 'out', 'Ironically', 'Gray', 'Dom', 'one', 'who', 'Lee', 'guide', 'submission', 'doing', 'so', 'enough', 'open', 'up', 'her.And', 'yes', 'also', 'comedy', 'Trust', 'me.The', 'movie', 'based', 'fine', 'short', 'story', 'Secretary', 'Mary', 'Gaitskill', 'collection', '_Bad', 'Behavior_', 'great', 'read', 'much', 'darker', 'movie']",N/A

738691,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00008DDSA,C. Middleton,"[1, 2]","This is a peculiar black comedy about a subject matter that has been approached in cinema before, but not in such an open and healthy manner. Sadism and masochism are subjects usually left for films about serial killers, sociopaths or the underworld of freaks. In cinema, at least, this topic, and the issues it raises about human sexuality, human suffering and the notion of power and dominance, has been for the most part, taboo, and it is a step in the right direction for the industry to present it in such a fresh, open and humorous way.Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young woman with a few issues about herself and her family. The film opens with her leaving an institution, and her therapist wishing her well in the outside world. We come to see that Lee uses pain as a coping mechanism - burning and cutting herself when life becomes too difficult. She learns some office skills at the community college and lands a job at a one-man law firm. Edward Grey (James Spader) is not what one would say is your `normal' employer. When we first meet him in the interview scene, one gets the immediate impression that this man has a few issues of his own. As the story begins to unfold, however, one can see that these two unique individuals just might have something in common. This becomes all too apparent in the scene where he `punishes' her for making too many typos in her letters. Personally, I didn't know whether to be shocked or laugh during this scene, and ended up quite stunned and laughing at the same time. It would have been extremely difficult to pull off this particular scene without losing its underlying power, as it demands both comedy and depth, but Spader and Gyllenhaal made it real, funny and powerful in every sense.~ Secretary~ is to a large extent a coming of age film. Here is a young, obviously intelligent and sensitive woman, discovering aspects about herself that are not necessarily `normal' to our middle-of-the-road sensibilities. She meets someone who makes her aware about herself, and at the same time, she makes him aware that love can exist and be expressed without feeling guilt. This is a love story though a kind of love story one does not hear about very often. `Secretary~ is a funny, odd and entertaining film.",4,Peculiar black comedy with a fresh approach...,1075593600,"02 1, 2004",2004,2255,"['peculiar', 'black', 'comedy', 'subject', 'matter', 'been', 'approached', 'cinema', 'not', 'such', 'open', 'healthy', 'manner', 'Sadism', 'masochism', 'are', 'subjects', 'usually', 'left', 'films', 'serial', 'killers', 'sociopaths', 'underworld', 'freaks', 'cinema', 'least', 'topic', 'issues', 'human', 'sexuality', 'human', 'suffering', 'notion', 'power', 'dominance', 'been', 'most', 'part', 'taboo', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'industry', 'present', 'fresh', 'open', 'humorous', 'way.Lee', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'young', 'woman', 'few', 'issues', 'herself', 'family', 'film', 'leaving', 'institution', 'therapist', 'wishing', 'well', 'outside', 'world', 'come', 'see', 'Lee', 'pain', 'coping', 'mechanism', 'burning', 'cutting', 'when', 'life', 'too', 'difficult', 'office', 'skills', 'community', 'college', 'job', 'one-man', 'law', 'firm', 'Edward', 'Grey', 'James', 'Spader', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'normal', 'employer', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'interview', 'scene', 'one', 'immediate', 'impression', 'man', 'few', 'issues', 'own', 'story', 'unfold', 'however', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'unique', 'individuals', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'too', 'apparent', 'scene', 'where', 'punishes', 'making', 'too', 'many', 'typos', 'letters', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'shocked', 'scene', 'ended', 'up', 'quite', 'stunned', 'laughing', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', 'particular', 'scene', 'losing', 'underlying', 'power', 'comedy', 'depth', 'Spader', 'Gyllenhaal', 'made', 'real', 'funny', 'powerful', 'sense.~', 'Secretary~', 'large', 'extent', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'Here', 'young', 'obviously', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'woman', 'discovering', 'aspects', 'herself', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'normal', 'middle-of-the-road', 'sensibilities', 'someone', 'who', 'aware', 'herself', 'same', 'time', 'aware', 'love', 'can', 'exist', 'be', 'expressed', 'feeling', 'guilt', 'love', 'story', 'kind', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'not', 'hear', 'very', 'often', 'Secretary~', 'funny', 'odd', 'entertaining', 'film']",N/A

There is only one really unfortunate choice--a video montage with a pop music soundtrack around 1:40:00 takes you out of the world the director has sucked you into.  But that is only one instance.As for the Dom-sub theme, I was prepared to be turned off, but I was not.  Despite the theme, the movie is not sadistic in its treatment of the heroine.  It invites us to be sympathetic with her, and the James Spader character actually helps her stop one unhealthy and damaging clinical expression of psychopathology.  Whether the relationship that eventually develops between Gyllenhaal and Spader should be considered ""healthy"" (or is itself an expression of psychopathology) is something for psychologists and sexologists to debate among themselves, but ""Secretary"" does not invite us to leer at exploitation the way a film like ""Boogie Nights"" does.This is not a film I would watch with my parents or children, or with hard-left feminists.  But I would watch it with friends or possibly a date (not the first).  If you are a film aficionado or if you enjoy off-beat films (like Tim Burton), you really need to see this one, although I think it could be enjoyed by just about anybody who doesn't have a knee-jerk reaction to the theme.",5,forget the D/S theme; excellent movie!,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2174,"['writing', 'review', 'notice', 'recommended', 'tags', 'are', 'things', 'BDSM', 'taboo', 'however', 'view', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'done', 'justice', 'view', 'Mary', 'Gaitskill', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'version', 'short', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'Secretary', 'not', 'salacious', 'Dom-sub', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'qualities', 'recommend', 'something', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedy.From', 'set', 'costume', 'perspective', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Everything', 'chosen', 'film', 'textured', 'highly', 'sensuous', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'well', 'crafted', 'show', 'off', 'props', 'detracting', 'story-telling', 'script', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'adequate', 'dialog', 'good', 'plot', 'development', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'film', 'beforehand', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'up', 'til', 'end', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'unfortunate', 'choice', 'video', 'montage', 'pop', 'music', 'soundtrack', '1:40:00', 'world', 'director', 'sucked', 'only', 'one', 'instance.As', 'Dom-sub', 'theme', 'was', 'prepared', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'was', 'not', 'theme', 'movie', 'not', 'sadistic', 'treatment', 'heroine', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'James', 'Spader', 'character', 'actually', 'stop', 'one', 'unhealthy', 'damaging', 'clinical', 'expression', 'psychopathology', 'relationship', 'eventually', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Spader', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'healthy', 'expression', 'psychopathology', 'something', 'psychologists', 'sexologists', 'debate', 'Secretary', 'not', 'invite', 'leer', 'exploitation', 'way', 'film', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'does.This', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'watch', 'parents', 'children', 'hard-left', 'feminists', 'would', 'watch', 'friends', 'possibly', 'date', 'not', 'first', 'are', 'film', 'aficionado', 'enjoy', 'off-beat', 'films', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'one', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'anybody', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'knee-jerk', 'reaction', 'theme']",N/A

Upon returning home from her stay in the ward she is determined to live her life a new by starting over, getting a job and being normal (although, how can you be normal when you have a mother who waits outside your place of work all day until you get off just so she doesn't have to go home)...So Lee starts working for the anal retentive if somewhat sexist lawyer Edward.  She is his new secretary.  Yet she makes mistakes, and Edward is a bit of a perfectionest.  So it's only natural that Lee will have to make up for those mistakes.  Quite a few spankings later, a few rug burned knees (from crawling people) and a pretty obvious cum stain on the back of her blouse and things are starting to get serious...but it's how serious that will surprise you.  The ending is not anything I expected, mostly because it had a layer of warmth and warmth was not anything I expected from these charactors.  Watch this film, if not for the humor that is found in exploiting sexually debased activitys or the idea that two people repressing so much can let it out by spanking one another, watch it for Maggie's brilliant performance, not to mention Spader pulling off what he does best.

But I guess maybe it's because Hollywood movies try to make that kind of lifestyle seem so silly, or maybe it's cause it hurts to have a whip to your rear, or to get spanked with an open palm. I myself do not enjoy getting spanked but maybe you do! If this is true than Secretary is the kind of movie for you!Maggie Gyllenhaal (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) plays Lee Holloway a young woman who has just left a metal institution on the eve of her sisters wedding. She was in there cause she likes to cut herself and when she gets home you understand why. Her father is a viscous drunk and her parent fight all the time. The father is also quite abusive. Poor Lee has nothing else to do but get a job. So when she finds an ad in the paper for a secretary she jumps at the chance.The job is working for a lawyer named E. Edward Grey (James Spader, Stargate) an interesting cat, whom has a fiery temper and a gentle streak as well. That is until he realizes his attraction to Lee and begins to beat her. Luckily it a sexy beating and she likes it.Secretary was a film I bought right up until near the end. I began to understand the plight of two people with serious problems to deal with. I think the film is sensitive to their plight. But then there is this scene late in the film where a large crowd gathers around the law firm. I couldn't understand why this scene is necessary. I had hoped it was some wild dream in Lee heads, but no.That being said I believe Gyllenhaal does an adequate job with Lee. The performance runs the risk of falling into Mira Sorvino lands (a place where you make up a funny voice and that's called acting quirky (see Mighty Aphrodite)) but it doesn't. She has this sense of wonder in her voice, I loved the little scene in the bathtub where she's practicing how to answer the phone, it is just adorable.Spader's character is good. It's just not drawn well enough. After the film was over I still longed to know what made him tick, I wanted to know what made him hurt, and I wanted to know what causes a successful man to want to dominate women like he did. But the film doesn't like to tell secrets.There is also a subplot I felt was unnecessary. It concerned Lee and a local boy named Peter (Jeremy Davies, Spanking the Movie) and their sweet little relationship or was it? I guess it was meant to mirror her and Grey's, against her parents. But I don't think it was effective as it should have been. I would zone when Peter arrived on the scene. It's too bad cause I normally like Davies' roles.Director Steven Shainberg (Hit Me) has crafted an interesting but not terribly compelling story. I can understand how the indi crowd could come to embrace it. It's full of some really original ideas. But the problem with original ideas is if you introduce a less compelling idea it usually falls flat. SECRETARY is still a good movie just not a great one.I wouldn't force you to become a slave to Secretary, but you'll probably like it anyway.***1/2 (out of 5)",3,"I wouldn't force you to become a slave to Secretary, but you",1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,3088,"['have', 'be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'never', 'engaged', 'deviant', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'guess', 'maybe', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'try', 'make', 'kind', 'lifestyle', 'seem', 'so', 'silly', 'maybe', 'cause', 'have', 'whip', 'rear', 'get', 'spanked', 'open', 'palm', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'spanked', 'maybe', 'do', 'true', 'Secretary', 'kind', 'movie', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'Lee', 'Holloway', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'metal', 'institution', 'eve', 'sisters', 'wedding', 'was', 'cause', 'cut', 'when', 'home', 'understand', 'why', 'father', 'viscous', 'drunk', 'parent', 'fight', 'time', 'father', 'also', 'quite', 'abusive', 'Poor', 'Lee', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'get', 'job', 'So', 'when', 'ad', 'paper', 'secretary', 'chance.The', 'job', 'working', 'lawyer', 'named', 'E.', 'Edward', 'Grey', 'James', 'Spader', 'Stargate', 'interesting', 'cat', 'whom', 'fiery', 'temper', 'gentle', 'streak', 'well', 'attraction', 'Lee', 'beat', 'Luckily', 'sexy', 'beating', 'likes', 'it.Secretary', 'was', 'film', 'bought', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'began', 'understand', 'plight', 'two', 'people', 'serious', 'problems', 'deal', 'think', 'film', 'sensitive', 'plight', 'then', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'where', 'large', 'crowd', 'gathers', 'law', 'firm', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'scene', 'necessary', 'had', 'hoped', 'was', 'wild', 'dream', 'Lee', 'heads', 'being', 'said', 'believe', 'Gyllenhaal', 'adequate', 'job', 'Lee', 'performance', 'risk', 'falling', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'place', 'where', 'make', 'up', 'funny', 'voice', 'called', 'acting', 'quirky', 'see', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', ""n't"", 'sense', 'wonder', 'voice', 'loved', 'little', 'scene', 'bathtub', 'where', 'practicing', 'how', 'answer', 'phone', 'just', 'adorable.Spader', 'character', 'good', 'just', 'not', 'drawn', 'well', 'enough', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'longed', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'tick', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'hurt', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'successful', 'man', 'want', 'dominate', 'women', 'did', 'film', ""n't"", 'like', 'tell', 'secrets.There', 'also', 'subplot', 'felt', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'concerned', 'Lee', 'local', 'boy', 'named', 'Peter', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Spanking', 'Movie', 'sweet', 'little', 'relationship', 'was', 'guess', 'was', 'meant', 'mirror', 'Grey', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'effective', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'zone', 'when', 'Peter', 'arrived', 'scene', 'too', 'bad', 'cause', 'normally', 'Davies', 'roles.Director', 'Steven', 'Shainberg', 'Hit', 'Me', 'crafted', 'interesting', 'not', 'terribly', 'compelling', 'story', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'indi', 'crowd', 'could', 'come', 'embrace', 'full', 'really', 'original', 'ideas', 'problem', 'original', 'ideas', 'introduce', 'less', 'compelling', 'idea', 'usually', 'flat', 'SECRETARY', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'force', 'become', 'slave', 'Secretary', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'anyway', '***1/2', '5']",N/A

And its not just the steamy stuff or the unusual nature of the steamy stuff whick marks this actress in your mind with indelible ink. Gyllenhaal is simply irresistable as the ""secretary"" who is too riddled with anxiety to allow herself to live. Her anxiety gives her a strange awkward  kind of energy which just wins you over in scene after scene. She doesn't realize it but all her life she has been looking for someone to give her permission to live and when James Spader's character does just that she metamorphoses into her true and determined-to-have-her way self. The transformation is a two way street however and as this boss/secretary co-dependence blossoms into full blown love Spader also emerges from his self-imposed exile from his own feeling self. Its not your usual love story but thats just the point--each of us, the film says in its unapologetically and delighfully perverse way,  has to re-invent life to suit our needs. The sets are all painted in the most putrid comic book day-glo colors and yet we grow to accept this abnormality just as we grow to accept the abnormalities of the Gyllenhaal/Spader dynamic. I would argue the best scenes are Gyllenhaal's ""soliloquy's"" in her bedroom and bathroom. In these scenes we penetrate the depths of her very private world, including her fantasy life and it is not a dark world at all. There is  in her utter isolation from the normal channels of existence a rare kind of aloneness, rare because so complete,  but there is also a manic kind of self-celebration in it. This is one story of dysfunction that does not end in a normalizing cure. Quite the opposite, the rest of the world comes to accept Gyllenhaal and Spader on their terms.

A girl fresh out of college takes on a job at an attorney's office where the two work out their latent sado-masochistic tendencies upon each other, and what may actually occur if certain business policies were not enforced. It  speaks to the fact that indulgence does indeed occur in office buildings frequently, for they are caves of the humanimal beast of the field after all, and nature will out no matter the environment.Here, it all starts with a typo - typo turns into `misbehavior', and eventually misbehavior turns into punishment  - a literal spanking ponderously administered which thereby evolves into all manner of colloquial humiliation and command mutually indulged, to the point where she would not even eat if it were not with his permission - and she was perfect - indeed, herself becoming her own little ""Miss Behavior"", at times purposefully mis-spelling a word, just to enjoy her grateful punishment at the hands of her domineering Master. It becomes so much a part of her sexuality, as she derived her E.C.I. with that first spanking, and reaches climax every time.But one day, the pleasures cease as abruptly as they began, to her profound disappointment, and she begs for her sweet punishments again. She attempts all of the usually methods of seduction - from gifts to cards to flowers, to a plunging neckline, but to no avail. Until finally, she realizes that she must do something `naughty' to attract his attention, subsequently a large worm in his mail, to which he draws a thick red line around it to mark her error, as he had been doing prior all along, like the authority figure she craves. This causes a reaction that was most unexpected indeed, as he satisfies himself with just the view of her bent over with her skirt hiked up and pantyhose pulled down. Finally, she is fired because he does not fully comprehend the sub/dom dynamic himself, and  henceforth abruptly fires her, leaving her isolated from the one she loves, despite the amorous attentions she derives from some spineless loser she had been seeing, whom she was about to actually marry, until her desperate passion eventually bade her to return to the office again at the last moment, where she proclaims her love for him. At first he seeks to remove her, but she remains adamant so he finally issues a command, that she remain at the table with her hands flat thereupon where he leaves her for three days during which she is ""counseled"" by friends and even clergy to cease, yet her love-filled determination bids her onwards. He finally releases her from her long-suffering, and carries her to a bathtub where he bathes her and loves her until she becomes his wife.So here we have seen the subconscious covert, transforming to overt expressions made with artistic license to cinematically exemplify the underlying relationship between boss and secretary, sexually subjectified, although such a scenario does carry strains of actuality, and is feasible after all, as relative to the D/s Lifestyle, and is portrayed quite well with the psychological fetish play.The film begins rather innocuously, becoming more and more interesting, building to a crescendo in the middle, drops off in disappointment, then gradually builds up again unto a most pleasing ending.

738704,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B00008DDSA,Dr. E,"[1, 1]","Foremost, Shainburg's film is based on a short-story from Mary Gaitskill's ""Bad Behavior"" collection. Shainberg first made a film-short from this work. Remaining true to the original, the film was dark and concluded with the mental destruction of ""Debby"" (later renamed ""Lee""). Shainberg states that he wanted to create the this new adaptation years ago, but could not find backing for his quirky film. Following a wave of successful feminist-films (Shainberg credits Jane Campion in particular), the director was able to return to this piece. With the guidance of Maggie Gyllenhaal (only twenty-three at the time!), the script was rewritten to empower Lee. Every word was scrutinized ... the team even had Lizzie West re-record the song ""Chariots Rise"" because of a single line that might detract from the overall positive message. So have no reservations about this work ... after a rigorous rewrite, ""Secretary"" is a feminist-film about ""choice."" (Remember, Lee chooses to remain at the desk ... in this moment, she is the ""master"" of Grey's future. She holds his heart in her hands). From Gaitskill's gloomy eight-pages to Shainberg's lush tale, one marvels at this director's talent for adaptation!While many viewers focus on Lee's transformation (logically so since she narrates), this film is as much about Mr. Grey's transformation as it is hers. The wonder of this work resides in beholding two ""sick"" people make each other healthy. Watch how posture straightens, how facial ticks disappear, how voices become bolder, and how both Lee and Grey become more radiant as the film progresses. Compare their initial encounter with the film's final scene to confirm that they nurture each other. (This is also underscored by Shainberg's repeated use of symmetry. Note how the film's framing often creates an almost split-screen effect ... harmony resides here).I feel it necessary to note that this film does not imply that Grey ""cures"" Lee's desire for self-mutilation. Psychologically speaking, Lee simply replaces the pain she experiences from cutting with the ""pain"" of spanking. In this, the film remains realistic and truthful to the disease. And, one is forced to wonder ... would a life with docile Peter push Lee back to her cutting-kit and polyester dresses? What can he offer her as a substitute for her pain?A technical note: if you are screening ""Secretary"" for the first time, (or are a fan already), you will want to watch the prevalence of the color purple. In film, ""purple"" can signify transformation ... but is also the color of childishness (think about how often you see purple adult-clothing ... now think about how often you see purple clothing on children) ... but, one must not forget that purple is also the color of bruises. How do these all tie together? Watch how purple moves from Lee's personal-life to her work-life ... seemingly indicating a transition from silly snowglobes to hidden bruises ... from a giggling woman suffering arrested-development to a poised woman choosing a very adult lifestyle. And watch for ""purple's"" childish resurgence in a hideous grape-shaped ring-box presented in the basement of J.C.Penny's (you will know when you see it!)Shainberg's film can seem slow to the uninitiated. Conservative (read: ""timid"") viewers or those unaccustomed to indie films may not enjoy it. For the rest, it is deliciously tormenting! It is playful, funny, and dark. For me, its charms are uplifting. Since it is designed as a fairy-tale for adults, ""Secretary"" plays on the notion that ""there is someone for everyone."" In a way, it is a chick-flick with a twist (and Shainberg confirms that women tend to gravitate to this film more than men ... but men can certainly enjoy it!)This film is a rare gem for anyone interested in the ""softer-side"" of SMBD, in WAY off-beat romance, or even in feminist film.",5,"""Just One Scoop of Creamed Potatoes, One Slice of Butter, and Four Peas"" ...",1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,3847,"['Foremost', 'Shainburg', 'film', 'based', 'short-story', 'Mary', 'Gaitskill', 'Bad', 'Behavior', 'collection', 'Shainberg', 'first', 'made', 'film-short', 'work', 'Remaining', 'true', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'dark', 'concluded', 'mental', 'destruction', 'Debby', 'later', 'renamed', 'Lee', 'Shainberg', 'wanted', 'create', 'new', 'adaptation', 'years', 'ago', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'backing', 'quirky', 'film', 'Following', 'wave', 'successful', 'feminist-films', 'Shainberg', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'particular', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'return', 'piece', 'guidance', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'only', 'twenty-three', 'time', 'script', 'was', 'rewritten', 'empower', 'Lee', 'Every', 'word', 'was', 'scrutinized', 'team', 'even', 'had', 'Lizzie', 'West', 're-record', 'song', 'Chariots', 'Rise', 'single', 'line', 'might', 'detract', 'overall', 'positive', 'message', 'So', 'have', 'reservations', 'work', 'rigorous', 'rewrite', 'Secretary', 'feminist-film', 'choice', 'Remember', 'Lee', 'remain', 'desk', 'moment', 'master', 'Grey', 'future', 'heart', 'hands', 'Gaitskill', 'gloomy', 'eight-pages', 'Shainberg', 'lush', 'tale', 'one', 'marvels', 'director', 'talent', 'adaptation', 'many', 'viewers', 'focus', 'Lee', 'transformation', 'logically', 'so', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'transformation', 'hers', 'wonder', 'work', 'beholding', 'two', 'sick', 'people', 'make', 'other', 'healthy', 'Watch', 'how', 'posture', 'how', 'facial', 'ticks', 'disappear', 'how', 'voices', 'become', 'bolder', 'how', 'Lee', 'Grey', 'become', 'more', 'radiant', 'film', 'Compare', 'initial', 'encounter', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'confirm', 'nurture', 'other', 'also', 'underscored', 'Shainberg', 'repeated', 'use', 'symmetry', 'Note', 'how', 'film', 'framing', 'often', 'almost', 'split-screen', 'effect', 'harmony', 'resides', 'here', '.I', 'feel', 'necessary', 'note', 'film', 'not', 'imply', 'Grey', 'cures', 'Lee', 'desire', 'self-mutilation', 'Psychologically', 'speaking', 'Lee', 'simply', 'pain', 'cutting', 'pain', 'spanking', 'film', 'realistic', 'truthful', 'disease', 'one', 'forced', 'wonder', 'would', 'life', 'docile', 'Peter', 'push', 'Lee', 'back', 'cutting-kit', 'polyester', 'dresses', 'What', 'can', 'offer', 'substitute', 'pain', 'technical', 'note', 'are', 'screening', 'Secretary', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'fan', 'already', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'prevalence', 'color', 'purple', 'film', 'purple', 'can', 'signify', 'transformation', 'also', 'color', 'childishness', 'think', 'how', 'often', 'see', 'purple', 'adult-clothing', 'now', 'think', 'how', 'often', 'see', 'purple', 'clothing', 'children', 'one', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'purple', 'also', 'color', 'bruises', 'How', 'do', 'tie', 'together', 'Watch', 'how', 'purple', 'moves', 'Lee', 'personal-life', 'work-life', 'seemingly', 'indicating', 'transition', 'silly', 'snowglobes', 'hidden', 'bruises', 'giggling', 'woman', 'suffering', 'arrested-development', 'poised', 'woman', 'choosing', 'very', 'adult', 'lifestyle', 'watch', 'purple', 'childish', 'resurgence', 'hideous', 'grape-shaped', 'ring-box', 'presented', 'basement', 'J.C.Penny', 'will', 'know', 'when', 'see', 'Shainberg', 'film', 'can', 'seem', 'slow', 'uninitiated', 'Conservative', 'read', 'timid', 'viewers', 'unaccustomed', 'indie', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'deliciously', 'tormenting', 'playful', 'funny', 'dark', 'charms', 'are', 'uplifting', 'designed', 'fairy-tale', 'adults', 'Secretary', 'notion', 'someone', 'everyone', 'way', 'chick-flick', 'twist', 'Shainberg', 'women', 'tend', 'gravitate', 'film', 'more', 'men', 'men', 'can', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'rare', 'gem', 'anyone', 'interested', 'softer-side', 'SMBD', 'WAY', 'off-beat', 'romance', 'even', 'feminist', 'film']",N/A

If you can get past the fact that every character in this movie is bizarre and just go with it, you will love it. It's been awhile since a movie has made me this happy.  I've been watching far too many depressing and unoriginal movies that left me feeling like the future of my attending a movie screening bleak.Lee has just been released from an institution, and it's the day of her sister's wedding.  Early on, she is very odd and you wonder what the heck is going on.  She's cutting herself, and her father is an alcoholic.  Life is not very happy for our dear odd bird, Lee.  Then she applies for her first job as secretary to E. Edward Grey.  Her existence takes quite a turn once working for Mr. Grey.Mr. Grey is into S&amp;M, and when Lee starts making typos, he gives the bad girl something to remember him by. She loves every minute.  This is what floats their boat, so to speak...If it makes them happy then so be it.Per his request, she stops cutting.  He also tells her what to do all the time, even what to eat for dinner, and she gladly obliges. She does everything he tells her. Underneath her submissiveness, Lee is embarking on a very weird journey into finding herself and falls in love.It has some great dialogue, too. Now when I answer the phones at work, I smile and laugh to myself, and all I can think of is this movie.It's brilliantly acted by all the actors especially Maggie.  Her performance was the best of all actresses in the year 2002 that I had to the distinct pleasure to witness.  She took on the role and truly made it a spectacle to see.  It was like watching a caterpillar turn into a butterfly.  I thought that she and James Spader had an amazing chemistry together.I say to each is own, some of us appreciate films that push the buttons of others.  This film is worth watching.Also, I am a Secretary myself, and couldn't help but laugh at a lot of the scenes between Lee and Mr. Grey.

Maggie Gyllenhaal.First, Maggie Gyllenhaal's transformation from mental misfit into S&M; master player is the stuff great performances are made of.  While the subject matter might not have won over every viewer, the subtle nuances of her performances, the minor changes in her body language, and the growing fervor in her eyes elevated what could've been a laughable attempt at showing the effects of perverse seduction to the area of pure art.Second, Maggie Gyllenhaal inhabits this character so tightly, so perfectly, so vividly, it's hard to imagine any other person ever being considered for the role.  With an awkward grace, she fumbles uncomfortably through her life until her wayward encounter of being spanked truly awakens that part of herself seeking to be so much more than who she is.Third, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a stunningly beautiful actress who is just wonderful to watch on the silver screen, the ... tube, or anywhere else you can catch it.  As does her character, her looks blossom from innocence to worldliness in the course of two hours in the way few actresses have been able to accomplish in any film.  She's a young Diane Lane in the making.  Look for great things from this talented performer.Overall, the story is a bit forced.  It's relatively convenient (or is it star-crossed?) that the frumpy misfit finds the manipulative and sadistic lawyer (played admirably by James Spader in an ever-admirable 'James Spader' mode), but, in the end, its all academic.

738710,A1TKYAYESYHIA2,B00008DDSA,"Elijah Chingosho ""Dr Elijah Chingosho""","[12, 12]","""Secretary"" is an excellent if eccentric romantic story (so to speak) where the main actors, Lee and Mr Grey, played their delicate roles exceptionally well, particularly for Lee in this her first starring role.Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a nervous, frustrated, aimless, innocent and vulnerable lady who had recently been released from a mental institution. She has a very low self-esteem and an eccentric habit of inflicting pain on herself. After her release from mental institution, she acquires a secretarial qualification and gets a job at the law firm of E. Edward Grey. Mr Grey (James Spade) is an imperious and perfectionist lawyer. He employs Lee, who stirs dark and shameful urges in him. Mr Grey is a sadist who believes in sexual dominance. He subjects Lee to spanking for minor typing errors which, strangely enough she enjoys. There is natural chemistry between these two unusual characters. Ironically, although Mr Grey is supposed to be the dominant character, it is in fact Lee that exercises immense power on her employer. He in fact needs and desires her desperately.Some people may find the film disturbing and shocking with an apparently vulnerable lady at the mercy of a fussy and sadistic boss with kinky sexual desires. The submissive character of Lee may present her as someone deserving of protection.

738713,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B00008DDSA,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[15, 16]","Don't let the subject matter scare you, folks! This is a beautiful movie.Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely adorable and incredibly sexy as Lee Holloway, a young woman who is a cutter - someone who cuts herself to avoid inner pain, to feel she is alive, to take comfort in the pain itself and the healing. She has recently been released from a mental institution for attempted suicide, and is placed into the care of her amazingly dysfunctional family. She begins cutting herself again, until her new boss, E. Edward Grey (James Spader,) slowly brings her into a dominant/submissive relationship. Spader plays Grey perfectly, portraying some of the most genuine inner conflict I have ever seen on-screen. His intensity is unparalleled.That's the short story right there, but until you see this film, you won't realie the intensity (there's that word again) of each character's awkwardness with her- or himself, won't release how necessary their relationship is to each of them, and how they come to feel about each other. The story is surprisingly funny and light-hearted both subtly and overtly in places, utterly charming in others, sad in several, and heart-warming overall. The direction is superb, the colors and sets are absolutely gorgeous and rich in color....everything about this film is stunning. It is not shocking, it is not pornographic, but it is sensual and sexual.Lee's transformation is, of course, the focal point of the film, but there are other layers to appreciate and savor as well. This is an enjoyable ride that allows those unfamiliar with aspects of BDSM to see a tiny glimpse of two peoples' version of it, but it's also more than that. The ""more than that"" is really difficult to describe, I'm sorry. But it's a beautiful, tender love story, and I highly recommend it - I'll definitely watch it again.The DVD's extra features are somewhat lacking, sadly, but the ""Behind the Secretary"" bit is fun. Despite the stereotypically dark subject matter, as the ""behind"" bit states, she is actually travelling a journey from darkness into light - and that's absolutely it. Mr. Grey's office is a sanctuary where orchids grow, and where Lee begins to grow and blossom, too. The long shots down the hallway to his office underline the journey, and are beautiful unto themselves. It's simply a great, great story! Charming! Beautiful! Lovely! Stunning! Almost perfect!

Ridiculous as it was, it kept me glued to the screen right up until the anti-climatic conclusion. Like many good films, the viewer here has a hard time figuring out to what degree the film is proclaiming itself as reality. If a film is surreal then one does not necessarily try to make sense of it (e.g., bring up questions about the messages that the film may be conveying to the viewer, either intentional or independent of what the writer had in mind).To explain the positives of the film, I could echo the other reviewers below who have given the film 4 or 5 stars; I do agree with many of their viewpoints. But I am on the fence about this one. Throughout the entire film I was trying to decide whether the protagonist [Lee] was becoming fulfilled -- or whether her victimization was simply being prolonged (in a cage with golden bars). Ok, I'll admit it: I am not fond of men with status and money who exploit people because they can. Hey, that is exactly what goes on for the duration of the film, regardless of how much Lee smiles or masturbates when she thinks about her s**thead boss.I have taken several classes in psychology (including Abnormal Psychology), and perhaps this is why I do not take the subject of mental illness lightly. On the other hand, I have a low opinion of what mainstream society showcases as a mentally healthy lifestyle. The people who viewed this film in hopes of seeing some hotshot lawyer balling his secretary probably got what they deserved. Even as I despised the main male character in the film (indeed, most of the characters are easy to despise, other than Lee), it challenged me to view him from Lee's perspective.

738728,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B00008DDSA,guillermoj,"[26, 59]","The mostly stellar reviews that this movie received, and my love of independent movies over summer blockbusters made this movie a must see on my list. When I started to watch this movie I immediately felt that it would be of those that would polarize its audience due to the subject matter and execution thereof, but I hoped that I would be on the side of those who liked it.I was shocked only by how bored I was by watching this movie. The movie was marketed as a walk on the wildside of sorts and I kept waiting for it to get going. After watching half of it, I simply could not waste another minute.The only positive thing that this movie accomplished was to allow Maggie Gyllenhaal the room to give a deeply immersed, credibly transitional performance as Lee, a fragile, frumpy, self-mutilating psychiatric patient recently released from a mental hospital. Her performance has to be considered a true breakthrough as she managed to give some humanity and believability to a heavy-handed yet underwritten script.Other actors don't come out nearly as well. James Spader, who plays Lee's boss seems to be phoning in his performance as he is no different here than he is in the television show titled ""The Practice"". Spader's acting works very well in the series as he is part of an ensemble and his character has brought life to a series that was getting stale. Here he just annoys. Also, does the director not know that casting Leslie Ann Warren alsmost guarantees a dud. She unfortunately is an actress who like Spader seems to be playing the same angry victim every time she appears in a movie. This role may say a lot about the opportunities that are out there for mature women, but she does nothing to make it her own.Although the director has a visual flair, the pacing of the movie killed it for me. The multiple scenes involving self-mutilation were treated frivolously and Lee's submission into the sadomasochistic relationship did not ring true to me. Although I like quirky movies, the repeated spankings seemed way out of place and the movie would have benefitted from a more restrained approach. I believe that it could have worked much better if it had taken the time to seduce the audience into seeing how Lee could be attracted by what was about to come. The execution could have benefited by creating a sense of mystery and not being so in your face with what seemed to be very violent spankings for the sake of being provocative.Most will probably disagree with my views about this movie, but I owe my peers the courtesy of putting my two cents to balance the decisions of those who discover movies in this great site. Also, some may say that only seeing half the movie does not allow for a thorough review, but it got to the point when I was too bored and uninterested to watch. This is huge when you consider that I have only walked out of two movies in my whole life.In a nutshell, this movie seems to be asking us to view the lead characters' kinkiness not as some innocuous behavioural difference but as a profoundly liberating statement. The statement is too bold and the movie in no way reaches the heights it intends too. Maybe this would work better as a documentary, but this film is a waste of time and money.",1,Maggie Gyllenhaal's amazing performance can't save the movie,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,3239,"['mostly', 'stellar', 'reviews', 'movie', 'received', 'love', 'independent', 'movies', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'made', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'list', 'When', 'started', 'watch', 'movie', 'immediately', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'polarize', 'audience', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'execution', 'thereof', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'side', 'who', 'liked', 'it.I', 'was', 'shocked', 'only', 'how', 'bored', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'walk', 'wildside', 'sorts', 'kept', 'waiting', 'get', 'going', 'watching', 'half', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'waste', 'minute.The', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'movie', 'accomplished', 'was', 'allow', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'room', 'give', 'deeply', 'immersed', 'credibly', 'transitional', 'performance', 'Lee', 'fragile', 'frumpy', 'self-mutilating', 'psychiatric', 'patient', 'recently', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'performance', 'be', 'considered', 'true', 'breakthrough', 'managed', 'give', 'humanity', 'believability', 'heavy-handed', 'yet', 'underwritten', 'script.Other', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'James', 'Spader', 'who', 'Lee', 'boss', 'be', 'phoning', 'performance', 'different', 'here', 'television', 'show', 'titled', 'Practice', 'Spader', 'acting', 'works', 'very', 'well', 'series', 'part', 'ensemble', 'character', 'brought', 'life', 'series', 'was', 'getting', 'stale', 'Here', 'just', 'Also', 'director', 'not', 'know', 'casting', 'Leslie', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'alsmost', 'dud', 'unfortunately', 'actress', 'who', 'Spader', 'be', 'playing', 'same', 'angry', 'victim', 'time', 'movie', 'role', 'may', 'say', 'lot', 'opportunities', 'are', 'there', 'mature', 'women', 'nothing', 'make', 'director', 'visual', 'flair', 'pacing', 'movie', 'killed', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'involving', 'self-mutilation', 'were', 'treated', 'frivolously', 'Lee', 'submission', 'sadomasochistic', 'relationship', 'did', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'like', 'quirky', 'movies', 'repeated', 'spankings', 'seemed', 'way', 'place', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'more', 'restrained', 'approach', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'seduce', 'audience', 'seeing', 'how', 'Lee', 'could', 'be', 'attracted', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'come', 'execution', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'creating', 'sense', 'mystery', 'not', 'being', 'so', 'face', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'violent', 'spankings', 'sake', 'being', 'provocative.Most', 'will', 'probably', 'disagree', 'views', 'movie', 'owe', 'peers', 'courtesy', 'putting', 'two', 'cents', 'balance', 'decisions', 'who', 'discover', 'movies', 'great', 'site', 'Also', 'may', 'say', 'only', 'seeing', 'movie', 'not', 'allow', 'thorough', 'review', 'got', 'point', 'when', 'was', 'too', 'bored', 'uninterested', 'watch', 'huge', 'when', 'consider', 'have', 'only', 'walked', 'two', 'movies', 'whole', 'life.In', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'be', 'asking', 'view', 'lead', 'characters', 'kinkiness', 'not', 'innocuous', 'behavioural', 'difference', 'profoundly', 'liberating', 'statement', 'statement', 'too', 'bold', 'movie', 'way', 'heights', 'too', 'Maybe', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'documentary', 'film', 'waste', 'time', 'money']",N/A

She masks her emotional pain with the self-inflicted physical alternative; cutting herself but first seen with a scalding kettle being rested against her inner thigh. There was a flicker of a smile; perhaps that of self discovery. This motivates her to enter the world of adult work. She interviews for a job as a secretary. The interview is stilted.

After taking up typing she applies for a job as a secretary for E. Edward Grey (James Spader), an OCD lawyer with an apparently bustling law practice.  As the two grow to know one another, they learn a shared appreciation for an unorthodox physical, psychological, emotional attraction that transforms Lee from a pathetic girl next door into a more confident person and unleashes the creepy sadist sequestered inside Grey's calm demeanor.Gyllenhall and Spader act perfectly, but I suspect it's because they're perfect for the role.  She conveys emotion perfectly in this role because she appears to be a person of great emotional fragility and considerable deferment.  On the other hand, Spader delivers every role in his own collected style that's a bit too good not to be partially truthful.  I can't imagine any other actor in either role.Romantic and taboo at the same time, the plot flows well with some dark humor filling the gaps between BDSM scenes.

First of its kind in that it deals with themes never seen before seen in mainstream Hollywood cinema - S&M;, sexual dominance and submission. It was okay to me but it sort of left me cold in the end.Maggie Gyllenhaal is outstanding in a potential minefield of a role - she handles it with dignity and even provides some effective dark humor. The story here is that her character, Lee, applies for a job as a secretary for the firm owned by James Spader's brilliant Mr. Grey. However, Lee has a history of self-harm and masochism and Grey has a dominance complex along with a very sadistic streak. Combine these 2 in theory and you have 2 very happy people. But this is no ordinary love story...Spader, as stated, is great on this film. He brings icy steel to the troubled Grey, but also provides a touch of black humor which comes at some great moments to 'release the tension'.For the themes supplied here you'd probably expect a lot of raunchiness - well there are sexual moments, of course, but there is nothing gratuitous, which is in itself an achievement and well handled.Overall it's quirky, off-beat, and a little bit different.

738741,A205XI0CN5RMLP,B00008DDSA,"J. Figler ""jfigl""","[15, 17]","The opening scene of ""Secretary"" drops the viewer into the middle of the narrative. In a shot that will be repeated 55 minutes later, Lee carries out a variety of office duties with poise and efficiency --despite the fact that she is wearing a bizarre and uncomfortable-looking restraint that holds her arms straight out at the shoulders. The first time around the scene seems odd, almost repugnant; Lee lopes with unnerving calm to (longtime David Lynch collaborator) Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score around a unsettlingly baroque office. Then, abruptly, a title card: ""six months earlier"". The narrative proper begins.At first, it's unclear what this circuitous opening adds to the story, apart from an element of suspense that might not be if the events unfolded in strict chronological order: the opening scene presents a big ""What?""; we wait anxiously to learn the ""Why"". What other purpose this scene might serve becomes clear with its reprise. By then a subtle understanding of its context is possible. The remarkable Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues Lee with such supple humanity that the viewer has become more than sympathetic, and understands how much this long-suffering, unassumingly brave woman is enjoying herself, arm-restraints and all. The scene is no longer unsettling, but celebratory. The scene hasn't changed. Maybe we have. Director Steven Shainberg, on the DVD commentary track, says he hopes that his film will do for S&M; what ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" did for homosexuality almost 20 years ago-- increase mainstream understanding. Perhaps it will.On the same commentary track, the film's writer Erin Cressida Wilson says that the uncertain ""Um....."" Lee utters after Edward has administered the first blow in the justly famous spanking scene is Wilson's ""Favorite line"". She then chuckles, and modestly refrains from explaining what she means. Why it's good: Although this pivotal scene is fraught with emotion, Lee's tentative ""Um....."" is the only line of dialogue in it that acknowledges, even obliquely, what is taking place. Unlike the painfully verbose, excruciatingly clever screenwriters who currently plague independent film, Wilson realizes that what people say may be only tangentially related to what they mean, or are thinking, or what's happening, and that great feeling may lurk behind the most banal or fragmentary remark. ""Secretary"" is one of the strictest, fullest applications of this principle imaginable (Each page of the screenplay must contain one column each for speech and subtext). Never glib, never clever, just smart, ""Secretary"" is certainly a comedy of some sort, but it contains nothing that exactly qualifies as a joke. Its minimal dialogue leaves wide expanses in which the actors can and must communicate non-verbally. The leads are up to the task. Gyllenhaal (""JILL-in-hall"") and the always watchable James Spader make adept use of the full actor's arsenal: facial expression, posture -watch Lee's gait change in the course of the film-, verbal pauses and inflection create a world of meaning beneath deceptively mundane, often monosyllabic, dialogue.

The story centers around Lee played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who comes out of a psychiatric hospital for a compulsion to self mutilate and hurt herself, on top of having to live in a home were her dad can be an ugly drunk and a hapless overly codependent mother played by Leslie Ann Warren .  Upon her release from the hospital she plunges herself into her secretarial school where she excels and upon completion of her studies she applies for a position with a small legal office with Edward(James Spader),a rather perfectionist and imperious lawyer who tends to run secretaries out of his office.  He observes her and in some ways helps her, but becomes rather severe over typos due to having no computers and typewriters being the only way to make documents.At first he admonishes her then it graduates to spankings.  However once he knows of her self mutilation habit he orders her to stop to which she complies.  In a way it becomes a love story and who is to really say that love must always be soft and gentle and that submissibity and domination don't turn some people's cookie.

And if you leave the film thankful that you run with ""normal"" folks, then you probably just don't know the person in the adjacent work cube all that well.As the film begins, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been released from institutional therapy. Lee has a level of self-esteem that's abysmal to the point of involving self-mutilation with sharp objects. (She even has her own first aid kit to disinfect and treat the wounds as soon as she makes them!) And whatever therapy she got didn't stick. But, life goes on, so she takes a typing class, and subsequently lands a job as a SECRETARY for the perfectionist lawyer ""Mr. Grey"" (James Spader).Mutual assessment soon reveals potential for an S&M; relationship where Grey is the ""S"" and Lee the ""M"". Courting, so to speak, and foreplay involve the boss making increasingly difficult demands of Lee's job performance with the mutual understanding that the latter will fail and punishment will follow. And what's a poor girl to do when making deliberate spelling errors in legal correspondence just doesn't push Grey's lust button anymore?Spader's Grey persona is so deliciously creepy - not sinister, just creepy - that his paralegal does her work in such an unusual hiding place that she's rarely seen, even by the audience. And the delightful Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Holloway is so otherwise girl-next-door, except for her preoccupation with cutting edges, that I'm now surreptitiously scrutinizing our office secretaries for barely-hidden scars. And Jeremy Davies is terrific as Lee's nominal boyfriend, the painfully pathetic Peter.While SECRETARY was in the theaters, it probably wasn't a film that you would've taken your prim and proper grandmother to see for her day trip away from the assisted care facility. It has some artistically done full-frontal nudity and a couple scenes of X-rated heavy breathing. SECRETARY is a stylish and darkly humorous treatment of a delicate subject that allows the viewer to snicker without the guilty feeling of having been discovered with a dirty magazine. (Of course, if Granny finds it knee-slapping funny, you might want to rethink your assumptions about her younger years.) My only complaint was that the ending is perhaps a little too drawn out and tidy. A snappier, more edgy conclusion would have made the film a perfect gem.Now, where did I stash those red, felt tip markers? I have to proof an associate's work.",4,Oooo!

738752,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00008DDSA,Josh Hitchens,"[16, 18]","Steven Shainberg's ""Secretary"" is not a movie for everyone, but it should be. It depicts with honesty and wit a S/M relationship, a kind of alternative lifestyle that is usually used as a punch line or a sick joke. Instead, ""Secretary"" treats it fairly, and ends up being a fascinating character study of two very damaged people finding love in their own way. It contains wonderful directing and a clever screenplay, and two brilliant performances by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal.""Secretary"" is the story of Lee Holloway, played to absolute perfection by Maggie Gyllenhaal. When we first meet Lee, she is being released from a mental institution. Lee comes from an unhappy family life, and has been cutting herself since she was fourteen years old. It isn't long before her father's alcoholism and her mother's cluelessness drive her to self-mutilation once again. Realising that she is in a precarious situation, the chronically self-conscious Lee decides to get a job for the first time in her life.That's when she meets E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a lawyer who has an uncanny connection with Lee's pain. He hires Lee as his secretary, and it soon becomes obvious that Lee finds him attractive. Edward first plays humiliation games with Lee, such as forcing her to look for lost files in a dumpster, which she readily does. Then things get kinkier, as Edward begins to spank Lee when she makes a typo. Much to her surprise, Lee is incredibly turned on by this, and starts to make mistakes just to get punished.The plot twists much further from there, but I won't give it away. ""Secretary"" is a duet between two exceptionally gifted actors, and James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal deliver honest and brave portrayals of two people drowning. What you remember most about ""Secretary"" are the silences, when the camera focuses only on the expressive faces of Spader and Gyllenhaal. You can see the unfathomable depths of Lee's pain on her face, and the love that Edward feels for her and his shame for acting it out on Spader's.What makes ""Secretary"" a very important movie is summed up by Lee towards the end of the movie. She says, ""In one way or another I've always suffered. But I know I'm not so scared of suffering now. And I've found a way that's right for me."" In an age where so many films pass judgement on alternative lifestyles, ""Secretary"" simply says that this relationship is right for Lee and Edward, is loving and healthy. And what a refreshing thing that is.",4,A Different Kind of Love Story,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,2482,"['Steven', 'Shainberg', 'Secretary', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'honesty', 'wit', 'S/M', 'relationship', 'kind', 'alternative', 'lifestyle', 'usually', 'used', 'punch', 'line', 'sick', 'joke', 'Instead', 'Secretary', 'fairly', 'up', 'being', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'very', 'damaged', 'people', 'finding', 'love', 'own', 'way', 'wonderful', 'directing', 'clever', 'screenplay', 'two', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'James', 'Spader', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Secretary', 'story', 'Lee', 'Holloway', 'played', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Lee', 'being', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', 'Lee', 'unhappy', 'family', 'life', 'been', 'cutting', 'was', 'fourteen', 'years', 'old', ""n't"", 'long', 'father', 'alcoholism', 'mother', 'cluelessness', 'drive', 'self-mutilation', 'once', 'again', 'Realising', 'precarious', 'situation', 'chronically', 'self-conscious', 'Lee', 'get', 'job', 'first', 'time', 'life.That', 'when', 'E.', 'Edward', 'Grey', 'James', 'Spader', 'lawyer', 'who', 'uncanny', 'connection', 'Lee', 'pain', 'Lee', 'secretary', 'soon', 'obvious', 'Lee', 'attractive', 'Edward', 'first', 'humiliation', 'games', 'Lee', 'such', 'forcing', 'look', 'lost', 'files', 'dumpster', 'readily', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'kinkier', 'Edward', 'spank', 'Lee', 'when', 'typo', 'Much', 'surprise', 'Lee', 'incredibly', 'turned', 'make', 'mistakes', 'just', 'get', 'punished.The', 'plot', 'twists', 'much', 'further', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'Secretary', 'duet', 'two', 'exceptionally', 'gifted', 'actors', 'James', 'Spader', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'deliver', 'honest', 'brave', 'portrayals', 'two', 'people', 'drowning', 'What', 'remember', 'most', 'Secretary', 'are', 'silences', 'when', 'camera', 'only', 'expressive', 'Spader', 'Gyllenhaal', 'can', 'see', 'unfathomable', 'depths', 'Lee', 'pain', 'face', 'love', 'Edward', 'shame', 'acting', 'out', ""Spader's.What"", 'Secretary', 'very', 'important', 'movie', 'summed', 'up', 'Lee', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'way', ""'ve"", 'always', 'suffered', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'scared', 'suffering', 'now', ""'ve"", 'found', 'way', 'right', 'age', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'pass', 'judgement', 'alternative', 'lifestyles', 'Secretary', 'simply', 'relationship', 'right', 'Lee', 'Edward', 'loving', 'healthy', 'what', 'refreshing', 'thing']",N/A

When it was over, I was amazed.  I loved this movie.  It's an odd love story that just pulls the viewer in.  I found it interesting that in the beginning we see Lee as a frumpy, unpolished girl who evolves into a woman in front of our eyes with the help of Mr. Grey.  The formula ends with the tables turning in a sense with Lee being the dominant one in the relationship (at least I interpreted it that way.)  There were moments I was laughing my butt off (four peas, a small portion of mashed, no, cream potatoes, and all the ice cream one could want) and there were moments I was in shock (bathroom, typo letter, and the lady in the next stall).I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a different kind of love story.

I enjoyed Secretary a lot while watching it, however I feel it never quite attains 4 star status, although to condemn it to the level of the 3's seems a trifle harsh.The movie itself suffers from the same indecision.  It is unsure whether to be a campy play on an S&M; relationship, or whether to be a serious Solondz-esque examination of the dark side of the suburbs.  In the end it fails to achieve either.  The plot of the movie has been adequately described by other reviewers, and one doesn't want to give too much away.  The movie itself can be split into 3 main sections, which i shall name after the key ideas - Degredation, Devotion and Disgust.Degredation - The start of the movie revolves around degredation. The central character, Lee, is a self-abuser, freshly released from and institution.  In the minds of the writers, this means she needs a new pastime to stop her from cutting herself. The self bause here though is never shown on screen, making it hard for us to relate to the character - i think this is a cowardly move on behalf of the director. What happened, he didn't want to scare off the suburbanites?  Anyway, while the self abuse is pretty much left to our imagination, we are treated to a full rendition of the flowering relationship between her and her passive/aggressive boss.  Dr Grey is a lawyer with a particularily strong line in tough love, and we get to watch his transformation from a ""Bottom"" to a ""Top"", as he gets over the loss of his previous mistress and sets about enslaving Lee.  To enslave her me must first degrade her, and the most interesting scene in the first 1/3 of the movie occurs when he forces Lee to go dumpster-diving for a document he carelessly threw out.  The juxtaposition of her, in short skirt and high heels, climing into a dumpster and playing in the trash forces him to do some heavy exercise, presumably to punish himself both for the rising sexual urge and for degrading her in the first place.The themes are expanded in the second third of the movie, which i refer to as Devotion.  Here the lines between their work relationship and master/slave relationship are played out in a series of interesting scenes (her red pen fetish, his all-consuming guilt), and then increasingly blurred as these worlds become inseparable.  All good things must come to an end though, and she has to go and spoil everything by falling in love with him. Chicks, eh? While his revulsion at his own acts causes him to push her away. Men, eh?  This is where the movie works best, exploring the self-destructive streak in all of us in our quest for love, using S&M; merely as a metaphor for our own internally paradoxical desires to be in control of our world and hopelessly dependant on someone else.  You could get freudian here and delve into Eodipal undercurrants, but space forbits it here...I said the end of the movie is characterized by Disgust. That was all mine. Having set up an interesting premise and painted detailed portraits of the human psyche, the film makers run out of ideas and suddenly try to bring the movie to an end as abruptly as possible.  I don't want to ""spoil"" the ending, but it steals from Kafka's ""Hunger Arist"" short story, Tom Robbins' ""Still Life With Woodpecker"" novel and Radiohead's ""Just"" video and in the end plays more like a Renee Zelwegger film, which is ultimately a shame, and reduces the movie to the three star level.This is one of the sexiest movies i've seen all year - some of the scenes in the middle third are charged with erotic tension without resorting to nudity or even overt sexuality, however in the end (like the movie's best set pieces...) it is ultimately unsatisfying and one is left somewhat unfulfiled.( As a sidenote, I wonder if genuine S&M; afficinados find the premise that one must be disturbed or unhinged to enjoy S&M; ill-educated or just insulting...)A friend of mine saw this movie and walked out halfway though.

Things look innocent at first, then the sensuous romp really begins, when Ed forces Lee to deliver papers on all fours, play ""horsey"", and don various S&M; devices. Sexual pleasure, or merely a kindered spirit? Just another working girl? Maybe. Eventually, Lee is torn between obssession and mediocrity in her would-be fiance, played by Jeremy Davies.While ""Secretary"" is no lightweight, it may present some viewers with issues of moral contridiction. What is true love? Is it always the most pure and innocent of heart, or the one who will best foster our needs, be they inane fetishes or no? Perhaps Shainberg is too hellbent on creating psychological depth in character, or in the case of Ed, not enough of it.  I would love to give into the conclusion that Ed and Lee live happily ever after. But while Shainberg molds his characters convincingly, he forgets a helping of heart and compassion, which seems stiffled and repressed.What's wrong with innocence and love? Nothing apparently, but I guess bizarre fetish and sado-masochism goes a lot farther. Atleast that will keep your peepers on the screen for the hour and a half that is ""Secretary"".

I won't go into detail about plot and such, because it has all been said in previous reviews, but I will share some of my personal opinions.This movie is very disturbing, but the two leading players are fascinating to watch. I am a huge fan of James Spader, and he just shines in these kind of ""twisted"" roles. He is definitely one of the world's greatest actors and this is one of his best performances. (Even though all of his performances are top-notch)! And Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely fantastic as well! She is obviously a very talented actress with a lot of guts. I give her a lot of credit for taking a role that many women wouldn't touch. The only real qualm I have with this film is that it could have gone into a little more detail about Mr. Grey's past and why he behaves the way he does. It didn't provide enough information about his character's previous exploits.Another thing about this film that makes it unique is the way that it is able to be flat-out sexy without a lot of actual sex. The tensions between the two characters are so complex and I was always wondering what they would be feeling (and doing!) next. Seriously, the sexual tension in several of the scenes is so thick that you can cut it with a knife (this is especially true with the spanking scene). And you just gotta love those red Sharpies! Also, the musical score is terrific and highly seductive.Overall, this is a great film and it was interesting to see a different kind of love lifestyle (although it is one that I would never pursue myself)! The ending is touching and it was good to see how these two people finally came together and shared some gentle, caring and tender moments. I am not a big fan of nudity in movies, but the scenes in this film were done in an artistic, respectful and beautiful way.I have watched this movie several times already, but nothing compares to the experience of seeing it for the very first time. Initially, I found this film to be shocking and even mildly disgusting. After thinking about it for a little while, however, I grew to realize what a fine independent picture SECRETARY is...and now I love it!

Bernabo,"[17, 20]","Believe it or not the word that kept coming to mind as I watched &quot;Secretary&quot; was &quot;cute.&quot;  This might strike you as strange given that it is a movie about sadomasochism, but this was the word my wife kept using during the last half of this 2002 film from director Steven Shainberg.  I checked out &quot;Secretary&quot; because I heard it was &quot;quirky,&quot; which is usually not synonymous with &quot;cute.&quot;  &quot;Secretary&quot; benefits from perfect casting, with James Spader as Mr. Grey, the paralegal, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Miss Holloway, the titular character.  Obviously, when the word &quot;cute&quot; arises it is intended primarily to describe Gyllenhaal, which is important because her character could be written off as a pathetic soul instead of someone who provokes our sympathy (and perhaps our admiration as well).Miss Holloway has just been released from a mental institution; she likes to cut herself and the last time she went a bit too far.  Now her mother (Lesley Ann Warren) locks up all the knives and the young woman goes off into the world to find her first job.  She has excellent typing scores but there is something else that makes Mr. Grey hire her when she goes to her first interview, and several weeks later when she makes an error on a letter we discover what it is: these two were made for each other and soon Miss Holloway is making mistakes on purpose so that Mr. Grey can discipline her.There are three things that make this movie work at this point.  The first is that Mr. Grey orders her to stop cutting herself.  Now her pain is going to be administered primarily in terms of spanking, which is nowhere nearly as dangerous as piercing her flesh with sharp objects.  She is, by objective standards, better off under his control.  The second is that Miss Holloway never expresses fear over what she is being asked to do.  Her complete acceptance, combined with the previous point, aid in our acceptance of the situation.  The third is that underneath it all &quot;Secretary&quot; is a standard love story.  Two people looking for love find each other and struggle to make a complete connection that will allow them to build a life together.  There are other characters in this film, but they are all minor players in the main drama between Mr. Grey and Miss Holloway.Long ago we discovered that in a romance film the &quot;I love you&quot; line is almost never those three particular worlds.  It is &quot;Here's looking at you kid,&quot; &quot;Where are my slippers,&quot; or something equally memorable.  &quot;Secretary&quot; is no different in that regard, although it is obviously a film where actions speak louder than words.  This is the story of two people who have a love that they are able to make work.  That is nothing to laugh at, and, indeed, the film saves its funniest moments for a time when the relationship has been resolved.  This is, despite expectations to the contrary and the utter surprise of a large portion of the audience, a cute film.Final note: Make a point of considering how nudity is used in this film.  I think the point in &quot;Secretary&quot; in which the nudity becomes more that brief is rather surprising and it made me think about why it was at that particular point it was used.  There is significance to this choice that needs to be appreciated.",5,&quot;Secretary&quot; is actually a cute love story about S&amp;M,1057017600,"07 1, 2003",2003,3356,"['Believe', 'not', 'word', 'kept', 'coming', 'mind', 'watched', 'quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'was', 'quot', 'cute.', 'quot', 'might', 'strike', 'strange', 'given', 'movie', 'sadomasochism', 'was', 'word', 'wife', 'kept', 'using', 'last', 'half', '2002', 'film', 'director', 'Steven', 'Shainberg', 'checked', 'out', 'quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'heard', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'usually', 'not', 'synonymous', 'quot', 'cute.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'benefits', 'perfect', 'casting', 'James', 'Spader', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'paralegal', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Miss', 'Holloway', 'titular', 'character', 'Obviously', 'when', 'word', 'quot', 'cute', 'quot', 'intended', 'primarily', 'describe', 'Gyllenhaal', 'important', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'pathetic', 'soul', 'instead', 'someone', 'who', 'sympathy', 'perhaps', 'admiration', 'as', 'well', '.Miss', 'Holloway', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', 'cut', 'last', 'time', 'went', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'Now', 'mother', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'up', 'knives', 'young', 'woman', 'off', 'world', 'find', 'first', 'job', 'excellent', 'typing', 'scores', 'something', 'else', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'hire', 'when', 'first', 'interview', 'several', 'weeks', 'later', 'when', 'error', 'letter', 'discover', 'what', 'two', 'were', 'made', 'other', 'soon', 'Miss', 'Holloway', 'making', 'mistakes', 'purpose', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'can', 'discipline', 'are', 'three', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'point', 'first', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'orders', 'stop', 'cutting', 'Now', 'pain', 'going', 'be', 'administered', 'primarily', 'terms', 'spanking', 'nowhere', 'nearly', 'as', 'dangerous', 'piercing', 'flesh', 'sharp', 'objects', 'objective', 'standards', 'better', 'off', 'control', 'second', 'Miss', 'Holloway', 'never', 'fear', 'what', 'being', 'asked', 'do', 'Her', 'complete', 'acceptance', 'combined', 'previous', 'point', 'aid', 'acceptance', 'situation', 'third', 'quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'standard', 'love', 'story', 'Two', 'people', 'looking', 'love', 'find', 'other', 'struggle', 'make', 'complete', 'connection', 'will', 'allow', 'build', 'life', 'together', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'minor', 'players', 'main', 'drama', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'Miss', 'Holloway.Long', 'discovered', 'romance', 'film', 'quot', 'love', 'quot', 'line', 'almost', 'never', 'three', 'particular', 'worlds', 'quot', 'Here', 'looking', 'kid', 'quot', 'quot', 'Where', 'are', 'slippers', 'quot', 'something', 'equally', 'memorable', 'quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'different', 'regard', 'obviously', 'film', 'where', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'love', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'work', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'indeed', 'film', 'funniest', 'moments', 'time', 'when', 'relationship', 'been', 'resolved', 'expectations', 'contrary', 'utter', 'surprise', 'large', 'portion', 'audience', 'cute', 'film.Final', 'note', 'Make', 'point', 'considering', 'how', 'nudity', 'used', 'film', 'think', 'point', 'quot', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'nudity', 'more', 'brief', 'rather', 'surprising', 'made', 'think', 'why', 'was', 'particular', 'point', 'was', 'used', 'significance', 'choice', 'be', 'appreciated']",N/A

738768,AAX9ZIMIYJ77W,B00008DDSA,Lei,"[1, 1]","The secretary is simply splendid and refreshing. I am glad to see a film that is unconventional, yet still has traces of a romantic comedy.  Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a cutter. She gives herself pain and in return gets pleasure from it. In the beginning of the film Lee gets out of the hospital and looks for a job. He starts working for a lawyer, Mr. Grey (James Spader). Mr. Grey himself has psychological issues having to do with control. Initially the relationship they have is sort of shocking, but you soon realize that it may actually be healthy. The issues that they have sort of come together to fit in a yin yang. They begin to complement each other.  Lee was a good role for Maggie Gyllenhaal. I think she did very well. I always enjoy watching James Spader's performances.

Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee, a young woman who has just been released from a mental hospital.  Seems she's into self-mutilation and even though her mother hides all the knives in the house, Lee still manages do some surreptitious cuts on her inner thighs with her manicure implements.  Soon, she gets a secretarial job for a lawyer, played by James Spader. It's a rather strange office where they still use old-fashioned manual typewriters. Weird details like this keep the story unreal.In spite of a rather placid romance with another former mental hospital graduate, Jeremy Davis, there's no doubt that Lee is attracted to her boss, who shows signs of having his own compulsive mental problems.  Eventually, she makes some typographical errors.  Her boss then has her bend over the desk while he administers a spanking.  She's immediately turned on and starts to pursue him.The script does well in that it makes the secretary both vulnerable and plucky at the same time.  There's a lot of character development. She's a fine actress and seems to own the role.  James Spader and Jeremy Davis are excellent as well.  The script does not do well when it lapses into dreamy fantasy sequences which slow down the action.  It's also longer than it needs to be and makes the same points too many times.  And the ending is ridiculous and doesn't grow intrinsically from the plot.The best thing about ""Secretary""  is that it's different and treads where others have feared to go.  The tone is lighthearted throughout and there are some real connections between the characters during the erotic scenes.  However, it sure isn't for everybody.  And some people will find it quite uncomfortable to watch.  I enjoyed it but it just had too many faults for me to give it more than a lukewarm recommendation.",4,"Offbeat comedy, treading where others have feared to go",1037404800,"11 16, 2002",2002,1927,"['film', 'eroticism', 'classic', 'dominance', 'submission', 'yet', 'quirky', 'character-driven', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Lee', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'self-mutilation', 'even', 'mother', 'knives', 'house', 'Lee', 'still', 'do', 'surreptitious', 'cuts', 'inner', 'thighs', 'manicure', 'implements', 'Soon', 'secretarial', 'job', 'lawyer', 'played', 'James', 'Spader', 'rather', 'strange', 'office', 'where', 'still', 'use', 'old-fashioned', 'manual', 'typewriters', 'Weird', 'details', 'story', 'unreal.In', 'spite', 'rather', 'placid', 'romance', 'former', 'mental', 'hospital', 'graduate', 'Jeremy', 'Davis', 'doubt', 'Lee', 'attracted', 'boss', 'who', 'signs', 'having', 'own', 'compulsive', 'mental', 'problems', 'Eventually', 'typographical', 'errors', 'boss', 'then', 'bend', 'desk', 'spanking', 'immediately', 'turned', 'starts', 'pursue', 'him.The', 'script', 'well', 'secretary', 'vulnerable', 'plucky', 'same', 'time', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'fine', 'actress', 'own', 'role', 'James', 'Spader', 'Jeremy', 'Davis', 'are', 'excellent', 'well', 'script', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'when', 'dreamy', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'slow', 'down', 'action', 'also', 'longer', 'be', 'same', 'points', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'ending', 'ridiculous', ""n't"", 'grow', 'intrinsically', 'plot.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Secretary', 'different', 'treads', 'where', 'others', 'have', 'feared', 'go', 'tone', 'lighthearted', 'are', 'real', 'connections', 'characters', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'However', 'sure', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'faults', 'give', 'more', 'lukewarm', 'recommendation']",N/A

I was surprised it was much more serious and much more beautiful - - yes, beautiful - - a story than I had ever anticipated!  This film could easily have become much more twisted and dark (Boxing Helena, anyone?) or much more campy (Frankenhooker), but instead it evolves into an examination of a mutually satisfying relationship - - on an emotional level, even though there is a lot of the physical going on.  There is humor, but it is subtle enough to kind of tickle your brain fleetingly and keep you in the story.  The submission/domination plot line is actually very cerebral.  I think you could actually get two very different movie-going experiences with this film.  One would be a ""oh, what a sweet movie, plus I got some kinky eye-candy to boot"" and the other would be an experience where you recognize symbolism, you examine self-empowerment issues, you mentally debate feminist vs traditional ideals, etc.  But then again, maybe I just think too much!James Spader (as Edward) is just wonderful at playing this type of character, tortured and mysterious, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Lee) very effectively blossoms from beginning to end of the story.  The extraneous characters are developed just enough to give you a good sense of what their roles (dysfunctions and all) are before the story begins, and leaves them at that.  Yes, I had questions but easily let them go.  The true focus is on Lee and Edward.  I must also mention, without actually spoiling the plot for you, the storyline between the pinnacle of the conflict to the ending is just fraught with fantastic symbolism, utilizing nudity, nature, water, light.  It really piqued the intellectual part of my brain.All in all, I think this movie could be one of my new favorite love stories.  I'm not a fan of the Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks syrupy sweet romantic comedies, but ""Secretary"" was much easier for me to relate to because the characters are so non-perfect.  As a mother, this is not a movie I would be comfortable watching with my children present.

In recent years, those roles and themes have become more visible, controversial and erotic.  Where censorship strives to dismiss controversy, ""Secretary"" embraces it and offers us an unforgetable tour of the taboo.""Secretary"" forces us to look outside of the box - and see through the eyes of Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal).  Lee is of a unique breed, who gets pleasure from pain and finds security out of being submissive.  Lee returns home for her sister's wedding after having spent time in a mental patient facility.  We are immediately find out she is a cutter and inflicts wounds of all sorts for a sense of relief.  Determined to not spend all her time at home with her dysfunctional family, she gets a job working as a secretary in a law office for E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  Grey is an abrasive anal-retentive man who apparently runs through secretaries every few months or so.  We soon witness his growing infactuations with Lee and through his mood swings and psuedo-violent behaviors, a strange sort of romance develops between them.  He begins to abuse her and as these habits become more severe, she looks for more ways to receive abuse.  Lee must then balance her two seperate lives, living with her family/exploring a relationship with a childhood boyfriend and the taboo S&M; relationship she carries with her employer.  Both worlds,of course, interfere with each other, ultimately ending with a final confrontation and a surprise ending.Maggie Gyllenhaal has proven herself to be a superb actress.  Her character seems so real in all her actions - there is nothing campy about her subtle nature and her excitement's crescendos.  Though her role is small in this feature, Leslie Ann Warren lends her usual charismatic prescence as Lee's over protective suburban mother.  James Spader is surprisingly cold and calculated in all of his antics.  Each expression on his face becomes immaculately complex, as to which we must question what is going through his head as he spanks his ""helpless"" employee leaning over his desk.One must remember that this movie relys on exposing the dark side of sexuality.  Full female nudity, masturbation and sex is blunty displayed in a few scenes.  What makes this art instead of smut is the underlying emotional states of the characters.  One can only hope to find some understanding of their psychology and desires.  Because of how controversial the subject matter is, this movie is not for everyone.

Thier mutual attraction is obvious.  She even acquires a nice but slightly wet boyfriend.  Then one night E.

Shainberg previously directed the forgettable ""Hit Me"", and it's clear from this film, that he's growing into his craft.  The film is worthy of the acclaim it received, although it will never be a mainstream favorite.  Both James Spader, who has made a career of quirky parts, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, in her first major role, are outstanding as brooding employer/employee who share a dark secret of dominance.Lee, Gyllenhaal's character, invented the word dysfunctional, and exhibits destructive behavior, even though she's just been released from a psychiatric care facility.  Lee's a cutter, and just having her back in the house again is upsetting for the rest of her loony family.The film makes you feel as though you are with Lee, waiting to determine whatever it is in life that could possibly make her happy.  You begin to think she's stumbled into the subservient role as secretary to the tightly wrapped E. Edward Gray, awaiting his commands, whatever they might be.  It is only as the relationship evolves that you can see how much they both gain from it, and how this becomes a romance that perhaps only the two of them can appreciate.  Shainberg's given us a film that is a rich tapestry of color and movement,  he's made us care about his wounded and complex characters, and placed comic touches in a film that doesn't become either voyeuristic or over-the-top with kinky images.Viewers be warned, there are a number of fetishes played out on the screen, bondage, and nudity.  There probably could have been an NC-17 rating assigned to the film.  But if you skip it, due to this, be aware that you may be missing the beginning of two great careers, those of Shainberg &amp; Gyllenhaal; as well as some of Spader's best work.Technically, the DVD has little to offer beyond the film itself.

In ""Secretary"", she makes her starring role debut, and she's terrific. Gyllenhaal plays Lee Holloway, an unstable girl who has just been released from a mental institution. She gets a job as a secretary for Edward Grey, an overbearing lawyer (James Spader). Edward is far from a normal boss however. His punishment for typos and minor spelling errors begin with mild humiliation, but as Lee swiftly responds to his demands,the punishments slowly begin to escalate.""Secretary"" treats kinky sex with extreme tenderness. To his credit, director and co-writer Steven Shainberg depicts the strange sexual interplay between Lee and Edward, with restraint. He is more interested in their emotions than their actions, and weights the images accordingly. When Lee goes to work for Edward, he sees her only as another in a string of women who will indulge his fantasies of dominance. But Lee transforms their connection from a game to a relationship, and paradoxically frees them both from guilt and self-hatred.Mr. Spader does a smart, considered job as Edward, a man who does not understand his own needs until Lee begins to bloom with his attention. Just as he helps her unlock her sensuality, she helps him unlock his kindness.Based on a highly regarded short story by Mary Gaitskill, the movie shows wit as well as insight. Lee attempts a romantic relationship with a fellow psychiatric case (Jeremy Davies), including a bedroom interlude. When he sweetly asks, ""Did I hurt you?"" there is no disguising the disappointment in her voice when she answers ""No.""Whether it shocks or disturbs or amuses, ""Secretary"" deserves applause for doing something most movies avoid these days: addressing adult sexuality - a non-mainstream kind of sexuality -with wit, style and compassion.

738779,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00008DDSA,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 4]","OK, they say you should never judge a book by its cover, but the only reason I bought this movie was because of the cover. It's one of the funkiest covers I've seen recently, and it aroused my curiosity, as to what the film was actually about. So I bought it, along with Notting Hill.Although I did originally want to watch Tears of the Sun, it was too long, and it was already quite late at night. So I chose this instead. There was a severe lack of extras on this DVD that I bought, just a couple of trailers, and one particularly for House of 1000 Corpses (ugh!). I doubt I would have paid full price for the DVD with extras though. Although it would have been good to see what Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader said about the film.I'd previously only seen Maggie Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko (alongside her real life gorgeous brother, Jake) & Mona Lisa Smile, so wasn't sure what to expect from her in the main role, although she certainly shone in Mona Lisa Smile. However, she's an excellent, versatile actress. I wasn't as keen on James Spader though, I think someone sort of sexier looking, or more evil looking could have done the part a lot better. For some reason I have Jack Nicholson's face in my head now, which isn't pretty, so lets try Christian Slater instead! I suppose James Spader played the slightly nerdy type OK, but I still think someone better could have filled his shoes. Plus, he's not a ""hottie"" as other reviewers have described. Maybe it's just me, but I like a bit of rough! Not Jack Nicholson though - bleurgh. (Now Gwyneth Paltrow was going to play Lee Holloway - that wouldn't have been good at all!!!)This film wasn't subtle in any way, by portrayed some of the stuff it did, which would have people avoiding the movie altogether, and censors running for their 'red pens'. The relationship between Lee & Edward (or if you prefer, Mr Gray or Sir) is definitely a strange one, but fascinating at the same time, as he blows hot & cold with her. One minute he wants her, the next he doesn't. I love the way he watched her too, when he thought she wasn't looking, and the way he kept that one red pen. I loved the way she desperately tried to get his attention, including sending him a worm in the mail - I'm not sure I got that. The S&M; scenes are kept relatively tame in tone and the film displays a wickedly funny sense of humour for most of its duration. I'm not sure I would go as far as the heavy handed spanking myself doesn't really do it for me, but I applaud the makeup artists, for the fantastic job on the bruising on Maggie's behind.The differences between the two scenes, the first one with Lee & the boyfriend she gets lumped with, and then Mr Gray, are huge. It's obvious she doesn't want to be with Peter, and he's boring in bed. And makes the strangest noises!!!I'm not sure I would call this a love story. The finale, although upbeat, was a bit out of touch with the rest of the movie. The relationship is moving (very moving, in fact). But, because of the nature of the relationship, there are some very funny scenes, like Lee masturbating, while repeating the dinner instructions Spader gave her earlier in the evening (four peas, a half-scoop of mash, and as much ice cream as she can eat). I found the similar James Spader scene quite strange. Her eyes though when he first spanks her, she has got really expressive eyes, next to Neve Campbell.With quite a few relationships/flings starting in the office, this gives the movie its shock value.I'm not sure about the nudity towards the end though. It was completely unnecessary for the movie. I didn't particularly need to see Maggie full frontal (which you will get guys), and she looks like she needs a good feeding! Although I was wishing I had a stomach like hers, not if I need to starve myself to get it.It would have been interesting to see the extras to on this, just to see whether James or Maggie mentioned that they needed a few stiff ones (DRINKS!) to do some scenes. On the ""extras"" version of this DVD, the extras include a commentary by director Steven Shainberg and the writers; a featurette and a photo gallery.The song that plays over Mr. Gray and Lee at the end of the movie is ""Chariots Rise"" by Lizzie West. The original lyric is ""What a fool am I, to fall so in love,"" but the director did not want to imply that Lee was being foolish, and asked if it could be altered. Because she wanted the song to be in the movie, Lizzie West re-recorded the line as ""What grace have I, to fall so in love.""I would definitely recommend this movie, although not for the easily embarrassed (which I would have normally said I was), or young innocents out there. You need to view this movie with an open mind.",4,Offbeat. Quirky. Weird.

738783,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00008DDSA,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[9, 13]","In the tradition of Boogie Nights, Secretary takes the taboo and wraps it in a typical romance format.  Boogie Nights told a coming of age family story that happened to involve porn; Secretary tells a romance that happens to involve sadomasochism.Our heroine is the vulnerable Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal, sister to brother Jake of Donnie Darko fame).  Gyllenhaal has a waifish, almost unearthly look about her that radiates a sad vulnerability, which makes her perfect for the role.  As Lee, she players a character filled with self-loathing, hating herself so much that she not-so-secretly cuts her thigh with a razorblade.  When her parents eventually discover her destructive habits, they commit her to a mental institution.  Lee is eventually released, but she will never truly get ""better.""As an important first step in escaping her restrictive home life, Lee gets a job as a secretary.  She works for the intimidating Mr. Grey (James Spader), who brooks no failure.  Working for the handsome boss turns out to be a challenge Lee enjoys, in more ways than one.Once Mr. Grey discovers that Lee is a masochist, he takes slowl but subtle control of her world. Grey alternately sets Lee free and dominates her by telling her she will never cut herself again.  And Lee complies, throwing away her box of sewing equipment that she used to mutilate herself.But Lee's release is also a taste of the forbidden that she craves.  Eventually, Mr. Grey resorts to spanking as a form of discipline, a torture she enjoys.  Thus begins the S&M; relationship between boss and secretary.Although they don't sleep with each other, the two engage in kinkier pleasures as the days go by.  In the mean time, Lee continues the faade of a normal life, dating a bland boy named Peter (Jeremy Davies) who offers an equally bland future.  Eventually, he proposes; in a haze, Lee accepts.But she shouldn't have, and she knows it.  Mr. Grey's affections stop as he is overcome with guilt for what he has done to Lee.  He fires her and, we come to realize, perpetuates a cycle of anticipation, secret pleasure, and guilt.  But unlike the secretaries in the past, Lee has no intention of giving up on her man.The ending is at least as torturous as the movie itself is to watch.  Mr. Grey, disturbed at Lee's infatuation with him, orders her to sit at his desk and stay there until he says otherwise. Finally standing up for something, anything, Lee refuses to remove her palms from the desk.  For days.Secretary is a character piece, and Lee does not disappoint.  She puts her considerably talents, her raw vulnerability, before the camera both physically and emotionally.  She's so vulnerable, in fact, that it's sometimes hard to watch.Despite its subject matter, Secretary steadfastly refuses to exploit its characters.  Secretary lays the framework for a typical romance, despite the fact that it sometimes involves spanking and a horsewhip. We come to realize that these two deeply troubled people relate to each other through pain.  And as long as they trust each other, that's okay.Although it's certainly not for everybody, Secretary puts an entertaining twist on the usual boy meets girl format.  It's more girl meets boy, boy spanks girl, and they live happily ever after.",3,"Girl meets boy, boy spanks girl, and they live happily ever after",1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,3261,"['tradition', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Secretary', 'taboo', 'typical', 'romance', 'format', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'told', 'coming', 'age', 'family', 'story', 'happened', 'involve', 'porn', 'Secretary', 'romance', 'involve', 'sadomasochism.Our', 'heroine', 'vulnerable', 'Lee', 'Holloway', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'sister', 'brother', 'Jake', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'fame', 'Gyllenhaal', 'waifish', 'almost', 'unearthly', 'look', 'sad', 'vulnerability', 'perfect', 'role', 'Lee', 'players', 'character', 'filled', 'self-loathing', 'hating', 'so', 'much', 'not-so-secretly', 'thigh', 'razorblade', 'When', 'parents', 'eventually', 'destructive', 'habits', 'commit', 'mental', 'institution', 'Lee', 'eventually', 'released', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'get', 'better', 'important', 'first', 'step', 'escaping', 'restrictive', 'home', 'life', 'Lee', 'job', 'secretary', 'intimidating', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'James', 'Spader', 'who', 'failure', 'Working', 'handsome', 'boss', 'out', 'be', 'challenge', 'Lee', 'more', 'ways', 'one.Once', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'Lee', 'masochist', 'slowl', 'subtle', 'control', 'world', 'Grey', 'alternately', 'Lee', 'free', 'telling', 'will', 'never', 'cut', 'again', 'Lee', 'complies', 'throwing', 'away', 'box', 'sewing', 'equipment', 'used', 'mutilate', 'herself.But', 'Lee', 'release', 'also', 'taste', 'forbidden', 'Eventually', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'spanking', 'form', 'discipline', 'torture', 'Thus', 'S', 'M', 'relationship', 'boss', 'secretary.Although', 'do', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'other', 'two', 'engage', 'kinkier', 'pleasures', 'days', 'go', 'mean', 'time', 'Lee', 'faade', 'normal', 'life', 'dating', 'bland', 'boy', 'named', 'Peter', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'who', 'equally', 'bland', 'future', 'Eventually', 'haze', 'Lee', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'affections', 'stop', 'overcome', 'guilt', 'what', 'done', 'Lee', 'come', 'realize', 'cycle', 'anticipation', 'secret', 'pleasure', 'guilt', 'secretaries', 'past', 'Lee', 'intention', 'giving', 'up', 'man.The', 'ending', 'least', 'as', 'torturous', 'movie', 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Grey', 'disturbed', 'Lee', 'infatuation', 'orders', 'sit', 'desk', 'stay', 'there', 'otherwise', 'Finally', 'standing', 'up', 'something', 'anything', 'Lee', 'remove', 'palms', 'desk', 'days.Secretary', 'character', 'piece', 'Lee', 'not', 'disappoint', 'considerably', 'talents', 'raw', 'vulnerability', 'camera', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'so', 'vulnerable', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'watch.Despite', 'subject', 'matter', 'Secretary', 'steadfastly', 'exploit', 'characters', 'Secretary', 'framework', 'typical', 'romance', 'fact', 'spanking', 'horsewhip', 'come', 'realize', 'two', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'people', 'relate', 'other', 'pain', 'as', 'long', 'trust', 'other', 'certainly', 'not', 'everybody', 'Secretary', 'entertaining', 'twist', 'usual', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'format', 'more', 'girl', 'meets', 'boy', 'boy', 'spanks', 'girl', 'live', 'happily', 'ever']",N/A

Lee is a young girl with a history of psychological problems that have led to destructive and suicidal behavior.  After a brief glimpse of the sophisticated submissive that she becomes, the story is told in flashback beginning with her release from a psychiatric facility.  Coming home to a timid and nervous mother, it's easy to question how effective her treatment was when she immediately takes shelter in her room and reverently fondles the knives that she's used to cut herself in the past.She applies for a secretarial job with Edward, a strangely detached attorney played by James Spader (a few years ago this role would have gone to Christopher Walken).  It quickly becomes evident that his performance standards are not necessarily within the norms of conventional office conduct, more apropos of a dungeon than an office.  But Lee discovers a bond (no pun intended) that she had never before imagined, and the interplay between secretary and boss, master and submissive becomes fascinating to watch.  At times it becomes questionable as to who is manipulating who.  But it's clear that these are two very strange personalities that have drifted into a very symbiotic and ultimately beneficial relationship.If images of sadomasochism and bondage will offend you, stay clear of this.  But for a very complex character study, it's difficult to top.

I noticed quite a bit of jitter and a lot of grain (which I understand is sometimes intended by the cinematographer and or director... ie 'predator'). I'm talking black and white 1940's Criterion Collection grain.

Shy, frumpy and unsure of herself, Lee initially has trouble coping with Mr. Grey's perfectionism. The boss and  secretary's dependency on one another grows and evolves into an overt dominant-submissive relationship. Through this relationship, Lee gains self-confidence and is able to put the self-destructive habits of her past behind her. Both Lee and Mr. Grey find the love and understanding that they crave in this unconventional but mutually fulfilling relationship.Secretary is equal parts love story, psychological drama, and sex farce. In some ways, it is a classic romance: Two needy people discover that what they need is each other. But in Secretary, the characters' emotional needs are extreme, and their ways of expressing love are eccentric. The film treats the subject of dominant-submissive relationships with humor and generally good nature. It doesn't equate these relationships with dysfunction, but instead asserts that dominant-submissive behavior can be a way for some people to  overcome dysfunction, or at least to transform it into something harmless. The performances are terrific. James Spader is wonderful as Mr. Grey, a middle-aged divorced lawyer who is distrustful of love and sometimes afraid of what his own desires might mean. Maggie Gyllenhaal is radiant, funny, and totally convincing as the bright but troubled young secretary.Secretary isn't graphic, but it is kinky, and it does not moralize. If you don't like the idea of ""alternative"" lifestyles, you won't like this film. If you don't mind breaking with convention, I highly recommend Secretary.

If, however, you're a fan of offbeat movies with wonderfully drawn characters then this is definitely worth a look.  The story has sado-masochist, withdrawn Lee (Gyllenhaal) take up a job as secretary at the offices of Edward Grey (Spader), a bullying depressive lawyer.  As the relationship grows in intensity, spanking included, both Lee and Grey wonder how they can unite their inner turmoil to the way the other makes them feel.The acting is brilliant.  Gyllenhall really proves that she has what it takes to be an actress of her generation, easily overtaking other talented competition from Kirsten Dunst and Reese Witherspoon.  Clearly a beautiful young woman she manages to hold herself in such a way as to make her appear the most dumpy, boring, painfully shy girl you'd ever come across.  Sister to Donnie Darko star Jake, she clearly proves herself just as worthy of acclaim as her sibling.  Spader takes a pretty similar role to that he had in Crash a few years ago, though here he adds in a kind of profound depression into his bullying ways and really sparkles with his co-star.When reviews say this isn't a movie for everyone, that's true.  A lot of people like their love stories straightforward, and this is anything but.  Laced with dry humour Secretary traces one of the year's most delicate, beautiful relationships as Lee and Grey find in each other exactly what they'd never realised they'd needed their whole lives.  The ending will leave you with exactly the right amount of hope for love in a world where only loneliness and self harm seem to be the answer for its characters.

A watchable engaging one, but nevertheless an oddity.I suppose Steven Shainberg has taken a difficult subject and humanized it quite nicely.  Lee Holloway, played deftly by Maggie Gyllenhaal, has a self-deprecating personality that she takes out upon herself in careful sharp and cutting means.  It doesn't seem too healthy and may be disturbing by the general Joe and Jill Q. Public to watch.  E. Edward Grey, also well-played, by James Spader, is a neat-freak lawyer that seems equally isolated and disturbed.  Just about all the characters in this flick (and they aren't many), have issues of the emotional kind.Though it might not be a film for everyone, in the end we know the twisted people and oddly enough find them human wanting in the needs that all human want, connection, meaning, compassion.  It is odd that it comes to this.Don't miss the belly-aching laugh of Gyllenhaal's character attempting to delve into the world of S&amp;M by throwing tomatoes at a furtive and bound soul (bound to a oven no less).  It is a hoot.If your squeamish or your taste are on the slightly prude side, steer clear of Secretary.  If not, and you possess an open-mind, by all means give Secretary a watch.

This film frankly tackles sexuality, gender, age and experience as they relate to power and control, in fairly explicit terms.I'm a big James Spader fan from way back. I have a great soft spot for his gloriously self-indulgent 'Yuppie scum' performances from The Brat Pack years, elements of which are seen here along with significant influence of his roles in SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE and WHITE PALACE.Spader's E. Edward Grey is obsessed with big red Sharpie markers, orchids, humane mousetraps and sugary coffee. And spanking, just to name a few things. He's created a false pastoral environment in his office, carefully watering and feeding his orchids among the sickly green paneling and placing a row of dying houseplants along the dark hallway leading up to his office. The light in the office is murky, giving the impression that nothing could grow there, but could definitely fester.Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a gutsy performance as Lee Holloway, Mr. Grey's secretary and eventual counterpart in a submissive/dominant relationship. Lee, like Mr. Grey, is delicate and high-strung. We see Lee just released from a six-month stint in an institution to attend her sister's pink, plastic, Florida poolside wedding. She stands apart from both the other guests and her family at the reception, enveloped in an ill-fitting blue dress and the viewer is not surprised when she retreats to her bedroom and methodically begins cutting her thigh.As Lee and Mr. Grey become drawn to one another, Lee begins evolving into a more confident, attractive woman. Her shapeless clothes and sloppy sweaters are traded in for knee-length skirts, nylons and heels. When Mr. Grey tells her that she doesn't need to cut herself anymore, she actually throws away her implements. She comes to thrive on his attention, starting with his gleeful discovery of typing errors to circle with his red pens and slowly escalating to more explicit behavior.The biggest surprise of the film lies in the fact that at its core it is a romance.

""Secretary"" suffers during its last third by not really having anywhere to go with the story it has introduced so entertainingly in the first two thirds of the film.Fortunately, the cast comes through in the end even if the movie does not. By the end Maggie Gyllengaal (the title character), James Spader (her boss), and Jeremy Davies (her boyfriend) have all managed to achieve the rare distinction of leaving us convinced that no one else could have played their characters so well and that Director Steven Shainberg made three perfect casting decisions.Most guys will have fallen in love with Gyllengaal by the midway point of the first trailer they see for the film. What they find in the film will confirm that their instincts were correct. Most actresses would have been unable to keep the character from seeming pathetic but Gyllenhaal makes her seem plucky, and her quiet assertiveness (once she has found something she wants) permits the film to transcend its political incorrectness and actually celebrate our uniqueness.In what I thought the funniest scene, Gyllengaal and Davies take the stale ""fake organism"" device and play it better than it has ever been done. She is spectacularly under-whelmed by her first sex with him and he is so self-absorbed that even the most feeble sounds of pleasure in movie history do not clue him in about her true feelings.Most of the interest (and humor) comes from checking out the subtle clues Gyllengall and Spader provide us about the changing status of their relationship, because a lot is happening between them that is not shown or even specified. The two have subtle little signals by which they step out of their roles, with subtle gestures they let each other (and the audience) know that they both know what they're doing. In this unique way we observe their growing recognition of the other's natures and needs; and eventually their realization that they are unlikely to ever find anyone else who so completely understands them.Then again, what do I know?

When she starts making typing errors, her boss punishes her: firstly with spanking, then by making her crawl on all fours with a letter in her mouth, and building up from there. Curiously, she enjoys the attention that she finds no-where else. Certainly not from her boy friend, who does not give her the excitement that her boss gives her; not from her alcoholic father, nor from her over-protective mother. The attention may be perverse, -and this is a very perverse film- but through it, she discovers her self-esteem and no longer feels the need to inflict wounds on her body. If the psychology passes muster or not, I can't honestly say, but it seems to make narrative sense.Without, I hope, giving too much away, this film has a happy ending, but this only adds to the film's perversity. An unusual film, but an interesting one. I suppose the moral of this film is that there is someone for everyone, or that love is found when desires are met.

I've read over fifty of the reviews, and there has been no mention of the source material.In any case, this movie is based (very loosely) on a short story by Mary Gaitskill, in a book published circa 1989 called ""Bad Behavior"".Gaitskill is a phenomenally gifted writer, and much more intelligent than the people who produced and directed this film.  I haven't read anywhere what her opinion of the movie is, but I'll tell you mine.Hollywood regularly takes the works of fiction writers and bastardizes them in order to make them more appealing to  audiences.  Usually this means juicing something up with more titillation.  In this case, they took a dark, Darwinistic look at office politics and sex and turned it into a sweetened, Mary Poppins-in-whips-and-chains postfeminist movie in the vein of ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Pretty Woman"", and ""Basic Instinct.""Look at it this way:  when an author describes a rather repugnant lawyer masturbating behind his secretary as ""making furious rodent-like sounds"" and ""spattering hot muck"", do you think she (the author) is sympathetic towards the character?They turned a seedy (pun intended) low-life lawyer into a matinee idol--James Spader, and made the secretary into an unawakened freethinker, when in the book she was a character with basically no sense of herself at all, and certainly no self esteem.Maggie Gyllenhaal (lately in the news for speaking her mind about 9-11) is superb in this movie, I'll grant you that.  She is a young actress on the rise.  But the rest of the cast, including Spader, give very forgettable performances.  The movie just isn't that well made, and when you see the director's interviews, you'll understand why.I would recommend that anyone intrigued by this movie investigate Mary Gaitskill's writing.  Besides ""Bad Behavior"", she wrote a novel called ""Two Girls, Fat and Thin""  which is an excellent dissection of the philosophy of Ayn Rand.

LOLDefinitely not what I expected.. it starts off rather dark and you don't know what to make of Maggie Gyllenhaal ""Lee"" character. I mean she gets out of the mental institution and is still cutting herself. Her home is dysfunctional and Mom is very protective of her (or scared that she will do something drastic to herself again) and her Father is kind of screwed up all on his own. James Spader is just what she needed, and he is just what she needed. :)James does a wonderful job as the tortured soul in this movie that has to fight himself, when he thinks there is something wrong with what they are doing. The hurt that Lee (Maggie) feels when she is rejected by Spader is so real and painful to see, that you at once realize this as more than just 2 injured people living out there non-traditional sexual desires.I won't go into the details regarding the plot since it's been done so many times in the reviews before me. I will just say that at the core of this movie is a Man that has some bizarre tendencies and a Woman that has her very real dysfunctional issues. Through their own way and communication they discover a healthy albeit strange Love for one another. It is a rather touching love story in the end... it's just the way they get to it that is rather............. interesting. I know you may read a lot of reviews on this movie that says it's very Sexual... It is but not over whelming... I mean I just saw {Sex and Lucia} and {Y Tu Mama Tambien} which both had a EXTREME amount of sexuality. This one (in my opinion) is more subtle than those two. I can tell you this for a fact you may find yourself coming away from this movie with a different understanding of S&M; or of the blurred line between the Dominator and the Sub.I only recommend it for those that can have a open mind about non-traditional Sex roles or for those that can appreciate a somewhat Twisted movie.Respectfully Reviewed",4,THIS ONE SHOULD READ...Open Minded Viewers Need only Apply!,1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,2040,"['saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'one', 'art-house', 'flix-that-my-boyfriend-has-dragged-me-to', 'what', 'thought', 'LOLDefinitely', 'not', 'what', 'expected..', 'rather', 'dark', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Lee', 'character', 'mean', 'mental', 'institution', 'still', 'cutting', 'home', 'dysfunctional', 'Mom', 'very', 'protective', 'scared', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'drastic', 'herself', 'again', 'Father', 'kind', 'screwed', 'up', 'own', 'James', 'Spader', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'James', 'wonderful', 'job', 'tortured', 'soul', 'movie', 'fight', 'when', 'something', 'wrong', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'hurt', 'Lee', 'Maggie', 'feels', 'when', 'rejected', 'Spader', 'so', 'real', 'painful', 'see', 'once', 'realize', 'more', 'just', '2', 'injured', 'people', 'living', 'there', 'non-traditional', 'sexual', 'desires.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'regarding', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'reviews', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'core', 'movie', 'Man', 'bizarre', 'tendencies', 'Woman', 'very', 'real', 'dysfunctional', 'issues', 'own', 'way', 'communication', 'discover', 'healthy', 'albeit', 'strange', 'Love', 'one', 'rather', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'end', 'just', 'way', 'get', 'rather', 'interesting', 'know', 'may', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'movie', 'very', 'Sexual', 'not', 'whelming', 'mean', 'just', 'saw', 'Sex', 'Lucia', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'had', 'EXTREME', 'amount', 'sexuality', 'one', 'opinion', 'more', 'subtle', 'two', 'can', 'tell', 'fact', 'may', 'find', 'coming', 'away', 'movie', 'different', 'understanding', 'S', 'M', 'blurred', 'line', 'Dominator', 'Sub.I', 'only', 'recommend', 'can', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'non-traditional', 'Sex', 'roles', 'can', 'appreciate', 'somewhat', 'Twisted', 'movie.Respectfully', 'Reviewed']",N/A

To a person they were neurotic.  Cutting one's self, for example, is not a healthy thing.  And the subject matter was all about sex and little more (anything new these days?).The Secretary implicitly presents itself as a psychological drama, yet that aspect of the film doesn't quite work. I never came to an understanding of what drove either of the primary characters in their obsessive-compulsive desires.  Yes, Lee, the main protagonist, has a troubled family, including an alcoholic father.  But that doesn't adequately explain her behaviour.  The other main person, E. Edward, has little known background; he's just, well, very obsessive and not all that consistent as a character.Nonetheless, the Secretary was visually well put together and the acting, especially by Maggie Gyllenhaal, was superb.  And if you can't get enough of sex in films, this one is rather titillating-although not in the usual way.If you really enjoy psychological drama with a sexual undercurrent, the 50's film ""Suddenly, Last Summer"" covers the ground very well.Secretary is not recommended for viewing with your grandmother or with pre-adult children.",4,Whap!,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,1661,"['When', 'see', 'film', 'such', 'Secretary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'impression', 'filmmakers', 'use', 'material', 'case', 'S', 'M', 'purpose', 'simply', 'selling', 'film', 'ongoing', 'race', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'most', 'bizarre', 'most', 'formerly', 'taboo', 'subject', 'table', 'order', 'will', 'be', 'talked', 'ultimately', 'will', 'sell-rather', 'purpose', 'shedding', 'light', 'unmentioned', 'appreciated', 'human', 'condition.It', 'was', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'relate', 'main', 'characters', 'person', 'were', 'neurotic', 'Cutting', 'one', 'self', 'example', 'not', 'healthy', 'thing', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'sex', 'little', 'more', 'anything', 'new', 'days', '.The', 'Secretary', 'implicitly', 'psychological', 'drama', 'aspect', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'never', 'came', 'understanding', 'what', 'drove', 'primary', 'characters', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'desires', 'Yes', 'Lee', 'main', 'protagonist', 'troubled', 'family', 'including', 'alcoholic', 'father', ""n't"", 'adequately', 'explain', 'behaviour', 'other', 'main', 'person', 'E.', 'Edward', 'little', 'known', 'background', 'just', 'well', 'very', 'obsessive', 'not', 'that', 'consistent', 'character.Nonetheless', 'Secretary', 'was', 'visually', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'acting', 'especially', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'was', 'superb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'sex', 'films', 'one', 'rather', 'titillating-although', 'not', 'usual', 'way.If', 'really', 'enjoy', 'psychological', 'drama', 'sexual', 'undercurrent', '50', 'film', 'Suddenly', 'Last', 'Summer', 'ground', 'very', 'well.Secretary', 'not', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'grandmother', 'pre-adult', 'children']",N/A

It is an extraordinary transformation, told in the form of comedy, and the viewer can believe it.The acting is wonderful.  Spader is at his absolute best:  creepy, with bizarre tastes to say the least, yet full of need in a way that is understandable and increasingly vital.  From a rigid obsessive type, he becomes a man in search of love, even if it involves ropes and a saddle.  This is also Gyllenhaal's first starring role and she is magnificent.  The supporting characters from her hapless boy toy to her alcoholic father and co-dependant mother are also excellent.As many have noted, this film had to tread an extremely fine line.  One the one hand, there is no question that the couple is perverted.  They indulge in pain, humiliation, and bondage.  On the other hand, though so wounded and inhibited, they forge a true relationship.  Their journey is moving, at times titillating, and even fascinating.Warmly recommended.

738830,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00008DDSA,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 7]","""Secretary"" is an odd little sadomasochistic fantasy in which a lawyer and his secretary establish a kind of master/slave relationship in the office.Lee Halloway is a deeply disturbed young woman who has just been released from a mental institution where she has been recuperating from a nervous breakdown.  Lee copes with her severely dysfunctional family - her father is an alcoholic who beats his wife, while her mother is a passive victim of abuse who overprotects her daughter - by cutting, gashing and burning herself regularly.  Now, back on the outside, Lee finds employment as secretary to a paralegal, E. Edward Grey, an equally neurotic man who turns out to be a full-blown ""dominator"" behind closed doors.  Together the two forge a bizarre sexual alliance so all-consuming in its nature that one wonders how this small office ever gets any work done at all.Writer Erin Cressida Wilson and director Steven Shainberg have fun with the many ironies and paradoxes inherent in the offbeat world they are exploring.  For instance, Grey, by restricting Lee's freedom of choice, is actually liberating her by getting her to channel her self-abusive tendencies and desire for pain into a ""healthier,"" more ""productive"" direction.  Lee also discovers that men with unconventional sexual tastes may be no more willing to ""settle down"" and ""commit"" with a likeminded partner than many a man with more traditional sexual proclivities.In many ways, ""Secretary"" turns out to be almost a recruiting poster for the sadomasochistic lifestyle.  The S&M; scenes are kept relatively tame in tone and the film displays a wickedly funny sense of humor for most of its duration.  Moreover, the decidedly upbeat ending of the film could easily have garnished any Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedy - had standards 40 years ago allowed them to explore this type of topic, that is.As Lee and Grey, Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader turn in terrific performances.  They manage to capture the quirky nature of their respective characters without ever making them appear off-putting or grotesque.  Their performances go a long way towards purging the material of the kind of sleaziness and smarminess one might expect to find here.The early scenes in the film may be a bit disturbing for some in the audience, mainly because we feel a bit like voyeurs ourselves peering in on the couple, almost as if they were zoo animals or subjects in some sort of psycho-sexual experiment.  But then, as we get to know the characters and come to like them, we become absorbed in their story and find ourselves actually cheering them on and wanting them to find some measure of meaning and happiness in their relationship and lives.The makers of ""Secretary"" have taken a potentially ""touchy"" subject and injected it with warmth, humanity and insight.  It's hard not to feel uplifted by this film.",3,quirky black comedy,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,2868,"['Secretary', 'odd', 'little', 'sadomasochistic', 'fantasy', 'lawyer', 'secretary', 'establish', 'kind', 'master/slave', 'relationship', 'office.Lee', 'Halloway', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'been', 'recuperating', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Lee', 'severely', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'father', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'wife', 'mother', 'passive', 'victim', 'abuse', 'who', 'daughter', 'cutting', 'gashing', 'burning', 'regularly', 'Now', 'back', 'outside', 'Lee', 'employment', 'secretary', 'paralegal', 'E.', 'Edward', 'Grey', 'equally', 'neurotic', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'full-blown', 'dominator', 'closed', 'doors', 'Together', 'two', 'forge', 'bizarre', 'sexual', 'alliance', 'so', 'all-consuming', 'nature', 'one', 'how', 'small', 'office', 'ever', 'work', 'done', 'all.Writer', 'Erin', 'Cressida', 'Wilson', 'director', 'Steven', 'Shainberg', 'have', 'fun', 'many', 'ironies', 'paradoxes', 'inherent', 'offbeat', 'world', 'are', 'exploring', 'instance', 'Grey', 'restricting', 'Lee', 'freedom', 'choice', 'actually', 'liberating', 'getting', 'channel', 'self-abusive', 'tendencies', 'desire', 'pain', 'healthier', 'more', 'productive', 'direction', 'Lee', 'also', 'men', 'unconventional', 'sexual', 'tastes', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'willing', 'settle', 'down', 'commit', 'likeminded', 'partner', 'many', 'man', 'more', 'traditional', 'sexual', 'proclivities.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Secretary', 'out', 'be', 'almost', 'recruiting', 'poster', 'sadomasochistic', 'lifestyle', 'S', 'M', 'scenes', 'are', 'kept', 'relatively', 'tame', 'tone', 'film', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'sense', 'humor', 'most', 'duration', 'Moreover', 'decidedly', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'garnished', 'Doris', 'Day-Rock', 'Hudson', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'had', 'standards', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'allowed', 'explore', 'type', 'topic', 'is.As', 'Lee', 'Grey', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'James', 'Spader', 'turn', 'terrific', 'performances', 'manage', 'capture', 'quirky', 'nature', 'respective', 'characters', 'ever', 'making', 'appear', 'off-putting', 'grotesque', 'performances', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'purging', 'material', 'kind', 'sleaziness', 'smarminess', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'find', 'here.The', 'early', 'scenes', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'audience', 'mainly', 'feel', 'bit', 'voyeurs', 'peering', 'couple', 'almost', 'were', 'zoo', 'animals', 'subjects', 'sort', 'psycho-sexual', 'experiment', 'then', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'come', 'like', 'become', 'absorbed', 'story', 'find', 'actually', 'cheering', 'wanting', 'find', 'measure', 'meaning', 'happiness', 'relationship', 'lives.The', 'makers', 'Secretary', 'have', 'taken', 'potentially', 'touchy', 'subject', 'injected', 'warmth', 'humanity', 'insight', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'uplifted', 'film']",N/A

The release of endorphans from the cutting pain, helps her feel better.Mr. Grey, the lawyer is truly a lost soul.

738832,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00008DDSA,Russell Fanelli,"[4, 5]","The Secretary alternately shocks and surprises us with its unusual subject matter and intense approach to its off-beat subject.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Lee Holloway, a young girl just released from a mental institution who is determined to get a job.  She notices a sign posted outside a lawyer's office for a secretary.  As she enters the office she watches the former holder of this job leaving in tears.  She then introduces herself to Mr. Grey, the lawyer, ably played by James Spader.  Mr. Grey's office is the first clue that something unusual is in store for her.  Rare flowers are beautifully showcased in an exotic setting.  Additionally, the lawyer appears to have a fetish for neatness.  He quickly removes from sight a row of carefully arranged markers.Lee gets the job and begins her initiation into a new world of strange and bizarre behavior.  Lee has a habit of punishing herself for real and imagined faults.  We watch her in the bathroom of her home cutting herself.  She has scars all over her body from past abuse.  She soon begins to cut herself in the office and is noticed by her boss.  At first he says nothing, but when she makes a variety of errors on the reports she is assigned to type, he yells at her and then takes sterner measures.  He tells her to come into his office and then demands that she lean over his desk and place her palms on the desk surface.  She complies and is spanked by the the lawyer.  She submits to this indignity and even seems to like it.  Lawyer and secretary enter into a relationship which allows each to satisfy their deep need to hurt and be hurt.The secretary falls in love with her boss and tells him so.  He is unable to respond to her affections and fires her.  Like Bartelby the Scrivener, she prefers not to be fired and visits him at his home and then takes up residence in the office.  She comes to the attention of the media who publicize her unusual actions. The relationship between lawyer and secretary improves and deepens when he observes her commitment to him.  The climax of the film is both unexpected and original, as is the entire movie.For those new to the sado/masochistic world, this film is disturbing, yet fascinating.  What motivates these people to act as they do?  The movie does not answer this perplexing question.  Instead, it allows us to draw our own conclusions as we watch each new development in the story.  For those willing to suspend the first inclination to judge the lawyer and secretary as just plain crazy, a deepening understanding of the variety of human experience reveals itself.  We observe the various ways these people respond to the pain they suffer in their lives.The limited spectrum of what we believe to be normal behavior is stretched considerably with each new development of the story.  I was reminded of The Piano Teacher, a much better film on this subject of sado/masochism that I reviewed some months ago.

To help steer herself towards sanity again, she takes a job as a secretary with lawyer E.

At first the work is pretty typical but then he begins reprimanding her for typing errors and the like. It starts out mild but it soon escalates to spankings. And Lee likes it. Her relationship with Gray awakens her and she becomes a new and stronger person. But there's trouble in paradise when Gray begins to feel disgusted with himself. There's more but that will remain undisclosed. I'll start off by saying this film is definately not for everyone.

Here we have an impossibly slick and beautifully stylized love story on the edge and I'm glad to see that it's appreciated.Maggie Gyllenhaal (who I've only glimpsed in Donnie Darko and Adaptation) is stunning.  Lee's journey from darkness to light, through what may be seen by many as a dark avenue, is touching and earnest.  She learns to live and be comfortable in her own skin, as well as finding the strength to fight for what she wants rather than timidly taking the path others set for her.  She plays opposite James Spader (a gifted and beautiful actor) naturally and without a single hitch.  Their relationship grows and transforms both characters with utter grace and sensitivity.Possibly the most amazing thing about this film is the fact that it never becomes pretentious, preachy or even slightly over the top.  It is always honest, true to its characters and often comic, in spite of its rather taboo subject matter.Wonderful as the movie is, watching it at home on DVD is not without some difficulty.

Then, a bit of reading pointed towards a plot based on maverick overtones of S&M; (disclaimer: not really my bag), which had me expecting a psychosexual serving of ""Working Girl"" (that Griffith humdinger from the 80s) with bondage thrown in for good measure.Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised to be proved mostly wrong on both accounts.As for the hackeneyed theme of female exploitation, the protagonist's initial willingness to acquiesce to her boss' punitive ministerings could have easily made her a victim of an employer/a man/a senior. Instead, this is quite convincingly shown to be her mode of entry into adulthood, allowing her to develop the inner resources to be a self-determined woman relentless in the pursuit of what and whom she wants.As for bondage, the depictions are not really bad at all (albeit occasionally guilty of needless nudity, imho) and in fact for better or for worse challenge our pre-conceived notions of sex. Anyone involved in a relationship knows that an essential ingredient is variable power balance -- it's inevitable, despite some people's claims that they have a completely equal affiliation. These power shifts help keep romance vibrant, most likely resulting in wisdom and self-acceptance. What men often confuse as strength -- stoicism, aloofness, obstinacy -- are, more often than not actually weaknesses leading to ignorance, avoidance and ultimate demise. Paradoxically, it's in hapless vulnerability that we actually discover what we're capable of, being able to develop emotional resilience and learning to express desire, sexual or otherwise. Gylenhaal's Lee Holloway embodies this weakness-as-power concept to the T, making an appealing case for growth by any means necessary.In a nutshell, a delicious, fast-paced, wonderfully filmed, off-beat romantic ""comedy"".

Initially it starts out as quite a sedate film with the boss being arrogant and rude, then he starts to humiliate her for minor work infractions, moving up to spanking, before their relationship takes a deeper turn. Much has been said about the sexual and deviant nature of this film and to be honest I have to say that is a lot of hype and over exaggeration. There is a sexual current running through the film, but it isn't anywhere near as deviant or shocking as some may make out. This film is more about one woman's development from a nave young adolescent, into a mature sexualised woman. Lee starts off by being unsure and shy and by the end of the film she is confident and sure of her feelings and wants out of life. This is slightly kooky and offbeat and Gyllenhaal turns out an excellent performance, managing to be by turns funny and kooky, sweet and innocent and sexy and self assured.

738852,A6R8XUE6MJLMC,B00008DDSA,Stuart Winer,"[6, 6]","I read these reviews as opinion pieces on films to get a wider perspective.  I could write the whole standard newspaper-style article but that's not really the meat of what I want to talk about, so please excuse me if I skip to the chase here.This movie is about sex, but it's also about repression and shame for having deviant thoughts. These people are interesting not because of the sex (although it was lovingly, beautifully depicted in kinky glory), but because they've broken through and discovered their true selves, and put their shame aside.They've made a hedonist's journey - from being small and ashamed about the body, to enjoying it fully.  I thought it was beautiful - because I think the body's needs are the expression of the true self, and we constantly put up mysterious psychological barriers against them.First off, what is shame, or modesty?  We form a mental 'box' around our sexuality - I'm not sure why. People don't go naked, even in warmer climates, I suppose because sex is not so distracting and we need a mental space in which to conduct more common social interaction - but that's not the same as shame..Spader's character was obviously very ashamed of his sexual deviance.  I don't understand this - my sense is that there's only shame if the behavior is harmful to oneself or others - otherwise it's either a curiousity of a person's neurological development, and is either wonderful or a waste of time.  In any case, shame is irrelevant.Even as I write this I know I couldn't live those words.  Shame, especially the sexual type, is hard-wired - just as much as the pecadillo that caused it.Here we see Spader break out of his 'shame spiral'(!) and open up, beautifully - into a relationship - kinky but real - instead of his previous forays, which I gather were more of the 'kinky and weird' variety.  His character was stunted and poorly socialized, probably for all sorts of reasons.  His character was forced to change - to heal and become whole.I thought it was very beautiful to see him open up and trust and allow Maggie into his life.  She forced his hand - and that's necessary - I felt it was beautiful that she cared enough to push him, hard, and take him out of his broken existence.As for Maggie, she was never really repressed or ashamed about sex - she was more of an invisible person on the periphery of others' lives.  Here we see her gain enormous power through this newfound Kink, and her love allows her to break through her follower-mentality and become a real person - with a will of her own.

Vandermyn ""Movie Lover""","[14, 16]","I suppose I may be impartial due to the fact that this may well be one of my favorite movies of all time, but there is so much beauty in this script, it's hard to refrain from telling everyone I know!  This is a movie that is definitely not for everyone but the first time I saw this, it left me wanting to watch it again.  Some people will watch this and say ""Wow"" while others will say ""What the hell did I just watch?""The movie begins with a fabulous performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal in her first starring role, as Lee, a troubled soul who finds comfort in self-mutilation, leaving a mental hospital.  After a stint for cutting too deep - ""I don't know how I could have misjudged, I've been doing it since the seventh grade..."" - she returns home to her dysfunctional family to try to begin life over again with the skills she has obtained from the institute.  Soon it seems, everything returns right back to the way it was - her father's out-of-control drinking, her parents fighting, her impulsively wanting to cut herself, but Peter enters and she finds some comfort in her high-school friend.Lee enters a class in college to learn to type and soon is an efficient enough typist to decide to apply for a job she found in the paper, secretary.  James Spader, as attorney E. Edward Grey, who is also fabulous in this movie, enters as the neurotic, offbeat attorney.  From the beginning we find that Mr. Grey has his faults - ever wonder why there is a permanent ""Secretary Wanted"" sign outside his office?Mr. Grey begins to get more and more ""strict"" it would seem with Lee, commonly using humiliation as a way to intimidate Lee.  One day Mr. Grey sits Lee down and asks her about the cutting - he has several times noticed signs of such.  He has a wonderful heart-to-heart with Lee and it is apparent that something between the two of them click as he tells her she will never cut herself again, have her mother pick her up from work and he lets her leave for the day, telling her to walk home through the park because she ""requires relief.""  Lee feels something inside of her and Mr. Grey growing and she senses a form of freedom deep inside herself because her gave her ""permission"" to do so.  But the next day, he is back to humiliating her, which ultimately leads to spankings and a world of sadism and masochism.The beautiful part of the film finds Lee slowly coming out of her shell and finding more confidence in who and what she is.  Mr. Grey brings something out in her that she was not aware she had.  Slowly, she finds herself attracted to Mr. Grey and his faults, while Mr. Grey finds that although Lee brings out something in him, he is too conflicted to understand himself.  He too cares for Lee, who helps him fulfill his needs, yet he feels disgusted because of what he does.Then the day comes along in which Mr. Grey decides he cannot continue to live like this - he feels that if Lee does not go, he will not be able to stop engaging in the activity that he, as employer and Lee, as employee, partake.  The movie climaxes here and finds two souls lost until they found each other, broken apart.  What happens to them?  What happens to Peter?  I'm not going to divulge any more of this movie as I'm sure I have gone on enough, but trust me when I say that this is a must-see movie.  You may not like it, or you might, but just watch it.

There are a few amusing moments until you realize that, all of the jokes in this movie are actually the same joke being played over and over. But once the punchline is dropped (and believe me they try to squeeze as much as they can out of it) there is nowhere for this movie to go.

738858,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B00008DDSA,The JuRK,"[4, 4]","When I think of erotic movies, I usually remember overstylized and heavy handed music video versions of movies that have little-to-no-understanding of how each particular lifestyle works.  The characters never feel like real people and their ""exploration"" into the kinky side of their sex lives comes across fake poses and clueless renderings--usually with bright lights and really loud music.  Since it's Hollywood, there has to be moment of ""self-discovery"" and/or ""hitting bottom"" before true, normal love prevails.  And they lived happily ever after.I remember reading about Stanley Kubrick's research for his orgy scenes in his final film, EYES WIDE SHUT.  After studying Roman orgies and such, he wasn't sure how to write the scenes where Tom Cruise infiltrates a high society orgy.  How does such things really work?  The only thing that made that scene work were the masks.  The quasi-religious ritual of pairing up partners...not so much.But then along comes SECRETARY.  And it works because it doesn't focus on the wild and kinky side of sex, but because it allows the kinks to come out of Real Characters.  Maybe that's why there are so few successful films about this (or any other) alternative lifestyle: the filmmakers are too fascinated by the acts than by the characters acting them out.In the extras, the director said he wanted to make a film about a successful S & M relationship the way that the earlier film MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE did for a gay relationship.  Mission accomplished.The only reason I'm not giving this film 5 stars is that I couldn't track James Spader's character development as easily as I could Maggie Gyllenhaal's.  She is a genuine character who fully communicates everything visually and verbally and I was able to follow her.  Great actress, great part.  Spader was a little less defined.  As Maggie's character accepts and achieves her identity, I was wondering if Spader was as sure of his own sexual identity as the movie played out.Knowing people in this particular lifestyle, I have to try and ascertain from where this particular bent comes from--and how it expresses itself.  Yes, it's different, but I know people who love this style of relationship and see it as another avenue of pleasure, not some sick, twisted acting out of dark, crazy mental/emotional ailment.

This movie deals with a particular aspect of sexuality in a refreshingly honest way. Whether you know anything about dominance/submission or not, this film is remarkable in that it gives us all a glimpse of what that particular sexual dynamic is all about, and it does it in a way that is quite frankly, non-sensational and non-gratuitous. And you do not need to have any affinity with dominance or submission to really 'get' and enjoy this movie, for it goes much deeper. This is a excellent character study.The film is quite erotic, although very little actual sex is shown. It's power is in the anticipation and what is NOT said. It's about NEED. As several other reviewers have brought out here, there's alot going on here besides the allure of a taboo form of sex. The beauty of the film is in it's subtlety and the depth of the characters, which the director takes time to develop.Both James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are compatible complements in this story, which really is a story about 'complements'. It's about finding that balance in the energy between two people. There is a silent, powerful unspoken attraction between the two characters that transcends their established professional roles. The viewer can really just 'sense' this dynamic building throughout the film.There is so much here that is communicated just with the look in the eyes. There is so much that is unspoken, yet if you pay attention, you know what is going on. I think it's great film-making. In an age when we are innundated with quick, flash images every other second, sensational sex and violence for it's own sake, and a total LACK of character development, I find it refreshing to see a movie like this that moves slowly on purpose to develop the phyche of the characters, and Secretary does that superbly.I also find it refreshing that a film be made about this rather taboo subject with an non-judgmental, open honesty. After all, in the end, its a LOVE story. A story of fufilled and satified needs on both ends of the equation. And really, isn't that what any successful relationship is really about?

738863,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008DDSA,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 10]","Based on Mary Gaitskill's stort story collected in ""Bad Behavior,"" ""Secretary"" follows a very, very strange kind of love story between a young girl Lee Holloway and a middle-aged lawyer E. Edward Grey who employs her as, yes, a secretary.  Lee is played by splendid Maggie Gyllenhaal (Jake's sister), and Edward by James Spader, who is simply great.  You also see Jeremy Davis and Lesley Ann Warren, but their roles are not as big as the two leads.The story is simple; it revolves around the said two characters, and the unexpected romance between them.  I said 'romance,' but it is a kind of romance you find in cult-film directors like David Lynch (whose influence is too obviously felt here, and the music here is by Angelo Badalamenti).  Kinky, you might say, and you are right.Lee, who has a habit of cutting her body, decides to work as a secretary when she finds a vacancy in Edward's office.  But the job meeting with Edward is far from normal.  I won't write it for it is probably the kind of the question many people think most indecent, and sexually harrassing.But Lee takes the job, and surprisingly, gradually gets a better secretary under the very 'unique' guidance of Edward, who tells her the 'right' way of doing the jobs.  But when their mutual feelings comes closer to love, teacher/student relation also comes close to ""Bad Behavior,"" or very sadomasochistic love relation between them.You may think, if you read this, the film is repulsive.  Surely, to some, it may be.  As I said, films like David Lynch or Pedro Almodobar can be the touchtone.  If you love them, try it.  If you prefer old-fashioned way of exressing love (which I do not dislike either), you may be shocked to see it.James Spader is always at his best when he portrays this kind of a character with intelligence and repressed desire, as you saw in ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape.""  He is as good as that, but more astonishing is the newcomer Maggie Gyllenhaal, who succeeds in displaying the natural transformation of a girl -- a girl to a woman.  No one can deny her enormous talent without which the film could be very simplistic exploitation of sexual desire.However, the fact is, it is not.  And the two main characters are realized with compassionate touch of the director.

738865,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00008DDSA,wellwellwell,"[4, 5]","Every once in a while a movie pops up that appears to be... well, a little bit out there. And 'Secretary' is definitely one of those movies. In fact, it's way, way out there. I'd be willing to bet there's a number of other movies like this that are readily available, but probably weren't as publicly observed as this one. I first took note of 'Secretary' when I saw the trailer for it on TV; though I opted to wait a while to rent it. It was certainly worth my time. The duo of Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader is probably the best interaction between two characters in a film I've ever seen. It's been said time and time again how well they light up the screen with their united acting abilities. Let it be known, it is no fluke. Don't be put off by the movie's apparent sexual prowess and provocative demeanor. When it's all said and done the movie becomes more of a romance than the sadomasochistic stomach-aggravator others make it out to be. It's an exceptionally good movie with watertight performances by Gyllenhaal and especially James Spader (a veteran at roles such as this; i.e. 'Sex, Lies, And Videotape').People like to start by informing [you] that we first see Lee Holloway (Gyllenhaal) being released from a mental hospital. What they forgot to mention is that the very first scene shows Lee walking around a creepy, musty-looking office with a pole handcuffed over her shoulder and to her hands. THEN (six months earlier) we see Lee being released from a mental hospital. After that shocking opening scene the movie is rather straightforward; letting us know through thoughts and actions that Lee's family is the epitome of a dysfunctional family. A drunk father and an overly-protective, abused mother show us just why Lee has a problem with hurting herself. But as society and Lee would like to think, the whole mental hospital thing helped her. When she is debating whether or not to throw out her intriguingly hidden case filled with knives, needles, and ballet dancer dolls, Lee stumbles upon an ad in a paper for a secretary. We then see her crack a timely smile when typing a letter during a session of a typewriting class. So she heads to this office, wanders her way into its lobby and into a room in which E. Edward Grey (Spader) sits, starring complacently into the void. From the start, Edward is a vague and seemingly sinister man. He asks Lee a number of odd questions--that produce some puzzled responses--that you wouldn't normally hear on an interview, and hires her on the spot. Both characters seem to leer and look at one another in a way that is as bizarre as it is comfortable. In other words, it's very obvious they ""like"" each other. The work Lee does is tedious (""very dull"", as Edward remarks); just typing and copying letters and whatnot. So tedious that it allows for Edward to watch over her every move. Like a perverted hawk he studies her movements and yells at her to fix her spelling mistakes. He pushes her, and she just keeps pushing back. Scene after scene you can feel Spader's character falling in love with Lee more and more. But it's not the kind of love you typically see; there's no kissing, no flirting, and hardly any talking. Just a lot of expressions. If you're not paying attention in the same manner Edward watches over Lee, you'll miss everything and the movie will go right over your head. You know all about the spanking that eventually occurs, I'm sure, but I'm glad to see no one made note of how that cultivates. That part is particularly amiable (choice word). From there it is a struggle for Lee to find common ground with Edward, as she feels so close to him that she can't take it (watching her try to smack herself in the butt with a hairbrush was one of the few comical bits of the movie). But Spader's temperament does not allow for him to give in that easily. He has a meticulously flawless plan for choosing ""the one""; a plan that was clearly used on other commendable women before Lee. And after her, if she chooses to be non-submissive (the scheme she fails to understand). As a consequence, that is the whole point of the movie.Again, 'Secretary' is not that strange of a movie when it's all said and done. It's just the endless actions and scenes that lead up to the climax that make it so different. It's amazing to see how well James Spader handles the role and how alluring Edward becomes over time. I don't like to question Oscar nominations and whatnot, but can honestly say his performance here is one of the greatest I have ever seen in a movie. Trust me, it's that good. And Maggie's disposition (believe it or not, she's a first-timer), although she's the main character, only compliments Spader and his stellar acting. It's so fun to see love being portrayed in such oddity. And it's even better to see how that altered love can heal a person. This movie is almost flawless, and the only part I didn't find fitting was during the ending (which I won't spoil). Watch 'Secretary' if what I have said intrigued you or made you keep reading till this point. By now you know what kind of person you are, and if you're this type of person (or at least can pretend to be), I highly recommend this.

738868,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00008DDSA,Wheelchair Assassin,"[20, 23]","&quot;Secretary&quot; is not your mother's movie about a compulsively self-mutilating woman who enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with her overbearing lawyer boss.  It's a twisted tale of two people with some serious hangups, who somehow manage to find a connection in the midst of some kinky activities at work.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the titular self-mutilator, Lee, who upon her release from an institution takes a job as a secretary for the stern E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  She clearly has a submissive personality, which Edward seizes upon to exercise his own dominant tendencies.  At first he just yells at her when she messes up, but pretty soon she's wearing a saddle and being spanked for making typos.  It's pretty therapeutic for both of them, and the S &amp; M activities clearly give Lee and Edward some sort of symbiotic relationship where both can work out their control issues.  One could even say it constitutes love, which is an idea that the second half of the movie addresses.  It's interesting to watch the way the dynamics of Lee and Edward's relationship develop, but what really makes the movie is the brilliant acting and director Steven Shainberg's keen eye for detail.  The whole movie is full of little subleties that had me laughing at the inspired absurdity of it all, and Spader and Gyllenhaal can convey more with a single expression than some actors can in an entire monologue.  If you're not amused at the scene where Edward gets turned on watching Lee root through a dumpster, then you'd better check your pulse.  The film's bizarre sense of humor is often reminiscent of my all-time favorite TV show, &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; but a lot dirtier.

The imagery and symbolism is fantastic (I'll never look at a red Sharpie the same way again).The only realy downfall to this movie is that the ending isn't really very intense.  They could have cut the ending of the movie off just after the lawyer makes his ""I'm rather fond of you as well"" statement, and it would have been perfect.
