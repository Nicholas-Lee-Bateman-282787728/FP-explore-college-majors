1014500,A2EVXI7A6ECPJU,B000HEWES0,"Analog ""Evil_Spud_Boy""","[1, 1]","I got hooked on MXC a few years ago when I accidentally discovered itwhile channel surfing.  Normally I avoid Spike TV like the plague, but I make an exception for MXC.  This show is the best!  I don't exactly know what's so hilarious about watching people pummel themselves into walls and get pelted with volleyballs shot out of a cannon, but it sure is entertaining. The commentary is really where it's at, though.  There are so many sexual jokes and double entandre's made during the show that you almost have to watch each episode a few times to catch them all.  For those of you not familiar with MXC, it's a take off of a Japanese game  show called Takeshi's Castle, where contestants compete in outrageous and sometimes dangerous games, and face elimination until only a few remain for the final battle. What's really cool about the box set is that there is a whole episode of Takeshi's Castle included, with English subtitles.  I had never seen the actual show before, and now that I've seen one, I'd like to see the rest of them.  The real episode is almost as entertaining as MXC.  Like a previous reviewer said, there is a lot of show cut from the original, which lasts over an hour.  They should have made the MXC episodes last at least an hour.  By the time you factor in commercials, you get about 20 minutes of actual show.  It's still really funny, but when you see just how much more material each episode could offer, it could be a lot better of a show.  My favorite skit on the whole DVD is probably Elimination Idol, starring Simon Bowel and a few contestants who sing some quite hilarious songs.  Like I said, having the DVD is great because you really do miss a lot of the jokes and puns if you only watch the episodes once.  Hopefully season two will have a couple episodes of Takeshi's Castle, I'd really like to see some more of that show.",5,I'd like to see more of Takeshi's Castle,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1864,"['got', 'hooked', 'MXC', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'accidentally', 'discovered', 'itwhile', 'channel', 'surfing', 'Normally', 'avoid', 'Spike', 'TV', 'plague', 'make', 'exception', 'MXC', 'show', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'what', 'so', 'hilarious', 'watching', 'people', 'pummel', 'walls', 'get', 'pelted', 'volleyballs', 'shot', 'cannon', 'sure', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'really', 'where', 'though', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'double', 'entandre', 'made', 'show', 'almost', 'have', 'watch', 'episode', 'few', 'times', 'catch', 'not', 'familiar', 'MXC', 'take', 'off', 'Japanese', 'game', 'show', 'called', 'Takeshi', 'Castle', 'where', 'contestants', 'compete', 'outrageous', 'sometimes', 'dangerous', 'games', 'face', 'elimination', 'only', 'few', 'remain', 'final', 'battle', 'What', 'really', 'cool', 'box', 'set', 'whole', 'episode', 'Takeshi', 'Castle', 'included', 'English', 'subtitles', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'actual', 'show', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'rest', 'real', 'episode', 'almost', 'as', 'entertaining', 'MXC', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'lot', 'show', 'cut', 'original', 'hour', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'MXC', 'episodes', 'last', 'least', 'hour', 'time', 'factor', 'commercials', 'get', '20', 'minutes', 'actual', 'show', 'still', 'really', 'funny', 'when', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'material', 'episode', 'could', 'offer', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'show', 'favorite', 'skit', 'whole', 'DVD', 'probably', 'Elimination', 'Idol', 'starring', 'Simon', 'Bowel', 'few', 'contestants', 'who', 'sing', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'songs', 'said', 'having', 'DVD', 'great', 'really', 'do', 'miss', 'lot', 'jokes', 'puns', 'only', 'watch', 'episodes', 'once', 'Hopefully', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'have', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Takeshi', 'Castle', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'show']",MXC - Most Extreme Elimination Challenge Season One

Take a forgein TV show, completely redub the lines into something hilarious and make the shows format and change it enough so that it is wacky.  Maybe thats not a great way of describing the show but it'l have to do.  MXC has some of the most clever dialouge you will hear (short of ""right you are Ken"") coupled with what in Japan I can only assume is a serious sportsminded show.  The contestants in the show take some nasty bumps that would make professional wrestlers wince and IT'S HILARIOUS.  You'll have to watch each episode twice, one to catch the injuries and another to hear the commentary of the hosts.  When you have characters described as working for ""Happy Jihad one way truck rentals"" or remarking that illeagal cock fighting and bathroom swordplay are not one in the same, it's even funnier.I hope theres an option for cycling through episodes or a ""play all"" I can't catch this show on Spike anymore and still love it.

And no show has ""executed"" so many jokes in such a short span as ""MXC"".Take a popular game show in Japan from the 80's, sharpen up the editing, change the format of the show, cut out all the audio and replace it with hilarious commentary and you've got what must've been a real surprise to the then-new Spike TV. Once the rest of the line-up like ""Gary the Rat"" and ""Stripperella"" bombed, this show became a nightly staple.The DVD is from the first season consisting of 13 episodes. Including the memorable ""college girls"" edition and the episode in which a guy nearly breaks his neck doing a bad backflip.What holds the show together is the rapid fire commentary of ""Vic Romano"" and ""Kenny Blankenship"" who's chemestry is apparent right from the beginning. The voice-over guys portraying them are obviously having a ball along with the one playing ""Guy Le Douche"" and ""Captain Tenneal"".  Mary Sheer is lucky enough to play ""Everygirl"" aka all the voices of the girls on the show.This is one funny show and certainly deserving of a DVD presentation.  The only quibble I have is with the somewhat high price, but it's only minor.Extras:- A complete episode of ""Takashi's Castle"" is included.  What's immediately apparent is how slow-paced the program is.- Kenny's 25 ""Most Painful Eliminations of the Season"" is surprisingly underproduced. There are no titles or even Kenny providing commentary.- There is commentary on a few episodes. They contain some enlightening information on just how quickly the the first season had to be produced.- A ten minute version used to sell the show to Spike.

I agree with every one of these reviewers here.  This is, without a doubt, the funniest show on television.  The crazy stunts combined with the witty locker room humor combine to make MXC funnier than any show I've ever seen, and that's not an exaggeration.  If you haven't seen an episode of MXC yet, do yourself a favor.  Buy this DVD and prepare to laugh yourself right off the couch.

I wasn't sure what the heck was going on at first until I realized it was some sort of satire using the old video footage as a backdrop.  From then on I was completely hooked.  I do agree with another reviewer though who said that the shows get a little old after you've seen them 3-4 times, since you know what's coming and you've already heard the joke that goes with it.  I'm still buying the DVD though so I can pull it out every so often once I've had enough time to forget what's coming next, so it will be funny once again.  Hopefully the rest of the shows will come to DVD soon.

1014520,A3VRFC5A5CJ3UX,B000HEWES0,W. Roe,"[1, 1]","Absolutly one of the most hilarious shows ever, much of it based on double entendre toilet jokes (""Extreme Elimination"", ""Log Drop"", ""Sinkers and Floaters"" etc) but it ingeniously pokes fun at many contemporary subjects. It is seldom seen on Spike anymore so I purchased all of the DVDs. Creative and superbly written and edited, the whacky visuals and clever dialoge are so fast paced and funny that it is easy to miss much of the wit! Replay value is very high. A great deal of the dubbed humor fits so well into these bizarre games that I can almost imagine that Takeshi's Castle was created for the MXC writers! Like Woody Allens ""Whats Up Tiger Lilly"", MXC has nothing to do with the Japanese original.
