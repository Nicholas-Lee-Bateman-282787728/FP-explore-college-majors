781396,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0000E660D,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Little House on the Prairie - Seasons 1-3The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience.These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was the highest rated series during most of its nine years.

Reyes,"[6, 7]","I didn't think that the quality of the dvds was as bad as some of the reviewers are saying granted it wasn't great but I'm sure some of the problems just weren't able to be fixed.  I am glad that I will finally be able to own every episode on dvd so that when I have kids they can enjoy it too.  Buying it this way was also cheaper than buying them individually by like 40 bucks so it is money well spent if you like the show.  I can't wait for all the seasons to come out the next one is season 7 which comes out on February 15, 2005.

Not that we are experts, but none of us have noticed any problems with the cinematography as previously mentioned.  It is great to see the example of a family that is NOT disfunctional -- it is something we need more of.  I find these shows vastly superior to the majority of shows currently on TV and I highly recommend them.",5,Great family entertainment!!!,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,419,"['family', 'shows', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'three', 'season', 'are', 'watching', 'season', '4', 'Not', 'are', 'experts', 'none', 'have', 'noticed', 'problems', 'cinematography', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'great', 'see', 'example', 'family', 'NOT', 'disfunctional', 'something', 'need', 'more', 'find', 'shows', 'vastly', 'superior', 'majority', 'shows', 'currently', 'TV', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

It stinks!  Many of the episodes are bleached (color-wise) and blurred.  Looks like they confiscated some used video-tapes and did a transfer using a consumer-end VCR with no digital enhancement other than adding chapters (one thing that was nicer than Seasons 1 & 2).  And even the transition on some chapters is noticeablely chopped (almost like some one stopped the playback while still recording).  My guess is that the studio's greed set in and they decided to accelerate the production timeline for Season 3 and get these out on the market at the sacrifice of quality so they bring in those $$$ faster.  For such a wonderful series as this is, it is a crying shame to see such a low quality transfer to DVD as Season 3 is.  I purchased Seasons 4 & 5 which I have not yet viewed.  Hopefully they are not as pitiful quality as Season 3.",1,Season 3 Digital Transfer Quality Stinks!,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,973,"['What', 'was', 'studio', 'thinking', 'digital', 'transfer', 'quality', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'good', 'overall', 'However', 'Season', '3', 'story', 'stinks', 'Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'bleached', 'color-wise', 'blurred', 'Looks', 'confiscated', 'used', 'video-tapes', 'did', 'transfer', 'using', 'consumer-end', 'VCR', 'digital', 'enhancement', 'other', 'adding', 'chapters', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'nicer', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'even', 'transition', 'chapters', 'noticeablely', 'chopped', 'almost', 'one', 'stopped', 'playback', 'still', 'recording', 'guess', 'studio', 'greed', 'set', 'decided', 'accelerate', 'production', 'timeline', 'Season', '3', 'get', 'market', 'sacrifice', 'quality', 'bring', 'faster', 'such', 'wonderful', 'series', 'crying', 'shame', 'see', 'such', 'low', 'quality', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'Season', '3', 'purchased', 'Seasons', '4', '5', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'viewed', 'Hopefully', 'are', 'not', 'pitiful', 'quality', 'Season', '3']",N/A

In fact, we've bought every season that has been released and I've even started reading the books.My one complaint isn't with the series itself but with the DVD transfer, which is awful. Yes, the picture quality is mediocre, but what's really problematic is the audio. I noticed that another previous reviewer wrote that he'd like closed captioning on this because he's deaf. Well, sir (or madame), if it's any consolation to you, the rest of us aren't able to understand much more of what's said than you are, and that only when the volume is cranked up loud enough to wake Laura Ingalls Wilder, who I understand is deceased and buried several states away.",4,"Great series, lousy DVD transfer",1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,803,"['show', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'wife', 'convinced', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'now', 'really', 'enjoy', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'season', 'been', 'released', ""'ve"", 'even', 'started', 'reading', 'books.My', 'one', 'complaint', ""n't"", 'series', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'awful', 'Yes', 'picture', 'quality', 'mediocre', 'what', 'really', 'problematic', 'audio', 'noticed', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'wrote', ""'d"", 'like', 'closed', 'captioning', 'deaf', 'Well', 'sir', 'madame', 'consolation', 'rest', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'understand', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'said', 'are', 'only', 'when', 'volume', 'cranked', 'up', 'loud', 'enough', 'wake', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'who', 'understand', 'deceased', 'buried', 'several', 'states', 'away']",N/A
