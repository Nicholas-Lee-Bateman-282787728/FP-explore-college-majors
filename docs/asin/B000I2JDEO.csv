1018920,APVNDUMOTRJ78,B000I2JDEO,E. Drake,"[2, 2]","The Oh in Ohio is the kind of movie you see for the stars as it was indeed saved by the cast. Paul Rudd is his down-to-earth-seeming self. Parker Posey is adorable. Within moments you too will believe her innocence in realizing her own sexual dysfunction. And DeVito is just a fantastic actor. Like Bill Murray, (and I don't mean to sound weird about this, but perhaps someone out there will get my meaning)I wish he were my father...sorry dad. To put it less creepily, I just wish he could be my friend.For what appears to be director Billy Kent's first movie, this flick is not bad. However, it just doesn't feel whole. Keith David, for instance plays Paul Rudd's friend/coworker at school. I felt his character just didn't have the impact the filmmaker was going for. To put it simply, his character just seemed underdeveloped.  In fact that's a good way to describe the feel of the whole movie: underdeveloped or premature. Economically speaking, the movie is not worth the $19.99.  I picked it up for 5 bucks as a pre-viewed Blockbuster movie. I am not unhappy with that choice, perhaps a used purchase may be the better choice for anyone interested.Aside from this, the movie does have some nice insightful discussions on the nature of a sexual relations (particularly when Rudd and Posey are at the Psychaiatrist/Relationship Helper Man). There is a genuinely airy feel to the movie which is good to know for people who need a pick-me-up from a gloomy week. For geography lover's, it was also nice to see a different city in the background.

First time director Billy Kent and writer Sarah Bird with assistance from Kent somehow managed to not only get producers to pay attention to their project but also attracted some good actors to try to pull it off. 'Money makes the world go around...'The plot is minimal: Parker Posey plays successful business woman Priscilla Chase who is known for her beauty, is married to a Biology teacher Jack Chase (Paul Rudd) who is on the skids from depression over the fact that his machismo is daily challenged by the fact the Priscilla has never had an orgasm.  This fact somehow demeans Jack who has always bragged about his triumphs in bed but his career and self-esteem are in a pit due to Priscilla's sexual dysfunction. Priscilla attends a sex therapy session for women hosted by none other than Liza Minnelli where she is encouraged to get to know her vagina. At the suggestion from Priscilla's friend Sherri (Miranda Bailey) concurrently with Jack's friend Coach Popovich (Keith David) and the counsel of a therapist, Priscilla buys a vibrator and the story from then on is how Priscilla's new-found satisfaction alters her life, pushes Jack into the arms of a student (Mischa Barton), and on and on with Priscilla finding outlets for her discovery with a sex toys salesgirl, a pool guy (Danny DeVito).  Everything about Priscilla and Jack is changed and for the rest of what's left of the standup comedy routine viewers will have to decide if they care to watch the DVD.About the only thing that pulls this together is Parker Posey, unafraid to take on a script that asks her to demean herself in the process. This is definitely one of those films to perhaps rent when the video store shelves are empty.

Subtitled one woman's story is about to climax. About Parker Posey's sexual dysfunction, it's both naughty and nice. Danny DeVito is hilarious....the section of the movie where there's a slide into the pool is a good analogy for the theme which is about the quest for not only the big O but also personal fulfillment.

Their life seems to be a comfortable except for the fact that their marriage is (ahem!) slightly disfunctional.  For a moment there I could understand husband's escapade in having relationship with his high school student in attempt to assert himself.  But I could not buy into a relationship between the wife (Parker Posey) and pool installer man played by Denny DeVito.  Before long I started to ask myself what is this movie really about?  Love story about the (modern) beauty and the beast?  Or did I miss something here?  As wife and husband realize that there is no reconciliation putting them togehter no matter how handsome they look together, we see a new liberated modern woman simply enjoying her life in her goofy, superficial kind of way.

1018928,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000I2JDEO,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[5, 5]","""The Oh in Ohio"" is a self-assured slice of life that can touch viewers while disconcerting them all the while. Its comedic aspirations don't come to full fruition and its screenplay is a tad undercooked, but the actors overcome this with suave, easy charm.Poking sly, understated fun at the overemphasis of sex in society, it is neither for the prudish nor for those who need slapstick to find humor. Sex may be the centrifugal force of the film, but this is no ""40-Year Old Virgin,"" even though Paul Rudd plays similarly sympathetic characters in each.Priscilla Chase, played by Parker Posey, is an ambitious, ditzy woman on the fast track to large-scale corporate success. However, to the dismay of her schoolteacher husband Jack, played by Rudd, she is the consummate cold fish. She may know the exact number of times they've had sex, but she has never had a single orgasm - ever - due to a ""sexual dysfunction."" Nor does she seem interested in doing so soon.Things go up in smoke. She may have caused the problem, but Jack cannot get past the fact that the one woman he has not satisfied in bed is his wife of ten years. After moving to the garage and confiding in his friend and colleague Popovitch, played with cheeky delight by Keith David, he finally begins a full-fledged separation from Priscilla when she becomes overly addicted to a vaginal vibrator. He moves to the Manly Arms apartment complex - ""Why settle for the mundane when you can be the king of your domain?"" - and gives in to the advances of sophisticated 18-year old student Kristen, played perfectly by Mischa Barton, who lost her innocence long before he came along.Priscilla is thus left to find her sexual identity. She pursues sex with random men, but she finds it unsatisfying. Sex with sex shop clerk Justine, played by Heather Graham, doesn't do the trick either. Wayne the Pool Guy, played with zest and warmth by Danny DeVito, however, puts an entirely new spin on things, awakening ""parts of Cleveland"" she never knew existed. In Wayne she findsLiza Minelli is a hoot in her scene as an overzealous sex therapist, and Posey really brings it home when Jack finally gives Priscilla the satisfaction that was missing from their bedroom by merely calling her  cell phone during, of all moments, an important board meeting. It's where the phone specifically is, of course, that matters.""The Oh In Ohio"" is equal parts raunchy and touching as it cloaks its characters in genuine humanity.

1018929,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B000I2JDEO,Thomas M. Sipos,"[5, 25]","This is a review of the OH IN OHIO DVD, rather than the film itself.  It's also a warning.I first rented OH IN OHIO from Netflix.  The DVD kept skipping and stalling.  I couldn't watch it all.  I figured it was badly scratched.  So I bought a new DVD from Amazon.  It arrived looking pristine, still wrapped in celephone.  I even played it on a different DVD player.  Yet this DVD also SKIPPED AND STALLED!My DVD player was even RUMBLING and GROANING when it tried to play this new DVD.  And it's not the DVD player, because when I put in another DVD, it had no trouble.Seems OH IN OHIO went through some pretty shoddy DVD manufacturing ""quality control.""Why do SO MANY DVDs skip and stall?  And if DVDs are so fragile, why don't CDs and CD-ROMs have this problem?In the 1980s, VIDEO magazine published a theory that the studios were releasing poor quality VHS tapes because they didn't want consumers to build longterm libraries.  That makes sense.Remember, the studios never wanted to sell their movies, they only wanted to rent tapes to video stores.  It was a series of court cases in the 1970s/80s concerning antitrust, restraint of trade, and fair use in copyright (such as the Sony Betamax case) that barred the studios from restricting the trade of independent video stores.Yet the studios made a bundle when people built tape libraries. Another bundle now that people are replacing their fragile tapes with fragile DVDs.I can see why the studios don't want to manufacture decent quality DVDs, lest consumers have permanent movies floating around for decades. Studios earn nothing on the sale of used DVDs. Better for them to manufacture fragile DVDs that won't last, so consumers will more easily replace their scratchy DVDs when the next format comes along.I'm really tired of SO MANY DVDs skipping and stalling.  I wish there was more consumer outrage against these crappy studio practices.Based on what I could see of OH IN OHIO, Parkey Posey is pretty and delightful, although the film is fluffy and lightweight, unlike her darker 1990s comedies (i.e., HOUSE OF YES, CLOCKWATCHERS).My one star is no slam on Posey, nor even on the film.
