1538620,AOB5695UUUJ0,B007V9ED2E,"Anime Lover ""D""","[16, 21]","Kaoru looks like any other college student, except that he is the heir of one of Japans largest mercentile groups and engaged to Aoi, the daughter of another great group - before he ran away.  However that all changes when one day he helps a beautiful traditional japanese lady who is looking for her lost love - and when he learns that she is Aoi, his fiance that starts the story.  Then when Aoi's guardian Miss Miaybi come to collect her she finds them in a very interesting position.  After Aoi runs back, a compromise is offered they can stay in one of the unused properties Aoi family owns, provided they keep their relationship a secret.  However things get more complicated as more people join their group, Tina, Kaorus American friend (blonde, blue eyes and busty), Takeo (a professional housekeeper, though she is a klutz, she works hard and is VERY busty), Chica (Takeo younger cousin), Miayu (another friend of Kaoru from England though not living with them), and Usamee the ferret (trust me the episode he comes in is very enjoyable). With all the attention that surrounds the couple, can the two keep their secret safe and stay loyal to each other.This is a two season series, and a classic in its own right with romance, comedy, and a whole lot of misadventures i truly thought this series could have gone another series as it stopped around manga vol 9 out of 17 and brought it to its true end.  This is one of the few titles that the English dubs uses the Japanese honorifics (-sama, senpai, -chan, etc.)There is some light Ecchii moments, but nothing too adult.

1538621,ANQDMB1WUCEPK,B007V9ED2E,anothvortex,"[6, 6]","Warning: Please forgive any potential spoilers.Over my many years of Anime viewing, I have been exposed to numerous examples of the genre known as the Harem Anime. These shows have a very particular and predictable formula that results in wacky hi-jinks that can both amuse and exasperate the viewer. In my experience, it is not uncommon for such formulas to spawn entire fan clubs devoted to a particular pairing or decrying the primarily supported pairing which the author ALWAYS will emphasize by episode three at the latest. Therefore, they become guilty pleasure viewing or humorous caricatures that you stop expecting decent plot development rather early in their progression.Ai Yori Aoishi is a notable exception to that rule.The formula starts off very simply. A random college student is reunited with a childhood acquaintance Aoi who, due to a family arrangement he doesn't even properly remember, is his actual fianc&eacute;e. The situation is further complicated because he has left his family and refuses to return.  Due to a couple of days filled with wacky misunderstandings and accelerated bonding, he ends up agreeing to marry this cute girl that he realistically has only known for maybe three or four days, two of which he can remember clearly. Thus the stage is set for the standard development of their relationship that you know numerous other girls are going to attempt to shatter because of their own feelings.Except that does not really happen.Aoi DOES come off as a little creepy in the beginning with her obsessive knowledge of the male lead Kaoru. But, upon accepting the situation, Aoi's mother and personal guardian put several perfectly reasonable restrictions upon the couple. They're moved into a new home owned by her family, with an enforced separate sleeping area clause in place. Until Kaoru makes something of himself, the family cannot afford to have a scandal occur where their highborn daughter is involved with a self-stylized outcast. Therefore, they develop a cover story where Aoi is the landlord of the property and Kaoru is simply her boarder. Hence, with that setup, female friends of Kaoru from his past, school and other such sources see the setup and convince Aoi to allow them to stay as well.  Forced to maintain the cover story, she cannot help but agree to the requests.However, instead of becoming a source of division, the different cast members all begin to act as an extended family. Despite their varied feelings for the male character, which is common in the genre, they also like one another quite a bit. Oh, there are the various moments of temptation where it becomes clear that Kaoru might be swayed from his devotion to Aoi, but they are never intentional and are always stopped by both his morals and those of the girl involved in the situation. This interaction also slows down Aoi and Kaoru's relationship, allowing it to develop at a stronger and more realistic pace.The only downside that I can see is that a lot of the tension is lost in the transition from season one to season two. Like many anime, the second season is more about the clich&eacute;s and fan service than it is about the story. However, they manage to provide enough elements of interest to keep you watching right until the last episode.Honestly, if you are forced by any friend to watch a Harem Anime, either due to a lost bet or their desire to ""expand your horizons"" I would recommend you insist upon this title. I have yet to see a series in the genre that I have enjoyed this much and doubt that I will find anything to top it in terms of quality anytime soon.",5,A shockingly pleasant surprise!,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,3606,"['Warning', 'Please', 'forgive', 'potential', 'spoilers.Over', 'many', 'years', 'Anime', 'viewing', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'numerous', 'examples', 'genre', 'known', 'Harem', 'Anime', 'shows', 'have', 'very', 'particular', 'predictable', 'formula', 'results', 'wacky', 'hi-jinks', 'can', 'amuse', 'exasperate', 'viewer', 'experience', 'not', 'uncommon', 'such', 'formulas', 'spawn', 'entire', 'fan', 'clubs', 'devoted', 'particular', 'pairing', 'decrying', 'primarily', 'supported', 'pairing', 'author', 'ALWAYS', 'will', 'emphasize', 'episode', 'three', 'latest', 'Therefore', 'become', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'humorous', 'caricatures', 'stop', 'expecting', 'decent', 'plot', 'development', 'rather', 'early', 'progression.Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoishi', 'notable', 'exception', 'rule.The', 'formula', 'off', 'very', 'simply', 'random', 'college', 'student', 'reunited', 'childhood', 'acquaintance', 'Aoi', 'who', 'due', 'family', 'arrangement', ""n't"", 'even', 'properly', 'remember', 'actual', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'situation', 'further', 'complicated', 'left', 'family', 'return', 'Due', 'couple', 'days', 'filled', 'wacky', 'misunderstandings', 'accelerated', 'bonding', 'up', 'agreeing', 'marry', 'cute', 'girl', 'realistically', 'only', 'known', 'maybe', 'three', 'four', 'days', 'two', 'can', 'remember', 'clearly', 'Thus', 'stage', 'set', 'standard', 'development', 'relationship', 'know', 'numerous', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'going', 'attempt', 'shatter', 'own', 'feelings.Except', 'not', 'really', 'happen.Aoi', 'DOES', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'creepy', 'beginning', 'obsessive', 'knowledge', 'male', 'lead', 'Kaoru', 'accepting', 'situation', 'Aoi', 'mother', 'personal', 'guardian', 'put', 'several', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'restrictions', 'couple', ""'re"", 'moved', 'new', 'home', 'owned', 'family', 'enforced', 'separate', 'sleeping', 'area', 'clause', 'place', 'Kaoru', 'something', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'have', 'scandal', 'occur', 'where', 'highborn', 'daughter', 'involved', 'self-stylized', 'outcast', 'Therefore', 'develop', 'cover', 'story', 'where', 'Aoi', 'landlord', 'property', 'Kaoru', 'simply', 'boarder', 'Hence', 'setup', 'female', 'friends', 'Kaoru', 'past', 'school', 'other', 'such', 'sources', 'see', 'setup', 'convince', 'Aoi', 'allow', 'stay', 'as', 'well', 'Forced', 'maintain', 'cover', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'agree', 'requests.However', 'instead', 'becoming', 'source', 'division', 'different', 'cast', 'members', 'begin', 'act', 'extended', 'family', 'varied', 'feelings', 'male', 'character', 'common', 'genre', 'also', 'like', 'one', 'quite', 'bit', 'Oh', 'are', 'various', 'moments', 'temptation', 'where', 'clear', 'Kaoru', 'might', 'be', 'swayed', 'devotion', 'Aoi', 'are', 'never', 'intentional', 'are', 'always', 'stopped', 'morals', 'girl', 'involved', 'situation', 'interaction', 'also', 'down', 'Aoi', 'Kaoru', 'relationship', 'allowing', 'develop', 'stronger', 'more', 'realistic', 'pace.The', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'tension', 'lost', 'transition', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'many', 'anime', 'second', 'season', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fan', 'service', 'story', 'However', 'manage', 'provide', 'enough', 'elements', 'interest', 'keep', 'watching', 'right', 'last', 'episode.Honestly', 'are', 'forced', 'friend', 'watch', 'Harem', 'Anime', 'either', 'due', 'lost', 'bet', 'desire', 'expand', 'horizons', 'would', 'recommend', 'insist', 'title', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'series', 'genre', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'doubt', 'will', 'find', 'anything', 'top', 'terms', 'quality', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

The only down-side is that it ended!I loved every minute of this story; the characters are great, and develop well through the set (which is actually two series; Ai Yori Aoshi: (Season 1, effectively) and Ai Yori Aoshi: Enishi (Season 2)). It reminded me a little of Love Hina; many of the characters are almost exact counterparts to those in Love Hina, except that in this story, the heroine, Aoi, really loves the male lead, Kauru, and doesn't keep beating him up as in Love Hina, and he loves her, but for political and family reasons, they have to keep their feelings for one another secret from their friends. The characters are mostly lovable, and caring, if somewhat bonkers (especially American student Tina), and the story is gentle, and sometimes quite heartbreaking. By the way, the title translates to ""Bluer Than Indigo"", but this is never mentioned on the DVD's.

The foremost a lot of anime fans have to realize is that this isn't a action/sci-fi/horror anime but more of a reconnection of lost love between to young people and how that love has been found again after some years.  The series does play a little on the harem angle but nothing truly serious or tries to suggest that he's conflicted in his feelings for his true love, though he does have deep feelings of friendship for most of the young ladies that have entered into his life as well as a brief test of his feelings for the one woman he truly loves.  The series animation and soundtrack fit nicely together as the soundtrack is a soft melodic tempo which some of the more actions paced anime fans might or might not like.  The audio voice cast for both the subbed and dubbed did a superb job in their character roles.Some people might find it a little offensive on the personality of the main female character but you have to remember that while she feels some of these roles are the duty of a supportive Japanese wife she does not act like a submissive animal nor does the main male character treat her like a submissive person but someone he truly loves and cares for.  So for a great series worth your time here's a great one to check out...",5,An Enjoyable Heartfelt Romantic Series That Touches The Heart Of Any Anime Fan,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,1369,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'anime', 'series', 'Clannad', 'Kanon', 'then', 'series', 'very', 'nice', 'addition', 'anime', 'collection', 'foremost', 'lot', 'anime', 'fans', 'have', 'realize', ""n't"", 'action/sci-fi/horror', 'anime', 'more', 'reconnection', 'lost', 'love', 'young', 'people', 'how', 'love', 'been', 'found', 'again', 'years', 'series', 'play', 'little', 'harem', 'angle', 'nothing', 'truly', 'serious', 'tries', 'suggest', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'true', 'love', 'have', 'deep', 'feelings', 'friendship', 'most', 'young', 'ladies', 'have', 'entered', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'brief', 'test', 'feelings', 'one', 'woman', 'loves', 'series', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'fit', 'nicely', 'together', 'soundtrack', 'soft', 'melodic', 'tempo', 'more', 'actions', 'paced', 'anime', 'fans', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'audio', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'character', 'roles.Some', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'little', 'offensive', 'personality', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'have', 'remember', 'roles', 'are', 'duty', 'supportive', 'Japanese', 'wife', 'not', 'act', 'submissive', 'animal', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'treat', 'submissive', 'person', 'someone', 'loves', 'cares', 'So', 'great', 'series', 'time', 'here', 'great', 'one', 'check', 'out']",N/A

I related to every character in some way or form. This Anime has never left my heart and I always excited to watch it again and again time after time ! I never get bored of it, tired of it, or change my feelings about this anime. I always watched it online but finally decided that it's one I would like to have in my own possession so that I can someday share it with my future children. *Of course when they're older* Which brings me to warning parents that this anime does contain some scenes with nudity and some minor adult situations so it's not really an anime for small children to watch. But it's a great anime to watch as a couple. I promise you that this anime with strength bonds and forever engrave itself into your heart. Definitely recommend you watch this and buy it.",5,More Heart-warming Anime ... Ever !!
