As a viewer, you will be played with constantly througout the film up to the very end. Just when you think you have settled on a spectrum of feelings and opinions about the characterrs and the storyline, the next scene will vanquish your new pre-conceived, constantly changing notions.It was a shame that the film did not get bigger distribution, especially on the festival circut. The unfounded and short-sighted criticsm was that a movie should not be seen or made that puts ""gays in a bad light."" Rubbish! Gay people aren't a large group of apostles. This decision kept this movie from gaining the larger viewing audience and exposure it deserves for both the quality film it is and the talented actors who brought it to life.If you buy one DVD this year, I highly recommend ""The M.O. of M.I."" This is a film you will want to tell your friends about. The movie and everyone involved in its construction deserves the word of mouth to gain the recognition it merits! I eagarly look forward to Mr. Brown's next cinema effort.",5,"On a scale of 1-5, this one gets a 15.75!!",1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,1177,"['Bravo', 'Aaron', 'Brown', 'constructing', 'superior', 'screenplay', 'not', 'seen', 'most', 'predictable', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'plots', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'played', 'constantly', 'film', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'settled', 'spectrum', 'feelings', 'opinions', 'characterrs', 'storyline', 'next', 'scene', 'will', 'vanquish', 'new', 'pre-conceived', 'constantly', 'changing', 'notions.It', 'was', 'shame', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'bigger', 'distribution', 'especially', 'festival', 'circut', 'unfounded', 'short-sighted', 'criticsm', 'was', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'made', 'gays', 'bad', 'light', 'Rubbish', 'Gay', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'large', 'group', 'apostles', 'decision', 'kept', 'movie', 'gaining', 'larger', 'viewing', 'audience', 'exposure', 'quality', 'film', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', 'brought', 'life.If', 'buy', 'one', 'DVD', 'year', 'highly', 'recommend', 'M.O', 'M.I', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'tell', 'friends', 'movie', 'everyone', 'involved', 'construction', 'word', 'mouth', 'gain', 'recognition', 'eagarly', 'look', 'forward', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'next', 'cinema', 'effort']",The M.O. of M.I.

I thought the premise sounded intruiging so I rented it, and am thankful I had not bought it.The movie started out with promise, but quickly I found myself thinking no couple would endure what is going on.  AND when the movie took a right turn (I am trying not to be a spoiler here), I found the actions being taken completely unbelievable and the ending was a total shocker (and not in a good way).Sadly, I wanted to like this film.  It does have some good things going for it, but in the end, I cannot recommend this movie.",1,This movie is a train wreck!,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,631,"['was', 'dismayed', 'way', 'movie', 'lurched', 'unpredictable', 'incredibly', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'thought', 'premise', 'sounded', 'intruiging', 'so', 'rented', 'am', 'thankful', 'had', 'not', 'bought', 'it.The', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'promise', 'quickly', 'found', 'thinking', 'couple', 'would', 'endure', 'what', 'going', 'when', 'movie', 'took', 'right', 'turn', 'am', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'spoiler', 'here', 'found', 'actions', 'being', 'taken', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'ending', 'was', 'total', 'shocker', 'not', 'good', 'way', '.Sadly', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie']",The M.O. of M.I.

Yes, this was hailed a ""Gayer Death Trap"" but I hardly saw anything that was as thrilling or suspenseful as that movie was. Maybe it was so ""hailed"" because of all the implied sex with hints of nudity, but I'm not hailing any part of it. The actors were good looking but their acting was devoid of any real emotion or charisma.What a waste of time.
