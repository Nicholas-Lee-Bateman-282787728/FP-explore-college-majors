The stand up show consists of 4 comedians: Dean, Ahmed, Aron, & Maz. My favorite by far is Aron and Dead follows. I'm of Palestinian decent so it's great to see Arab comedians especially Palestinians try to promote stand up in the Arab world. Anyway, after watching it sooo many times I figured I'd support them and own it.",5,You tired? You want Estar-backs?

So it was all good fun, but nothing really edgy or insightful.Airport security was prime target for most if not all of them, but most comics, even the non-middle-eastern ones had also poked fun at that. So they offered little in terms of fresh perspectives.It's nice enough for a light-hearted evening, but not a keeper for me.",3,Not a keeper,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,618,"['When', 'can', 'start', 'laugh', 'evil', 'healing', 'can', 'begin.While', 'were', 'funny', 'bits', 'chuckles', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', '4', 'comics', 'had', 'successfully', 'drawn', 'world', 'shared', 'how', 'had', 'overcome', 'evil', 'such', 'discrimination', 'stereotyping', 'laughter', 'was', 'good', 'fun', 'nothing', 'really', 'edgy', 'insightful.Airport', 'security', 'was', 'prime', 'target', 'most', 'not', 'most', 'comics', 'even', 'non-middle-eastern', 'ones', 'had', 'also', 'poked', 'fun', 'offered', 'little', 'terms', 'fresh', 'perspectives.It', 'nice', 'enough', 'light-hearted', 'evening', 'not', 'keeper']",The Axis of Evil Comedy Tour

The Axis team brought a new perspective on being a part of middle-eastern heritage and the effects of post 9/11.  Although the quad team touched on certain sensitive issues on eating pork, national security, Jews - it was done with a dosage just enough to let a sensible and logical person understand the challenges we face in today's society (with the flavor of humor).  Among the quad team, in my opinion, Maz Jobrani and Dean Obeidallah are the cream-of-the-crop in the team.  Especially Maz, he is totally hilarious.  Although Ahmed and Aron are funny on their part, the delivery method or Maz and Dean are outstanding, fresh and at the same time provoking.  This DVD will definately be in my permanant collection.  This is money well-spent and entertainment worth watching (and listening to).  2-thumbs up + 2-big toes up!!!",5,AXIS of Pure Reality Laughter,1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,952,"['Blue', 'Collar', 'team', 'was', 'challenge', 'find', 'team', 'could', 'bring', 'laughter', 'everyday', 'facts', 'life', 'Axis', 'team', 'brought', 'new', 'perspective', 'being', 'part', 'middle-eastern', 'heritage', 'effects', 'post', '9/11', 'quad', 'team', 'touched', 'certain', 'sensitive', 'issues', 'eating', 'pork', 'national', 'security', 'Jews', 'was', 'done', 'dosage', 'just', 'enough', 'let', 'sensible', 'logical', 'person', 'understand', 'challenges', 'face', 'today', 'society', 'flavor', 'humor', 'quad', 'team', 'opinion', 'Maz', 'Jobrani', 'Dean', 'Obeidallah', 'are', 'cream-of-the-crop', 'team', 'Especially', 'Maz', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'Ahmed', 'Aron', 'are', 'funny', 'part', 'delivery', 'method', 'Maz', 'Dean', 'are', 'outstanding', 'fresh', 'same', 'time', 'provoking', 'DVD', 'will', 'definately', 'be', 'permanant', 'collection', 'money', 'well-spent', 'entertainment', 'worth', 'watching', 'listening', '2-thumbs', '+', '2-big', 'toes', 'up']",The Axis of Evil Comedy Tour

There is no cutting edge, caustic humor here and few raunchy references. For the most part, this comedy DVD might be considered family fare.I'm not sure whether the comedians' tame tone on this DVD reflects their true dispositions, or whether it's due to the fact that they feel they're in a precarious position in the Western world. Either way, the result is an entertaining, generally unchallenging set of reflections and life stories.However one of the comics does manage to jolt us down to a deeper level of understanding about how dangerous schisms can suddenly form. He says that for most of his life, he was just an American, just a guy - then 9/11 happened - and probably forever after, he will be perceived first and foremost as ""an Arab.""",3,No Insurgents Here,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,884,"['mild-mannered', 'review', 'comics', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'descent', 'telling', 'what', 'be', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'post', '9/11', 'world', 'cutting', 'edge', 'caustic', 'humor', 'here', 'few', 'raunchy', 'references', 'most', 'part', 'comedy', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'family', 'fare.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'comedians', 'tame', 'tone', 'DVD', 'true', 'dispositions', 'due', 'fact', 'feel', ""'re"", 'precarious', 'position', 'Western', 'world', 'way', 'result', 'entertaining', 'generally', 'unchallenging', 'set', 'reflections', 'life', 'stories.However', 'one', 'comics', 'manage', 'jolt', 'down', 'deeper', 'level', 'understanding', 'how', 'dangerous', 'schisms', 'can', 'suddenly', 'form', 'most', 'life', 'was', 'just', 'American', 'just', 'guy', 'then', '9/11', 'happened', 'probably', 'forever', 'will', 'be', 'perceived', 'first', 'foremost', 'Arab']",The Axis of Evil Comedy Tour
