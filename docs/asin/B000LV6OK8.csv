1040777,A1H9DB7BDXDL6P,B000LV6OK8,jordyn skye,"[1, 2]",This collection surprised me with the age of some of the dramas.  It was not what I expected but it shows where Ms Dench came from and is a study of her career performances.  Much of it is old but like good wine just matures with age.Worth watching if your a serious follower of theatre.  Not light weight fluffy nothings.  Good and Ill watch it again and again Im sure.,5,Feast for Denchaholics!,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,370,"['collection', 'surprised', 'age', 'dramas', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'where', 'Ms', 'Dench', 'came', 'study', 'career', 'performances', 'Much', 'old', 'good', 'wine', 'just', 'age.Worth', 'watching', 'serious', 'follower', 'theatre', 'Not', 'light', 'weight', 'fluffy', 'nothings', 'Good', 'Ill', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Im', 'sure']",The Judi Dench Collection: (The Cherry Orchard / Talking to a Stranger / Keep an Eye on Amélie / Going Gently / Ghosts / and more)
