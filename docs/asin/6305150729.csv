451560,A1BWHXTFOVF9CY,6305150729,Blackhawk,"[4, 4]","When I found this movie, I was excited.  I've been a serious fan of Poul Anderson's work since I started reading.  &quot;The High Crusade&quot; has always been one of my favorite books by Anderson and I have long thought  that it would make an excellent movie.  I still think it would make an  excellent movie.  Unfortunately, this is not it.I was completely  surprised by the direction taken by the screen play and direction of this  movie.  Or maybe shocked would be a better word.  It had simply never  occurred to me that Anderson's book would be interpreted as a comedy.  Certainly, there is humor in the novel, but it is basically a story of high  adventure with some very serious elements balancing the humor.  There is  none of that in the movie.  Brown (the screen writer) and Knoesel &amp;  Neuhauser (the directors) extracted elements from the book and used them as  a skeleton on which to build a second rate &quot;Monty Python and the Holy  Grail.&quot;This movie was almost painful for me to watch because I  could see enough of the novel on the screen to know that a good movie could  have been made from &quot;The High Crusade.&quot;  The SFX, though a little  cheezy by current standards, are still acceptable.  The cast was adequate,  though some of the parts would have been cast differently if this were not  a comedy, I'm sure.  Certainly, John Rys-Davies makes an excellent Brother  Parvis and he is one of the few redeeming factors of this film.  And the  few scenes taken from the novel were almost watchable.  But the overall  tone and direction were not even remotely true to the novel.  Frankly, even  fans of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; will be disappointed  because it's just not that funny.If you have never read the book, then  you may find this movie mildly amusing.  If you are a fan of this classic  science fiction novel, then I recommend steering clear of this movie.  It  will taint your good memories of the book forever.",1,A Major Disappointment,915753600,"01 8, 1999",1999,1975,"['When', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', ""'ve"", 'been', 'serious', 'fan', 'Poul', 'Anderson', 'work', 'started', 'reading', 'quot', 'High', 'Crusade', 'quot', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'Anderson', 'have', 'long', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'movie', 'still', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'it.I', 'was', 'completely', 'surprised', 'direction', 'taken', 'screen', 'play', 'direction', 'movie', 'maybe', 'shocked', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'word', 'had', 'simply', 'never', 'occurred', 'Anderson', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'interpreted', 'comedy', 'Certainly', 'humor', 'novel', 'basically', 'story', 'high', 'adventure', 'very', 'serious', 'elements', 'balancing', 'humor', 'none', 'movie', 'Brown', 'screen', 'writer', 'Knoesel', 'amp', 'Neuhauser', 'directors', 'extracted', 'elements', 'book', 'used', 'skeleton', 'build', 'second', 'rate', 'quot', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail.', 'quot', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'could', 'see', 'enough', 'novel', 'screen', 'know', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'quot', 'High', 'Crusade.', 'quot', 'SFX', 'little', 'cheezy', 'current', 'standards', 'are', 'still', 'acceptable', 'cast', 'was', 'adequate', 'parts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'differently', 'were', 'not', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Certainly', 'John', 'Rys-Davies', 'excellent', 'Brother', 'Parvis', 'one', 'few', 'redeeming', 'factors', 'film', 'few', 'scenes', 'taken', 'novel', 'were', 'almost', 'watchable', 'overall', 'tone', 'direction', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'true', 'novel', 'Frankly', 'even', 'fans', 'quot', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'just', 'not', 'funny.If', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'novel', 'then', 'recommend', 'steering', 'clear', 'movie', 'will', 'taint', 'good', 'memories', 'book', 'forever']",High Crusade

We all know compromises need to be made in the format transfer and middle aged fanboys like nothing more than to whine about it. But it would seem that rather than a straight adventure story the makers went for a comedy angle. Now there is nothing wrong with that - if it was funny.And that is the crux of the matter. The attempts at humour here are so desultory. There is little cleverness and while there are some attempts at physical slapstick it mostly falls flat. There are times when little things going on do provide the glimmer of a smirk - the executioners torturing each other to pass the time is one such point and the chastity belt schtick is another. But the main problem is that in the vast majority of cases the movie just fails utterly to 'bring the funny'.Some of the actors try to inject some energy into their performance but with this script and the idiom of the movie in general they can't achieve much and to tell the truth you don't even get the sense that they were enjoying making the film in any way.
