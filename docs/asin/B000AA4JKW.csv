924708,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000AA4JKW,A. Estes,"[3, 4]","Let's face it: The original ""Amityville Horror,"" released in 1979, is horribly dated. Unlike other horror movies at the time, this movie just hasn't held up very well. Not to mention, the onslaught of sequels which, while they were entertaining, were never much for scares or originality. I had always thought in the back of my mind, when movies like ""Dawn Of The Dead"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" were being remade, why not ""The Amityville Horror?"" If any horror franchise needs to be renovated, surely it is this creaky old James Brolin flick. Now don't get me wrong; I'm an ""Amityville"" fan. I love all the great horror movies from way back, but there is just so much to be improved on. But I digress.The new ""Amityville Horror"" is brought to you by the Platinum Dunes production company (spearheaded by blockbuster director-turned-producer Michael Bay), who also put out 2003's most excellent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" If you are familiar with that remake, you can pretty much imagine what they did with this one, which is why I dragged myself into the theater to see it. The scares are definitely up quite a bit from the original, and it moves at a much faster pace too. Ryan Reynolds (who you may remember from movies such as ""Van Wilder"" and ""Blade: Trinity,"" but whom I would rather remember from ""Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle"" instead) takes his most serious role, as the nice-guy, step-father who buys the troubled house on Ocean Avenue. It's such a steal too, because at the price he is offered, he can start a new life with his new wife and three troubled kids (whose father is deceased). However, nothing is free in this world, and the dream is too good to be true. Little do they know, until it is too late, that a man murdered his entire family in cold blood just one year prior. It turns out this beautiful house just may be possessed by demons, and turns the man of the house into a cruel psychopath who tries to kill the family and their beloved dog. It's more or less the same deal as the original movie. Although not being a complete remake, it does stay true to the source material while adding new elements that make this easily the best film in the ""Amityville"" franchise to date. It's not really a horror movie, more of a suspense/drama. If you're expecting extreme scares, this might not do it for you. But it is a nice distraction for 90 minutes and is very well made, with newcomer director Andrew Douglas pulling all the right strings. My only gripe with this movie is the ending. True, it doesn't have to be a splatterfest, but it didn't really grab me like it should of and I feel let off the hook too easy. But regardless, I still recommend any horror fan go see it. It's not without it's flaws, but it sure beats the unimaginitve ""PG-13"" horrors that we have been bombarded with for the past few years.",4,"Yet Another Horror Remake -- But Boy, This One Needed It!",1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2848,"['Let', 'face', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'released', '1979', 'horribly', 'dated', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'time', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'Not', 'mention', 'onslaught', 'sequels', 'were', 'entertaining', 'were', 'never', 'much', 'scares', 'originality', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'back', 'mind', 'when', 'movies', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'were', 'being', 'remade', 'why', 'not', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'horror', 'franchise', 'be', 'renovated', 'surely', 'creaky', 'old', 'James', 'Brolin', 'flick', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'Amityville', 'fan', 'love', 'great', 'horror', 'movies', 'way', 'back', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'improved', 'digress.The', 'new', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'brought', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'production', 'company', 'spearheaded', 'blockbuster', 'director-turned-producer', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'who', 'also', 'put', 'out', '2003', 'most', 'excellent', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'are', 'familiar', 'remake', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'imagine', 'what', 'did', 'one', 'why', 'dragged', 'theater', 'see', 'scares', 'are', 'definitely', 'quite', 'bit', 'original', 'much', 'faster', 'pace', 'too', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'movies', 'such', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'whom', 'would', 'rather', 'remember', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Go', 'White', 'Castle', 'instead', 'most', 'serious', 'role', 'nice-guy', 'step-father', 'who', 'troubled', 'house', 'Ocean', 'Avenue', 'such', 'steal', 'too', 'price', 'offered', 'can', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'wife', 'three', 'troubled', 'kids', 'father', 'deceased', 'However', 'nothing', 'free', 'world', 'dream', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'too', 'late', 'man', 'murdered', 'entire', 'family', 'cold', 'blood', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'prior', 'out', 'beautiful', 'house', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'possessed', 'demons', 'man', 'house', 'cruel', 'psychopath', 'who', 'kill', 'family', 'beloved', 'dog', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'deal', 'original', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'complete', 'remake', 'stay', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'adding', 'new', 'elements', 'make', 'easily', 'best', 'film', 'Amityville', 'franchise', 'date', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'suspense/drama', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'extreme', 'scares', 'might', 'not', 'do', 'nice', 'distraction', '90', 'minutes', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'newcomer', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Douglas', 'pulling', 'right', 'strings', 'only', 'gripe', 'movie', 'ending', 'True', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'splatterfest', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'grab', 'should', 'feel', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'too', 'easy', 'regardless', 'still', 'recommend', 'horror', 'fan', 'go', 'see', 'not', 'flaws', 'sure', 'unimaginitve', 'PG-13', 'horrors', 'have', 'been', 'bombarded', 'past', 'few', 'years']",The Amityville Horror

Knepper ""StAr_review""","[2, 2]","Packed more than a scare or two, interesting special effects, filled with all the cliches of horror movies, yet somehow it seemed to work itself out into something likeable. After sitting through the ridiculous and unnecessary ""Ring 2"" and with year-old memories of the horrific (not in a good way) ""House of the Dead"" still ringing a bell in my head, though, my expectations were low, so keep that in mind.If you're out to have a good time at the movies with your friends, this is the perfect movie. But you need to not take this seriously in order to enjoy it, and that's what people too often forget about movies. Though this movie recieved awful reviews, it's best not to listen to the critics, for their tastes won't always match yours.Moving forth, I must say I find horror movies hard to review. The point of them is to scare, and I got shaky more than once, I actually felt uncomfortable at one point, and I consider myself pretty strong in horror movies (I see every horror movie released).

924711,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B000AA4JKW,Allen Chapman,"[2, 3]","I was very much looking forward to this new version of ""The Amityville Horror"". I liked the original and was hoping that this would be better than that. It's not. The acting is much better but that's about it. I think the original was far scarier and seemed to hold together better. In this new version the last half of the movie seems to totally fall apart. It's also interesting to note that nearly every religious element of the movie has been stripped away. The original had many religious scenes in it, of which only one remains in this new take. As I said the acting is far better this time around. But the changes made to the ""true"" story are just stretched too far. The scenes that made the original so scary are no longer part of the story, the glowing red eyes, the red room in the cellar, the linking of George Lutz to Ronnie DeFeo, even the blood dripping down the walls, all are not part of this telling. Some elements are briefly touched on, but most are gone altogether.I was hoping for so much more. I loved how they updated ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and was hoping the same would happen this time around. Not so. No one is expected to believe that what you are seeing in ""The Amityville Horror"" is at all true despite was is claimed. I suppose for a modern haunted house flick it's not bad. The original was creepier though.

So for the actors themselves, a big thumbs up.But that's it. Otherwise, I felt cheated. New, expensive eye-candy, a complete rewrite of the original, including characters and events, and an overall reason for the whole haunting that was not so subtly ""borrowed"" from ""Poltergeist II"".For a great performance of a man slowly losing his sanity, check out Reynold's performance in this movie. For a fun ""scary"" movie, with some good jumps and CGI laden effects, plug this one in late one night......but for a genuinely frightening, well written, acted, and directed version of the allegedly ""true"" events that this story is based on, complete with a haunting score and a gently but irrevocably building sense of palpable dread, stick with the original.For just another Hollywood scare flick, I give it two stars...with another one tacked on for the superb performance of Ryan Reynolds.",3,Expected more...,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1622,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'yes', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'not', 'say', 'HATED', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'performances', 'hate', 'general', 'whole', 're-imagining', 'trend', 'classic', 'classic', 'REASON.In', 'actuality', 'found', 'SOME', 'redeeming', 'merits', 'movie', 'sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feeling', 'regardless', 'performers', 'involved', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'let', 'remake', 'classic', 'make', 'ton', 'money', 'regardless', 'how', 'good', 'mentality', 'firmly', 'mind.The', 'actors', 'specifically', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'turned', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'could', 'really', 'FEEL', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'astray', 'character', 'George', 'Lutz', 'mind', 'inability', 'cope', 'So', 'actors', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up.But', 'Otherwise', 'felt', 'cheated', 'New', 'expensive', 'eye-candy', 'complete', 'rewrite', 'original', 'including', 'characters', 'events', 'overall', 'reason', 'whole', 'haunting', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'subtly', 'borrowed', 'Poltergeist', 'II', 'great', 'performance', 'man', 'slowly', 'losing', 'sanity', 'check', 'out', 'Reynold', 'performance', 'movie', 'fun', 'scary', 'movie', 'good', 'jumps', 'CGI', 'laden', 'effects', 'plug', 'one', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'version', 'allegedly', 'true', 'events', 'story', 'based', 'complete', 'haunting', 'score', 'gently', 'irrevocably', 'building', 'sense', 'palpable', 'dread', 'stick', 'original.For', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'scare', 'flick', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'one', 'tacked', 'superb', 'performance', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds']",The Amityville Horror

Rather than build a mood through true film-making techniques, this film relies upon fake looking computer effects to the point there is nothing to be afraid of because we are shown everything.

It seems as that about 75% of movies released in the US anymore are remakes which I usually loathe, but from the previews I thought this one might be not too bad.First off, I think Ryan Reynolds has the potential to be a really good leading man in the near future.  He has got lots of charisma, can be very funny, and can grow a totally pimp beard.  He's very good here showing off his range, going from the happy dad to psychopathic child abuser in seconds.  There's a few scenes when he's yelling at his stepkids that are a little creepy.  Secondly, Reynold's wife in the film is Melissa George.  I think she was a bit wasted in her role.  She was so great on her stint on 'Alias', but here she just seems to be going through the ""cute woman in a horror movie"" motions.  The kids in the film aren't too bad.  Usually children in film make me want to puke, but these here, thankfully, aren't too awfully annoying.There's not really any super-scary moments that really standout in my mind.  There's a couple creepy shots but nothing that really makes you jump.  The special effects are well done.  The little girl ghost was slightly creepy.  Thankfully the entire plot wasn't over-explained and thankfully the happy couple didn't turn into detectives to find out what was going on in the house.  That has been done to death.All in all, the remake of 'Amityville Horror' isn't so bad.  Its not going to win any awards but its an amusing way to spend an hour and a half.  The best thing about the film is Reynold's performance and the ""babysitter stuck in the closet"" scene.  Unfortunately though, there's no really big-time scares but there is an amazing amount of cursing for a PG-13 rating.

THE AMITYVILLE HORROR has some good atmosphere, some great scares and mostly good performances for the first hour or so.Then the priest comes over and is attacked by a swarm of cartoon flies and the movie grinds to a halt. It seems obvious to me that another writer took over at this point, to make the movie more ""safely"" freaky and frightening. So we get a lot of the usual ""boos"" and creepy imagery, but the movie loses the eerie, malevolent atmosphere as it turns into yet another CGI-laden freakshow.Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George are very good as the young couple who have gotten in over their heads and find their lives unravelling.I will not go into the ridiculous and moronic ending. Let's just say the filmmakers attempt to take the original movie's ending and ""spice it up"" to appeal to today's audience. I found myself rolling my eyes and chuckling in exasperation more than a few times in the movie's last ten minutes.Overall, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is okay.

924725,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000AA4JKW,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 2]","What's old is new again. That seems to be what studios are thinking in Hollywood. Old TV shows are being made into movies, and old movies are getting updates. Most of the time, they don't turn out well, and are unnecessary. But this film is a little bit different than the other horror film remakes of late. The original film is not really held in high regards or is much of a classic, really. It's not ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Psycho"", or ""Dawn Of The Dead"". The original film was a film that was in need of a remake. It was open for a change and a bit of a face lift. This is the first time a horror movie remake was done that needed to be done. And it proves quite effective. Based on a true story(well, half of a true story anyway), the new film seems to take some liberty with the original material and changes some things around. All for the better if you ask me. Super buff Ryan Reynolds and lovely Melissa George star as George and Kathy Lutz, a Long Island couple who move into a big new house on the waterfront. It doesn't take long for weird things to happen, the little girl to befriend a dead girl, and for George to start snapping and acting like a crazed lunatic. Why?. A year earlier, Ron DeFeo killed his entire family with a shotgun. He claimed that he heard voices and they told him to do it. Apparently, those same voices are now invading George's psyche. The movie is a lot quicker and more brutal than the original, but I would of preferred the movie stuck to the original's longer running time. Horror movies today are so short that everything happens so fast and is over before you know it. The end credits begin 81 minutes into the movie, while the original was hitting the 2 hour mark. The casting was great. Reynolds, who was still in ""Blade"" condition, played the role well. He got the James Brolin beard going, and he played crazy very well. Was very believeable when he would go from good to bad. Melissa does an adequate job as the put upon wife. Phillip Baker Hall has the Rod Steiger role here as the priest who comes to the house. It's a small role, but Hall does what he can with it. The kids are well cast. They are not typical cute kids who walked out of a Gap ad. They look real. The look of the film is exceptional as well. The direction and cinematography is sharp, vibrant, and alive. It is very nicely done. Plus, the year is 1975, and the film really does a good job of capturing the look and feel of it, and has everyone wearing appropriate clothing. The opening minutes of Ron DeFeo's shotgun outburst towards his family was strikingly done. It's quite easy to say that this movie was better than the original and first two sequels combined. But what about the actual story?. We all know the murders are real, but anything else?. Personally, I see the ""hearing voices"" thing as something DeFeo made up seeking a shorter sentence, and something that the new owners heard and carried further. I don't believe in the Lutz' ghost story, but a great ghost story it does make. So, there are a lot of great set pieces here. The mood and vibe is felt, and the music is good without it being too over the top. I think the film would of benefitted a bit more if it were a bit longer, and not have everything come together so incredibly fast. Plus, who wouldn't want a babysitter like that?. There are chills and thrills here and there, and some startling visuals. Things go crazy and the acting is pretty darn good to back it all up. In this day and age, things are becoming too safe and PG-13 rated. That's okay if a movie calls for it, but some don't and are watered down for more butts in theater seats. I'm glad to say that this is an R rated horror film.

I have never seen the original Amittyville, so I do not know if this is better or worse is sure was one hell of a film.  I love movies brought to us by producer Michael Bay.  I have seen every movie he is involved (He is my favorite director and I cannot wait for his next film -The Island), this was just as good as last horror movie he produced, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, maybe even better.  Unlike many other recent horror films, this one does not fail to deliver scares.  And it is so hard to point the negative facts abou this film.  Sure some of the dialogue was kinda dumb, but thnat it is.  This film is very creepy and intense, and it constantly plays with your mind because you'll always wonder what's gonna happen next. Ryan Reynolds makes an impressive performance playing George Lutz.  I never thought that guy could ever play solmen role after seeing Blade Trinity and Van Wilder.  It is not that he was bad in those films, it is just that his characters never seemed to take things seriousely.  But he sure did prove me wrong in this horror flick.Back in the 1970's, in a the town of Amityville, a young man killed his entire family.  He took a rifle and shot all of them when they were asleep.  He claims that he was possesed, and that the house was ""telling him to kill his family"" by saying ""katchem and killem"".  One year later family by the name of Lutz moves in to the home.  The head of the family George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) wants to this to be for him to have good start with the family because he is actually not their real dad.  This seemed like their house,a big home, a great price, near the river-What go possibly go wrong.  However, soon after the move in, creepy stuff starts to happen.  Something always causes the dog to be barking late at night, causing George agony.  Also, mysterious vioces are heard in house saying ""catchem and killem"".Eventually, George starts to get parnoid about any little thing that goes wrong, especially when it done by one of the kids.  And if that is not enough,  his little girl Chelsea (Chloe Grace Moretz) claims to have an imagery friend-JODI.  However she is not imaginary, she is the ghost of the girl who was murdered in that house one year.  All of these factors slowly cause George to lose his mind and persuade him to kill his family.Anyway, this new Amityville was one terrifying horror flick.  It sure as hell will send a chill down your spine especially at times when you see Jodi and other demonic forces that terrorize the family.  I defnietly want to see this movie again and you should see while it is still in theaters.",5,SCARY AS HELL!!

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[3, 5]","I saw the original Amityville Horror movie and was scared to death, so I wanted to see this remake, especially after learning that Michael Bay, producer ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacrewas producing it. He did a frightening job with that one.This movie is based on the fact that a family of six was brutally murdered in a real house in Amityville, New York in 1974. It starts with an unsuspecting young couple and their children moving into the house which is now haunted by an evil, murderous presence intent on killing them.I gripped the arms of my chair as I watched the couple struggle against pure evil for twenty-eight days of terror, complete with demonic visions of the dead, creepy photography, screams of terror... In other words, all the trappings of modern, high-tech visuals that go into producing a good horror movie. Another plus is that the actors were good and seemed well suited for their roles.The Amityville Horror (Widescreen Special Edition)did what a horror movie is supposed to do: kept me gasping as I urged the people to escape from the house before it killed them.Even though this is my favorite haunted house film, I give only four stars because it didn't frighten me as much as the original. Please consider that I was much younger then, so probably scared more easily. Also, since I had seen the first one I knew a little about what was coming. I recommend you to see it and judge for yourself.Endnote: Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is another spooky haunted-house horror.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, June 27, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books",4,My Favorite Haunted House Movie...

924731,A18QA3A3UYWFU9,B000AA4JKW,Blade,"[5, 9]","First, I'd like to claim that I've been a fan of the original 1979, ""The Amityville Horror"". It is truly one of the most terrifying [and scariest] ghost stories you will ever see! Despite the obvious limitations to low budget filming, it does surprisingly deliver that nightmarish atmosphere that keeps you scared all the way to the unforgettable climatic ending! Hoax or not, it proved to be quite popular with the public upon release, considering the fact that it's actually based off the bestselling novel by Jay Anson. Additionally, a fair amount of it even stays true to Anson's version of the Lutz family and the shocking 28 days, which they experienced in the old Long Island estate.If you asked me, I'd tell you that I must've watched it more than five times by now and it still never fails to scare the absolute crap out of me! What's more, I WAS truly looking forward to the remake like many and my hopes were set high! After all, I enjoyed ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake and I love it just as much as the original. Unfortunately, this wasn't the same for 'Amityville'! Directed by Andrew Douglas and produced by Michael Bay (who also took part in the TCM remake), this is one of those remakes that leave you wondering, ""Why did they have to do that? It was fine just the way it was!""The storyline has been changed drastically (aside from the Lutz family moving into the house and experiencing strange events taking place) and the acting is nothing more but cardboard. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George simply cannot replace James Brolin and Margot Kidder as Kathy and George Lutz. In the 1979 version, we were given powerful and dramatic performances that actually had us feel sympathy for the characters. Sadly, this isn't so the second time through and you really couldn't care either way whether the characters live or die. Also, why spoil all the fun by revealing Jodie's character? In the original, we never get to see what Jodie looks like, but this method proves to be A LOT more effective and suspenseful than the ghost of some dead little girl.Furthermore, we hardly even get to know THIS Lutz family due to the fact that the 28 days shift by so quick through the VERY short 90 minutes! For example, we only get to see maybe one or two days that they go through until the film skips all the way to Day 28! So where's the character development? Not quite there. Again, you can't really feel much sympathy for the characters here. Finally, the, usage of CGI effects were just terrible! Personally, I believe that CGI should NOT belong in a horror movie because it takes away the scary atmosphere and ruins the realism! (Can anybody say, ""White Noise"" or ""Ring Two""?) It may not be as overdone, but it is still noticeable and it shouldn't be there PERIOD!Luckily, I didn't have to pay a dime when I went to go see the premiere of this in Seattle, considering the fact that a fellow classmate of mine had offered a bunch of us free spare tickets that she'd gotten in order for everyone to go. I'm most thankful and I know for a fact now that I'm sticking with the original 1979 version, which is the BEST and ONLY version that you should look into! Hollywood has been known to take other great classics (e.g. George A. Romero's, ""Dawn of the Dead"") and hack 'em up to shreds! They'd better stay away from Tobe Hooper's and Steven Spielberg's, ""Poltergeist"" because it's one of those genuine horror masterpieces that do NOT need a remake! If they want to restore, some deleted scenes fine. Otherwise, LEAVE IT ALONE!

924736,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B000AA4JKW,Brian,"[4, 5]","Okay, before I begin, I would simply like to know what it was about this film that was allegedly so bad. I missed this one in theaters and have since read every manner of unfair dissertation you can possibly imagine. Do people these days go to movies solely for the purpose of picking them apart? Apparently, aside from myself and most of my immediate friends and family, they do. What gives? A great many who post here and on the many different message boards I frequent seem so vehemently against the existence of remakes. That leads me to wonder why they bother dedicating their time to watching them in the first place. These people have already convinced themselves of the presumptous notion that the movie will automatically bomb, so why do they put themselves through such unnecessary torture? I guess that is a mystery destined to remain unsolved.I own the first two original ""Amityville"" films and, personally, I have to say I was very impressed with what I saw in this remake. Andrew Douglas comes across very competent in his directing skills, and Scott Kosar's screenplay got everything right. This was an updating that upped the intensity level several welcome notches, and the pacing was through the roof. I applaud these improvements because the original movie, while still a fairly decent film in its own right, has not aged very well. It was long overdue for a remake and, for my money, it was well worth the blind buy I made. Nobody will ever really know what happened in that house. Did Ronald De Feo hear voices that compelled him to slaughter his entire family? Were evil spirits or ghosts the real reason behind the Lutz family's departure? Who can say? This remake scored points with me because it gave me everything I wanted out of the original. I went into this looking for a fun, fast-paced thrill ride--which is exactly what all the promotional information promised it would be--and that is precisely what I got. I don't regret the time I invested while sitting through it and I still, for the life of me, do not understand why so many others continue to slam it into oblivion.The DVD is nicely packaged, the transfer crisp and clear. I would recommend this to anybody who feels the same way about the originals as I do. It is not a classic, nor does it try to be.

924745,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B000AA4JKW,Chris,"[9, 19]","Nobody really knows what happened on 12 Ocean Ave. in Amityville, NY in 1974.  The movie starts out with one of Hollywood's greatest tags ""Based on a True Story.""  The fact is that Ronald DaFoe did murder his family, blaming voices from the house for his actions and the Lutz's did move into the house one year later, but after that its all a fuzz.  But regardless of whether or not the events in the story are true, one thing is for certain: it makes for one hell of a spooky tale.As mentioned earlier the story is about the Lutz family and their 28 days living in a haunted house.  They decide to move into their dream house in Amityville, Long Island becasue it was being sold at a killer price (no pun intended).  They learn that the previous residents were all brutally murdered, but the price and the house were too good to pass up.  After they move into the house George (Ryan Reynolds) starts to feel different.  He starts hearing voices in the house and starts to see ghosts.  Slowly the voices start to posses him.  They convince him that his family are all demons and slowly over the 28 day span, he starts to go crazy.  This eventually leads up to him attempting to kill his family.There were some good things in this movie.  First was Ryan Reynolds performance of George Lutz.  I was a little hesitant about accepting him in a serious role, but he managed to pull of a very powerful, emotional role.  Also he convinced me that he was really going crazy.  The other actors do a fine job as well.  I also like the re-creation of the Amityville Haunted House.  The house itself creates a really spooky atmosphere.  Lastly, I liked the fact that the movie was just plain creepy.  There are a lot of scenes that make you jump, but the atmosphere of the movie never really lets the viewer feel comfortable.So I would recommend seeing this movie.  Its enough to hold you off until the summer movie season starts and it is good for a few scares.  Whether you believe that the story is real or not is up to you, but you should definately watch to see whether you believe in ghost stories like this or not.",4,Spooky Remake of a Good Horror Story,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2109,"['Nobody', 'really', 'what', 'happened', '12', 'Ocean', 'Ave.', 'Amityville', 'NY', '1974', 'movie', 'out', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'tags', 'Based', 'True', 'Story', 'fact', 'Ronald', 'DaFoe', 'did', 'murder', 'family', 'blaming', 'voices', 'house', 'actions', 'Lutz', 'did', 'move', 'house', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'fuzz', 'regardless', 'not', 'events', 'story', 'are', 'true', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'one', 'hell', 'spooky', 'tale.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'story', 'Lutz', 'family', '28', 'days', 'living', 'haunted', 'house', 'decide', 'move', 'dream', 'house', 'Amityville', 'Long', 'Island', 'becasue', 'was', 'being', 'sold', 'killer', 'price', 'pun', 'intended', 'learn', 'previous', 'residents', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'price', 'house', 'were', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'move', 'house', 'George', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'feel', 'different', 'hearing', 'voices', 'house', 'see', 'ghosts', 'Slowly', 'voices', 'start', 'posses', 'convince', 'family', 'are', 'demons', 'slowly', '28', 'day', 'span', 'go', 'crazy', 'eventually', 'up', 'attempting', 'kill', 'family.There', 'were', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'First', 'was', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'performance', 'George', 'Lutz', 'was', 'little', 'hesitant', 'accepting', 'serious', 'role', 'managed', 'pull', 'very', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'role', 'Also', 'convinced', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'crazy', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'also', 're-creation', 'Amityville', 'Haunted', 'House', 'house', 'really', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'Lastly', 'liked', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'are', 'lot', 'scenes', 'make', 'jump', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'viewer', 'feel', 'comfortable.So', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'enough', 'hold', 'off', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', 'good', 'few', 'scares', 'believe', 'story', 'real', 'not', 'up', 'should', 'definately', 'watch', 'see', 'believe', 'ghost', 'stories', 'not']",The Amityville Horror

With almost every horror film being remade these days it would only make sense that someone would eventually tackle `The Amityville Horror' and much to my amazement this is a valiant effort.  The choppy filming adds to the air of claustrophobia and panic and keeps you paranoid over what's to happen next.  Another A+ was the cast, Reynolds blowing me away with his complex performance.  He was able to go from caring and concerned to the ultimate evil within blinks of an eye and none of it seemed forced.  He was truly terrifying.The film is of course based on true events.  My family actually knows a family that once lived in that house, of course years after these events, and they too experienced problems, nothing like what happened to the Lutz family, but problems none the less.  George (Ryan Reynolds) and his new bride Kathy (Melissa George) have bought and moved into the house once own by the DiFeo's just about a year after their eldest son Ronald murdered his entire family in their sleep laying claim that voices within the house told him to kill.  It's because of this very event that the Lutz's can afford the home, for no one else will take it.Upon moving in with their three children (all from Kathy's previous marriage) things start to turn ugly, almost immediately.  George is seeing things, their youngest daughter Chelsea (Chloe Moretz) is talking to a young girl named Jodie and Kathy is seeing a dark and disturbing change in her husband.  George is also starting to scare the kids, especially the eldest son Billy (Jesse James, the little brat from `Butterfly Effect').  As the days count down to day 28 (Ronald killed his family on the 28th day after he moved into the basement, which is where George has been working) things start to drastically get worse and the Lutz family is becoming more and more fearful of what the outcome may be.As everyone knows, the Lutz family flees the house on that 28th night, never to return, not even for their belongings, and upon hearing that one may think this can't be all that scary for we already know that no one dies...but it's not the prospect of death that makes this film so terrifying, it's watching what happened to the minds of those involved, watching George change right before your eyes into a monster, watching him stalk his family and try to butcher them is downright horrifying, and although it may end on a somewhat relaxed note (in that they all get away) it's not in the slightest bit a happy note, for what they went through in that house is enough to scar even the strongest of individuals.",4,Some may balk but this remake is no joke...,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,2704,"['opening', ""'re"", 'assured', 'going', 'be', 'horrific', 'remake', 'brutal', 'delivery', 'high', 'scare', 'factor', 'almost', 'horror', 'film', 'being', 'remade', 'days', 'would', 'only', 'make', 'sense', 'someone', 'would', 'eventually', 'tackle', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'much', 'amazement', 'valiant', 'effort', 'choppy', 'filming', 'air', 'claustrophobia', 'panic', 'paranoid', 'what', 'happen', 'next', 'A+', 'was', 'cast', 'Reynolds', 'blowing', 'away', 'complex', 'performance', 'was', 'able', 'go', 'caring', 'concerned', 'ultimate', 'evil', 'blinks', 'eye', 'none', 'seemed', 'forced', 'was', 'truly', 'terrifying.The', 'film', 'course', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'family', 'actually', 'family', 'once', 'lived', 'house', 'course', 'years', 'events', 'too', 'experienced', 'problems', 'nothing', 'what', 'happened', 'Lutz', 'family', 'problems', 'none', 'less', 'George', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'new', 'bride', 'Kathy', 'Melissa', 'George', 'have', 'bought', 'moved', 'house', 'once', 'own', 'DiFeo', 'just', 'year', 'eldest', 'son', 'Ronald', 'murdered', 'entire', 'family', 'sleep', 'laying', 'claim', 'voices', 'house', 'told', 'kill', 'very', 'event', 'Lutz', 'can', 'afford', 'home', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'take', 'it.Upon', 'moving', 'three', 'children', 'Kathy', 'previous', 'marriage', 'things', 'start', 'turn', 'ugly', 'almost', 'immediately', 'George', 'seeing', 'things', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Chelsea', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'talking', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Jodie', 'Kathy', 'seeing', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'change', 'husband', 'George', 'also', 'starting', 'scare', 'kids', 'especially', 'eldest', 'son', 'Billy', 'Jesse', 'James', 'little', 'brat', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'days', 'count', 'down', 'day', '28', 'Ronald', 'killed', 'family', '28th', 'day', 'moved', 'basement', 'where', 'George', 'been', 'working', 'things', 'start', 'drastically', 'get', 'worse', 'Lutz', 'family', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'fearful', 'what', 'outcome', 'may', 'be.As', 'everyone', 'knows', 'Lutz', 'family', 'house', '28th', 'night', 'never', 'return', 'not', 'even', 'belongings', 'hearing', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'scary', 'already', 'know', 'one', 'not', 'prospect', 'death', 'film', 'so', 'terrifying', 'watching', 'what', 'happened', 'minds', 'involved', 'watching', 'George', 'change', 'right', 'eyes', 'monster', 'watching', 'stalk', 'family', 'try', 'butcher', 'downright', 'horrifying', 'may', 'end', 'somewhat', 'relaxed', 'note', 'get', 'away', 'not', 'slightest', 'bit', 'happy', 'note', 'what', 'went', 'house', 'enough', 'scar', 'even', 'strongest', 'individuals']",The Amityville Horror

Also, it is obvious that something is wrong with the father way before you reach the climax. Any sane person would of left the house before things became critical. Wait a minute, isnt this supposed to be a horror movie? Arent't horror movies scary? The scariest thing about this movie was me realizing that I wasted my money on it. A movie that lacks reason, good acting, and pace should be avoided at all costs. However, if you must see this movie wait until it comes on cable.

924753,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B000AA4JKW,Danno,"[2, 3]","""The Amityville Horror"" is a surprisingly good recent horror film. Michael Bay uses the original film as a strong base, and adds several conventions borrowed from more recent horror films (mainly the American remakes of ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring""). The result is far from subtle, but unlike most recent horror films, ""Amityville"" is thoroughly professional, competent, and well-crafted. Purists will carp about how this film takes liberties with the 'true' Amityville story, but I could care less. I got some genuine scares with this movie, was entertained from beginning to end, and was happy at how the film found some resolution at its climax.Flaws? Although set in the 1970s, Bay doesn't really capture the feel of the decade at all and there are many anomalies that will drive you up the wall if you remember the decade well. The hairstyles, the fashions, and even the home decor seem more late 1990s than mid-1970s. Also, the scenery looks nothing like Long Island (where the real Amityville is located), and one wonders exactly why the test pattern shown on TV periodically is still the black-and-white Indian Chief that hadn't been used since the 1960s.Horror is a lot like comedy. What tickles one person silly is just silly to another.

924754,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B000AA4JKW,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[3, 6]","No, I mean it. Seriously. Grab your date, leave the popcorn behind, and vamoose---before the credits roll.Trust me, you'll thank me later.Now: we're talking the remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" here, right? Fine. Let's talk a little real estate. Case in point: take that seventies rambler-style junkheap down the block, paint peeling, one-and-a-half dinky seventies style bathrooms (one with the bathtub you can take a shower in, if you're that desperate), seedy finished basement with the shag rug that still smells of basement, postage-stamp sized 'yard'. Yeah, that one.Now: slap on a fresh coat of paint. In your ad, gush about the ""lavish downstairs Rec-room, perfect for a home-entertainment system"". Highlight the ""spacious backyard, perfect for barbecues!"". Yeah, you'll get triple what you paid for it back in the day, but it's still the same old cramped basement-stinking seventies junkhole, with a fresh coat of paint.That's ""Amityville Horror"" redux. It's the old 1979 sleazeball classic, mined for all the blood and guts and carnage, bled dry of all the sleazy trashy fun, slapped with a fresh coat of paint with every single jump scare mined to the max, every single telephone call amped to the airplane-takeoff decibel levels, and a few jittery-shakey Hellraiser monsters thrown in just in case your audience starts to nod off. Oh, and Ryan Reynolds is tossed in to play George Lutz, who in this version, for some unknown reason, sports a body by Men's Health.Stop me if you've heard this one before: Lutz family gets a screaming steal of a deal on a rambling Long Island colonial (with foundations going back to Puritan times---no, I mean, all the way back). Lutz family gets debriefed on the House's origins; Lutz family shrugs. Hey, a steal's a steal. Lutz family starts seeing dead people. The walls bleed. George Lutz starts spending quality time with the household axe.Sound familiar?There a few nasty shocks---a leering ghoul glimpsed in a mirror, the sinewy thing that leaps at Lutz from the shadows of the boathouse---but these two instances take seconds. They are hints of a better, darker, nastier movie that could have been, a movie obliterated by the edits, cuts, committee decisions, and slipshod craftsmanship required to get the `product' to market.As it is, Amityville Redux is all sizzle, no steak. The 1979 original, far from perfect, nonetheless possesses a healthy, shameless seventies sleaze that makes its shocks even tastier: it's like watching a trashier version of one of those Hammer Horror flicks.And Brolin owned the original Amityville horror: even when Brolin wasn't in cutting maniac form, his beard took over and chewed the scenery. Now, granted, I know Ryan Reynolds just turned---what, fifteen?---but you know you're in trouble when the scariest thing in a horror flick is Reynold's fake facial fur. It takes Reynolds all of about 3 minutes to go from doting father to batsh*t axe-toting psychopath, but the facial fur was wrong from the beginning.Oh, and the rest of the acting? Melissa George (Ma Lutz) is easy on the eyes, and Phillip Baker Hall (Father Callaway) looks like he's been in one study hall too many.And that's about it. We don't even get toilets spewing black goop (one of my faves in a horror flick from back in the day) or a demonic pig. Dammit, I go to see ""The Amityville Horror"", I want my red-eyed, hulking demonic pig!I'm not against remakes---if they have something new, or fresh, or terrifying to say (besides ""I want your money""). Two cases in point: the scaldingly scary remakes of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". But this wretched thing has nothing to say: it's all the plot points, none of the sleazy goop-spewing goodness.This is a file-and-forget that will be filed and forgotten before you're out of the cineplex, a safe studio movie that goes by the numbers. You'll be tempted to settle down and stay, but don't give in---there's better real estate out there.

If you ever get a chance, read the novel these films are based on. It is one of the scariest books this side of Steven King, and will truly raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Unfortunately, no one has ever done a really good job translating the scares found in the book to the big screen.

After having read the book I was always convinced that something big was missing from the original movie, yet I could never figure out what. Then I saw the new remake with Ryan Reynolds and I figured out the missing elenent: George Lutz's descent into insanity from the spirits of the house. It is without a doubt the greatest asset the new movie can offer. Sure it's effects are far superior and the look of the movie is crisp and modern but what truly stands out is Reynolds as Lutz, careening mentally out of control for all to see. What drives him to that point are the visions and the dreams, and before too long, George is left wondering what is reality and what is just going on in his head that's been planted there by the sick main demon spirit Ketcham, a psychologically wrecked man who took up residence at the property long before it was a house to be lived in. The tale of Ketcham in all his gory glory is another inspiring piece of this movie which has it all: modern effects that transform the original story into a hellish nightmare ride that will have you leaving all the lights on in your own house at night long after having watched it, excellent acting, the feeling that this could really happen, and of course, the house, which actually is not the original house but bears such an uncanny resemblance to it, aside from the extended porch, you would never suspect they are not one in the same.

924760,A31NE5DL1EVTFC,B000AA4JKW,"David OBrien ""Powerpop lover""","[1, 2]","I saw the Amityville remake last night. I absolutely loved the original even if it didn't age well over time. I think what made the original so good was that the characters who played the leads really looked frightened e.g. James Brolin ,Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger really conveyed fear in their eyes. The newer version stars Ryan Reynolds, who is more renowned for comedy and Melissa George, an Australian actress who started her career in daytime soaps. Philip Baker Hall plays the priest Fr Callaway. It would be unfair to describe the acting as incompetent, it isn't. My main problem is with the plot and the way the film unravels.The opening sequence shows the massacre of the DeFoe family by Ronnie the son who goes mad. This is quite a creepy sequence and uses similar imagery to the film Se7en. It sets the scene nicely. Then we cut forward to the Lutz family who snap up the property and are told of the house's history. After initial reluctance, they decide to move in and give it a go. Then the weird things start to happen like the apparition to the Lutz daughter of Jody Defoe, the girl who was murdered by her brother a year before. There are one or two jump out of the seat moments after this but I consider the film to be a wasted opportunity overallThe film turns into a budget version of The Shining , concentrating on the declining sanity of George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds. This insanity builds up until the end of the film where he comes to his senses and the family escape the house. In the original, the insanity of the Lutz father is only one of several episodes to befall the family in the house. Gone is the appearance of the demon pig, the secret room behind the fireplace painted in blood and other such episodes. Most disappointing was the brief appearance of Philip Baker Hall, an actor who is normally excellent at conveying distress (remember him as the dying quiz show host in Magnolia ?).I expected lots more from his appearance in the house than the swarm of flies attacking his face ?I suppose one of the main problem with the film is it's brevity. It clocks in at under 90 minutes in runtime.What starts out as a very eerie film ends up another shlock horror zombie film.

924762,AB8O0AVAF1MSD,B000AA4JKW,D. Clark,"[3, 6]","My first objection is that they didn't use the original house, instead opting for a house which lacks the sinister charachteristics of the original. But sadly, after viewing the movie, I realised this was only a minor flaw. What is the point of claiming the movie is based on a true story if you make up 98% of the movie? This so-called remake has little to do with the original, and even less to do with the book and the reported facts of what happened.The first mistake was getting Andrew Douglas to direct. By his own admission he doesn't believe in ghosts. That's fine. You don't have to believe in ghosts to make an effective ghost story, but if you're making one that is based on a true story, you should at least hire a director who believes the story to be true. Douglas directs the movie with an utter lack of passion and interest. He just doesn't seem to care about the story nor the charachters.I am huge fan of the original, but I do realise that even the original has it's share of flaws. But at least it sticks fairly close to the novel and the reports of what happened. The original also finds redemption in Lalo Schifrin's creepy and memorable score. However, Steve Jablonsky's score is anything but creepy and memorable. It's shamelessly weak, barely noticable, and utterly forgettable.The only reason why this excuse for a horror movie even merrits one star is due to two nicely executed scenes: The babysitter in the closet, and the little girl on the roof. These scenes are brilliantly edited and handled with suspense and tension. But sadly, to suspenseful scenes in a pile of garbage does not a good movie make.",1,PIECE OF CRAP!!!,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,1633,"['first', 'objection', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'original', 'house', 'instead', 'opting', 'house', 'sinister', 'charachteristics', 'original', 'sadly', 'viewing', 'movie', 'realised', 'was', 'only', 'minor', 'flaw', 'What', 'point', 'claiming', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'make', 'up', '98', '%', 'movie', 'so-called', 'remake', 'little', 'do', 'original', 'even', 'less', 'do', 'book', 'reported', 'facts', 'what', 'happened.The', 'first', 'mistake', 'was', 'getting', 'Andrew', 'Douglas', 'direct', 'own', 'admission', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghosts', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'make', 'effective', 'ghost', 'story', ""'re"", 'making', 'one', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'should', 'least', 'hire', 'director', 'who', 'story', 'be', 'true', 'Douglas', 'movie', 'utter', 'lack', 'passion', 'interest', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'story', 'charachters.I', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'do', 'realise', 'even', 'original', 'share', 'flaws', 'least', 'fairly', 'close', 'novel', 'reports', 'what', 'happened', 'original', 'also', 'redemption', 'Lalo', 'Schifrin', 'creepy', 'memorable', 'score', 'However', 'Steve', 'Jablonsky', 'score', 'anything', 'creepy', 'memorable', 'shamelessly', 'weak', 'barely', 'noticable', 'utterly', 'forgettable.The', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'excuse', 'horror', 'movie', 'even', 'one', 'star', 'due', 'two', 'nicely', 'executed', 'scenes', 'babysitter', 'closet', 'little', 'girl', 'roof', 'scenes', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'edited', 'handled', 'suspense', 'tension', 'sadly', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'pile', 'garbage', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make']",The Amityville Horror
924763,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B000AA4JKW,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","For the sake of getting it ""out there,"" I thought the original was corn pone supreme.  (Who can forget, even though I know I've tried, the image of James Brolin sitting in that chair, pulling at his hair, and screaming, ""Mother of God!  I'm falling apart!""  Blech.)  So this 2005 remake of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR at least gets some kudos for some disturbing images and goose-bump-inducing special effects.  We should all be familiar with the ""true"" story of a family of 6 getting brutally murdered in November of 1974 in an old, gothic, colonial house in Amityville, Long Island.  And a year later, a young family moves in. . .and proceeds to cross into the major dysfunction dimension, with George, the patriarch (Ryan Reynolds), losing the most marbles.  It's all predictable, and often silly, but if you just go with the flow it's more or less a palatable supernatural adventure.Ryan Reynolds has at least ten (count 'em) layers of annoyance; in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, to my delight, his annoyance layer is at but two or three.  I think he's a better fit for a genre like this than all those nutball comedies he did a decade ago, but I digress.  He's paired with a very stunning Melissa George playing George's wife, Kathy Lutz.  The Lutz children are played by Jesse James, Jimmy Bennett, and Chloe Grace Moretz.  There's a wrinkle here in that the children's actual biological father has died, so George is getting to know his stepchildren--in a haunted house, which is a recipe for malfunction and mayhem.  George begins to feel the ill effects of the house almost immediately, while the children are all affected differently, from seeing and hearing disturbing spooks in the bathroom, to making invisible friends.  But again, we all know where this is headed, with the house ultimately winning, taking George to the brink of killing his family, and an over-the-top ending with a shotgun and an axe that's fitting for this genre.  It's uneven, with its share of good and lame, but at least this version of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR does not lend itself to the outright comedy of its predecessor.--D. Mikels, Esq.",3,Has Its Moments.

924765,A2G39KAEO73GVC,B000AA4JKW,echoes999,"[0, 1]","I was never a big fan of the original 70's movie. It was slow, mostly uneventful with so-so acting and not much horror for my tastes. Many felt it was more of a psychological film and created its scares through that, but I never felt that movie ever rose to that kind of terror. Hearing about this remake I was interested but figured it would probably be close to the original, and therefore not very interesting to me. Once I saw the preview though and after finding out is was made in part by the writer and producer of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I wanted to see it. And I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed.The movie follows a family, the Lutz's, as they move into a new house for a sorid past. A year early the son of the previous owners went a little crazy because of the hauntings and voices in his head, and systematically went from room to room shooting his parents and four siblings in the head with a rifle. The father George(Ryan Reynolds) is married to a woman with three children from a previous marriage and none of the kids have really taken to him yet. Reynolds who must will remember from Nation Lampoon's Van Wilder and most recently Blade Trinity does an excellent job in his role. This is far from a comedic performance and Reynolds shows he does have some acting chops.From his first day in the house George is constantly cold and early on the house begins to weigh down on him. He hears creaking, radios that aren't plugged in. The boat house keeps getting unlocked and the dog won't stop bothering him. Soon he's freaking out at the kids and losing his cool with his wife as he quickly spirals down into his own personnel hell created by the house and its past. The youngest daughter meanwhile meets a new friend, the ghost Jody who was the youngest sibling murdered a year before. She's a fairly nice ghost when the bad man of the house isn't making her do bad things.Soon the daughter is fully envolved with the ghost and George is chopping wood like a madman to keep himself warm, as well as sleeping down in the basement where he thinks the only warm place is. He's also hearing more voices and piecing together the ugly past the house has. Meanwhile the mother is trying to keep her family together as best she can, although it doesn't work that well. It all leads up to an entertaing ending where George starts seeing demons in his family and we learn what really happened at the house when it was first built. It ends with a crazy George trying to hack up his family in The Shinning style as they try and escape him and the possesed house.The acting is very well done in this movie and it has several decent scares. There's a great scene with a not so smart babysitter and the priest who tries to help the family out. And yes the fly scene with the priest is in here, and its still good. The movie builds up the scares through great pacing and an entertaining story. It's about in the middle when it comes to the gore, not to much but not too little either. The ghosts look great too and I found this film much more enjoyable than the original as well as current films like the Ring 2 and The Grudge. I reccomend going and seeing this great film right away.",4,A surprisingly good remake,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,3202,"['was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'original', '70', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'mostly', 'uneventful', 'so-so', 'acting', 'not', 'much', 'horror', 'tastes', 'Many', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'psychological', 'film', 'created', 'scares', 'never', 'felt', 'movie', 'ever', 'rose', 'kind', 'terror', 'Hearing', 'remake', 'was', 'interested', 'figured', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'close', 'original', 'therefore', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'Once', 'saw', 'preview', 'finding', 'out', 'was', 'made', 'part', 'writer', 'producer', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remake', 'wanted', 'see', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.The', 'movie', 'family', 'Lutz', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'sorid', 'past', 'year', 'early', 'son', 'previous', 'owners', 'went', 'little', 'crazy', 'hauntings', 'voices', 'head', 'systematically', 'went', 'room', 'room', 'shooting', 'parents', 'four', 'siblings', 'head', 'rifle', 'father', 'George', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'married', 'woman', 'three', 'children', 'previous', 'marriage', 'none', 'kids', 'have', 'really', 'taken', 'yet', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'must', 'will', 'remember', 'Nation', 'Lampoon', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'most', 'recently', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'far', 'comedic', 'performance', 'Reynolds', 'have', 'acting', 'chops.From', 'first', 'day', 'house', 'George', 'constantly', 'cold', 'early', 'house', 'weigh', 'down', 'creaking', 'radios', 'are', ""n't"", 'plugged', 'boat', 'house', 'getting', 'unlocked', 'dog', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'bothering', 'freaking', 'out', 'kids', 'losing', 'cool', 'wife', 'quickly', 'spirals', 'down', 'own', 'personnel', 'hell', 'created', 'house', 'past', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'meanwhile', 'new', 'friend', 'ghost', 'Jody', 'who', 'was', 'youngest', 'sibling', 'murdered', 'year', 'before', 'fairly', 'nice', 'ghost', 'when', 'bad', 'man', 'house', ""n't"", 'making', 'do', 'bad', 'things.Soon', 'daughter', 'fully', 'envolved', 'ghost', 'George', 'chopping', 'wood', 'madman', 'keep', 'warm', 'as', 'well', 'sleeping', 'down', 'basement', 'where', 'only', 'warm', 'place', 'also', 'hearing', 'more', 'voices', 'piecing', 'together', 'ugly', 'house', 'Meanwhile', 'mother', 'trying', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'best', 'can', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'up', 'entertaing', 'ending', 'where', 'George', 'seeing', 'demons', 'family', 'learn', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'house', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'built', 'crazy', 'George', 'trying', 'hack', 'up', 'family', 'Shinning', 'style', 'try', 'escape', 'possesed', 'house.The', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'several', 'decent', 'scares', 'great', 'scene', 'not', 'so', 'smart', 'babysitter', 'priest', 'who', 'help', 'family', 'yes', 'fly', 'scene', 'priest', 'here', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'up', 'scares', 'great', 'pacing', 'entertaining', 'story', 'middle', 'when', 'gore', 'not', 'much', 'not', 'too', 'little', 'either', 'ghosts', 'look', 'great', 'too', 'found', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'current', 'films', 'Ring', '2', 'Grudge', 'reccomend', 'going', 'seeing', 'great', 'film', 'right', 'away']",The Amityville Horror

Actually, I thought all of the performances in this movie were great!My only problem with the movie is the very last scene.  I just don't understand what the point was in showing the dead girl standing there all creepy, and then being sucked into the floor.  I could see it having been put in somewhere while the action was still taking place, but not at the very last scene where happiness has been introduced.  I know, I know...

924769,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,B000AA4JKW,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[1, 4]","Back in the 70s when I was a kid, I devoured horror books and movies.  I remember reading Jay Anson's ""true"" book on the Amityville haunting and being totally freaked out.  So when the original movie hit theaters, I had to see it.  I cajoled my older brother into taking me to a late night showing.  I was so scared that I kept my feet off the theater floor for the entire show, and I didn't sleep much that week.  I believe that Stephen King wrote that he sensed genuine fear in audiences who caught the first ""Amityville Horror.""Too bad the remake doesn't live up to its predecessor.  Of course, the basic plot is the same.  In the mid-1970s, the Lutz family moves into a huge house that would normally be out of their price range.  It doesn't take them long to find out why they got such a good deal.  Seems a young man brutally murdered his parents and four younger siblings there the year before.  And they ain't resting in peace.  Supernatural hijinks ensue, and the Lutz's end up fighting for their lives.The cast is OK (except for the ineffectual priest who's facial expression never seems to change no matter what happens).  However, this movie fails on a number of levels.  For one, it's a pointless remake.  It would take a lot to top the original, which had superior actors and relied on old-fashioned scares.  Speaking of the fear factor (or lack thereof), this time around the producers decided to throw subtlety out the door.

This is perhaps because I never thought the original was a very good movie, but still, it doesn't matter. The original Amityville Horror is definitely not a benchmark in Horror cinema, and I think a great deal of the praise heaped upon it is ridiculous. Anyone remember the horribly campy scene where the priest goes blind (or the upside down cross)? It was a cheezy movie, and that was part of the reason it was fun.This movie is silly as well, but it's actually scary and it makes you jump at a few points. It's kind of a joke that it pretends to be ""based upon a true story,"" since this story bears very little resemblence to the (already grossly exaggerated and unimpressive) book by Jay Anson. It was also NOT endorsed by George Lutz, the subject of the movie, who claims that the makers of the film did not even inform him of their intent to remake it. When he inquired about the project, he was sent a lawsuit and was ordered to not speak publicly about his objections.I can definitely understand why he'd be mad about it, since it portrays him in a horribly bad light. Unlike the original (or the book), George becomes a villain in the new movie.All that aside, it's a fun ghost story, and it's effective and creepy up until the last 30 minutes, where IMO it all falls apart in a really rushed and unfortunate Shining-rip-off. Still, it's a fun, scary, moderately campy movie that's good for  a Halloween rental.

Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[1, 3]","A remake to the 1979 horror film The Amityville Horror, and based on the true events of a 28-day stay in  a haunted house and the best seller of the same name; in this day and age, a house just isn't scary enough.  So the writer's of this remake add a torture chamber in the basement, and quick-cuts of gruesome tortured souls to add spice and horror to this very overdone classic tale of suburbia gone awry.  To date, nine (9) Amityville tales of horror have been told on film since 1979, each worst than the one prior, and I have to admit; that this remake does not break with tradition....In this go around, Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George star as George and Kathy Lutz; a middle class couple who find the house of their dreams amid the country side in the quiet town of Amityville, New York, a peaceful enclave on Long Island's south shore.  Unbeknownst to our happy couple, that almost one year prior to the date of purchase, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. had committed mass murder of his parents and family in the very same house.  Citing demon possession, DeFeo claimed the house was haunted.  After twenty-eight days of residing in the house, George and Kathy Lutz fled their Amityville dream home for the very same reason.The funny thing about this film is that 26 years after the fact; it turns out that the whole kit-and-caboodle was a scam orchestrated by George Lutz to merely get out from under a mortgage that he couldn't afford.  So why not tell that story?  A story so grand that it took a national by surprised, and spawn 9 theatrical sequels.  Oh well, who am I to suggest something so devious, and unquestionably dishonest?  Just a thought.....This film is hardly worth noting, it fails on both fronts; it's not scary, nor is it a documentary to the events which occurred.  Its Hollywood fluff for the fast buck, so we're probably in store for a tenth serial in the near future depending on boxoffice receipts and DVD rentals.[...]",2,"Borrow from a Buddy, because it's not worth it yourself....",1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,1940,"['remake', '1979', 'horror', 'film', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'based', 'true', 'events', '28-day', 'stay', 'haunted', 'house', 'best', 'seller', 'same', 'name', 'day', 'age', 'house', 'just', ""n't"", 'scary', 'enough', 'writer', 'remake', 'add', 'torture', 'chamber', 'basement', 'quick-cuts', 'gruesome', 'tortured', 'souls', 'add', 'spice', 'horror', 'very', 'overdone', 'classic', 'tale', 'suburbia', 'gone', 'awry', 'date', 'nine', '9', 'Amityville', 'tales', 'horror', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'film', '1979', 'worst', 'one', 'prior', 'have', 'admit', 'remake', 'not', 'break', 'tradition', '.In', 'go', 'around', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Melissa', 'George', 'star', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'middle', 'class', 'couple', 'who', 'find', 'house', 'dreams', 'country', 'side', 'quiet', 'town', 'Amityville', 'New', 'York', 'peaceful', 'enclave', 'Long', 'Island', 'south', 'shore', 'Unbeknownst', 'happy', 'couple', 'almost', 'one', 'year', 'prior', 'date', 'purchase', 'Ronald', 'DeFeo', 'Jr.', 'had', 'committed', 'mass', 'murder', 'parents', 'family', 'very', 'same', 'house', 'Citing', 'demon', 'possession', 'DeFeo', 'claimed', 'house', 'was', 'haunted', 'twenty-eight', 'days', 'residing', 'house', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'fled', 'Amityville', 'dream', 'home', 'very', 'same', 'reason.The', 'funny', 'thing', 'film', '26', 'years', 'fact', 'out', 'whole', 'kit-and-caboodle', 'was', 'scam', 'orchestrated', 'George', 'Lutz', 'merely', 'get', 'out', 'mortgage', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'A', 'story', 'so', 'grand', 'took', 'national', 'surprised', 'spawn', '9', 'theatrical', 'sequels', 'Oh', 'well', 'who', 'am', 'suggest', 'something', 'so', 'devious', 'unquestionably', 'dishonest', 'Just', 'thought', '..This', 'film', 'hardly', 'worth', 'noting', 'fronts', 'not', 'scary', 'documentary', 'events', 'occurred', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'fast', 'buck', ""'re"", 'probably', 'store', 'tenth', 'serial', 'near', 'future', 'depending', 'boxoffice', 'receipts', 'DVD', 'rentals.', '[', ']']",The Amityville Horror

I was hoping the remake would be fairly decent, and you have a the necessary element there--i.e. creepy house--and I hoped that they would throw out a lot of the ""adherence to the facts"" that made the original such a bore and retool it to make it actually scary. But no. What's most disappointing about this movie is how, even though they changed the events, it remains pretty much the exact same movie, just turned up a notch.I was not bored or unentertained during the 90 minutes I spent in the theater, but for me, there's nothing here that's scary. What horror [the genre] has devolved into as it becomes more popular--essentially a bunch of empty ""Boo!"" scares--just isn't scary to me. But for a film to have an effect it has to have TIME to build an effect [not to mention atmosphere or thematic resonance] and this is not possible in a country that increasingly has no attention span. Here some face or creepy something appears onscreen with a crashing noise every five minutes, lest anyone get ""bored.""But... aren't you BORED with those idiotic scares?I won't go on too long here, as there's no point. If you like these kind of scares, you get what you deserve.Incredibly, there's not even any interest to be had in comparing the two versions.The only point of interest to the film is the way they've redesigned the house. They added an entire floor to the bottom that is a glassed-in porch [I was thinking ""Jeez... and I never have time to wash my THREE windows""], which doesn't accomplish much and is used to no purpose, but it does make the house taller and narrower. The exteriors and the interiors do not really match, as they've made the house so tall and narrow to emphasize its scariness. The interiors are also designed to be unusually tall and narrow. This isn't much, but at least it's a kind of clever cinematic sleight-of-hand, and truly is the only clever thing about the entire film. It is most noticeable when the dippy little girl goes out on the roof for no other reason than that we need a sequence of peril; you can see that the roof is pitched at a very steep angle that doesn't match the interior at all. Whatever, at least they tried something somewhat interesting.On the last day the family spent in the house, the wife is at the library before it opens in the morning, does some research, visits the priest, but by the time she goes home [seemingly around noon] it is the dark of night, because the climax has to happen at night. Huh. Ghostly forces, I guess.Mildly entertaining, like cinematic potato chips, not scary, not interesting, devoid of subtext.

924778,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000AA4JKW,Ghoulie Guru,"[1, 4]","** possible spoilers ahead **By ""borer"" I mean that it will bore you to death before it horrifies you. It's a shame too, I actually liked the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre that was done by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes company. I was hoping that this would be similar, but the only similarity is that they are both remakes of horror movies from the 70's.To be fair, it's not like the original Amityville Horror was anything great. It, like the remake, borrowed heavily from other successful ghost stories of the time to try and capitalize on some of their success. No one will ever be able to convince me that George Lutz carrying around an axe in the original was not a direct rip-off of Stephen King's crochet mallet wielding villain in The Shining. I know, the film version of The Shining came out a year after the original Amityville Horror, but Stephen King wrote the novel of the Shining several years before the Amityville Horror book was written (or should I say plagiarized?)In the same fashion, this remake borrows heavily from the ghost stories that seem to be successful right now. Namely, the J-horror aesthetic of the little girl ghost. It worked in the Ring, and it worked in the Grudge, so it will work in Amityville Horror, right? Well, to be blunt... no. It didn't work. In fact, it felt like the blatant rip-off that it was.But like I said, the original film borrowed from other ghost stories of the period, so does the remake. That's not the worst part of this movie, and that's not why I hate this movie so much.Where this movie goes wrong is that absolutely nothing happens until the last ten minutes of the film. The original had the same problem, but you'd hope that we would learn something in 25 years. No such luck. The main scares in the first hour of the movie are: Magnets rearrange themselves on the fridge, little girl goes into the boat house alone, little girl climbs up onto the roof, George Lutz complains of it being cold, George chops wood. I'm not kidding. There's no body count to this movie. Other than the DeFeo family, that gets killed in the first five minutes, there is not a single casualty.Which brings me to another thing that I hate about this movie. Does everyone know the true story of the Amityville Horror? It's not all that frightening unless you consider how depraved and ugly George and Kathy Lutz really were.George and Kathy bought a house they couldn't afford, a place where a mentally deranged kid named Ronnie DeFeo had shot his whole family. George and Kathy knew about the murders, they had a friend come over with pictures of the crime scene and they fabricated a whole haunted house story to help them GET OUT of their mortgage. Then they sold this ridiculous fiction as a book and a movie. They have made millions off of the DeFeo family tragedy. I find that a little disgusting. That's the TRUE STORY.But regardless of the truth, what's done is done. I hope that any surviving members of the DeFeo family sue everyone involved for defamation of character or something.Doing something stupid like giving millions of dollars to a con artist would be one thing, but then to make a really boring movie that's not even remotely entertaining is just a plain disgrace.

924781,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AA4JKW,Grady Harp,"[0, 1]","Just the name of this film constitutes a long sigh - 'How many times are they going to make this hokey story into yet another film?' And yet the current team of director Andrew Douglas, screenwriter Scott Kosar (based on Jay Anson's novel) and a cast of fresh faces to the genre carry off this much told tale with vigor and a good dollop of tension.For starters the film opens with the re-enactment of the 'actual crime'.  Apparently in 1974 Ronald DeFeo (here Brendan Donaldson) murdered his parents and siblings in a terrific old house in Amityville, NY. One year later the Lutz family discovers their dream house and buys it outright, opening their next 28 days to visions of ghosts, terror, demons, hallucinations and pathological changes among themselves until they finally flee the haunted house.From the start we know that contractor George Lutz - Ryan Reynolds - (the new husband of Kathy) - Melissa George - has problems establishing himself as the 'stepfather' to reluctant children Billy (Jesse James), Michael (Jimmy Bennett) and Chelsea (Chlo Grace Moretz).  Once the family is ensconced in the house Chelsea begins to play with the ghost of Jodie DeFeo (Isabel Conner) and George's personality changes as a result of the  house's curse.  It all comes down to terror in the requisite thunder, lightning and rain of all horror films until the family hits crisis state and leaves the house behind.The ghost effects are well done and the cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister and the musical score by  Steve Jablonsky  create a dark, ominous atmosphere.  But the real reason to watch this little thriller is the work of Ryan Reynolds as George, released from his usual silly potty mouth roles in teenie films  to show that he indeed can act, and keep his own brand of edgy humor intact - and that is no slight feat. Fortunately he is given the opportunity to display his extraordinarily hunky physique throughout the film, reason enough to see the movie!  Melissa George is likewise excellent as the tortured mother and is a perfect foil for Reynolds.  Not a great film, but certainly one that exceeds expectations set by previous forays into this overused story.

924784,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B000AA4JKW,Haunted Flower,"[2, 4]","Blu-ray/DVD combo, released September 14, 2010""The Amityville Horror"" was made in 2005 as a remake of a film made in 1979. This was directed by Andrew Douglas but the man behind the curtain is producer, Michael Bay who had a great deal of say in how this film was made. It stars Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George as George and Kathy Lutz who have found an amazing house in their price range and are prepared to move in with three young children and a dog but there is a problem -- this house has a history of murder.What follows is a story that feels beat for beat like Stephen King's ""The Shining."" In a family already on their guard around George since he is the new stepfather and the kids don't want him to replace their deceased father, George begins to hear voices from the house telling him to kill his family.Ryan Reynolds took great care in getting AB-tastic for this role due to all the necessary shirtless wood-chopping involved (which according to commentary was all him for hours on end). What Reynolds has become known for over the years has been the ""jerk"" comedy roles and this was one of his first detours into drama even if it's drama-horror. Given how built he is here, he is an intimidating presence once he goes bad dad.Melissa George's Kathy goes from confident woman with her man wrapped around her pinky to whimpering dependent woman whose man emotionally and maybe eventually physically abuses her within a matter of minutes. I found myself asking, where did that other woman go? In ""The Shining"", clearly the mother had no other options but to try and make it work due to being snowed in at a remote location, but here they are close to town so why is she acting like a scared rabbit all the time instead of sitting down to have a conversation with her mutant hubby? I usually really like Melissa George (see my review of ""Triangle"") but here all she really does is master her scared face.Introducing young Chloe Moretz! This was the first time I'd ever seen this film, but I could hardly contain my enthusiasm when Hit Girl arrived on the screen. She plays Chelsea who has begun speaking of an imaginary friend hanging out with her which may be a ghost of a little girl killed in the house. No wonder her career has taken off because she nails every scene and had the guts to actually be up on top of the roof of a house for one scene. She is joined by brothers played by Jesse James and Jimmy Bennett (who recently played a young Kirk in ""Star Trek"").The other notable character is the short-lived babysitter played by Rachel Nichols who proves there are no small parts. Her presence fills up the screen from the first moment until her untimely demise in an exciting closet scene.All in all, there were some great moments here from Moretz and Nichols and if you have the need to stare at Reynolds' abs (I don't), but otherwise this movie feels so cookie cutter to ""The Shining"" that I found it way predictable. The only chilling sentiment here is that it is based on a true story, as in some of the opening footage of the original crimes that took place in the famous Amityville house is genuine and they tried to use facts where they could. What is known is that Ronald DeFeo, Jr. shot and killed six members of his family, thirteen months later the Lutzes moved in, and apparently moved out after 28 days claiming terrorizing by paranormal activity according to ""The Amityville Horror: A True Story"" written by Jay Anson which has been found controversial and led to some lawsuits.As much as Shelley Duvall's performance in ""The Shining"" makes me want to stick a fork in her and cheer for Jack Nicholson, go watch that movie instead if you want a real scare. That movie is FREAKY.Bonus Features:There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray. The ones attempted to boast about on the back cover are standard with any Blu-ray disc like 1080p and Smart Menu technology.The DVD has several deleted scenes, multi-angle on set peeks, and a photo gallery. The ""Supernatural Homicide"" is a study of what really happened in the actual story of the DeFeo murders and what people believe. Most people believe he killed them, end of story. One woman who supposedly specializes in the paranormal speaks about the presence she feels in the house and that in her expert opinion, it is definitely haunted. Cast members of the film talk about whether or not they believe in ghosts. ""The Source of Evil"" is a making-of featurette which proves how bad ass Chloe Moretz was before ""Kick Ass"" came out. In her very first movie, she was willing to go on top of a very tall house with a few wires for a scene.There is also audio commentary by Ryan Reynolds and some producers where Reynolds takes the lead on why he wanted his career to go in a slightly different direction and show some range and the producers fawn over his athleticism for the film pointing out everything he did himself from chopping wood to breaking down a door to sticking his hands very close to maggots.

I was expecting a movie similiar to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the new one), but that wasn't at all what I got. I enjoyed the Chainsaw Massacre but this movie just bugged me. WHY DON'T THEY GET OUT OF THE HOUSE???? The acting is good enough, with Ryan Reynolds' eyes very effective. The rest of the family was fine too. But, this movie first of all wasn't scary at all. The director tried way too hard to show scary scenes that weren't at all. Right off the bat, they move into this gigantic house for an insanely low price...what's the catch? Oh, nothing really..ONLY A WHOLE FAMILY GETTING MURDERED THERE 1 YEAR AGO! The movie threw nonstop random stuff to make you jump which didn't work for me. On top of it, this family was so stupid! I mean their IQ must be lower than an infant! Why don't they leave? I mean, that really peeved me of. The movie also was very stupid and just not a good horror movie whatsoever.THere was one very neat scene that was creepy right during the babysitting scene. So that was really pretty cool. But you know, this movie was just a big budget, stupid horror movie like the grudge and the ring.

So Hollywood puts out another Remake? - so whats the verdict? I always thought the original was a really scary film.... and this one..although it didnt give me the same creepiness it still was a worthy opponent. Some of the new special effects added were effective, and of course they messed with the script again to yet give another variant. The back history part that was added, didnt make for better story-telling...so to leave it alone would have been better.  In my opinion the part where the house tells the priest to ""GET OUT"" lacked the power of the original...which was a rememorable part.

What is a fact and is the true story of this house is that on November 13, 1974, the son of the De Feo Family killed all six members of his family inside the house at 112 Ocean Blvd.  It is the psychics, real estate agents and other others of the real house that claim eerie phenomenon has occurred and thus the story of the Amityville Horror house continues.Many sequels were made, the latter sequels were low-budget and mediocre.The first film, ""The Amityville Horror"" (1979) starred James Brolin and Margot Kidder and is way better than this 2005 remake starring Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George.George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) is becoming a stepfather to a family of three kids (Jesse James, Jimmy Bennett, Chloe Grace Moretz) with his new wife, Kathy (Melissa George).  Today, is the day they look for a new house together.  They are jazzed about the Amityville house on Ocean Blvd.  The real estate agent (Annabel Armour) they met takes them on a tour and she actually sees a ghost in the other room as she gives her monologue, but she remains cool and calm about it, not wanting Kathy and George to know as they haven't yet a clue about what happened in this house.  As soon as they have moved in, they will experience the most unnerving phenomenon.DVD includes in Special Features, audio commentary with Ryan Reynolds and producers, 7 1/2 minutes of deleted scenes, ""Supernatural Homicide"" is a 2005 re-creation of crime photos and footage.

Why? you ask, well the original was over 2 hours and didn't need to be, and the acting was pretty poor, this version cuts the time down to 88 minutes and the acting is much, much better. George Lutz was played well by Ryan Reynolds, one of the hotter actors in Hollywood, and deserved, he has a special charisma and charm, plus he's a pretty damn good actor. It doesn't hurt that he has an incredible body with abs any man would kill for, and in his last 2 movies (Blade 3 and this one)he is constantly running around without a shirt on, much to my wife and women everywhere's delight. Melissa George does a pretty good Margot Kidder, but it's the children that really steal the show. The younger daughter is excellent, as she is the one who can see Jody, one of the girls shot in the house, and Jody is not a very nice little girl, check out the scene with the babysitter locked in the closet, awesome segment.The two sons are also strong, the older one has some intense scenes with Reynolds chopping wood, which is very creepy in a subdued sorta way.My problems with the film? not too much, but the CG during the famous ""flies"" scene is a little weak and the ending is a bit anti-climatic, but those are both minor flaws in an over-all fun horror movie.In recent years, remakes are coming out all over the place, Bewitched, Longest Yard, Bad News Bears, Charlie and the Chocolate factory, and must are a major disaster, but this one succeeds and it was nice to see.

924795,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000AA4JKW,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[0, 0]","In the fall of 1975, George and Kathy Lutz moved into a home in Amityville, New York.  It was their dream to own their own home and settle down with their children.  However, the house they chose to buy held a deep, dark secret; the previous family, the DeFeo's, were murdered in the same house by their eldest son, Ronnie.Undeterred by this news, the Lutz family still bought the house and moved in.  Almost immediately, strange things began to happen.  Chelsea, the youngest girl, develops an ""imaginary"" friend named Jody, which happened to be the same name as the youngest DeFeo child.  George is cold all the time, and he awakens at 3:15 in the morning each day, the same time as the DeFeo murders.  George is also hearing voices in his head saying ""kill them""; similiar to what Ronnie DeFeo heard.  Finally, the priest that is summoned by Kathy to bless the house is told to ""get out"" by the evil presence, and he is set upon by a swarm of flies.  After twenty eight days of strange and unexplainable events, the family fled Amityville; never to return to the house for their possessions.Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George give good performances as George and Kathy Lutz.  However, I preferred James Brolin and Margot Kidder form the first movie.  Also, I felt that there was a little too much blood and gore in this movie. The first movie relied more on psychological terror to scare the viewers.  Rod Steiger's role as the priest in the first movie is much better, too.Overall, I did enjoy this movie, but I felt that it deviated too much from the first movie and the book.  The acting is good, but there was just a little too much blood and guts for my liking.  Also, I felt the beginning, which showed the DeFeo killings, was very chilling to watch.  I recommend this movie, but maybe watch the original version first before watching this one.",4,"Scary, But Not Quite as Good as the Original",1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,1851,"['fall', '1975', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'moved', 'home', 'Amityville', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'dream', 'own', 'own', 'home', 'settle', 'down', 'children', 'However', 'house', 'chose', 'buy', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'previous', 'family', 'DeFeo', 'were', 'murdered', 'same', 'house', 'eldest', 'son', 'Ronnie.Undeterred', 'news', 'Lutz', 'family', 'still', 'bought', 'house', 'moved', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'strange', 'things', 'began', 'happen', 'Chelsea', 'youngest', 'girl', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Jody', 'happened', 'be', 'same', 'name', 'youngest', 'DeFeo', 'child', 'George', 'cold', 'time', '3:15', 'morning', 'day', 'same', 'time', 'DeFeo', 'murders', 'George', 'also', 'hearing', 'voices', 'head', 'saying', 'kill', 'similiar', 'what', 'Ronnie', 'DeFeo', 'heard', 'Finally', 'priest', 'summoned', 'Kathy', 'bless', 'house', 'told', 'get', 'out', 'evil', 'presence', 'set', 'swarm', 'flies', 'twenty', 'eight', 'days', 'strange', 'unexplainable', 'events', 'family', 'fled', 'Amityville', 'never', 'return', 'house', 'possessions.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Melissa', 'George', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'However', 'preferred', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'form', 'first', 'movie', 'Also', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'blood', 'gore', 'movie', 'first', 'movie', 'relied', 'more', 'psychological', 'terror', 'scare', 'viewers', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'role', 'priest', 'first', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'too.Overall', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'felt', 'deviated', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'movie', 'book', 'acting', 'good', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'blood', 'guts', 'liking', 'Also', 'felt', 'beginning', 'showed', 'DeFeo', 'killings', 'was', 'very', 'chilling', 'watch', 'recommend', 'movie', 'maybe', 'watch', 'original', 'version', 'first', 'before', 'watching', 'one']",The Amityville Horror
924796,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000AA4JKW,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","This movie remake was pretty good. Even though I saw the original movie and knew what was coming, I did jump out of my seat a few times for it also put a chill up my spin.There were several scary scenes that were excellent; ""The Amityville Horror"" delivers just that, fast pacing and some pretty effective jumps by using some cheap shock effects. Since this is a remake it is forgivable that it doesn't come up with anything remotely new or original. There's the ever so familiar haunted house, Dad losing his mind, heads shaking &agrave; la Jacob's Ladder, weird shadows moving fast and making insect sounds and the more than overused spooky little girl (really, having such a kid in another horror movie is idiotic and didn't even make much sense in this particular movie). Still, all that makes for an uneasy atmosphere and there's one scene in the bathroom that's set up gloriously, toying cleverly with a classic childhood fear (going to the toilet in the middle of the night in a dark and spooky house). Another great scene is the one with the babysitter in the closet then soon encounters with the ghost.The director, Andrew Douglas, did a good job by showing little differences in George's attitude and demeanor once he was out of the house. Ryan Reynolds also did a good job of portraying this to the viewers. He has come a long way. Melissa George could also leave her mark in Hollywood if the right roles come along for her. I was pretty impressed by her performance almost as much as Ryan's.While not the best of its genre, ""The Amityville Horror"" has it's place amongst horror movies. It is worth seeing, as you can do much worse if you do not do your homework.",4,The Amityville Horror is much better than some other remakes.,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,1674,"['movie', 'remake', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Even', 'saw', 'original', 'movie', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'did', 'jump', 'seat', 'few', 'times', 'also', 'put', 'chill', 'up', 'spin.There', 'were', 'several', 'scary', 'scenes', 'were', 'excellent', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'delivers', 'just', 'fast', 'pacing', 'pretty', 'effective', 'jumps', 'using', 'cheap', 'shock', 'effects', 'remake', 'forgivable', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'remotely', 'new', 'original', 'ever', 'so', 'familiar', 'haunted', 'house', 'Dad', 'losing', 'mind', 'heads', 'shaking', 'agrave', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'weird', 'shadows', 'moving', 'fast', 'making', 'insect', 'sounds', 'more', 'overused', 'spooky', 'little', 'girl', 'really', 'having', 'such', 'kid', 'horror', 'movie', 'idiotic', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'particular', 'movie', 'Still', 'uneasy', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'set', 'up', 'gloriously', 'toying', 'cleverly', 'classic', 'childhood', 'fear', 'going', 'toilet', 'middle', 'night', 'dark', 'spooky', 'house', 'great', 'scene', 'one', 'babysitter', 'closet', 'then', 'soon', 'encounters', 'ghost.The', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Douglas', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'little', 'differences', 'George', 'attitude', 'demeanor', 'once', 'was', 'house', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'viewers', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Melissa', 'George', 'could', 'also', 'leave', 'mark', 'Hollywood', 'right', 'roles', 'come', 'along', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'performance', 'almost', 'as', 'much', ""Ryan's.While"", 'not', 'best', 'genre', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'place', 'amongst', 'horror', 'movies', 'worth', 'seeing', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'homework']",The Amityville Horror
924797,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000AA4JKW,J from NY,"[4, 5]","The remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" is nothing spectacular, and doesn't live up remotely to the raw force of the original (which itself was only above average), but it has moments.  Essentially, this is what the filmmakers decided to do:remake a horror film from the 70's and add some new images to it, making sure to throw in the necessary up-and-coming celebrities.  Not entirely unpleasant, the film has a few genuinely frightening moments: ""Look what Ronnie did to me"", the young victim's ghost whispers as she places a stoned, ill-willed babysitter's finger into the bulletwound in her ghastly skin.  These moments are few and far between, however, and I can see no real justification for the making of this film.  Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George are unremarkable and hurried in their ""transformation"" from (sort of) a happy, very much in love couple to two individuals falling apart as the result of a diseased house.  The children in the film who are killed at the beginning, and who later appear as ghosts, seem less annoying then the ones we have to watch the whole movie in the flesh and blood.  Philip Baker Hall's performance as Father Callaway is disappointing and shallow, not holding a candle to Steiger's role in the original.  After it stops being scary (that doesn't take long) and the same hackneyed ""demon"" devices are rewound in various ways throughout the film, it can't help but occur to one that Hollywood directors are running fresh out of ideas for horror movies.  A dull, unimaginative lot they must be: with the exception of Brad Anderson (""Session 9"", ""The Machinist), who I believe may be our last hope in this decaying genre.Plus, ""Amityville"" was always the weakest film in the odd Satanic Renaissance they had in 70's film.  It sat on the sideline beside ""The Omen"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""The Exorcist"".  These three films gave us quite a fright because each one has some possibility about it, something that transcends the petty and reaches right into our gut: the biblically predicted child of Satan finally being born, the story of a possession that actually occured and has never been proven to be a fraud, and Polanski's genius combined with Ira Levin's power as a novelist: ""Amityville"" had none of these factors backing it up.  A suspension of disbelief is fine, but a willingness to participate in a hoax is another thing entirely: George and Kathy Lutz were con artists who moved into the house knowing precisely what had happened there with the intention of making lots of money by claiming it was haunted.  They themselves even ended up recanting parts of it.For anyone who doesn't know, the whole matter was debunked by the Catholic Diocese of Rockville and William Weber, the lawyer for Ronald Defeo himself.  People have lived in that house since:tables do not fly around, dishes don't crash, and nothing but the standard foulness sits in the toilet.  The young man who shot his family to death was a generic psychopath who had been using drugs near the time of the slayings, lied pathologically, and enjoyed what he did thoroughly by his own admission.  The Defeo family was alcoholic and dysfunctional.  On the stand he claimed demonic possession and a host of other invented ailments:insanity, personality disorders, a dissociative condition, none of which he actually had.  The real ""horror"" of this whole thing is Ronnie himself.  That is the true story.I would, though, recommend ""Amityville Horror II:The Possession"".  It is an overlooked gem.So much for the magic, eh?",2,Nothing to scream about,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,3528,"['remake', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'nothing', 'spectacular', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'remotely', 'raw', 'force', 'original', 'was', 'only', 'above', 'average', 'moments', 'Essentially', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'do', 'remake', 'horror', 'film', '70', 'add', 'new', 'images', 'making', 'sure', 'throw', 'necessary', 'up-and-coming', 'celebrities', 'Not', 'entirely', 'unpleasant', 'film', 'few', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'moments', 'Look', 'what', 'Ronnie', 'did', 'young', 'victim', 'ghost', 'whispers', 'stoned', 'ill-willed', 'babysitter', 'finger', 'bulletwound', 'ghastly', 'skin', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'however', 'can', 'see', 'real', 'justification', 'making', 'film', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Melissa', 'George', 'are', 'unremarkable', 'hurried', 'transformation', 'sort', 'happy', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'couple', 'two', 'individuals', 'falling', 'apart', 'result', 'diseased', 'house', 'children', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'killed', 'beginning', 'who', 'later', 'appear', 'ghosts', 'seem', 'less', 'annoying', 'then', 'ones', 'have', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'flesh', 'blood', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'performance', 'Father', 'Callaway', 'disappointing', 'shallow', 'not', 'holding', 'candle', 'Steiger', 'role', 'original', 'being', 'scary', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'same', 'hackneyed', 'demon', 'devices', 'are', 'rewound', 'various', 'ways', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'occur', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'are', 'running', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'horror', 'movies', 'dull', 'unimaginative', 'lot', 'must', 'be', 'exception', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'Session', '9', 'Machinist', 'who', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'hope', 'decaying', 'genre.Plus', 'Amityville', 'was', 'always', 'weakest', 'film', 'odd', 'Satanic', 'Renaissance', 'had', '70', 'film', 'sat', 'sideline', 'Omen', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Exorcist', 'three', 'films', 'gave', 'quite', 'fright', 'one', 'possibility', 'something', 'petty', 'reaches', 'right', 'gut', 'biblically', 'predicted', 'child', 'Satan', 'finally', 'being', 'born', 'story', 'possession', 'actually', 'occured', 'never', 'been', 'proven', 'be', 'fraud', 'Polanski', 'genius', 'combined', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'power', 'novelist', 'Amityville', 'had', 'none', 'factors', 'backing', 'up', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'fine', 'willingness', 'participate', 'hoax', 'thing', 'entirely', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'were', 'con', 'artists', 'who', 'moved', 'house', 'knowing', 'precisely', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'there', 'intention', 'making', 'lots', 'money', 'claiming', 'was', 'haunted', 'even', 'ended', 'up', 'recanting', 'parts', 'it.For', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'matter', 'was', 'debunked', 'Catholic', 'Diocese', 'Rockville', 'William', 'Weber', 'lawyer', 'Ronald', 'Defeo', 'People', 'have', 'lived', 'house', 'tables', 'do', 'not', 'fly', 'around', 'dishes', 'do', ""n't"", 'crash', 'nothing', 'standard', 'foulness', 'sits', 'toilet', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'shot', 'family', 'death', 'was', 'generic', 'psychopath', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'using', 'drugs', 'time', 'slayings', 'lied', 'pathologically', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'did', 'thoroughly', 'own', 'admission', 'Defeo', 'family', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'dysfunctional', 'stand', 'claimed', 'demonic', 'possession', 'host', 'other', 'invented', 'ailments', 'insanity', 'personality', 'disorders', 'dissociative', 'condition', 'none', 'actually', 'had', 'real', 'horror', 'whole', 'thing', 'Ronnie', 'true', 'story.I', 'would', 'though', 'recommend', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'II', 'Possession', 'overlooked', 'gem.So', 'much', 'magic', 'eh']",The Amityville Horror

But what i will tell you is that yes it is intended to be a horror film and from my judgement it is more of a suspenes thriller ( Except a couple imparticualr films like Devils Rejects, House of 1000 corpses and Land of theDead etc ), as the only real horror IMO was in the late 60's to late 80's. Now they make suspense thrillers or action trhrillers.This movie is overall very good not scary but with a couple of pretty good creepy parts ,it keeps you a wake and doesnt get boring, has a good pace and the plot is well done alot different then the original that was made in the 70's but I found this to be a surprise for the better.This movie is great to rent and even would have been nice to see in the theatres, though I didnt its not like i regret it.

Just some quick thoughts on this 2005 remake of the 1979 original...The Amityville Horror (2005) is a remake of The Amityville Horror (1979), starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder.  This remake is way more over the top than the original.  The acting isn't as good, but the special effects are better (not that it means much to this reviewer).  The original movie didn't need to be remade.  It's a fine enough horror movie as it is.  In this day and age, however, EVERYTHING is being remade and it's all designed to cash in.I give this movie a generous 3 stars due to its entertainment value as a horror movie, but it's not as good as the original, which I gave 4 stars to.I recommend this movie only as a rental.",3,The original is better,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,772,"['description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'Just', 'quick', 'thoughts', '2005', 'remake', '1979', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', '2005', 'remake', 'Amityville', 'Horror', '1979', 'starring', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'remake', 'way', 'more', 'top', 'original', 'acting', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'better', 'not', 'much', 'reviewer', 'original', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'remade', 'fine', 'enough', 'horror', 'movie', 'day', 'age', 'however', 'EVERYTHING', 'being', 'remade', 'designed', 'cash', 'in.I', 'give', 'movie', 'generous', '3', 'stars', 'due', 'entertainment', 'value', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'to.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'rental']",The Amityville Horror

Being a Long Island resident myself, and having done a drive by of the house itself, I thought it would be appropriate for me to review this. The town of Amityville and the house are both beautiful, I can see why they would have had a problem with their payments every month if that was the case. I have a few questions though: who is this Katchum guy? And what's all this about Native American torture in the basement? Then again, what ever happened to the ugly pig face that the Lutzes were supposed to see upon their departure? And how come the damn dog had to die?! Just a little warning for you animal lovers out there, (don't worry, no animals were really harmed in the making of this film). Also, they waited three quarters of the way into the movie to bring in the priest and have him attacked by flies rather than at the beginning. And finally the Lutzs left in the boat instead of the car. Keeping those few differences in mind it was not entirely acurate to the original. Infact it's almost a whole different story! You can't even tell what really happened and what didn't anymore, if anything happened at all. And by the way, it's not a lake it's The Great South Bay. I know, I live here. But hey, what do you expect? It wasn't even filmed on Long Island but rather in Canada. That would explain the lake.I like the house's new dark and evil voice though. ""Kill them! GET...OUT!!!"" Given all of that, it was pretty cool but at the same time a little disapointing. And don't forget, the scariest part is that this isn't just a horror movie, it's real!

I could see the movie deteriorating if you happen to watch it in the middle of the afternoon with the windows open.  Ryan Reynolds stole the show.  I have been a fan of his work, but only saw him in comedy roles.  With that said, I was originally gun-shy at his casting and was hesitant at his ability to make the character believable.

If they can make a better film then this then let them rant on. They are hard core and go by the book that was written. The real story is; only a handful of people will ever really know the truth about actual events, and most of the bad reviewers were in diapers when these events occurred. Had they not used the Amityville name as the title, this would had satisfied the lot here. Look at this film as a haunted house story. If you enjoy this type of setting, you will not be dissapointed with this film. The special effects of today outweigh the original in 77 (I believe). Best to enjoy this film in a dark room alone. I've seen a fair amount of horror and spooky films over the years. This film does rank with the best, such as the original Haunting (but much more frightening), and The Shining, although the Shining was shy of 3 hours and had more time to evolve. Hat's off to the actors and producer that made a effective horror with less time. Acting? Hell, didn't the bad reviewers notice, that action and effects run the show these days? The acting was fine; now go change the diaper, and stop clicking on that button below saying "" I am over the age of 13! "". :) .... Great film, watch it with the girlfriend close. The film kept you on the edge all the way through, including few dull moments. What I enjoyed was the effective chilling moments.

Surely this film, ""based on a true story,"" would be just the ticket.  Just kidding, we all knew this was going to be silly hokum from the get-go.  I didn't believe this ""true story"" as a book, I didn't believe it as a film almost 30 years ago, and I haven't lost any brain cells since then.So the best I can say about the remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" is that it's less than 90 minutes.  OK, maybe that's harsh--I didn't hate this movie as some people did.  It just barely registered at all.  I suppose there is some suspense in the final moments, that's more than some movies.  But since none of the characters are developed very well, it's hard to work up much interest.  I suppose it's nice to see Ryan Reynolds in something other than an idiotic comedy.  Of course, that would be more interesting if he actually had the talent or presence to do anything more serious.Here is the insurmountable problem.  The movie plays much like ""The Shining,"" and yes, I'm being generous with the comparison.  But in ""The Shining,"" the family couldn't leave when things started spiraling out of control.  They were trapped and isolated, they had to play it out.  In ""The Amityville Horror,"" that is not the case.  The house is so inherently evil--everyone knows it.  The real estate agent sees spirits, the priest is chased away, the little girl almost gets killed, a baby-sitter is driven insane--and yet it never occurs to someone that maybe they should leave.  My favorite moment comes at the end (possible spoiler) as the family looks back at the house from the boat.  The husband has seemingly snapped out of his homicidal rage and is free from the house's influence!!!  Yea!!!  But I couldn't help thinking--Man, maybe they should have gone out to eat more often, shopping, whatever--if that's all it took to break free.  ""Honey, I'm going to pick up some groceries.

(Which I even believed not to be a hoax for quite a few years). With all our technoligical advancements in moviemaking and storytelling I was really ready for the creepy thrill ride that the first movie lacked. Imagine my surprise when I watched this movie-I must repeat my title here-WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE AMITYVILLE HORROR? Other than the opening backstory(The DeFeo murders) and the priest blessing the house and getting trounced by a faceful of flies there is not one thing that was in the book! Jody the pig too silly for modern audiences? Fine, make her a little girl who never existed! Harry the dog an inconvenient distraction? Fine, kill it! Don't even get me started on the ""Ketchum"" character or the ridiculousness of the magnetic letters and the driven to brink of insanity babysitter.Couldn't they even find a Dutch Colonial house that even remotely resembles the actual AH house? To say this movie is ""based"" on Jay Anson's bestseller stretches the definition of based into the realm of near fabrication. Somewhere out there, a great and truly scary movie of ""The Amityville Horror"" is waiting to be made. This certainly isn't it.

People flocking to witness PG-13 horror films like The Ring 1 & 2, The Grudge, Darkness, White Noise ect ect. It's crap.But this year looks a bit more promising with movies like The Amityville Horror, House of Wax (both remakes, but hey, nobody obviously has any new GOOD ideas) and The Devil's Rejects.Now on to the actual movie itself. Even though I wasn't overly impressed with the original Amityville film, I respect it and it was decent for it's time. But the 2005 remake proves to be a bit better than the original, and shows that people still know how to make scary movies.What I liked about The Amityville Horror was that it not only scared with you sudden, frightening images and shock value, but the house itself was psychologically scary. The house itself was the scariest character in the film, because of its strong sense malevolence and its underlying presence that just is foreboding terror and horror. And I've always had a stong fear of houses that may be haunted so I was easily scared by this movie, and I'm not one that is easily scared by most movies.Plus I liked all the performances in the film and the film had a great pace that never slowed down.I recommend this to anyone who likes scary movies, and I especially recommend this movie to anyone who thought The Grudge was scary, because if you thought The Ring or The Grudge was scary (which it wasn't at all), this should scare you into a mumbling idiot.",4,WOW!

924821,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AA4JKW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","The family that now owns the house in Amityville at what was once 112 Ocean Avenue (but now has a different number) have changed the infamous quarter-moon windows in the attic to regular shaped windows to ward off tourists. For that matter, I understand the house in Tom Rivers, New Jersey that was used in the original movie version of ""The Amityville Horror"" changed those windows as well. I find this interesting because without those ""eye"" windows I do not think this would have ended up being the most famous haunted house in America. Of course, the half-moon windows on the house were pretty small and in both Hollywood versions they end up being a lot bigger, but then you know what happens when movies get made.They still tell us that ""The Amityville Horror"" is ""Based on a True Story,"" but we now know enough about the writing and selling of Jay Anson's book to know that if the label belongs on this film then it belongs on movies like ""Troy"" because, hey, Homer wrote non-fiction too. But in the wake of ""The Blair Witch Project"" there is nothing wrong with a good hoax. Besides, this 2005 version of ""The Amityville Horror"" is the best movie ever made with that title, which includes the 1979 version with James Brolin and Margot Kidder, and all of its wretched sequels. But that does not mean that first time feature director Andrew Douglas (who made the documentary ""Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus"") is a truly satisfying horror film and the ""history"" of the house really does not give this movie a free pass on the willing suspension of disbelief. I watched this with all the lights out after midnight and had no problems sleeping, which is not the response the producers of this remake intended to be sure.The story is that in 1974 Ronald Defeo (Brendan Donaldson) took a rifle and killed everybody else in his family claiming that voices in the house told him to do so. The spookiest thing about the real murders was that all of the victims were shot in their beds from behind apparently without any of them waking up. But the script by Scott Kosar (who also wrote the remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") starts improving on reality at this point by having Ronald kill his youngest sister, Jodie (Isabel Conner), last in the closet of her attic bedroom. You might remember from the original movie and/or book that Jodie was the name of the pig from hell, but this time it is a little girl with a bullet hole in her forehead (hang on, because this is going to be one of those good things/bad things). When George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) move into the house, the youngest of her three children, Chelsea (Chlo' Grace Moretz) and Jodie become friends. But after 28 days in the house, the Lutz family will flee for their lives.For me Jodie is the pivotal character because of the way she changes the whole equation. We know going into this movie that this is a haunted house and that there are malevolent ghosts. We thought that maybe they were the ghosts of the dead Indians buried beneath the house, but that really does not matter to what is going on in the film. But Jodie is a much more recent ghost and it appears that she might actually be a good ghost and not a bad ghost. After all, in what is my favorite scene in the film, Jodie pays back the evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty babysitter (Rachel Nichols) who delights in telling Billy (Jesse James) and Michael Lutz (Jimmy Bennett) about the murders. However, this film does not know what to do with the idea that there is a new ghost in there with the old ghosts, although that is clearly behind the film's final ""boo!"" right before the end credits.Ultimately, the horror here is not the house but what it does to George Lutz, and although the special effects are greatly improved this time around, the creepiest moments belong mostly to George, especially when he has an ax in his hands. In retrospect, everything that I liked about this film is something that Kosar came up with, and not from Anson's book, Sandor Stern's earlier screenplay, or any of the myriad stories the Lutzs have been telling over the years. But far too often Douglas relies on the old standard of a character turning around to be surprised by another character standing right, and you can only do that so many times before it becomes annoying. There are also some montages that will remind you of a Nine Inch Nails music video, however the cumulative effect is that this movie is going through a bag of tricks rather than telling a coherent haunted house story. The performances and special effects are much better here, but in terms of a coherent narrative the 1979 version would actually have the advantage, and that is not a good thing.",3,A few creepy moments but no sleepless nights with this remake,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,4722,"['family', 'now', 'house', 'Amityville', 'what', 'was', 'once', '112', 'Ocean', 'Avenue', 'now', 'different', 'number', 'have', 'changed', 'infamous', 'quarter-moon', 'windows', 'attic', 'regular', 'shaped', 'windows', 'ward', 'off', 'tourists', 'matter', 'understand', 'house', 'Tom', 'Rivers', 'New', 'Jersey', 'was', 'used', 'original', 'movie', 'version', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'changed', 'windows', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'interesting', 'eye', 'windows', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'famous', 'haunted', 'house', 'America', 'course', 'half-moon', 'windows', 'house', 'were', 'pretty', 'small', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'lot', 'bigger', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'movies', 'get', 'made.They', 'still', 'tell', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Based', 'True', 'Story', 'now', 'know', 'enough', 'writing', 'selling', 'Jay', 'Anson', 'book', 'know', 'label', 'film', 'then', 'movies', 'Troy', 'hey', 'Homer', 'wrote', 'non-fiction', 'too', 'wake', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'good', 'hoax', 'Besides', '2005', 'version', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'title', '1979', 'version', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'wretched', 'sequels', 'not', 'mean', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Douglas', 'who', 'made', 'documentary', 'Searching', 'Wrong-Eyed', 'Jesus', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'horror', 'film', 'history', 'house', 'really', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'free', 'pass', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'watched', 'lights', 'out', 'midnight', 'had', 'problems', 'sleeping', 'not', 'response', 'producers', 'remake', 'intended', 'be', 'sure.The', 'story', '1974', 'Ronald', 'Defeo', 'Brendan', 'Donaldson', 'took', 'rifle', 'killed', 'everybody', 'else', 'family', 'claiming', 'voices', 'house', 'told', 'do', 'so', 'spookiest', 'thing', 'real', 'murders', 'was', 'victims', 'were', 'shot', 'beds', 'apparently', 'waking', 'up', 'script', 'Scott', 'Kosar', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'remake', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'improving', 'reality', 'point', 'having', 'Ronald', 'kill', 'youngest', 'sister', 'Jodie', 'Isabel', 'Conner', 'last', 'closet', 'attic', 'bedroom', 'might', 'remember', 'original', 'movie', 'and/or', 'book', 'Jodie', 'was', 'name', 'pig', 'hell', 'time', 'little', 'girl', 'bullet', 'hole', 'forehead', 'hang', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'good', 'things/bad', 'things', 'When', 'George', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'Melissa', 'George', 'move', 'house', 'youngest', 'three', 'children', 'Chelsea', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Jodie', 'become', 'friends', '28', 'days', 'house', 'Lutz', 'family', 'will', 'flee', 'lives.For', 'Jodie', 'pivotal', 'character', 'way', 'whole', 'equation', 'know', 'going', 'movie', 'haunted', 'house', 'are', 'malevolent', 'ghosts', 'thought', 'maybe', 'were', 'ghosts', 'dead', 'Indians', 'buried', 'house', 'really', 'not', 'matter', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'Jodie', 'much', 'more', 'recent', 'ghost', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'good', 'ghost', 'not', 'bad', 'ghost', 'what', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'Jodie', 'back', 'evil', 'wicked', 'bad', 'mean', 'nasty', 'babysitter', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'who', 'delights', 'telling', 'Billy', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Michael', 'Lutz', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'murders', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'idea', 'new', 'ghost', 'old', 'ghosts', 'clearly', 'film', 'final', 'boo', 'right', 'end', 'credits.Ultimately', 'horror', 'here', 'not', 'house', 'what', 'George', 'Lutz', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'greatly', 'improved', 'time', 'around', 'creepiest', 'moments', 'belong', 'mostly', 'George', 'especially', 'when', 'ax', 'hands', 'retrospect', 'everything', 'liked', 'film', 'something', 'Kosar', 'came', 'up', 'not', 'Anson', 'book', 'Sandor', 'Stern', 'earlier', 'screenplay', 'myriad', 'Lutzs', 'have', 'been', 'telling', 'years', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'Douglas', 'relies', 'old', 'standard', 'character', 'turning', 'around', 'be', 'surprised', 'character', 'standing', 'right', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'annoying', 'are', 'also', 'montages', 'will', 'remind', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'music', 'video', 'however', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'movie', 'going', 'bag', 'tricks', 'rather', 'telling', 'coherent', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'performances', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'terms', 'coherent', '1979', 'version', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'advantage', 'not', 'good', 'thing']",The Amityville Horror

924827,A2CVOAWC4OAKL2,B000AA4JKW,Matthew B. Cravens,"[2, 3]","In 1975, George and Kathy Lutz and her three children from a previous marriage moved into the home of their dreams on 112 Ocean Avenue.  28 days after moving in, they fled for their lives.  Those are the bare bone facts of the true story that this movie is based on (by the way I personally believe the things that the Lutz's described actually occurred.)  I have seen the 1979 version several times, and found it to be an extremely haunting, truly scary movie that sticks with you.  When I heard about this movie, I really expected to see a great remake of a classic film.  What I got though was a little different.  While the 2005 edition is very entertaining, it does not live up to the first movie and is not as good as I expected for many reasons.  The biggest reason is that this movie does not present the events as they were described by George and Kathy Lutz, as the original does.  Most of this movie seems like it was thrown together to get a few scares and screams from moviegoers with no interest in what supposedly really occurred in that house.  If this movie was just a fictional tale that was completely made up I would have liked it more I believe.  But this remake was obviously not based on the book or the original movie with James Brolin and Margot Kidder.  Bottom line:  If you are looking for a good scare, this movie is highly recommended.  If you are looking for the more factually based account of what happened to the Lutz family, the original is light years ahead of this flick.",2,GET OUT!!!!!,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,1507,"['1975', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'three', 'children', 'previous', 'marriage', 'moved', 'home', 'dreams', '112', 'Ocean', 'Avenue', '28', 'days', 'moving', 'fled', 'lives', 'are', 'bare', 'bone', 'facts', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'way', 'personally', 'believe', 'things', 'Lutz', 'described', 'actually', 'occurred', 'have', 'seen', '1979', 'version', 'several', 'times', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'haunting', 'truly', 'scary', 'movie', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'really', 'expected', 'see', 'great', 'remake', 'classic', 'film', 'What', 'got', 'though', 'was', 'little', 'different', '2005', 'edition', 'very', 'entertaining', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'many', 'reasons', 'biggest', 'reason', 'movie', 'not', 'present', 'events', 'were', 'described', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'original', 'Most', 'movie', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'get', 'few', 'scares', 'screams', 'moviegoers', 'interest', 'what', 'supposedly', 'really', 'occurred', 'house', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'fictional', 'tale', 'was', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'believe', 'remake', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'based', 'book', 'original', 'movie', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'scare', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'factually', 'based', 'account', 'what', 'happened', 'Lutz', 'family', 'original', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'flick']",The Amityville Horror
924828,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000AA4JKW,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 2]","I'm going to use the first few lines from my review of the original. In 1974, Ronald DeFeo brutally massacred his entire family via shotgun blasts while they were sleeping in their beds. One year later, the Lutz family moves into the same house. With 3 kids, it was too sweet a deal to pass up and was exactly what George and Kathy were looking for. And then just after a few days of moving in, strange things begin to occur. Most notably with George and also with their only daughter Amy. While George is beginning to go insane, Amy has made a new ghostly friend.I think the remake did an ok job in the story, but way overboard with the typical scares. While the original had a sort of drawn out story, it had the subtle scares. The remake though has a bit of better story at first, but uses the typical Hollywood scares that most of us are used to by now. The best thing I liked about the movie was them showing George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) going crazy. It was more in depth and Ryan played the part really well. It was actually funny in a dark way listening to Ryan talk crap to the family sometimes, because to him it seemed like he was ok, while they were the ones being idiots or badly behaving. I really think Ryan gets a lot less credit than he deserves as an actor. Sure he gets put into comedy roles such as Van Wilder and Waiting, but I think he can act. When he told one of the boys to hold the wood while he chopped and then grabbed his face and got all evil looking, I looked at my buddy and said ""Dude, that would be really scary to see as a 12 year old if not now"". I also like how the story leaves out a lot of the priest parts that I didn't like from the original. I also thought the children's scenes were a lot better than the original and made me feel for them a bit more.What I didn't like though was the typical jump scares that felt unnecessary, but somehow I understand why they are there. If they weren't there, I could see people getting bored with the movie. Not everyone, but a lot. There were a few good ones though like when we see Jody sitting with Amy during one scene and the mom doesn't see her. But man they used way too much of her to try and scare us. Sure, little dead kids are scary, but come on. I liked how it was left to our imagination (sort of) in the original if she was there or not. The remake gives us no doubt. At least they didn't use some bad effects as her eyes outside a window this time...heh. And the ending was horrible... the way they wrapped it up was just bad. I almost thought I was watching 13 Ghosts in the end while George Lutz was walking past cages. Then he sees the main killer ghost... ridiculous.In the end, I'd give it a rent. I liked it just enough to buy it, mainly because of the character development of George Lutz and also some of the scenes. It can be a good movie for some though, and probably a fun date movie if you like horror.P.S. - They ruined the `Get Out' scene (my favorite scene) in this one in my opinion. It was so fake compared to the original.",3,An ok remake to an ok horror classic.,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,3033,"[""'m"", 'going', 'use', 'first', 'few', 'lines', 'review', 'original', '1974', 'Ronald', 'DeFeo', 'brutally', 'massacred', 'entire', 'family', 'shotgun', 'blasts', 'were', 'sleeping', 'beds', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'Lutz', 'family', 'same', 'house', '3', 'kids', 'was', 'too', 'sweet', 'deal', 'pass', 'up', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'George', 'Kathy', 'were', 'looking', 'then', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'moving', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'occur', 'Most', 'notably', 'George', 'also', 'only', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'George', 'beginning', 'go', 'insane', 'Amy', 'made', 'new', 'ghostly', 'friend.I', 'think', 'remake', 'did', 'ok', 'job', 'story', 'way', 'typical', 'scares', 'original', 'had', 'sort', 'drawn', 'story', 'had', 'subtle', 'scares', 'remake', 'though', 'bit', 'better', 'story', 'first', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'scares', 'most', 'are', 'used', 'now', 'best', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'showing', 'George', 'Lutz', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'going', 'crazy', 'was', 'more', 'depth', 'Ryan', 'played', 'part', 'really', 'well', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'dark', 'way', 'listening', 'Ryan', 'talk', 'crap', 'family', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'was', 'ok', 'were', 'ones', 'being', 'idiots', 'badly', 'behaving', 'really', 'think', 'Ryan', 'lot', 'less', 'credit', 'actor', 'put', 'comedy', 'roles', 'such', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Waiting', 'think', 'can', 'act', 'When', 'told', 'one', 'boys', 'hold', 'wood', 'chopped', 'then', 'grabbed', 'face', 'got', 'evil', 'looking', 'looked', 'buddy', 'said', 'Dude', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'scary', 'see', '12', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'now', 'also', 'how', 'story', 'out', 'lot', 'priest', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'original', 'also', 'thought', 'children', 'scenes', 'were', 'lot', 'better', 'original', 'made', 'feel', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'typical', 'jump', 'scares', 'felt', 'unnecessary', 'somehow', 'understand', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'could', 'see', 'people', 'getting', 'bored', 'movie', 'Not', 'everyone', 'lot', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'when', 'see', 'Jody', 'sitting', 'Amy', 'one', 'scene', 'mom', ""n't"", 'see', 'man', 'used', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'try', 'scare', 'Sure', 'little', 'dead', 'kids', 'are', 'scary', 'come', 'liked', 'how', 'was', 'left', 'imagination', 'sort', 'original', 'was', 'there', 'not', 'remake', 'doubt', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'bad', 'effects', 'eyes', 'window', 'time', 'heh', 'ending', 'was', 'horrible', 'way', 'wrapped', 'up', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'almost', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', '13', 'Ghosts', 'end', 'George', 'Lutz', 'was', 'walking', 'past', 'cages', 'Then', 'main', 'killer', 'ghost', 'end', ""'d"", 'give', 'rent', 'liked', 'just', 'enough', 'buy', 'mainly', 'character', 'development', 'George', 'Lutz', 'also', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'though', 'probably', 'fun', 'date', 'movie', 'like', 'horror.P.S', 'ruined', 'Get', 'Out', 'scene', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'opinion', 'was', 'so', 'fake', 'compared', 'original']",The Amityville Horror

924836,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000AA4JKW,Michael Zuffa,"[1, 1]","In 1974, in the town of Amityville, Rondald DeFeo went on a murderous rampage and killed the six other members of his family with a shotgun, shooting them as they slept.  In 1975, George (Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (George) move into the house, not knowing its history.  They see a good deal on a big house.  The Lutzs move into the house with their three kids, and a few days later, things start to go badly.George's easygoing ways turn menacing.  The daughter, Chelsea, makes an imaginary friend that bears the same name as the DeFeo's murdered daughter.  Windows open on their own, voices can be heard, and a priest flees an exorcism attempt.I had hopes for this movie, but found myself disappointed.  There is potential, but in the end, the film does not deliver more than a typical slasher-movie bad guy with axe chase scene.  The leads, Reynolds and George, are not engaging, and I never really felt for their characters.Then, there is the ""based on real events"" caption.  The Lutz's story is generally considered to be fiction these days, and perhaps a little more leeway should have been taken with the story.  Better special effects do not make a movie better, story does.  Unfortunately, ""The Amityville Horror"" can be added to the list of forgettable horror movies that have come out this year.

924841,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000AA4JKW,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 2]","At 3:15 a.m. on November 13th, 1974, in a lavish home in the suburb of Amityville, New York, 23 yr. old Ronald Defeo, Jr. brutally murdered his father, mother, and younger siblings as they slept, claiming as his motive that mysterious ""voices"" instructed him in his actions. The following year, newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz moved into that same house with Kathy's three children from a previous marriage. To the Lutzes, the bargain-priced home was a dream come true, despite the tragedy they knew had taken place there before. They were eager to start a life together in their new home on Ocean Avenue, but their dreams would soon be shattered by an evil that seemed to possess the very heart of the house itself. The events of their 28 day stay have come to be known as ""the Amityville Horror.""While the real Lutz family may justly dispute the film's ""Based on a true story"" header and slanderously false depiction of George himself, thanks to the Hollywood exaggerations and inventions woven into their story for this and the original 1979 film, they stand by their original allegations of their nightmarish experiences in the house at 112 Ocean Avenue. In other words, popular claims that the family `fessed up to a colossal hoax are completely untrue. This fact, thankfully, leaves the legendary mystery of the Amityville house intact. And, while we no doubt feel compassion for those who suffered and died in that possibly evil home, the knowledge of some basis in truth is what really makes the Amityville story so fascinating.The original film, while it was no doubt sensationalized, was probably a closer account of the Lutzes' own story than the new version starring Ryan Reynolds as an unbelievably ripped (did people take personal fitness to THAT level in the 70s?) George Lutz, and the beautiful (but forgets to dye her eyebrows to match her hair) Melissa George as his wife, Kathy. In this 2005 retelling of America's most famous haunting, a variety of story changes result in what still adds up to be an enjoyably chilling experience, even for fans of the original movie. The folks at MGM have cooked up a remake with some real scares here, possibly among the best I've ever seen. The theme of the Lutzes' struggle to hold together throughout the events remains intact (if a bit overly brutalized), though the strong focus on the family and the house makes for such a small cast and so few locales that an almost low budget feeling seems to loom. The original film still feels like the better one, most likely because of memorable elements like the highly superior ""Get out!"" scene, the much more disturbing pig incarnation of ""Jodie,"" and the repeated use of that spine-tingling theme music. I can't even recall if the classic theme was used in this remake. It also had a stronger atmosphere, and much more believability, in part, I'm sure, because it was so much more real. The actors did not look like models in the 70s, and this is one reason horror films of that time are so frightening compared to the eye-candy flicks of today. Everything nowadays is perhaps a bit too crisp and perfect, including the actors and actresses. Great to look at, but not easy to relate to. On the other hand, the performances were excellent, and the horrific imagery used in this remake is truly blood-curdling. They really hit the nail on the head with the scares in this flick, even if they botched the ""Get out!"" voice that was so frightening in the classic. The new film also provides an eerie new back story, something sorely lacking from the original film. There's also a great revision of the babysitter sequence, featuring either the worst babysitter in history, or the best, depending on who you are in the household.""The Amityville Horror"" remake maintains itself throughout, and is more than worthy of viewing and eventually owning. Not as good as the first as an overall movie, but visually more frightening than anything I can remember seeing offhand. Should please the typical horror movie fan. Also highly recommended for fans of demonic haunted house tales, the direct to DVD feature ""Dead Birds.""",5,"Major Scares From a Solid, If Not Superior Remake!",1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,4116,"['3:15', 'a.m.', 'November', '13th', '1974', 'lavish', 'home', 'suburb', 'Amityville', 'New', 'York', '23', 'yr.', 'old', 'Ronald', 'Defeo', 'Jr.', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'father', 'mother', 'younger', 'siblings', 'slept', 'claiming', 'motive', 'mysterious', 'voices', 'instructed', 'actions', 'following', 'year', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'moved', 'same', 'house', 'Kathy', 'three', 'children', 'previous', 'marriage', 'Lutzes', 'bargain-priced', 'home', 'was', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'tragedy', 'knew', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'there', 'before', 'were', 'eager', 'start', 'life', 'together', 'new', 'home', 'Ocean', 'Avenue', 'dreams', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'shattered', 'evil', 'seemed', 'possess', 'very', 'heart', 'house', 'events', '28', 'day', 'stay', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'real', 'Lutz', 'family', 'may', 'justly', 'dispute', 'film', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'header', 'slanderously', 'false', 'depiction', 'George', 'thanks', 'Hollywood', 'exaggerations', 'inventions', 'woven', 'story', 'original', '1979', 'film', 'stand', 'original', 'allegations', 'nightmarish', 'experiences', 'house', '112', 'Ocean', 'Avenue', 'other', 'words', 'popular', 'claims', 'family', 'fessed', 'up', 'colossal', 'hoax', 'are', 'completely', 'untrue', 'fact', 'thankfully', 'legendary', 'mystery', 'Amityville', 'house', 'intact', 'doubt', 'feel', 'compassion', 'who', 'suffered', 'died', 'possibly', 'home', 'knowledge', 'basis', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'Amityville', 'story', 'so', 'fascinating.The', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'doubt', 'sensationalized', 'was', 'probably', 'closer', 'account', 'Lutzes', 'own', 'story', 'new', 'version', 'starring', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'unbelievably', 'ripped', 'did', 'people', 'take', 'personal', 'fitness', 'level', '70s', 'George', 'Lutz', 'beautiful', 'dye', 'eyebrows', 'match', 'hair', 'Melissa', 'George', 'wife', 'Kathy', '2005', 'retelling', 'America', 'most', 'famous', 'haunting', 'variety', 'story', 'changes', 'result', 'what', 'still', 'up', 'be', 'enjoyably', 'chilling', 'experience', 'even', 'fans', 'original', 'movie', 'folks', 'MGM', 'have', 'cooked', 'up', 'remake', 'real', 'scares', 'here', 'possibly', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'theme', 'Lutzes', 'struggle', 'hold', 'together', 'events', 'intact', 'bit', 'overly', 'brutalized', 'strong', 'focus', 'family', 'house', 'such', 'small', 'cast', 'so', 'few', 'locales', 'almost', 'low', 'budget', 'feeling', 'loom', 'original', 'film', 'still', 'better', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'memorable', 'elements', 'highly', 'superior', 'Get', 'out', 'scene', 'much', 'more', 'disturbing', 'pig', 'incarnation', 'Jodie', 'repeated', 'use', 'spine-tingling', 'theme', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'classic', 'theme', 'was', 'used', 'remake', 'also', 'had', 'stronger', 'atmosphere', 'much', 'more', 'believability', 'part', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'models', '70s', 'one', 'reason', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'frightening', 'compared', 'eye-candy', 'flicks', 'today', 'Everything', 'nowadays', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'crisp', 'perfect', 'including', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Great', 'look', 'not', 'easy', 'relate', 'other', 'hand', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'horrific', 'imagery', 'used', 'remake', 'truly', 'blood-curdling', 'really', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'scares', 'flick', 'even', 'botched', 'Get', 'out', 'voice', 'was', 'so', 'frightening', 'classic', 'new', 'film', 'also', 'eerie', 'new', 'back', 'story', 'something', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'revision', 'babysitter', 'sequence', 'featuring', 'worst', 'babysitter', 'history', 'best', 'depending', 'who', 'are', 'household', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'remake', 'more', 'worthy', 'viewing', 'eventually', 'owning', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'overall', 'movie', 'visually', 'more', 'frightening', 'anything', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'offhand', 'Should', 'please', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'Also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'demonic', 'haunted', 'house', 'tales', 'direct', 'DVD', 'feature', 'Dead', 'Birds']",The Amityville Horror

My main complaint is that the movie is presented with the title of ""The Amityville Horror"", and uses the ""based on a true story"" tagline.  This version of the 1979 classic is so far removed from the original story (book AND movie) that it really should have been called something different.  At least the 1979 version used actual incidents that were alleged to have happened in the book (non-fiction?  who really knows?).  The only thing that resembles the ""true"" story in this 2005 version is someone moves into a haunted house.  A voice says ""get out"".  They leave.  That about sums it up.  This version has the daughter going out onto the roof and nearly plummeting to her death (never happened), coffins being stored in the basement built by you-know-who (never happened), ""Jodie"" is now (for some reason) presented as a dead DeFeo child (no DeFeo kid named Jodie in real life, and Jodie was formerly a demon-pig), and this time they flee in a motor boat (????)...and too many other changes to mention.Call me a purist....I will agree!  Again, I just do not like something this far removed from the ""actual events"" to say that it is based on a true story.  There are people still alive that were connected to this story, mainly George Lutz, and this version of this film basically accuses him of plotting to actually plan to kill his family....that was never, ever presented as part of this story before and has no basis in reality.  That, my friends, is not ""based on a true story"".Make scary movies....I love them, too.

Wasting no time in getting to the shocks and disregarding any logic whatsoever, the film shows George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), along with Kathy's three children from her recently deceased ex-husband, move into an infamous house where grisly murders occured not even a year before.  After that, the viewer is slammed with quick edits, distorted faces, demonic voices, and disorienting camera angles, with no pity given to Ryan Reynolds' character at all as he wastes no time going insane and hunting down his family.

That got me interested in the story and I finally watched the original horror film, which was so bland and lacking in suspense that I don't know why previews of that movie gave me nightmares as a child.With today's film technology, I looked forward to seeing this new version. Signs were not good when the film's distributors refused to allow film critics to pre-screen the movie for the Friday write-ups. Roger Ebert created his ""finger wave"" category for the distributor's cowardice in facing the film critics.While this film is a big improvement on the 1979 film, it still has a lot of cheap shots and comes across as manipulative. What it lacks in horror, they make up for it by spiking the scary music and quick jumps to startle the audience. Although based on a true story (whether it happened or was an elaborate hoax continues to be debated), so many instances strained credibility...such as the daughter walking dangerously on the roof. Yeah, right.The scene I most like in this film, however, deals with the babysitter, as she adds much humor to the story. Because of her and having actor Ryan Reynolds walk around shirtless, showing off his well-sculpted body, its obvious that the makers of the film settled for a sexed up version for modern audiences to make up for the lack of suspense and true drama/horror. That also strains credibility, but its only a movie...one that's hard to take seriously from the get-go.The truly horrifying scene takes audiences into the basement to discover the house's secret past that explains the haunting. It is the most graphic part of the film and the scariest. If this film had more of that, instead of trying to be a cheap imitation of ""The Sixth Sense"" (which is what I thought of everytime that ghost girl popped up unexpectedly for no other reason than to startle the audience), I would give it another star.

The film kept a fast pace, and the lines between reality (in the film) and the Dad's insanity were appropriately blurred at the right moments to keep the audience guessing.

People who loved the book on which the films were based will probably hate this film....And that's because this is a film for the younger audience who just wants to have some scarry-fun and who couldn't care less about the previous works made on the subject.This film makes many changes to the original story and makes it more spectacular. It has many spooks and horrible ghosts and all those things that work so well.And I am glad to say this film is very fun to watch. It does have some great scarry moments.The only complaint I make is the total absence of development of the George Lutz character. At the beginning, he is a great guy... but the second he enters Amityville he transforms into a demonic dark-sided figure. The screenplay is so eager to get things going that it forgets to develop the character properly.But this problem comes from an incompatibility: the original character in the book (as far as I can remember) does not get possessed by the evil spirit. In fact, he is just a victim of the house like the rest of the family. But the screenwriters here felt they needed to get him possessed (so he would be a materialization of the house's antagonism). and here comes the problem: how could they develop this new thing if the family only spent 28 days in the house?They do not. The guy transforms so quickly we do loose some empathy with the character.But the film has so much atmosphere and scarry moments that I do forgave its flaws. I recomend this film if you never saw the original version (which I looove).This film is way above the average.Get some poporn, some friends, turn off the lights and enjoy!!!",4,"A WELL DONE, FUN, SCARRY FILM...",1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,1716,"['People', 'who', 'loved', 'first', 'films', 'yes', 'remake', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'one', 'People', 'who', 'loved', 'book', 'films', 'were', 'based', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'film', 'film', 'younger', 'audience', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'scarry-fun', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'previous', 'works', 'made', 'subject.This', 'film', 'many', 'changes', 'original', 'story', 'more', 'spectacular', 'many', 'spooks', 'horrible', 'ghosts', 'things', 'work', 'so', 'well.And', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'have', 'great', 'scarry', 'only', 'complaint', 'make', 'total', 'absence', 'development', 'George', 'Lutz', 'character', 'beginning', 'great', 'guy', 'second', 'Amityville', 'demonic', 'dark-sided', 'figure', 'screenplay', 'so', 'eager', 'get', 'things', 'going', 'develop', 'character', 'properly.But', 'problem', 'incompatibility', 'original', 'character', 'book', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'not', 'get', 'possessed', 'evil', 'spirit', 'fact', 'just', 'victim', 'house', 'rest', 'family', 'screenwriters', 'here', 'felt', 'needed', 'get', 'possessed', 'would', 'be', 'materialization', 'house', 'antagonism', 'here', 'problem', 'how', 'could', 'develop', 'new', 'thing', 'family', 'only', 'spent', '28', 'days', 'house', 'do', 'not', 'guy', 'transforms', 'so', 'quickly', 'do', 'loose', 'empathy', 'character.But', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'scarry', 'moments', 'do', 'forgave', 'flaws', 'recomend', 'film', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'version', 'looove', '.This', 'film', 'way', 'average.Get', 'poporn', 'friends', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'enjoy']",The Amityville Horror

924859,A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,B000AA4JKW,Raven A. Wind,"[0, 0]","Egads, this was a stupid, pointless, bad movie.Why were there random ghostly images appearing that the audience could see, but the characters could not? What's the point of that? They had nothing to do with the story; They were just visual effects thrown in to remind the audience &#34;HEY! THEY LIVE IN A HAUNTED HOUSE AND DON'T KNOW IT! DURRR.&#34;Why was George seeing a hanged girl when we all know she was shot in the head and there was never any hanging?And seriously-- A torture chamber in the basement that nobody ever knew about? You'd think they'd notice something like that during the pre-sale inspection.There's a reason George Lutz tried to stop this from being released. Nothing in it has anything to do with the book or the story the Lutz's told about their experience there. George never acted like that. His wife wasn't a widow when he married her. Nothing ever happened on the roof. No dog was ever harmed. There was no hidden torture chamber. There were no coffins. The kids didn't have to chop wood all the time. George wasn't a contractor. And on and on. The filmmakers just completely made up this bad movie out of a bunch of awful jump-scares, bad CGI effects, and tired modern horror cliches. And what truly bites is that they used the Lutz's names to tell this nonsense story.By the way: Jump scares aren't horrifying or even scary. They're just cheap attempts to startle the audience. If you're a fan of low-hanging fruit like The Ring or Scream, then I suppose this might be good. If you like actual horror, however, you'll be disappointed.This was a terrible movie. Simply awful. The critics and most of the viewers on Rotten Tomatoes have it right: The only thing good about it is the acting (Reynolds actually surprised me), but the actors had a terrible script and an director who just threw every bad horror and rock video cliche at the wall and hoped something would stick.The only reason I'm giving this film two stars is because the acting was decent, and the cinematography made up for the terrible writing and directing in several scenes.My suggestion: Skip this and watch the original, or better yet, watch The Conjuring, which is essentially a remake of the original that gets it right (even though they change the character names, and make the circumstances far more dire than the Lutz's described).",2,"A bland pastiche of jump-scares, nonsensical visual effects, and dull cliches.",1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,2339,"['Egads', 'was', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'bad', 'movie.Why', 'were', 'there', 'random', 'ghostly', 'appearing', 'audience', 'could', 'see', 'characters', 'could', 'not', 'What', 'point', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'were', 'just', 'visual', 'effects', 'thrown', 'remind', 'audience', '34', 'HEY', 'THEY', 'LIVE', 'IN', 'A', 'HAUNTED', 'HOUSE', 'AND', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'KNOW', 'IT', 'DURRR.', '34', 'Why', 'was', 'George', 'seeing', 'hanged', 'girl', 'when', 'know', 'was', 'shot', 'head', 'was', 'never', 'hanging', 'seriously', 'torture', 'chamber', 'basement', 'nobody', 'ever', 'knew', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'notice', 'something', 'pre-sale', 'inspection.There', 'reason', 'George', 'Lutz', 'tried', 'stop', 'being', 'released', 'Nothing', 'anything', 'do', 'book', 'story', 'Lutz', 'told', 'experience', 'there', 'George', 'never', 'acted', 'wife', 'was', ""n't"", 'widow', 'when', 'married', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'happened', 'roof', 'dog', 'was', 'ever', 'harmed', 'was', 'hidden', 'torture', 'chamber', 'were', 'coffins', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chop', 'wood', 'time', 'George', 'was', ""n't"", 'contractor', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'bad', 'movie', 'bunch', 'awful', 'jump-scares', 'bad', 'CGI', 'effects', 'tired', 'modern', 'horror', 'cliches', 'what', 'truly', 'used', 'Lutz', 'names', 'tell', 'nonsense', 'story.By', 'way', 'Jump', 'scares', 'are', ""n't"", 'horrifying', 'even', 'scary', ""'re"", 'just', 'cheap', 'attempts', 'startle', 'audience', ""'re"", 'fan', 'low-hanging', 'fruit', 'Ring', 'Scream', 'then', 'suppose', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'like', 'actual', 'horror', 'however', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed.This', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'Simply', 'awful', 'critics', 'most', 'viewers', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'have', 'right', 'only', 'thing', 'good', 'acting', 'Reynolds', 'actually', 'surprised', 'actors', 'had', 'terrible', 'script', 'director', 'who', 'just', 'threw', 'bad', 'horror', 'rock', 'video', 'cliche', 'wall', 'hoped', 'something', 'would', 'stick.The', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'cinematography', 'made', 'up', 'terrible', 'writing', 'directing', 'several', 'scenes.My', 'suggestion', 'Skip', 'watch', 'original', 'better', 'yet', 'watch', 'Conjuring', 'essentially', 'remake', 'original', 'right', 'even', 'change', 'character', 'names', 'make', 'circumstances', 'far', 'more', 'dire', 'Lutz', 'described']",The Amityville Horror
924860,A279YV5OVK6MRQ,B000AA4JKW,"RDU ""graduate school nerd""","[0, 1]","I'd have to say that I enjoyed the Amityville documentary that came on the learning channel the other day way more than I liked this movie. Afterall, there are about six Amityville films out right now, and NONE of them are any good. In fact, the original ""Amityville Horror"" wasn't all that spectacular...So my question is, ""Why make this movie? What more can Hollywood  utilize to try and scare people when everybody already knows the story behind the DeFeo murders and the Amityville hauntings?""What's more, I was hoping that this movie would go back to the supposedly true, unsensationalized story behind the Lutzes and their 28 days of hell in their new Long Island home. Not to mention, the DVD version of this film has some extras with an interview with Mrs. Warren, a well-known psychic investigator who, along with her husband and their parapsychology team, examined the Amityville house back in the 70s.Yet much to my disappointment, the DVD only shows Mrs. Warren babbling on and on about how the Amityville house was the most evil house, sitting on the most evil street, located within the most evil of towns...Yeah, I think you get the idea. On the other hand, instead of listening to Mrs. Warren prattling on about all the eccentricities she sensed in the Amityville house, the learning channel documentary revealed some of the actual pictures the Warrens took during their investigation. One of the pictures was of a childlike entity with glowing eyes standing by the main staircase. Surprisingly, the child closely resembled one of the murdered DeFeo children.Thus, in my opinion, the ongoing debate as to whether or not the Lutz's made the whole haunted house bit up, or if the Amityville house is actually inhabited by demons, along with the tortured spirits of the slain DeFeo family is a much more interesting source of entertainment than this B-rated horror remake. Instead of dealing with any hardcore facts, this movie goes straight into all the not-so-spooky haunted house hype from the very moment the Lutzes move in, up until their expected, yet extremely disappointing departure.It's like I kind of got the sense that the makers were relying too much on digitized special effects to make this remake a hit vs. using a solid plotline or any real suspense. In fact, this film draws on some extra, apocryphal nonsense that not even the original Amityville bothered to use. For instance, the movie plays on a rumor that the Amityville house was built on an old Indian burial ground, and that the Lutz's basement was used as a sacrificial temple by a colonial-aged witch named J. Katchum.All in all, the acting isn't bad, but it's evident that any remake has a lot to live up to in order to match, or even to surpass the film it's based on. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't even begin to match the original Amityville. So in the end, I suggest sticking to the first movie, or even trying to catch the Amityville documentary on the learning channel- -both are of a much higher calibur than this arbitrary horror remake.",2,Don't Believe the Hype,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,3040,"[""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Amityville', 'documentary', 'came', 'learning', 'channel', 'other', 'day', 'way', 'more', 'liked', 'movie', 'Afterall', 'are', 'six', 'Amityville', 'films', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'NONE', 'are', 'good', 'fact', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'was', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'So', 'question', 'Why', 'make', 'movie', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'Hollywood', 'utilize', 'try', 'scare', 'people', 'when', 'everybody', 'already', 'story', 'DeFeo', 'murders', 'Amityville', 'hauntings', 'What', 'more', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'supposedly', 'true', 'unsensationalized', 'story', 'Lutzes', '28', 'days', 'hell', 'new', 'Long', 'Island', 'home', 'Not', 'mention', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'extras', 'interview', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'well-known', 'psychic', 'investigator', 'who', 'husband', 'parapsychology', 'team', 'examined', 'Amityville', 'house', 'back', '70s.Yet', 'much', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'only', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'babbling', 'how', 'Amityville', 'house', 'was', 'most', 'evil', 'house', 'sitting', 'most', 'evil', 'street', 'located', 'most', 'evil', 'towns', 'Yeah', 'think', 'get', 'idea', 'other', 'hand', 'instead', 'listening', 'Mrs.', 'Warren', 'prattling', 'eccentricities', 'sensed', 'Amityville', 'house', 'learning', 'channel', 'documentary', 'revealed', 'actual', 'Warrens', 'took', 'investigation', 'One', 'pictures', 'was', 'childlike', 'entity', 'glowing', 'eyes', 'standing', 'main', 'staircase', 'Surprisingly', 'child', 'closely', 'resembled', 'one', 'murdered', 'DeFeo', 'children.Thus', 'opinion', 'ongoing', 'debate', 'not', 'Lutz', 'made', 'whole', 'haunted', 'house', 'bit', 'up', 'Amityville', 'house', 'actually', 'inhabited', 'demons', 'tortured', 'spirits', 'slain', 'DeFeo', 'family', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'source', 'entertainment', 'B-rated', 'horror', 'remake', 'Instead', 'dealing', 'hardcore', 'facts', 'movie', 'straight', 'not-so-spooky', 'haunted', 'house', 'hype', 'very', 'moment', 'Lutzes', 'move', 'up', 'expected', 'yet', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'departure.It', 'kind', 'got', 'sense', 'makers', 'were', 'relying', 'too', 'much', 'digitized', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'remake', 'hit', 'vs.', 'using', 'solid', 'plotline', 'real', 'suspense', 'fact', 'film', 'draws', 'extra', 'apocryphal', 'nonsense', 'not', 'even', 'original', 'Amityville', 'bothered', 'use', 'instance', 'movie', 'rumor', 'Amityville', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'old', 'Indian', 'burial', 'ground', 'Lutz', 'basement', 'was', 'used', 'sacrificial', 'temple', 'colonial-aged', 'witch', 'named', 'J.', 'Katchum.All', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'evident', 'remake', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'order', 'match', 'even', 'surpass', 'film', 'based', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'match', 'original', 'Amityville', 'So', 'end', 'suggest', 'sticking', 'first', 'movie', 'even', 'trying', 'catch', 'Amityville', 'documentary', 'learning', 'channel-', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'calibur', 'arbitrary', 'horror', 'remake']",The Amityville Horror
924861,AZAEN52HOZA7T,B000AA4JKW,"Reka Kovacs ""Madonna""","[1, 2]","This is a great movie. The trailor looked scary and I was very pleased that the movie was everthing I thought it would be.This movie is about a house located on 415 Ocean Drive in Amity, New York that is supposedly haunted. It is a remake of the 1979 movie starting James Brolin and Margo Kidder. The beginning tells you basically in a nutshell what a family member did to his other family members while they were sleeping, after being in the house for 4 weeks. It shows it to you in a graphic manner and tells you why.Then we move to 1975 where George and Kathy Lutz are looking for houses on the market that would be good for them and Kathy's 3 children from another marriage. They see an advertisement for a house for a reasonable price. George finds the price odd considering how big it is and asks ""what the catch is"" and are told that a murder took place in the house but not in great detail. Kathy and George both first resist a little thing because of this but George says ""well houses don't kill people"". So they eventually buy the house because they think it will be great for them and in helping raise the 3 kids with so much space. This movie reminds me a little of The Shining, except its a house not a hotel and it is more graphic.The movie shows Ryan Reynolds who I thought was very well cast as George Lutz and slowly shows us in the first 5 scenes involving Lutz on why he went crazy which we can not completely figure out from the beginning from the previous family member. George Lutz starts seeing things.  He first sees an image of a young girl and sees himself doing something horrible. These scenes are pretty graphic and he starts to have more bizzaree hallucinations and hears faint voices which later tell he what to do. He finally sees demonic images when he watches a family video and starts to completely lose it. This makes the movie more interesting. The whole movie explains in detail what is in the house and why everything is happening.There are some very scary and gory scenes in this movie that do not directly involve George Lutz. There is the young sweet blond daughter of Kathy Lutz who befriends a another girl in her imagination named Jodie or is she real which we dont know. The girl is just plain creepy. The connection with the girl leads up to more scaries scenes to come involving a babysitter and a rooftop scene. Then there are the 2 older boys and soon one of them sees something too. Lutz eventually starts to use an ax to cut wood and the older boy beginns to notice a change when the ax comes down really close to him while he is holding the wood. The wife slowly starts to see a change in her husbands personality too. Even though she sees this she is trying really hard to save their marriage and will do anything to make things better. Kathy Lutz is the last one to notice soemthing is wrong with the house.Near the end Kathy Lutz finally does some research about the house and figures out what happened in the 1600's that had something to do with a Reversnd named Ketchum who tortured 20 Indians who are now buried under the house. While Kathy Lutz is reading the book and flipping through pages and seeing this; George Lutz actually visualizes it at the same time, very gory scene here. She finally confides in a priest that she is living in the house with her family. The priest attempts to bless the house to bring out the evil spirits. There is a lot of drama near the ending when Ryan Reynolds goes mad to the point where he picks up his ax and tries to kill his whole family. Its a highly entertaining movie to watch and I guarantee you wont be disappointed!!!! The extras included are interesting and they contain interviews by the director Andrew Douglas, Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George, and the three little kids. Other features include the making of the movie and interviews by the people directly involved in the murder case back in 1974. We get to hear a detective, sheriff, and another lady talk about the actual crime scene and how to this day are baffled as to how one person can kill 6 people and how none of the victims were able to call out for help.

924863,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000AA4JKW,RMurray847,"[2, 7]","Lately, there have been a lot of PG-13 rated horror movies, most of which have drawn critical and public lambasting.  BOOGEYMAN, CURSED, THE GRUDGE, WHITE NOISE, even RING 2.  One criticism often leveled by the public is that the ""whimpy"" PG-13 rating is causing the filmmakers to soften the horror of the movies.  Well, this weekend saw the arrival of an R-rated horror movie, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, and it pretty much proves one thing...the R-rating ISN'T what these other movies were lacking to be good.AMITYVILLE is a lousy movie, pure and simple.  I'm old enough to remember the original phenomenon.  The Lutz family buys a house for a great price because the previous residents had been horrifically murdered in it.  28 days later, the Lutz's run from the house in horror because they nearly suffered the same fate.  Soon, a ""non-fiction"" novel of their story came out.  The Lutz's made the rounds of less picky talk shows and basically, a huge urban legend sprung up.  Their story was TRUE!!  (Of course, it was all a hoax, but who cares about that!).  Then a movie came out, and everyone was all in an uproar over the walls that bled!  Cool!!!  But the movie, with James Brolin and Margot Kidder was schlock then and it's certainly dreadful now.Then here comes a remake that doesn't even bring the zeitgeist of the original with it.  We take it as pure fiction right from the get-go, despite the title card stating ""Based on a True Story.""  Yep, it truly is a story alright.The thrills are predictable in the extreme.  Most of them are heralded with a burst of loud music.  Over and over.  Now, I will grant you that horror movies have been doing this for years...but this movie makes the most of the device.  It accompanies EVERYTHING that might be even remotely creepy.  LOUD NOISE=HUGE THRILL!!! Right??Wrong.  In one scene, the father (played by a bushy faced Ryan Reynolds...designed to make him look like the bearded James Brolin from the original) is watching some home movies.  He smiles.  Suddenly, one of the kids' faces briefly turns demonic, right on the film.  LOUD, LOUD BLAST OF SOUND!!  I just about had to laugh.  This wasn't scary at all.  The kid wasn't going to come out of the film and attack the father. It was just a weird little thing that would have been more effective with quiet music or none at all.  But no, why be subtle when a SLEDGEHAMMER OF SOUND is readily available.  Thus, the movie renders all its thrills equal.  There's really no sense of climax.  Right near the end, something horrible happens to a major character, and we actually think, ""Cool, the movie is daring enough to surprise us in this way.""  Nope, it was just a dream.Also horrific is the fact that the wonderfully talented Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights) plays the local priest as though a gun were being held to his head.  I assume he got a nice paycheck, or maybe did it on a bet or a dare, but he sure looks unhappy to be in this film.I give the film 2 stars, because I reserve 1 star reviews for the true dregs of the earth like FEAR DOT COM or THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  But this movie is just clumsy, unexciting and UNTHRILLING.  As for the R rating?  Well, one ""F"" bomb is dropped, and there are some disturbing images when we discover what REALLY happened on the land the house was built on.  Mind you, I said disturbing.  But not scary.  So, I don't recommend the movie for kids...or anyone else, for that matter!",2,If LOUD blasts of sound scare you...this is your cup of tea!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,3432,"['Lately', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'horror', 'movies', 'most', 'have', 'drawn', 'critical', 'public', 'lambasting', 'BOOGEYMAN', 'CURSED', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'WHITE', 'NOISE', 'even', 'RING', '2', 'One', 'criticism', 'often', 'leveled', 'public', 'whimpy', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'causing', 'filmmakers', 'soften', 'horror', 'movies', 'Well', 'weekend', 'saw', 'arrival', 'R-rated', 'horror', 'movie', 'THE', 'AMITYVILLE', 'HORROR', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'thing', 'R-rating', 'IS', ""N'T"", 'what', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'lacking', 'be', 'good.AMITYVILLE', 'lousy', 'movie', 'pure', 'simple', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'original', 'phenomenon', 'Lutz', 'family', 'house', 'great', 'price', 'previous', 'residents', 'had', 'been', 'horrifically', 'murdered', '28', 'days', 'later', 'Lutz', 'run', 'house', 'horror', 'nearly', 'suffered', 'same', 'fate', 'Soon', 'non-fiction', 'novel', 'story', 'came', 'out', 'Lutz', 'made', 'rounds', 'less', 'picky', 'talk', 'shows', 'basically', 'huge', 'urban', 'legend', 'sprung', 'up', 'story', 'was', 'TRUE', 'course', 'was', 'hoax', 'who', 'Then', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'everyone', 'was', 'uproar', 'walls', 'bled', 'Cool', 'movie', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'was', 'schlock', 'then', 'certainly', 'dreadful', 'now.Then', 'here', 'remake', ""n't"", 'even', 'bring', 'zeitgeist', 'original', 'take', 'pure', 'fiction', 'right', 'get-go', 'title', 'card', 'stating', 'Based', 'True', 'Story', 'Yep', 'truly', 'story', 'alright.The', 'thrills', 'are', 'predictable', 'extreme', 'Most', 'are', 'heralded', 'burst', 'loud', 'music', 'Now', 'will', 'grant', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'movie', 'most', 'device', 'EVERYTHING', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'remotely', 'creepy', 'LOUD', 'NOISE=HUGE', 'THRILL', 'Right', 'Wrong', 'one', 'scene', 'father', 'played', 'bushy', 'faced', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'designed', 'make', 'look', 'bearded', 'James', 'Brolin', 'original', 'watching', 'home', 'movies', 'Suddenly', 'one', 'kids', 'briefly', 'demonic', 'right', 'film', 'LOUD', 'LOUD', 'BLAST', 'OF', 'SOUND', 'just', 'about', 'had', 'laugh', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'kid', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'come', 'film', 'attack', 'father', 'was', 'just', 'weird', 'little', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'quiet', 'music', 'none', 'why', 'be', 'subtle', 'when', 'SLEDGEHAMMER', 'OF', 'SOUND', 'readily', 'available', 'Thus', 'movie', 'thrills', 'equal', 'really', 'sense', 'climax', 'Right', 'end', 'something', 'horrible', 'major', 'character', 'actually', 'think', 'Cool', 'movie', 'daring', 'enough', 'surprise', 'way', 'Nope', 'was', 'just', 'dream.Also', 'horrific', 'fact', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'local', 'priest', 'gun', 'were', 'being', 'held', 'head', 'assume', 'got', 'nice', 'paycheck', 'maybe', 'did', 'bet', 'dare', 'sure', 'unhappy', 'be', 'film.I', 'give', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'reserve', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'true', 'dregs', 'earth', 'FEAR', 'DOT', 'COM', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'movie', 'just', 'clumsy', 'unexciting', 'UNTHRILLING', 'R', 'rating', 'Well', 'one', 'F', 'bomb', 'dropped', 'are', 'disturbing', 'images', 'when', 'discover', 'what', 'REALLY', 'happened', 'land', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'Mind', 'said', 'disturbing', 'not', 'scary', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'kids', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter']",The Amityville Horror
924864,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000AA4JKW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","[Note: review abridged for length requirements.]The Amityville Horror (Andrew Douglas, 2005)First, let's get this out of the way. The ""true story"" upon which The Amityville Horror is based is that the Lutzes bought a house they couldn't afford, and were drowning in debt. Given the house's history, they concocted the haunted-house story in order to get out from under the payments. This is something that the Lutzes came clean about ten years ago; how Douglas can get away with ""based on a true story"" is utterly beyond me. (Though in his defense, the extras do make it seem like he really bought the story hook, line, and sinker; obviously, the Lutzes' confession was not nearly as widely popularized as the original story.) I'm surprised no one's filed a class action lawsuit against the film's crew for representing it as true. (Even IMDB recognizes the hoax; the original film is listed bas based on Jay Anson's book, while the new one lists it as based on Jay Anson's novel.) James Frey is small potatoes, in comparison.That aside, comparing this to the original Stuart Rosenberg flick from 1979 is almost a painful experience. Both films are mediocre examples of filmmaking, but whereas Rosenberg's movie is fully realized in its mediocrity, Douglas has crafted a film that had almost limitless potential, and he threw most of it away piece by ugly piece.The one thing Douglas did right was toss out most of the conventions people were expecting from the '79 movie-- the infamous flies show up in only one scene, and pig-Jodie (the ""glowing red eyes outside the window"" shot the original made so famous) is nowhere to be found. While it is almost always the case that suggesting the demon is scarier than showing the demon, the version of Jodie found in this movie is far, far creepier than a pair of floating red eyes and a vague, pig-looking shadow. Also, the writers added a few touches that had the potential to make the story more interesting, such as the tentative relationship between George and the kids. The best thing they could have done would have been to dump the original script altogether and simply make a haunted-house flick that wore its allegiance to the '79 film on its sleeve. To his credit, it seems like twisted, brilliant screenwriter Scott Kosar (El Maquinista) attempted to do just that, but got hamstrung.For those who have been living in a cave for the past thirty years, the story, as originally told by the Lutzes: George and Kathy Lutz (here portrayed by Blade Trinity's Ryan Reynolds and Down with Love's Melissa George, respectively) bought a house in Amityville, New York, in 1975. Like all houses for which you get an incredible, deal, it's haunted. In this case, the year before, Ronald DeFeo, the son of the previous owner, had murdered the rest of his family in the house, claiming he'd heard voices telling him to do it. When George, Kathy, and family moved in, the same voices haunted them (and a priest they bring in to bless the house, whose role, according to the Catholic Diocese of Rockville Center, is ""completely exaggerated"" in the novel) until, twenty-eight days later, they fled, leaving all their personal possessions, never to return to the house.The acting is actually rather credible. Reynolds overacts a tad, as is his wont, but just a tad; no scenery-chewing here except for Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia), who plays the priest role to the hilt. George is great, and the adult actors are rounded out perfectly by a star turn from Rachel Nichols, of the underrated, short-lived TV series The Inside, as a drugged-out babysitter who tells the kids about the murders.The kids themselves were conventionally cast-- no taking chances on unknowns here-- and are conventional actors. Chelsea (soon to be seen in Zombies, J. S. Cardone's new flick) is your basic overdose of the cute, while Jimmy Bennett (Firewall) and Jesse James (The Butterfly Effect) go through their paces, each demonstrating the ability to cry on command.The problem with all this acting talent, which ranges from competent to surprisingly good, is that it's all hung on a framework that's so scrappy it can't even get the hallowed Hollywood tradition of the emotional shortcut right. The film's severely abbreviated length-- eighty-nine minutes-- could be written off as the culprit, but the deleted scenes don't show that there was any effort whatsoever to try and trace the emotions from point A to point B in the script. George goes from being kind, loving dad (which the script spent a good deal of time setting up, mind you, making the first moments of the film intensely boring) to raging jerk in the space of a heartbeat, then spends the rest of the movie rapid-cycling. This is one place the original film works much better than this one; James Brolin's gradual descent into madness plays, whereas Reynolds has a precipice instead of a descent. The funny thing is, he's still got twenty-seven days after he jumps off said precipice to hang around and be useless.More frustrating, the emotional scraps hang on the framework of a really good plot. Once you get about halfway into the film, the changes made to the original story start coming through, and they whip it into much better shape. There's a good deal more sense to be made out of everything, and one minor twist made to the DeFeo story ties everything together with brilliant economy. Again, construct all this on a different framework and give your actors real parts to work with, and you potentially have the best American horror flick of the past ten or fifteen years. Instead, something happened. I don't know what.The end result is a mediocre film that could have been great. **",2,Wasted potential.,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,5677,"['[', 'Note', 'review', 'abridged', 'length', 'requirements',

924865,A1WUMTJOASEL5F,B000AA4JKW,"Robert ""Supermandisco""","[1, 2]","The camera totally loves Ryan Reynolds from beginning to end, it follows him around one way or another, whether up close facial shots, eye shots, torso shots, and especially shirtless shots. It doesnt matter how stressed out he is, or becomes, the camera wants hunk in this spooky shadow of a well worn story of a family taken residence in a possessed and haunted house. From the reading of other reviewers the first movie still has bad karma. Ha, ha. Well, I liked the first movie not because of its execution (sorry) in style, but by some really memorable scenes that just creeped up on you that this movie doesnt have. Like the ill begotten nun who came to visit, or the psychic woman who immediately felt an outside presence of evil from within. These are the moments good movies make because they are lasting impressions of horror in any true good horror movie.

If Hollywood is so insistent on trotting out a seemingly endless number of remakes, then remake a BAD movie.  There's no fan base to aggravate, no 'sacred ground' that couldn't be tinkered with, a workable storyline, and instant name recognition.  Not to mention that I HATED the original 'Amityville Horror'.  So right up front, this was a film that had my attention.So how'd it do?  Pretty well actually.  I'm not sure I'd BUY it, but there was certainly enough good to justify a rental.  The acting was good, the effects were well-done and creepy, and the sound was awesome.  Just as an aside, this movie is MUCH eerier with a 5.1 surround system.  Hearing phantom foot-steps behind you and voices coming at you from different angles really adds a dimension that just isn't there when you watch in stereo or mono sound.I'll be the first to admit that I'm nit-picking a little bit, but I did want to mention a couple of the issues I had:1. The casting choices- While the acting, I felt, was really pretty good, the casting decisions had me scratching my head a little bit.  Both Ryan Renolds and Melissa George were too young or the actors playing their children were too old.  The way I figure it, Melissa George would have been about twelve when she had her first child.2. The film showed its cards a bit too early going right for the cheap jump-moments.  If we've all learned anything from `Jaws' it's that you don't need to show the shark right away to build up tension.3. One of the ONLY things I felt the original film did well was giving a genuine sense of ""family"" between the Lutz's.  I never really felt that in this movie.  I almost felt like I was watching five individuals going their own way.  Nobody ever seemed to ""connect.""  Part of the problem, I felt, was the sub-plot of George Lutz as the ""New Dad"". I felt like that alienated George's character too much and pulled the rug out from under the film.4. The character of the minister was significantly reduced from the first film.  I would have either expanded his part or just cut him completely.  I thought for sure we'd see him blessing the house before the Lutz's moved in.When all's said and done I'd give this a solid 3 stars out of five.

924869,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000AA4JKW,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 4]","""The Amityville Horror"" is a tawdry, low-rent version of ""The Shining"" from its lead, Ryan Reynolds, to its obsession with Jolly Rancher blood, ghosts, torture chambers and relentless, blaring ""horror"" music over genuine suspense. It's 100 minutes of discomfort and unintentional laughs.The ""true"" background of this story was fodder enough for two films 25 year ago: In 1975, Bob and Kathy Lutz (Reynolds and Melissa George) moved into the Long Island mini-mansion where, a year before, Robbie ""Butch"" DiFeo murdered his family. The Lutzes knew the history just before they bought the house; 28 days later, they fled it, left all their possessions and co-wrote a book about their experiences.There's been enough debate over whether Lutzes were telling the truth or concocting a hoax for money. Nevertheless, what the family ""claimed"" happened was far more subtle and interesting than this movie, which opens wide the horror encyclopedia, plucks a few entries and smears them on the screen whether they make sense or not.Consider: When the buxom, foul-mouthed babysitter - never had one of those in a scary flick - has to be hauled away in a straitjacket on the fourth or fifth day, why is the family curiously isolated afterward? No media, no paranormalists, no cops. Or how about when the Lutzes' 10-year-old daughter is lured out to the ledge of roof by a ghost? Do you stick in the house no matter how insistent the father? Is the local priest really useful at that point? ""The Amityville Horror"" is straddled between being restrained and a Rob Zombie picture, which is to say it's shameless, trading on its tie-in to a ""true story"" while it peddles demonic nonsense.Reynolds tackles Bob Lutz with relish, transforming into a frothing wild man. The performance is cartoonish - he's ridiculously buff, practically harlequin - and geared toward the Jack Nicholson wig-out in ""The Shining. But Reynolds, a comic actor attempting to cross the drama bridge, is rabid, seething. Melissa George is just another panicky, freckled-face blonde, and the three kids are not memorable enough to mention the actors who played them. George C. Scott is dead now, so Philip Baker Hall plays the senile, befuddled priest. Someone will inevitably say on the DVD commentary what an honor it was to have Philip Baker Hall on set for a whole day.""The Amityville Horror"" gets more absurd when we learn the source of the evil, involving Indian burial grounds, some old male witch,  torture chambers and torrents of bloods raining down on Reynolds. It's disgusting, not frightening.

Both were the same regarding the Lutz family and their buying a house that had a murder in it.  But the 1979 film had several scenes with the priest, a nun, the priest going crazy and catatonic, George's friends at work thinking he's crazy and so on.All these were cut out!  The 2005 film simplified things with the goings-on at the horror house, centering around the little girl and her invisible friend Jody.  There was more fear in this film:  a little girl balancing on a rooftop about to commit suicide, a dog being butchered, and George growing more and more insane with each passing day.  Ryan Reynolds was great as the slowly brewing psychotic who ""hears voices"" and wants to shoot up the family.I do miss the whole priest storyline from the 1979 film.  They had a token priest getting covered with flies and then he goes away and tells George's wife to move out.  Yawn!  There is the ""get out"" phrase being called to the priest, which was kinda cool.No homely babysitter who gets locked in the closet by a ghost.  Nope, we have a hot babysitter who takes every opportunity to show off her smooth abs as she tells the kids ghost stories and murder - at least until she gets locked in the closet (which has no locks) and goes insane!I'm not big on horror films but this one is pretty good.  Enough blood and gore to gross you out and several scenes of mayhem and fear to satisfy the casual horror film fan.DVD:  I enjoyed the special features, too many to list.  Several interviews with the actual people at Amityville, a spooky psychic, the police detectives of the time and so on.  A making of feature with the director, producer and make-up artist, and a chat with the cast.Bottom Line:  Though I miss the charm of the 1979 film, the 2005 film is the better one.

The 2005 remake of The Amityville Horror contains a fictional child character called Jodie DeFeo, who was not a victim of the shootings in November 1974. The claim that Ronald DeFeo, Jr. was influenced to commit the murders by spirits from a Native American burial ground on the site of 112 Ocean Avenue has been rejected by local historians and Native American leaders, who argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that the burial ground existed.""So this movie is'nt even about the REAL murders that happened.

It's a pretty simple formula: haunted house with secret(s), unsuspecting family, things start getting weird, etc.  The original 1979 version had a certain cheesy charm, but not enough to bar a remake.  Well, I was wrong.  The new ""Amityville,"" is a really bad movie that makes the older version seem better than it actually was.  And it can't even stick with the original (no floating pig eyes outside the second story window!), but goes poaching on ""The Shining,"" ""Poltergeist,"" and other post 1979 horror efforts.  What a mess.  The movie does establish that actor Ryan Reynolds (George Lutz in the film) has got an impressive six pack - which is, I suppose, something when you can't act.  Seriously, there's very little character development, and as a result there is little real horror generated.  It's hard to care about these people.  The kids are good. - especially actor Jesse James, playing conflicted 12 year old Billy Lutz.  But their parents, as played by George and Reynolds, hardly rise above walking talking manikins.  Maybe Romero could use them for his next ""Dead"" movie. The net result has me wanting the 1979 version with a hammy Rod Steiger, a moody James Brolin and a screaming Margot Kidder, and lots of flies.

Unlike others, I like the idea that people are revamping these old classic horror films (I'm waiting for someone to redo the original Hellraiser, It's alive, the original exorcist, clockwork orange, or maybe even bloodsucking Freaks!!!) Anyway, I thought it was better than I anticipated, but I must mention the audio. Just like all other newer horror movie (the ring, the grudge, and boogeyman) this movie relies heavily on deafening volumes for its scare tactics. When will these directors and producers realize that this is more annoying than anything else. It doesn't scare anyone (other than your teenyboppers) excluding the annoying noises, your left with a decent horror movie. It had some decent gore in it as well. I should also mention, I do not understand why anyone would go to this movie expecting it to be ""real"" or a documentary based off the real killing that happened in Rhode island. It's a horror movie folks, take it for what it is. BUT if you must have them, here is the REAL FATCS:The house was built on an Indian burial site in Rhode Island, it is still there to this day. Many strange things have happened at the house. Defeo was a real person who murdered his family. He was sent to jail for life and he claimed he didn't remember any of it. The family that moved into the house after the Defeo's (the Lutz) claimed to have seen chairs move, things being thrown, and hooded spirits. They also claimed to have been levitated while sleeping, and seen red eyes in the house. There has been no further reports of Paranormal activity to this day. Some skeptics say the Ghost story was fabricated by the owners to increase the sale value of the house, and to promote tourist.

Boy, was that a lie.

The original was a Good movie for being a older movie but this updated version brings us alot more. The house used in this movie is awesome. The movie begins with us seeing what really happened many years ago in the Defeo home. We see William Defeo shot to death every member of his family while they lay in their beds. What makes this movie even more great, is that actual footage from the real event is used in this film.... from police footage to the actual family members laying dead in a pool of blood in their beds. This movie, like the first shows the Lutz family move into the Defeo home because they get such a good buy on the home. Little do they know what lies ahead. This movie is excellently casted with great special effects. It is truly a edge of your seat movie. A thrilling and suspenseful remake. We see a once happy family start to fall apart as the home takes it's toll on George as he begins turning on his family. Mrs. Lutz realizes that when George is away from the home, he feels and looks much better than when he is in the home. She does research on the home and finds out that many years ago, a man named Katchum used the basement of the home as a torture chamber. After seeing this, she realizes that they must leave the home before the home destroys the entire family. Great from beginning to end. There are no dull or disappointing moments in this film.

924884,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000AA4JKW,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[4, 6]","One of the latest in a series of remakes of horror movies that didn't need to be remade but managed to hit the bullseye anyway, the new ""Amityville Horror"" does what a remake must do to be a success: it stays true to the concept and the esscence of the original; but it differentiates itself enough to stand on its own - playing up angles that got less attention the first time around while spending less time on what already got the lion's share of the thrust the first time around, adding in some new elements, maybe taking a left where the original took a right, that kind of thing.  If a remake is too out there it gets to the point where it shouldn't have been a remake at all, it should have been its own original entry, and may actually end up hamstrung by trying to make what seemingly wanted to be an entirely new movie a remake of something else in the first place.  On the other hand, if it's just a shot-for-shot and word-for-word clone, I see very little point in it.2005's ""Amityvile Horror"" is a faster-paced (although not nearly so breakneck a pace as early reports seemed to indicate), somewhat gorier version of the tale in which you actually see more of the horrors than in the classic 1979 original.  Excellent choice for a way to go; the much slower, 'crawling dread' type of feel that relied on hints, imagination and very occasional but highly effective jolts was done brilliantly the first time around, and going for a diiferent vibe on the same story was far preferable, in my mind, to mirroring the original too closely.  That's why the recent crop of horror remakes is turning out so well - we're getting a new, very distinct variation on a story instead of the exact same tone over again but with different performers.  And the characterization and the coherency of the movie remain in great form with the new, more action-oriented, visually direct feel.Highly believable, universally great performances, an added air of sexiness and occasional well-placed humor, neither of which clash with the movie's overall dark and intense feel, and realistic special effects, plus a major new original element in the movie's latter stages, make this a major winner.  I hope it's followed up by a sequel or two; the original movies went in a totally different direction from Part II onwards than the original books and the events that reportedly occurred in the Amityville house.Overall, a great movie of an innocent and likable family unexpectedly finding themselves in the midst of a hideous force of malevolence.

Once this new family moves in a series of unexplained events start happening with the father experiencing psychotic behavior to his loved ones. Hunk Ryan Reynolds (who has the best-looking abs of any actor I have seen) and Melissa George star as the leads.The film would go on to be the #1 movie in its opening weekend encompassing over 23 million dollars at the boxoffice. So far the movie has made over 100 million! Needless to say ""The Amityville Horror"" has become a certifed hit, although many critics have panned the film.The DVD features deleted scenes, Ryan Reynolds and producers commentary, featurettes on the making of the film, and more.

924888,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000AA4JKW,Terry Mesnard,"[0, 1]","Remakes are usually frowned upon by both critics and normal viewers because they seldom rise above the source material.  Yet, horror movies seem to be in the picture for remakes right now.  There was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and the Dawn of the Dead remake, both of which were interesting if not ultimately as good as the source material.  Later this year we will have House of Wax.  And then there's the Amityville Horror.  I think it's safe to say that the Amityville Horror is a movie ripe for a remake and they pulled it off admirably.Part of the reason it works for me is the ironically perfect casting of Ryan Reynolds.  When I first heard he was going to be playing George Lutz, my eyebrows raised; how could Van Wilder do an insane person?  Here is an actor who is best known for his goofball roles such as Van Wilder and Hannibal from Blade 3.  Yet it is this goofball persona which makes George Lutz much much more creepier than the bushy James Brolin from the original.  At the beginning of the movie, we see Reynold's Lutz as a bit calmer but definitely a normal character for Reynolds.  However, as the movie progresses, his persona changes drastically and it is the huge change and dichotomy from the original Lutz to psycho Lutz that makes this picture work.In fact, the majority of the movie's real scares comes early on in the movie where we are uncertain and a little weirded out by Lutz's sudden mood changes.  This, coupled with the creaky house, voices, dead children, horrific images, etc from the beginning of the movie creates a perfect atmosphere for the movie.  It builds up pretty nicely until the end.  My main and really only complaint is that the tension gets incredibly high and then the events leading up to the climax don't seem as scary.  (MINOR SPOILER) When Lutz finally loses it ala Shining it was a moment that should have ratcheted up the tension even higher but it didn't for my friends and me which is too bad since the rest of the movie was frightening as hell.Of course the cynics out there will say it's all been done, the creaking house noises, the blood dripping, the flies, etc. but it's a remake and if it didn't include those slight homages to the original you couldn't really call it Amityville Horror.  For what it's worth, it's a standard haunted house movie with some nice performances.  But, when you pay to see a horror film, you pay to get the crap scared out of you and I think it was evident in the number of shaking people leaving the theatre that this was accomplished.With the current onslaught of not-so-good horror movies out there (Alone in the Dark, Boogeyman) to the okay horror movies (Ring 2 and Cursed), this movie stands above them.  So while I say that this is the 2nd best horror film I've seen this year, it hasn't had the greatest challenge in my opinion.  So far, the only movie that easily surpases this one is a French film called Haute Tension (High Tension) which will be released here in the states later this summer and can also be ordered on DVD from some websites.  My recommendation is to miss most of the horror films out right now and catch Amityville Horror.  It is a pretty decent horror flick that hasn't been dumbed down to a pg-13 rating.  It's visceral, in your face, and is scarier than most movies out right now.  And that, my friends, is enough for me to spend my $8.",4,2nd best horror film this year,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,3372,"['Remakes', 'are', 'usually', 'frowned', 'critics', 'normal', 'viewers', 'seldom', 'rise', 'source', 'material', 'horror', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'picture', 'remakes', 'right', 'now', 'was', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', 'were', 'interesting', 'not', 'ultimately', 'as', 'good', 'source', 'material', 'Later', 'year', 'will', 'have', 'House', 'Wax', 'then', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'movie', 'ripe', 'remake', 'pulled', 'off', 'admirably.Part', 'reason', 'ironically', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'playing', 'George', 'Lutz', 'eyebrows', 'raised', 'how', 'could', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'do', 'insane', 'person', 'Here', 'actor', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'goofball', 'roles', 'such', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Hannibal', 'Blade', '3', 'goofball', 'persona', 'George', 'Lutz', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'creepier', 'bushy', 'James', 'Brolin', 'original', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'Reynold', 'Lutz', 'bit', 'calmer', 'definitely', 'normal', 'character', 'Reynolds', 'However', 'movie', 'persona', 'changes', 'drastically', 'huge', 'change', 'dichotomy', 'original', 'Lutz', 'psycho', 'Lutz', 'picture', 'fact', 'majority', 'movie', 'real', 'scares', 'early', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'uncertain', 'little', 'weirded', 'out', 'Lutz', 'sudden', 'mood', 'changes', 'coupled', 'creaky', 'house', 'voices', 'dead', 'children', 'horrific', 'images', 'etc', 'beginning', 'movie', 'perfect', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'up', 'pretty', 'nicely', 'end', 'main', 'really', 'only', 'complaint', 'tension', 'incredibly', 'high', 'then', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'climax', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'scary', 'MINOR', 'SPOILER', 'When', 'Lutz', 'finally', 'ala', 'Shining', 'was', 'moment', 'should', 'have', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'tension', 'even', 'higher', 'did', ""n't"", 'friends', 'too', 'bad', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'frightening', 'hell.Of', 'course', 'cynics', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'say', 'been', 'done', 'creaking', 'house', 'noises', 'blood', 'dripping', 'flies', 'etc', 'remake', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'slight', 'homages', 'original', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'what', 'worth', 'standard', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'nice', 'performances', 'when', 'pay', 'see', 'horror', 'film', 'pay', 'get', 'crap', 'scared', 'think', 'was', 'evident', 'number', 'shaking', 'people', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'was', 'current', 'onslaught', 'not-so-good', 'horror', 'movies', 'there', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'Boogeyman', 'okay', 'horror', 'movies', 'Ring', '2', 'Cursed', 'movie', 'So', 'say', '2nd', 'best', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', ""n't"", 'had', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'opinion', 'So', 'far', 'only', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'French', 'film', 'called', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'High', 'Tension', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'here', 'states', 'later', 'summer', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'websites', 'recommendation', 'miss', 'most', 'horror', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'catch', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'pretty', 'decent', 'horror', 'flick', ""n't"", 'been', 'dumbed', 'pg-13', 'rating', 'visceral', 'face', 'scarier', 'most', 'movies', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'friends', 'enough', 'spend', '8']",The Amityville Horror

Gore ""old_sckool""","[3, 6]","With so many remakes tarnishing horror films during the past few years, it didnt surprise me one bit that this would be a piece of trash. Sure, the first ten minutes probely had more action then the 1979 version, which of course makes it so silly and ludicrious since this is supposed to be based on a true story. Let me state that there are those that think this is true, and others that think it was a made up hoex. I myself, happen to believe it was true, even though there wasnt any real evidence of any happenings. If you believe, the ORIGINAL is a definate fright, and still gives me goose bumps. The orginal was much very accurate to the book, which is a fine read. This remake doesnt even touch on the supense as the book or the 1979 version. This is why so many horror movies fail and that hollywood writers are running out of ideas. The slow paced suspense that builds up our fear meters seems to not be in the agenda of most hollywood films. Instead of that we get pretty much a bloodbath and more bodycount then Rambo. I dont detest violence or anything, I love a great splatter flick. But when you take stories such as this, or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which were made to build up suspense slowly, and try to make it a fast paced action bloodbath, then most of the time it fails. This is why most remakes suck, as you are taking away from what you dont see (which can be more suspenseful and terrifying) and adding more of what you didnt see in the orginals, but it just tarnishs the film. Even though films like Saw and Hostel, use tons of violence, there still is a great suspense factor added, which adds more to the story making it more shocking and frighting. Blair Witch and Open Water, two indie films, use the same suspensful story which make them great. If Blair Witch was made for todays younger audience, it probely would have bombed, since I think todays younger crowd just doesnt get it. If you really want to see this and have interest, please check out the 1979 version or read the book.

But, I don't think there inappropriate.""- The Lutz family tries to figure out whats for dinner in their haunted house on Ocean Avenue, while an interviewer prys the truth out of the real George Lutz on what he thinks of the remake to ""The Amityville Horror""Bad remake to the sub-par 1979 original. The true horror here is the film being touted as based on a true story, & the truth being all but left out of the film (once again, MGM didn't consult with George Lutz & when Lutz tried to communicate with the studio he got slapped with a, still pending, lawsuit). With MGM hitting rock bottom financially (Sony Entertainment bought MGM out this past week) & the studios last big hit (the last Bond movie, Die Another Day) was over 2+ years ago its no wonder that MGM gave the go ahead to Michael Bay (of all people) to do a remake of one of its older films. The results, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just plain suck.In November of 1973, in Amityville, New York, the Defeo family was massacred by the families oldest son, Ronnie Jr. (its still the most heinous act ever committed in the village's history).One year later, George & Kathy Lutz, with Kathy's three kids & the family dog, Harry, move into 112 Ocean Avenue after buying it for a steal at roughly eighty thousand dollars. 28 days later the family flee their house in terror saying that the house is so very haunted and vowing never to return leaving their personal belongings behind.The above statements are true & are well documented (DeFeo is serving six life sentences for his crimes against his family). What isn't true is the events that take place throughout the remake of this film. The real problem is, if a film states that its based on a true story, then the film should definitely stick to the true source material that inspires it.Here is the truth according to George Lutz:- There were cold spots throughout the house, including the basement, kitchen, & sewing room. He did always feel a chill and was sick but never was he obsessed with chopping firewood, or carrying an axe around the house. According to George, he never chopped wood at all! He also didn't kill the family dog (thats just brutal).- The Jody entity wasn't a girl, or related to the DeFeo's, but was a pig-like demon that made ""friends"" with George's stepdaughter. In the A&E; History's Mysteries episode on the house, George states that he saw two cloven-hoof like footprints next to his stepdaughters footprints outside in the snow throughout the backyard. At night, George & Kathy would spot a pair of glowing animal-like eyes peering in through the windows of the house, no matter what floor of the house they were on. One evening, George breaks down in anger & throws a chair at the eyes smashing the window it was peering into, with the entity letting out a high pitched piglike squeal & snorting off into the night. This part of the story still gives me the creeps.- Father Piccoro did bless the house. While blessing a small room on the second floor, Piccaro did feel something slap the back of his head, telling him in a whisper to get out of the house. He told the Lutz family as long as no one was to room up there, the room would be fine. Kathy says that the room was going to be turned into a sewing room.- On one of the worst nights, George awoke to find his wife slowly levitating out of bed, while on the floor above he could hear his stepkids scream and cry in terror as their beds were slammed up & down on the floor. Harry, the family dog, was pacing in fear and throwing up. George was helpless being mysteriously pinned to the bed, unable to help his family.There is a lot more.

924894,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000AA4JKW,Tim Janson,"[2, 3]","I had high hopes for this remake.  The original 1979 film was a decent film but hardly a classic and certainly didn't do justice to the book which is one of the most terrifying books I had ever read.  But instead of improving upon the original, director Andrew Douglas, in his first major directing credit, goes instead for cheap scares and overused horror cliches and changes the story so much as to become completely unrecognizable from Jay Anson's book.You know the story...Ronald DeFeo kills his entire family in 1974 by shooting them with a shotgun as they slept.  He claims voices told him to do it.  A year later, George and Kathy Lutz move into the home with their 3 kids and dog Harry.  The colonial is way under priced and the deal of a lifetime and the Lutz's jump at the chance to get it.  Almost immediately the sinister house begins to affect the family.  Daughter Chelsea begins seeing and talking to an imaginary friend named Jodie who is the spirit of little murdered Jodie Defeo.  Here is overused horror cliche' #1...the creepy little girl ghost.  Seems every horror film these days has to have a creepy little girl ghost in it.  Of course in the book and original film Jodie was a pig whose shining red eyes George would see in Chelea's window.George is also affected by the home first with an unnatural chill.  He begins to spend much of his time in the basement feeding wood into the furnace.  Again, this is a change when it was the fireplace in the living room that George spent his time around.  A home in the mid-1970's doesn't have a forced air furnace?  George also begins seeing strange things which brings us to overused horror cliche #2.  You know whenever someone bends over a sink and then back up straight that there is going to be a terrifying image in the mirror.  Douglas gets huge mileage out of this cliche having twisted demonic faces appaear to george in mirrors, in the water of his boathouse, even on screen as he watches a home movie.George is becoming more and more hostile to his wife and step-children and increasingly violent due to the house's influence.The original film did a far better job of showing George's gradual decline into madness but this is streamlined here in order to show more fancy digital effects.Oh...and someone please explain why the ghost of Jodie has a single bullet hole through her forehead if she was killed by a shotgun???  While the book and original film had all of the family experiencing very tangible effects such as blood dripping from the walls, carpet being rolled up, black goo pouring from toilets and sinks, Douglas seeks to go for a more psychological angle to the horror and it just doesn't work as well.  Douglas and script writer Scott Kosar come up with some half-brained plot about a 17th century reverend who tortured and murdered indians on the site where the home is located which is completely unnecessary and over the top.I like Ryan Reynolds but it's hard buying him in this role after his long string of sophmoric comedies.  Both he and Mellisa George who played Kathy Lutz were a bit too young...or at least young looking, for their roles in this film.All in all, a wonderful opportunity was missed to improve upon a so-so original film.",2,A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,3238,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'remake', 'original', '1979', 'film', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'hardly', 'classic', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'book', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'books', 'had', 'ever', 'read', 'instead', 'improving', 'original', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Douglas', 'first', 'major', 'directing', 'credit', 'instead', 'cheap', 'scares', 'overused', 'horror', 'cliches', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'become', 'completely', 'unrecognizable', 'Jay', 'Anson', 'book.You', 'know', 'story', 'Ronald', 'DeFeo', 'entire', 'family', '1974', 'shooting', 'shotgun', 'slept', 'voices', 'told', 'do', 'year', 'later', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'move', 'home', '3', 'kids', 'dog', 'Harry', 'colonial', 'way', 'priced', 'deal', 'lifetime', 'Lutz', 'jump', 'chance', 'get', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'sinister', 'house', 'affect', 'family', 'Daughter', 'Chelsea', 'seeing', 'talking', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Jodie', 'who', 'spirit', 'little', 'murdered', 'Jodie', 'Defeo', 'Here', 'overused', 'horror', 'cliche', '1', 'creepy', 'little', 'girl', 'ghost', 'horror', 'film', 'days', 'have', 'creepy', 'little', 'girl', 'ghost', 'course', 'book', 'original', 'film', 'Jodie', 'was', 'pig', 'shining', 'red', 'eyes', 'George', 'would', 'see', 'Chelea', 'window.George', 'also', 'affected', 'home', 'first', 'unnatural', 'chill', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'basement', 'feeding', 'wood', 'furnace', 'Again', 'change', 'when', 'was', 'fireplace', 'living', 'room', 'George', 'spent', 'time', 'around', 'home', 'mid-1970', ""n't"", 'have', 'forced', 'air', 'furnace', 'George', 'also', 'seeing', 'strange', 'things', 'overused', 'horror', 'cliche', '2', 'know', 'whenever', 'someone', 'sink', 'then', 'back', 'up', 'straight', 'going', 'be', 'terrifying', 'image', 'mirror', 'Douglas', 'huge', 'mileage', 'cliche', 'having', 'twisted', 'demonic', 'appaear', 'george', 'mirrors', 'water', 'boathouse', 'even', 'screen', 'home', 'movie.George', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'hostile', 'wife', 'step-children', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'due', 'house', 'influence.The', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'George', 'gradual', 'decline', 'madness', 'streamlined', 'here', 'order', 'show', 'more', 'fancy', 'digital', 'effects.Oh', 'someone', 'please', 'explain', 'why', 'ghost', 'Jodie', 'single', 'bullet', 'hole', 'forehead', 'was', 'killed', 'shotgun', 'book', 'original', 'film', 'had', 'family', 'experiencing', 'very', 'tangible', 'effects', 'such', 'blood', 'dripping', 'walls', 'carpet', 'being', 'rolled', 'up', 'black', 'goo', 'pouring', 'toilets', 'sinks', 'Douglas', 'go', 'more', 'psychological', 'angle', 'horror', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Douglas', 'script', 'writer', 'Scott', 'Kosar', 'come', 'up', 'half-brained', 'plot', '17th', 'century', 'reverend', 'who', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'indians', 'site', 'where', 'home', 'located', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'top.I', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'hard', 'buying', 'role', 'long', 'string', 'sophmoric', 'comedies', 'Mellisa', 'George', 'who', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'young', 'least', 'young', 'looking', 'roles', 'film.All', 'wonderful', 'opportunity', 'was', 'missed', 'improve', 'so-so', 'original', 'film']",The Amityville Horror

This one definately has more replay value as it is beautifully shot and well acted. Let's face it, directors and the movie making technology they use are constantly evolving.

Now I watch the original film and actually find it quite boring. This remake injects some life into the story and brings it to a whole new audience.

924897,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AA4JKW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","What you see in `The Amityville Horror' is not suspense; it is a chain of shocks. One good thing about the remake of the hit film `The Amityville Horror' (which spawned countless sequels, one being 3D with then unknown Meg Ryan) is that it is never boring. While you are well aware that the film lacks originality, something always happens every five minutes, accompanied with loud soundtrack and occasional scares. Another is that the film (90 minutes) is much shorter than the 1979 original by more than 20 minutes. Surely the hectic pace of the story is what you can expect from the co-producer Michael Bay.[HOUSES DON'T KILL PEOPLE] This eternally popular `haunted house' theme needs no explanation. The Lutz Family buys an old house which is suspiciously cheap. And it turns out that another family is killed by one demented brother only one year ago. And in a month George and Kathy Lutz realize that they made a big mistake.What a big mistake. They didn't give much thought about purchasing a house in which horrible murders were committed. But George (Ryan Reynolds) goes, `Houses don't kill people; people kill people.' These words sound very familiar, but never mind. The point is, Kathy (Melissa George) soon finds out that her lovely daughter Chelsea starts to act strangely, talking to an imaginary friend. Add to that, Chelsea's baby-sitter is mentally shocked and is sent to hospital after unwisely staying where she shouldn't (as these people always do).These set-pieces keep coming to us like avalanche of horrors. At first it is pretty scary, but as the film goes on, probably most of the audiences would be able to anticipate the timing of the next shock. I don't say the film is scare-less, but these scares gradually get easier and cheaper. The brief explanations about the site of the house belong to the gory scenes of `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Philip Baker Hall (as a cameo) plays a priest, but his experience in the house is already known to those who have seen the original. The difference is that the remake does it with much bigger and louder effects.`The Amityville Horror' is not awful as some critics imply. The performances of the actors, especially those of the child actors are very good, and because of the slick pace of the film it gets seldom dull and boring. But at the same time, you must be thinking to yourself about the following two questions: `Why did they buy the house?"" and ""Why don't they run away from the house?"" You are right, but stop thinking about them and only then you find it moderately entertaining.",3,The Haunted House Story You Have Heard Before: Fast-Paced and Reasonable,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,2562,"['What', 'see', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'not', 'suspense', 'chain', 'shocks', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'remake', 'hit', 'film', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'spawned', 'countless', 'sequels', 'one', 'being', '3D', 'then', 'unknown', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'never', 'boring', 'are', 'well', 'aware', 'film', 'originality', 'something', 'always', 'five', 'minutes', 'accompanied', 'loud', 'soundtrack', 'occasional', 'scares', 'film', '90', 'minutes', 'much', 'shorter', '1979', 'original', 'more', '20', 'minutes', 'Surely', 'hectic', 'pace', 'story', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'co-producer', 'Michael', 'Bay', '[', 'HOUSES', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'KILL', 'PEOPLE', ']', 'eternally', 'popular', 'haunted', 'house', 'theme', 'explanation', 'Lutz', 'Family', 'old', 'house', 'suspiciously', 'cheap', 'out', 'family', 'killed', 'one', 'demented', 'brother', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'ago', 'month', 'George', 'Kathy', 'Lutz', 'realize', 'made', 'big', 'mistake.What', 'big', 'mistake', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'thought', 'purchasing', 'house', 'horrible', 'murders', 'were', 'committed', 'George', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Houses', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'people', 'people', 'kill', 'people', 'words', 'sound', 'very', 'familiar', 'never', 'mind', 'point', 'Kathy', 'Melissa', 'George', 'soon', 'out', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'Chelsea', 'act', 'strangely', 'talking', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Add', 'Chelsea', 'baby-sitter', 'mentally', 'shocked', 'sent', 'hospital', 'unwisely', 'staying', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'people', 'always', 'do', '.These', 'set-pieces', 'keep', 'coming', 'avalanche', 'horrors', 'first', 'pretty', 'scary', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'anticipate', 'timing', 'next', 'shock', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'scare-less', 'scares', 'gradually', 'get', 'easier', 'cheaper', 'brief', 'explanations', 'site', 'house', 'belong', 'gory', 'scenes', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'cameo', 'priest', 'experience', 'house', 'already', 'known', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'difference', 'remake', 'much', 'bigger', 'louder', 'effects.', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'not', 'awful', 'critics', 'imply', 'performances', 'actors', 'especially', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'slick', 'pace', 'film', 'seldom', 'dull', 'boring', 'same', 'time', 'must', 'be', 'thinking', 'yourself', 'following', 'two', 'questions', 'Why', 'did', 'buy', 'house', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'house', 'are', 'right', 'stop', 'thinking', 'only', 'then', 'find', 'moderately', 'entertaining']",The Amityville Horror

They should,for God's sake get out! If the powers that be of the film company and producers,directors and such put a subtitle,Based On A True Story,then they should at least stick to it. I don't even think the ""made up"" version of the true story is even,at all frightening. If you know the real story and have read the book, you will,of course be truly disappointed and if you are not very familiar to the story or the book, you will probubly be laughing and asking yourself why you even bothered in the first place. The only things that they got right in this film were the names of George and Kathy Lutz. The house doesn't even remotely resemble the real house. I mean the house in this film,looks like it should be haunted! Wow! Great production design! The screenwriter should've been fired for writing in  random things from the story and just throwing them all around and making idiotic things up to try and scare an audiance (who would actually believe that holy water burns and SIZZLES when it gets sprinkled onto the house)and the director obviously had no idea that there was a true story that this was based on. I guess he just watched the original Amityville Horror,eh? The ghost Jody wasn't even one of the slain DeFeo's,in the true story. It was the entity that had projected itself as a harmless animal to the Lutz's little girl in reality. There were never any ghosts left behind from the slain, Defeo family. The actors are laughable and over the top and even the man who played the priest looks as if he dosen't even want to be in the movie, let alone go back in the house. Every cliche from every haunted house ,horror movie is in this film(and not done well,i must say). I can see why the real George Lutz was extremely against the making of this film. If the filmmakers would have been more faithful to the book,it would have been a truly,genuine scary movie. There would have been no reason to make up all this random trash to sell a movie. Maybe someday, some REAL good director and screenwriter can make the real frightening Amityville Horror story, probubly won't happen, but I guess I can hope.

924899,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000AA4JKW,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is a scary-house movie. It's one of those films about a house being haunted. The film is very loosely based upon a real-story about the Lutz family and the DeFeo family. The DeFeos were the original owners of the Amityville house and 28 days after moving in the father of the family went insane and killed his entire family. Years later the Lutz family purchases the house and moves in. Soon afterwards some really bizarre things start to happen: they start seeing ghosts, the wallpaper peels really funny, and the father, George (Ryan Reynolds) starts acting really strange. As the 28th day of their move in draws near the coincidences between what happens with the Lutzs and the DeFeos becomes too much to ignore.THE AMITVILLE HORROR has some good acting from the entire cast. The story builds up nicely and does a fairly decent job of characterization. However, I really didn't like the movie that much. It really isn't all that frightening and the things that are supposed to be frightening come off looking like expensive special effects gags. There's also the whole bit about the house supposedly being built on an old Indian burial ground (I know the original came out before, but POLTERGEIST handles that much better) and the basement having been used as a sacrificial temple by a colonial-aged witch named J. Katchum--that made no sense at all to me in the movie. I realize that this is either a remake or re-imagining of the original film, so the filmmakers were trying to walk the line between staying true to the spirit of the original, but make it fresh. That would have been alright, but THE AMITYVILLE HORROR wasn't a movie worth remaking in the first place.When's all said and done the thing this version of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR will probably be best remembered for is that it was the last film that MGM released as an independent company (it was bought out by Sony and other studios during the promotion of the movie). What a sad way for a great studio of the past to die out.

924902,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000AA4JKW,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 1]","The Amityville Horror is by far the best and scariest horror film in recent years. It's scarier than previous ""haunted houses or motels movies"" such as The Haunting, Identity, The People Under The Stairs, and last year's The Grudge. Since it's based on a true story, it's even more compelling and powerful. It's filled with plenty of shocking and scary visuals, and the story is real and intense that it's quite a gripping experience to watch this freak feast! A bonus treat of eye-candy is offered by Ryan Reynolds to his fans if they haven't seen him all buffed up in Blade:Trinity last year. He's drop-dead gorgeous in this movie, with a body that made a lot of female audiences go,""Ooh,Wow!"" for at least four scenes. I guessed it was appropiate that he needed to built an ultra-muscular body for his role since his character is in construction work.The story is about the Amityville old house that is possessed by a powerful demon. It took place in Deer Lake in the '70s. The intro of the film showed one possessed member of the Deferoe family killing all of his family on the 28th day at 3:15am since they moved in. A year later, a new family moved into the same evil house. George(Ryan Reynolds) and his wife Kathy(Melisa George) disregard the realtor when they were told  about the killing that took place in the house. They took it, because it was so cheap. With all good intension, they believe that their family will make a happy home there. George is the step father to Kathy's two sons and one daughter. Their dad died and Kathy remarried to George.Between day one and the final manifestation of the evil force, many strange, wierd, and scary things occur in their house. Chelsea(Chloe Moretz) had the ability to see an earth-bound ghost girl from the previous family, and they became friends. She was warned that her family must abandon the house, but the parents ignored the message. Gradually, ""the voices that said Katch'em and Kill'em"" got into George's mind, and he started to lose it one day at a time. Now the only person who started to believe that something is really wrong with the house is Kathy, and she goes to seek the help of a local preist(Father Callaway/Philip Baker Hall)......The characters are very well-written here, and the development of the story from beginning to the climatic moment is at a perfect pace. Every 5 minutes there is something very scary to happen, and the performances, especially from Reynolds and Melissa George are powerful and intense. The three kids and the ghost girl are also effective in some of the scary moments. The sudden popping up of evil faces is what made many audiences scream throughout the film. Philip Baker Hall, previously displayed great performance in Magnolia has too little screen time here. His best scene was when he tried to perform a blessing vitual inside the evil house.This film should be a must-see for horror fans, and definitely not-to-be-missed by Ryan Reynolds fans, because he deserves extra credit for his gripping performance as well as showing off his fabulous body!",5,Welcome to the House of Evil and Broken Dreams.,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,3063,"['Amityville', 'Horror', 'far', 'best', 'scariest', 'horror', 'film', 'recent', 'years', 'scarier', 'previous', 'haunted', 'houses', 'motels', 'movies', 'such', 'Haunting', 'Identity', 'People', 'Stairs', 'last', 'year', 'Grudge', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'powerful', 'filled', 'plenty', 'shocking', 'scary', 'visuals', 'story', 'real', 'intense', 'quite', 'gripping', 'experience', 'watch', 'freak', 'feast', 'bonus', 'treat', 'eye-candy', 'offered', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'buffed', 'up', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'last', 'year', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'body', 'made', 'lot', 'female', 'audiences', 'go', 'Ooh', 'Wow', 'least', 'four', 'scenes', 'guessed', 'was', 'appropiate', 'needed', 'built', 'ultra-muscular', 'body', 'role', 'character', 'construction', 'work.The', 'story', 'Amityville', 'old', 'house', 'possessed', 'powerful', 'demon', 'took', 'place', 'Deer', 'Lake', ""'70s"", 'intro', 'film', 'showed', 'one', 'possessed', 'member', 'Deferoe', 'family', 'killing', 'family', '28th', 'day', '3:15am', 'moved', 'year', 'later', 'new', 'family', 'moved', 'same', 'evil', 'house', 'George', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'wife', 'Kathy', 'Melisa', 'George', 'disregard', 'realtor', 'when', 'were', 'told', 'killing', 'took', 'place', 'house', 'took', 'was', 'so', 'cheap', 'good', 'intension', 'believe', 'family', 'will', 'make', 'happy', 'home', 'there', 'George', 'step', 'father', 'Kathy', 'two', 'sons', 'one', 'daughter', 'dad', 'died', 'Kathy', 'remarried', 'George.Between', 'day', 'one', 'final', 'manifestation', 'evil', 'force', 'many', 'strange', 'wierd', 'scary', 'things', 'occur', 'house', 'Chelsea', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'had', 'ability', 'see', 'earth-bound', 'ghost', 'girl', 'previous', 'family', 'became', 'friends', 'was', 'warned', 'family', 'must', 'abandon', 'house', 'parents', 'ignored', 'message', 'Gradually', 'voices', 'said', ""Katch'em"", ""Kill'em"", 'got', 'George', 'mind', 'started', 'lose', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'Now', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'started', 'believe', 'something', 'really', 'wrong', 'house', 'Kathy', 'seek', 'help', 'local', 'preist', 'Father', 'Callaway/Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well-written', 'here', 'development', 'story', 'beginning', 'climatic', 'moment', 'perfect', 'pace', '5', 'minutes', 'something', 'very', 'scary', 'happen', 'performances', 'especially', 'Reynolds', 'Melissa', 'George', 'are', 'powerful', 'intense', 'three', 'kids', 'ghost', 'girl', 'are', 'also', 'effective', 'scary', 'moments', 'sudden', 'popping', 'evil', 'what', 'made', 'many', 'audiences', 'scream', 'film', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'previously', 'displayed', 'great', 'performance', 'Magnolia', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'here', 'best', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'tried', 'perform', 'blessing', 'vitual', 'evil', 'house.This', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'must-see', 'horror', 'fans', 'definitely', 'not-to-be-missed', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'fans', 'extra', 'credit', 'gripping', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'off', 'fabulous', 'body']",The Amityville Horror

The new Amityville Horrow is not the original, but it is a darn good film in its own right.I found the film sexy, scary, well-acted, and very entertaining. Ryan Reynolds as George Lutz, and Melissa George as Kathy Lutz, put in very believable performances. Their surrounding cast of children add to the film's immersion and intangibles as well.I know I have seen the first Amityville Horror, and to be honest I don't recall much other than a lot of flies (I am nearly 40, and was 12 when it came out), but I can't imagine how it could be much better than the remake. Don't get me wrong, I am sure it is a great film, but this version is pretty darn good for a horror film.If you haven't seen it because of the critics who say ""It isn't the original"", you're missing out.Total Score (out of 100) = 5931 (out of 50).

924904,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000AA4JKW,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","I have to admit that I'm not a fan of haunted house movies, but I recently saw one on Syfy that I thought was pretty entertaining, part creepy and part campy. So I decided to give this 2005 version of ""The Amityville Horror"" a try since I'm a fan of Melissa George. The movie did not disappoint and it successfully piqued my interest in the whole Amityville Horror legend (check it out at Wikipedia). Unlike the other haunted house film I saw recently ""The Amityville Horror"" maintains a serious tone throughout.THE PLOT: Based on a true story, a couple buy an old house on Long Island in late 1975. The house has a diabolic history, but they purchase it anyway because it's such a great deal. After 28 days they flee for their lives leaving behind all their possessions.Like I said, I'm a fan of Melissa George. She's just a gorgeous woman and I enjoy watching her. Also on hand is Rachel Nichols who played Tamara in the 2011 remake of ""Conan the Barbarian."" Rachel plays a hippie chick babysitter here and she's perfect for the role. The babysitter's arrogant and scoffs at the diabolic history of the house but, let's just say, she leaves as a true believer. This was a great sequence that really perked my interest at a time it needed it (as I was starting to get bored at that point). In any event, I had to reassess my appraisal of Ms. Nichols after seeing her in this film. She definitely won my respect.The guy who plays the husband is fine, Ryan Reynolds, but he seems TOO in-shape for the role, but I'm sure the ladies appreciate it.Some may accuse the film of ripping off aspects of ""The Shining,"" but keep in mind that the original ""The Amityville Horror"" was released a year before ""The Shining.""There's not much else to say, at a lean 90-minutes the film wisely doesn't overstay its welcome. Like I said, I don't even like haunted house films but this one won me over. It works for what it is and has a similar tone to the excellent 2009 remake of ""The Last House on the Left (Rated & Unrated Versions),"" although it fails to achieve the greatness of that picture.The film was shot at Silver Lake and Salem, Wisconsin, with other parts filmed in the Chicago area of Illinois.GRADE: A- or B+",5,Effective haunted house movie,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,2205,"['have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'haunted', 'house', 'movies', 'recently', 'saw', 'one', 'Syfy', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'part', 'creepy', 'part', 'campy', 'decided', 'give', '2005', 'version', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'try', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Melissa', 'George', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'successfully', 'piqued', 'interest', 'whole', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'legend', 'check', 'out', 'Wikipedia', 'other', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'saw', 'recently', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'serious', 'tone', 'throughout.THE', 'PLOT', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'couple', 'buy', 'old', 'house', 'Long', 'Island', 'late', '1975', 'house', 'diabolic', 'history', 'purchase', 'anyway', 'such', 'great', 'deal', '28', 'days', 'flee', 'lives', 'leaving', 'possessions.Like', 'said', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Melissa', 'George', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Also', 'hand', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'who', 'played', 'Tamara', '2011', 'remake', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Rachel', 'hippie', 'chick', 'babysitter', 'here', 'perfect', 'role', 'babysitter', 'arrogant', 'scoffs', 'diabolic', 'history', 'house', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'true', 'believer', 'was', 'great', 'sequence', 'really', 'perked', 'interest', 'time', 'needed', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'bored', 'point', 'event', 'had', 'reassess', 'appraisal', 'Ms.', 'Nichols', 'seeing', 'film', 'definitely', 'won', 'respect.The', 'guy', 'who', 'husband', 'fine', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'TOO', 'in-shape', 'role', ""'m"", 'sure', 'ladies', 'appreciate', 'it.Some', 'may', 'accuse', 'film', 'ripping', 'off', 'aspects', 'Shining', 'keep', 'mind', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'Shining', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'lean', '90-minutes', 'film', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'haunted', 'house', 'films', 'one', 'won', 'over', 'what', 'similar', 'tone', 'excellent', '2009', 'remake', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Rated', 'Unrated', 'Versions', 'achieve', 'greatness', 'picture.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Silver', 'Lake', 'Salem', 'Wisconsin', 'other', 'parts', 'filmed', 'Chicago', 'area', 'Illinois.GRADE', 'A-', 'B+']",The Amityville Horror
