1056373,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B000NDI3Q2,Allen Chapman,"[9, 10]","For many years I thought this show was just something from my imagination. I was very little (around age four or five) when this show was on and honestly the only thing I remembered was the theme song. To have this show on DVD finally is great. It proves that I didn't imagine this!! What's interesting watching the show today is how adult and politically incorrect the show actually is, that is what makes it so great. In the very first scene of the first episode the father makes fat jokes at the expense of his daughter. Then there are the racist comments coming from the next door neighbor. The show is basically All In The Family in animated form. For fans of The Simpsons and more so Family Guy check out this show and see where the blueprint for those shows came from.The animation leaves something to be desired, but the storylines are really funny and in today's uptight society you'll be amazed that a show like this was ever on the air, let alone a cartoon!",5,I didn't imagine this show!!!,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,968,"['many', 'years', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'imagination', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'age', 'four', 'five', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'honestly', 'only', 'thing', 'remembered', 'was', 'theme', 'song', 'have', 'show', 'DVD', 'finally', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'What', 'interesting', 'watching', 'show', 'today', 'how', 'adult', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'show', 'actually', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'father', 'fat', 'jokes', 'expense', 'daughter', 'Then', 'are', 'racist', 'comments', 'coming', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'show', 'basically', 'Family', 'animated', 'form', 'fans', 'Simpsons', 'more', 'so', 'Family', 'Guy', 'check', 'out', 'show', 'see', 'where', 'blueprint', 'shows', 'came', 'from.The', 'animation', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'storylines', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'today', 'uptight', 'society', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'show', 'was', 'ever', 'air', 'let', 'alone', 'cartoon']",Wait Till Your Father Gets Home S1 (DVD)

The fact Hanna-Barbera shows like ""jabberjaw"" and ""Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels"" remain unreleased even though they are probably easier to market makes this DVD's release that much sweeter.""Wait till your father gets home"" aired in the early 70's and then enjoyed a short run in syndication- most recently on cartoon network. Following the everyday trials of the Boyle family, the series dealt with topical issues of the day. While they were not the first primetime animated family (i believe the flintstones get that honor) they were thr predesessors to shows like the Simpsons and King of the Hill. The show is certainly not politically correct with Harry's neighbor spouting about communists and women's liberation and tackling the subject of obesity and opting out.

And, just as ""All in the Family"" broke new ground, so does this fantastic Hanna-Barbera classic.  The hot-button topics of the early 70s are all here -- feminism, bigotry, even nudism! -- and the scripts are superly written, surprisingly bold and truly funny.  Top-notch voice talent, too, featuring Tom Bosley, Allan Melvin, John Stevenson, Sandra ""Gladys Kravitz"" Gould, Casey Kasem, and more.Also, THANK YOU to this set's producers for keeping the show's laugh track, as it originally aired.  Given that the series is a bonafide sitcom and aired in primetime, the laugh track is totally appropriate here -- and actually adds to the fun.If you are a ""Simpsons"" fan, that show would be unthinkable had WAIT TIL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME not paved the way.

I wasn't aware of this show back when it came out so many years ago.  But i got into it while seeing it on cable more than a few times so i did the search and found it here.  Bought it and within a couple episodes i was already hooked.  It took me by surprise some of things that get discussed at first but i realize race relations, feminism, communism, sexual liberation, women's lib and all that was a huge deal especially back in that time era.  So with that i was able to look at those issues and take them to heart and learn a couple things from them as well.  Just so folks know that race gets hit quite a bit in this series...i dont think its enough to stop someone from buying this.  Because its done well and doesnt detract from the series as a whole.I love all the characters in the Boyle family and the show in general especially the youngest son he's like a going to be Donald Trump with all the money he's making in the show.  Very level business type for a kid thats impressive always looking for a deal and coming to the aid of the father.  Chet and his sis always seem to be on the Father about things he's doing and what he should be doing..coming from a guy that hasn't worked a steady job for any amount of time, is out of college and lives at home.  He's not in a position to really go there even though he does much to his Dad's dismay.This is a series that while it has serious undertones they never bring down the show and actually make it better to watch.

Despite the reviews, Harry Boyle is not so much a ""conservative"" in the political sense but a defender of rationality in a world confused by the increasingly divisive politics and social conflict of the early 1970's.  However, Harry is usually able to bridge the gap between his progressive children and his paranoid, bigoted neighbors.  Most importantly, Harry is respectful of his children's point of view while still serving as the moral center of his household. In all, it's a far cheerier world than, say, All in the Family.As far as the animation goes, it's not earthshaking, but it is stylish, with abstract minimalist backgrounds that are quite pleasing.",5,A great family sitcom,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,777,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'program', 'one', 'dimly', 'recalled', 'childhood', 'past', 'reviews', 'Harry', 'Boyle', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'conservative', 'political', 'sense', 'defender', 'rationality', 'world', 'confused', 'increasingly', 'divisive', 'politics', 'social', 'conflict', 'early', '1970', 'However', 'Harry', 'usually', 'able', 'bridge', 'gap', 'progressive', 'children', 'paranoid', 'bigoted', 'neighbors', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Harry', 'respectful', 'children', 'point', 'view', 'still', 'serving', 'moral', 'center', 'household', 'far', 'cheerier', 'world', 'say', 'Family.As', 'far', 'animation', 'not', 'earthshaking', 'stylish', 'abstract', 'minimalist', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'quite', 'pleasing']",Wait Till Your Father Gets Home S1 (DVD)

I remember when the cartoon network briefly aired the episodes in prime-time several years ago. Unfortunately they were recorded on vhs from a old tv at the time, so the episodes had very poor sound quality. At that point I was just happy to record one of my favorite cartoon shows of the 1970's!!!The Boyle family included father Harry Boyle(voiced by Tom Bosley of Happy Days), wife Irma, oldest son Chet, daughter Alice, and youngest son Jamie. The oldest son Chet was a college dropout, who still lived at home and never really wanted to work. Alice was the sweet overweight daughter who was always the free thinker, and wanting to try new things, and the youngest son Jamie was the little capitalist always trying to make a fast buck! The mother Irma was just plain hilarious in her way of thinking and that whiney nasal voice simply added to the humor! There was also Harry's nextdoor neighbor Ralph, who was this military fanatic, that was paranoid about so-called communist, and being ready to attack at anytime.Althought Wait til your father gets home only lasted about 2 full seasons, they included some very funny episodes and funny guest stars like the voices of Don Knotts, Phyliss Diller, and Monty Hall. One of my favorite episodes was when Dad Harry Boyle decided to build a swimming pool and the nightmare that came along with it. I also loved the episode when the Boyles go on a summer vacation and there are nudist hanging around on the beach. Wow! I can't wait to enjoy this show all over again on dvd!!!

I own all the other Hanna-Barbera DVD collections, and as an avid collector of special edition DVDs, I look forward to each new Hanna-Barbera release. It gives me a chance to own all of those I've watched as a kid and catch up on those I've not got to know as much. However, being someone who's just under 30 years of age, I had never even heard of ""Wait Till Your Father Gets Home"".Though, after buying this collection this morning and having watched a couple of episodes, I have to say that I actually like this old classic. With a touch of modern animation (for its time) and with the real life issues that were plaguing the baby boomer generation as they were growing up, this show will actually entertain (perhaps even shock) you as you become engrossed in it.Compariable to the Simpsons and Family Guy, this is the show that started prime time network animation as we know it today. As due with All in the Family, this show seems to tackle issues that many considered too liberal for tv (then and now).The animation drawings were a bit suprising to me at first. Not exactly ""state of the art"", but after watching these episodes more, I believe the different forms of drawing in the backgrounds (even the charecters) were a signature of its time and generation. It's different, and even looks a bit cheap. But after watching it more, its apparent that all the art work took as much time to create and construct as the other Hanna-Barbera cartoons before did. From a historical perspective, and as a tribute, I really like this new ""groovy"" animation.I can't wait to watch the rest of the DVD release and anticipate news of the 2nd Season's release.
