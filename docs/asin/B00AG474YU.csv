I wasn't expecting much going into this, but I was hoping it was at least worth my time owning it. My expectations were met and then some, being glad I did purchase this. The story is very good to keep you glued to it, not wanting to miss anything. You know the story is well written when you don't want to miss a thing. Then uptop of the good story, you get the 2 hot leading actresses that do an excellent job. I love hot babes in a good thriller and this is up with them.",4,"I Killed For You, Now You KILL FOR ME",1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,593,"['damn', 'fine', 'movie', 'twist', 'way', 'turn', 'Do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'very', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'going', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'least', 'worth', 'time', 'owning', 'expectations', 'were', 'met', 'then', 'being', 'glad', 'did', 'purchase', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'keep', 'glued', 'not', 'wanting', 'miss', 'anything', 'know', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'thing', 'Then', 'uptop', 'good', 'story', 'get', '2', 'hot', 'leading', 'actresses', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'love', 'hot', 'babes', 'good', 'thriller', 'up']",N/A

The deal becomes I killed your psycho ex boyfriend so now in turn you must kill my abusive father.This is when the twists,turns and the most dramatic and effective part of the story begins.I can't say a lot as not to give away anything but I can say that I was glued to the screen and never quite sure how the plot was going to flow.All in all it is a rewarding viewing experience that won't leave you scratching your head, mad or feeling cheated.I would watch it again so I will probably buy it.",4,Who Do You Trust When It Comes to Murder?,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,830,"['Kill', 'Me', 'was', 'entertaining', 'fast', 'paced', 'thriller', 'good', 'cast', 'stand', 'out', 'being', ""'Tracy"", 'Spiridakos', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'impressive', 'well.The', 'plot', 'Basically', 'two', 'girls', 'become', 'roommates', 'wake', 'local', 'girls', 'disappearance', 'one', 'having', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'type', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'other', 'abusive', 'father', 'deal', 'killed', 'psycho', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'so', 'now', 'turn', 'must', 'kill', 'abusive', 'father.This', 'when', 'twists', 'turns', 'most', 'dramatic', 'effective', 'part', 'story', 'begins.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'lot', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'glued', 'screen', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'plot', 'was', 'going', 'flow.All', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'mad', 'feeling', 'cheated.I', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'probably', 'buy']",N/A

1610502,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B00AG474YU,hredzak,"[3, 4]","Okay.  Plot-wise... this was a pretty good thriller.  It was suspenseful and kept me guessing dang near to the end.  The acting and filming were also excellent.  And my god, were these leads hot!!!  I really enjoyed these aspects of the film, and it's what ultimately earned the 4 stars.  Another reviewer who wrote that this was like a really good Lifetime Movie Network movie was spot on, lol.  I was shocked at how good this actually was!But if you're hoping for the next best lesbian-themed film... forget it.  These two leads have off the charts plausible chemistry and look like the leads I want in ALL my lesfic romances, lol... but this isn't really a romance.  The storyline doesn't quite give them a chance to go there and that was a dang shame!!  They are just the victims of dysfunctional relationships.  What draws them together and bonds them together is not so much a romance, but rather their painful history with men... some dark and creepy stuff that evolves into a rollercoaster of emotional extremes.  But their attraction began as something very sensitive and almost healing.  Really sexy and beautiful.  Loved it.  I'm just sorry it dropped into the icky and unimaginative stereotype of lesbians being beautiful yet violently disturbed women who are undeserving of love.  It won't stop you from being engaged, but you'll wish these leads got a better hand.What basically happens is that dark-haired and pretty Amanda has a roommate who's gone missing.  After some time she rents the room out to a lovely, albeit moody blonde (Haley).  Their initial attraction is palpable and you're gonna love the first 30 minutes or so, lol.  There are long, lingering looks, kissing, and a shower scene... but nothing particularly graphic and no nudity.  What follows is the intervention of a couple of crazy dudes who mess up all the awesome lesbian imagery-- Amanda's stalker and violent ex-boyfriend and Haley's twisted and abusive father.  And these women cannot be at peace until these men are removed from the planet, lol.  (Because a hatred of men bonds lesbos more than the passionately sexy love they could be sharing instead!!)  In any case, you end up not knowing who to trust and wondering who the bad people actually are.  And it is more than a little violent.  Tracy Spiridakos (Haley) is just amazing here... bought her as lesbian 150%.It's worth a watch.  And even as is, it still blows on Nicole Conn's latest as far as lesbians go, lol.  I'd definitely watch it again.",4,kept me on the edge of my seat,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,2494,"['Okay', 'Plot-wise', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'thriller', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'kept', 'guessing', 'dang', 'end', 'acting', 'filming', 'were', 'also', 'excellent', 'god', 'were', 'leads', 'hot', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'aspects', 'film', 'what', 'ultimately', 'earned', '4', 'stars', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'movie', 'was', 'spot', 'lol', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'good', 'actually', 'was', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'next', 'best', 'lesbian-themed', 'film', 'forget', 'two', 'leads', 'have', 'off', 'charts', 'plausible', 'chemistry', 'look', 'leads', 'want', 'ALL', 'lesfic', 'romances', 'lol', ""n't"", 'really', 'romance', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'quite', 'give', 'chance', 'go', 'there', 'was', 'dang', 'shame', 'are', 'just', 'victims', 'dysfunctional', 'relationships', 'What', 'together', 'bonds', 'together', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'romance', 'rather', 'painful', 'history', 'men', 'dark', 'creepy', 'stuff', 'rollercoaster', 'emotional', 'extremes', 'attraction', 'began', 'something', 'very', 'sensitive', 'almost', 'healing', 'Really', 'sexy', 'beautiful', 'Loved', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'dropped', 'icky', 'unimaginative', 'stereotype', 'lesbians', 'being', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'violently', 'disturbed', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'undeserving', 'love', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'engaged', ""'ll"", 'wish', 'leads', 'got', 'better', 'basically', 'dark-haired', 'pretty', 'Amanda', 'roommate', 'who', 'gone', 'missing', 'time', 'room', 'lovely', 'moody', 'blonde', 'Haley', 'initial', 'attraction', 'palpable', ""'re"", 'gon', 'love', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'lol', 'are', 'long', 'lingering', 'looks', 'kissing', 'shower', 'scene', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'What', 'intervention', 'couple', 'crazy', 'dudes', 'who', 'mess', 'up', 'awesome', 'lesbian', 'imagery', 'Amanda', 'stalker', 'violent', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Haley', 'twisted', 'abusive', 'father', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'peace', 'men', 'are', 'removed', 'planet', 'lol', 'hatred', 'men', 'bonds', 'lesbos', 'more', 'passionately', 'sexy', 'love', 'could', 'be', 'sharing', 'instead', 'case', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'trust', 'wondering', 'who', 'bad', 'people', 'actually', 'are', 'more', 'little', 'violent', 'Tracy', 'Spiridakos', 'Haley', 'just', 'amazing', 'here', 'bought', 'lesbian', '150', '%', '.It', 'worth', 'watch', 'even', 'still', 'Nicole', 'Conn', 'latest', 'as', 'far', 'lesbians', 'go', 'lol', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1610508,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AG474YU,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","This is one of those throw away movies that seem to come out straight to DVD and then disappear after a short time on the rack only to reappear on some lame channel that needs filler. That is to say it's not the worst movie ever made but it is far from being one you'll watch more than once if you make it through that.The story revolves around a group of college students, two of which are home and one of which has gone missing. To help pay the rent the two girls take on a new roommate. It becomes convenient that this roommate is having problems with an abusive father since one of the two girls is having problems with an abusive father. Ala STRANGERS ON A TRAIN the two girls decide to help one another out by killing their respective abusers thus negating any connection that the police might find between the killer and the victim.Along the way a semi-lesbian sequence takes place with the two leads finding themselves attracted to one another. As others who have watched the film have noted this seems intended to placate the supposed male need to watch two hot chicks have a go at it. Sorry but I've never found that something worth watching and when used as a sub-plot it seems more forced than natural anyway. It just becomes filler to make a movie that could have been shorter stretch out to 95 minutes.The plot has been used before but that's not what makes the movie one to pass over. Instead it's the fact that not only have we seen this done before (and better) but that the supposed twists don't seem like twists at all. If you don't see the end coming early on then you've not watched many films. If the film is on when nothing else is on then you might want to watch. If you've become a fan of Katie Cassidy (David's daughter and star of TV's ARROW) then you might want to watch.
