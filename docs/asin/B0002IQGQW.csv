Most of our households have problems and in order to get through them, we have to talk about them and work them out.  This one had a twist that was unexpected.

The other star I subtract is because Angelle Brooks is not a very convincing actress. Denise Nicholas is awesome and so is Clarence Williams III. So the three stars are for the veterans that you can only recognize.",3,It was okay,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,338,"['was', 'scene', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'subtract', 'star', 'other', 'star', 'subtract', 'Angelle', 'Brooks', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'actress', 'Denise', 'Nicholas', 'awesome', 'so', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'veterans', 'can', 'only', 'recognize']",N/A
835740,A2PL4KP6QX65EA,B0002IQGQW,Richard C. Jones,"[0, 0]","In the vein of Tennessee Williams, Stanley Bennett Clay's Ritual is an exercise in character study. The Becker clan are characters on the brink. The parents and their offspring in this film are flawed, filled with emotion, and locked in the frustration of straining for something beyond reach. The impending doom for the Becker family seeps into your lungs like dust from a room that hasn't been cleaned in decades. SBC had a distinct and defined vision for his plays and the style in which he wanted to present them. Shawn Michael Howard is restrained in his portrayal of Mason. Denise Nicholas is well aware of her surroundings as Sylvia but is impotent when it comes to her daughter Angelle Brooks' Terri.",5,Great character study,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,708,"['vein', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'Stanley', 'Bennett', 'Clay', 'Ritual', 'exercise', 'character', 'study', 'Becker', 'clan', 'are', 'characters', 'brink', 'parents', 'offspring', 'film', 'are', 'flawed', 'filled', 'emotion', 'locked', 'frustration', 'straining', 'something', 'reach', 'impending', 'doom', 'Becker', 'family', 'lungs', 'dust', 'room', ""n't"", 'been', 'cleaned', 'decades', 'SBC', 'had', 'distinct', 'defined', 'vision', 'plays', 'style', 'wanted', 'present', 'Shawn', 'Michael', 'Howard', 'restrained', 'portrayal', 'Mason', 'Denise', 'Nicholas', 'well', 'aware', 'surroundings', 'Sylvia', 'impotent', 'when', 'daughter', 'Angelle', 'Brooks', 'Terri']",N/A

It started off as being a good movie and then all of a sudden I see a brother and sister doin' the nasty AND THEY SHOWED IT!!!! They couldn't have just left it to our imagination no, I had to see it.  I thought that could've been left out period. I was going to buy this movie from here but when I saw it at Wal-Mart, I went on and bought it.  BIG MISTAKE!! I hate because I can't return it. Please stay away from this movie.
