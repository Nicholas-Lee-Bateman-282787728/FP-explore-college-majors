Indeed, the whole thing is conducted in a really stiff way. One would think that they are at a meeting of the UN council discussing world peace or something like that. Also a writer for Rolling Stone magazine (come on, that is one paper that is over-the-hill and which never really was good with movie reviews)who thinks he is funny and intelligent introduces the whole thing. I mean this is too much. Also some of the actors come over as stiff and much less lively than on the show. James Spader for example was really disappointing: I mean in the show he is fantastic and here...a bore.
