The face is actually popping out outward; I've never seen anything like it. The set is protected with an exterior clear-view box that gives it a really cool (and FREAKY) 3D effect.Having seen all SAW movies prior to this purchase, I watched the special features first. The were informative, interesting, AND entertaining. One disc even had a disturbing video game.If you haven't seen SAW yet, you don't know what you're missing. Absolutely gets a 4.5 by itself.SAW 2 is okay. This one's story is implemented in a different fashion (meaning some like it and some don't). You get to really ""meet"" Jigsaw in this one, but the story seems weak. 3.5 seems about right.I rate SAW 3 a 3.0 because it kind of sucks but it has some great elements. You can't wait to see what happens next.SAW 4 gets a generous 2.0 in my book as it makes no sense by itself. You have to go online after watching it just to shed light on what the message was supposed to be. A good movie won't confuse you. A lazy writer will attempt to confuse you so they don't have to come up with a rational, unexpected, shocking ending.SAW 5 picks up the pace and earns a 3.5. Not a great rating? Well it's not a great movie. It's better than 4.SAW 6 has some great traps. The boring segments that were in 4 & 5 are gone. It gets a well deserved 4.0.SAW 7 completes the series, though I suspect there may be prequels or spin-offs coming. The ending was great. In my opinion this film returns to the authenticity of SAW. It deserves a 4.5.",5,Fix me!

At least this film and it's subsequent sequels can acknowledge the legacy that the far superior Se7en left and show the impact it had. But that's about all it does!This is simply just exploitation plain and simple. The films in the series seem to focus primarily on just how many ways there are to torment and mame the human body with rusty gear-driven gadgets, hypo-needles, freezers and other imaginative tools. At least Se7en had a legitimate point to make with some interesting philosophical debates raised. These films try to raise the same sort of issues and fails on all accounts to where it's just plain ludicrous.What really amazed me about the first film is why such a fine actor like Danny Glover would even waste his time and talent with this garbage in the first place! I only give these films 2 stars because I have to admit the gadgetry is rather imaginative.I just hope that Saw doesn't end up to be another Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street series of countless sequels that get more and more insulting to the intelligence. But somehow I think it will! I could give a more detailed review going over each film and their countless absurdities, but they're simply not worth my time and key strokes. If you're wondering why I bother to watch these films, it's very simple, these films pretty much qualify as ""so bad, they're good"" films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Showgirls, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and so forth. So at least there's some entertainment here and that's not a compliment!

His motives are to make people play deadly torturous games in order to survive or die. However Dr. Gordon's family is in great peril as he must be done as he's told. Next ""Saw 2"" continues off the first movie as Jigsaw returns for he gets unmasked, this time he traps a helpless group of people such as Amanda (Shawnee Smith) with others (Glen Plummer, Franky G., Emmanuell Vaugier and Tony Nappo) in a booby-trap filled house as they have many hours before the poison in their blood devours them as they must find the antitode and Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) has discovered that his son is part of his sick game and wants to help him. Finally ""Saw III"" takes place a month after part 2, Amanda becomes Jigsaw's helper for around round of gruesome torture to unfortunate people as they kidnap a female doctor named Lynn (Bahar Soomok) so they can help him with his cancerous problems, a new victim named Jeff (Angus MacFayden) must go through a maze of important tasks including trying to find who murdered his child and put a stop to Jigsaw.All three amazing movies from writers-directors James Wan and Darren Lynn-Bousmann started a unique trilogy of movies. Starting from the excellent first movie, it was originally gonna be a direct-to-video movie that later became a theatrical flick after positive response from film festivals to be in theaters thus Lionsgate picked it up then it became a well received box-office smash. A thrilling ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en""-esque thriller that goes to the jugulear veins and never lets go, Danny Glover gives a great performance in the first movie and the film has an amazing ending. The second movie is a brilliant and better acted movie then the first movie as it gives some memorable traps like the infamous needle-pit sequence which is guaranteed to make anyone cringe and finally the third movie is very weak but still a nice end to a trilogy unlike the other sequels of the series as they went downhill from their. All movies are quite gory and realistic with ideas, brains and chilling atmosphere with a great sense of fun for any horror fan.All three movies in this package are the unrated director's cuts with footage not shown in the R-rated versions as they have great extras like two short movies including the one that spawned the 2004 movie, commentaries, trailer on part 2, behind the scenes footage, featurettes, a fun game on part 2, trivia, Art gallery on part 1 and Documentaries.",5,Awesome horror trilogy!,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,2682,"['Saw', '1', 'two', 'men', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gordon', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Adam', 'Leigh', 'Whannel', 'wake', 'up', 'filfty', 'uncleaned', 'bathroom', 'chained', 'feet', 'mysterious', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'named', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'trapped', 'motives', 'are', 'make', 'people', 'play', 'deadly', 'torturous', 'games', 'order', 'survive', 'die', 'However', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'family', 'great', 'peril', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'told', 'Next', 'Saw', '2', 'first', 'movie', 'Jigsaw', 'returns', 'unmasked', 'time', 'helpless', 'group', 'people', 'such', 'Amanda', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'others', 'Glen', 'Plummer', 'Franky', 'G.', 'Emmanuell', 'Vaugier', 'Tony', 'Nappo', 'booby-trap', 'filled', 'house', 'have', 'many', 'hours', 'poison', 'blood', 'devours', 'must', 'find', 'antitode', 'Detective', 'Matthews', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'discovered', 'son', 'part', 'sick', 'game', 'help', 'Finally', 'Saw', 'III', 'place', 'month', 'part', '2', 'Amanda', 'Jigsaw', 'helper', 'round', 'gruesome', 'torture', 'unfortunate', 'people', 'kidnap', 'female', 'doctor', 'named', 'Lynn', 'Bahar', 'Soomok', 'can', 'help', 'cancerous', 'problems', 'new', 'victim', 'named', 'Jeff', 'Angus', 'MacFayden', 'must', 'go', 'maze', 'important', 'tasks', 'including', 'trying', 'find', 'who', 'murdered', 'child', 'put', 'stop', 'Jigsaw.All', 'three', 'amazing', 'movies', 'writers-directors', 'James', 'Wan', 'Darren', 'Lynn-Bousmann', 'started', 'unique', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'Starting', 'excellent', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'gon', 'be', 'direct-to-video', 'movie', 'later', 'became', 'theatrical', 'flick', 'positive', 'response', 'film', 'festivals', 'be', 'theaters', 'thus', 'Lionsgate', 'picked', 'up', 'then', 'became', 'well', 'received', 'box-office', 'smash', 'thrilling', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Se7en', '-esque', 'thriller', 'jugulear', 'veins', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'great', 'performance', 'first', 'movie', 'film', 'amazing', 'ending', 'second', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'better', 'acted', 'movie', 'then', 'first', 'movie', 'memorable', 'traps', 'infamous', 'needle-pit', 'sequence', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'anyone', 'cringe', 'finally', 'third', 'movie', 'very', 'weak', 'still', 'nice', 'end', 'trilogy', 'other', 'sequels', 'series', 'went', 'downhill', 'movies', 'are', 'quite', 'gory', 'realistic', 'ideas', 'brains', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'sense', 'fun', 'horror', 'fan.All', 'three', 'movies', 'package', 'are', 'unrated', 'director', 'cuts', 'footage', 'not', 'shown', 'R-rated', 'versions', 'have', 'great', 'extras', 'two', 'short', 'movies', 'including', 'one', 'spawned', '2004', 'movie', 'commentaries', 'trailer', 'part', '2', 'scenes', 'footage', 'fun', 'game', 'part', '2', 'trivia', 'Art', 'gallery', 'part', '1', 'Documentaries']",The Saw Trilogy: (Saw/ Saw II/ Saw III)

Before there was Hoffman, Strahm, Jill, and Erickson, it was just Jigsaw testing Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon in an old dirty and filthy bathroom with a dead body in the middle. They hear a tape by Jigsaw that tells Dr. Gordon to kill Adam by 6:00 a.m., or his wife and daughter will die. Zep has his family hostage and Detecive David Tapp still thinks that Dr. Gordon is linked to the Jigsaw murders. Throughout the time in the room, we see flashbacks of Jigsaw's other games, and why Adam and Gordon are in the room. If you love horror, and twists, you'll love SAW!!!Saw II- This was a really awesome sequel, and just as thrilling as the original! I like the S.W.A.T team scenes and the traps and twists! After bailing his son out of jail, Detective Eric Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is hiding, but for Jigsaw, getting caught is all part of the game. Eight people are trapped in a house. Included in the game are Amanda from the original, Eric's son; Daniel, Xavier, Obi, Gus, Laura, Addison, and Jonas. They all must find an antidote for the poison gas they are breathing. Later, Xavier chases Amanda and Daniel to the classic Saw bathroom. Eric is finally enraged by Jigsaw that he beats him up until he tells him where the house is. If you love horror, Saw, and twists, you'll love SAW II!!!Saw III- To me, Saw III is more epic because it's longer and has more soap opera elements to Amanda and Jigsaw's character. Tobin Bell does another awesome job as Jigsaw, who is now on his death bed. Jigsaw has Lynn kidnapped and brought to him so he can stay alive long enough to see if Jeff makes it through his test. Jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named Timothy Young. Jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child. My favorite trap in this one is the Pig Vat when Jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines. I love when Lynn has to perform surgery on Jigsaw and removing some of his skull to relax his brain. Will Jeff learn to forgive? Will Jigsaw live? Let's play a game and find out!

Then Jigsaw traps a few unlucky people in a shelter, who must try to get out before they breathe too much lethal nerve gas and die! THen, they find a recording by Jigsaw, telling them that they have to find an antidote to get out.I loved this film. sick, twisted, every bit as good as the first, it's all so good. SO any gorehound (not necissarily) must see this film.And BTW, It's already Number one at the box office. LEt's see if it can keep up!SAW 3- Reviewed on October 28th, 2006I recently just saw this today. Luckily I got good seats (not many people were in the theater) and the film was just at the studio logos. This movie rocked! It was definitely the best out of all three SAW films.INTRODUCTION: SAW I and II came out in 2004 and 2005. The films both rocked, plus the endings were real cliffhangers!STORY: The film begins with Eric Matthews waking up in the bathroom. He breaks his own foot to escape, and Kerry and the others are investigating Troy. After the death of Kerry, Jigsaw is on his last legs. He is in his final hours of life with Cancer, and Amanda kidnaps a doctor named Lynn, and Lynn is to keep Jiggy alive while he is to see if his new test works out. The ""test"" revolves around Jeff, a man who is avenging his son. The people in the traps are people related to the death of Jeff's son.THOUGHTS: 2nd best film of the year! Hopefully this will top the box office. The best trap is the ""pig carcass"" trap. Plus, the ending has a HUGE twist.So go see this if you liked the other 2 SAWs!EDIT: 10/30/06Let's not forget that S3 is number 1 at the box office and has grossed $34. 3 Million. Let's see if S3 can keep up!So anyways, those are my reviews of the SAW movies. I can't wait for Saw IV! Go buy this if you love the trilogy.",5,The story thus so far is one of the best borror trilogies yet!,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2687,"['SAW-INTRODUCTION', 'Back', '2004', 'Filmmakers', 'James', 'Wan', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'had', 'unleashed', 'SAW', 'world', 'took', 'horror', 'next', 'level', 'had', 'gotten', 'NC-17', 'upon', 'classification', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'get', 'R', 'STORY', 'Two', 'men', 'wake', 'up', 'disgusting', 'bathroom', 'dead', 'body', 'middle', 'floor', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'legs', 'are', 'chained', 'pipe', 'are', 'being', 'tested', 'Jigsaw', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'undeserving', 'life', 'teach', 'deadly', 'traps', 'THOUGHTS', 'What', 'movie', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'film', 'made', 'horror', 'better', 'reverse', 'bear', 'trap', 'great', 'scary', 'scene', 'SAW', '2-', 'Reviewed', 'November', '3rd', '2005I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'first', 'one', 'grossed', 'parents', 'out', 'Then', 'rented', 'many', 'times', 'finally', 'prepared', 'Saw', 'II', 'saw', 'friday', 'loved', 'here', 'review.The', 'movie', 'detective', 'who', 'solving', 'murder', 'commited', 'Jigsaw', 'Then', 'Jigsaw', 'few', 'unlucky', 'people', 'shelter', 'who', 'must', 'try', 'get', 'out', 'breathe', 'too', 'much', 'lethal', 'nerve', 'gas', 'die', 'THen', 'find', 'recording', 'Jigsaw', 'telling', 'have', 'find', 'antidote', 'get', 'out.I', 'loved', 'film', 'sick', 'twisted', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'so', 'good', 'gorehound', 'not', 'necissarily', 'must', 'see', 'film.And', 'BTW', 'already', 'Number', 'one', 'box', 'office', 'LEt', 'see', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'SAW', '3-', 'Reviewed', 'October', '28th', '2006I', 'recently', 'just', 'saw', 'today', 'Luckily', 'got', 'good', 'seats', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'theater', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'studio', 'logos', 'movie', 'rocked', 'was', 'definitely', 'best', 'three', 'SAW', 'films.INTRODUCTION', 'SAW', 'II', 'came', 'out', '2004', '2005', 'films', 'rocked', 'endings', 'were', 'real', 'cliffhangers', 'STORY', 'film', 'Eric', 'Matthews', 'waking', 'up', 'bathroom', 'own', 'foot', 'escape', 'Kerry', 'others', 'are', 'investigating', 'Troy', 'death', 'Kerry', 'Jigsaw', 'last', 'legs', 'final', 'hours', 'life', 'Cancer', 'Amanda', 'doctor', 'named', 'Lynn', 'Lynn', 'keep', 'Jiggy', 'alive', 'see', 'new', 'test', 'out', 'test', 'around', 'Jeff', 'man', 'who', 'avenging', 'son', 'people', 'traps', 'are', 'people', 'related', 'death', 'Jeff', 'son.THOUGHTS', '2nd', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'best', 'trap', 'pig', 'carcass', 'trap', 'ending', 'HUGE', 'twist.So', 'go', 'see', 'liked', 'other', '2', 'SAWs', 'EDIT', '10/30/06Let', 'not', 'forget', 'S3', 'number', '1', 'box', 'office', 'grossed', '34', '3', 'Million', 'Let', 'see', 'S3', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'So', 'anyways', 'are', 'reviews', 'SAW', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Saw', 'IV', 'Go', 'buy', 'love', 'trilogy']",The Saw Trilogy: (Saw/ Saw II/ Saw III)

It was a refreshingly new take on terror and torture, if you are into that sort of thing. That is not to say that this is a sadistic sort of film. It is and it isn't The torture devices that the poor victims suffer through are pretty horrible, and you wouldn't wish it on anyone, and yet, you can't really turn away from the screen. That is what made the first Saw so captivating. Aside from the appalling acting from Carey Elwes, everything else is solid. Oh yes. And the ending of course was jaw dropping. I really didn't see it coming.Saw 2 was decent enough. The torture devices were more obsene, the acting was ok for the most part. It even had the same type of claustrophobic environment. But it wasn't as exciting as the first film. It was missing something. I sort of cared for the characters in Saw 1. But I really couldn't find myself to care about any of the characters in this one. But, it still had a pretty neat ending.Saw 3 was actually better than Saw 2. Still not as good as the first. You would think that every trick and torture device was already exhausted by the 2nd film. Well, we find out that that is not really true. Yes, there are even more devious and ridiculous methods to gruesomely kill a human being. The chest ripping thing was a particular ahem, favorite of mine. The acting overall was better than in Saw 2. And the plot for the most part was coherent, while at the same time, bordering ridiculous. But it was still fun. It seemed like a more tense environment, like in the first Saw. And yes, I also liked the ending in this one.Sooo overall, you must be entirely non-squimish about watching films like this. Really.
