607812,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLX2,A Customer,"[8, 14]","Summary:James Clayton (Colin Farrell (I)) is a brilliant computer programmer who has just developed a groundbreaking new program and is being recruited by big name comptuer companies.  When he is approached by a CIA recruiter, Walter Burke (Al Pacino), who drops several hints about his father's actual job as a member of the CIA, James decides to give it a try.  James passes the entrance exams and interviews and ends up training as a CIA agent on 'The Farm', a clandestine location for training spies.  While there he meets Layla (Bridget Moynahan) with whom he falls in love.Eventually James because the ultimate CIA agent, a NOC, whose existence is completely denied by the U.S. government.  His first mission, given to him by Burke, is to find out who Layla is working for.  Burke convinces James that Layla is a double agent and that she is trying to steal a computer virus developed by the CIA.  However, there is more to what is going on and, as Burke says at the Farm, ""nothing is as it seems.""My Comments:There were two major problems with this movie.  First, it's too short to develop the real plot lines that it needed to develop to be a convincing story.  From when James is put on his first case to when he cracks it takes all of about a week.  There is no plot development, no relationship negotiation, nothing.  It's just James having sex with Layla and voila, he cracks the case.  If the writers of the movie really wanted to spend that much time on the training, which was kind of interesting, then they at least had to compensate for it by increasing the length of the movie so the real story could be at least an hour long, but instead it only takes up maybe the last 40 minutes or so.  The allotment of time to the different story elements (introduction, main plot, etc.) was way off.The second major problem is that there are all sorts of holes in the story.  The end of the movie is fast enough that you are drawn into it without thinking through all of the problems.  However, when you sit down and think about the movie afterwards you realize that there are problems.  I'll just give a few I thought of: 1. Why is Layla working with Zack (Gabriel Macht) and giving him notes?  2. Why does Zack run from James, he doesn't really have anything to hide?  3. Why is Burke the only contact James has with the CIA?  4. Why isn't James carrying a gun from the beginning and only gets one from Burke?  5. Why does Burke, a trained spy, spill the beans at the end, even though he can easily see that all of the laser sights are on James and not on him (the reason given isn't convincing)?Anyway, I'm sure you could spend hours listing all of the problems with the story.  But, the movie isn't all that bad.  If you can look past the time allotment and plot holes, the movie is kind of fun to watch, mainly because you get to see kind of what CIA trainees go through.  The special features on the DVD include some additional information from a member of the CIA who helped with the film that claims that the training from the movie is similar to the training that takes place in real life.Overall, the movie is interesting as a look inside the CIA, but is far too short to really develop a good plot.  I think my wife might disagree because she was sucked into the story and was trying to figure out what was going on even though she guessed that Burke was not who he said he was from the beginning.  If you like espionage type movies, you'd probably enjoy this one.  It isn't perfect or anywhere near it, but it's fun and entertaining.",3,Works well until you really think about it,1054339200,"05 31, 2003",2003,3552,"['Summary', 'James', 'Clayton', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'brilliant', 'computer', 'programmer', 'who', 'just', 'developed', 'groundbreaking', 'new', 'program', 'being', 'recruited', 'big', 'name', 'comptuer', 'companies', 'When', 'approached', 'CIA', 'recruiter', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'several', 'hints', 'father', 'actual', 'job', 'member', 'CIA', 'James', 'give', 'try', 'James', 'entrance', 'exams', 'interviews', 'up', 'training', 'CIA', 'agent', ""'The"", 'Farm', 'clandestine', 'location', 'training', 'spies', 'Layla', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'whom', 'love.Eventually', 'James', 'ultimate', 'CIA', 'agent', 'NOC', 'existence', 'completely', 'denied', 'U.S.', 'government', 'first', 'mission', 'given', 'Burke', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Layla', 'working', 'Burke', 'James', 'Layla', 'double', 'agent', 'trying', 'steal', 'computer', 'virus', 'developed', 'CIA', 'However', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'Burke', 'Farm', 'nothing', 'Comments', 'were', 'two', 'major', 'problems', 'movie', 'First', 'too', 'short', 'develop', 'real', 'plot', 'lines', 'needed', 'develop', 'be', 'convincing', 'story', 'when', 'James', 'put', 'first', 'case', 'when', 'week', 'plot', 'development', 'relationship', 'negotiation', 'nothing', 'just', 'James', 'having', 'sex', 'Layla', 'voila', 'case', 'writers', 'movie', 'really', 'wanted', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'training', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', 'then', 'least', 'had', 'compensate', 'increasing', 'length', 'movie', 'real', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'least', 'hour', 'long', 'instead', 'only', 'up', 'maybe', 'last', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'allotment', 'time', 'different', 'story', 'elements', 'introduction', 'main', 'plot', 'etc', 'was', 'way', 'second', 'major', 'problem', 'are', 'sorts', 'holes', 'story', 'end', 'movie', 'fast', 'enough', 'are', 'drawn', 'thinking', 'problems', 'However', 'when', 'sit', 'down', 'think', 'movie', 'afterwards', 'realize', 'are', 'problems', ""'ll"", 'just', 'give', 'few', 'thought', '1', 'Why', 'Layla', 'working', 'Zack', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'giving', 'notes', '2', 'Why', 'Zack', 'run', 'James', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'hide', '3', 'Why', 'Burke', 'only', 'contact', 'James', 'CIA', '4', 'Why', ""n't"", 'James', 'carrying', 'gun', 'beginning', 'only', 'one', 'Burke', '5', 'Why', 'Burke', 'trained', 'spy', 'spill', 'beans', 'end', 'even', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'laser', 'sights', 'are', 'James', 'not', 'reason', 'given', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'spend', 'hours', 'listing', 'problems', 'story', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'can', 'look', 'time', 'allotment', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'kind', 'fun', 'watch', 'mainly', 'get', 'see', 'kind', 'what', 'CIA', 'trainees', 'go', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'additional', 'information', 'member', 'CIA', 'who', 'helped', 'film', 'training', 'movie', 'similar', 'training', 'place', 'real', 'life.Overall', 'movie', 'interesting', 'look', 'CIA', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'really', 'develop', 'good', 'plot', 'think', 'wife', 'might', 'disagree', 'was', 'sucked', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'even', 'guessed', 'Burke', 'was', 'not', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'beginning', 'like', 'espionage', 'type', 'movies', ""'d"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'anywhere', 'fun', 'entertaining']",The Recruit

This time he's out of the phone booth and using his cell phone, whizzing through movie-style computer gibberish as James Clayton, the star recruit of the latest batch of CIA trainees.Bridget Moynahan gives much the same performance as she does in ""I, Robot"", playing it smart and sassy with a real cute pout, and a concerned wrinkle.Surprises and twists abound, and though you know it's all faked, and nothing is what it seems, it still draws you in.  In retrospect, the ending really is the silliest part of the movie, the moral of the story being to sit down and relax whenever you see red dots before your eyes.Amanda Richards, January 9, 2005",4,Sometimes things are better than they seem,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1354,"['movie', 'initially', 'passed', 'always', 'finding', 'something', 'else', 'buy', 'borrow', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'happened', 'catch', 'ending', 'television', 'late', 'one', 'next', 'evening', 'was', 'possession', 'having', 'already', 'watched', 'ending', 'found', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'experience.Al', 'Pacino', 'aced', 'role', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'CIA', 'trainer', 'extraordinaire', 'not', 'guy', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'play', 'poker', 'even', 'did', 'play', 'poker.Colin', 'Farrell', 'performance', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'movies', 'maybe', 'Alexander', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'hate', 'blonde', 'look', 'really', 'great', 'short', 'dark', 'handsome', 'tortured', 'persecuted', 'thing', 'time', 'phone', 'booth', 'using', 'cell', 'phone', 'whizzing', 'movie-style', 'computer', 'gibberish', 'James', 'Clayton', 'star', 'recruit', 'latest', 'batch', 'CIA', 'trainees.Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'much', 'same', 'performance', 'Robot', 'playing', 'smart', 'sassy', 'real', 'cute', 'pout', 'concerned', 'wrinkle.Surprises', 'twists', 'abound', 'know', 'faked', 'nothing', 'what', 'still', 'retrospect', 'ending', 'really', 'silliest', 'part', 'movie', 'moral', 'story', 'being', 'sit', 'down', 'relax', 'whenever', 'see', 'red', 'dots', 'eyes.Amanda', 'Richards', 'January', '9', '2005']",The Recruit

The young Farell rapidly becomes embroiled in a &quot;mole&quot; hunt and is constantly questioning whether he is still &quot;in training&quot;, or really in danger. What develops is a series of &quot;who's watching who&quot; encounters as he, and his trainee counterpart take part in a cat and mouse scenario, that leaves the viewing audience also playing along. Puritans will probably complain that there is a lack of accuracy in the movie, and that the final revelations seem predictable, but most people will just sit and enjoy the ride.

607818,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLX2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","2003 was a huge year for Colin Farrell.  He was in nearly everything.  Sadly, he was in a lot of the same kind of stuff and pretty much pigeonholed his career for a while, unlike Jude Law who took 2004 by storm with a slew of various projects.  Still, I've always been a fan of Farrell and I have a very soft spot for his work in `The Recruit', since I kind of love this movie to pieces.For genre fluff that is pretty predictable and generic in parts, it stretches itself and has a lot of fun and proves to be great entertainment from start to finish.`The Recruit' follows a young CIA hopeful named James Clayton who suffers recruitment camp only to find out he's been let go due to his breakdown during a test.  Thinking he's lost all he tried to achieve, he is dumbfounded when he is contacted by his instructor, Walter Burke, with a top secret assignment.  He's even more confused when it turns out the he is targeting a young woman who trained with Clayton, Layla Moore.  Clayton starts to second guess his assignment and his discoveries as he delves deeper into his role in this strategically paced cat and mouse game.Farrell is spot on and really works magic in the role, and Bridget Moynahan is beautiful to look at and compelling to watch.  Al Pacino gives an admirable performance, considering his track record as of late.  He doesn't do anything offensive here, even if he does coast a bit.  While Farrell's other films suffered from an almost placid approach (`S.W.A.T.' was an overlong bore and `Phone Booth' doesn't deliver thrills upon recent viewings), `The Recruit' is truly entertaining, even on a third, fifth or tenth viewing (this is one of those films I could watch anytime, anyplace).

607820,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JLX2,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[1, 2]","For anyone who has ever had any contact with the real world, many of the premises of this unlikely thriller are so far fetched that they create an air of unreality early on. But if you are enough of a Pacino fan, as I am, you let it go and suspend your critical faculties and just go along for the wild ride you have just buckled in for.  The initial thirty minutes of this two-hour travelogue into the heart of the CIA spy world is interesting and appealing, as is the fast paced and thrilling last thirty minutes. The middle hour tends to slow way down, with more than a little gratuitous sex (to prove the two lead actors of Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan are `hot'?) and a great deal of extraneous dialogue between them and between Farrell as the `recruit' of the title and a wonderfully droll Pacino as his `mentor' (read ""handler"" here). The central lesson in this diverting and often surprising potboiler is that ""nothing is as it seems"", a it is as so depressing and cynical at points to make you want to put the DVD on ""pause"" and go have yourself a decent leisurely cry.But the action resumes with a vengeance, just as one is beginning to despair that this may actually be a message movie in drag. The plot is plausible, though it is sometimes adrift in the trees a bit. Farrell, a recent MIT computer whiz, is seduced into dissing a career shot with Dell Computers to chase the chimera of his father's murky past as an agent with the CIA. Apparently the ""Agency"" believes in legacy appointments now,  so Farrell is whisked away to ""The Farm"", a reference to an idea quite blatantly stolen from the John LeCarre novels like ""Smiley's People"" about the British Intelligence Services' training ground for agent initiates. Here he keeps relearning to depend on no one but himself and his native intellect and intuition, for outside these narrowly confined perimeters, nothing is in fact what it seems to be. Nothing.The acting is good, and the cast seems believable given the twisting and turning plot and the mysterious devices that employed to keep us guessing as to what is happening. What is Pacino really up to? When does the training and tests ever end? As we speed toward the conclusion, we begin to understand the level of resident suspicion an agent must develop and maintain to survive in the fractiously perilous world of the secret world of clandestine operations. Do not rent this movie expecting it to be a realistic reflection of life as an agent for any of the so-called intelligence services.

The film spends a little time at The Farm (the not-particularly-secret CIA training facility -- the counterpart to the FBI's training facility in Quantico) before moving to Washington, DC and an intrigue concerning one or more moles within the CIA and a not-as-complex-as-it-looks whodunnit mystery.While there are a few wrinkles in this mystery -- who's the guy in the hooded jacket, for instance -- mostly the enjoyment of this film comes down to how they hit the fairly standard plot points, not which plot points they choose to hit.

It examines the agencies recruiting techniques and the intense and unique training the new recruit must go through in order to become a full operative. Colin Farrell plays the new recruit acquired by the agencies veteran recruiter and instructor, played by Al Pacino.The film communicates well the reality that, out of all the law enforcement organizations, the CIA is the most thankless of the lot. We only hear about them when they fail, never when they succeed. The heroes who have died in the line of duty in the field are never named, but are coldly referred to by only a star and the year they perished. But why would anyone want to be a CIA operative? It's not about money because they're under paid. It's not about fame because, for the most part, throughout their careers, they remain anonymous. These spies work gruelling hours and are constantly on the move, packing and unpacking, and sometimes go for months, even years away from their families. The film addresses this question in an interesting and entertaining way.The underlying theme of the film is the notion that nothing is as it seems. The only thing you can believe is that you cannot believe anything. Trust no one because everyone has an agenda. Building relationships is not done for the obvious reasons but to use as a means to an end. The mission is everything and exploitation is the means to the goal. You have to be a certain type of person to do this kind of thing. I've always wondered how undercover agents can live with themselves and how terribly lonely this profession would be. This film expresses all these things compellingly.~The Recruit~ is also a great story with many twists and turns. Nothing is what it seems until the end.

Roger Donaldson has gone and made one of those twisty-turny films that David Mamet (The Spanish Prisoner, House of Games) is so well-known for, except Donaldson has set his in a world of action, giving us the best of both worlds--a workout of brain and nerves.The Recruit stars Al Pacino and Colin Farrell as a CIA agent and his recruit, respectively. Pacino gives one of his more subtle recent performances, but Farrell carries the show. His James Clayton is a distraught, ambitious rebel who doesn't belong in the CIA, and is therefore so perfect for the job.The games begin early on as we find out quickly that ""nothing is as it seems."" During CIA training, everything is a test, which we find out in myriad ways. These could have easily turned obvious, and had I attempted to pick them out (a few, I did), I believe I could have easily done so. But, although I am a reviewer, I am a fan first and, having come to be entertained, I let The Recruit sweep me away with its labyrinthine plot, engrossed by Clayton's plights and his ability to be fooled. Not an idiot by any means, Farrell shows Clayton's realistic gullibility, especially when confronted by love in the form of Layla (Bridgette Moynahan), who may or may not be a double agent.Donaldson keeps the pacing and the guessing at top speed as events constantly become more and more complex, raising questions as to who can be trusted, what is real, and what is still simply a test.

Farrell plays James Clayton, a brilliant computer programmer who moonlights as a bartender who is recuited by CIA headhunter Walter Burke (played with flair by Pacino). After passing the entrance test Clayton (along with fellow recruit Layla Moore played by Moynahan) is sent the CIA traing facility nicknamed ""The Farm."" What follows is a thrilling action adventure with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer enthralled.The 2003 movie may not have appeared an obvious choice to be one of the earlier Blu-ray catalog titles (released June 3, 2008) due to its rather bleak look, but I am certainly glad it was picked because its 1080p transfer is really quite good. Though not reference quality it is quite pleasing with enough of those high definition details (such as Farrell's trademark stubble), clarity and color reproduction to please PQ enthusiasts.The audio is somewhat average by comparison with good balance and a pleasing surround effect, and the Blu-ray of ""The Recruit"" is undoubtedly the best soundtrack you are ever likely to hear for the movie.The special features are a little on the sparse side (which is not really surprising considering its catalog status) but we do get a feature commentary track with director Roger Donaldson and actor Colin Farrell (who sports his actual Irish accent). It's the kind of track I personally enjoy with plenty of anecdotal stories from the set and Donaldson offering uo some technical information on the production.All of the video special features are in standard 480p quality and include four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Donaldson and Farrell, a too-short ""Spy School: Inside the CIA Training Program"" which runs at 15:58 and (as the title suggests) takes a look at the actual training school for the CIA (including an instance where the movie is not accurate) with on-camera interviews with 25-year veteran of the CIA Chase Brandon and the cast and crew. Also included is a rather pointless Movie Showcase that displays some select scenes to showcase the benefits of HD picture and sound (which if you have the Blu-ray you are already sold on anyway.This is an entertaining movie and although the Blu-ray features a rather average HD picture and sound it is still the best representation of the movie you are likely to see.",5,Entertaining movie is even better on Blu-ray,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,2807,"['always', 'interesting', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'back-yard', 'even', 'Washington', 'Navy', 'Yard', 'where', 'work', 'nothing', 'depicted', 'movie', 'am', 'guessing', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'not', 'gain', 'access', 'secured', 'home', 'NCIS', 'movie', 'still', 'enough', 'local', 'color', 'keep', 'Washingtonians', 'interested.But', 'aside', 'movie', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Farrell', 'James', 'Clayton', 'brilliant', 'computer', 'programmer', 'who', 'bartender', 'who', 'recuited', 'CIA', 'headhunter', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'played', 'flair', 'Pacino', 'passing', 'entrance', 'test', 'Clayton', 'fellow', 'recruit', 'Layla', 'Moore', 'played', 'Moynahan', 'sent', 'CIA', 'traing', 'facility', 'nicknamed', 'Farm', 'What', 'thrilling', 'action', 'adventure', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'viewer', 'enthralled.The', '2003', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'appeared', 'obvious', 'choice', 'be', 'one', 'earlier', 'Blu-ray', 'catalog', 'titles', 'released', 'June', '3', '2008', 'due', 'rather', 'bleak', 'look', 'am', 'certainly', 'glad', 'was', 'picked', '1080p', 'transfer', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'reference', 'quality', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'enough', 'high', 'definition', 'details', 'such', 'Farrell', 'trademark', 'stubble', 'clarity', 'color', 'reproduction', 'please', 'PQ', 'enthusiasts.The', 'audio', 'somewhat', 'average', 'comparison', 'good', 'balance', 'pleasing', 'surround', 'effect', 'Blu-ray', 'Recruit', 'undoubtedly', 'best', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'ever', 'likely', 'hear', 'movie.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'little', 'sparse', 'side', 'not', 'really', 'surprising', 'considering', 'catalog', 'status', 'do', 'get', 'feature', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'actor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'sports', 'actual', 'Irish', 'accent', 'kind', 'track', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'plenty', 'anecdotal', 'stories', 'set', 'Donaldson', 'offering', 'uo', 'technical', 'information', 'production.All', 'video', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'standard', '480p', 'quality', 'include', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Donaldson', 'Farrell', 'too-short', 'Spy', 'School', 'CIA', 'Training', 'Program', '15:58', 'title', 'look', 'actual', 'training', 'school', 'CIA', 'including', 'instance', 'where', 'movie', 'not', 'accurate', 'on-camera', 'interviews', '25-year', 'veteran', 'CIA', 'Chase', 'Brandon', 'cast', 'crew', 'Also', 'included', 'rather', 'pointless', 'Movie', 'Showcase', 'select', 'scenes', 'showcase', 'benefits', 'HD', 'picture', 'sound', 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'already', 'sold', 'anyway.This', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Blu-ray', 'rather', 'average', 'HD', 'picture', 'sound', 'still', 'best', 'representation', 'movie', 'are', 'likely', 'see']",The Recruit

His craggy, wrinkled face show it ALL. A veteran of many covert and clandestine missions internationally, he recruits the hero by mainly playing on his unconfirmed belief that his father was a CIA Intelligence Officer who was KIA in Peru. Filmed on location in Canada where the woods are used to represent The Farm, which is the CIA's training facility in Virginia. Its correct name is Camp P____. Here, the recruit of the movie title learns tradecraft which in spy talk is how you do what spies do. He learns ELINT or electronic intelligence like bugging and so on. The recruit learns too the black arts of killing with bare hands or machine guns. He meets the love interest in the movie who is a fellow recruit. Later, he even bugs her while pretending to be deeply in love with her. The classic scene in the car park is where she says, ""..we have 18 seconds before the CCTV surveillenace cameras pick us up."" This leads to a super passionate rip your lips off kissing scene which is really well done. The Polygraph scenes are good too. The Polygraph is a a lie detector which Company employees have to undergo periodically. It is not foolproof as traitors uncovered can testify to. The resistance to hostile interrogation scenes are a bit overdone but what the hell, that's Hollywood. A dark, film noir type location is the Washington Navy Yard where everything comes to a head. The climatic scene is a ritual suicide where the bad guy who obviously chooses death before the State Penitentiary (I won't tell you who as it will spoil the suprise) gets cut to pieces with 9mm rounds from Heckler & Koch MP5A2 SMGs fitted with laser sights. In real life, you simply have to shoot to kill because a wounded target is even more dangerous. Moreover, people riddled with bullets have been known to shoot back and kill their opponent, so the 1 shot kill in real life is pretty much a myth (except for pro snipers). Some scenes were really filmed in the old building of The Company headquarters. A fascinating movie, with many thrills, spills, kills, suspense, a beautiful heroine in danger, and much else, what more could you ask for? A nice insight into the world of espionage where people lie routinely, and where nothing is quite what it seems. A world where the love of money often out-motivates the love of country. This is perhaps the reason why Spying is the world's second oldest profession.

Unfortunately, that is not always true.  If this film seems to drag a bit at times, that is what it seems.  If it seems a bit repetitive and lacking in originality in dialogue and plot situations, that is what it seems.  If it seems that the star power of Al Pacino and Colin Farrell aren't enough to raise this film from B-film levels, that is what it seems.Farrell is supposed to be a techno-geek.  Okay, most techno-geeks I know do not look like Colin Farrell even on Farrell's worst day.  So, suspension of disbelief is required from the outset (one can make the same criticism of Keanu Reeves in the Matrix films, but those were much better films).  Farrell as James Clayton is a programmer geek by day, sexy bartender by night (that part is convincing).  Clayton is the sort of person that Walter Burke (played by Pacino) seems to want in the CIA, so he sets out to recruit him.  Clayton has a secret buried in his past - his father disappeared, and he always suspected that it was a CIA or some similar agency operation that caused it.Forward to 'the farm', a training ground for CIA operatives.  Most people wash out, and Clayton (apparently) does, too.  However, he is then recruited again by Burke to be a super-sleuth - the kind of operative that works off the books and under the radar.  The mission is to secure a computer programme capable of taking over virtually the entire plugged-in world, which exists in the computers of the agency, but nowhere else.  Of course, the computers at the agency don't have disc drives or printers or any other such storage devices to make theft easy.This is the first point at which the story goes off the rails, because the theft mechanism appallingly simple, and we find during at least one scene that the agency's computers are internet-linked to an agent's home computer.  So much for not being able to get information off the reservation.  But I digress.Farrell's confused acting put together with Pacino's overacting lead to a less-than satisfying, anticlimactic denouement.  There are plots within plots, and, true to form, the storyline tries to craft each person as being not what he or she seems, except that the viewer can figure out fairly quickly who is and is not in the frame.The deleted scenes don't add much to the overall experience of this film, and the final scene, alas, is definitely a set-up for a sequel, should we ever be so unlucky as to find this being made.If it seems that there was potential for this film, between the actors and the idea, that is what it seems.

607867,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLX2,Joe Sherry,"[10, 12]","A Film by Roger DonaldsonThe Recruit is a film about the CIA and a training facility called ""The Farm"". Walter Burke (Al Pacino) is a teacher at The Farm and is trying to recruit James Clayton (Colin Farrell) to join the CIA. Clayton is intrigued both by how Burke sells the CIA and also because Burke claims some knowledge about Clayton's father (who disappeared/was killed in 1990). Clayton goes along for the ride and the first half of the movie is the training at the Farm.The first half of the movie (barring the first 5-10 minutes) is by far the best of the movie. If the quality would have held up, this could have been a great movie. During the training we meet Layla (Bridget Moynahan), who may or may not be a spy. Burke tells Clayton early in the movie that nothing is as it seems. If we keep that in mind we have to accept that anything we are presented is a lie. This makes the first half of the movie very interesting but also makes the second half of the movie fairly conventional. Nothing is really wrong with it, but nothing is really right with the second hour. There are a couple of twists that aren't really unexpected, but nothing too spectacular.Here's the bottom line: I enjoyed watching the movie, but it was ultimately empty and forgettable. Al Pacino gets to give a nice speech (a wonderful, but typical Pacino explosion), and everyone does a good job, but the movie is just lacking...I think it is lacking any kind of real story. If you want to see a better movie in this genre, see Spy Game. It's a much better movie.",3,it's no spy game,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1545,"['Film', 'Roger', 'DonaldsonThe', 'Recruit', 'film', 'CIA', 'training', 'facility', 'called', 'Farm', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'teacher', 'Farm', 'trying', 'recruit', 'James', 'Clayton', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'join', 'CIA', 'Clayton', 'intrigued', 'how', 'Burke', 'CIA', 'also', 'Burke', 'knowledge', 'Clayton', 'father', 'who', 'disappeared/was', 'killed', '1990', 'Clayton', 'along', 'ride', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'training', 'Farm.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'barring', 'first', '5-10', 'minutes', 'far', 'best', 'movie', 'quality', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'training', 'meet', 'Layla', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'spy', 'Burke', 'Clayton', 'early', 'movie', 'nothing', 'keep', 'mind', 'have', 'accept', 'anything', 'are', 'presented', 'lie', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'also', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'Nothing', 'really', 'wrong', 'nothing', 'really', 'right', 'second', 'hour', 'are', 'couple', 'twists', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'unexpected', 'nothing', 'too', 'bottom', 'line', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'forgettable', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'give', 'nice', 'speech', 'wonderful', 'typical', 'Pacino', 'explosion', 'everyone', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'just', 'lacking', 'think', 'lacking', 'kind', 'real', 'story', 'want', 'see', 'better', 'movie', 'genre', 'see', 'Spy', 'Game', 'much', 'better', 'movie']",The Recruit
607868,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00005JLX2,"John ""MovieAddict""","[0, 0]","There is a term I use in cinema. It is called ""Vizzini's Law."" The sharpest of movie buffs will pick up on the obvious reference to Wallace Shawn's character in ""The Princess Bride"" (1987). I use Vizzini's Law when a film manipulates the audience into thinking things will either a) happen, or b) not happen. In ""The Princess Bride,"" Shawn's character gives a speech to Cary Elwes' Westley, where he explains that Westley wants him to think poison is in a certain goblet of wine. ""Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me!"" His speech goes on. The point of it is that Vizzini must deduce what Westley wants him to think from the mess.And I use this reference when a film does the same as Westley. It pulls the audience's leg so many times, the audience loses count of which one is being pulled. They have to wonder what the filmmakers WANT us to think, then realize that the conclusion of the mess is the OPPOSITE of what they want us to think. Or is it?Some films that use Vizzini's Law are ignorant and become irritable. But Roger Donaldson's ""The Recruit"" is far from boring, irritable, or ignorant. Sometimes the twists and turns are obvious, but most of the time they are more fun. It's not an especially wonderful thriller, but it's enjoyable, and will welcome a second-viewing to pick up on missed tidbits.The film is about a mentor and his student. Al Pacino the mentor, Colin Farrell the student. Farrell is James Clayton, a computer whiz-kid who turns down an offer from Dell Computers to become a CIA agent with help from instructor Al Pacino. These set-up scenes move a bit too quickly at times to catch, but I suppose you just need to be able to pick up on certain things.Clayton goes to ""The Farm,"" a CIA training/recruiting facility that teaches the government's up-and-coming finest what to do. Like go into a bar and come back with women. Right. I doubt the CIA wastes taxpayers' money on such games. But it's fun to watch. As Pacino's character Walter Burke tells Clayton, ""Trust no one. Nothing is what it seems."" This applies to the scene I mention.The film takes a lot of twists and turns, so many that it probably makes ""Memento"" look pale. But ""Memento"" had clever twists, and ""The Recruit"" has somewhat expected ones. It's not a particularly special film, there's no doubt about it. But it's a heckuva lot of fun to watch, even if its running time is a bit too long. (Only two hours? Felt like two and a half.)I noticed that the film takes too long in scenes that don't matter, and speeds things up in scenes that do. Take the beginning and the end, for instance. The middle, though entertaining, is very slow-paced, and you can't expect to doze off during it. You might miss a twist.Al Pacino is a real scene-stealer here, containing a lot of charisma. He uses a lot of recycled actions and cliched dialogue, but it's fun to watch Pacino take a light-hearted character. People criticized Pacino's (performance in) ""S1m0ne."" I embraced it. I embraced ""The Recruit"" even more. No one actor can be expected to come up with Oscar-winners every year, and Pacino knows it, plays to it, and has fun. His character is ruff, tough and gruff, and looks shaggy and unhygienic. He's looking a lot like Serpico with the beard.Collin Farrell is a talented young actor, and I expect him to go pretty far. He's a lot better than some of the up-and-coming-now-they're-here-and-there's-nothing-you-can-do-about-it (cough-BEN AFFLECK-cough) actors. I enjoy him on screen, much more so than Affleck. Instead of playing the baddie Bullseye in Daredevil, perhaps he should have played the main character himself.If you're looking for some sly espionage thrills, pick up ""The Recruit."" It plays like ""Spy Games,"" ""The Bourne Identity,"" and a Jack Ryan movie. Well, not really. But it's fun. And according to Vizzini's Law, it's a winner.",4,"3.5 stars, actually...",1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,4145,"['term', 'use', 'cinema', 'called', 'Vizzini', 'Law', 'sharpest', 'movie', 'buffs', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'obvious', 'reference', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'character', 'Princess', 'Bride', '1987', 'use', 'Vizzini', 'Law', 'when', 'film', 'audience', 'thinking', 'things', 'will', 'either', 'happen', 'b', 'not', 'happen', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Shawn', 'character', 'speech', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Westley', 'where', 'Westley', 'think', 'poison', 'certain', 'goblet', 'wine', 'Now', 'clever', 'man', 'would', 'put', 'poison', 'own', 'goblet', 'would', 'know', 'only', 'great', 'fool', 'would', 'reach', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'am', 'not', 'great', 'fool', 'can', 'clearly', 'not', 'choose', 'wine', 'front', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'fool', 'would', 'have', 'counted', 'can', 'clearly', 'not', 'choose', 'wine', 'front', 'speech', 'point', 'Vizzini', 'must', 'deduce', 'what', 'Westley', 'think', 'mess.And', 'use', 'reference', 'when', 'film', 'same', 'Westley', 'audience', 'leg', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'audience', 'count', 'one', 'being', 'pulled', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'WANT', 'think', 'then', 'realize', 'conclusion', 'mess', 'OPPOSITE', 'what', 'want', 'think', 'films', 'use', 'Vizzini', 'Law', 'are', 'ignorant', 'become', 'irritable', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'Recruit', 'far', 'boring', 'irritable', 'ignorant', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'obvious', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'more', 'fun', 'not', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'thriller', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'welcome', 'second-viewing', 'pick', 'up', 'missed', 'tidbits.The', 'film', 'mentor', 'student', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'mentor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'student', 'Farrell', 'James', 'Clayton', 'computer', 'whiz-kid', 'who', 'down', 'offer', 'Dell', 'Computers', 'become', 'CIA', 'agent', 'help', 'instructor', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'set-up', 'scenes', 'move', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'times', 'catch', 'suppose', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'certain', 'things.Clayton', 'Farm', 'CIA', 'training/recruiting', 'facility', 'government', 'up-and-coming', 'finest', 'what', 'do', 'go', 'bar', 'come', 'back', 'women', 'Right', 'doubt', 'CIA', 'taxpayers', 'money', 'such', 'games', 'fun', 'watch', 'Pacino', 'character', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'Clayton', 'Trust', 'one', 'Nothing', 'what', 'scene', 'mention.The', 'film', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'so', 'many', 'probably', 'Memento', 'look', 'pale', 'Memento', 'had', 'clever', 'twists', 'Recruit', 'somewhat', 'expected', 'ones', 'not', 'particularly', 'special', 'film', 'doubt', 'heckuva', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'running', 'time', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'Only', 'two', 'hours', 'Felt', 'two', 'half', 'noticed', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'speeds', 'things', 'up', 'scenes', 'do', 'Take', 'beginning', 'end', 'instance', 'middle', 'entertaining', 'very', 'slow-paced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'doze', 'off', 'might', 'miss', 'twist.Al', 'Pacino', 'real', 'scene-stealer', 'here', 'containing', 'lot', 'charisma', 'lot', 'recycled', 'actions', 'cliched', 'dialogue', 'fun', 'watch', 'Pacino', 'take', 'light-hearted', 'character', 'People', 'criticized', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'S1m0ne', 'embraced', 'embraced', 'Recruit', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'come', 'up', 'Oscar-winners', 'year', 'Pacino', 'fun', 'character', 'ruff', 'tough', 'gruff', 'shaggy', 'unhygienic', 'looking', 'lot', 'Serpico', 'beard.Collin', 'Farrell', 'talented', 'young', 'actor', 'expect', 'go', 'pretty', 'far', 'lot', 'better', ""up-and-coming-now-they're-here-and-there's-nothing-you-can-do-about-it"", 'cough-BEN', 'AFFLECK-cough', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'screen', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Affleck', 'Instead', 'playing', 'baddie', 'Bullseye', 'Daredevil', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'main', 'character', 'himself.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'sly', 'espionage', 'thrills', 'pick', 'up', 'Recruit', 'Spy', 'Games', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'fun', 'according', 'Vizzini', 'Law', 'winner']",The Recruit

But now, thinking about it, alot of it seemed really ridiculous. I won't go into the story--many have done that already. But these are my points:First, you would think that James would be a little suspicious of having to break into Layla's computer. I mean, Burke could've done so himself after hours or on the weekend. There was no reason to sneak into it while she was at work.Second, what was the deal with Layla and Zack? It's never explained why they were working together--doing what? What was Zack's role? In fact, what job did Zack get after he finished at the Farm? And that note she passed to him? Duh, how about just telling him in person when they were at work. They are allowed to speak to eachother. And then why did Zack run and then fire at James? Makes no sense at all. In fact, it was one of the stupidest scenes in the movie.Third, didn't James think it odd that he was working only with Burke? Burke was the head instructor at the Farm. Why would James be dealing with him on this mission? He also would've been hooked up with others, and given a thorough briefing on his new role as NOC. Not just told in a car by his instructor and then set to work. Again, really stupid.Fourth, the ending is pretty dumb, when you think about it. And we don't really know what happened? Did James really wash out at the Farm? Was he really a NOC? Was he still in the CIA? He's sitting in a car with another spook, going to be debriefed, and the guy tells him that it's in &quot;his blood.&quot; So what does that mean? Is he in or out?Fifth, it seems that if Burke really wanted this program, he had enough access to figure out a simpler means of stealing it. He had enough clout there, and supposedly, as a spy of 27 years, enough brains to figure out something more foolproof, involving less people and less chance of a slip-up.This could have been a good movie, as I liked the beginning about the training.

Al Pacino, what can you say about Al Pacino; in every movie he does he's Al Pacino and that's what makes him the brilliant actor he is, change the name of the role, it doesn't matter what and you still have Al Pacino.  Colin Farrell does an admirable job in this movie as well as does Bridget Moynahan.The movie purports to be ""loaded with twists and turns,"" which is a statement I will agree with, whether they're suspenseful twists and turns is in the eye of the beholder.  The one thing that sets a movie apart from others is that it turns out something new, something that hasn't been seen before.  With ""The Recruit,"" yes we get to see ""The Farm"" which is very interesting in and of itself, but overall, many of the plot twists that are there to ""surprise"" and raise the level of tension before the payoff, all seem to be somewhat predictable.  This is not to say that the film is not enjoyable, because it is, it's just not groundbreaking.The premise:Al Pacino plays a CIA recruiter and he sets his sights on Colin Farrell's character for recruitment into the CIA's training program.  After some interesting initial scenes, we're taken to ""the farm"" where we see the main character going through the training program.  Where the plot picks up is when he's no longer in the training program and is out on ""the mission.""

607877,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JLX2,Lawyeraau,"[4, 10]","This film is a fast paced, cat and mouse, guessing game type of spy thriller. The cinematography is suitably dark and dreary for the most part. The overall cast is excellent. It is the screenplay that is problematic, as it has a great many plot holes and fails to provide sufficient motivation for the actions of its main characters. The ending, unfortunately, is the biggest problem of all. Quite frankly, if the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were run in real life the way it is run in this film, no wonder we have had trouble with intelligence, as that is what is lacking in this film.Al Pacino plays the role of  Walter Burke, the CIA recruiter whose catch phrase is &quot;nothing is as it seems&quot;. He woos a potential new recruit,  computer whiz James Clayton (Colin Farrell). Manipulated from the get go by Burke, Clayton, who has daddy issues, reluctantly signs on. He is sent to CIA training school, which is called &quot;The Farm&quot;.  While at &quot;The Farm&quot;, Clayton meets fellow recruit,  Layla Moore  (Bridget Moynahan), to whom he is attracted and with whom he is later paired for a training  exercise that proves to be more rigorous than anticipated.When things at &quot;The Farm&quot; do not go as expected , Clayton gets a series of surprises, one of which is that Burke claims that Layla is a mole and it is Clayton's mission to expose her and her handlers. Initially reluctant, Clayton takes on the assignment, though he is clearly conflicted by his feelings towards Layla. There are some intriguing scenes and plot twists leading up to the ostensible denouement of Layla and the ultimate betrayal. The grand finale, however, is laughable, as well as totally ludicrous.Al Pacino is, for the most part,  good as the somewhat bombastic CIA scout, though at times, he seems more like a flim-flam man in whom only the terminally stupid will believe. This, however, is more attributable to  the script, then to the acting.  Colin Farrell is fine as the wide-eyed recruit with the perpetually scruffy, five o'clock shadow on his face.  Bridget Moynahan is also good as Layla, Clayton's love interest and fellow recruit. While they never really heat up the screen, it is not for lack of trying.This is a film that one should rent rather than buy.",3,"SOMEWHAT SILLY, THOUGH MODERATELY ENTERTAINING, SPY FLICK...",1055030400,"06 8, 2003",2003,2273,"['film', 'fast', 'paced', 'cat', 'mouse', 'guessing', 'game', 'type', 'spy', 'thriller', 'cinematography', 'suitably', 'dark', 'dreary', 'most', 'part', 'overall', 'cast', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'problematic', 'great', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'fails', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'motivation', 'actions', 'main', 'characters', 'ending', 'unfortunately', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'CIA', 'were', 'run', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'run', 'film', 'wonder', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'intelligence', 'what', 'lacking', 'film.Al', 'Pacino', 'role', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'CIA', 'recruiter', 'catch', 'phrase', 'quot', 'nothing', 'quot', 'woos', 'potential', 'new', 'recruit', 'computer', 'whiz', 'James', 'Clayton', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Manipulated', 'get', 'go', 'Burke', 'Clayton', 'who', 'daddy', 'issues', 'reluctantly', 'signs', 'sent', 'CIA', 'training', 'school', 'called', 'quot', 'Farm', 'quot', 'quot', 'Farm', 'quot', 'Clayton', 'fellow', 'recruit', 'Layla', 'Moore', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'whom', 'attracted', 'whom', 'later', 'paired', 'training', 'exercise', 'be', 'more', 'rigorous', 'anticipated.When', 'things', 'quot', 'Farm', 'quot', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'expected', 'Clayton', 'series', 'surprises', 'one', 'Burke', 'Layla', 'mole', 'Clayton', 'mission', 'expose', 'handlers', 'Initially', 'reluctant', 'Clayton', 'assignment', 'clearly', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'towards', 'Layla', 'are', 'intriguing', 'scenes', 'plot', 'twists', 'leading', 'up', 'ostensible', 'denouement', 'Layla', 'ultimate', 'betrayal', 'grand', 'finale', 'however', 'laughable', 'as', 'well', 'totally', 'ludicrous.Al', 'Pacino', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'somewhat', 'bombastic', 'CIA', 'scout', 'though', 'times', 'more', 'flim-flam', 'man', 'whom', 'only', 'terminally', 'stupid', 'will', 'believe', 'however', 'more', 'attributable', 'script', 'then', 'acting', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'fine', 'wide-eyed', 'recruit', 'perpetually', 'scruffy', 'five', ""o'clock"", 'shadow', 'face', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'also', 'good', 'Layla', 'Clayton', 'love', 'interest', 'fellow', 'recruit', 'never', 'really', 'heat', 'up', 'screen', 'not', 'lack', 'trying.This', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy']",The Recruit

This genre is what I call The Grizzled Veteran Teaches the Wide-Eyed Rookie.  In THE RECRUIT, director Roger Donaldson tries to combine this genre with several others with only middling success.  Al Pacino is the Grizzled Veteran CIA head spook Walter Burke who takes the Yale educated computer whiz James Clayton (Colin Farrel) as a CIA agent in training.  The training scenes that show CIA boot camp are the film's most interesting even if the training itself is most unbelievable.  If the CIA really teaches its rookie agents how to be neophyte James Bonds, then it is no surprise that the real life CIA is as inept as it is.  For another film with a similar theme try 13 RUE MADELINE in which James Cagney puts his rookie agents through a training regimine that smacks of real-life use.  Director Donaldson seemed fascinated with the turncoat agent played by Richard Conte and reprised his role as sexy Farsi-speaking female agent Layla (Bridget Moynahan), who predictably has a steamy love affair with Colin Farrel.  It is when THE RECRUIT leaves the pseudo-world of CIA training for the pseudo-world of CIA love affairs that this film goes seriously astray.  The manipulating that Pacino pulls on both Moynahan and Farrel is so obvious that he might just as well have attached puppet strings to their limbs.  Without giving away what is supposed to be a surprise ending, I began to suspect that truly sometimes things are exactly what they seem.  Director Donaldson does not make things easy for the audience by linking plot events in such a way that the links connect nowhere.  It is one thing for a director to mislead the audience in a witty way.  It is quite another when that director has so little respect for the audience that he does not even pretend to tie up loose ends that cry out for tying.It is not Pacino's fault that THE RECRUIT is a glossy superficial film that on one level is a recruiting film much like TOP GUN was fifteen years ealier.  Pacino plays his war-weary character with just the right note.  At times his exhortations to his charges have the ring of Master Po to Grasshopper from KUNG FU.  Still, you would think that a master spook like his Burke character would have been smart enough to take his own good advice.  Colin Farrel is unconvincing as an inchoate piece of play dough waiting to be molded.  The ending is a contrived piece of cinematic fluff that was inserted only because THE RECRUIT was touted as a thriller.  Since this film was not a true thriller, I suggest that for future thrillers, Director Donaldson rent 13 RUE MADELINE to see how legitimate spine-tingling suspense can be generated when a director has respect for his audience.",2,Sometimes Things Are Exactly What They Seem,1055203200,"06 10, 2003",2003,2796,"['popular', 'film', 'genre', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'resist', 'remaking', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'decade', 'genre', 'what', 'call', 'Grizzled', 'Veteran', 'Teaches', 'Wide-Eyed', 'Rookie', 'THE', 'RECRUIT', 'director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'combine', 'genre', 'several', 'others', 'only', 'middling', 'success', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Grizzled', 'Veteran', 'CIA', 'head', 'spook', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'who', 'Yale', 'educated', 'computer', 'whiz', 'James', 'Clayton', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'CIA', 'agent', 'training', 'training', 'scenes', 'show', 'CIA', 'boot', 'camp', 'are', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'even', 'training', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'CIA', 'really', 'rookie', 'agents', 'how', 'be', 'neophyte', 'James', 'Bonds', 'then', 'surprise', 'real', 'life', 'CIA', 'as', 'inept', 'film', 'similar', 'theme', 'try', '13', 'RUE', 'MADELINE', 'James', 'Cagney', 'rookie', 'agents', 'training', 'regimine', 'smacks', 'real-life', 'use', 'Director', 'Donaldson', 'seemed', 'fascinated', 'turncoat', 'agent', 'played', 'Richard', 'Conte', 'reprised', 'role', 'sexy', 'Farsi-speaking', 'female', 'agent', 'Layla', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'who', 'predictably', 'steamy', 'love', 'affair', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'when', 'THE', 'RECRUIT', 'pseudo-world', 'CIA', 'training', 'pseudo-world', 'CIA', 'love', 'affairs', 'film', 'seriously', 'astray', 'manipulating', 'Pacino', 'Moynahan', 'Farrel', 'so', 'obvious', 'might', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'attached', 'puppet', 'strings', 'limbs', 'giving', 'away', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'surprise', 'ending', 'began', 'suspect', 'truly', 'sometimes', 'things', 'are', 'exactly', 'what', 'seem', 'Director', 'Donaldson', 'not', 'make', 'things', 'easy', 'audience', 'linking', 'plot', 'events', 'such', 'way', 'links', 'connect', 'nowhere', 'one', 'thing', 'director', 'mislead', 'audience', 'witty', 'way', 'quite', 'when', 'director', 'so', 'little', 'respect', 'audience', 'not', 'even', 'pretend', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'cry', 'out', 'tying.It', 'not', 'Pacino', 'fault', 'THE', 'RECRUIT', 'glossy', 'superficial', 'film', 'one', 'level', 'recruiting', 'film', 'much', 'TOP', 'GUN', 'was', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ealier', 'Pacino', 'war-weary', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'times', 'exhortations', 'charges', 'have', 'ring', 'Master', 'Po', 'Grasshopper', 'KUNG', 'FU', 'Still', 'would', 'think', 'master', 'spook', 'Burke', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smart', 'enough', 'take', 'own', 'good', 'advice', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'unconvincing', 'inchoate', 'piece', 'play', 'dough', 'waiting', 'be', 'molded', 'ending', 'contrived', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'fluff', 'was', 'inserted', 'only', 'THE', 'RECRUIT', 'was', 'touted', 'thriller', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'thriller', 'suggest', 'future', 'thrillers', 'Director', 'Donaldson', 'rent', '13', 'RUE', 'MADELINE', 'see', 'how', 'legitimate', 'spine-tingling', 'suspense', 'can', 'be', 'generated', 'when', 'director', 'respect', 'audience']",The Recruit

Pacino uses many of the elements of his previous roles, and why not--the man is a brilliant actor and sometimes you never know what to expect from him in spite of his familiarity.  Bridget Moynihan (Sum of All Fears) co-stars as fellow recruit and would be lover for Farrell.  (...) she possesses a strong sense of character in this multi-leveled role.  Gabriel Macht in a smaller role as Zach is also very good, as Moynihan's other possible love interest.  Even with the many clever twists and turns, the ending becomes predictable but not until the movie is almost over.  Credit Donaldson for this succinct direction.

It succeeds due to the good writing and the acting of the two principal leads, Al Pacino and Colin Farrell.Farrell plays an ace computer programmer haunted by the death of his father over a decade earlier.  Pacino is a recruiter for the CIA who hints that Farrell's father may have been a member of the company.  Farrell enlists and trains for field work; this recruitment and training takes up around half the movie.The second half of the story has Pacino - one of the main trainers - recruiting Farrell for his first assignment, dealing with a mole within the Agency.  Although some of the plot twists are foreseeable, others are less obvious, and if the ending wraps up everything a little too neatly, it is nonetheless satisfying.In certain ways, this is a rather standard suspense flick, but as said before, it is the writing and acting that help it excel.  Farrell holds his own with the veteran Pacino, and the rest of the relatively no-name cast also puts forth a decent effort.

It reveals in great detail the slimy, sleazy, sorry underbelly of espionage.I have seen this movie on cable before and they cut it up so much the movie loses its impact.  Watching it on DVD is much better.This movie is a perfect example of why JFK had planned to dismantle the CIA and why Jimmy Carter severely reduced their numbers.

607911,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JLX2,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 2]","""The Recruit"" is a well-made-yet-obviously-cheap CIA thriller that lured moviegoers into the theater based on the casting of Al Pacino and kept them there through a fast-paced first hour. The climax is a little underwhelming, and it's rare to see a thriller actually divided into two halves, but ""The Recruit"" milks about as much out of this concept as it can.CIA recruiter Walter Burke (Pacino) has his eye on smart, rough MIT graduate James Clayton (Colin Farrell) who's developed a virus-like computer program and is courting offers from various firms to apparently begin cementing illegal monopolies. But James has questions about his father's mysterious death in Peru, and Walter hints at answers...James enlists in the Company, as it's called, and embarks on a tough, mind-numbing training session on The Farm, which serves as locale for the best parts of ""The Recruit."" It's standard you-are-there-and-ain't-it-cool stuff, but Pacino kicks it up a notch, as he usually does, intoning the grave mystery and importance of CIA  --""They show you your medal. You don't even get to take it home"" -- while he slyly inches closer to becoming a second father to James. Also in training is Layla (Bridget Moynahan) a bit of a plain-faced Jane whose soft eyes nevertheless look like a nice place for James to call home.A lot is made of the line ""nothing is what it seems"" in the movie, but we can sense the arc not long after the movie's second half begins, after James has been ""thrown out"" of the training program only to be told by Walter that he's been selected for an undercover mission to spy on on a mole within the training unit -- Layla. Inevitably, James will have to choose whom to believe -- the lover or the 2nd dad -- and let it be said that ""The Recruit"" chooses the less interesting of those two options as the villain.Director Roger Donaldson (""No Way Out,"" ""Thirteen Days"") is very good at these kind of close-quartered, low budget affairs. It's a CIA movie, but there aren't any overseas locales; indeed, the primary sets seem to be a bedroom, the inside of a car and a blank office building meant to double as the CIA. Aside the three prinicpals, the cast is a collection of nobodiesThe MacGuffin -- the sinister spy thing everybody's after -- is almost ludicrous, but at least the actors wind themselves up into a believable frenzy over it. Pacino's back in his ""weathered, grizzled"" mode from ""Insomnia"" and ""Donnie Brasco"" and yep, he's still good at it. Farrell is up to the challenge, and while Moynahan may not set the screen ablaze, she's a effectively vulnerable.""The Recruit"" did decent business during its run through the theater but don't expect a sequel, despite the movie's hints at one.",3,"A long trip to the beach, a short day there.",1055376000,"06 12, 2003",2003,2716,"['Recruit', 'well-made-yet-obviously-cheap', 'CIA', 'thriller', 'lured', 'moviegoers', 'theater', 'based', 'casting', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'kept', 'fast-paced', 'first', 'hour', 'climax', 'little', 'underwhelming', 'rare', 'see', 'thriller', 'actually', 'divided', 'two', 'halves', 'Recruit', 'milks', 'as', 'much', 'concept', 'recruiter', 'Walter', 'Burke', 'Pacino', 'eye', 'smart', 'rough', 'MIT', 'graduate', 'James', 'Clayton', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'developed', 'virus-like', 'computer', 'program', 'courting', 'offers', 'various', 'firms', 'apparently', 'begin', 'cementing', 'illegal', 'monopolies', 'James', 'questions', 'father', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Peru', 'Walter', 'hints', 'answers', 'James', 'Company', 'called', 'embarks', 'tough', 'mind-numbing', 'training', 'session', 'Farm', 'locale', 'best', 'parts', 'Recruit', 'standard', ""you-are-there-and-ain't-it-cool"", 'stuff', 'Pacino', 'up', 'notch', 'usually', 'intoning', 'grave', 'mystery', 'importance', 'CIA', 'show', 'medal', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'take', 'home', 'inches', 'closer', 'becoming', 'second', 'father', 'James', 'Also', 'training', 'Layla', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'bit', 'plain-faced', 'Jane', 'soft', 'eyes', 'nevertheless', 'look', 'nice', 'place', 'James', 'call', 'home.A', 'lot', 'made', 'line', 'nothing', 'what', 'movie', 'can', 'sense', 'arc', 'not', 'long', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'begins', 'James', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 'training', 'program', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'Walter', 'been', 'selected', 'undercover', 'mission', 'spy', 'mole', 'training', 'unit', 'Layla', 'Inevitably', 'James', 'will', 'have', 'choose', 'whom', 'believe', 'lover', '2nd', 'dad', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'Recruit', 'less', 'interesting', 'two', 'options', 'villain.Director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'Way', 'Out', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'very', 'good', 'kind', 'close-quartered', 'low', 'budget', 'affairs', 'CIA', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'overseas', 'locales', 'indeed', 'primary', 'sets', 'seem', 'be', 'bedroom', 'inside', 'car', 'blank', 'office', 'building', 'meant', 'double', 'CIA', 'Aside', 'three', 'prinicpals', 'cast', 'collection', 'nobodiesThe', 'MacGuffin', 'sinister', 'spy', 'thing', 'everybody', 'almost', 'ludicrous', 'least', 'actors', 'wind', 'up', 'believable', 'frenzy', 'Pacino', 'back', 'weathered', 'grizzled', 'mode', 'Insomnia', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'yep', 'still', 'good', 'Farrell', 'up', 'challenge', 'Moynahan', 'may', 'not', 'set', 'screen', 'ablaze', 'effectively', 'vulnerable', 'Recruit', 'did', 'decent', 'business', 'run', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sequel', 'movie', 'hints', 'one']",The Recruit

Glossy visuals are a plus too. The eminently watchable Pacino is no slouch in the charisma department as usual.

The plot is that a young man is recruited by a CIA operative played by Al Pacino and soon nothing is what is seems. The problem of course is that for such a film to work one has to care. In this rather slow moving film one does not care and one tends to go to sleep as the plot plods on and on.The film is devoted mainly to the training given to CIA recruits. What is portrayed is vaguely like the training done for those who join the Mossad. One wonders how realistic it is as a large number of actual CIA employees would be desk jockeys who would look at a computer all day. Never the less we follow our intrepid hero as he and his class mates learn the secrets of counter intelligence, or maybe just intelligence. The background is that the central character?s father might have been a CIA agent and this mystery gives the Al Pacino power to manipulate him.The central premise to the film is totally absurd and plot hole follows plot hole. The manipulation of the main character is so transparently stupid that one would think that six year old children would say, this is not real.

Look at &quot;No Way Out&quot; or &quot;Dante's Peak.&quot;  (&quot;Thriteen Days&quot; is one exception.)  And with &quot;The Recruit,&quot; did he change?  Apparently not.So, the film starts well.  Al Pacino literally recruits a MIT computer wiz Colin Farrell.  Come with me, and work for CIA.  Al (with thick beard) trains him with other applicants in &quot;The Farm,&quot; where the US government secretly teaches ABC of being spy.  But the young Colin soon realizes that he can trust nothing during the tricky course of the training.The first half is pretty interesting even though the training programs are obviously imagination of the filmmakers.  Of course, CIA must have shown some part of the facilities but if there should be really 'The Farm,' they will neither affirm nor deny the existence of it, let alone show it to you.  But still the production designs are polished (like that of &quot;Anti-Trust&quot;) and the story is stylishly done.The problem is the second half, in which another character (played by Bridget Moynahan) steps in.  Quite honestly, the plot is predictable to the discerning eyes of the fans of the genre, and I want no more not-so-stylish use of guns, chases, and so on.  And the conclusion is a huge letdown, or in other words, impossible.Another weakness is (don't worry no spoilers) the characters' motives.  Why Colin's character wants to be a spy when he is a top student from MIT?  It is explained in the opening credits, but it is not strong enough.  Moreover, the film even seems to forget that original motive in the long and widing road of mysteries that come again and again, as if never content with the initial premise.  Surprise is surprise when it seldom comes, but in &quot;The Recruit&quot; they rush to you like avalanche.Al Pacino, one of the greatest actors living, is not bad, but not good either.  At least his beard is not a good idea, making him too conspicous (hey, he is working for CIA, isn't he?).  He is much better in other films like &quot;The Insider&quot; (or any of his films in the 70s).  Colin Farrell is just fine, but I am afraid his turn in &quot;Phone Booth&quot; is much more convincing as the man in the extraordinary situations.Just a good thriller, and just that.

This isn't one of them. Everything is EXACTLY as it appears in this predictable and routine thriller. Hitchcock would have been ashmed at the mundane writing and plotting of this lazy thriller. This is connect the dots screenwriting; you know exactly where the film is going, how it's going to get there and what the outcome is within the first hour of the film.The film is saved by a couple of nice performances by Pacino, Farrell and the marvelous Bridget Moynihan. The extras highlight what is known about the real CIA Farm and what sort of training they go through. Our guide is a real CIA operative (or so he says--maybe things aren't as they appear...mmmmm). The best thing about the film is the glimpse into what might be the mode the CIA uses to train and wash out recruits to the agency. Regardless, it's clear it would take a special type of person to work for the CIA; as Pacino points out, it ain't for the money, the chicks or the fame as they don't get any of that.

During training, he meets Layla Moore, an attractive young woman for whom he develops feelings.From there things take numerous twists and turns, most of which are simply not that believable.  The movie is one of the few that actually examines CIA training, and many of those scenes are inherently interesting.  However, the main case/plot is too convuluted and uninteresting to carry the rest of the movie.  The standard chases and double crosses are all here, and are pretty tired.  It's hard to get excited about a spy thriller that is so static (it's based entirely in the DC area).

""The Recruit"" occupies a spot near the top of my list due to its fast-moving plot and bevy of twists/turns.The basic plot of this film focuses on a fresh crop of CIA wannabes.  One cadet in particular (Colin Farrell) catches the eye of the lead instructor (Al Pacino), and is given a top-secret assignment far beyond his supposed experience level.  From there, the stakes only continue to escalate as the cadet struggles to complete his mission.The hallmark of this movie is that just when you think you have a bead on it, it throws you another curveball.  Some of the other Amazon reviewers have commented that the plot twists seemed predictable or inconsistent, but I couldn't disagree more.  I was on the edge of my seat for the entire film and never felt cheated or jerked around.The acting is also sound all around.  Pacino may be kind of a nut, but he sure can act (he almost steals the show in this case).  Farrell is adept as the young cadet who wants something more than a 9-5 employment.  Bridget Moynahan also turns in a good performance as a potential love interest for Farrell's character.Thus, I highly recommend ""The Recruit"" to any and all fans of action/thrillers.
