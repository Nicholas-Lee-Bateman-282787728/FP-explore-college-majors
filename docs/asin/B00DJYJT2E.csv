1656012,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00DJYJT2E,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 4]","Jack (Brendan Fraser) is a tree hugger who gets himself landed in jail. He composes sappy letters to his daughter which are read to us in a low caveman voice. While Jack is in jail, his family (minus his separated wife/lawyer Lara Daans) are out camping when they run into a Steinbeck novel and become hunted. The film creates characters, but there is no connection to the viewer. The action isn't anything to get excited over. The main interest of the film becomes Kenny (Ethan Suplee). Kenny was in a truck accident and has some mental issues. He believes Jack's wife, who he talks to by cell phone, is his own mother. Apparently Canadian films has solved the problem of cell phone reception in remote areas.The cat and mouse chase in the woods seemed secondary to the film which was pushing the theme of Jack reconciling his actions with his daughter. It didn't mesh as well as it could. Makes for a desperation rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb.

1656013,ARXYVR1TPTY6P,B00DJYJT2E,"TJ-STL ""DVD viewer""","[0, 0]","I don't know where to start. The bad guy does needless killing, and even the &#34;nice&#34; bad guy kills. Bad guy shots from close up and misses, and Hero keeps wasting ammo shooting from long distances with a sawed off shotgun without aiming. During chase scene 20 the hero has a long fight with the &#8220;good&#8221; bad while his daughter is screaming don&#8217;t hurt him. Minutes later the hero swims over to the bad guy and fights again. This time and he stabs the bad guy in the stomach, but like all movies the hero does not &#34;neutralize&#8221; the bad guy. So the bad guy come to with only a cut on 3 fingers. Then chase number 30 starts. The hero is shoot close up, then come back to life from off screen, and is able to fight. Here comes the really bad part.  Since the film was running out of money, the bad guy finally dies accidentally killing his &#8220;good&#8221; bad guy brother during the struggle from another rifle shot, some how while rolling on the ground.  Conclusion. The good guy who had escaped from prison, kills 2 bad guys, and the film immediately fades after that fight to black while his lawyer wife start talking to the dark screen, apparently some days or weeks later &#34;I want to thank you for dismissing ALL of the charges and letting my husband out of jail. Short titles continue, and since it is a budget movie it ends during the 15 seconds!  This flick is DUMP, STUPID, SIMPLISTIC and even worse than my rambling review. DO NOT BUY or WATCH THIS MOVIE!

While trying to save a forest from being cut down he gets into a fight and someone ends up dead. When Jack's kids, out for a camping trip, witness a murder the killers begin to stalk them in order to keep them from talking. When Jack hears about this he plans to save them, after breaking out of prison. I know what your thinking. That really sounds exciting and should be fun to watch. I thought the same thing. Then I started to watch it. This is one of the least exciting ""chase"" movies I have ever seen. It could have been because of what I expected but I found it hard to stay interested in this for the whole movie. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it's just not what I was hoping for.
