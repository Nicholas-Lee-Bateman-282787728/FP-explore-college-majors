761330,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000A2ZNN,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","This `Pretty Woman'-lite flick that no one has seen has a few nice moments but mostly winds up being a forgettable and lazy film revolving around a man who falls in love with a hooker.  The best part about the film is that he doesn't know she is one, and so their communication becomes unintentionally hilarious (since she believe he knows he's a hooker), but outside of that the film becomes rather pedestrian.  Ed Harris is rather loose here, which is a nice change of pace for him, and Melanie Griffith is notably sassy here, but the general plot feels really predictable and not very well thought out, and that takes away from the film a great deal.  The film follows Frank, a young boy who saves up money along with his friends to pay a hooker to show them her breasts.  That hooker happens to be V, who then proceeds to stay in Frank's tree-house while his father fixes her car.  His father thinks that she is a math tutor and eventually falls in love with her, only to uncover what she really does for a living.

The humor is great, and Melanie Griffith gives what I think is the most charming role in her career in my opinion. I think she is a great actress overall and the prettiest and most enlightening. The story revolves around Frankie Wheeler who goes to the city with his buddies to see thier first naked woman. A phase that most boys of that age go through in life at some times. The thing I liked about this movie the most was the way she gave a mother figure role to Frankie since his real mother passed away while giving birth to Frankie. The most emotional part was when V gives Frankie the motherly embrace and he starts feeling sad and asks her what's it like to have a Mom. That part chokes me up every time I see this movie. The whole feeling that V gets across in this film makes it a feel good movie. The other thing I like about this movie that it was filmed in Lebanon, OH. which is only an hour or so from where I live and is a very charming historic town with the oldest historic Inn of Ohio called The Golden Lamb that is well worth visiting and the Village Ice Cream parlor across the street from Golden Lamb. Both charming to visit when in that area of Ohio. Milk Money is going to be a timeless classic for generations to come. Check it out. You won't be dissapointed.

If that's the point when you turn this off it's a shame for there is a little more to this film than 'man meets hooker man loves hooker'.  First off, the man doesn't know she's a hooker till half way through.  The man is Ed Harris and the hooker V is played by Melanie Griffith.  The story follows Frank, Harris's son, as he and his friends save up their money to pay a hooker to show them her breasts.  That hooker is V.  In a chain of events V ends up staying in Franks tree-house while his father fixes her car.  Frank, who has never known what it's like to have a mother beings that his mother died giving birth to him, is excited to have V around and is convinced she would be the perfect step-mother (although I find it strange that he wants his step-mother to be the woman he just saw naked).  The funny parts of this film consist of when they talk about V's line of work since V believes Ed Harris knows she's a hooker and he believes she's a Math Tutor.

In this film, Griffith steals the show. Milk Money has an interesting idea, but it is carried out in a way we've seen thousands of times before. Griffith's character is a character that's been played thousands of times before, but this film still works. Three preadolescent kids named Frank, Kevin, and Brad all long for one thing...To see a woman naked. All three of them are clueless about sex and women in general and the script portrays these kids exactly how they would be in real life. It doesn't exaggerate their curiosity, it hits it right on. Anyway, they figure in order to see a woman naked that they must have some money and go into ""the city.""So, they begin collecting milk money. When they have it, they ride into the city to find a woman who will take off her clothes for money. For a while, they're unsuccesful; But after a near-run in with a thug, they meet V (Griffith)who gives the boys what they want. I know this sounds perverse, but it's done pretty tastefully. Anyway, the boys get stranded so V gives them a ride home but gets stranded herself when her car breaks down. It occurs to one of the boys, Frank, around this time that maybe V can marry his single dad Tom (Oscar nominee Ed Harris). Why not? Of course, V and Tom fall for each other quickly (although Tom is under the impression that V is a math tutor); But V's pimp has been ripping off people and has recently been killed and his killer Walter (Malcolm McDowell, with a wonderfully campy take on the character he's had to play over-and-over again since ""A Clockwork Orange"") is looking for V. Does true love prevail? Of course it does but that doesn't mean that, in between the beginning and the end, you can't be entertained. I love the characters in this film and I love the actors who play them. Yes, they're trapped in this carbon copy script but they make it work...Especially Griffith, who takes the hooker-with a heart-of-gold thing and makes it her own. Not for everybody, but it's smooth and senseless entertainment.GRADE: B+",4,Milk Money,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2197,"['Milk', 'Money', 'movie', 'perverse', 'sounding', 'plot', 'actually', 'charming', 'not', 'cliched', 'predictable', 'movie', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'Griffith', 'show', 'Milk', 'Money', 'interesting', 'idea', 'carried', 'out', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousands', 'times', 'Griffith', 'character', 'character', 'been', 'played', 'thousands', 'times', 'film', 'still', 'Three', 'preadolescent', 'kids', 'named', 'Frank', 'Kevin', 'Brad', 'long', 'one', 'thing', 'see', 'woman', 'naked', 'three', 'are', 'clueless', 'sex', 'women', 'general', 'script', 'kids', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'exaggerate', 'curiosity', 'right', 'Anyway', 'figure', 'order', 'see', 'woman', 'naked', 'must', 'have', 'money', 'go', 'city', 'So', 'begin', 'collecting', 'milk', 'money', 'When', 'have', 'ride', 'city', 'find', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'money', 'while', ""'re"", 'unsuccesful', 'near-run', 'thug', 'meet', 'V', 'Griffith', 'who', 'boys', 'what', 'want', 'know', 'perverse', 'done', 'pretty', 'tastefully', 'Anyway', 'boys', 'get', 'stranded', 'so', 'V', 'ride', 'home', 'stranded', 'herself', 'when', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'one', 'boys', 'Frank', 'time', 'maybe', 'V', 'can', 'marry', 'single', 'dad', 'Tom', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Why', 'not', 'course', 'V', 'Tom', 'fall', 'other', 'quickly', 'Tom', 'impression', 'V', 'math', 'tutor', 'V', 'pimp', 'been', 'ripping', 'off', 'people', 'recently', 'been', 'killed', 'killer', 'Walter', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'wonderfully', 'campy', 'take', 'character', 'had', 'play', 'over-and-over', 'again', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'looking', 'V.', 'Does', 'true', 'love', 'prevail', 'course', ""n't"", 'mean', 'beginning', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'entertained', 'love', 'characters', 'film', 'love', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'carbon', 'copy', 'script', 'make', 'work', 'Especially', 'Griffith', 'who', 'hooker-with', 'heart-of-gold', 'thing', 'own', 'Not', 'everybody', 'smooth', 'senseless', 'entertainment.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

Frank and his two buddies want to see a real-live naked lady, so they scrounge up a hundred bucks and ride their bikes into the city to find a prostitute. Meanwhile, Tom is occupied trying to save a local patch of wetlands.The kids hook up with ""V,"" played by Melanie Griffith.  ""V"" decides it's okay to show them the goods -- they don't have enough body hair to be dangerous, she says -- and they're thrilled.  (It's hard to determine how thrilled Michael Patrick Carter is, since he has a perpetual grin on his face throughout the  film.)The kids' bikes get stolen, so ""V"" borrows her pimp's car to take them home.  Frank tells his dad ""V"" is a math tutor, and there's a funny exchange between the two where Tom thinks she's talking about mathematics when she's really talking about sex.  The two take a liking to each other, and Frank hopes ""V"" will marry his dad -- her car has broken down, stranding her in the suburbs.  Frank stashes her in his treehouse until Tom makes up his mind.Mucking things up is a ruthless gangster, Waltzer, played by Malcolm McDowell.  Waltzer thinks ""V"" has her pimp's stash of money -- money that Waltzer believes is rightfully his. Waltzer is a cold-blooded killer --  it's pretty much the same character McDowell plays in ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,"" and his presence really disrupted the lighthearted tone of this film for me.Anyway, things wrap up tidily by the end, with Frank delivering my favorite last line in movie history, second only to ""Caddyshack.""  If you're a guy who watched ""Pretty Woman"" two hundred times in high school or are completely insane, you'll probably enjoy watching ""Milk Money.""",3,The Dairy Challenge,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,1764,"['Michael', 'Patrick', 'Carter', 'Frank', 'Wheeler', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'son', 'Tom', 'Wheeler', 'widowed', 'botanist', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Frank', 'two', 'buddies', 'want', 'see', 'real-live', 'naked', 'lady', 'scrounge', 'up', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'ride', 'bikes', 'city', 'find', 'prostitute', 'Meanwhile', 'Tom', 'occupied', 'trying', 'save', 'local', 'patch', 'wetlands.The', 'kids', 'hook', 'up', 'V', 'played', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'V', 'okay', 'show', 'goods', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'body', 'hair', 'be', 'dangerous', ""'re"", 'thrilled', 'hard', 'determine', 'how', 'thrilled', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'Carter', 'perpetual', 'grin', 'face', 'film', 'kids', 'bikes', 'get', 'stolen', 'V', 'pimp', 'car', 'take', 'home', 'Frank', 'dad', 'V', 'math', 'tutor', 'funny', 'exchange', 'two', 'where', 'Tom', 'talking', 'mathematics', 'when', 'really', 'talking', 'sex', 'two', 'take', 'liking', 'other', 'Frank', 'V', 'will', 'marry', 'dad', 'car', 'broken', 'down', 'stranding', 'suburbs', 'Frank', 'treehouse', 'Tom', 'up', 'mind.Mucking', 'things', 'up', 'ruthless', 'gangster', 'Waltzer', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Waltzer', 'V', 'pimp', 'stash', 'money', 'money', 'Waltzer', 'rightfully', 'Waltzer', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'character', 'McDowell', ""'ll"", 'Sleep', 'When', ""'m"", 'Dead', 'presence', 'really', 'disrupted', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'film', 'me.Anyway', 'things', 'wrap', 'up', 'tidily', 'end', 'Frank', 'delivering', 'favorite', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'history', 'second', 'only', 'Caddyshack', ""'re"", 'guy', 'who', 'watched', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'two', 'hundred', 'times', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'completely', 'insane', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Milk', 'Money']",N/A
