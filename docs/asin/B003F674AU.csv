1343131,A2JDEEPS6VN5UH,B003F674AU,"J. F. Nesmith ""Page Turner""","[12, 12]","Unlike the other reviewer, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I am quite a WWII buff, and I thought the story was quite good. The first hour was not the most intriguing hour of television I have seen, but give it time.The actors, for the most part, are talented British character actors. I was amazed at how incredibly beautiful the heroine, Cyd Hayman was and still is. She has the ethereal beauty of those gorgeous actresses from the 40's, like Gene Tierney. I am very surprised that with her talent and beauty she did not become a star.There were a few technical mistakes made concerning the uniforms of the SS and a few of the  Resistance fighters' holsters were obviously empty of firearms when they were about to do battle with the nasty Germans.A British actor playing a German sergeant was annoying and he grated on my nerves. He was cast as an intelligence operative by the name of SGT Gratz. I kept hoping someone would bump him off and put me out of my misery.So, if you have nothing to do for 26 hours or so some weekend, pull up a comfortable chair, pop some corn, kick back, and enjoy the series.",5,An Engaging Story,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,1109,"['other', 'reviewer', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'am', 'quite', 'WWII', 'buff', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'intriguing', 'hour', 'television', 'have', 'seen', 'give', 'time.The', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'talented', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'incredibly', 'heroine', 'Cyd', 'Hayman', 'was', 'still', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'gorgeous', 'actresses', '40', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'talent', 'beauty', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'star.There', 'were', 'few', 'technical', 'mistakes', 'made', 'concerning', 'uniforms', 'SS', 'few', 'Resistance', 'fighters', 'holsters', 'were', 'obviously', 'empty', 'firearms', 'when', 'were', 'about', 'do', 'battle', 'nasty', 'Germans.A', 'British', 'actor', 'playing', 'German', 'sergeant', 'was', 'annoying', 'grated', 'nerves', 'was', 'cast', 'intelligence', 'operative', 'name', 'SGT', 'Gratz', 'kept', 'hoping', 'someone', 'would', 'bump', 'off', 'put', 'misery.So', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', '26', 'hours', 'so', 'weekend', 'pull', 'up', 'comfortable', 'chair', 'pop', 'corn', 'kick', 'back', 'enjoy', 'series']",Manhunt - The Complete Series
1343132,AE2ZADTV8Y0YY,B003F674AU,"P. A. Panozzo ""educator, history enthusiast, ...","[9, 9]","Manhunt is a British TV serial that was produced in 1970.  It is an excellent story, 26 episodes, each about 50 minutes in length.  The characters are richly detailed and well portrayed by Alfred Lynch, Peter Barkworth and Cyd Hayman.  It is an engaging story about an English pilot, Squadron Leader Jimmy Porter (played by Alfred Lynch), who was shot down in France and is trying to return to England.  He meets up with a French resistance leader code-named Vincent (played by Peter Barkworth), who is tasked with getting to England a young woman code-named Nina,(played by Cyd Hayman), possessing vital Resistance information.  The three are inextricably bound together as they journey through France attempting to escape the Germans. Other reviews point out some weaknesses: film quality is not optimal (remember it was made 40 years ago - film technology has changed) poor acting / British actors portraying French and German characters (they did their best and I was fine with their performances) German uniform inaccuracies (noticeable but not a big deal).  In spite of these limitations, this is an excellent dramatic story that allows the viewer to escape.  Other British TV serials that I highly recommend are Danger UXBDanger UXBFoyle's WarFoyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Dayand Wish Me LuckWish Me Luck: Complete CollectionI particularly enjoy the realism these shows have achieved in portraying World War Two.",5,AN EXCELLENT BRITISH TV SERIES!,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1434,"['Manhunt', 'British', 'TV', 'serial', 'was', 'produced', '1970', 'excellent', 'story', '26', 'episodes', '50', 'minutes', 'length', 'characters', 'are', 'richly', 'detailed', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Alfred', 'Lynch', 'Peter', 'Barkworth', 'Cyd', 'Hayman', 'engaging', 'story', 'English', 'pilot', 'Squadron', 'Leader', 'Jimmy', 'Porter', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Lynch', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'France', 'trying', 'return', 'England', 'up', 'French', 'resistance', 'leader', 'code-named', 'Vincent', 'played', 'Peter', 'Barkworth', 'who', 'tasked', 'getting', 'England', 'young', 'woman', 'code-named', 'Nina', 'played', 'Cyd', 'Hayman', 'possessing', 'vital', 'Resistance', 'information', 'three', 'are', 'inextricably', 'bound', 'together', 'journey', 'France', 'attempting', 'escape', 'Germans', 'Other', 'reviews', 'point', 'out', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'quality', 'not', 'optimal', 'remember', 'was', 'made', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'technology', 'changed', 'poor', 'acting', '/', 'British', 'actors', 'portraying', 'French', 'German', 'characters', 'did', 'best', 'was', 'fine', 'performances', 'German', 'uniform', 'inaccuracies', 'noticeable', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'spite', 'limitations', 'excellent', 'dramatic', 'story', 'viewer', 'escape', 'Other', 'British', 'TV', 'serials', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'Danger', 'UXBDanger', 'UXBFoyle', 'WarFoyle', 'War', 'Series', '1-5', 'Dunkirk', 'VE-Dayand', 'Wish', 'Me', 'LuckWish', 'Me', 'Luck', 'Complete', 'CollectionI', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'realism', 'shows', 'have', 'achieved', 'portraying', 'World', 'War', 'Two']",Manhunt - The Complete Series

I will donate it to our public library, so I have something to feel good about.And then the ending.

The writers didn't even make us feel good that something was accomplished!In the opening scene, one French resistance leader wanted to shoot her so the Germans would not capture her with all this ""vital"" personnel info.
