This bland description doesn't do  justice to this film though.  The characters are well-written and not  thrown together like so many current anime offerings.  The animation is  crisp and refreshing, and the soundtrack offers a nice, moody background to  the film.  For a plot that has been tried before, Patlabor 1 should be  looked at as the standard for Japanese animation.

My only problem is that the DVD has so many bugs in it, it almost ruins the film.  Pixelated globs appear on the opening credits, still shots shudder and  frames freeze when the layers switch over. In addition the hacks at Manga  made a decision to &quot;pan &amp; box&quot; this film (a disgusting state  between true letterboxing and pan &amp; scan).

484484,A7FVX0OOEIHYZ,6305951640,"Bjorn ""wolf-sigma""","[17, 20]","I need to start by saying I have not watched anything but the Patlabor Movies so I have no clue what the series is all about.  I also need to say that I bought this film on the heels of watching Macross Plus, my favorite anime EVER, and was expecting an action mech film.  Boy was I suprised.The first time I watched this, I literally fast forwarded through most of it to get the the action.  Imagine my dismay when I got there and there seemed to be NONE!  I threw down the movie in disgust and left.Weeks later my friend who got me into Anime saw it and asked to watch it.  I told him I thought it was crap but why not.  This time...I actually watched the movie and I was blown away with its deep story, amazing imagination and palpable theme of discovery and mystery.  For plot line and story, look at the other reviews, I'm just here to give opinion.Patlabor uses Labors, or mecha, not as show stealing engines of destruction but as obvious evolutions of police enforcement.  As such, there is no flashy gundam style energy exchange or more deliberate destruction of the mechwarrior fame.  But what you do get is a deep plot of industrial espionage, mysterious dissapearences and a suprisingly realistic look at what future law enforcement would actually look like, detective work too.In the end, I realized that all anime need not be about amazing action.  Patlabor has a pretty good action scene towards the end but that is not why I suggest this movie.  I say watch this because it shows what anime can also bring to our DVD players.  A well written, well studied movie that would probably crash at the box office because everyone expects it to shoot stuff.",5,For once an anime that is NOT an action film...completly,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,1664,"['need', 'start', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'anything', 'Patlabor', 'Movies', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'series', 'also', 'need', 'say', 'bought', 'film', 'heels', 'watching', 'Macross', 'Plus', 'favorite', 'anime', 'EVER', 'was', 'expecting', 'action', 'mech', 'film', 'Boy', 'was', 'suprised.The', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'literally', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'most', 'get', 'action', 'Imagine', 'dismay', 'when', 'got', 'there', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'NONE', 'threw', 'down', 'movie', 'disgust', 'left.Weeks', 'later', 'friend', 'who', 'got', 'Anime', 'saw', 'asked', 'watch', 'told', 'thought', 'was', 'crap', 'why', 'not', 'time', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'deep', 'story', 'amazing', 'imagination', 'palpable', 'theme', 'discovery', 'mystery', 'plot', 'line', 'story', 'look', 'other', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'just', 'here', 'give', 'opinion.Patlabor', 'uses', 'Labors', 'mecha', 'not', 'show', 'stealing', 'engines', 'destruction', 'obvious', 'evolutions', 'police', 'enforcement', 'such', 'flashy', 'gundam', 'style', 'energy', 'exchange', 'more', 'deliberate', 'destruction', 'mechwarrior', 'fame', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'deep', 'plot', 'industrial', 'espionage', 'mysterious', 'dissapearences', 'suprisingly', 'realistic', 'look', 'what', 'future', 'law', 'enforcement', 'would', 'actually', 'look', 'detective', 'work', 'too.In', 'end', 'realized', 'anime', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'amazing', 'action', 'Patlabor', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'scene', 'end', 'not', 'why', 'suggest', 'movie', 'say', 'watch', 'what', 'anime', 'can', 'also', 'bring', 'DVD', 'players', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'studied', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'crash', 'box', 'office', 'everyone', 'shoot', 'stuff']",Patlabor 1 - The Movie

Starting with Shenmue, I came to the conclusion that not every thing has to be fast paced to be enjoyable. As far as movies go, Patlabor fits that bill quite nicely.More of a crime drama/exploration film, I think the first thing that jumped out at me is the direction. Mamoru Oshii did an excellent job with not only the cinamatagraphy, but the setups as well. Needless to say, nothing felt jarring at all in the movie. Another thing that helped the tone of the movie was the soundtrack. The soundtrack was very well composed(not something I normally say about anime soundtracks. Especially with j-pop openings).To me, the movie is kinda of an exploration of man and his machines. Man creates machine. Man becomes dependent on machine. Man, therefore becomes machine. It seems as though the antgonist in this movie saw this horrible revolation and commits suicide. Not before sending Tokyo to impending doom with his plan(not gonna share details. I have told enough).I think one thing that would have made this movie better was if I had saw the original TV series(which I hear is pretty good). But alas, no DVD means no purchase as I am now on strict DVD only diet. But even so, the characters were, if not a little under developed, still deffentatly enjoyable. I just wish they had shared a little more background info. Oh well.Another thing that I thought worked to its advantage, was the lack of gratuitous mech action. I myself am not big mecha fan. But when the scenes that had the mechs in them were, from my standpoint, more emphasised, made it better. Rather than mindless battles that was one of many elements that made Gundam Wing hard to watch.Overal, good movie that is well directed and has cool storyline. Not fast paced fare but I was able to mangage. After all, Vampire Princess Miyu is one of my favorite animes. And that is pretty slow anime. Oh well, guess its not for everyone.",4,Better than I expected,985046400,"03 20, 2001",2001,2136,"['know', 'days', 'fast', 'cars', 'fast', 'music', 'fast', 'lifespans', 'music', 'fast', 'women', 'fast', 'food', 'thing', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'concidered', 'fast', 'let', 'know', 'anything', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'sometimes', 'need', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'Starting', 'Shenmue', 'came', 'conclusion', 'not', 'thing', 'be', 'fast', 'paced', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'As', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'Patlabor', 'bill', 'quite', 'nicely.More', 'crime', 'drama/exploration', 'film', 'think', 'first', 'thing', 'jumped', 'out', 'direction', 'Mamoru', 'Oshii', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'cinamatagraphy', 'setups', 'as', 'well', 'Needless', 'say', 'nothing', 'felt', 'jarring', 'movie', 'thing', 'helped', 'tone', 'movie', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'composed', 'not', 'something', 'normally', 'say', 'anime', 'soundtracks', 'Especially', 'j-pop', 'openings', '.To', 'movie', 'kinda', 'exploration', 'man', 'machines', 'Man', 'machine', 'Man', 'dependent', 'machine', 'Man', 'therefore', 'machine', 'antgonist', 'movie', 'saw', 'horrible', 'revolation', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Not', 'sending', 'Tokyo', 'impending', 'doom', 'plan', 'not', 'gon', 'share', 'details', 'have', 'told', 'enough', '.I', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'was', 'had', 'saw', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'hear', 'pretty', 'good', 'alas', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'am', 'now', 'strict', 'DVD', 'only', 'diet', 'even', 'so', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'little', 'developed', 'still', 'deffentatly', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'shared', 'little', 'more', 'background', 'info', 'Oh', 'well.Another', 'thing', 'thought', 'worked', 'advantage', 'was', 'lack', 'gratuitous', 'mech', 'action', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'mecha', 'fan', 'when', 'scenes', 'had', 'mechs', 'were', 'standpoint', 'more', 'emphasised', 'made', 'better', 'Rather', 'mindless', 'battles', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'elements', 'made', 'Gundam', 'Wing', 'hard', 'watch.Overal', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'directed', 'cool', 'storyline', 'Not', 'fast', 'paced', 'fare', 'was', 'able', 'mangage', 'Vampire', 'Princess', 'Miyu', 'one', 'favorite', 'animes', 'pretty', 'slow', 'anime', 'Oh', 'well', 'guess', 'not', 'everyone']",Patlabor 1 - The Movie

I think it's refreshing to see an anime that contains very little violence.  It operates on detective work and technology.The story takes place in the near future.  Labors are robots that humans operate, and they're used for policing.  The robots have been going berzerk; E. Hoba, the person who wrote the program for the labors, committed suicide, so it's not like anyone can turn to him.  Also, it seems that Hoba was the one who created the bug in the labors anyhow.Noah and Azuma take matters into their own hands and begin to investigate.  They're basically only rookies, and it's hard for them to get approval from their superiors.  It makes for quite the interesting story.

After all people were comparing it to Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke, it had to be good.Unfortunatly, I did not find it to be entertaining at all... in fact, I was just waiting for it to end. The plot was slow, and the characters were developed poorly. I agree that it was a bit thought provoking, but there wasn't too much to think about, its no Ghost in the Shell in this aspect.Also, the animation is a bit dated, which would be ok if the series lived up to the standards of films such as Castle of Caglistro, but it doesn't.
