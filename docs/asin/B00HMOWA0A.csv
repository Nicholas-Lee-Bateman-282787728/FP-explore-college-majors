It has been a long 7 years since the first set was released.I grew up with this cartoon and have loved it since. The music and simple plots back in the day make this cartoon the classic that it is. Yes the graphics are cheesey by today's standards, but these type of cartoons bring you back to your youth when life was more innocent and simple. Just the way we like it.Looking forward to seeing the remaining cartoons like the previous ones along with the 2 part cartoons such as, ""The Japanese Sandman"", ""Luminians on the Loose"", ""The Ghost of Kilbane Castle"", ""Rain of Iron"", ""Team of Terror"", ""Luthor's Lethal Laser"", and ""Can a Luthor Change His Spots"".I noticed under the product details that one of the actors is Bob Hastings.

A multitude of issues affect this release, including discoloration, image flickering and dirt & scratches throughout.

Most of the time however, the episodes needed some kind of basic work which is otherwise standard before bringing a video to market in this digital age.It&#8217;s unfortunate that people give five star reviews for the product before watching the DVD themselves, as it misrepresents the quality of the release.I have included some screenshots in the image gallery to show the low quality of this DVD release versus the much higher quality versions on the original 1985 VHS release.",2,Sub-Par Warner Archive release!,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,1122,"['Warner', 'Home', 'Video', '8217', 's', 'star', 'certainly', 'waned', 'years', '8217', 'put', 'less', 'money', 'effort', 'releases', 'worst', 'release', 'have', 'simply', 'pulled', 'degraded', 'reels', 'shelf', 'digitized', 'Warner', 'one', 'biggest', 'media', 'corporations', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'just', 'towards', 'restoration', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'color', 'correction', 'multitude', 'issues', 'affect', 'release', 'including', 'discoloration', 'image', 'flickering', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'entirely', 'shape', 'were', 'found', 'materials', 'were', 'good', 'shape', 'then', 'were', 'fortunate', 'Most', 'time', 'however', 'episodes', 'needed', 'kind', 'basic', 'work', 'otherwise', 'standard', 'bringing', 'video', 'market', 'digital', 'age.It', '8217', 'unfortunate', 'people', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'product', 'watching', 'DVD', 'quality', 'release.I', 'have', 'included', 'screenshots', 'image', 'gallery', 'show', 'low', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'versus', 'much', 'higher', 'quality', 'versions', 'original', '1985', 'VHS', 'release']","New Adventures of Superman, The S2 & 3"

Even though it's still several months away, this news made my day. And so even though I haven't seen the DVDs yet, I've seen the cartoons often enough to give this DVD five stars right from the get-go!This series is under-appreciated and even ignored by most fans, if they ever heard of it at all. But I was 10 when this series came out on Saturday mornings and it - even more than the live-action George Reeves Superman show from the 1950s that was being syndicated at the same time - was what prompted me to begin what has developed into a life-long habit of buying and reading Superman magazine and Action Comics on a regular basis.Granted, the animation is sub-par compared with the older cartoons from the 1940s, and sometimes the plots were a tad silly. But I always loved the imagination art, and the plots were no sillier than the source material was at the time! It was 1966, and i was only 10, and I wasn't the least bit fussy! I was rooted to the TV every Saturday morning when this show was running, and it was difficult to pull me away until the show was over!In fact, I still love this show. Besides the fact that Bud collyer was the perfect voice for superman, I loved the musical score; no one ever seems to appreciate the musical score. I still love to listen to them - especially the one where Superman is flying to the rescue once again. I can listen to them over and over again all day long!Superman is my hero, and finally my Superman TV collection will;be complete! Hooray!!!! :-)Edit: Well, not so big a Hooray after all. Just got my copy of the DVD set and the sound and video quality are very disappointing. I knew these weren't remastered or anything but... Golly, they looked and sounded better when they were available on Youtube than they do on these dvds. I've seen bootlegs of cartoons with better quality than this. What the hell? Was this the best they could do? The episodes are all there, but they seem so faded and faint compared with the Season 1 set that I can't help but wonder what went wrong.Therefore, I have downgraded my original rating from five stars to three.

Some say the plots were silly but I was a kid growing up way back in the 1960's and the plots were fine to me.  The plots as I remember them always had a basic honorable moral.  Superman in the 1960's era animations was made to appear far more human and approachable than the later versions which added layers of &#34;Darkness&#34; to super heros.My memories of this THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN: SEASONS 2 & 3 DVD set center around Superman being just plain fun.  There was a basic moral to each episode but it was not thrown into your facelike the politically correct crap of today.  In THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN: SEASONS 2 & 3 you can see Clark Kent more as the corn fed homespun country boy turned city slicker news reporter at the Daily Planet.For an animated series THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN: SEASONS 2 & 3 havea certain weight behind them.  You look at the animation and the plots and you can tell the people working to create the show at leasted loved the Superman mythos.  I was never a big comic book reader.  I was too busy reading books about atomic power, electricity and other weird stuff but come Saturday Morning rain, snow, sleet or shine I was so totally there in front of the TV soaking up THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN: SEASONS 2 & 3.  I've puchased all the animations of my childhood as to this will become part of my collection.  I highly recommend this series to all who love Superman in his many incarnations.",5,THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN: SEASONS 2 & 3,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,1550,"['NEW', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'SUPERMAN', 'SEASONS', '2', '3', 'were', 'staple', 'saturday', 'morning', 'TV', 'diet', 'growing', 'up', 'say', 'plots', 'were', 'silly', 'was', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'way', 'back', '1960', 'plots', 'were', 'fine', 'plots', 'remember', 'always', 'had', 'basic', 'honorable', 'moral', 'Superman', '1960', 'era', 'animations', 'was', 'made', 'appear', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'approachable', 'later', 'versions', 'added', 'layers', '34', 'Darkness', '34', 'super', 'heros.My', 'memories', 'THE', 'NEW', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'SUPERMAN', 'SEASONS', '2', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'center', 'Superman', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'was', 'basic', 'moral', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'thrown', 'politically', 'correct', 'crap', 'today', 'NEW', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'SUPERMAN', 'SEASONS', '2', '3', 'can', 'see', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'more', 'corn', 'fed', 'homespun', 'country', 'boy', 'turned', 'city', 'slicker', 'news', 'reporter', 'Daily', 'Planet.For', 'animated', 'series', 'THE', 'NEW', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'SUPERMAN', 'SEASONS', '2', '3', 'havea', 'certain', 'weight', 'look', 'animation', 'plots', 'can', 'tell', 'people', 'working', 'create', 'show', 'leasted', 'loved', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'comic', 'book', 'reader', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'reading', 'books', 'atomic', 'power', 'electricity', 'other', 'weird', 'stuff', 'come', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'shine', 'was', 'so', 'totally', 'front', 'TV', 'soaking', 'up', 'NEW', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'SUPERMAN', 'SEASONS', '2', '3', ""'ve"", 'puchased', 'animations', 'childhood', 'will', 'become', 'part', 'collection', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'love', 'Superman', 'many', 'incarnations']","New Adventures of Superman, The S2 & 3"
