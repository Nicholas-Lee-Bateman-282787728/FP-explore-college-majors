727907,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00007G1TF,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[8, 10]","The Earlton household is a rather strange one, particularly now that the head of the family has died suddenly.  The Earltons have something that most families don't-a savage ape caged up in the basement (apparently, the late Mr. Earlton was some type of scientist).  Yogi the ape detests Ruth Earlton for some unexplained reason, and he has a restless, sometimes rather raucous night once daughter Ruth returns to her old home for the reading of her father's will.  Her uncle Robert, an invalid, welcomes her home alongside the family attorney and long-time servants Mrs. Krug and her son Hanss.  Even though Ruth brings along her fianc&eacute;, she is in for a restless night, one punctuated by murder.  When Ruth is first awakened during the night by a hairy arm coming from out of nowhere to try and strangle her, suspicion falls on the ape, but there seems to be no way the ape could have escaped his cage.  Unsurprisingly, there are dark secrets in the house, ones which the audience has a good handle on from the start (which, unfortunately, takes away from some of the potential suspense).  Nonetheless, there is one aspect of the full story that I did see coming.Filmed in 1931, this movie does feature some comic relief in the form of Exodus (played by Willie Best, who is identified in the cast list by the name of ""Sleep N' Eat""), a stereotypical black auto driver who conveys Ruth back to her family home.  If you try to look past the racist element of the role, the character does provide some welcome humor in an otherwise bland, plodding film.  In point of fact, Exodus is really the only character with enough sense to be afraid of whatever is going on in the weird house.Basically, there is really nothing special about this early film to make it stand out, but it is a tolerably good mystery-horror story.",3,"Not really a monster movie, but tolerably good",1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,1823,"['Earlton', 'household', 'rather', 'strange', 'one', 'particularly', 'now', 'head', 'family', 'died', 'suddenly', 'Earltons', 'have', 'something', 'most', 'families', ""don't-a"", 'savage', 'ape', 'caged', 'up', 'basement', 'apparently', 'late', 'Mr.', 'Earlton', 'was', 'type', 'scientist', 'ape', 'Ruth', 'Earlton', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'restless', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'raucous', 'night', 'once', 'daughter', 'Ruth', 'returns', 'old', 'home', 'reading', 'father', 'will', 'uncle', 'Robert', 'invalid', 'home', 'family', 'attorney', 'long-time', 'servants', 'Mrs.', 'Krug', 'son', 'Hanss', 'Even', 'Ruth', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'restless', 'night', 'one', 'punctuated', 'murder', 'When', 'Ruth', 'first', 'awakened', 'night', 'hairy', 'arm', 'coming', 'nowhere', 'try', 'strangle', 'suspicion', 'falls', 'ape', 'there', 'be', 'way', 'ape', 'could', 'have', 'escaped', 'cage', 'Unsurprisingly', 'are', 'dark', 'secrets', 'house', 'ones', 'audience', 'good', 'handle', 'start', 'unfortunately', 'away', 'potential', 'suspense', 'Nonetheless', 'one', 'aspect', 'full', 'story', 'did', 'see', 'coming.Filmed', '1931', 'movie', 'feature', 'comic', 'relief', 'form', 'Exodus', 'played', 'Willie', 'Best', 'who', 'identified', 'cast', 'list', 'name', 'Sleep', 'N', 'Eat', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'auto', 'driver', 'who', 'Ruth', 'back', 'family', 'home', 'try', 'look', 'racist', 'element', 'role', 'character', 'provide', 'welcome', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'bland', 'plodding', 'film', 'point', 'fact', 'Exodus', 'really', 'only', 'character', 'enough', 'sense', 'be', 'afraid', 'going', 'weird', 'house.Basically', 'really', 'nothing', 'special', 'early', 'film', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'tolerably', 'good', 'mystery-horror', 'story']",N/A
727908,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00007G1TF,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","Universal's success with DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN spawned a wave of horror films at other studios--and the 1932 THE MONSTER WALKS was among them.  In terms of entertainment, it is merely tolerable at best, but it does offer the opportunity to see what other studios were doing in the genre at the time and how their films stand up along those created by Universal.  In this instance the answer is ""not very well.""Although it doesn't credit them, THE MONSTER WALKS seems to be drawn from two sources.  The idea of a murderous ape is central to the Edgar Allen Poe story ""Murders In The Rue Morgue""--and that story was filmed the same year at Universal with Bela Lugosi as star.  The idea of a mysterious house with secret pannels through which a hairy-handed killer strikes at a pretty heiress is straight out the 1927 silent block-buster THE CAT AND THE CANARY, which had also been popular in a 1930 talkie remake titled THE CAT CREEPS.  So original, it isn't.In this story, pretty young Ruth (Vera Reynolds, a silent actress whose career did not long continue after the advent of sound) returns home when her father dies.  There she must contend with a suspicious uncle (Sheldon Lewis), a suspicious housekeeper (Martha Mattox, who had appeared in the silent THE CAT AND THE CANARY), the housekeeper's suspcious son (Mischa Auer), and a wild ape named Yogi that is kept caged in the basement.  No, it isn't too long before hairy hands are reaching through secret panels in Ruth's bedroom.  But is it Yogi, who has a dislike for her?  Or is it someone else?  And if so, who?  Savvy viewers will have little trouble figuring it out.By 1932 standards the film is competently made but there is nothing about it you could call inspired--and one element that may gave you some pause.  The cast features a black actor Willie Best, billed here (no doubt in an effort to emulate the then-popular Stepin Fetchit) as Sleep 'N' Eat.  In truth, Best was a gifted comic, but like many black actors of the period his options were limited, and he was frequently trapped in ""lawsy I be skeered"" roles that fed into the stereotypes of the day.  Best does as well as he can with the role of Exodus, but like the rest of the cast he doesn't have much to work with.No, this movie isn't anything to write home about, and frankly I am tempted to give two stars instead of three--but as I wrote at the beginning of this review, it does give us an idea of what other studios were doing in an effort to compete with Universal's horror films.  And while there were occasional exceptions, it seems pretty obvious that Universal had little to worry about.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Mainly For Comparison Purposes,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,2647,"['Universal', 'success', 'DRACULA', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'spawned', 'wave', 'horror', 'films', 'other', 'studios', '1932', 'THE', 'MONSTER', 'WALKS', 'was', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'merely', 'tolerable', 'best', 'offer', 'opportunity', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'studios', 'were', 'doing', 'genre', 'time', 'how', 'films', 'stand', 'up', 'along', 'created', 'Universal', 'instance', 'answer', 'not', 'very', 'well', ""n't"", 'credit', 'THE', 'MONSTER', 'WALKS', 'be', 'drawn', 'two', 'sources', 'idea', 'murderous', 'ape', 'central', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'story', 'Murders', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'story', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', 'year', 'Universal', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'star', 'idea', 'mysterious', 'house', 'secret', 'pannels', 'hairy-handed', 'killer', 'strikes', 'pretty', 'heiress', 'straight', '1927', 'silent', 'block-buster', 'THE', 'CAT', 'AND', 'THE', 'CANARY', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'popular', '1930', 'talkie', 'remake', 'titled', 'THE', 'CAT', 'CREEPS', 'So', 'original', 'story', 'pretty', 'young', 'Ruth', 'Vera', 'Reynolds', 'silent', 'actress', 'career', 'did', 'not', 'long', 'continue', 'advent', 'sound', 'home', 'when', 'father', 'must', 'contend', 'suspicious', 'uncle', 'Sheldon', 'Lewis', 'suspicious', 'housekeeper', 'Martha', 'Mattox', 'who', 'had', 'appeared', 'silent', 'THE', 'CAT', 'AND', 'THE', 'CANARY', 'housekeeper', 'suspcious', 'son', 'Mischa', 'Auer', 'wild', 'ape', 'named', 'Yogi', 'kept', 'caged', 'basement', 'No', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'before', 'hairy', 'hands', 'are', 'reaching', 'secret', 'panels', 'Ruth', 'bedroom', 'Yogi', 'who', 'dislike', 'someone', 'else', 'so', 'who', 'Savvy', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'little', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out.By', '1932', 'standards', 'film', 'competently', 'made', 'nothing', 'could', 'call', 'inspired', 'one', 'element', 'may', 'gave', 'pause', 'cast', 'black', 'actor', 'Willie', 'Best', 'billed', 'here', 'doubt', 'effort', 'emulate', 'then-popular', 'Stepin', 'Fetchit', 'Sleep', 'N', 'Eat', 'truth', 'Best', 'was', 'gifted', 'comic', 'many', 'black', 'actors', 'period', 'options', 'were', 'limited', 'was', 'frequently', 'trapped', 'lawsy', 'be', 'skeered', 'roles', 'fed', 'stereotypes', 'day', 'Best', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'role', 'Exodus', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'with.No', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'frankly', 'am', 'tempted', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'wrote', 'beginning', 'review', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'other', 'studios', 'were', 'doing', 'effort', 'compete', 'Universal', 'horror', 'films', 'were', 'occasional', 'exceptions', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Universal', 'had', 'little', 'worry', 'about.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

And who came up with the title? First of all there is no monster, only a chimpanzee in a cage in the basement. And the mastermind behind the murders does not even walk! He's in a wheelchair!The plot is simple enough, a dude dies and the will is read. The daughter got everything, but if something happens to her, than the dead man's brother gets everything, hmmmmm. Time to kill the girl.So we have a hand coming out of a headboard of a bed to strangle her, and we have a picture that moves to reveal a peephole. That about all the fright you'll get out of this. Can you handel it??Actually the dude who is doing the killing has himself set up with a pretty clever alibi. But you have to look for it. While he is killing, he makes like he is playing a violin in his room. But it is actually a phonograph providing the music. Then there is a little silohuette of a figure playing a violin. There is a light shining behind it to project a shadow on the window of the door. The siloheutte even moves by means of the phonograph, check it out.Well the killer (who accidently kills his mom) is now trying to kill the girl. Does he just kill her in the same fashion he accidently kills his mom? Of course not. He ties her to a pole and whips the chimp in the cage to work him into a frenzy. Unfortunatly for him, the chimp reaches through the bars and chokes him after a little tug-o-war with the whip. Yeah, this is pretty realistic.There is a little comedy relief in Exodus the driver. He is a black man, but he might as well be a white guy in blackface doing racist jokes in a minstral show.

727910,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00007G1TF,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 4]","This movie was so *yawn* exciting, I was hardly able to keep my eyes open.  The opening was incredibly original.  Wealthy Mr. Earlton died.  The relatives and various interested individuals gather for the reading of the will.  The daughter becomes wealthy and everyone else gets an allowance.  Unfortunately, some people seem to think that their mere existence gives them the right to someone else's money.The deceased Mr. Earlton had a pet ape in the basement.  It seems as though the pet ape is getting out somehow and attacking and killing people.  Bad ape!  Or is he?  You may play some dramatic music now.  You might also wonder whether it is coincidence that the now-wealthy daughter is the target of these attacks.From this point forward you see a lot of lurking by nearly everyone except for daughter Ruth Earlton (Vera Reynolds, who had a lengthy career in silent movies, but this film was one of her final films) and Dr. Ted Clayton (Rex Lease, whose career survived this film and extended beyond another 200 film and television appearances).  Well, there might have been minimal lurking by other people, but then this review would be less fun.I have to leave the viewer to watch this movie, because to say any more would be to give away the surprises, of which there are several.  I am guessing that when this movie was released in 1932 the plot surprises were quite shocking to the audiences of the era.  I must confess that some of the ""surprises"" you could see coming.  But a couple of the plot twists still amused me.The sound in this film was acceptable.  The picture was also reasonable with only modest deterioration.  I was pleased that the night scenes were very visible, as some older films suffer most during night scenes.Perspective matters a lot with this film.  I could easily see how silent movies significantly influenced the production of this film.  I suspect that audiences found sound to be so mesmerizing in the early 1930's that their expectations were different from ours.  The result is that much of this movie is predictable and seems to plod in places.  In spite of these problems, fans of old dark house movies may find this early thriller to be interesting from a historical perspective.
