Mathieu ""waldenpond88""","[1, 5]","...and ""Rifleman"", but not quite.However I enjoyed watching ""Flicka"" on German TV when I was young.I also enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"", ""Flicka"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",4,"Almost as good as ""Fury""...",1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,948,"['Rifleman', 'not', 'quite.However', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Flicka', 'German', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'young.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Checkmate', 'liked', 'Honey', 'West', 'Bourbon', 'Street', 'even', 'more', 'Then', 'was', 'M', 'Squad', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Detectives', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'never', 'missed', 'episode', 'school', 'everybody', 'talked', 'M', 'Squad', 'Detectives', 'next', 'day', 'think', 'large', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'potential', 'selling/releasing', 'more', 'classic', 'TV', 'series.Many', 'who', 'loved', 'Lassie', 'Flipper', 'Fury', 'Flicka', 'Gentle', 'Ben', 'TV', 'series', 'childhood', 'also', 'liked', 'Kentucky', 'Jones', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'Inger', 'Stevens', 'wish', 'two', 'wonderful', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'many', 'others', 'A', 'Man', 'called', 'Shenandoah', 'Robert', 'Horton', 'Hank', 'Dick', 'Kallman', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'Magic', 'Boomerang', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'Earth', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'would', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'DVD']",My Friend Flicka-TV SERIES-3 DVD Set-30 Episodes-Starring Johnny Washbrook

1508869,A3HTV3W2AOKSYN,B0062ZIPF4,Dennis S. Johnson,"[10, 10]","When I was 10, MY FRIEND FLICKA was my favorite show on TV. I always wanted to be Ken and live on that ranch in Wyoming and ride horses and have all those adventures.  Since all my family had was a b&w TV I didn't know these TV episodes were in color until I bought this DVD collection.  Over the years I had bought 16mm prints and a VHS tape of episodes, but never expected to find my favorite show on DVD, although I looked and looked.  Finally, I spotted this DVD set on amazon.com and snapped it up.  I think it may be the last DVD set available.  The DVD presents 30+ episodes from the show, almost all there were I think. Considering how old this show is, and that the DVD was created from 16mm color prints, the quality is very, very good. Depending on the episode, it goes from very good to excellent. You can watch a single show or run the whole series one after another. Although there are no commercials, each episode dose have full credits. For anyone who remembers and enjoyed ""My Friend Flicka"" this is a great buy.  The seller was excellent. He delivered a mint condition, unopened DVD, in record time.
