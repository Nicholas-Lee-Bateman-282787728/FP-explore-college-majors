Just like Patrick, he accidentally pops the bubble which leaves Spongebob and his friends on the run from the Antlantean Guards.Spongebob Atlantis is a funny two part Spongebob episode. Music fans will appreciate the fact that David Bowie provides the voice for the character of Lord Royal Highness. The movie aired on Nickelodeon.

Not that he has a high threshold, especially for SpongeBob, but he really enjoyed this ""movie.""  It's pretty typical SpongeBob in terms of the level of silliness, and it seems to be a hit with the target audience of children.  If your child likes SpongeBob, then he or she should like this movie.Plot-wise, SpongeBob finds the missing half of a special Atlantis coin, and when the pieces are joined, a special van arrives to take SpongeBob et al. to Atlantis.  David Bowie voices the leader of the Atlantians, and typical SpongeBob hijinks ensue.  If you are okay with your children watching SpongeBob, you won't find anything objectionable here.In my eyes, I prefer SpongeBob in 15 minute doses.  This ran for 45 minutes on TV, but that was with commercials.  I was surprised this was billed on Nicklodeon as a TV movie when in actuality, it was quite short.  I know there are complaints about Atlantis inconsistencies from mentions in past episodes, but come on, let's not take this too seriously.",4,My 4 year old enjoys this,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,1060,"['eyes', '4', 'almost', '5', 'year', 'old', 'homerun', 'Not', 'high', 'threshold', 'especially', 'SpongeBob', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'pretty', 'typical', 'SpongeBob', 'terms', 'level', 'silliness', 'be', 'hit', 'target', 'audience', 'children', 'child', 'likes', 'SpongeBob', 'then', 'should', 'like', 'movie.Plot-wise', 'SpongeBob', 'missing', 'half', 'special', 'Atlantis', 'coin', 'when', 'pieces', 'are', 'joined', 'special', 'van', 'take', 'SpongeBob', 'al', 'Atlantis', 'David', 'Bowie', 'leader', 'Atlantians', 'typical', 'SpongeBob', 'hijinks', 'ensue', 'are', 'okay', 'children', 'watching', 'SpongeBob', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'objectionable', 'here.In', 'eyes', 'prefer', 'SpongeBob', '15', 'minute', 'doses', 'ran', '45', 'minutes', 'TV', 'was', 'commercials', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'billed', 'Nicklodeon', 'TV', 'movie', 'when', 'actuality', 'was', 'quite', 'short', 'know', 'are', 'complaints', 'Atlantis', 'inconsistencies', 'mentions', 'past', 'episodes', 'come', 'let', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A

Snyder ""gads00""","[11, 18]","I have just watched this episode on Nickelodeon (at 45 minutes including commercial breaks it can hardly be called a ""movie"") and can't help but think that this was a complete waste of effort.  Aside from the complete disregard to previous references to Atlantis in the Spongebob canon, the premise is weak, the pacing is tedious, the Atlanteans look like recycled Blue Meanies from Y""ellow Submarine"", and the innumerable songs are characteristically (or perhaps fortunately) forgettable.  As an aside, one wonders if Nickelodeon tries so hard to cram so many Spongebob episode with songs because of extra revenue they can possible make by marketing CDs as well as DVDs.  Back to the main topic: had the writers cut the time-wasting songs and superfluous material from the episodes and condensed this to a standard 15-minute episode the story could have been much more enjoyable.  As it is, the DVD had better have a lot of extras and bonus episodes to make it worth the money for anyone buy it.",1,What a waste of effort,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,996,"['have', 'just', 'watched', 'episode', 'Nickelodeon', '45', 'minutes', 'including', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'called', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'effort', 'Aside', 'complete', 'disregard', 'previous', 'references', 'Atlantis', 'Spongebob', 'canon', 'premise', 'weak', 'pacing', 'tedious', 'Atlanteans', 'look', 'recycled', 'Blue', 'Meanies', 'Y', 'ellow', 'Submarine', 'innumerable', 'songs', 'are', 'characteristically', 'perhaps', 'fortunately', 'forgettable', 'aside', 'one', 'wonders', 'Nickelodeon', 'so', 'hard', 'cram', 'so', 'many', 'Spongebob', 'episode', 'songs', 'extra', 'revenue', 'can', 'possible', 'make', 'marketing', 'CDs', 'as', 'well', 'DVDs', 'Back', 'main', 'topic', 'had', 'writers', 'cut', 'time-wasting', 'songs', 'superfluous', 'material', 'episodes', 'condensed', 'standard', '15-minute', 'episode', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'had', 'better', 'have', 'lot', 'extras', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'make', 'money', 'anyone', 'buy']",N/A
