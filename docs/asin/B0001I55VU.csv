807102,A3NTNNIKNCI2MA,B0001I55VU,B. Andico,"[0, 0]","I didn't grow up watching BOY MEETS WORLD because it was never shown in Philippines. The first time I was able to watch an episode was at Disney Channel through cable. Since then, I'd watch a new episode everyday up until it was no longer being aired at Disney Channel. There and then I thought, I gotta have a DVD or VHS of this! But sadly, it wasn't available yet. Years later, I find it being released at last and I have to say that I'm more than elated that the production guys finally released it on DVD.Boy Meets World is simply about how a kid grows and faces everyday common challenges mostly with mistakes that he later on corrects, with or without his parent's guidance. It's a simple yet funny way of showing how growing up may not be a bed of roses to most, but it is quite an adventure. It's also about how important a family is, may it be seemingly dysfunctional or a picture of a perfect family.It is such a comic relief that it never ceased to make me laugh at the kids' wisecracks. It makes me wonder how smart alecky kids can be nowadays. Makes you think that these little critters can possibly eat you alive. Ha-ha!It was great seeing Ben Savage, the main actor portraying the lead role, grow up with this show and his strong connections with his relationships were enough to keep fans and viewers glued to their TV screens.BOY MEETS WORLD SEASON 1 DVD BOXED SET is where it all started.

In retrospect, I suppose this was suppose to begin warming up our minds to the idea and concept of summing up larger ideas into shorter descriptions. Yet at the time, I was eight going on nine and was just stoked to watch TV for school. So while my classmates, friends and peers were giving descriptions on shows like Rugrats, The Simpsons and Beavis & Butthead. I did a summary on the episode of Boy Meets World where Shawn allowed a girl to stay at his house because her father was beating her and my take on child and spousal abuse. The figurative record player came to a quick halt so to speak once I was done. At the time, i didn't enjoy the irony but now in retrospect as a twenty-two year old going on twenty-three I appreciate it more.Now, how was that relevant? Well,I thought it best summed up my long term love for the show Boy Meets World. Every since I was a little kid, this show has held a special place in my heart. Even now, eighteen years after discovering it, the show still reigns supreme as my all time favorite. Throughout, the main cast grows organically through seven seasons. Yet, before all the life changing growing pains that would follow, we have the first season. The subtle lessons parents Amy and Alan along with old traditionalist teacher Mr. Feeny bestow upon Cory, Shawn & Eric, which seem to still manifest serious truth and relevance into my own life. Regardless if they're being aimed at a twelve year old or not, the core truth of human emotions and growing pains are all here. Lets face it, with how the writers paired Cory and Shawn, they showed us the truest bromance of all time, before the term was even coined, with enough trouble and life lessons to nicely pan out and spread a 20 plus episode season, without becoming boring or tiresome. Now, the gang mostly steers clear of the more adult oriented trouble they would find in later seasons but again, the later seasons progressed so well because of how they laid the foundation of the show in the rest of the series. Plus the addition of class genius Minkus and hippie Topanga keep Cory & Shawn humble enough throughout.Wether you're from a younger generation, or somehow missed out on this show in the 90's, I highly recommend this product. Much like the elder Savage brother did in his time, Ben Savage summed up a decade of middle class, slacker kids just trying to find their place.

Near as I can tell, the new company in charge of the Boy Meets World franchise hasn't added anything new to the original three seasons that were released previously on DVD, this DVD set features all the season one episodes + a bonus episode from season four and select episodes have commentary from Ben Savage, Rider Strong, Will Friedle, Danielle Fischell, and executive producer Mark Jacobs, which can provide an interesting experience when recounting cast stories and funny little tidbits like the hooded wardrobe Corey and Shawn where saddled with in the first season. I wish they would've included William Daniels (Mr. Feeney) because he was such an major part of the show.
