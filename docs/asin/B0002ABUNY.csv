829258,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002ABUNY,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[9, 31]","It is odd what Cannes would allow in 1984.  Among them a British film at the cusp of the British Film Movement about a group of closeted homosexual boys, unwilling to leave the comfort of their university, of which one eventually becomes the coveted Russian spy Guy Burgess (or at least a small transgression).  On several top ten lists of international critics, this viewer had trouble understanding the overall tones, themes, and relative points to the film.  Was this a simple love story?  Was this film created to symbolize the unsympathetic, yet hypocritical views of homosexuality?  Was this a story about a scorned man and his distaste for what fellow Englishmen made him do?  Who knows!  Hating the idea of so many questions without answers, I challenged myself to watch this film a second time to ensure that obvious points were not being missed, and it faltered yet again.  ""Another Country"" is a hodgepodge of different ideas, social inconsistencies, and covered with an obscure layer of homosexuality.  It is a film about nationalism, about education, about love - but it never even scratches the surface of any of these - it just puts them on the table and expects the viewer to ""get it"".  As an outsider looking in, I was confused by the structure of the school, the intertwined love connections, and the purpose behind the bookends with the aging Everett.  ""Another Country"" was dull, trite, and overly presumptuous of itself without giving the viewer any foresight into the world created.  It is a dated film about a culture that doesn't exist everywhere, yet oddly the DVD does.Insult my intelligence if you must, but what sort of education were these students receiving?  For the course of 90 minutes, students read book nonchalantly, played dress up for the guard, insulted little boys, ran out of windows, spent money, yelled about Marxism, and made out with each other.  There was no visible structure; outside of being caught doing something wrong would mean lashes by the ""Gods"" of the House.  There were no teachers, there were no assignments, and there were no exams that one could see, merely the openness to allow these students to do whatever they wanted to with rules that seemed as archaic as this film.  Twenty-four years later, being an American with a structured University understanding, I was confused by this example.  This was a major issue with this film, because instead of focusing on the underlying themes, I was too caught up in the basic structure of this school.  It starts with a ""teacher"" finding two students making out, but from there these ""teachers"" become mere spirits of the mind - looming in the background as threats, but never seen.  From a believable standpoint, I was disappointed.  The confusion muddled the point, and the misunderstanding of how anyone could choose to stay longer merely to become a ""God"" of a house left the central focus lost in my eyes.With the unexplainable introduction to British education bewildering me at every turn, I must also question the validity of director Marek Kanievska's choice to bookend this film with an aging Everett attempting to explain his reason for being a traitor by using his boyhood school days as an analogy of life and love.  Was it necessary to convey the story by using a real historical figure as the narrator?  This initially gave me a false impression of what this film would be about.  I assumed it would be about his turn to Russia, while instead it focused on his love of Harcourt (a very floppy Cary Elwes) and disgust for hypocritical friends.  The use of the bookends felt like it gave the film a more authentic feel at first, but when they were revisited at the end, I felt slightly cheated and still confused.  Did the reporter get her story?  What story was she after?  Should ""Another Country"" have this many questions upon its conclusion?  Perhaps the play was better structured, but as a film adaptation, I must admit it fails.Leading us through the murkiness of ""Another Country"" are currently well respected actors in the British community.  Colin Firth plays the only strong character in this entire film, Tommy Judd.  His hatred for everything really exemplified my feelings about this film, which is why I connected to him the most.  He was the Salinger-esque character that was well defined, strong, and understandable.  The rest, well, the rest were as disappointing as this film.  Everett was as weak as a wet paper towel.  His character was unknown, attempting to be himself as well as a character, I kept seeing Everett be Everett - he was never Guy Bennett (Burgess - whatever!).  The bewilderment of where Madonna was kept me at bay, but the sure comic genius of the film was that of Cary Elwes playing someone who caught the attention of Everett - somehow.  Everett seems to attempt to play a smart, charismatic student that bends the rules and flaunts his homosexuality; Elwes is completely different - if one could even say that.  He is awkward, boring, and honestly, a nothing.  He is not a character, not Harcourt, not Elwes, nothing.  During a first time dinner where Everett attempts to pour out his story about his romantic death of his father, Elwes responds with a grunt of a ""No way"" or something along those trivial lines.  Elwes is reminiscent of a dog in this film, no real motive; he just follows Everett around pushing the plot into another dismal avenue.Overall, ""Another Country"" was a disappointment.  The lack of a focused direction, informative introduction, and defined characters sunk this film before it even had the opportunity to leave port.  The characters were abysmal.  A pre-Mr. Darcy Firth was fun to watch, but everyone else played themselves out of character, out of entertainment.  This was a film about so many ideas that no real idea was able to surface.  The onslaught of homosexuality was impressive to see in a film released in 1984, but midway through the feature it became clich&eacute;.  Having recently viewed Alan Bennett's ""The History Boys"" as well as read the play, it was tough to watch ""Another Country"" sink into the water.  Why couldn't there be teachers that understood, students that were less forceful with their homosexuality (perhaps just seeing it as the norm), and loves that broke the barriers, instead of jumping out of nowhere.  Being a Cannes Best Film nominee, I had high hopes for this film, but the lack of everything solid soured it immediately.  Kanievska's direction was more made-for-TV than worth of film.  ""Another Country"" was just another clich&eacute; British schoolboy film that went nowhere, gave us lucid characters, and confused us by being too smart than what it is.  Could not suggest it to anyone, nor would I!Grade: * out of *****",1,Another Country.  Another World.

829259,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0002ABUNY,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 2]","""Another Country"" is a powerful, beautiful movie that manages to discuss politics, religion and sexuality without being preachy. Rupert Everett (The Next Best Thing), is superb as Guy Bennett, who is struggling with his political and sexual leanings. Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)) is no longer Princess Buttercup's paramour, but James Harcourt, who triggers Guy's awakening. Colin Firth (A Single Man) is alluring as Tommy Judd, who pals around with his bust of Lenin, tries to look intellectual whenever he puts on his spectacles (a strange combination of nerd&sex; symbol, but it works), and whose relationship with his girlfriend may or may not be an act. Everett is honest in his dealings with his boarding school-think of it like the homoerotic hothouse of Dalton Academy onGlee: Season Two, while Judd is more enigmatic. Is Judd gay or straight? Or both? Is his Marxism an act? The ending leaves those questions unresolved.Everett confronts the class system. The political discussions are punctuated with beautiful scenery (apparently it was on the same set as the very heterosexualPride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)), steamy forbidden romance, handsome men, and beautiful music.

829260,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,B0002ABUNY,Charles S. Houser,"[28, 34]","This film is a fictional version of the beginnings of a group of real-life British traitors. As such, it speculates on the psychological motives of one privileged, public school educated man (played brilliantly by Rupert Everett). As a homosexual who was unwilling to pretend to be anything else, and as a student whose roommate happens to be a well-read Marxist, Everett's character, Guy, makes an easy leap to communism. This seems facile to me and an insult to both Marxists and homosexuals, but it's a trope I can accept for the sake of getting on with the story. (As the story progressed, I felt less concerned about whether the real-life spies were being fairly portrayed and just enjoyed the story as a piece of narrative fiction.)What I found most engaging and compelling about this film was its depiction of an elite and closed circle of society that most people never get to enter, but which is certainly emblematic of the way the larger world operates. Younger boys are exploited, older boys vie to be house masters and ""gods"" entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats. Rules are made to be bent and broken. Secrecy rules and the students hold council and administer discipline without ever seeming to consult the ""real"" authorities. And their fathers who sent them to this school, came up through the exact same system, and sent their sons there anyway. A colonial empire, it seems, is fueled by silence and sadism.The movie made me think of C.S. Lewis's memoire, SURPRISED BY JOY, in which he describes his own public school education. Although he was quite discreet, his depiction of the what boys in that situation go through was equally harrowing.Although most of the DVD extras are interesting, I found the audio commentary by the director and DP a little too focused on lighting and camera angles (i.e., dull!).

829261,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B0002ABUNY,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[6, 9]","I truly wanted to love this movie. The one thing it is definitely not short on is potential. The ending however is one of the sorriest I've ever witnessed and leaves way too many unanswered questions. Although it is in English, the accents are extremely heavy and hard to understand, which makes it difficult at best to keep up with the plot.In a shabby apartment in Moscow, an American journalist asks a retired spy why he betrayed his country and defected to Russia 50 years ago. The answers take them back to 1932, where in the closed atmosphere of a British Boy's School, young Guy Bennett (Rupert Everett) realizes his attraction for his classmates is more than a passing phase.There, in an environment permeated by desire and in the wake of a gay classmates suicide, Bennett falls desperately in love with a younger student, James Harcourt (Cary Elwes) and is introduced to marxism by Tommy Judd (Colin Firth), his most loyal friend.Rupert and Elwes shine in their performances and the rest of the cast of wonderful actors makes for a lot of eye candy. There is some male nudity, although not nearly enough and a tender romance is budding in the confines of secrecy that is a delight to watch. A beautiful setting helps make this film very enjoyable if you can understand what's going on. Other than the ending, and the thick dialogue, this is an enjoyable film. I do recommend it but I also recommend you keep expectations low, as not to be greatly disappointed. I cannot however recommend it as highly as I would have liked.

829263,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0002ABUNY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[12, 13]","Another Country, a film starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth (in their very early work), is set in the upper-class British society of the inter-war period. Its central idea is to demonstrate the difficulties of growing up even in the midst of privilege when one is different.  Everett plays Guy Bennett, an intelligent and popular student at a public school (in America, read private school) who doesn't seem to be growing out of `schoolboy tendencies' as are the others.  The film is done in a flashback sequence; Bennett is in his old age, reflecting back on the origins of the troubles in his life (as it turns out, Bennett is one of the several British intelligence agents who during the Cold War defected to the Soviet Union).  Bennett sees the problems starting in prep schools such as his (Eton is not specifically named, but heavily implied, particularly given the history of the real British intelligence defectors).  There is an inability for the culture around to face the truth, and the attempt by the school (instructors, alumni, and fellow students alike) to pressure all into a conformity that doesn't always fit.  Bennett wants to be openly gay; his friend Tommy Judd (Firth) wants to be a nonconformist Communist; their nemesis is not from the adult world, but rather the fellow student Fowler, who is in charge of the school's military brigade, and the one most keen on enforcing rules and mores.This is an interesting film for British audiences because it exposes an unspoken element to the class struggle by looking inside the upper class and seeing division as opposed to monolith and uniformity.  It is interesting for American audiences because it exposes a different world from the ones most Americans understand readily, but one not so far removed in terms of influence both politically and culturally.  Most interesting is the interplay of the cultural elements, sometimes explicitly critiqued by the character Tommy (who doesn't quite do the Shakespearean aside to the audience, but whose commentary is obviously tailored more for the viewing audience than for the other characters at times); most of the time, however, the cultural elements are assumed and understood as natural by the characters, causing viewers outside the British upper class (and some of those in it) to ponder just what is going on with all of these.One of the interesting things of the piece is that it is a questioning film, questioning the way society brings up its young, with the questioning being done by the young.  However, for young people the ending is unsettling - Guy Bennett is in a small Moscow flat, having defected to the Soviet Union with intelligence secrets, effectively betraying his culture and nation; we discover that Tommy died in the Spanish Civil War fighting against Franco, and many of the other high-flyers in school end up as lack-luster and disappointing figures (even the one who makes it being a Cabinet minister somehow lacks the image of success - when one is trained from birth to take the highest office, is it really much of an achievement to attain it?).It is a rather slow-moving film in terms of camera shots, and a rather conservative film in terms of cast and action (there are no car chases, no bloody violence, no sex other than hints and suggestions, etc.).  It is one that has never made much of an impact on American audiences, and the British audiences who enjoyed the film were predominantly an older crowd.The issues of metaphor, iconic imagery and modern society's method of making sense of imagery abound here.  In particular, there is Baudrillard's idea of simulation - in a sense, the film Another Country is a simulation of a simulation: the film itself is a simulation of a sort, and the characters and school environment depicted are also a simulation of certain relationships and aspects that the world should, in the eyes of the community at large, take on even if it never really achieves the fullness (and indeed, would be unlikely to like the results if it should).  This taps into the concept of hegemony drawn from critical analysis thinkers such as Gramsci and Williams.The world in the film Another Country no longer exists.  Of course, the world in Another Country never really existed, but was a cultural construct for the particular class.

829264,AEVS7RZ667VH4,B0002ABUNY,Geoff Oldham,"[2, 2]","This movie is based on a play by Julian Mitchell [who went on to write the screenplays for Vincent & Theo and the wonderful Wilde], loosely based on the life of Guy Burgess, who became a Russian spy, and defected to Russia in 1951. He was a member of the ""Cambridge Spy Ring,"" four former Cambridge students [including Anthony Blunt and Kim Philby] who became spies for the KGB. Three of the four were homosexual.This entire spy background would be easy to miss entirely if you didn't already know about it, but it adds a great deal to the meaning of the movie. The movie begins in 1983 Moscow with Rupert Everett in old age makeup playing the elder Guy Bennett being interviewed by a British reporter. The majority of the movie is an extended flashback to an unnamed boys' college in the 30s.It would seem that homosexuality at the college is rampant, and tacitly accepted, so long as it does not become known. Toward the beginning of the movie, a boy is discovered humping another boy--and ends up hanging himself rather than face expulsion, and the disapproval of his parents. This leads to a renewed crack-down on homosexuality at the school, though the students don't want to stop, and it is widely known that pretty much every student engages in it. It is accepted as just `part of what boys do,' but the students are expected to give it up and marry a woman upon graduation. What's more, none of these boys are considered truly homosexual, this is just a phase they're going through.Rupert's Guy becomes aware of the blond Harcourt [Elwes], and pretty much becomes obsessed with him. He is much more forthright with his attraction than any of the other students dare to be, which he plays off through a disdain of the other students and an extremely high queenly attitude. Soon enough he and Harcourt are laying in each other's arms and [presumably] having sex. At this point Guy begins really pushing the system, for example waving in an extremely obvious fashion to Harcourt across the yard, which Harcourt just ignores. Guy seems to be enraged at having to engage in the hypocrisy of pretending like nothing is going on between the boys, when everyone knows perfectly well that it is. He is furious at being punished for merely acknowledging what everyone knows is a fact. He is also highly steeped in the communist beliefs of his friend Judd [Firth], and both of these will combine to strongly foreshadow his conversion to KGB spy after the close of the film.SPOILERS>>> Toward the end there is a long struggle for power and position at the school. At first Guy is unaffected, as he threatens to expose the homosexual activities of the other students if they dare act against him. But in the end, concrete evidence of his homosexuality is procured and submitted to the headmasters, thus rendering him unable to be promoted to the next ranking in the school's caste. One is left to surmise that the harsh punishment meted out for being unable to play along with the hypocrisy of the system, as well as his immersion in the communist beliefs of his roommate, crystallized into a contempt for his own country which led directly to his ultimate decision to become a Russian spy. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILERS END.Rupert Everett is very good. He plays an obnoxious, narcissistic mama's boy, which may lead some viewers [like myself] to not particularly sympathize with him, but this in fact works in favor of the issues the movie is trying to raise. Since I didn't particularly LIKE Guy, I was further forced to examine what the issues of his speaking up or hiding his homosexuality raised, apart from my feelings for him as a person, and what punishment he deserved or did not deserve--ultimately deciding that, obnoxious prat that he was, he didn't deserve what happened to him. This successfully delineates the issue into what degree it is right to expect someone to hide or to expose their homosexuality.I suspect, however, that the majority of viewers WILL be attracted to Rupert, and will thus have a different experience, much more sympathetic to his side of the story. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this--if Guy had been played by Sam Elliott, I'm sure I would have been all glassy-eyed sympathy. And by the way, they're not really my type, but if you're into pretty, clean-cut young British men, this film will basically make you cum in your pants.The most notable film by this director was the hideous adaptation of Less Than Zero, but his direction here is very good. The film begins with a gorgeous and spooky shot traveling under the arch of a bridge over a glassy lake, and throughout one notices interesting geometrical compositions to the shots. Colin Firth is very good, but unfortunately [as became greatly apparent soon after] Cary Elwes can't portray much beyond ""dewy.""Anyway, one of the better movies with homosexuality as its theme, as, in addition to being engaging and compelling, it quite successfully draws attention to a central conflict that is expertly dramatized in this situation, and has resonance for gay people

It isn't necessary. There's no real communist intrigue in the film except for Colin Firth's character. And even that character's existence and subsequent interaction with Everett's character never really bolster the need to bookend the movie with the communist angle.This is a film about two young men in the British school system who inadvertantly fall in love with each other when they know darn good and well that they call ill afford to be discovered.Does it matter that Burgess (played by Everett) went on to become a spy? Sure. Is it something that is brought out in the film's central (or even minor) plot? No. Leave it out! You've still got a dynamite romance.Everett in what was almost his first film appearance, and Cary Elwes in his first film role strike an unbelievably romantic pose together.

829266,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002ABUNY,Grady Harp,"[69, 73]","In 1983 Julian Mitchell wrote a play based on fact about a young man (Guy Bennett) who, seeing the constraints of British society circa 1930, embraces his sexuality in a time when even the words were criminal, sees through the sad folly of the British class and empire system, and eventually abandons England to become a spy for Russia.  The played starred a young 21-year-old Rupert Everett and a 20-year-old Kenneth Branagh as Guy's heterosexual roommate Tommy Judd, an obsessed Marxist as ready to leap out of the norm of British society as Guy - but for different reasons.  Director Marek Kanievska adapted Mitchell's challenging play for the screen, and in 1984 ANOTHER COUNTRY became a sterling recreation of the play and a controversial film introducing the extraordinarily talented and continuingly popular Rupert Everett (who remains one of the few 'out' actors enjoying success in Hollywood).  Colin Firth assumed the role of Tommy and Cary Elwes became the gay love interest for Everett's Guy Bennett.  The film is one of the finest examinations of the rigid, archaically proper British schools for young men (Eton) where class is paramount in importance, rank reigns, and medieval views of sexuality and out of line thought are treated with public corporal punishment and (worst of all!) the inability to rise in the ranks of the 'important' lads.  Throughout the film there is a powerful parallel between Guy's striving to become the head of the class being thwarted by his pursuing is passion for his love of men, and the 'religious zeal' approach of Tommy's absorption in Marxism, seeing Communism as the only way to correct the 'vile sickness' of current British politics and social strata.  The undercurrents of bigotry are brought into focus when a fine young lad (Martineau) is caught in a sexual act with one of his classmates and is shamed into hanging himself.  And when Guy's sexual tryst with James Harcourt is 'discovered', Guy is beaten in front of his compatriots, prompting him to see (with Tommy in agreement) the dead-end of British society and leave the remnants of a once glorious empire behind.As a delightful Special Feature on this very well made DVD there is a scene from the stage production in the year prior to the film, and the dialogue between Rupert Everett and Kenneth Branagh is incisive and brilliant.  This film is a masterpiece, not only in the screenplay, but also in the sensitive direction, the exquisite cinematography, and the amazingly superb acting of not only Everett and Firth, but of the entire large cast.

This movie tried to say that gays were oppressed, that communism is a better choice than capitalism, and tat anyone who was against these two idealogies was evil and ""mean"" (sound familiar? sound like a theme of 2009,2010,and 2011???). Anyway, how did the old guy hear the two all the way down that hallway behind that door in the boiler room? he didn't/couldn't. But the bad set up to this ""victim"" movie had to start someway. Anyway the premise here is that gays just want to date and lay around in boats day dreaming while holding one another and that the repression of society forces them to have ""relationships"" with their trousers down in dark basement rooms indiscriminately. They have to sneak out of their rooms and avoid the nazi guards at the all boys school to do it too. There is a sub-theme of if you are for order, working hard, tradition, discipline you are a oppressive monster. I have no idea where the people who wrote this stuff dreamed up their communist Russia but from what I have read and heard gays didn't flee to the Soviet Union to live in a society that allowed them to ""express themselves"". And what really worked against the propaganda in this movie was that the main gay character had 'been' with countless other school boys on that campus and even blackmailed the leadership to get out of trouble. So how repressive could this place be? He would even sit at the window and lust after other male students. So it was so silly. The themes here are what you hear today in 2011 for both gay rights and communism/socialism. THe only interesting thing about this movie was that some of the actors are now well known so you get to see them when they were much younger . . . just starting out acting. You see Colin Firth . . . who looked like and sounded like a squeaky mouse. You saw Rupert Evert pre-face lift distortion days. I looked a few of the others up to see who they might be as the two I just mentioned have physically changes so much I didn't really know they were themselves.

'Another country' allows one the opportunity to bathe and flutter in all the glory of one's youth and youthful expectations. The film is not so much about straight vs. gay but, rather, about the traditionalist/conformist vs. the out of the box thinking of 'commies and queers'. It clearly draws the line between those who desire to march to the music of the masses, those who love to cloak themselves in mindless ritual and tradition, honors and awards, the applause and approval of those who can best serve their endless, though limited, ambitions and expectations vs. those who see the utter waste and stupidity and vulgarity of being part of the herd, those who think and question and act with an understanding beyond the politics and drama of the 'norm'.'Another Country' holds up twenty years later. Rupert Everett embodies the grace of the upper class, the intelligence of the radical, and the poetry of the true romantic. 'Another Country' is filmed in the English tradition of good taste and endless esthetics, in the same way as ""A Room With A View,' 'Maurice,' and 'Passage To India'. Idealism and romance are not the stuff of reality, but of the heart and mind and soul. It is important to be warmed and inspired and desired within the universe of the self, and 'Another Country' does that for me.
