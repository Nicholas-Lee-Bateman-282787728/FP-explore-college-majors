1623851,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00BB67UNW,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The late Massachusetts Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tip O&#8217;Neil, was always fond of saying that all politics was local, meaning, perhaps, that the great struggling issues of the day did not mean a thing if some constituent&#8217;s potholed street was not paved. The truth of that proposition, if it ever was true, has certainly been eclipsed on the national and international levels by the huge increase in media technology&#8217;s ability to create messages and sway opinions. The one place that Tip statement may still retain some validity is, well, at the local level, at the level of city politics. And that premise was on display in the film under review, Broken City, although one could argue that the city involved, New York City, as an international city would conform to that latter statement.So be it, though the story line of this film pits an old-time machine up from the ward- heeler ranks to the mayor&#8217;s office politician played by Russell Crowe. His honor though is up for a tough reelection campaign against the inevitable clay-footed liberal reformer. So every trick in the urban politician&#8217;s handbook comes into play. That and a little murder, mayhem, and dirty tricks. Just like the doctor ordered. Except this film is billed as a suspense film and so the plotline has to be developed a little.His Honor finds that he needs to purchase the services of an ex-cop, rogue cop, (played by Mark Wahlberg) who after being pushed off the force became a private operative with a specialty in keyhole peeping. Seems that, on the surface anyway, the Mayor was trying to find out about who his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was having an affair with behind his back and thus placing him in an awkward political position with Election Day right around the corner. And so our key-hole peeper does his work, does it well, except a guy, the supposed lover who also is the campaign manager for that reform candidate eating into the Mayor&#8217;s gravy train is murdered right in front of his house, an obvious political &#8220;hit&#8221; job.Of course that event turned things on their heads since our key-hole peeper was set-up by the Mayor to be the fall guy, and/or patsy to the real grift, a huge pot of gold for the Mayor and his cronies with the turning of a low-rent neighborhood into a high- rise city skyline playground for the Mayfair swells. Despite the reform candidate, despite the ordered murder, despite the graft and corruption come Election Day the Mayor wins. Except in the background our hero private operative gets the goods on the Mayor&#8217;s deal, fills in the dots, and His Honor is finally led off to his just desserts. Yeah, you know Tip might have been right even, maybe especially about New Jack City, follow the money, all politics is local on that score.",3,All Politics Is Local,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,2831,"['late', 'Massachusetts', 'Democratic', 'Speaker', 'U.S.', 'House', 'Representatives', 'Tip', 'O', '8217', 'Neil', 'was', 'always', 'fond', 'saying', 'politics', 'was', 'local', 'meaning', 'perhaps', 'great', 'struggling', 'issues', 'day', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'thing', 'constituent', '8217', 'potholed', 'street', 'was', 'not', 'paved', 'truth', 'proposition', 'ever', 'was', 'true', 'certainly', 'been', 'eclipsed', 'national', 'international', 'levels', 'huge', 'increase', 'media', 'technology', '8217', 'ability', 'create', 'messages', 'sway', 'opinions', 'one', 'place', 'Tip', 'statement', 'may', 'still', 'retain', 'validity', 'well', 'local', 'level', 'level', 'city', 'politics', 'premise', 'was', 'display', 'film', 'review', 'Broken', 'City', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'city', 'involved', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'international', 'city', 'would', 'conform', 'latter', 'statement.So', 'be', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'old-time', 'machine', 'ward-', 'heeler', 'ranks', 'mayor', '8217', 's', 'office', 'politician', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'honor', 'though', 'up', 'tough', 'reelection', 'campaign', 'inevitable', 'clay-footed', 'liberal', 'reformer', 'trick', 'urban', 'politician', '8217', 'handbook', 'play', 'little', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'Just', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'film', 'billed', 'suspense', 'film', 'so', 'plotline', 'be', 'developed', 'little.His', 'Honor', 'purchase', 'services', 'ex-cop', 'rogue', 'cop', 'played', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'being', 'pushed', 'off', 'force', 'became', 'private', 'operative', 'specialty', 'keyhole', 'peeping', 'surface', 'anyway', 'Mayor', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'back', 'thus', 'placing', 'awkward', 'political', 'position', 'Election', 'Day', 'right', 'corner', 'so', 'key-hole', 'peeper', 'work', 'well', 'guy', 'supposed', 'lover', 'who', 'also', 'campaign', 'manager', 'reform', 'candidate', 'eating', 'Mayor', '8217', 'gravy', 'train', 'murdered', 'right', 'front', 'house', 'obvious', 'political', '8220', 'hit', '8221', 'course', 'event', 'turned', 'things', 'heads', 'key-hole', 'peeper', 'was', 'set-up', 'Mayor', 'be', 'fall', 'guy', 'and/or', 'patsy', 'real', 'grift', 'huge', 'pot', 'gold', 'Mayor', 'cronies', 'turning', 'low-rent', 'neighborhood', 'high-', 'rise', 'city', 'skyline', 'playground', 'Mayfair', 'swells', 'reform', 'candidate', 'ordered', 'murder', 'graft', 'corruption', 'come', 'Election', 'Day', 'Mayor', 'wins', 'background', 'hero', 'private', 'operative', 'goods', 'Mayor', '8217', 's', 'deal', 'fills', 'dots', 'Honor', 'finally', 'led', 'off', 'just', 'desserts', 'Yeah', 'know', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'even', 'maybe', 'especially', 'New', 'Jack', 'City', 'follow', 'money', 'politics', 'local', 'score']",N/A

1623856,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BB67UNW,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Mark Wahlberg is one of those actors who have a career that feels smaller than it is, mainly because all of his film roles run together.  Whether he's playing another cop, or another criminal gone good, or another arrogant Bostonian, Wahlberg seems to regurgitate the same character over and over again, film to film.  The sad thing is that, for the most part, he chooses a slew of forgettable films to grace his familiar shtick with.To tell you the truth, `Broken City' is no different.Directed by Allen Hughes, one of the Hughes Brothers who made a name for themselves back in the early 90's, `Broken City' is your standard `bad cop gone good caught in a web of lies told by even badder (I know that's not a word) men in higher places' type stories; you know, the kind that Marky Mark has made a thousand times before (or so it would seem).  In this film you have him sparring off against Russell Crowe, who plays the mayor of New York who hires former cop Wahlberg to spy on his wife, who he claims is having an affair.  If you saw the trailers for the film then you basically know the whole story already.  Zeta-Jones (the wife) isn't really having an affair, but that is just a cover story told by Crowe, who is the real bad guy here.Don't you hate it when trailers give away the whole plot?  This is one of those situations where I actually feel like the film itself may have been a better experience had the trailer left it at `Crowe thinks Zeta-Jones is having an affair' and cut out all the `but it's obvious that Wahlberg is being strung along and don't miss this shot of Crowe giving the camera a look that spells out the fact that he is a deceitful villain'.  I hate obviousness, and trailers cut like that take all the fun out of a film, especially since Crowe really doesn't play his part too obviously and actually strings us along rather well for the first half of the film.I don't know what happened to Allen Hughes.  I mean, `Menace II Society' was one of those films that took me by complete surprise and wound up being one of the highlights of the 90's for me.  This just feels so pedestrian.  There is no spark here.  Nothing is thrilling and all of the high tension moments feel ripped from other films.  How many times is there going to be a late night car chase by the river?  Seriously?  I've seen that scene before, done much better in another Russell Crowe film.  Sadly, everything about this film feels borrowed and because of that I can't recommend it at all.  It is not a bad film, it just is so forgettable.  Even the political aspect of the film felt so apathetic.  At the end of it all there is nothing to care about here.The acting is decent.  Wahlberg does what he does, which is the same thing he did in the last movie but we're used to it.  He is not a bad actor, he just has no range.  Zeta-Jones does nothing and pretty much could have been played by any actress.  Crowe is in fine form, but the character is such an empty shell that I wish he would have walked away from the film altogether.  He completely devours Wahlberg in their verbal sparring scenes, especially in the final one, but even that isn't enough to save the film.  The highlight here is easily Kyle Chandler, who makes so much out of a very small role.  His few scenes are the best in the film, and the naturalness is lends to his every word (that train scene is magnificent) makes for a very flowing presence.  I wanted to see more of him, but I really wouldn't have wanted him to play any other role than the one he played, since it was the best in the film.I wish I could give this a higher grade, but a D is really all I can muster.",2,Broken expectations...,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,3643,"['Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'career', 'smaller', 'mainly', 'film', 'roles', 'run', 'together', 'playing', 'cop', 'criminal', 'gone', 'good', 'arrogant', 'Bostonian', 'Wahlberg', 'regurgitate', 'same', 'character', 'over', 'again', 'film', 'film', 'sad', 'thing', 'most', 'part', 'slew', 'forgettable', 'films', 'grace', 'familiar', 'shtick', 'with.To', 'tell', 'truth', 'Broken', 'City', 'different.Directed', 'Allen', 'Hughes', 'one', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'who', 'made', 'name', 'back', 'early', '90', 'Broken', 'City', 'standard', 'bad', 'cop', 'gone', 'good', 'caught', 'web', 'lies', 'told', 'even', 'badder', 'know', 'not', 'word', 'men', 'higher', 'places', 'type', 'stories', 'know', 'kind', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'made', 'thousand', 'times', 'would', 'seem', 'film', 'have', 'sparring', 'off', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'mayor', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'former', 'cop', 'Wahlberg', 'spy', 'wife', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'saw', 'trailers', 'film', 'then', 'basically', 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'already', 'Zeta-Jones', 'wife', ""n't"", 'really', 'having', 'affair', 'just', 'cover', 'story', 'told', 'Crowe', 'who', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'here.Do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'when', 'trailers', 'give', 'away', 'whole', 'plot', 'one', 'situations', 'where', 'actually', 'feel', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'experience', 'had', 'trailer', 'left', 'Crowe', 'thinks', 'Zeta-Jones', 'having', 'affair', 'cut', 'out', 'obvious', 'Wahlberg', 'being', 'strung', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'shot', 'Crowe', 'giving', 'camera', 'look', 'out', 'fact', 'deceitful', 'villain', 'hate', 'obviousness', 'trailers', 'cut', 'take', 'fun', 'film', 'especially', 'Crowe', 'really', ""n't"", 'play', 'part', 'too', 'obviously', 'actually', 'strings', 'rather', 'well', 'first', 'half', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Allen', 'Hughes', 'mean', 'Menace', 'II', 'Society', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'took', 'complete', 'surprise', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'highlights', '90', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'pedestrian', 'spark', 'here', 'Nothing', 'thrilling', 'high', 'tension', 'moments', 'feel', 'ripped', 'other', 'films', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'there', 'going', 'be', 'late', 'night', 'car', 'chase', 'river', 'Seriously', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'scene', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'film', 'Sadly', 'everything', 'film', 'borrowed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'forgettable', 'Even', 'political', 'aspect', 'film', 'felt', 'so', 'apathetic', 'end', 'nothing', 'care', 'here.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'Wahlberg', 'what', 'same', 'thing', 'did', 'last', 'movie', ""'re"", 'used', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'just', 'range', 'Zeta-Jones', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'actress', 'Crowe', 'fine', 'form', 'character', 'such', 'empty', 'shell', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'film', 'altogether', 'completely', 'Wahlberg', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'scenes', 'especially', 'final', 'one', 'even', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'highlight', 'here', 'easily', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'film', 'naturalness', 'word', 'train', 'scene', 'magnificent', 'very', 'flowing', 'presence', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wanted', 'play', 'other', 'role', 'one', 'played', 'was', 'best', 'film.I', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'higher', 'grade', 'D', 'really', 'can', 'muster']",N/A

1623868,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B00BB67UNW,Brian Maitland,"[0, 0]","The impressive cast of name actors Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mark Wahlberg, Barry Pepper and Kyle Chandler is what drew me in to checking out this movie on DVD. The story will grip you as it's a tale of political corruption but all the characters are not quiet what they appear to be which makes it all the more appealing.The look, as explained on the excellent 30+ DVD extra is that classic film noir only on color stock. This to me gave it a far more grittier '70s feel to the setting of New York City. It works in many scenes especially the bar scenes. I didn't think it worked so much in others and I can't really put a finger on why.That's the thing. This movie could have been great. Don't get me wrong it's very good but it's not a classic by any stretch. In a strange way I actually found two lesser female characters much more interesting than the leads. Walhberg's secretary/assistant played by Alona Tal was that sassy ""broad"" you see in the old film noirs but updated and came across as a real strong female presence in Wahlberg's life now as a private detective.The other is Wahlberg's girlfriend in the movie played by Natalie Martinez nailed her part but she's gone halfway through the movie (no, she doesn't die so I haven't spoiled much).The whole movie just seemed slightly off kilter and not in a good way.

Truth be told, I wish I'd spent just the ten bucks in the theaters nstead of buying the movie for 15.I went into this movie really wanting to like it, really believing that I would.  Is ""Broken City"" a bad movie? No?  But it's not a particularly good movie, either.  That's really the major problem.  There's absolutely nothing about the movie that differentiates itself from the hundreds of other movies just like it: crime dramas with a twist ending, someone gets double-crossed by someone they thought they could trust, one person thinks they hold the cards only to find out someone else is holding an even better hand.  It's a plot device that we see at least ten times a year in the theaters. And ""Broken City"" doesn't even feature any outstanding performances to make up for the over-used plot devices.Heck, even if the movie were spectacularly bad, at least it would provide something worthy of conversation.  But all it is is just an OK popcorn flick...nothing more, nothing less.  Something to rent and pass a Saturday morning with.

As written by Brian Tucker and directed by Allen Hughes this film comes off as a bit disjointed with some very confusing story developments that are so mumbled by the cast that subtitles might be necessary to stay involved.  But do we want to be involved in a story where every character is crooked? Usually there is at least one redeeming force that makes the light shining on all the evil around seem justified, but not here: everyone involved is essentially a bad guy.NYPD detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is arrested for the murder of Mikey Tavarez, who raped and murdered the sixteen-year-old sister of Taggart's girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez). His friend, Captain Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) asks Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) for help, and Hostetler eliminates the evidence against Taggart. Tavarez's death is ruled as self-defense, and Taggart is forced to leave the police. Seven years later, Taggart is a private detective on the verge of bankruptcy when he's hired by Hostetler to find out who his wife Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair with. Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw (Alona Ta, the one bright light in the film), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), the campaign manager of Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). But even that is a sham and a mistake that drives everyone into even deeper depths of evil.  Even our given hero Billy Taggart returns of his alcohol abuse and despite his efforts to make things right meets all manner of surprise changes that simply don't hang together.The cast of fine actors do the best they can with this creaky story and in addition to the stars mentioned, the smaller roles are well filled by Michael Beach, James Ransome and Griffin Dunne. The film is dark, tosses in the usual car chases, and in general entertains but leaves a bitter aftertaste about American politics.

Is she or isn't she faithful?* Kyle Chandler (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is Paul, a political operative who is, believe it or not, the most decent guy in the whole movie.* Alona Tal (Lots of TV) is Katy, Billy's Girl Friday in his private detective business. She's sweet and resourceful.Expect gunshots, fisticuffs, vehicular mayhem and LOTS of talk, which, I was surprised to note, includes very little profanity. The R rating seems to be due to the violence of some of those fist fights.

1623941,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BB67UNW,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Broken City, for me, is one of those films that knows where it wants to go, but the execution is underwhelming. You have big names Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe together in a political cop-drama and that should be a recipe for success, but somewhere along the line things fell out of place and what we're left with is Broken City. A film that attempts to be more complex than it needs to be and, ultimately, more complex than it can handle.Broken City starts with NYPD detective Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) killing Mikey Tavarez, a man accused of raping and killing the sixteen year old sister of Billy's girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez). After getting arrested and going to court, the verdict was that Billy killed Mikey in self-defense so he couldn't be charged with manslaughter. However, he was forced to quit the force.Seven years later we find a near-bankrupt Billy who's now a private detective. Then one day he gets a call from Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Crowe) who was responsible for getting rid of Billy's convicting evidence seven years ago. Hostetler is convinced that his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair, so he wants Billy to find out who she's seeing behind his back. Billy finds out that she's seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler). Andrews is the campaign manager for Hostetler's election rival Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), a man who's doing everything in his power to prove that Hostetler is as crooked as they come.Now I'll stop it there, but judging from that brief summary it's safe to say that this sounds like a pretty entertaining movie, right? Maybe a little clich&eacute;d, but one that could still be enjoyable if done right. Unfortunately that's not the case because as soon as we find out that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews the entire thing gets out of control and before you know it everyone and their mother is involved in some convoluted scheme to bring down Hostetler. If you ask me the movie derails about halfway through because once you reach that 50 minute mark that's when it started to get bad.What turned me off even more is that there's not one interesting character in here. Scratch that, I loved Billy's assistant Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal). Unfortunately, her role is as minor as they come so it's not like she has enough time to save this train wreck. Billy struck me as an annoying ass who didn't know how to handle things like an adult and Hostetler was your cookie-cutter crooked politician. There's just an extreme lack of creativity in the character department because it feels like we've seen all these characters before in other films of this genre.Honestly, the only positive thing I can say about the film is that everyone involved did solid job. Wahlberg gave another Wahlberg performance. So if you're not a fan of his don't expect to have your opinion swayed with this film. Zeta-Jones gave a nice performance, but she doesn't get a lot of screen time. Crowe gave an enjoyable performance as well, but was crippled by the generic-ness of his character. This was my first time seeing Alona Tal in a film, but I really liked what I saw. Then again, I think part of that had to do with the fact that she was the only cast member with an interesting character.Overall Score: 4.5/10 - My biggest problem with this film is that it lacks anything unique. We've seen these scenarios before and almost all of them have been done better. Then it suffers from a second half that lacks any sort of cohesiveness which makes it feel like a punishment to get through the entire thing. I would have a hard time recommending this to anyone, but if you're really itching to see it I would suggest a rental or Netflix if they have it.",2,4.5/10 - Uninspired,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,3756,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Broken', 'City', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'go', 'execution', 'underwhelming', 'have', 'big', 'names', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'together', 'political', 'cop-drama', 'should', 'be', 'recipe', 'success', 'somewhere', 'line', 'things', 'fell', 'place', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'Broken', 'City', 'A', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'be', 'ultimately', 'more', 'complex', 'can', 'handle.Broken', 'City', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'Billy', 'Taggart', 'Wahlberg', 'killing', 'Mikey', 'Tavarez', 'man', 'accused', 'raping', 'killing', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'Billy', 'girlfriend', 'Natalie', 'Barrow', 'Natalie', 'Martinez', 'getting', 'arrested', 'going', 'court', 'verdict', 'was', 'Billy', 'killed', 'Mikey', 'self-defense', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'charged', 'manslaughter', 'However', 'was', 'forced', 'quit', 'force.Seven', 'years', 'later', 'find', 'near-bankrupt', 'Billy', 'who', 'now', 'private', 'detective', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'call', 'Mayor', 'Nicholas', 'Hostetler', 'Crowe', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'getting', 'rid', 'Billy', 'convicting', 'evidence', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'Hostetler', 'convinced', 'wife', 'Cathleen', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'having', 'affair', 'Billy', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'seeing', 'back', 'Billy', 'out', 'seeing', 'Paul', 'Andrews', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Andrews', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Hostetler', 'election', 'rival', 'Jack', 'Valliant', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'man', 'who', 'doing', 'everything', 'power', 'prove', 'Hostetler', 'as', 'crooked', 'come.Now', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there', 'judging', 'brief', 'summary', 'safe', 'say', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'right', 'Maybe', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'done', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'as', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Cathleen', 'seeing', 'Paul', 'Andrews', 'entire', 'thing', 'control', 'know', 'everyone', 'mother', 'involved', 'convoluted', 'scheme', 'bring', 'down', 'Hostetler', 'ask', 'movie', 'halfway', 'reach', '50', 'minute', 'mark', 'when', 'started', 'get', 'bad.What', 'turned', 'even', 'more', 'not', 'one', 'interesting', 'character', 'here', 'Scratch', 'loved', 'Billy', 'assistant', 'Katy', 'Bradshaw', 'Alona', 'Tal', 'Unfortunately', 'role', 'as', 'minor', 'come', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'save', 'train', 'wreck', 'Billy', 'struck', 'annoying', 'ass', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'things', 'adult', 'Hostetler', 'was', 'cookie-cutter', 'crooked', 'politician', 'just', 'extreme', 'lack', 'creativity', 'character', 'department', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'other', 'films', 'genre.Honestly', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'everyone', 'involved', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'Wahlberg', 'gave', 'Wahlberg', 'performance', 'So', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'have', 'opinion', 'swayed', 'film', 'Zeta-Jones', 'gave', 'nice', 'performance', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'Crowe', 'gave', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'crippled', 'generic-ness', 'character', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'Alona', 'Tal', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'Then', 'again', 'think', 'part', 'had', 'do', 'fact', 'was', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'interesting', 'character.Overall', 'Score', '4.5/10', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'anything', 'unique', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'scenarios', 'almost', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'Then', 'second', 'half', 'sort', 'cohesiveness', 'feel', 'punishment', 'get', 'entire', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'recommending', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'really', 'itching', 'see', 'would', 'suggest', 'rental', 'Netflix', 'have']",N/A

1623965,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BB67UNW,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I've become a fan of Mark Wahlberg over the years. It's fantastic that many have finally gotten past the whole Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch persona that could have been a career ender when it came to acting. The truth is that Wahlberg has shown he has the chops to perform in a dramatic role and make it truly believable. So going into BROKEN CITY I had high hopes.The movie takes place in New York and opens with Wahlberg as Billy Taggert, a police detective who finds himself in the center of controversy after gunning down a supposed rapist in project area known as Bolton Village. While asked to step down by his superior Taggert is praised by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe). Even though he leaves the force, the mayor makes sure to let him know he'll keep an eye out for him.Fast forward seven years later and Taggert is now a private eye with a ton of bills and clients who more often ask for leniency than pay their debt to him. Then one day he gets a call from the mayor to come see him. Hostetler hires Taggert to follow his wife and get any information on her that he can. Is she cheating on him or is something else going on? The mayor isn't saying but Taggert can't refuse the money he's paying him and begins surveillance.But that surveillance leads to something else going on that is far beyond a simple fling for the mayor's wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The man she meets is tied into the mayoral campaign of Hostetler's main opponent. When that same man is murdered after Taggert passes along the information to Hostetler the entire concept of the film changes from a simple wife having an affair to the complications that go on in an election year.Along the way we are shown that Taggert has been dating the sister of the woman who was raped by the man he killed in the movie's opening. But things don't go well with the two of them and that portion of the film seems wasted. Another reference to the past isn't though as the mayor holds something over Taggert's head, a piece of hidden evidence that he is using to force Taggert to stick with his plans and follow instructions. Only an honest man could find a way to cut through this and take on the most powerful man in New York.The cut throat world of behind the scenes back stabbing and manipulation take the forefront in this story and Taggert's decision to either go with the flow or stand up for what is right are found at center stage before the film ends. With so much on the line and with the murder of an innocent man resting on his conscious just what he will do is pretty much a given but then some movies have taken the opposite direction you expect.So with all this star power as well as the direction of Allen Hughes, half of the brother duo behind hits like THE BOOK OF ELI and FROM HELL, why is it that this movie didn't pull me in and hold me there? Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining film that delivers the goods, but it just doesn't have that oomph feeling that one would expect with the pedigree involved.Both Wahlberg and Crowe seem to be walking through their roles without putting something new into them. These characters as portrayed by these actors feel like we've seen them before. Nothing new is added. Sure they do a great job but as a viewer I expect more from an actor than simply sleep walking through a role. Zeta-Jones is wasted in a part that offers her little. That could be a blessing seeing what the others did with their parts.The movie also has a predictable feel to it, like we know what's coming long before the characters involved do. That may be because films with a story like this have been done before and this one adds little to make it different than the rest. As I stated earlier, this doesn't make it a bad film, it just makes it feel like been there, done that. For Wahlberg and Crowe fans you won't be disappointed. For the rest go in with low expectations and the movie will no doubt satisfy.",3,CORRUPTION NEW YORK STYLE,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,3934,"[""'ve"", 'become', 'fan', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'years', 'fantastic', 'many', 'have', 'finally', 'gotten', 'whole', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'Funky', 'Bunch', 'persona', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'career', 'ender', 'when', 'came', 'acting', 'truth', 'Wahlberg', 'shown', 'chops', 'perform', 'dramatic', 'role', 'make', 'truly', 'believable', 'So', 'going', 'BROKEN', 'CITY', 'had', 'high', 'hopes.The', 'movie', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'Wahlberg', 'Billy', 'Taggert', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'center', 'controversy', 'gunning', 'down', 'supposed', 'rapist', 'project', 'area', 'known', 'Bolton', 'Village', 'asked', 'step', 'down', 'superior', 'Taggert', 'praised', 'Mayor', 'Hostetler', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Even', 'force', 'mayor', 'sure', 'let', 'know', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'him.Fast', 'forward', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'Taggert', 'now', 'private', 'eye', 'ton', 'bills', 'clients', 'who', 'more', 'often', 'ask', 'leniency', 'pay', 'debt', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'call', 'mayor', 'come', 'see', 'Hostetler', 'Taggert', 'follow', 'wife', 'get', 'information', 'can', 'Is', 'cheating', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'mayor', ""n't"", 'saying', 'Taggert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'money', 'paying', 'surveillance.But', 'surveillance', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'far', 'simple', 'fling', 'mayor', 'wife', 'Cathleen', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'man', 'tied', 'mayoral', 'campaign', 'Hostetler', 'main', 'opponent', 'When', 'same', 'man', 'murdered', 'Taggert', 'information', 'Hostetler', 'entire', 'concept', 'film', 'changes', 'simple', 'wife', 'having', 'affair', 'complications', 'go', 'election', 'way', 'are', 'shown', 'Taggert', 'been', 'dating', 'sister', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'raped', 'man', 'killed', 'movie', 'opening', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'two', 'portion', 'film', 'wasted', 'reference', 'past', ""n't"", 'mayor', 'something', 'Taggert', 'head', 'piece', 'hidden', 'evidence', 'using', 'force', 'Taggert', 'stick', 'plans', 'follow', 'instructions', 'Only', 'honest', 'man', 'could', 'find', 'way', 'cut', 'take', 'most', 'powerful', 'man', 'New', 'York.The', 'cut', 'throat', 'world', 'scenes', 'back', 'stabbing', 'manipulation', 'take', 'forefront', 'story', 'Taggert', 'decision', 'go', 'flow', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'are', 'found', 'center', 'stage', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'line', 'murder', 'innocent', 'man', 'resting', 'conscious', 'just', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'then', 'movies', 'have', 'taken', 'opposite', 'direction', 'expect.So', 'star', 'power', 'as', 'well', 'direction', 'Allen', 'Hughes', 'half', 'brother', 'duo', 'hits', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'ELI', 'FROM', 'HELL', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'hold', 'there', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'entertaining', 'film', 'goods', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'oomph', 'feeling', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'pedigree', 'involved.Both', 'Wahlberg', 'Crowe', 'seem', 'be', 'walking', 'roles', 'putting', 'something', 'new', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'actors', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Nothing', 'new', 'added', 'Sure', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'viewer', 'expect', 'more', 'actor', 'simply', 'sleep', 'walking', 'role', 'Zeta-Jones', 'wasted', 'part', 'little', 'could', 'be', 'blessing', 'seeing', 'what', 'others', 'did', 'parts.The', 'movie', 'also', 'predictable', 'feel', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'long', 'characters', 'involved', 'do', 'may', 'be', 'films', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'one', 'little', 'make', 'different', 'rest', 'stated', 'earlier', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'feel', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'Wahlberg', 'Crowe', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'rest', 'go', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'will', 'doubt', 'satisfy']",N/A

Billy Taggart, a struggling private investigator now works for Mayor Hostetler.  Surprisingly the movie isn't too bad.  Sure, the testosterone overflows, but Crowe and Wahlberg have both been much worse.  One thing I could have done without is Wahlberg's scenes as a drunk.  Not convincing.Taggart was kicked off the force for shooting and killing a rapist/murderer who was turned loose by the courts.  The victim's sister Natalie (Natalie Martinez) becomes Billy's girlfriend but inexplicably departs midway through the movie.  It's like the filmmaker's just decided to change plots.  Taggart is hired by the mayor to follow his wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is suspected of having an affair.  Alas, there is more to her activities than sex.She has the goods on her hubby and would love nothing better than for him to be defeated in the soon to be held election.

1623989,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BB67UNW,Paul Allaer,"[8, 8]","""Broken City"" (2013 release; 109 min.) is a political crime drama in which we meet Billy Taggert (played by Mark Wahlberg), an ex-cop who is now a struggling private eue in New York. One day Taggert gets hired by New York's Mayor (played by Russell Crowe) to check out the Mayor's wife (play by Catherine Zeta-Jones), whom the Mayor suspects of having an affair. Taggert gets on it right away and wouldn't you know, he finds the Mayor's wife in the arms of the campaign manager of the Mayor's opponent in the upcoming election. Will this impact the Mayor's re-election prospects? Or will it torpedo instead the Mayor's opponent? Are there other twists and turns? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your vieweing pleasure, you'll just have to see for itself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are expecting an action movie (as I did, having seen the trailer in previous weeks), be forewarned! This is an all-talk, hardly any action, movie. The first (and just about only) action comes 75 min. into the movie when there is a brief car chase. Then there are a couple of fist fights, but that's about it. This is in and if itself not a problem, if the talking leads to a compelling drama, in this case a political crime movie (similar to, say, the all-talk ""All The President's Men"". Alas, this movie is no ""All The President's Men"".There are several noteworthy performances, first from Russell Crowe, who seems to enjoy his role of the overly zealous Mayor. Catherine Zeta-Jones as his wife steals several scnes with her charm. But the biggest surprise for me was Alona Tal as Kathy, the office assistant of Taggert. I don't think I had seen her before. Can't wait to see where she goes from here. I also liked the soundtrack quite a bit (scored by Atticus Ross). Meanwhile ""Broken City"" is not all that bad, but not all that great either and it is not the action movie that the trailer had lead me to expect.",3,Political crime talkie (no action),1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,1944,"['Broken', 'City', '2013', 'release', '109', 'min', 'political', 'crime', 'drama', 'meet', 'Billy', 'Taggert', 'played', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'now', 'struggling', 'private', 'eue', 'New', 'York', 'One', 'day', 'Taggert', 'hired', 'New', 'York', 'Mayor', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'check', 'out', 'Mayor', 'wife', 'play', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'whom', 'Mayor', 'suspects', 'having', 'affair', 'Taggert', 'right', 'away', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Mayor', 'wife', 'arms', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Mayor', 'opponent', 'upcoming', 'election', 'Will', 'impact', 'Mayor', 're-election', 'prospects', 'will', 'torpedo', 'instead', 'Mayor', 'opponent', 'Are', 'there', 'other', 'twists', 'turns', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'vieweing', 'pleasure', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'are', 'expecting', 'action', 'movie', 'did', 'having', 'seen', 'trailer', 'previous', 'weeks', 'be', 'forewarned', 'all-talk', 'hardly', 'action', 'movie', 'first', 'just', 'only', 'action', '75', 'min', 'movie', 'when', 'brief', 'car', 'chase', 'Then', 'are', 'couple', 'fist', 'fights', 'not', 'problem', 'talking', 'leads', 'compelling', 'drama', 'case', 'political', 'crime', 'movie', 'similar', 'say', 'all-talk', 'President', 'Men', 'Alas', 'movie', 'President', 'Men', 'are', 'several', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'first', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'enjoy', 'role', 'overly', 'zealous', 'Mayor', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'wife', 'steals', 'several', 'scnes', 'charm', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'Alona', 'Tal', 'Kathy', 'office', 'assistant', 'Taggert', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'seen', 'before', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'here', 'also', 'liked', 'soundtrack', 'quite', 'bit', 'scored', 'Atticus', 'Ross', 'Meanwhile', 'Broken', 'City', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'trailer', 'had', 'lead', 'expect']",N/A

1623997,AO6L5RJILSLDX,B00BB67UNW,"R. Long ""Tessie's Boy""","[7, 8]","Broken City (2013)After all this time, I have to finally admit it: I like Mark Wahlberg. He's grown on me with each new role, even when the movies he's starring in aren't exactly masterpieces. He seems to have embraced the Tom Cruise mode of stardom where, while not stretching too far out of his comfort zone, he manages to play interesting variations on the same persona from movie to movie, and usually delivers an entertaining product. I've always loved Russell Crowe, a great actor who can either be subtle or chomp scenery like a champ (as he does here), and who can make even the lousiest movie he's in (think Man With the Iron Fists) into something at least watchable. It was on the strength of these two that I decided to watch Broken City, even though it didn't get the best reviews when it came out.Wahlberg plays private investigator Billy Taggart, an ex-cop who was booted from the force in disgrace seven years prior for the questionable shooting of an accused rapist and murderer. Crowe plays Nicholas Hostetler, the wheeling and dealing mayor of New York City with whom Taggart has a bit of history. When the Mayor hires Billy during a re-election campaign to find the man with whom his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair, Billy thinks it's a simple adultery case. But as is often the case in movies like these, nothing is what it seems as Taggart uncovers a web of lies involving not only adultery but political intrigue, murder and a shady land deal that may be tied to his own troubled past...The problem with Broken City is that it isn't sure what to focus on. There are just too many running subplots stuffed into this 100-minute flick: one involving Billy's aspiring actress girlfriend (who also happens to be the sister of the victim of the criminal that Billy shot) who is excited about starring in her first indie film, one involving the Police Commissioner who has his own reasons for wanting to investigate the Mayor, one involving Billy's young assistant and the ""will-they-won't they"" dynamic they have, one with the Mayor's opponent Jack Valiant (played by Barry Pepper with a freakin' sweet mullet) and his campaign manager (Kyle Chandler), one with the dysfunctional relationship between a powerful land developer and his son, and so on and so on. It's too much. The movie just kind of lurches from plot to plot and as a result, none of them are particulary satisfying.Then there are the little implausibilities which took me right out of the movie. Since there were a bunch of them and I've already written a lot here, I'll stick to three main examples: **SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**-The hilariously abrupt breakup between Taggart and his girlfriend. Basically, the girl does a pretty graphic love scene in her movie and apparently didn't forewarn Billy about its intensity, so his simmering jealousy about the relationship between his girlfriend and her co-star boils over and Billy, a recovering alcoholic, starts getting trashed at the after-party. Then his girlfriend confronts him after watching him have three drinks and says that it's over, and the only thing tying them together is the memory of her dead sister, and blah blah blah. Then she disappears from the film, never to be seen again. This after we've just spent the previous 40 minutes watching them engage in a tender, mutually loving relationship. It felt like the writer was writing the script and thought, ""Oh well, time to move the story along, she hates him now!""-At one point, Billy stakes out the Big Bad Corporation behind the shady land deal and sees a worker take a box of trash to the dumpster. He checks out the box and finds the ""smoking gun"": blueprints and projections for the planned real estate development in pristine condition. Not thirty seconds later, he looks in the office window and sees the office workers shredding every document, destroying all evidence of their misdeeds. WTF? Did this one guy just say, ""ah, the heck with it, it's my smoke break, no need to shred these""?-Evidence of Billy's shooting the rapist emerges in the form of an old videotape taken at the scene. I'm sorry, a videotape?? Even if you take into account that the incident took place seven years before the film, that still only makes the year 2006! I was waiting for the mayor to break out the BetaMax next. (Though I must say, I did like the wrinkle it presented for Wahlberg's character; in the end, he can't take the mayor down without implicating himself.) **END SPOILERS**Reading all that, it seems like I didn't like the movie all that much, but that's not exactly the case. I liked it well enough for what it was: a modestly entertaining, B-level time-waster with some decent acting. It's the kind of film that would have played well on a rainy Sunday afternoon on TNT in the late '90s. In fact, it did remind me strongly of another movie from that era, the somewhat forgotten City Hall (1996) with Al Pacino and John Cusack. Come to think of it, maybe you should watch that instead.Picture quality on the Blu Ray was, as expected for a newer release, very good with lots of deep blacks and no noticeable artifacts. Sound quality was good, particularly during the handful of action scenes. No extras of note aside from the usual fluff.2.5 of 5 stars, rounded up to 3.*********Broken City (2013)Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Geoffrey Wright, Barry Pepper,

It's hard not to have high expectations when both Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe are in the cast. Throw in Catherine Zeta Jones, and how can it not be great??? I wish I knew....but it wasn't great. It wasn't even very good.The actors brought nothing new or engaging to their parts. They spoke their lines, yelled occasionally, and left us wanting more. The story was needlessly complex in places, with 6 or 8 different unfamiliar character names thrown at the audience in one or two sentences of dialog, and the entire middle portion of the movie dragged to the point of boredom.The entire subplot involving Wahlberg's girlfriend added nothing to the story. If you have seen the movie, imagine for a moment how much better it would have been without the time wasted on this needless plot complication. The entire ""independent movie"" subplot was far-fetched and poorly rendered. Meanwhile, his relationship with his secretary was much more interesting and promising. I felt nothing for his girlfriend, while I really liked his secretary; and, to be honest, I found it unrealistic that he didn't share my feelings, at least until the end. Maybe his frequent (and tiresome) guzzling of booze after ""falling off the wagon"" dimmed his judgement.Finally, a movie like this is only as good as its villain. A truly great villain can elevate a mundane production to a much higher plane; but in this case, I feel that Russell Crowe, one of the strongest, most dynamic, charismatic, and menacing characters to ever appear in cinema....simply didn't deliver. I don't place the blame for this failure entirely on him. Much of his strength was smothered in weird hairdo's, odd costumes, varying accents, and the phoniest spray-on tan this side of Dancing with the Stars. It was like watching Anthony Hopkins trying to play Hannibal Lecter in a tutu and clown shoes....no one could have pulled it off. The flawed script, weak dialog, and director's lack of vision simply would not allow it.In conclusion, look at the analysis of ratings, with a large majority of viewers giving it 3 stars or less. This movie fell far short of both audience expectation and its own potential, and is not particularly enjoyable to watch, despite a great cast and interesting premise.
