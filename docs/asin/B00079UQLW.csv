I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the acting (and physique) of Darius McCrary.  In the past I always felt he was somewhat of a corny, under developed  actor, both on television (Family Matters) and in film (Kingdom Come).  He has come a long way.Arnez J, who has always managed to get a hearty laugh out of me whenever he appears on comic view, does a wonderful job as well.I highly recommend this play!",5,FOLLOWED THE STORYLINE OF THE BOOK PRETTY WELL....,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,516,"['very', 'good', 'play', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'storyline', 'definitely', 'beauty', 'actors', 'actress', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'acting', 'physique', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'past', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'developed', 'actor', 'television', 'Family', 'Matters', 'film', 'Kingdom', 'Come', 'come', 'long', 'way.Arnez', 'J', 'who', 'always', 'managed', 'get', 'hearty', 'comic', 'view', 'wonderful', 'job', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'play']",The Maintenance Man

I took a chance and watched the movie first. It was a great play all the actors made this play worth the money.  A surprise performance that I enjoyed was Arnez J.  His singing isn't great but his acting is.  There are a lot of inside jokes in this that you have to listen for to catch them.  Let me just say that Billy Dee looks great even at his age.  I suggest you spend the money to get this play the opening monologue by Darius McCrary is worth the money alone.,5,A Hit Play,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,575,"['watched', 'play', 'day', 'got', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'based', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'took', 'chance', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'was', 'great', 'play', 'actors', 'made', 'play', 'money', 'A', 'surprise', 'performance', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'Arnez', 'J', 'singing', ""n't"", 'great', 'acting', 'are', 'lot', 'inside', 'jokes', 'have', 'listen', 'catch', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'great', 'even', 'age', 'suggest', 'spend', 'money', 'get', 'play', 'opening', 'monologue', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'money', 'alone']",The Maintenance Man
