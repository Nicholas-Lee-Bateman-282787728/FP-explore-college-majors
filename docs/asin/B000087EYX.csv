734392,A3TIXPAXQLJ4WQ,B000087EYX,Adrift in Suburbia,"[13, 15]","This film, written and directed by Tim Blake Nelson, is based on a true story written by a Hungarian doctor (a Holocaust survivor who worked under Mengele). You are instantly, from the first eerie shot, drawn into the inner-world of the Nazi death camps, into the realm of the Jewish workers in charge of removing and burning the bodies from the gas chambers.  By doing this work, the Nazis grant them an extra four months to live and allow them extra rations.  They are doomed, and they know they are doomed.  Life is worth a gold watch, or maybe not even that much.  The performers  -- Harvey Keitel, David Arquette, Mira Sorvino -- are nearly unrecognizable in their uniforms or prison garb, their heads shaved closely.  Death is commonplace, hardly worth raising one's head to observe.  It's unlike any Holocaust drama, and perhaps, just perhaps, a vision of the unimaginable experience itself.  At the end, the director draws something unexpected and close to miraculous out of the flames and ashes.

This film is based on a book called Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account by Miklos Nyiszli. The film deals with one of the darkest times in the human history, Auschwitz, 1944. The story is about Sonderkommandos, a group of Jews forced to work for the Nazi's against their own kind for an exchange of having their life extended for couple of more months. As you can imagine, Sonderkommandos are put in the worst situation possible, but they all refuse to admit that they are helping the Nazi's even though their actions could be considered just as bad as the Nazi's. However, in the time of a war, and especially in this case, a morality does not exist, you do what you can to survive. Sonderkommandos can be considered traitors but also heroes, it all depends on how you look at it. To me, this situation is something I would never be able to handle on a mental level of sanity. I guess this story can be argued, and the argument will for sure have two sides. The pros and non's, like always, in time of a war, there is never really a common ground... sadly.This film is extremely hard to stomach at certain points. A lifeless corpses piled up on one another, thick black smoke of burning bodies that echoes pure pain and suffering. Gas chambers filled with innocent people being tortured to death, cold-hearted Nazi's shooting people on the spot, an extremely bloody and a painful reminder to the audiences of the evil that has happened in 1994 and an unknown story of twelfth Sonderkommandos who lead the only armed uprising at the death camp. While many have judged these Sonderkommandos as traitors, the writer/director of this film has chosen to defend them.Out of all the actors in the world I would have never thought David Arquette would be involved in this movie. I will have to say that I have a new found respect for him mainly because I was not aware that he could do well in a dramatic movie such as this one. I guess I am guilty of judging him from his previous movies, but I am glad that he proved to me and anyone else who might have doubted him, that he is capable of much more. The rest of the cast is also memorable but no one comes close to David Arquette. Kudos to Mira Sorvino who almost looks unrecognizable in this film. The acting from the cast is quite recognizable here but due to the fact that the story is so gripping, one often focuses on just the story and not the acting.If you are looking for an answer to some question in this movie, you will not find it.  With a story such as this one, there is no real answer, only a painful reminder.",5,Gritty,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,2782,"['Grey', 'Zone', 'was', 'originally', 'book', 'was', 'adapted', 'play', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'O', 'Eye', 'God', 'Kansas', 'now', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'adapted', 'play', 'movie', 'almost', 'unknown', 'public', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'called', 'Auschwitz', 'Doctor', 'Eyewitness', 'Account', 'Miklos', 'Nyiszli', 'film', 'deals', 'one', 'darkest', 'times', 'human', 'history', 'Auschwitz', '1944', 'story', 'Sonderkommandos', 'group', 'Jews', 'forced', 'work', 'Nazi', 'own', 'kind', 'exchange', 'having', 'life', 'extended', 'couple', 'more', 'months', 'can', 'imagine', 'Sonderkommandos', 'are', 'put', 'worst', 'situation', 'possible', 'refuse', 'admit', 'are', 'helping', 'Nazi', 'even', 'actions', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Nazi', 'However', 'time', 'war', 'especially', 'case', 'morality', 'not', 'exist', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'survive', 'Sonderkommandos', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'traitors', 'also', 'heroes', 'how', 'look', 'situation', 'something', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'mental', 'level', 'sanity', 'guess', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'argument', 'will', 'sure', 'have', 'two', 'sides', 'pros', 'non', 'always', 'time', 'war', 'never', 'really', 'common', 'ground', 'sadly.This', 'film', 'extremely', 'hard', 'stomach', 'certain', 'points', 'lifeless', 'corpses', 'piled', 'up', 'one', 'thick', 'black', 'smoke', 'burning', 'bodies', 'echoes', 'pure', 'pain', 'suffering', 'Gas', 'chambers', 'filled', 'innocent', 'people', 'being', 'tortured', 'death', 'cold-hearted', 'Nazi', 'shooting', 'people', 'spot', 'extremely', 'bloody', 'painful', 'reminder', 'audiences', 'evil', 'happened', '1994', 'unknown', 'story', 'twelfth', 'Sonderkommandos', 'who', 'lead', 'only', 'armed', 'uprising', 'death', 'camp', 'many', 'have', 'judged', 'Sonderkommandos', 'traitors', 'writer/director', 'film', 'chosen', 'defend', 'them.Out', 'actors', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'David', 'Arquette', 'would', 'be', 'involved', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'new', 'found', 'respect', 'mainly', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'could', 'do', 'well', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'such', 'one', 'guess', 'am', 'guilty', 'judging', 'previous', 'movies', 'am', 'glad', 'proved', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'doubted', 'capable', 'much', 'more', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'memorable', 'one', 'close', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Kudos', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'who', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'film', 'acting', 'cast', 'quite', 'recognizable', 'here', 'due', 'fact', 'story', 'so', 'gripping', 'one', 'often', 'just', 'story', 'not', 'acting.If', 'are', 'looking', 'answer', 'question', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'story', 'such', 'one', 'real', 'answer', 'only', 'painful', 'reminder']",N/A

The Jews who cooperated maybe got to live a little longer, maybe got a little more food, an extra blanket. It's amazing what the will to survive will do to a human being. And, without those survivors telling their stories, holocaust deniers would not even need to exist.

734400,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000087EYX,Craig Matteson,"[8, 8]","This is not a horror movie, but it is a movie of real horror.  It is about the horrors of Auschwitz, what it took to run that place, what some were forced to do to stay alive for a bit longer, and what bravery some showed in trying to stop the horror even for a few hours or a few days.  It is not for the squeamish, those who are afraid to see piles of naked bodies being stuffed into ovens, or hearing the screams of the dying as they were being gassed.  Then there are the conversations among the living about staying alive, being dead, what they should or shouldn't do, and the Nazi's torturing prisoners to get information they think they need.There was indeed a prisoner riot at Auschwitz, but not every detail in this movie is historically accurate.  However, there are no exaggerations of the horror and monstrous acts.  In fact, they are probably still understated.  The acting in the movie is very good, but beware before you watch it.  Seriously, this movie could traumatize someone not prepared for what they are going to see in this harsh movie.It is not all bleak, however, there is tremendous power in the scenes involving the preparations and smuggling of material to prepare for the sabotage and riot.  There is also the girl whom the prisoners try to hide and revive because she survived the gas.  Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, played wonderfully by Allan Corduner, is based on a real life person of the same name who was forced into doing autopsies on twins for Josef Mengele in order to try and protect his own wife and child.  His moral dilemma is among the most crushing in the movie.  Steve Buscemi's role as Hesch Abramowics is also very memorable.  He is a complete cynic, or is he?  You have to decide.  Asking yourself what you would do in the horror of Auschwitz is part of the movie.  It is easy to say you would refuse, but dying just for yourself isn't the issue, you have a spouse, and probably children.  Do you just walk with them into the poison gas and or shove their bodies into the ovens?Really, a very powerful and powerfully disturbing movie.

The producers wanted to create a claustraphobic feel to this movie, and they certainly have done that. Unlike other Holocaust films that I have seen, the gas chambers and ovens are shown working in full force instead of merely being hinted at. We get the experience that we are there instead of only reading about it. And the film gives added insight into the life of those who ""helped"" the Germans, but one wonders that even with a short life expectency it might have still been better to deny the luxury as a symbol of protest.The biggest turnoff to this movie was the conatant use of the ""F"" word. Whether it may or may not have been used to the degree that it was, it gave me the impression that the concentration camp victims were nothing but a bunch of godless men, more suited to the penal colony of Aliens 3. The constant use of the ""F"" word was a distraction, and I think there were Holocaust victims who did hang on to their dignity as best they could. Perhaps the Holocaust made athiests out of some Jews, but it also made believers out of some athiests, and this fact was grossly missing from this movie. Where was faith in Auschwitz? It was there, too, but so often Hollywood wants to present soldiers and others as being nothing more than animals whose only pleasure in life comes from raping the women and killing the men--just watch ""Dances With Wolves,"" and ""The Outlaw Josy Wales.""

734406,A2JLX9KX51OWCM,B000087EYX,derek glidewell,"[4, 7]","This film tells the true story of the NAZI appointed SonderKommandos who were Jewish prisoners assigned to exterminate other fellow Jews and dispose of their corpses through cremation in exchange for exceptional living qualities and roughly an extra 4 months of life depending on how well they performed their tasks. The Kommandos would convince the Jews that the sooner they showered and became disinfected the sooner they would be reunited with their families, which of course were lies, little did the Jews know that the showers were gas chambers. But through committing these horrible tasks the Kommandos were secretly planning the only revolt ever committed inside the Jewish concentration camps.The Grey Zone has no CGI, no slam bang action sequences, nor does it feature a blaring soundtrack, it simply relies on what good old film consists of; Acting, direction, and cinematography. Everything featured in this film is worthy of the highest praise. The cast provides excellent performances, and the one who surprised me most was David Arquette. I must say I found his performance Oscar worthy and I believe that he is truly talented as he has steered clear of his goofy lovable self and taken on a serious, much controversial role. Tim Blake Nelson provides excellent, realistically disturbing direction that makes it appear as though you are actually there, witnessing the horrible accounts of these ill fated lives. You get this feeling in you that makes you get a feeling of the conditions the Kommandos went through, feeling trapped, knowing death is inevitable, and though however horrible these tasks they performed you still have empathy for the Kommandos and you can actually get a sense of understanding as to why they do what they do to survive, if only for temporary satisfaction.I guess what was best about The Grey Zone is how it accurately portrays human instability in uncertain times. The Grey Zone essentially asks the question of what would we do to keep living, if someone held a gun to your head and said, ""You can die now or you can die in 4 months"", I think I know the answer that any Human would give, including myself. And when you view what these people went through and how scared they were, I think you'll understand their decisions and given the options it's hard to truthfully criticize these men. But these issues constantly plague the Kommandos, and once you see their spectacular and heroic if not meaningless uprising, it shows that good resides in all of us no matter how grim and inhuman we appear. I particularly enjoyed seeing the Kommandos revolt and up rise, thus redeeming themselves and doing something so noble, as these men knew that once the revolt began they were not going to make it out alive and that this was their last shot at glory. The Grey Zone lacks in no department, it provides the most realistic view of the Holocaust I've seen to date, and though there is no happy ending, I enjoyed it's realistic point of view on life, no matter how grisly.The Grey Zone is only playing at 31 screens across the US but with the rave reviews it's receiving and all the positive criticism, I'm sure it will reach a theater near you and I think that if you must view a film this year than let The Grey Zone fill that movie going need. But be prepared that this film is truthfully painful and is not about great music and CGI effects, as it was produced for only $5 million and it features no score. In fact only 2 scenes feature any musical integration, one of which includes the uprising, which is the most satisfying scene in the film. But The Grey Zone simply relies on the ability of the actor's and the style of old fashion story telling that sadly appears to have become a minority in Hollywood now a days. All in all I would say this is the best film of the year I've seen and I can see Oscar nominations in it's hopefully long future. I highly recommend The Grey Zone, and solid 5 stars out of 5.",5,An amazing recreation of tragic history.,1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,3952,"['film', 'true', 'story', 'NAZI', 'appointed', 'SonderKommandos', 'who', 'were', 'Jewish', 'prisoners', 'assigned', 'exterminate', 'other', 'fellow', 'Jews', 'dispose', 'corpses', 'cremation', 'exchange', 'exceptional', 'living', 'qualities', 'roughly', 'extra', '4', 'months', 'life', 'depending', 'how', 'well', 'performed', 'tasks', 'Kommandos', 'would', 'convince', 'Jews', 'sooner', 'showered', 'became', 'disinfected', 'sooner', 'would', 'be', 'reunited', 'families', 'course', 'were', 'lies', 'little', 'did', 'Jews', 'know', 'showers', 'were', 'gas', 'chambers', 'committing', 'horrible', 'tasks', 'Kommandos', 'were', 'secretly', 'planning', 'only', 'revolt', 'ever', 'committed', 'Jewish', 'concentration', 'camps.The', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'CGI', 'slam', 'action', 'sequences', 'feature', 'blaring', 'soundtrack', 'simply', 'what', 'good', 'old', 'film', 'Acting', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'Everything', 'featured', 'film', 'worthy', 'highest', 'praise', 'cast', 'excellent', 'performances', 'one', 'who', 'surprised', 'most', 'was', 'David', 'Arquette', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'believe', 'truly', 'talented', 'steered', 'clear', 'goofy', 'lovable', 'self', 'taken', 'serious', 'much', 'controversial', 'role', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'excellent', 'realistically', 'disturbing', 'direction', 'appear', 'are', 'actually', 'there', 'witnessing', 'horrible', 'accounts', 'ill', 'fated', 'lives', 'get', 'feeling', 'get', 'feeling', 'conditions', 'Kommandos', 'went', 'feeling', 'trapped', 'knowing', 'death', 'inevitable', 'however', 'horrible', 'tasks', 'performed', 'still', 'have', 'empathy', 'Kommandos', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'sense', 'understanding', 'why', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'survive', 'only', 'temporary', 'satisfaction.I', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'how', 'accurately', 'human', 'instability', 'uncertain', 'times', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'essentially', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'keep', 'living', 'someone', 'held', 'gun', 'head', 'said', 'can', 'die', 'now', 'can', 'die', '4', 'months', 'think', 'know', 'answer', 'Human', 'would', 'give', 'including', 'when', 'view', 'what', 'people', 'went', 'how', 'scared', 'were', 'think', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'decisions', 'given', 'options', 'hard', 'truthfully', 'criticize', 'men', 'issues', 'constantly', 'plague', 'Kommandos', 'once', 'see', 'spectacular', 'heroic', 'not', 'meaningless', 'uprising', 'good', 'resides', 'matter', 'how', 'grim', 'inhuman', 'appear', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Kommandos', 'revolt', 'up', 'rise', 'thus', 'redeeming', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'noble', 'men', 'knew', 'once', 'revolt', 'began', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'was', 'last', 'shot', 'glory', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'department', 'most', 'realistic', 'view', 'Holocaust', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'happy', 'ending', 'enjoyed', 'realistic', 'point', 'view', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'grisly.The', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'only', 'playing', '31', 'screens', 'US', 'rave', 'receiving', 'positive', 'criticism', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'reach', 'theater', 'think', 'must', 'view', 'film', 'year', 'let', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'fill', 'movie', 'going', 'need', 'be', 'prepared', 'film', 'truthfully', 'painful', 'not', 'great', 'music', 'CGI', 'effects', 'was', 'produced', 'only', '5', 'million', 'score', 'fact', 'only', '2', 'scenes', 'feature', 'musical', 'integration', 'one', 'uprising', 'most', 'satisfying', 'scene', 'film', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'simply', 'ability', 'actor', 'style', 'old', 'fashion', 'story', 'telling', 'sadly', 'have', 'become', 'minority', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'days', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'film', 'year', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'see', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'hopefully', 'long', 'future', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'solid', '5', 'stars', '5']",N/A

While other movies about the Holocaust may be more accessible to the public at large and thus more apt to win Oscars, THE GREY ZONE is based upon hard facts and tells those facts in the most visually compelling and emotionally devasting manner imaginable.  Tim Blake Nelson directed and penned the screenplay based on his own play of the same name which in turn was based on the writings of camp survivor Dr Miklos Nyiszlis.  The title is descriptive on many levels: the constant darkness of the atmosphere around Auschwitz from the smoke and ash debris of the crematoriums, the different zones with the camp that designated the various levels of waiting for annhilation, and that zone (grey) between life (white) and death (black) that allowed some of the Jews to elect to be Sonderkommandos - workers who lead their own people to the showers, reassuringly taking their clothes, locking them in the gas chambers, then unloading the bodies onto carts to transport to the crematoriums where they actually had to place the corpses into the ovens and cart away the ashes after the burnings. As the 'desparation of doing anything for survival' makes the indvidual do the incomprehensible, so does this film explore how crushed were the minds of these fated men and women.Nelson achieves a harrowing sense of reality by uncompromisingly showing all phases of life and death in the camps and he does this so successfully in his choice of terse taut dialogue, quiet voices, lingering images of eyes, and a pacing that seems as formidable as the facts at hand. He keeps the lighting, the atmosphere, the scoring, and the acting level at such a suffocatingly low key that the story becomes just that much more devastating.  He also has drawn superb performances from an outstanding cast: David Arquette is brilliant in his embodiment of all that is pitiful in the destiny of these events, Allan Cordunes is stunning as Dr Nyiszlis, Harvey Keitel IS the Nazi in control, and Mira Sorvino, David Benzali, and Steve Buscemi are equally superb.The living memorial of this true story is that it tells of the only uprising of the Jews in the camps in a 1944 incident that managed to permanently destroy about half of the crematoriums in Auschwitz before that uprising ended in the mass execution of the perpetrators.  A case in point of the sensitivity of this film:  during the uprising the hauntingly beautiful ""Alto Rhapsody"" of Brahms is superimposed on the action - one of those inimitable moments of the marriage of arts as any ever captured on the screen.This is a very fine film but it may not be one that everyone can tolerate seeing. It is extrememly vivid, it does not spare the eye, but it never stoops to sensationalism.  Even in the most gruesome of scenes there is a palpable presence of the indestructable human spirit.

Harder still is to understand why people chose to help out the Germans.  When you watch how the people coming off the trains were treated, you ask yourself why didn't they rebel. Well part of the reason was that they were told by their own that they were going in for showers.  Why would you fight against that?What if there were no SonderKommandos? Would the Germans not have hired other people (Poles and Balts) who would have been happy to do the work just like they did in the Eastern Camps?  Would these 'others' have treated those going to the 'chambers' any better or worse?  If you were there, what would you do to stay alive, even if for only four more months?What doesn't show is the years of humiliation, like a woman who have suffered years of abuse by her husband.  That is what these people were like when they came into the Jagers.  They had first been stripped of all their rights and then spent years in forced ghettos living like convicts.One thing that was missing from the movie is the condition of the people when they go out of the 'cars'.  Most had been in them at least for forty -eight hours, with no food or water and one bucket for urine and feces.  There may have been up to 120 people in a car that could fit maybe sixty.  Many were forced to stand for the whole trip.  Some would have died enroute and there was no way to get rid of the bodies.  When the cars were opened the people inside were so traumatized that they were like robots.  Some had even gone insane while locked up and the rest would have had to endure their screaming and ranting during the trip.It's hard to imaging what these people endured before they were gassed.  In many cases, as they left the cars, anyone who complained were shot on the spot.  These were normal, law abiding people, how would you reach if someone shot the person next to you in the head, and their brains and blood were splattered all over you, having endured 48 hours or more stuffed in a cattle car?This may seem raw, but was mild compared to the actual camps.  The one part that was close was when they were shooting the woman, to get the other two woman to confess.  The German in charge, took no notice of the screaming of the woman about to be shot or that they were not involved.  To them all Jews were 'untermenschen' (underpeople) who would all be killed eventually.

I also like Harvey Keitel but was not really feeling him in his role.  I am assuming we are all supposed to pretend the actors were Jewish or Hungarian or German, etc. Then why is it some characters were given accents and others weren't?  And like everyone else who has reviewed the movie, I feel the ""F"" word was way over used.  It definitely took away from the overall authenticity of the time period in which the movie took place.  It seemed almost as if the characters were hanging out on the corner somewhere in NYC, arguing over a bad card game.Aside from the above, The Grey Zone succeeded in freaking me out beyond belief.  The live people going in to the gas chambers only to come out dead, shoveled into the fire and dumped into the river are images that will be with me for a while.  The scene in which they painted the gas chamber walls had the most impact on me.  Imagine them painting over the mess the people left behind as they were gassed to death?

There are a few historical errors, and the relationship between SS and prisoners - with the exception of the people like Nyszli - was rarely as ""conversational"" as the film suggests.  The hierarachy within the sonderkommando itself is also missing, which was a key part of what they had to contend with.  Typically, SS spoke directly (in the form of giving orders) to non-Jewish kapos; not to the class of prisoners who figure centrally in the film.  Likewise, the frenetic pace of the work when there was a transport to be ""disposed of"" was not shown here.  I assume this was in the interest of everything being ""matter of fact,"" which _is_ generally true to the sonderkommando's everday adaptation to their task.I found the mix of accents confusing - why did only the Germans get them?  And some of the interaction around planning the rebellion needed a bit more context, I think.That said, there is more here that is _essentially_ true than in most Holocaust films.

To attack the flaws first, yest, it does feel rather stagy, with its heritage in theater all too clearly showing. And the dialog is indeed frequently extracted from some grade B 40s movie. And I did find the male leads a little unbelievable. But, in a film of this magnitude, these are minor quibbles. Prevent that fifth star, but still, an excellent film. Some have objected to Harvey Keitel's accent. Yeah, well, sure it might have been better without it, but I actually would have liked more phony German accents to distinguish the German speakers from the Jews. Other critics have objected to its violence, its nudity, and its grossness. Well, this was a violent, naked time. I am no fan of gratuitous nudity or violence, but I found them effectively, even tastefully, used here, with sounds, looks, and results showing us what happened.What's good about it? Well to start, the title is great. Contemporary morality loves to tell us that all dilemmas are shades of grey, where negotiation is the answer. If we could just discuss our differences, we could reach an amicable solution. But faced with the monstrous evil of gassing and burning Jews by the trainload, there is no grey. What discussion would be appropriate here? What negotiation? How about we stun them first before gassing them? Or cut back the number of the damned? Or maybe provide a musical accompaniment not just on their entrance to the camp, but on their exit as well? No, this is evil, pure and simple, no compromise, no place for negotiation or concession, no grey zone, but all black and white.Another spectacular image was the lawns being watered while this evil was going on. Life was normal, even suburban, with green grass a priority in this camp, while humans were being slaughtered. The idea of grass being nurtured and cared for while people were not is beautiful. We see the lawns throughout the film, always green, always cared for, always getting what they need. What is important to this culture is evident. And despicable.The cold-heartedness of the murders is wonderfully demonstrated in two scenes. A major character is shot when we do not expect it at all. Just bam, and he's dead. No build up, no drama, no contortions or speeches. Every one watching must act unaffected by this. And in one of the most brilliant scenes, as the newly arrived are being encouraged to remember the number of the hook where they hung their clothes, a confrontation occurs. A screaming woman is casually shot in the head to silence her. And it works. Anyone inconvenient, annoying, or unable to account for themselves properly, was shot. They were cargo, not people, and difficult cargo was removed.I found the photography quite effective. The smokestacks flaming and spewing their ash never let us forget just what the business of this place was. The grim, muted colors, the cramped, confined feel, the oppressive editing and the well chosen music all made the feel as real as it could be for those of us in our living rooms.Better than Schindler's List. Much better than Life is Beautiful.

The film focuses on the selected Jewish prisoners whom volunteered to work in the crematoriums, burning the hundreds of bodies and shoveling away the ash, and would lull the Jews just arriving that they were safe as they escorted them to the gas chambers. In exchange they are given various privileges. But realizing they have only four months to live before they are replaced, these men realizing they are already dead plan to destroy the crematorium, which haunts the souls of every one of them.Tim Blake Nelson directs this film with sheer brilliance and delivers to the audience a film more powerful then ""Shindler's List"", ""The Killing Fields"" or ""Black Hawk Down"". The cast shines in this as well delivering the best performances ever from Mira Sorvino, Harvey Kietel, Steve Busemi and David Arquette (whom full well deserves a nomination for best actor!). The cinematography is haunting but not nearly as much as the make up or art direction that bring to life the true horrors of the concentration camps. The music is stunning and fitting throughout the whole film though most, including myself will be a bit to engage with the film to truly notice it until near the end when it is used in one of the most powerful scenes.The Grey Zone is a highly intense film and is by no means a film that will offer any happiness or even joy to its viewers. Instead it allows us to experience the hopeless of those imprisoned hoping to find some way to find redemption. The violence is exceptionally strong and WILL disturb anyone with a sense of compassion in their body. The film is rated R for strong holocaust violence, language, and nudity.By the ending of this film I found myself shaking from everything that I had seen and even unable to leave immediately from having been so stunned by the ending and all the horrors that transpired.

There are a few graphic and disturbing scenes but they are not done for shock value.  In fact, there are several places where the filmmakers could have shown much more but used creative camera angles to give the viewer just enough visual information to know that the unseen is horrific.This isn't the most riveting holocaust movie and it could have used actors who looked a little worse than just tired.  Rarely did the camp inmates look hollow and emaciated. At times the movie comes across with a feeling of hopelessness and desperation but overall it falls short in its quest to grip the viewer emotionally.My complaints about this film are from purely a technical standpoint... I believe that if this movie helps someone understand and appreciate what the victims of these horrible places went through, then it is good.

What I can't get over is the fact I had no idea she was even in it. The entire time I was watching this tremendous re-enactment I kept thinking (whenever her character was on screen) who is this woman? Where did they find her? I simply could not connect her to the wonderful, scene-stealing job she did in Mighty Aphrodity; the actress is that good here.I do my best to keep from writing lengthy reviews (very often skip over them as well when wanting to find out about a film am interested in, etc.) so I won't go into the plot and what happens. Will only say that, although I always look foreward to seeing Harvey Keitel on screen, I only wish that he had refrained from going with a German accent. Not many American actors can do a foreign accent and do it well, not even Meryl Streep--and I don't care what some people might say about that. Accents never sound right. They should have just hired a German actor to play the part, etc.All in all, kudos to the folks for making the film. It just might leave you choking back a sob or two. Strong stuff.

The characters live in the present, doing everything possible to stay alive just a few more minutes, hours, days...  Many films strive to find humanity and hope in the camps.

734433,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000087EYX,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[63, 69]","I knew that &quot;The Grey Zone&quot; was about a sonder-kommando unit at a Nazi concentration camp, which in and of itself would be an intensely dramatic situation.  The sonder-dommandos where the Jews at death camps, such as Auschwitz II-Birkenau, who escorted their fellow Jews to die in the gas chambers, then took the bodies to the crematoriums, and disposed of the ashes.  For four months the sonder-kommandos carried out their duties, and enjoyed (for lack of a better word), extra food, cigarettes, and even clean sheets.  &quot;The Grey Zone&quot; is set in October of 1944, which meant that the end of the war was in site as Allied troops were moving on Germany (this is before the Hitler's last great counter offensive, the Battle of the Bulge), so four months could well mean being alive.  Of course, this is if the Nazis do not decide to kill everybody in the camp before it is liberated.Actually, there are a lot of &quot;ifs&quot; behind this 2001 film, directed by Tim Blake Nelson and adapted from his stage play.  If you have a chance to live in a death camp, do you take advantage of that opportunity even if it means collaborating witn the Nazis who are gassing your people?  In many other cinematic tales of the Holocaust there is the recurring idea that the sonder-kommando were worst that the Nazis, because they betrayed their own people, and the biggest &quot;if&quot; of all in this film remains what would YOU do if you were in this situation?  You can say, &quot;No, I would never do that,&quot; but then how many stories about the differences between behavioral intentions and overt behavior do you want me to tell you?I thought that haunting question was what &quot;The Grey Zone&quot; was about, but then I discovered that this was actually a historical drama, in the sense that it was based on a specific historical event: the October 7, 1944 uprising when members of the 12th sonder-kommando succeeded in blowing up two of the four crematoria at Auschwitz II-Birkenau.  We learn at the end of the film that the ovens were never replaced and the significance of this accomplishment can only be guessed at in terms of how many lives were saved because the largest of the Nazi death camps had its capacity cut in half.  But the actual revolt ends up being a relatively small part of the film.  More importantly, it sets up another moral dilemma for the men of the 12th sonder-kommando.The leaders of the sonder-kommandos are played by David Arquette, Daniel Benzali, Steve Buscemi and David Chandler, and they have planned the revolt, while Natasha Lyonne and Mira Sorvino lead the women who work at the munitions plant and having been stealing gunpowder to be used in the attack.  I mention the names of the actors without the characters both because names had been replaced by numbers in the camps and because having people like Arquette and Buscemi unforgettably acting against type is pretty memorable.  The crisis comes on the eve of the uprising when a young girl (Kamelia Grigorova) survives the gassing and an impromptu decision is made to save her.  The idea of burning her alive is too much for these men, but the question is whether they can risk what they are about to do for one person (you can see why this worked as a stage play and again, why the uprising itself is not really the main point of the story).  This plot twist is critical, because without it &quot;The Grey Zone&quot; become less about moral dilemmas and more about one of the few times concentration camp inmates fought back against the Nazis.  Would the 12th Sonder-kommandos have done what they did if they did not believe the end of the war was in sight?  Why did the previous 11 groups never even try to do anything similar?  Questions abound in both this film and its wake.Nelson's play is based in part on the book &quot;Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account,&quot; by Miklos Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who did the autopsies for Dr. Josef Mengele's infamous experiments on twins.  He is a collaborator of a different type, doing his grim work because SS-Oberscharfuhrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Harvey Keitel) has promised to keep Nyiszli's wife and daughter alive.  Again, the question of what you would do to stay alive or to save the lives of those you love, comes to the forefront, as does the question of what would then be considered going too far and where would you draw the line?  Consequently, ""The Grey Zone"" is part of what I would call the second generation of Holocaust films, that go beyond providing the details on what happened in the camps and telling stories which are set in concentration camps.  They are still about the Holocaust, but in a different way from what we have seen, most notably on the television mini-series &quot;Holocaust&quot; and &quot;War and Remembrance.&quot;",5,Tim Blake

Most of those involved in these historical events were born in Eastern Europe in the first three decades of the twentieth century. That was a culture far different from our own. In the film, they are portrayed as acting and sounding like they were born our West coast in the last decades of the twentieth century. They're vain, self-obsessed and foul-mouthed with small and petty egos. [they could be East Coast too, by the way]I'm not talking about a lack of the slight Hungarian accents that more talented filmmakers might have added to lend a bit of realism. The problem is not that most of the characters have modern American accents. The problem is that their attitudes and the content of what they're saying is that of today's Los Angeles rather than the Budapest of long ago. Their debates about what to do have all the sallowness of those waiting in line to get tickets for a rock concert. The result rings untrue.

734436,A2A3GTGNPCRFFE,B000087EYX,Maximillian Ben Hanan,"[2, 4]","Holocaust movies are very difficult to make and ""The Grey Zone"" goes a long way towards making a very authentic Holocaust film, but unfortunately it isn't very entertaining. The story of the Holocaust is one that I feel strongly needs to be told, but this film isn't the best vehicle for telling that story...The film tells a story of the Auschwitz death camp and specifically of the Kommandos or work groups recruited from the Jews to run the camps. Most of the film shows the dismal lives of the work crews and their attempts to organize an uprising. Some other reviewers have criticized the film for events that seemed too outlandish to be true, but I can say after having read dozens of Holocaust books, spoken with survivors, and seen most of the film footage that survived the war that the stories all rang true for me. Among the stories was the tale of an old man who was recruited onto a work crew working the crematoriums who was forced to shovel the corpses of his own wife and family into the ovens. It's a gruesome story, but also a very true one.The one ray of light in the film isn't the uprising, but the work crew's chance discovery of a little girl that survived the gassing. At great risk, the work crews hide the little girl and summon a Jewish prisoner doctor to revive her. He revives the little girl and they attempt to hide her indefinitely. The character of the doctor, Miklos Nyiszli, a Hungarian pathologist is both real and well known. He worked as Joseph Mengele's (a twisted man who used live human beings for medical experiments) assistant and was never able to function as a regular human being again. He survived the war. Without feeling that I'm ruining the movie for anyone, the work crew's attempts to save the girl were all for naught as was the attempted uprising. However, the prisoners and work crews were able to disable one of the crematoriums that the Nazis were never able to rebuild.It's hard to say if the acting was good since we never really meet any of the characters and many of the characters names aren't mentioned until very late in the film. This may have been an intentional decision by the director, but it made it very hard to get to identify with any of the characters. The film has an impressive cast including David Arquette, Allan Cordunes, Harvey Keitel, Mira Sorvino, David Benzali, and Steve Buscemi. Harvey Keitel who isn't known for accents did a more-than-passing job as a German Nazi guard.This film is based upon the play of the same name that Tim Blake Nelson wrote. When it played in New York it won numerous awards and received rave reviews. The play was based on the book ""Auschwitz"" by Doctor Miklos Nyiszli. The book is well written, but didn't survive the transition from book to play to film format well.I gave this film four stars instead of five because of its' extremely slow plot, which I don't think could keep the attention of either a disinterested party or someone who hadn't heard of the Holocaust before. I gave it four stars instead of three because the film is truly memorable with a great musical score, good acting within limits, and a very poignant story.I mildly recommend this film and suggest that ""Shindler's List"" would be a much better film to view to learn about the Holocaust.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan",4,"Grey Zone is Slow, Depressing, and Authentic.",1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,3307,"['Holocaust', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'very', 'authentic', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'very', 'entertaining', 'story', 'Holocaust', 'one', 'feel', 'strongly', 'be', 'told', 'film', ""n't"", 'best', 'vehicle', 'telling', 'story', 'film', 'story', 'Auschwitz', 'death', 'camp', 'specifically', 'Kommandos', 'work', 'groups', 'recruited', 'Jews', 'run', 'camps', 'Most', 'film', 'dismal', 'lives', 'work', 'crews', 'attempts', 'organize', 'uprising', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'events', 'seemed', 'too', 'outlandish', 'be', 'true', 'can', 'say', 'having', 'read', 'dozens', 'Holocaust', 'books', 'spoken', 'survivors', 'seen', 'most', 'film', 'footage', 'survived', 'war', 'stories', 'rang', 'true', 'stories', 'was', 'tale', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'recruited', 'work', 'crew', 'working', 'crematoriums', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'shovel', 'corpses', 'own', 'wife', 'family', 'ovens', 'gruesome', 'story', 'also', 'very', 'true', 'one.The', 'one', 'ray', 'light', 'film', ""n't"", 'uprising', 'work', 'crew', 'chance', 'discovery', 'little', 'girl', 'survived', 'gassing', 'great', 'risk', 'work', 'crews', 'hide', 'little', 'girl', 'summon', 'Jewish', 'prisoner', 'doctor', 'revive', 'little', 'girl', 'attempt', 'hide', 'indefinitely', 'character', 'doctor', 'Miklos', 'Nyiszli', 'Hungarian', 'pathologist', 'real', 'well', 'known', 'worked', 'Joseph', 'Mengele', 'twisted', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'live', 'human', 'beings', 'medical', 'experiments', 'assistant', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'function', 'regular', 'human', 'being', 'again', 'survived', 'war', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'ruining', 'movie', 'anyone', 'work', 'crew', 'attempts', 'save', 'girl', 'were', 'naught', 'was', 'attempted', 'uprising', 'However', 'prisoners', 'work', 'crews', 'were', 'able', 'disable', 'one', 'crematoriums', 'Nazis', 'were', 'never', 'able', 'rebuild.It', 'hard', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'never', 'really', 'meet', 'characters', 'many', 'characters', 'names', 'are', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'very', 'late', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'decision', 'director', 'made', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'identify', 'characters', 'film', 'impressive', 'cast', 'including', 'David', 'Arquette', 'Allan', 'Cordunes', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'David', 'Benzali', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'who', ""n't"", 'known', 'accents', 'did', 'more-than-passing', 'job', 'German', 'Nazi', 'guard.This', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'wrote', 'When', 'played', 'New', 'York', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', 'received', 'rave', 'reviews', 'play', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Auschwitz', 'Doctor', 'Miklos', 'Nyiszli', 'book', 'well', 'written', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'transition', 'book', 'play', 'film', 'format', 'well.I', 'gave', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'extremely', 'slow', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'keep', 'attention', 'disinterested', 'party', 'someone', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Holocaust', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'film', 'truly', 'memorable', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'good', 'acting', 'limits', 'very', 'poignant', 'story.I', 'mildly', 'recommend', 'film', 'suggest', 'Shindler', 'List', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'view', 'learn', 'Holocaust.Review', 'Maximillian', 'Ben', 'Hanan']",N/A

The Jews, like a number of people-groups throughout history, have had a very sad past, the latest being the Holocaust of WWII, and when watching this I was reminded of the biblical accounts of the numerous instances of Jewish 'slavery'.This movie is set entirely in the concentration camp (i.e. there are no scenes of the war) and deals with the true story of Auschwitz's twelfth Sonderkommando and its attempts to fight their Nazi captors. _The Grey Zone_ might not be a Schindler's List, but I think it was more realistic in its portrayal of camp life. It is definitely a bleak film, and if you are expecting a movie about redemption or hope, then watch something 'Hollywood' instead. The Grey Zone lets you feel the sense of desperation and hopelessness that must have faced those people who knew that their days were numbered but struggled to hold onto their lives, even if it wasn't much of one.The only fault I can find with this movie is the dialogue. The scriptwriter(s) really let this movie down by giving such unrealistic dialogues to these great actors. At times I was wondering whether this was an American drama or a movie about European Jews during World War II. I didn't see the rationale in giving the Germans a German accent while both Polish and Hungarian Jews had an American one. I would have preferred to have the actors with an accent even if it wasn't the best, rather than hear what was a very Americanized movie.But, as I said, that was the only fault I found, so I hope it has not put you off this movie for good. I would highly recommend it, because it is a more realistic look at life within the concentration camps than some of the more rosy 'Holocaust films'.",4,Definitely not a Hollywood take on the Holocaust.,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,1851,"['One', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'away', 'movie', 'feeling', 'such', 'sorrow', 'atrocities', 'carried', 'out', 'Jews', 'depths', 'mankind', 'can', 'sink', 'Jews', 'number', 'people-groups', 'history', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'sad', 'past', 'latest', 'being', 'Holocaust', 'WWII', 'when', 'watching', 'was', 'reminded', 'biblical', 'accounts', 'numerous', 'instances', 'Jewish', 'movie', 'set', 'entirely', 'concentration', 'camp', 'i.e', 'are', 'scenes', 'war', 'deals', 'true', 'story', 'Auschwitz', 'twelfth', 'Sonderkommando', 'attempts', 'fight', 'Nazi', 'captors', '_The', 'Grey', 'Zone_', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'Schindler', 'List', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'camp', 'life', 'definitely', 'bleak', 'film', 'are', 'expecting', 'movie', 'redemption', 'hope', 'then', 'watch', 'something', ""'Hollywood"", 'instead', 'Grey', 'Zone', 'feel', 'sense', 'desperation', 'hopelessness', 'must', 'have', 'faced', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'days', 'were', 'numbered', 'struggled', 'hold', 'lives', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'one.The', 'only', 'fault', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'scriptwriter', 'really', 'let', 'movie', 'down', 'giving', 'such', 'unrealistic', 'dialogues', 'great', 'actors', 'times', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'American', 'drama', 'movie', 'European', 'Jews', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'rationale', 'giving', 'Germans', 'German', 'accent', 'Polish', 'Hungarian', 'Jews', 'had', 'American', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'have', 'actors', 'accent', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'rather', 'hear', 'what', 'was', 'very', 'Americanized', 'movie.But', 'said', 'was', 'only', 'fault', 'found', 'hope', 'not', 'put', 'movie', 'good', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'more', 'realistic', 'look', 'life', 'concentration', 'camps', 'more', 'rosy', ""'Holocaust"", 'films']",N/A

It is a tale of the depths that people are capable of sinking to to save a few weeks of life.  The men of Sonderkommando 12 work in the selection and clothes changing areas.  They lead people to the gas chambers under the pretext of disinfection.  When the victims are all dead, they disentangle the corpses and search them for hidden jewelry--they cut the hair and they pull out the teeth.  Afterwards, they work in the living Hell of the crematoria, incinerating bodies that are at least partly their personal victims.There is a plot to destroy the crematoria coupled with a major prison break.  Arms are smuggled in from Polish partisans.  The Germans, who have informants everywhere, quickly learn of the plot but don't know how, where or what.  Three women from a work detail in a munitions factory are discovered with powder--illicit explosives.  They are ruthlessly tortured with electric shock but don't break.  They are afterall going to die anyway.  They have second thoughts, however, when the Nazis line up the women in their section and shoot them down, all the while asking the million dollar question.  Half are murdered but no one talks.The plot is almost foiled, howeve, when a prisoner discovers a still living girl under a pile of gassed people.  He convinces others, including the camp doctor, to assist in her resuscitation and hiding.  Trying to hide the girl places the whole operation at risk.  The Commandant discovers her and, in exchange for her life, tries to bribe his brilliant Jewish doctor for more information about the plot.  The doctor denies everything except, to say, that there is a plot.  The Commandant isn't pleased.The plot goes forward.  Arms are seized and the main crematorium goes up in a series of explosions.  Efforts to hold off the trained soldiers, brought in to repel the rebellion are largely hopeless.  Many are killed outright and those who survive are systematically shot in the head.  The young girl, who has survived so much, is shot down by the Commandant.This is a powerful, grim and gruesome story of one of the greatest wrongs in history--the systematic demolition of a people.

On one level you feel bad for criticizing a sincere effort, but on the other when a film with this subject matter (the revolt of the Jewish and Polish Sonderkomandos who ran the crematoriums in Auschwitz in return for a few more months of life) doesn't actually make you FEEL, there's definitely something wrong with it. A few of the performances (Steve Buscemi, Daniel Benzali, David Arquette) are excellent, but far too many are inadequate (especially Alan Corduner in a key role) or just plain bad (Harvey Keitel and Bryan O'Byrne's unfortunately comic book Nazis). The dialogue in director Tim Blake Nelson's script, based on his play, is extremely problematic, to put it mildly. Aiming for evasiveness, it often just sounds like bad Beckett or Pinter (""But -"", ""Of course."" ""Although - "" ""I know"" ""Then...""), with one line often seemingly unrelated to another and badly staged inadvertent momentary pauses where it should have overlapped. But the biggest problem is it's failure to offer much substance or, until the last half hour, much drama. The last 20 minutes do become involving and the ending is genuinely haunting, but the film seems seriously under-developed.

It is about the story of Sonderkommandos - a group of jews who do the ""dirty work"" in the concentration camps that are beneath the nazis in exchange for special privileges. However, this would have been a better movie in the hands more capable director.What made ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" so effective is that the violence was arbitrary, coldly casual and was over before you had a chance to really register what happened. Also there was always a ray of hope to counter-balance the atrocities making the audience care and fear that much more for the characters in those films.Here the director pans over piles of dead bodies far too long, shows prisoners shovelling their deceased loved ones in furnaces in slow-motion with stoic expressions, and shoves the camera in the faces characters who clearly hate themselves. You can almost here Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"" saying ""The horror....the horror."" This is the first movie on the holocaust where I felt the violence was sensationalized. Almost completley removing the human element.From the very beginning there is a tone of bleaknessand despair. With the exception of an awkwardly cast Harvey Kietel the acting is very strong and the ensemble is top notch. But when the characters are so full of self loathing, why should we care about them? All of the actors do it very well, but that is all they do and it keeps the film flat and in a monotone. There is no balance and ultimately you wind up waiting for the inevitable.The film pontificates for close to two hours and you wind up asking yourself to what end? Yes, the holocaust was shocking and horrific. Yes, the nazis were terrible. The film is well acted, the approach is unique and far few and in-between there are some genuine moments.
