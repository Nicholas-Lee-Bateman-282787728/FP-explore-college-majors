The Series is, of course, a simpler tale concentrating on character interaction more than special effects and action. Although the Series does have good special effects and action scenes I found the characters more interesting, lacking the perscution-complex and revenge-rage of the movies. Being a fan of Victoria Pratt (Shalimar) I was delighted with her performace as always.  Good science fiction, well presented.

857487,A298D6BLPSPGHI,B00062IZS6,Fantasy Lore,"[21, 23]","After the first 2 episodes (if you haven't seen this show before, like I hadn't until this DVD First Season Set) there's no way you're going to believe me when I tell you this is a solid, entertaining and stylish show. It's impossible to put your finger on any one bad feature at the start of this series centring on a world of new mutants, because EVERY aspect of their introduction is hideously embarrassing and laughably poor in its execution (Shalimar's pouting being the least of the troubles). Something I must mention though- the special effects that illustrate some of the mutant powers are very poor and funny when they're not supposed to be. Trust me- you'll firmly believe within only a few minutes of the first episode that the only basis for this show is the `X-Men' comics and a group of below average actors who happened to have some spare time between waitressing at Starbucks and auditioning for ketchup commercials (I can't begin to comment on the writing!). But from episode 3 onwards, EVERYTHING comes together and `Mutant X' comes into its own. It's so surprising and actually quite admirable how the producers, actors and writers managed to turn around in a considerably short space of time what could have been an absolute disaster had it continued in that same painful, vein of those initial episodes. From awful to gripping in the blink of an eye, I guarantee and from then on things only get better, episode by episode, consistently excellent in my view until the finale of the season.Admittedly, even at its height, `Mutant X' remains Saturday afternoon, somewhat forgettable television (although probably a great show for all the family) and so does not come close to the enduring brilliance of shows like `Alias', `Firefly' or `Dark Angel', or to other programmes geared to a somewhat more young-adult and above audience, but there are comparisons to be drawn from those shows. The fight scenes in `Mutant X' (I risk saying) are even better than the fight scenes in `Alias', the exploration of minorities in society and the importance of coming to celebrate everyone's uniqueness is an improvement on the similar issues at the heart of `Dark Angel' and the special effects (even the mutant powers before too long) are incredibly visceral and compliment the action very well and come to rival those of `Firefly'. But what this show in its own right manages impressively and effortlessly is to convey a unique message to its audience in each episode. I would say that redemption is the key to the season as a whole- Mason Eckhart (the baddie) remains the unredeemable character- while all others are neither white nor black, but somewhere in between...even the members of our band of injustice-fighting heroes, which is refreshing.I was also reminded of cult programmes like `La Femme Nikita' (which shares a producer with M-X) and `Deep Water Black' (named differently in the U.S. I think), but this show has a tone all of its own, which again you'll find hard to believe after the first two episodes, which fail miserably in setting up a convincing world for these gifted characters. Some good points to convince you it's definitely not all bad- the sets and the locations in `Mutant X' are SPECTACULAR, there are twists and turns in many of the stories that you won't see coming and aren't predictable for even the most jaded fan of the genre, and whether a new feature of this DVD or something the show already possessed- it has a slick, stark and quite beautiful look (in one episode I thought I had the martial arts film `Hero' in my DVD machine by mistake- that good people!).By episode (10), I wanted to write this review to extol the virtues of `Mutant X', but I held off until I'd watched all 22 episodes just in case it took a turn for the worse and descended into the car-crash-horror of the first two introductory episodes, but thankfully it remained enjoyable, fresh, classy television all the way through. An extremely shaky start, but well worth your time and money.Also...regarding this DVD package...the extras are numerous and appealing- tons of outtakes and the commentaries are great, while the plastic case is cheap but functional and the menus are quite attractive and very easy to use.",4,The show that redeems itself!,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,4236,"['first', '2', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'had', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'First', 'Season', 'Set', 'way', ""'re"", 'going', 'believe', 'when', 'tell', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'stylish', 'show', 'impossible', 'put', 'finger', 'one', 'bad', 'feature', 'start', 'series', 'centring', 'world', 'new', 'mutants', 'EVERY', 'aspect', 'introduction', 'hideously', 'embarrassing', 'laughably', 'poor', 'execution', 'Shalimar', 'pouting', 'being', 'least', 'troubles', 'Something', 'must', 'mention', 'though-', 'special', 'effects', 'illustrate', 'mutant', 'powers', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'funny', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'Trust', 'me-', ""'ll"", 'firmly', 'believe', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'first', 'episode', 'only', 'basis', 'show', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'group', 'average', 'actors', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'spare', 'time', 'waitressing', 'Starbucks', 'auditioning', 'ketchup', 'commercials', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'comment', 'writing', 'episode', '3', 'onwards', 'EVERYTHING', 'together', 'Mutant', 'X', 'own', 'so', 'surprising', 'actually', 'quite', 'admirable', 'how', 'producers', 'actors', 'writers', 'managed', 'turn', 'around', 'considerably', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'absolute', 'disaster', 'had', 'continued', 'same', 'painful', 'vein', 'initial', 'episodes', 'awful', 'gripping', 'blink', 'eye', 'guarantee', 'then', 'things', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'episode', 'episode', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'view', 'finale', 'season.Admittedly', 'even', 'height', 'Mutant', 'X', 'remains', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'somewhat', 'forgettable', 'television', 'probably', 'great', 'show', 'family', 'so', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'enduring', 'brilliance', 'shows', 'Alias', 'Firefly', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'other', 'programmes', 'geared', 'somewhat', 'more', 'young-adult', 'above', 'audience', 'are', 'comparisons', 'be', 'drawn', 'shows', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Mutant', 'X', 'risk', 'saying', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Alias', 'exploration', 'minorities', 'society', 'importance', 'coming', 'celebrate', 'everyone', 'uniqueness', 'improvement', 'similar', 'issues', 'heart', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'mutant', 'powers', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'incredibly', 'visceral', 'compliment', 'action', 'very', 'well', 'come', 'rival', 'Firefly', 'what', 'show', 'own', 'right', 'manages', 'impressively', 'effortlessly', 'convey', 'unique', 'message', 'audience', 'episode', 'would', 'say', 'redemption', 'key', 'season', 'whole-', 'Mason', 'Eckhart', 'baddie', 'unredeemable', 'character-', 'others', 'are', 'white', 'black', 'somewhere', 'even', 'members', 'band', 'injustice-fighting', 'heroes', 'refreshing.I', 'was', 'also', 'reminded', 'cult', 'programmes', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'shares', 'producer', 'M-X', 'Deep', 'Water', 'Black', 'named', 'differently', 'U.S', 'think', 'show', 'tone', 'own', 'again', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'fail', 'miserably', 'setting', 'up', 'convincing', 'world', 'gifted', 'characters', 'good', 'points', 'convince', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad-', 'sets', 'locations', 'Mutant', 'X', 'are', 'SPECTACULAR', 'are', 'twists', 'turns', 'many', 'stories', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'are', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'fan', 'genre', 'new', 'feature', 'DVD', 'something', 'show', 'already', 'possessed-', 'slick', 'stark', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'look', 'one', 'episode', 'thought', 'had', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'Hero', 'DVD', 'machine', 'mistake-', 'good', 'people', '.By', 'episode', '10', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'extol', 'virtues', 'Mutant', 'X', 'held', 'off', ""'d"", 'watched', '22', 'episodes', 'just', 'case', 'took', 'turn', 'worse', 'descended', 'car-crash-horror', 'first', 'two', 'introductory', 'episodes', 'thankfully', 'remained', 'enjoyable', 'fresh', 'classy', 'television', 'way', 'extremely', 'shaky', 'start', 'well', 'time', 'money.Also', 'regarding', 'DVD', 'package', 'extras', 'are', 'numerous', 'appealing-', 'tons', 'outtakes', 'commentaries', 'are', 'great', 'plastic', 'case', 'cheap', 'functional', 'menus', 'are', 'quite', 'attractive', 'very', 'easy', 'use']",Mutant X - The Complete First Season

I liked X-Men and, though some saw this as a rip off of that franchise, it still was something different.  I kind of wished they'd made them natural mutants like in the Marvel universe.

That was until I found out they were releasing many dvds with a few episodes and a high price to each.  That sucked.

As soon as I have some extra cash, this set will be mine!Not the best sci-fi show out there.  But it wasn't the worst either.  Sadly this show didn't come back for a fourth year.  Maybe some other station will pick it up.  Look at the shows Sci-Fi Network has picked up and made into hits.

857495,A3T5NSG7LMRY0A,B00062IZS6,Michael Gmirkin,"[2, 9]","Okay, so this is a review of the Canadian import of Mutant X season 1. As far as the transfer goes, everything looks good insofar as picture quality goes. If has both French & English, since it's a Canadian production of the DVDs. Was it a Canadian show to begin with? Not sure. Not interested enough to find out.So, it follows the misadventures of a group of ""New Mutants"" (were there ""Old Mutants""?? Why aren't they just ""mutants,"" period? One of many questions never answered over the course of the show) headed by an ex-member of GenomeX, a bio-technology company that twiddled with their genetics and accidentally gave them all super powers.And then there's another guy who is 'evil' and now runs GenomeX as his own private army including mutants and trying to track down and eradicate mutants or put them on ice for future use/testing/etc. Honestly, his acting is so ham-fistedly hammy during this season, he might as well be a cartoon character... It's pretty laughable. He unexplainedly disappears at the start of season 2, as does most reference to GenomeX, until the start of Season 3 where he makes a couple cameos before being summarily killed off. *Shrug*Really, the whole thing is a giant *shrug* for me. There's little or not overarching story. It's a freak-of-the-week story format. New Mutant with wacky powers shows up and either gets converted to the good guys never to be heard from again or gets offed and is never heard from again. There are no sub-plots, no story arcs, just a bunch of random weekly vignettes... Everyone learns some lesson or another 'bout, you guessed it, 'teamwork' 'trust your friends' 'don't take things out of context,' all the sappy nonsense you'd get out of your typical 80's/90's cartoon series, only... 'Live action.' The action is pretty hammy too. It's the kind of cartoonish action you'd see in Charmed or Buffy. Only without the interesting storylines and ongoing drama.It doesn't feel like there's ever any character development either. We don't see the characters learn or grow at all throughout the first season, heck hardly even throughout the series.I was really hoping for more from this show. At least they got rid of some smidge of the hamminess for season 2. But the freak-of-the-week character never really went away and there was still no overarching story. By the time they were vaguely trying to START a story at the end of season 3 it was too late and the show was cancelled on something of a cliff-hanger... Kind of a shame. If they'd made a 4th season it vaguely looked like it MIGHT have started to get interesting? Ohh well.Honestly, other shows have done better by the teenage crowd looking for their episodic drama: Roswell, Buffy, Angel, Charmed, etc. Mutant X I had high hopes for. I was really hoping for something more X-men like, since it was supposedly from Marvel Studios. The end product was pretty so-so. Sorry guys. Better luck next time.",3,This show is pretty bad.

I love Brennan he's the coolest with his Electricity Powers aka as the Elemental. Then there's Emma but she had left the show in Season 3 her Psyonic powers were cool. Then comes Jesse and that new girl I forgot her name haven't seen the show lately. Then there's Shalimar I like her powers but it's not my favorite out of all these peoples. I can't wait for Season 2 and Season 3 to come out in Box Set because buying it seperate cd's costs alot of money.,5,The Show is Great,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,646,"['love', 'show', 'favorite', 'show', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'sad', 'cancelled', 'show', 'now', 'have', 'nothing', 'looking', 'forward', 'too', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'only', 'work', 'love', 'Brennan', 'coolest', 'Electricity', 'Powers', 'aka', 'Elemental', 'Then', 'Emma', 'had', 'left', 'show', 'Season', '3', 'Psyonic', 'powers', 'were', 'cool', 'Then', 'Jesse', 'new', 'girl', 'forgot', 'name', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'lately', 'Then', 'Shalimar', 'like', 'powers', 'not', 'favorite', 'peoples', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '2', 'Season', '3', 'come', 'out', 'Box', 'Set', 'buying', 'seperate', 'cd', 'costs', 'alot', 'money']",Mutant X - The Complete First Season
