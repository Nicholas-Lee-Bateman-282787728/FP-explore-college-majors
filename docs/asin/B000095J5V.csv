Things get complicated when the boys' real mother (a substance-abuser) decides she wants to come back into the picture.All things considered, this was a fairly-compelling, often humorous ""feel-good"" piece of gay cinema, achieved with a cast of mostly unknowns.  I think this would be a good addition to anyone's collection.",4,An entertaining movie w/ timely themes,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,648,"['saw', 'movie', 'benefit', 'local', 'gay/lesbian', 'film', 'festival', 'year', 'two', 'ago', 'loved', ""'m"", 'happy', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD.The', 'story', 'deals', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'want', 'child', 'are', 'conned', 'social', 'worker', 'becoming', 'foster', 'parents', 'two', 'at-risk', 'boys', 'one', 'whom', 'out', 'be', 'homophobic', 'Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'boys', 'real', 'mother', 'substance-abuser', 'come', 'back', 'picture.All', 'things', 'considered', 'was', 'fairly-compelling', 'often', 'humorous', 'feel-good', 'piece', 'gay', 'cinema', 'achieved', 'cast', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection']",Get Your Stuff

752166,A1J39MAMRGHZ5Y,B000095J5V,"giovannif7 ""giovannif7""","[26, 30]","Phil and Eric are a Beverly Hills gay couple who have it all - looks, money, friends, professional success, and a solid relationship. The next step appears to be bringing children into their family, so the couple begins the process of adopting a baby. This process is often a long, drawn out one for prospective parents (especially gay parents), which can lead to frustration. When a child caseworker friend suggests that the men take in a couple of young brothers while waiting for the baby they want, Phil and Eric agree to foster the boys &quot;just for one night.&quot; As the promised one-night-stay stretches into two nights, then three, then on and on, the two boys reveal themselves to be streetwise, somewhat homophobic, and more than a little interested in the contents of the liquor cabinet. Further complicating matters, the boys are tracked down by their mother, an alcoholic prostitute who lost custody of them. She initially wants to take the boys away from this &quot;unwholesome&quot; setting, but after witnessing the benefits of their current living situation firsthand, changes her mind and seeks a permanent place in the arrangement. The resulting stress threatens to tear the couple apart, as one partner develops a soft spot for the boys and their mother, while the other just wants them gone.The film is a solid first effort by writer/director Max Mitchell. He deftly touches upon issues including the importance of compromise and communication in a relationship, how to get through difficult stretches without self-destructing, and what it takes to make a family. As a school psychologist, I have worked with children in the foster system, as well as others in broken and highly dysfunctional homes, and the portrayals of the two boys in this film are spot-on. Their behaviors may seem outrageous and unbelievable, but when you look at the abuse and neglect such children go through all their lives, it's easy to understand that their acting out is their attempt to reject adults before they can be rejected themselves. Why would they want to start caring for and counting on another adult when that adult is just going to walk away and leave them behind soon, the way all the others have? I find &quot;Get Your Stuff&quot; to be an involving, funny, moving study of those who have a lot but are still missing something, and those who have little and just want a chance in life. If you're interested in a gay film that focuses on exploring family values from a new perspective, this is the film for you.",4,A new perspective on modern family values.,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,2528,"['Phil', 'Eric', 'are', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'looks', 'money', 'friends', 'professional', 'success', 'solid', 'relationship', 'next', 'step', 'be', 'bringing', 'children', 'family', 'couple', 'process', 'adopting', 'baby', 'process', 'often', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'one', 'prospective', 'parents', 'especially', 'gay', 'parents', 'can', 'lead', 'frustration', 'When', 'child', 'caseworker', 'friend', 'men', 'take', 'couple', 'young', 'brothers', 'waiting', 'baby', 'want', 'Phil', 'Eric', 'agree', 'foster', 'boys', 'quot', 'just', 'one', 'night.', 'quot', 'promised', 'one-night-stay', 'stretches', 'two', 'nights', 'then', 'three', 'then', 'two', 'boys', 'reveal', 'be', 'streetwise', 'somewhat', 'homophobic', 'more', 'little', 'interested', 'contents', 'liquor', 'cabinet', 'Further', 'complicating', 'matters', 'boys', 'are', 'tracked', 'down', 'mother', 'alcoholic', 'prostitute', 'who', 'lost', 'custody', 'initially', 'take', 'boys', 'away', 'quot', 'unwholesome', 'quot', 'setting', 'witnessing', 'benefits', 'current', 'living', 'situation', 'firsthand', 'mind', 'permanent', 'place', 'arrangement', 'resulting', 'stress', 'threatens', 'tear', 'couple', 'apart', 'one', 'partner', 'soft', 'spot', 'boys', 'mother', 'other', 'just', 'gone.The', 'film', 'solid', 'first', 'effort', 'writer/director', 'Max', 'Mitchell', 'deftly', 'issues', 'including', 'importance', 'compromise', 'communication', 'relationship', 'how', 'get', 'difficult', 'stretches', 'self-destructing', 'what', 'make', 'family', 'school', 'psychologist', 'have', 'worked', 'children', 'foster', 'system', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'broken', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'homes', 'portrayals', 'two', 'boys', 'film', 'are', 'spot-on', 'behaviors', 'may', 'seem', 'outrageous', 'unbelievable', 'when', 'look', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'such', 'children', 'go', 'lives', 'easy', 'understand', 'acting', 'out', 'attempt', 'reject', 'adults', 'can', 'be', 'rejected', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'start', 'caring', 'counting', 'adult', 'when', 'adult', 'just', 'going', 'walk', 'away', 'leave', 'soon', 'way', 'others', 'have', 'find', 'quot', 'Get', 'Your', 'Stuff', 'quot', 'be', 'involving', 'funny', 'moving', 'study', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'are', 'still', 'missing', 'something', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'just', 'want', 'chance', 'life', ""'re"", 'interested', 'gay', 'film', 'exploring', 'family', 'values', 'new', 'perspective', 'film']",Get Your Stuff

Well, you could get Get Your Stuff, a cute film about the good times and bad times that might happen if you mix the two mismatched ingredients above.  Farce?  No, it never reaches that state, but it is frequently funny.The story is about Phil (Cameron Watson), a couples counselor and Eric (Anthony Meindl), a lawyer.  The two want to adopt a baby (mostly it seems from the prodding of Eric's mom), and are just approved to be foster parents in the meantime.  Through some coaxing and borderline blackmailing, they agree to take in T.J. and Brian for one night.  That becomes one more night and one more and, well, you get the picture.The kids are actually decent actors and, at times, out-act the adults.  T.J. (Grady Hutt) is the optimistic one and tries to get his brother to straighten up so they can have a home.  Brian (Blayn Barbosa), on the other hand, is not as accepting and wants nothing to do with Phil and Eric until their case worker, Gloria, talks them into working the couple to make themselves more appealing.The film deals with all these problems with a light touch -- never wanting to truly offend anyone.  So they are played up for laughs; however, the message still gets through.  In fact, it takes its toll on Eric who wanted nothing more than a baby and not an entire family of problems and promptly leaves in the film's worst scene that includes Phil screaming and pulling a gun out on his clients and doing the same to Eric as he drives off.But that type of scene is, thankfully, not the norm.  Most of the picture is feel-good and enjoyable.  More so when Kimberly Scott is on the screen.  She plays Gloria with sass, determination and heart.  The movie is made better by her tough love portrayal -- especially the scenes with the kids.  There is one at the beginning of the film where the kids arrive at the house while Phil and Eric are having an anniversary party.  Brian goes for the wine and argues that kids in Europe drink it.  Gloria responds with, ""They can also speak three languages.  When you can speak three languages, then we can talk.""Get Your Stuff doesn't set the film world on fire, but it is a fun jaunt.

752176,A2MA1VI5Z5DDE9,B000095J5V,R. Force,"[3, 8]","Apparently, I can't change some potential viewer's minds about this awful film given the previous ""glowing"" reviews of it, but I can sure try.  This film isn't worth the $2.00 - $4.00 it would cost to rent much less buy.  With the exception of the woman who plays Gloria the case worker, the acting is amateurish and cliche, the writing and plot are tediously simplistic and insulting to anyone who's seen more than a couple of gay-themed films, and the humor is sophomoric. Previous reviewers of Get Your Stuff seem to be ""all a flutter"" that this film breaks new territory in the field of gay foster parenting. Unforunately, much like the current ""ground breaker"" ""Queer as Folk"" it fails on even this flimsy compliment. I'd like to suggest that if you find ""Leave it to Beaver"" or ""Father Knows Best"" as accurate portrayals of families or americans in the 1950's, than this film is right up your alley. Granted, it is a comedy, but this film tends to take itself too seriously at points to simply be  labeled as such. I have a feeling that 5 or 10 years after the subject of gay parenting or gay life in general has been more extensively dealt with, this film will be looked at much like we view the special effects pictures of the 1940's and 50's. They were acceptable for early attempts but generally laughable today.",1,Ridiculous x 2,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,1322,"['Apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'potential', 'viewer', 'minds', 'awful', 'film', 'given', 'previous', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'can', 'sure', 'try', 'film', ""n't"", 'worth', '2.00', '4.00', 'would', 'cost', 'rent', 'much', 'less', 'buy', 'exception', 'woman', 'who', 'Gloria', 'case', 'worker', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'cliche', 'writing', 'plot', 'are', 'tediously', 'simplistic', 'insulting', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'more', 'couple', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'humor', 'sophomoric', 'Previous', 'reviewers', 'Get', 'Your', 'Stuff', 'seem', 'be', 'flutter', 'film', 'new', 'territory', 'field', 'gay', 'foster', 'parenting', 'Unforunately', 'much', 'current', 'ground', 'breaker', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'even', 'flimsy', 'compliment', ""'d"", 'like', 'suggest', 'find', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'families', 'americans', '1950', 'film', 'right', 'alley', 'Granted', 'comedy', 'film', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'points', 'simply', 'be', 'labeled', 'such', 'have', 'feeling', '5', '10', 'years', 'subject', 'gay', 'parenting', 'gay', 'life', 'general', 'been', 'more', 'extensively', 'dealt', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'looked', 'much', 'view', 'special', 'effects', 'pictures', '1940', '50', 'were', 'acceptable', 'early', 'attempts', 'generally', 'laughable', 'today']",Get Your Stuff

The kids they get are challenging to say the least and it has an impact on the relationship of the couple. The nice twist is that the couple is gay and living an excellant life. No clubs, Bars, Drugs or most of the normal Hollywood trappings of gay men ( note: Both men are in great shape and do work out at the gym in the story, so one stereotype is kept.). The fact that the men are gay is not the big issue in the film, it's the way the kids address the new foster parents and the massive issues that come up with the children and the Mother of the children who arrives without calling first. The story is good, the film quality is good and it's a very clean overall movie, except the profane words the little darlings arrive with. It's worth seeing and even worth buying.
