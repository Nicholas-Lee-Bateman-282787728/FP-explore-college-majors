598785,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00005JLEW,A. Burchfield,"[1, 5]","I bought this set just to see how the series all began, it started out on a pretty good footing but has sure slipped since then.I missed the first three seasons ( most of the episodes anyway)and have found the forth (and final?) season to be so dark and depressing. First season is so much different from what Angel has since become that I actually kind of like it. I haven't got the list on hand but various episodes had so much going for them. I was surprised to see Angel operating in daylight (not in direct sunlight) so much of the time, never saw that on Buffy, and really appreciated finally understanding some of those fourth season Buffy episodes that had crossovers with Angel episodes.The one where Oz delivers that ring to Angel so that he can go out into daylight was a sort of mixed episode. I thought that James Marsters (Spike) did very well but Seth Green (Oz),while he did all right was largely wasted with hardly any screen time. Sarah Michell Gellar appeared in two episodes, the first, &quot;I will remember you&quot;(?)in which Angel become mortal but must get time turned back to better serve his mission (and Buffy's)is prehaps one of the best episodes for either of them. I even thought that the two Faith episodes were pretty good. Eliza Dushku makes a good wrong side of the tracks sort of slayer and in the second episode you see that she does in fact want to be good, something only hinted at vaguely in her Buffy appearances. Gellar was in that second episode as well, I think she did quite well too.I liked seeing the bits where Angel first met Darla and got the Gypsy curse, she kicked him out for that. Her resurrection at seasons end means I'll either have to buy season 2 this fall or hope that somebody will syndicate the older Angel episodes before then. Angel's police friend Kate Locksley (Elizabeth Rohm?)was an interesting actress, not very well used but good, sad to see how they go from an uneasy friendship to almost hatred by season's end, I want to know whatever happened there as well.",4,Started off much better than it looks like series will end,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,2032,"['bought', 'set', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'series', 'began', 'started', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'footing', 'sure', 'slipped', 'then.I', 'missed', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'most', 'episodes', 'anyway', 'have', 'found', 'forth', 'final', 'season', 'be', 'so', 'dark', 'depressing', 'First', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'different', 'what', 'Angel', 'become', 'actually', 'kind', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'list', 'hand', 'various', 'episodes', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Angel', 'operating', 'daylight', 'not', 'direct', 'sunlight', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'never', 'saw', 'Buffy', 'really', 'appreciated', 'finally', 'understanding', 'fourth', 'season', 'Buffy', 'had', 'crossovers', 'Angel', 'episodes.The', 'one', 'where', 'Oz', 'ring', 'Angel', 'so', 'can', 'go', 'out', 'daylight', 'was', 'sort', 'mixed', 'episode', 'thought', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Spike', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Oz', 'did', 'all', 'right', 'was', 'largely', 'wasted', 'hardly', 'screen', 'time', 'Sarah', 'Michell', 'Gellar', 'appeared', 'two', 'episodes', 'first', 'quot', 'will', 'remember', 'quot', 'Angel', 'become', 'mortal', 'must', 'get', 'time', 'turned', 'back', 'better', 'serve', 'mission', 'Buffy', 'prehaps', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'even', 'thought', 'two', 'Faith', 'episodes', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'good', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'sort', 'slayer', 'second', 'episode', 'see', 'fact', 'want', 'be', 'good', 'something', 'only', 'hinted', 'vaguely', 'Buffy', 'appearances', 'Gellar', 'was', 'second', 'episode', 'well', 'think', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'too.I', 'liked', 'seeing', 'bits', 'where', 'Angel', 'first', 'met', 'Darla', 'got', 'Gypsy', 'curse', 'kicked', 'out', 'resurrection', 'seasons', 'end', ""'ll"", 'either', 'have', 'buy', 'season', '2', 'fall', 'hope', 'somebody', 'will', 'syndicate', 'older', 'Angel', 'episodes', 'then', 'Angel', 'police', 'friend', 'Kate', 'Locksley', 'Elizabeth', 'Rohm', 'was', 'interesting', 'actress', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'used', 'good', 'sad', 'see', 'how', 'go', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'almost', 'hatred', 'season', 'end', 'want', 'know', 'happened', 'there', 'as', 'well']",Angel - Season One

Cordelia joins Angel (until, that is, she becomes an actress) in opening up 'Angel Investigations'.In some ways, spinning Angel off of Buffy had allowed the original show to reinvent itself, while allowing Angel to turn in a different direction and allowing the entire team (both in front & behind the camera) to move in a more original direction.The only problem is the fact that there is just too much interaction between the 'Buffy - Verse' & the 'Angel Verse'.

598787,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B00005JLEW,A. Gammill,"[2, 2]","I admit, I wasn't overwhelmed with ANGEL at first.  In fact, I remember getting a little bored during the initial half-dozen or so episodes.  Oh, I made a point to tune for the &quot;Big&quot; ones: the ones with Buffy, Spike, Faith.  In other words, I guess I wanted ANGEL to be very similar to its parent series.But looking at the entire season on these DVD's has urged me to reconsider my feelings about season one (for the record, I have really liked the subsequent seasons).  Season one of ANGEL is reminiscent of THE X-FILES, in that it's basically an anthology show with a few recurring characters.  And there were several standout episodes.  And no disrespect intended to the late Glenn Quinn, but I do feel the show took off after he departed and Wesley (Alexis Denisof, the show's best actor) joined the team.Now...Fox just has to do better with the extra features.  Each season of BUFFY on DVD has added more bonus material to the package.  There's a decent overview of season one, and a couple of brief featurettes here, but that's it.If you were initially underwhelmed with this BUFFY spinoff, I suggest you give it another look.",4,"Better than I remembered, but needs more bonus materials",1048636800,"03 26, 2003",2003,1142,"['admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'overwhelmed', 'ANGEL', 'first', 'fact', 'remember', 'getting', 'little', 'bored', 'initial', 'half-dozen', 'so', 'episodes', 'Oh', 'made', 'point', 'tune', 'quot', 'Big', 'quot', 'ones', 'ones', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'Faith', 'other', 'words', 'guess', 'wanted', 'ANGEL', 'be', 'very', 'similar', 'parent', 'series.But', 'looking', 'entire', 'season', 'DVD', 'urged', 'reconsider', 'feelings', 'season', 'one', 'record', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'Season', 'one', 'ANGEL', 'reminiscent', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'basically', 'anthology', 'show', 'few', 'recurring', 'characters', 'were', 'several', 'standout', 'episodes', 'disrespect', 'intended', 'late', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'do', 'feel', 'show', 'took', 'off', 'departed', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'show', 'best', 'actor', 'joined', 'team.Now', 'Fox', 'just', 'do', 'better', 'extra', 'features', 'season', 'BUFFY', 'DVD', 'added', 'more', 'bonus', 'material', 'package', 'decent', 'overview', 'season', 'one', 'couple', 'brief', 'featurettes', 'here', 'it.If', 'were', 'initially', 'underwhelmed', 'BUFFY', 'spinoff', 'suggest', 'give', 'look']",Angel - Season One

598789,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00005JLEW,Amanda,"[5, 9]","I hate to admit it, but I never liked Angel when he was on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Either he was the goody-goody vamp with a soul, or the ""Big Bad"" vamp without a soul. I quickly became sick and tired of his romance with Buffy, and I got sick and tired of Angel. However...On his own, Angel works VERY well. His character is way more developed in his own series, and you know what? I like him. A lot. It turns out, without Buffy around, he's still dark and brooding, but he's also got a great sense of humor, and he's just downright cuddly (you know, except for when he's killing the bad guys). I wasn't a huge fan of ""Angel"" when it first aired. I watched all of the episodes up until the character of Doyle was killed off (in episode 9, for Pete's sake), and after that, I got bored. I loved the character of Doyle, and I was angry that they got rid of him so soon. And now I think it's too bad, as everyone has pointed out, that the DVD does not acknowledge the fact that the actor who played Doyle (Glenn Quinn) actually passed away in December. Maybe it was too late for them to change his biography on the DVD, but it's a shame nonetheless. I thought Glenn Quinn was a great actor, and he was what kept me coming back each week. Now, watching those first 9 episodes all over again, especially ""Hero"", will sadden all of Doyle's (and Glenn Quinn's) devoted fans even more. However, with the release of the DVD, I thought maybe I should give ""Angel"" another chance. After all, there were about 13 episodes from that season I hadn't seen. I thought I might regret buying it, but I don't. Not at all.Like I said, Angel is a much more likeable character in his own show, and Cordelia, who was very likeable in ""Buffy"", does some growing up in the spin-off, and she's not as shallow now. Wesley shows up after Doyle's death as the replacement, and while he is an okay character, he just isn't as interesting as Doyle. I haven't seen the show since, well, episode 9 of the first season, and now I hear Angel has a teenaged son, and there are all of these other people around whom I've never seen before. According to fans, it's not as good as it was. I will have to take their word for it. All I know is that it's pretty hard to measure up to the first season.Buffy makes an appearance a couple of times, as does Oz and Faith, but the best cross-over cameo would have to be Spike in ""In the Dark"". His opening scene in that episode is worth the DVD alone. If you'd like to go back to the days when ""Angel"" was a great show, you have to get this DVD. I think Angel's first season was far more superior than Buffy's first season, but I hear it's gone downhill since. That is even more of a reason to own this. Now at least all of us Doyle fans will have something permanent to remember him by.",5,Angel Spreads His Wings,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,2794,"['hate', 'admit', 'never', 'liked', 'Angel', 'when', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'goody-goody', 'vamp', 'soul', 'Big', 'Bad', 'vamp', 'soul', 'quickly', 'became', 'sick', 'tired', 'romance', 'Buffy', 'got', 'sick', 'tired', 'Angel', 'However', 'own', 'Angel', 'VERY', 'well', 'character', 'way', 'more', 'developed', 'own', 'series', 'know', 'what', 'lot', 'out', 'Buffy', 'around', 'still', 'dark', 'brooding', 'also', 'got', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'just', 'downright', 'cuddly', 'know', 'when', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Angel', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'watched', 'episodes', 'character', 'Doyle', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'episode', '9', 'Pete', 'sake', 'got', 'bored', 'loved', 'character', 'Doyle', 'was', 'angry', 'got', 'rid', 'so', 'soon', 'now', 'think', 'too', 'bad', 'everyone', 'pointed', 'out', 'DVD', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Doyle', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'actually', 'passed', 'away', 'December', 'Maybe', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'change', 'biography', 'DVD', 'shame', 'nonetheless', 'thought', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'what', 'kept', 'coming', 'back', 'week', 'Now', 'watching', 'first', '9', 'episodes', 'over', 'again', 'especially', 'Hero', 'will', 'sadden', 'Doyle', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'devoted', 'fans', 'even', 'more', 'However', 'release', 'DVD', 'thought', 'maybe', 'should', 'give', 'Angel', 'chance', 'were', '13', 'episodes', 'season', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'thought', 'might', 'regret', 'buying', 'do', ""n't"", 'Not', 'all.Like', 'said', 'Angel', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'character', 'own', 'show', 'Cordelia', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'likeable', 'Buffy', 'growing', 'up', 'spin-off', 'not', 'shallow', 'now', 'Wesley', 'up', 'Doyle', 'death', 'replacement', 'okay', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'Doyle', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'well', 'episode', '9', 'first', 'season', 'now', 'hear', 'Angel', 'teenaged', 'son', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'According', 'fans', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'word', 'know', 'pretty', 'hard', 'measure', 'up', 'first', 'season.Buffy', 'appearance', 'couple', 'times', 'Oz', 'Faith', 'best', 'cross-over', 'cameo', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Spike', 'Dark', 'opening', 'scene', 'episode', 'DVD', 'alone', ""'d"", 'like', 'go', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'Angel', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'have', 'get', 'DVD', 'think', 'Angel', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'superior', 'Buffy', 'first', 'season', 'hear', 'gone', 'downhill', 'even', 'more', 'reason', 'own', 'Now', 'least', 'Doyle', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'something', 'permanent', 'remember']",Angel - Season One
598790,ANXWMD4TRTPXF,B00005JLEW,Amanda M. Rogers,"[6, 7]","I give this set Five Stars because the show is just that good. It is wonderful to be able to see these episodes again and watching them one right after the other, unedited is a bonus. The picture quality is better than that of any current Buffy set.  Still, this is a set you buy to watch quality television, regardless of the lack of quality extras.The episodes in this season provide some classic moments for the series as a whole. Even in the less than stellar ones, there are moments that make them worth watching, or at least having so that you can use the chapter selections  provided for each episode.  The dark tone of  S4, which just ended, was introduced in the first episode of this season. The scene in which Angel gets the blood of a dead girl on his hands is creepy and shows that Angel really is no ordinary hero.A lot of the greatness of the season is owed not just to the writing, or the characters, but to the actors who portray them. Davis Boreanaz as Angel knows how to brood and act creepy. Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase shines and brings more of her own brand of tortured funny. Glenn Quinn as Doyle is only on the show for 8 episodes, but he takes a stellar turn as a half demon who helps Angel fight the good fight while atoning for his own sins. Alexis Denisof as Wesley is wonderful as well.There is so much good to say about this season. It is a wonderful addition to any DVD collection. However...The care and attention given to the Buffy Discs is not really given here, so the extras amount to a couple of so so commentaries, the best one being the one for City of... (the pilot) by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt, the show's creators.  Also, there are a few silly little short clips highlighting Cordy and Angel that don't really bring any new or enlightening information to the table. Also missing is some indication as to what extras are found on each disc. The insert booklet is lacking in the information catergory that the Buffy S1-4 sets provide.The packaging is the same fold out design as that of other Fox sets, however, the cover art is more striking and the disc labels ditch the actors' faces in favor of a more grown-up approach by using the discs to spell out ANGEL. It gives the discs a better overall look and is oddly soothing to look at before inserting the disc into the player.This is a grown-up show that dared to be different and worked hard to separate itself from that other show about the tiny blonde girl with super strength.

598798,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JLEW,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[9, 9]","Welcome to Los Angeles, the City of Angels... or in this case, Angel and Angelus.  Buffy's (Sarah Michelle Gellar, and obviously of Buffy the Vampire Slayer) vampire-with-a-soul boyfriend has left Sunnydale in order to give Buffy a better life.  Now, he fights crime in LA; he has set up Angel Investigations, a Private Investigator for the strange and unusual.  Along with him is fellow ex-Sunnydalian Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpentar), half-demon Allen Francis Doyle (Glenn Quinn), and, after the sad death of Doyle, Faith the Vampire Slayer's old Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof).  Things start off with a case involving a very rich vampire who promises wealth and power to defenseless girls, then eats them.  He is a client of a lawfirm called Wolfram and Hart, and said firm gets a bigger and bigger role as the season goes on.  They are a special firm; many of their clients aren't even human, and the ones who are are always guilty.  They are drug lords, mafia men, and crime kingpins.  Their other clients are undead monsters, and they are led by a mysterious group called the Senior Partners.  This show, while loyal to its Buffy roots, definitely can stand on its own.  It is much darker than its predecessor; clear-cut black-and-white demons=bad is replaced with many shades of gray.  Even the theme song is darker; Buffy has a bombastic rock'n'roll riff while Angel has a creepy Celtic orchestral lament.  The characters on this show are all great.  I wish that they had kept Doyle; he was hilarious.  I also liked the direction they took Wesley in.  I didn't like him in Buffy because he was too much of a wimp.  In this show, he is able to show his true potential.  I do have, however, two minor things to bring up.  First of all, when the show began, Angel wasn't doing Angel Investigations, and even after they start it, they rarely get paid.  So how does Angel afford his nice clothes, great apartment, cool furniture, and all the bribes he makes throughout the season?  Also, has anyone noticed the similarities between this season's finale and Buffy's season 1 finale?  In the episodes right before them, Angel retrieves a source of prophecies (in Buffy, it was a book, and in this, it was a scroll).  In both shows, the prophecies foretell the death of the main character, and, in both, the prophecies come true to an extent (in Buffy, the Master kills her, but Xander revives her, and I won't reveal the secret to this season).  This season contained many great episodes, such as I Will Remember You, where Angel became human, Eternity, where an actress wanted to become a vampire to retain her youth forever (not to mention a visit from Angelus, Angel's evil alter-ego), I've Got You Under My Skin, a very creepy story about an exorcism, which had a great twist ending, and finally, the season finale, To Shanshu In LA, with the greatest twist of the entire season; the return of... sorry, not going to tell you.  If you like Buffy, there is a strong chance that you will enjoy this show as well, but be warned; as I said, this is no Buffy.",5,Angel of Mercy,1066262400,"10 16, 2003",2003,3077,"['Welcome', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'City', 'Angels', 'case', 'Angel', 'Angelus', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'obviously', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'vampire-with-a-soul', 'boyfriend', 'left', 'Sunnydale', 'order', 'give', 'Buffy', 'better', 'life', 'Now', 'crime', 'LA', 'set', 'up', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'Private', 'Investigator', 'strange', 'unusual', 'fellow', 'ex-Sunnydalian', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'Charisma', 'Carpentar', 'half-demon', 'Allen', 'Francis', 'Doyle', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'sad', 'death', 'Doyle', 'Faith', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'old', 'Watcher', 'Wesley', 'Wyndam-Pryce', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Things', 'start', 'case', 'involving', 'very', 'rich', 'vampire', 'who', 'wealth', 'power', 'defenseless', 'girls', 'then', 'client', 'lawfirm', 'called', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'said', 'firm', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'role', 'season', 'are', 'special', 'firm', 'many', 'clients', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'human', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'always', 'guilty', 'are', 'drug', 'lords', 'mafia', 'men', 'crime', 'kingpins', 'other', 'clients', 'are', 'undead', 'monsters', 'are', 'led', 'mysterious', 'group', 'called', 'Senior', 'Partners', 'show', 'loyal', 'Buffy', 'roots', 'definitely', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'much', 'darker', 'predecessor', 'clear-cut', 'black-and-white', 'demons=bad', 'replaced', 'many', 'shades', 'gray', 'Even', 'theme', 'song', 'darker', 'Buffy', 'bombastic', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'riff', 'Angel', 'creepy', 'Celtic', 'orchestral', 'lament', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'wish', 'had', 'kept', 'Doyle', 'was', 'hilarious', 'also', 'liked', 'direction', 'took', 'Wesley', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Buffy', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'wimp', 'show', 'able', 'show', 'true', 'potential', 'do', 'have', 'however', 'two', 'minor', 'things', 'bring', 'up', 'First', 'all', 'when', 'show', 'began', 'Angel', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'even', 'start', 'rarely', 'get', 'paid', 'how', 'Angel', 'afford', 'nice', 'clothes', 'great', 'apartment', 'cool', 'furniture', 'bribes', 'season', 'Also', 'anyone', 'noticed', 'similarities', 'season', 'finale', 'Buffy', 'season', '1', 'finale', 'episodes', 'right', 'Angel', 'source', 'prophecies', 'Buffy', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'scroll', 'shows', 'prophecies', 'foretell', 'death', 'main', 'character', 'prophecies', 'come', 'true', 'extent', 'Buffy', 'Master', 'Xander', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'secret', 'season', 'season', 'contained', 'many', 'great', 'episodes', 'such', 'Will', 'Remember', 'where', 'Angel', 'became', 'human', 'Eternity', 'where', 'actress', 'wanted', 'become', 'vampire', 'retain', 'youth', 'forever', 'not', 'mention', 'visit', 'Angelus', 'Angel', 'evil', 'alter-ego', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'My', 'Skin', 'very', 'creepy', 'story', 'exorcism', 'had', 'great', 'twist', 'ending', 'finally', 'season', 'finale', 'Shanshu', 'LA', 'greatest', 'twist', 'entire', 'season', 'return', 'sorry', 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'like', 'Buffy', 'strong', 'chance', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'warned', 'said', 'Buffy']",Angel - Season One
598799,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B00005JLEW,Annie Feng,"[3, 6]","as a follow up to Buffy, Angel really shines in season one. the part I like about Angel more than Buffy is that Angel is more mature than buffy and more reasonable. I wasn't really thrilled about Buffy season one, I mean it's like a-sixteen-year-old-teenager-trying-to-save-the-world. HELLO!! way toooo innocent. it's like one of those disney movies such as agent cody banks where kids are big heros and their parents don't understand them. Seen waaaayyy too many of those on disney channel. At least Angel actually has a REASON to save the world. You see in season one that Angel started by helping people from being killed by demons because he was tortured by his soul and seeking redemption, THAN it leads into that he eventually got involved with saving the world, fair enough. Whereas Buffy didn't really have a reason to save the world. In season one she already began to save the world simply because she is the Slayer. How empty is that! Angel also proves more worthy than Buffy because he simply ""Owns"" the show: he is the boss, the top of foodchain, and nothing will stop him from what needs to be done. This I liked more than Buffy.I saw in many reviews people say this season is one of the weaker seasons of Angel, and I'll have to say I disagree. In fact, I think this season is one of the best. Season one of Angel was kept simple, but true. even though many of the episodes are like monster-of-the-week, the strength is not in the adventure of killing the monsters, but in the growth of the relationships of Angel and his friends- Doyle, Cordelia and Wesley. This is the kind of season that you just sit down and laugh and enjoy without much thinking to it. So what's wrong with this simplicity??? There are some really touching episodes such as I will remember you, hero and the Faith sequence. But mainly you see Angel transformed from being totally reserved to actually starting to care about those he saved. this season is mainly about Angel trying to seek redemption and his purpose in the world, and he thinks he found it when Wesley told of the prophecy of Shanshu, which is sort of a revelation that Angel does have a place in the world instead of living forever but always cut off from it. In this season, you began to discover Angel's many unique talents which you never do in Buffy- he can draw really well, cook really well and speaks at least seven languages. It is also brilliant of Joss Whedon to show the benefits and knowledge Angel has from living 244 years- how Angel is incredibly historically and socially literate- something you never really think about when you are watching other shows which has the immortal being elements in it. The thing I love most about Angel in season one is the image and feeling Angel creates when you watch him. He makes you feel really comfortable, safe and protective, that you should never be afraid because he will always watch over you, protect you no matter what. This connects to the show's theme- That Angel is no longer ""Angel""- the demon with a face of an angel( as he is in Buffy), but Angel- the protector of innocents. Which also tides to the irony that he is actually not really safe and can turn into the altimate evil in no time. Overall, definitely five stars. This is the show you will want to watch over and over again. And this is the season that will be the promise of wonderful following seasons to come.",5,Angel is Better than Buffy!,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3391,"['follow', 'up', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'really', 'season', 'one', 'part', 'like', 'Angel', 'more', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'more', 'mature', 'buffy', 'more', 'reasonable', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'thrilled', 'Buffy', 'season', 'one', 'mean', 'a-sixteen-year-old-teenager-trying-to-save-the-world', 'HELLO', 'way', 'toooo', 'innocent', 'one', 'disney', 'movies', 'such', 'agent', 'cody', 'banks', 'where', 'kids', 'are', 'big', 'heros', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Seen', 'waaaayyy', 'too', 'many', 'disney', 'channel', 'least', 'Angel', 'actually', 'REASON', 'save', 'world', 'see', 'season', 'one', 'Angel', 'started', 'helping', 'people', 'being', 'killed', 'demons', 'was', 'tortured', 'soul', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'THAN', 'eventually', 'got', 'involved', 'saving', 'world', 'fair', 'enough', 'Whereas', 'Buffy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'reason', 'save', 'world', 'season', 'one', 'already', 'began', 'save', 'world', 'simply', 'Slayer', 'How', 'empty', 'Angel', 'also', 'more', 'worthy', 'Buffy', 'simply', 'Owns', 'show', 'boss', 'top', 'foodchain', 'nothing', 'will', 'stop', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'liked', 'more', 'Buffy.I', 'saw', 'many', 'reviews', 'people', 'say', 'season', 'one', 'weaker', 'seasons', 'Angel', ""'ll"", 'have', 'say', 'disagree', 'fact', 'think', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'Season', 'one', 'Angel', 'was', 'kept', 'simple', 'true', 'even', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'monster-of-the-week', 'strength', 'not', 'adventure', 'killing', 'monsters', 'growth', 'relationships', 'Angel', 'friends-', 'Doyle', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'kind', 'season', 'just', 'sit', 'down', 'laugh', 'enjoy', 'much', 'thinking', 'what', 'wrong', 'simplicity', 'are', 'really', 'touching', 'episodes', 'such', 'will', 'remember', 'hero', 'Faith', 'sequence', 'mainly', 'see', 'Angel', 'transformed', 'being', 'totally', 'reserved', 'actually', 'starting', 'care', 'saved', 'season', 'mainly', 'Angel', 'trying', 'seek', 'redemption', 'purpose', 'world', 'found', 'when', 'Wesley', 'told', 'prophecy', 'Shanshu', 'sort', 'revelation', 'Angel', 'have', 'place', 'world', 'instead', 'living', 'forever', 'always', 'cut', 'off', 'season', 'began', 'discover', 'Angel', 'many', 'unique', 'talents', 'never', 'do', 'Buffy-', 'can', 'draw', 'really', 'well', 'cook', 'really', 'well', 'speaks', 'least', 'seven', 'languages', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'show', 'benefits', 'knowledge', 'Angel', 'living', '244', 'years-', 'how', 'Angel', 'incredibly', 'historically', 'socially', 'literate-', 'something', 'never', 'really', 'think', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'other', 'shows', 'immortal', 'being', 'elements', 'thing', 'love', 'most', 'Angel', 'season', 'one', 'image', 'feeling', 'Angel', 'creates', 'when', 'watch', 'feel', 'really', 'comfortable', 'safe', 'protective', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'afraid', 'will', 'always', 'watch', 'protect', 'matter', 'what', 'show', 'theme-', 'Angel', 'no', 'longer', 'Angel', 'demon', 'face', 'angel', 'Buffy', 'Angel-', 'protector', 'innocents', 'Which', 'also', 'irony', 'actually', 'not', 'really', 'safe', 'can', 'turn', 'altimate', 'evil', 'time', 'Overall', 'definitely', 'five', 'stars', 'show', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'promise', 'wonderful', 'following', 'seasons', 'come']",Angel - Season One

598801,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JLEW,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","Spin offs, more often than not, are not looked upon as anything good or anywhere near as good as whatever it was it was spun off from. Very rarely is it the opposite. ""Angel"" breaks the spin off 'curse' and achieves great success well on it's own. The show is a spin off from the brilliant ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" series, that debuted in the fall of 1999. The series is about a vampire named Angel who was cursed by a group of gypsy's and has regained his soul and will forever be tortured by the memories of the horrible crimes he has comitted in the past. After three seasons on ""Buffy"", he leaves Sunnydale and heads to the city of lost souls, Los Angeles, to continue his fight for the good and to redeem himself. Things are all set up nicely in the debut episode, ""City Of"". Angel meets Doyle, a half human/demon fella who becomes Angel's mentor. He has visions that tell them who is in trouble and what exactly is going on. Cordelia Chase, from Sunnydale, has also gone to L.A. in search of becoming a famous actress. Her and Angel and Doyle form an unlikely team and set up 'Angel Investigations'. The show, unlike ""Buffy"", didn't really have an overall, season long story arc in it's first season. Those would come later. The first season fumbled around a bit trying to find it's legs. Find out what kind of show it actually is. This is why a good chunk of this first season was a basic 'person in jeopardy' story with Angel and the team as the rescuers. There are many things to like here. The show is a little grittier and darker than ""Buffy"". More tougher. The intelligent writing and sharp humor is there like on ""Buffy"". The cast is great. David Boreanaz as Angel is the most famous and charismatic vampire to ever be on television. He ranges to deep broodiness to light comedy in nothing flat. Charisma Carpenter can still deliver a sharp tongued comeback like nobody's business. Stand out episodes here include ""Rm w/a View"", where Cordelia's new apartment is haunted; ""Eternity"" is a stand out that finds Angel acting as a bodyguard to a famous actress. Things get deadly when the youth obsessed actress wants Angel to bite her to keep her young forever and her career going; ""I Will Remember You"" finds Angel being visited by Buffy herself. Thru a fight with a demon and some mixed blood, Angel turns human. He and Buffy are together. Things happen and it all changes(I won't say how or why). The remaining best episodes here are a two part episode dealing with rogue slayer Faith. She appears in ""Five By Five"" and ""Sanctuary"". These are pivotal episodes for the Faith character. It's a major turning point for her and the fans. I won't spoil it. Plus, there is the superb episode with Spike called ""In The Dark"", which is an episode destined to be a fan favorite. That episoe also includes a hilarious open teaser with Spike making fun of Angel. Because of the undecided path the show was taking, there are it's fair share of not so good episodes. The worst being ""I Fall To Pieces"", where a doctor can remove body parts to spy on victims. It's a pretty bad episode. Other non highlights include ""The Ring"", which was a sort of like a 'Fight Club' knock off, and ""She"". Halfway through the season saw the re-introduction of former watcher Wesley Windham Pryce(Alexis Denisoff), who has become a rogue demon hunter and, fortunatley, a member of the 'Angel Investigations' team. The constant thorn in Angel's side is the demonic law firm of Wolfram And Hart. They are always a constant presence, especially it's young, hot shot lawyer Lindsey McDonald(Christian Kane), and the beautiful, but evil, Lilah Morgan(Stephanie Romanov). Like ""Buffy"", the show has a constant run of recurring characters. They go from the lawyers at Wolfram And Hart, to street wise vampire hunter Gunn(J. August Richards), who is introduced in ""War Zone"" and soon becomes a series regular. ""Angel"" does what it does extremely well. It is a tightly written, directed, acted, and choreographed show that stands well on it's own outside of ""Buffy"". It probably won't reach the iconic status of the buffster, but that's okay. It has set out to be a great show that does things as best it could and it has succeeded on all fronts. Season one of ""Angel"" isn't the best season of the series(that would be season 3), but it is full of great episodes and moments and characters. It is really good, but it only gets better.

598802,A1DDSC8W1D9L6K,B00005JLEW,"""belthazaar""","[5, 5]","The title explains it all. Buffy was so well drawn, so perfectly connected. It had a tangible end to the first season, and a supporting mid-season ensemble. But the same cannot be said for Angel. I love the series, but eh first season just lacks the coherence of Buffy, something that will be made up for in later seasons of the show.The show begins off somewhat well, but not as well as Buffy. However this is quickly made right when the middle of the season hits. The mid-season episodes have power and deliverance which make Angel a must have. But the season culminates somewhat more lacking. After an awesome season, the end is weak. It just does not leave you gasping for air, begging for more. The battles within the season finale are horrible short, and disgustingly weak. The only thing that even makes the season finale worth watching is the very end. And the very end is more than likely the only reason that viewers returned for a second season. Which is what I reccomend.A lot of mental growth occurs during the first season, which is neccesary to understand Season II. And Season II is a must have. Perfect chemistry between the characters, the plots more smooth and less forced. Excellent recurring villains and you begin to finally understand the place Wolfram and Hart plays in the lives of the cast.All in all, Angel Season I is a must have simply for the sake of knowledge. I give it 3 stars, simply because of the poor quality of the begginning and end of the season, and the ease of pointing out the stunt doubles from the real actors. Other than that, watch this season.

The more juvenile themes in Buffy made sense, given the high-school-over-Hellmouth theme.  Here in Angel, we get to see how the demon-related stuff is imagined to play out among adults in the big city.Takes awhile, for the script to reach cleverness, but by Episode 6 it's in full swing.  Themes are darker, a bit more serious, and a bit too packaged.  Clearly Whedon didn't get the free reign, he had with Fox.  Pity.Acting, cast, script, etc. are all great, but the plotlines are thinner.  Less character development for the folks you don't already know from Buffy.  Even so, it's still five-star.  This is a worthwhile genre.  Just as with the Buffy series, if you are training in film or acting, you should pay close attention to all the techniques used in this series, as well.Warner Bros. was stupid to require packaged episodes, especially in Season 5, which little advanced the overall grand plotline.  So the story loses coherence beginning in Season 4 and especially in Season 5, which is rushed.  Thin ending, predictable.  Even so, still worth owning.  And again, if you're planning a career in film or TV, learn from the PRODUCER MISTAKES in Season 5, to insist on canned standalone episodes.  That makes any series boring.

By this is meant the problem dealt to stand-alone episodes by those requiring (or at least substantially benefiting from) their ""other half"" from another show  -  in this case, parent series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Angel's first season had three notable crossover stories:  one in which Angel's former helpmeet in crime, Spike, visits L.A. from Sunnydale in quest of empowering a ring that makes vampires invulnerable; another in which Buffy visits Angel once he is (temporarily) freed from the bane of sunlight and made mortal; and a third in which fallen Slayer and Buffy-nemesis Faith becomes a hit-woman hired by sinister-but-sexy Lilah Sinclair (Stephanie Romanov) for the Wolfram and Hart law firm against their thorn-in-the-side, Angel.  Each of these episodes can stand alone  -  and each, like the rest of the season, is pretty good  -  but is weakened without its ""other half"" from the fourth season of Buffy.Still, Season One is a strong contender.  The fundamentals are nicely established, with demon law firm Wolfram and Hart squaring-off against vampire-turned-good-guy Angel, who  -  encouraged by the Powers-That-Be  -  creates his own private-eye firm to help people in need.  The chemistry between David Boreanaz as Angel and Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase is notably good, right from the outset.  Both grew in their roles as the series progressed, but were strong from the start.  Nice comic touches punctuate the generally starker worldview in Angel's Los Angeles from the more youthfully humorous Sunnydale, not the least of which is ""Dennis,"" Cordelia's unexpected roommate  -  an invisible poltergeist, who gradually becomes a series fixture.The horror stories were best in the first two seasons of Angel, Season One having a couple of especially good ones:  the first features a decidedly sinister killer with the unique ability to detach his body parts and send them on assassination missions; the second finds Cordelia impregnated with a demon brood, whose birth is guaranteed to kill her.Ironically, even though missing their other halves, the best episodes of this season are the aforementioned crossovers.  Sarah Michelle Gellar guests as Buffy in the season's greatest tear-jerker, regaining her lost love Angel only to lose him again; James Marsters does his usually wonderful comico-sinister turn as the psychopathic Spike, with one of the series' best episode openers in his humorous mocking of Angel's goody-goodness; and Eliza Dushku, who never turns in a poor performance, is at her menacing  -  and, interestingly, touching  -  best in her two guest performances as fallen Slayer Faith, making her dramatic turnaround (with Angel's, and reluctantly, Buffy's help) in a bid for redemption.Overall prognosis:  hardly perfect, but damned good.",4,The Crossover Curse,1049500800,"04 5, 2003",2003,2913,"['first', 'year', 'Buffy', 'spinoff', 'Angel', 'got', 'strong', 'start', 'even', 'hampered', 'certain', 'degree', 'curse', 'crossover', 'meant', 'problem', 'dealt', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'requiring', 'least', 'substantially', 'benefiting', 'other', 'half', 'show', 'case', 'parent', 'series', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer.Angel', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'three', 'notable', 'crossover', 'stories', 'one', 'Angel', 'former', 'helpmeet', 'crime', 'Spike', 'L.A.', 'Sunnydale', 'quest', 'empowering', 'ring', 'vampires', 'invulnerable', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'once', 'temporarily', 'freed', 'bane', 'sunlight', 'made', 'mortal', 'third', 'fallen', 'Slayer', 'Buffy-nemesis', 'Faith', 'hit-woman', 'hired', 'sinister-but-sexy', 'Lilah', 'Sinclair', 'Stephanie', 'Romanov', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'law', 'firm', 'thorn-in-the-side', 'Angel', 'episodes', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'rest', 'season', 'pretty', 'good', 'weakened', 'other', 'half', 'fourth', 'season', 'Buffy.Still', 'Season', 'One', 'strong', 'contender', 'fundamentals', 'are', 'nicely', 'established', 'demon', 'law', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'squaring-off', 'vampire-turned-good-guy', 'Angel', 'who', 'encouraged', 'Powers-That-Be', 'own', 'private-eye', 'firm', 'help', 'people', 'need', 'chemistry', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Angel', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'notably', 'good', 'right', 'outset', 'grew', 'roles', 'series', 'progressed', 'were', 'strong', 'start', 'Nice', 'comic', 'touches', 'punctuate', 'generally', 'starker', 'worldview', 'Angel', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'more', 'youthfully', 'humorous', 'Sunnydale', 'not', 'least', 'Dennis', 'Cordelia', 'unexpected', 'roommate', 'invisible', 'poltergeist', 'who', 'gradually', 'series', 'fixture.The', 'horror', 'stories', 'were', 'best', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Angel', 'Season', 'One', 'having', 'couple', 'especially', 'good', 'ones', 'first', 'decidedly', 'sinister', 'killer', 'unique', 'ability', 'detach', 'body', 'parts', 'send', 'assassination', 'missions', 'second', 'finds', 'Cordelia', 'impregnated', 'demon', 'brood', 'birth', 'guaranteed', 'kill', 'her.Ironically', 'even', 'missing', 'other', 'halves', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'aforementioned', 'crossovers', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'guests', 'Buffy', 'season', 'greatest', 'tear-jerker', 'regaining', 'lost', 'love', 'Angel', 'only', 'lose', 'again', 'James', 'Marsters', 'usually', 'wonderful', 'comico-sinister', 'turn', 'psychopathic', 'Spike', 'one', 'series', 'best', 'episode', 'openers', 'humorous', 'mocking', 'Angel', 'goody-goodness', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'who', 'never', 'poor', 'performance', 'menacing', 'interestingly', 'touching', 'best', 'two', 'guest', 'performances', 'fallen', 'Slayer', 'Faith', 'making', 'dramatic', 'turnaround', 'Angel', 'reluctantly', 'Buffy', 'help', 'bid', 'redemption.Overall', 'prognosis', 'hardly', 'perfect', 'damned', 'good']",Angel - Season One

Even though Angelus is evil, he somehow comes out more lighthearted like Buffy. This season, is great. With some great episodes, along with some, not so great.City Of: 10/10 Great starting episode. Introduces Doyle, then Angel meets Cordelia at a party. Special guest star Tracy Middendorf as Tina.Lonely Heart: 6/10 Worst episode of Angel that I've seen. It's  a really weird demon who eviscerates its victims.In The Dark: 10/10 Spike comes to LA searching for the gem of amara. Oz brings it to Angel and he hides it! Spike has a partner this time, who screws him over in the end, it's funny!I Fall To Pieces: 9.5/10 A crazy pshyco hunts his girlfriend down by using different pieces of his body. Really gross, but it's interesting.Room With A View: 8.5/10 I didn't like this one very much. Cordelia absolutely rocks in this episode, and the whole season. Cordelia gets a room with a ghost of a mother who lived there about 50 years ago. She killed her son, Dennis. Ghost Dennis ends up living with Cordelia after they kill the evil mother.Sense and Sensitivity: 9/10 Fairly good episode. Someone hunts down Kate, pretty coo!!The Bachelor Party: 9/10 Welcome back, the guy who plays Ken in Buffy episode, Anne, season 3, episode 1, plays another supposively friendly demon, who tries to have Doyle for dinner.I Will Remember You: 10/10 Sarah Michelle Gellar returns as, well, you know who. Angel fights a demon, becomes human. Then, finds out it will kill Buffy if he remains that way, so he takes back the day, and kills the mighty warrior. I'm not a big fan of the whole Buffy/Angel, I just think Angel is a vampire, and he's dead. His life's over, he doesn't need anyone. Buffy, on the other hand, the only person that ever seemed right for her, would never happen. You all know I'm talking about Xander, hopefully!Hero: 10/10 The Warrior said for soldiers of darkness were coming, bingo. Doyle sacrifices himself in the end. Really sad but good episode!!Parting Gifts: 9.5/10 Wesley returns as a rogue-demon hunter. A supposively friendly demon is being tracked by a good demon, who is being tracked by Wesley. The Good-demon is killed by Angel and Wesley, by accident. Then, the evil demon, who's telepathic, takes Cordelia hostage.Somnambulist: 9.5/10 Good job, an old friend of Angelus, is back! Killing like Angelus!Expecting: 8/10 Cordelia has the baby for a giant demon. I didn't like this one too much, but it was fairly good though!She: 9/10 I just love the parts where you get to see Angel and Wesley dancing, it's so funny. There such horrible dancers!!I've Got You Under My Skin: 9.5/10 This one was well done. A demon gets trapped in a boys body. The demon is using everything possible to say ""Help, get me out of this body!"" Because, the boy is even more evil!The Prodigal: 9.5/10 Kate's father is killed by vampires. Angel tries to help but he can't come in, because he isn't invited.The Ring: 9.5/10 Angel becomes gladiator, with a bunch of demons. Then, Wesley and Cordelia find a solution to get Angel out!!Eternity: 10/10 The 3rd best episode of the season. I Will Remember You, and In The Dark follow this. When, a famous actress named Rebecca finds out her stalker was her boss who just was trying to get her the part. He doesn't succeed. Rebecca decides she wants to have eternal life, she puts something in Angel's drink that'll give him pure happiness, but only temporary. Of course, this brings out Angelus who tries to murder her, and when all is better, Angel is no longer her protector. Also, I love the part where Angelus immitates Cordelia's acting, it's so funny!!Five By Five: 10/10 The 2nd best episode of the season. Faith comes to LA. She captures Wesley, tortures him for a while, Angel shows up, they battle. Angel talks her down to, ""Please, just kill me!"" Wesley comes down to find Angel and Faith hugging, he drops the knife. Great episode!Santuary: 10/10 The best episode of the season. Faith is now Angel's guest at his house. W&H; is extremely upset, send a demon to kill Faith, Faith kills the demon, with some help from Angel, then they hug just in time to see Buffy standing on Angel's steps. The 3 member of the council, elite team are in LA. Seeking help from Wesley, Wesley faked being on there side,""I didn't do it for her. I did it because I trust you.

I only gave it 4 stars because the second season blows it out of the water.The first season seemed to only loosely link each episode together, instead of the serial format of Buffy.

598814,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00005JLEW,calvinnme,"[0, 0]","Season one of Angel takes several twists and turns throughout the season as the show seems to seek a format and a group dynamic among the various characters that works. But even in what seems like unevenness, the genius of Joss Whedon & company shines through. The show starts out with Angel seeking a new life in L.A. trying to put emotional and actual physical distance between himself and Buffy so that she can go on with her life without him constantly being in the shadows. He is guided into what is to become his mission by half human/half demon Doyle who is always living on the edge in a somewhat haphazard existence himself. The two unite with Cordelia Chase who has moved from Sunnydale to LA to seek an acting career - and is starving in the process - to start a supernatural detective agency to ""help the helpless"". The second episode introduces L.A. police officer Kate Lockley who is a recurring character throughout the season, and who is ambiguous in her attitude towards Angel, especially when she finds out who and what he truly is.The season starts out in ""monster of the week"" format with no episode truly tied to another which is quite the opposite of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, from which the show was spun off. However, towards the end of the season, it can be seen that this formula is gradually being abandoned. Other changes that take place include the death of Doyle and the introduction of Wesley Wyndham-Price as a main character in episodes 9 and 10, respectively. You may remember Wesley as Faith's failed watcher from season three of Buffy. Before Doyle dies, however, he gives Cordelia a ""parting gift"" that drastically effects her character development throughout the series. Although the entire season is excellent, it really hits its stride starting with the two parter in which Faith appears in L.A. after wreaking havoc in Sunnydale after awakening from her coma.Next, the interesting character of Charles Gunn is introduced - a street kid who is protecting other street kids from vampires while trying to manage a meager existence. Finally, the best two episodes of the season in my opinion are when Lindsay - lawyer for evil law firm Wolfram & Hart - has a crisis of conscience about an upcoming contract killing he has advanced knowledge of and joins forces with Angel to stop it. Then, in the next episode, he does an about face and rejoins Wolfram & Hart to help destroy Angel and his friends. The last scenes of the last episode will make you want to go on and view season two when you see what Wolfram & Hart has resurrected in ""the box"".",5,Excellent start to a great series,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,2582,"['Season', 'one', 'Angel', 'several', 'twists', 'season', 'show', 'seek', 'format', 'group', 'various', 'characters', 'even', 'what', 'unevenness', 'genius', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'company', 'show', 'out', 'Angel', 'seeking', 'new', 'life', 'L.A.', 'trying', 'put', 'emotional', 'actual', 'physical', 'distance', 'Buffy', 'can', 'go', 'life', 'constantly', 'being', 'shadows', 'guided', 'what', 'become', 'mission', 'half', 'human/half', 'demon', 'Doyle', 'who', 'always', 'living', 'edge', 'somewhat', 'haphazard', 'existence', 'two', 'unite', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'who', 'moved', 'Sunnydale', 'LA', 'seek', 'acting', 'career', 'starving', 'process', 'start', 'supernatural', 'detective', 'agency', 'help', 'helpless', 'second', 'episode', 'introduces', 'L.A.', 'police', 'officer', 'Kate', 'Lockley', 'who', 'recurring', 'character', 'season', 'who', 'ambiguous', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Angel', 'especially', 'when', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'truly', 'is.The', 'season', 'out', 'monster', 'week', 'format', 'episode', 'truly', 'tied', 'quite', 'opposite', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'show', 'was', 'spun', 'off', 'However', 'end', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'formula', 'gradually', 'being', 'abandoned', 'Other', 'changes', 'take', 'place', 'include', 'death', 'Doyle', 'introduction', 'Wesley', 'Wyndham-Price', 'main', 'character', 'episodes', '9', '10', 'respectively', 'may', 'remember', 'Wesley', 'Faith', 'failed', 'watcher', 'season', 'three', 'Buffy', 'Doyle', 'dies', 'however', 'Cordelia', 'parting', 'gift', 'drastically', 'effects', 'character', 'development', 'series', 'entire', 'season', 'excellent', 'really', 'stride', 'starting', 'two', 'parter', 'Faith', 'L.A.', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'Sunnydale', 'awakening', 'coma.Next', 'interesting', 'character', 'Charles', 'Gunn', 'introduced', 'street', 'kid', 'who', 'protecting', 'other', 'street', 'kids', 'vampires', 'trying', 'manage', 'meager', 'existence', 'Finally', 'best', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'opinion', 'are', 'when', 'Lindsay', 'lawyer', 'evil', 'law', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'upcoming', 'contract', 'killing', 'advanced', 'knowledge', 'joins', 'forces', 'Angel', 'stop', 'Then', 'next', 'episode', 'face', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'help', 'destroy', 'Angel', 'friends', 'last', 'scenes', 'last', 'episode', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'view', 'season', 'two', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'resurrected', 'box']",Angel - Season One

598817,A21VGNU5959O85,B00005JLEW,CaterpillarGirl,"[1, 3]","Being a huge ginormous Buffy the vampire slayer fan, I knew that I had to purchase the Angel series as well. Angel was never one of my favorite characters. I always thought he needed more screen time, his story his struggle went way beyond what the Buffy universe could offer him. He was a vampire with a soul, cursed to never know true love or else become all chompy again. His return to being Angelus was his high point in my opinion, because then he was sent to ""hell"" by Buffy just as he gained his soul back. His return from Hell, led to the Angel we know in his own series, a man who is in search for redemption through helping others. He breaks from Buffy, because after all their relationship is futile, and therefore he is forced to form bonds with other beings in order to fight the good fight.This brings him to LA, A city in need of rescuing if there ever was one. The beginning of season one, was extremely shaky. I really felt like Joss was trying too hard to separate Angel from the Scoobieworld. It felt like ""Underworld Matlock"" to me. I know Joss was going for a darker, Film Noir look because Angel after all is 200 plus years old, angst and guilt ridden, and LA is no Sunnydale.  We are introduced to Doyle, who becomes Angel's link to the ""powers that be"" through his gift of visions. Doyle is a flawed sidekick, smart mouthed but sweet, half demon but all feelings, we like him for different reasons as Angels right hand man, than we like Willow for her role as Buffy's slayer mate. We get Cordelia back, as a struggling broke actress who feels the need to latch onto Angel and his quest for redemption. I always loved Cordelia because she was so straightforward, brutally honest, and you really got a sense of loss with her over her family's downward spiral from rich to poor. Plus Charisma Carpenter is gorgeous, and fits right in with the beautiful people of LA.Angel, Cordelia and Doyle open up ""Angel investigations"" which has an open door policy for anyone in need, especially anyone with a supernatural, paranormal, demonic, or otherworldly problem. Doyle's visions give them a heads up, Cordelias effervescent charm and organization skills give them credit, and Angel's knack for defeating Evil and saving the downtrodden gives them success. By the 6th episode it feels like the series gains some footing and is now on its way to being a well oiled machine. Of course there is the visit from Buffy (what spin off doesn't try to boost its ratings with the reach around?) and it really is a turning point for both Angel ""getting over"" Buffy and moving on with his mission and the Fans who still were holding on to the doomed romance to be magically undoomed.  The ninth episode ""Hero"" is the hardest one to watch for me personally, knowing that the actor playing Doyle dies unexpectedly in real life; you get the feeling that the writers had to scramble to keep the original storyline going, while also honoring what Doyle meant to the overall picture. Cordelia is now, through Doyle's quick thinking, the link to the Powers that Be, and it works out without being too obvious. We now get Wesley back, as a rogue demon hunter who bumbles around but then, like the rest of them, gains his footing through helping the helpless and using his skills as a former watcher to become a valued corroborator to the Angel Investigation team.The rest of the season, after Doyle's death and after Wesley's entrance is a smooth, well written, well acted dramatic series. It holds its own and is a welcome ""grown up"" change from BTVS. You get the demons, and monsters, and gods and goddesses and bad guys, but they don't try to go about it all through the same old jokes, patterns and formula. I cannot wait to watch the second season.",5,Angel Holds its Own.,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,3748,"['Being', 'huge', 'ginormous', 'Buffy', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'fan', 'knew', 'had', 'purchase', 'Angel', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Angel', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'always', 'thought', 'needed', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'story', 'struggle', 'went', 'way', 'what', 'Buffy', 'universe', 'could', 'offer', 'was', 'vampire', 'soul', 'cursed', 'never', 'know', 'true', 'love', 'else', 'become', 'chompy', 'again', 'return', 'being', 'Angelus', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'opinion', 'then', 'was', 'sent', 'hell', 'Buffy', 'just', 'gained', 'soul', 'back', 'return', 'Hell', 'led', 'Angel', 'know', 'own', 'series', 'man', 'who', 'search', 'redemption', 'helping', 'others', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'futile', 'therefore', 'forced', 'form', 'bonds', 'other', 'beings', 'order', 'fight', 'good', 'fight.This', 'LA', 'A', 'city', 'need', 'rescuing', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'beginning', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'extremely', 'shaky', 'really', 'felt', 'Joss', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'separate', 'Angel', 'Scoobieworld', 'felt', 'Underworld', 'Matlock', 'know', 'Joss', 'was', 'going', 'darker', 'Film', 'Noir', 'look', 'Angel', '200', 'plus', 'years', 'old', 'angst', 'guilt', 'ridden', 'LA', 'Sunnydale', 'are', 'introduced', 'Doyle', 'who', 'Angel', 'link', 'powers', 'be', 'gift', 'visions', 'Doyle', 'flawed', 'sidekick', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'sweet', 'half', 'demon', 'feelings', 'like', 'different', 'reasons', 'Angels', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'like', 'Willow', 'role', 'Buffy', 'slayer', 'mate', 'get', 'Cordelia', 'back', 'struggling', 'broke', 'actress', 'who', 'need', 'latch', 'Angel', 'quest', 'redemption', 'always', 'loved', 'Cordelia', 'was', 'so', 'straightforward', 'brutally', 'honest', 'really', 'got', 'sense', 'loss', 'family', 'downward', 'spiral', 'rich', 'poor', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'gorgeous', 'fits', 'right', 'beautiful', 'people', 'LA.Angel', 'Cordelia', 'Doyle', 'open', 'up', 'Angel', 'investigations', 'open', 'door', 'policy', 'anyone', 'need', 'especially', 'anyone', 'supernatural', 'paranormal', 'demonic', 'otherworldly', 'problem', 'Doyle', 'visions', 'give', 'heads', 'up', 'Cordelias', 'effervescent', 'charm', 'organization', 'skills', 'give', 'credit', 'Angel', 'knack', 'defeating', 'Evil', 'saving', 'downtrodden', 'success', '6th', 'episode', 'series', 'gains', 'footing', 'now', 'way', 'being', 'well', 'oiled', 'machine', 'course', 'visit', 'Buffy', 'what', 'spin', 'off', ""n't"", 'try', 'boost', 'ratings', 'reach', 'really', 'turning', 'point', 'Angel', 'getting', 'over', 'Buffy', 'moving', 'mission', 'Fans', 'who', 'still', 'were', 'holding', 'doomed', 'romance', 'be', 'magically', 'undoomed', 'ninth', 'episode', 'Hero', 'hardest', 'one', 'watch', 'personally', 'knowing', 'actor', 'playing', 'Doyle', 'dies', 'unexpectedly', 'real', 'life', 'get', 'feeling', 'writers', 'had', 'scramble', 'keep', 'original', 'storyline', 'going', 'also', 'honoring', 'what', 'Doyle', 'meant', 'overall', 'picture', 'Cordelia', 'now', 'Doyle', 'quick', 'thinking', 'link', 'Powers', 'Be', 'out', 'being', 'too', 'obvious', 'now', 'get', 'Wesley', 'back', 'rogue', 'demon', 'hunter', 'who', 'around', 'then', 'rest', 'gains', 'footing', 'helping', 'helpless', 'using', 'skills', 'former', 'watcher', 'become', 'valued', 'corroborator', 'Angel', 'Investigation', 'team.The', 'rest', 'season', 'Doyle', 'death', 'Wesley', 'entrance', 'smooth', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'dramatic', 'series', 'own', 'welcome', 'grown', 'up', 'change', 'BTVS', 'get', 'demons', 'monsters', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'go', 'same', 'old', 'jokes', 'patterns', 'formula', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'watch', 'second', 'season']",Angel - Season One

It's a wonderful thing to see a spin-off that successfully creates a unique world where the characters have evolved and matured and are ready for totally new experiences.

In this season Angel discovers skills he had not explored before. That's a big deal for an old immortal, and a big hoot for old fans of Buffy. If your favorite part of Buffy was the depth and darkness of the multi-layered demon characters and the often sarcastic, always funny, tell-it-like-it-is Cordelia Chase, then you will love this first season of Angel.

This season took some adjusting to because you already have some characters like Angel and Cordelia pinned down in your head in a certain way.  Also, the show is much much different from Buffy.  Nonetheless, I am totally HOOKED!  If you love Angel, I recommend purchasing this series because you really get to know him as a character and explore the mystery he leaves for us on Buffy.

598825,AUPYKCIQEITAS,B00005JLEW,Cinephile,"[5, 5]","Two images dominate the first season of ANGEL:  The first (later to be caught as the final image in the show's credits) shows our titular hero-- a vampire with a soul who fights for good in order to atone for past sins--staking two vampires and stalking off into the night, his long leather duster swirling behind him. Framed by a dirty, shadow-strewn alley, Angel seems the embodiment of Raymond Chandler's noir detective, ""down these streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is not himself tarnished nor afraid....He is a lonely man and his pride is that  you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry that you ever saw him.""  The second, quite different image is distinctively UN-proud, as Angel imagines himself dancing at a friend's party. David Boreanez, who plays Angel, is shown doing...well, the dorkiest dance ever, full of arhythmic arm movements, regrettable hip sways, and a positively marmaduke-like tongue flapping through his lips. Flashing back to reality, Angel says, completely deadpan, ""I don't dance.""  Somewhere between those two images-- the first full of epic darkness and danger, the second oozing humorous satire-- lies the tone of this BUFFY spinoff's first year. It's far more ""stand-alone"" in its episodic structure than the next three years will be, and there's clearly a lot of feeling around going on, as co-creators Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt and their cast try to figure out the beat of this new song they're playing. I give it four stars because there are still an extraordinary number of high-quality episodes on display here (particularly those involving Angel's first partner, Doyle), and because I think it's fascinating to watch talented people go through creative growing pains in public.  ANGEL has often been treated like that dorky dancer at the party-- you smile politely, eke out a wan compliment or two on its behalf, and quickly try to find the cool kids at the TV party (Dawson, is that you?). Its network, the WB, never quite knew what to do with the show, changing its airtime several times and eventually canceling the program despite an uptick in ratings. Even fans of BUFFY have sometimes treated ANGEL like the stepkid, the Dawn of the Buffyverse. This is a shame, because ANGEL, even in this slightly less focused first season, has always offered as much bang for the buck as Buffy (and, in seasons two and three, surpasses its parent in quality).  After reaching a perfect closure to its first, high-school based half, BUFFY saw the departure of three seemingly minor figures at the end of season three-- Cordelia, the sarcastic school princess, forced to work as a secretary after her parents were indicted on tax fraud; Wesley, the oafish Watcher who generally caused as much trouble as he prevented; and Angel, of course, Buffy's paramour/arch enemy. OK, that last one is not minor, but really, his Buffy storyline was pretty much wrapped up. He moved on, as did the other two, winding up in LA, where he opened a supernatural detective agency and, aided by Cordelia, Wesley, and the mysterious, vision-prone Doyle, fought the demons and lawyers (but I repeat myself) Chandler never would have dream ed of.  Yes, it sounds goofy. So does BUFFY, if you boil it down to a couple of sentences. So does the SOPRANOS. And the SIMPSONS. And the WEST WING. And THE LITTLEST GROOM. (OK, that last one I'll give you). It's not about plot, it's about execution, and in the hands of Whedon and Greenwalt, two of TV's best writers, ANGEL blossoms, as Boreanez, Charisma Carpenter, Glenn Quinn and Alexis Denisof all flesh out potentially hazardous stereotypes (Carpenter, in particular, is a comic delight) and help to tell stand-alone tales of tremendous adventure, horror, humor and grace.  Grace is the most important quality, both for Angel, the character (seeking redemption) and ANGEL, the show (offering a spirit of generosity to character and genre rare for TV). The result is perhaps best summed up by Raymond Chandler, if we imagine him speaking of television shows: ""If there were enough like him, the world would be a very safe place to live in, without becoming too dull to be worth living in.""",4,dark knights and dancin' fools,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,4175,"['Two', 'images', 'dominate', 'first', 'season', 'ANGEL', 'first', 'later', 'be', 'caught', 'final', 'image', 'show', 'credits', 'titular', 'hero', 'vampire', 'soul', 'who', 'good', 'order', 'atone', 'past', 'sins', 'staking', 'two', 'vampires', 'stalking', 'off', 'night', 'long', 'leather', 'duster', 'swirling', 'Framed', 'dirty', 'shadow-strewn', 'alley', 'Angel', 'embodiment', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'noir', 'detective', 'streets', 'man', 'must', 'go', 'who', 'not', 'mean', 'who', 'not', 'tarnished', 'afraid', '.He', 'lonely', 'man', 'pride', 'will', 'treat', 'proud', 'man', 'be', 'very', 'sorry', 'ever', 'saw', 'second', 'quite', 'different', 'image', 'distinctively', 'UN-proud', 'Angel', 'dancing', 'friend', 'party', 'David', 'Boreanez', 'who', 'Angel', 'shown', 'doing', 'well', 'dorkiest', 'dance', 'ever', 'full', 'arhythmic', 'arm', 'movements', 'regrettable', 'hip', 'sways', 'positively', 'marmaduke-like', 'tongue', 'flapping', 'lips', 'Flashing', 'back', 'reality', 'Angel', 'completely', 'deadpan', 'do', ""n't"", 'dance', 'Somewhere', 'two', 'images', 'first', 'full', 'epic', 'darkness', 'danger', 'second', 'oozing', 'humorous', 'satire', 'tone', 'BUFFY', 'spinoff', 'first', 'year', 'far', 'more', 'stand-alone', 'episodic', 'structure', 'next', 'three', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'clearly', 'lot', 'feeling', 'around', 'going', 'co-creators', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'David', 'Greenwalt', 'cast', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'beat', 'new', 'song', ""'re"", 'playing', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'are', 'still', 'extraordinary', 'number', 'high-quality', 'episodes', 'display', 'here', 'particularly', 'involving', 'Angel', 'first', 'partner', 'Doyle', 'think', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'talented', 'people', 'go', 'creative', 'growing', 'pains', 'public', 'ANGEL', 'often', 'been', 'treated', 'dorky', 'dancer', 'party', 'smile', 'politely', 'out', 'wan', 'compliment', 'two', 'behalf', 'quickly', 'try', 'find', 'cool', 'kids', 'TV', 'party', 'Dawson', 'network', 'WB', 'never', 'quite', 'knew', 'what', 'do', 'show', 'changing', 'airtime', 'several', 'times', 'eventually', 'canceling', 'program', 'uptick', 'ratings', 'Even', 'fans', 'BUFFY', 'have', 'sometimes', 'treated', 'ANGEL', 'stepkid', 'Dawn', 'Buffyverse', 'shame', 'ANGEL', 'even', 'slightly', 'less', 'focused', 'first', 'season', 'always', 'offered', 'much', 'bang', 'buck', 'Buffy', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'parent', 'quality', 'reaching', 'perfect', 'closure', 'first', 'high-school', 'based', 'half', 'BUFFY', 'saw', 'departure', 'three', 'seemingly', 'minor', 'figures', 'end', 'season', 'three', 'Cordelia', 'sarcastic', 'school', 'princess', 'forced', 'work', 'secretary', 'parents', 'were', 'indicted', 'tax', 'fraud', 'Wesley', 'oafish', 'Watcher', 'who', 'generally', 'caused', 'much', 'trouble', 'prevented', 'Angel', 'course', 'Buffy', 'paramour/arch', 'enemy', 'OK', 'last', 'one', 'not', 'minor', 'really', 'Buffy', 'storyline', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'wrapped', 'up', 'moved', 'did', 'other', 'two', 'winding', 'up', 'LA', 'where', 'opened', 'supernatural', 'detective', 'agency', 'aided', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'mysterious', 'vision-prone', 'Doyle', 'fought', 'demons', 'lawyers', 'repeat', 'Chandler', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'dream', 'ed', 'Yes', 'goofy', 'So', 'BUFFY', 'boil', 'down', 'couple', 'sentences', 'So', 'SOPRANOS', 'SIMPSONS', 'WEST', 'WING', 'LITTLEST', 'GROOM', 'OK', 'last', 'one', ""'ll"", 'give', 'not', 'plot', 'execution', 'hands', 'Whedon', 'Greenwalt', 'two', 'TV', 'best', 'writers', 'ANGEL', 'blossoms', 'Boreanez', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'flesh', 'out', 'potentially', 'hazardous', 'stereotypes', 'Carpenter', 'particular', 'comic', 'delight', 'help', 'tell', 'stand-alone', 'tales', 'tremendous', 'adventure', 'horror', 'humor', 'grace', 'Grace', 'most', 'important', 'quality', 'Angel', 'character', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'ANGEL', 'show', 'offering', 'spirit', 'generosity', 'character', 'genre', 'rare', 'TV', 'result', 'perhaps', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'imagine', 'speaking', 'television', 'shows', 'were', 'enough', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'safe', 'place', 'live', 'becoming', 'too', 'dull', 'be', 'worth', 'living']",Angel - Season One

598828,A398FD7XNE6ISZ,B00005JLEW,Dave Beards,"[40, 43]","It cannot be denied that the TV series 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' has become a massive worldwide cult phenomenon. Based on an unsuccessful movie, Joss Whedon turned the whole 'blonde air head turned fighter of all things evil' concept into a massively successful franchise that spans everything from DVD's, comic books to figurines. So what usually happens with successful American TV shows?? They create a spin off series!!!! In this case, we see Angel (Vampire with a soul) be cast into the night light of LA at the end of season 3 to get away from his love for the Slayer and to seek redemption for his past evil doings.In LA he soon meets up with Doyle - half man/half demon who possessess a link to 'the powers that be' and is Angel's link to saving the human souls of LA. Cordelia, seeking Hollywood fame and fortune, joins the team and they set up a detective agency with the slogan 'we help the helpless'.In stark contrast to Buffy, the overall tone of Angel is very dark. Whilst still retaining Joss Whedon's characteristic humour, Angel is very much a show aimed at the adult market.In season 1 Angel is essentially episodic in nature, with cases solved on a week by week basis. However, just when Angel seems to be developing into the standard cop-show formula, story lines divulge to incorporate ghosts, possessions, the evil Law Company that is 'Wolfram and Hart' and sudden cast changes. Though in season 1 we see very little story arching over the season, with season 1 apparently being a means to set up and justify Angel being in LA.To help season 1 along, several crossovers occur with Buffy season 4 - Spike, Oz, Faith and Buffy herself make an appearance to add further interest and appeal and to increase the development of Angel as a show and a character.David Boreanaz shines as Angel. His characterisation in the early Buffy episodes could be describes as 'raw', but here he has developed the character to make it strong and believable to hold a show on his own. When the evil Angelus makes an appearance he truly is evil. Cordelia starts off being her usual flighty self but by seasons end we see her character develop significantly as well.The DVD is presented in a beautiful fold out box adorned with the usual photography of the cast. The picture quality is good, but not exceptional. Considering the amount of night time shots though, it is better than what we see through normal TV reception. Two audio commentaries give us insights into the whole Angel concept as well as production techniques. The several featurettes included give an insight into the background of Angel and the production side. Whilst the featurettes ""I'm Cordelia, The Demons and I'm Angel"" are full of interesting trivia, it is the lengthy 'Introducing Angel' where the concepts of the show and character are discussed in detail.Season 1 is a great introduction to the big bad world of LA, and Angel's place within it. Whilst subsequent series delve deeper into character development and improve on the story arching, the first season is not to be missed.",5,Excellent first season of an innovative TV show....,1054944000,"06 7, 2003",2003,3058,"['can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'TV', 'series', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'become', 'massive', 'worldwide', 'cult', 'phenomenon', 'Based', 'unsuccessful', 'movie', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'turned', 'whole', 'air', 'head', 'turned', 'fighter', 'things', 'evil', 'concept', 'massively', 'successful', 'franchise', 'everything', 'DVD', 'comic', 'books', 'figurines', 'So', 'what', 'usually', 'successful', 'American', 'TV', 'shows', 'create', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'case', 'see', 'Angel', 'Vampire', 'soul', 'be', 'cast', 'night', 'light', 'LA', 'end', 'season', '3', 'get', 'away', 'love', 'Slayer', 'seek', 'redemption', 'past', 'evil', 'doings.In', 'LA', 'soon', 'up', 'Doyle', 'half', 'man/half', 'demon', 'who', 'link', ""'the"", 'powers', 'be', 'Angel', 'link', 'saving', 'human', 'souls', 'LA', 'Cordelia', 'seeking', 'Hollywood', 'fame', 'fortune', 'team', 'set', 'up', 'detective', 'agency', 'slogan', 'help', ""helpless'.In"", 'stark', 'contrast', 'Buffy', 'overall', 'tone', 'Angel', 'very', 'dark', 'Whilst', 'still', 'retaining', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'characteristic', 'humour', 'Angel', 'very', 'much', 'show', 'aimed', 'adult', 'market.In', 'season', '1', 'Angel', 'essentially', 'episodic', 'nature', 'cases', 'solved', 'week', 'week', 'basis', 'However', 'just', 'when', 'Angel', 'be', 'developing', 'standard', 'cop-show', 'formula', 'story', 'lines', 'divulge', 'incorporate', 'ghosts', 'possessions', 'evil', 'Law', 'Company', ""'Wolfram"", 'Hart', 'sudden', 'cast', 'changes', 'season', '1', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'arching', 'season', 'season', '1', 'apparently', 'being', 'means', 'set', 'up', 'justify', 'Angel', 'being', 'LA.To', 'help', 'season', '1', 'along', 'several', 'crossovers', 'occur', 'Buffy', 'season', '4', 'Spike', 'Oz', 'Faith', 'Buffy', 'make', 'appearance', 'add', 'further', 'interest', 'appeal', 'increase', 'development', 'Angel', 'show', 'character.David', 'Boreanaz', 'shines', 'Angel', 'characterisation', 'early', 'Buffy', 'episodes', 'could', 'be', 'describes', ""'raw"", 'here', 'developed', 'character', 'make', 'strong', 'believable', 'hold', 'show', 'own', 'When', 'evil', 'Angelus', 'appearance', 'truly', 'evil', 'Cordelia', 'being', 'usual', 'flighty', 'self', 'seasons', 'end', 'see', 'character', 'develop', 'significantly', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'presented', 'beautiful', 'fold', 'out', 'box', 'adorned', 'usual', 'photography', 'cast', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'not', 'exceptional', 'Considering', 'amount', 'night', 'time', 'shots', 'better', 'what', 'see', 'normal', 'TV', 'reception', 'Two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'give', 'insights', 'whole', 'Angel', 'concept', 'as', 'well', 'production', 'techniques', 'several', 'featurettes', 'included', 'give', 'insight', 'background', 'Angel', 'production', 'side', 'featurettes', ""'m"", 'Cordelia', 'Demons', ""'m"", 'Angel', 'are', 'full', 'interesting', 'trivia', 'lengthy', ""'Introducing"", 'Angel', 'where', 'concepts', 'show', 'character', 'are', 'discussed', 'detail.Season', '1', 'great', 'introduction', 'big', 'bad', 'world', 'LA', 'Angel', 'place', 'Whilst', 'subsequent', 'series', 'delve', 'character', 'development', 'improve', 'story', 'arching', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Angel - Season One

Although it is a darker show, and a little less humorous, it has its funny moments at times.  Incidentally, when both shows were on Tuesdays, usually a dark Buffy would be followed by a lighter Angel & vice versa.The theme of the show is growth and redemption, as can be seen from all of the main characters.  The spoiled Queen Cordelia becomes a mature, caring woman.  Alcoholic Doyle (Angel's seer) has unexpected depths and rises to the occasion in magnificent style.  Wesley, the foppish Watcher from S-3 of Buffy, also matures into a real fighter.  And of course Angel tries to find his redemption.  I do admit to having issues with some of Angel's actions, but they are mostly in season 2.Wolfram & Hart, the law firm from Hell (perhaps literally) becomes Angel's nemesis and provides a showcase for four outstanding actors--Sam Anderson (boss Holland Manners), Thomas Burr (Lee Mercer, who comes to a shocking end), the very beautiful Stephanie Romanov (the coldly evil Lilah Morgan), and gorgeous future superstar Christian Kane (brilliant, conflicted Lindsey McDonald, whose performances in Five by Five, Blind Date, and To Shanshu in L.A. are nothing short of amazing).  Elisabeth Rohm (Detective Kate Lockley), who is now starring on Law & Order, provides some solid work in a number of episodes, particularly Lonely Heart, Sense & Sensitivity, & The Prodigal.Many characters from Buffy make appearances including Buffy herself (Sarah Michelle Gellar) in the fan favorite I Will Remember You and in Sanctuary. Spike (James Marsters) appears, as does Faith (Eliza Dushku), so memorable in Five by Five and Sanctuary.  Darla (Julie Benz) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau)appear in an amazing episode called The Prodigal but will play bigger roles in Season 2.Outstanding episodes include City Of, I Will Remember You, Hero, The Prodigal, Five by Five, Sanctuary, Blind Date (my favorite, as a confirmed Lindsey lover!), and To Shanshu.

598833,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005JLEW,D. Mok,"[3, 3]","Originally I had not been enthusiastic about the prospect of Angel, the moody vampire of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in his own show.  In the third season of Buffy Angel had turned somewhat too serious for his own good, and I had not expected much of this series.  I was delightfully surprised, for show creators Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt (one of the finest writers and directors in the Buffy stable) made a very smart choice by giving Angel some terrific comedic moments that help diversify the character.  Though Angel still sulks quite a bit, he is also given some extremely goofy moments (which would never have appeared in Buffy) to help lighten up the tone a bit.  Humour had always been Buffy's secret weapon towards achieving character sympathy, and the one inexhaustible source of mirth in Angel is when the serious, troubled vampire knight finds himself entirely out of his element.David Boreanaz shows us why they'd given him his own show:  Freed of the heavy romance of latter-day Buffy, Boreanaz proves to be just as formidable a comic actor as Alyson Hannigan and Sarah Michelle Gellar, showing a devilishness which had made Angel's character compelling in the first place.  And kudos to him for not being afraid to look silly for the wackier moments of the show.  The supporting cast is not as strong as in Buffy -- Charisma Carpenter's Cordelia, while well acted, is somehow not asinteresting when stripped of the contrasting temperaments of Willow, Xander and Giles, while Glenn Quinn, while charming as Irish visionary Doyle, seems to lack for spark.  Perhaps the problem is that this show has fewer supporting characters, period, and there isn't as much differentiation among them as I'd like.  The redeeming factor:  This first season's most important secondary character is really Detective Kate Lockley, Angel's sometime fighting partner and potential romantic interest.  Elisabeth Rohm is simply impeccable as Kate, never lapsing into overt femininity or combat-booted heroine.  Equally adept at comedy and drama, she is a wonderful  sparring partner for Boreanaz and brings out more mature facets in him that had not been explored in the Buffy series.Without the ongoing plot developments of Buffy, Angel is bound to be less engaging overall, and the rewatch value of this DVD set is far less than that of Buffy.  However, it's still highly entertaining.  I'm not sure how I'll react Season 2 since show after show of episodic demon fighting seems already a bit thin even after this first season, but for the time being, I'm having fun watching this DVD set.",4,"Enjoyable, if a little repetitive.",1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,2586,"['Originally', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'enthusiastic', 'prospect', 'Angel', 'moody', 'vampire', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'own', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'had', 'turned', 'somewhat', 'too', 'serious', 'own', 'good', 'had', 'not', 'expected', 'much', 'series', 'was', 'delightfully', 'surprised', 'show', 'creators', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'David', 'Greenwalt', 'one', 'finest', 'writers', 'directors', 'Buffy', 'stable', 'made', 'very', 'smart', 'choice', 'giving', 'Angel', 'terrific', 'comedic', 'moments', 'help', 'diversify', 'character', 'Angel', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'also', 'given', 'extremely', 'goofy', 'moments', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'appeared', 'Buffy', 'help', 'lighten', 'up', 'tone', 'bit', 'Humour', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'Buffy', 'secret', 'weapon', 'towards', 'achieving', 'character', 'sympathy', 'one', 'inexhaustible', 'source', 'mirth', 'Angel', 'when', 'serious', 'troubled', 'vampire', 'knight', 'entirely', 'element.David', 'Boreanaz', 'why', ""'d"", 'given', 'own', 'show', 'Freed', 'heavy', 'romance', 'latter-day', 'Buffy', 'Boreanaz', 'be', 'just', 'formidable', 'comic', 'actor', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'showing', 'devilishness', 'had', 'made', 'Angel', 'character', 'compelling', 'first', 'place', 'kudos', 'not', 'being', 'afraid', 'look', 'silly', 'wackier', 'moments', 'show', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'Buffy', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'Cordelia', 'well', 'acted', 'somehow', 'not', 'asinteresting', 'when', 'stripped', 'contrasting', 'temperaments', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'Giles', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'charming', 'Irish', 'visionary', 'Doyle', 'lack', 'spark', 'Perhaps', 'problem', 'show', 'fewer', 'supporting', 'characters', 'period', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'differentiation', ""'d"", 'like', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'important', 'secondary', 'character', 'really', 'Detective', 'Kate', 'Lockley', 'Angel', 'sometime', 'fighting', 'partner', 'potential', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Elisabeth', 'Rohm', 'simply', 'impeccable', 'Kate', 'never', 'lapsing', 'overt', 'femininity', 'combat-booted', 'heroine', 'Equally', 'adept', 'comedy', 'drama', 'wonderful', 'sparring', 'partner', 'Boreanaz', 'out', 'more', 'mature', 'facets', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'explored', 'Buffy', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'developments', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'bound', 'be', 'less', 'engaging', 'overall', 'rewatch', 'value', 'DVD', 'set', 'far', 'less', 'Buffy', 'However', 'still', 'highly', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', ""'ll"", 'react', 'Season', '2', 'show', 'show', 'episodic', 'demon', 'fighting', 'already', 'bit', 'thin', 'even', 'first', 'season', 'time', 'being', ""'m"", 'having', 'fun', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set']",Angel - Season One
598834,A3BXK3HE0XUG7,B00005JLEW,Douglas Hahner,"[20, 23]","Yes! While this first season the show was trying to establish itself apart from Buffy, it is still an excellent show. While there were some clunky episodes (She and The Ring to name two), all of the episodes have at least one moment that is great. Be it a joke (Angle and Wesley dancing in She), or incredible make-up (the frog type guy in The Ring) that make all of the episodes worth watching.This is a much darker show than Buffy, and I think it is better for it. The characters are older, and their problems a more adult. A great example is Cordelia... On this show her parents are in jail, and she is out on her own trying to find a job and a place to live.  Also in the commentary on the first episode Joss and David mention how they wanted Angel's problems to parallel those of a recovering alcoholic...My one complaint with this show is that there were a few too many crossovers with Buffy. Some were great (the Spike and Oz episode is probably my favorite episode of the 1st season), but I felt that this show should have tried to make it on its own instead of relying too heavily on Buffy.  When season 3 came and the WB wouldn't let Whedon do any more crossovers with Buffy (who moved to UPN) I felt the show really came into it's own and was the best it has ever been.",5,Better than Buffy?,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,1280,"['Yes', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'trying', 'establish', 'apart', 'Buffy', 'still', 'excellent', 'show', 'were', 'clunky', 'episodes', 'Ring', 'name', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'moment', 'great', 'Be', 'joke', 'Angle', 'Wesley', 'dancing', 'incredible', 'make-up', 'frog', 'type', 'guy', 'Ring', 'make', 'episodes', 'watching.This', 'much', 'darker', 'show', 'Buffy', 'think', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'older', 'problems', 'more', 'adult', 'great', 'example', 'Cordelia', 'show', 'parents', 'are', 'jail', 'out', 'own', 'trying', 'find', 'job', 'place', 'live', 'Also', 'commentary', 'first', 'episode', 'Joss', 'David', 'mention', 'how', 'wanted', 'Angel', 'problems', 'parallel', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'one', 'complaint', 'show', 'were', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'crossovers', 'Buffy', 'were', 'great', 'Spike', 'Oz', 'episode', 'probably', 'favorite', 'episode', '1st', 'season', 'felt', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'make', 'own', 'instead', 'relying', 'too', 'heavily', 'Buffy', 'When', 'season', '3', 'came', 'WB', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'Whedon', 'do', 'more', 'crossovers', 'Buffy', 'who', 'moved', 'UPN', 'felt', 'show', 'really', 'came', 'own', 'was', 'best', 'ever', 'been']",Angel - Season One

598836,A13BP4NJEBZGEY,B00005JLEW,"Drew Macevenwick ""sanmarnan""","[4, 4]","When Angel was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I tended to share Xander's feelings about him. Frankly, he just didn't seem that interesting when he wasn't evil, and surely he wouldn't be evil most of the time on his own series. But I wanted to see the series Angel anyway, mostly because Charisma Carpenter (who was always hilariously evil on Buffy) was also going to be on it. I was not disapointed. I like Angel (the character) much better now that he isn't simply used to whine about how he can't be with Buffy (though there is still some of that this season). This series begins with Angel relocating to LA and meeting up with Cordy (who aspires to be an actress) and Doyle, a demon who gets visions of people in need of help. Immediately, I liked him. Who wouldn't like an Irish demon? Anyway, this series begins with mostly standalone episodes, and some people argue that the show was still trying to find it's path and that these standalone episodes are of poor quality. I tend to disagree. While the season long story arcs are good too, there was nothing wrong with these standalone shows. All of them (with the exception of &quot;She&quot; which is notable for one scene involving Angel dancing, but otherwise is among the worst I've seen on either Buffy or Angel) are of high quality. Not quite midway through the season, Glenn Quinn (Doyle) gets written out and replaced by Wesley Wyndem-Pryce. At this point, all three of the regulars are characters from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. While they are all good characters, it now seemed Angel didn't have a true identity of it's own. Indeed, I would say that's the one problem with this season. For one thing, it's best viewed with Buffy Season 4 (there are several crossover episodes) and some of the action may be confusing to those who haven't seen Buffy before (since all of the main characters came from Buffy and had backstory established there). Still, the series would eventually come to stand on it's own, and even if it doesn't here, that won't stop you from enjoying Season One. In fact, if you're already a fan of Buffy, it may enhance your enjoyment. You'll get guest appearences from Faith, Spike, Oz, and the Slayer herself.

598837,AE3UVCX1AI3DS,B00005JLEW,"""eghan6""","[0, 0]","The first season of Angel is often dismissed as its weakest. I feel that it is one of the strongest because it sticks to the mission statement of the first episode. At the conclusion of the third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Buffy and Angel had broken up and by the beginning of the next season, Angel had found himself in Los Angeles in a quest for anonimoty and vigilantism. In ""City of..."" we meet Doyle and are re-introduced to Cordelia who will form the demon fighting team of the the first 9 episodes.The episodes of the first season were largely stand-alone (did not require reviewing previous episodes to get caught up on expansive backstory) and involved Angel and his team solving the problems of individual people or groups from episode to episode. These episodes are emblematic of how Angel is a hero of Los Angeles that helps everyone.  It mattered that Angel moved to Los Angeles, because, Los Angeles worked as a place where Angel could be faceless in a town where so many people wanted their faces to be famous. All the victims in the first season had a face and highly defined personalities and their problems would correlate to a character development among the cast. The characters would see a reflection of themselves in their clients (for novices, the characters form a detective agency that would work case by case for a fee to help people).Though one would be hard-pressed to find me deriding Angel at all (it is an awesome show), the recent trend has established a story-arc mode where a chain of events throughout the season guides the storyline from episode to episode where the significance of these events pertains specifically to the main characters. In effect, the characters become isolated from the rest of L.A. This works on Buffy since Sunnydale is recognized as a small town and the stories therein should hit close to home for the characters, but since the venue for Angel is so vast the characters become fish-bowled with their isolating stories.The first season is also significant because it establishes the ironic theme of Angel in the City of Angels where no one, not even Angel himself is free of guilt. As Doyle posits in ""City of..."", ""...it's not just saving lives, its saving souls. Possibly your own."" and ""...there's a lot people in this city that need saving...you game?""Some of the exemplary episodes of season one are ""City of..."", ""I Will Remember You"", ""Hero"", ""Expecting"", ""Five by Five"", ""Sanctuary"", ""The Prodigal"", ""Somnambulist"", and ""To Shanshu in L.A."".",4,Underrated,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2520,"['first', 'season', 'Angel', 'often', 'dismissed', 'weakest', 'feel', 'one', 'strongest', 'mission', 'statement', 'first', 'episode', 'conclusion', 'third', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'had', 'broken', 'up', 'beginning', 'next', 'season', 'Angel', 'had', 'found', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'quest', 'anonimoty', 'vigilantism', 'City', 'meet', 'Doyle', 'are', 're-introduced', 'Cordelia', 'who', 'will', 'form', 'demon', 'fighting', 'team', 'first', '9', 'episodes.The', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'largely', 'stand-alone', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'reviewing', 'previous', 'episodes', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'expansive', 'backstory', 'involved', 'Angel', 'team', 'solving', 'problems', 'individual', 'people', 'groups', 'episode', 'episode', 'episodes', 'are', 'emblematic', 'how', 'Angel', 'hero', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'everyone', 'mattered', 'Angel', 'moved', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'worked', 'place', 'where', 'Angel', 'could', 'be', 'faceless', 'town', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'wanted', 'be', 'famous', 'victims', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'face', 'highly', 'defined', 'personalities', 'problems', 'would', 'correlate', 'character', 'development', 'cast', 'characters', 'would', 'see', 'reflection', 'clients', 'novices', 'characters', 'form', 'detective', 'agency', 'would', 'work', 'case', 'case', 'fee', 'help', 'people', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'deriding', 'Angel', 'awesome', 'show', 'recent', 'trend', 'established', 'story-arc', 'mode', 'where', 'chain', 'events', 'season', 'storyline', 'episode', 'episode', 'where', 'significance', 'events', 'specifically', 'main', 'characters', 'effect', 'characters', 'become', 'isolated', 'rest', 'L.A', 'Buffy', 'Sunnydale', 'recognized', 'small', 'town', 'stories', 'should', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'characters', 'venue', 'Angel', 'so', 'vast', 'characters', 'become', 'fish-bowled', 'isolating', 'stories.The', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'significant', 'ironic', 'theme', 'Angel', 'City', 'Angels', 'where', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'Angel', 'free', 'guilt', 'Doyle', 'posits', 'City', 'not', 'just', 'saving', 'lives', 'saving', 'souls', 'Possibly', 'own', 'lot', 'people', 'city', 'need', 'saving', 'game', 'exemplary', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'City', 'Will', 'Remember', 'Hero', 'Expecting', 'Five', 'Five', 'Sanctuary', 'Prodigal', 'Somnambulist', 'Shanshu', 'L.A.']",Angel - Season One
598838,A1WWNCPWNQTGYP,B00005JLEW,Empyreal,"[2, 2]","I started watching Angel last year (3rd season of the show) along with Buffy. wanting to get caught up on both shows, I watched the first three seasons of Buffy. I soon stopped watching the 6th season of Buffy and stuck with just those first three since they were, in my opinion, the best. SO I got caught up on who Angel was and whatnot, but I was still in the dark as to how Angel had evolved to season 3. So, I was ecstatic when I found out season 1 was released on DVD.The first season of Angel is absolutely excellent. It started off on shaky steps, almost as thought it wasn't sure whether it could survive without Buffy. Fortunately, it blew away all expectations and has done exceptionally well. Even if you have never seen Buffy, Angel will stand alone. It has everything: humor, great plots, great characters. It doesn't have a big story arc, though, which I attribute to Joss et al being unsure whether it was going to be able to stand on its own. So, each episode is pretty much its own little story. You have some of the more classic episodes in season 1 as well, such as I Will Remember You. Plus, you get that hilarious dance scene of Angel in the episode She.One interesting aspect of Angel that I believe many shows lack is the realistic growth of the characters. A theme of the show for this season is finding where you belong and what your purpose in life is. At the beginning of Season 1, everything is weird.. Angel's in a new weird place and doesnt know how to go about achieving redemption, dealing with his new friend, or what the heck to do with Cordelia who is also trying ot find her place in the City of Angels. The show grows, as do the characters. Cordelia's wit is ever-present, Wesley finally starts to step out of his father's shadow, and Angel grows in what redemption means. Plus, you get really nice inspirational speeches on Angel's part, who knows what it's like to suffer and cause pain and try to overcome it all anyway. Angel continues to make these inspirational speeches all throughout the seasons, so you can look forward to them!The quality of the DVDs is excellent, but it is unfortunate that they didn't put any memorial to the actor that played Doyle.",5,Excellent,1046390400,"02 28, 2003",2003,2199,"['started', 'watching', 'Angel', 'last', 'year', '3rd', 'season', 'show', 'Buffy', 'wanting', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'shows', 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'soon', 'stopped', 'watching', '6th', 'season', 'Buffy', 'stuck', 'just', 'first', 'three', 'were', 'opinion', 'best', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'who', 'Angel', 'was', 'whatnot', 'was', 'still', 'dark', 'how', 'Angel', 'had', 'evolved', 'season', '3', 'So', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'found', 'season', '1', 'was', 'released', 'DVD.The', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'started', 'off', 'shaky', 'steps', 'almost', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', 'survive', 'Buffy', 'Fortunately', 'blew', 'away', 'expectations', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Even', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'will', 'stand', 'alone', 'everything', 'humor', 'great', 'plots', 'great', 'characters', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'story', 'arc', 'attribute', 'Joss', 'et', 'al', 'being', 'unsure', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'So', 'episode', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'little', 'story', 'have', 'more', 'classic', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'Will', 'Remember', 'get', 'hilarious', 'dance', 'scene', 'Angel', 'episode', 'She.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'Angel', 'believe', 'many', 'shows', 'lack', 'realistic', 'growth', 'characters', 'theme', 'show', 'season', 'finding', 'where', 'belong', 'what', 'purpose', 'life', 'beginning', 'Season', '1', 'everything', 'weird..', 'Angel', 'new', 'weird', 'place', 'doesnt', 'know', 'how', 'go', 'achieving', 'redemption', 'dealing', 'new', 'friend', 'what', 'heck', 'do', 'Cordelia', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'ot', 'find', 'place', 'City', 'Angels', 'show', 'do', 'characters', 'Cordelia', 'wit', 'ever-present', 'Wesley', 'finally', 'step', 'out', 'father', 'shadow', 'Angel', 'what', 'redemption', 'get', 'really', 'nice', 'inspirational', 'speeches', 'Angel', 'part', 'who', 'what', 'suffer', 'cause', 'pain', 'try', 'overcome', 'anyway', 'Angel', 'make', 'inspirational', 'speeches', 'seasons', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'excellent', 'unfortunate', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'memorial', 'actor', 'played', 'Doyle']",Angel - Season One

This is what I am basing my rating on:- City Of... - This picks up where Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Season Three leaves off with Angel coming to L.A. and meeting up with a half-human/half demon named Doyle and a familiar face in Cordellia Chase from BTVS.- In the Dark - Excellent episode which continues the feud between Angel and former ally Spike! This also shows Angel out during the daytime for first time that I can recall!- The Bachelor Party - This sees Doyle nearly get killed at the hands of his ex-wife's fiance!- I Will Remember You (Guest Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar) - The most heartbreaking episode on either BTVS or Angel and a bittersweet chapter in the Buffy/Angel romance.- Hero - The final appearance of Doyle. Ironically and tragically, the actor that played him died two years later from a drug overdose. RIP.- Parting Gifts - Cordellia gets a new power while Wesley Wyndham-Price from BTVS shows up and joins the team after a brief encounter with Angel.- Expecting - Cordy suddenly gets pregnant!- The Prodigal - An old protege from the past returns to kill Angel.- The Ring - Angel goes undercover into an illegal fight ring.- Eternity - A struggling former child actor tries to seduce Angel into making her a vampire but instead unleashes Angelous!- Five by Five - Rogue Slayer Faith is hired by Wolfrham &amp; Hart to eliminate Angel.- Sanctuary (Guest Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar) - Buffy hunts Faith to settle a score (see Buffy The Vampire Slayer season 4 for the reason)These are the episodes that I have seen. But, I did enjoy them so I am certain that the others are of good quality as well. On a personal note, I will probably purchase this item soon myself just for &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; alone!

598850,A1H8JUI9GNQKNR,B00005JLEW,Harold Harefoot,"[3, 5]","Of the literally thousands of tv shows that have aired over the last fifty years, there are maybe a dozen that I would describe as ""great"" and Angel is one of them.  As with it's progenitor, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the characters of Angel are written (and acted) to be such complete and complex personalities that you end up caring for them as if they were close friends.  In fact, Wesley and Fred from Angel ended up being my favorite male and female characters from the entire ""Buffyverse"" (Fred is a woman, in case you're completely unfamiliar with the show - and she doesn't actually appear in the show until season two).  The first season is similar to the first season of Buffy in that it consists mainly of stand-alone episodes without an overall story arc.  This was actually a very sharp way of introducing the world of Angel to the audience because it is a show that is very different from Buffy - darker and more adult.  Having the arc-heavy seasons start with season two gave the producers all of season one to establish the new setting for Angel, with all of its details and complexities, without having to concentrate overly much on each individual character's storylines (which were still there, but not emphasized as much until season two).  So even though there's no ongoing arc established in season one, you still need to watch it in order to understand the characters and the setting.  The individual episodes are generally very good to excellent on their own.  There are one or two episodes that aren't up to par for this show, but they are still better than 95% of anything else that's ever appeared on television.  Overall, great tv with mostly stand-alone episodes, but a must buy before getting to season two.  The big surprise that begins the three-season arc (seasons two thru four) happens in the last few seconds of the season finale - so you definitely don't want to miss that.  One other note:  There is a great deal of interplay between this season of Angel and season four of Buffy.  If you really want to get the full viewing experience as it originally happened on tv, you need to alternate episodes between the two shows (meaning watch ep. 1 of Buffy, then ep. 1 of Angel, then both episode 2's in the same order, etc.).  There are scenes where, for instance, Angel makes a phone call on his show and Buffy receives the call on her show.  If you watch them out of order, you miss the details and the significance of the character's actions and reactions.

598851,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B00005JLEW,Hazen B Markoe,"[19, 20]","During BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER's 3rd season, it was decided to spin-off the character of her brooding vampire boyfriend, Angel, into his own series. This was a definite risk as the Buffy/Angel romance was a big part in the show's initial success.  They also changed the lead character's locale from the fictional California suburb, Sunnydale, to the gritty city of Los Angeles.  What emerged was a somewhat darker, and edgier show that still maintained the wit and twists of its parent.For folks not familiar with the character, Angel (David Boreanez) was formerly a nasty vampire known as ""Angelus.""  However, after being cursed with a soul by gypsies, our hero now seeks to atone for his past misdeeds by ""helping the helpless.""  In order to do so, he forms a private detective agency with the help of the self-important Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter, whose role also was a major supporting character on BUFFY).  Both Boreanez and Carpenter have a solid handle on their roles while relishing the opportunity to display areas they had little chance to roam in.  For example, Boreanez gets to show more of a comedic side in scenes where he goes undercover (as a tourist in a VERY loud shirt) and when he imagines himself on the dance floor of a party.  The scenes of his ""spazz dance"" are gut-bustingly funny.  In contrast, Cordelia's character grows less selfish as the season goes on.  The rest of the supporting cast is also quite solid.  Glenn Quinn (who died tragically of a drug overdose in December, 2002) brings a light hearted touch to his Irish half-demon character, while Alexis Denisof grabs our attention as Wesley, the former Watcher who changes from buffoon to one of the most interesting characters on TV today.Like the Buffy DVDs, this ANGEL set is somewhat thin when it comes to special features.  Just selected episode commentaries, promotional featurettes and some picture galleries. Still,  ANGEL expands on the world of Buffy and provides its own unique spin.  A solid start for the series and a set that I definitely recommend, especially for fans of BUFFY.",4,David Boreanez flys solo in ANGEL -Season 1,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,2080,"['BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'decided', 'spin-off', 'character', 'brooding', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', 'Angel', 'own', 'series', 'was', 'definite', 'risk', 'Buffy/Angel', 'romance', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'show', 'initial', 'success', 'also', 'changed', 'lead', 'character', 'locale', 'fictional', 'California', 'suburb', 'Sunnydale', 'gritty', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'What', 'emerged', 'was', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'edgier', 'show', 'still', 'maintained', 'wit', 'twists', 'parent.For', 'folks', 'not', 'familiar', 'character', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanez', 'was', 'formerly', 'nasty', 'vampire', 'known', 'Angelus', 'However', 'being', 'cursed', 'soul', 'gypsies', 'hero', 'now', 'atone', 'past', 'misdeeds', 'helping', 'helpless', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'private', 'detective', 'agency', 'help', 'self-important', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'role', 'also', 'was', 'major', 'supporting', 'character', 'BUFFY', 'Boreanez', 'Carpenter', 'have', 'solid', 'handle', 'roles', 'relishing', 'opportunity', 'display', 'areas', 'had', 'little', 'chance', 'roam', 'example', 'Boreanez', 'show', 'more', 'comedic', 'side', 'scenes', 'where', 'undercover', 'tourist', 'VERY', 'loud', 'shirt', 'when', 'dance', 'floor', 'party', 'scenes', 'spazz', 'dance', 'are', 'gut-bustingly', 'funny', 'contrast', 'Cordelia', 'character', 'less', 'selfish', 'season', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'quite', 'solid', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'who', 'died', 'tragically', 'drug', 'overdose', 'December', '2002', 'light', 'hearted', 'touch', 'Irish', 'half-demon', 'character', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'grabs', 'attention', 'Wesley', 'former', 'Watcher', 'who', 'buffoon', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'TV', 'Buffy', 'DVDs', 'ANGEL', 'set', 'somewhat', 'thin', 'when', 'special', 'features', 'Just', 'selected', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'promotional', 'featurettes', 'picture', 'galleries', 'Still', 'ANGEL', 'world', 'Buffy', 'own', 'unique', 'spin', 'solid', 'start', 'series', 'set', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'especially', 'fans', 'BUFFY']",Angel - Season One

Dumdei,"[1, 2]","I was not the biggest fan of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Angel when he was on Buffy, and I will admit that the only reason I originally watched Angel, the spin-off series, was because it came on right after BtVS. The show's dependence upon its parent series definitely shows in the first season. It took Joss & Co. some time to develop its tone and characters, but the first season does have some great work. David Boreanaz finally breaks free of the flatter, supporting part on BtVS and gets to explore a few more of his acting abilities, including his little seen comedic talents. (There's a fantasy sequence of Angel dancing in ""She"" that cracks me up EVERY time.)  Season 1 also features the late Glenn Quinn, who shines brightly, albeit briefly, as Francis Allen Doyle, the man who gives Angel access to ""the good fight"". Most of all, the first season is worth checking out because, without it, you'll never understand what's going on later, and later is DEFINITELY worth checking out.As for the DVDs, they are not feature-tastic, but they don't exactly ...There could be more commentaries for my personal taste, but the commentary by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt on the first episode, ""City Of"", is fricking hilarious and SO great to hear.

598856,A3SGRYIICHGMX,B00005JLEW,Jack Turner,"[2, 3]","WOW!  I though Buffy the Vampire Slayer's first three seasons were great, but Angel is even better.  Angel is dark, brooding, and he kicks more butt than Buffy ever could.  Angel has moved to LA where he spends his nights slaying vampires by one and twos until he meets a mysterious stranger named Doyle, who convinces him that not only is he losing touch with the people he rescues, but also that he will ultimately slip into the madness he was in before meeting Buffy.  The rest of the season is action packed and filled with dark drama.  Buffy and Faith do show up a couple of times to tie what's going on in Angel to what's going on in Buffy, though I suspect this was done at the time to generate buzz among Buffy fans rather than to help any specific story along.  It is advisable to watch Buffy Season 4 concurrently with Angel because if you have not seen one or the other, there will be gaps that you'd want to cover.The DVD itself is great.  Finally, we have cast interviews!  Unfortunately, they don't talk to David Boreanez that much, nor to Alexis Dennisdof.  Frankly, I'd much rather listen to what they have to say than to Joss Whedon.  The episode commentaries are interesting enough, fun to listen to, and do help you get a better sense of the show as it was conceived (particularly the commentary on the first episode).  Really, this is a great program.  Angel turned out to be a much better show than Buffy did towards the end.  Still, even for such a great show, it's a shame that they had to take Angel out of Buffy because really the to characters belong in the same show.

While  mostly uneven, it still contains its share of exciting hours and is an important prelude to the highly-acclaimed Seasons 2 and 3.The basic premise is that Angel, the Gypsy-cursed vampire with a soul, relocates to Los Angeles to escape the memory of ex-girlfriend Buffy, and to ""fight the good fight"" against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness.  He's aided by ""Buffy"" alum Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia (as his ditzy aide), and Doyle, the half-demon (on his mother's side) guide to ""the powers that be"".The first several episodes explore the notion that L.A. is a big, bad, unforgiving city, similar to the way that ""Buffy""'s Sunnydale High always reflected its characters' private angst.  ""Angel"" was less suited to the ironic beast-of-the-week format, and quickly dropped it.  In ""City of..."", Joss Whedon's sharply-written pilot, Angel assembles his private-eye crew, but fails to save the girl, and makes mortal enemies out of demonic law firm Wolfram & Hart.  ""Lonely Heart"" similarly takes place in nothing but bars and nightclubs, and is most memorable for the introduction of Detective Kate Lockley.""Angel"" benefitted early on from two crossovers with ""Buffy"".  ""Into The Dark"" concludes a BtVS story with ""Buffy"" regulars Spike and Oz visiting L.A.  ""I Will Remember You"" features Sarah Michelle Gellar's first visit to Angel since their breakup.  In both episodes Angel refuses an escape from his vampire lifestyle -- even though that means terminating his newfound romance.  Both episodes stand out among the season's best, with Spike's merciless taunting of Angel (""I'm just a big fluffy puppy with bad teeth"") the higlight of the season.Other early episodes are not quite as memorable.  ""I Fall To Pieces"", ""Room W/A Vu"", and ""Sense and Sensitivity"" all play on the theme of L.A. as a devourer of lost souls.  The first of these is the weakest of the season, although the last has an amusing cameo by Steve Schirripa, later of ""The Sopranos"".  Also introduced is Cordy's amusing invisible-ghost roommate, Dennis, surely the hardest-working character on the show.  ""Bachelor Party"" introduces Doyle's family and features the welcome return of Carlos Jacott, who played another demon on the previous season of ""Buffy"".In ""Hero"", Doyle is abruptly killed off, to be replaced in the next episode, ""Parting Gifts"", by Wesley Wyndham-Price (Alexis Denisof), making the three regulars a matched set of sidelined ""Buffy"" characters.Meanwhile, although the season still doesn't have a unified arc, the various hints that pop up in ""Somnambulist"" turn Detective Lockley, suddenly, into Angel's enemy.  A powerful female demon in ""She"" is supposed to rival Angel -- and provide a possible love interest -- but is never heard from again.  ""Expecting"" features the show's first sex scene, and, as on ""Buffy"", there are sardonic consequences for all.""Angel""'s first year slowly revs into gear with episode 14, ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", a sharp riff on ""The Exorcist"" which helps bridge the gap between Wesley the craven coward, and the more driven team-leader he'll become.  Where ""The Prodigal"" limps along, introducing an evil protege of Angel's (never to appear again), ""The Ring"" is another fantastic hour that brings the Wolfram & Hart storyline back into focus.  ""Eternity"", the next episode, is a not-so-welcome detour, the season's lone excuse to bring back Angel's evil alter ago, Angelus, for a very over-the-top ten minutes.""Five By Five"" and ""Sanctuary"", an intense two-parter, brings Faith over from the ""Buffy"" universe.  Angel does something Buffy couldn't do -- resolve Faith's story act -- even though that means a very angry Buffy squares off again with Angel in the concluding episode.In ""War Zone"", we're introduced to budding series regular Gunn, a street kid fighting his own street war against vampires.  ""Blind Date"" finally returns Wolfram & Hart to the fore, as the three previously-seen evil lawyers (all of whose surnames mysteriously begin with the letter ""M"") embark on a scheme to interfere with Angel's destiny.The season wraps up with the satisfying ""To Shanshu In L.A."".  Each of the four regulars is given something to do, and the episode ends with a reaffirmation of Angel's ultimate goal -- to shed his vampire nature and become human at long last.  Which is only weakenedly slightly by the fact that Angel refused the gift of humanity on each of the first two discs in this set.Overall, you won't find Angel: Season One to be nearly as satisfying as what's to come, but it's a good introduction to the show and makes a fine bookend for the three seasons of ""Buffy"" overflowing your DVD shelf.",3,A Taste of Things To Come,1038182400,"11 25,

598861,A2GJQ1MLNP3B23,B00005JLEW,Jeffrey Matthew Cohen,"[1, 1]","Angel is a great show. And though last season (S3) was weak at times, it still makes most of what's on TV bow down in comparison. Season 1 is Angel's greatest achievement. It is the season that was, aside from the trials and tribulations of the supernatural, about living the the big, empty, lonely city, and trying to make a name for yourself in it. Season 1 is when ""Angel"" was still about LA, and not Pylea, or any other alternative dimension.In this season (aside from the regulars), we, for the first time, meet Lilah, Lindsey, Gunn, and Kate (who I happen to love, and wish was still on the show.) The regular cast was small and precise, and the recurring characters were interesting and purposeful. Nowadays, there are so many characters on Angel that the intamacy is gone, and everyone has to jockey for lines and screen-time, that some characters are hardly seen at all. Also, after I re-watched this season on DVD, I saw how much I missed the ""old"" Cordelia...her lines and delivery were perfect. In this season, we also get a lot more background on Angel's ""becoming"" from a human to a vampire, which sets up the season finale fantastically! So buy Angel 1 on DVD!

Angel, the vampire with a soul, arrives in LA after leaving Buffy in Sunnydale at the end of season three.  Soon upon his arrival, he is greeted by Doyle, a half-demon/half-human individual who has the power of seeing from the PTB (Powers That Be).  Cordelia shows up, attempting to become an actress, but she knows that Angel really needs her help with his business.While the series gets started slowly, the arrival of Spike and Oz in the third episode is an EXCELLENT one.  Spike's diagloue to Angel's conversation with a client is hilarious.  The next great episode is the one with Buffy herself, &quot;I Will Remember You.&quot;  This episode is both wonderful and sad.  After the loss of Doyle (he passes his gift onto Cordelia), Wesley, the watcher, arrives.  It is after this, as many have mentioned, that the show began to gel.  Probably because the three main actors had worked together on Buffy.  The arrival of Faith in LA also lends to two very good episodes.Whether you are a fan of Buffy or not, Angel stands on its own as a show worth watching.

Watching the first 9 episodes before his charcater was killed off, I found them a lot of fun. After Doyle died I think the show lost a big part of it's  soul, don't get me wrong the show is still good but...not as good. Doyle was one entertaining character and Glenn Quinn played him great and replacing him with Wesley didn't do much for me. I had to get used that. Wesley grew on me eventually though.  Anyway Angel is a good show, I didn't get into it much when it first started but now that I own this season I realize that I actually like it more than Buffy. Watching the 4th season now I realize that it has a lot more steam left in it than Buffy does too. I wouldn't mind seeing Angel on for a few more seasons if the WB doesn't drop it after the 4th. It's a fun show, it isn't full of too much mushy drama like Buffy has been like for the last 2 1/2 seasons. It's actually full of tons of action and cool bad guys, the first season was especially. It's a shame that the WB throws around it's time slot because it's a very good show, the best they have on next to Smallville. They give their Dawson Creek type shows way too much attention when it's Buffy that gave the WB life in the first place. Anyway Angel season one is a solid first season. It has strong guest appearences by Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy), James Marsters (Spike), Seth Green (Oz) and the sexy Eliza Dusku as Faith.

598870,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLEW,Joe Sherry,"[9, 10]","At the end of the third season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" the character Angel (David Boreanaz) leaves Sunnydale to get away from Buffy.  He winds up in Los Angeles and since he still has a soul, Angel begins helping and protecting people from the vampires and demons who prey on humans.  When I had first heard there was a spin-off series from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and that it was centered on Angel, I wasn't interested.  Throughout the first three seasons of ""Buffy"", I was never a big fan of the character of Angel and did not think much of his chances of actually being the lead for his own series.  I did agree with Angel leaving Sunnydale because I thought that everything that could be done with that character in connection with Buffy had already been done.  Neither Buffy nor Angel could grow as character if they were still together.  After a while (mostly because I was unable to purchase the fifth season of ""Buffy""), I decided to give the first season of ""Angel"" a chance.Season One of ""Angel"" runs concurrently with Season Four of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  This would be Buffy's first year at U.C. Sunnydale, and while the characters of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Willow had gone off to college, Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) also left Sunnydale for L.A., but with the hopes of being a famous actress.  Things do not always happen as people might expect, and Angel and Cordelia meet up and together with a half demon named Doyle (Glenn Quinn) form Angel Investigations, a private investigations firm with the purpose of helping people.Like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", many episodes of ""Angel"" feature a Monster of the Week, but it also builds the relationships between the characters and reveals the nature of L.A. and it is significantly different than that of Sunnydale.  There is no true ""Big Bad"" this season, but Season One reveals that the scope of the evil is much larger than we had come to see in ""Buffy"".  There is a law firm, Wolfram and Hart, which represents the evil elements of society (including demons) in court and has built up a huge power structure.  But, while Wolfram and Hart is a big deal, the true heart of the first season of ""Angel"" is the build up.  We are reintroduced to the fallen Watcher Wesley Wyndam-Price (Alexis Denisof) as he joins Angel Investigations and the most interesting character on the show (besides Cordelia) was a detective with the LAPD, Kake Lockley (Elisabeth Rohm).This is a show that I really did not know what to expect from.  I wasn't excited to watch it, but when I started I was sucked in (no pun intended) from the first episode.  The strength of ""Angel"" comes not from the lead, though David Boreanaz does a good job, but from the supporting characters.  Cordelia, Doyle, and Wesley add so much to the show that without them, I don't think ""Angel"" would work quite so well.  There were also several crossover episodes where Buffy, Oz (Seth Green), Spike (James Marsters) and Faith (Eliza Dushku) make guest appearances.  These guest appearances serve to tie ""Angel"" into the world of ""Buffy"", but it also shows how characters like Wesley and Cordelia have grown beyond who they were in years past.

598874,A13KXWTN0DT878,B00005JLEW,"Josh ""Josh""","[5, 5]","Angel's first season is all about closure from the Buffyverse and setting a totally unique and darker universe. In a smart move, Angel resides in LA after leaving Sunnydale and Buffy behind. In LA, he continues to seek redemption for his past doings. In doing so, he meets up with Doyle, a demon who receives head splitting visions of danger from the Powers that Be, and becomes Angel's aid. Along for the ride is former Sunnydale resident Cordelia Chase who begins the infamous Angel Investigations.Never has there been such entertaining and involving television such as the first season of Angel. Being a spin-off of Buffy, Angel held its own ground in becoming a completely different show. Joss Whedon, David Greenwalt, and the rest of the show's writers developed the new characters and delved into Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley even more. Some of the more stellar episodes from this season are  Will Always Remember You, Heroes, Five by Five, Sanctuary, and the creepy Under Your Skin. Of course, that's based on my opinion for the remaining episodes are all awesome in their own way.David Boreanaz's star quality is lowbrow, and he took this show in his own hands. But not stealing all the screentime for a lot is given to his costars. Charisma Carpenter is wonderful as always, even with her past Cordelia attitude. Charisma showed Cordelia's slow transition to having more heart very well. Her performance in the season one finale was breathtaking. Glenn Quinn's performance made him a loveable fan favorite, and always will be. The return of Alexis Denisof rounding out the main cast for season one was a swell choice. Elisabeth Rohm was a great addition, and J. August Richards as Gunn worked very well. Well enough to make him a regular cast member.The DVD presentation is a swell one. Although the show was shot in the widescreen format, we do get regular full screen. Sound and picture are great, although the picture gets a little grainy sometimes. Nothing to complain about. All of the featurettes are nifty and chock full of interviews from cast & crew. The commentaries range from highly entertaining to subtly interesting, as most do. And the design of the whole set is mood setting. Loved it.Angel's season one set up for the upcoming seasons which become even more darker, sinister, and quirkier.

598877,AIQCCJLXIXFVR,B00005JLEW,just me,"[0, 0]","Usually I've noticed that the girls tend to like Buffy and the guys Angel (because Buffy's more emotional and about feelings and Angel's more shoot first, ask questions later, action, etc.), but I actually like Angel more then the Buffy series. Angel is also a lot darker of a series and more of an ""adult"" type show where as Buffy is more of a high school teen type of show (I'm not knocking Buffy. It's my second favorite series, but I'm just trying to give a good review on the type of audience that'll like the show). If you're watching it for the Buffy/Angel story you'll be disappointed. They play into it in season 1 for a little while and then it's pretty much over and he moves on (though because she's his first love he still loves her, she just takes a back seat and he becomes more focused on his own mission). Angel is really a different show from Buffy completely so a lot of the people that like Buffy might not like Angel and vice versa, but I suggest stopping it at season 3 or 4 (in season 4 they ruin one of the main characters and in season 5 they ruin everyone else's character and basically make the show into a totally different show), but season 1 is slow to start, but good once it starts, season 2 and 3 are AMAZING (the best television show writing I've ever seen), season 4 it like the final book or movie of a saga (where everything comes together), but it's the darkest season of the seasons and a lot of people felt it was drawn out (I personally liked it, but some things I thought were just plain disgusting and they NEVER should have done, but I felt other parts made up for the horrible, disgusting parts) and brought the show to an end, and the 5th season was when they just didn't realize the series show have ended (I mean seriously, don't both. If you don't like season 4's ending season 5 is way worst. It's like the chicken with it's head cut off that keeps going anyway. Season 5 doesn't answer any of the questions Joss leaves in season 7 of Buffy or season 4 of Angel. It's seriously just a waste of time.I know it may seem like the series isn't worth it because they start loosing it towards the end, but trust me seasons 1-3 are AMAZING.

While season one mostly offers episodic adventures it introduces evil term Woldram & Hart, Charles Gunn and Darla's ressurection. It has interesting minor storylines like Detective Kate Lockley and her relationship with Angel and gives us more information about Angel's past which I always find intriguing and also because Darla is such an attractive character. Season offers its peak with Faith's coming to town and, like always, causing chaos. Buffy makes her only appearances here which is a shame cos' it always excites the viewer to see her and about what will happen.

598880,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00005JLEW,kaduzy,"[0, 2]","As a latecomer into Joss Whedon's world, I had a lot to catch up on. If it weren't for the magic of TV on DVD, I never would have found out about this twisted, magical, marvelous universe.If you're like me and you enjoyed ""Buffy"" for its characters, quippy dialogue and mystical cannon of monsters then you'll love Angel for the same reason. But if you're like me in that Buffy sometimes bugged you with an overkill on the quips and an ""underkill"" (so to speak) on the stories, then you'll LOVE Angel. Love, LOVE, *LOVE* it -- like I do.This show is more grown up than Buffy ever was, and with reason. It's made for adults, whereas Buffy was always intended for a more adolescent audience. None of the characters suffer the burden of juggling high school or college with fighting evil, so there's room for a lot more character growth and development a lot earlier on, and this first season packs a solid punch.The first stroke of genius on the part of the series creators was in giving Angel as his prime nemesis the lawfirm of Wolfram & Hart. THIS WAS A FANTASTIC IDEA. Instead of dealing with the ""villain of the month"" style baddies best known from Buffy, we get instead an evil entity that's more like the mythical Hydra -- defeating one of its schemes means that two or three more will pop up in their place. The different lawyers offer villains in varying shades of grey and their knowledge of Angel's destiny offers a tantalizing glimpse into his future battles against this seemingly indefeatable enemy. It's a lot more complicated than staking the Master and then going on summer vacation, folks.Stories are the reason to come and watch, but characters are the reason to stick around. Cordelia, Wesley and Angel all make great strides forward from the people they were in Sunnydale, and by the end of the first season they're almost unrecognizable. And then there's Doyle . . . I almost took a star off because of what happened to Doyle. I simply don't understand WHY it happened. He was such a wonderful character, and I was looking forward to seeing how he grew as the years went by.Bottom line: this is a fantastic show. Don't look to my review to break down every episode for you; there are plenty of websites around that do it better. Just know that if you're a Buffy fan who turned her nose up at Angel as just another money-gubbing spin-off, you're doing yourself a disservice, because this series is gold and it's only gonna get better from here.",5,In A Word: Phenomenal,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2463,"['latecomer', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'world', 'had', 'lot', 'catch', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'magic', 'TV', 'DVD', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'twisted', 'magical', 'marvelous', 'universe.If', ""'re"", 'enjoyed', 'Buffy', 'characters', 'quippy', 'dialogue', 'mystical', 'cannon', 'monsters', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Angel', 'same', 'reason', ""'re"", 'Buffy', 'sometimes', 'bugged', 'overkill', 'quips', 'underkill', 'so', 'speak', 'stories', 'then', ""'ll"", 'LOVE', 'Angel', 'Love', 'LOVE', 'do.This', 'show', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'Buffy', 'ever', 'was', 'reason', 'made', 'adults', 'whereas', 'Buffy', 'was', 'always', 'intended', 'more', 'adolescent', 'audience', 'None', 'characters', 'suffer', 'burden', 'juggling', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'fighting', 'evil', 'room', 'lot', 'more', 'character', 'growth', 'development', 'lot', 'earlier', 'first', 'season', 'solid', 'punch.The', 'first', 'stroke', 'genius', 'part', 'series', 'creators', 'was', 'giving', 'Angel', 'prime', 'nemesis', 'lawfirm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'THIS', 'WAS', 'A', 'FANTASTIC', 'IDEA', 'Instead', 'dealing', 'villain', 'month', 'style', 'baddies', 'best', 'known', 'Buffy', 'get', 'instead', 'evil', 'entity', 'more', 'mythical', 'Hydra', 'defeating', 'one', 'schemes', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'will', 'pop', 'up', 'place', 'different', 'lawyers', 'offer', 'villains', 'varying', 'shades', 'grey', 'knowledge', 'Angel', 'destiny', 'tantalizing', 'glimpse', 'future', 'battles', 'seemingly', 'indefeatable', 'enemy', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'staking', 'Master', 'then', 'going', 'summer', 'vacation', 'folks.Stories', 'are', 'reason', 'come', 'watch', 'characters', 'are', 'reason', 'stick', 'around', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'Angel', 'make', 'great', 'strides', 'forward', 'people', 'were', 'Sunnydale', 'end', 'first', 'season', ""'re"", 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'then', 'Doyle', 'almost', 'took', 'star', 'what', 'happened', 'Doyle', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'WHY', 'happened', 'was', 'such', 'wonderful', 'character', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'grew', 'years', 'went', 'by.Bottom', 'line', 'fantastic', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'review', 'break', 'down', 'episode', 'are', 'plenty', 'websites', 'do', 'better', 'Just', 'know', ""'re"", 'Buffy', 'fan', 'who', 'turned', 'nose', 'up', 'Angel', 'just', 'money-gubbing', 'spin-off', ""'re"", 'doing', 'disservice', 'series', 'gold', 'only', 'gon', 'get', 'better', 'here']",Angel - Season One

Joss Whedon knows what people want, the two basic ingredients in any Show no matter what medium, and they are real characters and good stories. Once you have these two factors you have a hit no matter what genre. If you care about good story telling, fabulous writing and acting as well as a behind the scenes crew that is collectively an incredibly talented bunch, then this is the DVD set for you. The Picture and Sound are theater quality. The closed captioning and Audio come in other languages besides English. It's jam packed with all sorts of extra bonus specials. The Brilliant creators, Joss Whedon, David Greenwalt and other staff members are at their very best, just as they were with their work on Buffy (which is also a must own). I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well. Quite a bit of quality work went into the making of all five seasons. All five are a necessary buy for any Angel fan! It's completely impossible to be anything but extremely pleased with this purchase as well as the rest of the series.David Boreanaz (Angel) and Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) are perfect together. Him as the brooding vampire and her as the bright smiling somewhat shallow, a little spoiled and lost without her lifelong wealth. They come together, even though they are from totally different worlds to create Angel investigations. Glenn Quinn (Doyle) an Irish actor plays a half demon half human with visions from ""The Powers That Be"". These visions are intended to help Angel in his mission of redemption. Glenn adds a certain mystery plus comic relief to his character. While being a help to Angel and trying to find his own redemption, he otherwise spends most of his time drinking scotch and chasing Cordelia. Unfortunately, in Episode 9 entitled ""Hero"" he gets to atone for his past. Doyle knows he will lose his life in completing his task and passes his visions onto Cordelia with a kiss. We end up losing a wonderful actor. He was a great asset to the show. Sadly in real life we lost him as well. With the Doyle gone there was an opportunity to add someone new to the show. Alexis Denisof reprises his role from Buffy as (Wes). He shows up on Angel as a rogue demon hunter after being fired from The Watchers Council. Eventually he joins Angel investigations. Alexis Denisof is one of the most versatile actors I have ever had the pleasure to watch. He has that special ability of being the smooth sophisticate ie: a James Bond type and on a dime he can be the worlds greatest comedic doofs or fools if you prefer. He has an amazing range of abilities as shown throughout the series. He was by far the BEST choice to replace Glenn Quinn. Any show isn't complete without our villains. Christian Kane (Lindsey) and Stephanie Romanov (Lila) both play lawyers for Wolfram and Hart and Angels worst nemesis. Both are consummate actors. My favorite is Lila, a self professed vicious bitch. She is the Queen of the gray areas. Lila adds sex appeal while still being evil. They both are a lot of fun while still being great adversaries for Angel and his crew. Joss Whedon once again comes through with proving to us that ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" wasn't a lucky fluke, but the catalyst to more GREAT television. I not only highly recommend this Season DVD set, but the other four seasons as well. Any true Angel fan must complete or start their set with this one. Purchase this before it gets sold out and you miss your chance to continue your collection. ORDER IMMEDIATELY AND DON'T FORGET TO BUY SEASONS TWO, THREE, FOUR AND FIVE WHILE YOUR AT IT.",5,Joss Whedon ROCKS!

598884,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLEW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[26, 29]","In re-watching Season One of ""Angel"" it is insightful to consider what creators David Greenwalt and Joss Whedon did to make this series a successful spinoff from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"":First, ""Angel"" works in a different genre than ""BtVS"", presenting more of the hard-boiled detective for its plots and film noir for its style.  This key difference between the two shows is captured in the contrast of their respective theme songs.  Clearly this spinoff goes in a different direction, amply proven by the surprising revelation of the season's final shot (""BtVS"" never had such a last second surprise until the end of Season 6).Second, the decision to have Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) join Angel (David Boreanaz) in L.A. was a masterstroke.  Not only because Cordy's inability to stop what she is thinking from escaping her lips contrasts well with Angel's sullen silences, but also because the two characters had relatively little interaction on ""BtVS.""  Consequently, the character dynamic is new ground.  Furthermore, the characters all change for the better over the course of the first season: Angel slowly but surely develops a sense of humor, Cordelia develops a conscience in the wake of the death of Doyle (the late Glenn Quinn) and her getting the curse of his visions (""Hero"", ""To Shanshu in L.A.""), and Wesley (Alexis Denisof) undergoes one of the most remarkable character transformations in television history from pompous comic wimp to grim brooding demon hunter.Third, Kate Lockley (Elizabeth Rohm) provides Angel with his transitional figure between Buffy and what proves to be Cordelia.  The first buzz I remember hearing about ""Angel"" was that we were all supposed to hate this Kate person, whoever she might be, obviously because she was presumptuous enough to take Buffy's place.  Things never get anywhere close to that point (Kate is not Parker), but that is beside the point.  Even if Kate is not good enough for Angel, and the departure of Rohm for greener pastures means we never really got to see what the show's creators had in mind for the long-term, she opens up the possibility for Angel to move on romantically although we are reminded that this is not a good thing for our hero (""The Prodigal"").Fourth, Angel Investigations functions the way the Hellmouth does on ""BtVS,"" to provide an opportunity to introduce the monster of the week in each episode.  Wolfram & Hart provides an additional source of such monsters for Angel and his crew.  Unlike ""BtVS,"" where there is a villain arc for the first half of the season that joins up with a second villain arc in the last half (e.g., Spike & Dru join Angelus in Season 2), Wolfram & Hart continues to be a presence for several seasons, even if the roster of players changes.Fifth, Greenwalt and Whedon were extremely selective in the crossovers they allowed between the two shows.  Not surprisingly, these are some of the best episodes from the series.  ""In the Dark,"" where Buffy sends the Ring of Amarra via Oz, is one of the best character studies of Angel, ""I Will Remember You"" where Angel spends a day with Buffy as a human is a fitting coda to their star-crossed relationship, and the end of ""Five by Five"" as Angel fights Faith in the rain, is the emotional highpoint of Season One (continued in ""Sanctuary"").  Unfortunately Season 4 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is not due out on DVD until later this year, which means we have to wait for the first halves of all of these crossovers to be available on DVD.How good is the first season of ""Angel?""  The dramatic highpoint of the series has been Darla ""giving birth"" to Connor during Season 3 and while there is nothing in Season One that reaches that height it is a solid season.  Yes, there are some clunkers (""I Fall to Pieces"" and ""Expecting""), but these are more than counterbalanced by some excellent episodes, most notably ""Rm W/A Vu,"" ""Eternity,"" and ""War Zone.""  Season One of ""Angel"" is a lot better than Season One of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and also a lot better than I recalled taken in its entirety.  Both series have been blessed not only by good writing but also by having actors who exceed initial expectations as to their abilities to perform.  This is certainly more true about the three main actors on ""Angel"" than those they left behind in Sunnydale.",5,"Season One of ""Angel"": The recipe for a successful spinoff",1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,4317,"['re-watching', 'Season', 'One', 'Angel', 'insightful', 'consider', 'what', 'creators', 'David', 'Greenwalt', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'did', 'make', 'series', 'successful', 'spinoff', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'First', 'Angel', 'different', 'genre', 'BtVS', 'presenting', 'more', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'plots', 'film', 'noir', 'style', 'key', 'difference', 'two', 'shows', 'captured', 'contrast', 'respective', 'theme', 'songs', 'Clearly', 'spinoff', 'different', 'direction', 'amply', 'proven', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'season', 'final', 'shot', 'BtVS', 'never', 'had', 'such', 'last', 'second', 'surprise', 'end', 'Season', '6', '.Second', 'decision', 'have', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'join', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'L.A.', 'was', 'masterstroke', 'Not', 'only', 'Cordy', 'inability', 'stop', 'what', 'thinking', 'escaping', 'lips', 'contrasts', 'well', 'Angel', 'sullen', 'silences', 'also', 'two', 'characters', 'had', 'relatively', 'little', 'interaction', 'BtVS', 'Consequently', 'character', 'dynamic', 'new', 'ground', 'Furthermore', 'characters', 'change', 'better', 'course', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'slowly', 'surely', 'sense', 'humor', 'Cordelia', 'conscience', 'wake', 'death', 'Doyle', 'late', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'getting', 'curse', 'visions', 'Hero', 'Shanshu', 'L.A.', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'character', 'transformations', 'television', 'history', 'pompous', 'comic', 'wimp', 'grim', 'brooding', 'demon', 'hunter.Third', 'Kate', 'Lockley', 'Elizabeth', 'Rohm', 'Angel', 'transitional', 'figure', 'Buffy', 'what', 'be', 'Cordelia', 'first', 'buzz', 'remember', 'hearing', 'Angel', 'was', 'were', 'supposed', 'hate', 'Kate', 'person', 'whoever', 'might', 'be', 'obviously', 'was', 'presumptuous', 'enough', 'take', 'Buffy', 'place', 'Things', 'never', 'get', 'anywhere', 'close', 'point', 'Kate', 'not', 'Parker', 'beside', 'point', 'Even', 'Kate', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'Angel', 'departure', 'Rohm', 'greener', 'pastures', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'see', 'what', 'show', 'creators', 'had', 'mind', 'long-term', 'up', 'possibility', 'Angel', 'move', 'romantically', 'are', 'reminded', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'hero', 'Prodigal', '.Fourth', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'way', 'Hellmouth', 'BtVS', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'introduce', 'monster', 'week', 'episode', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'additional', 'source', 'such', 'monsters', 'Angel', 'crew', 'BtVS', 'where', 'villain', 'arc', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'up', 'second', 'villain', 'arc', 'last', 'half', 'e.g.', 'Spike', 'Dru', 'join', 'Angelus', 'Season', '2', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'be', 'presence', 'several', 'seasons', 'even', 'roster', 'players', 'changes.Fifth', 'Greenwalt', 'Whedon', 'were', 'extremely', 'selective', 'crossovers', 'allowed', 'two', 'shows', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'are', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'Dark', 'where', 'Buffy', 'Ring', 'Amarra', 'Oz', 'one', 'best', 'character', 'studies', 'Angel', 'Will', 'Remember', 'where', 'Angel', 'day', 'Buffy', 'human', 'fitting', 'coda', 'star-crossed', 'relationship', 'end', 'Five', 'Five', 'Angel', 'fights', 'Faith', 'rain', 'emotional', 'highpoint', 'Season', 'One', 'continued', 'Sanctuary', 'Unfortunately', 'Season', '4', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'not', 'due', 'DVD', 'later', 'year', 'have', 'wait', 'first', 'halves', 'crossovers', 'be', 'available', 'DVD.How', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'dramatic', 'highpoint', 'series', 'been', 'Darla', 'giving', 'birth', 'Connor', 'Season', '3', 'nothing', 'Season', 'One', 'height', 'solid', 'season', 'Yes', 'are', 'clunkers', 'Fall', 'Pieces', 'Expecting', 'are', 'more', 'counterbalanced', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'most', 'notably', 'Rm', 'W/A', 'Vu', 'Eternity', 'War', 'Zone', 'Season', 'One', 'Angel', 'lot', 'better', 'Season', 'One', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'also', 'lot', 'better', 'recalled', 'taken', 'entirety', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'blessed', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'writing', 'also', 'having', 'actors', 'who', 'exceed', 'initial', 'expectations', 'abilities', 'perform', 'certainly', 'more', 'true', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'Angel', 'left', 'behind', 'Sunnydale']",Angel - Season One
598885,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,B00005JLEW,LeftManOut,"[2, 3]","The first season of Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt's ""Angel"", is not going to go down as the best season of the show. During its initial airing in the fall of '99, Angel's first effort could be best categorized as an attempt to find its own niche outside of its sister show ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer."" However just because the first season is not the strongest of the library, does not mean it is not of the most essential viewing. As with all television shows initial season, Angel Season One establishes many central points of the series, including the characters of Angel, Cordelia and Wesley, the creation of Angel Investigations, and the immediate rivalry with the evil lawfirm of Wolfram and Hart, most of which would remain intact until the show's finale. Daring to spin the character of Angel off into his own show was a bold move, but the fact that the creators and writers were able to make such an unbelievable show spring forth is even more commendable.Angel has always been said to be much more ""adult friendly"" in comparison to its counterpart Buffy. This is fairly true. For the most part the atmosphere is much darker, the topics are more confrontational, and the characters lives are more centered on the aspects of adulthood rather than school as seen in Buffy. Season One sees Angel arriving in LA in hopes of getting over his feelings for his lover Buffy. Immediately after arriving in LA, Angel comes into contact with Doyle, a half man, half demon hybrid, who receives visions from the Powers That Be. Until this point in his life, Angel basically just went about his business as he wanted. Now he has been chosen as the champion for the powers, and he immediately receives a higher purpose for his life. After coming into contact with fellow Sunnydale alum Cordelia at a Hollywood party (and then saving her from a notorious Vampire), the trio comes together to open up Angel Investigations, a detective agency centered on cases dealing with the supernatural.The premise sounds good enough. The initial problem was always, what would be Angel's motivation for continuing to fight evil in LA? Atonement just wasn't enough. With Doyle receiving visions from the powers that be, his mission becomes clear. Particularly interesting is the brash move to kill off Doyle 9 episodes into the series, leaving him to pass on his visions to Cordelia, and to make room for yet another Sunnydale alum, Wesley Windum Price, to step into the picture. Once Wesley joins the cast, things really begin to gel for the Series. David Boreanaz, Charisma Carpenter and Alexis Denisof all have great chemistry together, and the bonds that are made between the characters during this intial year are something that will become even more important throughout the next three seasons. Even though his character is only featured during the final three episodes of the year, Charles Gunn (J. August Richards) is also brought in and established to be an important piece of the puzzle.As for the central story arc which was always prominent in Whedon's sister series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel Season One doesn't really have a story running thoughout most of the season. This is one of the few problems with this year of the show. While it certainly doesn't drag the series into the depths, most of the episodes are simply stand alone pieces, featuring a sort of ""monster of the week"" kind of dynamic which was prominent in Buffy's first season as well. While Wolfram and Hart may seem to be the ""Big Bad"" throughout the season (they are throughout every season though you will end up finding out), there's by no means a giant story involving them. Most of the focus is on Angel, Cordelia and Wesley coming together to form Angel's new detective agency. While there are a couple excellent Episodes strung throughout the year (""City Of"", ""Somnambulist"", ""To Shanshu in L.A"" and the outstanding two part Faith crossover ""Five By Five"" and ""Sanctuary"" are among the best the season has to offer), the lack of a central story appears to give the season a bit of an unfocused feeling. This is hardly an inhibiting factor though, since the show itself is so outstandingly done.The characters are all brought to life by their respected actors perfectly. The dark brooding nature of Angel which was always prominent in Buffy, is continued over into ""Angel"" by David Boreanaz. It's even more interesting to have Angel as the central focus of the series, because we get to see all the things we never got to see Angel do during his run on Buffy (seeing as how Buffy is the central focus of the other series.) Cordelia (Carpenter) starts off just as we remembered her from BtVS, but as the season progresses you begin to notice a gradual change in her character, and by the season's finale you start to see the amazing change she will undergo in the following seasons. Wesley (Denisof) is much the same way, appearing to be the goofy, uncoordinated watcher he was in BtVS (although he is now a Rogue demon hunter), and eventually becoming a caring and brave individual. Although Doyle (Glenn Quinn) only appears for half of the season, his role in the first few episodes is crucial, as he appears to be the central force which initially brings Angel, Cordelia and himself together. And Gunn (Richards), even though only making it into 3 episodes, is set up to be the tough ""go to"" guy on the team (and his trouble with trusting Vampires, particularly Angel, is initially explored).The extras on the set are pretty scarce, which as with almost all the Angel/Buffy DVD sets is a huge let down. There's commentary only on selected episodes (I forget exactly how many episodes it is, but it is no more than 6), and featurettes that hope to explain the motivation and thoughts behind the season and its characters. There's also photo galleries, scripts for certain episodes and actor biographies should you be interested in looking into those.Overall Season One of Angel is more of a Success than a Failure. It's not as brilliant as Season Two or Three (by far the two most impressive of the five year run), but it lays the foundation for much of what will come in the future. When it shines, Angel Season One reaches some of the series' finest moments. Inversely there's also some low points, but they are minimal for the most part. Fans of any of Joss Whedon's work should be more than pleased with what they get with this package. Angel eventually became one of the best shows on television, if not the best for its time (eclipsing even BtVS in the end) and it was really a shame to see it end after only five seasons. Have fun reliving all the great times with this excellent box set!",5,Finding It's Footing,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,6669,"['first', 'season', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'David', 'Greenwalt', 'Angel',

598886,A2S9P70216QC2H,B00005JLEW,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[1, 1]","After the first 3 seasons of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Joss Whedon thought David Boreanaz was such a talent actor that he deserved his own show, and they were right. After 3 years of playing the slayer's forbidden lover, the character Angel goes off to L.A. on a new mission of redemption. There he meets a wise craking Irish bad boy named Doyle, who happens to be half demon and a messenger fot the Powers That Be. With his visions, Doyle guides Angel to the lost souls of L.A. he needs to protect. One of them happens to be Cordelia, the smart mouthed ex-rich girl from Sunnydale, who joins Angel and Doyle on their mission in L.A. that creates their detective agency, Angel Investigations. But the L.A. trio better watch out for law firm Wolfarm and Hart, which will be the major villian for Angel and his Fang Gang for the entire series run. Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt create a series that was just as gorundbreaking as Buffy the Vampire Slayer was. The first season is full of refreshing storylines, inventive villians and great characters. Here's Season 1:City Of...-Great episode!! ""Angel, a vampire with a soul, arrives in L.A. to make amends for past when he meets Irish half-breed, Doyle whose visions from The Powers that Be set him on a mission that leads to Cordelia in trouble.""

""When Cordelia has trouble with her roach-infested apartment, Doyle helps Cordelia find a beautiful new apartment...which happens to be haunted."" The first classic episode of the series, Charima Carpenter is hilarious throughout as Cordelia.Sense & Sensitivity-Weak episode!! ""When Kate and the rest of the police force gets involved in sensitivity training program, they all become overwhemlingly emotional leaving Angel to solve the problem."" An embarrasing episode with an embarrassing plot and bad performances.Bachelor Party-Good episode!! ""When Doyle's ex-wife, Harry, comes into town to divorce him and get married to her new finacee, Doyle becomes the target of the bachelor party when her finacee plans to eat his brain.""

""When Buffy arrives in L.A. angry at Angel for not telling her he was in Sunnydale, a demon attack causes them to track it down, leading Angel become human in the process."" Both David Boreanaz and Sarah Michelle Gellar give powerful performances that are unforgettable.Hero-Great episode!! ""When The Scourge, a nazi-like army of pure demons, hunt down a group of half-breed demons, Angel plans to stop them while Doyle plans to make the ultimate sacrifice."" A dark and depressing episode which is the last for Doyle, he will be missed.Parting Gifts-Great episode!! ""Just as Cordelia realizes she has Doyle's visions now, Angel's new case leads him to a Rogue demon hunter."" Alexis Densiof makes his reappearence on Angel as Wesley Wyndam-Pryce and is completely hilarious.Somnambulist-Good episode!!

Penn is a great villian and Kate finally finds out the truth about Angel.Expecting-Weak episode!! ""After a one night stand, Cordelia wakes up 8 months pregnant leaving Angel and Wesley to stop the demon that impregnated her."" While Charisma was great, the demon plot was dull with the lame revealtion of King demon.She-Bad episode!! ""Just as Wesley finally gets a job at Angel Investigations, the lastest case leads the Angel to gender war with strange creatures from a different dimension who arrived in L.A."" This episode wasn't only bad, but it felt out of place for Angel. Just avoid it!I'v Got You Under My Skin-Incredible episode!!

""When Wolfarm and Hart summon a demon named Vocah, he kills The Oracles and disables Cordy and Wesley while Wolfarm and Hart summon a pivotal person from Angel's past."" An explosive season finale with a great villian and some distrubing scenes. Not to mention the revelation of Darla at the end is shocking.A brilliant first season which promises a lot for the even more brilliant second season. The DVD as features some great extras like character analysis of Angel, Cordelia, a season overview, and commentaries are some episodes. It's a great set to own from this fantastic series.",5,The Redemption Seeker-Angel's First Season,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,7542,"['first', '3', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Joss',

I have a pretty serious seven-channel system, and the audio on this DVD set is some of the most enjoyable I've heard on DVD. That said, it would have been nice to have 5.1 instead of 2.0, but they probably only recorded it in stereo, in which case 5.1 wouldn't be an option.

598894,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00005JLEW,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[5, 8]","I remember when I first started to watch ""Buffy"" that the presence of David Boreanaz always brought a nasty smirk to my face. With all those pretty girls in micro-miniskirts, the producers just had to throw a slice of cheesecake (beefcake?) to balance the scale. I had no respect for Boreanaz at all. He struck me as a soap-opera level actor in a sea of stone professionals.I have come to eat my words.Between his first appearance as a guest character in '97 on ""Buffy"" and his 2000 debut as the star of his own show, this dude showed me that A) he could act B) he had charisma C) he was funny D) he could be scary and E) he could be a convincing tough guy, something men who look like him can seldom do.This is not to say that his LA-based vehicle ""Angel"" was as good from the git-go as its parent show was. ""Buffy"" was superb coming out of the gate: Angel's debut is much less surefooted.The story picks up after Buffy's third season, when Angel decided that it was never going to work with Buffy and broke it off with her. Lonely and depressed, but still fighting the good fight, he comes to LA to dust vamps and brood sans sidekicks. Soon however he's hooked up with a hard-luck Irish half-demon named Doyle and of course, the lovely and Homerically insensitive Cordelia Chase, she of the endless legs and million-watt smile. Together they form a detective agency designed to help the helpless, or the hopeless, I never did figure out which, and save lost souls one at a time for a small fee. When Doyle dies heroically halfway through the season (I don't think this counts a spoiler), he's replaced with another Sunnydale alum, the bumbling ex-Watcher Wesley Wyndham-Price, and soon find themselves crossing swords with the apostheosis of all amoral law firms, Wolfram & Hart, a firm that will represent literally anyone or anything, so long as it's evil.The first half of ""Angel"" was designed to operate without the complex story-arcs that marked ""Buffy"" and show mainly stand-alone episodes. This didn't really work and the producers abandoned it after half a season, focusing in on Wolfram & Hart as the Big Bad whose hand was behind most of the do-badding in the city. Other troubles included the abrupt death of Doyle, played by the late and truly wonderful Glenn Quinn, who is treated rather shabbily on the DVD extras by virtue of not mentioning his name or hardly even alluding to his character, possibly due to bad personal feelings between him and the show's cast or producers. The absence of Doyle is keenly felt and not made up for by the arrival of the hapless Wesley, who is always funny but has yet to grow into his own boots. As always, the writing is funny and clever, and the writers seem to delight in the quarreling sibling relationship between Cordy and pretty much everybody she meets.The episodes vary widely in quality, with some truly good outings like ""Somnambulist"" and ""The Prodigal"" mingling with ho-hummers like ""I Fall To Pieces"" and ""Hero."" Anicillary characters like Det. Cate Lockey (Liz Rohm) and Charles Gunn (J. August Richards) provide some sparks, but the whole season has a somewhat stumbling quality to it. Crossovers by Sarah Gellar (Buffy), James Marsters (Spike), Seth Green (Oz), and Eliza Dushku (Faith) meet with varied success, but help to add to the feeling that the show is struggling for its own identity.By the end of the season ""Angel"" was showing more self-confidence, which prefigured the arrival of the much more intense and cohesive second season.

We first was introduced to Angel back in the day where he became Buffy's vampire lover and he was turned into Angelus..he was sent to hell and he was brought back to amend his past. At the end of the 3rd season of Buffy he leaves for L.A. The first episode of Angel has Angel helping out those in need and he has his own little swinging pad as well. Angel is visited by Doyle who is irish and sees mind splitting visions from those who are called The Powers That Be. Angel also meets Cordelia Chase in L.A. as well. After that they form a angency...Angel Investigations. the third episode has Seth Green (Oz) and James Marsters (Spike) guest starring. Later on in the fifth season James Marsters becomes a regular cast memeber in season 5. There was supposed to be a sixth season of Angel where Seth Green's Oz returns to help out with that werewolf girl from season 5 and when I heard that I was pissed...the WB are a bunch of mother****ers. in episode 8 Sarah Michelle Gellar guest stars as Buffy. Episode 9 HERO is the last episode for Glenn Quinn's Doyle in which Doyle dies saving peoples lives from a deadly device. Almost 3 years after this episode aired Glenn Quinn passed away from a drug overdose. in season 10 Alexis Denisof (Wesley Wyndham-Pryce) guest stars and in episode 11 takes Doyle's place. In episode 18 and 19 Eliza Dushku guest stars as the bitchy leather clad rouge slayer Faith and in episode 19 Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy stars and thats the final appearance of Gellar for the series and she was gonna guest star in season five but they wanted to focus more on the main characters. episode 2o, the episode after episode 19..ha...has the first appearance of J. August Richards (Gunn) and later in season 2 he becomes a regular. This season also introduces 3 main baddies who guest star in the rest of the seasons..Julie Benz's Darla, Stephanie Romanov's Lilah Morgan and Christian Kanes' Lindsey McDonald. Christian Kane orginally auditioned for Riley on Buffy but he got this and to note also that David Boreanaz and Christian Kane  are the only two actors who appeared in the first and last episodes of the series. This also brings in the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart who later Angel gets a hold of and runs the place. Fast, funny and intoxicatingly addicting..this is one of my favorite shows of all time.

598899,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JLEW,Mitch Weaver,"[3, 3]","The premise of Angel is very easy to follow. Angel leaves Sunnydale and moves to Los Angeles after season three of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to seperate himself from Buffy. Angel soon runs into a half demon named Doyle who receives visions from the ""Powers that Be"" that lets Angel know who he should help. Angel also runs into former Buffy character Cordelia who is in Los Angeles trying to make it as an actress. After Angel saves her from a vampire, Cordelia convinces Angel and Doyle that they should form a detective agency that helps the helpless for a resonable fee. Unfortunately, after nine episodes in, Doyle is removed from the show, but not before handing his visions off to Cordelia. Shortly after, former Buffy character and watcher  Wesley Windham Price joins the group and becomes the brains of the opperation. There is also an evil lawfirm in Los Angeles under the name of Wolfram and Hart. They soon learn about Angel after he kills an important client, and they want to use all of their resources to make things as difficult as possible for Angel.I am a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. With that being said, I was extremely skeptical before I watched this show. A good percentage of the time, spin-off shows are never as good and Wesley and Cordelia were the two characters that I cared the least about from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I had also never bothered to watch Angel while it was on television, so buying the first season on DVD was based solely on faith in Buffy creator Joss Whedon. After I finished watching the first season of Angel, I was literally shocked at how good the show turned out to be. I feel they handled the season perfectly because they managed to slowly build Angel up as its own show as well as supplying just enough Buffy/Angel crossover episodes to keep Buffy fans interested. The trio of Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley works suprisingly well together. But as much as I like Wesley, Doyle instantly became my favorite character of the show, and he still is to this day. It was a shame that he was only in the first nine episodes, and I often wonder what Angel would have been like if Doyle had stuck around for awhile longer. Fans of the show often look at the first season of Angel as the weakest one because it was comprised of mostly stand alone episodes and the entire season was spent slowly trying to break away from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Personally, I think that the first season of the show was better than the second season, which a lot of people consider one of the best if not the best season of the show. Now maybe I am slightly biased because I am such a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the crossover episodes help to serve as nostalgia for the show. But, the first season just had so many good episodes and was not slowed down by countless flashbacks into Angel's life.As I mentioned above, season one is filled with enjoyable episodes. I would like to take the time to mention a few of them. ""I Will Remember You"" has Buffy come to Los Angeles to confront Angel. They are forced to fight a demon together, and in the process Angel contracts some of the demon's blood which turns Angel into a human. Buffy and Angel are finally able to be together. But Angel is soon forced to face the consequences when he is not able to fight like he used to. This episode will amaze you, and it features one of the most heartbreaking endings you will ever see. ""City of"" is the pilot episode, and it is enjoyable from beginning to end. After the pilot episode, I was hooked. ""Hero"" marks the exit of Doyle from the show, and it was one of the best episodes to come out of the show. ""Five by Five"" brings Faith to Los Angeles, and she is soon apporached by Wolfram and Hart to take out Angel. ""In The Dark"" brings Spike to Los Angeles, to steal the Gem of Amara from Angel which allows the vampire that is wearing it to be unkillable. Oz also makes an appearance as well. ""The Ring"" is a fantastic episode that feels like a cross between ""Gladiator"" and ""Fight Club"" in which Angel is captured by two brothers and forced to fight for his freedom in an underground demon fight club. Last but not least is the season finale ""To Shanshu in L.A."" that supplies a cliffhanger that will blow you away.Overall season one is great from start to finish, and is much better than some fans of the show will lead you to believe. I highly recommend this DVD set to fans of the show, fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer who are curious about it, or people who are looking for a great show to watch. The extras on this set are pretty good as well. I especially liked the season one overview that goes into detail on all the major events of the first season.A solid 5 stars...",5,A great start...,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,4720,"['premise', 'Angel', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'Angel', 'Sunnydale', 'moves', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'season', 'three', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'seperate', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'soon', 'half', 'demon', 'named', 'Doyle', 'who', 'visions', 'Powers', 'Be', 'Angel', 'know', 'who', 'should', 'help', 'Angel', 'also', 'former', 'Buffy', 'character', 'Cordelia', 'who', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'trying', 'make', 'actress', 'Angel', 'vampire', 'Cordelia', 'Angel', 'Doyle', 'should', 'form', 'detective', 'agency', 'helpless', 'resonable', 'fee', 'Unfortunately', 'nine', 'episodes', 'Doyle', 'removed', 'show', 'not', 'handing', 'visions', 'Cordelia', 'Shortly', 'former', 'Buffy', 'character', 'watcher', 'Wesley', 'Windham', 'Price', 'group', 'brains', 'opperation', 'also', 'evil', 'lawfirm', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'name', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'soon', 'learn', 'Angel', 'important', 'client', 'want', 'use', 'resources', 'make', 'things', 'as', 'difficult', 'possible', 'Angel.I', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'watched', 'show', 'good', 'percentage', 'time', 'spin-off', 'shows', 'are', 'never', 'good', 'Wesley', 'Cordelia', 'were', 'two', 'characters', 'cared', 'least', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'had', 'also', 'never', 'bothered', 'watch', 'Angel', 'was', 'television', 'buying', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'was', 'based', 'solely', 'faith', 'Buffy', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'was', 'literally', 'shocked', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'feel', 'handled', 'season', 'perfectly', 'managed', 'slowly', 'build', 'Angel', 'up', 'own', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'supplying', 'just', 'enough', 'Buffy/Angel', 'crossover', 'episodes', 'keep', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'interested', 'trio', 'Angel', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'suprisingly', 'well', 'together', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Wesley', 'Doyle', 'instantly', 'became', 'favorite', 'character', 'show', 'still', 'day', 'was', 'shame', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'nine', 'episodes', 'often', 'wonder', 'what', 'Angel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Doyle', 'had', 'stuck', 'awhile', 'longer', 'Fans', 'show', 'often', 'look', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'weakest', 'one', 'was', 'comprised', 'mostly', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'entire', 'season', 'was', 'spent', 'slowly', 'trying', 'break', 'away', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Personally', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'better', 'second', 'season', 'lot', 'people', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'Now', 'maybe', 'am', 'slightly', 'biased', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'crossover', 'help', 'serve', 'nostalgia', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'episodes', 'was', 'not', 'slowed', 'down', 'countless', 'flashbacks', 'Angel', 'life.As', 'mentioned', 'season', 'one', 'filled', 'enjoyable', 'episodes', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'time', 'mention', 'few', 'Will', 'Remember', 'Buffy', 'come', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'confront', 'Angel', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'demon', 'together', 'process', 'Angel', 'contracts', 'demon', 'blood', 'Angel', 'human', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'are', 'finally', 'able', 'be', 'together', 'Angel', 'soon', 'forced', 'face', 'consequences', 'when', 'not', 'able', 'fight', 'used', 'episode', 'will', 'amaze', 'one', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'endings', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'City', 'pilot', 'episode', 'enjoyable', 'beginning', 'end', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'Hero', 'exit', 'Doyle', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'come', 'show', 'Five', 'Five', 'brings', 'Faith', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'soon', 'apporached', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'take', 'out', 'Angel', 'Dark', 'Spike', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'steal', 'Gem', 'Amara', 'Angel', 'vampire', 'wearing', 'be', 'unkillable', 'Oz', 'also', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'Ring', 'fantastic', 'episode', 'cross', 'Gladiator', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Angel', 'captured', 'two', 'brothers', 'forced', 'fight', 'freedom', 'underground', 'demon', 'fight', 'club', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'season', 'finale', 'Shanshu', 'L.A.', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'blow', 'season', 'one', 'great', 'start', 'finish', 'much', 'better', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'lead', 'believe', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'fans', 'show', 'fans', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'show', 'watch', 'extras', 'set', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'liked', 'season', 'one', 'overview', 'detail', 'major', 'events', 'first', 'season.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",Angel - Season One

All of the cast members are all really interesting and the show is great. David Boreanaz portrays the dark and mysterious Angel and Charisma Carpenter does a wonderful job playing Cordelia. Cordelia makes a huge change from being really selffish to really caring about other people. I was really sad when Glenn Quinn's character Doyle died and sadly he died as well. He was really great but his character wouldn't have worked well with any of the other characters yet to come. Alexis Denisof replaces Doyle with his character Wesley who made a brief appearance on Buffy before joining the cast. J. August Richards comes in two of the last three episodes to introduce Charles Gunn who would join the cast next season.Buffy played by Sarah Michelle Gellar makes two apperances on Angel as well. Her first appearance in I will remember you was much better than her breif role in Sanctuary. James Marsters and Seth Green also make appearances in the third episode In the Dark. Eliza Dushku also appears in Five by Five and Sanctuary.Overall I would say Angel started off great and they really took off in the seasons yet to come. It's too bad they cancelled it but maybe UPN will pick it up instead.,5,The Great Kick Off of a Superb New Show,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1305,"['started', 'off', 'Angel', 'fan', 'got', 'interested', 'Buffy', 'have', 'say', 'Angel', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'show', 'great', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'Angel', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'wonderful', 'job', 'playing', 'Cordelia', 'Cordelia', 'huge', 'change', 'being', 'really', 'selffish', 'really', 'caring', 'other', 'people', 'was', 'really', 'sad', 'when', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'character', 'Doyle', 'died', 'sadly', 'died', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'yet', 'come', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Doyle', 'character', 'Wesley', 'who', 'made', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Buffy', 'joining', 'cast', 'J.', 'August', 'Richards', 'two', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'introduce', 'Charles', 'Gunn', 'who', 'would', 'join', 'cast', 'next', 'season.Buffy', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'two', 'apperances', 'Angel', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'appearance', 'will', 'remember', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'breif', 'role', 'Sanctuary', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Seth', 'Green', 'also', 'make', 'appearances', 'third', 'episode', 'Dark', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'also', 'Five', 'Five', 'Sanctuary.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'Angel', 'started', 'off', 'great', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'seasons', 'yet', 'come', 'too', 'bad', 'cancelled', 'maybe', 'UPN', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'instead']",Angel - Season One
598903,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005JLEW,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[4, 4]","Okay so we all know that Angel was always going to have a hard job living up to the expectations set by Buffy, and okay so it isn't quite as good.  That certainly doesn't mean that this series isn't superb in its own right.  Set up in L.A. we have Angel (David Boreanaz) running his own detective agency with the help of Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) and Doyle (the sadly deceased Glenn Quinn).  It's a lot darker than Buffy, or at least it was when Buffy was still in its fourth series, and some would argue Buffy series 6 to be even darker than Angel.  The main theme is obviously redemption and what we have here is probably the closest to the kind of monster-of-the-week, no story arc material that Joss Whedon and David E. Greenwalt have ever done.To say this isn't as good as Buffy is kind of a cop-out, because there are some absolutely superb episodes here.  In particular there is I Will Remember You, an absolutely heartbreaking episode in which Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Angel are reunited, but only for a day and of which only he will carry the memory.  There's also In The Dark, the closest the show has got to something that's really disturbing, in a horrible torturer character.  This episode also sees the crossover of Oz (Seth Green) and Spike (James Marsters), with probably just about the funniest speech that has ever come out of Spike's mouth starting the episode off.  What will really get your attention though is the stunning, spectacular two-parter where we see Faith's (Eliza Dushku) return in Five By Five and Sanctuary.  Both shows have always shown an amazing tenderness to this character that is practically abnormal among other series, with Faith being presented as a real person rather than your typical bad guy.  After a fairly close-to-the-bone torture scene who can say that they didn't feel a slight shiver down their spine as Faith pounded on Angel's chest begging him to kill her.  This is drama of the best kind, this is chracterisation of the best sort, heck this is TV of the best sort.The rest of the series seems to have a main theme of redemption and lost souls in, appropriately enough, the City of Angels.  Worth pointing out are Lonely Hearts (which introduces the compelling character Kate Lockley - please can we see a return of her?) and Rm W/A Vu, in which Cordelia buys a new house only to find it's haunted.  Hero is one of the most tragic episodes, in which Doyle sacrifices himself to save his friends, something that has grown magnificently in poignancy since the tragic death of Glenn Quinn, who plays Doyle, recently.  After that we get to see the reappearance of Wesley (Alexis), a character which Angel has done wonders with considering the almost universal cringing that accompanied his role on Buffy that has now turned him into a character with surprising depth.  Given his chance to sparkle in the Exorcist-riff I've Got You Under My Skin he really pulls it off, especially given the hint at his relationship with his father that has been threatening to bubble over ever since.  Angel is also capable of pulling a CSI clinical crime like investigation in the utterly compelling Somnabulist, perhaps the most underrated episode of the series, in which one of Angel's 'pupils' comes back to haunt him.  The last two-parter to end the series is also entirely gripping, with the first obvious signs of what was to become Angel's major threat, lawyer's firm Wolfram and Hart.  This is action drama of the highest quality that isn't afraid to get some genuine emotion in there at the same time.Angel series 1 is a show that's trying to find its feet, and it finds them.  Now in its fourth series, season 1 shows the foundations that made it nearly as popular as the cult phenomenon of Buffy.",5,Gothic drama,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,3757,"['Okay', 'know', 'Angel', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'have', 'hard', 'job', 'living', 'up', 'expectations', 'set', 'Buffy', 'okay', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'mean', 'series', ""n't"", 'superb', 'own', 'right', 'Set', 'up', 'L.A.', 'have', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'running', 'own', 'detective', 'agency', 'help', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'Doyle', 'sadly', 'deceased', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'lot', 'darker', 'Buffy', 'least', 'was', 'when', 'Buffy', 'was', 'still', 'fourth', 'series', 'would', 'argue', 'Buffy', 'series', '6', 'be', 'even', 'darker', 'Angel', 'main', 'theme', 'obviously', 'redemption', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'probably', 'closest', 'kind', 'monster-of-the-week', 'story', 'arc', 'material', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'David', 'E.', 'Greenwalt', 'have', 'ever', 'done.To', 'say', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Buffy', 'kind', 'cop-out', 'are', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'episodes', 'here', 'particular', 'Will', 'Remember', 'absolutely', 'heartbreaking', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Angel', 'are', 'reunited', 'only', 'day', 'only', 'will', 'carry', 'memory', 'also', 'Dark', 'closest', 'show', 'got', 'something', 'really', 'disturbing', 'horrible', 'torturer', 'character', 'episode', 'also', 'crossover', 'Oz', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'probably', 'just', 'funniest', 'speech', 'ever', 'come', 'Spike', 'mouth', 'starting', 'episode', 'off', 'What', 'will', 'really', 'get', 'attention', 'stunning', 'spectacular', 'two-parter', 'where', 'see', 'Faith', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'return', 'Five', 'Five', 'Sanctuary', 'shows', 'have', 'always', 'shown', 'amazing', 'tenderness', 'character', 'practically', 'abnormal', 'other', 'series', 'Faith', 'being', 'presented', 'real', 'person', 'rather', 'typical', 'bad', 'guy', 'fairly', 'close-to-the-bone', 'torture', 'scene', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'slight', 'shiver', 'down', 'spine', 'Faith', 'pounded', 'Angel', 'chest', 'begging', 'kill', 'drama', 'best', 'kind', 'chracterisation', 'best', 'sort', 'heck', 'TV', 'best', 'sort.The', 'rest', 'series', 'have', 'main', 'theme', 'redemption', 'lost', 'souls', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'City', 'Angels', 'Worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'are', 'Lonely', 'Hearts', 'compelling', 'character', 'Kate', 'Lockley', 'please', 'can', 'see', 'return', 'Rm', 'W/A', 'Vu', 'Cordelia', 'new', 'house', 'only', 'find', 'haunted', 'Hero', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'episodes', 'Doyle', 'save', 'friends', 'something', 'grown', 'magnificently', 'poignancy', 'tragic', 'death', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'who', 'Doyle', 'recently', 'get', 'see', 'reappearance', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'character', 'Angel', 'done', 'wonders', 'considering', 'almost', 'universal', 'cringing', 'accompanied', 'role', 'Buffy', 'now', 'turned', 'character', 'surprising', 'depth', 'Given', 'chance', 'sparkle', 'Exorcist-riff', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Skin', 'really', 'off', 'especially', 'given', 'hint', 'relationship', 'father', 'been', 'threatening', 'bubble', 'over', 'ever', 'Angel', 'also', 'capable', 'pulling', 'CSI', 'clinical', 'crime', 'investigation', 'utterly', 'compelling', 'Somnabulist', 'perhaps', 'most', 'underrated', 'episode', 'series', 'one', 'Angel', ""'pupils"", 'back', 'haunt', 'last', 'two-parter', 'end', 'series', 'also', 'entirely', 'gripping', 'first', 'obvious', 'signs', 'what', 'was', 'become', 'Angel', 'major', 'threat', 'lawyer', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'action', 'drama', 'highest', 'quality', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'get', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'same', 'time.Angel', 'series', '1', 'show', 'trying', 'find', 'feet', 'Now', 'fourth', 'series', 'season', '1', 'foundations', 'made', 'nearly', 'as', 'popular', 'cult', 'phenomenon', 'Buffy']",Angel - Season One

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 5]","With the character of Angel (David Boreanaz) becoming quite popular on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a spin off was planned and really saw the actor coming into his own.  Boreanaz is great as the tortured vampire with a soul (and even better as his devilish evil alter ego Angelus), and he gets to display more range on his own show than he ever did on Buffy.  The series begins with Angel, Cordelia (Buffy alum Charisma Carpenter), and Irish demon Doyle (the late Glenn Quinn) fighting evil forces in Los Angeles.  The show began pretty shakey, but really picked up momentum towards the mid point of the series when Doyle is dispatched and replaced with former Watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof), whose character really began to shine.  The only real problem with Angel as a whole is that it can't compare to Buffy.  It doesn't necessarily have to, but it doesn't have the offbeat dark humor that helped propel Buffy to the heights that that show went to.  Despite that, the first season of Angel is still some solid TV that is more than worth watching, and just like Buffy, Angel only got better with each passing season.

598913,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00005JLEW,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 2]","First introduced in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as the doe-eyed vampire-with-a-soul, Angel quickly became a fan favourite, and was deemed a strong enough character to carry a spin-off on his shoulders. A drunken Irish lout in his youth, Liam was turned into a vampire by the beautiful Darla, and quickly earned a reputation as the vicious and merciless vampire Angelus. Spreading bloodlust and panic wherever he went, Angelus finally met his match when he fed on a young gypsy girl. Her clan placed a vengeful curse on Angelus: they return his soul to him, so that he might experience guilt and remorse for his centuries of killings. But the gypsies wanted Angelus to suffer for his crimes, and not benefit from the gifts of having a soul - like love and joy - so they added a fatal clause. Should Angel ever experience a moment of pure happiness, when the weight of his soul did not bear heavily on his conscious, then once again he would have his soul ripped from him.Desperate to make amends for the way he lived his life (I suggest watching ""Amends"", the Season Three episode of ""Buffy"" that first hints that Angel's path lies elsewhere) Angel first finds a place fighting next to the Slayer; but on falling in love - and bound by his curse - realizes that he is simply putting her in danger by his continued presence. Now he leaves for L.A., to fight the good fight in his own way - in solitude. But fate has other plans in store...Season One is predominantly concerned with setting the themes and tone of the show to come. Considerably darker than ""Buffy"" (though its sister show caught up in this respect in future seasons), ""Angel"" originally played out like a film-noir detective series. The fact that Angel was a vampire was often inconsequential in some episodes, instead he bore more than a passing resemblance to Batman as he investigated leads, gathered clues, drew conclusions and eventually beat up the bad guy.Angel was initially joined by a fellow survivor of the Sunnydale Graduation Ceremony: Cordelia Chase, the one-time Queen B*tch of high school whose father's tax evasion has landed her scrounging for a living in L.A. and Doyle, a demon-hybrid whose painful visions provide Angel with information of people in need. Later, fellow Sunnydale reject Wesley Wyndam-Pryce also joins the team; bumbling and foolish at first, but eventually undertaking one of the most radical character developments of the entire show.The central theme is ultimately one of redemption; obviously for Angel who has a lifetime of heinous deeds to atone for, but also our three supporting characters: the spoilt Cordelia who made the Scooby Gang miserable for most of the first three seasons of ""Buffy"" now finds out what its like to be like them, Doyle has a secret in his past that explains his painful visions, and Wesley (utterly scorned by the Scooby Gang due to a steady succession of mistakes) finds a new place for himself in Angel's extended family.In terms of structure, the show is rather different from Buffy; especially in its portrayal of good and evil. Of course, both shows explore the shades of grey between the two, but each season of ""Buffy"" pitted the Slayer and her Scooby Gang against a particular `big bad', with Buffy herself (along with her ideals, such as teamwork and respect for human life) as the opposing force of good in the universe. Angel however, straddled the dichotomy of good and evil; with the mysterious Powers That Be on the one side, and the equally mysterious Senior Partners (and their law firm Wolfram and Hart) on the other. Choosing how to negotiate his own path between the two is the running plot thread of this initial season.The unique thing about the show (as compared to the next four seasons to come) is the singularity of each episode. Seasons Two and Five were similar in this respect, having a separate story with a beginning, middle and end per episode, but which also contained a story arc that was spread throughout several episodes - a trend that was even more pronounced in Seasons Three and Four. Depending on your preferences, you will either enjoy or feel frustrated at the way this series is set out: it has continuity in its characters but not its stories.Like any show, it has its up and downs. The death of a regular character nine episodes into the show came as a bit of a shock; particularly since he was immediately replaced by another character previously introduced on ""Buffy"". Although the passing of Doyle's visions onto Cordelia was an inspired touch, making the death so soon into the fledging series and having him replaced by Wesley (making all three regulars recycled ""Buffy"" characters) was a little mishandled. The introduction of Kate Locksley, a policewoman who is both ally and antagonist to Angel, had an intriguing relationship with the staff of Angel Investigations as well as a strong back-story of her own. However, most fans felt threatened by Kate, feeling as though she was an unwelcome love interest bought in to replace Buffy (little did we know, it was Cordelia that we should have been keeping an eye on!) and she was unfairly written out of the show in mid-season two. Given that the fifth cast regular, Charles Gunn, was one of the more useless additions to the show, it was a sad loss.But there are plenty of chances for crossovers with the ""Buffy"" cast: Oz, Spike, Darla, Faith and of course, Buffy herself turn up, and there are other introductions to fun characters: rival lawyers Lindsay McDonald and Lilah Morgan, Cordelia's house-ghost Phantom Dennis, and a range of one-off guest stars. One fun thing about the show is how many familiar faces turn up;  take a look at the first slain vampire of the season - it's Josh Holloway, a.k.a. Sawyer from ""Lost!"" He's not the only one, so keep your eyes upon!",4,"""You Can Make Amends...""",1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,5806,"['First', 'introduced', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'doe-eyed',

598914,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLEW,Robert Moore,"[10, 11]","Although not as good as the subsequent seasons, the initial season of ANGEL was nonetheless both a superb extension of the Buffyverse, and an excellent start to one of the better spin offs in television history.  The first season suffered primarily from two problems, problems that would not be fully resolved until the second season, but which all concerned were able to overcome through superb writing and several strong individual episodes.  The first of these problems was that the initial cast was not sufficiently diverse or balanced to provide the kind of interpersonal interplay that made BUFFY such a spectacular show.  Over the course of the season, the future core of Angel Investigations is introduced, but they would not coalesce into a unit until the second season.  By the end of the season Angel, Cordy, and Wesley are full-fledged members of the team, and Gunn is serving as an adjunct member.  Their coming together as a team would be one of the major themes of the second season.The second problem with the first season was the series' inability to develop a compelling central story arc.  Similar to the first season of Buffy, the show primarily worked within a monster-of-the-week format.  We are introduced to Wolfram and Hart, but it hardly qualified as a structuring tale.  One thing the Buffy/Angel team did to inject energy into ANGEL's first season was featuring many guest stars from BUFFY.  Spike drops in early on for a memorable episode.  One of the funniest moments in all of Buffy/Angel occurs as Spike witnesses Angel saving a woman, providing his own dialog for both hero and saved.  Buffy herself is featured in two episodes, first the remarkable &quot;I Will Remember You,&quot; and then one of the two superb Faith episodes.  Wesley Wyndham-Price shows up first as a guest star, becoming a permanent cast member.One of the great things about Angel/Buffy is the way the characters mature and grow over time.  ANGEL features the two greatest examples of this.  When we first meet Wesley in BUFFY, he is a pretentious, cowardly twit, and he has not progressed very far from that when he reappears in ANGEL as a ""Rogue Demon Hunter.""  Over the course of ANGEL, however, he undergoes a host of experiences, maturing and growing into a fully adult, flawed, yet great human being.  The only character who grows more than Wesley is Cordelia.  Watching her in Season Two or Three in ANGEL, it is hard to realize she is the same person who terrorized the Sunnydale High School student population with her bitchy judgments and arrogance.  It takes time, but in the end we truly love and admire Cordy.  Which leads me to a minor rant:  at the moment, just before the beginning of Season Five of ANGEL, we have learned that Charisma Carpenter, who plays Cordy, will not be returning as a regular, despite her interest in doing so.  In my opinion, this is a grave mistake.  One of the great positive messages of Buffy/Angel has been that people can grow, mature, and atone for their lives.  People can actualize their potential.  At present, Cordy's story has been put on hold by her having been controlled by evil powers in Season Four.  Cordy's story will remain incomplete until her recovery of herself is developed, along with her reintegration into the lives of her friends.  Personally, I think this is inevitable, and luckily, nothing in the plotline prevents it from being possible.Season One is a very good show, but those seeing ANGEL for the first time on DVD will be delighted to know that this set is a mere warm up for the greatness that will unfold in Season Two.",5,A good start to a great series,1061510400,"08 22, 2003",2003,3602,"['not', 'as', 'good', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'initial', 'season', 'ANGEL', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'superb', 'extension', 'Buffyverse', 'excellent', 'start', 'one', 'better', 'spin', 'offs', 'television', 'history', 'first', 'season', 'suffered', 'primarily', 'two', 'problems', 'problems', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'resolved', 'second', 'season', 'concerned', 'were', 'able', 'overcome', 'superb', 'writing', 'several', 'strong', 'individual', 'episodes', 'first', 'problems', 'was', 'initial', 'cast', 'was', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'balanced', 'provide', 'kind', 'interpersonal', 'interplay', 'made', 'BUFFY', 'spectacular', 'show', 'course', 'season', 'future', 'core', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'introduced', 'would', 'not', 'coalesce', 'unit', 'second', 'season', 'end', 'season', 'Angel', 'Cordy', 'Wesley', 'are', 'full-fledged', 'members', 'team', 'Gunn', 'serving', 'adjunct', 'member', 'coming', 'together', 'team', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'major', 'themes', 'second', 'season.The', 'second', 'problem', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'series', 'inability', 'develop', 'compelling', 'central', 'story', 'arc', 'Similar', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'show', 'primarily', 'worked', 'monster-of-the-week', 'format', 'are', 'introduced', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'hardly', 'qualified', 'structuring', 'tale', 'One', 'thing', 'Buffy/Angel', 'team', 'did', 'inject', 'energy', 'ANGEL', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'featuring', 'many', 'guest', 'stars', 'BUFFY', 'Spike', 'early', 'memorable', 'episode', 'One', 'funniest', 'moments', 'Buffy/Angel', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'saving', 'woman', 'providing', 'own', 'dialog', 'hero', 'saved', 'Buffy', 'featured', 'two', 'episodes', 'first', 'remarkable', 'quot', 'Will', 'Remember', 'quot', 'then', 'one', 'two', 'superb', 'Faith', 'episodes', 'Wesley', 'Wyndham-Price', 'up', 'first', 'guest', 'star', 'becoming', 'permanent', 'cast', 'member.One', 'great', 'things', 'Angel/Buffy', 'way', 'characters', 'mature', 'grow', 'time', 'ANGEL', 'two', 'greatest', 'examples', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Wesley', 'BUFFY', 'pretentious', 'cowardly', 'twit', 'not', 'progressed', 'very', 'far', 'when', 'ANGEL', 'Rogue', 'Demon', 'Hunter', 'course', 'ANGEL', 'however', 'host', 'experiences', 'maturing', 'growing', 'fully', 'adult', 'flawed', 'yet', 'great', 'human', 'being', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'more', 'Wesley', 'Cordelia', 'Watching', 'Season', 'Two', 'Three', 'ANGEL', 'hard', 'realize', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'terrorized', 'Sunnydale', 'High', 'School', 'student', 'population', 'bitchy', 'judgments', 'arrogance', 'time', 'end', 'truly', 'love', 'admire', 'Cordy', 'Which', 'minor', 'rant', 'moment', 'just', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Five', 'ANGEL', 'have', 'learned', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'Cordy', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'regular', 'interest', 'doing', 'so', 'opinion', 'grave', 'mistake', 'One', 'great', 'positive', 'messages', 'Buffy/Angel', 'been', 'people', 'can', 'grow', 'mature', 'atone', 'lives', 'People', 'can', 'actualize', 'potential', 'present', 'Cordy', 'story', 'been', 'put', 'hold', 'having', 'been', 'controlled', 'evil', 'powers', 'Season', 'Four', 'Cordy', 'story', 'will', 'remain', 'incomplete', 'recovery', 'herself', 'developed', 'reintegration', 'lives', 'friends', 'Personally', 'think', 'inevitable', 'luckily', 'nothing', 'plotline', 'being', 'possible.Season', 'One', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'seeing', 'ANGEL', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'know', 'set', 'mere', 'warm', 'up', 'greatness', 'will', 'unfold', 'Season', 'Two']",Angel - Season One

598919,A3252E3EF9YOKI,B00005JLEW,"Sanis1 ""sanis1""","[2, 2]","Angel Season One starts as a spinoff of the highly successful show Buffy.  Angel takes the main character (Angel) and another Buffy alumn (Cordy) and adds Doyle (half human-half demon with a connection to the powers that be) and creates a series that is larger than life.  Angel's quest is redemption for the sins of his past.  A very powerful message.  The stories for this season where very one-shot episodes where the story would be resolve by the end of the show.  This mechanism seems as though the creative team was still unsure of the status of Angel and wanted to make sure if cancelled, the characters could return to Buffy without any strings attached.  However, by the end of the season, threads and themes flowed through multiple episodes.  The biggest change at the season mid-way point is the loss of Doyle (infighting between the two actors).  The episode of his death was one of the strongest episode; it reflects the repemdtion of one soul while another fights for another.  The injection of another Buffy alumn, Wes would lead to a very great and very deep character.  At first, however, he was meant as comical relief.  He was a little stiff at first but his character became more then just 1-D character from his days on Buffy.  The constant battles between Cordy &amp; Wes are some of the highlights of the show.  By the end, the character of Gunn was introduced which lead to the final episode, which set up the series for a second season. I would recommand this seasons to any television addict like myself.

598922,AEXGGB9P0MOTN,B00005JLEW,"Sarah Hadley ""I'm a graduate student and Engl...","[0, 1]","""Buffy,"" ""Angel,"" ""Firefly"" - each of Joss Whedon's three television series has been technically a little bit better, and structurally a little bit more mature. ""Angel"" is probably forever doomed to be the forgotten middle child, without the genre-breaking appeal of ""Buffy"" or the pure cult of ""Firefly,"" but in many ways, it's actually the most successful of the three. Mainstream enough to succeed, but still quirky in its own way, it's a solid show that is more consistent, and may actually date better than the series it spun from.What plagues ""Angel""'s first season, as with many genre shows' inaugural year, is a feeling that things proceed on a very ""monster of the week"" basis. There are undermining developments, yes, but most of the plot arcs tend to merely clump a few episodes together with a loose thread, instead of stringing together the entire season. As a result, things can start to seem predictable, and to someone who knows where the story's going...well, it just doesn't seem necessary. Almost every episode can be described with one sentence, i.e., ""Cordelia's new apartment is haunted,"" or ""Angel becomes a celebrity's bodyguard."" Character introductions, developments and consequences are spread so thin that very few episodes truly seem `expendable,' but unless you need to see every single one (or don't know who survives to make the second year's cast), there are really only two essential episodes: the first and the last.Intriguingly, part of the inconsequential feel of the first season may be down to a prolonged separation from ""Angel""'s roots on ""Buffy."" Some of the best episodes bring in characters and links to Buffy's fourth season (Spike in ""In the Dark,"" Buffy in ""I Will Remember You,"" and Faith in ""Five by Five"" / ""Sanctuary""), although they're perfectly decent standalone episodes for Angel and his crew. Angel himself is still basically the same character as before, as is Wesley, although Cordelia has become markedly less cold and snooty and more ditzily self-absorbed. The most interesting character is probably Doyle, and that's not saying much; though he's very well acted by the late Glenn Quinn, it's all too noticeable that when Wesley shows up as his replacement, Alexis Denisof is essentially playing a variant on the same character.So what is there to recommend about the first season of ""Angel""? Well, it's certainly more adult than ""Buffy,"" in almost every way - style, story type, and budget. The Buffy and Faith episodes mentioned above are among the best of the entire series, and there are a couple of wholly standalone, but very enjoyable episodes (""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and ""War Zone,"" especially). The series hasn't hit its stride yet, but it's by no means bad television.The DVD set presents all 22 episodes in their original 4:3 ratio, spread over six discs. Extras are rather thin: the photo gallery and blueprints are pretty disposable, and the three featurettes on disc six are pure press kit stuff. The season one featurette on disc three (why disc three?) is marginally better. Intriguingly, Joss Whedon doesn't appear in any of the video supplements, but he and David Greenwalt share a commentary for episode one, ""City of..."". It's a bit dry, to be honest. However, Jane Espenson's commentary for episode five, ""Rm w/a Vu,"" is a real keeper of a track if you're interested in a writer's perspective, and arguably better than the episode itself! Scripts are also provided for the Faith two-parter, ""Five by Five"" and ""Sanctuary,"" though some may find the screens of text tiring to read.If you're going for a complete ""Angel"" collection, this is an essential purchase. If you're just interested to see what the show is like, I would recommend a later season - probably season two, maybe even season five. Otherwise, these make fun marathon rentals. Get a couple of discs at once and you should be able to blaze through them quite pleasantly.",3,"Season One - a somewhat predictable, but pleasant beginning",1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,3920,"['Buffy', 'Angel', 'Firefly', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'three', 'television', 'series', 'been', 'technically', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'structurally', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'mature', 'Angel', 'probably', 'forever', 'doomed', 'be', 'forgotten', 'middle', 'child', 'genre-breaking', 'appeal', 'Buffy', 'pure', 'cult', 'Firefly', 'many', 'ways', 'actually', 'most', 'successful', 'three', 'Mainstream', 'enough', 'succeed', 'still', 'own', 'way', 'solid', 'show', 'more', 'consistent', 'may', 'actually', 'date', 'better', 'series', 'from.What', 'Angel', 'first', 'season', 'many', 'genre', 'shows', 'inaugural', 'year', 'feeling', 'things', 'proceed', 'very', 'monster', 'week', 'basis', 'are', 'undermining', 'developments', 'yes', 'most', 'plot', 'arcs', 'tend', 'merely', 'clump', 'few', 'episodes', 'together', 'loose', 'thread', 'instead', 'stringing', 'together', 'entire', 'season', 'result', 'things', 'can', 'start', 'seem', 'predictable', 'someone', 'who', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'well', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'necessary', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'one', 'sentence', 'i.e.', 'Cordelia', 'new', 'apartment', 'haunted', 'Angel', 'celebrity', 'bodyguard', 'Character', 'introductions', 'developments', 'consequences', 'are', 'spread', 'so', 'thin', 'very', 'few', 'episodes', 'truly', 'seem', 'expendable', 'need', 'see', 'single', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'make', 'second', 'year', 'cast', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'essential', 'episodes', 'first', 'last.Intriguingly', 'part', 'inconsequential', 'feel', 'first', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'down', 'prolonged', 'separation', 'Angel', 'roots', 'Buffy', 'best', 'episodes', 'bring', 'characters', 'links', 'Buffy', 'fourth', 'season', 'Spike', 'Dark', 'Buffy', 'Will', 'Remember', 'Faith', 'Five', 'Five', '/', 'Sanctuary', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'decent', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'Angel', 'crew', 'Angel', 'still', 'basically', 'same', 'character', 'before', 'Wesley', 'Cordelia', 'become', 'markedly', 'less', 'cold', 'snooty', 'more', 'ditzily', 'self-absorbed', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'probably', 'Doyle', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'late', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'too', 'noticeable', 'when', 'Wesley', 'up', 'replacement', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'essentially', 'playing', 'variant', 'same', 'character.So', 'what', 'there', 'recommend', 'first', 'season', 'Angel', 'Well', 'certainly', 'more', 'adult', 'Buffy', 'almost', 'way', 'style', 'story', 'type', 'budget', 'Buffy', 'Faith', 'episodes', 'mentioned', 'are', 'best', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'couple', 'wholly', 'standalone', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Skin', 'War', 'Zone', 'especially', 'series', ""n't"", 'hit', 'stride', 'yet', 'means', 'bad', 'television.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'presents', '22', 'episodes', 'original', '4:3', 'ratio', 'spread', 'six', 'discs', 'Extras', 'are', 'rather', 'thin', 'photo', 'gallery', 'blueprints', 'are', 'pretty', 'disposable', 'three', 'featurettes', 'disc', 'six', 'are', 'pure', 'press', 'kit', 'stuff', 'season', 'one', 'featurette', 'disc', 'three', 'why', 'disc', 'three', 'marginally', 'better', 'Intriguingly', 'Joss', 'Whedon', ""n't"", 'appear', 'video', 'supplements', 'David', 'Greenwalt', 'share', 'commentary', 'episode', 'one', 'City', 'bit', 'dry', 'be', 'honest', 'However', 'Jane', 'Espenson', 'commentary', 'episode', 'five', 'Rm', 'w/a', 'Vu', 'real', 'keeper', 'track', ""'re"", 'interested', 'writer', 'perspective', 'arguably', 'better', 'episode', 'Scripts', 'are', 'also', 'provided', 'Faith', 'two-parter', 'Five', 'Five', 'Sanctuary', 'may', 'find', 'screens', 'text', 'tiring', 'read.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'complete', 'Angel', 'collection', 'essential', 'purchase', ""'re"", 'just', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', 'later', 'season', 'probably', 'season', 'two', 'maybe', 'even', 'season', 'five', 'Otherwise', 'make', 'fun', 'marathon', 'rentals', 'Get', 'couple', 'discs', 'once', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'blaze', 'quite', 'pleasantly']",Angel - Season One

There's not really a Big Bad except for Wolfram & Hart, who come into play more in the next season and up until 'Angel's fifth and final season. What's missing are the soap opera elements (love interests, etc...) that fans of 'Buffy' looked forward to more than what demons Buffy would kill. There was some fun flirting between Doyle and Cordy and the hint of a relationship for Angel in Det. Lockley, but that's about it. Making up for that though is ""I Will Remember You', the heartbreaking ep. where Buffy and Angel question if their love can still last. But there is so much to appreciate here.

This is a gorgeously shot episode, which also guest-stars Oz and Spike.EPISODE 4: I Fall to Pieces - 1.5/5 - I found the episode to be lame and unnecessary to the show.EPISODE 5: Rm W/A Vu - 3.5/5 - A cool ghost story that doesn't maintain it's interest in the second half, however it picks up in the third and fourth and has some interesting Cordelia characteristics.EPISODE 6: Sense and Sensitivity - 4/5 - A hilarious episode that was just plain enjoyable.EPISODE 7: The Bachelor Party - 2/5 - Had nothing to do with anything that was going on and wholly unnecessary to the plot and story-arc of the show.EPISODE 8: I Will Remember You - 4/5 - A bit overrated by Buffy/Angel shippers but a good episode, however it isn't paced very well.EPISODE 9: Hero - 4.5/5 - Doyle's leaving is very sad to watch but a necessary move for off-screen reasons. I loved The Scourge - I made an analogy that they were like The Nazis, which made the episode much more interesting for me.EPISODE 10: Parting Gifts - 3/5 - The episode starts well but goes downhill in the third and fourth acts. Shame.EPISODE 11: Somnambulist - 3.5/5 - A link to Angelus' past, but not really one we needed to see. This episode contained some cool imagery and fun scenes but it could've been written with a more interesting flair.EPISODE 12: Expecting - 0.5/5 - This was a horrid episode with a terribly bad story. Just watch it, you'll understand what I mean.EPISODE 13: She - 0.5/5 - Just as bad, if not worse, than the episode above. A pointless episode that is boring and plain ugly.EPISODE 14: I've Got You Under My Skin - 3.5/5 - I thought they could've done more with the exorcism idea, however this remained an interesting and stylish episode.EPISODE 15: The Prodigal - 4.5/5 - Extremely interesting back-story on Angel and a heartbreaking current story. One of the season's best episodes.EPISODE 16: The Ring - 4/5 - I dug the idea and really got into the fast pace and neat stlye of the episode.EPISODE 17: Eternity - 4/5 - Angelus' brief return is a very interesting one. This episode succeeds thanks mainly to the amazing performances of David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter.EPISODE 18: Five by Five - 5/5 - An incredible episode, full of story developments that will be brought up later in both shows Buffy and Angel. Best episode of Angel ever if you ask me.EPISODE 19: Sanctuary - 5/5 - Faith is on the road to redemption, but its not going to be easy. Buffy's visit to LA is necessary for her and Angel's conflict and the alliance between Faith and Angel was very interesting.EPISODE 20: War Zone - 2/5 - This episode was deeply boring though it had some good drama and the introduction of Gunn.EPISODE 21: Blind Date - 4/5 - Very interesting character development made on the part of Lindsey and his alliance with Wolfram and Hart.EPISODE 22: To Shanshu in LA - 4.5/5 - A scary and exciting finale with lots of hints for the coming seasons.There were some great episodes, but too many duds. However, I'd say this is a necessary package if you want to start an Angel collection of DVDs, you'll get good use of this set because quite a few episodes are rewatchable.",3,"Inconsistent, but a good start to the show.",1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,3985,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'wanted', 'Angel', 'be', 'monster-of-the-week', 'show', 'where', 'next', 'seasons', 'season-long', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'interesting', 'stories', 'results', 'boring', 'villains', 'throw-away', 'episodes', 'However', 'show', 'great', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'episode-by-episode', 'guide', 'EPISODE', '1', 'City', '4.5/5', 'great', 'start', 'show', 'Loved', 'atmosphere', 'how', 'made', 'Angel', 'seem', 'superhero', 'figure', 'town', 'Very', 'promising.EPISODE', '2', 'Lonely', '3.5/5', 'scenes', 'are', 'overlong', 'are', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'episode', 'neat', 'premise', 'really', 'well.EPISODE', '3', 'Dark', '4/5', 'interesting', 'insight', 'character', 'Angel', 'decisions', 'must', 'make', 'seek', 'redemption', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'episode', 'also', 'guest-stars', 'Oz', 'Spike.EPISODE', '4', 'Fall', 'Pieces', '1.5/5', 'found', 'episode', 'be', 'lame', 'unnecessary', 'show.EPISODE', '5', 'Rm', 'W/A', 'Vu', '3.5/5', 'cool', 'ghost', 'story', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'interest', 'second', 'half', 'however', 'up', 'third', 'fourth', 'interesting', 'Cordelia', 'characteristics.EPISODE', '6', 'Sense', 'Sensitivity', '4/5', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'enjoyable.EPISODE', '7', 'Bachelor', 'Party', '2/5', 'Had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'was', 'going', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'story-arc', 'show.EPISODE', '8', 'Will', 'Remember', '4/5', 'bit', 'overrated', 'Buffy/Angel', 'shippers', 'good', 'episode', 'however', ""n't"", 'paced', 'very', 'well.EPISODE', '9', 'Hero', '4.5/5', 'Doyle', 'leaving', 'very', 'sad', 'watch', 'necessary', 'move', 'off-screen', 'reasons', 'loved', 'Scourge', 'made', 'analogy', 'were', 'Nazis', 'made', 'episode', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'me.EPISODE', '10', 'Parting', 'Gifts', '3/5', 'episode', 'well', 'downhill', 'third', 'fourth', 'acts', '11', 'Somnambulist', '3.5/5', 'link', 'Angelus', 'past', 'not', 'really', 'one', 'needed', 'see', 'episode', 'contained', 'cool', 'imagery', 'fun', 'scenes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'written', 'more', 'interesting', 'flair.EPISODE', '12', 'Expecting', '0.5/5', 'was', 'horrid', 'episode', 'terribly', 'bad', 'story', 'Just', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean.EPISODE', '13', '0.5/5', 'Just', 'bad', 'not', 'worse', 'episode', 'pointless', 'episode', 'boring', 'plain', 'ugly.EPISODE', '14', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'My', 'Skin', '3.5/5', 'thought', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'exorcism', 'idea', 'however', 'remained', 'interesting', 'stylish', 'episode.EPISODE', '15', 'Prodigal', '4.5/5', 'Extremely', 'interesting', 'back-story', 'Angel', 'heartbreaking', 'current', 'story', 'One', 'season', 'best', 'episodes.EPISODE', '16', 'Ring', '4/5', 'dug', 'idea', 'really', 'got', 'fast', 'pace', 'neat', 'stlye', 'episode.EPISODE', '17', 'Eternity', '4/5', 'Angelus', 'brief', 'return', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'episode', 'thanks', 'mainly', 'amazing', 'performances', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter.EPISODE', '18', 'Five', 'Five', '5/5', 'incredible', 'episode', 'full', 'story', 'developments', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'later', 'shows', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Best', 'episode', 'Angel', 'ever', 'ask', 'me.EPISODE', '19', 'Sanctuary', '5/5', 'Faith', 'road', 'redemption', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'Buffy', 'visit', 'LA', 'necessary', 'Angel', 'conflict', 'alliance', 'Faith', 'Angel', 'was', 'very', 'interesting.EPISODE', '20', 'War', 'Zone', '2/5', 'episode', 'was', 'deeply', 'boring', 'had', 'good', 'drama', 'introduction', 'Gunn.EPISODE', '21', 'Blind', 'Date', '4/5', 'Very', 'interesting', 'character', 'development', 'made', 'part', 'Lindsey', 'alliance', 'Wolfram', 'Hart.EPISODE', '22', 'Shanshu', 'LA', '4.5/5', 'scary', 'exciting', 'finale', 'lots', 'hints', 'coming', 'seasons.There', 'were', 'great', 'episodes', 'too', 'many', 'duds', 'However', ""'d"", 'say', 'necessary', 'package', 'want', 'start', 'Angel', 'collection', 'DVDs', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'use', 'set', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'rewatchable']",Angel - Season One
598927,A2WS9FE0NRXAFB,B00005JLEW,Shi Feng,"[3, 8]","I didn't start watching Angel until last summer (A Big Bummer!!!). There are three reasons why I started watching Angel THIS late: 1. when Angel was on the WB it was wednesday nights, my no-tv time. 2. Angel's monsters in there kinda grossed me out(now they are not of course). and 3. I didn't get attached to Buffy (this is probably the biggie). don't get me wrong, I love love love Buffy's character, I think she's cute, strong and cool. BUT, Buffy's storyline just isn't appealing to me. for me Buffy's story is just another one of those monster/fantasy shows for teenagers. Then I heard the news that the WB was cancelling Angel they had that commercial on over and over again "" THE LAST FIVE EPISODES OF ANGEL!!!"" so I had to check it out, so I watched the last five episode. And frankly, 4 out of 5 of those episodes just LEFT ME OPEN MOUTHED, even though I haven't been watching it. so I decided to get Angel's DVD and give it a chance. at first I was planning on buying Angel's forth season. because one of those last episodes I've watched ""origin"" about Angel's son I felt is really strong, and I want to get to know the relationship between Angel and his son more. but it hasn't came out yet. so I bought season one instead...guess what??? I TOTALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH ANGEL. I've watched lots of fantasy shows and movies (including charmed on WB), but Angel is just different than any other fantasy shows I've been in touch with. here are my reasons:1. Angel- I know he's really good-looking and all but I have not expected him to be SOOOOOO COOL. his broody, wise, understanding and many times angelic kind personality just captures me in an instant. His personality strongly contradicts most of other shows' characters who are usually just funny, cool, normal-americans, this includes Buffy. Even when I was not watching this show, I've always been captured by the ""a vampire named Angel"" idea. But I had absolutely no idea how Angelic and dark he can be at the same time. The irony in this show is probably the most well-done I have ever know. When I watch Angel, even I feel protected, that he is watching over me, even though he is a vampire. ( to tell you the truth I'm pretty easily scared, but now whenever I'm scared I think of Angel, hey it works!!!).2. The supporting characters- This is probably the only show that NON of the supporting characters are boring. In Buffy, the supporting characters are just not as strong. Willow is okay later on but she was pretty much a stutter and I just don't feel her character. Xander is pretty much an idiot, he just been put there because the show needs such characters to keep the story moving. Giles is pretty vague, Joyce is just too motherly and always gets in Buffy's way. And Angel, My God, Angel in Buffy is just soooo much different than Angel in Angel. He is also really vague, at times cowardly, and only sticks around for like five minuts. probably the only characters I like in Buffy are Buffy, Faith and Oz. Watching everybody else just puts me to sleep. But Angel's supporting characters are all unique BUT NEVER BORING. I guess it's because of the mature thing. Angel is so much more mature and the the character's speech is funny but also in a mature way. Supporting characters like Cordelia ( she was soo annoying in Buffy but now she's one of my favorite characters in Angel), Wesley ( he was also an idiot in buffy but now... should I say more??), Gunn-you would think he's gonna be vague but the street fighter is also very intelligent, not just all kicks. fred- she is like willow in Buffy but Fred is soo much better, in her speech you know she's brilliant and I just feel it more with her than Williow, Lorne- remember I said Angel's monsters used to gross me out??? At first when everyone said Lorne is probably one of the most interesting character but I didn't believe them. Now I certainly changed my mind- LORNE IS COOL, last is Connor- he's the least coolest I know but he is such an important character and represented sooooo many things I just have to accept him. I don't know much about Doyle- he had potential but he only sticked around for 9 episodes. All of the supporting characters just mesh with Angel and I just love every single one of them. they are just absolutely perfect with Angel.3. the storyline- you would expect a common fantasy show story line, you know- monster of the week, there's a big bad guy behind every frame work and the hero sought him/her out and defeats him/her. hero wins-hooray etc. But NO, Angel is actually very complex and dramatic- even tragic. Angel is comparable to les misrables. and even though it is a fantasy show, it's surprisingly realistic. Angel actually teaches many things that are very true in real life, things people don't think about. And the Irony, my goodness, you can't even count how many there are and how brillian and true they are in real life. And unlike other fantasy shows, or just shows for that matter. Angel actually has a REAL character transformation, not just transformed from weak, naive to strong mature. But Angel's ups and downs are actually more moving than any other shows I have ever seen. It's probably the first time I have seen a major character in a show to transform like that. usually in shows major character is good, and he/she sticks to been good and doing the right thing ( this is also true for Buffy), But Angel's transformation is actually more human and believable than any other characters I have seen anywhere (Big irony there, Angel is not human). Angel is cool, but most important of all, HE ACTUALLY HAVE REASONS TO BE COOL. Angel used to be a scoundrel and loser and not like most other characters on other shows that major character is cool just because he/she is the major character. Angel is also THE FIRST SHOW that makes me cry(literally) and laugh(literally) at the same time.the thing about Angel is that you have to watch it from the beginning to the end ( helps if you watch first three seasons of Buffy), otherwise you wouldn't get it. but once you did, I bet you will fall completely in love with it. in love with its irony, tragedy, humor and realism. And oh, David Boreanaz is such a good actor!! He didn't show much acting talent in Buffy but on Angel- oh my god, he is soooo talented. Still don't believe me?? well, the critics agrees that this is a superior show, it won three saturn awards already, 3 out of 5!!! and the fifth one haven't been decided yet. Cross your fingers and wish that Angel will win the saturn on its fantastic last season.",5,better than Buffy and I'll tell you why,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,6550,"['did', ""n't"", 'start',

The thing I liked the most were the cross show interactions between Angel and Buffy such as episode 8 which takes place right after the events in Buffy season 4 episode 8, Pangs. In the Buffy episode Angel had returned to Sunnydale to help Buffy who was in danger, in the Angel episode Buffy visits Angel in LA and she's not happy. Angel made his visit without telling Buffy he was there and she's just a little upset. I don't want to give anything away if you haven't seen it but if you're a Buffy fan I highly recommend the Angel series as well. Angel season one starts after the end of Buffy season 3 which is where Angel leaves Sunnydale and Buffy for good.

598931,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JLEW,Steven Reynolds,"[1, 6]","Ahh, those were the days. When Angel Investigations actually worked on cases; when each week saw the gang tackle a new adventure with their characteristic combination of brooding, bumbling and comic flair; when each episode was a self-contained story, enjoyable in its own right, and not just a tedious installment in an apocalyptic master narrative so contrived and convoluted that you really couldn't care. Like ""Buffy"" before it, ""Angel"" was wonderful until it degenerated into supernatural soap opera. Season 1 and most of Season 2 worked. From Season 3, it was downhill all the way. The seemingly endless introduction of new characters and over-arching stories might please executive producers concerned with expanding demographics, or story supervisors in love with arcane character arcs and the supposed delight of a meta-seasonal narrative. But the simple fact is that TV isn't watched that way. Each episode needs to be engaging in its own right; each episode needs to be a well-structured, well-told story. Sure, they can all fit together into a bigger yarn - but that bigger yarn shouldn't be the focus. Season 1 managed that feat beautifully, giving us a suite of noirish action/comedy detective stories (some of which hinted at bigger things), some well-crafted crossovers with ""Buffy"", and plenty of both the quirky humour and romantic pathos that are Joss Whedon's stock in trade. In later seasons, the mix was all wrong: too serious, too serial, and ultimately suicidal.  Is this what happens when writers run out of ideas?  Pick of the episodes: 'Rm w/ a Vu', 'I Will Remember You', and 'Eternity' - if only for the line, ""I hear Borgnine's a very skilled lover...""",5,When Angel really worked,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1682,"['Ahh', 'were', 'days', 'When', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'actually', 'worked', 'cases', 'when', 'week', 'saw', 'gang', 'new', 'adventure', 'characteristic', 'combination', 'brooding', 'bumbling', 'comic', 'flair', 'when', 'episode', 'was', 'self-contained', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'just', 'tedious', 'installment', 'apocalyptic', 'master', 'narrative', 'so', 'contrived', 'convoluted', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'was', 'wonderful', 'degenerated', 'supernatural', 'soap', 'opera', 'Season', '1', 'most', 'Season', '2', 'worked', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'downhill', 'way', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'over-arching', 'stories', 'might', 'please', 'executive', 'producers', 'concerned', 'expanding', 'demographics', 'story', 'supervisors', 'love', 'arcane', 'character', 'arcs', 'supposed', 'delight', 'meta-seasonal', 'narrative', 'simple', 'fact', 'TV', ""n't"", 'watched', 'way', 'episode', 'be', 'engaging', 'own', 'right', 'episode', 'be', 'well-structured', 'well-told', 'story', 'Sure', 'can', 'fit', 'together', 'bigger', 'yarn', 'bigger', 'yarn', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'focus', 'Season', '1', 'managed', 'feat', 'beautifully', 'giving', 'suite', 'noirish', 'action/comedy', 'detective', 'stories', 'hinted', 'bigger', 'things', 'well-crafted', 'crossovers', 'Buffy', 'plenty', 'quirky', 'humour', 'romantic', 'pathos', 'are', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'stock', 'trade', 'later', 'seasons', 'mix', 'was', 'wrong', 'too', 'serious', 'too', 'serial', 'ultimately', 'suicidal', 'what', 'when', 'writers', 'run', 'ideas', 'Pick', 'episodes', ""'Rm"", 'Vu', 'Will', 'Remember', ""'Eternity"", 'only', 'line', 'hear', 'Borgnine', 'very', 'skilled', 'lover']",Angel - Season One

At the end of season 3 of Buffy, Angel leaves and goes away from Sunnydale.  He winds up in LA, on a new mission after a half demon named Doyle approaches him and tells him he is linked to the ""Powers That Be"" able to receive visions of people in trouble, and will aid Angel in finding his reason for returning. They are soon joined by Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), also a cast member from Buffy.  Angel Investigations is born, a detective agency unlike any other, they ""Help the Hopeless"".  Before the end of the season, they will also be joined by another familiar face, Wesley (Alexis Denisof).Angel is a pleasant surprise, considering it is a spin off show.  While it is grittier and darker than Buffy, it still retains some of the lighthearted humor at times.  For a first season, it rocks.  Running parallel to season four of Buffy (see my review of that as well), crossovers ensue, with Oz, Spike, and Buffy all making guest appearances on the show.  Of particular interest is Sarah Michelle Gellar's appearance as Buffy in the season's eighth episode ""I Will Remember You"".  This is without a doubt this season's strongest episode, and easily ranks up there with the best that the Buffy show has to offer.  In this episode, Angel is cured and made human, a vampire no longer.  His greatest wish to be with Buffy is made a reality, a realty that proves to be something that he cannot afford to live with, despite his wanting to.  He sacrifices this opportunity and goes back, leaving Buffy with no memory of the day they spent together as mortal lovers.  This episode is heart breaking and if there ever was a tear jerker moment in modern television this is it.We also see the return of Faith in ""Five By Five"" and ""Sanctuary"", in which evil law firm Wolfram & Hart hire the crazed slayer to kill Angel.  Wolfram & Hart becomes the unseen ""Big Bad"" of the show, and will continue to be so for the show's other seasons.  22 episodes of great TV, and a worthy companion to the Buffy DVD sets as well.",5,"Angelus, the demon with the face of an Angel.",1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,2102,"['David', 'Boreanaz', 'own', 'show', 'spin', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'Buffy', 'Vampre', 'Slayer', 'end', 'season', '3', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'away', 'Sunnydale', 'up', 'LA', 'new', 'mission', 'half', 'demon', 'named', 'Doyle', 'linked', 'Powers', 'Be', 'able', 'receive', 'visions', 'people', 'trouble', 'will', 'aid', 'Angel', 'finding', 'reason', 'returning', 'are', 'soon', 'joined', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'also', 'cast', 'member', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'born', 'detective', 'agency', 'other', 'Help', 'Hopeless', 'end', 'season', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'joined', 'familiar', 'face', 'Wesley', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', '.Angel', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'considering', 'spin', 'off', 'show', 'grittier', 'darker', 'Buffy', 'still', 'lighthearted', 'humor', 'times', 'first', 'season', 'Running', 'parallel', 'season', 'four', 'Buffy', 'see', 'review', 'well', 'crossovers', 'ensue', 'Oz', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'making', 'guest', 'appearances', 'show', 'particular', 'interest', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'appearance', 'Buffy', 'season', 'eighth', 'episode', 'Will', 'Remember', 'doubt', 'season', 'strongest', 'episode', 'easily', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'Buffy', 'show', 'offer', 'episode', 'Angel', 'cured', 'made', 'human', 'vampire', 'no', 'longer', 'greatest', 'wish', 'be', 'Buffy', 'made', 'reality', 'realty', 'be', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'live', 'wanting', 'opportunity', 'back', 'leaving', 'Buffy', 'memory', 'day', 'spent', 'together', 'mortal', 'lovers', 'episode', 'heart', 'breaking', 'ever', 'was', 'tear', 'jerker', 'moment', 'modern', 'television', 'it.We', 'also', 'see', 'return', 'Faith', 'Five', 'Five', 'Sanctuary', 'evil', 'law', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'crazed', 'slayer', 'kill', 'Angel', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'unseen', 'Big', 'Bad', 'show', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'so', 'show', 'other', 'seasons', '22', 'episodes', 'great', 'TV', 'worthy', 'companion', 'Buffy', 'DVD', 'as', 'well']",Angel - Season One

598938,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B00005JLEW,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","It all started with Buffy The Vampire Slayer(another great show),the show had reached some succes and was judged good enough to have its spin-off series with the lead character being the Vampire Angel.After negociations the series started production and the first episodes were aired and began airing in 1999 by that time when Buffy was currently airing its fourth season.These episodes from the first season introduce us to the series as any other show would during its first season and the first season is pretty good.It has more than the average 13 episodes any new series would have,instead we are treated to a full 22 episodes season.The first season is strong enough to keep an audience attracted to the show and wanting more.It is here that Angel started his crimes investigations team in Los Angeles,the city of loss Angels(rim shot)along with former Buffy characters,Cordelia and later Wesley and newcomer Doyle who unfortunatly didn't last very long as a character in the series.This is continuation of Angel's history after he left Buffy at the end of the third season.He gets his own show and its great,its more than a spin off,its a great show on its own and even if i think it was cancelled a little early,after its fifth season.Angel(David Boreanaz) has now started his own buisness in LA and recruited Doyle(Glen Quinn,who died a few years ago RIP) and Cordelia(Charisma Carpenter) whom were both great choices.Doyle sacrifices himself to save the earth and so Wesley(Alexis Denisof)comes in as his replacement and does a great job at it but i think Doyle would have been a great character for next seasons as well.As little as it might seem compared to the huge cast in season 5,it works and the crew seems focused even in those early days to create a great show.This season was well made and there is lots of action,drama and even some laughs in it,the show is noticably darker than Buffy as one could tell after watching.The plots were great even in the first season,i found the show started slow but surely and making more impact episode after another.What is interresting is to compare Charles Gun in this season to the Gun in latter seasons as he was at the beggening a vampire killer,struggling and in latter seasons he gets incredibly intelligent due to a brain implant(but is to be seen in latter seasons).Doyle was also a great character but he died too early in the 9th episode ""Hero"" to really make an impact in the series.The cast is great,the show was more on a monster of the week phase like Buffy had in its early seasons and it works,but there is no denying that this season wich is a great introduction and has a few great episodes is the weakest of the five seasons of Angel.The villains also looked pretty great as in Buffy and were great foes for Angel and his crew,it just all seemed to work.So what you get is the first 22 episodes of Angel on six discs with a booklet that gives some infos about the episodes and other infos.Angel indeed proves that Buffy was not a lucky strike but a great show that was able to introduce another and influence some others.Those are pretty much all good episodes and the show is probably at the darkest its ever been and it slowly but surely introduces us good to the show.By the end of the season you'll want more.I recommend this,not to everyone as not all will like it but if you like drama,vampires,good stories,emotions and other monsters or you liked shows made by Joss Whedon such as Buffy then you will probably like this.Its hard to tell who will like it and who will not but i like it and give it a solid four.The four other seasons of Angels are worth checking out also,and there are two types of boxed sets,the original ones like these and the more recent slim cases from 2006.",4,"""The Solid Foundation Of The Series""",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3763,"['started', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'great', 'show', 'show',

598940,A1KCAB6A5E93IE,B00005JLEW,"ty7777 ""I don't give out m'name""","[1, 2]","First off, I am a buffy fan. Sometimes a closet buffy fan, but still a buffy fan. That is the only reason why I watched the first few episodes of Angel. As a guy I didn't really think there would be the same enjoyment of the show as it was buffyless and willowless and faithless and... you get the picture. But really the thing that stands out for me that connects these shows and what drew me to the original in the first place, is the language. The way the writers use language always leads me to laughing when I least expect it. Another thing I like is this thing they do on both shows which reasons that most things are not that complicated. Example? Buffy fights this evil demon [ yeah some aren't evil, that is why that isn't a redundant line ]; a demon that uses its eyes to hypnotize you or whatever. How does buffy fight this unbelievable foe? she just throws a big shovel into its eyes and the whole hypnotism thing goes to #@%. Duh! How hard was that? This terrible demonic power [ an evil power of course ] is acquired by a woman with this glove that when she puts it on she is invinsible, how can we stop her? Get the glove off! Duh! What else would you do?Things like that make me slap my forehead when I watch the show. And both shows have that. It's an amusing element that remains intact with the crossover to Angel from Buffy. And Cordelia is there so she can of course verbally simplify years of plot development in seconds so even people who didn't watch buffy can just go ' oh is that what happened 'Joss Whedon and the other writers have this great ability to write one liners and clever comments that can carry plots which might be less than top rate when they show up. Angel is a pretty near perfect spin-off from what I've seen. Not quite as enjoyable as the first three seasons of buffy that I've seen but, as close as anything can get to it. Same humor/action only Angel is giving the action and most of the main characters supply the humor. And yeah David Boreanaz can carry a show as the main character, but without his sidekicks to be a straight man to, it would probably get old-but since they're there-no problem. Also Buffy characters other than Angel and Cordelia do show up and that is a big help to getting use to the rythm of the new show. The best appearance from Buffy has to go to Spike. The most entertaining bad guy ever! One of the few things that I've seen from Angel so far that have given me a coughing fit laughing is the little dubbing job Spike does for Angel and a woman he has just saved as he watches from a rooftop.

The pilot episode for example has one part where he runs out to his car, jumps in dramatically, tries the key...and nothing.  Then he looks over and sees he jumped into the wrong (identical) car; his car is parked a few spaces over.There is also a great episode involving a bachelor party that should not be missed.  How many shows have somebody admonished for bringing a shrimp fork to devour a human brain?  The whole episode is very tongue in cheek.I don't want to give any spoilers, but there is a rather significant change around the middle of the season that I appreciated.  You'll see a number of cross-over guests from Buffy to start out the show.

598942,A2A80F2UWHZK0L,B00005JLEW,V. Rue,"[1, 3]","Having watched a little of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" I was hoping this spinoff wouldn't be so cartoonish with the characters and dialog.  However, the villians (mainly different types of demons and a few vampires thrown in) were so cartoonishly made up it was laughable.  In this day and age with our technology so advanced I was surprised by this.  The series creator either didn't want to spend the money or somebody needs to fire the makeup artist who creates these villians.  One of the best characters was Doyle (Glenn Quinn) who was a half demon that was sent to help Angel - however they kill him off which I thought was a bad idea and a definite loss to the show.  He added the dimention of a love interest for Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter)if she could get over her hatred of demons.  Doyle's character added a bit of fun and light-heartedness that was missing after he left.  Cordelia's character was made to be self-absorbed, but was really played over the top by Carpenter.  She does get better by about midway through this first season so maybe the writers and her needed more practice.  Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) is okay, but they've written his character to be a little wimpy - especially if they're trying to fight demons who have supernatural power.  That's one of the main reasons why I really couldn't understand writing out Doyle's character - at least he had supernatural strength too.  If you enjoyed Buffy and the way that was written, you'd probably like Angel; however, I was hoping for something a little more adult.  Needless to say, I won't be ordering Season 2.",2,Not as good as I'd hoped,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,1607,"['Having', 'watched', 'little', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'hoping', 'spinoff', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'cartoonish', 'characters', 'dialog', 'However', 'villians', 'mainly', 'different', 'types', 'demons', 'few', 'vampires', 'thrown', 'were', 'so', 'cartoonishly', 'made', 'up', 'was', 'laughable', 'day', 'age', 'technology', 'so', 'advanced', 'was', 'surprised', 'series', 'creator', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'money', 'somebody', 'needs', 'fire', 'makeup', 'artist', 'who', 'villians', 'One', 'best', 'characters', 'was', 'Doyle', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'who', 'was', 'half', 'demon', 'was', 'sent', 'help', 'Angel', 'however', 'kill', 'off', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'definite', 'loss', 'show', 'added', 'dimention', 'love', 'interest', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'could', 'get', 'hatred', 'demons', 'Doyle', 'character', 'added', 'bit', 'fun', 'light-heartedness', 'was', 'missing', 'left', 'Cordelia', 'character', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'self-absorbed', 'was', 'really', 'played', 'over', 'top', 'Carpenter', 'get', 'better', 'midway', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'maybe', 'writers', 'needed', 'more', 'practice', 'Wesley', 'Wyndam-Pryce', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'okay', ""'ve"", 'written', 'character', 'be', 'little', 'wimpy', 'especially', ""'re"", 'trying', 'fight', 'demons', 'who', 'have', 'supernatural', 'power', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'writing', 'out', 'Doyle', 'character', 'least', 'had', 'supernatural', 'strength', 'too', 'enjoyed', 'Buffy', 'way', 'was', 'written', ""'d"", 'probably', 'Angel', 'however', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'adult', 'Needless', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'ordering', 'Season', '2']",Angel - Season One
598943,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,B00005JLEW,Wayne Rossi,"[1, 1]","I first bought Angel to tide myself over between Buffy season releases; I'd never followed the show when it was on the air.  This, it turns out, was a mistake; Angel was one of the best shows on television.  Not that it started out that way, not exactly.Angel was defined as its own show with a different basic format than Buffy:  Doyle would get a vision, and Angel (with help from Doyle and Cordelia) would go out and fix it.  The ""Help the Helpless"" angle would need a major overhaul before it could effectively drive the show; Angel at its best was a show about moral choices, and the show didn't come into its own until it began to deal with them seriously and primarily.The brief Doyle era contains some fun situations, and a lot of classic dialogue.  ""City of"" is wonderful, and ""I Will Remember You"" is deeply tragic (if you watch the first three seasons of Buffy to get the context).  ""Hero"" is really where the series first hints at the tough choices it will be about in the future.  Glenn Quinn's portrayal of the sarcastic Irish half-demon is what makes this fun; the stories themselves are still scrambling to find solid ground.When Alexis Denisof comes in full-time, it's pretty much unbelievable for the Buffy fan - Wesley was the least compelling character in Buffy season 3 by a long shot.  But he starts to grow and change, and by Angel's season 3, he was the most fascinating person in the Buffyverse.  And aside from ""Somnambulist,"" much of the midseason is middling at best.  It starts to pick up in ""Eternity,"" as we get another glimpse of Angelus; the group has meshed well and it seems to be getting an idea of where it ought to go.With the two-parter ""Five by Five"" and ""Sanctuary,"" Angel becomes its own show.  Following up on Buffy's two-part ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You?"", ""Five by Five"" brings the volatile Faith to Los Angeles; Angel as a character is finally presented with a real, hard situation of redemption and moral choice.  His fostering of Faith (a decision that turns out to have consequences for the best) makes for fascinating television, and ""Sanctuary"" solidifies that Angel/Buffy is no longer even an issue.  This is the real, quantifiable point when Angel becomes a better show than its companion.The characters keep making the tough decisions in ""War Zone,"" when the new, tough Gunn must stake a vamp that was his sister, and Angel must win his trust; ""Blind Date"" sets up nemesis Lindsey McDonald as a near-miss in terms of redemption (as if to make it clear that not every lost soul will be won as well as Faith was).  ""To Shanshu in L.A."" destroys the old offices, and puts the show on a footing that can handle its new emphasis on choice, consequences, and redemption.David Boreanaz was still growing as an actor here, coming out of Buffy (where his chemistry with Sarah Michelle Gellar carried him a long way) and into his own part; he did so well.  Charisma Carpenter is not the world's most versatile actress, but still hits all the notes for Cordelia quite well here, and fleshes her out somewhat - but not out of character.  Glenn Quinn is great as the comic side of the first nine episodes; Alexis Denisof replaces him with a funny side, but also starts to grow the layers that will serve him so well in later seasons.Once Angel found itself, it became the best thing on television.  You can see it happen here - and once you have, the next four seasons just become the natural thing to watch.",4,"Rocky start, but turns great",1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,3457,"['first', 'bought', 'Angel', 'tide', 'over', 'Buffy', 'season', ""'d"", 'never', 'followed', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'out', 'was', 'mistake', 'Angel', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'Not', 'started', 'out', 'way', 'not', 'exactly.Angel', 'was', 'defined', 'own', 'show', 'different', 'basic', 'format', 'Buffy', 'Doyle', 'would', 'get', 'vision', 'Angel', 'help', 'Doyle', 'Cordelia', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'fix', 'Help', 'Helpless', 'angle', 'would', 'need', 'major', 'overhaul', 'could', 'effectively', 'drive', 'show', 'Angel', 'best', 'was', 'show', 'moral', 'choices', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'own', 'began', 'deal', 'seriously', 'primarily.The', 'brief', 'Doyle', 'era', 'fun', 'situations', 'lot', 'classic', 'dialogue', 'City', 'wonderful', 'Will', 'Remember', 'deeply', 'tragic', 'watch', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'get', 'context', 'Hero', 'really', 'where', 'series', 'first', 'hints', 'tough', 'choices', 'will', 'be', 'about', 'future', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'portrayal', 'sarcastic', 'Irish', 'half-demon', 'what', 'fun', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'scrambling', 'find', 'solid', 'ground.When', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'full-time', 'pretty', 'much', 'unbelievable', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'Wesley', 'was', 'least', 'compelling', 'character', 'Buffy', 'season', '3', 'long', 'shot', 'grow', 'change', 'Angel', 'season', '3', 'was', 'most', 'fascinating', 'person', 'Buffyverse', 'aside', 'Somnambulist', 'much', 'midseason', 'middling', 'best', 'pick', 'up', 'Eternity', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Angelus', 'group', 'meshed', 'well', 'be', 'getting', 'idea', 'where', 'ought', 'go.With', 'two-parter', 'Five', 'Five', 'Sanctuary', 'Angel', 'own', 'show', 'Following', 'up', 'Buffy', 'two-part', 'Year', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Are', 'Five', 'Five', 'volatile', 'Faith', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Angel', 'character', 'finally', 'presented', 'real', 'hard', 'situation', 'redemption', 'moral', 'choice', 'fostering', 'Faith', 'decision', 'out', 'have', 'consequences', 'best', 'fascinating', 'television', 'Sanctuary', 'Angel/Buffy', 'longer', 'even', 'issue', 'real', 'quantifiable', 'point', 'when', 'Angel', 'better', 'show', 'companion.The', 'characters', 'keep', 'making', 'tough', 'decisions', 'War', 'Zone', 'when', 'new', 'tough', 'Gunn', 'must', 'stake', 'vamp', 'was', 'sister', 'Angel', 'must', 'win', 'trust', 'Date', 'up', 'nemesis', 'Lindsey', 'McDonald', 'near-miss', 'terms', 'redemption', 'make', 'clear', 'not', 'lost', 'soul', 'will', 'be', 'won', 'as', 'well', 'Faith', 'was', 'Shanshu', 'L.A.', 'old', 'offices', 'show', 'footing', 'can', 'handle', 'new', 'emphasis', 'choice', 'consequences', 'redemption.David', 'Boreanaz', 'was', 'still', 'growing', 'actor', 'here', 'coming', 'Buffy', 'where', 'chemistry', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'carried', 'long', 'way', 'own', 'part', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'not', 'world', 'most', 'versatile', 'actress', 'still', 'notes', 'Cordelia', 'quite', 'well', 'here', 'out', 'somewhat', 'not', 'character', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'great', 'comic', 'side', 'first', 'nine', 'episodes', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'funny', 'side', 'also', 'grow', 'layers', 'will', 'serve', 'so', 'well', 'later', 'seasons.Once', 'Angel', 'found', 'became', 'best', 'thing', 'television', 'can', 'see', 'happen', 'here', 'once', 'have', 'next', 'four', 'seasons', 'just', 'become', 'natural', 'thing', 'watch']",Angel - Season One
