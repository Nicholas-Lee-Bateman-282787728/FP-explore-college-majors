Yet, it isn't. It is actually written and directed by Justin Zackham, who wrote ""The Bucket List"" and a silly ""Animal House"" wannabe movie called ""Going Greek"". Based on this small resume, his NYU film school degree must be the reason that he attracted people like Robert DeNiro, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Robin Williams, Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace and Amanda Seyfried to come together for a `wedding' movie.The movie centers round Deniro's character, Don, for the most part. On the surface, they have a pretty normal pampered socialite existence. He's preparing to marry off his adopted son, Alejandro, and having adopted him from South America, his real mother has never visited, until now. Opposed to divorce, being a devout catholic, Alejandro doesn't know how to explain to her that Don is divorced and both his girlfriend and his ex-wife will be at the wedding; the shenanigans begin.A while back, movies like this, with all-star casts and slice of life type stories, were made all the time and then they got kind of old because you always wondered who was going to die or who was going to get cancer. Apparently, nowadays, we're just getting movies that have no punch line at all. Sure, there are punch lines to ""The Big Wedding"", in fact, there is a half-a-dozen of them, but none of them carry any impact. They're just resolution to a ninety-minute movie that threw all kinds of situations at you, one crazier than the other. Although none of them are all that crazy.I would be lying if I said I didn't find some situations laugh inducing throughout the film, but for the most part, the jokes work like a family reunion; your family says some funny stuff, but ultimately they think they're funnier than they really are. The film was written with the hopes that Robert DeNiro talking like a dirty old man would be the selling point and at times it works and at times, it gets old.The strange thing about ""The Big Wedding"" is that the writer/director, Zackham managed to get all of these fantastic actors attached to his film and they all bring these characters to life as good as you would expect. I wanted to like the film and there were times that I thought I would, but ultimately I'm left baffled as to how Zackham did it. His script isn't that good. What little plot there is to the film isn't fleshed out, and almost the entire screwball comedies comedy is placed in the hands of Robert DeNiro saying all kinds of dirty stuff that would make most girls cringe in disgust.",2,HOW did Zackham get so many great actors for such a pointless script!!,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2708,"['Big', 'Wedding', 'all-star', 'cast', 'actors', 'made', 'first', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'Katerine', 'Fugate', 'movies', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'New', 'Years', 'Eve', 'hated', 'way', ""n't"", 'actually', 'written', 'directed', 'Justin', 'Zackham', 'who', 'wrote', 'Bucket', 'List', 'silly', 'Animal', 'House', 'wannabe', 'movie', 'called', 'Going', 'Greek', 'Based', 'small', 'resume', 'NYU', 'film', 'school', 'degree', 'must', 'be', 'reason', 'attracted', 'people', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'come', 'together', 'wedding', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'round', 'Deniro', 'character', 'Don', 'most', 'part', 'surface', 'have', 'pretty', 'normal', 'pampered', 'socialite', 'existence', 'preparing', 'marry', 'off', 'adopted', 'son', 'Alejandro', 'having', 'adopted', 'South', 'America', 'real', 'mother', 'never', 'visited', 'now', 'Opposed', 'divorce', 'being', 'devout', 'catholic', 'Alejandro', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'explain', 'Don', 'divorced', 'girlfriend', 'ex-wife', 'will', 'be', 'wedding', 'shenanigans', 'begin.A', 'back', 'movies', 'all-star', 'casts', 'slice', 'life', 'type', 'stories', 'were', 'made', 'time', 'then', 'got', 'kind', 'old', 'always', 'wondered', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'cancer', 'Apparently', 'nowadays', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'movies', 'have', 'punch', 'line', 'Sure', 'are', 'punch', 'lines', 'Big', 'Wedding', 'fact', 'half-a-dozen', 'none', 'carry', 'impact', ""'re"", 'just', 'resolution', 'ninety-minute', 'movie', 'threw', 'kinds', 'situations', 'one', 'crazier', 'other', 'none', 'are', 'crazy.I', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'situations', 'inducing', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'jokes', 'work', 'family', 'reunion', 'family', 'funny', 'stuff', 'ultimately', 'think', ""'re"", 'funnier', 'really', 'are', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'hopes', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'talking', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'selling', 'point', 'times', 'times', 'old.The', 'strange', 'thing', 'Big', 'Wedding', 'writer/director', 'Zackham', 'managed', 'get', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'attached', 'film', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'as', 'good', 'would', 'expect', 'wanted', 'film', 'were', 'times', 'thought', 'would', 'ultimately', ""'m"", 'left', 'baffled', 'how', 'Zackham', 'did', 'script', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'What', 'little', 'plot', 'film', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'almost', 'entire', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'comedy', 'placed', 'hands', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'saying', 'kinds', 'dirty', 'stuff', 'would', 'make', 'most', 'girls', 'cringe', 'disgust']",The Big Wedding Digital

Yet, every decade they make one, and the Big Wedding's no exception.  Essentially, the story is about a family's adopted son getting married, but the catch is he's Catholic and hasn't told his biological mother that his adopted parents (DeNiro and Keaton) have been divorced for several years.  Not to mention that the father is now with another woman (Sarandon).  Meanwhile Katherine Heigl stars as the sister who's having martial problems due to the fact she can't have kids, and Topher Grace as her brother who's a single doctor and has remained a virgin for years.(Note:  This is the second time Heigl has starred with a former 'That's 70s Show' cast member.)Anyway, the hijinks also ensue briefly with Robin Williams as the priest, but here he's a bit underused than what his was as 'Reverend Fred' in 'Licensed to Wed.'  But it focuses more with the adopted son, Alejandro, keeping things under wraps for his mother's sake.  Whereas his biological sister develops an attraction for Topher's character.For what it's worth, 'The Big Wedding's' not a bad film, it just gets lost a bit at times in the transition with all the stars attempting to make the film work, but the movie does end on a good note.

1484991,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B005LAIIB2,FNDNreview,"[26, 39]","There isn't one specific comedy in the history of film that everyone can agree on as being a good (let along funny) film.  With that being said, you can only expect so much when you hear about the release of another movie centering on a wedding, which happens to have some of the biggest names in Hollywood on its guest list.  It's disturbing to see such harsh criticism for a film that was always going to have the majority of critics attacking it from the get-go - either because they aren't smart enough to see the humor in the situations of a purely over-the-top melodrama, or they're just a huge crank that can't appreciate absurdly hilarious family interactions.  The goal of this genre of film is to make you laugh, clearly by any means necessary.  But, for all of the critical writers out there that thrive on attacking a simple R-rated wedding comedy for the sake of being negative - well, I'm sorry, but you need to lighten up on the elitism and embrace the chaos.  Please, do yourself a favor...and get a clue.  With that being said, here's the review for this insanely funny wedding film, The Big Wedding.Written and directed by Justin Zackham (The Bucket List), The Big Wedding starring Robert De Niro as Don Griffin, plays the father of an adopted groom-to-be, Alejandro (Ben Barnes).  Amongst those on the wedding guest list includes Alejandro's adoptive mother and Don's ex-wife, Ellie (Diane Keaton) - not to mention Don's long-term girlfriend/Ellie's best friend, Bebe (Susan Sarandon).  However, matters become complicated when Alejandro drops the news that his religious biological mother will be coming to the wedding, only she's unaware that Alejandro parents are divorced.  Fearful of what his real mother will think, he asks Don and Ellie to act like a married couple until she leaves.  The secrets begin to build and the shenanigans ensue as the family drama plays out just days before the wedding.  Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace, and Robin Williams also star in supporting roles.First off, if you're not into crude humor, then you might as well do yourself a favor and skip this one.  The sexual overtones are just screaming at the top of their lungs throughout the course of this film.  However, if you like that sort of thing, you are highly encouraged to give this movie a chance before letting all the negative criticism sink into your head.  Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon, and Diane Keaton complement each other surprising well.  At first, they come off as desperate stars dying to stay relevant in a wedding knock-off film, but like most any film, if you give it a chance - it might just surprise you.  The laughs are a bit slow in the beginning, but as the film progresses, you'll find yourself gasping for air.  Just a few of the humorous scenes involve Robert De Niro on a diving board, and a family trip to the church confessional - which includes an appearance by Robin Williams as a priest.It's difficult to say the acting is anything special in the film.  After all, the whole point of the story is to show how dysfunctional a family can be when they're finally all in the same place.  It's hardly believable that even the most dysfunctional families can be this messed up.  The depth of these characters is hardly worth discussing, but if you can see past all of the nonsensical sexual references aside, there is a great deal of heart to be found in this film.  The story is silly, the cast is vulgar, but once again, if you like that sort of thing, then you might just laugh harder than you have in quite some time.  This is nothing more than a light-hearted film targeted towards an older crowd - and women, too.Overall, the film is short (90 minutes), sweet, and to the point.  It features family dysfunction at its finest, not to mention a great deal fun-poking at the Catholic Church.  In any event, there's relatively no theme to be taken from this film, other than some people might be better off not getting married.  Still, it's a humorous good time at the movies, and depending on your sense of humor, The Big Wedding might be a good choice to see if you're tired of drama and action flicks.Overall Film Grade:  B-FNDNreview.com",4,Family dysfunction at its finest at 'The Big Wedding',1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,4179,"[""n't"", 'one', 'specific', 'comedy', 'history', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'agree', 'being', 'good', 'let', 'funny', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'can', 'only', 'expect', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'hear', 'release', 'movie', 'centering', 'wedding', 'have', 'biggest', 'names', 'Hollywood', 'guest', 'list', 'disturbing', 'see', 'such', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'film', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'have', 'majority', 'critics', 'attacking', 'get-go', 'are', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'see', 'humor', 'situations', 'purely', 'over-the-top', 'melodrama', ""'re"", 'just', 'huge', 'crank', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'absurdly', 'hilarious', 'family', 'interactions', 'goal', 'genre', 'film', 'make', 'laugh', 'clearly', 'means', 'necessary', 'critical', 'writers', 'there', 'thrive', 'attacking', 'simple', 'R-rated', 'wedding', 'comedy', 'sake', 'being', 'negative', 'well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'need', 'lighten', 'up', 'elitism', 'embrace', 'chaos', 'Please', 'do', 'favor', 'get', 'clue', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'review', 'insanely', 'funny', 'wedding', 'film', 'Big', 'Wedding.Written', 'directed', 'Justin', 'Zackham', 'Bucket', 'List', 'Big', 'Wedding', 'starring', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Don', 'Griffin', 'father', 'adopted', 'groom-to-be', 'Alejandro', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'Amongst', 'wedding', 'guest', 'list', 'Alejandro', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Don', 'ex-wife', 'Ellie', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'not', 'mention', 'Don', 'long-term', 'girlfriend/Ellie', 'best', 'friend', 'Bebe', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'However', 'matters', 'become', 'complicated', 'when', 'Alejandro', 'news', 'religious', 'biological', 'mother', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'wedding', 'only', 'unaware', 'Alejandro', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'Fearful', 'what', 'real', 'mother', 'will', 'think', 'Don', 'Ellie', 'act', 'married', 'couple', 'secrets', 'begin', 'build', 'shenanigans', 'ensue', 'family', 'drama', 'out', 'just', 'days', 'wedding', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'also', 'star', 'supporting', 'roles.First', 'off', ""'re"", 'not', 'crude', 'humor', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'favor', 'skip', 'one', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'are', 'just', 'screaming', 'top', 'lungs', 'course', 'film', 'However', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'are', 'highly', 'encouraged', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'letting', 'negative', 'criticism', 'sink', 'head', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'complement', 'other', 'surprising', 'well', 'first', 'come', 'off', 'desperate', 'stars', 'dying', 'stay', 'relevant', 'wedding', 'knock-off', 'film', 'most', 'film', 'give', 'chance', 'might', 'just', 'surprise', 'laughs', 'are', 'bit', 'slow', 'beginning', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'gasping', 'air', 'Just', 'few', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'diving', 'board', 'family', 'trip', 'church', 'confessional', 'appearance', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'priest.It', 'difficult', 'say', 'acting', 'anything', 'special', 'film', 'whole', 'point', 'story', 'show', 'how', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'when', ""'re"", 'finally', 'same', 'place', 'hardly', 'believable', 'even', 'most', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'can', 'be', 'messed', 'up', 'depth', 'characters', 'hardly', 'worth', 'discussing', 'can', 'see', 'nonsensical', 'sexual', 'references', 'aside', 'great', 'deal', 'heart', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'story', 'silly', 'cast', 'vulgar', 'once', 'again', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'then', 'might', 'just', 'harder', 'have', 'quite', 'time', 'nothing', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'film', 'targeted', 'towards', 'older', 'crowd', 'women', 'too.Overall', 'film', 'short', '90', 'minutes', 'sweet', 'point', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'finest', 'not', 'mention', 'great', 'deal', 'fun-poking', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'event', 'relatively', 'theme', 'be', 'taken', 'film', 'other', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'not', 'getting', 'married', 'Still', 'humorous', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'depending', 'sense', 'humor', 'Big', 'Wedding', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'see', ""'re"", 'tired', 'drama', 'action', 'flicks.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'B-FNDNreview.com']",The Big Wedding Digital

On paper it looks like it should be a winner and it certainly became a magnet for the older generation of actors who seem to be featured rather regularly in what appears to be a trend. It is great to see the old pros don new clothes, but with a storyline as lame as this and a dialogue that is based on potty mouth and retirement age sex jokes it wears out its welcome very quickly. Justin Zackham of `Going Greek', `Lights out' and 'The Bucket list' fame wrote and directed this adaptation of the French farce ""Mon fr&egrave;re se marie"".The Dysfunctional Famiy Story: Don Robert DeNiro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) were once married and have two children, newly divorced lawyer Lyla (Katherine Heigl) and still a virgin at 30 Jared (Topher Grace). They adopted a boy from Colombia, Alejandro (Ben Barnes). Eventually they divorce, Ellie moves away and Don hooks up with Bebe (Susan Sarandan), Ellie's best friend. When Alejandro is about to get married, he informs Don And Ellie that he never told his natural mother who is so traditional that they got divorced. And she is coming for the wedding so he asks them if they can pretend to still be married. Don and Ellie reluctantly agree to it and Bebe moves out who is also upset that Don for some reason doesn't want to commit. Toss in an alcoholic priest (Robin Williams), Alejandro's intended bride Missy (Amanda Seyfried), and Missy's silly parents (Christine Ebersole and David Rasche) and it looks like the weekend should work. It doesn't and that is embarrassing. This film deserved an `Agent Beware' sign for all these fine actors.

1485000,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B005LAIIB2,Gryphonisle,"[15, 22]","""The Big Wedding"" illustrates a growing problem with retail online streaming:  It's based on a French film about a Swiss family whose adopted Vietnamese son is getting married, yet we can't check out the original as Amazon's foreign collection is contracting at about the speed of America's mom and pop video stores.  Unless you want to buy a hard copy---and not a US playable version---for $53. you're out of luck.  Same for ""Tatie Danielle"".In any event, the American version devolves to a single subject fairly quickly, and who would be surprised:  Sex.  It's all about sex.  Fortunately, unlike a Nora Ephron or Nancy Meyers work, we are spared the trauma of seeing an aging star naked.  That said, Diane Keaton seems to be reprising her ""Something's Gotta Give"" role, down to dressing from the same closet.The nutshell version is that Allejandro,  the adopted, Colombian, Harvard Grad son, of an affluent east coast American family is getting married (Ken Barnes/Amanda Seyfried).  The families are coming to Allejandro's adopted home, for the wedding;  his adopted brother and sister;  his adopted mom (Diane Keaton) who divorced her husband, the Dad (Robert De Nero), who has spent much of the last decade living with his unmarried partner (Susan Sarandon), who is Keaton's best friend.  The in-laws---parents only---are also coming, and are the Evil Republicans.  Oh, and on the morning his mother and sister arrive from Colombia, Allejandro lets everybody know that, well, since he never thought they'd ever board a plane, he'd neglected to tell his conservative, Catholic, mom that his adoptive parents had divorced and the woman who'd raised him for much of the last decade, and who is sleeping with his ""dad"", isn't married to him.So the original couple has to play married, and Susan Sarandon disappears for about five minutes, before returning as the caterer.We've been down this road before in some pretty big and Classic films.  Everything works out in the end.Being a modern film, there are some suggestions of a story that got left out, without being cleaned up for the final presentation.  At some point, Sarandon's pug dogs--which clearly were meant to play a key comic role---were written out, but the evidence of that story line was not fully erased from the film.  Allejandro's adoptive sister (Katherine Heigl) seems to suggest when telling her filandering dad that she got all of his genes, that her baby is not by the husband from whom she's separated, but that line doesn't go anywhere, either.And eventually we get to the wedding, which goes off with only a minor hitch, but that would be a spoiler.Throughout the movie, all the pretty people live in a lovely neutral world furnished according to the Pottery Barn Catalog.  The Republican parents are worried about ""beige grandkids"" (which didn't seem to bother the Bush family) but are themselves only discernable as Republicans by the Mom's bizarre birds nest hair, and their bigotry.  Then again, what's so liberal about anyone else?  This is a retail version of the world, where people discuss nothing of consequence and thus the differences all come down to style.  In the end, every character has the same thing in common---sex and lies.We're told that movies with older actors, about older people is the New Market.  This movie is not an encouraging entry.  It may have mostly older actors, but the script has that 30-something American's obsession with sex.  It's like that's all we live for, and all that defines us.  I don't think so, but the earnestness with which the actors make such fools of themselves seems to say they do.Whatever.  It's light entertainment.  If you approach it that way it's an entertaining film.  I've seen much worse, including the one about two fifty year old golf buddies who head off to Palm Springs, which I tried to watch before this one.  Yes, it could be much worse, but that's not the way I prefer to endorse a film, or anything else.",3,"Big Stars, Glossy Production, Lots of Humor But Ultimately A Shallow Effort.

Adapted from John St&eacute;phane-Bron's original screenplay ""Mon fr&egrave;re se marie"" we watch a comedy of errors as these good folks try to sort things out.If you look at the cast, you know this is for ""People of a certain age...""* Robert De Niro (""Silver Linings Playbook"") is Don, the groom's father, who has to let his mistress of eight years move to a hotel while he pretends to still be married to the mother of his children.* Dianne Keaton (""Darling Companion"") is Ellie, who, eight years ago, lost her husband of twenty years to her best friend. Even though the divorce was amicable, things ARE a bit awkward.* Susan Sarandon (""Snitch"") plays Bebe, the ""other"" woman, AND Ellie's former best friend.* Katherine Heigl (''Life as We Know It"") is their eldest daughter Lyla, who is in the throes of a divorce but hasn't told her parents yet.* Topher Grace (""The Double"") is Jared, always loyal to his brother and sister but also working on his own growth as a man.* Amanda Seyfried (""Les Miserables"") plays Missy, the bride, with her own drama as her parents unveil some of THEIR secrets.* Ben Barnes (""Chronicles of Narnia"") impressed me as Alejandro, their son who was adopted from Columbia. He's the groom and his birth mother is the one they are deceiving. This British-born actor not only spoke American, but he seemed to speak Spanish pretty well, too.This is light, silly, contrived and a bit vulgar.

1485038,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B005LAIIB2,judy,"[0, 0]","Yikes! I just now realized I watched this film 4 days ago before reviewing it. That must tell you how important the film was to me. Not a bit. This film definitely takes a spot on my ever changing Top 10 Worst films of 2013 list. And not even at the bottom, it's got one of the top five spots. Nothing about this movie was good. But I should have guessed this would have been the case from two warnings I received. First off we have the large change of release dates from October 2012 to April 2013. I would normally shrug this off, as post production trouble, or marketing strategy, but the film was already receiving ads on television marking the October date when it was moved. I then began to fear that the study was trying to rid the film, as they were worried it was going to fail. The next warning was the ensemble cast tag that spread across the trailers and posters. I hate ensembles. I wanna like them, but I usually don't. Some work (Expendables, at least for the most part) and most don't (Valentine's Day, Movie 43, New Years Eve, etc). The point is, from the beginning I knew the film wasn't going to be good, or evening ok. But I never thought once that it would be this bad. But it was. Onto my review of The Big Wedding.In 'The Big Wedding' long divorced couple Don and Ellie Griffin (Robert De Niro and Diana Keaton) are once again forced to play the happy couple for the sake of their adopted son's wedding after his biological mother comes to attend the wedding.Let me talk about the script. The script is complete garbage. The script reads like a how-to manual, but just the first draft of that how-to manual. The writers swung out with supposed jokes, but each missed the impact and fell helplessly into the dark abyssal of which this film is. The film try's to be funny, and act as a romantic dramedy but the drama and the comedy is stale and tasteless and nothing seems to work here. Of course there isn't much materiel to work with. The script basically reads as follows 'Please insert 10 stars and have them do all sorts of random things, oh and also end the film with a wedding'. Yes, that is how the film acts. The script, makes little sense, and is very brainless as to what would really go on in those situations. I know they make the things different to be funny, but it's not, it isn't. The script just isn't funny whatsoever.And ofcourse we get those weird lines, as if the script wasn't already hard enough to swallow, we have to gauge down those completely ridicules lines. The dialogue is cheesy, weird, awkward, and self-centered at times. Not to mention the lines laid out by the priest, that come out offensive.The characters are beyond unlikable, it's unbelievable. What I'm saying is that you'd think with such a solid ensemble of a cast that the characters would at least be likable and relatable, but they're not. Best examples of this are Topher Grace's and Robert De Niro's characters. What's wrong with these guys is that they were probably meant to be nice guys, but they aren't. Grace's character is a weird, stalker like, sex obsesser, not to mention acts like he's going to rape the girl he wants to have at it with. De Niro's character on the other hand is just a clean old jerk. He is supposed to love Susan Sarandon's character a lot, but sleeps with his ex? And then when confronted about it shrugs it off and acts like it was no biggy. And all this time the viewer is left thinking 'That schmock'. I mean how bad can you character's be? Not to mention Seyfried's parents in the film. Those to have some major issues, but it's not so bad, because they were written out as jerks, but De Niro and Grace's characters weren't. That's what makes them bad.The film is highly lazy. When it gets a chance to take a wildcard, it doesn't. That's what makes the film so predictable. Nothing we watch in this film is anything but what we saw already before in the last rom-com Katherine Heigl starred in. Plot twists or so they call them, are predicted well before we are informed on film of their existence. Not that it would have made any difference if we weren't aware of them; they aren't of any spectacular mind blowing 'I did not see that coming' ness. Stale, stale, stale, stale, stale.It's a shame how bad this film was. It spoiled the overly talented cast. Well all except for, say Katherine Heigl, and Robin Williams whose careers are already in the bag by now. Actually Heigl's career never even got out of the bag, and that's not very good. But who I'm saying was spoiled here were Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon, Diana Keaton, and Topher Grace. Actors and Actresses who still had a career. Well, they've all just about lost it, with this.The film's pace is pretty quick, with the films runtime being an hour and 40 minutes, the film breezes by and when we get to the film's ending it feels like a half an hour special. It helps make this film somewhat easier to sit through, but I felt it doesn't work with plot movie, it just skips around really, and it doesn't help but it doesn't exactly hurt the film.All and All the film is overly predictable, and spoils the talented cast with a script that is unfunny, and whose characters are unlikable.

The movies laughs are few and far between and are mostly cringe worthy or slap your head worthy.  I mean the movie tries hard to be funny but the biggest problem is not the comedy but the fact that it has way too many stories going on at one time and seems to be lost in its own lack of direction.Big Wedding tries to be a romantic comedy and probably succeed more in that respect that actually being a laugh out loud comedy of that which fails miserably.  Between the awkward oversexed cheating ex husband and the tension (or lack thereof) between him and the ex-wife and Bebe ( the best friend who cheated with the ex-husband, or the pregnant daughter who cant have a baby and doesn't know she is pregnant throughout the whole movie even though she throws up the whole time, or the virgin brother who gets the hots for the Columbian who doesn't know any inhibitions, or the Tammy Faye look alike who knows no tact, or the blah blah blah blah.See what I mean...way too much going on in this movie with characters that seem to lack chemistry or have any cohesiveness that really compels to be believe the situation or the romance that is involved.Not the worst movie I have ever seen and if there is nothing else on, it is watchable, but with the cast I expected way more.",2,Too much going on in this movie,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1588,"['big', 'wedding', 'movie', 'long-divorced', 'couple', 'De', 'Niro', 'Keaton', 'who', 'fakes', 'being', 'married', 'family', 'wedding.I', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'considering', 'star', 'power', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'terms', 'quality', 'comedy', 'movies', 'laughs', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'are', 'mostly', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'slap', 'head', 'worthy', 'mean', 'movie', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'biggest', 'problem', 'not', 'comedy', 'fact', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'going', 'one', 'time', 'be', 'lost', 'own', 'lack', 'direction.Big', 'Wedding', 'tries', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'probably', 'succeed', 'more', 'respect', 'actually', 'being', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'comedy', 'miserably', 'awkward', 'oversexed', 'cheating', 'ex', 'husband', 'tension', 'lack', 'thereof', 'ex-wife', 'Bebe', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'cheated', 'ex-husband', 'pregnant', 'daughter', 'who', 'cant', 'have', 'baby', ""n't"", 'know', 'pregnant', 'whole', 'movie', 'even', 'up', 'whole', 'time', 'virgin', 'brother', 'who', 'hots', 'Columbian', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'inhibitions', 'Tammy', 'Faye', 'look', 'who', 'tact', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'what', 'mean', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'movie', 'characters', 'seem', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'have', 'cohesiveness', 'really', 'be', 'believe', 'situation', 'romance', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'nothing', 'else', 'watchable', 'cast', 'expected', 'way', 'more']",The Big Wedding Digital

The main problem for me was that each character had a separate storyline (problem to resolve) associated with them which I suppose, in theory, was to be resolved by this time spent at the wedding; but not enough time was spent on any of the storylines, so for most of the movie you had the basics of the problem, but you weren't invested in it.  You didn't know what caused it or anything besides the problem existed.  Why was Jared a 30-year old virgin? Why was Lyla separated?  Why was Alejandro adopted?  What happened between Ellie & Bebe?

The portrayal of Catholics as hypocritical drunkards who are infatuated with rigid hierarchy is unfair.  Moreover, it is unethical and unrealistic to portray an incestuous, age heterogamous, sexual relationship on screen.  This upstanding, young, ob/gyn doctor pledged his virginity at the start of the movie, and his step-sister, nine years his junior, took advantage of him.  She basically raped him, forcing him to engage in acts he was not ready for, and would be happier saving for marriage.  How is this sending the right message to our young women?  Women have no right forcing men to engage in acts they would rather save for their wedding night.  I don't see how rape and coercion are romantic in the slightest.  She is sending the wrong message at every turn, by her clothing choices, and habits.  The parents aren't much better: they're all sleeping amongst themselves, and seem to send the message that open marriages are somehow OK.  I wish these people would understand that the true heroes in our world are those who engage in true monogamy for life, not serial monogamy.It'd be nice if these bigshot, Los Angeles screenwriters could come up with something more wholesome.  Why they couldn't make a film about a nice, wholesome courtship, where two pure people commit their lives to each other?  Why do these people have so much family drama?  Why does everything have to be about infidelity, incest, and sex?  How am I supposed to daydream about my own perfect marriage and perfect wedding if all I see are images of depressing unions between imperfect people?  Why can't we have images of perfect people, so we can aspire to be more like them?  Is it too much to ask for better role models in our romantic comedies? I shouldn't have to turn to the Bible for my only source of inspiration.  I wish these screenwriter fat cats could go back to the clean romantic comedy era, a time when men like Cary Grant actually courted women like Katharine Hepburn.  Where is the romance?  Where is the true love?  Gone, along with our last shreds of propriety.Thank you, Women's Liberation, for destroying my ability to daydream about my perfect, future husband, my perfect, future marriage, and my perfect, future wedding ceremony.",1,Insulting to Catholics,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,2371,"['thought', 'was', 'OK', 'gave', 'happy', 'ending', 'pick-me-up', 'was', 'looking', 'failed', 'inspire', 'towards', 'greater', 'religiosity', 'portrayal', 'Catholics', 'hypocritical', 'drunkards', 'who', 'are', 'infatuated', 'rigid', 'hierarchy', 'unfair', 'Moreover', 'unethical', 'unrealistic', 'portray', 'incestuous', 'age', 'heterogamous', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'screen', 'upstanding', 'young', 'ob/gyn', 'doctor', 'pledged', 'virginity', 'start', 'movie', 'step-sister', 'nine', 'years', 'junior', 'took', 'advantage', 'basically', 'raped', 'forcing', 'engage', 'acts', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'would', 'be', 'happier', 'saving', 'marriage', 'How', 'sending', 'right', 'message', 'young', 'women', 'Women', 'have', 'right', 'forcing', 'men', 'engage', 'acts', 'would', 'rather', 'save', 'wedding', 'night', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'rape', 'coercion', 'are', 'romantic', 'slightest', 'sending', 'wrong', 'message', 'turn', 'clothing', 'choices', 'habits', 'parents', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', ""'re"", 'sleeping', 'amongst', 'seem', 'send', 'message', 'open', 'marriages', 'are', 'somehow', 'OK', 'wish', 'people', 'would', 'understand', 'true', 'heroes', 'world', 'are', 'who', 'engage', 'true', 'monogamy', 'life', 'not', 'serial', 'monogamy.It', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'bigshot', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'screenwriters', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'more', 'wholesome', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'nice', 'wholesome', 'courtship', 'where', 'two', 'pure', 'people', 'commit', 'lives', 'other', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'family', 'drama', 'Why', 'everything', 'have', 'be', 'infidelity', 'incest', 'sex', 'How', 'am', 'supposed', 'daydream', 'own', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'perfect', 'wedding', 'see', 'are', 'images', 'depressing', 'unions', 'imperfect', 'people', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'images', 'perfect', 'people', 'can', 'aspire', 'be', 'more', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'better', 'role', 'models', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'turn', 'Bible', 'only', 'source', 'inspiration', 'wish', 'screenwriter', 'fat', 'cats', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'clean', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'era', 'time', 'when', 'men', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'actually', 'courted', 'women', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Where', 'romance', 'Where', 'true', 'love', 'Gone', 'last', 'shreds', 'propriety.Thank', 'Women', 'Liberation', 'destroying', 'ability', 'daydream', 'perfect', 'future', 'husband', 'perfect', 'future', 'marriage', 'perfect', 'future', 'wedding', 'ceremony']",The Big Wedding Digital

1485112,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B005LAIIB2,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[2, 8]","Conventional wisdom has it that, now the planet has personal publishing capability, a networked universe in which to publish and a convenient means of sorting the rare grains of wheat from the deluge of chaff, there is no longer any chance Hollywood's resources will be committed to any script not thoroughly deserving of them.On this view, the idea that titans of screen like Robert de Niro, Susan Sarandon, Robin Williams or Diane Keaton could have the bandwidth, let alone the inclination, to toy with anything but the most brilliant screenplay is baffling: with their agents deluged with scripts before which Bacon, Beckett or even the Bard himself would tremble in wonder, the only dilemma which such gem to pick up.This theory seems, a priori, correct, transcendentally true and unanswerable. How could it be not so? The Homo Economici who populate the finance departments of studios like Lionsgate would insist upon it. They would require Excel projections to prove it. Granted, a Beckett might be overlooked in favour of a Danny Boyle, the driving imperative being commercial and not artistic, but nonetheless the raw material would assuredly be infinitely tuned and finely sharpened to give the punters precisely what they want.Now to be sure, even with these precautions box office success is never entirely assured, but in this day and age it will at least have as much statistical probability as financial projections and a properly configured business model can deliver. Failure scenarios are restricted to ""black swans"": at any rate, things less soluble than basic defects in the raw material of the motion picture itself.However self-evident that truth seems, recent Hollywood fare such as Justin Zackham's forthcoming romantic comedy The Big Wedding, seems heartily to falsify it. Some of the greatest craters ever augured into Southern Californian soil are papered with the charred pages of dismal scripts. Zackham's new movie might be about to make another one.The Big Wedding manages little in the way of sense or logic, let alone romance or comedy, and is burdened by a screenplay so poor and misshapen as to beggar belief. The film is not without its virtues: it is nicely lit, coloured and framed. The magnificent cast is heroic in its effort to work this scant material into something face-saving. Susan Sarandon and Katherine Heigl work overtime to imbue their characters with dimension wholly unadverted to by the script. Robert De Niro skilfully converts a couple of tricky dead-ball opportunities that a lesser actor would have skied into the stands. But outside these small redemptions, there is much stony ground.Any screenwriter possessed of a cast as strong as this who still plumps for gross-out gags and pratfalls for laughs deserves to have his practising certificate taken away. Justin Zackham derives comedy from Katherine Heigl throwing up and fainting, Robert de Niro being repeatedly punched, a dinner party being rained on, and a wedding party falling into a lake.This is not all. Zackham cavalierly stakes everything, five minutes in, on aGigligambit. Now you may not know what one of those is. If you don't, you should feel blessed, and I would not presume to burden you. (If you're not sure, the keyword is ""gobble"". Trust me, if you do, you'll know instantly what I mean).But Gigli's moment, ghastly though it was, took place between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck; at the time, these were two beautiful people in their prime. Zackham's involves Robert De Niro and Susan Sarandon, neither of whom should be offended to be considered long past theirs, with Diane Keating watching. Generally, one is meant to be quiet at the cinema but, even bearing that in mind, a profound sense of speechlessness descended on the theatre as the scene played out. This alone would be enough to bury most pictures singlehandedly. Zackham, however, leaves nothing to chance.Thereafter the plot doesn't so much as lose its way as demonstrate total disorientation from the outset. Try this for size, and this is just the premise: Freelance sculptor Don (De Niro) and estranged wife Ellie (Keaton)'s adopted Colombian orphan son Alejandro (Ben Barnes), now a Harvard alum, is marrying their social-climbing neighbours' daughter (Amanda Seyfried) at the beautiful Connecticut house which De Niro randily cohabits with long-time girlfriend Bebe (Sarandon). Orphan son's non-English-speaking mother Madonna (Patricia Ray), a Catholic of such devotion that she cannot abide the idea of divorce even in a father-in-law, is flying in from her South American convent with her fruity daughter Nuria (Ana Ayora), who oscillates between saintly forbearance and outright nymphomania, based purely on the unsolicited advice of Ellie (her step-brother's mother-in-law to be).De Niro and Keaton's other adult children are Heigl, a childless lawyer having marital troubles, and Jared (Topher Grace), a handsome but chaste registrar who, to the frustration of every nurse on the ward, is saving himself (but is not, despite all appearances to the contrary, ""otherwise inclined""). Robin Williams is the family priest who may or may not be hardline on pre-marital fornication (it changes scene to scene) notithstanding being, like De Niro, a recovering alcoholic.This is just your starter for ten: All these dramatic potentialities are played out over the eighty-five minute running time of this comedy. It might have been possible for a Beckett, or a Boyle, or a Richard Curtis, to have constructed a screenplay that could develop and resolve all these interlocking possibilities satisfactorily in an hour and a half, but it's a task that seems well beyond Justin Zackham.Olly Buxton",1,One awful Gigli moment.

But his birth mother, a strict Catholic from Columbia, is attending the wedding, so Alejandro begs his parents, who are divorced for ten years, to play a happy couple couple since it the biggest sin to get divorced. But where does that leave his stepmother Bebe (Susan Sarandon)? But that's not the only issue: as the wedding is getting closer somehow everyone seems to have the urge to reveal someone else's secret.Review:First of all I am glad they made a R rated movie because I am getting tired of all these comedies that have to hold back in cursing or sexuality because they try to make more money by making a PG movie. There are a lot of brilliant actors in this movie and no one is trying to outplay each other, they work together, and work together well. Most of the jokes are on point and even Katherine Heigl has a few funny moments, which is good for her. After all, her performances have been a little stiff and dry ever since 27 dresses. However, the whole storyline of the movie is silly. Why would someone care how their birth mother feel about their adoptive parents being divorced? I mean obviously something in her life went wrong, too, for having to give up a baby, right? So who is she to judge? And why would you put your stepmother through all this after she raised you for ten years? But with that said, I still think it is a fun and refreshing movie that goes by fast.To see more reviews please VISIT my blog [...] LIKE my Facebook page [...] and FOLLOW me on Twitter:  @SimonSays_Watch",3,No One's Secret is Safe,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1724,"['might', 'like', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Family', 'Stone', '2005', 'License', 'Wed', '2007', 'Long', 'Story', 'Short', 'Alejandro', 'Ben', 'Barnes', 'Missy', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'are', 'getting', 'married', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'perfect', 'birth', 'mother', 'strict', 'Catholic', 'Columbia', 'attending', 'wedding', 'so', 'Alejandro', 'begs', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'divorced', 'ten', 'years', 'play', 'happy', 'couple', 'couple', 'biggest', 'sin', 'get', 'divorced', 'where', 'leave', 'stepmother', 'Bebe', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'not', 'only', 'issue', 'wedding', 'getting', 'closer', 'somehow', 'everyone', 'have', 'urge', 'reveal', 'someone', 'else', 'secret.Review', 'First', 'am', 'glad', 'made', 'R', 'rated', 'movie', 'am', 'getting', 'tired', 'comedies', 'have', 'hold', 'back', 'cursing', 'sexuality', 'try', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'making', 'PG', 'movie', 'are', 'lot', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'movie', 'one', 'trying', 'outplay', 'other', 'work', 'together', 'work', 'together', 'well', 'Most', 'jokes', 'are', 'point', 'even', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'good', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'stiff', 'dry', 'ever', '27', 'dresses', 'However', 'whole', 'storyline', 'movie', 'silly', 'Why', 'would', 'someone', 'care', 'how', 'birth', 'mother', 'feel', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'being', 'divorced', 'mean', 'obviously', 'something', 'life', 'went', 'wrong', 'too', 'having', 'give', 'up', 'baby', 'right', 'So', 'who', 'judge', 'why', 'would', 'put', 'stepmother', 'raised', 'ten', 'years', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'fun', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'fast.To', 'see', 'more', 'reviews', 'please', 'VISIT', 'blog', '[', ']', 'Facebook', 'page', '[', ']', 'FOLLOW', 'Twitter', '@', 'SimonSays_Watch']",The Big Wedding Digital

Alejandro is getting married to Missy (Amanda Seyfried) whose parents (David Rasche/Christine Ebersole) are embarrassingly white. Don is divorced and married his mistress Bebe (Susan Sarandon). After a decade his wife and ex-wife get along very well. Robin Williams plays the priest that will preside over the ceremony. There are also two siblings. Dr. Jared (Topher Grace) is a 29 year old virgin. Lyla (Katherine Heigl) just left her husband. Just about everyone in the group has a dirty little secret that comes into play, but for the most part doesn't mesh well.If this wasn't enough, Alejandro's biological mother (Patricia Rae) is coming up from Colombia for the wedding. She is very Catholic and considers divorce a sin. She doesn't know Don and Ellie are divorced so they will pretend they aren't (yawn). She shows up with a daughter (Ana Ayora) who has designs for Jared.The film has great stars and a great indie style plot and characters. The secrets make for a great story. However it didn't come together. The dialouge failed to create on screen chemistry. Too much of the film seemed fake, the characters never hooked you.

1485170,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B005LAIIB2,The People's Critic,"[4, 7]","With the highly anticipated release of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, I decided to re-read the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic novel about moral decay in American Society.  Reading the book again was meant to assist me in my review for the upcoming Gatsby, but it turns out there's another story of tragic spoiled Americans consumed with their own lavish excesses already in theaters, and it's called The Big Wedding.The Big Wedding is a star-studded turkey of a movie that can be enjoyed as more of an oddity than anything else.  On the surface, it appears to be a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy about the goofy pitfalls that occur within the chain of events leading up to a big American family wedding.  However, Justin Zackham both writes and directs a film that if anything, actively attempts to rationalize dishonesty as an honorable and necessary trait within the family dynamic.The story revolves around the Griffin family as they prepare for the wedding  between adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes) and his fianc&eacute; Missy (Amanda Seyfried).  The Griffin patriarch is Don (Robert DeNiro) who is hosting the wedding at his home that he shares with his girlfriend, Bebe (Susan Sarandon).  DeNiro continues his series of baffling role choices here, and it's hard to envision what drew him to the character of Don, although he probably hasn't played a character who takes this many blows to the head since Raging Bull.  The wedding draws an ensemble cast together that includes Don's ex-wife Ellie (Diane Keaton) and Don and Ellie's two children Lyla (Katherine Heigl) and Jared (Topher Grace) both of which vary in degrees of estrangement from Don.  The conflict hinges on the news that Alejandro's biological mother Madonna will also be attending the wedding, and her ultra-conservative views on marriage and divorce cause Alejandro to plead with Don and Ellie to pretend to be married so not to offend her.  Various other subplots regarding Lyla's marriage troubles, Don's relationship with Bebe, and Jared's awkward fling with Madonna's beautiful daughter Nuria fill out the film's 89 minute running time, but none of them are remarkably interesting or funny.  Additionally, Robin Williams is given absolutely nothing to do as Father Moinighan in a screenplay that feels like a series of wasted opportunities.While The Big Wedding certainly disappoints given its potential, it is oddly watchable.  Most of the characters are quite unlikable, and it begs the viewer to question whether this is intentional.  Katherine Heigel's character is uniquely deplorable, an example being when she candidly announces who she needs to ""lynch"" to get a Cosmo.  Zackham makes it quite clear that every character has, in one way or another, used deception, fraud, or trickery as a recourse for trying to keep a family together.  This thematic exploration and justification for dishonesty feels wildly out of place in a supposedly fun wedding comedy, but it is a strangely fascinating direction to take.

With four Oscar-winners and a handful of young talented actors, you cannot make a bad movie. Well, actually, you can.Perhaps the whole premise is too weak and contrived for us to really care. Because their adapted son Alejandro&#8217;s biological mother comes from Columbia to attend his wedding, a long-divorced couple Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) pretends that they are still married. But what if they fail? Alejandro (Ben Barnes) will marry his girlfriend Missy (Amanda Seyfried) anyway, so why should we care?Womanizer Don has a new girlfriend Bebe (Susan Surandon), who happens to be, not surprisingly, Ellie&#8217;s best friend, but Bebe is upset to know that she has to spend a few days at hotel. In the meanwhile we meet Don and Ellie&#8217;s children Jared (Topher Grace) and Lyla (Katherine Heigl), and the latter seems unhappy these days because of her recent relationship problems. Robin Williams virtually reprises the role in &#8220;License to Wed.&#8221; None of the character arc is interesting.&#8220;The Big Wedding&#8221; is the kind of film where you feel there is something wrong with the movie but cannot pinpoint it exactly. The film is full of jokes, largely about sex. Some of them are mildly amusing, but even the better part of them is delivered awkwardly. I sort of liked the dry humor found in the dialogue, even though it lacks bite. &#8220;The Big Wedding&#8221; doesn&#8217;t know what it wants to be, a feel-good comedy or satire or something else.The fact that the film was actually a remake of 2006 French/Swiss film &#8220;Mon fr&egrave;re se marie&#8221; may have something to do with the result.
