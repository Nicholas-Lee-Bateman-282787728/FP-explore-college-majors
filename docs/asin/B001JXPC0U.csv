1207134,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B001JXPC0U,barry,"[6, 6]","I was always aware of Gordon Ramsay but never watched any of his shows till recently.  I have become hooked on the US version of KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.  So hooked that I just had to purchase both of the British series that are available.  I am so glad I did and cannot praise it enough.  Here I am reviewing the complete series one of RAMSAY'S KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.  What Ramsay does here is exactly the same as he does in the US version.  Restaurants in trouble have contacted him seeking his expertise and help.  He goes to them, investigates in depth what problems exist and helps them to see the problems and implement changes that will hopefully stick.Here is some news.  If you enjoy the US version the British version is better in every way.  With British television very little is censored and you see and hear everything and it is much more real.  You also see how the producers sensationalize the US version which is of course how US television is done.  But it is not necessary.  By being uncensored you get to see more of the real Gordon Ramsay.  He is very tough and very honest while at the same time being very compassionate.  The restaurants and their problems speak for themselves.  No sensationalizing is necessary.  Just make sure you notice how many bleeps there are in the US version for the language is totally unedited here and there is much f----, etc.  So be prepared.  But what you get is a world class chef showing us the problems that exist in many restaurants.  He does an amazing job at this as well as discovering the true positive entity that exists within each restaurant.Some say each episode is the same.  This is in no way true.  The premise of the show is that he goes to restaurants and does what he does but each restaurant is a different unique experience.  I find the British version to be so much better than how reality shows are done in the US.  If you love Gordon Ramsay and his honesty and skill this series is a highly recommended must. Not just for the fun of watching him but also for an education on restaurants, food and what to watch out for when you think you are just going out for a nice dinner.",5,Ramsay Rules,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2145,"['was', 'always', 'aware', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'never', 'watched', 'shows', 'till', 'recently', 'have', 'become', 'hooked', 'US', 'version', 'KITCHEN', 'NIGHTMARES', 'So', 'hooked', 'just', 'had', 'purchase', 'British', 'series', 'are', 'available', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'enough', 'Here', 'am', 'reviewing', 'complete', 'series', 'one', 'RAMSAY', 'KITCHEN', 'NIGHTMARES', 'What', 'Ramsay', 'here', 'exactly', 'same', 'US', 'version', 'Restaurants', 'trouble', 'have', 'contacted', 'seeking', 'expertise', 'help', 'depth', 'what', 'problems', 'exist', 'see', 'problems', 'implement', 'changes', 'will', 'hopefully', 'stick.Here', 'news', 'enjoy', 'US', 'version', 'British', 'version', 'better', 'way', 'British', 'television', 'very', 'little', 'censored', 'see', 'hear', 'everything', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'producers', 'sensationalize', 'US', 'version', 'course', 'how', 'US', 'television', 'done', 'not', 'necessary', 'being', 'uncensored', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'real', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'very', 'tough', 'very', 'honest', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'very', 'compassionate', 'restaurants', 'problems', 'speak', 'sensationalizing', 'necessary', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'notice', 'how', 'many', 'bleeps', 'are', 'US', 'version', 'language', 'totally', 'unedited', 'here', 'there', 'much', 'f', 'etc', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'what', 'get', 'world', 'class', 'chef', 'showing', 'problems', 'exist', 'many', 'restaurants', 'amazing', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'discovering', 'true', 'positive', 'entity', 'restaurant.Some', 'say', 'episode', 'same', 'way', 'true', 'premise', 'show', 'restaurants', 'what', 'restaurant', 'different', 'unique', 'experience', 'find', 'British', 'version', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'how', 'reality', 'shows', 'are', 'done', 'US', 'love', 'Gordon', 'Ramsay', 'honesty', 'skill', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended', 'must', 'Not', 'just', 'fun', 'watching', 'also', 'education', 'restaurants', 'food', 'what', 'watch', 'out', 'when', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'out', 'nice', 'dinner']",Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares: Complete UK Series 1

1207148,A35GEU8LZB8LJP,B001JXPC0U,Three if by Space,"[0, 6]","People who are in any part of the restaurant business can't miss Ramsay's critiques. His videos can save a business years of time, wasted effort and money. I cannot think of another TV series or cookbook that can claim the same. So. That's five stars.But if you are a home cook, beware! There are lessons here you do not want to adopt. Ramsay is concerned with making businesses profitable. Not with making the best home meals. At home, people are not concerned with serving 30 tables quickly and economically. When you cook for a family, you look for a just a few servings of meat, fish and veggies that your family likes. It doesn't matter that you're buying the last available in the bin for the season, or that it will only keep fresh for another day, because they'll welcome another serving of what they like.Ramsay is obsessed with freshness partly because it's a substitute for time-consuming, difficult processes ill-suited for a commercial restaurants' assembly line cooking.The idea that freshness is available in most ingredients, for most recipies is a mirage. And I say that, even living in California, near the coast. It's difficult to buy fresh fish, even though they live 30 miles away. Fresh vegetables are no problem -- as long as you're willing to put up with standard items, in season, non-organic, and not imported from Mexico.What Ramsay has done is show the drive and creativity necessary for good cooking. What you don't want to do is assume this make-a-buck-soaking-customers mentality is naturally what you want to cook for yourself, friends, and loved ones.P.S. I'll add here that I've given up Indian cooking almost entirely. The quality control was so awful with ingredients coming from India, I was scared. I bought a package of papadums that had so many animal hairs, they were lined up in neat rows. This is a country where millions of people can barely afford food to survive. You don't want to be buying ingredients from India. Period. Forget your fantasy about how exotic it tastes.
