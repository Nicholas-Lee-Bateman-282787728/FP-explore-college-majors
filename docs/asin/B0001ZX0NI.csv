To me the horse was the true star of this movie and they should have shown more about his recovery - a sort of parallel to the story of the man recovering.  This is a very good feel good story of great courage and the will to live.  I always thought the woman he married had been his physical therapist or something but apparently not. I never did figure out exactly how she came into the story so I guess I'll look at the movie again.  Hurt just looked terrible most of the time and he may have simply been too old for the part when cast.

I had a horrible time finding it on VHS, even on Amazon, and the only DVD versions were European.  But finally, it's out on DVD on this side of the pond and it's everything I remember.  Fine acting (John Hurt, Edward Woodward, a very young Kirstie Alley) and amazing horse riding and steeplechasing, ending with the most exciting race of all time, the English Grand National, 40 tall, wide, dangerous fences over a four mile course, at a full gallop, of course.  No horses may have been hurt in the creation of the film, but I'll bet you can't say that for the riders!The story is a little trite: jockey develops cancer that may kill him and prevents him from riding, his favorite horse comes up lame and may never race again, they both recover at the same time, and well, you know the rest.  What's amazing, aside from the racing, is that this is a true story (the horse even plays himself, with full screen credit).Highly recommended for anyone who likes English movies in general, horse racing in particular, and just a genuinely good, but often overlooked, film.",5,For Steeplechase (or just horse) Fans Everywhere,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1163,"['first', 'saw', 'Champions', 'theatrical', 'release', 'then', 'owned', 'Beta', 'yep', 'one', 'had', 'horrible', 'time', 'finding', 'VHS', 'even', 'Amazon', 'only', 'DVD', 'versions', 'were', 'European', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'side', 'pond', 'everything', 'remember', 'Fine', 'acting', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'very', 'young', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'amazing', 'horse', 'riding', 'steeplechasing', 'ending', 'most', 'exciting', 'race', 'time', 'English', 'Grand', 'National', '40', 'tall', 'wide', 'dangerous', 'fences', 'four', 'mile', 'course', 'full', 'gallop', 'course', 'horses', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hurt', 'creation', 'film', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'riders', 'story', 'little', 'trite', 'jockey', 'cancer', 'may', 'kill', 'prevents', 'riding', 'favorite', 'horse', 'up', 'lame', 'may', 'never', 'race', 'again', 'recover', 'same', 'time', 'well', 'know', 'rest', 'What', 'amazing', 'aside', 'racing', 'true', 'story', 'horse', 'even', 'full', 'screen', 'credit', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'English', 'movies', 'general', 'horse', 'racing', 'particular', 'just', 'genuinely', 'good', 'often', 'overlooked', 'film']",Champions VHS

But I'm so glad I did.John Hurt as Bob Champion is brilliant.  You feel his pain, bewilderment at the diagnosis and his determination to get back to the thing he loves the most .... being a jockey.  It's nice to see gentle Ben Johnson in another movie.  And the beautiful Kirstie Alley.  AND the amazing Edward Woodward.  Fans of British television will recognize many talented faces.Bob Champion's story serves as inspiration for anyone facing a difficult time, whether it be an illness, job loss or any one of life's challenges.  While convalescing at his sister's farm Bob rides his niece's pony.  He's so weak he falls off when the pony stops but oh, the joy on his face as he rode and taught that little pony to jump. There is joy in the journey to getting better.This is a wonderful film.  I'm so glad the DVD was released in North American format.A note for younger viewers:  The scenes of the Grand National race are heart stopping.  This is a very dangerous sport for rider and horse.  However for those watching with young children didn't fear gory scenes.  There's a little bit of nudity.  Kirstie Alley and John Hurt are seen cuddling up naked but it's not graphic and they are well covered by a blanket.  It's in this scene that Kirstie's character expresses concern about a swelling on her lover's testicle. In another scene Kirstie gives John a massage and you see a bit of his bottom from the side.
