1412492,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B004KV93AI,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[9, 10]","""Shaun The Sheep:  The Big Chase""(Hit Entertainment, 2010)-----------------------------------------------------A funny, fast-paced childrens' series for all ages to enjoy... Tangentially a spinoff from the Aardman studios ""Wallace And Gromit"" films, this claymation extravaganza has become a runaway hit on British TV, and is equally delightful for viewers worldwide, as there is no dialogue in any of the episodes, just a sharp, sublime sense of humor, matched by equally delightful animation. Shaun is the most down-to-earth (though occasionally mischievous) member of a wily flock of sheep living on a rundown rural farm.  The clueless, myopic farmer entrusts most of the herding duties to his dog, Bitzer, who wields a coach's whistle and not much else in his hapless attempts to keep the sheep in line.  Each episode is short but sweet, packed with brilliant bits of comedic timing and hilarious visual asides.  In this volume Shaun and his pals are plagued by an arrogant magpie, and go off on a crazy, Keystone Cops-style car chase across the English countryside... and Bitzer might have to go to obedience school!  If you're already a fan, this disc delivers... And if you haven't tried the Shaun series yet, you're in for a treat.  Pick a disc, any disc, and dig in.

Soon, we were all watching. Even my sister-in-law who is in her 70's enjoyed watching one with us. That is why I bought more and gave one season to her. She loves it just like we do. These are great for toddlers. My special-needs children enjoy these as does my teenager. It has become a family activity.
