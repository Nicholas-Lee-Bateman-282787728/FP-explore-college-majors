827204,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00028HBJI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 8]","Riding a voracious roller-coaster and watching Ian Softley's ""Backbeat"" could be considered one in the same.  From the excitement of the opening credits, to the lackluster conversations between infamous Beatle John Lennon and former-band member Stuart Sutcliffe in Liverpool, to the empowering nights of playing music in Hamburg, to the clich&eacute; drama over a girl named Astrid, to the emotional true formation of the Beatles, this film should have a subtext that it could, if viewed in one sitting, cause stomach butterflies or cramps.  With Softley's eye, the audience is strapped in tightly as ""Backbeat"" goes up and down, left and right, in and out of darkness, and in the end all you are left with is a perturbed expression captured on an invisible camera.  There is no argument that the Beatles have secured their names in worldly culture, and that there is plenty of information covering each living minute of these Brits, AND that the story of Stuart Sutcliffe is an interesting tale about a man who chose love and art versus screaming women and super-stardom, but this critic still winced a couple of times during this 100+ minute semi-biopic.  Like the music of the Beatles, Softley has amazing scenes filled with emotion and pizzazz, but where he slips is his focus on our central character, Stuart Sutcliffe.  One must ask the question, is this film about the choices of Sutcliffe, or is it just another chapter about the Beatles and their rise to popularity?With equal screen time being shared between crucial friendship Lennon and Sutcliffe, the argument can be set that Softley struggles with who to allow the camera to capture, the charismatic Ian Hart (giving us a fresh face to Mr. Lennon), or the subdue and forced accent of Stephen Dorff playing Sutcliffe.  For this critic, an entire film based off Hart's performance, or seen through Hart's Lennon's eyes would have been sheer icing on Softley's cake, but since we were forced to stifle through Dorff's performance - we are stuck with him, and where this film ultimately suffered.  What makes this roller-coaster worth perhaps riding a second time is Softley's ability to cast stronger secondary characters that seem more viewable than our front and center players.  Gary Bakewell's McCartney is perfection, while O'Neill, Williams, and whoever played Astrid's original lover were complete eye-candy.  Each actor grew their characters further than the page, and used this film as a showcase for their talent.  ""Backbeat"" is worth the rental for the sheer background characters alone, and for Hart's John Lennon, but our central characters, Sutcliffe and Astrid, seemed clich&eacute;-ly perfect, too instantaneous in love, and at times purely fake.  What forces me to say this are the scenes that the two (Dorff and Lee) share together.  While the art they create is full of passion, the chemistry that they share is not.  The 60s were a different time, a time where I was nowhere in existence, but this film was made in 1994 - giving off an impression that certain liberties were taken to tell their story.  Softley is too generous with these two - giving us no reality to base them in.  While the 60s were carefree in nature, where does Astrid stumble upon the castle in which she lives?  Money seems of no concern, and it is confusing (with no pre-story) how easily Sutcliffe can give up his best friend's band and the random disasters that can be caused at German limbo parties.  If this were a true story of simply Sutcliffe, than we would have followed his eyes, intermixed with the Beatles as a cameo, and really seen his artwork.  It isn't until the final act of this film that his artwork gets any recognition, which again makes it difficult to understand Sutcliffe's tangent rational.Enough with the negative; what was engrossing about this film?  ""Backbeat"", while playing to typical biopic clich&eacute;s, still maintained a level of entertainment.  The songs would walk in and catch your toes tapping along.  Softley used American songs to give the Beatles that sense of ""cool"" as well as to demonstrate how well they performed on stage.  Their energy, both the actual Beatles, as well as Ian Hart and his group had enough energy for anyone watching this film.  They were charismatic, exciting, and destined to be stars.  This was obvious from the beginning, the Beatles did it all themselves by performing eight days a week, with little to no food or sleep.  They captured the essence of ""grunge"".  For me, that was enough to continue with this film from beginning to end.  Sutcliffe's artwork, because it was so thinly used in the film, was exciting to see as well.  The same can be said for Astrid's photography.  The Beatles' art (both music and printed) was brilliant, these characters were brilliant in their lives, but I just felt like Softley dumb-ed them down for audiences.  The final act was pure rubbish, again with the opportunity to see Sutcliffe do his work - yet limbo miserably, that it nearly sours the remaining moments of this film.  Outside of the story, flawed as it was, Softley and his cinematographer should be fully credited for the roller-coaster sensation felt throughout the film.  There were breath-taking scenes throughout the movie, but they were typically anchored by choppy editing.  There would be this great scene of Astrid looking at the band that would steal your breath, and then we would jump to the band - in what felt like a different filming ratio, and then back to Astrid.  It felt like the audience was saying, ""Ohhh ... urgggg .... Ohhhh"".Overall, ""Backbeat"" was an entertaining film, in fact, it stands above the mediocre level of entertainment to say that I could view this movie a second time - but it would be with much argument and comments through the peanut gallery throughout.  The music stands out, Softley defines the time perfectly (almost as if anyone who could carry a tune could swoon those German women), but he cannot define his characters.  This is a biopic, in the short sense of the word, about Stuart Sutcliffe, yet the audience watches nearly equal screen time between he and John Lennon.  While I agree Lennon's influence on Sutcliffe and their friendship is worth the film reel it is printed on, I do not believe it fully grasps the art and lifestyle that Sutcliffe embodied.  With a hodgepodge of beautiful scenes, why couldn't Softley use that tricky camera work to define Sutcliffe's art - to make his art the second main character?  Ian Hart gave a phenomenal, hands-down, performance as Lennon, and a whole film could have been made about him - but Softley's film cannot support both - so they both suffer.  Upon finishing this film, one cannot truly say they knew Sutcliffe at all - outside of the catastrophic ending and the tacky final words as they play in the ocean.  ""Backbeat"" was an entertaining two hours, but not worth a second repeat.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Can we not agree - Oasis is a better band than the Beatles?!?,1207353600,"04 5,

827207,A16BJ43Z46QS3N,B00028HBJI,C. L Wilson,"[1, 6]","Pretty good movie of the Beatles' early years - particularly of their beginnings in Hamburg, Germany.  None of their original music, however; producers probably couldn't pay for that.  The story is really about a fifth member, Stuart Sutcliffe, a gifted artist who died at 21 in Hamburg with his wife, a German photographer, who gave the remaining Beatles their mop-top look. Sutcliffe, or the actor who plays him, Stephen Dorff, an American, kind've resembles James Dean, but without his intensity.  One reviewer states that he was Britain's most promising young artist before he died of a brain hemorrhage, probably brought on by a fight back in Liverpool because of something John Lennon said.  The movie doesn't say whether Lennon knew this or not.  It also seems to imply that Lennon was bi-sexual.  He certainly felt strongly about Stu; but it also implies that he could have loved Stu's wife.  I could never really get into this movie; maybe because I was never that crazy about the Beatles' music.  And only the actor who played Paul McCartney in any way resembled the Beatle he was playing.

The main upgrades are Dolby 5.1 audio and an audio interview with Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer who took the Beatles' first publicity shots. The anamorphic widescreen images (1.85:1) seem about the same as on the 2003 disc, good but sometimes grainy. Other extras, duped from the old DVD, include a director's commentary, a pair of deleted scenes and various interviews that tend to repeat material. Packaging is a lot classier than on the old DVD.""Backbeat"" takes the time to let its bogus Beatles perform entire numbers, mostly soul covers. The real music came from a ""grunge"" supergroup put together for the film by producer Don Was. The new 5.1 audio sounds sensational, with a vibrant and musical surround stage.Director Iain Softley (""K-PAX"") tells how he spent six years researching and writing the project, inspired by stylish photos he saw of Kirchherr and her lover Stu Sutcliffe, the Beatles' first bass player. The ""Backbeat"" script was based on her recollections; it focuses on the couple and jealous guy John Lennon.This might not be a Beatles film, but there's an undeniable thrill when, late in the story, the Paul McCartney character switches to his trademark German bass and the fabled front three wails on ""Please Mr. Postman.""

827214,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00028HBJI,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[2, 3]","This is a movie I enjoyed a lot when it first came out. I'm not a hardcore fan of The Beatles, more of a casual fan, and tend to like John Lennon's post-Beatle work more than The Beatles. ""Backbeat"" is the back story of The Beatles before they made it big. A pre-history of The Beatles. ""Backbeat"" starts where last year's ""Nowhere Boy"" leaves off. The years The Beatles went to Hamburg, Germany playing dank clubs in cellars and learned how to play rock `n' roll.Liverpool art students and best friends John Lennon (Ian Hart) and Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff) take the proto-Beatles Paul McCartney (Gary Bakewell), George Harrison (Chris O'Neill), and Pete Best (Scot Williams) to Hamburg. In Germany The Beatles resembled more of a punk band than The Beatles that later became famous. They dress in leathers, they're introduced to speed, and their playing is more ragged and raucous. One of the points of contention between McCartney and Lennon is Sutcliffe's lack of ability in playing the bass guitar, but since Sutcliffe is Lennon's best mate Sutcliffe stays in the band. Soon after arriving, Sutcliffe meets Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl Lee), and several love triangles develop between the characters. The triangle that receives the main focus of ""Backbeat"" is between Lennon, Sutcliffe, and Kirchherr, then the close relationship between Lennon and Sutcliffe, and the more subtle love triangle of Lennon, The Beatles and the pull of fame and recognition Lennon craved. All pull with equal gravity on Lennon and Sutcliffe.Hart as John Lennon disappears into the role he makes a believable Lennon without it falling into impersonation or parody. While not many people were familiar with Sutcliffe before ""Backbeat"" in the special features section of the DVD are pictures of Sutcliffe and Dorff looks remarkably like Sutcliffe. Dorff was about the same age as Sutcliffe when he made this movie, and due to the enormous input of Astrid Kirchherr to the movie it would be safe to assume Dorff has the same handle on Sutcliffe as Hart has on Lennon. Sheryl Lee also plays Kirchherr very subtly. She seems shy but her influence on Sutcliffe's life visibly grows during the course of the film, and the conclusion seems preordained to us. As the movie ends we fill in the blanks. It's the point where the historic Beatles begin and almost everyone knows (or thinks they know) the history of The Beatles.A lot of attention seems to have been paid to the details of both the era and the relationships of the person's involved. As we discover in the special features director Iain Softley developed the screenplay with a lot of input from Astrid Kirchherr. Softley admits that some things have been changed for dramatic purposes but nothing that changes the overall story or the characters.The special features include an interview with Astrid Kirchherr, that her relationship with Sutcliffe, and includes photographs of Sutcliffe and his paintings. There are two interviews with director Iain Softley the first at Sundance which tells a lot about how he developed ""Backbeat"" with the input of Kirchherr. The second interview with Softley and Hart is a little redundant in places because Softley reiterates how he came to make ""Backbeat."" The commentary is rather minimalist in approach and you can easily watch the movie around it.As I mentioned ""Backbeat"" carries on where ""Nowhere Boy"" left off. Although these two movies weren't conceived as such and were made 16 years apart, they make nice companion pieces and fit nicely together in the Lennon/Beatles story.",5,The Pre-Historic Beatles,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,3559,"['movie', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'Beatles', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'tend', 'like', 'John', 'Lennon', 'post-Beatle', 'work', 'more', 'Beatles', 'Backbeat', 'back', 'story', 'Beatles', 'made', 'big', 'pre-history', 'Beatles', 'Backbeat', 'where', 'last', 'year', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'off', 'years', 'Beatles', 'went', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'playing', 'dank', 'clubs', 'cellars', 'learned', 'how', 'play', 'rock', 'n', 'roll.Liverpool', 'art', 'students', 'best', 'friends', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'Stuart', 'Sutcliffe', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'take', 'proto-Beatles', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Gary', 'Bakewell', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Chris', ""O'Neill"", 'Pete', 'Best', 'Scot', 'Williams', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'Beatles', 'resembled', 'more', 'punk', 'band', 'Beatles', 'later', 'became', 'famous', 'dress', 'leathers', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'speed', 'playing', 'more', 'ragged', 'raucous', 'One', 'points', 'contention', 'McCartney', 'Lennon', 'Sutcliffe', 'lack', 'ability', 'playing', 'bass', 'guitar', 'Sutcliffe', 'Lennon', 'best', 'mate', 'Sutcliffe', 'band', 'Soon', 'arriving', 'Sutcliffe', 'Astrid', 'Kirchherr', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'several', 'love', 'triangles', 'develop', 'characters', 'triangle', 'main', 'focus', 'Backbeat', 'Lennon', 'Sutcliffe', 'Kirchherr', 'then', 'close', 'relationship', 'Lennon', 'Sutcliffe', 'more', 'subtle', 'love', 'triangle', 'Lennon', 'Beatles', 'pull', 'fame', 'recognition', 'Lennon', 'craved', 'pull', 'equal', 'gravity', 'Lennon', 'Sutcliffe.Hart', 'John', 'Lennon', 'role', 'believable', 'Lennon', 'falling', 'impersonation', 'parody', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'familiar', 'Sutcliffe', 'Backbeat', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'DVD', 'are', 'pictures', 'Sutcliffe', 'Dorff', 'remarkably', 'like', 'Sutcliffe', 'Dorff', 'was', 'same', 'age', 'Sutcliffe', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'due', 'enormous', 'input', 'Astrid', 'Kirchherr', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'safe', 'assume', 'Dorff', 'same', 'handle', 'Sutcliffe', 'Hart', 'Lennon', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'also', 'Kirchherr', 'very', 'subtly', 'shy', 'influence', 'Sutcliffe', 'life', 'visibly', 'course', 'film', 'conclusion', 'preordained', 'movie', 'fill', 'blanks', 'point', 'where', 'historic', 'Beatles', 'begin', 'almost', 'everyone', 'know', 'history', 'Beatles.A', 'lot', 'attention', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'details', 'era', 'relationships', 'person', 'involved', 'discover', 'special', 'features', 'director', 'Iain', 'Softley', 'developed', 'screenplay', 'lot', 'input', 'Astrid', 'Kirchherr', 'Softley', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'nothing', 'overall', 'story', 'characters.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'interview', 'Astrid', 'Kirchherr', 'relationship', 'Sutcliffe', 'photographs', 'Sutcliffe', 'paintings', 'are', 'two', 'interviews', 'director', 'Iain', 'Softley', 'first', 'Sundance', 'lot', 'how', 'developed', 'Backbeat', 'input', 'Kirchherr', 'second', 'interview', 'Softley', 'Hart', 'little', 'redundant', 'places', 'Softley', 'how', 'came', 'make', 'Backbeat', 'commentary', 'rather', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'can', 'easily', 'watch', 'movie', 'it.As', 'mentioned', 'Backbeat', 'where', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'left', 'off', 'two', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'conceived', 'such', 'were', 'made', '16', 'years', 'apart', 'make', 'nice', 'companion', 'pieces', 'fit', 'nicely', 'together', 'Lennon/Beatles', 'story']",N/A

827220,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00028HBJI,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","This relatively obscure film scratched out a couple million dollars in 1994 and never received proper acclaim.  British director and co-writer Iain Softley researched the early days of the Beatles for years which led him to their first significant gig in Hamburg, Germany.  His research led him to German artist Astrid Kirchher who played a major role in the emergence of the famous band.  This is not a typical biopic of the early Beatles although they are all present.The story is about the 5th Beatle, Stuart Sutcliffe (a remarkable performance by Stephen Dorff, ""Immortals"") and his relationship with his best friend John Lennon (Ian Hart, ""Harry Potter"" films) and Kirchher (Sheryl Lee, ""Winter's Bone"").  Sutcliffe and Lennon were best friends and through John's urging, Stuart joins the band put together by Lennon and Paul McCartney (Gary Bakewell) that included George Harrison (Chris O'Neill) and Pete Best (Scot Williams).  Sutcliffe by his own admission wasn't a very good musician and a terrible singer.  His heart was in painting.  He wasn't interested in a musical career as Lennon was.While playing in a notorious strip club called the Kaiserkeller, The Beatles came to the attention of photographer Kirchher and her lover at the time, Klaus Voormann (Kai Wiesinger), a musician, artist and producer.  After Sutcliffe is invited into their circle, the rift between him and the rest of the band widens.  Sutcliffe eventually supplants Voormann as Astrid's lover and fianc&eacute;.  Hart's Lennon is an angry young man and as the story progresses it is clear that he is jealous of both Sutcliffe, for his catch of Kirchher who he clearly is also attracted, and of Kirchher who he sees as coming between him and his best friend. Alas, Sutcliffe's life ends abruptly in 1962 from a brain hemorrhage at the age of 21.Softley took a great risk in casting this wonderful picture.  It was shot in England and Germany with a British cast but for the 2 leads.  Unhappy with his options in Europe, Softley went to L. A. and was taken with the unknown 18 year old Dorff.  He then signed Cheryl Lee (6 years older) who was probably best known for being the dead girl on TV's ""Twin Peaks.""  Dorff adopts a perfect Liverpool accent and Lee does a remarkably authentic German.  Kirchher who acted as a consultant on the film commented that Dorff's cadence and mannerisms were scary good.There are several lengthy American rock `n roll covers that The Beatles perform during the film and I thought they sounded very good but clearly weren't Beatles voices.

As such, it captures their scruffy Liverpool/Hamburg milieu well (if anyone wanted to know), and Lennon's early wit and verve before he became a navel-gazing acidhead and later megalomaniac inventor of peace. Except for some interesting painting sex scenes, Sutcliffe and German girlfriend Astrid (the as usual charmless Sheryl Lee) make a dull center for the film, and even Hart can't quite make this seem like a worthwhile use of celluloid (the film glides over the fact that Lennon once kicked Sutcliffe in the head during a scuffle and so probably caused the eventual hemmorage that killed him, but that's Instant Karma for ya).",3,Where's The Story of Keith R.

Like anyone else (and like any Beatles fan), I am willing and even anxious to see and understand the exact moment preceding the outburst of an incredible journey, especially The Beatles one. Also, the topic is particularly interesting: Stuart Sutckiffe's life and personality and especially his (oh so early) death gave that ""tragic dimension"" to the Beatles story, dimension which had a certain contribution to the rising myth and added some poignant enigma to the whole picture--ingredients that emphasized the impact on their addicted audiences.Some of the achievements of this movie are its accuracy, faithfulness to reality and therefore good documentation. The atmosphere in the 1960-1962 Liverpool/Hamburg is well rendered, the screenplay is truthful, the sets and image are great (in some scenes, we recognize postures and mimic from the photographs taken by the German ""exies"" Astrid, J&uuml;rgen and Klaus--and I do not refer to the ""pose to be photographed"" scenes.) I particularly appreciated the Fab Four reconstruction: perfect, despite the physical non-resemblance (we forgive George's blue eyes, for instance). Their voices, posture and gestures on the stage are well-documented and strikingly well rendered. (One big exception: in real life, it's Paul who sings Long Tall Sally, not John!). The early Beatle sound is not reproduced but recreated to be better understood by us, not-so-contemporary audience. John's character is exceptionnaly well acted and seized, his violence, warmth, coldness, wit, cynicism, despair, raw force and strong will are consistent and intense. Well done!The less convincing parts of the movie are the main characters: Stu (whose personality is vague, diluted, fuzzy, the actor being all the time &agrave; la recherche du personnage) and Astrid who is a caricature--poorly acted, posing, precious and boring. The love scenes are too long, out of focus and thus utterly unnecessary. It's a pity. This movie could have been a masterpiece.I watch the movie now and then for the atmosphere, the Fab Four and the songs. I skip the Stu-Astrid scenes.

Lennon and McCartney were already writing music together but Lennon spent much of his time hanging with fellow artist Stu Sutcliffe. Lennon talked his pal into spending the money from the sale of a painting into buying a bass guitar and suddenly ""The Silver Beatles"" had a new bassist--albeit one that couldn't play any instrument but that soon changed.This terrific film chronicles the early days of the band in Hamburg before they broke it big and the strong friendship of Lennon and Sutcliffe. Ian Hart virtually steals the film from Stephen Dorf (who's also quite good)capturing Lennon's swagger and sarcastic wit in full stride. Directly Ian Softley focuses more on the duo of Lennon and Sutcliffe than the rest of the band chronicling their friendship. Sutcliffe never lived to see Lennon and the rest of the band achieve their dreams of going to the top and conquer the world. It's a fascinating glimpse into the past and it's clear that Softley did quite a bit of research to make this marvelous film. Hart had played Lennon once before in ""The House and Times"" a film that portrayed a supposed homosexual fling between Lennon and the band's manager Brian Epstein.Most of the performances capture the essence of the The Beatles even if they don't always look exactly like the people their playing. The duo Hart and Gary Bakewell at least resemble Lennon and McCartney. While Softley claims he was trying to capture the raw sound of the band in the beginning (which I'm sure he does), my only complaint is that the singers don't sound all that much like Lennon or McCartney. Still, the supporting musicians drawn from members of REM, Afgan Wigs, Nirvana and other groups do create quite a sound.The big difference between this and the bare bones release of a couple of years ago are all the extras: We get Ian Softley's ""Sundance Channel Interview""; an interview of Softley and Hart discussing the making of the film; an audio interview with Astrid Kirchherr (with old photos of her, Stu and others along with footage from the film to illustrate what she's saying); two deleted scenes; footage of ""the band"" of actors rehearshing; audition video shot for the movie; behind-the-scenes photos and an audio commentary from the director. Univeral has done an exceptional job in remastering the video and audio.It's a terrific package. I'm glad that this drama has finally made it to DVD in such a deluxe presentation.
