1071173,ABGAL4ZQ7ZG0Z,B000PGVGX4,Adelaidian,"[1, 2]","Only discovered this show earlier this year after seeing it on one of Australia's new digital HD channels but couldn't properly appreciate it due to the short 21 minute episodes being constantly interrupted by all the commercials. So, read some online reviews and took the plunge by purchasing season one on DVD. Easily lapped up all the episodes and a few weeks later bought season two which was just as good.There are elements of Roseanne, Family Ties and Malcolm In The Middle - a bit of working class realism, the teaching of some simple lessons in life, and it moves along at a fine pace. The whole cast is fantastic. Especially love the laid back style of the father character, Frankie's (the mother's) obnoxious boss, and great to see Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond play little Brick's teacher. Just loved the Spring Cleaning episode where their neighbour called the police because she wrongly presumed (because the house was so messy) their house was burglarized.In case you didn't know, many exterior shots are filmed on the Warner backlot which used to be the Columbia backlot. So, if you're a lover of retro TV and you look quickly enough during some of the outdoor scenes, you will notice exterior shots of homes that were used on old Screen Gems programs such as Bewitched, Partridge Family etc.",5,Can't wait for season 3 on DVD,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,1320,"['Only', 'discovered', 'show', 'earlier', 'year', 'seeing', 'one', 'Australia', 'new', 'digital', 'HD', 'channels', 'could', ""n't"", 'properly', 'appreciate', 'due', 'short', '21', 'minute', 'episodes', 'being', 'constantly', 'interrupted', 'commercials', 'So', 'read', 'online', 'reviews', 'took', 'plunge', 'purchasing', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'Easily', 'lapped', 'up', 'episodes', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'bought', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'just', 'good.There', 'are', 'elements', 'Roseanne', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'bit', 'working', 'class', 'realism', 'teaching', 'simple', 'lessons', 'life', 'along', 'fine', 'pace', 'whole', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'Especially', 'love', 'laid', 'back', 'style', 'father', 'character', 'Frankie', 'mother', 'obnoxious', 'boss', 'great', 'see', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'play', 'little', 'Brick', 'teacher', 'Just', 'loved', 'Spring', 'Cleaning', 'episode', 'where', 'neighbour', 'called', 'police', 'wrongly', 'presumed', 'house', 'was', 'so', 'messy', 'house', 'was', 'burglarized.In', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'exterior', 'shots', 'are', 'filmed', 'Warner', 'backlot', 'used', 'be', 'Columbia', 'backlot', 'So', ""'re"", 'lover', 'retro', 'TV', 'look', 'quickly', 'enough', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'will', 'notice', 'exterior', 'shots', 'homes', 'were', 'used', 'old', 'Screen', 'Gems', 'programs', 'such', 'Bewitched', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'etc']",N/A

This season the makers seemed to know this as scenes devoted to Frankie's job or her eccentric aunts shrunk to just about nothing.  The focus instead was on the interaction among the two parents and the three kids. The show really soared when this emphasis changed this season.My favorite is still the youngest kid Brick.  He is a real little oddball and we love him for that.  My favorite episode this season was when Brick was exiled to the playground and had to find a way back to the safety of the library. Part of his solution was to read various military strategies, such as the maneuvers of General George Patton, to achieve this.  This is just the most marvelous episode. I've kept it and will see it again frequently I'm sure.Patricia Heaton as Frankie is next.  She is a very talented comedienne. She is also the one who carries the whole show as she has the most lines and is in most scenes.  Perhaps her finest moment was when she decided to devote herself to the royal wedding experience.  She ordered souvenir gift items, got a new tv for the event and, in short, completely flipped out over commoner Kate marrying Prince William.I appreciated Axel more this season.  He was sort of the weak link before but now he has morphed into being the reality of living with a high school jock. One episode turned heavily on his smelly socks and Mike, the father's, reaching his limit with finding them everywhere. The two of them went into high conflict over the socks and even higher conflict over the son beating the father's athletic record at the same high school.  Mike, the father, is thus pretty good too but he is the straight man to these lunatics.The only character I have somewhat mixed feelings about is Sue. Her hopeless quests are funny but after awhile I do find her grating.

Well, The Middle isn't among them ;) But while critics have given the show a lukewarm reception, all of the actual TV viewers I know have been immediately charmed and delighted by this underrated gem of a show.The Middle doesn't go out of its way to flaunt just how edgy and risque it can be. It doesn't, like so many other critically lauded shows, feature wholly unlikable people doing wholly unlikable things while half-winking at the camera over just how zany they are. It doesn't go for over-the-top wackiness or the kind of constant lowbrow sexual innuendo and fart jokes that you might unplesantly associate with high school locker rooms.Instead, The Middle simply tells the story of a family that's likable and even admirable despite also being realistically, comically flawed. The humor stems from the strong characterizations, sharp dialogue and the clever insight peppered throughout. (You'll be thinking ""that is SO true...it's scary how well I can relate to that!"" at least a few times per episode). We get flashes of heartwarming poignancy here too, but rest assured that it's never too sappy or forced.This is one of those rare shows that successfully blends humor with heart, and I was pleasantly surprised to realize how much I've come to love spending time with this family. I used to have a weird visceral dislike for Patricia Heaton and, for reasons alluded to above, rarely like sitcoms...but this show immediately reversed my opinion of Patricia Heaton's acting abilities, and even gave me a renewed hope for the sitcom genre!One major reason it's worth owning on DVD: The vast majority of the episodes not only hold up with multiple viewings, but actually improve, as you notice subtle moments of awesomeness that you were too busy laughing to pick up on the first time around. So many shows *claim* to have struck that balance between wit and poignancy; to have created lovable yet hilariously flawed characters; to have written dialogue that's sharp and memorable. This is one of the few shows that, in my clearly Middle-loving opinion, has actually succeeded in all those areas and more. It's a show that provides mood-boosting humor with moments of sharp insight into what it means to be part of a family and a steady supply of heartwarming charm.

For though season 1 sold enough units to warrant a season 2 release, the cost of music clearances was so prohibitively high that Fox decided to scrap the project.Music was a big part of the show, and the songwriters and frequently music publishing companies have to be paid up front before any dvd release will be authorized and without the guarantee of how many will sell, studios frequently chalk such clearances up as a bad investment (as has been the case with Parker Lewis Can't Lose, too). In some cases they substitute cheaper tunes instead (see: WKRP in Cincinnati), but in the case of Malcolm, they probably figured the music was such a vital part of the show it couldn't be taken out.People frequently seem to think that just wanting a show to come out on DVD is all it takes.

1071190,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B000PGVGX4,David Seaman,"[1, 1]","Seaons Two of ""The Middle"" continues as did Season one. It is realistic, in a way that ""Roseanne"" attempoted but this is middle class- not lower middle class, there is love in the family and a LOT less sarcasm, but there are still dirty plates under the bed. Mostly, this is a show where human rights are important. What a relief to see a sit-come where the wife and husband aren't offensivbe sterotypes. Dad isn't made to look like a bumbling thoughtless idiot who doesn't do any work around the house. Mom isn't made to look like the brains behind the operation, coping with idiocy amnd manipulating to get her way; Mom isn't made to look like the brainless pretty girl who usurps to her husbands will (Grrrr Florence Hernderson) while culture forces her to live like a Carly Simon song. The kids do not make you want to puke as did the Brady kids and everyone but Danny Partridge to my generatioln. (Sherwood Schwartz should have been arrested for what he did to American Culture) and the kids, Axle, Sue and Brick, are all great kids, with faults, quirks and, as it happens, have become role models for a new generation of Americans who will not feel like Quasimoto because they aren't Maricia, Greg, Jam, Peter, Cindy and- God forbid - Bobby. (Picture Greg Brady on the couch in his Boxers watching a football game and snapping at Mike about how he'll get his homework done when he does.)The writing is brilliant- fresh and new and even when old issues we've seen come up on a plot, they're handled freshly. These are excellent parents. They work together. They respect each other. They love their children very much and neither of them sacrifices their core values in favor of the other.But they respect the other. It's time that American family sit-coms taught about respect. Lord knows the two party family values thing isn't even close to real.Yes, The Heck are a ""dream"" family and for all of the familys out there in America, coping with divorce, a parent in jail, drugs, alcohol, the fact that one out of five kids have been sexually abused, we are given The Hecks as a respit from the heroin, the guns, the condoms and prayers, the breath smelling, the dilated pupils and the crying kid from the broken heart. It leads us to the political garbage that has descended (ironically the last time political frogs fell from the sky we got ""All In The Family"" and ""Mary Tyler Moore""- Maybe there's something to this.)but this respit doesn't demand that we fit a Disney-fake mold. Our quirks are not only acceptable, but encouraged. we no longer have to compromise.I think of Axle Heck who gets dressed for school in literally two seconds while telling his mom to ""Chill"". It works for him. I think of Brick Heck, a genuis to be sure, standing without fear and looking up at his mother with a book in his hand asking, ""Which part of me is my throbbing manhood?"" I smile with love as Sue turns into a Beatles freak every time Reverand Tim-Tom makes a surprise visit (always just in the nick of time)Blackie And Blondie have done something important here and these are tevleviion shows that are well worth watching over and over. (Where is Doris, the dog in diapers, this season? Lord...could it be?)But the Aunts are still there, Mikes Dad and Frankie's Oscar winning parents are there. Bob- the lone video-game geek from work - is still there and THIS is an American Family with family values (""Look, the Tornado gave us a dryer"") as we re-define the nuclear family- or better yet, put it on display in the museum of natural history. Family values are a group of people shaering their livers with love and respect. Why should THAT be political unless it comes from hate....The Heck are here to stay and their contributions to our culture are just as wonderful as the way they make us laugh every week.I look forward to season ten. I forgive Patricia Hearn for the dammage she did to human rights in ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Neil Flynn has always been remarkable, whether he's a Janitor, demanding his place in the world or a bouncer in a club in The 70's Show; the man has always managed to make men individuals and not groups of hormone crazed idiots. This is a gifted actor.Yes. ""The Mimddle"" is a very political show because sit-coms about familes teach us what is right or wrong based on how they get us to accept them and get used to them. Blackie and Bk,ondie didn;t CHOOSE to be political. Neither did ""Bewitched."" How many of us STILL wish that Smanatha had turned Darin into a widowed 65 year old woman on Social Security? Vengence isn;t satisfactory without the lesson. I am sad to see that there are still aMericahn women who are willing to usurpo their will to a man. And let's face it: any man who wants this- who is not interrested in his partners opinions and help - is a loser.Particularlyu if that partner has magical powers.""The Middle"" even has an effeniment homosexual (this is only implied) whom they treat with great respect, despite the fact that he was caught - underage - smoking behind his garage on Chirstmas Day. I look forward to when he finally discovers why it is he feels as though he doesn;t fit in. I bet even Axle will treat him with his usual indifferent respect.Maybe that'll be part of season nine?I swear to you this is brilliant and respectful television.",5,How a sit-com becomes political.

1071207,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B000PGVGX4,Midge,"[4, 6]","These studios need to understand that the longer they wait, the LESS customers they have to buy their product. They don't gain by waiting... only lose more sales each day as the viewers are dying off from age, disease, accidents... etc. The quicker the DVD's are released, the more sales and profit the studios will gain. It is like the TV show Dallas... they just released the final 14th season 2 months ago... at least 60% of their fans died off before being able to buy the complete set.Utter stupidity of the studios to use such cowardly excuses for problems which are fairly easy to eliminate. I simply could not believe it when I saw they had not even released season 2 of Malcolm yet. It has been 8-10 years since I bought season 1. Videos are not like comic books. They do not increase in value. They lose purchasers. Profit goes down even if the price goes up... and usually, when the price does go up... only the resellers gain... not the original studio.Like one of the other reviewers stated... if it is an issue of ownership rights... the studios have the following options to get this show on the road:***Either pay the @*! Fees for the usage rights... which should be a lot cheaper since they are old songs now.***OR...Negotiate with the owners for some other mutual resolution such as a percentage or trade.***The music is a lot older now and out of demand... unlike the situation 10 years ago. The DVD would only increase music sales if they agreed to free airing & use on the episodes.***Offer the music studios additional free advertising on the DVDs in trade***Use advertising from other sources on the DVD's to obtain monies to pay music fees***remove the offending music and replace it with something else without fees. The studio can always record over anything on the DVD sets and recreate the sound or dialogue from a variety of methods.This is not that hard to do. I had to negotiate for issues like this for numerous videos. Most music owners (studios & artists, etc) are not that difficult to deal with, especially on older music. Most will waive the fees. Many will trade for publicity and free advertising. Only 2 were a problem and I simply replaced that music with free domain music with seamless ease. Surely a studio can find a way to work out this problem. We customers and fans can live with the audio changes needed to release the series as long as the studio is open with the fans as to what they are doing. Replacing the music on a video is so simple, a teenager could do it in their garage. Surely the studio can manage something as simple as replacing whatever music necessary to eliminate fees. Any voice dialogue damaged in the process can be repaired by using clips of their voices lifted from other episodes so the vocals will match the ages of the actors. There is also sound editing software to clean up audio and remove background sounds.There are thousands of DVD's of other movies & TV series on the market which were able to manage and overcome these problems. This is just sheer laziness by MIM. The owners of this series can easily contact other studios to get ideas and help on how to best handle these issues. They might even provide some suggestions on a negotiator to handle the problem for them. It is not rocket science. There are also different laws which protect older shows from things like this. Give Universal a call... or one of the others. What might have been an issue 10 years ago, is probably long since changed by others who fought those battles in the past and paved the way... not to mention the fact that the music used is a lot older now than it was 10 years ago... so it is no longer popular and the music studios would benefit by the airing of the music... so they will likely give it to you for free since it would probably increase the sales of those songs by hearing them on the DVD's. So, get off your rears and get this series onto DVD... and stop crying in your soup over an old issue which is no longer valid.Better hurry up and get the show onto the DVD's for sale! I would estimate that the death rates have taken at least 15% of the potential consumer profit for sales... if not more. The current death rates of people in their 50's and 60's is hitting all time record levels from all of those ""Safe"" products we consume and use. In another 5 years, at least 30% of the potential customers will be gone. The studio will not gain viewers like the old days of reruns... because there are too many channels to watch... not like the old days when there were only 3 channels forcing everyone to watch reruns. So sales will only continue to drop for every day there is a delay releasing this show.",4,Customers are dying off waiting... profit potential is falling!,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,4677,"['studios', 'need', 'understand', 'longer', 'wait', 'LESS', 'customers', 'have', 'buy', 'product', 'do', ""n't"", 'gain', 'waiting', 'only', 'lose', 'more', 'sales', 'day', 'viewers', 'are', 'dying', 'off', 'age', 'disease', 'accidents', 'etc', 'quicker', 'DVD', 'are', 'released', 'more', 'sales', 'profit', 'studios', 'will', 'gain', 'TV', 'show', 'Dallas', 'just', 'released', 'final', '14th', 'season', '2', 'months', 'ago', 'least', '60', '%', 'fans', 'died', 'off', 'being', 'able', 'buy', 'complete', 'set.Utter', 'stupidity', 'studios', 'use', 'such', 'cowardly', 'excuses', 'problems', 'are', 'fairly', 'easy', 'eliminate', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'when', 'saw', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'released', 'season', '2', 'Malcolm', 'yet', 'been', '8-10', 'years', 'bought', 'season', '1', 'Videos', 'are', 'not', 'comic', 'books', 'do', 'not', 'increase', 'value', 'lose', 'purchasers', 'Profit', 'down', 'even', 'price', 'usually', 'when', 'price', 'go', 'up', 'only', 'resellers', 'gain', 'not', 'original', 'studio.Like', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'issue', 'ownership', 'rights', 'studios', 'have', 'following', 'options', 'get', 'show', 'road', 'pay', '@', '*', 'Fees', 'usage', 'rights', 'should', 'be', 'lot', 'cheaper', 'are', 'old', 'songs', 'now', '***OR', 'Negotiate', 'owners', 'other', 'mutual', 'resolution', 'such', 'percentage', 'trade', '***The', 'music', 'lot', 'older', 'now', 'demand', 'situation', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'would', 'only', 'increase', 'music', 'sales', 'agreed', 'free', 'airing', 'use', 'episodes', '***Offer', 'music', 'additional', 'free', 'advertising', 'DVDs', 'trade***Use', 'advertising', 'other', 'sources', 'DVD', 'obtain', 'monies', 'pay', 'music', 'offending', 'music', 'replace', 'something', 'else', 'fees', 'studio', 'can', 'always', 'record', 'over', 'anything', 'DVD', 'sets', 'recreate', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'variety', 'methods.This', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'do', 'had', 'negotiate', 'issues', 'numerous', 'videos', 'Most', 'music', 'owners', 'studios', 'artists', 'etc', 'are', 'not', 'difficult', 'deal', 'especially', 'older', 'music', 'Most', 'will', 'waive', 'fees', 'Many', 'will', 'trade', 'publicity', 'free', 'advertising', 'Only', '2', 'were', 'problem', 'simply', 'replaced', 'music', 'free', 'domain', 'music', 'seamless', 'ease', 'Surely', 'studio', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'work', 'out', 'problem', 'customers', 'fans', 'can', 'live', 'audio', 'changes', 'needed', 'release', 'series', 'as', 'long', 'studio', 'open', 'fans', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Replacing', 'music', 'video', 'so', 'simple', 'teenager', 'could', 'do', 'garage', 'Surely', 'studio', 'can', 'manage', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'replacing', 'music', 'necessary', 'eliminate', 'fees', 'voice', 'dialogue', 'damaged', 'process', 'can', 'be', 'repaired', 'using', 'clips', 'voices', 'lifted', 'other', 'episodes', 'vocals', 'will', 'match', 'ages', 'actors', 'also', 'sound', 'editing', 'software', 'clean', 'up', 'audio', 'remove', 'background', 'are', 'thousands', 'DVD', 'other', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'market', 'were', 'able', 'manage', 'overcome', 'problems', 'just', 'sheer', 'laziness', 'MIM', 'owners', 'series', 'can', 'easily', 'contact', 'other', 'studios', 'get', 'ideas', 'help', 'how', 'best', 'handle', 'issues', 'might', 'even', 'provide', 'suggestions', 'negotiator', 'handle', 'problem', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'are', 'also', 'different', 'laws', 'protect', 'older', 'shows', 'things', 'Give', 'call', 'one', 'others', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'issue', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'probably', 'long', 'changed', 'others', 'who', 'fought', 'battles', 'past', 'paved', 'way', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'music', 'used', 'lot', 'older', 'now', 'was', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'no', 'longer', 'popular', 'music', 'studios', 'would', 'benefit', 'airing', 'music', 'so', 'will', 'likely', 'give', 'free', 'would', 'probably', 'increase', 'sales', 'songs', 'hearing', 'DVD', 'So', 'get', 'off', 'rears', 'get', 'series', 'DVD', 'stop', 'crying', 'soup', 'old', 'issue', 'longer', 'valid.Better', 'hurry', 'up', 'get', 'show', 'DVD', 'sale', 'would', 'estimate', 'death', 'rates', 'have', 'taken', 'least', '15', '%', 'potential', 'consumer', 'profit', 'sales', 'not', 'more', 'current', 'death', 'rates', 'people', '50', '60', 'hitting', 'time', 'record', 'levels', 'Safe', 'products', 'consume', 'use', '5', 'years', 'least', '30', '%', 'potential', 'customers', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'studio', 'will', 'not', 'gain', 'viewers', 'old', 'days', 'reruns', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'channels', 'watch', 'not', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'were', 'only', '3', 'channels', 'forcing', 'everyone', 'watch', 'reruns', 'sales', 'will', 'only', 'continue', 'drop', 'day', 'delay', 'releasing', 'show']",N/A
