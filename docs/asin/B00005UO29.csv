Tom Hanks and Sally Field have stand-up comedy in their blood. But there are obstacles to achieving the dream of doing comedy: for Hanks it's his father who wants him to be a doctor; for Fields it's a husband and family. Hanks wants Fields to run away with him, but Fields has it out with her husband, explains her needs, and he buys into it. A lot of the movie takes place in comedy clubs where Hanks can play his wacky role to the hilt, but Fields seems out of place and not very funny: when she wins the contest at the end and then refuses to accept the prize in order to join her husband - this is called eating your cake and having it, too - it's the biggest fraud of all. Just not a very believable movie.",3,Punchline - Fairly routine,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,805,"['pursuit', 'one', 'dream', 'matter', 'what', 'consequences', 'what', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Sally', 'Field', 'have', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'blood', 'are', 'obstacles', 'achieving', 'dream', 'doing', 'comedy', 'Hanks', 'father', 'who', 'be', 'doctor', 'Fields', 'husband', 'family', 'Hanks', 'Fields', 'run', 'away', 'Fields', 'out', 'husband', 'needs', 'lot', 'movie', 'place', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'where', 'Hanks', 'can', 'play', 'wacky', 'role', 'hilt', 'Fields', 'place', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'when', 'contest', 'end', 'then', 'accept', 'prize', 'order', 'join', 'husband', 'called', 'eating', 'cake', 'having', 'too', 'biggest', 'fraud', 'Just', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'movie']",N/A

Almost 20 years later, some of the scenes in here bring either a smile or a frown to my face. I guess that means this is a powerful story. It left some indelible impressions, at least in my sensitive memory.Tom Hanks was mesmerizing as the haunted comedian, a man with a lot of talent to make people laugh but a guy tormented by the lack of support from his father. There is a scene or two in here with this dad that is so uncomfortable to watch that it has prevented me from seeing this multiple times.Too bad, because I do remember some wonderful, funny scenes such as Hanks in the hospital entertaining the patients.
