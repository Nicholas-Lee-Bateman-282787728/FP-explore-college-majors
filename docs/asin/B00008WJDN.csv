(We are big fans of the Baby Songs DVDs by Hap Palmer in this household.:)The tunes are catchy and upbeat, which she loves, and I love how educational it is!  The ABCs are taught several times in different ways, shapes and colors too.  I was surprised at how it even teaches color combinations such as &#34;red and yellow make orange&#34;.  Exercise is encouraged too.  My daughter loves to move around the room and imitate the children on the screen.It is fast moving, but if your child watches it a LOT, like mine does, the tunes and images will eventually get stuck in her head and it becomes a great memory and educational aid!I would highly recommend this DVD for parents of babies and toddlers.  I can't think of anything bad to say about it.",5,"One of my daughters favorites, and very educational!",1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,857,"['probably', 'daughter', '2nd', 'favorite', 'DVD', 'first', 'one', 'being', '34', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'Baby', 'Busy', 'Day', '34', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'DVDs', 'Hap', 'Palmer', 'household', 'tunes', 'are', 'catchy', 'upbeat', 'love', 'how', 'educational', 'ABCs', 'are', 'taught', 'several', 'times', 'different', 'ways', 'shapes', 'colors', 'too', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'even', 'color', 'combinations', 'such', '34', 'red', 'yellow', 'make', 'orange', '34', 'Exercise', 'encouraged', 'too', 'daughter', 'move', 'room', 'imitate', 'children', 'screen.It', 'fast', 'moving', 'child', 'watches', 'LOT', 'mine', 'tunes', 'images', 'will', 'eventually', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'great', 'memory', 'educational', 'aid', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'parents', 'babies', 'toddlers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'bad', 'say']",N/A

He loved most of the songs, though some were too fast for him to appreciate at that age.I checked it out for a second time when he was 36 months old and he caught on to those faster songs just fine, but some of the slower sons were boring to him.At that time, I also had a 12 month old who couldn't have cared less about the songs or images, but he was happy because his big brother was obviously having a good time!This is not something you can sit your baby in front of and walk away. You have to interact and provide some tools (spoons, bananas, bean bags, etc) for the kids to get involved with the songs.

I was first introduced to Baby Songs as a teenage babysitter in the early 90's. The toddler for which I babysat had 2 Baby Songs videos which he loved to watch. I found that songs like Today I Took My Diapers Off and Sitting In My Highchair would be running through my head for days. Years later, after having a child of my own, I was delighted to discover that many of those same catchy tunes that I remembered from my babysitting days had been compiled in DVD format. We started by renting at the library and then purchased our own copies of Original Baby Songs, Baby's Busy Day, Baby Songs Animals, as well as this ABC video. I prefer Original Baby Songs and Baby's Busy Day to the other two we own, but in all fairness, my kids seem to adore all four equally. Yes, the songs are a bit corny and the hairstyles and clothes are a bit outdated (which I find endearing in a nostalgic sort of way), but your baby, toddler, or pre-schooler is sure to adore it. Isn't that what really matters? This particular DVD features songs that are a bit more educational in that they focus on shapes, numbers, colors, and ABC's. Don't expect this video to flawlessly educate your child in theses areas, eliminating the need for pre-school. I'm sure they do learn something from the songs because kids are like sponges and they are busy learning from all the different things they are exposed to during the course of a day. These songs are no exception. This DVD is likely to delight a toddler or preschooler who is enjoying an increasing awareness of numbers, letters, colors, and shapes as they encounter these things in the world around them. As with the other Baby Songs DVDs we own, this one is good, wholesome fun.",5,Another Baby Songs Winner,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,1847,"['love', 'baby', 'songs', 'house', 'have', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'one', 'year', 'old', 'Hap', 'Palmer', 'songs', 'never', 'fail', 'put', 'smile', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'teenage', 'babysitter', 'early', '90', 'toddler', 'babysat', 'had', '2', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'videos', 'loved', 'watch', 'found', 'songs', 'Today', 'Took', 'Diapers', 'Off', 'Sitting', 'My', 'Highchair', 'would', 'be', 'running', 'head', 'days', 'Years', 'later', 'having', 'child', 'own', 'was', 'delighted', 'discover', 'many', 'same', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'remembered', 'babysitting', 'days', 'had', 'been', 'compiled', 'DVD', 'format', 'started', 'renting', 'library', 'then', 'purchased', 'own', 'copies', 'Original', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'Baby', 'Busy', 'Day', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'Animals', 'as', 'well', 'ABC', 'video', 'prefer', 'Original', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'Baby', 'Busy', 'Day', 'other', 'two', 'own', 'fairness', 'kids', 'seem', 'adore', 'four', 'equally', 'Yes', 'songs', 'are', 'bit', 'corny', 'hairstyles', 'clothes', 'are', 'bit', 'outdated', 'find', 'endearing', 'nostalgic', 'sort', 'way', 'baby', 'toddler', 'pre-schooler', 'sure', 'adore', ""n't"", 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'particular', 'DVD', 'features', 'songs', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'educational', 'focus', 'shapes', 'numbers', 'colors', 'ABC', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'video', 'flawlessly', 'educate', 'child', 'theses', 'areas', 'eliminating', 'need', 'pre-school', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', 'learn', 'something', 'songs', 'kids', 'are', 'sponges', 'are', 'busy', 'learning', 'different', 'things', 'are', 'exposed', 'course', 'day', 'songs', 'are', 'exception', 'DVD', 'likely', 'delight', 'toddler', 'preschooler', 'who', 'enjoying', 'increasing', 'awareness', 'numbers', 'letters', 'colors', 'shapes', 'encounter', 'things', 'world', 'other', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'DVDs', 'own', 'one', 'good', 'wholesome', 'fun']",N/A

The original was great, this one...not so great. The title leads you to believe that it will teach your child to some degree the shapes, numbers etc..Not so, the songs touch on the learning angle briefly. The numbers go fast and the performances are quite dull to both my children. My 2 and my 4 year old get mildly entertained by this dvd, MILDLY. The color and shapes performances will not add much learning as they are light in content. At best, the tunes ""might"" entertain your child while you try to catch up around the house.

My kids and I are a big fan of many of the famous groups, but this little video is definitely the bomb-diggity! I'm so glad that I decided to try this video because it turned out to be exactly what I hoped it would be and even better, my kids LOVE it!!! It's simple and very engaging. My kids love watching it again and again. They participate in the song and dance activities as if they are part of the group of kids in the video. The alphabet, color, numbers, and shapes are all covered in a totally engaging format. This video will get your kids singing and dancing, and more importantly, LISTENING to the instructions of what to do when as they follow the lead of the little kids on the video. For instance, (kids are wearing different colored shirts) ""Yellow stand up and walk around red, blue stand up and hop on one foot..."" So not only does your child learn colors (numbers, shapes, or the alphabet), they learn to listen to directions, and then are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge to participate in coordinated activites.",5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,1114,"['Hooray', 'finding', 'gem', 'video', 'sea', 'commercialism', 'kids', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'many', 'famous', 'groups', 'little', 'video', 'definitely', 'bomb-diggity', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'decided', 'try', 'video', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'kids', 'LOVE', 'simple', 'very', 'engaging', 'kids', 'love', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'participate', 'song', 'dance', 'activities', 'are', 'part', 'group', 'kids', 'video', 'alphabet', 'color', 'numbers', 'shapes', 'are', 'covered', 'totally', 'engaging', 'format', 'video', 'will', 'get', 'kids', 'singing', 'dancing', 'more', 'importantly', 'LISTENING', 'instructions', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'follow', 'lead', 'little', 'kids', 'video', 'instance', 'kids', 'are', 'wearing', 'different', 'colored', 'shirts', 'Yellow', 'stand', 'up', 'walk', 'red', 'blue', 'stand', 'up', 'hop', 'one', 'foot', 'not', 'only', 'child', 'learn', 'colors', 'numbers', 'shapes', 'alphabet', 'learn', 'listen', 'directions', 'then', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'apply', 'knowledge', 'participate', 'coordinated', 'activites']",N/A
