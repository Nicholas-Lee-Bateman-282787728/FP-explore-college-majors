The latter is interesting to see as they filmed an Eleanor Powell dance (""Lady Be Good"")It also was interesting to see some of the stars in the early '90s when this was made, as they host certain segments of this 113-minute tribute. I am referring to June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Howard Keel, Gene Kelly, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney and Esther Williams.I also appreciated the fact they showed quite a bit of numbers in the widescreen format, something we never saw viewing these great musicals on VHS. We also see a very early edition of ""Singin In The Rain,"" with the likes of Jack Benny and Joan Crawford.Overall, a worthy edition to the ""That's Entertainment!"" package.",4,Nice Features In Here That We've Never Seen,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,982,"['last', 'Entertainment', 'installment', 'few', 'different', 'aspects', 'first', 'two', 'Entertainment', 'packages', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'song-dance', 'routines', 'never', 'made', 'screen', 'should', 'have', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'cameramen', 'filming', 'particular', 'number', 'latter', 'interesting', 'see', 'filmed', 'Eleanor', 'Powell', 'dance', 'Lady', 'Be', 'Good', 'also', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'stars', 'early', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'host', 'certain', 'segments', '113-minute', 'tribute', 'am', 'referring', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Esther', 'Williams.I', 'also', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'showed', 'quite', 'bit', 'numbers', 'widescreen', 'format', 'something', 'never', 'saw', 'viewing', 'great', 'musicals', 'VHS', 'also', 'see', 'very', 'early', 'edition', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'likes', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Joan', 'Crawford.Overall', 'worthy', 'edition', 'Entertainment', 'package']",N/A

Pawl ""Dani""","[4, 5]","THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT 3 is the final installment of the ENTERTAINMENT trilogy, that features older versions of the stars we came to love and recognize presenting a series of clips from their best-known movies, as well as outtakes with alternative choreoography, costumes and [sometimes] performers.  Some of my favorites from here include Cyd Charisse, in TORCH SONG, which was brought to film with Joan Crawford in a costume gawdy enough to make her look like a drag queen, and make-up reminiscent of minstrel shows (it really offended me, actually!), Fred Astaire's alternate version of ""I Want To Be a Dancing Man,"" dressed as a bartender, instead of in his ""standard"" tuxedo, and Ava Gardner singing ""Can't Help Loving That Man of Mine,"" in SHOW BOAT, without help from the dub artist, as the film later appeared in theatres.What makes THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT 3 especially stand out was a great appearance from Lena Horne.  I appreciate her honesty and candor with us, the audience, as she tells us, unflinchingly, about her racist experience with the film industry, how she was repeatedly overlooked for acting roles, and was usually featured as a singer in a lounge act, and then quickly hustled off of the stage.  Horne also experienced heartbreak when Ava Gardner was cast as biracial Julie in SHOW BOAT, instead of herself (due to film codes against miscygenation). I would have liked to see more of Lena Horne, in this, as well as other people of color who appeared in the MGM films, to hear their perspective, and see more clips with them.

Taylor ""GFT""","[18, 18]","Opening with a Gene Kelly-introduced segment concerning early efforts to develop musical stars and material, this third installment of the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT quickly seques into celebrity-introduced film clips from MGM musicals--film clips that range from familiar favorites to out-takes, rareities, and numbers that were cut from films before their release.  The narrators are well scripted, well filmed, and often interject insightful personal notes by introducing clips from their own movies.Such is the case with the legendary Lena Horne, who presents a casually-spoken but quite powerful narrative about the Hollywood racism that limited her career and ultimately prevented her from playing Julie in SHOWBOAT.  But the real power of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT III is in it's &quot;never-before-seen&quot; footage--footage that includes memorable performances by Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, and Lena Horne among others.  The film also offers the chance to see some truly rare bits of film, including Vaudeville acts hoping for film stardom, scenes from the early Technicolor and never-completed film MARCH OF TIME, and pre-code bathing-beauties.  THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT III doesn't have quite the same dash and splash or variety as the original THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT, but it moves at a smart pace, and fans of movie musicals will find a great deal to enjoy.

It is actually a film made 18 years after the second with a different feeling but still very good.  This film tends to focus more on a documentary feeling rather than nostalgia.  That's not a bad thing.  The film may be more sober but focuses more on the MGM Hollywood system that was able to bring about the amazing group of stars.  All actors were required to learn to sing and dance as well as acting and elocution, etc.  It is very enlightening.  There are out-takes that have never been shown before and the stars who contributed do a wonderful job, including Gene Kelley who seems to be suffering from emphysema.

Barszcz,"[4, 6]","THis is when Hollywood was at it's best and we were blessed with the MGM Musicals and no one did them better.I have all 3 &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; on Lazer Disc and  it is pretty wonderful, but TE 3 is not only more of the same wonderful singing and dancing but also takes you behind the scenes to show you how some of the MGM magic was done. I also ran this film at my theatre in Florida and it was longer than this version. It seems for some reason they have edited out the Cinerama segments and i don't know why.I so much wish that MGM would release these onto DVD in 5.1.  One of the neat things about this TE 3 is how the sound keeps switching from center speaker  to all five.  The sound is rich and thrilling. If you buy this video it will be like a wonderful history lesson of the movie musicals.They simply don't make them like this anymore for several reasons.  The first and most important is that there  isn't anymore great talent  left in Hollywood anymore. Second, we don't have really good directors. Third, there is no creative power anymore and forth is the cost.  So just sit back, relax and take a walk down memory lane and enjoy the best of what MGM had to offer.

The third installation could have been more of the same, but in the third part we are taken behind the scenes a bit more than the first. There are more narrators and in this regard it makes it similar to the first installment. It includes some well known scenes and lesser known scenes, but it's a bit more critical in an honest way and less a celebration of MGM's glory days. For example we see a musical scene with three sisters that's less than spectacular. We see scenes that were cut that should have been included. This installment was one of the first times we saw Judy Garland in ANNIE GET YOU'RE GUN and can make us wonder what the film would have been like had she been able and allowed to finish it. We also hear Lena Horne talk about how excited she was to be cast as Julie in the SHOWBOAT scene in TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY but how disappointed she was when censors decided that it would be too risky to cast her as Julie in the remake of SHOWBOAT.People who are familiar with the MGM musical library and its stars may enjoy this installment best of all.
