Mr. Frank deals first with the realization that he is permanently blinded as the result of a sports accident; then, with lack of cooperation from close-minded people. In a clever but tear-jerking ending sequence, he and his faithful dog, Buddy, make a case for service animals that even the hardened political committee can't ignore.",5,Not on DVD?

All seem hopeless until he learns of an innovative European project that trains dogs as guides for the blind. He explores the idea and decides to train for a dog. He eventually gets a guide dog, but soon learns that he is barred from taking his needed companion into transit vehicles and public buildings and businesses. With a newfound friend, he must fight to make the country recognize that those rules are unfair to him and his guide.As a friend of one who is sight impaired I had looked for this movie on DVD forever. I had an old VHS, but it was wearing out. I found this on DVD at santaflix dot com and am very happy with it. The story is truly one of the most inspiring I have ever seen. There are only a few movies about this very important subject (SECOND SIGHT with Elizabeth Montgomery comes to mind as another).  If you are lucky enough to be fully sighted, you will still be moved by this brave story.

800712,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B0001DA6DM,microjoe,"[4, 4]","BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: David Permut and Jimmy Hawkins produced this movie made for the Disney Channel, which premiered on October 7, 1984. Hawkins and Henry Denker wrote the script based on a true story as told in the book, ""First Lady of the Seeing Eye"" by Morris Frank and Blake Clark.  If you have kids or students that want to learn more after seeing the film, there is also a children's book titled ""Morris and Buddy: The Story of the First Seeing Eye Dog"".  Directed by Delbert Mann. Music score composed by Fred Karlin except for the song, ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" by George Gershwin. Buddy was played by a German Shepherd named Pilot, and the behind the scenes dog trainer for the film was Ron Bledsoe.  Filmed on location in Nashville, Tennessee and Leavenworth, Washington. Running time 99 minutes. Great supporting cast including Ernest Borgnine, Glynnis O'Conner, Susan Dey, Patricia Neal, Arthur Hill, Richard Speight Jr, and Ralph Bellamy. The Disney Studio also produced a ""making of"" special for the Disney Channel. Earlier in 1972, Disney had produced a 3 episode film called ""Atta Girl, Kelly!"" about a Seeing Eye dog. Would be a good candidate for DVD.THE STORY: The story about 20 year old popular boy in town Morris Frank (Timothy Bottoms), an athletic young man who had a promising career in insurance sales, and planned to be married to his sweetheart. An accident in the late 1920's leaves him blind, and Frank begins to run into prejudice in his work, while he yearns for the independence he once knew. Eventually he becomes resentful of his dependence on others. He travels to Switzerland to learn more about a new program that trains dogs to help blind veterans.  The program is run by an American named Dorothy Eustice (played by Eva Marie Saint). There Frank learns to work with Buddy, and returns to America. Upon arrival things are not working out as well as he imagined, since he is prohibited from taking his dog into many public places. Frank works to get the media to recognize the importance of Seeing Eye dogs, and fight for legislation allowing guide dogs in buses, stores and restaurants. Along the way, Frank has to deal with his anger and lack of trust in others, including Buddy. Frank became a pioneer in advocacy for access to persons with disabilities and he helped to establish a school for training working dogs in America named The Seeing Eye. A well made and inspirational drama.",5,"Behind the scenes, Inspirational true story",1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,2435,"['THE', 'SCENES', 'TRIVIA', 'David', 'Permut', 'Jimmy', 'Hawkins', 'produced', 'movie', 'made', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'premiered', 'October', '7', '1984', 'Hawkins', 'Henry', 'Denker', 'wrote', 'script', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'book', 'First', 'Lady', 'Seeing', 'Eye', 'Morris', 'Frank', 'Blake', 'Clark', 'have', 'kids', 'students', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'seeing', 'film', 'also', 'children', 'book', 'titled', 'Morris', 'Buddy', 'Story', 'First', 'Seeing', 'Eye', 'Dog', 'Directed', 'Delbert', 'Mann', 'Music', 'score', 'composed', 'Fred', 'Karlin', 'song', 'Someone', 'Watch', 'Me', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'Buddy', 'was', 'played', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'named', 'Pilot', 'scenes', 'dog', 'trainer', 'film', 'was', 'Ron', 'Bledsoe', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Nashville', 'Tennessee', 'Leavenworth', 'Washington', 'Running', 'time', '99', 'minutes', 'Great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Glynnis', ""O'Conner"", 'Susan', 'Dey', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'Richard', 'Speight', 'Jr', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Disney', 'Studio', 'also', 'produced', 'making', 'special', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Earlier', '1972', 'Disney', 'had', 'produced', '3', 'episode', 'film', 'called', 'Atta', 'Girl', 'Kelly', 'Seeing', 'Eye', 'dog', 'Would', 'be', 'good', 'candidate', 'DVD.THE', 'STORY', 'story', '20', 'year', 'old', 'popular', 'boy', 'town', 'Morris', 'Frank', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'athletic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'promising', 'career', 'insurance', 'sales', 'planned', 'be', 'married', 'sweetheart', 'accident', 'late', '1920', 'blind', 'Frank', 'run', 'prejudice', 'work', 'independence', 'once', 'knew', 'Eventually', 'resentful', 'dependence', 'others', 'Switzerland', 'learn', 'more', 'new', 'program', 'dogs', 'help', 'blind', 'veterans', 'program', 'run', 'American', 'named', 'Dorothy', 'Eustice', 'played', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Frank', 'learns', 'work', 'Buddy', 'returns', 'America', 'arrival', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'working', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'imagined', 'prohibited', 'taking', 'dog', 'many', 'public', 'places', 'Frank', 'get', 'media', 'recognize', 'importance', 'Seeing', 'Eye', 'dogs', 'fight', 'legislation', 'allowing', 'guide', 'dogs', 'buses', 'stores', 'restaurants', 'way', 'Frank', 'deal', 'anger', 'lack', 'trust', 'others', 'including', 'Buddy', 'Frank', 'became', 'pioneer', 'advocacy', 'access', 'persons', 'disabilities', 'helped', 'establish', 'school', 'training', 'working', 'dogs', 'America', 'named', 'Seeing', 'Eye', 'A', 'well', 'made', 'inspirational', 'drama']",Love Leads The Way
