1085002,A3R74EHB34JTTP,B000S1MM8O,Amazon Customer,"[3, 6]","I've seen a lot of exercise videos and DVDs, and this one is is bland and boring by any standard. When you think 'go-go', you think sexy and maybe even a little naughty/racy/suggestive, but this DVD is tame enough for a church group. The choreography - what there is of it - is surprisingly uninspired. Most of it is composed of low-impact step-touches and step-crosses, those classic old standbys of 1980s aerobic dance vids. But go-go? I think not-not. A lot more of it is just standing while you slowly - almost robotically - shake your hips, thrust your pelvis, or pop your chest. You'll have to work hard to raise your heart level and keep it up for any meaningful benefit.The music is mind-numbingly repetitive and just plain dull. The mannequins in this are almost zombie-like (except for the manic blonde on the left) and the trademark Crunch whoops and hollers appeared to be dubbed in. (And speaking of the dancers, why are the ethnic women placed far off to the sides of the group, nearly out of shot?)The blandness even extends to the set. There isn't the slightest bit of 'go-go' ambiance in either lighting or decor. The backdrop has the traditional Crunch ""brick loft"" look with step platforms and Swiss balls piled neatly in one corner. Yawn.For beginners, this is better than nothing, but it won't take long for them to be ready for something a little more vigorous. It's much less like those lap-dance videos by Carmen Electra and very much more like those indoor walking videos by Prevention and Denise Austin. And even those are more fun than this.",1,Bland and boring,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,1568,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'exercise', 'videos', 'DVDs', 'one', 'bland', 'boring', 'standard', 'When', 'think', ""'go-go"", 'think', 'sexy', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'naughty/racy/suggestive', 'DVD', 'tame', 'enough', 'church', 'group', 'choreography', 'what', 'surprisingly', 'uninspired', 'Most', 'composed', 'low-impact', 'step-touches', 'step-crosses', 'classic', 'old', 'standbys', '1980s', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'vids', 'go-go', 'think', 'not-not', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'standing', 'slowly', 'almost', 'robotically', 'shake', 'hips', 'thrust', 'pelvis', 'pop', 'chest', ""'ll"", 'have', 'work', 'hard', 'raise', 'heart', 'level', 'keep', 'up', 'meaningful', 'benefit.The', 'music', 'mind-numbingly', 'repetitive', 'just', 'plain', 'dull', 'mannequins', 'are', 'almost', 'zombie-like', 'manic', 'blonde', 'left', 'trademark', 'Crunch', 'whoops', 'hollers', 'appeared', 'be', 'dubbed', 'speaking', 'dancers', 'why', 'are', 'ethnic', 'women', 'placed', 'far', 'sides', 'group', 'nearly', 'shot', 'blandness', 'even', 'set', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'bit', ""'go-go"", 'ambiance', 'lighting', 'decor', 'backdrop', 'traditional', 'Crunch', 'brick', 'loft', 'look', 'step', 'platforms', 'Swiss', 'balls', 'piled', 'neatly', 'one', 'corner', 'Yawn.For', 'beginners', 'better', 'nothing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'be', 'ready', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'vigorous', 'much', 'less', 'lap-dance', 'videos', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'indoor', 'walking', 'videos', 'Prevention', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'even', 'are', 'more', 'fun']",Crunch: Cardio Go-Go Dance
1085003,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B000S1MM8O,atisheh,"[3, 3]","I have one negative thing to say about this video, and a number of positive remarks, so I'll begin with the negative: the Gypsy Clark's high-pitched, grainy voice kind of drives me nuts. Now, after forty minutes of hearing it and having endorphins coursing through my body, I no longer had a nails-on-chalkboard reaction to it, but oh were the first ten minutes ever hard.Now for the positive: first of all, this is the first Crunch dance-based DVD I've done that actually felt like dancing. I don't know what it is about cardio-style dancing, but that cha-cha and that hip-hop never seem anywhere close to the real thing. There's something so weirdly controlled, so robotic, about cardio instructors' dance movements. It's like someone took my croissant and made it whole-grain. I'm sure it's better for me, but it tastes funny. That said, I've grown to like them, even Marie Forleo in all her strangeness. I'd rather do a fake cha cha than twenty jumping jacks. But Cardio Go-Go Dance actually feels like dancing. It's only one kind of dance for the full DVD (no medley of ""Latin heat"" or whatever), and a lot of the moves felt like what I might do naturally in a club.What I expected even less was this: so many of the movements were bellydance movements! Chest lifts and shimmies, hip bumps and lifts, omis, and so on. The mood and the music are completely different, but I think the video would be a great way for bellydancers to do some cardio that would warm up exactly the muscles they use, but with a wholly different vibe.Finally, I really liked the fact that the backup dancers/exercisers varied in the way they performed, or danced, the movements. In fact, some of them did the movements in a more dancey, if not as intense, way than Gypsy Clark. Watching them I got a sense of how the video could be done more as a dance warmup than as a typical cardio workout.

Instructor Gypsy Clark does a reasonably good job with cueing.  Very personable instructor, although I didn't need to hear how ""hot"" I was every few minutes!There's some impact in this one but I found it easy to modify.  I didn't have any issues with doing this one on carpet.There's some Go-Go type dancing in this workout, but there's also some fun 50's burlesque style dancing (think Gypsy Rose Lee) which I had fun doing.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really get the heartrate up there, but I can't elevate my heartrate with my Island Girl hula workouts either...this is just some fun dancing stuff.The music was adequate...however, there's one section in the workout where the music didn't match the movement.  I'm guessing that Crunch couldn't get the license to the music piece they wanted and subbed another music piece in, which was a tiny bit slower tempo than what the dancers were using.  I recognized it from Crunch Cardio Salsa...it didn't really work for the dance moves in the section.  It was a little off-putting seeing the dancers one beat ahead of myself...Crunch REALLY should have fixed the music in that section before releasing the DVD.  But it's just 5 minutes out of the 41 minutes of workout, so I'll survive.Recommend to intermediates with some dance experience.",3,"Fun workout, a couple of issues though",1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1370,"['Crunch', 'Cardio', 'Go-Go', 'Dance', 'approximately', '41', 'minutes', 'warmup', 'cooldown', 'Instructor', 'Gypsy', 'Clark', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'cueing', 'Very', 'personable', 'instructor', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'hear', 'how', 'hot', 'was', 'few', 'minutes', 'impact', 'one', 'found', 'easy', 'modify', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'issues', 'doing', 'one', 'carpet.There', 'Go-Go', 'type', 'dancing', 'workout', 'also', 'fun', '50', 'burlesque', 'style', 'dancing', 'think', 'Gypsy', 'Rose', 'Lee', 'had', 'fun', 'doing', 'Unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'heartrate', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'heartrate', 'Island', 'Girl', 'hula', 'just', 'fun', 'dancing', 'stuff.The', 'music', 'was', 'adequate', 'however', 'one', 'section', 'workout', 'where', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'movement', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Crunch', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'license', 'music', 'piece', 'wanted', 'subbed', 'music', 'piece', 'was', 'tiny', 'bit', 'slower', 'tempo', 'what', 'dancers', 'were', 'using', 'recognized', 'Crunch', 'Cardio', 'Salsa', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'dance', 'moves', 'section', 'was', 'little', 'off-putting', 'seeing', 'dancers', 'one', 'beat', 'ahead', 'Crunch', 'REALLY', 'should', 'have', 'fixed', 'music', 'section', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'just', '5', 'minutes', '41', 'minutes', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'survive.Recommend', 'intermediates', 'dance', 'experience']",Crunch: Cardio Go-Go Dance

I liked that it was lower impact but it still got my heart rate up.  It was no where near as cheesy as Denise Austin's Cardio Dance and Sculpt.  However, it was not very exciting. It was fun and cute but not a real workout.  Maybe I will use it as a warm up for pilates or yoga or for days when I don't want to work out because this is better than nothing.I think this would be great for pre-teens and teens. I know the title makes it sound a little questionable, but it really was not at all.

She has 6 backup girls all different ethnics & one who actually doesn't have rock hard abs. They all stay perky with her & don't seem bored at all during this 40 min workout.The moves start up mostly about shoulder rolls & shakes ala burlesque style in the warm up for 4 min, but goes quickly to go-go style, a hint of latin (salsa & cha-chas), a lot of 60s (pony), 70s disco, a touch of hip hop & the cool down had some body rolls.You learn a move, repeat it 4-5x or more, then build up into a routine after every new move after that. There are about 4-5 different routines you learn.All the moves are relatively easy, she broke down one or 2 moves that she thought might need it. She never goes half speed or slower. She doesn't give any body movement cues that will help you to figure it out anymore then mimicking by watching, just mostly calls out the name she gives the move.Most of the moves were corny in my opinion, she even throws in hops for no reason other then to build up the heart rate & a couple moves just had kicking forward, I was thinking, ""What, are we doing kickboxing now?"" If it was suppose to be a hip hop move, I wouldn't know, it just looked silly. There were a few moves I did like, but only about 20% of it. After 30 min, I just stood there, FFWing until I saw a move that looked interesting & wanted to try. I like Gypsy, I liked the pace of the workout, the repetition & routine style & hope there's another dvd with more recent moves that are more sensual/fluid instead of jumpy, child-like cute.Beginners would like this, those who like corny dances like Yoga Booty Ballet does (though I love their yoga/toning), and people who exercise somewhat regularly could use this as a light day.You can see a preview at collagevideo com & on youtube under ""Crunch Cardio Go Go Dance"" from totalfitnessdvds",3,"Cute, silly, keeps you moving, but very corny moves",1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,1910,"['Courtney', 'Gypsy', 'Clarke', 'very', 'upbeat', 'cute', 'personality', 'always', 'encouraging', '6', 'backup', 'girls', 'different', 'ethnics', 'one', 'who', 'actually', ""n't"", 'have', 'rock', 'hard', 'abs', 'stay', 'perky', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bored', '40', 'min', 'workout.The', 'moves', 'start', 'up', 'mostly', 'shoulder', 'rolls', 'shakes', 'ala', 'burlesque', 'style', 'warm', 'up', '4', 'min', 'quickly', 'go-go', 'style', 'hint', 'latin', 'salsa', 'cha-chas', 'lot', '60s', 'pony', '70s', 'disco', 'touch', 'hip', 'hop', 'cool', 'down', 'had', 'body', 'rolls.You', 'learn', 'move', 'repeat', '4-5x', 'more', 'then', 'build', 'up', 'routine', 'new', 'move', 'are', '4-5', 'different', 'routines', 'learn.All', 'moves', 'are', 'relatively', 'easy', 'broke', 'down', 'one', '2', 'moves', 'thought', 'might', 'need', 'never', 'half', 'speed', 'slower', ""n't"", 'give', 'body', 'movement', 'will', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'anymore', 'then', 'mimicking', 'watching', 'just', 'mostly', 'out', 'name', 'move.Most', 'moves', 'were', 'corny', 'opinion', 'even', 'hops', 'reason', 'other', 'then', 'build', 'up', 'heart', 'rate', 'couple', 'just', 'had', 'kicking', 'forward', 'was', 'thinking', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'kickboxing', 'now', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'hip', 'hop', 'move', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'looked', 'silly', 'were', 'few', 'moves', 'did', 'like', 'only', 'about', '20', '%', '30', 'min', 'just', 'stood', 'there', 'FFWing', 'saw', 'move', 'looked', 'interesting', 'wanted', 'try', 'Gypsy', 'liked', 'pace', 'workout', 'repetition', 'routine', 'style', 'hope', 'dvd', 'more', 'recent', 'moves', 'are', 'more', 'sensual/fluid', 'instead', 'jumpy', 'child-like', 'cute.Beginners', 'would', 'like', 'who', 'like', 'corny', 'dances', 'Yoga', 'Booty', 'Ballet', 'love', 'yoga/toning', 'people', 'who', 'exercise', 'somewhat', 'regularly', 'could', 'use', 'light', 'day.You', 'can', 'see', 'preview', 'collagevideo', 'com', 'youtube', 'Crunch', 'Cardio', 'Go', 'Go', 'Dance', 'totalfitnessdvds']",Crunch: Cardio Go-Go Dance
