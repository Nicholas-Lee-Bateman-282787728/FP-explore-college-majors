1020749,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B000IIFGQM,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[2, 2]","JASMINE WOMEN is a Chinese chick-flick. A tear-jerker showcasing the top Chinese actress today -- Zhang Ziyi -- playing 3 generations of luckless-in-love young women with Joan Chen (the premiere Chinese actress of almost two decades ago) taking the maternal role to her, whether as mother or grandmother. Evidently, combining the names of the 3 women Zi plays -- Mo, Li, and Hua -- results in the Mandarin word for ""Jasmine"".Most of the movie's melodrama didn't move me, in part cuz I ain't a chick. And, in part cuz the script was composed of scenes of short bursts (&agrave; la Hollywood's impatient style) which fail to produce dramatic depth.Still, I got fairly involved in the second story set during the Cultural Revolution when the story took a couple turns that I didn't expect. (For a fascinating film of the travails of a Chinese family during Mao's reign, tryTO LIVEwith Gong Li -- the immediate predecessor to Zi as the top Chinese star and almost the star of this film.) And I became totally caught up in the film's very intense and very unexpected climax which almost justified the rest of the movie.At least there were lots of pretty pictures, albeit with a slightly bleached color palette shifting hues with each episode, but still more colorful than today's Hollywood style. With Zi front and center, growing in beauty as the movie progressed, there was nothing to complain about.In common with Gong Li, Zhang Ziyi is one of the most appealing and potent of actresses ever -- with her child-like beauty, luminous screen presence and sublime acting talent. As usual, she gave it her all thru out the film.Joan Chen is still stunning and has to be aged by makeup. Unfortunately, she has a fairly marginal role in the first part, but as her roles grow in importance in sections two and three, so does her effectiveness -- altho she remains in the background clearly in support of Zi.The drama is overall paper thin and, even with the skilled moviemaking technique, is worth 3 stars at best. However, Zi soars above it and earns it an extra one.The ""My Way"" DVD has a ""making of"" featurette -- in Mandarin -- with no English subtitles (???).",4,A showcase for Zi,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,2154,"['JASMINE', 'WOMEN', 'Chinese', 'chick-flick', 'tear-jerker', 'showcasing', 'top', 'Chinese', 'actress', 'today', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'playing', '3', 'generations', 'luckless-in-love', 'young', 'women', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'premiere', 'Chinese', 'actress', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'taking', 'maternal', 'role', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'Evidently', 'combining', 'names', '3', 'women', 'Zi', 'plays', 'Mo', 'Li', 'Hua', 'results', 'Mandarin', 'word', 'Jasmine', '.Most', 'movie', 'melodrama', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'part', 'cuz', 'ai', ""n't"", 'chick', 'part', 'cuz', 'script', 'was', 'composed', 'scenes', 'short', 'bursts', 'agrave', 'Hollywood', 'impatient', 'style', 'fail', 'produce', 'dramatic', 'depth.Still', 'got', 'fairly', 'involved', 'second', 'story', 'set', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'when', 'story', 'took', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fascinating', 'film', 'travails', 'Chinese', 'family', 'Mao', 'reign', 'tryTO', 'LIVEwith', 'Gong', 'Li', 'immediate', 'predecessor', 'Zi', 'top', 'Chinese', 'star', 'almost', 'star', 'film', 'became', 'totally', 'caught', 'up', 'film', 'very', 'intense', 'very', 'unexpected', 'climax', 'almost', 'justified', 'rest', 'movie.At', 'least', 'were', 'lots', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'slightly', 'bleached', 'color', 'palette', 'shifting', 'hues', 'episode', 'still', 'more', 'colorful', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'Zi', 'front', 'center', 'growing', 'beauty', 'movie', 'progressed', 'was', 'nothing', 'complain', 'about.In', 'common', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'potent', 'actresses', 'ever', 'child-like', 'beauty', 'luminous', 'screen', 'presence', 'sublime', 'acting', 'talent', 'usual', 'gave', 'thru', 'film.Joan', 'Chen', 'still', 'stunning', 'be', 'aged', 'makeup', 'Unfortunately', 'fairly', 'marginal', 'role', 'first', 'part', 'roles', 'grow', 'importance', 'sections', 'two', 'three', 'so', 'effectiveness', 'background', 'clearly', 'support', 'Zi.The', 'drama', 'overall', 'paper', 'thin', 'even', 'skilled', 'moviemaking', 'technique', 'worth', '3', 'stars', 'best', 'However', 'Zi', 'extra', 'one.The', 'Way', 'DVD', 'making', 'featurette', 'Mandarin', 'English', 'subtitles']",Jasmine Women

1020752,A3M2AZ0YXQNMKU,B000IIFGQM,"Tenchi Masaki ""Jurai's Heir""","[13, 15]","Jasmine Women is the story of three generations of women from the same Shanhai China family: grandmother, mother and granddaughter.Chapter 1: Grandmother - In the 1930's, Mo (Zhang Ziyi/Ziyi Zhang) who lives with her mother (Joan Chen), meets Mr. Meng (Jiang Wen), a manager of a movie studio. A close relationship with Meng makes Mo's dreams of being a famous movie star come true and leaves her pregnant and abandoned by Meng after the japanese invasion of China. After the baby girl is born Mo blames her daughter for everything that she has lost in her life.Chapter 2: Mother - In the 1950's Li (Zhang Ziyi/Ziyi Zhang) has lived a life of great misery. She marries Zou Jie (Lu Yi) just to get away from her mother Mo, now played by (Joan Chen). Unable to bear children of her own, she adopts a baby girl, named Hua. In time, from miscarrying and bad childhood memories, she starts to lose her mind, which leads her husband Zou to commit suicide. Li leaves the family never to be seen or heard from again.Chapter 3: Granddaughter - In the 1980's Hua (Zhang Ziyi/Ziyi Zhang) has been raised by her grandmother Mo (Joan Chen). Mo treated her own daughter Li very badly, but now finds comfort in caring for her granddaughter. Hua gets pregnant from her husband Xia Du (Liu Ye), who got married in secret from her grandmother, after her husband goes far away to school she tells her grandmother about the marriage and that she's pregnant. After finding out, she tells Hua about how having children in the family is a curse to them, not listening to her grandmother she commits suicide by drinking a bottle of Jasmine perfume that she had when she was very young. Hua divorces Xia because of his infidelity and starts a better life with her daughter.The performances from Zhang Ziyi/Ziyi Zhang and Joan Chen are excellent. Zhang/Ziyi won the Best Actress Golden Rooster award in 2004 for this film, she also plays all three of the young women and Joan Chen plays them when they get older. However like a reviewer said on another website ""the story leaves you wanting more"" & he is right, I wanted more out of the three storys. The film does have drama in it, but it's no ""The Joy Luck Club"" which was a great film!. I didn't mention everything that will be in the film, because that would give it all away. I don't know if this is a Bootleg version of the film, because it's plays and it looks like a Offical release, which is really good, The colors on this DVD are  dark and rich. The sound is really good, I see nobody getting up in front of the screen, so it's Offical and the picture nevers freezes. This film only contains one disc too.DVD information:16:9 Widescreen.
