I have been watching and waiting for it to be for sale on DVD, at a price people can afford. Why hasn't this wonderful movie been produced??? What, positively, could be the holdup?

Bonnie Bedelia plays a no nonsense judge that can't get no satisfaction.  Billy Wirth plays the dark, handsome stranger that thrills and eventually chills her.  Surprisingly, the love scenes left a lot to the imagination.....(which isn't often the case today) and they were still hot despite the fact that the characters were still clothed!  Not a bad flick at all.",4,Sexy & Satisfying,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,476,"[""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'was', 'straight', 'video', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'nonsense', 'judge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'satisfaction', 'Billy', 'Wirth', 'dark', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'thrills', 'eventually', 'Surprisingly', 'love', 'left', 'lot', 'imagination', '..', ""n't"", 'often', 'case', 'today', 'were', 'still', 'hot', 'fact', 'characters', 'were', 'still', 'clothed', 'Not', 'bad', 'flick']",Judicial Consent VHS

It's really a great movie and even though it never hit the theatre screen and was only shown on TV it should've been marketed on DVD for the public to see and purchase.Sure there may be a lot of sex scenes in the movie but it has an incredible story that goes with it and an suspenseful one at that! I love this movie and have it on VHS but who watches VHS movies anymore now days? I have a vast DVD collection and would give anything to have this movie on DVD. Never mind Amazon has a few out there from Sellers who have it for $1,000 and more in Japan ONLY! Don't get that either. If this movie IS on DVD in Japan then why hasn't it hit the markets here in the U.S. since it's made by and stars American actors? I'm thinking surely the $1,000 copies are just that - copies or bootlegs. Just don't get it. If you can purchase it on DVD in Japan then WHY NOT HERE in AMERICA???? Hello??? Also there's some used ones available as well but for just a mere $100 or more too. Come on!!!! As if the average hard working minimum wage American can afford these prices? Too bad I'm not rich or won the lottery then I could get this movie on DVD from Japan. NOT!!! Sorry! Would rather give that much money to the starving people in other countries much less the U.S. before I'd purchase a $1,000 or $100 DVD! Our world is so messed up! Very greedy and sinful! Have mercy! Oh well... I still watch this movie from time to time when I'm glued to the TV some days and feel like watching my old VHS tapes but really don't enjoy a tape compared to a DVD that you can take anywhere and everywhere. I'll be darn if I would pay that much for a DVD! Sad anyone who has actually paid THAT much for this movie on DVD or any other. Give it to the poor and needy or your local church or an organization who could really use and need it.PLEASE someone out in Hollywood or wherever, market this movie on DVD!! I would purchase it in a heart beat if only it were $10 or under. It truly is a great movie in my book but not worth $1,000 or even $100. No movie is worth THAT much on DVD, Blue Ray or whatever! Sorry but just had to get my two cents worth in here with the other comments because this movie is one of my favorites and two, just couldn't believe how much Seller's are asking for this on DVD especially from the land of the Rising Sun!

I've worked on many films and Judicial Consent turned out to be one of the better ones, Bonnie Badelia was such a delight to work with.  The mood of the film is wonderful and the suspense thrilling.  The only reason I'm giving the film two (2) stars is not for the film itself but because after 15 years or so it still hasn't been released to the general public.  Has everyone forgotten about this film?  I keep looking for it, but still no release date,  Please release this film now!  I would love to see this wonderful movie again and also have the thrill of seeing my name in the end credits on yet another motion picture.
