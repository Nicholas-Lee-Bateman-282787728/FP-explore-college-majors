He's in Middle School now, and he's sick of all the crap. One day he's killed by a Mech that falls from the sky. The alien girl piloting it resurrects him and he becomes the new pilot of the Mecha called Linebarrel. Now that he has power, he's turned into a douchebag. He joins the Juda Corporation to fight the evil Kato organization. Kato is led by a man from another dimension, he wants to pave the way for a huge invasion. After many failures and revelations, Kouichi realizes his purpose and becomes a true hero.This anime really surprised me. There are tons of giant robot animes out there, and most of them are pretty average. This one rises above the average series in the Mech genre. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all great. There are lots of really cool and memorable characters. This anime also has tons of action, drama, comedy, romance, and fanservice. It's not for kids. There is some strong language, nudity, and some suggestive stuff herein. Overall, this anime is great. It reminded me of Gundam Seed Destiny, RahXephon, and Full Metal Panic.

Linebarrels of Iron is another giant robot Anime, though this one has a bit of a odd twist. The hero (Kouichi Hayase) is...well kind of a ***. The series starts off with our hero being bullied at school and forced to run errands for his tormentors. With dreams of grandeur the tool of his salvation falls in his lap...well more like lands on his head and squishes him flat. Once our hero is back on his feet (thanks to Emi, the pilot of said giant falling robot of hero squishing) our Kouichi takes off to fight the bad guys...and cause hundreds of thousands of dollars in collateral damage at the same time.What truly makes this show stand out if that our hero...its kind of a jerk (to put it nicely), and ends up cause more trouble than our aforementioned bad guys. though due to his own arrogance which results in the death of his best friend and the almost alienation of everyone around him, our ""Hero of Justice"" goes from being a one man natural disaster to a loveable screw up (yes, I promise theres a difference). With a whirlwind of love triangles, giant robot battles, and Karaoke (because every Anime needs a Karaoke scene), this show turns out to be one you'll defiantly want to add to your collection.",5,Another One for The Books,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1343,"['one', 'shows', 'almost', 'always', 'come', 'chance', ""'d"", 'have', 'admit', 'think', 'lucked', 'out', 'one', 'Linebarrels', 'Iron', 'giant', 'robot', 'Anime', 'one', 'bit', 'odd', 'twist', 'hero', 'Kouichi', 'Hayase', 'well', 'kind', '***', 'series', 'hero', 'being', 'bullied', 'school', 'forced', 'run', 'errands', 'tormentors', 'dreams', 'grandeur', 'tool', 'salvation', 'lap', 'well', 'more', 'like', 'lands', 'head', 'flat', 'Once', 'hero', 'back', 'feet', 'thanks', 'Emi', 'pilot', 'said', 'giant', 'falling', 'robot', 'hero', 'squishing', 'Kouichi', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'cause', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'collateral', 'damage', 'same', 'truly', 'show', 'out', 'hero', 'kind', 'jerk', 'put', 'nicely', 'up', 'cause', 'more', 'trouble', 'aforementioned', 'bad', 'guys', 'due', 'own', 'arrogance', 'results', 'death', 'best', 'friend', 'almost', 'alienation', 'everyone', 'Hero', 'Justice', 'being', 'one', 'man', 'natural', 'disaster', 'loveable', 'screw', 'up', 'yes', 'promise', 'difference', 'whirlwind', 'love', 'triangles', 'giant', 'robot', 'battles', 'Karaoke', 'Anime', 'Karaoke', 'scene', 'show', 'out', 'be', 'one', ""'ll"", 'defiantly', 'want', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
1407608,AFV2584U13XP3,B004GZZH8K,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[10, 11]","If you like humorous action mecha animes like Full Metal Panic or Dai Guard than this series is a nice add on to those,  but you have to take the series with a grain of salt if you're expecting some in depth strong serious storyline like with series Twelve Kingdoms, Moribito, or The Gundam universe series than you will be a little disappointed.  The amazon editorial give pretty much the storyline of the series as again while you'll have the main enemy that wishes to enslave humanity and a group of mecha pilots who will stand up to the threat,  of course you'll have the usual rivalry between the main character pilot and another pilot,  the more than one girl who has feelings for the main character which causes friction between the infatuated females,  and finally the twist that will cause our hero to doubt himself and someone to renew his self confidence again.  Though the series characters are very endearing each with their own little quirks and hobbies that make them standout in the series,  though some reviewers have said the main character pilot K'ichi Hayase becomes to egotistic from his power trip from becoming much stronger than he was I thought that he wasn't that to much of an egomaniac as written.  At first Hayase does become a little drunk on his power but it doesn't reach the near narcissistic quality of the character of Light Yagami from Death Note.  The series set was a nice price as you get the two added OVA's with this set unlike with the previous release as the OVA came separately from the two part series set,  the animation and soundtrack fit nicely for the series and if you've seen or have another series called Fafner or Gundam Seed you'll see some similarities with the animation.  The Japanese voice cast did a superb job and the cast that Funimation choose for the characters were picked very well too,  the are little more extras with this set but all in all pretty much the usual so nothing to really shout about.  So if you're a fan of Full metal Panic or just looking for an entertaining mecha series here's a pretty decent one to try out for your anime collection...",5,An Enjoyable Mecha Anime For What It Is,1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,2120,"['like', 'humorous', 'action', 'mecha', 'animes', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'Dai', 'Guard', 'series', 'nice', 'add', 'have', 'take', 'series', 'grain', 'salt', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'depth', 'strong', 'serious', 'storyline', 'series', 'Twelve', 'Kingdoms', 'Moribito', 'Gundam', 'universe', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'amazon', 'editorial', 'give', 'pretty', 'much', 'storyline', 'series', 'again', ""'ll"", 'have', 'main', 'enemy', 'enslave', 'humanity', 'group', 'mecha', 'pilots', 'who', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'threat', 'course', ""'ll"", 'have', 'usual', 'rivalry', 'main', 'character', 'pilot', 'pilot', 'more', 'one', 'girl', 'who', 'feelings', 'main', 'character', 'friction', 'infatuated', 'females', 'finally', 'twist', 'will', 'cause', 'hero', 'doubt', 'someone', 'renew', 'self', 'confidence', 'again', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'endearing', 'own', 'little', 'quirks', 'hobbies', 'make', 'standout', 'series', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'main', 'character', 'pilot', ""K'ichi"", 'Hayase', 'egotistic', 'power', 'trip', 'becoming', 'much', 'stronger', 'was', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'egomaniac', 'written', 'first', 'Hayase', 'become', 'little', 'drunk', 'power', ""n't"", 'reach', 'near', 'narcissistic', 'quality', 'character', 'Light', 'Yagami', 'Death', 'Note', 'series', 'set', 'was', 'nice', 'price', 'get', 'two', 'added', 'OVA', 'set', 'previous', 'release', 'OVA', 'came', 'separately', 'two', 'part', 'series', 'set', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'fit', 'nicely', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'series', 'called', 'Fafner', 'Gundam', 'Seed', ""'ll"", 'see', 'similarities', 'animation', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'cast', 'Funimation', 'choose', 'characters', 'were', 'picked', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'extras', 'set', 'pretty', 'much', 'usual', 'so', 'nothing', 'really', 'shout', 'about', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Full', 'metal', 'Panic', 'just', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'mecha', 'series', 'here', 'pretty', 'decent', 'one', 'try', 'out', 'anime', 'collection']",N/A

Drew ""Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","[3, 4]","This is one of those rare Anime (forgetting that it more high school kids!) that treats people like they are real. The main character, Kouichi Hayase has an unfortunate encounter with Linebarrel and becomes his ""Factor"" - basically his human operator.  Saying more is spoiler city.  He lets the power get to him, acts like a power crazed brat, and goes overboard with his hero of justice bit. Finally - a character who's not all pure and goody-goody. He has to grow into his power and we see him mature as the series continues.The final episode, while containing enough twists and turns, gets too new-age metaphysical. The series theme song is the #1 most annoying, grating, nails-on-blackboard Anime theme I have ever heard.The animation, English voice-overs, plots - all are top notch and perfect.Giant robots?
