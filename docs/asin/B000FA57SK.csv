986696,AIMR915K4YCN,B000FA57SK,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 0]","THE GARDEN is an allegory w/ religious imagery. Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Near Dark, Pumpkinhead, Face The Evil, etc.) plays an old farmer named Ben Zachery. 13yo Sam (Adam Taylor Gordon) and his dad (Brian Wimmer) are stranded at Ben's farm after a terrible accident. Ben has an ancient tree in his garden that has some particularly important fruit growing on it. He spends much of his time tempting Sam's recovering alcoholic dad into drinking and chasing hot women, while secretly tormenting Sam and committing various eeevil acts. Sam soon discovers Ben's true identity and the reality behind his lies. Can he convince his dad that Ben isn't the nice guy he appears to be, or will Ben triumph in his bid to reverse biblical prophesy? THE GARDEN is a freaky thriller w/ well-handled, mystical aspects. Henriksen is exceptional in his demonic role, and the kid is believable and never becomes annoying! Watch for Sean Young (Bladerunner, Headspace) as Sam's teacher Ms. Chapman, and Claudia Christian (""Babylon 5"", The Hidden) as Sam's psychologist. Their roles are bigger that you might think!

During the commentary, the director repeatedly points out that this movie was filmed on a low budget and in nineteen days. Considering those limitations, the movie turned out quite well. The acting was anywhere from acceptable to quite good (the guy who played the old man was especially good) and the musical score was very nicely done. The production values were also quite good. What was truly substandard was the story. There were awkward Biblical references. There was melodrama. There was heavy-handed use of symbols. There were also short cuts taken in the plot that were a little hard to ignore. I'm sure that if there had been more time to film this movie, much of the story would have been revised, but a weak story is kind of hard to overlook and so I feel generous in awarding three stars to this movie!",3,Weak Story,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,933,"['movie', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'disappointing', 'were', 'several', 'aspects', 'production', 'deserve', 'praise', 'commentary', 'director', 'repeatedly', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'low', 'budget', 'nineteen', 'days', 'Considering', 'limitations', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'acting', 'was', 'anywhere', 'acceptable', 'quite', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'especially', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'What', 'was', 'truly', 'substandard', 'was', 'story', 'were', 'awkward', 'Biblical', 'references', 'was', 'melodrama', 'was', 'heavy-handed', 'use', 'symbols', 'were', 'also', 'short', 'cuts', 'taken', 'plot', 'were', 'little', 'hard', 'ignore', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'time', 'film', 'movie', 'much', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'revised', 'weak', 'story', 'kind', 'hard', 'overlook', 'so', 'feel', 'generous', 'awarding', 'three', 'stars', 'movie']","Garden, The"

986700,A32AJA0B59J0OM,B000FA57SK,Matt,"[12, 13]","This isn't really a bad movie, all things considered.  The actors involved turn in decent performances, and Lance Henriksen plays his particular role extremely well. The first 2/3 of the movie work really well at building a tense, sinister atmosphere.  The real problem here lies in the details. There are a lot of little moments in the movie that demonstrate a lack of care on the behalf of the director. There is a scene where the old man says he listens to Mozart, and then promptly puts on a record that sounds absolutely nothing like Mozart.  There's a game of chess that the old man ponders over for a couple of days, and then the boy beats him in one move. And then there's the slide show/presentation that a girl does in their Bible study class that is pretty silly.  One problem that I had with the movie is that it kind of aims itself at a Christian market , but anyone with knowledge of the Bible would know how ridiculous the plot is.  The Garden of Eden, for example, is supposed to be guarded so that humans can't enter it, and it definitely isn't anywhere near Oklahoma.  And since the devil already got a human to eat from the Tree of Knowledge in the book of Genesis, it doesn't make much sense that his doing it again would achieve much. Also, I'm pretty sure the four horsemen aren't supposed to signal the beginning of the apocalypse by riding out of some guy's barn. Overall I can't help but think that this plot might have been hatched while someone was watching Dogma.",3,Possible spoilers...,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,1491,"[""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'things', 'considered', 'actors', 'involved', 'turn', 'decent', 'performances', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'particular', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'first', '2/3', 'movie', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'building', 'tense', 'sinister', 'atmosphere', 'real', 'problem', 'here', 'details', 'are', 'lot', 'little', 'moments', 'movie', 'demonstrate', 'lack', 'care', 'behalf', 'director', 'scene', 'where', 'old', 'man', 'Mozart', 'then', 'promptly', 'record', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Mozart', 'game', 'chess', 'old', 'man', 'over', 'couple', 'days', 'then', 'boy', 'one', 'move', 'then', 'slide', 'show/presentation', 'girl', 'Bible', 'study', 'class', 'pretty', 'silly', 'One', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'kind', 'aims', 'Christian', 'market', 'anyone', 'knowledge', 'Bible', 'would', 'know', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'example', 'supposed', 'be', 'guarded', 'so', 'humans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enter', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'near', 'Oklahoma', 'devil', 'already', 'got', 'human', 'eat', 'Tree', 'Knowledge', 'book', 'Genesis', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'doing', 'again', 'would', 'achieve', 'much', 'Also', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'four', 'horsemen', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'signal', 'beginning', 'apocalypse', 'riding', 'guy', 'barn', 'Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'plot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hatched', 'someone', 'was', 'watching', 'Dogma']","Garden, The"

After spending some time under a psychiatrist's care, he is released to his recovering alcoholic father (Brian Wimmer, more effective than usual) and they head home to his estranged mother's house.  An ""accident"" leads them into the home of mysterious farmer Lance Henriksen, giving one of his better recent performances.  It soon becomes apparent that kindly Lance has something evil up his sleeve, and that the boy and his father are part of it.  Sean Young pops up as the relgiously oriented schoolmarm, offering no evidence of what was once considered a star in the making.

I was quite impressed by the cinema-tography and many of the performances, particularly Adam Taylor Gordonand Lance Henricksen.  It seemed hokey at first, which this genre oftenis, and despite the impossibility of the story, I found it to be of muchbetter quality than the material seemed to deserve.  By the end, I decidedI really liked it despite its flaws.  Then later, I watched it again totry to better understand the plot and concept.  As it attempts to portraya biblical allegory literally, it is, in my opinion, attempting an impossible task, and it is only minimally successful.  As one who isnot at all religious, I am amazed at how much I enjoyed the film.  Irecommend this for fans of thrillers and horror pictures for its suspenseand scenery, and the restraint the director used when compared to theexcesses in many of these type movies today.
