1068896,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B000P6R9NU,Arcadio Bolaos,"[0, 0]","Cam Archer's ""Wild Tigers I have known"" is a story about Logan, an unpopular, awkward and insecure kid that gets bullied every now and then. He takes it all in and he lives in a world of his own, in some sort of ill-induced stupor state. Until one day he meets an older boy named Rodeo. He is rebellious, rough-edged and scruffy. Of course Logan falls in love with him. They're both marginal figures at moments but for different motives. Rodeo decides to ditch his girlfriend to spend more time with his younger friend, while Logan has no choice but to be rejected by everybody except Rodeo.Despite the initial happiness rush, Logan starts fantasizing about death. Neglected by his mother, the only true conversation she has with her is about ghosts and reincarnation. He wants to know if she would hug him if he were a ghost.There are instances in which Logan doesn't seem to be aware of his body. The only way in which he can inscribe himself into the world is by marking his chest and stomach. Writing, thus, creates the object. Writing creates or recreates him. But it's only symptomatic to witness Logan's fascination with women's clothes, lipsticks and long, blonde wigs. He's constantly dressing up as a girl or pretending to be a girl in order to obtain the love of a boy. It would be interesting, then, to contrast H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous views on women writing that breaks the linear logic of male counterparts. Certainly, the entire film seems to defy this linear logic either from a cinematographic or a narrative perspective. In writing his own body with a red lipstick Logan makes us think of Katie Conboy'sWriting on the Body: Female Embodiment and Feminist Theorybecause, ultimately, there is an unresolved sexual charge in Cam Archer's characters.From the very beginning of the story Logan is interested in mountain lions. These felines are beautifully designed animals, almost as gorgeous as the tangle-lined tiger. Logan's high school is constantly threatened by these animals that the principal considers very dangerous. Students are told to run as soon as they see a mountain lion. Logan, nonetheless, feels compelled to approach them. He goes into the woods with Rodeo trying to find them to no avail. Only unaccompanied will he be able to fulfill this wish. The mountain lion is beauty, it's beauty in an Apollonian way as Nietzsche would understand it. It's the beauty of light, of appearance, that covers the horror within. Fear of death can only be overcome by Apollonian beauty. But it's also through this beauty that Logan summons death. He will put his life at risk partly obeying Freud's Thanatos urge, and partly because the only way to face live is to uncover the horror of existence. Because facing life is also accepting one's own mortality. And by reaching out to this wild animal Logan is only unveiling what lies beneath.",4,Writing the body of a boy,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,2862,"['Cam', 'Archer', 'Wild', 'Tigers', 'have', 'known', 'story', 'Logan', 'unpopular', 'awkward', 'insecure', 'kid', 'bullied', 'now', 'then', 'world', 'own', 'sort', 'ill-induced', 'stupor', 'state', 'one', 'day', 'older', 'boy', 'named', 'Rodeo', 'rebellious', 'rough-edged', 'scruffy', 'course', 'Logan', 'love', ""'re"", 'marginal', 'figures', 'moments', 'different', 'motives', 'Rodeo', 'ditch', 'girlfriend', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'younger', 'friend', 'Logan', 'choice', 'be', 'rejected', 'everybody', 'Rodeo.Despite', 'initial', 'happiness', 'rush', 'Logan', 'fantasizing', 'death', 'Neglected', 'mother', 'only', 'true', 'conversation', 'ghosts', 'reincarnation', 'know', 'would', 'hug', 'were', 'ghost.There', 'are', 'instances', 'Logan', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'aware', 'body', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'inscribe', 'world', 'marking', 'chest', 'stomach', 'Writing', 'thus', 'object', 'Writing', 'creates', 'only', 'symptomatic', 'witness', 'Logan', 'fascination', 'women', 'clothes', 'lipsticks', 'long', 'blonde', 'wigs', 'constantly', 'dressing', 'up', 'girl', 'pretending', 'be', 'girl', 'order', 'obtain', 'love', 'boy', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'then', 'contrast', 'H', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'Cixous', 'views', 'women', 'writing', 'linear', 'logic', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Certainly', 'entire', 'film', 'defy', 'linear', 'logic', 'either', 'cinematographic', 'narrative', 'perspective', 'writing', 'own', 'body', 'red', 'lipstick', 'Logan', 'think', 'Katie', ""Conboy'sWriting"", 'Body', 'Female', 'Embodiment', 'Feminist', 'Theorybecause', 'ultimately', 'unresolved', 'sexual', 'charge', 'Cam', 'Archer', 'characters.From', 'very', 'beginning', 'story', 'Logan', 'interested', 'mountain', 'lions', 'felines', 'are', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'animals', 'almost', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'tangle-lined', 'tiger', 'Logan', 'high', 'school', 'constantly', 'threatened', 'animals', 'principal', 'considers', 'very', 'dangerous', 'Students', 'are', 'told', 'run', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'mountain', 'lion', 'Logan', 'nonetheless', 'feels', 'compelled', 'approach', 'woods', 'Rodeo', 'trying', 'find', 'avail', 'Only', 'unaccompanied', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'fulfill', 'wish', 'mountain', 'lion', 'beauty', 'beauty', 'Apollonian', 'way', 'Nietzsche', 'would', 'understand', 'beauty', 'light', 'appearance', 'horror', 'Fear', 'death', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'overcome', 'Apollonian', 'beauty', 'also', 'beauty', 'Logan', 'summons', 'death', 'will', 'put', 'life', 'risk', 'partly', 'obeying', 'Freud', 'Thanatos', 'urge', 'partly', 'only', 'way', 'face', 'live', 'uncover', 'horror', 'existence', 'facing', 'life', 'also', 'accepting', 'one', 'own', 'mortality', 'reaching', 'out', 'wild', 'animal', 'Logan', 'only', 'unveiling', 'what', 'beneath']",N/A

""Wild Tigers I Have Known"" (2006) successfully conveys this via the isolation, loneliness and despair of Logan, a 13 year old middle school student who is infatuated with one of the popular, athletic boys, Rodeo Walker.  Logan not only dotes on the limited friendship Rodeo is willing to extend to the shy boy, but constantly daydreams about developing the relationship, making it obvious to his schoolmates who proceeds to taunt him unmercifully.  Ultimately, Logan's obsession drives him to attempt a dangerous charade in hopes of conveying his feelings to the other boy.This is a difficult film to watch, with many ""artsy"" touches and slow, confusing segues from reality to Logan's dream world, justified in trying to emulate the confused, seemingly pointless state of Logan's emotions.  While Logan eventually learns to accept his feelings, the film remains mostly a depressing hodge-podge of conflict and fuzzy images of reality, not really the thing to brighten up the day of someone going through what Logan is experiencing.  While it may be highly original, beautifully photographed and outstanding as an ""art"" film, my rating is based on the likely reaction of a regular viewer of gay-themed theatrical films, who would likely consider this just satisfactory overall.

The film has no plot of any kind and in the end, which comes none too soon, it is clear to see only the director knew the purpose of this film. An hour into it, I sheepishly leaned towards my friend and said, ""Listen..uhhh...do you have ANY idea of what this film is about?"" He had to stifle his laughter, while admitting he was thinking the same thing! I don't care for the oft-used word, ""artsy"" because I adore art films and Independent film. Having said that, artsy, to an almost laughable degree, is the only way to describe this thing! You see, the director TRIED TOO HARD to be ""weird"" and ""cutting edge"" and in the end of it all, the ""metaphorical"" catastrophies become highly annoying.  I kept waiting for it to make sense or at least be interesting, then all of a sudden the credits started rolling! After the film I coulnd't help but ponder how I would ever reclaim those few lost hours of my life, spent watching this film.Fairuza Balk is the only one with any substance in this film (or who even speaks in complete sentences!), but even her few scenes could not save it. Outside of her brief scenes, the dialogue is absolutely meaningless and goes nowhere. Was it a ""coming of age"" story or yet another  ""teen angst"" film?

The producer has developed a masterpiece of a cinematograhic succession of emotional challenges some 13 year old boys are confronted with.  In this production Logan is a typical, average 13 year old boy who is a loner, soft-spoken, lives in a single-parent home with no Father and has mysterious emotional attractions which commence with masturbation and experimenting with relationships.  I assert this movie is not about political correctness for same-sex relationships.  At his MIddle School, Logan struggles with acceptance by his peers, girls ignore him and only one member of the inner social circle of the student population gives this boy kindness.  Logan's equally lonely and isolated friend Joey is obsessed with social attributes which made boys popular.  Logan has fixations on boys - in particular, Rodeo Walker who is an older student and the member of the student inner-circle who is decent to him. when Logan offers himself to Rodeo, of course, the older boy with understanding refuses to give Logan what he seriously desires in desperate infatuation.

If you are a fan of art house movies, or special effects, then you might like this movie. But if you are looking for a sympathetic look at the stirring of same sex intimacy among adolescent boys, this movie was big disappointment.Too bad, because the basic plot had a lot of potential as a sweet coming of age story about an the confusion a young gay boy experiences with his first infatuation--the kind of puppy love we have all experienced at least once in our lives. 13 year old Logan is a clumsy nerd who has trouble fitting in with his classmates. Logan had sexual fantasies about his classmate, Rodeo, the school's wrestling hero. To Logan's surprise, he finds that he has more in common with Rodeo then he expected. Rodeo likes Logan's iconoclastic attitudes toward their  boring junior high school social life, not to mention the fawning hero worship that Logan heaps on him. An unlikely friendship develops, and they begin to hang out together, taking walks in the woods and on the boardwalk.The budding friendship ends when sexually confused Logan calls Rodeo on the phone claiming to be a girl called Leah. Not surprisingly, when Rodeo discovers that Leah is really Logan, he finds the deception too weird for him to bear. Word gets out about Logan and his world comes crashing down on him.The movie did receive an award for special effects, but I found the special effects took up entirely too much of the movie. The lack of dialogue led me to wonder whether the filmmaker was making a special effects movie instead of romantic drama. There too many long, lingering shots of Logan's face. Several times I was  tempted to fast forward through them until the next scene. What dialogue there was consisted of monosyllables, so there was very little character development, or any insight into why the boys were attracted to each other.The only good part of the movie were the heartfelt performances of the 2 young actors--Malcolm Stumpf and Patrick White. Unfortunately, as good as they two boys were in their parts, they were not enough to save the movie from it's defects.",2,"Sweet story of a puppy love is overwhelmed by artsy-fartsy gimmicks, special effects",1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,2194,"['good', 'reviews', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'movie', 'alternated', 'irritating', 'boring..', 'are', 'fan', 'art', 'house', 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'sympathetic', 'look', 'stirring', 'same', 'sex', 'intimacy', 'adolescent', 'boys', 'movie', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment.Too', 'bad', 'basic', 'plot', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'sweet', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'confusion', 'young', 'gay', 'boy', 'experiences', 'first', 'infatuation', 'kind', 'puppy', 'love', 'have', 'experienced', 'least', 'once', 'lives', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Logan', 'clumsy', 'nerd', 'who', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'classmates', 'Logan', 'had', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'classmate', 'Rodeo', 'school', 'wrestling', 'hero', 'Logan', 'surprise', 'more', 'common', 'Rodeo', 'then', 'expected', 'Rodeo', 'Logan', 'iconoclastic', 'attitudes', 'boring', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'social', 'life', 'not', 'mention', 'fawning', 'hero', 'worship', 'Logan', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'begin', 'hang', 'out', 'together', 'taking', 'walks', 'woods', 'boardwalk.The', 'budding', 'friendship', 'when', 'sexually', 'confused', 'Logan', 'Rodeo', 'phone', 'claiming', 'be', 'girl', 'called', 'Leah', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'when', 'Rodeo', 'Leah', 'really', 'Logan', 'deception', 'too', 'weird', 'bear', 'Word', 'out', 'Logan', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'him.The', 'movie', 'did', 'receive', 'award', 'special', 'effects', 'found', 'special', 'effects', 'took', 'up', 'entirely', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'led', 'wonder', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'making', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'instead', 'romantic', 'drama', 'too', 'many', 'long', 'lingering', 'shots', 'Logan', 'face', 'Several', 'times', 'was', 'tempted', 'fast', 'forward', 'next', 'scene', 'What', 'dialogue', 'was', 'consisted', 'monosyllables', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'insight', 'why', 'boys', 'were', 'attracted', 'other.The', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'heartfelt', 'performances', '2', 'young', 'actors', 'Malcolm', 'Stumpf', 'Patrick', 'White', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'boys', 'were', 'parts', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'defects']",N/A

1068906,A1L86PH9ESHCY2,B000P6R9NU,Kevin G. Fetner,"[1, 1]","Unlike the other 'critics' here, I found this film quirky and ultimately refreshing. The director isn't trying ""too hard to make a art house film"", rather, he's made something unusually refreshing without blood gore. Since when are art house films supposed to be predictable and pat? Given that the boy's mother is queen of the 'double bind'- ""I love you/I hate you"", he's desperately trying to deal with that and his burgeoning gay sexuality. Maybe most people in America are now so sated that they are expecting some patent commonalty in gay, coming of age films. The gay community both old and young are about DIVERSITY, not cookie cutting conformity even in how we develop our individual sexualities. My childhood was not like this boy's, but still I empathize with exactly what he went through. What may put off a lot of the viewers is the fact that the boy's fantasies are intermixed with his actual physical reality. That worked in ""My Life In Pink"", it works here and I think over all the movie is brilliantly posed and executed.

It is a stream-of-consciousness exploration of the confused mind of a boy who is just beginning to figure himself out.Yes, the pacing of the story is pretty darn slow.  You might get a little impatient with it once in awhile.  But, if you let it seep gradually into your mind, the movie will surely grow on you.  Watching this flick is like slowly sipping several glasses of fine wine.  You might not feel the kick right away but, when you do, it will be a high-flying time.There really isn't much of a plot.  This movie is all about feeling things and discovering things and wondering about a lot of things.  Logan, the main character, is a sweet, rather delicate boy.  He's not sure about himself.  He is coming to terms with his basic sexuality and he's trying to figure out how to relate to the people around him.He thinks he might be in love with an older boy at his school.  But everything is like a dream for him and so he is not at all certain what he feels.  A lot of the time, he is fairly content to simply lie down on the grass and stare up at the entrancing blue sky.  As he dreams, we dream along with him.This is a tranquil, meditative and artistically inspired film.",5,Wild Tigers We Have All Known,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,1265,"['dreamy', 'languid', 'lyrical', 'movie', 'are', 'car', 'explosions', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'exploration', 'confused', 'mind', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'beginning', 'figure', 'pacing', 'story', 'pretty', 'darn', 'slow', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'impatient', 'once', 'awhile', 'let', 'seep', 'gradually', 'mind', 'movie', 'will', 'surely', 'grow', 'Watching', 'flick', 'slowly', 'sipping', 'several', 'glasses', 'fine', 'wine', 'might', 'not', 'feel', 'kick', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'high-flying', 'time.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'feeling', 'things', 'discovering', 'things', 'wondering', 'lot', 'things', 'Logan', 'main', 'character', 'sweet', 'rather', 'delicate', 'boy', 'not', 'sure', 'coming', 'terms', 'basic', 'sexuality', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'relate', 'people', 'him.He', 'thinks', 'might', 'be', 'love', 'older', 'boy', 'school', 'everything', 'dream', 'so', 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'lot', 'time', 'fairly', 'content', 'simply', 'lie', 'down', 'grass', 'stare', 'up', 'entrancing', 'blue', 'sky', 'dream', 'along', 'him.This', 'tranquil', 'meditative', 'artistically', 'inspired', 'film']",N/A

This one you have to ""be with""; A lot of blurs and random music and sounds, like contemporary art. Yet it does makes sense if you follow closely. Besicaly there is this constant and ongoing turmoil of a crash of one boy on another, and coming-of-age and coming out dealing with. A boy is obviously gay, likes putting on lipstick and likes wearing a wig. He also likes touching himself, while thinking of a boy of his choosing. Yet he doesn't want to think he's gay, because gay is a label and hatred at school. All of the time I was waiting for this kid to kill himself. Middle-school is tough. One thing I didn't get though, is the kid's voice is rather mature, and he looks sorta late 14 if not 15, but definitely not 13. This movie is definitely worth  watching, as it shows how fragile yet beautiful life is. Ending is strange, if not abrupt, leaving me want more out of the movie, if not happy ending of some sort.
