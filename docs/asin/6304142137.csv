Jeanne Garofalo plays the so-called ugly duckling to the glamorous, long-legged Uma Thurman. The two have little in common but both of them fall for a charming brit played by Ben Chaplin. This film is so cute, I never get sick of watching it. This film makes you think and you might just see a bit of yourself in it. I highly recommend The Truth about Cats & Dogs.

403917,A1QI4ATF368A9B,6304142137,Allison,"[2, 2]","This is an enjoyable female version of Ceranco de Bergerac tale. I think a common misperception of this film is that Janeane Garofalo's character, Abby, is supposed to be an unattractive woman who can't get a man because of her dowdy looks. In fact, Abby is actually someone who has many attractive attributes--she's a smart, funny, pretty professional woman who can get a man but is held back by her insecurities and very low self-esteem. That is why Abby decides to use Uma Thurman's Noelle, who is tall, thin, and blonde--her complete opposite--as her body double. I don't normally like romantic comedies, but this film is sweet and has a nice message--just be yourself and don't pretend to be something you're not to make other people happy. This is one of Janeane's few leading roles. I wish she could get the lead in more movies, but because she looks more like a regular woman and not like a runway model, she gets stuck in supporting parts.

Her acting chops are certainly  not lacking either. She is as good an actor as she is beautiful. But don't  get me wrong, I'll never be blind to Uma Thurman's charms! This is a very  good, though slightly formulaic comedy that still manages to get in a few  barbs about our appearance-obsessed society and about how we can all  sometimes be stung by a momentary lapse of self-esteem.

403919,ANYEL2T9NDED7,6304142137,"Amazon Customer ""Melusine Bee""","[5, 6]","Romantic comedy does not have the reputation of being &quot;great.&quot; This movie is the exception to that undeserved rule.From the first time I saw the advertisements, I knew that Abby Barnes and I had something in common.  So much so, I was actually afraid to see this movie in the theatre.  I was afraid to rent it.  But when it came to network TV, I set the VCR, and the following night I watched it.  And I watched it again the next night.  And the next.  And the next.Something about this movie crawls inside you and won't let go.  The characters are intensely real in their insecurities, their small-lies-turned-big-disasters.  I fell 100% for Brian the first time he uttered one of his witty quips, and when I see Abby yearning for him, I yearn right along with her.  When Abby's and Noel's friendship is strained by their living this lie, my heart goes out to them.But don't think this movie is all sap.  It has some of the wittiest moments I've ever seen committed to film.  &quot;It's a ked,&quot; has got to be one of my all-time favorite lines!  And Uma Thurman turns eating a few bites of cake into the most sensuous scene I've seen committed to film.The only bone of contention I have is that, while Jeneane Garafolo is a marvelous actress, even she can't convince me that she is ugly.  She's gorgeous--far outshining Uma Thurman in every way--except height.See this movie, rent this movie, buy this movie.  It'll get inside you and it won't let you go.

403920,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,6304142137,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[14, 15]","Two of my absolute favorite women here - Janeane and Uma, so I enjoyed seeing it when it first came out.  Then I watched it again last week.  Wow what a difference eight years made in my perception.Alot of humor is funny because there is some underlying truth.  But have you ever heard the dead silence following the punch line because a joke struck a little too close to home?Of all the thousands of actresses they could have picked,... they picked these two, who because they personify so perfectly the sterotypes that are supposed to make this movie so funny..., I didn't laugh as much as I had the first time.Here are two fabulous women, Jeanane and Uma, who contribute to the life experience of the rest of us here on the planet simply because they exist.  Due in part to their humanity and vulnerability, they are gifted actresses (and brillint comedienne and stunning model).  But they are also people who I suspect in real life, because of something as arbitrary as the exterior contours of their bodies, also probably suffer because of these external realities.I know its supposed to be a comedy, but I couldn't help but think about the real life experiences of women like these.  Sure I laughed when it was funny, like when Jeanane looks up after the idiot guy breaks her violin bow (who does deadpan, sarcastic, and angst better than Janeane?), and when Uma makes the guy fall off his bike.  But I couldn't help but empathize with both women.  Sure the ending is sweet, if totally unrealistic.  You hope for both women that they will find quality men who understand them, and are worthy of them.  But in a movie with ""The Truth About..."" in its title, you know what the truth really is.Five stars because I enjoyed it.  I wish I could find more of Jeanane in a comedy setting, she is absolutely brilliant, unique, and wonderful (and hot - the phone sex was amazing!).  Uma is marvelous, and I hope she does less action work in the future, so her gorgeous personality can come out like I think it did in this movie.The characters end as friends because they were loyal to each other - the foundation of a great relationship.  This was my happy ending (which occured ten or fifteen minutes before the romantic one)!",5,Wickedly ..... serious.

403922,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304142137,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","This movie is a romcom, AKA romantic comedy, and the twist is that the smart, short girl gets the guy, not the tall blonde model, Noelle (Uma Thurman). Dr. Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofalo) is a veterinarian with a call in radio show, but low self esteem when it comes to men. Brian (Ben Chaplin) is a caller with a dog problem. He got a big dog from the pound for a photo shoot, and put the pooch on roller skates. The dog is destroying the house, but he can't get him off the skates. Abby talks him through it, and he ends up bonding with the dog. He tries to arrange a face-to-face meeting, to thank her, and also, because he is attracted to her. Duh. She doesn't show up for the rendezvous, but then a series of seemingly random events conspire to make him think that Abby's attractive neighbor Noelle is the woman he has been speaking to.Janeane is used to playing the friend. In Reality Bites, she was really a hoot, but the story focused on Winona Ryder. She was just the back story, an after thought, really. Even though she had a lot going on, it was all Winona, Winona, Winona. In this film, however, they really get you to be more interested in Abby, and Noelle is cute and a nice if not too bright person, but she is so boring that you are really more attracted to Abby, and you don't even notice that they never even tie the loose ends up with Noelle and the jerks she dates, like Roy. Maybe she could've hooked up with Ed (Jamie Foxx), Brian's friend. I'm surprised that she didn't hook up with anyone, but the story is really about Brian and Abby, and they live happily ever after (or don't, just so I am not spoiling the end for anyone who hasn't seen this).This is a well made romcom and I wasn't asking too much of it, but neither was I disappointed. Garofalo wise cracks her way through with much aplomb, but seeing her jokes on paper, they aren't nearly as funny. Guess it is just her deadpan delivery and comic timing. Another thing I will say is that they handled the preposterous plot well, and didn't just get sloppy and think, who cares? This is just a romcom. Preposterous, yes, but plausible the way it was filmed, and they never ignore the laws of physics or violate the time-space continuum.The movie also has cute cats & dogs. Abby has a cat that looks just like my cat, Felix. A fluffy black and white cat with a cute black nose. Hank is the big dog that Brian adopts. Hank is kind of like Marmaduke, the dog in the newspaper comics. It was good, but I am only giving it 3 stars.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Uma Thurman .... NoelleThe Accidental Husband (2008) ....

That is, you have everything OK about you except your looks...Well, this movie gives hope to those of us who are like that. Of course, it's still a romantic comedy, but somehow it's more than that.Smart, funny, talented Abby 'meets' Brian, the man of her dreams, during a radio-show. He's a photographer making a commercial who during shooting has put roller blades on a very large and agressive-looking dog (who afterwards becomes just as affectionate as any puppy) and now cannot approach him to take them off. Abby is a vet and she helps him do this. And now he wants to meet her... she almost accepts but then he asks what she looks like and she, being rather short and chubby, gives in to her insecurities and describes herself as tall, blond and slim... the exact picture of her nextdoor neighbour.It's kind of like Cyrano de Bergerac on the reverse. Brian loves Abby's spirit but Noelle's looks... and he is confused all the time as to why the woman he speaks on the phone with is never the same as the one he sees.The quasi love-scenes are great... Brian has one with Noelle when he convinces her to eat some sweets (she is always on a diet to keep her figure) and for her it is almost an erotic experience. The music during this scene is beautiful. Then there is one when he talks with Abby on the phone for over 7 hours and they... well, kind of make love.But what is great is that in the end Brian chooses the right answer to Abby's question: ""If you were stranded on an island, whom would you choose to spend the time with: Playboy's playmate of the year or Time's magazine woman of the year?""If you feel like an ugly duckling down and out of luck, go watch this movie.

She has also said on her radio show she hates making ""romantic comedies"" because she doesn't believe in them.  I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here.  This film is a trifle at best.  She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring, unbelievable ""romantic comedy"" that has no basis in the real world.  Whereas there will be some who will say ""suspend your disbelief"", one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood.  Janeane's character, for some reason, is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her look unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film).  That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two.  In reality, Ben Chaplin's character would more than likely stay with Uma, not Janeane, despite Janeane being attractive in her own right (despite being filmed in a peculiar way).  I think a lot of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character, and actually scoring with Janeane.  Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower gentlemen.

Janeane Garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical, depressed, miserable, pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want.Of course, she's not really acting. That's really her: lock, stock, and barrel. The miserable, pessimistic, vicious act isn't an act at all.The fly in the ointment to this movie is that Uma Thurman is not a knockout. Of course, some men would prefer the tall, thin blonde over the short brunette, but the basis of the movie hinges on Uma being the gorgeous woman and Janeane being average.

You take the normal, formulaic romantic comedy and  intentionally and self-consciously cast contrarily so that Janeane Garofalo  is the romantic lead and Uma Thurman is her side kick. Moreover, you make  no attempt to hide Uma's beauty (remember &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; and  Laura San Giocomo costumed to avoid us noticing her). In this case, the  whole point is  Noelle (Uma Thurman) is prettier than Abby (Janeane  Garafalo). This is brought to a head by Brian (Ben Chaplin) who calls in to  Abby's veterinary radio show and finds himself intrigued by the woman he  speaks to on the telephone. The problem enters when Abby, thinking he would  rather date Noelle, introduces Noelle as herself. This would be alright if  this guy were a one night stand, but he is serious and real and wants the  charming woman he met on the telephone. Even he begins to notice that  Noelle (despite her obvious charms) is not that woman. In the only sex  scene in the movie (conducted via telephone) Brian and Abby finally do come  together, but her deception, born of insecurity, thwarts them.

403943,A2YQ5O6XV23543,6304142137,Kevin H. Dudley,"[2, 4]","The delightful 1996 romantic comedy ""The Truth About Cats & Dogs"" is a truly great film that features a great cast doing stupendous work and one of the best dogs ever in a feature film too. I don't really care that much for romantic comedies as a whole as they usually are way to boring, formulaic and saccharine for my tastes but this fun film proved to be a big exception to that rule. (I can vouch that my obsession with all things Uma Thurman is what caused me to watch the film in the first place but I wound up being a huge fan of it regardless). It's stood the test of time pretty well and is just as fun as it was during its initial release. Sure, the plot may stretch believability at a certain point especially by the third act but they still manage to pull it off if you don't think about it too hard.As for the fairly recent blu-ray release of this film, I can say that without a doubt that this is one of the worst blu-ray releases of a film that I've seen to date. The HD transfer doesn't look any better than the ancient anamorphic DVD and I'm not lying in saying that I believe that the old DVD has some better color saturations in some places that beat the blu-ray in that area. It appears that they simply used the old ancient HD master used for the DVD and didn't bother to revisit it or try to restore it or give it some technical spit & polish. There's a couple of scenes in which detail seem a bit improved ever so slightly but overall the transfer is a complete joke on the blu-ray. If you have the DVD, don't even bother upgrading to the blu-ray as I did as there really isn't any point. The blu-ray is also bare bones too which is a shame as this is a movie deserving of some extras of some sort even if only a commentary track by the director and/or cast.So, in a nutshell, don't even bother with the blu-ray of this film. It's not worth it and it is one of the worst blu-ray transfers that I've ever seen a company just dump onto a disc.

She was burning down the house trying to beat the Parker Posey record of having made the most consecutive movies within a twelve month period.  Then came this movie and she was forced to confront the Garofalo ceiling, that there would be no big future for her in the movies.  People just didn't warm up to her enough.  She was funny and sassy and had that amusing deadpan face Sarah Silverman later rode to the top.And yet there was something smug and repulsive about her, and this movie showed it in spades.  She played a radio talk show host and dog expert, who gave sarcastic advice to pet owners about their dogs and cats (hence the title) and who fell in love with the handsomest British man in town.  And yet he preferred Uma Thurman to her!  Then she decides to masquerade as Uma Thurman--never a bright idea, and one certain to backfire on you.  Actually Garofalo isn't a bad looking woman, maybe a little hunched together like Judy Garland but that worked for her in general, but in THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS there were too many uninspired Michael Lehmann shots of her nose to nose with a pitbull or boxer, far too many visual comparisons of her as a dog.  Few stars could walk away from this constant barrage unscathed and, of course, she wasn't quite a star.  And plus people felt cheated, they had plunked down their $9 to see an Uma Thurman movie, and instead of Uma, the camera was constantly going to Janeane Garofalo!  Indeed Uma hardly appears in the last half hour of the movie and none of the remaining characters even mentions her existence!  Plus how humiliating for Uma!  The credits list ""Acting Coach for Uma Thurman,"" an indignity none of the other actors had to endure.  What they should have hired was a ""Personality Coach for Janeane Garofalo.""The dog is super cute and they should have just called the movie, ""Hank,"" it would have been a modest success instead of a monster flop.Jamie Foxx just twiddles his thumbs and glowers in the stereotypical ""black best friend"" part.

403951,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6304142137,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 8]","Being an action movie fan, I rarely enjoy movies about love because they always seem to be centered around some incredibly beautiful woman, the type of woman that rarely becomes the average guy's wife.  This movie breaks through that stereotype by casting Janeane Garofalo as animal talk show hostess Abby.Abby (Janeane) is pretty, but not pretty in the way that her neighbor Noelle (Uma Thurman) is.  In the principal stereotype of the movie, it is obvious that Abby is intelligent and well-educated, and Noelle is a few pennies short of a dollar.  When Abby takes a call from Brian (Ben Chaplin), there is an immediate attraction between the pair.  However, when Brian asks Abby to meet him, insecure Abby describes Noelle.  Abby's insecurity tells her that men are principally interested in tall leggy blonds with big, well, you know.As the movie progresses, there is the usual humor as the three characters keep meeting while Abby and Noelle attempt to pull off the deception that Noelle is Abby.  Of course, Brian is in love with a brain, not a body, and eventually the truth must come out.  Enough said about that part of the movie.The question of beauty in movies is rarely tackled as squarely as it is in this movie.  While it would be easy to suggest that the movie implies Abby is not pretty, Abby is doing that.  She is very pretty in this movie, both physically and mentally, but Brian (you got it right Brian!) is interested in her brain first.  Brian does find Abby attractive, but Abby keeps interpreting everything Brian does as fitting with her stereotype of shallow men.This movie is no more about real life than any other movie.  However, the movie shows that people who look like they could live next door to you could and should find true love, because in real life that is exactly where you find it.",5,Love for Real People,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,1821,"['Being', 'action', 'movie', 'fan', 'rarely', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'love', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'centered', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'type', 'woman', 'rarely', 'average', 'guy', 'wife', 'movie', 'stereotype', 'casting', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'animal', 'talk', 'show', 'hostess', 'Abby.Abby', 'Janeane', 'pretty', 'not', 'pretty', 'way', 'neighbor', 'Noelle', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'principal', 'stereotype', 'movie', 'obvious', 'Abby', 'intelligent', 'well-educated', 'Noelle', 'few', 'pennies', 'short', 'dollar', 'When', 'Abby', 'call', 'Brian', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'immediate', 'attraction', 'pair', 'However', 'when', 'Brian', 'Abby', 'meet', 'insecure', 'Abby', 'Noelle', 'Abby', 'insecurity', 'men', 'are', 'principally', 'interested', 'tall', 'leggy', 'blonds', 'big', 'well', 'know.As', 'movie', 'usual', 'humor', 'three', 'characters', 'keep', 'meeting', 'Abby', 'Noelle', 'attempt', 'pull', 'off', 'deception', 'Noelle', 'Abby', 'course', 'Brian', 'love', 'brain', 'not', 'body', 'eventually', 'truth', 'must', 'come', 'out', 'Enough', 'said', 'part', 'movie.The', 'question', 'beauty', 'movies', 'rarely', 'tackled', 'as', 'squarely', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'suggest', 'movie', 'implies', 'Abby', 'not', 'pretty', 'Abby', 'doing', 'very', 'pretty', 'movie', 'physically', 'mentally', 'Brian', 'got', 'right', 'Brian', 'interested', 'brain', 'first', 'Brian', 'find', 'Abby', 'attractive', 'Abby', 'interpreting', 'everything', 'Brian', 'fitting', 'stereotype', 'shallow', 'men.This', 'movie', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'other', 'movie', 'However', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'could', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'could', 'should', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'real', 'life', 'exactly', 'where', 'find']",The Truth About Cats & Dogs VHS

This is where The Truth About Cats and Dogs comes into play.  It's definitely a romantic comedy and it is cheesy, but I can't really say that it's an excellent movie.Abby is a veterinarian who has her own radio show.  After helping out a man with a dog issue, she is surprised when he asks her for a date and quips out that she is a tall blond modelish looking person.  He though, believes her and through a series of chance encounters, believes Abby to be her model friend Noelle.  Thinking he would never like her for her, Abby lets it go on, and while she really begins to like him, there is never a good time to tell him the truth.  And when Noelle starts to like him too things become complicated.Characters:Janeane Garofalo: AbbyUma Thurman: NoelleBen Chaplin: BrianAbby, if she wasn't partaking in this ruse, would be an excellent character.  She's funny, smart, and genuinely loves animals.  So it seems a little inconceivable that she would take part in this kind of switch.  But I guess they had to make the movie somehow.  Noelle I didn't care for at all.  I thought she was a little too flaky and next to the character of Abby, she didn't really have a lot of redeeming features aside from her looks.  And if we're going to be really honest, despite the film telling us different, these ladies are comprable in their looks.  So it was actually quite laughable that Abby was considered the ""ugly"" one.  I actually did like the character of Brian.  He was sweet and sensitive and seemingly the perfect man.While the story was far fetched, it was entertaining.  But it did drag on.  There's only so long that the switched concept was new and exciting and after awhile it was like, ""ok, tell him already and let's move the plot along.""  For being titled about cats and dogs too, the animals were really second in this story, it would have been nice to have them incorporated more.  And I should warn, this movie contains cussing and very light phone sex.  It's not something you'd expect from the cutesy cover.Since there's no action or anything the cinema quality of this film is pretty average.  But the picture was clear and not too bouncy.  Which is about all you can ask for in a movie like this.  And the music was soft pop.  Which is good for background music but doesn't really set any moods.This is an average romantic comedy.  It's good for mindless viewing but has a lot of flaws to make it a truly good film.Review by M.

Each day she offers her advice to pet owners on how they can better relate to their pets and have more fulfilling relationships. Though she's cute  she doesn't receive as much attention as someone who looks like her neighbor Noelle (Uma Thurman). Noelle is a model who dreams of being taken seriously as a newswoman. Abbie resents her for her power over men  and assumes she enjoys a life of relative ease. It is only after she comes to her aid after a fight with an abusive boyfriend that the two women get to know each other and become friends. Abbie needs her new best friend's help when a caller named Brian (Ben Chaplin) suggests a face to face meeting. Fearing that her looks won't be good enough she has Noelle pose as her. The ruse lasts longer than it should even though Brian has a hard time reconciling the sassy and confident radio voice with the shy and nervous person in real life. As the three start spending more time together both women fall for Brian causing a rift in their friendship. Garofalo is anything but ugly, she's pretty sexy actually. Her Abbie is quick with a put down and wonderfully sarcastic but also  vulnerable and lonely just like Noelle. Thurman starts off as a stereotypical model or dumb blonde but evolves into a more confident and independent woman. The first hour works best since after that point you know where things are headed.

403957,A16QODENBJVUI1,6304142137,Robert Moore,"[2, 3]","Every half decade or so, we get another remake of CYRANO DE BERGERAC. This one, luckily, is one of the very best. Now, I really love this movie, and have seen it with great delight on several occasions, but it is also quite disingenuous. The men who play Cyrano or the Cyrano type character are usually either unattractive or made to be quite unattractive (as in ROXANNE, where Steve Martin is given the prosthetic nose of the ages). But Janeane Garofalo is gorgeous, and has always been gorgeous. Short, perhaps (personally, I love short), and not razor thin like Uma Thurman, but absolutely no one with eyes would ever look at her and think anything but, ""Wow!"" And the cutest smile this side of Julia Roberts. So, in this sense, the movie cheats. Instead of an unattractive woman playing the Cyrano role, we have an extraordinarily cute one. It is a bit like some of Olivia de Havilland's films, in which she, a remarkably beautiful woman, is supposed to be playing a plain one.That said, this is a completely endearing light comedy. Garofalo plays a woman who does a radio pet advice show, brought into contact over the air with Ben Chaplin, whose dog has a problem. A comedy of errors ensues, as Uma Thurman pretends to be the off air shy Garofalo. Part of the delight of the film is the way the two women manage to perpetuate the misunderstanding, and the way that Chaplin and Garofalo fall in lover over the phone. This is a formula film, in that you know just about everything that is going to happen in the film from the very beginning, but the film is so fresh and innovative in bringing everything to pass, that it never feels like a formula pic.Slight correction to the editorial review. I believe that Henry the Dog is a Bull Mastiff, not a Great Dane. One of my best friends has a dog (Bella) who looks exactly like Henry, but who is most decidedly a Bull Mastiff.

403959,A359IT81FBX64Y,6304142137,Steven Mason,"[1, 4]","I'm a fan of romantic comedies, but somehow I had missed this one. I decided to watch it after I had read an interview with Janeane Garofalo, in which she mentioned that she had felt ""uncomfortable"" playing the role of the ugly duckling in this film. After watching it, I can see why she said that.Regardless of how Garofalo felt or what she said, Cats & Dogs is not a very good romantic comedy. I don't expect actors to ""like"" all the roles they play; even acting is a job, after all. It's true that Cats & Dogs can be compared to Cyrano de Bergerac, but it has none of the wit and charm of that great romantic comedy classic. It's very dumbed down, as dumb as the cliched blonde that Uma Thurman plays in her role. (I wonder if Thurman felt uncomfortable with her role as well?)I'm not saying that I didn't fall for some of the manipulative charms of this movie. In pure physical terms I find Garofalo more attractive than Thurman, so I had no problem rooting for the underdog, or undercat, in this story. I imagined, vicariously, meeting someone as pretty, smart, charming, funny, and talented as Abby (Garofalo's character). But this movie tried too hard to convince us that Abby was unattractive, made even worse by the forced and contrived contrast between the ""dumb beauty"" and the ""smart beast."" Too much of the dialogue was wasted on the cynical message that only beautiful girls can get great guys, and even that message was muddled because Thurman's character, Noelle, a model, had an abusive boyfriend (not funny!).Most romantic comedies feature at least one memorable scene. When Harry Met Sally had the restaurant scene. There's Something About Mary had the hair gel scene. Cats & Dogs has a phone sex scene. It was amusing, but it wasn't done with panache and polish. In other words, it's forgettable.I don't regret watching this movie. I'll watch anything with Garofalo, as she is one of the few actors I feel a little crush for. And no, I don't feel a crush just because she's pretty.

This movie is the exception and possibly because it makes fun of the very attributes normally touted for her roles. Quite the opposite is true about Janeane Garofalo... I've always enjoyed her acting (more so than her comedy--go figure) and have been disappointed that there weren't more films with her in a central role. So ""Truth..."" gives me a good dose of Janeane, and Uma in a form that I can enjoy. As for Ben Chaplin, he was delightful and charming, and it was nice to see a male lead who was attracted to a woman for something other than her physical attributes.As for my favorite scene (just one of the story's ""moments""), it would have to be Janeane's and Ben's walk along the beach which ended with them watching the sunset as the air turned cool. After offering her his coat and holding her to help her stay warm, you could feel the chemistry between the two, even before the truth of the situation had come out. It's a shame that films like this are so often dismissed as trivial and unimportant, when in fact, if the characters are believable and the tale is warm and kind, and unfolds in a way that's fitting for the circumstance, it's a good movie.If you like romantic comedies or films that are full of warmth and feeling (with some humor thrown in for good measure), I'd recommend this one.",5,One of the Best Films,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,1810,"['first', 'watched', 'Truth', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'VHS', 'one', 'movies', 'whenever', ""'m"", 'running', 'library', 'films', 'finger', 'have', 'take', 'out', 'watch', 'again', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'mentioned', 'rather', 'simple', 'telling', 'outcome', 'obvious', 'onset', 'However', 'story', 'so', 'full', 'moments', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'over-and-over.Oddly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'fan', 'movie', 'exception', 'possibly', 'fun', 'very', 'normally', 'touted', 'roles', 'opposite', 'true', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'more', 'so', 'comedy', 'go', 'figure', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'films', 'central', 'role', 'Truth', 'good', 'dose', 'Janeane', 'Uma', 'form', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'delightful', 'charming', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'was', 'attracted', 'woman', 'something', 'other', 'physical', 'attributes.As', 'favorite', 'scene', 'just', 'one', 'story', 'moments', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Janeane', 'Ben', 'walk', 'beach', 'ended', 'watching', 'sunset', 'air', 'turned', 'cool', 'offering', 'coat', 'holding', 'help', 'stay', 'warm', 'could', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'two', 'even', 'truth', 'situation', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'shame', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'dismissed', 'trivial', 'unimportant', 'when', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'tale', 'warm', 'kind', 'unfolds', 'way', 'fitting', 'circumstance', 'good', 'movie.If', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'films', 'are', 'full', 'warmth', 'feeling', 'humor', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'one']",The Truth About Cats & Dogs VHS

Suffice it to say that the only thing about this movie I didn't like is the fact that Garofalo's character, with her  sense of humor, grace and intellect, still lacked self-confidence.  If,  however, the intent of the screenplay was to hit home the reality that  society, though they've been advised against it for decades, is still  judging books by their covers, then I guess it makes sense.  Nevertheless,  the very concept of two intelligent adults having a seven-hour telephone  conversation has got to be the most romantic thing I've seen in a movie  containing ZERO nudity in years.",5,Profound,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,693,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Janeane', 'Garofolo', 'fan', 'begin', 'review', 'turn', 'movie', 'bit', 'biased', 'Suffice', 'say', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'Garofalo', 'character', 'sense', 'humor', 'grace', 'intellect', 'still', 'lacked', 'self-confidence', 'however', 'intent', 'screenplay', 'was', 'hit', 'home', 'reality', 'society', ""'ve"", 'been', 'advised', 'decades', 'still', 'judging', 'books', 'covers', 'then', 'guess', 'sense', 'Nevertheless', 'very', 'concept', 'two', 'intelligent', 'adults', 'having', 'seven-hour', 'telephone', 'conversation', 'got', 'be', 'most', 'romantic', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'containing', 'ZERO', 'nudity', 'years']",The Truth About Cats & Dogs VHS
