959513,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000CNF80W,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 4]","The main points of this review have been used to review Townes Van Zandt CDs in this space. They can serve here as well in this very well done documentary by Margaret Brown on the hard times and great lyrics of a very troubled man.Readers of this space are by now very aware that I am in search of and working my way through various types of American roots music. In shorthand, running through what others have termed ""The American Songbook"". Thus I have spent no little time going through the work of seemingly every musician who rates space in the august place. From blues giants, folk legends, classic rock `n' roll artists down through the second and third layers of those milieus out in the backwoods and small, hideaway music spots that dot the American musical landscape.I have also given a nod to more R&B;, rockabilly and popular song artists then one reasonably need to know about. I have, however, other than the absolutely obligatory passing nods to the likes of Hank Williams and Patsy Cline spent very ink on more traditional Country music, what used to be called the Nashville sound. What gives?Whatever my personal musical preferences there is no question that the country music work of, for example, the likes of George Jones, Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette in earlier times or Garth Brooks and Faith Hill a little later or today Keith Urban and Taylor Swift (I am cheating on these last two since I do not know their work and had to ask someone about them) ""speak"" to vast audiences out in the heartland. They just, for a number of reasons that need not be gone into here, do not ""speak"" to me. However, in the interest of ""full disclosure"" I must admit today that I had a ""country music moment"" about thirty years ago. That was the time of the ""outlaws"" of the country music scene. You know, Waylon (Jennings) and Willie (Nelson). Also Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash and Jerry Jeff Walker. Country Outlaws, get it? Guys and gals ( think of Jesse Colter)who broke from the Nashville/ Grand Old Opry mold by drinking hard, smoking plenty of dope and generally raising the kind of hell that the pious guardians of the Country Music Hall Of Fame would have had heart attacks over (at least in public). Oh, and did I say they wrote lyrics that spoke of love and longing, trouble with their ""old ladies"" (or ""old men""), and struggling to get through the day. Just an ordinary day's work in the music world but with their own outlandish twists on it.All of the above is an extremely round about way to introduce the ""max daddy"" of my 'country music moment', Townes Van Zandt. For those who the name does not ring a bell perhaps his most famous work does, the much-covered ""Pancho And Lefty"". In some ways his personal biography exemplified the then ""new outlaw"" (assuming that Hank Williams and his gang were the original ones). Chronic childhood problems, including a stint in a mental hospital, drugs, drink, and some rather ""politically incorrect"" sexual attitudes. Nothing really new here, except out of this mix came some of the most haunting lyrics of longing, loneliness, depression, sadness and despair. And that is the ""milder"" stuff. Not exactly the stuff of Nashville. That is the point. The late Townes Van Zandt ""spoke"" to me (he died in 1997) in a way that Nashville never could. And, in the end, the other outlaws couldn't either. That, my friends, is the saga of my country moment. Listen up to any of the CDs listed below for the reason why Townes did.Townes Van Zandt was, due to personal circumstances and the nature of the music industry, honored more highly among his fellow musicians than as an outright star of ""outlaw"" country music back in the day. That influence was felt through the sincerest form of flattery in the music industry- someone well known covering your song. Many of Townes' pieces, especially since his untimely death in 1997, have been covered by others, most famously Willie Nelson's cover of ""Pancho and Lefty"". However, Townes, whom I had seen a number of times in person in the late 1970's, was no mean performer of his own darkly compelling songs.",4,The Hard Times And Great Lyrics Of A Troubled Man,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,4107,"['main', 'points', 'review', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'review', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'CDs', 'space', 'can', 'serve', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'Margaret', 'Brown', 'hard', 'times', 'great', 'lyrics', 'very', 'troubled', 'man.Readers', 'space', 'are', 'now', 'very', 'aware', 'am', 'search', 'working', 'way', 'various', 'types', 'American', 'roots', 'music', 'shorthand', 'running', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'termed', 'American', 'Songbook', 'Thus', 'have', 'spent', 'little', 'time', 'going', 'work', 'seemingly', 'musician', 'who', 'rates', 'space', 'august', 'place', 'blues', 'giants', 'folk', 'legends', 'classic', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'artists', 'down', 'second', 'third', 'layers', 'milieus', 'out', 'backwoods', 'small', 'hideaway', 'music', 'spots', 'dot', 'American', 'musical', 'landscape.I', 'have', 'also', 'given', 'nod', 'more', 'R', 'B', 'rockabilly', 'popular', 'song', 'artists', 'then', 'one', 'reasonably', 'need', 'know', 'have', 'however', 'other', 'absolutely', 'obligatory', 'passing', 'nods', 'likes', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Patsy', 'Cline', 'spent', 'very', 'ink', 'more', 'traditional', 'Country', 'music', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'called', 'Nashville', 'sound', 'What', 'personal', 'musical', 'preferences', 'question', 'country', 'music', 'work', 'example', 'likes', 'George', 'Jones', 'Loretta', 'Lynn', 'Tammy', 'Wynette', 'earlier', 'times', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'Faith', 'Hill', 'little', 'later', 'today', 'Keith', 'Urban', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'am', 'cheating', 'last', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'work', 'had', 'ask', 'someone', 'speak', 'vast', 'audiences', 'out', 'heartland', 'just', 'number', 'reasons', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'gone', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'However', 'interest', 'full', 'disclosure', 'must', 'admit', 'today', 'had', 'country', 'music', 'moment', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'time', 'outlaws', 'country', 'music', 'scene', 'know', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Also', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Jerry', 'Jeff', 'Walker', 'Country', 'Outlaws', 'get', 'Guys', 'gals', 'think', 'Jesse', 'Colter', 'who', 'broke', 'Nashville/', 'Grand', 'Old', 'Opry', 'mold', 'drinking', 'hard', 'smoking', 'plenty', 'dope', 'generally', 'raising', 'kind', 'hell', 'pious', 'guardians', 'Country', 'Music', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'heart', 'attacks', 'least', 'public', 'Oh', 'did', 'say', 'wrote', 'lyrics', 'spoke', 'love', 'longing', 'trouble', 'old', 'ladies', 'old', 'men', 'struggling', 'get', 'day', 'Just', 'ordinary', 'day', 'work', 'music', 'world', 'own', 'outlandish', 'twists', 'it.All', 'above', 'extremely', 'round', 'way', 'introduce', 'max', 'daddy', ""'country"", 'music', 'moment', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'who', 'name', 'not', 'ring', 'bell', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'work', 'much-covered', 'Pancho', 'Lefty', 'ways', 'personal', 'biography', 'exemplified', 'then', 'new', 'outlaw', 'assuming', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'gang', 'were', 'original', 'ones', 'Chronic', 'childhood', 'problems', 'including', 'stint', 'mental', 'hospital', 'drugs', 'drink', 'rather', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'sexual', 'attitudes', 'Nothing', 'really', 'new', 'here', 'mix', 'came', 'most', 'haunting', 'lyrics', 'longing', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'sadness', 'despair', 'milder', 'stuff', 'Not', 'exactly', 'stuff', 'Nashville', 'point', 'late', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'spoke', 'died', '1997', 'way', 'Nashville', 'never', 'could', 'end', 'other', 'outlaws', 'could', ""n't"", 'either', 'friends', 'saga', 'country', 'moment', 'Listen', 'up', 'CDs', 'listed', 'reason', 'why', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'was', 'due', 'personal', 'circumstances', 'nature', 'music', 'industry', 'honored', 'more', 'highly', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'outright', 'star', 'outlaw', 'country', 'music', 'back', 'day', 'influence', 'was', 'felt', 'sincerest', 'form', 'flattery', 'music', 'industry-', 'someone', 'well', 'known', 'covering', 'song', 'Many', 'Townes', 'pieces', 'especially', 'untimely', 'death', '1997', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'others', 'most', 'famously', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'cover', 'Pancho', 'Lefty', 'However', 'Townes', 'whom', 'had', 'seen', 'number', 'times', 'person', 'late', '1970', 'was', 'mean', 'performer', 'own', 'darkly', 'compelling', 'songs']",Townes Van Zandt - Be Here to Love Me

His ""Pancho and Lefty"" was immortalized thanks to Willie Nelson, and singers like Nelson and Kris Kristofferson admire his songwriting. Van Zandt grew up in an ordinary, middle-class household in Texas. His struggles with depression led him to electroshock therapy, which scarred him for life. He lost all the memories he had before that.Van Zandt poured his heartbreak into powerful music. He sang from a wounded, aching place--something anyone can understand. A sad irony is that his songs often inspired people to live their lives instead of committing suicide, while he was on a downward spiral of self-destruction. Van Zandt's three wives and children reminisce about their troubled family life. Van Zandt was a genius--and a tragically troubled one.

Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[2, 2]","I think Margaret Brown [the Director of the DVD] did an excellent job on this ""Be Here To Love Me"" DVD and I honestly do 'not' feel that there is any degree of duplicity with what I would highly recommend as an equally excellent 'companion' to this DVD about Townes Van Zandt, ""Heartworn Highways."" Each DVD, IMO anyway and so stated, stands on its own with its own focus and highlights. One DVD compliments the other. IMO. Further, both DVD's contain ample special and bonus features and which are not duplicated in any way.BTW, and as a sidebar to other TVZ fans reading this, in the ""Heartworn Highways"" DVD [** filmed in 1975 but not released until 1981] and in the scene where TVZ interviews ""Uncle"" Seymour Washington and again when TVZ plays ""a medley of my hit"" [sic -- TVZ], ""Pancho and Lefty"", in 'Unc' Washington's kitchen, anyway, 'who' is that long haired girl? Just curious. She appears at least three times in the ""Heartworn Highways"" DVD but nowhere can I find who she is! Again, just curious.I highly recommend the ""Be Here To Love Me"" DVD and the copious interviews therein both in the documentary and in the bonus features. And I also recommend the 'companion' DVD, ""Heartworn Highways."" BTW and again addressing TVZ fans, and of which I am one including playing TVZ songs on the guitar, check out the TVZ website where a 3rd TVZ DVD is available [** while there are umpteen TVZ CD's available, TVZ DVD's are unfortunately rather limited!], anyway, check out the DVD ""Townes Van Zandt: Live In Amsterdam"" which is equally enjoyable. So too some excellent bios out there on TVZ. And yeah, you can always tell a true-blue TVZ fan and picking up on the ""little things"" as when they ask and ponder the 'why' of it, to wit, ""So WHY did Townes introduce himself and then ""Geraldine"" [his beloved dog] 'before' introducing his then girlfriend, ""Cindy"" ? Hey! WHY did TVZ lean backwards and fall from that apartment complex balcony! Or the ""gold tooth"" thing! Or various other ""why did he 'do' that?"" inquiries on TVZ, well, as Steve Earle or Guy Clark might quip, ""Why not!

959517,A1LFJA7HED1S5T,B000CNF80W,"B. Bowman ""Double B""","[127, 129]","I had the date for this DVD's release on my calendar for months. I had read reviews of its insights, and those combined with all the stories I heard about Townes Van Zandt over the years had me literally counting the days until I could see this documentary. I discovered Townes' music ten years ago, and as someone who plays guitar and writes songs I have always found his music to be some of the most inspiring I have ever heard. For years I have read about his legendary drinking and gambling, so I knew that this would be touched on in the film. However, I was unprepared for the sheer self destructiveness that plagued Townes Van Zandt's life. Even more disturbing to me was the senselessness of it all. I had always wondered what Townes was up to in the years from the late seventies to the late eighties, when his discography suggests that he literally disappeared. This film touches on this but never really answers the question. The film is clear that Townes began a follow up to ""The Late Great Townes Van Zandt"" which was titled ""7 Come 11"" (and should have given him the push into superstar status he deserved), and Townes' producer Kevin Eggers acknowledges that he did not release ""The Nashville Sessions"" until twenty years after it was recorded, but the exact reasons as to why were not made clear. This inexplicable failure to promote Townes Van Zandt's music is something that really bothers me, especially since it seems that he did nothing but begin a downward spiral creatively and personally from that time on. Steve Earle remembered witnessing Townes playing russian roulette on his porch in the late seventies with a .357 Magnum, and expressed his dismay and anger throughout the film at witnessing what was the world's greatest songwriter (and his hero) being so callous about his talent and his life. It seems that these ""lost years"" contributed to his decline, although one gets the sense that Townes didn't know what he was looking for or what he wanted to achieve. When questioned in an interview about what his goals were, it seems Townes had never thought about it (or didn't have any), and he struggles with the question until he answered that he would like to write a song that no one would understand, including himself. As the film nears its end, the shocking transformation of Townes into a skeletal alcoholic was especially disturbing to me, as was the obvious deterioration of his guitar skills and voice in the later live footage shown. Although Townes was definitely a complex individual and obviously a very funny man (the bonus interviews have a few stories that really cracked me up), this documentary left me feeling sad. I never realized that all these years of listening to his music had made me care so much about Townes. I guess it goes along with what Steve Earle said in the film, that it's always your heroes that let you down. Maybe it's because you find out that they are human beings with faults just like everyone else, but Townes Van Zandt had a gift for music that not many possess, and I'm sorry that his demons took him so early.",5,Your Heroes Always Let You Down...,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,3087,"['had', 'date', 'DVD', 'release', 'calendar', 'months', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'insights', 'combined', 'stories', 'heard', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'years', 'had', 'literally', 'counting', 'days', 'could', 'see', 'documentary', 'discovered', 'Townes', 'music', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'someone', 'who', 'guitar', 'songs', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'music', 'be', 'most', 'inspiring', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'years', 'have', 'read', 'legendary', 'drinking', 'gambling', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'touched', 'film', 'However', 'was', 'unprepared', 'sheer', 'self', 'destructiveness', 'plagued', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'life', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'was', 'senselessness', 'had', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'Townes', 'was', 'up', 'years', 'late', 'seventies', 'late', 'eighties', 'when', 'discography', 'literally', 'disappeared', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'question', 'film', 'clear', 'Townes', 'began', 'follow', 'up', 'Late', 'Great', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'was', 'titled', '7', 'Come', '11', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'push', 'superstar', 'status', 'deserved', 'Townes', 'producer', 'Kevin', 'Eggers', 'did', 'not', 'release', 'Nashville', 'Sessions', 'twenty', 'years', 'was', 'recorded', 'exact', 'reasons', 'why', 'were', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'inexplicable', 'failure', 'promote', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'music', 'something', 'really', 'especially', 'did', 'nothing', 'begin', 'downward', 'spiral', 'creatively', 'personally', 'time', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'remembered', 'witnessing', 'Townes', 'playing', 'russian', 'roulette', 'porch', 'late', 'seventies', '.357', 'Magnum', 'expressed', 'dismay', 'anger', 'film', 'witnessing', 'was', 'world', 'greatest', 'songwriter', 'hero', 'being', 'so', 'callous', 'talent', 'life', 'lost', 'years', 'contributed', 'decline', 'one', 'sense', 'Townes', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'what', 'wanted', 'achieve', 'When', 'questioned', 'interview', 'what', 'goals', 'were', 'Townes', 'had', 'never', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'question', 'answered', 'would', 'like', 'write', 'song', 'one', 'would', 'understand', 'including', 'film', 'end', 'shocking', 'transformation', 'Townes', 'skeletal', 'alcoholic', 'was', 'especially', 'disturbing', 'was', 'obvious', 'deterioration', 'guitar', 'skills', 'voice', 'later', 'live', 'footage', 'shown', 'Townes', 'was', 'definitely', 'complex', 'individual', 'obviously', 'very', 'funny', 'man', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'have', 'few', 'stories', 'really', 'cracked', 'up', 'documentary', 'left', 'feeling', 'sad', 'never', 'realized', 'years', 'listening', 'music', 'had', 'made', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'Townes', 'guess', 'along', 'what', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'said', 'film', 'always', 'heroes', 'let', 'down', 'Maybe', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'faults', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'Townes', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'had', 'gift', 'music', 'not', 'many', 'possess', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'demons', 'took', 'so', 'early']",Townes Van Zandt - Be Here to Love Me

He played a guitar and sang his songs, although the best-known versions of the songs are by others: Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Emmylou Harris to name a few. The songs ""Tecumseh Valley, Poncho and Lefty, If I Needed You, and Waiting Around to to Die"" are as good as any you'll find.  Steve Earle, another Texas singer/songwriter, said TVZ was the greatest songwriter in the world.This documentary features TVZ singing many of his songs while we witness his deterioration.  He died at age 52 of complications following a broken hip and (probably) an overdose of alcohol.  Nobody was suprised.  Guy Clark says at his funeral that he ""booked this gig 30 years ago.""  TVZ never made any money nor sold many records, but it's a pretty good guess that people will be singing his songs for the next 100  years.  They're that good.Among the people talking about TVZ in this film are his wives (three), children, and a host of other singers: Kris Kristofferson, Willie, Emmylou, Clark, Earle, and a bunch more.  It's a touching and a frightening story.

Though he was held in great esteem by critics and his fellow musicians, Van Zandt's music did not sell well. Moreover, he had a tragic personal life that led to his death in 1997.Van Zandt has gotten his belated due. Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Emmylou Harris have taken Van Zandt's songs to the top of the charts. Now, filmmaker Margaret Brown continues this renaissance with her biographical documentary ""Be Here to Love Me.""Brown provides viewers with an excellent overview of Van Zandt's music and life. Viewers hear well-known musicians express their admiration for Van Zandt. The film also helps explain why Van Zandt struggled to find commercial success. (Often, he sabotaged his own career).The best parts of the film delve into Van Zandt's complex personality. Van Zandt was an unhappy person who was married three times, underwent shock treatments, and descended into alcoholism. In one graphic scene, Steve Earle explains how he saw Van Zandt play Russian roulette.It is best to look at this film as an introduction to Van Zandt. 100 minutes simply isn't enough time to explain fully the issues that the film raises.

The documentary is formed out of archival footage, as well as recent interviews with his surviving contemporaries and collaborators. Born into money, but an infamous substance abuser who had most of his teeth replaced after a glue sniffing incident, he lived in the gutter, sang, wrote music, and left a trail of destruction. At the end are interviews with his kids, some of whom hardly knew him.First of all, Joe Ely, who was a musical partner from the very start, is interviewed, talking about alone-ness versus loneliness, broke versus poor, and how Townes was always the better, more Zen-like of the two. Guy Clark noted how Townes' songs ""are sparse, they don't spell everything out for you. They allow you to use your imagination and allow you to be sucked in."" He also had a great sense of humor, as demonstrated with one show where he said ""I'll now play a medley of my hit.""Townes got into glue sniffin' while playing high school football, and signed in his yearbook ""from one junky to another."" Recounts the story of intentionally falling from his fourth floor apartment onto his back just to feel the sensation. Fran Lohr, his first wife, talks about their life together. He got ""insulin shock"" to the point where he couldn't recognise his own mother. Burned out his childhood memories. Plays a beautiful version of ""Dollar Bill Blues"" live without whatever noise it was that they added to the recording. First song he wrote was ""Waitin' Around To Die."" Townes and Janis Joplin hangin' out. Ken Eggers, record producer, Tomato Records owner in Chelsea Hotel. Wrecks Bell, bass player, spoke of Townes' fame after the Our Mother The Mountain. Lightnin' Hopkins interviewed. David Olney - ""a woman ripped off her blouse at the start of the set."" JT Van Zandt looks like Townes, but with a cleft chin. Steve Earle, Burt and Susanna Clark. Townes ""admired"" Susanna, and she looked like a pretty funky person when she was young. Professor Longhair also interviewed in movie. Guy was jealous of Townes - on camera he's laughing, but you can tell he's also angry. Was into heroin in Houston, never into it when he was elsewhere because he wouldn't know where to get it (probably a good thing too). They interview him about glue sniffing while someone else fires off shotgun blasts, he then tells the story of being DOA for 90 minutes before he came back to life. He was heart dead every 2-3 months. Weed made him neurotic, alcohol psychotic. Peggy Underwood, lawyer, saw him shoot cola and bourbon. Played ""Waiting Around To Die"", an old black man next to him was in tears. Katie Bell Van Zandt, daughter, interviewed in Nashville in 2002. A French interviewer tells him ""Blues is happy music"", he answers ""oh yes, I agree."" ""Gold And Mud"" from a TV in a Texas bar, re-creating his life and sensibilities, hanging around in bars waiting to die... Steve Earle found a nice cabin for him, learned that he was fascinated with morning glories. Townes put Steve's gun to his head, pulled trigger three times. Steve was pissed!! Townes wrote ""If I Needed You"" in his sleep - dreamed he was singing it, wrote it down when he woke up. Jeanene Van Zandt, third wife. Steve Shelly, the drummer of Sonic Youth, is on hand to tell the tales of Townes' death. Lyle Lovett sings ""Flyin"" Shoes"" at Townes' funeral.
