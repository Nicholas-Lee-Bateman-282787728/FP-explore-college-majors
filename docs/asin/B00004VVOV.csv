552931,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00004VVOV,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[59, 61]","This film is an excellent telling of Jeremiah's life, and although time has been compressed, and some fictitious characters added to fill out the scenario, the heart of this part of biblical history is intact, and follows the accounts given in The Book of Jeremiah, II Kings 23-25, and II Chronicles 34-36.Some of the additions: The lovely &quot;Judith&quot; (Lenor Varela) as an early love interest, and &quot;General Safan&quot;, played by that lionesque man, Oliver Reed, as one of Jeremiah's adversaries, and someone who consistently gives bad advice to the king.Among the omissions: Jeremiah's good years, when he was a friend and confidant to the devout King Josiah, which ended in 609 B.C. with the Josiah's death.Jeremiah was older when most of the events that take place in this film occur, and had been ministering since 627 B.C.The film starts with the finding the scriptures, which King Josiah reads to the people, and a young Jeremiah, &quot;I cannot speak, for I am only a youth&quot; (Jer. 1:6).Sixteen years elapse, and in some of the following scenes, Jehoiakim (Josiah's son) is king, and the constant and brutal persecution of Jeremiah begins.Patrick Dempsey is wonderful as Jeremiah, and also Stuart Bunce as his faithful scribe Baruch (it is Baruch who in all probability recorded The Book of Jeremiah).Enter Nebuchadnezzar, played with gusto by Klaus Maria Brandauer. This is one nasty guy, but he is the instrument to complete Jeremiah's prophesies, with his armies sacking and burning the temple (in 586 B.C.) and the ensuing famine in the land. Nebuchadnezzar takes Jehoiakim's son and succesor Jehoiachin captive, and and places his uncle Zedekiah (formerly known as Mattaniah) as king.The final 10 minutes of this film are riveting, with King Zedekiah's fate brilliantly depicted (literaly taken from II Kings 25:7), and Jeremiah's story, though a sad one, is one of faith and perseverance, and well worth watching.Most of the films in this series are terrific, and have beautiful cinematography by Raffaele Mertes; they are set in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its rugged landscape and ancient structures. A good score by Bruce Broughton adds to the atmosphere, and it's well directed and written (with a fair portion taken from the scriptures) by Harry Winer.",5,"&quot;Behold, I have put My words in your mouth&quot;",1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,2284,"['film', 'excellent', 'telling', 'Jeremiah', 'life', 'time', 'been', 'compressed', 'fictitious', 'characters', 'added', 'fill', 'out', 'scenario', 'heart', 'part', 'biblical', 'history', 'intact', 'accounts', 'given', 'Book', 'Jeremiah', 'II', 'Kings', '23-25', 'II', 'Chronicles', '34-36.Some', 'additions', 'lovely', 'quot', 'Judith', 'quot', 'Lenor', 'Varela', 'early', 'love', 'interest', 'quot', 'General', 'Safan', 'quot', 'played', 'lionesque', 'man', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'one', 'Jeremiah', 'adversaries', 'someone', 'who', 'consistently', 'bad', 'advice', 'king.Among', 'omissions', 'Jeremiah', 'good', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'friend', 'confidant', 'devout', 'King', 'Josiah', 'ended', '609', 'B.C', 'Josiah', 'death.Jeremiah', 'was', 'older', 'when', 'most', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'film', 'occur', 'had', 'been', 'ministering', '627', 'B.C.The', 'film', 'finding', 'scriptures', 'King', 'Josiah', 'people', 'young', 'Jeremiah', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'am', 'only', 'youth', 'quot', 'Jer', '1:6', '.Sixteen', 'years', 'elapse', 'following', 'scenes', 'Jehoiakim', 'Josiah', 'son', 'king', 'constant', 'brutal', 'persecution', 'Jeremiah', 'begins.Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'wonderful', 'Jeremiah', 'also', 'Stuart', 'Bunce', 'faithful', 'scribe', 'Baruch', 'Baruch', 'who', 'probability', 'recorded', 'Book', 'Jeremiah', '.Enter', 'Nebuchadnezzar', 'played', 'gusto', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'one', 'nasty', 'guy', 'instrument', 'complete', 'Jeremiah', 'prophesies', 'armies', 'sacking', 'burning', 'temple', '586', 'B.C', 'ensuing', 'famine', 'land', 'Nebuchadnezzar', 'Jehoiakim', 'son', 'succesor', 'Jehoiachin', 'captive', 'uncle', 'Zedekiah', 'formerly', 'known', 'Mattaniah', 'king.The', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'riveting', 'King', 'Zedekiah', 'fate', 'brilliantly', 'depicted', 'literaly', 'taken', 'II', 'Kings', '25:7', 'Jeremiah', 'story', 'sad', 'one', 'one', 'faith', 'perseverance', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.Most', 'films', 'series', 'are', 'terrific', 'have', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Raffaele', 'Mertes', 'are', 'set', 'Quarzazate', 'Morocco', 'rugged', 'landscape', 'ancient', 'structures', 'good', 'score', 'Bruce', 'Broughton', 'atmosphere', 'well', 'directed', 'written', 'fair', 'portion', 'taken', 'scriptures', 'Harry', 'Winer']",The Bible - Jeremiah VHS

The scene where Jeremiah, who at the start of his priestly ministry, prophesied to the assembled worshippers and the dissolute King was one of the most profound I have seen. Patrick Dempsey is well cast for his role as the unflinching prophet who contends with spirital apostasy, political intrigue and the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. (One can only speculate, but I would dearly like to see a film made by Lube about Elijah!). This film is a worthy addition to the video library of anyone who likes Biblical dramas.

They weren't always old. This is the story of the 'young' Prophet Jeremiah at the time he hears God's call to warn about the pending destruction of Jerusalem. I've always thought of Jeremiah as 'the Prophet of Doom', and he was. He also had a personal life. When God told him not to marry and have children, it doesn't seem like much of a sacrifice when you are reading the words. When you think about Jeremiah as a real flesh and blood person though, it takes on a whole new meaning.

552937,ADES8B01WRPI3,B00004VVOV,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[15, 16]","Patrick Dempsey turns in a perfect performance as the title character in JEREMIAH. He plays a humble prophet of God among the rebellious Israelites, as they are being taken over by Babylon, as punishment for turning away from God and living as they each saw fit, NOT as God had commanded them to live!Jeremiah is chosen as a child to be the Lord's Prophet. He is disowned by his family and his countrymen for proclaiming what God tells him to say to the Israelites, but they can't silence Jeremiah because everything God tells him to say comes true!The scribe named Baruch is his only friend during his persecuted mission. (BTW: in the Apocraphy Books of the Bible, Baruch has HIS own book named after Baruch).Jeremiah's message is basically that the Israelites have sinned greatly and constantly against God, they have rejected repeated warnings from God's Prophets, and as punishment they are going to be exiled to Babylon, losing their own nation, except for a tiny remnant of impoverished citizens who are too lowly for even the Babylonian captors to want to bother kidnapping and taking back to Babylon.Jeremiah is one of the longer books of the Bible, in the category of Major Prophets. The Bible covers a much longer stretch of Jeremiah's life, from childhood until old age. This film condenses the major points of the Bible book into his childhood and up until around age 30-ish. They hit all the themes of the Bible book, but have compacted the jist of the Scriptures about Jeremiah into a compact film of about 90 minutes.The main difference from Scripture is in that this film adds a fictional character, a girlfriend, who is NOT in the Bible; but they use her character to explain the plight of the Jews in that day, while the shadow of Babylon approaches. The Bible DOES say that Jeremiah shall not marry and have a family, and this movie does not contradict that Scripture! The actress playing the girlfriend does a good job, and she's not in the film much, so I can easily forgive the filmmakers for adding her.This movie is also sold in a pack, THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, (which also includes the equally good DVD movies of ESTHER and SOLOMON). Search for it on amazon.com. It is about 50% cheaper to buy all three movies at once, for less than $10 per disk, than to buy them separately.

The quotes from the book of Jeremiah were very inspiring and certainly moved me.The confrontations between Jeremiah and the people he was supposed to deliver God's message to were realistically acted out and awe inspiring as well. The boldness and courage was extraordinary.Editing was done quite well. Continuity was good.The only thing I am not convinced it did happened were the scenes where Jeremiah and Edith were hugging and kissing each other . I doubt that would have happened considering the strictness of the Old Testament laws and the culture of that time.Overall, it is still a good and biblical movie. The story reminds of the current state of affairs here in the United States. There is a strong parallel here in the US where, at the national level, we are doing a lot of things that are sinful and against God yet more and more people are executing these sinful acts. When a nation turn from their godly ways towards sinful ways, God will not stand aside but will judge that nation.

552951,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B00004VVOV,Israel Drazin,"[2, 3]","This is a good dramatic film that accurately presents the life and message of the late seventh and early sixth century biblical prophet Jeremiah with some fair imaginative additions. I say this as a man who has written more than a dozen books on the Bible. It is true, as many reviewers noted, that there is no indication in the biblical book, for example, about Jeremiah&#8217;s love life, but people may speculate, as long as they recognize that it is speculation, what the Bible meant when it states that God told Jeremiah not to marry.It is the biblical style in many biblical books to make obscure or ambiguous statements, and leave it to readers to imagine what occurred. For example, right at the beginning of the Bible, Genesis 4:8 reports, &#8220;Cain said to his brother Abel,&#8221; but it does not reveal what he said. The sentence finishes instead by saying Cain killed Abel. It leaves it to the readers imagination what Cain said and what provoked him to slay his brother. So, too, with Jeremiah. The Bible says God told him not to marry, and the film makers speculate that he wanted to do so, but then felt he had to devote himself to his mission.People wanting to know more about Jeremiah, the book and the man&#8217;s mission, may want to also read Jeremiah by Rabbi Dr. Binyamin Lau. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to understand Jeremiah&#8217;s life, thinking, and writings without reading this book by this highly respected and articulate Orthodox rabbi with a PhD. This is primarily due to the fact that the book Jeremiah is not composed in chronological order. Lau narrates and explains Jeremiah&#8217;s life and reveals his concerns and messages to the people of his time and to their kings as it actually happened, not in the order currently in his book. For example, the chronological order for the start of Jeremiah&#8217;s life and messages is: chapters 1, 3, 31, verses 23:1-8, chapters 30, 2, 10, 17, 11, 18, 3. The order of the end is: chapters 42, 43, 44, 52.",5,An excellent and correct portrayal of Jeremiah with some fair immaginative additions,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,2003,"['good', 'dramatic', 'film', 'accurately', 'life', 'message', 'late', 'seventh', 'early', 'sixth', 'century', 'biblical', 'prophet', 'Jeremiah', 'fair', 'imaginative', 'additions', 'say', 'man', 'who', 'written', 'more', 'dozen', 'books', 'Bible', 'true', 'many', 'reviewers', 'noted', 'indication', 'biblical', 'book', 'example', 'Jeremiah', '8217', 's', 'life', 'people', 'may', 'speculate', 'as', 'long', 'recognize', 'speculation', 'what', 'Bible', 'meant', 'when', 'God', 'told', 'Jeremiah', 'not', 'marry.It', 'biblical', 'style', 'many', 'biblical', 'books', 'make', 'obscure', 'ambiguous', 'statements', 'leave', 'readers', 'imagine', 'what', 'occurred', 'example', 'right', 'beginning', 'Bible', 'Genesis', '4:8', 'reports', '8220', 'Cain', 'said', 'brother', 'Abel', '8221', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'said', 'sentence', 'finishes', 'instead', 'saying', 'Cain', 'killed', 'Abel', 'readers', 'imagination', 'what', 'Cain', 'said', 'what', 'provoked', 'slay', 'brother', 'So', 'too', 'Jeremiah', 'Bible', 'God', 'told', 'not', 'marry', 'film', 'makers', 'speculate', 'wanted', 'do', 'so', 'then', 'felt', 'had', 'devote', 'mission.People', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'Jeremiah', 'book', 'man', '8217', 'mission', 'may', 'want', 'also', 'read', 'Jeremiah', 'Rabbi', 'Dr.', 'Binyamin', 'Lau', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'understand', 'Jeremiah', '8217', 's', 'life', 'thinking', 'writings', 'reading', 'book', 'highly', 'respected', 'articulate', 'Orthodox', 'rabbi', 'PhD', 'primarily', 'due', 'fact', 'book', 'Jeremiah', 'not', 'composed', 'chronological', 'order', 'Lau', 'narrates', 'Jeremiah', '8217', 's', 'life', 'reveals', 'concerns', 'messages', 'people', 'time', 'kings', 'actually', 'happened', 'not', 'order', 'currently', 'book', 'example', 'chronological', 'order', 'start', 'Jeremiah', '8217', 's', 'life', 'messages', 'chapters', '1', '3', '31', '23:1-8', 'chapters', '30', '2', '10', '17', '11', '18', '3', 'order', 'end', 'chapters', '42', '43', '44', '52']",The Bible - Jeremiah VHS
552952,A1AQNC3ISXI3Z0,B00004VVOV,"James D. ""Scienceguy""","[39, 39]","This film demonstrates the tremendous power movies have to inspire and instruct.  The production team of Jeremiah did an excellent job of taking a 52 chapter book of the Bible and condensing it accurately to film.  The dialogue is Scriptural, creative, and inspiring.  The acting is superb.  The sets, costumes, and effects are all realistic.  But what sets this film apart from other Biblical stories on film is that while some liberties were taken with characters and dialogue, they were both believable and in-line with Scripture.  One example ? The character of &quot;Judith&quot;.  Basically, this young woman is the wife-to-be of Jeremiah.  They have a tender relationship, share some adventures together, but never marry.  Why ?  In the book of Jeremiah, God tells him that he will never marry because of the terrible wrath and destruction the Babylonian armies will bring upon Israel.  In creating this character, the writers make the audience feel the pain and devastation such an unction from God would bring--far more than if he had no romantic ties whatsoever.  But Judith represents even more.  In creating this character, the writers brought to life a living metaphor for all good and lovely things God wanted to give His people to enjoy in their lives--had they been faithful to His commandments.  Without this faithfulness to God, He could not bless them with all the good things He loves to bring upon His people.  This is just one example of a 'liberty' the writers took that, contrary to most uses of this, greatly enhanced the characters and enriched the story.

From the previews of this video, I see that Trimark has made movies of Genesis, Esther, Solomon, Jeremiah, and Jesus.

The book in the Bible deals more with the prophecies from God that Jeremiah told the people of Israel.  We get very little about the man.  In the movie, however, the writers have given him more of a background.  They also provide him with a love interest, and we also see some of his childhood.  He also has a couple of helpers including a scribe and a eunuch.Although I would rather they keep to the Bible, I don't think this background hurts the film.

I look forward to watching the other films in the box set, which like Jeremiah can also be bought as separate DVD's.The actor chosen to portray Jeremiah is much younger than I had imagined from the reading the text, but Patrick Dempsey does a very fine job in the complex role.  The Bible is not a gentle book, and Jeremiah's life was full of violence and death, as he begged first King Jehoiaim and his successor King Zedekiah to repent to the Lord and put a stop to false idol worship. When he conveyed the Lords message (and he was just the messenger) to that the Babylonians would conquer Jerusalem and they should surrender since it was God's will, he was branded a traitor. While not mentioned in the Bible, even his own father, a high priest, turned against him.  The reluctant prophet is dragged behind a horse, beaten mercilessly, imprisoned, thrown into a muddy cistern and left to die, starved, imprisoned and beaten again,... all for conveying a message that fell on deaf ears.Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian King is riveting, and his brief screen appearances convey the power he had at his command. Oliver Reed plays the general who insists on opposing the Babylonians.The locations chosen to shoot are spectacular, very believable. The sets and costumes are well done. Jeremiah is a very tough book to put on film, and I believe the filmmakers did a commendable job of making into a feature that would flow in a story fashion, while being mostly faithful to the text.  It is a movie after all, and all books translated to movies are changed, but nothing that offends in this case.

The young Jeremiah is born into the order of the priesthood, and his faith and tradition become the cornerstone of his existence during this renaissance of sorts.  However, 16 years later the adult Jeremiah receives a Word from God that nobody wants to hear - that the sins and excesses of Judah are going to lead to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the people will be led into bondage.  Does he have the faith and strength to deliver the Word, facing ostracism from his family, tragic separation from the woman he loves, and persecution for treason?Some license has been taken to add some characters and give some depth to Jeremiah's character - a tack which can lead movie versions of bible stories into rough water - however with Patrick Dempsey as Jeremiah, the effect here is to bring out a real sense of the humanity of the prophet, making the sense of sacrifice relevant and believable.  However, the gentle looking man does not flinch from forcefully speaking the Word when it is needed - watch out for the flying spittle!  The weak King Zedekiah is also well portrayed and a few starry cameos are welcome - Oliver Reed in fine form, and Klaus Maria Brandauer oddly believable as the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, despite that resolutely European accent.The Bible series always seems to have tackled the subject of God speaking in a sensitive way, and the manner in which He speaks here is done very effectively, portraying how surreal and powerful the moment is while avoiding the `Booming American Voice clich&eacute; of so many movies.  The scene in which Jeremiah first acts as God's voice piece is particularly well done.Taking into account some crisp and colourful photography and reasonable production values given the TV budget, it's a valiant attempt at a rarely told story - of course, it's not as good as the book it's based on.

The film is well-directed, has an excellent script, good actors, and high production values, and Patrick Dempsey brings to life one of the most thrilling scenes from the entire ""Bible"" series when he prophesies for the first time in front of Solomon's Temple. I loved the scenes where God speaks to Jeremiah as a very angelic little girl and wise elderly man, and I loved the special effects that were used during the scenes where God comes to Jeremiah in his dreams and in his daily life.  They were very effective, well-done, and tasteful.It is so inspiring to see how the Prophet Jeremiah persevered in the face of such a tremendous onslaught of evil.  He dared to say things that were extremely unpopular but seared with the Divine Fire of God's Righteousness!  The film speaks with profound wisdom to people living in our own times of rebellion against the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost!  Jeremiah lived in a time of rampant rebellion against God's laws and standards and the punishment that was inflicted upon the Israelites of the Kingdom of Judah for their disobedience was very severe but was necessary and tempered with God's Perfect Love!  We must be willing to be like Jeremiah and say the Truth even if the world will hate us and despise us for it.  God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow, and is not going to change to suit the ephemeral tastes of the modern world, which cares more about instant gratification, sensual pleasure and cheap comfort, rather than the Eternal, Perfect Love, Peace, and Righteousness of Our Perfect Lord! Our western societies cannot continue to live with such a disrespectful attitude towards God and not expect a similarly severe chastisement from Our Heavenly Father!  I love you, Saint Jeremiah.

552981,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00004VVOV,The Mysterious Traveler,"[14, 23]","JEREMIAH(199 Directed and Written by Harry Winer. Score by Bruce Broughton. Based on THE BIBLE by God.Starring Patrick Dempsey(as Jerimiah), Stuart Bunce(as Baruch), Vincent Regan (as King Zedikiah), Oliver Reed and Klaus Maria Brandauer as King Nebuchadnezzer.The story of the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah and the exile of the Jewish people by the Babylonians and the failed attempts by the prophet Jerimiah to first forestall it and then herald it so that some lives might be saved.Though seperated by decades of time and technology, a film that is not all that different from early 50s film THE SINS OF JEZEBEL in its mistakes and problems.Aesthetically the picture is hopeless with production values inadequate to a subject that must either be done as a full scale epic or a British masterpiece theater type of in the throne room melodrama. The film instead opts to have it both ways and ends up looking like an episode of XENA WARRIOR PRINCESS. It makes the serious modern film era mistake of assuming everything in the past was filthy and cheap looking and that as ruins look today so they looked 3,000 years ago. So the mighty cities of Jerusalem and Babylon look little bigger than the average suburban mall. The temple of Solomon is about the size of a MacDonalds. The powerful Babylonian army is about twenty men, two high school play siege engines and a fellow with an umbrella(to keep the sun off Nebuchadnezzer). The populations of both cities seem to be about thirty or so with tight narrow streets and throne rooms that would be good for a cheap bar mitzphah but hardly indicative of the glory and power of kingdoms and empires.Thesipically the film is mostly wretched. Most of the younger actors--Dempsey on down---besides being hopelessly modern and inadequate to their parts also tend to act like hysterical homosexuals who have just had their appointments at the beauty parlor cancelled. Oliver Stone's ALEXANDER took this tact as well. I am unsure if this is some attempt to subvert the material and so render it camp or if this is some terrible artistic mistake within the modern acting community. Oliver Reed appears either hung over or disgusted. Only Brandauer appears to be getting into the spirit of the thing.Scriptually the film, while following the story reasonably closely, is a ham fisted stumbling hesitant mistake. Beside dialogue anachronistically modern, the film's sense of history is shallow and confused---beginning with the reign of King Josiah and ending with Jerimiah standing before the ruins of the temple 20 years later. In between is jammed so much history that the script must resort to having characters start blurting out exposition as if they are on the verge of vomiting and they need to speak quickly. There is a ludicrous subplot with Jerimiah's (fictitious) girlfriend and the film opts to make Jerimiah's main nemesis a tired stereotypical( and ficticious) military man rather than King Zedikiah's courtiers and priests as in the Bible. The script's handling of God and his prophecies is so watered down and timid as to render them nonexistent dramatically. The Lord's fury at Israel at this time is a palpable thing in the Bible and his prophecies of what he intends make for harrowing reading yet the film is about a prophet who hardly has a chance to actually make prophecies and those he does are watered down and generalized.Fatally to the film is the script's utter unwillingness to address just why the Lord was bringing down destruction upon the Jews. Again and again this section of the Bible states repeatedly and clearly that the Lord was furious over the Jew's embrace of pagan practices including blasphemy in the Great Temple itself as well as committing child sacrifice and immolation. Everything else was negotiable and open to forgiveness but it was THIS that resolved the Lord to unleash the Babylonians. The film mentions it as it must but downplays it so much that the viewer, unfamiliar with the history, will find the Lord's actions and thus the entire film inexplicable. The film tries, instead, to show Jersusalem's other sins as provoking the Lord's wrath. In one brief scene, the viewer is shown A...count her...prostitute and A..count him... man whipping his donkey so obviously Jerusalem is beyond redemption and must be destroyed.Not terrible but a complete failure as a film indicating that the Modern artistic community is either unable or unwilling to do the types of films made with ease and style in the 50s/60s that they, in turn, mock for being silly and hokey.And this is the modern filmmaker's riposte???Where is Victor Mature when you need him??",1,What happens when a community of Anti-Christian bigots and atheists try and make a

552982,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B00004VVOV,Utah Blaine,"[3, 3]","This made for TV movie does a wonderful job of translating the Old Testament book of Jeremiah to the screen.  This is the last in a series of TV movies on various Old Testament books, and is probably the best of a great series.  There are several things that struck me about this movie that I would like to share with potential buyers.  First, and very importantly, this story sticks very close to the biblical text.  It is a `minimalist' retelling of Jeremiah, there is little or no denominational `spin' on this story.  It will be of interest to a wide range of Christian (and Jewish) believers.  Second, this movie is just filled with wonderfully inspirational Biblical messages.  The most fundamental is, of course, have faith in God, but this film examines issues of faith, submitting to God's will, and a host of others.  Truly thought provoking for any Christian.  Third, the acting, at least by the main characters, is quite well done.  Fourth, the sets are fantastic.  This was filmed I believe in Morocco, not in Jerusalem or anywhere else in Palestine, but the whole movie has a `Biblical' feel to it.  If I had any negative complaint about the film, it would be that the performances of many (most?) of the supporting actors and actress was poor.  They seemed stiff and not really interested in participating in the action.  A (very) minor quibble though.  A well written, well acted inspirational film that I highly recommend.",5,Biblically Accurate and Wonderfully Inspirational - Highly Recommended,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1439,"['made', 'TV', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'job', 'translating', 'Old', 'Testament', 'book', 'Jeremiah', 'screen', 'last', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'various', 'Old', 'Testament', 'books', 'probably', 'best', 'great', 'series', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'struck', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'potential', 'buyers', 'First', 'very', 'importantly', 'story', 'very', 'close', 'biblical', 'text', 'minimalist', 'retelling', 'Jeremiah', 'little', 'denominational', 'spin', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'wide', 'range', 'Christian', 'Jewish', 'believers', 'Second', 'movie', 'just', 'filled', 'wonderfully', 'inspirational', 'Biblical', 'messages', 'most', 'fundamental', 'course', 'have', 'faith', 'God', 'film', 'issues', 'faith', 'submitting', 'God', 'will', 'host', 'others', 'Truly', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Christian', 'Third', 'acting', 'least', 'main', 'characters', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'Fourth', 'sets', 'are', 'fantastic', 'was', 'filmed', 'believe', 'Morocco', 'not', 'Jerusalem', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Palestine', 'whole', 'movie', 'Biblical', 'feel', 'had', 'negative', 'complaint', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'performances', 'many', 'most', 'supporting', 'actors', 'actress', 'was', 'poor', 'seemed', 'stiff', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'participating', 'action', 'A', 'very', 'minor', 'quibble', 'though', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'inspirational', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Bible - Jeremiah VHS
