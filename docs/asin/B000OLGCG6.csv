Also, Manny is bilingual in English and Spanish so the young viewers can learn about the Hispanic culture. Although it has one interactive game and a few Disney sneak peeks, Handy Manny: Tooling Around is still a great Disney DVD to watch with pre-schoolers. :)",5,Here Is Disney's Favourite Home Improvement Expert!,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,583,"['Handy', 'Manny', 'Tooling', 'Around', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'based', 'Disney', 'Junior', 'original', 'series', 'Mexican-American', 'carpenter', 'named', 'Manny', 'Garcia', 'voiced', 'Wilmer', 'Valderama', 'Fez', 'That', '70', 'Show', 'team', 'talking', 'tools', 'help', 'out', 'friends', 'home', 'improvement', 'challenges', 'town', 'Sheetrock', 'Falls', 'Also', 'Manny', 'bilingual', 'English', 'Spanish', 'young', 'viewers', 'can', 'learn', 'Hispanic', 'culture', 'one', 'interactive', 'game', 'few', 'Disney', 'sneak', 'peeks', 'Handy', 'Manny', 'Tooling', 'Around', 'still', 'great', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'watch', 'pre-schoolers']",Handy Manny - Tooling Around

When folks need help, there's one person in town who always gets the call--Handy Manny, the best handyman around. At a moment's notice, Manny Garcia is ready to help. Whatever the job--erecting a new flagpole, fixing a broken trophy or repairing stairs--Manny gets it done with the help of his trusty set of mismatched, talking tools, who just love to put in their two cent's worth!When you're Tooling Around with Manny and his boisterous bunch of tools, you'll find messages of teamwork, friendship and community."" -- From the DVD backingMy son's a bit older than the probably target age range for Handy Manny, but he still enjoys the colorful animation and crazy antics of Manny, tools and the citizens of Sheetrock Hills (I think it's hilarious how Mr. Loport's comb-over is always getting flipped!)This particular DVD has a 55 minute run-time and features these five episodes:1. Squeeze's Day Off (The only never-before-seen episode)2. Amigo Grande3. A Sticky Fix4. Pat the Screwdriver5. SupremoguyThere are two games: ""Build it with Handy Manny"" and ""Set-Top Game"".If your kids like Bob Builder--or even Dora the Explorer--they'll likely love this DVD!

1064646,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B000OLGCG6,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[6, 8]","My son is only five months and started watching (or rather looked toward the TV screen) Handy Manny at four months. While he might not understand the message the show brings he certainly loves the colors and shapes of the CG animation. I know this is a show I will want him to watch as he gets older and starts understanding words and the world around him.Why this show? Because it displays some very good values without being preachy. Teamwork, honesty, integrity, and work ethic (not to mention a little spanish). Not to be all socio-political, but it also shows how to respect people of all social and economic classes. It's a very well written show for a young children's show, and I don't mean deep character development or anything like that. More like the pacing of the show is smooth with very few hiccups to move the simple story along.The computer animation has a softer tone to it that makes me wonder if they were using some cell shading to give it the ""cartoon"" look and feel. Either way it's easy on the eyes. It looks like this DVD will have three episodes of the show plus a bonus, never before seen episode (Sweeze's Day off). Not much else besides and interactive game, but then again most parents get these DVDs to occupy their kid's time with the show, not the special features.",5,Excellent show for toddlers,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,1298,"['son', 'only', 'five', 'months', 'started', 'watching', 'rather', 'looked', 'TV', 'screen', 'Handy', 'Manny', 'four', 'months', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'message', 'show', 'certainly', 'colors', 'shapes', 'CG', 'animation', 'know', 'show', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'older', 'understanding', 'words', 'world', 'around', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'values', 'being', 'preachy', 'Teamwork', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'work', 'ethic', 'not', 'mention', 'little', 'spanish', 'Not', 'be', 'socio-political', 'also', 'how', 'respect', 'people', 'social', 'economic', 'classes', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'show', 'young', 'children', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'deep', 'character', 'development', 'anything', 'More', 'pacing', 'show', 'smooth', 'very', 'few', 'hiccups', 'move', 'simple', 'story', 'along.The', 'computer', 'animation', 'softer', 'tone', 'wonder', 'were', 'using', 'cell', 'shading', 'give', 'cartoon', 'look', 'feel', 'way', 'easy', 'eyes', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'three', 'episodes', 'show', 'bonus', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Sweeze', 'Day', 'off', 'Not', 'much', 'else', 'interactive', 'game', 'then', 'again', 'most', 'parents', 'get', 'DVDs', 'occupy', 'kid', 'time', 'show', 'not', 'special', 'features']",Handy Manny - Tooling Around
