Rexford,"[4, 4]","I know with all the intellectual property laws and such that the series Yes Dear would need a houseful of permits, since they used so many songs in thier show. But I plead with whomever has the rights to re-release this show on DVD to do so. It was one of those series that just hit everything right, from a top-notch cast to bright and terrific writing. No humour to wince at here...it was pure comedy with heart and that is why it will remain timeless in its unique approach to American sitcoms.Please oh please re-release this outstanding show.",5,A Plea...not a review,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,547,"['know', 'intellectual', 'property', 'laws', 'such', 'series', 'Yes', 'Dear', 'would', 'need', 'houseful', 'permits', 'used', 'so', 'many', 'songs', 'thier', 'show', 'plead', 'whomever', 'rights', 're-release', 'show', 'DVD', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'one', 'series', 'just', 'hit', 'everything', 'right', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'bright', 'terrific', 'writing', 'humour', 'wince', 'here', 'was', 'pure', 'comedy', 'heart', 'why', 'will', 'remain', 'timeless', 'unique', 'approach', 'American', 'sitcoms.Please', 'oh', 'please', 're-release', 'outstanding', 'show']","Yes, Dear"

Naturally, some were better than others but I found the entire series as a whole an excellent show that was perfectly cast.It is similar to the old Odd Couple in that you have Greg & Kim are well off, educated people and Kim's totally opposite sister (Christine) and her husband (Jimmy) live in the guest house.The show never gets old because the the laughs grow as their families grow which opens up completely new story lines.When you see the one where Jimmy thinks his mother in law is Christine and grabs her rear you will laugh as much on the 10th time you see it as you did the first.I love the show, I love the characters, and I can't wait for it to be released on DVD (preferably blu ray).",5,Hilarious!,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,794,"['personally', 'would', 'rate', 'show', 'side', 'Friends', 'Seinfeld.I', 'never', 'saw', 'bad', 'episode', 'Naturally', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'found', 'entire', 'series', 'whole', 'excellent', 'show', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast.It', 'similar', 'old', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'have', 'Greg', 'Kim', 'are', 'well', 'educated', 'people', 'Kim', 'totally', 'opposite', 'sister', 'Christine', 'husband', 'Jimmy', 'live', 'guest', 'house.The', 'show', 'never', 'old', 'laughs', 'grow', 'families', 'grow', 'up', 'completely', 'new', 'story', 'lines.When', 'see', 'one', 'where', 'Jimmy', 'mother', 'law', 'Christine', 'grabs', 'rear', 'will', 'laugh', 'as', 'much', '10th', 'time', 'see', 'did', 'first.I', 'show', 'love', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'preferably', 'blu', 'ray']","Yes, Dear"

Scott ""ecclectic fan""","[4, 8]",it is a cute show to just have on in the background....anyway I was watching it and Jimmy pitches a movie about a futuristicworld where clones are made and matured so they can donate body partsto their real counterparts- well one escapes and a true love storyensues---> okay so I think that the people who the movie The Island ayear ago must have been watching- wow!but it is a super cute show and has a lot of heat- pretty good familyvalues and has sweet plots... i like it- i admit it!
