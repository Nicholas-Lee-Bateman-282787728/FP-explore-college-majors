856761,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00062IESM,B. E Jackson,"[7, 7]","Alien Species is a really average movie with some of the cheesiest special effects I've ever seen.  It's a science fiction movie about these aliens in spaceships that come to visit earth and destroy all humans and buildings.  Well, the aliens must have been somewhat unorganized and confused, because more often than not, they'd strike empty dark barns and other deserted places, while the people right next to the homes or buildings were getting in their cars and driving away.  Yes somehow, the aliens didn't see them and so the people got away.  Strange!Some of the other scenes were just cliches of other movies, such as the guy who awakens in the middle of the night, hears a strange noise out in his barn, and when he gets out there, an alien is waiting for him (who he mistakens for a little boy).  Of course, you know what happens next.What REALLY bothered me were the special scenes that showed the alien spaceships attacking the city.  You'd see explosions when a hoard of spaceships got together to attack, but yet, the buildings weren't exploding or falling down.  You'd just see orange explosions with nothing actually falling apart. CHEESY!Oh, and did I mention the main character?  He's a guy who gets out of a prison van to help two women and their father (or grandfather, whatever) escape from the crazy aliens.  He has some of the worst lines ever.  ""I don't think we're in Kansas anymore"" is one of them.  Man, that's just wrong.  He actually acted very similar to Leon from the Resident Evil 2 video game, which came out just a couple years after this movies release.  Maybe a coincidence, maybe not.Overall, not really worth watching unless you REALLY need some alien-shooting fun in your life.",3,cheesy as it gets,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,1715,"['Alien', 'Species', 'really', 'average', 'movie', 'cheesiest', 'special', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'aliens', 'spaceships', 'come', 'visit', 'earth', 'destroy', 'humans', 'buildings', 'Well', 'aliens', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'unorganized', 'confused', 'more', 'often', 'not', ""'d"", 'strike', 'empty', 'dark', 'barns', 'other', 'deserted', 'places', 'people', 'right', 'next', 'homes', 'buildings', 'were', 'getting', 'cars', 'driving', 'away', 'Yes', 'somehow', 'aliens', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'so', 'people', 'got', 'away', 'Strange', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'cliches', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'guy', 'who', 'middle', 'night', 'strange', 'noise', 'out', 'barn', 'when', 'out', 'there', 'alien', 'waiting', 'who', 'little', 'boy', 'course', 'know', 'what', 'REALLY', 'bothered', 'were', 'special', 'scenes', 'showed', 'alien', 'spaceships', 'attacking', 'city', ""'d"", 'see', 'explosions', 'when', 'hoard', 'spaceships', 'got', 'together', 'attack', 'yet', 'buildings', 'were', ""n't"", 'exploding', 'falling', 'down', ""'d"", 'just', 'see', 'orange', 'explosions', 'nothing', 'actually', 'falling', 'apart', 'CHEESY', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'main', 'character', 'guy', 'who', 'prison', 'van', 'help', 'two', 'women', 'father', 'grandfather', 'escape', 'crazy', 'aliens', 'worst', 'lines', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'Kansas', 'anymore', 'one', 'Man', 'just', 'wrong', 'actually', 'acted', 'very', 'similar', 'Leon', 'Resident', 'Evil', '2', 'video', 'game', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'movies', 'release', 'Maybe', 'coincidence', 'maybe', 'not.Overall', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'REALLY', 'need', 'alien-shooting', 'fun', 'life']",Alien Species

As producer of an independent movie myself (http://www.amazon.com/Muffin-Man-HD-Mike-Short/dp/B00065Y82U) I was very intrigued and wanted to see it, but for some reason the DVD ended up on a shelf and I never got around to watching it until this week.This isn't the movie genre that I usually go out of my way for, but it was actually quite enjoyable.  Sure, it's a low budget production of a story that's been re-hashed a thousand times (aliens come to earth and shoot up the place for no discernable reason), but technically it was very well done.  The acting was fine, the dialog was passable, the special effects were actually quite good - especially considering the shoe-string budget that this movie was obviously made on.

856768,A25FV0XA4SGG9P,B00062IESM,MustangMichael,"[1, 1]","I agree with Harvey's review.  I'm going to go 2 stars on the rating.  Here are some added reasons why:Some of the mothership and fighter effects are adequate to good.  Most are poor.  The beam weapons are, IMHO, very poor.  The Sheriff's step van crash was such a poor effect, they had to edit out most of it and make the footage just the briefest glimpse.Like many not so good films, much of it is depicted at night allowing the old crutch; poor to no lighting.  Frequently almost a totally dark screen.  Many or most times, it appears the audience is expected to just use their imagination since not enough light is present to see who is who, details, actions, etc.Additionally, the background music is extremely tedious.  One plus regarding sound:  At least the film maker didn't choose to try to ""enhance"" this poor film with deafening, ear bleeding sound effects.  Likewise, the director did NOT resort to having the cameraman shake the camera to add fake action to a dying film.  I kept expecting it somehow.Probably not what they intended, but the actors and actresses are frequently directed to give a ridiculous slack jawed look of surprise.  These phony expressions are so far gone, they are actually funny.Strong suggestion:  Don't pay any added money to rent or buy the movie download or the DVD.  If you watch it at all, maybe do so if you have Prime so you're not paying anything extra.",2,Agreed; another bad alien movie,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,1401,"['agree', 'Harvey', 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', '2', 'stars', 'rating', 'Here', 'are', 'added', 'reasons', 'why', 'mothership', 'fighter', 'effects', 'are', 'adequate', 'good', 'Most', 'are', 'poor', 'beam', 'weapons', 'are', 'IMHO', 'very', 'poor', 'Sheriff', 'step', 'van', 'crash', 'was', 'such', 'poor', 'effect', 'had', 'edit', 'out', 'most', 'make', 'footage', 'just', 'briefest', 'glimpse.Like', 'many', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'films', 'much', 'depicted', 'night', 'allowing', 'old', 'crutch', 'poor', 'lighting', 'Frequently', 'almost', 'totally', 'dark', 'screen', 'Many', 'most', 'times', 'audience', 'expected', 'just', 'use', 'imagination', 'not', 'enough', 'light', 'present', 'see', 'who', 'who', 'details', 'actions', 'etc.Additionally', 'background', 'music', 'extremely', 'tedious', 'One', 'regarding', 'sound', 'least', 'film', 'maker', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'try', 'enhance', 'poor', 'film', 'deafening', 'ear', 'bleeding', 'sound', 'effects', 'Likewise', 'director', 'did', 'NOT', 'resort', 'having', 'cameraman', 'shake', 'camera', 'add', 'fake', 'action', 'dying', 'film', 'kept', 'expecting', 'somehow.Probably', 'not', 'what', 'intended', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'frequently', 'directed', 'give', 'ridiculous', 'slack', 'jawed', 'look', 'surprise', 'phony', 'expressions', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'gone', 'are', 'actually', 'funny.Strong', 'suggestion', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'added', 'money', 'rent', 'buy', 'movie', 'download', 'DVD', 'watch', 'maybe', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'Prime', ""'re"", 'not', 'paying', 'anything', 'extra']",Alien Species
