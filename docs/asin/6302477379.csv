He takes every opportunity to show off his talent for physical humor but also does fairly well in the dramatic end. A lot of literary license is used in telling the story but it can't be described as anything but heartwarming. Barbara Bel Geddes was a good selection to play Red Nichols' wife - pre-pre ""Dallas"" and the sadly late Susan Gordon and Tuesday Weld are both dolls playing the younger and older versions of their daughter.

314377,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,6302477379,Classic Movie watcher,"[0, 0]","Danny Kaye played Loring ""Red"" Nichols, the well known cornet player who rose to his fame in 1930s and whose Jazz group ""Five Pennies"" was once home to Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman and more - great musicians in the 40s Swing music.The movie was coherent, tightly woven both in the musical and emotional aspects. The duets between Danny Kaye (played by Red himself) and Louis Armstrong - the Battle Hymn of Republic and the Saints are marching - were wonderful. On the emotional side, Barbara Bel Geddes (Mrs. Ewing in Dallas) as Danny Kaye's sweetheart was a loving wife who endured long tours in the Five Pennies group, a devoted mother and a steadfast lady who held the family together. The bonds between the Five Pennies musicians, father and daughter, husband and wife are close and personal.Susan Gordon, as the couple's daughter Dorothy from 6 - 8 yrs old, was a delight. She was intelligent, passionate for her father's music and love, and would settle for nothing less. The night when father and daughter developed a closer bond over the song ""Five Pennies"", a table of cards, followed by a duet in the bar was touching. Susan Gordon's performance was subtle yet memorable. The dramatic turn when Danny Kaye threw away his cornet and work in a wartime shipyard at a meagre salary to make up for Dorothy in the subsequent years was heartbreaking. When the accomplished cornet player did make a comeback, it was not easy but gradual. The big finale was a tear jerker, but it's worth every tear.This is a well-balanced act between the musical and drama.

I actually went to a store that prides itself on its stock of movies, books, music, and other entertainment resources. When I couldn't locate any Danny Kaye movies, I asked one of the associates, and this particular associate had NO IDEA who Danny Kaye was. (And I'm not that old....early 30's.)I hadn't seen ""Five Pennies"" before, but ordered it anyway, trusting that, being a Danny Kaye movie, it wouldn't disappoint. I was right.It was refreshing to see Danny Kaye in this role where he portrays a real person in a real story, where most of his roles are playing fictional characters. He still maintained his jovial, fun, hilarious self, but showed his ability to portray seriousness as well.I busted up laughing when Kaye sang with Louis Armstrong and imitated his voice, his mannerisms, and his style.

Yes - the depth of character that he reaches in this movie are incredible. He's not just a comedic actor, as he is best known, but also a wonderful dramatic actor.

314387,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302477379,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Even with my overwhelming fondness for the uproarious THE COURT JESTER, I must admit that my favorite Danny Kaye feature is THE FIVE PENNIES. This film, released in 1959, tells the highly fictionalized but very entertaining biofilm of cornet player Ernest Loring ""Red"" Nichols (1905-1965) as warmly portrayed by another musically-gifted readhead, Danny Kaye. In its unabashed sentimentaly, fine acting, and timeless jazzy/rag music, THE FIVE PENNIES has never lost its fascination with me, and I've seen it a gazallion times. Danny Kaye, this time out, makes do with less mugging, and, thus, ends up with a warmer, more grounded performance. Oh, he still has moments wherein he resorts to his patented gimmicks of glib double speak and foreign accents, but they're not many.The film has Nichols writing sheet arrangements which incorporate jazz into the music. From the time when he was merely a lowly cornet player, he's tended to push his ideas perhaps too strongly at people and then having little patience when he is rebuffed. In the movie, he's seen as losing gig after gig because of his unwillingness to adapt to his current place in life, even though he had just gotten married and desperately needed the job. It's a credit to Danny Kaye's likability that the viewer doesn't get annoyed with him and, in fact, the fashion in which he gets axed time and again is played out in a humorous manner. Also, his perfect chemistry with Barbara Bel Geddes as his wife Bobbie and, later on, with Susan Gordon and Tuesday Weld, who respectively play his daughter Dorothy at ages 6 and 14, go a long way to lending Red Nichols empathy from the viewer. The music certainly resonates, but Red's family relationships and his later sacrifice are what gives THE FIVE PENNIES its emotional core. One of many favorite moments in the film is with Danny hanging out late one night with a young, insistently wide-awake Dorothy (Susan Gordon) at their motel room.The real Red Nichols played the music while Kaye was doing the convincing cornet finger work. I still get chills when Danny Kaye, post vomit in a speakeasy, first plays the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and ends up dueting with Louis Armstrong. Danny's actual wife, songwriter Sylvia Fine, ended up writing four very tuneful songs for this film: ""Follow the Leader,"" the catchy ""Lullaby in Ragtime,"" ""Goodnight - Sleep Tight,"" and ""The Five Pennies."" Another moment I love is the triple harmonizing amongst Louis, Danny, and Susan Gordon, where three of Fine's songs are seamlessly, gloriously interwoven.

Even worse, an actor is remembered for only one type of role and his unique work is pushed to the background.  It is our good fortune to finally have one of Danny Kaye's finest performances on DVD.  The Five Pennies is now available on a barebones release.Kaye is known for some brilliant comedies including The Court Jester, and for some more subtle performances like Hans Christian Anderson, but here he combines the best of the two.  In what purports to be the life story of famous cornet player,  Loring ""Red"" Nichols, Kaye is wonderful.  Along for the ride is Barbara Bel Geddes (Broadway's Maggie the cat) as wife Bobbie.  With her close, squinty eyes and squat shape, she is not exactly a movie babe, but she is terrific actress and great acting partner for Kaye.Three things up the ante of this film to excellent:  the Oscar-nominated color photography in VistaVision by Daniel L. Fapp, the music performed by Louis Armstrong and Nichols himself as Kaye mimes the playing, and the performance of child actress Susan Gordon as Dorothy Nichols.Kaye's scene with Gordon as he croons the Oscar-nominated title tune (written by his wife Sylvia Fine) is as touching a moment ever captured on film.  Kaye and Gordon seem to transcend themselves to actually become father and daughter.  Their poker scene is charming.  Gordon (who grows up to be Tuesday Weld later in the film) holds her own musically with Kaye and Armstrong and is a movie moppet to be adored.Illness in the family, quitting show business, and other problems populate the final third of the film, but it is all presented with the proper sentiment.  When Red picks up his cornet again, we are glad.The Five Pennies, its superb cast, 20 great musical numbers, and beautiful settings would be a welcome addition to your collection.  Kaye will touch your heart, and Gordon will make you smile with a tear in your eyes.",5,The Five Pennies is Worth Its Weight in Gold,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,1928,"['Times', 'change', 'Stars', 'fall', 'are', 'forgotten', 'Even', 'worse', 'actor', 'remembered', 'only', 'one', 'type', 'role', 'unique', 'work', 'pushed', 'background', 'good', 'fortune', 'finally', 'have', 'one', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'finest', 'performances', 'DVD', 'Five', 'Pennies', 'now', 'available', 'barebones', 'release.Kaye', 'known', 'brilliant', 'comedies', 'including', 'Court', 'Jester', 'more', 'subtle', 'performances', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson', 'here', 'best', 'two', 'what', 'be', 'life', 'story', 'famous', 'cornet', 'player', 'Loring', 'Red', 'Nichols', 'Kaye', 'wonderful', 'ride', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'Broadway', 'Maggie', 'cat', 'wife', 'Bobbie', 'close', 'squinty', 'eyes', 'squat', 'shape', 'not', 'exactly', 'movie', 'babe', 'terrific', 'actress', 'great', 'acting', 'partner', 'Kaye.Three', 'things', 'up', 'ante', 'film', 'excellent', 'Oscar-nominated', 'color', 'photography', 'VistaVision', 'Daniel', 'L.', 'Fapp', 'music', 'performed', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'Nichols', 'Kaye', 'playing', 'performance', 'child', 'actress', 'Susan', 'Gordon', 'Dorothy', 'Nichols.Kaye', 'scene', 'Gordon', 'Oscar-nominated', 'title', 'tune', 'written', 'wife', 'Sylvia', 'Fine', 'touching', 'moment', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Kaye', 'Gordon', 'seem', 'transcend', 'actually', 'become', 'father', 'daughter', 'poker', 'scene', 'charming', 'Gordon', 'who', 'up', 'be', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'later', 'film', 'own', 'musically', 'Kaye', 'Armstrong', 'movie', 'moppet', 'be', 'adored.Illness', 'family', 'quitting', 'show', 'business', 'other', 'problems', 'populate', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'presented', 'proper', 'sentiment', 'When', 'Red', 'up', 'cornet', 'again', 'are', 'glad.The', 'Five', 'Pennies', 'superb', 'cast', '20', 'great', 'musical', 'numbers', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection', 'Kaye', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'Gordon', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'tear', 'eyes']",The Five Pennies VHS

Now with the movie soundtrack also available on CD, the movie and its wonderful soundtrack may be better appreciated by afficionados. My only criticism is the film comes with no special features, surely a doco on Kaye would not have been that hard to put together? or at least a retrospective doco and an interview with Susan Gordon and Tuesday Weld who are both still around? Paramount tend to be lazy with this sort of thing, they adapt their films superbly with excellent 16.9 widescreen transfers, then let themselves down by not presenting any extras.

Later I found movies like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty that were just as funny.  I was hooked on Danny Kaye the actor/comedian.This is not one of his outrageously hilarious movies.  It's sad and beautiful with a wonderful plotline. A wonderful cast compliments Danny Kaye and the musical score is fantastic-- very jazzy rag. Louis Armstrong duets with Danny Kaye in voice as well as trumpet (coronet).  My favorite song has to be Lullabye in Ragtime, though.  They manage to meld two different melodies perfectly.The movie focuses on the life of Red Nichol (Danny Kaye) as a small-town coronet player trying to make it big in the music industry.  He falls in love and gets married, but just as he's starting to make it to the big-time his wife gets pregnant.  They take the baby on the road with them for as long as they can but it's no life for a child.  Eventually she is sent to a boarding school where she contracts polio.  Red is so overcome with guilt that he gives up everything he had in the music industry to help his daughter get well and walk again.  By the time she's grown up and able to stand again she has forgotten that her father had ever been in the music industry.  Red's wife and all his old band buddies want him to be happy and get back into music, but Red keeps falling into depression and punishing himself for his daughter's polio.  It ends beautifully with all his band buddies turning out to hear him play and his daughter walking towards him without her cane and them dancing together.

(A very tough thing for him to do because he loved his music and that career and really really craved being #1 at it and on the top rung of the professional musician ladder.)Members of his Five Pennies band included the famous Jimmy Dorsey and Glenn Miller (who became individually popular after The Five Pennies broke up and they got bands of their own).  Another famous friend of Red's was Louie Armstrong (who plays himself in this picture) and he performs quite a bit in this movie.I'm NOT a fan of Dixie or Jazz music (at all) but I DID enjoy most of the music in this movie as well as the story (and yes, there are a couple of tear-jerker scenes in his story).It's not Danny Kaye's BEST movie, but it's close (the man is talented!) - and Barbara Bel Geddes, the actress who plays his wife, is also very good in this and has a lovely voice too.

He and his wife, played by Barbara Bel Geddes, have a daughter, Dorothy, and when she is 5 or 6 years old they decide to put her in boarding school because the road is no place to raise a daughter.  Dorothy contracts polio while she is at school.  In a way, she blames her father and their relationship is strained for awhile.  Red decides to quit the music business and works in a wartime factory and helps rehabilitate Dorothy until she is older.  Eventually, Dorothy and her mother convince Red to return to music.
