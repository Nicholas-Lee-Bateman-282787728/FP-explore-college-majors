Andrews,"[1, 1]","Former Navy pilot in Reserves is flying an amphibious Grumman Mallard on &#34;business&#34; trips while his girlfriend is secretary to drug dealers.  He meets up with an old WW2 buddy who is flying the Consolidated Privateer for the Hurricane Weather Patrol in Florida, and also has married his old flame from his days in San Diego.  He renews the affair, and later has to get his head straight after belatedly receiving the Navy Cross for a WW2 action.

1548792,AEOTFNGGN2A9E,B0089BSLTY,Pvt. W.G. Kirby,"[0, 0]","If you've read my other reviews, you know I'm a collector of military and aviation themed books and movies. And I am a child of the fifties who saw many of the films I've collected on TV. Well, that's the story here...except I only saw the conclusion of this film once on TV back in the early sixties. It has been an objective to collect it for many many years. It had not been readily available on TV over the years, and was never readily available on video or DVD, until now, as a&#34;Special Collections&#34; DVD offering. Amazon had it and got it to me in only a few days, in perfect condition. I put it in the player and watched...and saw a so- so movie. Not bad or disappointing, but a bit predictable. Still, I've been satisfied in now owning it!Star Richard Widmark is former USN WWII pilot now hired as a pilot for a wealthy candy magnate in the south Florida area..unknown to pilot Slattery is the fact his boss is smuggling narcotics with each business trip. Regularly dating the secretary to the boss, the couple run into a former Navy pilot pal of Slattery, now flying weather recon flights for the US Weather Bureau in the &#34;Hurricane Hunters&#34; squadron. Of course, the pal is married to Slattery's former love interest, and all the plot turns and jolts that one can expect from such a script situation are featured on the screen. As the plot boils, Slattery finds he still loves the gal, dumps the secretary, is awarded a five year late Navy Cross for a late WWII mission, discovers the gal will leave his pal and runs away with him, and then discovers his boss' smuggling and asks in for a take on the big money or he will turn them in...then his conscience steps up ( as he gets the medal, of course) and the former girlfriend/ secretary overdoses on narcotics from her broken heart and almost dies. Vowing to make all right again, he flies a hurricane recon flight alone in his private plane to save the life and career and marriage of his former best pal. And he comes clean to the authorities. As he had no earlier knowledge of the smuggling and took no big money from the mob.....you can watch to see the outcome!Widmark is the big name star, but only two years into his career. He was still learning his craft, but he does keep your attention. Linda Darnell at her Hollywood peak is the past love interest. And Veronica Lake is the girlfriend/secretary at the end of her run in Hollywood. Once the glamour girl with the peek-a-boo bangs, she plays a very plain, hurt person. I wonder if it was that much acting on her part here as her star was fading fast by 1950. The other stars of the film  to me, anyhow, are the aircraft featured in the story. The US Navy offered full access and participation. We see flight scenes of formations of naval reserve F-6F HELLCATS, SNJ trainers, and F-4U CORSAIRS.  A Hurricane Hunters recon flight in a USN PRIVATEER patrol bomber is a long sequence in the movie, to my knowledge  the only screen appearance of such an aircraft in a Hollywood feature. Widmark pilots a civil version of a Grumman HU-16 for his smuggling bosses. These aircraft and the movie itself after so many years make this a treasure to me.If any of this interests you, go ahead, you might enjoy the ride!",3,"After all these years, AT LAST  you are mine!",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,3240,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'know', ""'m"", 'collector', 'military', 'aviation', 'themed', 'books', 'movies', 'am', 'child', 'fifties', 'who', 'saw', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'TV', 'Well', 'story', 'here', 'only', 'saw', 'conclusion', 'film', 'once', 'TV', 'back', 'early', 'sixties', 'been', 'objective', 'collect', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'readily', 'available', 'TV', 'years', 'was', 'never', 'readily', 'available', 'video', 'DVD', 'now', '34', 'Special', 'Collections', '34', 'DVD', 'offering', 'Amazon', 'had', 'got', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'perfect', 'condition', 'put', 'player', 'watched', 'saw', 'so-', 'so', 'movie', 'Not', 'bad', 'disappointing', 'bit', 'predictable', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'been', 'satisfied', 'now', 'owning', 'Star', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'former', 'USN', 'WWII', 'pilot', 'now', 'hired', 'pilot', 'wealthy', 'candy', 'magnate', 'south', 'Florida', 'area..unknown', 'pilot', 'Slattery', 'fact', 'boss', 'smuggling', 'narcotics', 'business', 'trip', 'Regularly', 'dating', 'secretary', 'boss', 'couple', 'run', 'former', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'pal', 'Slattery', 'now', 'flying', 'weather', 'recon', 'flights', 'US', 'Weather', 'Bureau', '34', 'Hurricane', 'Hunters', '34', 'squadron', 'course', 'pal', 'married', 'Slattery', 'former', 'love', 'interest', 'plot', 'jolts', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'such', 'script', 'situation', 'are', 'featured', 'screen', 'plot', 'boils', 'Slattery', 'still', 'gal', 'secretary', 'awarded', 'five', 'year', 'late', 'Navy', 'Cross', 'late', 'WWII', 'mission', 'gal', 'will', 'leave', 'pal', 'away', 'then', 'boss', 'smuggling', 'asks', 'take', 'big', 'money', 'will', 'turn', 'then', 'conscience', 'steps', 'up', 'medal', 'course', 'former', 'girlfriend/', 'secretary', 'overdoses', 'narcotics', 'broken', 'heart', 'almost', 'dies', 'Vowing', 'make', 'right', 'again', 'hurricane', 'recon', 'flight', 'alone', 'private', 'plane', 'save', 'life', 'career', 'marriage', 'former', 'best', 'pal', 'clean', 'authorities', 'had', 'earlier', 'knowledge', 'smuggling', 'took', 'big', 'money', 'mob', 'can', 'watch', 'see', 'outcome', 'Widmark', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'career', 'was', 'still', 'learning', 'craft', 'keep', 'attention', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'Hollywood', 'peak', 'past', 'love', 'interest', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'girlfriend/secretary', 'end', 'run', 'Hollywood', 'glamour', 'girl', 'peek-a-boo', 'bangs', 'very', 'plain', 'hurt', 'person', 'wonder', 'was', 'much', 'acting', 'part', 'here', 'star', 'was', 'fading', 'fast', '1950', 'other', 'stars', 'film', 'anyhow', 'are', 'aircraft', 'featured', 'story', 'US', 'Navy', 'offered', 'full', 'access', 'participation', 'see', 'flight', 'scenes', 'formations', 'naval', 'reserve', 'F-6F', 'HELLCATS', 'SNJ', 'trainers', 'F-4U', 'CORSAIRS', 'A', 'Hurricane', 'Hunters', 'recon', 'flight', 'USN', 'PRIVATEER', 'patrol', 'bomber', 'long', 'sequence', 'movie', 'knowledge', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'such', 'aircraft', 'Hollywood', 'feature', 'Widmark', 'pilots', 'civil', 'version', 'Grumman', 'HU-16', 'smuggling', 'bosses', 'aircraft', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'make', 'treasure', 'me.If', 'interests', 'go', 'ahead', 'might', 'enjoy', 'ride']",N/A

Plot of this film is unique; it unwinds rather clutterted, but that is the director's fault at editing.  The story is like the three dimensional chess game of Star Trek.  The stars collide, rebound and form new orbits as they live this finely crafted hurricane story.  Flying into hurricanes was a newborn science method and the film flies us into the eye right along with Richard Widmark's character.  Is he just a heel?  Is he just a hero?  Gotta watch to the end credits to find out.  It's black and white. The special effects suffer for want of alittle CGI.  But, I love old planes and bold pilots and anti-heros; sometimes.  I recomend this film for the story and the stars who make it live.  And the retro-view of our America back in the day.  Even fiction contains much fact to chew on.  This film indulges like a cup of hot cocoa on a snowy day.

1548795,AXHCIHVT92GYF,B0089BSLTY,The CinemaScope Cat,"[6, 6]","An arrogant self centered ex-Navy flyer (Richard Widmark) works as a private pilot for a candy manufacturer (Walter Kingsford) whose company is actually a front for drug smuggling. Although he's dating an ex-junkie (Veronica Lake), the pilot seduces the wife (Linda Darnell) of his good friend (John Russell). Based on a short story by Herman Wouk (THE CAINE MUTINY), Wouk's story is watered down for the screen due to the censorship restrictions of the day regarding adultery and drug addiction. What remains seems rather contrived and Widmark's transformation from heel to hero is too rapid to feel authentic. The film's one likable character, Lake's emotionally tenuous waif, is so ill treated by Widmark that her acceptance of his abuse finally makes her unappealing too. Widmark's likability as an actor does much to hold off apathy toward his character though as previously remarked, his redemption feels phony. The crude hurricane sequences are effective. Directed by Andre De Toth (HOUSE OF WAX). With Gary Merrill, Joe De Santis, Morris Ankrum and Amelita Ward.The Fox MOD DVD is a decent transfer.",3,"Widmark, Darnell and Lake make this problematic venture worth a look",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1107,"['arrogant', 'self', 'centered', 'ex-Navy', 'flyer', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'private', 'pilot', 'candy', 'manufacturer', 'Walter', 'Kingsford', 'company', 'actually', 'front', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'dating', 'ex-junkie', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'pilot', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'good', 'friend', 'John', 'Russell', 'Based', 'short', 'story', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'THE', 'CAINE', 'MUTINY', 'Wouk', 'story', 'watered', 'down', 'screen', 'due', 'censorship', 'restrictions', 'day', 'regarding', 'adultery', 'drug', 'addiction', 'What', 'rather', 'contrived', 'Widmark', 'transformation', 'heel', 'hero', 'too', 'rapid', 'feel', 'authentic', 'film', 'one', 'likable', 'character', 'Lake', 'emotionally', 'tenuous', 'waif', 'so', 'ill', 'treated', 'Widmark', 'acceptance', 'abuse', 'finally', 'unappealing', 'too', 'Widmark', 'likability', 'actor', 'much', 'hold', 'off', 'apathy', 'character', 'as', 'previously', 'remarked', 'redemption', 'feels', 'phony', 'crude', 'hurricane', 'sequences', 'are', 'effective', 'Directed', 'Andre', 'De', 'Toth', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'WAX', 'Gary', 'Merrill', 'Joe', 'De', 'Santis', 'Morris', 'Ankrum', 'Amelita', 'Ward.The', 'Fox', 'MOD', 'DVD', 'decent', 'transfer']",N/A
