I've forgotten how good it feels to watch George Hamilton being the jack of all trades in Zorro, The Gay Blade. It's one of the funniest films I've seen, and Zorro, The Gay Blade is high on the scale of creativity. Great performances are given by George Hamilton and Ron Leibman. What makes Zorro, The Gay Blade the far away the best film when it comes to Zorro films is that it stays true to the feeling of what Zorro represents and then wanders on the obscure side of laughter. All the credit goes to George Hamilton for making Zorro an appealing character. I've mentioned that villains do play a large part in making a film likable only if they are as appealing as well. Zorro, The Gay Blade gives me that. I've enjoyed watching Ron Leibman, who played as Esteban, being a brilliant but whacked out character . A small twist in Zorro, The Gay Blade is another reason for the obscure side of laughter when the first Zorro breaks his leg, and then he replaced by his gay brother. The picture gets better and better along with Paco, Zorro's sidekick. Zorro, The Gay Blade is a hilarious film. Also, it possesses very good writing.3/12: Although George Hamilton was sensational in playing a dual role, it was Ron Leibman who stole the show as the hated Alcalde. I knew that he reached the zenith of his insanity when the scene occurred with him making a riddle out of the colors of Zorro's costumes which resulted in a salad. Then, he did this finger pointing to his tax master, making him to sit down. Yeah...I haven't seen brilliance in an absurd comedy before like how Ron Leibman did. He just knew how to own the role, and he gave it all. He was just brilliant. George Hamilton was brilliant as well, just perfectly cast as Zorro and his gay brother, Bunny Wigglesworth. The whole film was a pure farce with a great play with words. Just a beautifully written script with a crazy idea. All in all, Ron Leibman was the man and easily an Oscar winner in Zorro: The Gay Blade. That scene when he is walking like he is ssssaaaa and ssssswwwingg yoouurrr hipssss still cracks me up.",5,"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH, SANTA MARIA!!",1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,2221,"['Viewed', '4/04', '12/06', '3/12Rate', '912/06', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'refreshing', 'change', 'watching', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'Legend', 'Zorro', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'good', 'watch', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'being', 'jack', 'trades', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'high', 'scale', 'creativity', 'Great', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'What', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'film', 'when', 'Zorro', 'films', 'true', 'feeling', 'what', 'Zorro', 'then', 'wanders', 'obscure', 'side', 'laughter', 'credit', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'making', 'Zorro', 'appealing', 'character', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'villains', 'do', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'making', 'film', 'likable', 'only', 'are', 'as', 'appealing', 'as', 'well', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'who', 'played', 'Esteban', 'being', 'brilliant', 'whacked', 'out', 'character', 'small', 'twist', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'reason', 'obscure', 'side', 'laughter', 'when', 'first', 'Zorro', 'breaks', 'leg', 'then', 'replaced', 'gay', 'brother', 'picture', 'better', 'better', 'Paco', 'Zorro', 'sidekick', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'hilarious', 'film', 'Also', 'very', 'good', 'writing.3/12', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'sensational', 'playing', 'dual', 'role', 'was', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'hated', 'Alcalde', 'knew', 'reached', 'zenith', 'insanity', 'when', 'scene', 'occurred', 'making', 'riddle', 'colors', 'Zorro', 'costumes', 'resulted', 'salad', 'Then', 'did', 'finger', 'pointing', 'tax', 'master', 'making', 'sit', 'down', 'Yeah', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'brilliance', 'absurd', 'comedy', 'how', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'did', 'just', 'knew', 'how', 'own', 'role', 'gave', 'was', 'just', 'brilliant', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'brilliant', 'well', 'just', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Zorro', 'gay', 'brother', 'Bunny', 'Wigglesworth', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'pure', 'farce', 'great', 'play', 'words', 'Just', 'beautifully', 'written', 'script', 'crazy', 'idea', 'Ron', 'Leibman', 'was', 'man', 'easily', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'scene', 'when', 'walking', 'ssssaaaa', 'ssssswwwingg', 'yoouurrr', 'hipssss', 'still', 'up']",N/A

The basics are like the original Zorro but has enough twists and comedy to keep almost anyone entertained.  It leaves one feeling good due to the story line and the laughs...of which there are plenty.Basically, the son of the original Zorro returns to his hometown after having been summoned by his father who has now passed away.  A letter to the son reveals that his father was the original Zorro and that it is time for the masked crusader to ride again as the Alcalde (Mayor) is evil and over taxing the poor as well as the rich.  Those who do not pay are brutalized.  You've seen that all before but in this version, when the son dons the Cape and mask, he gets hurt.  What to do?  Along comes his brother, a sailor in the British Navy and he happens to be gay.  The newly arrived brother, becomes Zorro, but does so with a new flair.  Instead of basic black, his costumes become various colors...avocado, red, gold and so on.  This is hilarious piece of cinema and is worth the time to sit and enjoy.  You can't help but laugh, smile and want more.  George Hamilton is excellent in this.  Prior to Zorro the Gay Blade, George Hamilton had done Love at First Bite, which I enjoyed.
