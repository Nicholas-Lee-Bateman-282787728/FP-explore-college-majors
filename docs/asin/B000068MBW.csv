This is a great movie about the efforts of 'established' medicine and other forms of healing.  After months of trying all the medical efforts to control this boy's epilepsy with no success, he is scheduled for brain surgery.  However, his mother has studied everything she can about epilepsy, and come across a special diet, the Ketogenic Diet, that held out promise.  Rather than let the doctors do the surgery in their local hospital, the mother takes the boy to Johns Hopkins Hospital for the diet.  It starts out with fasting!  At the same time we can assume that the priest and nuns at the convent where they are staying are praying for the little boy.  For those who don't have an epileptic child, the real impact of this movie is not felt until the end when you discover that many of the characters were actual child epileptic patients who had been completely freed of epilepsy though the diet, most now adults!

She actually puts her very soul into the character, unlike the work in her films where she says her lines as if she's talking in her sleep . . . like the actors in the John Hughes films.However, as good as she is in this and Allison Janney as that stupid doctor, Seth Adkins I believe carries it all the way.

704893,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000068MBW,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 4]","First Do No Harm is an underrated masterpiece that brilliantly captures the pain and suffering an entire family goes through when one of their young children is diagnosed with epilepsy. The acting is particularly convincing; I was amazed at how well Seth Adkins portrayed Robbie Reimuller; he made me believe he actually had epileptic seizures! Meryl Streep and Fred Ward also give tour-de-force performances. The choreography and cinematography reflect great forethought, too.When the film starts, we quickly meet a small town Midwest family who, while not rich, live their lives happily. Unfortunately, trouble sets in when Robbie falls down at school--and not long after he is diagnosed with epilepsy. Robbie's parents Dave (Fred Ward) and Lori Reimuller (Meryl Streep) are horrified; and it seems that with every drug they try to treat his epilepsy Robbie only gets worse. Indeed, Robbie is soon on a huge number of drugs--sometimes more than one for the epilepsy and others to combat the side effects of the epileptic drugs! The family begins to fall apart as everyone feels the strain and it all gets so bad that Robbie's older brother actually wishes Robbie were dead!When the family's health insurance is cancelled and their savings runs out, his parents must go to a public hospital where staff are so overwhelmed that they can't always be on the ward--and Robbie just gets worse and worse. Dave and Lori must also contend with the amazingly callous Dr. Melanie Abbasac (Allison Janney) who doesn't offer them or Robbie any comfort--or much hope.Lori, who is now desperate to save her son, goes to the library to do her own research on epilepsy and what can be done to treat it. While reading about epilepsy, Lori discovers something called the Ketogenic Diet which gives people a chance to fight their epilepsy without drugs; and Lori wants to take Robbie to Baltimore where there is a treatment facility that can treat Robbie with the special diet. However, tensions mount when Dr. Abbasac is vehemently against letting Robbie leave the hospital because the diet is not approved by the medical community.I won't tell you much more to avoid giving out spoilers. I've already left out some of the plot so that you can appreciate this film as much as I did. Suffice it to say that it's all very poignant and this film is not something you will forget anytime soon.The DVD doesn't come with any extras; I would have liked an interview with a few members of the cast and/or the director but it's all so well done that this becomes a minor quibble. Look also for great performances by Margo Martindale and Marjean; Mairon Bennett as Lynne Reimuller; Michael Yarmush as Mark Reimuller and Tom Butler as Dr. Jim Peterson. Kudos goes to Millicent Kelly, who worked tirelessly for decades at the treatment facility as a Ketogenic Diet Specialist; she has a fine cameo in this film.First Do No Harm is a poignant, sensitive film that will move you even if you and the people you know have not been overwhelmed by the terrible disease of epilepsy. I also highly recommend this film for people interested in this subject matter. Fans of the actors in this film would do well to get this for their collections.",5,"realistic, intense and highly emotional",1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,3207,"['First', 'Do', 'Harm', 'underrated', 'masterpiece', 'brilliantly', 'pain', 'suffering', 'entire', 'family', 'when', 'one', 'young', 'children', 'diagnosed', 'epilepsy', 'acting', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'Seth', 'Adkins', 'portrayed', 'Robbie', 'Reimuller', 'made', 'believe', 'actually', 'had', 'epileptic', 'seizures', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'also', 'give', 'tour-de-force', 'performances', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'reflect', 'great', 'forethought', 'too.When', 'film', 'quickly', 'meet', 'small', 'town', 'Midwest', 'family', 'who', 'not', 'rich', 'live', 'lives', 'happily', 'Unfortunately', 'trouble', 'sets', 'when', 'Robbie', 'down', 'school', 'not', 'long', 'diagnosed', 'epilepsy', 'Robbie', 'parents', 'Dave', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Lori', 'Reimuller', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'are', 'horrified', 'drug', 'try', 'treat', 'epilepsy', 'Robbie', 'only', 'worse', 'Indeed', 'Robbie', 'soon', 'huge', 'number', 'drugs', 'sometimes', 'more', 'one', 'epilepsy', 'others', 'combat', 'side', 'effects', 'epileptic', 'drugs', 'family', 'fall', 'apart', 'everyone', 'strain', 'so', 'bad', 'Robbie', 'older', 'brother', 'actually', 'Robbie', 'were', 'dead', 'When', 'family', 'health', 'insurance', 'cancelled', 'savings', 'out', 'parents', 'must', 'go', 'public', 'hospital', 'where', 'staff', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'ward', 'Robbie', 'just', 'worse', 'worse', 'Dave', 'Lori', 'must', 'also', 'contend', 'amazingly', 'callous', 'Dr.', 'Melanie', 'Abbasac', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'who', ""n't"", 'offer', 'Robbie', 'comfort', 'much', 'hope.Lori', 'who', 'now', 'desperate', 'save', 'son', 'library', 'do', 'own', 'research', 'epilepsy', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'treat', 'reading', 'epilepsy', 'Lori', 'something', 'called', 'Ketogenic', 'Diet', 'people', 'chance', 'fight', 'epilepsy', 'drugs', 'Lori', 'take', 'Robbie', 'Baltimore', 'where', 'treatment', 'facility', 'can', 'treat', 'Robbie', 'special', 'diet', 'However', 'tensions', 'mount', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Abbasac', 'vehemently', 'letting', 'Robbie', 'leave', 'hospital', 'diet', 'not', 'approved', 'medical', 'community.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'avoid', 'giving', 'out', 'spoilers', ""'ve"", 'already', 'left', 'out', 'plot', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Suffice', 'say', 'very', 'poignant', 'film', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'forget', 'anytime', 'soon.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'come', 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'interview', 'few', 'members', 'cast', 'director', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'minor', 'quibble', 'Look', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'Marjean', 'Mairon', 'Bennett', 'Lynne', 'Reimuller', 'Michael', 'Yarmush', 'Mark', 'Reimuller', 'Tom', 'Butler', 'Dr.', 'Jim', 'Peterson', 'Kudos', 'Millicent', 'Kelly', 'who', 'worked', 'tirelessly', 'decades', 'treatment', 'facility', 'Ketogenic', 'Diet', 'Specialist', 'fine', 'cameo', 'film.First', 'Do', 'No', 'Harm', 'poignant', 'sensitive', 'film', 'will', 'move', 'even', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'overwhelmed', 'terrible', 'disease', 'epilepsy', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'Fans', 'actors', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'collections']","""...First Do No Harm"""
