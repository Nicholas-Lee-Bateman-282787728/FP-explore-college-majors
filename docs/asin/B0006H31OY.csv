I just want to say that these videos are good, but not really if you're expecting a normal workout or basic bellydance instruction. In a way, they're for more advanced bellydancers, although I could also suggest them to anyone who enjoys moving her body, becoming more flexible, and gaining control over -- really, I have to say this -- the strangest muscles. The ""Buns"" video also left me dazed when I first did it. (Why on earth would anyone want to flex her glutes individually, I wondered!) And honestly, since I'm not a performing dancer, I have no practical purpose for it myself! But if you get a kick at all from the process of gaining awareness of and control over your body, these videos are not a waste.",4,"Good, but for a specific purpose",1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,781,"['wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'long', 'review', 'are', 'already', 'many', 'opinions', 'here', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'videos', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'really', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'normal', 'workout', 'basic', 'bellydance', 'instruction', 'way', ""'re"", 'more', 'advanced', 'bellydancers', 'could', 'also', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'who', 'moving', 'body', 'becoming', 'more', 'flexible', 'gaining', 'control', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'strangest', 'muscles', 'Buns', 'video', 'also', 'left', 'dazed', 'when', 'first', 'did', 'Why', 'earth', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'flex', 'glutes', 'individually', 'wondered', 'honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'performing', 'dancer', 'have', 'practical', 'purpose', 'get', 'kick', 'process', 'gaining', 'awareness', 'control', 'body', 'videos', 'are', 'not', 'waste']",N/A

I know from my continuing classes that strength & control are needed to do well and the only way to get both is by practice & exercise.  These DVDs are definitely, as I saw mentioned in another review, exercises for belly dancers.  I really like Suhaila's instruction too.Each DVD has a focus, but all parts of the body are worked to some extent.  She also adds layering in with all 4 DVDs, which is something I am working hard on right now.  I skip between the Yoga, Buns, & Pilates in my home practice.  There are some periods where the moves are way too fast for me to keep up, but I figure if the women in the video can do it, I should be able to do it too, so I keep on working at it.  I can definitely see the value in this!1.  The Yoga DVD is the least intensive workout and focuses on belly exercises (undulations).2.  The Buns DVD has some very difficult exercises & some not so bad.  Focus is on shimmies & hip work, standing still & moving.  If I could get 2 of these, this would be my 2nd choice.3.  The Pilates DVD seemed to be more all-over, with some very difficult (for me) leg work & good stretches.  If I could only get one of these, this would be it.4.  The Jazz DVD is too difficult for me now, but I'll try it again in a few months to see if I can do it.If you are looking for choreography and a wide selection of belly dance moves, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for some intense exercises to help you with strength & control in your belly dance - these are GREAT!",5,REALLY great training exercises for serious bellydancers,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1571,"['love', 'DVDs', 'even', 'have', 'very', 'difficult', 'exercises', 'know', 'continuing', 'classes', 'strength', 'control', 'are', 'needed', 'do', 'well', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'practice', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'are', 'definitely', 'saw', 'mentioned', 'review', 'belly', 'dancers', 'really', 'Suhaila', 'instruction', 'too.Each', 'DVD', 'focus', 'parts', 'body', 'are', 'worked', 'extent', 'also', 'layering', '4', 'DVDs', 'something', 'am', 'working', 'hard', 'right', 'now', 'skip', 'Yoga', 'Buns', 'Pilates', 'home', 'practice', 'are', 'periods', 'where', 'moves', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'keep', 'up', 'figure', 'women', 'video', 'can', 'do', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'too', 'keep', 'working', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'value', '1', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'least', 'intensive', 'workout', 'focuses', 'belly', 'exercises', 'undulations', '.2', 'Buns', 'DVD', 'very', 'difficult', 'exercises', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'Focus', 'shimmies', 'hip', 'work', 'standing', 'still', 'moving', 'could', 'get', '2', 'would', 'be', '2nd', 'choice.3', 'Pilates', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'all-over', 'very', 'difficult', 'leg', 'work', 'good', 'stretches', 'could', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'it.4', 'Jazz', 'DVD', 'too', 'difficult', 'now', ""'ll"", 'try', 'again', 'few', 'months', 'see', 'can', 'do', 'it.If', 'are', 'looking', 'choreography', 'wide', 'selection', 'belly', 'dance', 'moves', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'looking', 'intense', 'exercises', 'help', 'strength', 'control', 'belly', 'dance', 'are', 'GREAT']",N/A

867746,A1D807T2HQSMWX,B0006H31OY,"Jessica Jones ""Dreamsenshi""","[2, 3]","The problem I have with most workouts that are dances is that the dances tend to not be very good.  If they look bad on the professionals doing them, or at least are not interesting, why would *you* want to do them?  The obvious answer is that you won't.  So, when I saw the moves for these set of DVDs, I had to have them.  They are feminine, beautiful, and leave me feeling like I'm elegant and fit when I'm done.  The only reason they don't get five stars from me is because the moves are a little tricky (as in, if you haven't done them before, just watching the DVD you won't be able to get them on the first try because it isn't clear what's happening).  If you really want it, the moves aren't *hard*; there just isn't any instruction of what you should feel if you're doing it right.  She just says, ""Do &lt;such and such> move!"" and you're like, ""W-what?""  And everyone else does them, but you're left going, ""Wait, what does that move entail?""  Not only that, but by the time you think you've figured it out in a slow pace, she's already moving on to doing it at full speed, so there isn't really a natural learning curve that most DVDs seem to have.  If you're an awesome dancer and need something fast-paced or are willing to put in the effort to figure it out and match their skill, this is for you.  It's definitely not for the weak-willed person who just wants the DVD to solve all their problems for them.So, I was disappointed by the lack of instruction and by the boring interviews (boring because they looked completely scripted and unnatural to me), but otherwise absolutely LOVE this DVD set and would recommend it to any of my friends in a heart-beat.",4,Oo...

The rotuines are fun, sexy and with repeated viewings, easy to learn. I take jazz dance classes so I was probably a bit more familiar with the terminology than other people. But hang in there, you'll get it! Also, you may need a little extra room to accomodate the turns in the routines.I can't wait to try the other DVDs, if Jazz was any indication, then I'm sure the others will be great too!Update: I have tried to Yoga and Pilates DVD in this set also. I preferred the Pilates one a little more. It was a bit more challenging and I found that I felt more like I ""worked out"". The Yoga DVD was good also, but probably my least favorite.
