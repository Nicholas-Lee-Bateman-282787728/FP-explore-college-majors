It is reminiscent of ""Lackawanna Blues"" though not as intense.The acting was wonderful.  Each actor/actress was able to bring their characters to life in very believable ways.It is a family film that not only could be viewed by every member of the family, but it SHOULD be watched by everyone.It is more than just historically accurate, or a lesson in history, but it shows the humanity of people during a very difficult time.  It portrays people at their best and worst with out foul language, sex or violence!The movie is more than just a feel good movie, it is like a breath of fresh air, and has several strong messages about perseverance, inner strength, and just having the courage to stand up for what's right.  It also teaches that everyone has their own story and something to tell if we just give them a chance.  Talk about not judging a book by its cover!While watching the movie I laughed, felt sad and anger, and at the end I didn't know whether to smile or cry!This is definitely one of those highly underrated great movies!",5,Wonderful movie,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,1106,"['movie', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'reminiscent', 'Lackawanna', 'Blues', 'though', 'not', 'intense.The', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actor/actress', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'very', 'believable', 'ways.It', 'family', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'member', 'family', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'watched', 'everyone.It', 'more', 'just', 'historically', 'accurate', 'lesson', 'history', 'humanity', 'people', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'people', 'best', 'worst', 'out', 'foul', 'language', 'sex', 'violence', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'several', 'strong', 'messages', 'perseverance', 'inner', 'strength', 'just', 'having', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'also', 'everyone', 'own', 'story', 'something', 'tell', 'just', 'give', 'chance', 'Talk', 'not', 'judging', 'book', 'cover', 'watching', 'movie', 'laughed', 'felt', 'sad', 'anger', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'smile', 'cry', 'definitely', 'one', 'highly', 'underrated', 'great', 'movies']",N/A

We talk about times being hard today, but I can only imagine how it was back then by watching this film. Folks try to describe not being able to eat, not being able to hold a job, wearing clothes that don't fit, not throwing away food, drinking off someone else's liquor that they left behind, those were some hard times. You have this young man Homer Hobbs(Tyson Beckford) that just come off the line(prison chain gang) and goes to his hometown and run into Booker(Reginald T.Dorsey) while he's getting a meal, and even though he's a con, he hooks him up with a meal,a place to stay and a job. At the place, he meets Miss Gracie Miracle(Lynn Whitfield),a former chorus girl who know runs the boarding house they live in; Clarence(Glynn Thurman),and Lucy(Linara Washington)who show Homer the ropes and is sweet on him but have troubles of her own. Together, they fight the good with the bad. The part that had me sad was Clarence in his room with a little old piece of garland representing a Christmas tree and he's at the end of his rope. My heart went out to him because I am sure there are those who are going through theirs at present.Even though things got rough, Lucy going through some strong arming, Clarence finding himself, Grace losing her shed, Homer trying to find himself, things look up somehow. I believe the best thing about the movie is the Sunday night male fashion show, where the men dress their best and compete for the title of ""King of the Evening"" where the prize is a cool crisp $5. To me, that is the highlight of the movie because it shows me that no matter what, if you believe in yourself, you get up from the bottom, you have no where to go but up. Great movie and I hope that more people reach out for this movie especially now. Yes, it does get depressing, but it WAS the Depression.",5,Standout Movie,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,1902,"['was', 'blessed', 'see', 'film', 'yesterday', 'had', 'write', 'review', 'here', 'talk', 'times', 'being', 'hard', 'today', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'watching', 'film', 'Folks', 'try', 'describe', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'eat', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'hold', 'job', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'not', 'throwing', 'away', 'food', 'drinking', 'off', 'someone', 'else', 'liquor', 'left', 'behind', 'were', 'hard', 'times', 'have', 'young', 'man', 'Homer', 'Hobbs', 'Tyson', 'Beckford', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'line', 'prison', 'chain', 'gang', 'hometown', 'run', 'Booker', 'Reginald', 'T.Dorsey', 'getting', 'meal', 'even', 'con', 'up', 'meal', 'place', 'stay', 'job', 'place', 'Miss', 'Gracie', 'Miracle', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'former', 'chorus', 'girl', 'who', 'know', 'boarding', 'house', 'live', 'Clarence', 'Glynn', 'Thurman', 'Lucy', 'Linara', 'Washington', 'who', 'show', 'Homer', 'ropes', 'sweet', 'have', 'troubles', 'own', 'Together', 'fight', 'good', 'bad', 'part', 'had', 'sad', 'was', 'Clarence', 'room', 'little', 'old', 'piece', 'garland', 'representing', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'end', 'rope', 'My', 'heart', 'went', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'theirs', 'present.Even', 'things', 'got', 'rough', 'Lucy', 'going', 'strong', 'arming', 'Clarence', 'finding', 'Grace', 'losing', 'shed', 'Homer', 'trying', 'find', 'things', 'look', 'up', 'somehow', 'believe', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Sunday', 'night', 'male', 'fashion', 'show', 'where', 'men', 'dress', 'best', 'compete', 'title', 'King', 'Evening', 'where', 'prize', 'cool', 'crisp', '5', 'highlight', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'believe', 'get', 'up', 'bottom', 'have', 'where', 'go', 'up', 'Great', 'movie', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'reach', 'out', 'movie', 'especially', 'now', 'Yes', 'get', 'depressing', 'WAS', 'Depression']",N/A
