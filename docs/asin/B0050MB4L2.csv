1435325,AWMUGLMTV1JBL,B0050MB4L2,"Paul H. Fackler ""eclectic hermit""","[3, 5]","Troy was good, though not terribly true to The Iliad, as it was more of a 'historical' movie than a 'mythological' one.  Good acting.Alexander sucked.  Oliver Stone made Alexander a bi-sexual, and I wasn't expecting an ancient Brokeback Mountain (which I didn't see or want to).Antony And Cleopatra had mostly Shakespearian actors rather than Hollywood stars, and was very well done.  Charleton Heston directed as well as starred.Clash Of The Titans was really out of place, being very mythological versus historical, but nonetheless very well done.  The heroine wasn't a 'screamer' like most females facing monsters usually are, which was nice.  Lots of big-name stars.Excellent quality DVD, with Clash Of The Titans being the least visually (and oldest).  Any one of the films (except Alexander) would have been worth the price.",4,Three out of four for a cheap price ain't bad,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,830,"['Troy', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'terribly', 'true', 'Iliad', 'was', 'more', ""'historical"", 'movie', ""'mythological"", 'one', 'Good', 'acting.Alexander', 'sucked', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'made', 'Alexander', 'bi-sexual', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'ancient', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'want', '.Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'had', 'mostly', 'Shakespearian', 'actors', 'rather', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'directed', 'as', 'well', 'starred.Clash', 'Titans', 'was', 'really', 'place', 'being', 'very', 'mythological', 'versus', 'historical', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'heroine', 'was', ""n't"", ""'screamer"", 'most', 'females', 'facing', 'monsters', 'usually', 'are', 'was', 'nice', 'Lots', 'big-name', 'stars.Excellent', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'being', 'least', 'visually', 'oldest', 'one', 'films', 'Alexander', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'price']",4 Film Favorites: Epic Adventures (Alexander / Antony & Cleopatra / Clash of the Titans / Troy)
