The shows centers itself around the friendly neighborhood Boston bar named Cheers. The bar is owned by former Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Sam has three employees - bartender Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto) and waitresses Carla Tortelli (Rhea Pearlman) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). Season 3 witnesses the edition of popular cast member Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Frasier Crane (who would later spawn his own series spin-off, Frasier). Regular barflies Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) round out a strong supporting cast.The Cheers (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes and begins the ascent of Dr. Frasier Crane, imminent psychologist, as a television icon. Notably, Dr. Crane's stint on Cheers was originally intended to last for only a few episodes until his character became a regular cast member (similar to John Ratzenberger's ascent on the show). Michael Richards (Kramer from the hit show Seinfeld) makes a notable guest appearance in episode # 62. Following her breakup with Sam and abandonment of Cheers, Diane returns to the bar at the request of Coach who feels it will help Sam end his problem drinking. The Sam-Diane-Frasier love triangle lasts for the entirety of the season, culminating in the final episode where Frasier proposes to Diane while the two are on a trip across the European continent...Below is a list of episodes included on the Cheers (Season 3) DVD:Episode 45 (Rebound: Part 1)Episode 46 (Rebound: Part 2)Episode 47 (I Call Your Name)Episode 48 (Fairy Tales Can Come True)Episode 49 (Sam Turns the Other Cheek)Episode 50 (Coach in Love: Part 1)Episode 51 (Coach in Love: Part 2)Episode 52 (Diane Meets Mom)Episode 53 (An American Family)Episode 54 (Diane's Allergy)Episode 55 (Peterson Crusoe)Episode 56 (A Ditch in Time)Episode 57 (Whodunit?)Episode 58 (The Heart is a Lonely Snipe Hunter)Episode 59 (King of the Hill)Episode 60 (Teacher's Pet)Episode 61 (The Mail Goes to Jail)Episode 62 (Bar Bet)Episode 63 (Behind Every Great Man)Episode 64 (If Ever I Would Leave You)Episode 65 (The Executive's Executioner)Episode 66 (Cheerio, Cheers)Episode 67 (The Bartender's Tale)Episode 68 (The Belles of St. Clete's)Episode 69 (Rescue Me)The DVD Report",5,One of the greatest sitcoms in television history!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2430,"['One', 'greatest', 'television', 'comedies', 'history', 'Cheers', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'regular', 'hangout', 'where', 'everybody', 'name', 'shows', 'centers', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Boston', 'bar', 'named', 'Cheers', 'bar', 'owned', 'former', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'relief', 'pitcher', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Sam', 'three', 'employees', 'bartender', 'Ernie', 'Coach', 'Pantusso', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', 'Carla', 'Tortelli', 'Rhea', 'Pearlman', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Season', '3', 'edition', 'popular', 'cast', 'member', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Dr.', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'spawn', 'own', 'series', 'spin-off', 'Frasier', 'Regular', 'barflies', 'Norm', 'Peterson', 'George', 'Wendt', 'Cliff', 'Clavin', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'round', 'out', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast.The', 'Cheers', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'ascent', 'Dr.', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'imminent', 'psychologist', 'television', 'icon', 'Notably', 'Dr.', 'Crane', 'stint', 'Cheers', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'last', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'character', 'became', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', 'similar', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'ascent', 'show', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'Kramer', 'hit', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'notable', 'guest', 'appearance', 'episode', '62', 'Following', 'breakup', 'Sam', 'abandonment', 'Cheers', 'Diane', 'bar', 'request', 'Coach', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'Sam', 'end', 'problem', 'drinking', 'Sam-Diane-Frasier', 'love', 'triangle', 'entirety', 'season', 'culminating', 'final', 'episode', 'where', 'Frasier', 'Diane', 'two', 'are', 'trip', 'European', 'continent', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Cheers', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '45', 'Rebound', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '46', 'Rebound', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '47', 'Call', 'Name', 'Episode', '48', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'Can', 'Come', 'True', 'Episode', '49', 'Sam', 'Turns', 'Other', 'Cheek', 'Episode', '50', 'Coach', 'Love', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '51', 'Coach', 'Love', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '52', 'Diane', 'Meets', 'Mom', 'Episode', '53', 'American', 'Family', 'Episode', '54', 'Diane', 'Allergy', 'Episode', '55', 'Peterson', 'Crusoe', 'Episode', '56', 'Ditch', 'Time', 'Episode', '57', 'Whodunit', 'Episode', '58', 'Heart', 'Lonely', 'Snipe', 'Hunter', 'Episode', '59', 'King', 'Hill', 'Episode', '60', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'Episode', '61', 'Mail', 'Goes', 'Jail', 'Episode', '62', 'Bar', 'Bet', 'Episode', '63', 'Every', 'Great', 'Man', 'Episode', '64', 'Ever', 'Would', 'Leave', '65', 'Executive', 'Executioner', 'Episode', '66', 'Cheerio', 'Cheers', 'Episode', '67', 'Bartender', 'Tale', 'Episode', '68', 'Belles', 'St.', 'Clete', 'Episode', '69', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'DVD', 'Report']",Cheers - The Complete Third Season

In a wee little six minute segment, Ted Danson (who can't seem to keep his facts straight -- Nick died in February, not ""over the summer""), Rhea Perlman and George Wendt talk about what a wonderful, sweet man Nick was and the impact he had on their lives and the show. Ted says it best when he declares that Nick was ""all the sweetness in 'Cheers.'""(On a related note, the decline of Nick's health is evident in the show itself, as Coach loses weight and almost loses his voice, which make some of the episodes hard to watch, although Nick gave an Emmy-worthy performance until the very end.)Despite my little grumbles about the continuing lack of good extras, I still have to give this set five stars, as the quality of the show itself it just stellar.

Perhaps his best episode is when the guys reluctantly take him fishing, but leave him holding the bag in a snipe hunt. He turns the tables on them in the end, though. In the last episode cliff-hanger, he proposes to Diane.We also meet Carla's ex-husband, Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya), who is only a few rungs up the evolutionary ladder. He has a new blond bombshell bimbo wife &quot;Low-Ret-ta&quot;. He appears in a few episodes, and is possibly the funniest character of all.The special features are so-so overall:1. Virtual Vera, Shrink-Warped: Introducing Frasier Crane, and Carla's Whipping Boy are just short clips of/about those characters from the episodes. Nothing new at all.2. Cheers Bar Tour - in this, Dahl Delu talks about some of the items found around the bar, such as the Indian statue, the piano, etc. It becomes filler at the end, however, when clicking on the soda-fizzer, cash-register and ice-box only results in sound effects. Worst of all, clicking on the juke-box results in hearing the theme song for the 26th time.3. Nice piece on Nicholas Colasanto (&quot;Coach&quot;) who died shortly after the season ended.This is probably the best season so far.",4,Another round...,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,1581,"['quot', 'Cheers', 'quot', 'highly-rated', 'sit-com', 'based', 'characters', 'who', 'frequent', 'Boston', 'bar', 'same', 'name', 'owned', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'ex-professional', 'baseball', 'pitcher', 'recovering', 'alcoholic.In', 'third', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'waitress', 'Diane', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'post-Sam', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'snooty', 'psychologist', 'who', 'handful', 'episodes', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'episode', 'when', 'guys', 'reluctantly', 'take', 'fishing', 'leave', 'holding', 'bag', 'snipe', 'hunt', 'tables', 'end', 'though', 'last', 'episode', 'cliff-hanger', 'Diane.We', 'also', 'meet', 'Carla', 'ex-husband', 'Nick', 'Tortelli', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'who', 'only', 'few', 'rungs', 'evolutionary', 'ladder', 'new', 'blond', 'bombshell', 'wife', 'quot', 'Low-Ret-ta', 'quot', 'few', 'episodes', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'character', 'all.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'so-so', 'overall:1', 'Virtual', 'Vera', 'Shrink-Warped', 'Introducing', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'Carla', 'Whipping', 'Boy', 'are', 'just', 'short', 'clips', 'characters', 'episodes', 'Nothing', 'new', 'all.2', 'Cheers', 'Bar', 'Tour', 'Dahl', 'Delu', 'talks', 'items', 'found', 'bar', 'such', 'Indian', 'statue', 'piano', 'etc', 'filler', 'end', 'however', 'when', 'clicking', 'soda-fizzer', 'cash-register', 'ice-box', 'only', 'results', 'sound', 'effects', 'Worst', 'clicking', 'juke-box', 'results', 'hearing', 'theme', 'song', '26th', 'time.3', 'Nice', 'piece', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', 'quot', 'Coach', 'quot', 'who', 'died', 'shortly', 'season', 'ended.This', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'so', 'far']",Cheers - The Complete Third Season

811974,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B0001NBNIY,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[1, 1]","Fully established as a sitcom powerhouse, the third season of Cheers would end in sadness. During filming, Nicholas Colasanto, who played the loveable Coach, discovered he was dying. Told he had only six months to live, he would pass away six weeks later, leaving a gaping hole in the cast. With three episodes left in the season, it was explained that Coach had gone on vacation. During it's orginal airtime, in the pre-title bumper joke of the final episode, an out-take of Colasanto was inserted as a farewell.I do sympathize with reviews posted feeling the Featurette in memory of Coach should and could have been more extenstive.For a character as beloved as Coach and an actor/director/producer so respected as Nicholas Colasanto, you'd think someone would honor him with more than a six minute blurb, most of time simply showing clips. Ted Danson and George Wendt talked briefly and emotionally about Colasanto, including the revelation to most that Colasanto directed a number of shows, including Columbo, Bonanza, Starsky and Hutch. Although I suppose the truest form of honor to his spirit is the fact that over 20 years later people are still enjoying his work.However, the series continued to grow in the third season, with the addition of Dr. Frasier Crane as Diane's boy-friend / therapist. Kelsey Grammer's refined psychiatrist would become a major character in his own right, leading to the titular spin-off.  Talk about a perfect fit ... Frasier seemingly effortlessly fits into the cast. His voice of reasoning fell on deaf ears in this screwball ensemble.  The writing for his character through out the show is priceless.Beginning with Sam drinking to excess again and ending with a wedding cliff-hanger, the third season is a notable year for the series, producing some of the best episodes in the show's entire 250 episode run.",5,IT'S A LITTLE KNOWN  FACT ....,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,1848,"['Fully', 'established', 'sitcom', 'powerhouse', 'third', 'season', 'Cheers', 'would', 'end', 'sadness', 'filming', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', 'who', 'played', 'loveable', 'Coach', 'discovered', 'was', 'dying', 'Told', 'had', 'only', 'six', 'months', 'live', 'would', 'pass', 'away', 'six', 'weeks', 'later', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'hole', 'cast', 'three', 'episodes', 'left', 'season', 'was', 'explained', 'Coach', 'had', 'gone', 'vacation', 'orginal', 'airtime', 'pre-title', 'bumper', 'joke', 'final', 'episode', 'out-take', 'Colasanto', 'was', 'inserted', 'farewell.I', 'do', 'sympathize', 'reviews', 'posted', 'feeling', 'Featurette', 'memory', 'Coach', 'should', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'extenstive.For', 'character', 'as', 'beloved', 'Coach', 'actor/director/producer', 'so', 'respected', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', ""'d"", 'think', 'someone', 'would', 'honor', 'more', 'six', 'minute', 'blurb', 'most', 'time', 'simply', 'showing', 'clips', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'George', 'Wendt', 'talked', 'briefly', 'emotionally', 'Colasanto', 'including', 'revelation', 'most', 'Colasanto', 'directed', 'number', 'shows', 'including', 'Columbo', 'Bonanza', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'suppose', 'truest', 'form', 'honor', 'spirit', 'fact', '20', 'years', 'later', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'enjoying', 'work.However', 'series', 'continued', 'grow', 'third', 'season', 'addition', 'Dr.', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'Diane', 'boy-friend', '/', 'therapist', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'refined', 'psychiatrist', 'would', 'become', 'major', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'leading', 'titular', 'spin-off', 'Talk', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Frasier', 'seemingly', 'effortlessly', 'cast', 'voice', 'reasoning', 'fell', 'deaf', 'ears', 'screwball', 'ensemble', 'writing', 'character', 'show', 'priceless.Beginning', 'Sam', 'drinking', 'excess', 'again', 'ending', 'wedding', 'cliff-hanger', 'third', 'season', 'notable', 'year', 'series', 'producing', 'best', 'episodes', 'show', 'entire', '250', 'episode', 'run']",Cheers - The Complete Third Season
