860329,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00064MW6A,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 6]","You know the old saying, ""Do not change horses mid-race"", well I think that heavily applies to this film.  I think the biggest hurdle that most of us had to overcome in this film was that Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer.  Most of us are still a generation of Batman Returns fans, as well as Tim Burton's darkness, and Halle just couldn't fit those shoes.  Pfeiffer gave us this unbridled performance as this tormented woman who is given a rebirth by some cats, while Berry continually felt as if she was just going through the motions in order to try to be cooler than Pfeiffer was.  You could see the competition going on in the film, and it hurt the overall story and characters.  I will agree, this film had a very weak plot, but with the right person behind the mask of Catwoman, this could have been a decent film.  Sadly, Berry just didn't put the force into it that I felt Pfeiffer did.  There wasn't enough passion in the eyes, just this uncanny ability to act like a cat.  Catwoman was more than ""just a cat"", she was this troubled soul that had to deal with both the good side of her actions as well as the devilish.  That is what never came through with Berry.Outside of the complete miscast of Halle Berry, there were a couple other points that I just felt cheated after watching the film.  The scene where the cat breaths on Halle was too eerily like Ralph Wiggum's ""My cat's breath smells like cat food"" moment.  I kept waiting to hear that whenever possible.  It would have granted this film one additional star more.  Sadly, we had to live with what was in this film, and not what wasn't.  What was in this film was shoddy acting, a very flimsy script, and scenario after scenario that just didn't seem to work.  I realize the Pitof (the director) was trying to show a very feminine film that could be seen as a feminist picture, but to me it just didn't work.  All of the sudden this cat brings out what Patience couldn't in the past?  Suddenly, with the quick breath of a cat, she could play basketball better than ever, crack a whip, and drive a motorcycle.  There was no development here, just plain assumption.  I needed more development of this character instead of just this light-speed characterization that lead nowhere.Another element that didn't brood well with me were the villains.  Who were they?  What was their purpose behind their situations?  Without giving us any of this information, we can only assume that they really weren't evil and that perhaps Catwoman was caught up in this big misunderstanding?  I know that is far fetched, but honestly Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson were not that sinister.  Sure, every company that you work for has that boss that is not going to treat you with the greatest of respect, but does that make him the super-villain?  Then you have Sharon Stone with this pathetic super power that works and doesn't work half the time.  I just didn't care at this point what Catwoman was to do to stop the corporation.  It was this huge dilemma that I could have solved quickly by perhaps incorporating something about the Umbrella Corporation and a tie into Resident Evil 3.  Anything could have been better than what Pitof presented here.The themes were also as jumbled as a child's playroom.  Scattered throughout this picture you had different themes that never quite tied into the big solution.  There were the feminist issues, the skin care/growing old is ""ok"" theme, the dual personalities and to live life to the fullest moments, and then there was the pro-self sidesteps that just never took us anywhere.  It was like bobbing for themes in this mess.  Nearly every five minutes, Pitof would present to us either a new theme or an older one that should have been dropped, but instead found itself back in the picture.  It became increasingly clear with these scattered themes why Berry couldn't quite capture her character.  There were supposed to be several layers to her character, but instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover.  This caused both problems for the film itself as well as for the audience forced to sit through this mess.  I mean who wants to visit a place of rest and have to clean up before being able to enjoy it.  Not me, and that is how I felt with this film.  I felt that it was this huge mess that Pitof created and wanted me to clean up.  It was pathetic.Overall, I was not happy with this film.  Either Pfeiffer should have been in it or it should have been shelved.  With the growing business behind superheroes in today's cinema, Hollywood studios will have to pick and choose which ones they think will be big.  You cannot release them all, and it proves with the attempt to capitalize on this small hero that ultimately failed.  I hate to go with the rest of the critics with this one, but I just did not enjoy the final result.  The costume, the style, the themes, and the acting all put a hinder on this film that was unrepairable from the beginning.  This is a perfect example of a film that should have been scrapped from the beginning instead of rushed to theaters.

Specially the fight in the jewelry store.  I just hated the corny dialogue ex. ""It's overtime!""  Corny!!!I agree a better villain could have been better, but Sharon did a good job.  I love Sharon.  Maybe if she were a sci fi villain instead of a normal person with a face of marble.  Anyway, there are worse things in this movie:Editing, don't know if it was the directors fault but I hate choppy movies ex. Moulin Rouge etc...Soundtrack, horrible. I hate the whole pussycat doll wailing in the background.  Would have been better just classical film soundtrack.Costume, the mask was ugly, the pants were ok I guess don't like the bell bottom look.  I agree with others that the costume she wore at the jewelry store was much better.  I liked seeing her hair and the mask was cute.So finally her acting.  It was great, you people associate everything horrible in the movie with her but it's not her fault.  Her acting was not bad at all.  The dialogue and corny lines are the faults.  But again not all her lines were bad.She had the cool right cat attitude.  Her movements were great, specially when she wakes up from death, just like a cat watching and playing with something.  Her changes from geek to cool to bad were right on and her emotions were shown when needed.So my challenge to the makers in hollywood is to give Catwoman another chance.  Do a remake like the hulk with Halle even.

It wasn't as bad as I expected, but I can understand the criticism.When you say, ""Catwoman"", most people also think, ""Batman"".  The whole Catwoman story intersects with the Caped Crusader's story line.  This film does not.  This is a stand alone flick that twists several accepted plots.  This Catwoman has super powers that are more like Spiderman's.  The Catwoman I grew up with had mental powers and agility that were a match for the Batman.  The special effects of this film looked more like the effects in The Hulk than the dark edgy Gotham City we have grown accustomed to.However, if I had not had a preconceived prejudice to overcome I would have liked the film more.  If this film had gathered enough attention to warrant a sequel, it would have been fun to watch Halle Berry play up Catwoman's fascination with Batman.  Alas, the film fell just a little short for that to happen.It was a gamble, but I imagine this film is destined to set for a long time in the reduced price section at your local department stores, waiting for the occasional Halle Berry fan to pick it up and regularly overlooked by the Batman fans.

The most recent comparison would of course have to be Michelle Pfeiffer as the leather clad feline fighter in Tim Burtons Batman Returns, and whereas I understand characters must evolve with the times, they should not be changed altogether. Pfeiffer and Burton came close to encapsulating the multi faceted role, whereas this time around the production team and director seem to have missed by a mile. Ms Berry plays Patience Phillips, a Plain Jane artist, seeking her inner self, and trapped working for a large cosmetic conglomerate as a designer. She overhears something bad about the companies latest product and is dispatched forthwith, by the villainous Sharon Stone, as wife to the head of the company. Reborn with the aid of a mystical Egyptian Mau cat, and a seemingly all wise ""little old lady"" she emerges as Catwoman, and sets about bringing her erstwhile foes to justice, and in so doing discover her true self. The visual distraction of her in a costume that would have fried the censors back in the 60's may be enough for adolescents, or the less demanding viewer, but this is a pretty poor attempt really. The darkness and depth of the Marvel creation is never seen, as Ms Berry plays out a little girl lost turned Vigilante with a muddled ambivalence. Staying well inside the Politically Correct (PC) line, she is almost shown as a goody two shoes, reluctantly playing a part and keeping everyone happy, rather than getting inside the storybook character. Another BIG complaint for me is the CGI fusion with live action. Much like the ""Blade"" movies, seeing a cartoon computer overlay scramble up walls, flip, turn, jump and perform inhuman stunts doesn't work I'm afraid, even if you do seemlessly match it with the actor in places. Even impressive SfX should compliment a films story,  NOT try and carry it altogether. There are some nice extra's on the DVD however, and the story is not too ridiculous. The supporting cast are sound, and the visuals OK, but you keep feeling that the script writer and director should have taken the plunge a little more, rather than just dipping their toes into an Iconic character such as they have here.

Actually, I found it full of redeeming qualities and quite entertaining.The story has been discussed, but I actually felt a sense of empathy in the idea of Halle Berry (who I met in Charleston when she was filming ""Queen"" and later in Columbia during ""The Program"") as the overtly insecure Patience finding herself and reaching her true potential as a human being as Cat Woman very appealing. I like the idea of my neices (and hopefully one day my daughters) seeing this ""girl power"" message to identify with. A lot of people could relate to the idea of being very shy and withdrawn and longing for the ability to break free from such emotional confines. How can you not cheer at Halle Berry standing up to her evil boss and the wild partygoers who disturb her sleep?The biz about the cat ""Midnight"" breathing life to her after her murder and the interlocking of ancient cat mythology is a nice bit of added hokum that makes it entertaining. It's clear that this movie is not taking itself too seriously, a point a lot of people seem to miss.The actress who plays Halle's boy-crazy buddy who encourages her to take a walk on the wild side is a nice added bit of comic relief.Plus, you could actually enjoy this movie as a family. The action and fight scenes (I will admit that the constant angle shifts are a bit much) are not of the stomach-turning guts hanging out gross-out variety, there is hardly any cursing, and the sensuality is handled in a classy-not-trashy fashion.Overall, while it's not a great film, it's a good one.

Seriously, i was on in a fitworks dark room and I ended up going on the exercise machine for the entire hour and a half. Never happened before and will never happen again, but I just couldn't bring myself to leave.So, basically, what was everyone expecting?  An award winning Titanic?  I mean, it's called ""catwoman"" and has halle berry in a tight leather cat suit.  Give it a break.  It's fun, action packed entertainment with a really really corny plot. So go into it, knowing what it is, and don't be so hard on it.

They were like, wow, that's cool.  More if you're an artsy type of person but they were just, very pretty.  And the romance was surprisingly cute. I really liked seeing the two of them on the screen.My one and only complaint is that i have a cat and this movie had the most uncat like catwoman ever.  Dont know if you've ever seen the batman catwoman, but now that was a cat.  She's like ""meow"" and struts around real slow hitting things.  Doesn't move too much.This catwoman crawled on ceilings and moved at lightening speeds, hopping on walls.  My cat has still never done that, and I dont know too many cats that do. She also kept jumping around and moving and doing acrobat flips and couldn't sit still for a single second, while my cat just sleeps in a ball for seventeen hours a day, stretches, then moves somewhere else and goes back to sleep.  Cats don't move ever. Make a mental note of that should catwoman ever be reborn for the third time. they also fit like, one half a kitty nibble in their mouth at a time, and lick at the surface juice of a can of cat food. they don't shove in a dozen giant shrimps.

860347,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B00064MW6A,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[4, 6]","I didn't have a chance to see this movie when it came out in theaters but didn't think I missed out on much because most said this was a horrible film. After seeing it, I'm not sure what all the complaints and talk were about. This isn't Oscar worthy or cutting edge like one of the 80s ""Superman"" flims but it is not as bad as, say, ""The Hulk.""First, this isn't based on the Catwoman that appears in the ""Batman"" series. It's based on the character as she is seen in the independent series. It doesn't take place in Gotham, it doesn't rely on any nods or ties to ""Batman"" and that comic book series. Perhaps that makes it hard for people to accept.The movie starts off a bit slow. You aren't confronted with action and her big transformation until a little bit into the movie. The movie takes the time to establish who this character is; where she came from, the problems she faces in her ordinary life, what leads to her transformation. Then, unlike many comic book genre movies, it seems to try to be more realistic and base Catwoman in historic terms. These parts are a little slow and dragging, but they are essential. There are some interesting things established that sets ""Catwoman"" apart from other films like it. There is a nod to the ""Batman"" franchise; you can see a photo of Michelle P.'s Catwoman from ""Batman Returns.""There are some rather cheesey script moments but it doesn't take away from the story all that much. Berry really got into the role of ""Catwoman."" She seemed to struggle in the early scenes before she's undergone her transformation but it doesn't take much time for her to put a spin on the Catwoman role. There are some parts in the film where you can see some unscripted moments; parts where she is fully into the mind-set of this character that isn't restrained and doesn't know where her place is in the world. The parts where she did her own stunts (you can watch these in the special features) makes the film even better. The computer generated Catwoman isn't great (you can tell this isn't close to being a real person) but it is not as bad as the computer generated Hulk from a few years back.The supporting actors like Benjamin B., Sharon Stone, and Berry's friend in her office are all at the top of their game. The story may be predictable in some parts, but there are many unexpected moments and scenes that are all very interesting and worthy of a little praise.This is not an award-winner but it is far from the worse film ever made. I think people came into this expecting another ""Monster's Ball"" performance but hey, it's ""Catwoman."" It is meant to be a little fun, a little comic-booky and quite different from most films. There's action and some really amusing scenes. Berry obviously invested herself into this film and adds a little range to her character. This is in no way a continuation of the character that appeared in ""Batman Returns"" but the film does a good job in creating and establishing a unique and original Cat-woman. The main conflict is something a bit different as well; Catwoman takes on a woman in her 40s who (like many in Hollywood) is facing the end of her career due to her age.This is a film worth watching and is far from being as bad as some of these reviewers have said it to be.

I believed that every comic book based film should be as great as Spiderman or X-Men.Then there are movies like Catwoman where the plot isn't as strong as Spiderman, the characters aren't as interesting as the X-Men, and the action isn't as great as the Matrix. And so what. Catwoman is an example of a good old fashioned adventure movie. It's the story of a woman who dies, is ressurected by an ancient cat, and seeks revenge against her murderer. Simple, basic, uncomplicated. That kind of movie where you don't need a dictionary or a psychiatric degree to figure stuff out.It's easy to point out the bad but let's look at the good. It's an action film with a female lead and I'm sorry to say because we really should be beyond that whole issue but it's also an important point that she is a black female lead. It's funny, it's sexy, it's exciting, and the story may not be Oscar calibur but it doesn't suck. And as a Catwoman fan I was glad that though there were some crazy changes the essence of the character remained true. She was still independent, fearless, and had the whip, ha ha.If anything I wish that Sharon Stone had more scenes. I think she was great as the really bad girl. I also loved that she wasn't one dimensional. She represented those beautiful women who are deemed obsolete when compared to some 18 year old fetus tripping down the runway. She was as much a victim as Patience. And Patience's friend Sally was great. Would've loved to seen more of her.So Catwoman is a great, fun movie that actually has a couple of important moral lessons to teach and I hope there is a sequel!",4,lighten up,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,1734,"[""'m"", 'one', 'kind', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'see', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'expect', 'see', 'everything', 'movie', 'comic', 'believed', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'Spiderman', 'X-Men.Then', 'are', 'movies', 'Catwoman', 'where', 'plot', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'Spiderman', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'X-Men', 'action', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'Matrix', 'so', 'what', 'Catwoman', 'example', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'adventure', 'movie', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'ressurected', 'ancient', 'cat', 'revenge', 'murderer', 'Simple', 'basic', 'uncomplicated', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'dictionary', 'psychiatric', 'degree', 'figure', 'stuff', 'out.It', 'easy', 'point', 'out', 'bad', 'let', 'look', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'female', 'lead', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'whole', 'issue', 'also', 'important', 'point', 'black', 'female', 'lead', 'funny', 'sexy', 'exciting', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Oscar', 'calibur', ""n't"", 'suck', 'Catwoman', 'fan', 'was', 'glad', 'were', 'crazy', 'changes', 'essence', 'character', 'remained', 'true', 'was', 'still', 'independent', 'fearless', 'had', 'whip', 'ha', 'ha.If', 'anything', 'wish', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'had', 'more', 'scenes', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'really', 'bad', 'girl', 'also', 'loved', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'dimensional', 'represented', 'beautiful', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'deemed', 'obsolete', 'when', 'compared', '18', 'year', 'old', 'fetus', 'tripping', 'down', 'runway', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'victim', 'Patience', 'Patience', 'friend', 'Sally', 'was', 'great', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'seen', 'more', 'her.So', 'Catwoman', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', 'actually', 'couple', 'important', 'moral', 'lessons', 'teach', 'hope', 'sequel']",N/A

First off, the acting is somewhat decent. The story moves along, making the picture to be watchable. On the other hand, the directing effort, especially by (gee whiz...the name) Pitof is horrendous. The way the scenes were...shot...shot...shot...shot...in an extremely rapid fashion. It's too sophomoric for a director with an infantile, silly name. Moreover, Catwoman depended too much on unnecessary computer graphics work. Less is more. Repeat after me, less is more. Got it? For about an hour or so, there were way too many cheesy scenes, but Catwoman got better thereafter and ends fairly well. I see a lot of potential in Catwoman, and I wouldn't mind if there was a part two. Of course, it's nice to see a picture with very little profanity, but there were too much sexual innuendos thrown in. For example, in poor taste, was basketball sex in front of second graders! Come on, decency is needed. My suggestion to improve Catwoman is to cut out much of the computer graphics work and just let Catwoman be a normal picture. Really, Catwoman is better off that way. I think I would keep the acting and the story intact because it's not bad at all. While maintaining the profanity level at a low level, it would be nice to cut out the cheesiness and keep the sexual stuff, subtle or not, at minimum. Overall, probably, Catwoman would have been much better.

She looked amazing, and I give that walk 4 stars.Its pretty sad that just anyone can have a movie made these days, and take advantage of the already existing fan base by conjuring up a lame shallow version of a character that someone spend ALOT of time and energy and love building via comics.  Wu-Tang said CREAM (cash rules everything around me).  This is soooo true.  And it rules to the detriment of creativity.  A marble-faced villain who gained her powers from moisturizer?  Sharon Stone's career must be hurting right about now to accept this role. A cosmetic company out to rule the world? I'd buy resurrection by cat breath before L'Oreal global domination. Hey, did anyone see the similarities between this and the original Batman (Tim Burton) story?  Cosmetics driving people mad?  Very very unoriginal. At least Tim Burton made it cool.I'm not sure who this director Pitof is, but someone should smack the hell out of him.  He had almost no vision. And someone should smack the folks at DC comics for selling Bob Kane's creation to the highest bidder - Halle Berry.  Speaking of Halle again, I really dont respect her as an actress these days.  Her performance in Monster was overrated (make me feel goooooood!!!).  Her portrayal of Dorothy Danridge was pretty shallow.  Anybody see Rich Man's Wife?  Exactly my point.

860360,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B00064MW6A,Brian J Hay,"[1, 4]","This film should have been better. It has a decent cast. Sharon Stone and Halle Berry are both good actresses. Benjamin Bratt is generally a bit of a stock good-guy type but he's always relaxed enough to be convincing. The plot is perfect comic book material (which means it's right over the top with its insidious nature) and the 'look' given to the film is just larger enough than life to blend real with surreal.The problems start when the actors open their mouths. Benjamin Bratt is around to serve as a love interest, period. His job is to look good and smile or grimace at the right times. Sharon Stone's character has no depth at all. It just hisses (or coos patronizingly) according to the demands of the script. Lambert Wilson's character presents the face of corporate arrogance and nothing else. Both characters have no depth whatsoever. All they do is portray irredeemable evil that's varied only by gender code.Halle Berry fares only slightly better. She makes an alluring Catwoman and a demure figure as the character's alter ego but her role is severely limited as well. One side is soft and the other is hard. With only a few exceptions there's no middle ground in her character's duality. This has to be a studio decision. Writer Theresa Rebeck (Law and Order) is a far better writer than this and both Stone and Berry are far better actresses as well. Whatever the reasons for the lack of depth given to the characters, the film suffers for it.The film has other problems as well. A lot of the CGI appears to have been done in haste. The lighting effects that can be generated in 3D rendering are just lacking here. It makes the CGI sequences look like the hi-tech cartoons that they are. The soundtrack tries too hard to be hip and (at times) distracts from the film as opposed to enhancing it. Too much of the story is entirely predictable and the silhouette that closes film is unintentionally funny because of the action that precedes it.Catwoman isn't a complete loss. Even with the problems it has the film is still easy enough to sit back and enjoy. Unfortunately, there's seldom a moment where it doesn't seem as if it could be a lot better.",2,So Much Talent Wasted So Badly,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,2167,"['film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'decent', 'cast', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'are', 'good', 'actresses', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'generally', 'bit', 'stock', 'good-guy', 'type', 'always', 'relaxed', 'enough', 'be', 'convincing', 'plot', 'perfect', 'comic', 'book', 'material', 'right', 'top', 'insidious', 'nature', ""'look"", 'given', 'film', 'just', 'larger', 'enough', 'life', 'blend', 'real', 'surreal.The', 'problems', 'start', 'when', 'actors', 'open', 'mouths', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'serve', 'love', 'interest', 'period', 'job', 'look', 'good', 'smile', 'grimace', 'right', 'times', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'character', 'depth', 'just', 'coos', 'patronizingly', 'according', 'demands', 'script', 'Lambert', 'Wilson', 'character', 'face', 'corporate', 'arrogance', 'nothing', 'else', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'portray', 'irredeemable', 'evil', 'varied', 'only', 'gender', 'code.Halle', 'Berry', 'only', 'slightly', 'better', 'alluring', 'Catwoman', 'demure', 'figure', 'character', 'alter', 'ego', 'role', 'severely', 'limited', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'side', 'soft', 'other', 'hard', 'only', 'few', 'exceptions', 'middle', 'ground', 'character', 'duality', 'be', 'studio', 'decision', 'Writer', 'Theresa', 'Rebeck', 'Law', 'Order', 'far', 'better', 'writer', 'Stone', 'Berry', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'actresses', 'well', 'Whatever', 'reasons', 'lack', 'depth', 'given', 'characters', 'film', 'suffers', 'it.The', 'film', 'other', 'problems', 'well', 'lot', 'CGI', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'haste', 'lighting', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'generated', '3D', 'rendering', 'are', 'just', 'lacking', 'here', 'CGI', 'sequences', 'look', 'hi-tech', 'cartoons', 'are', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'hip', 'times', 'distracts', 'film', 'opposed', 'enhancing', 'Too', 'much', 'story', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'silhouette', 'film', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'action', 'it.Catwoman', ""n't"", 'complete', 'loss', 'Even', 'problems', 'film', 'still', 'easy', 'enough', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Unfortunately', 'seldom', 'moment', 'where', ""n't"", 'seem', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'better']",N/A

I read lots of reviews before posting this one, and still have things to add (although the review by Jane Rhynn ""Jane the Dervish"" offers pretty interesting insights). OVERVIEW: A woman acquires cat-like powers and finds herself fighting evil while also tempted to do some naughty things. This is no worse than most of the comic book movies from Batman to Spiderman, and most people who like super-hero movies will probably have fun watching this once, especially on DVD where you can do laundry or polish your shoes during the sillier parts. HIGHLIGHTS: I was pleased to see a sensual black woman -- the first since TV Batman's Eartha Kitt! -- play Catwoman. Yes, Michelle Pfeiffer was good as the Batman movie's tortured Catwoman, but Halle Berry's Catwoman is just as beautiful and more acrobatic and, well, even campier. The story starts with a promising mystical feel and tense story about an evil cosmetics company. Sharon Stone plays the aging company beauty just fine, another Faye Dunaway in the making. Benjamin Bratt is suitable in the modest role of cop/love interest. The cinematic and musical production values are pretty good, what you'd expect of a popcorn action film. LOWLIGHTS: Halle is a good actress but the script, direction and editing defeat her. Once Halle turns into catwoman, the movie changes into an overextended music video with frenetic cuts and exaggerated closeups. Fine for a 3-minute video, this filming style interferes with the story telling in a real movie. It's also distracting to have the star overdo the butt swaying and to have slinky cat movements sped up into jerky action hero moves. The movie harshly shifts tone and point of view, and in trying to cater to both men and women, actually fails both. For example, the shots of Halle's rear as she bounces a basketball with Benjamin are clearly inserted just to titillate the male factor. Such scenes embarrass many women who roll their eyes and wait for the story to move on.

The big difference is that Catwoman has lowered the required viewer IQ from age ten to age five.Even as a cartoon this concept would've flopped.Halle Berry does no more than show off her bod as she parades/poses narcissistically from start to finish, every now and then uttering a laughably forgettable line.  Sharon Stone, who loves to boast about making 'intelligent flicks' (you'd think she writes her own material!), is your stock villain with no more depth than Berry's plank-of-wood acting.  The rest of the cast is just as painfully resource-less.  (Whoever played the cop should not have been allowed to graduate from high school if he took a drama class.)The storyline treatment is a simplistic feminist yarn that reduces the cause to a bundle of overrehearsed gestures and slogans.  The jabs at the male-dominated system are caricaturesque at best, without a speck of insight or creativity.  If Berry and Stone thought they were somehow advancing the cause of women through parodic mainstream culture, they should stoop to read a book or take a course on the subject to get minimally educated (god forbid!).It is a sign o' the times:  celebrities and product such as these -- with nothing to offer besides hollow image and wasteful budgets -- being overly marketed and rewarded by an industry intent on lowering the bar.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 5]","------------------------------------Catwoman: Time to accessorize!=======================================================Catwoman was a box office bomb, and it also won a Razzie award for Halle Berry, which she accepted in person. The 'award' was for worst couple, shared with either of her costars--Sharon Stone or Benjamin Bratt. As much as I'd like to see Stone and Berry coupling, their hook up was more along the lines of hero and villain. Darn. Bratt, on the other hand, plays a cop who is fascinated by both Patience Philips AND Catwoman. Obviously he was cast more for his looks than his acting or ability to convincingly portray a cop. As Lance, Patience's colleague at the Beauty Products company proclaims when he pays Patience a visit:-----------------------Lance: Hey! Man sandwich! Twelve o'clock!====================================Benjamin has played similar roles in 'Miss Congeniality' with Sandra Bullock--where they were both cops and with Madonna as a yoga instructor in 'The Next Best Thing.' Bratt even won another Razzie for 'The Next Best Thing'--also for worst couple. In his defense I'd have to say that matching him with the Halle cat is not this movie's biggest problem. In fact, I have no problem whatsoever with the Bratt/Berry match.The problem with this movie is the writing. A real stupid script that makes no sense, and fails to create a compelling vision that might have made the audience forgive its lack of sense. Catwoman might have worked as a fable, with the mysterious character of Ophelia and her cats, especially Midnight, the Egyptian Mau, as a kind of witch's familiar. 'Edward Scissorhands' certainly doesn't make sense, but in the world that Tim Burton creates, it works as a fable, and we've never metaphor we didn't like. For another instance, in Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast when the Beast kills a bird and eats it smoke comes out of the poor bird. This makes no literal sense, but in the poetic, dream like fable, it makes perfect sense. 'Catwoman' was a character out of the Batman story, but in this movie there was no attempt to tie it in. Then they make her back story, and it is a stupid one for the kind of movie it could have been. Actually, I've seen Halle in this exact same situation, but in a different movie where her character worked. 'Boomerang' had her as a graphic artist somewhat oblivious to fashion though she worked at a beauty products company. I would be feeling that deja vu, except that in 'Catwoman' that character doesn't work.I can see what they were trying to do, Patience Philips, someone who does what she's told, suffers those of lesser talent ordering her around; until she becomes Catwoman, and is empowered. But really, the whole Beauty Products mogul as villain making the evil corporate face cream--please.Still, Halle Berry looked great in her leather cat suit, and I think that she did a great job with what she had to work with. She threw herself into the role, and really was the feral feline the role requires.------------------------Catwoman: White Russian, no ice, no vodka... hold the Kahlua.=======================================================Perhaps French director Pitof bit off more than he could chew (sorry, with a French director pretentious enough to go by a single name the pun temptation was irresistible). I heard that he turned in a script that he wrote with another writer that took a more artistic approach, but the producers didn't think it would be commercial enough. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt, because it seems hard to believe that his artistic approach could be any worse than the final product was.Sharon Stone can share some of the blame for the fiasco that was 'Catwoman.' It seems like her character was supposed to make a statement about how the fashion world, and Hollywood, too, treats women once they are past a certain age:----------------------------------Laurel Hedare: I was everything they wanted me to be. I was never more beautiful. Never more powerful. And then I turned 40 and they threw me away.=======================================================But you might say that she just rested on her Laurel. Word is that her cell phone rang while filming and she took the call. Talk about phoning it in.

There were several big budget spectacles that got critically(and commercially)massacred  during 2004(VAN HELSING, ALEXANDER, etc.), but I'm sorry to say that none deserved said ravagings more than CATWOMAN, a pale, soulless attempt at refashioning the comic book heroine/villainess that fails miserably on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start with regard to placing blame.For one, I'm not sure what poor Halle Berry was thinking when she read the threadbare script--was it actually once-upon-a-time decent and at some point re-written into the careless,  sophomoric bird cage liner(or for that matter litterbox liner)that ultimately ended up on screen?  Nothing about the characters or story are fleshed out--there is absolutely no rooting value or any remote reason as to why we or anyone would care about these characters--any sympathy offered by the audience is strictly for the poor actors who had the misfortune of being led to believe that this was actually a workable script.  As such, Berry doesn't stand a chance in the title role, and her straining attempts to get some grasp of the character just reinforces the brilliance of Michelle Pfeiffer's definitive take on the character in BATMAN RETURNS(and makes one truly wish that the initial concept of a Catwoman film with Pfeiffer had actually seen fruition).  Unfortunately, Berry isn't the only one lost here--Benjamin Bratt surfaces in his upteenth role as the boyfriend/love interest/straight female-gay male eye candy and basically sleepwalks(again)through a role that actually doesn't require much more than that, while Lambert Wilson as one of the film's villains is about as convincing in the role as..well, Berry as Catwoman.  As for Sharon Stone, she's Sharon Stone--though prone to occasional bouts of very fine acting(CASINO, THE MUSE), she doesn't seem to be in on the joke that her role was meant to be more over-the-top and instead tries to play it serious.  Only Alex Borstein, as Berry's gal pal, seems to get that this is far from a work of art and is actually in on the joke--she's the life of this very dull party. And I won't even tary long on the poorly staged action sequences or the cheap looking CGI effects--when someone said that they looked just like those from the accompanying video game, that was actually an overstated compliment. Ultimately, I'm not sure what's more disheartening--the fact that a movie this bad actually got made, or that the studio heads actually thought that the movie was good.",1,Makes One Pine For The Days Of Michelle Pfeiffer,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2532,"['Oh', 'boy', 'where', 'start', 'were', 'several', 'big', 'budget', 'spectacles', 'got', 'critically', 'commercially', 'massacred', '2004', 'VAN', 'HELSING', 'ALEXANDER', 'etc', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'none', 'deserved', 'said', 'ravagings', 'more', 'CATWOMAN', 'pale', 'soulless', 'attempt', 'refashioning', 'comic', 'book', 'heroine/villainess', 'miserably', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'regard', 'placing', 'blame.For', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'poor', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'read', 'threadbare', 'script', 'was', 'actually', 'once-upon-a-time', 'decent', 'point', 're-written', 'careless', 'sophomoric', 'bird', 'cage', 'liner', 'matter', 'litterbox', 'liner', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'up', 'screen', 'Nothing', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'absolutely', 'rooting', 'value', 'remote', 'reason', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'care', 'characters', 'sympathy', 'offered', 'audience', 'strictly', 'poor', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'being', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'actually', 'workable', 'script', 'such', 'Berry', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'title', 'role', 'straining', 'attempts', 'get', 'grasp', 'character', 'just', 'brilliance', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'definitive', 'take', 'character', 'BATMAN', 'RETURNS', 'one', 'truly', 'wish', 'initial', 'concept', 'Catwoman', 'film', 'Pfeiffer', 'had', 'actually', 'seen', 'fruition', 'Unfortunately', 'Berry', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'lost', 'here', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'surfaces', 'upteenth', 'role', 'boyfriend/love', 'interest/straight', 'female-gay', 'male', 'eye', 'candy', 'basically', 'sleepwalks', 'again', 'role', 'actually', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'more', 'Lambert', 'Wilson', 'one', 'film', 'villains', 'convincing', 'role', 'as..well', 'Berry', 'Catwoman', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'prone', 'occasional', 'bouts', 'very', 'fine', 'acting', 'CASINO', 'THE', 'MUSE', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'joke', 'role', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'instead', 'tries', 'play', 'serious', 'Only', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'Berry', 'gal', 'pal', 'get', 'far', 'work', 'art', 'actually', 'joke', 'life', 'very', 'dull', 'party', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'tary', 'long', 'poorly', 'staged', 'action', 'sequences', 'cheap', 'looking', 'CGI', 'effects', 'when', 'someone', 'said', 'looked', 'just', 'accompanying', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'actually', 'overstated', 'compliment', 'Ultimately', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'more', 'disheartening', 'fact', 'movie', 'bad', 'actually', 'got', 'made', 'studio', 'heads', 'actually', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'good']",N/A

So when films come out every year that are really terrible, you just gotta ask ""is this worse than Plan 9 or Alone in the Dark? Well with Catwoman we find a film that's better than those but that's not saying much.Patience Phillips(why they changed it from Selina Kyle is beyond me) works as an advertisement artist for a beauty creme company. In order to make a deadline, she searches an old factory and finds out something bad about the upcoming Beau-Line(prounounced Beeyoo-Lin for some reason) and gets washed up in the river. Brought back to life by a mystical cat, which for some reason worked better under Tim Burton, she comes back as Catwoman ready to do battle against justice, and flirt with a cop.I haven't heard of a Rogues Gallery villain in Superman or Batman that got their own movie. You don't see Brainiac trying to save the world somewhere, or Two-Face fighting crime. So when Batman comics jewel thief becomes a crime fighter, it's kind of ""huh?"". And like I said, the decision to name her Patience Phillips instead of time tested Selina Kyle is forever lost to me. Imagine Superman being called Trevor Smith. Not to mention the costume looks quite ridiculous since not only does Halle Berry have an obvious skin tone but it just smacks of laziness.An unfortunate by-product of upstart directors is they're a little clueless on how to edit action scenes, believing the more faster the cuts, the more energetic it is. Compare this to Spielberg, Cameron or Zemeckis films that allow the action to unfold at its own pace. Here it's literally blink and you'll miss it shots.

My first complaint about this film is that it is not Selena Kyle and the Catwoman of the Batman comic series.  I would loved to have seen them base it on this character and had Catwoman in Gotham City.  My second complaint is that Sharon Stone makes a GREAT villian and I just don't think she was given enough to do as supermodel femme fatal.  Francis Conroy's character wasn't really explained and Benjamin Bratt's character wasn't all that interesting.  That said, I liked Berry as Catwoman.  I though she was very sexy and given the chance, could improve in the role (thought I still like her as Storm of the X-Men better).  Pitof's use of camera angles and the way Catwoman really moved like a cat was really cool and one of the best things about the film.

I love comic book movies, and I generally jump to get the chance to see one. Catwoman, however, gained a bad rap early, and that was enough to keep me away. Folks that hated it loathed it, and well, I didn't know anyone who didn't hate it. Kinda killed it for me, so I went on with my life...It's been years now. I figured, why not watch it, how bad can it be? I mean, it does have Halle Berry in it, and she looks great. I was dying to see how she interpreted one of the great likeable villains in comic book history.Well, it turns out, this movie is as bad as they say, and has no real redeemable qualities.#1 This is no comic. This movie has nothing to do with the comics, except the name of the movie, and the fact that she is a somewhat catlike woman. After watching this, I am sure the comics are greatful that this is an anomaly.#2 Halle Berry is awful. Her alter ego is unlikable, which ruins the whole movie. She dresses laughably bad, and her personality is transparently fake. How can you develop interest in a movie where you can find no one to root for, no one you want to follow?#3 The plot. The plot is ridiculous, where you can have a graphic artist break into a closed research facility after hours by entering a ""back door""? Having a cat ""test"" you by seeing if you will climb out a window in a multistory building and ""save"" them, even though they can get down on their own...is that a test of compassion, or stupidity? Having a person come back from the dead because they are deemed worthy by a cat? Like how did they know she would die? Why did they test her, if they didn't know she would die? How many deaths each year are caused by a deluge of industrial waste from a top secret cosmetic research lab? I could go on, but I will stop right there...#4 The special affects aren't very special at all. Catwoman jumps from second story ballustrade to second story ballustrade somehow evading the poorly aimed bullets shot by police officers. Evidently the policmen in this town were not trained to ""lead a target"" and shoot ahead of a moving target. They shoot direct at a moving target and miss every time, and then have the gall to look shocked.Leave this one alone.",1,Smells Like You Need to Change the Kitty Litter...,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,2266,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'recently', 'not', 'lack', 'desire', 'love', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'generally', 'jump', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'one', 'Catwoman', 'however', 'gained', 'bad', 'rap', 'early', 'was', 'enough', 'keep', 'away', 'Folks', 'hated', 'loathed', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Kinda', 'killed', 'so', 'went', 'life', 'been', 'years', 'now', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'watch', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'mean', 'have', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'great', 'was', 'dying', 'see', 'how', 'interpreted', 'one', 'great', 'likeable', 'villains', 'comic', 'book', 'history.Well', 'out', 'movie', 'as', 'bad', 'say', 'real', 'redeemable', 'qualities.', '1', 'comic', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'comics', 'name', 'movie', 'fact', 'somewhat', 'catlike', 'woman', 'watching', 'am', 'sure', 'comics', 'are', 'greatful', 'anomaly.', '2', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'awful', 'alter', 'ego', 'unlikable', 'whole', 'movie', 'laughably', 'bad', 'personality', 'transparently', 'fake', 'How', 'can', 'develop', 'interest', 'movie', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'root', 'one', 'want', 'follow', '3', 'plot', 'plot', 'ridiculous', 'where', 'can', 'have', 'graphic', 'artist', 'break', 'closed', 'research', 'facility', 'hours', 'entering', 'back', 'door', 'Having', 'cat', 'test', 'seeing', 'will', 'climb', 'out', 'window', 'multistory', 'building', 'save', 'even', 'can', 'get', 'down', 'own', 'test', 'compassion', 'stupidity', 'Having', 'person', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'are', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'cat', 'how', 'did', 'know', 'would', 'die', 'Why', 'did', 'test', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'die', 'How', 'many', 'deaths', 'year', 'are', 'caused', 'deluge', 'industrial', 'waste', 'top', 'secret', 'cosmetic', 'research', 'lab', 'could', 'go', 'will', 'stop', 'right', 'there', '4', 'special', 'affects', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'special', 'Catwoman', 'second', 'story', 'ballustrade', 'second', 'story', 'ballustrade', 'somehow', 'evading', 'poorly', 'aimed', 'bullets', 'shot', 'police', 'officers', 'Evidently', 'policmen', 'town', 'were', 'not', 'trained', 'lead', 'target', 'shoot', 'ahead', 'moving', 'target', 'shoot', 'direct', 'moving', 'target', 'miss', 'time', 'then', 'have', 'gall', 'look', 'shocked.Leave', 'one', 'alone']",N/A

I tried to ignore the Razzie people's seven nominations for this film but they seem to have gotten it right.  Halle Berry should fire her agent.  The Academy is asking her for it's Oscar back.  Where to begin?  Bad direction.  Never trust a director with a one name monicker(i.e. McG of ""Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle"" fame).  Pitof seems to have gotten his start in making bad music videos and translated it to the big screen.  Bad script.  The writers of this drivel have never met a cat joke it couldn't resist.  My personal fave is when Halle is revived from the dead by the cats it looks like she's coughing up a hairball.  Bad acting.  Halle looks ridiculous playing the frump at the beginning and doesn't have a clue as to how to play Catwoman.  The best part of her performance is when she sports the leather catsuits.  The gymnastics are impressive but it's obvious that they were done by stuntdoubles and computer graphics.  Sharon Stone is not entering middle-age gracefully.  She comes off more shrill than villainous.  Only Benjamin Bratt as Halle's cop boyfriend escapes this fiasco with any dignity.  I would give this film one star but I don't truly hate it.

Not quite worthy of 4 stars, but almost there. It doesn't have the best acting, and some of the CGI is a little cheap looking, but over-all, this isn't a terrible movie. People may have told you that this a truly terrible movie, like people told me, or they may have said that it was great. There is no in-between with this one. I may be the only exception! This film deserved more recognition than it got, and it also deserved a bigger audience. The box office was dismal (opening on the same day as ""The Bourne Supremacy"", this movie grossed 13 million less in its entire run than ""Supremacy"" got in its opening weekend) and the reviews were terrible, but I liked it and I do not know why. The acting is actually alright, as is the production value and the plot, but like I said earlier, it messes itself up in the visual effects department. When there should be a relatively real looking image of a person leaping from a building onto a motorcycle, we see a distorted frame that looks like it was lifted from the ""Spitrix"" (what I call things that look like a combination between ""Spiderman"" and ""The Matrix""). But that doesn't really matter since there are less than a handful of those scenes. There is, however, a scene about an hour into the movie in a nightclub that is impossibly stupid, and I actually found myself laughing. This unfortunate scene almost ruined the movie for me.The violence in the movie is surreal and almost addled with craziness as the film slowly conjeals into one long 45 minute chase/shootout/smackdown. Some of the films romantic scenes and aspects between the Benjamin Bratt and Halle Berry characters are sweet, but at some points a little too suggary for the films context of revenge and dark betrayl. The ferris wheel sequence, for instance, is the perfect example of how the film moves too many genres into a single scene. One minute there is a little love going on, and then there seems to be a person in need of rescuing.The setup is something that everyone should know, hopefully, at this point. Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a graphic designer working at an advertising agency. One night, while delivering an add, Patience hears something that was not meant for her ears. So she is killed and thrown into the ocean. When she awakes the next morning, she realizes that she can leap onto the rafters of her apartment. This is an interesting part of the movie, as Patiences apartment looks like that of a celebrities and not a graphic designer. But anyway, Patience decides to avenge her death, and she does so, along with starting up a steamy relationship with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt). Their relationship takes a turn for the better when Tom gives Patience a clearer understanding of her duties as a Catwoman, even though he is oblivious to the fact of who she is.The final action sequence is amazing and worth the 1:35 minute build-up. The final scene, however, left me wanting more. I know that knowone else has said this, and knowone else probably will say this, but I want a sequel.Rating Evaluation: None (Scenes never happen). Mild (Scenes happen two or fewer times). Moderate (Scenes happen at least a few times). Heavy (There are many scenes  throughout the movie). Extreme (Scenes are continuous from beginning to end in the movie).Violence: Heavy: (Several bloody shootings, a nonlethal though bloody stabbing, fist fights, and a falling death).Profanity: Moderate: (Not many strong usages, but a few usages of tamer words).Sex/Nudity: Mild (One scene that is quite understated).Drugs/Alchohol: None.",3,"Not As Good As 'Spiderman', But Still Kinda Fun",1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3673,"['3', '1/2', 'stars', 'realized', 'smile', '20', 'minutes', 'Catwoman', 'was', 'actually', 'alright', 'movie', 'Not', 'quite', 'worthy', '4', 'stars', 'almost', 'there', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'acting', 'CGI', 'little', 'cheap', 'looking', 'over-all', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'movie', 'People', 'may', 'have', 'told', 'truly', 'terrible', 'movie', 'people', 'told', 'may', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'great', 'in-between', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'exception', 'film', 'deserved', 'more', 'recognition', 'got', 'also', 'deserved', 'bigger', 'audience', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'dismal', 'opening', 'same', 'day', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'movie', 'grossed', '13', 'million', 'less', 'entire', 'run', 'Supremacy', 'got', 'opening', 'weekend', 'reviews', 'were', 'terrible', 'liked', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'acting', 'actually', 'alright', 'production', 'value', 'plot', 'said', 'earlier', 'up', 'visual', 'effects', 'department', 'When', 'should', 'be', 'relatively', 'real', 'looking', 'image', 'person', 'leaping', 'building', 'motorcycle', 'see', 'distorted', 'frame', 'was', 'lifted', 'Spitrix', 'what', 'call', 'things', 'look', 'combination', 'Spiderman', 'Matrix', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'are', 'less', 'handful', 'scenes', 'however', 'scene', 'hour', 'movie', 'nightclub', 'impossibly', 'stupid', 'actually', 'found', 'laughing', 'unfortunate', 'scene', 'almost', 'ruined', 'movie', 'me.The', 'violence', 'movie', 'surreal', 'almost', 'addled', 'craziness', 'film', 'slowly', 'conjeals', 'one', 'long', '45', 'minute', 'chase/shootout/smackdown', 'films', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'aspects', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'characters', 'are', 'sweet', 'points', 'little', 'too', 'suggary', 'films', 'context', 'revenge', 'dark', 'betrayl', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'sequence', 'instance', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'film', 'moves', 'too', 'many', 'genres', 'single', 'scene', 'One', 'minute', 'little', 'love', 'going', 'then', 'there', 'be', 'person', 'need', 'rescuing.The', 'setup', 'something', 'everyone', 'should', 'know', 'hopefully', 'point', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'graphic', 'designer', 'working', 'advertising', 'agency', 'One', 'night', 'delivering', 'add', 'Patience', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'ears', 'killed', 'thrown', 'ocean', 'When', 'next', 'morning', 'can', 'leap', 'rafters', 'apartment', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'Patiences', 'apartment', 'celebrities', 'not', 'graphic', 'designer', 'anyway', 'Patience', 'avenge', 'death', 'so', 'starting', 'up', 'steamy', 'relationship', 'cop', 'Tom', 'Lone', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'relationship', 'turn', 'better', 'when', 'Tom', 'Patience', 'clearer', 'understanding', 'duties', 'Catwoman', 'even', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'who', 'is.The', 'final', 'action', 'sequence', 'amazing', '1:35', 'minute', 'build-up', 'final', 'scene', 'however', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'know', 'knowone', 'else', 'said', 'knowone', 'else', 'probably', 'will', 'say', 'want', 'sequel.Rating', 'Evaluation', 'None', 'Scenes', 'never', 'happen', 'Mild', 'Scenes', 'happen', 'two', 'fewer', 'times', 'Moderate', 'Scenes', 'happen', 'least', 'few', 'times', 'Heavy', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Extreme', 'Scenes', 'are', 'continuous', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', '.Violence', 'Heavy', 'Several', 'bloody', 'shootings', 'nonlethal', 'bloody', 'stabbing', 'fist', 'fights', 'falling', 'death', '.Profanity', 'Moderate', 'Not', 'many', 'strong', 'usages', 'few', 'usages', 'tamer', 'words', '.Sex/Nudity', 'Mild', 'One', 'scene', 'quite', 'understated', '.Drugs/Alchohol', 'None']",N/A
860389,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00064MW6A,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 6]","""Catwoman"" is so repulsive, it made anime catgirls who watched it hack up feces and throw the content at a hero's face, and then have him scratched into pieces.  It's a amalgamation of Warner Bros' heinously-produced superhero movies of the past, thinly-disguised as an empowering chick flick.  Not to mention the public attention of having one of the worst superhero costumes ever, but to be fair, despite looking like a dominatrix mouse with clothes taken from a thrift store,at least she didn't wear those ugly goggles.  It's kind sad that such attention goes for such a wear, because she actually work a decent 'prototype' costume before her official wardrobe disaster: it was a tight leather pants (unshredded) and a long-sleeve jacket followed by black mask; she looked presentable, and she didn't seem less agile wearing more clothes than she does wearing less.  If she just cover her head with a bandana (and wearing cat ears), that would've been the right costume for her, but no, she wanted to look like a laughingstock to even perverts.It's about a not-Selena Kyle named Patience (Berry), a weedy design for ads in a big make-up business owned by a rich jerk and her wife, the latter played by a not-looking-good-in-her-older-years Sharon Stone.  When Patience was about to fall from her apartment after saving a mysterious cat, she was rescued by detective named Rico Suave---that's not his actual name, but Benjamin Bratt played a character who did nothing but coming on to the lead actress, so that name is appropriate.  Later, Patience went into a make-up facility when she overheard that her company's new product is tainted and dangerous for anyone who tried it; she was killed as a result.  And then came the stupidest plot-device happened: the same mysterious cat walk on her corpse, YAWNED AT HER FACE, and not only did it revived her, it gave her acute senses and extreme agility.  But such dexterity comes as a price when she has to carry all of the quirks of a cat; walking on thin ledges on her own two feet, having an obsessive craving for fish, having dogs bark at her, and having a fear of rain.  Oh, and she can teleport from one place to another, though that sounds more like a magician that a cat's ability.I wish I didn't make this sound stupid, but it really is.  What's next, does she bath herself with her tongue and does she breed 3 litters after 3 months?  Not even a few comics I read and some cartoons I've seen painted ""Catwoman"" in such a literal manner.  The stupidity didn't help but how warped the film is directed.  It seems like Pitof, the film's director, has see the first ""Spider-Man"" and wanted to imitate its free-flowing camera angles.  Except he wanted to use more of that style, whether it be backgrounds shots, interiors, character POVs, third-person perspective, wherever it can move around. This approach to filming is so tacky and distracting, it actually makes the film look fake (especially during Catwoman jumping across buildings); half the time I thought I was watching a 3D-animated movie, except this is live-action.  Editing is another seque to nitpick.  Some of the scene edits are weird, like that one scene where the guy was taking, and the scene keeps cutting to the same character in the same position (i.e. opening scene for""Cool As Ice"").  Sometimes, the film even has a few goofs, like when a burglar tried to break a glass class with his gun, but the glass case was smashed before his gun even made impact; it's a notable goof, and it's been done twice!Halle Berry tried to do something with her character, but she was totally boned.  She made horrible puns, her assertive attitude is laughable, and she did nothing to make Catwoman act sexual as well as appear sexual; she can be even too enamored with herself, like when her superego is dancing around on the center of a club stage and is lashing her whip around.  The story was stupid, the acting was weak, and fights are meandering.  ""Catwoman"" failed to be a provocative movie as well as being popcorn entertainment.",2,Me-ouch!

Patience Phillips, Catwoman's alter ego, was murdered by the henchmen of a major makeup producing company when Patience discovers a secret she and the public weren't suppose know about.  Now, as Catwoman, Patience is out to get her revenge.This movie if fun, but there is not a lot to get excited about.  The best part of the movie is Berry's portrayal of a woman that is part cat.  From hissing at dogs to quick head movements while watching fish in a tank, Berry did a good job adding cat manerisms to the character.  She moved like a cat in many of the fight scenes.The ridiculous part of this character was the costume.  The idea was lots of leather and skin.  While Halle looked dynamite, the costume was too far gone from the traditional catwoman outfit.  The costume that Michelle Pfeiffer wore in 'Batman Returns' was far superior.The other actors in the movie were largely misused.  Benjamin Bratt plays an officer that is too far off the character he once portrayed in 'Law & Order.'  However, we don't get much of a chance to really know his character.  His character essentially boils down to sensitive hunk cop.  Sharon Stone looked good in her role as one of the villains, but her screen time and motivations as a character were way too limited.  Her and the other villain's scheme was largely laughable and highly inplausible.While there were some good action scenes, they weren't anything spectacular or original.  Many of them were reminiscent of the fights from the 'Batman' series.  The climatic battle in the end just came off as ridiculous.Overall, the movie was fun, but it was also a disappointment.  As mentioned earlier, the characters were misused and underdeveloped.  Another twenty to thirty minutes might have done this movie some good.  So would some revisions on the script.

I also did not really care that the origin of Catwoman has changed from its DC comics version. What I did care about was how bad this movie is. This movie is right up there with Gigli as one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is reaaly stupid. Halle Berry's character Patience works for a cosmetics company who is making a dangerous product that will turn women's faces into burn victims if they stop using it. Patience finds this out and is killed by some goons who work for the company. Patience is then brought back to life by an ugly cat who breathes into her mouth. The stupid thing is she comes back to work the next day and noone at the company apparently bothered to find out who it was they killed and noone says anything. Catwoman then starts to act like a cat with really stupid looking cheesy special effects. Compare them to Spider-Man 2 and you will see what I mean. Where did the 100 million go into this movie? I don't see it on the screen. Halle and her love interest in the movie Benjamin Bratt have zero onscreen chemistry. A lot of the movie is extremely boring. This is like if the Lifetime channel for women made a superhero movie. True I think women may like this more than men. My girlfriend is black and she made me go see this to support Halle Berry who she is a fan of and even she admitted the movie was not very good. I enjoyed Halle in some other movies but this performance is a joke. I know a lot of people will go see this because Halle Berry looks good in the outfit. I can't blame them for that. That would be the only reason to see this movie. The soundtrack was awful also like areally bad R&B video. Especially bad was a scene of Patience and Benjamin Bratt's character playing basketball.

In fact, I'd argue that last year's ""Daredevil"" was worse. This film isn't horribly acted or directed; it's just ill-conceived, with a shabby premise and a mediocre script.Instead of spinning off the Selina Kyle character wonderfully adapted from the comics (and brilliantly played by Michelle Pfeiffer) in ""Batman Returns"", the masterminds behind ""Catwoman"" made the decision to create a brand new Catwoman character, this one with actual superhuman, cat-like powers and abilities. The result is that this film not only betrays the built-in fan base of comic book fans, but fails to deliver an interesting or exciting substitute for catburglar Selina Kyle.Halle Berry tries hard to rise above the material, and she does a fairly good job at playing both mousy graphic designer Patience Phillips and feisty, sexy Catwoman. And given the right material, Sharon Stone, icy and diabolical, could have been a wonderful villianess. It's just that both actresses are doomed by the script, premise, and in Halle's case, RIDICULOUS costume design.This movie should serve as a warning for the film studios: When adapting a film from a comic book, it's okay to take slight liberties to make the film work, but if you completely betray the original creation, you're doomed to failure.",2,Ill-conceived,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,1407,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'Catwoman', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'means', ""n't"", 'worst', 'superhero', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'fact', ""'d"", 'argue', 'last', 'year', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'worse', 'film', ""n't"", 'horribly', 'acted', 'directed', 'just', 'ill-conceived', 'shabby', 'premise', 'mediocre', 'script.Instead', 'spinning', 'off', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'adapted', 'comics', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'masterminds', 'Catwoman', 'made', 'decision', 'create', 'brand', 'new', 'Catwoman', 'character', 'one', 'actual', 'superhuman', 'cat-like', 'powers', 'abilities', 'result', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'built-in', 'fan', 'base', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'deliver', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'substitute', 'catburglar', 'Selina', 'Kyle.Halle', 'Berry', 'hard', 'rise', 'material', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'mousy', 'graphic', 'designer', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'feisty', 'sexy', 'Catwoman', 'given', 'right', 'material', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'icy', 'diabolical', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'villianess', 'just', 'actresses', 'are', 'doomed', 'script', 'premise', 'Halle', 'case', 'RIDICULOUS', 'design.This', 'movie', 'should', 'serve', 'warning', 'film', 'studios', 'When', 'adapting', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'okay', 'take', 'slight', 'liberties', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'completely', 'betray', 'original', 'creation', ""'re"", 'doomed', 'failure']",N/A

My wife tuned out less than halfway through, but I guess my daughter and I were in the right mood--we laughed so hard at how terribly bad this movie is.  Hey, fun fact, Halle Berry actually won an Oscar a few years before she filmed this disaster--it's TRUE!  So, plotwise, apparently this shy incompetent hot girl, played by Berry, gets herself killed by businessmen so stupid that they're bringing to market a beauty cream that hideously disfigures its users--sell that stock NOW!  I fail to see the opportunity for a profit margin here, after the massive lawsuits.  Anyway, in the most touching scene of the film, the dead body of Halle Berry, still looking hot covered with green goo, is approached by a herd of cats, and one gives her the hairball of life.  Berry comes back to life, hacking as one who has just recieved the hairball of life would.  She then engages in all sorts of catlike behaviour, such as beating her boyfriend at basketball, stealing jewelry, beating up men, and turning into bad computer generated automation.  Unfortunately, the sex scene was deleted, so we don't know if Catwoman does it doggie style.  Also deleted were the scenes where she evicerates baby bunnies and leaves their heads on her owner's step, or where she hunts down and eats the rats in the alley behind her apartment.

It would be in name only and be made largely by film makers who had little or no knowledge of the comics.This was among the worst Comic to Films made in recent times.  It looks like Warner Brothers really cut back on the budgets and the sets.  One thing that was true about the movie were the reports that Sharon Stone and Hally Berry did not get along while on the set.  The complaints were really childish and annoying.  I think it tried the patience of Warner Brothers as well, In the end, there were several instants where the two women complained about how much time they had on camera, shooting had to be stoped while personal calls were made right on the set, and they ran over time on the scheule.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[68, 102]","In the wild world of cinema, we're living in an age of comic heroes -- Spiderman, Hellboy, Daredevil, the Hulk, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and now... &quot;Catwoman.&quot;Sadly, this film is just an excuse to have Halle Berry purr around in a leather dominatrix outfit.Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a mild-mannered, rather dull woman in an ordinary job at a massive cosmetics firm. But one day she has the misfortune to hear her bosses talking about a new beauty product -- it causes the skin to disintegrate if you stop using it, but they don't plan to recall it. But when Patience is caught, they kill her and flush away her body in a wash of toxic waste. Enter Egyptian deity cat, who resurrects her and endows her with catty powers and a new punky attitude.Like any superhero worth her scanty leather catsuit (no pun), the reborn Catwoman wants to kick the behinds of the people who did this to her. But her ex-boss Laurel Hedare (past-her-prime ex-bombshell Sharon Stone) has a secret of her own -- cosmetic cream that makes her skin hard (Botox, anyone?). Can Catwoman thwart the evildoers? Will anyone care?It's difficult to understand why the talented, beautiful, Oscar-winning Halle Berry would attach herself to this ghastly, almost unredeemable story. There is literally nothing worth checking out in &quot;Catwoman,&quot; unless you happen to be a hormone-raddled teen boy whose only plot requirement involves Berry in kitty dominatrix gear. (Complete with whip!)The dialogue is truly horrendous. Berry is reduced to reciting lame one-liners like &quot;I'm bad, but only as bad as I wanna be.&quot; Director Pitof relies heavily on T&A; shots of Berry bouncing around and slinking seductively over rooftops, not to mention the bad CGI shots. Perhaps worst of all, Pitof overuses the silly &quot;cat&quot; element -- we're treated to shots of Berry sleeping on the roof, licking up tuna, snorting catnip. It's funny, but not meant to be.Berry really does seem to be trying. But she can't hope to overcome the script and direction, It's all the more tragic because she has the presence and smoldering quality to make the role sexy and complex. Benjamin Bratt is utterly forgettable as Catwoman's cop boyfriend. And Sharon Stone's big comeback just reaffirms the obvious: She can't act. She struts through every scene reciting her lines in a robotic voice (&quot;Now I can... kill you.&quot;)&quot;Catwoman&quot; is a cat-astrophe. With ghastly acting -- despite the best efforts of Berry -- a putrid script and a ridiculous director, this is undoubtedly among the worst films of 2004.",1,Cat-astrophe,1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,2610,"['wild', 'world', 'cinema', ""'re"", 'living', 'age', 'comic', 'heroes', 'Spiderman', 'Hellboy', 'Daredevil', 'Hulk', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'now', 'quot', 'Catwoman.', 'quot', 'Sadly', 'film', 'just', 'excuse', 'have', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'purr', 'around', 'leather', 'dominatrix', 'outfit.Patience', 'Phillips', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'mild-mannered', 'rather', 'dull', 'woman', 'ordinary', 'job', 'massive', 'cosmetics', 'firm', 'one', 'day', 'misfortune', 'hear', 'bosses', 'talking', 'new', 'beauty', 'product', 'skin', 'disintegrate', 'stop', 'using', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'recall', 'when', 'Patience', 'caught', 'kill', 'flush', 'away', 'body', 'wash', 'toxic', 'waste', 'Enter', 'Egyptian', 'deity', 'cat', 'who', 'catty', 'powers', 'new', 'punky', 'superhero', 'scanty', 'leather', 'catsuit', 'pun', 'reborn', 'Catwoman', 'kick', 'behinds', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'ex-boss', 'Laurel', 'Hedare', 'past-her-prime', 'ex-bombshell', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'secret', 'own', 'cosmetic', 'cream', 'skin', 'hard', 'Botox', 'anyone', 'Can', 'Catwoman', 'thwart', 'evildoers', 'Will', 'anyone', 'care', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'Oscar-winning', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'would', 'attach', 'ghastly', 'almost', 'unredeemable', 'story', 'literally', 'nothing', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'quot', 'Catwoman', 'quot', 'happen', 'be', 'hormone-raddled', 'teen', 'boy', 'only', 'plot', 'requirement', 'Berry', 'kitty', 'dominatrix', 'gear', 'Complete', 'whip', 'dialogue', 'truly', 'horrendous', 'Berry', 'reduced', 'reciting', 'lame', 'one-liners', 'quot', ""'m"", 'bad', 'only', 'as', 'bad', 'wan', 'be.', 'quot', 'Director', 'Pitof', 'heavily', 'T', 'A', 'shots', 'Berry', 'bouncing', 'around', 'slinking', 'seductively', 'rooftops', 'not', 'mention', 'bad', 'CGI', 'shots', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'Pitof', 'silly', 'quot', 'cat', 'quot', ""'re"", 'treated', 'shots', 'Berry', 'sleeping', 'roof', 'licking', 'up', 'tuna', 'snorting', 'catnip', 'funny', 'not', 'meant', 'be.Berry', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hope', 'overcome', 'script', 'direction', 'more', 'tragic', 'presence', 'smoldering', 'quality', 'make', 'role', 'sexy', 'complex', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'Catwoman', 'cop', 'boyfriend', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'big', 'comeback', 'just', 'obvious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'scene', 'reciting', 'lines', 'robotic', 'voice', 'quot', 'Now', 'can', 'kill', 'you.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Catwoman', 'quot', 'cat-astrophe', 'ghastly', 'acting', 'best', 'efforts', 'Berry', 'putrid', 'script', 'ridiculous', 'director', 'undoubtedly', 'worst', 'films', '2004']",N/A

860402,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00064MW6A,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[5, 9]","""Catwomen"" was directed by a guy named Pitof, and it's a good thing that he is using a fake name, because after this mess, he's not going to want to put that name on anything Hollywood makes again. This is one mess of a movie, and I sensed it from the ads, but since I give everything the benefit of the doubt, I had to go check it out. Halle Berry gives one of the worst performance ever, but she was never that great of an actress anyway. I never saw the preformance that she won an Oscar for, ""Monsters Ball,"" but anything has to be better than this. Sharon Stone was awful as well, and Benjamin Bratt, who was never really that good anyway. The script was so weak, with awful lines, horrible situations, and of course, cliche's galore. There was a scene where Berry and Bratt was at a county fair, on a ferris wheel, and there is an electrical breakdown, and somebody almost falls off the wheel, but it's Catwomen to the rescue. There was another classic Berry/Bratt scene where they were playing basketball, and she used all of her new cat skills and cat powers to beat him. Throughout the entire movie there is a sexual undertone, and even when her character and Bratt's character ""make love"" he does wake up with a scratch on his back. It's actually pretty lame, but briefly funny. I also couldn't understand if Catwomen was supposed to be bad or not. I know that Sharon Stone's character was bad, but Catwomen fights her, which is the good side, but then she robs a jewerly store, which was her bad side. There was so coherent background to the character, and the movie feels like it was made in about eight seconds.The movie actually starts with opening credits, which actually steals the little attention that you would want to have while watching this film. Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, a young women who has too much patience to put up with all of the people at work. She works at Hedare Beauty, with her friend Sally, and always puts up with her boss George. His wife, Laurel, the face of the business, is going to retire, just as the company is releasing a new product that will reverse aging. The product does have a side effect, a terrible awful horrible one, and Patience ends up seeing the meeting that discusses it. She runs away, but ends up drowning in the ocean, or a lake, I can't remember. But, cats end up resurrecting her, because of Egyptian Mau, who used to hang out in old temples, but has been found around Patiences apartment. There is even a scene where she tries to stop it from jumping off a ledge, and a cop thinks that she was going to kill herself. Enter Tom, who is a cop. When Patience wakes up, her eyes go from the human pattern to the cat pattern, which was one of the lamest special effects I could think of. Patience doesn't remember anything, so she sets out to find out who killed her. She becomes Catwomen, with the slick, letal, sex like, whipping attire, but is then framed for murder. Tom begins to persue Patience, but then things begin to connect, and he could find out who Catwomen really is. . .There was no point in ""Catwomen"" being made. It has to be the worst superhero movie I have ever seen, and I didn't even know if she was supposed to be a hero or not. I could think of so many things wrong with it, that I can't even praise it. There was a scene where, before Patience discovers that she has powers, she is walking with her friend, and they pass a women walking her dog, and the dog barks at her, and she hisses. It was supposed to be funny, but it was just funny because it was so awful. You end up not caring what happens to anyone, because nobody is likeable enough to care. Tom is always right around the corner to make sure nothing is wrong, and Laurel is so bad that she is always waiting for Catwomen to arrive. It's hard to write a review where there is nothing to say that is good about a movie, because it's so one directional, so I'll sum it all up in a single sentence. With lame special effects, a hack script, and terrible acting and direction, I have to call ""Catwomen"" one of the worst movies of the year--after ""The Girl Next Door,"" of course. I didn't like it, but you might.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.",1,Ok?,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,4222,"['Catwomen', 'was', 'directed', 'guy', 'named', 'Pitof', 'good', 'thing', 'using', 'fake', 'name', 'mess', 'not', 'going', 'want', 'put', 'name', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'again', 'one', 'mess', 'movie', 'sensed', 'ads', 'give', 'everything', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'had', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'one', 'worst', 'performance', 'ever', 'was', 'never', 'great', 'actress', 'anyway', 'never', 'saw', 'preformance', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Monsters', 'Ball', 'anything', 'be', 'better', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'was', 'awful', 'as', 'well', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'good', 'anyway', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'awful', 'lines', 'horrible', 'situations', 'course', 'cliche', 'galore', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Berry', 'Bratt', 'was', 'county', 'fair', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'electrical', 'breakdown', 'somebody', 'almost', 'wheel', 'Catwomen', 'rescue', 'was', 'classic', 'Berry/Bratt', 'scene', 'where', 'were', 'playing', 'basketball', 'used', 'new', 'cat', 'skills', 'cat', 'powers', 'beat', 'entire', 'movie', 'sexual', 'undertone', 'even', 'when', 'character', 'Bratt', 'character', 'make', 'love', 'wake', 'up', 'scratch', 'back', 'actually', 'pretty', 'lame', 'briefly', 'funny', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Catwomen', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'not', 'know', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'character', 'was', 'bad', 'Catwomen', 'good', 'side', 'then', 'jewerly', 'store', 'was', 'bad', 'side', 'was', 'so', 'coherent', 'background', 'character', 'movie', 'feels', 'was', 'made', 'about', 'eight', 'seconds.The', 'movie', 'actually', 'opening', 'credits', 'actually', 'little', 'attention', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'watching', 'film', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'patience', 'put', 'up', 'people', 'work', 'Hedare', 'Beauty', 'friend', 'Sally', 'always', 'up', 'boss', 'George', 'wife', 'Laurel', 'face', 'business', 'going', 'retire', 'just', 'company', 'releasing', 'new', 'product', 'will', 'reverse', 'aging', 'product', 'have', 'side', 'effect', 'terrible', 'awful', 'horrible', 'one', 'Patience', 'up', 'seeing', 'meeting', 'away', 'up', 'drowning', 'ocean', 'lake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'cats', 'end', 'up', 'resurrecting', 'Egyptian', 'Mau', 'who', 'used', 'hang', 'out', 'old', 'temples', 'been', 'found', 'Patiences', 'apartment', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'stop', 'jumping', 'off', 'ledge', 'cop', 'thinks', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'Enter', 'Tom', 'who', 'cop', 'When', 'Patience', 'up', 'eyes', 'go', 'human', 'pattern', 'cat', 'pattern', 'was', 'one', 'lamest', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'think', 'Patience', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'Catwomen', 'slick', 'letal', 'sex', 'whipping', 'attire', 'then', 'framed', 'murder', 'Tom', 'persue', 'Patience', 'then', 'things', 'begin', 'connect', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Catwomen', 'really', 'was', 'point', 'Catwomen', 'being', 'made', 'be', 'worst', 'superhero', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'hero', 'not', 'could', 'think', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'praise', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Patience', 'discovers', 'powers', 'walking', 'friend', 'pass', 'women', 'walking', 'dog', 'dog', 'barks', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'just', 'funny', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'anyone', 'nobody', 'likeable', 'enough', 'care', 'Tom', 'always', 'right', 'corner', 'make', 'sure', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Laurel', 'so', 'bad', 'always', 'waiting', 'Catwomen', 'arrive', 'hard', 'write', 'review', 'where', 'nothing', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'so', 'one', 'directional', ""'ll"", 'sum', 'up', 'single', 'sentence', 'lame', 'special', 'effects', 'hack', 'script', 'terrible', 'acting', 'direction', 'have', 'call', 'Catwomen', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'year', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'might.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'action', 'violence', 'sensuality']",N/A

I, along with many other fans, like it mainly because of Halle Berry, not because the actual movie is very good. We have to admit that as a whole, this movie is quite mediocre.But now that the DVD has finally come out, I've decided to raise my review to 4 stars. My opinion of the movie has not changed; Halle Berry makes it what it is. I've added on the extra star strictly for this DVD presentation, which is quite impressive. If you didn't like the movie in the theaters then obviously you won't be getting this DVD and might as well stop reading this review right now. But if you're a fan and are thinking about whether you should get the DVD, I strongly urge you to.For one, it has a great transfer with superb sound and picture quality. Colors are vibrant and bright. Blacks are rich and deep, which helps a lot since most of the movie takes place at night. Simply put, this is a DVD that will go quite well with your home theater system.Bonus features are quite good. The ""Many Faces of Catwoman"" segment has all the actresses who played the role of Catwoman tell about her character, the story of Catwoman, her attributes, and their own opinions and experiences playing that role. This is definitely the gem of the DVD. The other segment, a behind-the-scenes section, is fairly standard stuff and is pretty much the same as any other behind-the-scenes feature. There are several deleted scenes which are worth watching such as when Patience first gets transformed into Catwoman and is chased by a few dogs at a junkyard. Finally, there is an alternate ending which is the actual ending from the Elizabeth Hand novel. It has a more romantic feel to it and I can see why it wasn't chosen for the movie's theatrical ending.All in all, a great DVD. Now only if they released the darn soundtrack!

So I waited to see the film wanting for it to hit theaters because up until that point every Catwoman in film, TV show, animated, and comic has been great and wonderful characters. So with that knowledge I just knew this was going to a good movie, once again Halle Berry as the Catwoman. Of course like most people I was a little disappointed with the outcome of the film and the over all finished product. I feel like this was not the movie that should have been made but at the same time this is really not a bad movie. Take away all prejudice and expectations and what you get is a fun little new take on Catwoman and a fun little movie.The film is about a struggling over worked yet very good looking woman named Patience Philips [Berry], did I mention that she is attractive, really a beautiful woman. She is stressed out along side her friend Sally [Alex Borstein] who encourages her to find a man, it shouldn't be that hard. One day she notices a cat out on a ledge outside her apartment and decides it is up to her to save it, while on the ledge a detective is driving by a sees her on the edge. Of course he thinks she is suicidal and goes up to save her, this sets up our romantic ach of the story. One day while at work she forgets to take something to her boss so after a deliver service says they can't do it she heads to the address on her own. When she arrives at said place she hears something she should not have and is literally flushed away, she dies under water. The cat that she tried to rescue sees this and calls upon the cats of the city to help revive her, much like previous Catwomen. So the hunt is on to find her killers and bring them to justice, DC Comics style, or something.Much like people have said about this movie I agree that there are problems with this film, key word being film, as in filmmakers. The script by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and John Rogers was lagging in a major way. The first problem with it is that most of the characters seem flat and that is most likely due to the even flatter dialogue. Plus I am never one to hate on a bad story line [just check my other reviews] but for something that had a theatrical release with a big budget and stared an Academy award winning actress I kinda felt like it need more then this. For those who don't know this movie is about an evil cosmetics company that is releasing a product that will not kill you but it will mess up your face. I don't know about you but that seems like a police matter not a super hero thing, that's just me though. Also director Pitof just seems like he didn't know what to do with this movie, of course that could also fall back to the script which every director has to sign off on. Another thing that I just can't let go of is the CGI scenes of Catwoman running on the walls, don't know why but I don't like it.Of course I did say that I kinda like this flick though right? Well the answer is yes and that is for two reasons, Halle Berry and the rest of the cast. I will start with the rest of the cast and save the best for last, so here we are. I really believe that the cast saved this movie from being a total waste with the performances they gave, which I feel were not that bad. Take into account the script they were given to read off of and then watch it; they actually pulled off some good performances. Benjamin Bratt as the cop she falls for does a good job with what he is given and same can be said for Lambert Wilson as her boss. Alex Borstein is excellent as her best friend is one of the few characters that seems to be some what three dimensional or at least very entertaining. But I have to say that Sharon Stone steals the show with a very nasty mean performance, hope that doesn't spoil it for you. Now on to one Halle Berry who can never do wrong in my eyes, at least not do a horrible job. I do have to say that I think she did a good job with what she had, she strikes me as the type that reads as written [I think I said that right]. The first half of the film when she is normal she does a brilliant job and every thing seems natural [all except that not being able to get a boy friend thing] but it is in the last half as Catwoman that the cracks start to show. Of course she does a good job and is extremely sexy as the cat, but her lines they gave her are straight horrible at time. Of course I can forgive that because she is gorgeous and probably the hottest Catwoman ever, although I can see the argument for others [when they played the character]. But over all she did a great job and looked great doing it, man she is beautiful.Over all this actually better then most people give it credit for, even with its flaws that are many. I know I made this sound pretty bad in an earlier paragraph but with no expectations going into this and you will enjoy it. Sure it was far from a classic but so are other movies that seem to be enjoyable, this is one of those. A movie does not have to be great to be good it just has to be good enough to be entertaining.",3,NOT HORRIBLE-NOT GREAT,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,5169,"['CATWOMANWhen', 'first', 'heard', 'movie',

Catwoman isn't supposed to be high art, a deep movie, or have incredible acting. All it is, plain and simple, is a hero-action movie that's actually pretty fun to watch if you don't take it too seriously. Think of it as a comic book in motion. Once you get the idea, everything is pretty fun. If you can't get past this concept, you need to lighten up, lol.The main gripe I have about this movie is the horrible soundtrack and music. The composer should be shot because he/she doesn't know how to score the music with the scenes. About 90 percent of the music track is cheesy hip-hop/rap that doesn't fit. It's loud, dumb, and a 10-year old music student could have done a lot better. There's no connection with what's going on in the movie and the music. If anything, the composer, if you can call him/her that, just took advantage of the opportunity to try to get his/her tunes onto the big screen.So let me rap you my opinion of the music.

Boy, was I wrong to do so.This film was extremely entertaining.  Sure, it has one or two moments of ridicule, but overall it's a film no super-hero fan should miss.  Pitof did a great job of making the film flow smoothly.  The scene transitions are fresh and interesting, the CG effects are used at just the right times and the soundtrack was integrated brilliantly.  This is the first time that Catwoman actually has cat-like behaviour (not just a sexy woman in a tight black outfit).Halle Berry plays Catwoman very well.  A huge majority of the stunts were done by her, the fighting and whip art is all her and she does it all wonderfully.  The catsuit is a bit unorthodox, but if you just go with it, it's really not that bad.  You could say it's the latest incarnation of Catwoman since she's never been the same from the moment she appeared in Batman comic books.  Another welcome surprise is Sharon Stone.  She looks amazing!  Her acting, I'd say, is up to par with the rest of her stuff (come on, she's never been that great of an actress).  I'd compare it to Basic Instinct.  And it's nice to see her in a villainous role again.  Ben Bratt's character kinda gets in the way.  Nothing too special about him really.The plot is typical DC comics super-hero film plot.  Rich, powerful people trying to pull off an exaggerated and unrealistic plan in order to be even more rich.  That's how super-hero films always were, so get used to it.  As cheesy as it sounds, it works!  At the end of it all, I found that there wasn't one scene I wasn't interested it.  Whether it's the amazing action sequences, seeing Catwoman scale walls, or just the way a scene looks, everything is done very well.The only improvement I'd make is to change her name from Patience Phillips back to Selina Kyle.  Otherwise, watch the movie.  Don't expect anything more than a flashy popcorn flick and you'll agree that it's not that bad of a film.

Then as the reviews started pouring in and I heard things like ""Halle slurps tuna out of cans,"" ""Halle is given mouth-to-mouth by a cat,"" and ""Halle says insipid lines like 'cat got your tongue?'"" I knew I HAD to see this. I went on opening night for the express purpose of laughing at it, hoping that the entire audience would be with me. Imagine my shock and horror as I found myself actually enjoying it.Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a GOOD movie. The plot in particular hinges on one ludicrous conceit on top of another, and many developments don't stand up to the SLIGHTEST scrutiny, but you know, the whole thing is just so over-the-top ridiculous that you stop caring after a while. Even all the ridiculous elements (i.e. tuna cans), in the context of the movie, don't stand out as glaringly, and since they play it off as Halle is in effect possessed by her cat side, all these compulsive things she's doing sort of work in that context.I didn't like the CONSTANTLY moving camera (and I was sitting in the 3rd row, so it really was nausea-inducing) and the CHEEEEEEEESY digital effects work, but I felt that his idea was to create this entirely pop fantasy comic book universe, so at least it was an IDEA. It didn't work that well, but it was an IDEA.I think it's clear that the Sharon Stone part of the storyline was inspired in large part by THE WASP WOMAN, a 50's horror film in which a woman is the owner of a cosmetics company, and was once the lead model, but is now growing older and has to step down as model. She experiments with wasp royal jelly [though I am pretty sure that wasps don't make royal jelly] in order to hold on to her youth... and of course it turns her into a vicious wasp woman! Sharon Stone in this film follows the same storyline except that the face cream turns her face indestructible. Until it destructs, of course, but let's not quibble.All of the Spice Girls-level ""feminism"" this movie supposedly espouses--the usual shtick about how a woman is ""empowered"" by dressing in outrageously skimpy outfits and becoming a walking product placement for Revlon--is undone by the ending, in which Sharon Stone, her face finally [and inexplicably] cracked, decides that it is better to die than live life as an unattractive person.I can't say I recommend it, but I will say I had a MUCH better time watching this than I did at Hellboy, Chronicles of Riddick, or the Matrix sequels...

860413,ALZ5Y1CE0DWQ1,B00064MW6A,G. Guberlal,"[0, 2]","Since this movies conception, there have been numerous references to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the 1992 classic Batman Returns. 2004's Catwoman has absolutely nothing to do with either Batman, his villians, nor any resemblence to that Catwoman character. Questions have been raised wondering whether Halle Berry could fill the same role as Pfeiffer. Well, in my opinion, no. The depth of acting it took for this incarnation was more geared to martial arts and being sexy in leather. Don't take it wrong, Halle Berry, an excellent actress, wasn't given any true depth of character to work with.The movie seems to be divided into halves. The first part deals with Patience Philips working for a cosmetic company as an art designer who just can't seem to get anything right when it comes to her boss. What began promising at first, turned into a disaster when Catwoman finally arrived about 40 minutes into the film. This second half lost the story with a barrage of leaps and fights mixed with a loose love story.There are a few resemblences to Batman Returns, and maybe these were a nod to it:1. Halle Berry turns towards the camera, crouched delivering the same Meow! as Pfeiffer's character.2. Catwoman, always letting her curiousity rule, goes into a store, where instead of meeting 2 security guards as Pfeiffer's did, she meets 3 robbers.3. Catwoman stands in front of the moon.4. Catwoman nearly falls out the window, and later on, is almost pushed out the window.The references are there, but for anyone who hasn't seen Batman Returns, you wouldn't notice them. There are a few more nods, but I think the point is delivered.So, what's this story all about? Well, if anyone has seen the trailer to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, then you would have the story in a nutshell. In the trailer to RE2 (due this Fall) there's a facial cream that rots your skin and its side effects are toxic. (Funny, I was reminded as well of The Jokers mixture of poisonous toxins he shipped from his factory to shelves in 1989's Batman.)Ok, we have the fired employee who is killed because she found out about the evil corporations secret. A cat performs CPR (or so that's what it looks like), and she comes back to life. There isn't a comic book villian in this movie, ala Joker, Penguin, or Doc Ock (Spider-Man 2). What we have is the ruthless and completely flat corporate executives. There's no depth to these villians and no clever schemes to nab Catwoman, only pin a few deaths on her. There's your story ladies and gentlemen and I think you can pretty much figure out how it turns out.In the beginning, there was so much promise. From the opening credits showing the origins of cats in myth and legend to the meeting she has with the owner of Midnight (the cat who performed CPR.) After that, it was a downhill spiral. I will say that the catsuit was nice and very revealing, however the headpiece looks really odd. Catwoman got her claws from Tiffany's I think (they really do look like designer nails).I have to say, in all fairness, that Catwoman in Batman Returns was a lot more real and the character had a purpose. From her stitched up suit to her makeshift claws. Some may think I was going into this movie with a preception of Catwoman from Batman, but I did not. I had followed this movie since it was first announced and knew it was not the same. I also knew it had nothing to do with the Dark Knight, but I did expect one thing...a good story for the money. Halle Berry is better than a walkthrough part and deserves a good script, she's proven herself as a fine actress. Nothing is really explained in the movie and it's loosely tied together between action sequences and sex appeal.To see, or not to see, that is the question.

You see, Catwoman used to be just another colorful Batman villian, a simple jewel thief with a costume, until writers at DC decided to make her a romantic interest (bye-bye Ertha Kitt, hello blonde bombshell Michelle Pfieffer)  which spawned the ""Birds of Prey"" comic and TV show.Now Halle Berry and director Pitof (I guess Dieter was busy) take a crack at putting Catwoman on the silver screen, delving into the whole quasi pro-feminist, Egyptian mythology based history behind this shallow comic character. I give them points for trying. The main villain is played by Sharon Stone, an evil cosmetics magnate who plans to sell bad makeup to the masses. It confirms my opinion: Sharon Stone cannot act but marries well.Yes, Halle Berry is grade-A hoochie material enhanced by the leather Catwoman costume (personally, she looks hotter in her Ororo X-Man costume) but SHE can act, which helps this film.

On screen, absolutely not, but it's history is certainly worth a look.The history of this film is the most interesting aspect, hands down.It was written, re-written, cast, re-casted, and even the director and film companies changed several times.Now, if you'd like to know how I think they should've done this movie, it can be summed up in four simple steps1. Go to a comic shop and buy the Catwoman Origin Story2. Get permission for content usage from the publisher and copyright owner3. Use the original story and keep it accurate to the lore4. Put it on filmThey could have even tied it to Batman Returns if they had wanted to, the opening shot of this movie could've beenSelina Kyle after landing int he alley and getting surrounded by Cat's, she delivers a monologue about the next few days,she fakes her death (the climax of Batman Returns), and then we could've picked up with the final shot where we see heron one of the rooftops in Gotham City.And Voila!

So sooner or later a woman had to come into the picture and since Supergirl never satisfied anyone, they had to look for someone else, someone a little bit more attractive. And since Spiderman had many long legs and arms blocking the way they had to look somewhere else farther out of the way. They looked in Egypt, they looked in China, they looked in the Middle Ages for an animal connected to women and who was both satanic and in relation with freedom, liberty and freewheeling. That's how the cat came out of the wizard's hat or bonnet. Catwoman was thus saved from the water of the river, which is absolutely accurate, and brought back to life in the human world of the night. She became the queen of the roofs. Then add a dishonest but successful industrialist exploiting women with beauty products that you must definitely not stop if you don't want to develop some strange Karposi syndrome or cancer. Then add his wife, an old belle who has aged faster than necessary and who wants to get rid of her husband and put her hands on the golden goose and the bank reserves before he finally realizes he does not need her anymore. And then you have the perfect thriller. A little bit of romance between the cop who is supposed to arrest Catwoman and the woman she is supposed to be and you have a heartbreaking story. But the poor Catwoman cannot stay because she is nothing but a living dead. So sadness takes over and she can only exist at night and on the roofs of the city.

It's poorly acted -- overacted in many parts (Sharon Stone is particularly &quot;evil&quot;), the plot is weak (killer make-up? Very similar to the plot the Joker tried to launch in the first Batman), and there are several plot holes. For instance, why does Patience go back to work at the company whose goons just killed her?The real focus of the film doesn't appear to be storyline (which is weak at best), but how Halle Berry fills out her cat suit, built for optimum cleavage.

While i can see where some might have a problem with it, ive got to say that i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had a rich plot with deep character development. The visuals were amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I never knew what was going to happen next and i couldnt believe how much this movie blew me away. Hallie really prooved how worthy she was of that Oscar!Now take all that i just said, flip it to its polar opposite, and youll find my feelings for this movie.Lets see, Patience Prince becomes Catwoman and comes to battles equiped with a whip and cleavage. Got it, cause thats really all there is here.Wow! Ive got to say that im glad this monstrosoty no longer darkens my dvd player. I had to put it in one last time to see the deleted scenes. I thought perhaps my guests had went through enough torture and didnt want to see any more so we didnt watch them that night. Sorry if anyone wanted to see them, but trust me you missed about as much quality as the movie itself so no worries.Hmmmm, where to begin. Hallie? Well, she certianly spit out the lines. With about as much talent as a blind person controlling air traffic. Seriously, did she suddenly go retarded? I expected her to pull an Ed from 'Crank Yankers' an express how much she 'Had to go poopie!' Somebody get her a litterbox stat! A friend mentioned she couldnt believe that Hallie got paid 22 million dollars to be in this movie and i corrected her. ""No, they paid Hallies T1+S 22 million to be in this movie.""Shall we move on to the ""cat"" aspect of this film? Oh i believe we shall! Theres a specific funny/creepy moment that comes to mind ### when Patience gets a ball thrown at her and she starts rubbing it up against her face. As she appears to be close to ""really enjoying herself"" proportions she suddenly stops. The old woman smiles and simply says ""Catnip"". ### And then the old woman says ""Keep going, i was enjoying that."" Not really, but at least it wouldve been funnier than anything else in this movie. Well besides the movie itself that is.Some of this movie was just plain stupidity that there was no way i could handle. ### Why the need for cgi cats? Batman Returns used real cats for the scene this movie ripped off and that was a couple of years ago! Just because the technology advances doesnt make it right to use it okay? ### And let me tell you a thing or two about Patiences love interest, Cop Guy! ### He has two things she has written 'Sorry' on. One he knew came from Patience, the other he knew came from Catwoman. He takes them to get analyzed by an 'expert' (lets use that term so loosely its in danger of falling off) that says ""Oh theres no way these two people are the same. See this word is timid and this word is angry! Nope nope nope, two different people."" AND THE FRICKEN COP JUST TAKES THAT!!!!!!! ARRRRRGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!! ### Im telling you theres never been a moment in cinematic history that more made me wish id had one of those suicide booths from Futurama.Final note. I couldnt even stand Alex Borstien in this movie! Thats a gigantic testament to its disgustivity. Unless you go into it fully understanding its something to make fun of, then i wouldnt suggest watching it.

As Patience Phillips she is a beautiful but not very confident artist in the ad department of a cosmetics corporation on the verge of releasing a defective product. The product: Beau-line has one small problem in that it's addictive, causes headaches, and will cause serious deformities to the user upon cessation of use.The corporation is run by a nasty Sharon Stone and her greedy husband. When Patience accidentally learns of the beauty cream's flaw she is flushed into the harbor. Dead, her body is found by an Egyptian Mau cat, endowed with the ability to transfer catlike abilities to a human host. Thus, Patience becomes Catwoman.While reluctantly exploiting her abilities Patience becomes enamored with a police detective played by Benjamin Bratt. He learns of her secret identity after Stone frames her for a couple of murders. Rest assured, Stone eventually gets her comeuppance.The best parts of this movie come when Patience flexes her cat muscles and breaks away from her nebbishness.

That never got off the ground though and stupidly Warner Brothers decided to do it without Selena Kyle. It bugged a lot of comic fans that they'd do it without even having the character from the comic. It's not even original either, she even becomes Catwomen the same way Pfeiffer did in Batman Returns. Plus it's played out like Halle Berry has 2 peronalities and she has no control what she does when she has on the costume. Which is pretty silly and doesn't work. Plus the direction is done like a music video, hell think the director even started out making music videos. The action is too fast and messy looking to even be entertaining. Not one once of the action scenes even look realistic.I always thought that if Michelle Pfeiffer wouldn't come back that Sharon Stone could replace her. Instead of thinking...duh Sharon Stone could play Catwomen they cast her as an aging model obsessed with looking good. She has Halle Berry killed because she discovered that her aging make-up is dangerous. So Berry is brought back by cats and doesn't find it strange that she's more athletic and has a craving for cat food. She out plays Benjaman Bratt in Basketball and by jumping all over walls and being super athletic. Yet he doesn't figure out right away that she's catwomen. Oh plus she clawed his back when they had sex and...duh.It's not a good movie, not by a long shot but still Batman & Robin makes it look like Spiderman 2.  Halle Berry thinks she's too good to have a small role in X-Men as Storm but hey at least those are good super hero movies. Plus after embarrassing herself in this she should settle for playing Storm with open arms. If they couldn't get Michelle Pfeiffer back they should've just said ok that's it...no movie. Either that or could've just had someone else play Selina Kyle. This movie is some fun here and there but the dialogue is awful. Plus isn't that much of a difference between Halle Berrie's performance here and Elizabeth Berkley's in Show Girls.",2,Bad but watchable,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,2109,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'years', 'years', 'were', 'gon', 'make', 'Catwomen', 'movie', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'returning', 'Selena', 'Kyle', 'never', 'got', 'ground', 'stupidly', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'decided', 'do', 'Selena', 'Kyle', 'bugged', 'lot', 'comic', 'fans', ""'d"", 'do', 'even', 'having', 'character', 'comic', 'not', 'even', 'original', 'even', 'Catwomen', 'same', 'way', 'Pfeiffer', 'did', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'played', 'out', 'Halle', 'Berry', '2', 'peronalities', 'control', 'what', 'when', 'costume', 'Which', 'pretty', 'silly', ""n't"", 'work', 'direction', 'done', 'music', 'video', 'hell', 'think', 'director', 'even', 'started', 'out', 'making', 'music', 'videos', 'action', 'too', 'fast', 'messy', 'looking', 'even', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Not', 'one', 'once', 'action', 'scenes', 'even', 'look', 'realistic.I', 'always', 'thought', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'would', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'could', 'replace', 'Instead', 'thinking', 'duh', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'could', 'play', 'Catwomen', 'cast', 'aging', 'model', 'obsessed', 'looking', 'good', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'killed', 'discovered', 'aging', 'make-up', 'dangerous', 'So', 'Berry', 'brought', 'back', 'cats', ""n't"", 'find', 'strange', 'more', 'athletic', 'craving', 'cat', 'food', 'out', 'plays', 'Benjaman', 'Bratt', 'Basketball', 'jumping', 'walls', 'being', 'super', 'athletic', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'catwomen', 'Oh', 'clawed', 'back', 'when', 'had', 'sex', 'duh.It', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'still', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'look', 'Spiderman', '2', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'too', 'good', 'have', 'small', 'role', 'X-Men', 'Storm', 'hey', 'least', 'are', 'good', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'embarrassing', 'should', 'settle', 'playing', 'Storm', 'open', 'arms', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'back', 'should', ""'ve"", 'just', 'said', 'ok', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'had', 'someone', 'else', 'play', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'movie', 'fun', 'here', 'there', 'dialogue', 'awful', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'difference', 'Halle', 'Berrie', 'performance', 'here', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'Show', 'Girls']",N/A
860439,A12W99SK787ZJ9,B00064MW6A,"J. J. Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[16, 24]","I honestly mean it when I say that ""Catwoman"" is the worst movie I have seen in my life.  It is the lowest of the low.  The absolute bottom of the bucket.  I have seen ""Hypercube: Cube 2"" and ""Battlefield: Earth"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""Plan 9"" (who hasn't?) and even ""Future War.""  Twice.  That's right, I saw ""Future War"" two times the WHOLE way through, and I would still rather do that than watch ""Catwoman"" again.Often when I say a movie is horrible, it's just hyperbole for the purpose of humor.  But I really mean it when I say this.  If I was to count how many horrible tragedies I would rather suffer than to watch ""Catwoman"" a second time, my head would explode once I realized that the list contained more entries than the number of atoms in the universe.This movie is sh**.  Utter sh**.  It is the only movie I have ever seen where NOTHING is done right.I know a lot of people who would probably say that this movie is good if you don't take it too seriously.  But there's a problem with that assumption.  In order for a movie to be good, light-hearted fun, the director has to think of his movie as a popcorn flick.  Not a serious movie.  Popcorn flicks are all about action and quick-paced fun.  ""National Treasure"" is a popcorn flick.  It's illogical and silly, but it's fun because it's breezy and has snappy one-liners and there's a lot of great action scenes.  It's a fun movie because not even the director believes that he is making a realistic or serious movie.  Nobody honestly thinks there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence, so you can lean back and enjoy the show.""Catwoman"" is much different.  Everything about it is made as if it is meant to be a serious movie.  This isn't meant to be a pocorn flick, it's meant to be an exploration of serious themes like freedom and the conflict between good and evil.  There aren't winks to the audience to let us know that the filmmakers are just playing around---it's just a dead, straightforward movie that is horribly put together.Let's start with the basic concept:  A superhero with the powers of a cat.  When I think of cats, here are the special ""talents"" that they have/are said to have which a catperson might possess: 1) Exceptional balance.  2) Great jumping abilities.  3) Speed.  4) Quick reflexes.  5) Nine lives.  6) Retractable claws.  7) Mild toxins within the claws.  8) Sharp fangs.  9) Great night vision.  10) Always lands on their feet.A good cat-based superhero would have most or all of these abilities and be pretty cool for it.  Wolverine has retractable claws and he's pretty awesome, right?  Super-speed, ability to jump---kind of like Spider-man, right?  Night vision, reflexes, these are all great things you could use to have a good Cat Hero.In ""Catwoman,"" though, we have a superhero who has ""far-sight"" (which I'm not even sure cats actually have, but let's pretend they do) and she uses a whip.  She can also stick onto walls and climb on them like a lizard.  Occasionally she jumps, too, but mainly she climbs on the wall like a lizard.  And she uses a whip.  A whip?!  What the f*** do whips have to do with cats?!  Theoretically she has night-vision, but she uses it only when it's convenient and never at any times when it would make sense.  She has claws, but they're actually fake fingernails that she has glued on to her gloves.  She lands on her feet but only when it's at a time for comic relief.  She has good balance, but only when she's talking on the phone with her friend.  None of her abilities are all that good, and only a couple of them are even remotely cat-like.  Halle Berry isn't the Catwoman that hunts and pounces and strikes when you least suspect it.  She's the Catwoman that eats canned tuna and then sits in the corner licking her crotch.So, she's not even a Catwoman.  She's a weird-lizard-Furry-woman.  And I haven't even gotten around to describing the movie yet!Halle Berry.  How you won an Oscar, I'll never know.  You clearly looked to Dustin Hoffman for inspiration and watched ""Rain Man"" many times as research.  And then Pitof told you that all you had to do was shake your booty a bunch and the illusion would be complete.  Seriously, this is the worst performance in any movie I've ever seen.  Berry manages to get every single emotion wrong.  Even when she's playing a corpse, she doesn't look like she's doing a good job.  It's embarassing to watch her.  It's like watching a grown man running around in public wearing only a diaper.The characters are all irritating, stupid, and wooden.  Cliches all around, from the obese best friend who tells bad jokes to the evil boss who's cheating on his wife and tells bad jokes about her age.  Patience Philips is the only character in the movie with any depth, but unfortunately she doesn't have length and width and must still suffer the shame of being uni-dimensional.The story is about cosmetics that cause an irreparable skin condition.  You know how the Joker did that in ""Batman,"" and it was actually pretty cool because Jack Nicholson played the role with a lot of flair and the movie was stylistic and fun and didn't take itself completely seriously?  Well, the trouble in Catwoman is that it DOES take itself seriously.  It's one thing to have a plot about killer cosmetics and then throw in some other funny bits to show that the movie acknowledges its own absurdity.  It's another thing altogether to have characters try delivering lines with straight faces that all hinge on KILLER COSMETICS.The dialogue in this movie?  My god.  Jeff Foxworthy has more sophistication than the scriptwriter of this travesty.  There is not a single good piece of dialogue in the whole movie.  Even simple lines, like, ""How are you?"" are difficult.It's probably expected that there would be at least one line in the movie where Catwoman says that something is ""purrfect,"" but a good---or even an average---screenwriter would at least try to work it into the story subtly.  In this movie, they don't bother.  Catwoman actually breaks a scene and goes OUT OF HER WAY to say ""Purr-fect"" to remind us that she is, in fact, a CATwoman.  Just in case we forgot.  That's how all of the dialogue is in this movie---it's blunt and obvious and written as if you are a total idiot and can't figure anything out unless the script points it out for you.There's a scene toward the end of this movie that really symbolizes my outrage at watching ""Catwoman.""  The police are pursuing our lizard-crap-hero through a theater, and she leads them on a chase throughout a network of catwalks above the stage.  There's some sort of odd play going on below, with a bunch of dancers doing stylish things in pink outfits.  The audience looks bored.  Suddenly, Catwoman jumps on the stage and climbs up the curtain to get away from her adversaries, disrupting the play.  The audience cheers and breaks out in applause, really enjoying the show.This is a stupid audience, easily amused by random crap with no context and a bad actress wearing an unflattering and ugly leather suit.  They are monkeys.  The director thinks of us like that audience.Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to watch this movie.

There are the deathless classics, the side-splitting comedies, the great action adventures.  And there's a small but persistent little sub-genre of motion pictures that exist to record for all time the state of the art in the female form.  Truffaut once said that the history of the cinema is the history of boys taking pictures of girls.  Condemn it, accept it, your choice.  But there's no denying it exists.Would anyone ever under any circumstances have ever given a toss for ""The Outlaw"" if it didn't feature Jane Russell's two most marketable assets?  ""Gilda"" is a solid little noir, but would anyone but the most intense enthusiasts remember it if it didn't have Rita Hayworth throwing that flaming red (even in black and white) mane around?  Who'd remember ""The Seven-Year Itch,"" a dull unfunny comedy, if the subway train didn't blow that ""delicious"" breeze up Marilyn Monroe's skirt?  Without Raquel Welch's doe-skin bikini, who in their right mind would sit through the grunting stupidity of ""One Million Years BC?""And I could go on and on.Yet these are iconic images from iconic films.  Pick up any well-illustrated book about the movies and you'll see pictures from ""Citizen Kane"" and from ""One Million Years BC.""  It ain't because they're on equal footing quality-wise.Critics have roasted this ""Catwoman"" movie, because, I guess, that's what critics are paid to do.  They come up with stupid cat puns to condemn a movie with stupid cat puns in it.  How helpful.But it seems clear to me that this is a movie made to celebrate Halle Berry's dazzling body.  And the superhero genre is a great place to do that, because the plot is incidental and the heroine can be in costume, and still have all the flaunted sexuality of nudity.  In fact, Halle's been nude in two other movies (that I know of), but there's always a kind of sadness, trepidation, or despair to those scenes.  The Catwoman costume gives her the license to let go, and she does.People kvetching that this movie doesn't feature the Catwoman of the comics or the TV show are willfully missing the point.  This is a movie about Halle Berry's cat sculpted body and it is worthwhile for that alone.

860447,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B00064MW6A,Jonathan Appleseed,"[5, 7]","There was absolutely *nothing* believable or credible about this film. At times, Berry as Catwoman was dark - even when fighting her love interest, Benjamin Bratt. Why in the world would she be trying to hurt him? I understand that he was trying to arrest her, but there were better ways for her to escape than by knocking him around. I'm sorry, but donning that mask doesn't change her personality, any more than when Batman puts his mask on his personality changes. Bruce Wayne IS Batman, in suit or out.Given the films we've seen lately (for example, Spider-Man, 1 or 2), the special effects were heinous. When Catwoman was bounding from wall to wall it you could see the generated effects, and you're not supposed to. Again, especially not today. When Sharon stone fell, at one point in her fall you could actually see that it wasn't a person - it looked like Raggedy Ann dressed in white.To have a successful movie that involves a comic book hero, you need a good villain, a good plot, and something to care about. This had none of the aforementioned. The villain was a company and it's male C.E.O. trying to market a product that could potentially scar women for life (and what a ridiculous product name that was - Beau-line). Then the villain became his wife. A plot twist? I suppose so, but an entirely ridiculous one. Sharon Stone's character claimed that she had been using Beau-line for years. How is that possible? They're only just now getting ready to release the product. A product goes through years of research and testing, with trial and error, until the formula comes out right. So she's been using it during the research and testing period? Not likely.The plot - who cared? Did anyone really care about Beau-line? Of course not! I *cared* about the Green Goblin and Doc Ock. I cared about the Joker in the first Batman movie, and definitely about Catwoman in the second (Michelle Pfeiffer, for what it matters, completely outperformed Berry in the role). There was some serious tension between these superheroes and their villains. But how could tension be created through the wiles of a corporation?Also, how did the mild mannered little girl who was frightened of everything, it seems (but who walked out on a ledge to save a cat - um, duh?) manage to have that revolting leather costume in her closet? Seriously, that was deplorable.What's very interesting about certain statistics regarding this film is that on pro.imdb.com (the professional version of the Internet Movie DataBase), those who liked the movie most, in each age category, were women. I was surprised, as I thought adolescent boys would be much more interested. Perhaps not enough adolescent boys subscribe to pro.imdb.com.Also, this movie won 4 Razzie awards: worst actress, worst director, worst picture, and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for three others.The only reason I rented this was to see how truly bad it was. I think that it may have been worse than I expected it to be.",1,"Hally Berry ain't no Eartha Kitt, not even Michelle Pfeiffer",1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2981,"['was', 'absolutely', '*nothing*', 'believable', 'credible', 'film', 'times', 'Berry', 'Catwoman', 'was', 'dark', 'even', 'when', 'fighting', 'love', 'interest', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'hurt', 'understand', 'was', 'trying', 'arrest', 'were', 'better', 'ways', 'escape', 'knocking', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'donning', 'mask', ""n't"", 'change', 'personality', 'more', 'when', 'Batman', 'mask', 'personality', 'changes', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'IS', 'Batman', 'suit', 'out.Given', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'example', 'Spider-Man', '1', '2', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'heinous', 'When', 'Catwoman', 'was', 'bounding', 'wall', 'wall', 'could', 'see', 'generated', 'effects', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'Again', 'especially', 'not', 'today', 'When', 'Sharon', 'stone', 'fell', 'one', 'point', 'fall', 'could', 'actually', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'person', 'looked', 'Raggedy', 'Ann', 'dressed', 'white.To', 'have', 'successful', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'need', 'good', 'villain', 'good', 'plot', 'something', 'care', 'about', 'had', 'none', 'aforementioned', 'villain', 'was', 'company', 'male', 'C.E.O', 'trying', 'market', 'product', 'could', 'potentially', 'scar', 'women', 'life', 'what', 'ridiculous', 'product', 'name', 'was', 'Beau-line', 'Then', 'villain', 'became', 'wife', 'plot', 'twist', 'suppose', 'so', 'entirely', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'character', 'claimed', 'had', 'been', 'using', 'Beau-line', 'years', 'How', 'possible', ""'re"", 'only', 'just', 'now', 'getting', 'ready', 'release', 'product', 'product', 'years', 'research', 'testing', 'trial', 'error', 'formula', 'out', 'right', 'been', 'using', 'research', 'testing', 'period', 'Not', 'likely.The', 'plot', 'who', 'cared', 'Did', 'anyone', 'really', 'care', 'Beau-line', 'course', 'not', '*cared*', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'cared', 'Joker', 'first', 'Batman', 'movie', 'definitely', 'Catwoman', 'second', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'what', 'completely', 'outperformed', 'Berry', 'role', 'was', 'serious', 'tension', 'superheroes', 'villains', 'how', 'could', 'tension', 'be', 'created', 'wiles', 'corporation', 'Also', 'how', 'did', 'mild', 'mannered', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'frightened', 'everything', 'who', 'walked', 'out', 'ledge', 'save', 'cat', 'um', 'duh', 'manage', 'have', 'revolting', 'leather', 'costume', 'closet', 'Seriously', 'was', 'deplorable.What', 'very', 'interesting', 'certain', 'statistics', 'regarding', 'film', 'pro.imdb.com', 'professional', 'version', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'DataBase', 'who', 'liked', 'movie', 'most', 'age', 'category', 'were', 'women', 'was', 'surprised', 'thought', 'adolescent', 'boys', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'adolescent', 'boys', 'subscribe', 'pro.imdb.com.Also', 'movie', 'won', '4', 'Razzie', 'awards', 'worst', 'actress', 'worst', 'director', 'worst', 'picture', 'worst', 'screenplay', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'three', 'others.The', 'only', 'reason', 'rented', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'truly', 'bad', 'was', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'expected', 'be']",N/A

Our hero represents a female warrior archetype.  She must face and foil the world of men (the police and authority).  Her foe is the maker of beauty cream.  But the new beauty cream could be dangerous to all women who would use it.  All in all most of the characters and imagery are feminine in nature.  This should appeal to female audiences while the skimpy costume should keep the testosterone wielders interested as well.The disk comes with an interesting documentary about the many faces of Catwoman with interviews with the various women who have taken on the role as well as others involved in the television/film versions.

But in your next movie in which you are the star?Berry isn't awful as simply horrible miscast (lacks a certain erotic nastiness for the role.) and apparently doesn't have the acting chops to make up the difference. One must speculate how the studio felt when the first rushes came in. It sounded so good on paper and Berry is such a big star it's doubtful that any screen test was done. Now the evidence is in front of them and the enormity of the casting mistake is obvious. Was anyone in that room brave enough to admit the emperor has no clothes?Now Berry is hardly the worst actor in the movie (Alex Borstien as the fat horny comic relief is pretty awful but the honors go to Frances Conroy as the cat lady who is so awful one wonders if she has ever had a conversation with another human.)(On a side note it really is amazing that I list the worst actors and Benjamin Bratt doesn't make the cut. Now that is some bad acting.)(On another even more aside note I list the worst actors and Sharon Stone doesn't make the list. Good lord somebody call Guinness)While the movie overall is not nearly as bad as its reputation led me to believe, Catwoman still falls short.Along with the acting there is the horrible horrible (did I mention horrible) music which sounds like a 13 year old girls idea of what is hip; a lot of silly jumping around the city scenes; and the coup de grace, the Ferris wheel scene.Now no-one wants to see Catwoman save cherub face boy from carny ride gone bad'come to think of it no-one wants to see Batman do this either.

But it was surprisingly entertaining.  What struck me most, was that this was a lot like a female version of Spiderman although not as good.  There were even some CGI moments when it looked like Patience was a Spiderman.  Actually, I don't think cats can scale walls, so I'm not sure where that super power came from.  The ending was also reminiscent of Spiderman, except that it wasn't for the good of humanity, but for the good of those she knew.Halle Berry did a good job of portraying the artsy self-conscious Patience and the Catwoman character.  The movie was quite clean as well.  There was minimal swearing, the violence wasn't sick or gross, and no nudity though the Catwoman outfit was a bit revealing (and didn't look comfortable).  I also liked the link to history, and it made me wonder how much was real and how much was contrived about that.  As for that beauty product - no matter the side affects, I bet there are a few women who would want to use it anyway, fully knowing what it will do to you.There were a few cheesy moments such as obvious CGI and her stuntwoman not looking quite like her.

860461,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00064MW6A,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 5]","Where to start, where to start?  ""Catwoman"" is simply horrible, there is nothing in this movie that makes it worth watching, not even Halle Berry.  The story is simple and too stupid to be put into any film, the characters are paper-thin, and the CGI effects work is the worst.  I watched the movie all the way through, hoping it would at some point become interesting, but it never does.  If for some reason you are still interested in what this movie is about then read the next paragraph, if all you want is to read about how bad it is, then skip the next paragraph and read on.""Catwoman"" of course is based on the character from DC Comics, she is a cat-burglar with an obsession for all things feline (hence the name).  Commonly used as a villain for Batman and at the same time a lover or sorts for Batman.  This movie pretty much ignores everything about Batman, and Catwoman's origins from the comics.  In fact, there are no references to Batman at all in this film.  The story goes like this, Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) works for a cosmetic firm, that is secretly making cosmetics that cause people to deteriorate and therefore, require more makeup from the same company.  Patience discovers this plot and is killed for her discovery, only to be resurrected by cats.  Now Patience has returned to life, but she's more cat-like than human, she likes kitty litter, sleeping on the roof, really stupid stuff that the director and writer probably thought would be cool in the movie but comes off laughable.  Patience eventually turns to crime and dons various costumes to become Catwoman before settling on the final costume which every guy that has seen a commercial or poster for this film knows very well.  It's the bikini top, with shredded leather pants, and a crappy looking mask.  For the most part the moment Halle dons this costume is the best part in the entire film, because this costume really shows off Halle's ""assets"", which is about the only redeeming quality in this film.  Once this happens of course we are led into the final showdown between Catwoman and the villain of the film (I don't remember her name, but she's played by Sharon Stone).  After the fight the movie ends and Catwoman is left roaming the streets hoping to get a sequel, but God-wiling that will never happen, and the audience runs out of the theater threatening to sue the director, who goes by the name ""Pitof"" for stealing 90 minutes of their life away.The acting in this movie is simply terrible, one would think that Halle Berry being an Oscar winner would do a better job, but of course she didn't have much to work with here.  Really she shouldn't have even chosen to do this film, I mean to go from Oscar winner to this is terrible.  Sharon Stone, who for some reason is shown in this movie with what appears to be a soft glow around her, possibly to hide her wrinkles, is laughable as the villain.  Hopefully Sharon's return to her greatest character, Catherine Tremmel in ""Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction"" will be much better.  Benjamin Bratt as a cop chasing Catwoman and as Patience's love interest is worthless in this film.  The CGI work is beyond horrible, in this modern age of technology and with all of the great special effects used in movies, you would think they would have done a better job.  I mean, it was so obvious every time they used CGI in this film, it was even used for some of the scenes of Catwoman walking around.Overall, a terrible movie with a beautiful lead actress that should have known better than to say yes to this picture.  I would not recommend watching this movie at all, not even if you are wanting to make fun of a movie, there are plenty of other bad movies that are still watchable that you can make fun of, this one is just not worth the jokes you could throw at it.If for some reason, you do decide to watch this movie, here is the reason it is rated PG-13.""Catwoman"" is rated PG-13 for stylized violence, language, and sexuality.",1,Halle Berry can't save this one...,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,3979,"['Where', 'start', 'where', 'start', 'Catwoman', 'simply', 'horrible', 'nothing', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'even', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'story', 'simple', 'too', 'stupid', 'be', 'put', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'paper-thin', 'CGI', 'effects', 'work', 'worst', 'watched', 'movie', 'way', 'hoping', 'would', 'point', 'become', 'interesting', 'never', 'reason', 'are', 'still', 'interested', 'what', 'movie', 'then', 'read', 'next', 'paragraph', 'want', 'read', 'how', 'bad', 'then', 'next', 'paragraph', 'read', 'Catwoman', 'course', 'based', 'character', 'DC', 'Comics', 'cat-burglar', 'obsession', 'things', 'feline', 'hence', 'name', 'Commonly', 'used', 'villain', 'Batman', 'same', 'time', 'lover', 'sorts', 'Batman', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignores', 'everything', 'Batman', 'Catwoman', 'origins', 'comics', 'fact', 'are', 'references', 'Batman', 'film', 'story', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'cosmetic', 'firm', 'secretly', 'making', 'cosmetics', 'cause', 'people', 'deteriorate', 'therefore', 'require', 'more', 'makeup', 'same', 'company', 'Patience', 'discovers', 'plot', 'killed', 'discovery', 'only', 'be', 'resurrected', 'cats', 'Now', 'Patience', 'returned', 'life', 'more', 'cat-like', 'human', 'kitty', 'litter', 'sleeping', 'roof', 'really', 'stupid', 'stuff', 'director', 'writer', 'probably', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'movie', 'off', 'laughable', 'Patience', 'eventually', 'crime', 'dons', 'various', 'costumes', 'become', 'Catwoman', 'settling', 'final', 'costume', 'guy', 'seen', 'commercial', 'poster', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'bikini', 'top', 'shredded', 'leather', 'pants', 'crappy', 'looking', 'mask', 'most', 'part', 'moment', 'Halle', 'costume', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'film', 'costume', 'really', 'off', 'Halle', 'assets', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'film', 'Once', 'course', 'are', 'led', 'final', 'showdown', 'Catwoman', 'villain', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'fight', 'movie', 'Catwoman', 'left', 'roaming', 'streets', 'hoping', 'get', 'sequel', 'God-wiling', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'audience', 'theater', 'threatening', 'sue', 'director', 'who', 'name', 'Pitof', 'stealing', '90', 'minutes', 'life', 'acting', 'movie', 'simply', 'terrible', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'being', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'here', 'Really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'chosen', 'do', 'film', 'mean', 'go', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'terrible', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'reason', 'shown', 'movie', 'what', 'be', 'soft', 'glow', 'possibly', 'hide', 'wrinkles', 'laughable', 'villain', 'Hopefully', 'Sharon', 'return', 'greatest', 'character', 'Catherine', 'Tremmel', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'Risk', 'Addiction', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'cop', 'chasing', 'Catwoman', 'Patience', 'love', 'interest', 'worthless', 'film', 'CGI', 'work', 'horrible', 'modern', 'age', 'technology', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'movies', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'mean', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'time', 'used', 'CGI', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'used', 'scenes', 'Catwoman', 'walking', 'around.Overall', 'terrible', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'lead', 'actress', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'say', 'yes', 'picture', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'are', 'wanting', 'make', 'fun', 'movie', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'bad', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'watchable', 'can', 'make', 'fun', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'jokes', 'could', 'throw', 'it.If', 'reason', 'do', 'decide', 'watch', 'movie', 'here', 'reason', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Catwoman', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'stylized', 'violence', 'language', 'sexuality']",N/A

Well, that days was today, and let me say, I'm glad I saved the price of admission, although I cannot get my hour and forty-five minutes back.Almost every clip of film is a mistep. First, Halle Barry was poor and to sex her up (why they took this step is beyond me, she is naturally gorgeous), they cut up the outfit and put her in a ""bra.""  Her first appearance as Catwomen was sexier when it was less revealing.  secondly, her movements were poor and the CGI overly amatuerish at best (compare to Spider-man or X-Men and one gets the point).Next, Sharon Stone is just a bore.  Stone really has only one good acting performance to her credit (The Mighty - she was terrific).  While attracive, she has always been overated, or she just may be making poor role choices.Bratt is the only bright spot, but the script and direction is so poor, one doesn't care. Actually, maybe I should give the actors a break and charge the producers, director, and writers with a felony.

WRONG! This complete failure of a movie shouldn't even be compared to any of its Batman predecessors, television and film included. For one, Halle Berry's performance is much more inferior than Michelle Pfeiffer's classic Catwoman performance in Batman Returns. Two, this has nothing to do with its Batman origins. Remember how Batman Returns ended? Why couldn't they have done a movie that showed what Catwoman did after Batman Returns? That would've been so much more interesting than just a stupid, horribly executed, weak storylined spin-off-but-not-really-a-spin-off piece of crap.Aside from all that, all the acting in this movie completely sucked, Halle Berry included. The only moderately okay performance was from Sharon Stone, and even that wasn't that great. I couldn't stand all of Catwoman's horribly cheesey one liners, and there were some seriously ridiculous scenes in the movie that just made me laugh at the stupidity of it all. The scene where Patience (Berry) is rubbing the catnip ball all over her nose. I hope to God Halle realized how stupid she really looked when she saw the final cut. That seriously should've been a deleted scene. And the basketball scene. Don't even get me started there. But the most ridiculous scene was where Patience becomes Catwoman. A magical egyptian cat breathes his Cat Powers into her mouth after she was killed? Have all the writers in Hollywood gone retarded? Of course the scene is equipped with some overly dramatic music.

860474,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00064MW6A,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 21]","There is universal agreement that Halle Berry is a beautiful woman, and after winning the Academy Award for ""Monster's Ball,"" she has the bona fides of a legitimate actress.  Hiring Berry to play ""Catwoman"" makes sense, because there is a tradition of the character being sexy and smart going all the way back to the campy ""Batman"" television series where Julie Newmarr and Eartha Kitt essayed the role of the felonious feline.  But when it becomes clear in this 2004 film that the primary emphasis of Halle Berry as Catwoman is on her breasts, then I think it is clear this movie has lost definitely its focus on what makes Catwoman work.Catwoman first appeared in the final story in ""Batman"" #1, when she was simply the Cat (a.k.a. Selina Kyle), the world's greatest cat burglar.  She was devoid of superpowers, although she certainly employs her many cat-like qualities to her advantage.  She walks the line between being good and bad, which explains why she is so attractive to Batman, since the Dark Knight's vigilantism has him walking that thin line as well.  But in this story/screenplay by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato & Michael Ferris, and John Rogers neither Selina Kyle nor the Batman make an appearance.  For fans this becomes the obvious place to point a finger and start wagging it disparagingly.In this incarnation Berry plays Patience Phillips, a talented commercial artist who designs print advertisements without a shread of self-confidence at H&H;, a cosmetics company run by the husband and wife team of George (Lambert Wilson) and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone).  Laurel has been the face of the company since its inception, but now she is being replaced by a younger face, and she is not at all happy about this changing state of affairs (you have to think this plot is hitting really close to home for Stone).  There are some rather serious problems with the cosmetics H&H; is putting out, and when Patience stumbles across something she should not see in some place she should not have been, she is killed.When Patience is murdered she comes back to life after Midnight, a cat whose lineage goes back to the cat gods of ancient Egypt, breathes the power of Catwoman into her.  But even though there is Ophelia Powers (Frances Conroy), a character who exists to provide Patience with the necessary background information, there is no real point beyond the exposition.  Usually when someone is granted superpowers like this, from another being, there is a mission statement.  Instead, what we get is a checklist of cat powers as more of an instructor's manual.  Since Patience was murdered, Catwoman has a reason to do something about that, although it does not seem too much of a pressing concern to her.  But there was an entire history lesson shown behind the opening credits and you would think it would actually lead to something significant in the film itself.When this Catwoman steals some jewels, it seems just a nod to the comic book character, and not a serious bit of motivation.  Instead of a bad girl who sometimes does good things, what we have is a woman dealing with a split personality.  At this point I was reminded that the idea for a ""Catwoman"" movie was first floated after Michelle Pfeiffer's turn in ""Batman Returns,"" which would explain the character's personality disorder.  But while this makes sense when Catwoman/Selina Kyle is faced with Batman/Bruce Wayne, it has no resonance with the lead character is dealing with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt).  He sees the world in black and white terms, while Catwoman works best as a gray character.  But in this film she is bouncing back and forth between Patience and Catwoman without any rhyme or reason that resonates with the audience.Catwoman's final costume, the infamous dominatrix outfit, is wrong for the character and actually extremely unflattering to Berry.  Why anybody would want to make a movie with Halle Berry and make her look bad is beyond me, but this film manages to do it.  I also think the character worked better with the long hair along with the full-body suit, which did not have to be made of leather.  Then, to cap off the string of disappointments, we have the climatic cat fight between Catwoman and Laurel, whose use of cosmetics has had an interesting side-effect that could have been taken advantage of in the big fight but was not (because that would have made sense).  Still, given that the film is devoid of thrilling stunts or memorable one liners, it is not surprising that it is a complete failure across the board.Of the DVD extras the best of the bunch is the retrospective on the character of Catwoman, narrated by Eartha Kitt, who does the best purr in the history of the world.  Watching the documentary it becomes clear that all of the actresses who have played Catwoman have had both a better respect for and a better understanding of the character than those who put together this film.  The irony that ""Catwoman,"" one of the worst comic book movies of all time, came out the same summer as one of the very best, ""Spider-Man 2,"" is not lost on those of us weaned on comic book superheroes.  Hopefully the people who are doing the next Batman movie will have figured out which of those two to hold up as a role model.",2,"Why would you make Halle Berry look bad as

Once you get past that this is in no way like the iconic ""Catwoman"" you know, you'll love it for what it is. You'll be laughing and shaking your head at how ridiculous it is. It's a very unique and different take on Catwoman. This story is more a Peter Parker scenario of a meek artist, who stumbles onto a secret at her job, she's chased by the bad lackeys and dies, but a cat kisses her and breathes life back into her, and she returns to get revenge on those that killed her, etc, etc. Corny as hell? Yes! Unbelievable? Yes! Entertaining? Yes! This is one of those so-bad-it's-good movies.In the first few scenes of Halle as Catwoman I cringed: her acting came off very fake and trying too hard. But after a few more scenes of her purring one liners, I completely loved the way she acted. This is a very camp movie, with even a black singer belting out while Halle struts her stuff. Benjamin Bratt is adequate as the cop who falls for Berry (why is he always a cop? He also played one in that movie I like, Abandon) and is sweet eye candy, as usual. Sharon Stone is below adequate and doesn't play her role with much interest, which is understandable. I almost felt like she was snickering at the silliness of the movie. Should also mention that Halle is stunning with the long, curly hair; didn't like how she looked with the choppy hair.I began, hating this movie, and was about to change it, but by the end I was rooting for Catwoman.

To be honest with you, I wasn't even impressed with this knock-off to the Batman franchise that has held well for years.

860497,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00064MW6A,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 4]","I feel sorry for the makers of ""Catwoman"": here they were, just trying to make a superhero/action film, but ended up being responsible for what's been considered one of the worst films ever made.Okay, I'll come clean: ""Catwoman"", if judged against other superhero flicks, belongs on the rungs closer to ""Daredevil"" than ""Batman"", but despite the slapdash story, script, pacing, characters, and that godawful costume, I managed to enjoy it. You might too, if you're not a Catwoman loyalist (in which case, this movie gave you plenty to fume about)...Knock what you know of the DC character out of your head: Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a timid artist working for a cosmetics company, who is killed for uncovering the dangerous side-effects of her company's new product; mysteriously revived by the cat she saved earlier in the day, Patience comes to realize that she has acquired the physical powers (and traits) of a cat, and is quick to utilize them to bring down the launch of the dangerous new product.For this film, it's probably best to talk about its bad aspects first. To state the obvious, the movie is a commercial sellout: absolutely everything - from cutout characters to painfully-obvious plot twists - conforms to formulas you've seen a hundred times before, and offers nothing innovative. The action, while occasionally nifty, is almost entirely CGI or performed by a stunt double - Halle Berry never really lifts a finger. And where's the super-villain? - if you were expecting for any DC baddies, think again.Oh, and the usually-amazing Frances Conroy (""Six Feet Under"") gives the worst performance of her life as Opelia Powers; she looks like she's on crack.Still, for what it's worth, director Pitof (""Vidocq"") does his darndest to keep the movie entertaining: with few interesting characters to work with, he keeps the film looking interesting with a stylized colour palette and camera angles. The swift cuts and editing will either keep your attention or give you a headache. Throw in some good CGI and decent, one-sided action scenes, and you can easily find yourself entertained for a single evening.Needless to say, this stand-alone adventure won't make you neglect Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Batman Returns"" or any of the femme fatale's previous outings, but as for being one of the worst films ever made, ""Catwoman"" falls short of the mark.

She survives the attack and becomes the inner vamp, Catwoman.While this is certainly true to the roots of Catwoman in the comics, this movie is so terrible it's almost painful.  Halle Berry is acting like a cat (the jerky movements watching fish in an aquarium, liking sushi, etc.) and it looks ridiculous rather than insightful method acting.  The plot descintegrates as she is attempting to battle the evil corporation from releasing this product, her relationship with Bejamin Bratt goes to weirdness, and we are treated to little if anything than looking at her perfectly fit, cut body in those skin tight leathers with a whip.Why 2 stars rather than 1?

As far as the catwoman outfit Halle wore, I really didn't see anything wrong with it, it really covered more than most of the swimsuits do today. I found the movie very good and action packed, I believe the PG-13 rating fit it well.  It is very gripping, and I did some research on the movie and there really was an Egytian goddess cat named Bastet, so it did contain some historical element, the special effects were very good, it would be nice to move the way the special effects had her moving as catwoman, very catlike, especially if you watch cats and the way they move. It is one movie I will watch over and over again. I have yet to check out the extra's contained on the DVD, I am so intrigued by the movie itself. According to the DVD package it contains an alternate ending, additional scenes, and profiles the evolution of the character, I look forward to viewing these as soon as I have the time and can move past the movie itself.

Even when Catwoman was in pre-production, it was a forgone conclusion that this would be an absolute bomb.  Directed by french director Pitof, the film has no real visual flair besides the very sexy Halle Berry strutting around with hardly any clothes on, and there are quite a number of plain old bad CGI shots.  Sharon Stone gives her most wooden performance in her career, and other cast members Benjamin Bratt and Frances Conroy are wasted.  Not to mention, this movie has no original idea anywhere in it.  The tagline of the film trailers proclaimed, ""a cat can bring a soul back to the world of the living to make the wrong things right"".  Gee, anyone else remember the Crow?  If you're a fan of Berry, this is worth watching to see her gorgeous body in action, but if you are going to watch this strictly for that, your best bet is to fast forward through the rest of the film.

860515,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00064MW6A,Nicholas Carroll,"[4, 6]","I had bad expectations of this film after hearing last summer how widely panned it was and based on the trailer, which didn't really make this film a ""must see"" for me.  I'm glad I waited, though it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, and it could stand to be a lot better.First of all, choosing Halle Berry for the latest incarnation of Catwoman was the best decision the producers could make.  She makes a perfect Catwoman and does a great job.  Her costume is better than the one Michelle Pfeiffer used in ""Batman Returns"", though I still didn't like her mask.  Halle Berry is the best thing about this movie, especially with her whip appeal and sexy moves.  One scene I like in particular is the basketball game between Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) and Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), with the hip urban groove music matching the flow and rhythm of the game, which is more a physical flirtation between the two than an actual game.  This occurs when Patience is just learning about her new dexterous style.Now, for the bad...which is nearly everything else about the film.  The plot is flimsy and reminiscent of the first Tim Burton ""Batman"" film...cosmetics that does more harm and requires continuous use to prevent the scars on one's face.  Patience Phillips is a mousy commercial artist who is so timid and afraid of the boss (played by Lambert Wilson, best known as the Merovingian of the two ""Matrix"" sequels and essentially plays the same role in this film) that she takes his abuse and scorn.  Sharon Stone plays the wife of Monsieur Hedere, who's every bit as schemeing as her husband, though a bit more deadly.  This leads to the inevitable ""cat fights"" between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone.Someone complained about Patience Phillips being a mousy lady, but that's the point, at least with Selena Kyle (the original alter-ego of Catwoman).  The transformation of a mousy lady into a fierce, feline, femme fatale is the whole point about Catwoman and the empowerment of such a role.  That's why Patience is ""mousy"" at first.  What bothered me most about this film is Patience's sidekick, a white co-worker who practically pushes Patience on a date with Detective Tom Lone, and who wants the scoop on every little detail.  It was especially a cringe-worthy moment to hear this plumpy, dumpy white woman tell Patience, ""give me my props!"" and trying to act hip and cool.  It totally rang false.  The whole friendship between the two of them didn't see authentic, but was a mere contrivance to give Patience a friend that plays a semi-important role for the purposes of dialogue.  Now about that dialogue...very cliched and cheesy (such as Catwoman grabbing hold of a baddie's tongue and then saying, ""cat got your tongue?"").  The film is full of horrendous dialogue.Another complaint about the film is that too many scenes took place in industrial buildings.  It was just unoriginal and not very exciting.  It lends a sort of ""been there, done that, seen that"" blase to the whole film.  There's really nothing in here that screams to be seen, that just wows you the way the two ""Spider-man"" films do.  That movie has heart, this one doesn't.  My final critique is that the background music was often annoyingly distracting and didn't fit the scene (except for the basketball one-on-one game).  The people who made this film either tried to hard or didn't try hard enough...its not very original, exciting, or worth the money and time spent on it.  Halle Berry as Catwoman is the only good thing about this film and she makes it worth watching at least once.  Take her out of the equation and the film is third-rate, first draft stuff that should never have been given the greenlight.  Because this film bombed, there's little chance that a better made sequel will ever get made, which is a shame.  There's so many things one can do with a Catwoman film, but this film isn't it.",3,"Not cat-astrophic, nor the cat's meow...just mediocre",1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,3896,"['had', 'bad', 'expectations', 'film', 'hearing', 'last', 'summer', 'how', 'widely', 'panned', 'was', 'based', 'trailer', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'film', 'must', 'see', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'could', 'stand', 'be', 'lot', 'better.First', 'choosing', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'Catwoman', 'was', 'best', 'decision', 'producers', 'could', 'make', 'perfect', 'Catwoman', 'great', 'job', 'costume', 'better', 'one', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'used', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'mask', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'especially', 'whip', 'appeal', 'sexy', 'moves', 'One', 'scene', 'like', 'particular', 'basketball', 'game', 'Detective', 'Tom', 'Lone', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'hip', 'urban', 'groove', 'music', 'matching', 'flow', 'rhythm', 'game', 'more', 'physical', 'flirtation', 'two', 'actual', 'game', 'when', 'Patience', 'just', 'learning', 'new', 'dexterous', 'style.Now', 'bad', 'nearly', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'plot', 'flimsy', 'reminiscent', 'first', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'film', 'cosmetics', 'more', 'harm', 'continuous', 'use', 'prevent', 'scars', 'one', 'face', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'mousy', 'commercial', 'artist', 'who', 'so', 'timid', 'afraid', 'boss', 'played', 'Lambert', 'Wilson', 'best', 'known', 'Merovingian', 'two', 'Matrix', 'sequels', 'essentially', 'same', 'role', 'film', 'abuse', 'scorn', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'wife', 'Monsieur', 'Hedere', 'who', 'bit', 'as', 'schemeing', 'husband', 'bit', 'more', 'deadly', 'inevitable', 'cat', 'fights', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Sharon', 'Stone.Someone', 'complained', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'being', 'mousy', 'lady', 'point', 'least', 'Selena', 'Kyle', 'original', 'alter-ego', 'Catwoman', 'transformation', 'mousy', 'lady', 'fierce', 'feline', 'femme', 'fatale', 'whole', 'point', 'Catwoman', 'empowerment', 'such', 'role', 'why', 'Patience', 'mousy', 'first', 'What', 'bothered', 'most', 'film', 'Patience', 'sidekick', 'white', 'co-worker', 'who', 'practically', 'Patience', 'date', 'Detective', 'Tom', 'Lone', 'who', 'scoop', 'little', 'detail', 'was', 'especially', 'cringe-worthy', 'moment', 'hear', 'plumpy', 'dumpy', 'white', 'woman', 'tell', 'Patience', 'give', 'props', 'trying', 'act', 'hip', 'cool', 'totally', 'rang', 'false', 'whole', 'friendship', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'authentic', 'was', 'mere', 'contrivance', 'give', 'Patience', 'friend', 'semi-important', 'role', 'purposes', 'dialogue', 'Now', 'dialogue', 'very', 'cliched', 'cheesy', 'such', 'Catwoman', 'grabbing', 'hold', 'baddie', 'tongue', 'then', 'saying', 'cat', 'got', 'tongue', 'film', 'full', 'horrendous', 'dialogue.Another', 'complaint', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'took', 'place', 'industrial', 'buildings', 'was', 'just', 'unoriginal', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'sort', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'seen', 'blase', 'whole', 'film', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', 'be', 'seen', 'just', 'way', 'two', 'Spider-man', 'films', 'do', 'movie', 'heart', 'one', ""n't"", 'final', 'critique', 'background', 'music', 'was', 'often', 'annoyingly', 'distracting', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'scene', 'basketball', 'one-on-one', 'game', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'either', 'tried', 'hard', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'exciting', 'money', 'time', 'spent', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Catwoman', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'Take', 'out', 'equation', 'film', 'third-rate', 'first', 'draft', 'stuff', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'greenlight', 'film', 'bombed', 'little', 'chance', 'better', 'made', 'sequel', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'made', 'shame', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'Catwoman', 'film', 'film', ""n't""]",N/A
860516,A3713PP4MADKED,B00064MW6A,"Nick Watkins ""Nick Watkins""","[11, 16]","I saw this movie today, somewhat expecting to be disappointed because this is getting really bad review, but three friends and I went out to see it anyway. We should've seen &quot;Farenheight 9/11&quot; instead...This is a bad movie. From reading over reviews I see that a lot of people don't like it because it doesn't follow the comic's story or whatever, and I can see how that can be a p*sser to hardcore fans, but I've never really read any comics so I don't even know what the original story is.I do know that the story in this particular movie is ridicoulus.Patience Phillips is an average woman, with dreams she has yet to achieve and a job she hates. She's clumsy, too. One day, she sees a cat, I think it's name is Midnight. Anyway, Midnight is apparently trapped on top of Patience's apartment roof. Patience gets out on the roof to try and save the cat, but almost kills herself. Some cop sees that she's about to fall off the roof, and, thinking she's a jumper, goes up and saves her. Everything gets cleared up, he realizes she's not a jumper, they take a likin' to each other, etc. That night, Patience has to deliver something to her work, so she goes there, and the front door is locking, so she goes around and goes through the door that says &quot;Warning: Keep Out&quot; or something like that, which just happens to be unlocked. She stumbles upon her bosses conversation, her boss hears her, they kill her. The conversation, by the way, was about how even though they knew that a side-effect of a new beauty cream their company is producing has horrible side-effects, they're not going to pull it off the shelves for money's sake. Patience is reserrected by a few ancient cats or something like that and she comes back to life with cat-like powers.Now, the ridicoulus plot is not the only bad thing. The pace of the movie is worse. I mean, it moves along WAY too fast. Patience and her cop boyfriend never really have any character develepmont as a couple (actually, the cop doesn't have much development at all) and before you even know it, Halle's running around in leather, which is the film's highlight, though.The villians in this movie aren't anything special either. Sharon Stone plays a psycho woman who's used some sort of a cream for a long time and she's invincible. Of course, her and Catwoman only battle once and it's extremely short, and to say the least, a lot less that dynamic.Also, the action is pretty bland. There's not really much of it...probably one scene between Catwoman and bankrobbers which lasts about a minute and a half and the final scene between her and Sharon Stone's character. But the action is nothing you haven't seen before, just the usual computer effects and flashy camera angles, and the usual start and stop, fast moving editing.So, yeah. This could have been a way better movie. Halle Barry is definelty hot a hell in her Catwoman outfit, but is that worth $7.50? This movie would have been a lot cooler if Batman was in it.

The script was juvenile and corny. Halle Berry gives the worst performance of her illustrious acting career in this movie. She plays Patience Williams(wasnt the original Catwoman called Selina Kyle?), a timid beauty ad designer who accidently stumbles on to an evil plan by the owner of the company she works for. The evil plan involves marketing a beauty cream that is known to cause skin disorder and cancer. Patience is chased out of the building and into a drainage system where she falls to her doom and is revived by a cat.Opinion: This movie is humoruosly bad. Her origin with the cat that revives her is laughable. The way she walks so awkwardly(like she's had one too many catnip) in that tacky cat suit is a riot. The way she cracks that whip like an amateur dominatrix is hysterical. The fight scenes s well as the dialogue is laughable too. The most funniest and probably the worst scene in the movie is where she beats her soon-to-be boyfriend/cop in basketball with HIGH HEELS ON!!! She looked like a total goof dribbling that ball between her legs. Then there's those moments in the movie where you have to suspend your intellect like the time Halle slid through those prison bars without getting stuck or the fact that the toxic cream that the main villain is peddling makes her(the villian) immune to punches and kicks that would knock the average person unconscious.Closing comments: This is the worst movie that Halle Berry has ever starred in and is another blemish is her movie career. The acting is dreadful and the action is a joke. I would be surprised if she could still find work but then again if Eddie Murphy could find roles to play after the crappy I-Spy then Halle should be able to bounce back from this.To Halle: FIRE YOUR AGENT IMMEDIATELY!!!",1,"Not the cat's meow, more like the cat's meeOUCH!",1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,1890,"['Dont', 'get', 'twisted', 'awful', 'film', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'cant', 'take', 'full', 'blame', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'juvenile', 'corny', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'worst', 'performance', 'illustrious', 'acting', 'career', 'movie', 'Patience', 'Williams', 'original', 'Catwoman', 'called', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'timid', 'beauty', 'ad', 'designer', 'who', 'accidently', 'evil', 'plan', 'owner', 'company', 'evil', 'plan', 'marketing', 'beauty', 'cream', 'known', 'cause', 'skin', 'disorder', 'cancer', 'Patience', 'chased', 'building', 'drainage', 'system', 'where', 'doom', 'revived', 'cat.Opinion', 'movie', 'humoruosly', 'bad', 'origin', 'cat', 'laughable', 'way', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'had', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'catnip', 'tacky', 'cat', 'suit', 'riot', 'way', 'whip', 'amateur', 'dominatrix', 'hysterical', 'fight', 'scenes', 's', 'well', 'dialogue', 'laughable', 'too', 'most', 'funniest', 'probably', 'worst', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'soon-to-be', 'boyfriend/cop', 'basketball', 'HIGH', 'HEELS', 'ON', 'looked', 'total', 'goof', 'dribbling', 'ball', 'legs', 'Then', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'have', 'suspend', 'intellect', 'time', 'Halle', 'slid', 'prison', 'bars', 'getting', 'stuck', 'fact', 'toxic', 'cream', 'main', 'villain', 'peddling', 'villian', 'immune', 'punches', 'kicks', 'would', 'knock', 'average', 'person', 'unconscious.Closing', 'comments', 'worst', 'movie', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'ever', 'starred', 'blemish', 'movie', 'career', 'acting', 'dreadful', 'action', 'joke', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'could', 'still', 'find', 'work', 'then', 'again', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'could', 'find', 'roles', 'play', 'crappy', 'I-Spy', 'then', 'Halle', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'bounce', 'back', 'this.To', 'Halle', 'FIRE', 'YOUR', 'AGENT', 'IMMEDIATELY']",N/A
860520,A1AST89AHN17O7,B00064MW6A,Omnes,"[2, 3]","When I first learned of the movie Catwoman, I heard that the public reception towards the first trailers - where Halle Berry, who plays the main character, hisses at some barking dogs - were so bad that Warner studios had to release new trailers without this scene that made moviegoers laugh. Now I am not sure if everybody who saw those trailers did laugh, but I am certain that everyone knew that the movie would have a rough ride at its release. Especially when they had to reshoot a whole new ending for the pre-screening reactions were bad. However, the end result was that the public, the critics, and certain actors like Halle Berry herself, admitted the movie was awful.At the time of the release many critics have been thrown at Pitof, the movie director, and have blamed him for the film's failure. However, I think that movie's main mistake was that it was caught in a Development Hell that went for twelve years, in which the project switched writers so many times that the original story, a sequel to Batman Returns ending that Daniel Waters wrote, became something else. And by that I mean a derivative story where an intimidated graphic designer working for two unpleasant Cosmetic company bosses, drown and become a woman-cat entity who takes the identity of Catwoman while wearing a costume that made her more ridiculous than dangerous.About the actors, I can say that everyone in the cast gave their best with what they got, but I wonder if they all knew, and the director to an extent, that the movie would flop at its release. Especially with a script that has awful one-liners, funny scenes at moments when it shouldn't be so, and a more or less ridiculous villain in the form of a Cosmetic Company. As such, the movie follows some of the same origins that Michelle Pfeiffer had in Batman Returns, but does it in a more ridiculous way that one wonders what would have happened if the movie had been done with Daniel Waters' original script.About the director, of which I saw his first feature Vidocq, it was evident that he is more at ease working through visual effects and camera shots since this is where he first started his movie career, such as some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's works. There are some nice shots that I liked such as the accelerated day workday in the artists' office as we see Halle Berry coworkers leaving while she finishes her artwork late at night. But in general, it was too easy to see when the computerized version of Halle Berry did her stunts and when the real actress was on set. During this movie experience, I had the feeling that the production was rushed and it hurt the movie's effects. Not only that, Pitof has the annoying habit of switching angles every three seconds, and that becomes a headache to watch even on a small TV screen. So imagine the people that had to watch it in a movie theater's giant screen. Maybe that was one of the reasons why they had to cancel all the IMAX release they intended to do in 3D, apart from a probably rushed post-production schedule.Of the soundtrack, I found it very irritating as it tried to make itself cool, but instead made me laugh for the wrong reasons, at scenes that could have been more dramatic such as Catwoman's rebirth, her final fight with her boss's wife, and her first costume dress-up as she puts herself some makeup and cuts her hair everywhere. And with the way she does it, it's a wonder she didn't cut her ears or gouged her eyes.In the end, I think this movie experience hurt the character's chance of success in any movie done without Batman's presence, and the only way it could have been saved was if the artists involved had done their movie with a better script.",1,Dreadful movie experience,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,3684,"['When', 'first', 'learned', 'movie', 'Catwoman', 'heard', 'public', 'reception', 'first', 'trailers', 'where', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'barking', 'dogs', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'Warner', 'studios', 'had', 'release', 'new', 'trailers', 'scene', 'made', 'moviegoers', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'everybody', 'who', 'saw', 'trailers', 'did', 'laugh', 'am', 'certain', 'everyone', 'knew', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'rough', 'ride', 'release', 'Especially', 'when', 'had', 'reshoot', 'whole', 'new', 'ending', 'pre-screening', 'reactions', 'were', 'bad', 'However', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'public', 'critics', 'certain', 'actors', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'admitted', 'movie', 'was', 'time', 'release', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'Pitof', 'movie', 'director', 'have', 'blamed', 'film', 'failure', 'However', 'think', 'movie', 'main', 'mistake', 'was', 'was', 'caught', 'Development', 'Hell', 'went', 'twelve', 'years', 'project', 'switched', 'writers', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'original', 'story', 'sequel', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'ending', 'Daniel', 'Waters', 'wrote', 'became', 'something', 'else', 'mean', 'derivative', 'story', 'where', 'intimidated', 'graphic', 'designer', 'working', 'two', 'unpleasant', 'Cosmetic', 'company', 'bosses', 'drown', 'become', 'woman-cat', 'entity', 'who', 'identity', 'Catwoman', 'wearing', 'costume', 'made', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'actors', 'can', 'say', 'everyone', 'cast', 'gave', 'best', 'what', 'got', 'wonder', 'knew', 'director', 'extent', 'movie', 'would', 'flop', 'release', 'Especially', 'script', 'awful', 'one-liners', 'funny', 'scenes', 'moments', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'more', 'less', 'ridiculous', 'villain', 'form', 'Cosmetic', 'Company', 'such', 'movie', 'same', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'had', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'Daniel', 'Waters', 'original', 'director', 'saw', 'first', 'feature', 'Vidocq', 'was', 'evident', 'more', 'ease', 'working', 'visual', 'effects', 'camera', 'shots', 'where', 'first', 'started', 'movie', 'career', 'such', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'works', 'are', 'nice', 'shots', 'liked', 'such', 'accelerated', 'day', 'workday', 'artists', 'office', 'see', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'coworkers', 'leaving', 'artwork', 'late', 'night', 'general', 'was', 'too', 'easy', 'see', 'when', 'computerized', 'version', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'did', 'stunts', 'when', 'real', 'actress', 'was', 'set', 'movie', 'experience', 'had', 'feeling', 'production', 'was', 'rushed', 'hurt', 'movie', 'effects', 'Not', 'only', 'Pitof', 'annoying', 'habit', 'switching', 'angles', 'three', 'seconds', 'headache', 'watch', 'even', 'small', 'TV', 'screen', 'So', 'imagine', 'people', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'theater', 'giant', 'screen', 'Maybe', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'had', 'cancel', 'IMAX', 'release', 'intended', 'do', '3D', 'apart', 'probably', 'rushed', 'post-production', 'schedule.Of', 'soundtrack', 'found', 'very', 'irritating', 'tried', 'make', 'cool', 'instead', 'made', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'dramatic', 'such', 'Catwoman', 'rebirth', 'final', 'fight', 'boss', 'wife', 'first', 'costume', 'dress-up', 'makeup', 'hair', 'everywhere', 'way', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'ears', 'gouged', 'end', 'think', 'movie', 'experience', 'hurt', 'character', 'chance', 'success', 'movie', 'done', 'Batman', 'presence', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'saved', 'was', 'artists', 'involved', 'had', 'done', 'movie', 'better', 'script']",N/A

Halle is as luscious as ever.First of all, this is basic comic book fare.  Therefore those of you expecting a Masterpiece Theatre production should get a grip.Of course the plot may not have been overwhelming.  But neither was it in Superman, Spider Man, Hellboy, Hulk, or Spider Man II for that matter.And why would Halle attach herself to a project such as this?  There are infinitely more important intangibles here at work.How many young girls of color ever get to have such a beautiful, award-winning actress, of color, personify the empowerment of women?  I submit that Catwoman is a wonderful exercise in showing how pivotal one's blossoming can be - the movie also addresses the dilemma of accepting responsibility for one's own actions as well an interesting foray into choosing good over evil (or vice-versa).Of course I have seen movies with better plots, tighter screenplays, more inticate direction, more elaborate sets, blah, blah, blah.One thing is certain:  NONE of them have Halle Berry slinking up and down the street as Catwoman, the LAST Dominatrix, so sexy and fectching and just plain WORKIN' NERVES!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it just doesn't get much better than THAT!!!!!The movie was fun. Did it need (or purport to be) more than that? I daresay any of the other recent comic book adaptations provided much more either and yet critics were infinitely kinder.  No matter.  The nature of the beast.Halle and company made a fun, entertaining movie that teaches basic life lessons in a familiar millieu.

860536,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B00064MW6A,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[1, 3]","Catwoman - where do I begin? Well, it's not the worst movie, but certainly wont be a movie that I would consider watching again.The story starts off with Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), a quiet woman, with no self-confidence working in a cosmetics company. She is asked to design a new look for a new product. However, when she goes to meet her boss to return the final draft before midnight, she arrives at the place at a wrong time and sees something she isn't supposed to, leading to deadly consequences. Later, she recovers and acquires new cat-like powers and tracks down her enemies.Well, let's start off with the plus points of this movie. Halle Berry looks really sweet during the first few minutes of this movie with her long hair while playing the nave Patience Phillips. Even when she gets back at the party people next door (for making too much noise) with her new powers, is nice to watch. However, the whole movie goes downhill when she turns into Catwoman, cuts her hair and wears a disgraceful costume to hide her identity. I have no idea what the costume designers of this movie were thinking; Catwoman is supposed to look sexy and mysterious, but when Halle wears this so-called outfit and uses her whip, she doesn't look, forget graceful, even bearable to watch! Although I wouldn't say she acted her worst in this movie (since none of the other actors acted well anyway), I am definitely baffled as to why she decided to act in this movie in the first place. At least I applaud her for having courage to show up at the Razzies (awards given for the worst films of the year), and accepting her worst actress of the year award with dignity. She can act really well, but she should stop choosing stupid roles for movies like Catwoman and Gothika that could ruin her career.Another annoying aspect of this movie was the background score/music/soundtrack, whatever you call it. We hear the same background music throughout the whole movie, which makes it really annoying to just watch the scenes. I mean, at least change the music at least in one scene. I feel like I was listening to Mis-teeq's `Scandalous' song throughout the movie. However, I didn't think director Pitof did an extremely terrible job at directing this film, as everyone else says he did. I mean, horrible directing would mean you would have no idea what in the world was going on. The direction was pretty ok, with good special effects, and at least a bit fast-paced. The script on the other hand, well was below average, but not completely despicable.The last reason as to why I find this movie awkward is because after watching the whole thing, I don't even know whether Catwoman is a good or a bad person. In one scene, she fights robbers who are robbing a jewelry store, and the next minute, she steals the jewelry herself? It doesn't make any sense! Why did the writers even make a script for this movie, if they didn't even know what makes Catwoman special??I gave this a 3 - star rating, because as I mentioned, I did like the first few moments of the movie before Halle Berry becomes Catwoman and the special effects of this movie. I expected a disastrous movie after reading the reviews of the critics, but it's not THAT bad, even if it isn't that good either.",3,A little below average!,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,3256,"['Catwoman', 'where', 'do', 'begin', 'Well', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'certainly', 'wont', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'consider', 'watching', 'again.The', 'story', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'quiet', 'woman', 'self-confidence', 'working', 'cosmetics', 'company', 'asked', 'design', 'new', 'look', 'new', 'product', 'However', 'when', 'meet', 'boss', 'return', 'final', 'draft', 'midnight', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'sees', 'something', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'leading', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'Later', 'recovers', 'new', 'cat-like', 'powers', 'tracks', 'down', 'enemies.Well', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'plus', 'points', 'movie', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'really', 'sweet', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'long', 'hair', 'playing', 'nave', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'Even', 'when', 'back', 'party', 'people', 'door', 'making', 'too', 'much', 'noise', 'new', 'powers', 'nice', 'watch', 'However', 'whole', 'movie', 'downhill', 'when', 'Catwoman', 'hair', 'disgraceful', 'costume', 'hide', 'identity', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'costume', 'designers', 'movie', 'were', 'thinking', 'Catwoman', 'supposed', 'look', 'sexy', 'mysterious', 'when', 'Halle', 'so-called', 'outfit', 'whip', ""n't"", 'look', 'forget', 'graceful', 'even', 'bearable', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'acted', 'worst', 'movie', 'none', 'other', 'actors', 'acted', 'well', 'anyway', 'am', 'definitely', 'baffled', 'why', 'decided', 'act', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'least', 'applaud', 'having', 'courage', 'show', 'up', 'Razzies', 'awards', 'given', 'worst', 'films', 'year', 'accepting', 'worst', 'actress', 'year', 'award', 'dignity', 'can', 'act', 'really', 'well', 'should', 'stop', 'choosing', 'stupid', 'roles', 'movies', 'Catwoman', 'Gothika', 'could', 'ruin', 'career.Another', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'background', 'score/music/soundtrack', 'call', 'hear', 'same', 'background', 'music', 'whole', 'movie', 'really', 'annoying', 'just', 'watch', 'scenes', 'mean', 'least', 'change', 'music', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'feel', 'was', 'listening', 'Mis-teeq', 'Scandalous', 'song', 'movie', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'director', 'Pitof', 'did', 'extremely', 'terrible', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'mean', 'horrible', 'directing', 'would', 'mean', 'would', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'world', 'was', 'going', 'direction', 'was', 'pretty', 'ok', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'least', 'bit', 'fast-paced', 'script', 'other', 'hand', 'well', 'was', 'below', 'average', 'not', 'completely', 'despicable.The', 'last', 'reason', 'why', 'find', 'movie', 'awkward', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Catwoman', 'good', 'bad', 'person', 'one', 'scene', 'robbers', 'who', 'are', 'robbing', 'jewelry', 'store', 'next', 'minute', 'jewelry', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'did', 'writers', 'even', 'make', 'script', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'Catwoman', 'special', 'gave', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'mentioned', 'did', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'movie', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Catwoman', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'expected', 'disastrous', 'movie', 'reading', 'reviews', 'critics', 'not', 'THAT', 'bad', 'even', ""n't"", 'that', 'good']",N/A

Halle Berry at least did some of her fighting.  I love this movie becuase it reminds me of the classic Pam Grier flicks.  The whole revenge thing is always a good plot.  And, I'm a cat person more or less.  But, all that aside, ""Catwoman"" is really very good.  The plot is simple and ""campy"" (just like the legendary Pam Grier films).  Patience Phillips comes across a conspiracey and is murdered because she ""knows"" to much.  She comes back becuase this cat has some funky breath and gives her super powers.  That's about as believeable as a radio-active spider.  I hate spiders.  Getting off track here... Patience becomes a ""Catwoman"" with cat-like strengths and she puts them to good use (robbery.)  Her claws are diamonds, which I find to be amazing.  There is some romance in there, a few good fight scenes, and Halle Berry.  Need I really say more?  I wouldn't listen to the critics, they just get paid to judge.  Like anything else in life, it's what you like.  I happen to LOVE ""Catwoman.""

860539,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00064MW6A,Reviewer,"[6, 9]","What a nightmare.  Somebody pinch me and wake me up.  That's what I kept thinking while watching this movie, which turned out to be a truly painful experience.  And I'm not generally a conspiracy theorist, but after enduring ""Catwoman,"" directed by Pitof (who? who?), I'm convinced that someone (or ones) are out to sabotage the careers of both Halle Berry and Sharon Stone (not to mention Benjamin Bratt).  It's one thing to set out to make a ""B"" movie, but to waste such talent and beauty through sustained incompetence (yes, sustained, this movie wasn't filmed in a single day, was it?  Come to think of it, maybe it was...) is nothing short of criminal (cinematically speaking).I do not like to dwell on the negative aspects of any film, and I always attempt to seek out the positive (even most bad movies have something good in them, though you often have to look hard and deep to find it), but in fairness to Halle Berry, it must be noted how badly the script, editing, graphics and visual f/x, choreography and the director-- especially the director-- failed her here.This misfire shouldn't allow us to forget Berry's excellent performances in such films as ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"" and ""Monster's Ball,"" for which she deservedly was awarded an Oscar for Best Actress.  The extent of her talent is undeniable and evidenced by the fact that her presence alone can add the necessary spark and elevate the stature of movies like ""Bulworth"" and ""Die Another Day.""  So the million dollar question is, how did she wind up in this embarrassment?  She (as well as the audience) deserves better.  Obviously, she put her trust in the wrong people this time around, and at the top of that list is the ""director"" of this mishmash, Pitof.I guess the lesson here is that even a major star should be wary when approached with a project that's been placed in the hands of someone whose name sounds like one of those ridiculous vanity plates you try to figure out while sitting at a red light and staring at the car in front of you.  To put this as nicely as possible, Pitof (who? what does that MEAN?) didn't have a clue about what to do with this film, and especially with his actors.  How could this have happened?  He's given all the ingredients (Berry, Stone, Bratt, big budget) to make a prize winning cake and he turns out a lump unfit for consumption.Add to Pitof's incompetence a laughably bad script (even the ability on the part of the viewer to suspend disbelief won't help with this one), bad editing and exceptionally poor computer graphics and visual f/x that look like something left over from the Stone Age of technology (when Catwoman is bounding and leaping about it has the appearance of an early generation video game; she looks more like a frog than a cat) you have a film that should be expunged from the resumes of everyone involved.But, like I said, even a bad movie can have a high note if you look for it, which brings me to the only redeeming aspect of this film, the performance by Alex Borstein as Sally, one of Catwoman's co-workers.  Best known as the voice of Lois Griffin in TVs ""The Family Guy,"" Borstein has a charismatic presence that, within the context of this film at any rate, outshines even Berry and Stone.  Better off for all concerned had this movie been titled ""Sally,"" with Borstein given top billing and accordant screen time.Unfortunately, too, for all concerned, ""Catwoman"" will enjoy it's full nine lives on the shelves of video stores everywhere.  Just keep in mind, when you come to this shelf, pick up ""The Cat's Meow,""  ""The Cat In the Hat,"" ""Cat People."" ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,"" or anything with ""Cat"" in the title that isn't followed by ""Woman.""  Take it from me, you'll feel a lot better in the morning.",1,How Bad Can A Movie Be?

There are no laughs, there is no originality. There is no acting, no direction, no talent. What little action there is has been done so many times before, and so much better than this. There is, in fact, nothing at all that could possibly induce me to think of this shambolic and wasteful excuse for a movie with anything other than total contempt.Jim Balent, he knows Catwoman. Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt, they knew Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer, in my opinion, is the definitive Catwoman. Halle Berry is very clearly landing a paycheque. She, in vulgar parlance, stinks. If you're a fan of hers, avoid this movie, it's upsetting to watch a woman who clearly has talent sell herself so very, very short, and if you're not a fan,still do not see this movie. She'll most likely turn you off all Superhero movies until the end of time. Dull, tedious, predictable, and laughable (the Meeow scene and the purring?? What the hell were you thinking, Halle??), Ms. Berry's ""performance"" (if such trash could indeed be called a performance) is at best, offensive, and at worst, the personification of everything that's wrong with the current trends of Image-Driven Hollywood.The supporting cast are embarrassing. The Fat Friend, the stock Boyfriend, and the utterly ridiculous role of Cat-Yoda as played by Frances Conroy (who, it must be said, simply does not belong here) are all hugely homogenous and throwaway, and Sharon Stone as the evil Laurel Hedare is completely pointless. She is not glamorous enough to be believable as the Supermodel-turned-Businesswoman and not strong enough a presence on-screen to be believable as the Villianess.Direction, as with so many other of the second-rate Superhero movies that studios seem to be churning out these days, relies far too heavily on BAD computer-generated sequences and seizure-inducing flash-shot fight scenes, so the whole visual 'feel' of the movie is one of regurgitated television-standard nonsense. When compared to recent Action classics like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" it pales into nothingness. Get a clue, Hollywood: fans of action want to see real people performing real stunts, and not a slowmo 30 frames-per-second CGI Halle Berry Butt-In-Pleather floating up a wall to avoid gunshots.I can't tell you in one single review how truly awful this movie is. And I'm a fan of bad movies, on a superficial level. 'Mommie Dearest', 'The Howling', 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' - all of them have comedy value. 'Catwoman'?

However, while I will admit that it is not the best movie ever made, and does not have the something-for-everybody appeal that Spider-Man 2 has, Catwoman deserves a fair chance.Halle Berry plays the mousy, insecure Patience Philips, whom after coming across some incriminating evidence, is killed by her boss, played by Sharon Stone. However, a bunch of cats find her dead body, and bring her back to life (i.e. a cat has nine lives). After this, Patience becomes the sexy confident Catwoman, whom has many catlike qualities (such as being very sleek and subtle one moment and savage the next, landing on her feet after falling from a high height, and being able to jump long distances to name others).Berry and Stone are both very good in their respective roles, and while the action and special effects are very watchable after that, the story falls apart. The whole &quot;problem&quot; she is trying to solve (every superhero has one in a film) is just plain ridiculous. Benjamin Bratt, who plays her boyfriend, and the woman who plays her horny best friend are both totally wasted in this, almost tempting me to shout at the movie screen &quot;Why are they even there?!&quot; One final flaw is that Catwoman is half good and half evil, placing the audience in an awkward position since they don't know whether they should be routing for her, or routing against her.This movie is far from perfect; it will probably win more Razzies than Oscars, Golden Globes, or even People's Choice awards, and the chances of a sequel or good box office seem highly unlikely at this point. However, I do believe the film deserves a fair chance.

860546,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00064MW6A,Roland E. Zwick,"[25, 34]","I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards ""Catwoman,""  for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world.  In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products.  When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen.  However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.The best parts of ""Catwoman"" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her.  It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society.  Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well.  Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie.  Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her ""fading"" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"").  Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film.  Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me.  And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long.  The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable ""Catwoman"" turned out to be.",3,unpretentious comic book film,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,2839,"['admire', 'approach', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'taken', 'towards', 'Catwoman', 'rather', 'setting', 'tale', 'same', 'dark', 'cavernous', 'largely', 'computer-generated', 'metropolis', 'are', 'used', 'most', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'chosen', 'keep', 'rooted', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'similar', 'way', 'manage', 'keep', 'Catwoman', 'believable', 'vulnerable', 'realistic', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'beautiful', 'beguiling', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'title', 'role.Berry', 'Patience', 'Phillips', 'pretty', 'less-than-glamorous', 'advertising', 'artist', 'who', 'major', 'cosmetics', 'company', 'ruled', 'over', 'tyrannical', 'CEO', 'equally', 'ruthless', 'wife', 'former', 'spokes', 'model', 'products', 'When', 'Patience', 'mistakenly', 'corporate', 'bigwigs', 'discussing', 'fact', 'one', 'best-selling', 'creams', 'causing', 'women', 'become', 'seriously', 'ill', 'dutifully', 'murdered', 'couple', 'boss', 'henchmen', 'However', 'not', 'lost', 'Patience', 'unbeknownst', 'been', 'chosen', 'receive', 'special', 'gift', 'reincarnation', 'form', 'cat', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'subject', 'laws', 'nature', 'society.The', 'best', 'parts', 'Catwoman', 'involve', 'Patience', 'incrementally', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'catlike', 'attitude', 'demeanor', 'slowly', 'dawning', 'realization', 'what', 'happening', 'awhile', 'accept', 'surprising', 'turn', 'events', 'when', 'quite', 'literally', 'new', 'woman', 'bold', 'self-confident', 'willing', 'take', 'oppressors', 'evildoers', 'society', 'Patience', 'paired', 'up', 'attractive', 'police', 'officer', 'apparently', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'duty', 'city', 'who', 'gradually', 'realize', 'who', 'what', 'as', 'well', 'Berry', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'make', 'very', 'appealing', 'romantic', 'couple', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'Also', 'impressive', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'credit', 'allowing', 'appear', 'role', 'fading', 'beauty', 'plays', 'significant', 'part', 'shades', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'playing', 'Blanche', 'DuBois', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Stone', 'villainous', 'wife', 'company', 'CEO', 'who', 'determined', 'make', 'sure', 'Catwoman', ""n't"", 'spill', 'beans', 'defective', 'product.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'probably', 'least', 'successful', 'aspect', 'film', 'Catwoman', 'jumping', 'rooftop', 'rooftop', 'awful', 'lot', 'CGI', 'effects', 'movie', 'occasionally', 'go', 'auto', 'pilot', 'especially', 'end', 'though', 'thankfully', 'not', 'usually', 'very', 'long', 'literal', 'cat', 'fight', 'Berry', 'Stone', 'finale', 'necessary', 'guess', 'really', 'rather', 'silly', 'overall.Still', 'considering', 'pounding', 'movie', 'received', 'critics', 'audiences', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'summer', '2004', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'Catwoman', 'turned', 'out', 'be']",N/A

But in a world that has given us ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"", ""Dungeons & Dragons"" and ""Starship Troopers: Hero of the Federation"", that doesn't really say much.I watched this movie because I have a morbid curiosity about bad movies. Particularly, figuring out where they went wrong. And the consensus here is ... pretty much everywhere.Let's start with the story. The villain's dastardly plan revolves around marketing a facial creme that rejuvenates the skin, but, if one stops using it, has some very mean side effects. That's about it. MAKEUP! Oh no! The world will never be able to recover from that diabolical blow! Sure, the Joker (in Tim Burton's BATMAN) used personal grooming items seemingly at random to inflict mild cases of death on the unsuspecting public in his sadistic mind game to cause horror among the population of Gotham, but we're talking about a creme here that actually makes you look uglier if you stop using it! NOOOOOOO!Okay, snark aside, I just couldn't care about the ""evil plot"" except for the fact that they killed our heroine to keep their little secret.Which brings us to the next point. Giving Catwoman superhuman powers because she is brought back to life by some mystical Egyptian cat? Really? You're going to stick with that? That's not quite the MO for this character. Sure, she may act catty at times, but there is nothing supernatural about her. Adding this mystical element just distances the audience even further from the character. Revenge we understand. Slight insanity? Got it. Superhuman cat powers? You lost me.Then there's the kinetic, motion-sickness-inducing direction. Do you think you could lock that camera down for a minute or two? Please? The lighting and coloring don't help in the least. It is just way too visually busy. I understand trying for ""artistic"" filming, but this is ridiculous.In the end, the only reason I gave this more than one star is that, for those who want to see how to ruin a movie, this is something you could actually sit through and take notes. As the movie ends, you truly don't care about anyone or anything in the whole movie. So it gets one extra star for the education it gives in bad film making.",2,Bat Kitty!

Some films, like ""Superman"" and ""Spider-Man,"" manage to capture the complete essence of the character in such a way that the whole absurdity of what's actually HAPPENING is lost in the magic of the story.  Good special effects are certainly part of this, but we believed Superman could fly (via an awkward harness) long before a CG Spider-Man swung from the NYC rooftops.Having set the bar for comic-book/cinema translations then, let me just say that ""Catwoman"" was pure crap.  No fault to Halle Berry, either: she's a fine actress, worthy of Oscar accolades and other heady awards.  No, sadly, it was everything ELSE that sucked about this movie:  the plot premise, the writing, the leather bra...even the special effects were off, as if they alone were saddled with the chore of saving this cinematic turd, and they couldn't quite get the job done.  There's nothing here that captures in any way the comic-book complexity of the character of Catwoman, and that's what makes these types of films sink:  the expected notion that all you have to do is put an actor in a costume and let 'er rip.  No, no, no...there's a whole CHARACTER in there that's dying to get out!  Even ""Elektra,"" which wasn't GREAT, had clarifying moments when you got beneath the surface and discovered more to the actress than (another) bad leather bra.If you need your Halle fix, check out ""X-Men"" or ""Monster's Ball"" or even the older ""Boomerang.""

860558,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00064MW6A,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[2, 3]","Why is Catwoman a disappointment? Let's put things in perspective from a creative standpoint. Costing over $145 million dollars, this film based on one of DC comics' most popular characters has Halle Berry in the lead role wearing tight black leather fighting Sharon Stone. With all those elements in place you'd expect a top-notch film and not this poorly made disaster hated by comic fans and moviegoers worldwide.The primary reason this film is so bad is the screenplay. It took three writers to write this script and none of them earned the six figure salaries they probably got each for writing this dreck. The dialogue throughout the film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s and campy puns. The story comes together through a series of convenient coincidences, a Deus Ex Machina, and worst of all the movie starts with a flashback. These are several critical mistakes first-time screenwriters make, when trained professionals with credits under their belt continue to make the same errors it's just embarrassing. These three guys need to go back to school; they don't know anything about writing at all.Instead of adapting the great DC comic book character Selina Kyle and Gotham City, The plot revolves around Patience Phillips, a mousy Lake City resident who works at Hedare Cosmetics. She stumbles on the secret of Beau-line face cream and is killed by her boss. Left for dead, she's licked by a magical Egyptian Mau cat, becomes Catwoman, and goes out to seek revenge on her killers at the Hedare Corporation. Wearing a dominatrix outfit, this Catwoman is supposed to be the symbol of ""21st Century"" female empowerment; ironically the way she dresses and acts in this film Catwoman sets women back about five or six hundred years. After a series of incredibly stupid coincidences Detective Tom Lone (Inspector Gadget is smarter than this moron) figures out Patience the woman he's been dating is Catwoman and locks her up. But she escapes and has a yawner of a fight with Laurel Hedare now sporting Stone hard skin from the face cream she's been using. Catwoman lives to fight another day, but chances are she won't be using those nine lives in a sequel.First time French director Pitof's inept direction combined with the terrible script makes this film impossible to watch. His camerawork is fine for a fast paced music video or commercial, but not for a movie. The quick cutting camera moves so fast that you don't get a chance to see the story he's trying to tell. Worse, he cuts and pastes scenes from Spider-man, Dark Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Batman, and Smallville into his movie. I wanted to see some originality to his visuals instead of plagiarizing someone else's pictures to tell the story of Catwoman. Some advice to Pitof: First learn that movies are a visual medium where you tell an original story with pictures. Learn to master the craft then you can call yourself a pretentious one-word name.Production values for this film are terrible when you take into account the $145 million budget. Most of the money must have gone to salaries. The sets look like a cheesy TV cop show, and the costumes look like they came out of the Salvation Army dumpster. The CGI looks like that from a Playstation 1 console and the stunt work is bland. Berry can't work the whip at all; her movements show no confidence whatsoever.Halle Berry is gives the worst performance of her career. (SEE B.A.P.S for the now second worst.) She is awful as Patience, and horrid as Catwoman. Her big mistake was trying to copy Ertha Kitt's campy performance and not making the characters her own. Worse, she portrays Catwoman and Patience as one character; that's a big mistake. Actors must approach Superhero characters as two separate roles. Michelle Pfeiffer saw Catwoman and Selina as two distinct characters, that's what made her performance so unforgettable. Michael Keaton, Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire did this as well and gave amazing performances. Benjamin Bratt could have put a cardboard cut out with a cell phone taped to it in most of his scenes, his performance is stiff and uninspired. Worse, he and Berry have NO chemistry. Sharon Stone shows us she hasn't grown as an actress; She's still playing everything like it's Basic Instinct. Sad. Alex Borstien isn't comic relief. She needs to stay on Family Guy.

The script was utterly atrocious; the acting, quite wooden; and even the special effects fall flat.

860563,ALDJB8Q89T8GC,B00064MW6A,SmartguyH,"[3, 5]","Okay, it took me a LOOOONNNGGGG LONNNNGGG time to really be able to see this movie without being biased (because i'm a huge catwoman fan) towards it. But every time it's come on t.v. I would find myself watching it. I decided to actually go to Best Buy to Buy it, that's how much i wanted to see it. Great storyline (they should have just called her Selina Kyle though, I don't know WHY THEY didn't call her that.) But yeah great movie. I would have liked to see on the dvd sketches for the costume, Halle practicing using the whip or cracking it. Maybe some concept designs on what didn't get shot but was on the drawing boards. If Catwoman were not In BAtman Returns and ont the animated series, this movie probably could have been seen by itself but everyone had their idea of what it should have been and that's why people say it's not a good movie. But I bet everyone like myself watches it.Now, my opinion on why it didn't work.CostumeWhen I, like everyone else saw it first I absolutely was pissed off at whoever made it the way it was. I remember even before the movie came out everyone was pissed at the costume and i know by how Halle looked in interviews she knew it was bogus to. I mean come on CSI has been on for a while so common sense of viewers would be to know you can't be half naked b/c you'll leave evidence (DNA, blood if you get stabbed, fingerprints, etc). Not only was the exposed skin a problem but the glittered gloves was dumb and I like a lot of people HATED THE MASK. It was toooooo tall. I mean the ears were all the way up there. Bogus. And the opened toed shoes was dumb too. REallly dumb. I BET if she had a cooler costume it would have worked out better in sales/box office.2. StorylineOkay Catwoman has always been a major thief so they really should have made her want to steal things more. If they were getting pressure from the Parental control (whoever does ratings of movies, then i see why they should have avoided it, but the plotline could have been Catwoman steals from the rich snobby elite clique of clients that have invested in this guy stealing exotic cats (lions, tigers, etc) from jungles and zoos and putting them on display at his own personal mansion. Not only that but later it's revealed some of the investing clients (rich snobs, women, men etc) want to get the cats furs made into coats (sorta like Dalmations movie). That would justify the theft from CAtwoman. Steal from the evil people.Totally dissed the fanbaseIn these kinds of movies with HUGE fanbases, it's a pretty dummmmbbbb BUSINESS MOVE (if you're looking at just for the money)  to take a name, movie, concept and then make a completely different movie with it. That's what they did and it was a dumb move. The fans are the ones that pump in the money to knock the movie into the #1 spot on the box office. They're the ones that see the movie three and four times. (I saw the first X-men movie 3 times even though I wasn't as impressed, but it stayed a little more truer to the comics as far as powers concepts, etc). We're also the ones that help with the DVD sales. So, the creators totally pissed on the fans. Well let me be nice about it. Okay, Catwoman can be compared to vampire movies. Now vampire movies have been done SOOOO MANY TIMES that you can deviate from the classic great vampire movies, because you have to set yourself apart if you wanna get a pat on the shoulder. It's only necessary if you want a medal or soemthing, other thann that you can still do a basic vampire movie. The ones that keep truesst to a vampire (having teeth, and drinking blood are usually the requirements for it to do well)now the problem with this movie is that Catwoman hasn't been done enough times to deviate from the known concept. It would have been different if Michelle Pheifer had done that solo movie (she had a baby i think that's why she dropped out). Or if there were a Catwoman t.v. show, but there hasn't been enough on it, that's why fans were pissed at this movie.I NEVER THOUGHT race was an issue with this b/c one Eartha Kitt was CAtwoman and she did a phenomenal job. Besides with only the hairpiece/ears being different she was basically playing the same role. So that's not an issue. I truly was envisioning Halle with the long hair (like in the first part of the movie) in the purple costume. I would have believed and I would have loved it.Halle I think did say if they revamped it (probably meaning did it like the comics, be more truer to it, like Storm in part 3 of X-men) then she'd do it, and I hope she would. AS a promo someone needs to have a mannequin dressed in the purple outfit to show what could have been. it still can do really well. I think that bootleg independent movie is doing rather well. Though i hate the spandex purple. They should use jogging pants material. it's thicker and more believable.",5,Great movie when you think about it,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,4855,"['Okay', 'took', 'LOOOONNNGGGG', 'LONNNNGGG',

Of course they don't succeed fully, because otherwise it would be a really short movie. So, floating in water, she is rescued by some cats and given quasi superhuman powers.Now she tries to bring the evildoers to justice, save a bunch from people getting seriously ill from using a bad product and have some fun along the way.Even though I compressed the story in a few lines this is way more plot than current blockbusters like ""Transformers"" or ""G.I. Joe"" offer.PQ: The PQ in this movie is simply excellent. I really couldn't find a thing wrong with it. The picture is crystal clear and very sharp even though there was clearly NO Edge Enhancement or DNR used. Blacks are really black. Really this is one of the best PQ I recently encountered on a BDSQ: The TrueHD Soundtrack (which usually hovers around 7mbit/s) is also extremely good. Dialogue is always very crisp and understandable even if a lot goes on in the back. Directionality is very good. Bass is not overused but when they call for it, man it delivers.Extras: Not much there, just a featurette , some deleted scenes (including an alternate Ending)Summary: THIS IS REALLY A GREAT MOVIE.

It's yet another of those ""origins of the superhero"" movies merely laying the groundwork for an abortive franchise.  There's nothing wrong with an ""origins"" story per se, and this one at least has the foresight to turn it into a murder mystery.  Problem is, it takes Patience Phillips (aka Catwoman) approximately 100 minutes to get to precisely the same place the audience is in after just 15: we already know who ""killed"" her and why.  Watching her slowly, painfully - even if gorgeously - discover what we've known all along isn't fun.  It's agonizing.  The saddest thing is, it doesn't need to be this way.  Tim Burton's ""Batman"" showed everyone - fifteen years ago! - how the superhero story can and should be told: just assume everyone already knows who the hero is and where s/he came from, and focus instead on creating a gripping adventure and a wonderful villain; flashback to the ""origins"" story if you like, but why make that the focus if it's going to be dull?  Basically, follow the principles of good storytelling: create a mystery, make us identify with the hero, give the audience reason to keep watching to the end.  Some of the best popcorn movies in recent memory follow precisely that pattern - ""I, Robot"", ""Minority Report"", and the ""X-Men"" series.  In ""Catwoman"", most of the effort (and budget) seems to have been spent on a handful of absurdly edited and utterly unconvincing fight sequences and some ludicrously elaborate fly-overs of the city skyline.  But no amount of digital trickery can compensate for what has got to be the lamest script this year.

Take something else I've reviewed, some reality TV dreck, I dunno - usually it's just full of reviews like ""Shayne really steals the show with his cover of Dancin' In The Moonlight, and now I luv this show 4eva and I luv Shayne 4eva"" by some mindless pondlife, then along comes The Curmudgeon and gives The Truth.But here, it's both too easy and too hard. See, it's too easy because EVERYONE is slating this movie - every review is 2 stars or less and everyone is saying the same thing - that the movie sucks. And here's where it's too hard - it's too hard NOT to join in, because the movie is THAT bad.A lot of people like to bunch together bad comic book movies as a discussion piece, and Catwoman will join that infamous list as its most recent calamity (but by no means the worst - step forward Supergirl for that honour). Now, box office flops usually get put alongside the bad ones, but just because they didn't do well financially doesn't make them bad (the Phantom and the new Punisher are two common names thrown in. Phantom was an excellent homage to the classic 30's serials, giving an old-fashioned sense of adventure with a likable hero, albeit in a silly costume and Punisher was just all kinds of awesome).Catwoman, however, deserved to tank the way it did. And the likes of Phantom and Punisher didn't have either the cash or the media exposure this film did. As much as she attempts to save face nowadays (her post-modern, tongue in cheek ""victory speech"" as she won worst actress), Halle Berry promoted the HELL out of this film, and she really did think she was, ahem, the cats whiskers, trying to convince us all on numerous talk shows that this Catwoman was the sexiest thing on the screen.And, lord, is it quite the opposite. Berry's catwoman is as alluring and sexy as some urine-soaked tramp sitting next to you on a bus. She ranges from acting really badly to just being plain embarrassing. When she's normal Patience Phillips (oh dear) she's bearable, if not exactly Oscar worthy (as she once was), but when she becomes Catwoman you really will be watching through your fingers as she says Miaow, ""purrrrrrrfect"", gets scared of the rain and hisses at dogs. Yes, all of this happens.Add to the mix stereotypical sassy girlfriend, token gay guy making ""funny faces"" at her boyfriend, a ridiculous Sharon Stone and some beyond dodgy CGI and you have one movie that no amount of ""taking it on the chin"" good naturedness will save.Nice Catwoman documentary on the DVD, mind.

I apologize.*&iexcl;Spoiler Alert!* (Not the important plot-related type, but just basic information.)I just watched this movie today (yeah I know, I'm late to the party, as always) and I have to say that this movie was not what I expected. I expected it to be set in Gotham. Wrong! I expected Selina Kyle. Wrong! I expected Batman to be in on the action. Wrong! And lastly, I really did expect this movie to suck. Wrong again! This movie may not have Batman, or Selena, or even Gotham. But the important part is that it stays true to Catwoman's character. It delivers. The stunts are great, it's action packed, and Catwoman acts like she should. People will complain that ""Oh, it's not with Selina!"", and they hate it just for that. The movie explains that there is a history of Catwomen, all around the world. So from the movie's point of view, Selina is just one of those Catwomen. Halle Berry does a great job capturing Catwoman's soul and essence on screen, showing off some impressive moves and highflying kicks. Also, if you buy the Special Edition version, you get a cool look at Catwoman's history of actresses (hosted by Eartha Kit) from the comedic Batman show, to the Tim Burton movie, to the animated series, eventually leading up to Halle.

Now I will agree with most reviewers that Michelle Pfeiffer is the better catwoman of the two but this movie is not Batman Returns people! In fact, it has nothing to due with Batman period which is probably why it received some negative reviews to begin with. I have not read the Catwoman comics so I don't know if this version of Catwoman is based on them or not. As for the film, it has it's corny moments which I won't spoil for anyone except for the scene that has a cat breathing magic fog into Halle's mouth in order to bring her back to life. Halle also has the moves of Catwoman (truthfully, I don't if it was her or special effects).

But the film turned out nothing like that -- in fact, watching it makes me feel more detached from the heroine, the story, the images, or actions.  They are often very campy, sure, and sometimes very bizzare, and sporadically thrilling.  But not campy, bizarre, or thrilling enough to be a minor cult classic.One mistake is awfully empty and uninteresting story.  Patience Philips (Berry) is a timid designer working for a cosmetics company run by Lambert Wilson and his wife Sharon Stone.  But only the company's executives know that the new product contains a harmful substance.And you know, Patience unwittingly comes to know the secret.  and see, she gets killed before the ancient spirit of sacred cat 'Midnight' takes over her body, and she is resurrected.And?  Well, see what Patience/Catwoman does.  It takes much time for her to realize her power, so she, 'partially' losing her memories, goes back to the company where she almost got killed the day before!  As if nothing had happened!OK, that's one of the silly mistakes in the story, but you get more (which I don't point out).  The rest of the film is about Catwoman who struts wearing high-heals, cracking a whip, dressed in black leather.  When you think the film is finally going to be fun (I mean, campy fun), Oscar-winner Halle Berry suddenly snatches meat of raw fish at sushi bar, and swallows it because, you know, she is a cat.  IS she kidding, or what?Benjamin Bratt plays a cop who fell for her, and who does not know her identity.  But how many times have we seen before such kind of cliched police officer who should have checked out several things about his love?  Or, how many times has Banjamin Bratt played a cop before for that matter?  And not-so-good acting from Sharon Stone who just hasn't shown that she can act since the day of 'Casino'?I really tried to like this film, but director Pitof, for all his visul skills, does not know what he really wants to do.

But I guess comic book subjects aren't rocket science. I just can't understand why Oscar winner Halle Berry would claw her way to the bottom so soon.Catwoman (Halle Berry) rises from the spirit of an ancient cat who breathes new life into a lowly ad-woman. By the light of a full moon Catwoman stalks her prey beginning with ancient jewelry, as a ""cat-burglar"" and suddenly becoming a crime fighting kitty with heart. Both in and out of costume Catwoman seduces Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) with her feline charms. The bad guys run a cosmetics company that fights the aging but makes one sick in the process. Laurel and George Hedare (Sharon Stone/Lambert Wilson) eventually become Miss Kitty's prey in this predictable tale out of Gotham.This overly done film is pretty much a music video for pretty little Halle Berry to strut her well developed stiff to. So it will always appeal to the easily pleased young male mindset. However it is a disappointment to see such a wonderful actress fall so low in the ranks after winning a well deserved Oscar (for Monster's Ball). The costumes and prowling scenes are posed for the young video game enthusiast. The action shots are obviously computer generated and the cuts between the two are simply horrible. Bratt and Berry are convincing enough as romantic leads but somehow lose their context within this movie. Sharon Stone is the one standout, playing a more than convincing aging menace to society.....and she looks great doing it. If you are a Gotham fan looking for good Catwoman material try Michelle Pfeiffer in the role in Tim Burton's film ""Batman Returns"" (1992), Pfeiffer does a much better job as the playful kitty.

It's your standard mousy-hero-becomes-vigilante comic book tale, although the stunning Miss Berry is never convincing as a wallflower. That's one of the basic problems: Because Halle is never believable as her character, we never become involved with her adventures. The lackluster screenplay doesn't help either; this is a straight-to-video endeavor masquerading as a major theatrical release. (Did someone fish this script out of Shannon Tweed's garbage dumpster?) Even the Catwoman costume seems like a slapped-together afterthought; wearing it, Berry looks like she's all set to star in the inevitable XXX-rated porno parody of the film. Benjamin Bratt hangs around to supply the obligatory hunky love interest, while Sharon Stone turns up as the equally perfunctory rich bitch villainess.
