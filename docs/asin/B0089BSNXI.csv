1548923,A5DPN1SAYI84M,B0089BSNXI,Jim Harwood,"[9, 9]","It appears that Fox pulled an old video master out of mothballs for this one.  Lots of noise and other artifacts in the image.  Colors are vibrant, though everything is muddy.  Doesn't look like accurate Technicolor, but a third or fourth generation Eastmancolor interpretation.  The presentation won't be too bad on smaller screens, so limit to viewing on 40"" screens or less.  Projected onto a large screen, the image falls apart.  They definitely need to do a remaster on this one.

1548924,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,B0089BSNXI,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[1, 1]","This technicolor love story of 1946 stars maureen o'hara.  What more can anyone say?  She always comes across as beautiful, thoughtful, intelligent, and accomplished.  She is a dream of a perfect woman. Her thick red chestnut hair and creamy white face:  these are features rare in Hollywood these days.Cast as a prim and poised music school director, she is shown Leading the student orchestra in a classical piece for parents and patrons.  I loved how she is whisked away immediately on the train by Harry James yet she doesn't blink a lash when his full band and four expert crooners burst into a big number around her. Babe continues to read her book with her hornrimmed glasses and pinned up hair and sensible shoes.Needless to say, a quick trip to New York turns into a big adventure.  She suddenly becomes determined to be sexually alluring and dresses accordingly to get some wolf whistles.The entire story turns on music.  She is the heroine who slowly becomes convinced that her bobbysoxer students are not entirely wrong in their adoration of crooners and big band dancing.  What she previously snubbed and denigrated, she comes to see as enchanting.Second to her fine acting and Irish classic beauty, we have the less handsome Harry James, famous band leader who had discovered frank Sinatra. He is persistent but a little lame with the ladies.  However on trumpet he is a master, even for those of us less than enthusiastic about blaring trumpets.  Strange to think that it is almost 70 years later. Now young folks haven't even heard of him.  Films like these showcase his talent for eternity.  There he is in technicolor for us all!  Dashing and debonair!These old films are a great treasure.  Sometimes the colors are so saturated and vivid it is not clear that they are real.  Was she really wearing fluorescent green gloves and matching top with a red skirt and purple hat?  I caught it on Turner Classic Network last night and enjoyed it without changing channels once",5,"Sappy, sweet, perfect acting and great music of 1940's plus Maureen O'hara!",1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,1987,"['technicolor', 'love', 'story', '1946', 'stars', 'maureen', ""o'hara"", 'What', 'more', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'always', 'across', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'accomplished', 'dream', 'perfect', 'woman', 'thick', 'red', 'chestnut', 'hair', 'creamy', 'white', 'face', 'are', 'features', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'days.Cast', 'prim', 'poised', 'music', 'school', 'director', 'shown', 'Leading', 'student', 'orchestra', 'classical', 'piece', 'parents', 'patrons', 'loved', 'how', 'whisked', 'away', 'immediately', 'train', 'Harry', 'James', 'yet', ""n't"", 'blink', 'lash', 'when', 'full', 'band', 'four', 'expert', 'crooners', 'burst', 'big', 'number', 'Babe', 'read', 'book', 'hornrimmed', 'glasses', 'pinned', 'up', 'hair', 'sensible', 'shoes.Needless', 'say', 'quick', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'big', 'adventure', 'suddenly', 'determined', 'be', 'sexually', 'alluring', 'dresses', 'accordingly', 'get', 'wolf', 'whistles.The', 'entire', 'story', 'turns', 'music', 'heroine', 'who', 'slowly', 'convinced', 'bobbysoxer', 'students', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'adoration', 'crooners', 'big', 'band', 'dancing', 'What', 'previously', 'snubbed', 'denigrated', 'see', 'enchanting.Second', 'fine', 'acting', 'Irish', 'classic', 'beauty', 'have', 'less', 'handsome', 'Harry', 'James', 'famous', 'band', 'leader', 'who', 'had', 'discovered', 'frank', 'Sinatra', 'persistent', 'little', 'lame', 'ladies', 'However', 'trumpet', 'master', 'even', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'blaring', 'trumpets', 'Strange', 'think', 'almost', '70', 'years', 'later', 'Now', 'young', 'folks', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'Films', 'showcase', 'talent', 'eternity', 'technicolor', 'Dashing', 'debonair', 'old', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'treasure', 'colors', 'are', 'so', 'saturated', 'vivid', 'not', 'clear', 'are', 'real', 'Was', 'really', 'wearing', 'fluorescent', 'green', 'gloves', 'matching', 'top', 'red', 'skirt', 'purple', 'hat', 'caught', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Network', 'last', 'night', 'enjoyed', 'changing', 'channels', 'once']",N/A
