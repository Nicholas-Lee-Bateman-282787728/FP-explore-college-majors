But I'm guessing that anyone seeing this movie who didn't know who Truman Capote is would not even think of his name. It's not at all like his novels.Buddy (Eric Lloyd) was left with three aunts and an uncle in the house they inherited from their mother (Buddy's grandmother) when Buddy's parents broke up. He's been there for about two years, and has become very close to his Aunt Sook (Patty Duke), the one who is considered ""slow"" or ""not quite right."" The authoritarian of the family is his oldest aunt, Jennie (Piper Laurie), who apparently raised the others when their mother died. Bossy old thing who clearly disapproves of how close Buddy is with Sook.The story opens on Fruitcake Weather: the day every November when Sook decides it is time for her and Buddy to make their annual batch of fruitcakes for Christmas gifts. They decide that this year they must make 30 of them -- later raised to 32 as trade for the whiskey from local bootlegger to put in the cakes.The story is mostly a character study of the different somewhat odd people in this small southern town where Buddy is happy. But the crisis comes when Aunt Jennie decides he must be sent off to a military academy, since he's spending too much time with Sook, cooking and reading and flying kites and -- well, being a kid.It's a charming little story, and Buddy is a lovable kid.",4,Charming Truman Capote Story,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1438,"['story', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'biographical', 'extent', 'read', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'movie', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'think', 'name', 'not', 'novels.Buddy', 'Eric', 'Lloyd', 'was', 'left', 'three', 'aunts', 'uncle', 'house', 'inherited', 'mother', 'Buddy', 'grandmother', 'when', 'Buddy', 'parents', 'broke', 'up', 'been', 'there', 'two', 'years', 'become', 'very', 'close', 'Aunt', 'Sook', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'one', 'who', 'considered', 'slow', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'authoritarian', 'family', 'oldest', 'aunt', 'Jennie', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'who', 'apparently', 'raised', 'others', 'when', 'mother', 'died', 'Bossy', 'old', 'thing', 'who', 'clearly', 'disapproves', 'how', 'close', 'Buddy', 'Sook.The', 'story', 'Fruitcake', 'Weather', 'day', 'November', 'when', 'Sook', 'time', 'Buddy', 'make', 'annual', 'batch', 'fruitcakes', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'decide', 'year', 'must', 'make', '30', 'later', 'raised', '32', 'trade', 'whiskey', 'local', 'bootlegger', 'put', 'cakes.The', 'story', 'mostly', 'character', 'study', 'different', 'somewhat', 'odd', 'people', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'where', 'Buddy', 'happy', 'crisis', 'when', 'Aunt', 'Jennie', 'must', 'be', 'sent', 'off', 'military', 'academy', 'spending', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Sook', 'cooking', 'reading', 'flying', 'kites', 'well', 'being', 'kid.It', 'charming', 'little', 'story', 'Buddy', 'lovable', 'kid']",N/A

The nostalgic remembrances of a young boy's relationship with his spinster aunt is truly beautiful.  Bittersweet and poignant, this Hallmark movie version expands upon Truman Capote's autobiographical narrative to create some unforgettable characters.  Patti Duke turns in a touching performance as the childlike Suke, whose innocence and loving heart endear her to her nephew, Buddy.  Eric Lloyd turns in an unsurpassed performance as Buddy, and the chemistry between him and Duke is wonderful.  Piper Laurie is mesmerizing as Suke's practical and stern eldest sister, Jenny.  At turns, I loathed her and felt empathy toward her.  The supporting cast is equally wonderful.  I particularly liked the added plot strand of Buddy's tentative yet endearing friendship with a girl his own age named Rachel.Set during the Depression era in the Deep South, this film chronicles a Christmas season in which seven-year-old Buddy and his Aunt Suke bake fruitcakes for neighbors, family, and even strangers.  This annual project is a cherished Christmas tradition, as is decorating the tree with homemade ornaments, (Buddy's drawings of cats and fish, and angels made from Hershey's chocolate tinfoil), and the exchanging of homemade kites every Christmas morning.  The most beautiful scene in the film occurs when Buddy and Suke fly their creations on a beautiful Christmas day.  Buddy and Suke relish their time together.  However, when Suke's sister, Jenny, begins worrying that Buddy is spending too much time with his aunt, circumstance may tear them apart.This film will truly inspire you to take some time away from your frantic Christmas rush and to enter a simpler time where love and beauty were cherished.

I also prefer not having Capote's voice-over narration in this one.
