Rob Lowe, flat, boring and unconvincing as an actor.  I refuse to believe that this trial was as depicted in this movie.  Tiny snippets of information were mentioned with nothing to back them up.  No explanation of this &#34;fictional?&#34; nanny, was she real?  It made no sense and I guess I am glad I rented it if only to serve as a springboard for what not to watch.  Wow, amazingly bad.  I gave it two stars but I am taking one back.",1,Very poorly done.,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,532,"['movie', 'was', 'done', 'outline', 'anything', 'value', 'outline', 'heading', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'flat', 'boring', 'unconvincing', 'actor', 'refuse', 'believe', 'trial', 'was', 'depicted', 'movie', 'Tiny', 'snippets', 'information', 'were', 'mentioned', 'nothing', 'back', 'up', 'explanation', '34', 'fictional', '34', 'nanny', 'was', 'real', 'made', 'sense', 'guess', 'am', 'glad', 'rented', 'only', 'serve', 'springboard', 'what', 'not', 'watch', 'Wow', 'amazingly', 'bad', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'am', 'taking', 'one', 'back']",Prosecuting Casey Anthony
