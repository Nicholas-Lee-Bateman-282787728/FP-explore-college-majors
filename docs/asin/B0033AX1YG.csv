But it is truly an awesome collection with Gary playing many of his very best songs. The CD runs 68 min. with songs from '90, '95, '97, '99, and 2001. The real meat of the set are the two DVDs. DVD 1 runs 2hrs and DVD 2 runs close to 2 1/2hrs. Another thing that is nice is no songs are repeated on the DVDs. Very, very cool. It is a great collection. I wish there had been songs from 2007's ""Close As You Get"" and 2008's ""Bad For you Baby"", but that would've meant another DVD. If you're still on the fence, hop off and pick this up.

I like all these concerts except for the 1997 one: what was he thinking! 1990 is the best of the lot, BY FAR!  We start with outstanding video editing and great sound. Boy, his guitar sounds great. The crowd is close up, and very active. You got to like that sexy moves girl in the balcony. Midnight Blues is outstanding, but I like Texas Strut and, you are into a great treat when you hear Gary's version of Roy Buchanan's Messiah instrumental. This is the greatest guitar pop playing you will ever hear, and, easily wortth the price of this whole package!! I also like Gary's facial looks, well captured on video. On the 1999 outing, I like the note exchanges between Moore and his keyboard man, on Further on down the road. I must admit that Gary's material is not the best, but oh this guy can play guitar!!",5,THE BEST!!!,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,903,"['Dave', 'Hole', 'best', 'slide', 'guitarist', 'AND', '-Gary', 'Moore', 'best', 'single', 'note', 'pop', 'player', 'like', 'concerts', '1997', 'one', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', '1990', 'best', 'lot', 'BY', 'FAR', 'start', 'outstanding', 'video', 'editing', 'great', 'sound', 'Boy', 'guitar', 'great', 'crowd', 'close', 'very', 'active', 'got', 'like', 'sexy', 'moves', 'girl', 'balcony', 'Midnight', 'Blues', 'outstanding', 'like', 'Texas', 'Strut', 'are', 'great', 'treat', 'when', 'hear', 'Gary', 'version', 'Roy', 'Buchanan', 'Messiah', 'instrumental', 'greatest', 'guitar', 'pop', 'playing', 'will', 'ever', 'hear', 'easily', 'price', 'whole', 'package', 'also', 'like', 'Gary', 'facial', 'looks', 'well', 'captured', 'video', '1999', 'outing', 'like', 'note', 'exchanges', 'Moore', 'keyboard', 'man', 'Further', 'road', 'must', 'admit', 'Gary', 'material', 'not', 'best', 'oh', 'guy', 'can', 'play', 'guitar']",N/A
