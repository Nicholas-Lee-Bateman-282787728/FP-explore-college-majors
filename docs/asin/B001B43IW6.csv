They picture they try to paint has really been very well represented.Initially the story is intriguing and becomes more so as the personal aspects of the Commander's life begin to intertwine with her career, but for me as the series progressed there was just a bit too much of the personal to make it totally credible.If you enjoy police shows, or just good drama that are not exactly mainstream, this could be something you'll enjoy and watch many times, but if you prefer the focus to be case related and the drama in the bedroom to be kept seperate from the drama in the office you might want to consider carefully before making this purchase.In the end, I have to agree with the principle caracter herself, she questions how she can be so stupid as to compromise everything she's spent a lifetime working for, and she asks and is asked that question more than once.",3,Incredible acting under an unlikely scenario,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,1508,"['Amanda', 'Burke', 'role', 'well', 'very', 'adaptable', 'level', 'acting', 'talent', 'shows', 'three', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more.The', 'series', 'focused', 'London', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'mixed', 'group', 'whom', 'controversy', 'corruption', 'are', 'far', 'unknown', 'written', 'present', 'Leveson', 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'heretofore', 'male', 'dominated', 'world', 'how', 'woman', 'could', 'advance', 'did', 'personal', 'character', 'flaws', 'so', 'ably', 'displayed.The', 'crime', 'plots', 'were', 'acceptable', 'overall', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'quality', 'scenes', 'costumes', 'backdrops', 'accurate', 'picture', 'try', 'paint', 'really', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'represented.Initially', 'story', 'intriguing', 'more', 'so', 'personal', 'aspects', 'Commander', 'life', 'begin', 'intertwine', 'career', 'series', 'progressed', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'personal', 'make', 'totally', 'enjoy', 'police', 'shows', 'just', 'good', 'drama', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'mainstream', 'could', 'be', 'something', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'prefer', 'focus', 'be', 'case', 'related', 'drama', 'bedroom', 'be', 'kept', 'seperate', 'drama', 'office', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'carefully', 'before', 'making', 'purchase.In', 'end', 'have', 'agree', 'principle', 'caracter', 'questions', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'stupid', 'compromise', 'everything', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'working', 'asks', 'asked', 'question', 'more', 'once']","THE COMMANDER, SET 1"

Blake has a sexual affair with a murder convict just released that she herself had help get convicted. This affair gets publicized and creates a situation interfering with each the the murder investigations for the rest of the four episode, 570 minutes of top-notch murder mystery.The 4-star rating is due to this UNBELIEVABLE action by the newly appointed Commander Blake. The movie even had the nerve to make this main character a female ""BLOND"".  Would anyone in their right mind, especially the traditional conservative British population, make such a terribly wrong judgment error after a 20-year career of making the right decisions that get you appointed to the top leadership position?Okay, now, getting beyond that initial event, the rest of the series is on-the-edge-of-your-seat, bewildering intrigue, plots braided together holding thrilling mystery, and 5-stars. Each of the 4 episodes (About 2 1/2 hrs each) have a new primary murder to solve.  The MRT actors/actresses remain the same in each, additional cast in introduced related to the complex plots, Blake's affair with Murder Lampton resurfaces, Blake's family situations get involved, and the outcome will not be guessed, until the DVD does the disclosing.There was the police shooting of a suspect, Cripps, that went awry and covered up for 4 episodes. Blake's blunder with the Lampton affair was further aggravated by her entrapment attempt. Will she never learn? The commander's sister gets cancer at the same time someone hacks into a hospital records system and begins murder blackmail. A special deputy, ""Blackdog"", is assigned to look into both the Lampton affair and the Cripps shooting.  Plenty of police cover-up to go all around. And finally, date rape murders begin appearing with the first London victim being, of course, Commander Blake's goddaughter.The DVD box warns about graphic scenes and nudity. Plenty of nasty victim scenes, so beware. There is no captioning so ""Blackdog's"" words are sometimes a bit hard to catch, but the rest is not bad.Summary: worth watching for murder mystery fans, once you accept the dumb-blond syndrome of the Commander's initial ""misjudgment.""",4,THE COMMANDER BASIC SEXUAL AFFAIR AVOIDANCE CLASS 101,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,2391,"['Clare', 'Blake', 'high', 'praise', 'Amanda', 'Burton', 'acting', 'leadership', 'Murder', 'Review', 'Team', 'immediately', 'something', 'assuredly', 'was', 'Commander', 'Manual', 'red', 'lettering', '1', 'DO', 'NOT', 'DO', 'list', 'Blake', 'sexual', 'affair', 'murder', 'convict', 'just', 'released', 'had', 'help', 'get', 'convicted', 'affair', 'publicized', 'situation', 'interfering', 'murder', 'investigations', 'rest', 'four', 'episode', '570', 'minutes', 'top-notch', 'murder', 'mystery.The', '4-star', 'rating', 'due', 'UNBELIEVABLE', 'action', 'newly', 'appointed', 'Commander', 'Blake', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'nerve', 'make', 'main', 'character', 'female', 'BLOND', 'Would', 'anyone', 'right', 'mind', 'especially', 'traditional', 'conservative', 'British', 'population', 'make', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'judgment', 'error', '20-year', 'career', 'making', 'right', 'decisions', 'get', 'appointed', 'top', 'leadership', 'position', 'Okay', 'now', 'getting', 'initial', 'event', 'rest', 'series', 'on-the-edge-of-your-seat', 'bewildering', 'intrigue', 'plots', 'braided', 'together', 'holding', 'thrilling', 'mystery', '5-stars', '4', 'episodes', '2', '1/2', 'hrs', 'have', 'new', 'primary', 'murder', 'solve', 'MRT', 'remain', 'same', 'additional', 'cast', 'introduced', 'related', 'complex', 'plots', 'Blake', 'affair', 'Murder', 'Lampton', 'resurfaces', 'Blake', 'family', 'situations', 'get', 'involved', 'outcome', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'guessed', 'DVD', 'disclosing.There', 'was', 'police', 'shooting', 'suspect', 'Cripps', 'went', 'awry', 'covered', 'up', '4', 'episodes', 'Blake', 'blunder', 'Lampton', 'affair', 'was', 'further', 'aggravated', 'entrapment', 'attempt', 'Will', 'never', 'learn', 'commander', 'sister', 'cancer', 'same', 'time', 'someone', 'hospital', 'records', 'system', 'murder', 'blackmail', 'special', 'deputy', 'Blackdog', 'assigned', 'look', 'Lampton', 'affair', 'Cripps', 'shooting', 'Plenty', 'police', 'cover-up', 'go', 'around', 'finally', 'date', 'rape', 'murders', 'begin', 'appearing', 'first', 'London', 'victim', 'being', 'course', 'Commander', 'Blake', 'goddaughter.The', 'DVD', 'box', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'Plenty', 'nasty', 'victim', 'scenes', 'so', 'beware', 'captioning', 'so', 'Blackdog', 'words', 'are', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'hard', 'catch', 'rest', 'not', 'bad.Summary', 'worth', 'watching', 'murder', 'mystery', 'fans', 'once', 'accept', 'dumb-blond', 'syndrome', 'Commander', 'initial', 'misjudgment']","THE COMMANDER, SET 1"

1170525,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B001B43IW6,Richard B. Schwartz,"[4, 4]","London's Met has officers at the rank of Commander overseeing large case loads in selected areas.  These commanders are aided by retired senior officers who help them work the files and the cases.  (Think ""New Tricks"" but without any smiles or humor.)  The author of the series, Lynda LaPlante, toyed with the idea of focusing on the area of Terrorism but settled instead on the area of Murder.  A Murder Commander would handle approximately 140 cases at a time.  There are few women commanders in the Met--4 at the time that LaPlante began the series.  Her Murder Commander, Clare Blake, is played to a fare-thee-well by Amanda Burton.Clare is smart, bureaucratically-savvy, tough and comfortable in her role.  Unfortunately for her, she is impulsive.  Her principal problem--which looms over the first three episodes (approximately 7 hours of programming)--concerns her affair with a man she once arrested for murder.  He claims to be rehabilitated and an upstanding citizen, but bodies are turning up and he's in everyone's frame but Clare's.  The murderer is played by Hugh Bonneville; yes, the Earl of Grantham himself, flashing some nude backside and exhibiting some deviant behaviors.Within the supporting cast there is a faithful old copper who is in love with Clare, though she capitalizes on his loyalty without reciprocating his love; an ambitious young constable newly promoted to inspector, with whose partner the Commander occasionally sleeps; and, finally, a male DCI (played by Matthew Marsh) with whom Clare continually clashes.  He would love to see her brought down, but when the going gets tough he realizes that they both need one another.  The dynamic between the two of them is superb.Think: Prime Suspect, but with raging hormones, more bureaucratic in-fighting, more human frailty, more bending of the Met's rules (and of the law) but with equally fine writing and equally fine performances.  This is a little less heroic, a little more realistic, but always engaging and entertaining.  The stories are based on real occurrences, the production values very high.
