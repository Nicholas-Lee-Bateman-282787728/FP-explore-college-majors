These stretches are basic but work amazingly well. I think she holds the stretches just the right amount of time and the pace is perfect - not too fast or slow. Good for beginners, athletes, and anyone looking for a good overall stretch that isn't too difficult. The DVD is broken up in five 10 minute stretch routines. You can play all of them for a really great 50 minute stretch workout, or pick only a few for a shorter workout. Number 5 workout, is the most challenging stretch that brings a little bit of yoga into the routine. I do this DVD twice a week in the morning before I start my day, but could be done in the evening right before bed. It's nice and relaxing. I recommend this to people who want a not too difficult, overall body, stretch routine.

1036699,A38ZTUNQJVGP6S,B000KZRP0I,Michael Patrick Boyd,"[7, 7]","Perfect in Ten: Stretch is fifty three minutes and was released on DVD on February 20, 2007. Your instructor for this video is Annette Fletcher and the first three minutes of the video gives you an explanation of the up coming stretches. Unlike Perfect in Ten: Ab where the exercises you are doing are named in the video, Annette does not mention any of the stretching names except when you come to the Intense Stretch segment. The only equipment that is required for this video is a chair for segment three:  Sedentary Lifestyle Relief. All of the stretches are basically easy to do and don't let the Intense Stretch scare you because of the name. In segment five you are doing a bunch of yoga moves like downward dog and bridge pose. The only one main downside to this video is the stretches are not held long enough. So if you are intermediate and above then this may not be the video you are looking for.
