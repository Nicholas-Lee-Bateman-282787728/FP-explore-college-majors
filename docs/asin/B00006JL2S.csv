718448,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,B00006JL2S,Daiho,"[1, 1]","This tale of two middle-aged German brothers learning to let go in a Japanese Zen monastery certainly can't guarantee your own enlightenment, but it will provide a few laughs and may even elicit a moment or two of personal reflection.The humor comes mostly from the sparks given off in the clash of cultures, German/Japanese as well as Christian/Buddhist. Uwe's middle-class world is turned upside down when his wife leaves with the kids. His sympathetic brother Gustav takes him along to his meditation retreat at the Soto Zen monastery at Monzen (a real temple in Ishikawa prefecture). Before getting to the monastery and the more insightful part of the film, the brothers stumble through a number of misadventures in Tokyo.Director Doris D&ouml;rrie appears to have been overwhelmed with the glittery facade of Japan, including tired Asian philosophical cliches about emptiness and no-self. This actually works out fine within context; one might expect her two innocents abroad to be infatutaed by such bromides. Where her sensitivity shines through is in not only having her characters come to understand the significance in these cliches, but also in having them work out a framework into which to fit their Japan experiences, giving their lives a trajectory for resolving inner conflicts.Shot on digital video, the film looks more like a home movie. But unlike more expensive, better looking films that leave you feeling empty, Enlightenment Guaranteed will leave you with a smile and perhaps a new way to look at life.#",4,Enlightening enlightenment,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,1526,"['tale', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'German', 'brothers', 'learning', 'let', 'go', 'Japanese', 'Zen', 'monastery', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'own', 'enlightenment', 'will', 'provide', 'few', 'laughs', 'may', 'even', 'elicit', 'moment', 'two', 'personal', 'reflection.The', 'humor', 'mostly', 'sparks', 'given', 'off', 'clash', 'cultures', 'German/Japanese', 'as', 'well', 'Christian/Buddhist', 'Uwe', 'middle-class', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'wife', 'kids', 'sympathetic', 'brother', 'Gustav', 'along', 'meditation', 'retreat', 'Soto', 'Zen', 'monastery', 'Monzen', 'real', 'temple', 'Ishikawa', 'prefecture', 'getting', 'monastery', 'more', 'insightful', 'part', 'film', 'brothers', 'stumble', 'number', 'misadventures', 'Tokyo.Director', 'Doris', 'D', 'ouml', 'rrie', 'have', 'been', 'overwhelmed', 'glittery', 'facade', 'Japan', 'including', 'tired', 'Asian', 'philosophical', 'cliches', 'emptiness', 'no-self', 'actually', 'out', 'fine', 'context', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'two', 'innocents', 'abroad', 'be', 'infatutaed', 'such', 'bromides', 'Where', 'sensitivity', 'shines', 'not', 'only', 'having', 'characters', 'come', 'understand', 'significance', 'cliches', 'also', 'having', 'work', 'out', 'framework', 'fit', 'Japan', 'experiences', 'giving', 'lives', 'trajectory', 'resolving', 'inner', 'conflicts.Shot', 'digital', 'video', 'film', 'more', 'home', 'movie', 'more', 'expensive', 'better', 'looking', 'films', 'leave', 'feeling', 'empty', 'Enlightenment', 'Guaranteed', 'will', 'leave', 'smile', 'perhaps', 'new', 'way', 'look', 'life.']",N/A

Pawl ""Dani""","[3, 3]","If you have ever had a day, year or (possibly) life where things have not always gone according to plan (I think would include, basically all who walk this Earth), then Enlightenment Guaranteed is a great study for you of human relations, dynamic and finding peace in a (sometimes) chaotic world.  Uwe (Uwe Oschenknecht) is a kitchen space consultant, in a loveless marriage and is also the father of a few kids.  When his wife packs up and leaves him, Uwe is crushed and runs to seek refuge in the home and words of his brother, Gustav (Gustav Pter Wohler), a Zen Master.  Gustav is on his way to a monastery in Japan, and Uwe begs to go with him.  Gustav (grudgingly) says ""yes.""  The two take off an a journey that will bring them closer to their peace, as well as toward each other.Enlightenment Guaranteed is rich with subtlety and warmth.  It is whimsically humorous and quietly insightful.  As the course of their brother's trip begins to seemingly unravel (they get lost, lose their ATM cards, etc), the two must go into ""self reflection"" mode and consult a Zen book to keep them peaceful in a time of great shake up and disturbance for both of them. I do not want to ruin the film by divulging too many more details.  What I will say is that this film is intelligent, quietly insightful and makes the viewers self reflect about their own life and how we react to disturbance or the unexpected in our lives (undoubtedly, a part of life).

As filmcraft, it could really use much tighter editing.HOWEVER it's really not meant to be a ""film"" in the traditional sense...more like a reality-TV-style travel flick, shot on video---none of the lyrical and luscious cinematography of ""Lost In Translation"" which is in all respects a far far superior film.  Plot: two German brothers, one very much interested in Zen and the other one not, go to Japan, get lost for a few days in Tokyo without money or ID or any way of returning to their hotel where their baggage and passports are, and (unfortunately this was only maybe 1/4 of the movie) finally reach their destination: a (Soto) Zen temple.I suppose the 3/4 of the movie which showed them wandering around the sprawling megapolis of Tokyo is on some level meant to be a metaphor for their cultural and spiritual cluelessness and disorientation as Westerners entering the culture and practice of Zen.  But it did get a bit tiresome at points, and there were more than a few total implausibilities.Oh well, nevertheless I mostly enjoyed the movie.  I was usually smiling throughout, no belly-laughs though...am not a big fan of slapstick sitcome type humor and the reality-TV format didn't do much for me.  What really maintained my interest in the movie was just watching street-level modern-day Japan off the beaten track.

718452,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00006JL2S,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[51, 53]","On the surface, this movie appears to be about two brothers who are searching (often in very different ways) for meaning in their lives. One of them decides a trip to a Japanese monastery will further his steps toward enlightenment and peace. The other brother begs to go along because his wife has suddenly abandoned him. He is bereft and at loose ends and hysterical with grief. Against his better impulses, the other brother gives in -and the adventure begins.Once they arrive in Tokyo, the brothers struggle to cope with the difficulties of being in a foreign country and not being able to speak the language They find even the smallest parts of everyday life difficult - getting taxis, ordering food, etc. But they think that they know how to find their way back to their hotel, using two large buildings as landmarks. Unfortunately, at night, the lights of the &quot;landmark&quot; buildings are turned off, which leaves the men disoriented and totally lost. Even worse, they have no money.And that's when they are forced to fall back on their own resources, hitting rock bottom, panicking...and then finding their way up again (I won't go into detail here because the pleasure of this film comes in watching the experiences of the brothers).By the time they get to the monastery, they have come a long way from their old life. Not that life is easy at the monastery but they are ready to change, ready to start the real struggle ahead of them.If I've made this film sound very serious or intellectual, it isn't. There is humor, grace and plenty of surprises in this charming film as well as an exploration of what makes life meaningful - and why. One of those rare films that pushes the viewer to think... and well worth the time spent watching it.",4,Meaning and enlightment where you least expect to find them,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,1755,"['surface', 'movie', 'be', 'about', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'often', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'meaning', 'lives', 'One', 'trip', 'Japanese', 'monastery', 'will', 'further', 'steps', 'enlightenment', 'peace', 'other', 'brother', 'begs', 'go', 'along', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'abandoned', 'bereft', 'loose', 'ends', 'hysterical', 'grief', 'better', 'impulses', 'other', 'brother', '-and', 'adventure', 'begins.Once', 'arrive', 'Tokyo', 'brothers', 'struggle', 'cope', 'difficulties', 'being', 'foreign', 'country', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'language', 'find', 'even', 'smallest', 'parts', 'everyday', 'life', 'difficult', 'getting', 'taxis', 'ordering', 'food', 'etc', 'think', 'know', 'how', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'hotel', 'using', 'two', 'large', 'buildings', 'landmarks', 'Unfortunately', 'night', 'lights', 'quot', 'quot', 'buildings', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'men', 'disoriented', 'totally', 'lost', 'Even', 'worse', 'have', 'money.And', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'fall', 'back', 'own', 'resources', 'hitting', 'rock', 'bottom', 'panicking', 'then', 'finding', 'way', 'up', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'here', 'pleasure', 'film', 'watching', 'experiences', 'brothers', '.By', 'time', 'get', 'monastery', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'old', 'life', 'Not', 'life', 'easy', 'monastery', 'are', 'ready', 'change', 'ready', 'start', 'real', 'struggle', 'ahead', 'them.If', ""'ve"", 'made', 'film', 'sound', 'very', 'serious', 'intellectual', ""n't"", 'humor', 'grace', 'plenty', 'surprises', 'charming', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'exploration', 'what', 'life', 'meaningful', 'why', 'One', 'rare', 'films', 'viewer', 'think', 'well', 'time', 'spent', 'watching']",N/A
