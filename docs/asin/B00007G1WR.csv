And status-conscious car phones have given way to the ubiquitous cell phone or Blue Tooth. But on the whole, unless you are simply too young, you will find the humor still quite relevant.Yes, Carlin says those seven words a lot, but frankly, that's no longer unusual. Enjoy his creativity, his incredible mugging and body language, and have a good time.",4,"Excellent Question, George.",1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,557,"['one', 'HBO', 'specials.The', 'humor', 'one', 'may', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'first', 'think', 'comments', 'Reagan', 'Administration', 'fit', 'Bush', 'administration', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'status-conscious', 'car', 'phones', 'have', 'given', 'way', 'ubiquitous', 'cell', 'phone', 'Blue', 'Tooth', 'whole', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'young', 'will', 'find', 'humor', 'still', 'quite', 'relevant.Yes', 'Carlin', 'seven', 'words', 'lot', 'frankly', 'longer', 'unusual', 'Enjoy', 'creativity', 'incredible', 'mugging', 'body', 'language', 'have', 'good', 'time']",N/A

728149,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00007G1WR,Michael Crane,"[7, 8]","It's always a joy to see comedian George Carlin in action.  Just when you think he cannot come up with anything more outrageous or funny, he surprises us every time.  While I admit that I love his new stuff, I have to say I'm really a bigger fan of his older material.  The man's funny either way, but still I love hearing his older material.  So you can imagine how happy I was to find ""George Carlin: What am I Doing in New Jersey?"" on DVD.I owned the album to this comedy concert for quite some time.  In fact, I think it's one of his albums that I listen to the most.  So it was great to finally see the stuff performed.  As funny as he is on CD, his facial expressions are priceless.  In this special he talks about everything from Ronald Regan to bumper stickers; from toll booths to keeping people in line; from cars and driving to singles bars, and a whole lot more.There was hardly a single minute where I didn't find myself laughing.  You can tell he really loves what he does and the man takes chances.  He's not your typical comedian.  The stuff he did back then was considered very controversial.  Now, he's still a brilliant comedian who never seems to run out of ideas.The DVD is great, being that the picture and sound quality is pretty good for it being so old.  There's no extras available, which is a shame.  I wouldn't mind seeing a documentary or two, or even a recent Carlin interview.  Still, it is a high quality DVD nonetheless.""George Carlin: What am I Doing in New Jersey?"" is a must-have for any Carlin fan.  Don't' even question or think about it.  Just pick it up and enjoy the ride.  I really wished there were more comedians like him, but what can you do?  That's why he stands out so much.  He's a man who can never be duplicated.  This is a great comedy special that had me laughing from start to finish.",5,Carlin in Top Form and Never Disappoints,1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,1838,"['always', 'joy', 'see', 'comedian', 'George', 'Carlin', 'action', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'more', 'outrageous', 'funny', 'time', 'admit', 'love', 'new', 'stuff', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'really', 'bigger', 'fan', 'older', 'material', 'man', 'funny', 'way', 'still', 'love', 'hearing', 'older', 'material', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'happy', 'was', 'find', 'George', 'Carlin', 'What', 'am', 'Doing', 'New', 'Jersey', 'DVD.I', 'owned', 'album', 'comedy', 'concert', 'quite', 'time', 'fact', 'think', 'one', 'albums', 'listen', 'most', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'stuff', 'performed', 'As', 'funny', 'CD', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'priceless', 'special', 'everything', 'Ronald', 'Regan', 'bumper', 'stickers', 'toll', 'booths', 'keeping', 'people', 'line', 'cars', 'driving', 'singles', 'bars', 'whole', 'lot', 'was', 'hardly', 'single', 'minute', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'myself', 'laughing', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'what', 'man', 'chances', 'not', 'typical', 'comedian', 'stuff', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'considered', 'very', 'controversial', 'Now', 'still', 'brilliant', 'comedian', 'who', 'never', 'run', 'out', 'ideas.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'being', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'being', 'so', 'old', 'extras', 'available', 'shame', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'two', 'even', 'recent', 'Carlin', 'interview', 'Still', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD', 'nonetheless', 'George', 'Carlin', 'What', 'am', 'Doing', 'New', 'Jersey', 'must-have', 'Carlin', 'fan', 'Do', ""n't"", ""'"", 'even', 'question', 'think', 'Just', 'pick', 'up', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'really', 'wished', 'were', 'more', 'comedians', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'why', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'duplicated', 'great', 'comedy', 'special', 'had', 'laughing', 'start', 'finish']",N/A
