The irony of it all is that this live concert was one of the best sounding LP's from it's time period. It is a shame that with all of the sales that this recording generated in both LP and CD format it wasn't given a better transfer to dvd. Don't waste your money on this dvd, enjoy the cd or LP.",1,THE AUDIO SUCKS!!!,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,366,"['down', 'worst', 'sounding', 'dvd', 'have', 'ever', 'purchased', 'irony', 'live', 'concert', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'sounding', 'LP', 'time', 'period', 'shame', 'sales', 'recording', 'generated', 'LP', 'CD', 'format', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'better', 'transfer', 'dvd', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'dvd', 'enjoy', 'cd', 'LP']",N/A

Words cannot describe.  Frankie just have raw talent to get you up out of your seat. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes this group of musicians. My favorite performances are Look@California and Feel that Feeling you're feeling. But the best performance is 'Look at Ccalifornia'.  Frankie and Maze really rocked the show with this song. I love this song they really rocked the show with this song.  I watch this dvd and jump out of my seat. The quality is pretty good also, Also, this dvd contains some bonus footage some bonus music videos with some of my other favorites by the group Never Let You Down, We Are One, and Back In Stride. I love this dvd if you like this dvd then I would recommend that you buy Frankie Beverly Live in Los Angeles and also I recommend any MAZE fan to buy this dvd .",5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,915,"['enjoyed', 'concert', 'whole', 'concert', 'Frankie', 'B.', 'Maze', 'truly', 'rocked', 'show', 'Words', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'Frankie', 'just', 'have', 'raw', 'talent', 'get', 'up', 'seat', 'would', 'recommend', 'album', 'anyone', 'who', 'group', 'musicians', 'favorite', 'performances', 'are', 'Look', '@', 'California', 'Feel', 'Feeling', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'best', 'performance', ""'Look"", 'Ccalifornia', 'Frankie', 'Maze', 'really', 'rocked', 'show', 'song', 'love', 'song', 'really', 'rocked', 'show', 'song', 'watch', 'dvd', 'jump', 'seat', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'also', 'Also', 'dvd', 'bonus', 'footage', 'bonus', 'music', 'videos', 'other', 'favorites', 'group', 'Never', 'Let', 'Down', 'Are', 'One', 'Back', 'Stride', 'love', 'dvd', 'like', 'dvd', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'buy', 'Frankie', 'Beverly', 'Live', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'also', 'recommend', 'MAZE', 'fan', 'buy', 'dvd']",N/A

I adjusted my equalizer.  I balanced.  I did it all, but nothing rescued the audio from lowest depths of noise, distortion, and lack of dynamics.  I got over it.The concert was the B - O - M - B!  For one thing, it proved that Frankie is the coolest person to walk the planet Earth.  (Well, okay, Philip Bailey is right there with him.)  I just love his groove.  It was a great performance.  Despite the audio quality, it still had that feeling that the band was in my living room.What can you say about Maze's songlist?  It was awesome!Notice that I rate this DVD higher than both the Isley Brothers and Sade (I did write about those, didn't I)?  They may have a better discography, but they don't perform it better.  This is a great DVD, as long as you're just partying, and not picking on the audio.  It's a ""must buy"" for old-schoolers like me.",4,Poor Audio.
