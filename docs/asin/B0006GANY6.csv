The film is a product of its times, giving the movie a lot of ceremony, but not much substance.  While actor Bradford Dillman musters enough passion at the end and in other, select scenes, he seems like a better fit for a fifties' TV series.  The pomp and circumstance aims for the pre-Vatican II pew, and the subplot, a rivalry between Francis and Bernardo over Claire's love, is an accomodation for a general audience clueless about celibacy.

If you're unfamiliar with the life and accomplishments of this beloved personage and would like to learn a little bit about him the '61 film appropriately titled 'Saint Francis' would be a good place to begin. Bradford Dillman delivers a very Christ-like portrayal of Francis, Dolores Hart is sheer perfection as the gentle Claire and Stuart Whitman adds the necessary fire and emotion to point out the stark contrast between human and divine love.While this film is surpassed by 'Brother Sun, Sister Moon' ('72) in emotionality, artistry, cinematography and soundtrack, this older version is more factual and encompasses the whole of Francis' life instead of ending at his Papal Commision as the Zeffirielli film does.As a Catholic I appreciate the sincerity and intent of this production, while at the same time I must be honest and admit that approached as entertainment there are some problems. The story unfolds slowly and the majority of performances are uncomfortably stiff and the dialogue unrealistic. If not for the presence of the angelic Dolores Hart this film would receive a -3 Star- rating. It is her external and internal beauty that gives this film a whole new level of meaning and spirituality that entices me back for subsequent viewings now and again.Footnote: Dolores Hart left Hollywood in '63 to become a Catholic Nun. Now a member of the Benedictine Order, Mother Dolores resides in the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Connecticut where she lives out the faith and principles that she so beautifully portrayed in this film.",4,"""What Do You Want Me To Do?"" ~ Building Chapels In The Heart",1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,1681,"['were', 'take', 'survey', 'amongst', 'Catholics', 'asking', 'who', 'was', 'favorite', 'Saint', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'going', 'say', 'Francis', 'Assisi', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'life', 'accomplishments', 'beloved', 'personage', 'would', 'like', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', ""'61"", 'film', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'Francis', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'begin', 'Bradford', 'Dillman', 'very', 'Christ-like', 'portrayal', 'Francis', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'gentle', 'Claire', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'necessary', 'fire', 'emotion', 'point', 'out', 'stark', 'contrast', 'human', 'divine', 'love.While', 'film', 'surpassed', ""'Brother"", 'Sun', 'Sister', 'Moon', ""'72"", 'emotionality', 'artistry', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'older', 'version', 'more', 'factual', 'whole', 'Francis', 'life', 'instead', 'ending', 'Papal', 'Commision', 'Zeffirielli', 'film', 'does.As', 'Catholic', 'appreciate', 'sincerity', 'intent', 'production', 'same', 'time', 'must', 'be', 'honest', 'admit', 'approached', 'entertainment', 'are', 'problems', 'story', 'slowly', 'majority', 'performances', 'are', 'uncomfortably', 'stiff', 'dialogue', 'unrealistic', 'not', 'presence', 'angelic', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'film', 'would', 'receive', '-3', 'Star-', 'rating', 'external', 'internal', 'beauty', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'meaning', 'spirituality', 'back', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'now', 'again.Footnote', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'left', 'Hollywood', ""'63"", 'become', 'Catholic', 'Nun', 'Now', 'member', 'Benedictine', 'Order', 'Mother', 'Dolores', 'Abbey', 'Regina', 'Laudis', 'Connecticut', 'where', 'out', 'faith', 'principles', 'so', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'film']",N/A

When I saw this, I thought it was a more recent attempt to tell the story of the saint. I was wrong. It is an older film but it was much more watchable.Francis was a young man of means from the Italian city of Assisi. He went away to war to seek his fortune but received instead a call from God to rebuild the church. At first, he took this as a specific command to rebuild a falling down local church and that he faithfully does, gathering a following of like minded people. In time, though, he realizes that the command was really to rebuild the institution of the church. This proves much more difficult. Francis is fought on all front by those who see him as a threat to their power. Ultimately, he is sabotaged by people within his own order. Even so, he stays faithful to his ideals.Like any film of this period, the historicity has it's problems but it is still a fair film.

Ramos,"[3, 3]","This movie was filmed mainly on location in Assisi with Bradford Dillman in the staring role of Francis of Assisi and Dolores Hart, who would leave a promising film career to become a consecrated member of the Benedictine Order, who played Sister Claire(Clara & Clare are other spellings). Though with none of the modern cinematography of later films this one stands out for its encompassing of the entire life of Saint Francis of Assisi with no added commentary or interpretation on what Saint Francis may have been thinking.Mr. Dillman plays Francis as the pious humble man we have come to learn the Saint was and the now Mother Dolores delivered a marvelous interpretation of the ever loving gentle Saint Claire dedicated to God. Despite the Hollywood influence this movie it still happens to be truly inspirational.The film also shows in the background in unspectacular low budget Hollywood fashion the ugliness of war and though not all historically accurate it is the closes  biography on film I have seen. The film depicts the Saracens that Francis meets as noble and fair-minded but the crusaders as debauched drunkards. While in fact the Saracens, where cruel men who made sure that no Christian would be able to travel in safety or could escape being killed. But they took Francis and his men prisoners, they were beaten and bound and then led before the Sultan. The movie just shows Francis being taken as prisoner and presented to the Sultan.The movie does show the good reception that was given Francis once his faith and devotion was shown, but it fails to show how later the Sultan Malik-al-Kamil generously granted permission to him and to his companions to go anywhere and freely preach wherever they wished in all his empire. And on his death bed the Sultan converted to the Catholic Faith.Within the aforementioned backdrop of the crusades and warfare we are shown the the difference between human and divine love shown by Francis and his friend the crusading knight played by Stuart Whitman. And with all the temptations from the outside world and the betrayal of some from within the order Francis founded he stays true to the calling of God that he answered for the rest of life.

It shows Christian Crusaders butchering Muslims and Muslims that treat St. Francis with great kindness.  It shows St. Francis as a priest, which he wasn't (because of his humility St. Francis refused ordination to the priesthood, remaining a deacon all his life). And this is just some of the blatant errors the movie makes. A poorly made movie not worth owning.",2,Not a well made or accurate movie,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,882,"['are', 'orthodox', 'Catholic', 'Catholic', 'matter', 'not', 'right', 'movie', 'First', 'all', 'are', 'many', 'better', 'classical', 'movies', 'saints', 'there', 'such', 'Reluctant', 'Saint', 'Quo', 'Vadis', 'Marcelino', 'several', 'others', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'general', 'word', 'mind', 'flaky', 'very', 'inaccurate', 'Saint', 'Francis', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'defy', 'Pope', 'rule', 'was', 'not', 'approved', 'completely', 'false', 'humble', 'saint', 'such', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Christian', 'Crusaders', 'butchering', 'Muslims', 'Muslims', 'treat', 'St.', 'Francis', 'great', 'kindness', 'St.', 'Francis', 'priest', 'was', ""n't"", 'humility', 'St.', 'Francis', 'refused', 'ordination', 'priesthood', 'remaining', 'deacon', 'life', 'just', 'blatant', 'errors', 'movie', 'poorly', 'made', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A
866976,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0006GANY6,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","1961's Francis of Assisi is more a coloring book than a movie, a horribly miscast, painfully bland and often extremely badly written trudge through the saint's life that goes out of its way not to offend anyone but simply bores instead. The locations may be Italian but the aesthetic is pure Hollywood, and Hollywood at its least convincing: Francis' and his followers' march to Rome is filmed like something out of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as they hum along to Mario Nascimbene's score and Bradford Dillman charms the birds out of the trees. You almost expect to hear them sing Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off to Rome We Go or ""Zip-adee doo dah, Zipo-adee ay/It's fun to worship in the Franciscan way."". Dillman gives a superficial but inoffensive performance as Francis (inoffensive being the watchword here), often looking like Charlton Heston's undernourished younger brother, Stuart Whitman struggles and loses in almost every scene as Francis' brash aristocratic war-loving friend while Dolores Hart is no more convincing as Clare, which is particularly strange considering that in real life the actress went on to become a nun herself. Cecil Kelloway and Finlay Currie bring some old school professionalism to their small roles, but not enough to give the film much in the way of color, while Pedro Armendariz's casting as the Sultan inadvertently only highlights how weak the material he has to work with really is. Francis' failed mission to the Holy Land and the breakup of his order are covered in passing, but even they fail to bring any drama to the proceedings, while director Michael Curtiz brings nothing to the party, his old panache presumably having run off with Errol Flynn. It's a rare epic that leaves me with little to say in its favor, but this is certainly one.",2,Sincerely poor,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,1790,"['1961', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'more', 'coloring', 'book', 'movie', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'painfully', 'bland', 'often', 'extremely', 'badly', 'written', 'trudge', 'saint', 'life', 'way', 'not', 'offend', 'anyone', 'simply', 'bores', 'instead', 'locations', 'may', 'be', 'Italian', 'aesthetic', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'least', 'convincing', 'Francis', 'followers', 'march', 'Rome', 'filmed', 'something', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'hum', 'along', 'Mario', 'Nascimbene', 'score', 'Bradford', 'Dillman', 'birds', 'trees', 'almost', 'expect', 'hear', 'sing', 'Heigh', 'Ho', 'Heigh', 'Ho', 'Off', 'Rome', 'Go', 'Zip-adee', 'doo', 'dah', 'Zipo-adee', 'ay/It', 'fun', 'worship', 'Franciscan', 'way.', 'Dillman', 'superficial', 'inoffensive', 'performance', 'Francis', 'inoffensive', 'being', 'watchword', 'here', 'often', 'looking', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'undernourished', 'younger', 'brother', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'almost', 'scene', 'Francis', 'brash', 'aristocratic', 'war-loving', 'friend', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'more', 'convincing', 'Clare', 'particularly', 'strange', 'considering', 'real', 'life', 'actress', 'went', 'become', 'nun', 'herself', 'Cecil', 'Kelloway', 'Finlay', 'Currie', 'bring', 'old', 'school', 'professionalism', 'small', 'roles', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'film', 'much', 'way', 'color', 'Pedro', 'Armendariz', 'casting', 'Sultan', 'inadvertently', 'only', 'highlights', 'how', 'weak', 'material', 'work', 'really', 'Francis', 'failed', 'mission', 'Holy', 'Land', 'breakup', 'order', 'are', 'covered', 'passing', 'even', 'fail', 'bring', 'drama', 'proceedings', 'director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'nothing', 'party', 'old', 'panache', 'presumably', 'having', 'run', 'off', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'rare', 'epic', 'little', 'say', 'favor', 'certainly', 'one']",N/A
