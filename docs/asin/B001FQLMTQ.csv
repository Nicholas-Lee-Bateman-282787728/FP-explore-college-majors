Somewhere in this mess, it seems that someone is out to get them while they try to fight their way out of the woods. Unfortunately, this is a movie that has nothing new to show, and repeats old concepts, but not in a good way.  On one hand, the technical aspects of the story are surprisingly good - pretty good camera work, good lighting, and decently high quality cameras.  So from that angle, the movie is at least watchable.  The acting is decent too. However, the problem is the story.  Its a simple concept, but fails on execution, and just doesn't work.  The story evolution doesn't make enough sense for the movie to flow, and the what-should-be climactic scenes (i.e., when the characters find themselves in a traumatic experience), aren't.

1192001,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001FQLMTQ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Dead of Winter definitely doesn't deserve all the criticism it has received thus far.It's about a young boyfriend (and his girlfriend) who are stuck in the woods and basically, it doesn't take long until they BOTH start losing their minds.  Something evil is lurking out in those woods, and whatever it is likes to play mind games with their thoughts and makes them do unrational things.While walking through the woods, both the young man and his girlfriend constantly hear weird, unnatural sounds that make them really nervous, upset and angry.  These sounds get to the point that it drives them crazy and fearful for their lives.These particular scenes create an *amazingly* tense atmosphere.  In fact, they work so well that the atmosphere is the number one reason I'm giving Dead of Winter such a high rating of 4 out of 5.The storyline is pretty good too.  The boyfriend and girlfriend keep accusing each other of things they never really did because the eeriness and strange evil inside the woods is making them go crazy, so they get into fights over, for example, who made certain phone calls, and why they shut the lights out on each other upon entering a home, etc.Of course the other person didn't really DO any of that stuff, but the storyline creates a nice unsettling mystery showing what it's like to see two people go insane.All the boy and girl wanted is to find a way out of those pesky woods.Anyway, the storyline is never really confusing because at least you can understand and explain the events most of the time.However, the ending is pretty terrible if you ask me, and the acting could have been better (especially by the girlfriend).

We won't go THAT far here, although there are moments where the scenery and mood do succeed in creating tension and uncertainty. McNamara obviously draws from Mr. King in that respect, although this movie would compare with more standard King films such as ""Riding the Bullet."" It is better than most of the Masters of Horror series, though, and if it were not for the banal dialogue and absurd one-liners throughout, the acting by the two lead characters would have put this over the top. But the problem is that while it IS atmospheric and it IS chilling at times, everyone watching it knows what is going on, and the ""twist"" at the end really is not all that shocking. There is very little blood/gore, very few moments where you will jump or be startled, and the suspensful moments are just too few and far between to make this movie anything more than average.McNamara deserves points for trying, however, and he does connect on certain thematic elements. In addition, the two young leads in the film deliver performances that should not be overlooked.

1192003,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001FQLMTQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","Dead of Winter (aka Lost Call) has all the makings of a good, intense movie - but it never truly delivers.  Throwing a big surprise in at the last moment doesn't help.  You can't make up for a weak story by delivering a surprise questionable ending - when is Hollywood going to figure that out?  I know this film is supposedly based on a true story, but I've read about that true story; Dead of Winter may be built upon the same structure of that event, but this is really just an attempt to exploit a tragedy in a failed effort to add a little extra tension to a film that struggles to stand on its own two legs. I don't want to speak too harshly of the film, though, because I have to admit it did a good job of keeping me entertained.If these two young people had only had their drinks unknowingly laced with LSD, I would really have cared what happened to them after they found themselves lost in the cold, snowy woods.  The fact that they also both willingly snorted crystal meth at their friend's New Year's party, though, kept me from establishing a true bond with them and their plight.  I didn't want anything bad to happen to the cute girl, Tiffany (Sandra McCoy), but I have to admit I didn't like Kevin (Al Santos) at all.  When you think some awful something is attacking you, you don't just run off and leave your girl behind - unless you're Kevin, who did it repeatedly.So Kevin and Tiffany leave this party in something of a huff and head home on the snowy roads.  Hearing and seeing frightening things, they abandon the car and run off into the woods in a panic.  Afraid to head back to the car, they decide to trek the rest of the way home through the woods.  Naturally, they get lost.  They do call 911, but the signal never lasts very long, and the dispatcher has a hard time figuring out where they are because of the crazy things they say - they're lost at their apartment, there are a bunch of ""workers"" there who don't speak English, etc.  Things go from bad to worst out in the woods as Kevin's behavior becomes stranger and stranger.In light of the ending, I feel that some of the overall story elements are rather flimsily connected to one another, and a number of obvious yet unanswered questions arise as to the whole situation this couple found themselves in.  The film does muster up a couple of creepy moments, one of which features a beautifully subtle and perfectly executed shot that you may not notice if you aren't paying attention at the time, but the story just isn't strong enough to carry this film all the way through.  The end result is an average horror/thriller that will entertain you but probably won't exceed your expectations.",3,Doesn't exactly chill you to the bones,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,2675,"['Dead', 'Winter', 'aka', 'Lost', 'Call', 'makings', 'good', 'intense', 'movie', 'never', 'truly', 'delivers', 'Throwing', 'big', 'surprise', 'last', 'moment', ""n't"", 'help', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'weak', 'story', 'delivering', 'surprise', 'questionable', 'ending', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'going', 'figure', 'know', 'film', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', ""'ve"", 'read', 'true', 'story', 'Dead', 'Winter', 'may', 'be', 'built', 'same', 'structure', 'event', 'really', 'just', 'attempt', 'exploit', 'tragedy', 'failed', 'effort', 'add', 'little', 'extra', 'tension', 'film', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'legs', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'speak', 'too', 'harshly', 'film', 'though', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'had', 'only', 'had', 'drinks', 'unknowingly', 'laced', 'LSD', 'would', 'really', 'have', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'found', 'lost', 'cold', 'snowy', 'woods', 'fact', 'also', 'willingly', 'snorted', 'crystal', 'meth', 'friend', 'New', 'Year', 'party', 'kept', 'establishing', 'true', 'bond', 'plight', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'bad', 'happen', 'cute', 'girl', 'Tiffany', 'Sandra', 'McCoy', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kevin', 'Al', 'Santos', 'When', 'think', 'awful', 'something', 'attacking', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'run', 'off', 'leave', 'girl', ""'re"", 'Kevin', 'who', 'did', 'repeatedly.So', 'Kevin', 'Tiffany', 'leave', 'party', 'something', 'huff', 'head', 'home', 'snowy', 'roads', 'Hearing', 'seeing', 'frightening', 'things', 'abandon', 'car', 'run', 'off', 'woods', 'panic', 'Afraid', 'head', 'back', 'car', 'decide', 'trek', 'rest', 'way', 'home', 'woods', 'Naturally', 'get', 'lost', 'do', 'call', '911', 'signal', 'never', 'very', 'long', 'dispatcher', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'crazy', 'things', 'say', ""'re"", 'lost', 'apartment', 'are', 'bunch', 'workers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'etc', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worst', 'out', 'woods', 'Kevin', 'behavior', 'stranger', 'stranger.In', 'light', 'ending', 'feel', 'overall', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'rather', 'flimsily', 'connected', 'one', 'number', 'obvious', 'yet', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'arise', 'whole', 'situation', 'couple', 'found', 'film', 'muster', 'up', 'couple', 'creepy', 'moments', 'one', 'beautifully', 'subtle', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'shot', 'may', 'not', 'notice', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'time', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'way', 'end', 'result', 'average', 'horror/thriller', 'will', 'entertain', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exceed', 'expectations']",Dead Of Winter

To date, this rather silly psychological horror flick is McNamara's only feature-length directorial effort. There's a reason for that.Plot: after leaving a New Year's Eve party where their drinks were spiked with LSD by the sadistic host, Kevin (&lt;em>American Gangster&lt;/em>'s Al Santos) and Tiffany (&lt;em>Cry_Wolf&lt;/em>'s Sandra McCoy) have an accident on their way home, panic, and run off into the woods, their only lifeline being a spotty cell phone they use every once in a while to check in with the local sheriff (played by McNamara) and his dispatcher (&lt;em>Bubba Ho-Tep&lt;/em>'s Ella Joyce). Kevin eventually becomes convinced that they are being stalked, and the two of them flee deeper into the woods even as the sheriff does his best to get a manhunt going in the sub-zero weather.I wanted to like this movie. I've been a big Ella Joyce fan ever since the &lt;em>Roc&lt;/em> days (and that's two decades ago now), and there are a number of places where there's a hook out there, dangling, waiting for McNamara and/or screenwriters Robert Egan and Graham Silver, two producers working on their first script, to pick it up and run with it. They never do, preferring a script that stands solely in service to the plot--which is thin. As such, you end up with a dead generic pseudo-psychological thriller often (and never favorably) compared to &lt;em>The Shining&lt;/em>. **",2,Probably should have been allowed to die of frostbite.,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1840,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Dead', 'Winter', 'lt', '>', 'Brian', 'McNamara', '2007', 'Somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'movie', 'also', 'released', 'lt', '>', 'Lost', 'Signal', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'popped', 'up', 'channel', 'other', 'lt', '>', 'Brian', 'McNamara', 'Dead', 'Winter', 'lt', '>', 'was', 'directed', 'Brian', 'McNamara', 'TV', 'character', 'actor', 'currently', 'appearing', 'lt', '>', 'Army', 'Wives', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'who', 'had', 'guest', 'spot', 'point', 'probably', 'shows', 'watch', 'TV', 'date', 'rather', 'silly', 'psychological', 'horror', 'flick', 'McNamara', 'only', 'feature-length', 'directorial', 'effort', 'reason', 'that.Plot', 'leaving', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'where', 'drinks', 'were', 'spiked', 'LSD', 'sadistic', 'host', 'Kevin', 'lt', '>', 'American', 'Gangster', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Al', 'Santos', 'Tiffany', 'lt', '>', 'Cry_Wolf', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Sandra', 'McCoy', 'have', 'accident', 'way', 'home', 'panic', 'run', 'off', 'woods', 'only', 'lifeline', 'being', 'spotty', 'cell', 'phone', 'use', 'once', 'while', 'check', 'local', 'sheriff', 'played', 'McNamara', 'dispatcher', 'lt', '>', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Ella', 'Joyce', 'Kevin', 'eventually', 'convinced', 'are', 'being', 'stalked', 'two', 'flee', 'deeper', 'woods', 'even', 'sheriff', 'best', 'get', 'manhunt', 'going', 'sub-zero', 'weather.I', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'Ella', 'Joyce', 'fan', 'ever', 'lt', '>', 'Roc', 'lt', '>', 'days', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'now', 'are', 'number', 'places', 'where', 'hook', 'there', 'dangling', 'waiting', 'McNamara', 'and/or', 'screenwriters', 'Robert', 'Egan', 'Graham', 'Silver', 'two', 'producers', 'working', 'first', 'script', 'pick', 'up', 'run', 'never', 'do', 'preferring', 'script', 'solely', 'service', 'plot', 'thin', 'such', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'generic', 'pseudo-psychological', 'thriller', 'often', 'never', 'favorably', 'compared', 'lt', '>', 'Shining', 'lt', '>', '**']",Dead Of Winter

But there's another, better film out there with the same title, ""Dead of Winter."" (Producers seem to be recycling titles with increasing rapidity.) This somewhat older film, starring Mary Steenburgen and Roddy McDowall, is much slicker, more clever - and more frightening. So if you just have time for one chilling snow job - make it the Steenburgen/McDowall film.",3,A New Take on the Slasher in the Woods,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,831,"['might', 'think', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'possible', 'permutation', 'mad', 'slasher', 'stalking', 'young', 'couple', 'woods', 'However', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'put', 'new', 'twist', 'theme.The', 'couple', 'floundering', 'woods', 'little', 'repetitious', 'might', 'think', 'are', 'guessing', 'secret', 'dilemma', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'whole', 'truth', 'matter', 'very', 'last', 'frame.So', 'film', 'marginally', 'worth', 'sticking', 'better', 'film', 'there', 'same', 'title', 'Dead', 'Winter', 'Producers', 'seem', 'be', 'recycling', 'titles', 'increasing', 'rapidity', 'somewhat', 'older', 'film', 'starring', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'much', 'slicker', 'more', 'clever', 'more', 'frightening', 'So', 'just', 'have', 'time', 'one', 'chilling', 'snow', 'job', 'make', 'Steenburgen/McDowall', 'film']",Dead Of Winter

Opening a film with ""scary"" can be risky, but the execution of every detail of this movie was great. There were unexpected twists and thrills and excellent camera work to bring viewers into the eyes of the characters. Don't look here for gore, but this is surely a horror movie.

The whole movie is about 2 kids tripping on LSD, big deal!! They think someone is after them, paranoid running through the wintry woods. This film is purely a no brainer. Waste of time & especially money. I do admit the acting was great, the director did a good job filming & everything else about the film was fantastic quality but the story is empty & just plain boring.

This video is just terrible. SPOILER ALERT... if you heard that series of phone calls a few years ago between the two teens who were high on meth in a snowstorm, then called 911 and reported that they were surrounded by minorities who wouldn't answer them (along with other hallucinations), then froze to death unable to find shelter, then you have already heard this ENTIRE plot. I kid you not, this movie is nothing but a ripoff and dramatization of those phone calls. Obviously, if you have heard the calls, then, you know that the two kids are seeing things that aren t there, and can't hurt them. Just hallucinations. How anyone could rate this above a 1 or 2 is beyond me. I respect other's opinions most of the time, but not THIS time. Skip this video and save your money, otherwise you are either going to be disappointed or furious that the filmmakers simply stole that lame storyline from those phone calls (you can hear those calls, by the way, on YouTube - the actual calls are 100x more frightening than this awful excuse for a movie). How this got financed and filmed and found a distributor, I will never know. The investors must be wishing that the film producers were themselves frozen to death from hypothermia. The filmmakers (and I use that term very, very lightly here) owe me 45 minutes of my time (all I could bear watching of this disaster of a movie) and the $2.99 I wasted renting this unoriginal hunk of garbage.",1,Save your money...,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,1539,"[""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'video', 'take', 'up', 'more', 'time', 'already', 'video', 'just', 'terrible', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'heard', 'series', 'phone', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'two', 'teens', 'who', 'were', 'high', 'meth', 'snowstorm', 'then', 'called', '911', 'reported', 'were', 'surrounded', 'minorities', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'answer', 'other', 'hallucinations', 'then', 'death', 'unable', 'find', 'shelter', 'then', 'have', 'already', 'heard', 'ENTIRE', 'plot', 'kid', 'not', 'movie', 'nothing', 'ripoff', 'dramatization', 'phone', 'Obviously', 'have', 'heard', 'calls', 'then', 'know', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'seeing', 'things', 'aren', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Just', 'hallucinations', 'How', 'anyone', 'could', 'rate', '1', '2', 'respect', 'other', 'opinions', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'THIS', 'time', 'Skip', 'video', 'save', 'money', 'otherwise', 'are', 'either', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'furious', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'stole', 'lame', 'storyline', 'phone', 'calls', 'can', 'hear', 'calls', 'way', 'YouTube', 'actual', 'calls', 'are', '100x', 'more', 'frightening', 'awful', 'excuse', 'movie', 'How', 'got', 'financed', 'filmed', 'found', 'distributor', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'investors', 'must', 'be', 'wishing', 'film', 'producers', 'were', 'frozen', 'death', 'hypothermia', 'filmmakers', 'use', 'term', 'very', 'very', 'lightly', 'here', 'owe', '45', 'minutes', 'time', 'could', 'bear', 'watching', 'disaster', 'movie', '2.99', 'wasted', 'renting', 'unoriginal', 'hunk', 'garbage']",Dead Of Winter
