Although Bill Murray's childish neurosis is sometimes annoying, the movie is 'made' by Murray's and Dreyfus' clashing eccentric personalities..(Do I get my Doctorate yet?). Dr. Leo Marvin is the successful phychiatrist who recently publishes his own book and relishes in it's success and 'Good Morning America's interest. Own his way out to vacation, he is handed the case of an obsessive loon (Bill Murray) who refuses to let Dr. Marvin's vacation convince him that their sessions are on hold. Its hilarious watching Dreyfus' patience slowely wear thin as Murray delights his family and 'Good Morning America', and consequently ruins Leo's career and sanity. Think of the old cartoons when Elmer Fudd uses everything from little round bombs to guns in order to get rid of that old rabbit, but instead everything winds up backfiring. That is the comic feel of this well-acted great movie that if you ask me, was so good because of Richard Dreyfus' performance. I particularly like the big bomb scene when Leo decides to resort to 'Death Therapy', exciting his pestering patient with thoughts of a cure..oh Lord, this had to be one of the funniest movies ever.

Also Richard Dreyfuss plays an erotic psychiatrist to the hilt which just adds to the movie. If you ever wondered what you do with that annoying person that does not leave you alone watch what about Bob? Not only will you be wondering what's going to happen in the next five minutes you'll wonder what happens to these characters after the movie. Does Bob get better or does he get worse? Does the Richard Dreyfuss character really go insane? The truth of the matter is that you will always go always wonder why they didn't put out what about Bob 2. I know I wish they put out a sequel to the movie but maybe this is a movie that doesn't need a sequel. But I believe it is a movie that you will enjoy if you enjoy Bill Murray's humor and his acting. It's almost a perfect movie I would give it nine out of 10. The only problem is is that it does drag on in certain areas of the movie but overall it is fun to watch.

300885,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630220366X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Okay, here's the deal.  `What about Bob?' is funny, but it's not the uproarious comedy that I remember from my youth.  Yes, `What about Bob?' doesn't age as well as I would have liked it to.  A lot of the jokes hit, but the overall feel of the film is no where near as fresh as I remember.  I think I'm growing tired of comedies that push the boundaries of common sense.  Why can't all comedies be smart?  I mean, to have everyone around Bob be completely oblivious to his overwhelming annoyance except his doctor is just kind of pushing it for me.  I mean, couldn't they have made Bob a pest to `everyone'?  It would have still been funny and it would have also been believable.Anyways.`What about Bob?' tells us the story of mentally disturbed Bob Wiley who becomes obsessed with his new therapist Dr. Leo Marvin; so much so that he tracks him down while he is away on vacation and imposes on him and his family, spending every waking (and some non-waking) moment with him.  Leo seems to be going crazy since no one else seems to notice how incredibly intrusive Bob is being and soon Leo's entire family is making him out to be the bad guy.Bill Murray is extremely effective as Bob.  He is annoying, even to the viewer.  It was a perfect role for him.  I tend to prefer my Richard Dreyfuss serious (take `Mr. Holland's Opus' for instance) but his comedic timing here is fine (although his beard really got on my nerves for some reason).  Julie Hagerty is dreadfully annoying (maybe even more so than Bob) as Fay, Leo's wife.  Charlie Korsmo (from `Hook') and Kathryn Erbe (from `Law and Order: C.I.') are believable and effective as the two Marvin children Sigmund and Anna.This movie is all about Bob though, and Bill Murray carries it steady on his shoulders.  Without Murray this film would have fallen flat, but he never allows it to.  Even when its ridiculousness has reached new lows of improbability it still manages to be entertaining because Murray is so committed.I will not say that this is a bad film (my four star rating should squash anyone thinking that) but I can't say that it is a great one.  Sure, it's pure family fun, and that is always a plus, but sometimes I want a little substance, and `What about Bob?' really has none.  It's one gag after another without any weight to it.  In the end `What about Bob?' is your generic family slap-stick comedy that works better than most because the jokes actually land.

He has what is called Tourette's Syndrome which is when a person exclaims angrily or frustratedly. He has a phobia of touching things previously handled by other people with bare hands so he uses handkerchiefs,gloves,napkins or paper towels. Wiley's psychiatrist quits his paractice and Wiley is referred to another psychiatrist,Leo Marvin(Richard Dreyfuss). Dr. Marvin wrote a book called Baby Steps and gives a copy to Wiley when visiting Dr. Marvin. &quot;That should give you a lot to digest while I'm on vacation.&quot; says Marvin. After Dr. Marvin,his wife Faye(Julie Hagerty),and their two kids retreat to their vacation home in Lake Winnipesaukee,Wiley shows up at the retreat,shockingly surprising Leo. Leo was told that Wiley committed suicide,but Wiley's arrival proved that untrue. Wiley endears himself to Faye and the Marvins' children Sigmund(or Siggy) and Anna. Leo was scheduled to make an appearance on TV's Good Morning America. Joan Lunden has a cameo. Wiley and Leo were not supposed to meet again until after Labor Day when Leo resumes his practice. Leo increasingly becomes upset with Wiley that Leo kicks Wiley out of the house(Wiley was sworn in as a house guest at the suggestion of Faye). Wiley appeared with Leo on GMA. Leo was raving about the success of his book. He was asked how Baby Steps made a sudden,wonderful impact on Bob. Bob quipps,&quot;Mashed potatoes and gravy&quot;. Leo's family commended Leo on a wonderful job he did. This is where Leo kicks Bob out. Leo said Bob was a disaster. Leo drives Bob to a mental hospital managed by a friend of his. Bob is sworn in as a patient and then telling the other patients jokes and making them laugh. Bob is discharged and is driven back to the Marvins' house. Leo returns home to a surprise birthday party,one of the guests being his sister Lili from Chicago. When Leo spots Bob,Leo jumps on Bob and the two roll around and wrestle. Bob then undergoes a &quot;death therapy&quot; session. That was Leo ties Bob up,surrounded by loose gunpowder. Leo promises to take care of Gil,Bob's pet fish.&quot;I'll feed him 'til he's big and fat! Then I'll eat him!&quot;.Bob wonderfully beat the explosion untying himself before the &quot;kaboom&quot;,but,some of the gunpowder ended up in the Marvins' house,destroying it upon the explosion. Leo is in a mental hospital,the same one he committed Bob to in an earlier scene,in a wheelchair! He is hardly attentive even at the wedding in the last scene. Bob and Lili become husband and wife making Bob and Leo brothers-in-law. When the reverend asked if there was any reason why this couple should not be united in holy matrimony,Leo emerged from his &quot;coma&quot;,dressed in pajamas and robe and still in the wheelchair.

Groundhog Day is definitely my favorite movie he EVER starred in, however.  My memories are the strongest the first time I ever watched Groundhog Day.  However, this is about What About Bob?  My first impression years ago when watching it for the first time were that it's a pretty good movie but nothing truly spectacular.  However watching it again tonight with a greater appreciation for older films, I realize just how hilarious it is.Bill Murray's character repeatedly irritates and interrupts his therapist during a family vacation in New Hampshire.  Why, you ask?  Because Bill is mentally ill and needs help and someone to talk with at ALL times.  The first subtle signs that he wasn't normal can be found in the beginning when the one therapist calls the other on the phone and looks completely shaken up and relieved when he gets word that the other therapist will take care of Bill Murray's character for now on.  It's a weird reaction but once we actually discover WHY the one therapist is acting that way, it all makes total sense!The way the events unfold is quite hysterical.  The therapist is played by Richard Dreyfuss and his facial expressions and the way Bill Murray continues to find unintentional ways to humiliate him while Richard's family stands up and continues to support Bill Murray's actions is absolutely priceless.  It's honestly THIS movie that shows us that Bill Murray is a legendary comedian.  It's just a constant build-up and an eventual explosion (literally) for Richard Dreyfuss.  How much can one man take!  Honestly I was starting to feel sorry for the guy after a while, haha.

Maybe I was on a bad date at the time,  or maybe I got some bad popcorn at the concession stand. That being said, I  decided to go back and see it again to try and figure out why all of my  friends liked it so much. For some reason the second time was the charm.  Bill Murray proves again why he is one of the great comedy actors of our  generation, as he portrays Bob, and petrified, neurotic that has a tendency  to fixate on his therapist and consequently drive them insane. Enter Dr.  Leo Marvin (Richard Dryfus). He takes Bob on as a new patient at the  request of a colleague wanting desperately to rid himself of Bob and his  entanglements. Dr. Marvin dazzles Bob in their first session together, and  Bob seems to have found his savior but can't handle the fact that Dr.  Marvin is going to take a vacation and leave Bob all alone. Through a very  funny sequence or events Bob tracks Dr. Marvin and his family down at their  summer vacation home, and the hilarity soon begins.Murray is perfect as  the likeable Bob that everyone loves with the exception of Dr. Marvin.  Dryfus is equally good as the pompous therapist with a new &quot;self  help&quot; best seller under his belt. As the movie wears on Bob becomes  more and more likeable and Dr. Marvin gets more and more irritating, but  there are great moments throughout.

The structure is a fairly traditional one:  comic playing off a straight man, topically updated with psychotherapy, family tensions, and modern celebrityhood.  The huge success in this case comes from the manic pace and the brilliant teamwork of Murray/Dreyfuss.  Bill Murray is the problem patient fobbed off on the egotistical doctor, Richard Dreyfuss, who is ultimately seen to be the more pathetic and needful of the two.  As wonderful as Murray is, the film rises to the top because of the contribution of Richard Dreyfuss.  Like all great comedy, there is a wonderful lode of humor to be mined out of Dreyfuss' pain.

What is common in these two movies, is for sure, the great locations both of them are filmed, as well as the chemistry between the protagonists. Also the soundrtract of this two movies is very similar.During the movie is amazing how your compassion shifts from Bill Murray to Richard Dreyfuss and vice versa. At the end of course Richard Dreifuss is to be pitied. Admitedly in the beginning what takes place in New York can make you think is a so and so comedy but when the action moves at the country house of the octor then the movie becomes a masterpiece.A very entertaining movie with great laughs where my favorite moments are when everybody recognizes Bill Murray from his appearence to Good Morning America whereas Richard Dreyfuss who sit just next to him passes completly unnoticed.I am sure that this is by far the best movie of Bill Murray (not of Frank Oz though I believe Dirty rotten scoundrels are much better with better comic climaxes is ALL the scenes).

When someone explained the premise to me, I thought there was a potential to be good, with way too much room to go bad instead.  I like Bill Murray to an extent.  He has done some great flicks, like Caddyshack and Groundhog's Day.  But he can go overboard sometimes like he did in Stripes.  Richard Dreyfuss is a great actor, and I have not seen much from him that didn't impress me.  But this plot of a psychiatrist (Dreyfuss) going on a vacation and having his new neurotic patient (Murray) follow him...the shrink is scared, angry and trying to get rid of the nut...but everyone including the shrink's family just loves the nut case...this is a premise that could have easily tanked and should have easily just nose-dived into stupidity and worthlessness.  BUT I GOTTA GIVE THESE GUYS CREDIT!!!  Somehow, they made it work!!!  The cast blend so easily and well together.  Dreyfuss and Murray both give spectacular performances and really work off each other very well!  They script is exceptional, given the plot they had to work with.  They made it funny, without being awkward or stupid.  They actually pulled off this incredibly inplausable idea...and made it plausable!!!  (at least by comedy standards)  At least during the 90 minutes or so that you're watching this movie, you can be drawn into believing this neurotic mess and lovable guy Murray is winning the affections of everyone around him, even as the refined shrink Dreyfuss is slowly driven mad to the point of contemplating murder!  The adept and brilliant comedic script and strong, wonderful acting by the entire cast make this a delightfully funny and fun viewing experience.  I'll admit that when people first recommended this to me, I was skeptical.  I didn't think this movie would work.  But I'm not a skeptic anymore.

Bob Wiley (Bill Murray) is a loveable kind of guy with some serious emotional issues. He latches on to his new therapist Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) with an intensity that would freak anyone out. Along the way, Bob is getts into everyone's heart except for Dr. Leo. Somehow Bob seems to think he is getting better because of Dr. Leo and his ""baby steps"" method of therapy.Here is classic Bill Murray at his wackiest. Bob Wiley is a compilation of just about any character Murray played in the early days of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. Murray's characters were always one dimensional, wacky and annoying so Bob Wiley can be added to the list. Of course, as Murray matured so did his roles but WHAT ABOUT BOB? is pure classic Murray but with a difference. There is a sweetness and innocence to Bob Wiley that is not often not seen in early Murray characters. Bob is also different in that he is very well aware of his problems and he WANTS to get better. Unfortunately, it's Dr. Leo who suffers through the ordeal that is Bob.Bob clearly oversteps all boundaries with his therapist and is a stalker. Dr. Leo's family loves Bob, and there is no surprise that Bob's influence cause the family to bond and grow--again, at the expense of Dr. Leo's sanity.Dreyfuss shines as Dr. Leo Marvin. He seems to be at his peak--slim and young and even good looking. There is a great chemistry between Murray and Dreyfuss and a pleasant country location adds to the charm of this film.It would have been a better film if Bob had been less of a stalker and simply just over enthusiastic.

Woods ""silvannus""","[3, 5]","The premise of this comedy may be put quite simply: a therapist  miraculously cures a patient with a multiphobic personality at the expense of his own sanity. Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) is a sucessful  therapist with book coming out. He is also an charlatan, an egotistical  jerk with a beautiful family. Bob is referred to him by a none too friendly  colleague because he is &quot;human crazy glue.&quot; They have their  intake interview at the end of which Leo tells Bob he is taking his family  on vacation until Labor Day. Bob freaks. That's a whole month. As one would  expect Bob is unable to stay away from the good Doctor and soon with his  faithful Goldfish, Gill (Gill), Bob is on a bus to New Hampshire to destroy  the Doctor's vacation. Four different payoffs are set up for the explosive  ending:a) The Gutmans, who run a local coffee shop, have had their dream  house bought out from under them by Dr. Marvin. Their revenge begins when  they make sure that Bob can find the doctor's house.b) Leo's family  loves Bob to an extent that Leo gets jealous, thinking Bob is alienating  affections he doesn't actually deserve. He is angry at Bob for &quot;being  crazy enough to be fun.&quot;c) Good Morning America is coming to  interview Dr. Marvin at his summer home. Since he is not an authentic  person, Leo is very concerned about his image. Bob is a major-league fly in  the oatmeal.d) Leo's birthday is the same day as the Good Morning  America interview. A huge surprise party is planned. This is the beginning  of the end.While the movie is marvelously well written, what does the  trick is watching Bob becomes saner and saner due to being out of NYC, and  his loving connection to the Marvins (with exception of Leo). In this Bill  Murray's comedic genius is manifest. But the real work horse of this movie,  the man who makes everything work is Richard Dreyfuss as a man who is  inauthentic in everything but his rage. The difference is that Murray is  playing for laughs and Dreyfuss isn't, but Dreyfuss gets more laughs.",5,Comedic Reversal,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2050,"['premise', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'quite', 'simply', 'therapist', 'miraculously', 'patient', 'multiphobic', 'personality', 'expense', 'own', 'sanity', 'Dr.', 'Leo', 'Marvin', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'sucessful', 'therapist', 'book', 'coming', 'out', 'also', 'charlatan', 'egotistical', 'jerk', 'beautiful', 'family', 'Bob', 'referred', 'none', 'too', 'friendly', 'colleague', 'quot', 'human', 'crazy', 'glue.', 'quot', 'have', 'intake', 'interview', 'end', 'Leo', 'Bob', 'taking', 'family', 'vacation', 'Labor', 'Day', 'Bob', 'freaks', 'whole', 'month', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Bob', 'unable', 'stay', 'away', 'good', 'Doctor', 'soon', 'faithful', 'Goldfish', 'Gill', 'Gill', 'Bob', 'bus', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'destroy', 'Doctor', 'vacation', 'Four', 'different', 'payoffs', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'explosive', 'ending', 'Gutmans', 'who', 'run', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'have', 'had', 'dream', 'house', 'bought', 'out', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'revenge', 'when', 'make', 'sure', 'Bob', 'can', 'find', 'doctor', 'house.b', 'Leo', 'family', 'Bob', 'extent', 'Leo', 'jealous', 'thinking', 'Bob', 'alienating', 'affections', ""n't"", 'actually', 'deserve', 'angry', 'Bob', 'quot', 'being', 'crazy', 'enough', 'be', 'fun.', 'quot', 'c', 'Good', 'Morning', 'America', 'coming', 'interview', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'summer', 'home', 'not', 'authentic', 'person', 'Leo', 'very', 'concerned', 'image', 'Bob', 'major-league', 'fly', 'oatmeal.d', 'Leo', 'birthday', 'same', 'day', 'Good', 'Morning', 'America', 'interview', 'huge', 'surprise', 'party', 'planned', 'beginning', 'end.While', 'movie', 'marvelously', 'well', 'written', 'what', 'trick', 'watching', 'Bob', 'saner', 'saner', 'due', 'being', 'NYC', 'loving', 'connection', 'Marvins', 'exception', 'Leo', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'comedic', 'genius', 'manifest', 'real', 'work', 'horse', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'work', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'man', 'who', 'inauthentic', 'everything', 'rage', 'difference', 'Murray', 'playing', 'laughs', 'Dreyfuss', ""n't"", 'Dreyfuss', 'more', 'laughs']",N/A

It has to be one of Bill Murray's very best (in a career that spanned the last 30 years that's no small accomplishment.) Another great movie with Bill Murray is the lesser-knownQuick Change.Bill Murray plays Bob Wiley (I love that name, isn't that just the perfect name for a lunatic?), a man with a lot of psychological problems and phobias. When he meets his latest shrink, Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) all h-e-l-l breaks loose!Where Bob is totally silly and screw-ballish, Dr. Marvin is the total opposite. I couldn't stop laughing when Dr. Marvin got the call in the middle of the night informing him that Bob committed suicide; he just clapped his hands (he must have a ""clapper"") to turn off the light and rolls over to go back to sleep!But Bob didn't kill himself. No, this man wants to live! He made up some cockamamie story so he could track down Dr. Marvin at his vacation residence. It's so funny (and crazy) the way Bob can clean up his act and pretend to be sane when he wants to find Dr. Marvin. Remember how he dressed up like that cop and went to Dr. Marvin's exchange?Fortunately, (for Bob) he meets Mr. and Mrs. Gutman (Tom Aldredge and Susan Willis) who are only too glad to drop Bob off at Dr. Marvin's home. To say that this couple hates Dr. Marvin with a passion would be an understatement. Every time Mrs. Gutman sees him or hears his name she says in her thick German accent, ""son of a vitch,"" immediately followed up by her husband saying, ""she never says that.""Once Bob starts getting acclimated in his new surroundings, Dr. Marvin's family starts to take to him. Because, as Dr. Marvin's daughter Anna (Kathryn Erbe) yells to her dad: BOB IS FUN! Bob also gets Siggy (Charlie Korsmo,) Dr. Marvin's depressed son to come out of his shell. He even gets him to dive into the lake; something Dr. Marvin was only able to do after he comically-accidentally dropped him in during a swimming lesson.One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Bob came to Dr. Marvin's for dinner. Right when Bob is supposed to leave there is a horrible rain storm. Fay (Julie Hagerty,) Dr. Marvin's sweet wife insists that Bob stay the night. But Dr. Marvin was not having it. Besides despising the idea of taking second fiddle, he didn't want Bob to be anywhere near his home the following morning because he was to be interviewed by Good Morning America. So, they stay up and wait for the rain to stop. It never stops. So, Bob stays the night.Soon, it is apparent to Dr. Marvin that Bob isn't going to leave (both his home and his life.) And, Dr. Marvin also realizes that Bob isn't the odd man out. It's him! Dr. Marvin is the one who has become obsessive and neurotic. Bob knows how to have a good time and is free-spirited.What does Dr. Marvin do to get rid of Bob? What happens to Bob? What happens to Dr. Marvin...?""What About Bob"" will keep you in stitches because you will laugh from beginning to end. All of the performances are top-notch.

300987,A258YDD6553JA2,630220366X,Mary F. Sibley,"[3, 6]","Imagine a scenario such as this: a patient visits their psychiatrist faithfully, week after week, sometimes several times a week. They lay their heart and soul, and sometimes a little more information than any reasonable person needs to know, into the experienced hands of a doctor who is there to help them through life's little impediments that colour their worlds. Imagine that your psychiatrist decides suddenly (at least in your mind!) to 'desert' you and take a vacation. What is one to do at this unwelcome news? Stand and fight the demons that stalk you, fall to pieces, slip over the dark edge of the abyss? NO! You take yourself to the place where your doctor has gone and make, in his estimation at least, a living hell on earth for him, from which there is no apparent escape.Bob Wiley (Bill Murray) is such a patient. He has already run through a laundry list of analysts and has now been recommended to Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) by an associate, who, strangely enough, is 'getting out of the business.' Bob is a stir-fry concoction of multi-phobias that tend to disrupt his everyday existence, and he ekes out a minor existence that encompasses the services of others who are supposed to 'help' him through them. Dr. Marvin interviews Bob and is willing and ready to show him the door, armed with a copy of his new book, Baby Steps, because of his need to get away on his vacation. What he doesn't realize is that he is unwittingly setting the stage for a disaster of his own making.Wiley manages to track Leo down in the wilds of New Hampshire, to a small resort area, where Marvin's family has a summer place. He needs Leo's help and overcomes, with duress, several of his phobias to reconnect with the person who has helped make it possible for him to withdraw from his shell. Of course, Bob is extremely grateful and wants to show said gratitude. What follows is a comedy of errors, at least on Leo's part, and a fun time is to be had be all concerned, including the audience.Bill Murray, with his hangdog expression, his drooping lower lip that bespeaks an air of 'oops' about it and the general at ease, ragdoll nature of his body, are a bold accompaniment to Dreyfuss's starched, staid, pompous egotist psychiatrist, who rues the day he ever met Bob. There is an absolute feeling of rooting for Bob, the underdog, who manages to bewitch Leo's family, Fay (Julie Hagerty), Anna (Kathryn Erbe) and Sigmund (Charlie Korsmo); the last two being named after Freud and his daughter, Anna. Bob's connection with them is to play one neurotic off another and see the end result. You see, Leo's family is not a family in the sense of the word, but more like patients of his who are expected to tow a mighty line of his making. In this context, Leo is a Jack of all trades and master of none.Murray is perfect for this role and it fits him like a manicured kid glove. The innocence he reflects in the face of both friendliness from others and the animosity projected by Leo, go together like love and marriage, or as the song says, like a horse and carriage. One would not be complete without the other. His pacing of body mannerisms and the delivery of his lines make one wait with utter enthusiasm for whatever witticism will fall from his lips. Our reward? Laughter and ready smiles all around.Richard Dreyfuss is not normally an actor that I care for, but this role was heaven sent. Prickly, spiked, and by the book are ready monikers that have been fashioned for him, and I know of no other actor who could submit, for our approval, the perfect representation of psychiatrists we love to hate... but need all the same. It's a double edged sword, but one that tickles us all the same.Bob and Leo's verbal exchanges are like watching a fast paced tennis match, with lobs generating the slow burns (reminiscent of actor Edgar Kennedy) every so often. The supreme moment happens when Good Morning America comes to interview Marvin about his book, Baby Steps, and what he had envisioned as his moment, comes crashing down as he freezes up. Bob, though, is there to carry the torch. This scene is priceless.Director Frank Oz parlays a simple premise into a tale chock full of laughter and truth telling. The screenplay by Tom Schulman is never meant to patronize analysts or their patients, but rather to showcase things that could or might happen in an endearing and humourous fashion.What About Bob? is a tiny jewel of a classic, that never quite received a huge buildup as is sometimes wont to happen. Like that rare gem, though, we treasure it all the more for the 'feel good' attitude that it imparts to us via laughter and a fun time to be had be all concerned, and hold it all the more to our hearts and funnybones. Of course, we can look upon this film and Bob as the ultimate revenge upon therapists who sometimes hold themselves on a virtual pedestal of their own creation; who feel they are legends in their own minds. Who really needs the therapy; the patient or the doctor? What would Freud say?Power be to Bob!

It's hard to imagine Bill Murray not being funny as most  of his gestures or lines at the least raise a smile whether he's talking to  his goldfish or &quot;baby-stepping&quot; through an office. Much of the  comedy comes from the fact that Bob endears himself to everyone but the  doctor whom Bob professes to idolise. My favourite scene is when Bob  appears with Dr Marvin on a TV special praising the doctors new therapy  manual. The absurd man has told us - &quot;It's going to do alot of good  for a lot of people.

The people who didn't like this movie are obviously missing the creativty and genius, and thought put into this unique story. If you think about it, a patient that is so obnoxious to most pychiatrists, practically stalking his doctor and ends up buddy buddy with his family during the doctor's vacation. First of all, you must understand psychiatrists. Most do not care about people's problems, like in many comedies you see the shrink sleeping in his chair while the patient is blabbing away in the special ""seat"" It's their job to help you, but they mainly try to make alot of money by using their skills, but has nothing to do with caring. This case was no exception. Dr. Leo Marvin, can't stand bob from the very beginning, and i'm not sure how many of you understand the value of VACATIONS but they mean more to doctors than to anyone. They love to get away from their jobs and enjoy free time, which they barely get. And not to mention an extra comic bonus, leo marvin wrote a book and is going on good morning america when he is at his vacation house in new hampshire. It's a hilarious story with non stop laughs. It keeps getting funnier and funnier as leo marvin gets more and more nuts and ends up acting like a patient himself. I don't understand why some people didnt appreciate this movie. Bill Murray was suppose to be annoying, that is why it made it so funny because he drove his doctor insane with every word he spoke, and every bond he shared with his family. Picture a pompous arrogant, anti social, professional pychiatrist being stalked by his new patient. That is if you've never seen it. For those of us who have, you can't help but like it because richard dreyfuss's character is also very funny in what about bob. It's a little old, came out in 91 but you can't tell at all. You get sucked into it because of bill murray's character and his problems become comical. And there is non stop funny lines that are contagious like, YOU THINK HES GONE. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT HE'S NEVER GONE!!! hehehe. And the reason why everyone likes bob and not the doctor is because the doctor sees him as a patient and not as a regular person, but his family gives him a chance, and they realize he's an open, overall harmless and nice person that is thoughtful and fun, and makes everyone laugh. So the doc feels left out as bob takes over his household practically and he is forced to try and be polite by his wife because they all get mad when he mistreats bob.

In an era where comedies are dominated by sex, crudity, and horrid language, ""What About Bob?"" is a breath of fresh air.  The comedy is a harmless and sinless masterpiece of irony with chuckles.  The head-scratching, laugh-at-loud compulsive mannerisms combined with symptoms of paranoia from patient Bob Wiley (B. Murray) pushes this film to the top of clean comedies.  Bob has issues.  Bob is afraid to touch things without a handkerchief.  Bob is afraid of crowds.  Bob has fears of his bladder exploding.  Bob is afraid of anything and everything outside his apartment.  But Bob finds hope in a new and famous psychiatrist named Dr. Leo Marvin (R. Dreyfuss).  Dr. Marvin is at the pinacole of his career with his new best selling help-book that has earned him fame.  When Dr. Marvin takes Bob on as his client, he has no idea what he's getting himself into.Bob goes bananas when his new doctor, Leo Marvin, decides to go on vacation and will not be available to treat Bob for a whole month.  Desperate for his doctor, Bob tracks Dr. Marvin down.  The relaxing Leo Marvin has his vacation interrupted and imposed upon by a friend-seeking Bob Wiley, who wants to enjoy Dr. Marvin's vacation time with him.  Dr. Marvin, shocked by Bob's behavior, is unable to convince Bob to leave.  Before Dr. Marvin can begin to realize that Bob has latched onto him, Bob is aleady befriending Dr. Marvin's entire household; which includes his wife (J. Hagerty) and son (C. Korsmo) and daughter.  Resentment and jealousy become evident in Dr. Marvin as his growing frustration with Bob intensifies.  As Bob grows more popular with everyone, Dr. Marvin sinks into a state of irrational hatred toward his new patient.  Eventually Bob shows evidence of progress as Dr. Marvin displays signs of regress.Even though the movie is a great comedy, it is truly a psychology film.  It takes a neurotic, crazy man--Bob Wiley--and puts him into a setting he doesn't belong in, and he improves.  On the flip side it takes a successful, sane man--Dr. Marvin--and places him into situations he doesn't want, and he deteriorates.  The irony is the patient becomes sane as the doctor turns insane.  It's a very clever concept by Oz and it should be applauded, because it makes the movie very funny.No doubt that the film succeeds in its comic aim and ironic formulas, while sending a distinct message that it's all right not to be entirely sane and serious.  Bob Wiley is the perfect, likeable looney while Dr. Marvin is the serious stiff that we all want to see lighten up a tad.The movie is rated ""PG,"" with hardly any offensive elements.  There is no sex, no nudity, no violence (although hints of killing is mentioned), and mild language.  A joke that Bob tells has a crude reference, but it's nothing to shutter from.  The film is quite clean in an age of film-making that has been anything but.In summary, ""What About Bob?"" is the perfect family comedy.  It is light-hearted, genuine, and funny for everyone.  If any criticism could be applied is that it is simply not long enough and goes by too fast.  To say the least, it's a gem worthy of praise and laughs.",5,"""Is this a radical new form of therapy?""",1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,3257,"['Masterfully', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'comedy', 'one', 'brightest', 'spots', 'long', 'line', 'tasteless', '90', 'comedies', 'era', 'where', 'comedies', 'are', 'dominated', 'sex', 'crudity', 'horrid', 'language', 'What', 'Bob', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'comedy', 'harmless', 'sinless', 'masterpiece', 'irony', 'chuckles', 'head-scratching', 'laugh-at-loud', 'compulsive', 'mannerisms', 'combined', 'symptoms', 'paranoia', 'patient', 'Bob', 'Wiley', 'B.', 'Murray', 'film', 'top', 'clean', 'comedies', 'Bob', 'issues', 'Bob', 'afraid', 'touch', 'things', 'handkerchief', 'Bob', 'afraid', 'crowds', 'Bob', 'fears', 'bladder', 'exploding', 'Bob', 'afraid', 'anything', 'everything', 'apartment', 'Bob', 'hope', 'new', 'famous', 'psychiatrist', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Leo', 'Marvin', 'R.', 'Dreyfuss', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'pinacole', 'career', 'new', 'best', 'selling', 'help-book', 'earned', 'fame', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'Bob', 'client', 'idea', 'what', 'getting', 'into.Bob', 'bananas', 'when', 'new', 'doctor', 'Leo', 'Marvin', 'go', 'vacation', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'available', 'treat', 'Bob', 'whole', 'month', 'Desperate', 'doctor', 'Bob', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'down', 'relaxing', 'Leo', 'Marvin', 'vacation', 'interrupted', 'imposed', 'upon', 'friend-seeking', 'Bob', 'Wiley', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'vacation', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'shocked', 'Bob', 'behavior', 'unable', 'convince', 'Bob', 'leave', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'can', 'begin', 'realize', 'Bob', 'latched', 'Bob', 'aleady', 'befriending', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'entire', 'household', 'wife', 'J.', 'Hagerty', 'son', 'C.', 'Korsmo', 'daughter', 'Resentment', 'jealousy', 'become', 'evident', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'growing', 'frustration', 'Bob', 'intensifies', 'Bob', 'more', 'popular', 'everyone', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'state', 'irrational', 'hatred', 'new', 'patient', 'Eventually', 'Bob', 'evidence', 'progress', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'signs', 'regress.Even', 'movie', 'great', 'comedy', 'truly', 'psychology', 'film', 'neurotic', 'crazy', 'man', 'Bob', 'Wiley', 'setting', ""n't"", 'belong', 'flip', 'side', 'successful', 'sane', 'man', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'situations', ""n't"", 'want', 'irony', 'patient', 'becomes', 'sane', 'doctor', 'insane', 'very', 'clever', 'concept', 'Oz', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'movie', 'very', 'funny.No', 'doubt', 'film', 'comic', 'aim', 'ironic', 'formulas', 'sending', 'distinct', 'message', 'all', 'right', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'sane', 'serious', 'Bob', 'Wiley', 'perfect', 'likeable', 'looney', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'serious', 'stiff', 'want', 'see', 'lighten', 'up', 'tad.The', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'hardly', 'offensive', 'elements', 'sex', 'nudity', 'violence', 'hints', 'killing', 'mentioned', 'mild', 'language', 'joke', 'Bob', 'crude', 'reference', 'nothing', 'shutter', 'film', 'quite', 'clean', 'age', 'film-making', 'been', 'anything', 'but.In', 'summary', 'What', 'Bob', 'perfect', 'family', 'comedy', 'light-hearted', 'genuine', 'funny', 'everyone', 'criticism', 'could', 'be', 'applied', 'simply', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'too', 'fast', 'say', 'least', 'gem', 'worthy', 'praise', 'laughs']",N/A

Well, Bob just cannot live without the constant help from his new doctor, so naturally he finds his way up to the beachhouseand that is where the mayhem begins.This movie is excellent on so many levels.  FIrst, you have Bill Murray, who plays Bob wonderfully.  Bob just never leaves his doctor and his family alone, but the maddening part of it is; that no matter how annoying Bob gets, Dreyfus' family just continues to love him more and more.  Dreyfus tries everything in his power to get Bob to leave and ends up looking like ""the bad guy"" when his family sees this.Second, you have Dreyfus playing Dr. Marvin Monroe.  Dreyfus is so good at showing the fact that his is irritated.  Simple facial expressions or the way he laughs , just sound so natural and fit the role perfectly.This movie is a must see for any Richard Dreyfus or Bill Murray fan.

The storyline is simple: Murray is Bob Wiley. A sweet man, who is afraid of just about everything. and Dreyfus is his new Therapist, Dr Leo Marvin. Bob ends up tracking his Dr and his family to their vacation home, and proceeds to invade their life in every way imaginable.  Bill Murray plays Bob with a sense of complete joy and abandon, and it's obvious that it's a role only he could have done.My only complaint, is that for the DVD release, there is zero special features. it would have been nice to see behind the scenes footage, or possbly some kind of commentary...but the movie still stands alone as a one of the funniest ever made.",5,A comedy classic,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,926,"['What', 'Bob', 'rare', 'film', 'indeed', 'comedy', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'tired', 'One', '13', 'years', 'initial', 'release', 'lost', 'none', 'joyusly', 'demented', 'charm.Unlike', 'what', 'few', 'previous', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'together', 'storyline', 'simple', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'Wiley', 'A', 'sweet', 'man', 'who', 'afraid', 'just', 'everything', 'Dreyfus', 'new', 'Therapist', 'Dr', 'Leo', 'Marvin', 'Bob', 'up', 'tracking', 'Dr', 'family', 'vacation', 'home', 'proceeds', 'invade', 'life', 'way', 'imaginable', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Bob', 'sense', 'complete', 'joy', 'abandon', 'obvious', 'role', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'done.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'release', 'zero', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'scenes', 'footage', 'possbly', 'kind', 'commentary', 'movie', 'still', 'alone', 'one', 'funniest', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss were awesome together. Bill plays Bob Wiley, an obsessive compulsive man who seeks Dr. Leo Marvin's help. When Dr. Marvin goes on a vacation, Bob tries to call him, but Dr. Marvin doesn't like to deal with patients at home.  Bob even pretends to be a police officer in order to get Dr. Marvin's address. Bob finds him, and Dr. Marvin thinks it's highly inappropriate, but his wife, his son, and daughter all start to like Bob. Bob even helps Dr. Marvin's son to dive, which he was afraid of. Dr. Marvin really wants Bob to leave because he has a tv interview with Good Morning America about his new book. Dr. Marvin really starts to lose his cool when Bob is in tv with him and won't leave because everybody seems to like him.

There is one line about food in this movie that makes me laugh until I cry! Literally. It is perhaps the facial expressions right before the line.... and the wittiness with which it is executed.The first time I saw this movie, my husband and I were just dating, after being married for almost six years now, I finally watched this again...having missed that one line twice already...and finally I knew why my husband and his friend at the time were almost crying they were laughing so much. Now that I just sat and watched the whole entire movie all at once...I felt like this is absolutely the funniest comedy ever!Bob's first shrink leaves town and is finally free. Little does his second shrink know that he is going to be followed to the end of the earth, even while on vacation. Bob is obsessive compulsive to say the least. He is afraid to leave the house and could be considered these days to have Panic Disorder or social anxiety. The funny thing is, when he really wants something...he can get it! In his efforts to cure himself, he about drives his shrink insane. The funny part is, he is clueless to what how he is affecting his psychiatrist Dr. Leo Marvin (Dreyfuss).Like a clown from out of town, Bob brightens up the families life while Dr. Leo turns quite sadistic. His family loves Bob and his silly ways. They all seem a lot like Bob in a way, while Dr. Leo seems to have everything under control.While my minor was in psychology, I think we can solve most of our problems by learning to laugh at ourselves. ;) The only movie I have seen that was close to being as funny is ""Some Like It Hot.""

In fact he has so many of them that he tracks down his new psychiatrist during their family vacation in order to continue therapy. He 'has' to talk with Dr. Marvin to resolve his many issues.Seeking 'help' from the gradually-annoyed professional, Bob is unaware that undertaking his adventure itself provides him with a powerful therapy unavailable in an office setting. The social recluse we meet at the beginning of this screenplay contrasts with the happy and well-adjusted man he became.His resourcefulness and creativity in getting to the Marvin's summer home demonstrate that a man who is innocently unaware of many social norms still possesses a fair amount of street smarts. Undertaking this journey and it's experiences required a lot of work and determination.And in contrast to Dr. Leo Marvin, who is more concerned with obtaining fame and fortune, Bob does try to think of other people. Dr. Marvin's summer home itself used to belong to other area residents, but it was vacated in a land deal never thoroughly explored throughout the screenplay. Adding some brief additional information that Dr. Marvin is not a 'nice' guy, it is not really needed.Bob's mindset quickly won the heart of the other Marvins and eventually marriage to his sister Lilly.  It  even won over the staff of a state institution where an increasingly-frazzled Dr. Marvin attempts to leave him in desperation. Because the director is a colleague, her diagnosis of Bob as not crazy continues pushing Dr. Marvin to the edge. He cannot believe he is the only one disliking Bob Wiley.The movie is a powerful statement about people with challenges ultimately overcoming their life obstacles. It is more important to be a good person than to be rich and powerful. Pitting Dr. Marvin against his family and the other townspeople helping Bob, it also critiques conventional medicine's self-positioning as 'the expert' and others as patients who cannot/should not have any say in their own lives.",4,RX: Death Therapy,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1993,"['Bob', 'Wiley', 'issues', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'down', 'new', 'psychiatrist', 'family', 'vacation', 'order', 'continue', 'therapy', ""'has"", 'talk', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'resolve', 'many', 'issues.Seeking', ""'help"", 'gradually-annoyed', 'professional', 'Bob', 'unaware', 'undertaking', 'adventure', 'powerful', 'therapy', 'unavailable', 'office', 'setting', 'social', 'recluse', 'meet', 'beginning', 'screenplay', 'happy', 'well-adjusted', 'man', 'resourcefulness', 'creativity', 'getting', 'Marvin', 'summer', 'home', 'demonstrate', 'man', 'who', 'innocently', 'unaware', 'many', 'social', 'norms', 'still', 'fair', 'amount', 'street', 'smarts', 'Undertaking', 'journey', 'experiences', 'required', 'lot', 'work', 'determination.And', 'contrast', 'Dr.', 'Leo', 'Marvin', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'obtaining', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Bob', 'try', 'think', 'other', 'people', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'summer', 'home', 'used', 'belong', 'other', 'area', 'residents', 'was', 'vacated', 'land', 'deal', 'never', 'thoroughly', 'explored', 'screenplay', 'Adding', 'brief', 'additional', 'information', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'not', ""'nice"", 'guy', 'not', 'really', 'needed.Bob', 'mindset', 'quickly', 'won', 'heart', 'other', 'Marvins', 'eventually', 'marriage', 'sister', 'Lilly', 'even', 'won', 'staff', 'state', 'institution', 'where', 'increasingly-frazzled', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'attempts', 'leave', 'desperation', 'director', 'colleague', 'diagnosis', 'Bob', 'not', 'crazy', 'pushing', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'edge', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'only', 'one', 'disliking', 'Bob', 'Wiley.The', 'movie', 'powerful', 'statement', 'people', 'challenges', 'ultimately', 'overcoming', 'life', 'obstacles', 'more', 'important', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'be', 'rich', 'powerful', 'Pitting', 'Dr.', 'Marvin', 'family', 'other', 'townspeople', 'helping', 'Bob', 'also', 'conventional', 'medicine', 'self-positioning', ""'the"", 'expert', 'others', 'patients', 'who', 'can', 'not', '/should', 'not', 'have', 'say', 'own', 'lives']",N/A

In the early 80's  (when I was just a tot) my Mom started letting me watch Saturday Night Live  and I particularly liked the skits that included Bill Murray.  One of the  funniest comedians to ever live, Murray pulls out all the stops in this  movie, giving one of the best performances of his life. In this hilarious  film about an obsessive compulsive and his relationship with his  short-tempered therapist the laughs never stop coming.  When the therapist  (played by Richard Dreyfuss) takes his family on vacation his most needy  patient, Bob(Murray) decides he can't live without his therapy sessions and  follows the family.  Antics ensue that, although I can pretty much quote  them by heart, still put me in stitches everytime I watch.  There isn't  much in this movie that should keep parents from letting kids watch(some  language that's it).  If you are a comedy fan and you haven't seen this  movie well then you have been lying to yourself.  For a supposed comedy fan  to have not seen this movie, well there's just no excuse.  Bill Murray is  always worth the price of admission if you need a good laugh.  Although  sometimes he doesn't leave much room between for those essential breaths of  air.

The film is a laugh-out-loud comedy about a psychiatrist's worst nightmare; a mental patient that just won't go away!Bill Murray remarkably plays the annoying yet very nice and gentle Bob Wiley, a man suffering from a personality disorder, who is refered to Dr. Leo Marvin, played by Dreyfuss, by his previous doctors who just couldn't handle him anymore. Bob is more than just a patient, he is the kind of guy who doesn't acknowledge the personal and private lives of his doctors and therefore sticks to them like 'crazy glue' and just won't go away! Dr Marvin is in for a big and unpleasant surprise after his first and last session with Bob right before he is to embark on a one month vacation with his family in Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. Bob follows him there and that's when the funniest doctor-patient relationship/fued begins.Murray gives a very funny performance in this one, getting on your nerves in most of the scenes he is in but in the meantime, causing the laughs to break out.

Dreyfus is superb as the unfortunate Psychiatrist who inherited Bob's case who during the course of the film ironicly ends up a mental case himself.The role reversals of the these two characters is the core of what makes this story work. However, it is definately the character of Bob that makes it a supreme comedy. The facial expressions, the pet goldfish ('gill') Bob carries around his neck, and his multitude of bizarre neurosises, combined with his basic lovability, all make him a wonderful character. It's also free of gratiuitous sex and violence (a rare thing these days) and save for Bob's outbursts of 'turets', is free of profanity in the context of all the rest of the dialogue. In other words, it's a movie for the family.Definately worth watching.

Bob comes to him for guidance but Dr. Leo is in a rush to go on his summer vacation,  so he gets brushed off and sent out the door with a copy of the Dr.'s new best-selling book, Baby Steps.  Bob can't handle it himself and decides to follow Dr. Leo to his vacation home.  Bob's insistent efforts to get to Dr. Leo causes his family to become endeared to him and his child-like qualities, while Dr. Leo sees Bob's efforts so invasive he starts to become unhinged himself.This movie is a real treat.  Great performances all around and  one of Bill Murray's funniest roles.  From watching the reaction of the family members, one wonders how much of the goofiness was improvised by Murray.  Dreyfuss is splendid also as he slowly loses his patience and eventually his sanity.  It gets a solid four stars and a buy recommendation.  Watch it when you need a lift.
