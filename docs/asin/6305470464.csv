The performances are all good, though my favorite sidebar followed Angelina Jolie (definitely the standout here) and Ryan Phillipe dealing with more baggage than a holiday at JFK and their struggle to form a relationship. Cool soundtrack. The pieces fit like a puzzle, and while it is slightly detached and disjointed at the beginning where you are trying to figure out what connects all these stories together, it's one of those movies where for lack of a better phrase &quot;gets better as it goes along...&quot; A definite chick flick, but I watched this with my brother and even he enjoyed it.",4,"A lovely, entertaining film",977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,737,"['story', '3', 'sisters', 'parents', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'love', 'death', 'adultery', 'relationships', 'like', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'favorite', 'sidebar', 'followed', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'definitely', 'standout', 'here', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'dealing', 'more', 'baggage', 'holiday', 'JFK', 'struggle', 'form', 'relationship', 'Cool', 'soundtrack', 'pieces', 'fit', 'puzzle', 'slightly', 'detached', 'disjointed', 'beginning', 'where', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'stories', 'together', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'quot', 'better', 'quot', 'A', 'definite', 'chick', 'flick', 'watched', 'brother', 'even', 'enjoyed']",Playing By Heart VHS

Excellent cast and directing will not endear it to those that feel impromtu chatty movies are for women and men with with a lack of self assurance. Well that or psychiatrist interested in getting your hard earned money by having you visit regularly. I have the same issue with doctors that just want to check things out all the time. I appreciate those concerned enough to want to discuss things, but to me this is no more entertainment than the mindless action movies. And quite honestly they are easier to sit through. I couldn't watch all of this because as much as I like the stars in it, it was like going to a weekend talk session with a high school counselor. Now if I was depressed for some reason or unsure of myself, I could go for that. So unless you are, you may find this movie a bit overly dramatic yet not realistic.

465965,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305470464,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 4]","As soon as I heard the opening, voice-over monologue from Joan (Angelina Jolie), Playing by Heart had me. I knew it would be interesting, but I also saw the trap the writer/director/producer (Willard Carroll) had set for himself. I wanted to shout through the screen and warn him -- if only so at the conclusion I could have the schadenfreud of saying 'I told you so.' Because Willard Carroll, who has many more credits as a producer than he has as a writer or director, was making the rookie mistake of being too clever. Like one of his characters, Meredith (Gillian Anderson), a theater director, who when given a compliment that someone liked her play has to ask: ""Before or after I deconstructed it?""Let's take a moment to deconstruct that opening monologue. First, Joan name drops Chet Baker, and this shows that she is very sophisticated, to appreciate Chet Baker. Even to know who Chet Baker is colors me impressed. But would she be the kind of person who appreciates Chet Baker for purely superficial reasons; like his movie star good looks that led photographer Bruce Weber to become a fan and make a documentary called Let's Get Lost that dwelled on Chet's Matinee Idol looks; and paired him with Chris Isaak, though their music was apples and oranges, merely because they both made photogenic models? Or would Joan be the kind of jazz fan who loved Chet for his beautiful sound and lyricism, even if years of drugs had taken their toll on his looks, and a drug dealer had smashed his teeth in, forcing him to adjust his embouchure to allow for playing with dentures?Besides name dropping Chet Baker, which could be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on whether Joan was sincere or merely a poseur, she quoted a line that I have always admired, or at least a paraphrase of it. The musician who played like Chet Baker was supposed to have said, when Joan wanted to talk about how his solo made her feel, that talking about music was like dancing about architecture. Or talking about love, also like dancing about architecture. I know this quote, actually it says that writing about music is like dancing about architecture, but the problem is, her friend, the Chet Bakeresque trumpeter, is not the person who made up this quote. I thought that Elvis Costello had said this, and he did say it in an interview in 1983, but when asked about it later, he didn't remember saying it, but thought he had heard Martin Mull say it. It is also attributed to Steve Martin, Frank Zappa, and Laurie Anderson. Even Frank Lloyd Wright is supposed to have said it, but that seems Frank Lloyd Wrong, because, being an architect, he would have seen no contradiction in dancing about architecture. Willard Carroll was so enamored of the simile that the original title of Playing by Heart was going to be Dancing about Architecture. But Willard Carroll, the producer, wisely decided that it would be too clever, much to the chagrin of Willard Carroll, the writer, and also Willard Carroll, the director.Playing By Heart shows various couples, seemingly unrelated, but all in various stages and phases of love. Joan (played to perfection by a young Angelina Jolie) is the kind of woman who talks too loud on the phone, yelling the intimate details of her life even louder to be heard over the din of the L.A. nightclub she is in. Keenan (Ryan Phillippe) is a keen observer. He doesn't say much, but you can tell that he doesn't miss a thing. He sees right through Joan, but keeps his own cards close to the vest. But it seems like to an extrovert like Joan, Eau D'Indifference is the most irresistible cologne of all. As she tells her sister afterwards, once again talking too loud into her phone:------------------Joan: The lad doesn't say much and when he does, he finds just the right words to crush my soul.==========================Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe look like they would make a very cute couple, but here I have to say that they are both acting up a storm. Their good looks are like masks actors put on to portray characters. This film is pre-Oscar for Girl, Interrupted, and really shows great potential for Jolie. I would almost say that she is acting better here than in GI. Phillippe is an excellent foil for her. He is understated, while she chews up the scenery and spits it out. The more he holds back, the more you wonder: what is his deep dark secret?-------------------Joan: [to waitress] I'll have a vodka martini, very dry, straight up. three olives, and... my sullen friend here will have...Keenan: A Coke.Joan: The poster boy for designated drivers will have a *Coke.*===================================Paul (Sean Connery) and Hannah (Gena Rowlands) are also going through a rough patch, but the month is December rather than May. They banter like an old married couple, because they are an old married couple.------------------------------------Paul: Don't look at me with that tone of voice.===========================================Paul corrects Hannah's grammar. At one point she says she wouldn't feel any different, and he says 'differently.' Remember that distinction, because there is a small though subtle pay off later, in what passes for a running gag among the chronically clever. A lot of Playing By Heart concerns how we show our love by paying attention to the minute details of what is said by our loved ones, even if we correct their grammar:----------------------------Paul: You're overwrought.Hannah: I'm perfectly wrought. Given the circumstances, I'm even a little underwrought.Paul: There's no such word.Hannah: There is now.==================================================The cleverest couple, and the character who lets her cleverness sabotage her happiness the most, would have to be Meredith (Gillian Anderson) and Trent (Jon Stewart). Meredith is, of course, if you have been paying attention, the play director. This is how her version of 'meet cute' plays out:---------------Trent: You know I'm not just asking you to dinner as a pre-emptive strike against litigation. I'm asking because...Meredith: I'll have dinner with you.Trent: What changed your mind?Meredith: Anyone who can say 'preemptive strike against litigation' with a straight face deserves a dinner companion.=============================Trent is a match for Meredith in the clever department, but at least he doesn't take himself or his own cleverness too seriously. Just as in Jon Stewart's real life gig, as the anchor of The Daily Show, Trent knows the importance of humor:-------------Meredith: Wow.Trent: Yeah I know, the flowers are a little much, but I'm late. But only because I had second thoughts about the flowers and threw them away halfway down the block. Then had third thoughts and went back and got them.=================================Sometimes though, in love and life, it is best to go with your first inspiration. The first thought, let alone the second or third. There is such a thing as over-thinking, Meredith. That is what Trent is trying to tell you, though he does it in a self-mocking way. I think he likes you.While Meredith and Keenan seem to resist falling in love and getting in a relationship with Trent and Joan, respectively, Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards) just want a physical relationship without any emotional baggage. They are both married, but not to each other. Madeleine Stowe steals the show with her passionate performance. She, not the guy, is the one who pushes for the no strings set up. Anthony Edwards will be familiar to those who have seen ER in the early seasons, where he played a doctor. He is a different kind of professional here, but I wouldn't dream of spoiling the surprise by telling on him. By the way, there is a clever reference to the spoiler of all spoilers in this movie, so if you still don't know what Citizen Kane means when he says ""Rosebud"" you had better watch that one first.Another mystery is just who is Hugh (Dennis Quaid). He keeps turning up and telling people harrowing tales, and you really start to believe his sob stories, but the problem is he tells everyone a different story. If he is a con man, then what is he after? He never seems to get anything out of it. At one point he claims to be a TV exec in charge or ABC's Thursday Night Line-up. His wife is shacked up with the guy who is in charge of NBC's. Oh, the bitter irony, when he gets fired. The lawyer who is hearing his tale of woe is played by none other than Nastassja Kinski. But he passes up her offer of 'coffee.' What gives?-------------Hugh: I'm better at all these lies I've manufactured than I am at the ones I'm living.=====================Another sub plot involves a mother and son. Paul (Jay Mohr), the son, is dying of AIDS, and is using his last days to finally get straight, so to speak, with his mother, Mildred (Ellen Burstyn). Meanwhile, the movie keeps cutting back and forth from Hugh, Mark and Mildred, and the different couples.Back to Trent and Meredith:----------------------------Meredith: Well, That doesn't take long does it?Trent: What doesn't?Meredith: I mean, you turn a guy down a-and WHAM. he just metamorphoses into an anger ball.Trent: An 'Anger ball'?Meredith: See.======================================By the time the third woman has thrown out an 'anger ball' epitaph at her man, like it was the phrase that pays in a radio contest, you begin to suspect something. Just who are these sisters talking to? Who are the sisters they are talking to? Is it all relative? Stay tuned.The final scene is where all the cleverness takes its toll. What kills it for me is the sound track. They are all at an event with live music, it is actually supposed to be the jazz band that Joan dug. The trumpet player is the guy who said the line about dancing about architecture. But the music is smooth jazz mixed with an orchestral score, all obviously dubbed in. Jonathan Demme in Rachel Getting Married used lots of musicians playing live. It was well integrated into the scene, the only thing you could complain about was perhaps they had too many musicians. It is so fake in Playing By Heart, and the whole effect is ruined. Another example of jazz music being used in a film, but in a good way, would be Mo' Better Blues. I'm not saying that the music in Playing By Heart was bad, just that in this scene, where everything was riding on its integrity, it was fake, not the music that the band was playing. They had Chris Botti writing some tunes and playing trumpet, and actually had two composers scoring the soundtrack -- one was scrapped for some reason. There were a couple of Chet Baker recordings used for some scenes. But in the final crucial scene, when all the chips were down, writer/director/producer Willard Carroll choked.Still, I am giving this 4 stars for all the clever dialogue, and the stellar cast who really delivered their lines as if they had thought them all up themselves.---------------------------Meredith: I'll tell you what I don't want. I don't want all this calculated artificiality. This dress, these stupid little bows in my hair, they aren't me. I mean, look at you. You - you don't sit around your house in an Armani suit, do you?Trent: No. My house is black-tie.====================================Smart People(2008) ....

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[17, 19]","When most movies boast of an &quot;all-star cast,&quot; what they usually mean is 2, maybe 3 big name actors + a bunch of people you've never heard of.  Not so with this film.  With the likes of Dennis Quaid, Sean Connery, Madeline Stowe, Gillian Anderson and Angelina Jolie, this one truly lives up to the promise of having a celebrity-filled cast.  They could have funded the first manned mission to Mars with the payroll of this movie.  Even better, these are all cream-of-the-crop actors, as opposed to being big-name pseudo actors (like Keanu Reeves, for instance).The story is about 3 sisters (Stowe, Anderson &amp; Jolie), all of whom experience various troubles regarding men.  Stowe's character is involved in a passionless marriage; the only way she can feel alive &amp; vibrant is by engaging in a lascivious sexual arrangement with a fellow apartment tenant.Anderson plays the sister &quot;in the middle&quot; who has been burned by men in her past &amp; is apprehensive and more than a little bit reluctant to &quot;play the field&quot; again.Jolie's persona, meanwhile, just plain can't seem to find the right guy.  She goes thru frequent romances, but never finds a worthwhile partner to hang on to.In the meantime, their parents are having their own marital troubles.  Closing in on their 40th wedding anniversary, they cannot help but summon up ghosts of past lovers.The tale is presented in a very different way than any other film I have ever seen.  We see the characters deal with their individual struggles, then their stories are woven together at the end.  This is a fascinating &quot;angle&quot; by which to detail the narrative.The film is very well done &amp; all of the acting performances, as expected with this ensemble, are impeccable.  Jolie, in particular, stands out.  The acting job she delivers is magnificent;  I become a bigger &amp; bigger fan of her's each movie I see her in.  This is one of the best &quot;date&quot; movies I have ever seen;  funny, yet emotionally poignant.

I remember seeing the previews  for it, and laughing out loud at the scenes between Gillian Anderson, the  heavenly Jon Stewart, and a big dog, who commenced to share the bed with  Stewart. The film had those laughs, and much more. It is not a deep film,  or a great classic, but it is a fun little romantic comedy about how to  find love and how to make it last.If for no other reason, you should see  it for the actors. Where else can you find such a talented cast raging in  age from late teens to mid-60's, from former James Bonds, to Angelina  Jolie, to one of the ER docs, to Dana Scully herself? (I have to say it was  mighty funny to see Gillian Anderson acting nerdy and awkward. She's  usually so confident, and half of America is in love with her! But she did  great.)The actors all do a nice job with this film. You get the  impression that it was their treat film they made for themselves for fun,  in between other projects. You can tell they loved working together.Ryan  Phillipe and Angelina Jolie both do wondrously as a hip young couple (he  has blue hair, she has pink hair!) in an emotionally charged on-again,  off-again relationship. Jay Mohr gives a solid and realistic performance as  a terminally ill man coming to terms with his illness with the help of his  mother. I think this part of the film reminds us that life is short, and  that love is the most important thing, and that we shouldn't take either  for granted. Madeleine Stowe is good as the lonely housewife who is bonking  a pastor (Anthony Edwards). Dennis Quaid, as her husband, does a nice job,  shall we say, &quot;acting out.&quot; Gena Rowlands is, as always, touching  and elegant, and her hubby, Sean Connery, is cute as a button. They look so  good together, I'm surprised they're not actually married!This film is  a great pick-me-up film.

Despite Mallrats' terrible theatre performace, Gramercy decided  to revisit the DVD with a special edition and it sold wonderfully.Bottom  line: This is an absolutely wonderful film with next to ZERO extras. Pick  it up if you love this film, but the VHS version might be the better one  for the money.And a note to Miramax: A good percentage of the time,  there is a really good algebraic formula when it comes to DVD.

The range is from 40 years of marriage to just meeting someone.  Although these are seemingly different sketches, the whole is related.  About half-way through the movie, key words will appear, which will tip you off that all is part of the one story, or topic, relationships.I had not been a fan of Angelina Jolie until this movie.  With the exception of Connery and Rowland, her performance was the most believable.  Most of the other performances, especially John Stewart's and Gillian Anderson's, did not seem inspired.  It is a little disappointing, but it does not hurt the movie.  My judgment of their performance may be skewed since I have preconceived ideas of how they act.  For Anderson, I can't help thinking of Dana Scully, and for Stewart, I am reminded of his comedy.Not a bad movie, but the movie tips its hand a couple of times.  I was not surprised by the ending because I knew what would happen before it got there (with the exception of Anthony Edwards' character).",3,Don't be an anger ball!,1032134400,"09 16, 2002",2002,1103,"['Playing', 'Heart', 'series', 'vignettes', 'showing', 'different', 'aspects', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'kinds', 'relationships', 'range', '40', 'years', 'marriage', 'just', 'meeting', 'someone', 'are', 'seemingly', 'different', 'sketches', 'whole', 'related', 'half-way', 'movie', 'key', 'words', 'will', 'appear', 'will', 'tip', 'off', 'part', 'one', 'story', 'topic', 'relationships.I', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'fan', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'movie', 'exception', 'Connery', 'Rowland', 'performance', 'was', 'most', 'believable', 'Most', 'other', 'performances', 'especially', 'John', 'Stewart', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'inspired', 'little', 'disappointing', 'not', 'hurt', 'movie', 'judgment', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'skewed', 'have', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'how', 'act', 'Anderson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Stewart', 'am', 'reminded', 'comedy.Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'movie', 'hand', 'couple', 'times', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'ending', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'got', 'there', 'exception', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'character']",Playing By Heart VHS

Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[4, 4]","In a strange turn of events, the ending of 'Playing by Heart' will have you wondering what you missed during the first hour and fifteen minutes of the movie.  The story centers on several pairs of people, four couples, a mother and son and in a very strange and perplexing role, Dennis Quaid playing several different characters in several different scenes.  His work in these scenes shines and harkens back to his glory days, reassuring us that his career is not over by any means.  Another stand out role is Angelina Jolie, in one of her first appearances.  She absolutely radiates and steals every scene, leaving Ryan Philipee and his subtle performance in the dust.  Not that it's a bad thing.  Her character is sassy and full of life, where his is downtrodden, solitary and dark.  Other stories involve a married couple approaching their 40th anniversary dealing with mortality and a bad memory from the past.  Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart play career individuals who are trying to get through awkward moments of their first dates.  It's nice to see Anderson play a role that is insecure and troubled rather then her well known persona on X-Files where she is strong and confident.  The stories play out their seperate plots and eventually climax with a emotional and uplifting finale that makes anyone whos ever been in a relationship feel something for all these people.

Unlike most movies like this though, these characters have something fresh and fascinating to say. ""Playing By Heart"" is a sadly underappreciated gem of a movie with a great script and a cast that is almost too good to believe. That said, the movie lacks a focus that draws everything together (other than the foreseeable denoument).We meet several groups of characters who are all exploring different aspects of love. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, whose subltle acting is a marvel to behold, play an old married couple whose marriage is facing old obstacles. Connery is dying, and Rowlands confronts him about a supposed infidelity twenty-five years before. Gillian Anderson plays a stony theatre director who finds love in the unlikely person of a pre-""Daily Show"" Jon Stewart, while Dennis Quaid and Madeline Stowe are both exploring ways to live outside of their unsatisfactory marriages. There is sensitive, quiet acting in the persons of Ellen Burstyn and Jay Mohr. Burstyn plays Mohr's mother, who is staying by her son's bedside as he dies of AIDS. I only wish there had been more of them.But most astounding of all is the story of two young clubbers played flawlessly by Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe. The two actors are so real and raw that you can't help but be sucked in by their story, and ultimately their emotional openness makes you cry. I wanted to see an entire movie based on Jolie and Phillippe, they were that good. And in a cast like this one, that's an accomplishment.""Playing By Heart"" is wonderfully acted. It's the only movie where you can have Ellen Burstyn, Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie, Ryan Phillippe, Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart, Jay Mohr, Dennis Quaid, Anthony Edwards, and Madeline Stowe share the same screen. Even Patricia Clarkson makes a brief appearance. The script is wonderfully witty and the directing is very good.

I certainly hadn't until cruising around Amazon one day and following a link for Gillian Anderson.  Being interested in seeing her in a role outside of &quot;The X-Files&quot; I ordered this film but for whatever reasons, this DVD sat on the rack until recently.  Clearly, after watching this, I should've checked it out sooner.&quot;Playing by Heart&quot; is hinged upon a star studded cast and a casually paced but well timed and written script that plays very well emotionally.  One cannot help but think that as an ensemble cast, the majority, if not all of the stars of this film, took a significant cut in pay for doing this film, in effect, showing their shared affections for the script.On to this stellar cast, let's see, in alphabetical order; Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Madeline Stowe, WOW!  As expected, it was extremely wonderful to see Gillian Anderson outside of the &quot;Scully&quot; role and it will be nice to see her in future films.  As is usual with Angelina Jolie, she presents an entirely different character in this film and displays perfectly the range of her acting skills.  Overall kudos goes to the entire cast for their collective performances in this wonderful film about life.High praise goes to Willard Carroll for having written and directed this charming and extremely enjoyable film!  This movie apparently won high critical acclaim when it was in the theaters, and it now deserves as much acclaim as it can from those that count, movie watchers who enjoy well scripted and performed movies!  The score plays perfectly to the film as well.The Premise:&quot;Playing by Heart&quot; is an extremely well told story about life, love and the ups and downs that love brings to those that try to embrace it.  The movie cuts frequently between several different couples who are either struggling through the difficulties of burgeoning love, middle years of marriage or the older couple looking back upon their lives together.What follows from there is a movie that leads to a wonderful ending that is unfortunately a bit predictable but doesn't detract from the experience in any way and in fact actually enhances the experience.

465990,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6305470464,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[0, 0]","PLAYING BY HEART is a character-driven drama about the sometimes funny (sometimes painful) and always complex ways love can touch your life (and your heart). Set in Los Angeles, the film weaves in and out of the lives of a group of eleven people of varied generations and lifestyles, all of whom are experiencing love in one of its many maddening stages. Some people are finding it, some are rediscovering it, and others are losing it. What they have in common is an intense desire to express how love makes them feel.The film weaves in and out of these stories with no paricular destination, but it offers some honest, crisp, and funny dialogue, not to mention more than a few surprises. The film focuses on a series of couples (and all those somehow connected with them), who are in one way or another battling relationship problems. There is the long married couple (Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery)  dealing with the pains of a past affair that may or may not have happeed, the Gen-X club-hoppers (Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe) who may or may not want a relationship, the divorcee (Gillian Anderson) unable to commit to a new love (Jon Stewart), the married woman (Madeleine Stowe) having an affair with the married man (Anthony Edwards), the heartbroken mother(Ellen Burstyn) whose gay son (Jay Mohr) is dying of AIDS, and of course, the man (Dennis Quaid) who frequents bars to lie to women. The biggest mystery is how these characters are interrelated, but when it is finally revealed, it seems all too predictable . But who cares--it is the unbelievably excellent performances that make Playing by Heart such a wonderful film to watch. The cast has amazing chemistry, and all but carry the film on their shoulders. From start to finish, Playing By Heart is a wonderful, clever, and moving picture--an undiscovered gem that deserves an audience.",5,Wonderful Romantic Drama,1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,1856,"['PLAYING', 'BY', 'HEART', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'always', 'complex', 'ways', 'love', 'can', 'touch', 'life', 'heart', 'Set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'film', 'weaves', 'lives', 'group', 'eleven', 'people', 'varied', 'generations', 'lifestyles', 'whom', 'are', 'experiencing', 'love', 'one', 'many', 'maddening', 'stages', 'people', 'are', 'finding', 'are', 'rediscovering', 'others', 'are', 'losing', 'What', 'have', 'common', 'intense', 'desire', 'express', 'how', 'love', 'feel.The', 'film', 'weaves', 'stories', 'paricular', 'destination', 'honest', 'crisp', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'not', 'mention', 'more', 'few', 'surprises', 'film', 'series', 'couples', 'somehow', 'connected', 'who', 'are', 'one', 'way', 'battling', 'relationship', 'problems', 'long', 'married', 'couple', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'dealing', 'pains', 'past', 'affair', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'happeed', 'Gen-X', 'club-hoppers', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'relationship', 'divorcee', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'unable', 'commit', 'new', 'love', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'married', 'woman', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'heartbroken', 'mother', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'gay', 'son', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'course', 'man', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'bars', 'lie', 'women', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'interrelated', 'when', 'finally', 'revealed', 'too', 'predictable', 'who', 'unbelievably', 'excellent', 'performances', 'make', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'wonderful', 'film', 'watch', 'cast', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'carry', 'film', 'shoulders', 'start', 'finish', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'wonderful', 'clever', 'moving', 'picture', 'undiscovered', 'gem', 'audience']",Playing By Heart VHS
465991,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305470464,Matthew Horner,"[6, 6]","Miramax, the premiere producer and distributor of independent films in the world, gave Playing by Heart a limited and uninspired theatrical release in January 1999. They sold it as a comedy. It's actually a drama. Perhaps Miramax was too busy promoting its hugely successful Oscar contenders, Shakespeare in Love and Life is Beautiful. Whatever the case, don't let the fact that you may not have heard of Playing by Heart deter you. It's a fine movie and a welcome alternative to the cartoonish megahits we were offered this summer.Essentially, the film is a study of how people handle the powerful emotion called love. The couples we meet range from the very young to the old. As we watch these people deal with affairs of the heart, it is slowly revealed to us that each of them is somehow involved with everyone else. I won't tell you how.Leading the fantastic cast are Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, who play Paul and Hannah, a couple on the eve of their fortieth wedding anniversary. Amidst the joy, a new problem and an old one threaten to ruin the occasion. Hugh and Gracie [Dennis Quaid and Madeline Stowe] have been married fourteen years. They have forgotten how to love one another. Meredith [Gillian Anderson] is the bitter victim of a marriage that failed for reasons neither she nor her ex-husband could prevent. She has adopted the hard edge of a person who believes that love will never work for her. When she meets Roger [Anthony Edwards], the attraction is there, but her acquired defense mechanisms make the relationship seem doomed. When young actress, Joan [Angelina Jolie], spies Keenan [Ryan Philippe] in a hot disco, she falls for the kid. Keenan has a major broken heart, and Joan has her work cut out for her. Finally, Mildred [Ellen Burstyn] must reach out to her estranged son, Mark [Jay Mohr], who is dying of AIDS.I think Miramax decided to call this a comedy because director Willard Carroll delivered a sophisticated movie. You cannot have a film devoted to the subject of love without having scenes where hankies are required. He shows these moments without dwelling on them. He quickly moves on to the next event. And he does find a lot of humor in the frustrations and the self-doubts that come with love.I had a couple of problems with Playing by Heart, but both of them were fairly minor. The subject matter is one more commonly associated with French and Italian movies. It is not one we Americans are incapable of doing well, but often, as here, we put so many stars in the vehicle that it gets overwhelmed. Happily, the ones in Playing From the Heart are generally excellent actors. The movie also suffers a bit from being too well constructed and written. The result is that several of the couples are interesting enough to fill a whole picture on their own, and we feel a bit cheated that we saw so little of them. Despite these little flaws, it remains one of the best and most original romantic movies of late.There is such a wide age range in these love stories that one or more is bound to affect you. My personal favorite was the young couple, Keenan and Joan. They seemed such a perfect fit. Angelina Jolie is a consummate actress, and she may have inspired Ryan Philippe to give his best performance to date.",4,Little known movie is a gem,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,3258,"['Miramax', 'premiere', 'producer', 'distributor', 'independent', 'films', 'world', 'gave', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'limited', 'uninspired', 'theatrical', 'release', 'January', '1999', 'sold', 'comedy', 'actually', 'drama', 'Perhaps', 'Miramax', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'promoting', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'Whatever', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'heard', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'deter', 'fine', 'movie', 'welcome', 'alternative', 'cartoonish', 'megahits', 'were', 'offered', 'summer.Essentially', 'film', 'study', 'how', 'people', 'handle', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'called', 'love', 'couples', 'meet', 'range', 'very', 'young', 'old', 'watch', 'people', 'deal', 'affairs', 'heart', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'somehow', 'involved', 'everyone', 'else', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how.Leading', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'are', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'who', 'play', 'Paul', 'Hannah', 'couple', 'eve', 'fortieth', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'joy', 'new', 'problem', 'old', 'one', 'threaten', 'ruin', 'occasion', 'Hugh', 'Gracie', '[', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', ']', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'fourteen', 'years', 'have', 'forgotten', 'how', 'love', 'one', 'Meredith', '[', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', ']', 'bitter', 'victim', 'marriage', 'failed', 'reasons', 'ex-husband', 'could', 'prevent', 'adopted', 'hard', 'edge', 'person', 'who', 'love', 'will', 'never', 'work', 'When', 'Roger', '[', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', ']', 'attraction', 'there', 'acquired', 'defense', 'mechanisms', 'make', 'relationship', 'seem', 'doomed', 'When', 'young', 'actress', 'Joan', '[', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', ']', 'Keenan', '[', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', ']', 'hot', 'disco', 'kid', 'Keenan', 'major', 'broken', 'heart', 'Joan', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'Finally', 'Mildred', '[', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', ']', 'must', 'reach', 'out', 'estranged', 'son', 'Mark', '[', 'Jay', 'Mohr', ']', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS.I', 'think', 'Miramax', 'decided', 'call', 'comedy', 'director', 'Willard', 'Carroll', 'delivered', 'sophisticated', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'film', 'devoted', 'subject', 'love', 'having', 'scenes', 'where', 'hankies', 'are', 'required', 'moments', 'dwelling', 'quickly', 'next', 'event', 'find', 'lot', 'humor', 'frustrations', 'self-doubts', 'come', 'love.I', 'had', 'couple', 'problems', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'were', 'fairly', 'minor', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'more', 'commonly', 'associated', 'French', 'Italian', 'movies', 'not', 'one', 'Americans', 'are', 'incapable', 'doing', 'well', 'often', 'here', 'put', 'so', 'many', 'stars', 'vehicle', 'overwhelmed', 'Happily', 'ones', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'are', 'generally', 'excellent', 'actors', 'movie', 'also', 'bit', 'being', 'too', 'well', 'constructed', 'written', 'result', 'several', 'couples', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'fill', 'whole', 'picture', 'own', 'feel', 'bit', 'cheated', 'saw', 'so', 'little', 'little', 'flaws', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'original', 'romantic', 'movies', 'such', 'wide', 'age', 'range', 'love', 'stories', 'one', 'more', 'bound', 'affect', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'young', 'couple', 'Keenan', 'Joan', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'consummate', 'actress', 'may', 'have', 'inspired', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'date']",Playing By Heart VHS

465995,A15ORUD5TVNIV6,6305470464,Mom Pressfour,"[4, 9]","*Playing By Heart* (1998) is the movie that first drew my attention to that extraordinary actress, Angelina Jolie.  Before this, the only Jolie film I had seen was *The Bone Collector*.  My focus then was on Denzel's role and the suspenseful story.  I assumed Ms Jolie (about whom I knew nothing) was just one more young actress fresh off that Hollywood conveyor belt supplying beautiful new co-stars for the A-list male leads in top-budget productions. Later I watched her in *Playing By Heart.*  It was an experience that I'd never had before watching any actress.  Her role as Joan transcends acting.  Let me put it this way: watching her, I forgot I was watching an act. For example, as Ms Jolie speaks her ""dancing about architecture"" lines to the camera, it's Joan seated across the table, talking to me as a good friend.In my review of *Gia* I said Ms Jolie's performance is one of the very best ever put to film.  That's a fact.  But whenever I watch *Gia* I never forget that I'm watching a splendid piece of acting by an amazing talent.  *Playing By Heart* &iacute;s, to me, a date.  A date with a beautiful, eccentric, highly-strung, fast-talking, sympathetic young lady named Joan.  That's why this is my personal number-one favorite Jolie movie.  Not that I'm saying that for objective reasons *Playing By Heart* is better than *Gia*, *Girl Interrupted*, or any other great Jolie film you may name.  It's just that this is one movie that made me a fan.Like Gina in *Love is All There Is* or Lanie in *Life or Something Like It*, Joan is one of those very special Jolie characters that you are going to see in one movie and one movie only.  I like her the best because it seems to me that Angelina really lets us in and shows us the whole person.  There's nothing hidden about Joan.  She's all right there.  It's easy to get to know her, and once you do, you feel you've known her a long time.  She's innocent,  spontaneous, goodhearted, and as fiery as her red hair.  Plus Joan dresses funny.  Tight gold-lame' pants, mauve bra peeking out of her blouse...on a movie date?  What a weird chick.  Joan of *Playing By Heart* is the 180-degree opposite of Claire of *Playing God.*  Claire is cool, elegant, watchful, calculating, a sophisticated cypher.  (Don't get me wrong--I think Claire's great!  Angelina Jolie's range of characterizations is just amazing!)Emotionally, Joan's incredibly needy.  There's a bit too much frantic female energy surging around inside her.  She's so intense in her yearning to be loved that she drives men away.  The result?  Loneliness.  Lately she's had to resort to charmingly desperate little tricks to try to get close to guys she's attracted to.  If you've seen *Playing By Heart* you know one trick she pulled, pretending that her car was stolen. This was to force her date-who-was-not-a-date Keenan (Ryan Phillipe) to walk her to her apartment, where she hoped one thing would lead to another.  ""It didn't work out,"" she later sighed, on the phone to her sister.Though I can't prove it, I believe earlier on she pulled another trick just to meet Keenan the first time.  Years ago I knew a girl who did a similar thing to get a guy's attention and sympathy and to let him know she was available.  It's the trick of pretending you just broke up with a rotten boyfriend.  A girl who'll play a farce like that is hoping it'll make her seem more interesting than the unvarnished truth: she hasn't had a boyfriend for a long time.When we first meet Joan, she's this 20-something club-cat cutie talking on the pay phone in an L.A. danceteria called the Mayan.  Joan's in the loud process of breaking up with ""someone"" she calls Harry.  There's this good-looking but very reserved guy in a queue that's lined up next to the phone area.  That's Keenan, the one with the blue-dyed hair.  Keenan can't help but overhear Joan.  She very distinctly reminds ""Harry"" they've been together four months...""UNTIL YOU CHEATED ON ME WITH THAT SKANK FROM BLOOMINGDALE!""  At this point ""Harry"" apparently hangs up on Joan--just when the moving queue puts Keenan directly next to her. Joan turns and asks Keenan if she can borrow a quarter.  He fishes in his pocket and finds one for her.  Joan shoves the quarter into the slot, punches the keypad, gets ""Harry"" back on the line, and starts arguing with him about how to divide the stuff in the apartment they've been sharing.  Shortly ""Harry"" hangs up again.  Keenan gives her another quarter, his last.  Joan's lucky on this call and quickly achieves closure.  After hanging up she turns to tell to Keenan that the least she can do after taking his last quarter is to get him to buy her a drink.  Next we see them at a table together.Joan's meeting with Keenan seems entirely accidental.  But in fact Joan has had her eye on him for some time.  As they talk over her martini and his Coke, she lets it slip she's seen him around in clubs like the Mayan, where she's noticed he's always dancing alone.  Hmmmm...the reality of this ""Harry"" character becomes even more doubtful when Joan tells Keenan that she and Harry were together for five months.  Keenan reminds her that on the phone she'd said four months.  &Auml;stonished, she smiles and marvels, ""You were paying attention!"" ""The whole club was paying attention,"" Keenan dryly responds. She insists it was five months, then quickly moves on.I don't believe in Harry.  I think Joan was calling her apartment from the pay phone, but in fact there was no Harry nor anybody else to pick up.  The whole show was an act to lure Keenan in.  After all, Joan is an actress.  Moreover she later tells her brother-in-law Hugh (Dennis Quaid) that she's twice done the improvisational acting exercises that he is shown doing in *Playing By Heart.*  We watch Hugh going into bars on different evenings to strike up conversations with complete strangers.  He is supposed to make up a story about himself on the spot and get the person he's speaking with to believe it.  As Hugh does this over ten evenings, he's being observed by a woman who is his improv monitor.  So, again: actress Joan has gone through these same exercises two times.  Which means she is very practiced in meeting people she doesn't know and getting them to believe things about her that aren't true. That's why I don't believe in Harry.*Playing By Heart* is a filmic narrative of five apparently different stories that turn out to be one big story.  So, since there are four other movies-within-the-movie, Jolie's interplay with Phillipe is unfortunately limited.  Many who've seen *Playing By Heart* wish that the whole movie was only about Joan and Keenan.  Many agree that Jolie's performance outshines all the other actors.  And what actors!  Sean Connery, Gena Rowland, Ellen Burstyn, Dennis Quaid, Madeline Stowe, Gillian Anderson, Jon Stewart...Well, like I said, I don't think of Jolie's performance as a performance.  I'm just glad I met Joan.  Who by the way, is nicknamed Jo-jo by her Dad.  Jo-jolie played her way right into my heart.",5,I don't believe in Harry,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,7037,"['*Playing', 'Heart*', '1998', 'movie', 'first', 'drew', 'attention', 'extraordinary',

465996,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6305470464,Mr. Cairene,"[3, 9]","Playing by Heart is the type of film I love to hate. The sub- Woody Allen, sub-Robert Altman schmaltzy ensemble dramas seem to drive me up the wall. Recently I saw the abysmal Miami Rhapsody, and that piece of horse dung was  like a big fat fly on hot day that just won't go away. Playing by Heart is  arguably just as shallow, but between the flagrantly fake sounding dialogue  beautiful moments of truth shine through.The film chronicles several  dueling couples related in one way or another to Sean Connery and Gena  Rowlands who are about to celebrate their 40th wedding aniversary. While  they argue over an affair Connery almost had 25 years ago, their three  daughters Gillian Anderson (cynical, heartbroken), Angelina Jolie(club kid,  romantic) and Madeline Stowe(cheating wife) all try to deal with life and  love in Los Angelos. Out of these storylines the one involving Angelina  Jolie and Ryan Philliepe is the most touching. Their confusion, heartbreak  and affection is so well acted that it makes the rest of the film pale in  comparison. Elsewhere the film is a calculated series of scenes that seem  to be written by a second year Physcology student and sound staright out of  a self-help book, but every once in a while we get a standout scene. Dennis  Quaid's scene in a gay bar where he tries to convince a drag queen that he  is gay just to prove himself a man with &quot;imagination&quot; is  uproarious. A subplot with Ellen Burnstyn and Jay Mohr as her son dying of  Aids doesn't quite work because we don't know these people and watching  such intimate moment is embarrassing rather moving.Infact an indepth  critical analysis of the film will only reveal how shallow it is. And any  further introspection about the film will force me to trash it. Its a  credit to the film that you enjoy it too much to be able to do that.  Although the film was shot by legendarry cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond it  is technically unremarkable. Paradoxically watching the film is quite a  pleasant experience.The film's best scene take place between Jolie  and Phillipe inside one of those new VW Beatles which is a car with an  average engine, average performance and a bloated price. But people  continue to lap it up anyway because its cute and makes them feel good.

He and Angelina Jolie slip into a relationship that is poignant and romantic. I wonder what might have happened next.Why has Jon Stewart never done another romantic role? ... he's engaging, likable, believable as a man who falls in love with a woman who turns out to be one of three daughters whose romantic entanglements, along with those of their parents, form the basis of the plot. He's without artifice, natural, real. It is our loss that Jon Stewart has chosen not to do more acting.A nice little film, as good or better than so many being produced today.

466009,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,6305470464,Sonia,"[17, 19]","If I could meet a lump collective of famous people, a great place to start would be the cast of Playing By Heart.  I don't remember hearing ""boo"" about this movie.  Nada, nuttin, zilch.  Every single character is portrayed by a famous actor.  And quite well I might add, I really enjoyed the depth brought to each performance.Playing By Heart is a relationship movie.  It's also billed as a romantic comedy on the video jacket.  I beg to differ.  It's a drama if I've ever seen one.  Playing By Heart deals with some very complex relationship issues in a direct, honest manner.  The intensity of the relationship formats is engrossing.The movie is set up in a variety of pairings, not all of which are romantically linked.  The relationships that are romantic, represent a wide spectrum of ages, and stages in such a relationship.We meet Hannah (Gena Rowlands) and Paul (Sean Connery).  They've been married forty years.  Their relationship is in a state of flux almost from the very start of the movie.  Their story is evidence that, even after all those years of marriage, there are things to discover about your spouse.  The notion that Paul might still be carrying a torch for an old flame is a bone of contention between he and Hannah.  One example of their combativeness is when Paul remarks, ""It's been almost twenty-four hours since we traded barbs.  We don't want to get rusty do we?""Then there's Joan (Angelina Jolie) and Keenan (Ryan Phillippe).  They are the young, wild twenty-somethings who discover each other in the L.A. club scene.  Keenan is withdrawn and anti-social where Joan is boisterous and the poster child for high drama, her every life event intensely scrutinized for anyone who will listen.  Joan keeps doing her level best to work her way into Keenan's life while he puts forth the same effort pushing her away.  At one point, he finally tells her, ""This isn't anything.  This will never be anything.""  Meredith (Gillian Anderson), on the other hand, pushes men away because of a long history of being burned in relationships, or as she puts it, ""scalded repeatedly"".  She is a theatre director who has been keeping herself consumed with work, but when she pulls a bookshelf down on herself at the library, an architect named Trent uses the opportunity to ask her out on a date.He maintains that, ""I'm not just asking you out to dinner as a preemptive strike against litigation.""  Despite her steadfastness to the contrary, she accepts, saying, ""Anyone who can say preemptive strike against litigation with a straight face deserves a dinner companion.""Theirs becomes a rollercoaster relationship of her pushing him away and him not accepting her attempts to shut him out.  Meredith makes some interesting observations about the dating process that anyone who is dating or has ever dated may find refreshingly honest.  So much of the dating process is calculated artificiality.  She even admits to Trent, that before their first date, she had been on the phone with her sister coming up with a psychological profile for him.Perhaps the most intense relationship in the movie is a mother-son pairing.  Mildred (Ellen Burstyn) is the mother to a gay son, Mark (Jay Mohr).  He is in the hospital dying of, it is assumed, AIDS.  His final wishes are to start their relationship over, being honest with each other and sharing some of their thoughts with each other.  She, and the rest of Mark's family, had been in denial about his being gay, and he doesn't want his last days to be full of her denial about his dying.  Some powerful and moving scenes between them.As a mother with sons, the most moving moment was when he asked her to tell him a story.  He wants to hear the last part of ""Goodnight Moon"".  My boys have this book.  We read it quite often.  The thought of speaking those words to one of them as they lay dying in my arms tore through my heart.  She also reflects on the time she was pregnant with him.  These are instances that all you moms out there will be hard-pressed not to have tears streaming down your cheeks.Among the other characters are Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards), who are both married and having an affair.  There is also Hugh (Dennis Quaid), who spends his nights going from bar to bar, telling tall tales of woe to any woman who will listen to him.  Their relationships are evidence of the understanding one tries to have about what they are doing and why.Why do some people love each other?  How does it happen?  Joan considers something a friend had told her once.  ""Talking about love is like dancing about architecture.""  She maintains that, however true that statement is, she's still going to try to talk about love anyway.  On the flip side, Paul recalls the advice Joan had given their children about falling in love.  ""The wonderful thing about falling in love is you learn everything about that person and so quickly.  And if it's true love, then you start to see yourself through their eyes.  And it brings out the best in you.  It's almost as if you're falling in love with yourself.""Playing By Heart is honest and genuine.  Some of the honesty manifests itself in some big-time swearing and sexual innuendo, hence the ""R"" rating.  It's a drama in the sense that relationships are dramas with light-hearted comedic moments to equal the playing field.  It's about falling in love.  It's about not wanting to fall in love but falling in love anyway.",4,Stellar Cast and Poignant storylines...You'll fall in love,971222400,"10 11, 2000",2000,5439,"['could', 'meet', 'lump',

The subplots seem independent, but come together in the end.  Although her screen time is no more than anyone else in the cast, Ms. Jolie makes the movie.  She plays a young, club-going type girl who starts a relationship with a young man who is HIV positive.  Her acting left a very strong impression on me.  In real life she is the daughter of the actor Jon Voight.  She is only in her mid-twenties and has made 25+ major motion pictures (check out Girl, Interrrupted).  I don't necessarily like her personally, and a woman friend of mine thinks she has had more cosmetic surgery than Frankenstein (check her out in Lara Croft, Tomb Raider).

Thompson ""casual reader""","[1, 1]","This film tracks several couples at various stages of a relationship (2 beginnings, one married, and one long-married) and their figuring out their own emotional entaglements. All the performances are wonderful, particularly Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands as the long-married couple dealing with a painful, recently discovered secret. Their story was my favorite, because there was a simple honesty in how they talked that revealed more about what marriage is than movies like &quot;Forget Paris&quot; and &quot;The Story of Us&quot;. Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillipe rock as two people desparately attracted to eachother, but battling their own insecurities to find one another. I also have to mention Jonathan Stewart and Gillian Anderson. Jonathan Stewart is wonderful in this role, as the guy trying to break Gillian Anderson out of her shell, and Gillian Anderson demonstrates in her role as a controlled, shy woman that there's more to her than just the X-File's Scully.

The problems however, I have with Playing by Heart are that it incorporates too many lives of characters with conficting personalities and lives that are contrasting as  black and white.  You can't figure out who this movie will appeal to.  When  they switch from the younger characters to the geriatrics characters (one  played by Sean Connery), it offsets your mood.  You are just getting into  one plot and Bam! switch-a-roo! It was frustrating.  I also thought they  could have eliminated Jay Moer's character (who was dying of a.i.d.s).  That is so depressing!  How are we going to be entertained by that!?!  Yes  it was quite sad and it did make me want to cry, but hey, that doesn't  belong in this movie! One of my favorite scenes is where Dennis Quaid's  character goes into the gay club and talks to a transvestite.  I found that  to be a touching, surreal momement.  I also loved Angelina Jolie's  character. She was intriguing and brought some life to the film. (check her  out in &quot;Gia&quot;!).

Like _Pulp Fiction_, this film draws you into its narrative by having multiple  storylines going at once, only to be intersected in the end.  Along the  way, each individual story is so intriguing that it's almost easy to forget  that they're all moving inexorably towards collision in a masterful  denouement that amplifies each individual story at least as much as it  neatly ties all of them together.What sustains us throughout is the high  calibre of writing.  This is masterful dialogue, by and large, and it's  more than a little joyous to see it so well acted.  Angelina Jolie and Jon  Stewart, in particular, add comedy simply by the way the read their lines.  Other actors would've gotten laughs because the lines were well written;  Jolie and Stewart go the writer one better by giving especially deft  readings.I think what intrigues us, too, is the casting.  Almost  everyone is in some significant way cast at least slightly against type,  and watching them perform in unusual circumstance-and do it very well-makes  the experience mesmerizing.But what really sells this film is the fact  that it's perfect date material.  The movie is entirely about love, without  being sappy or obviously formulaic.  Though many of the negative  consequences of love are explored, none is so overwhelming as to be  oppressive.
