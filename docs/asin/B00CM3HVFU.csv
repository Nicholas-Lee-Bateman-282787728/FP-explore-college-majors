Unlike other Christian films, this movie is not preachy or tacky.  While it does praise virtue, the message it's trying to share is the insecurity of today's subway systems.  Red Line is about a terrorist attack on a subway that blasts apart a train taking many lives in the explosion and impact.  The survivors are left to fend for themselves and doubt each other's intentions when they realize that the bomber is among them.  I'd say more but I don't want to spoil anything.  This is a movie you have to experience for yourself.",5,I enjoyed my ride on the Red Line,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,659,"['most', 'Christian', 'films', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'show', 'Red', 'Line', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'actors', 'quite', 'thrill', 'ride', 'other', 'Christian', 'films', 'movie', 'not', 'preachy', 'tacky', 'praise', 'virtue', 'message', 'trying', 'share', 'insecurity', 'today', 'subway', 'systems', 'Red', 'Line', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'subway', 'apart', 'train', 'taking', 'many', 'lives', 'explosion', 'impact', 'survivors', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'doubt', 'other', 'intentions', 'when', 'realize', 'bomber', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'movie', 'have', 'experience']",Redline

Acting was above par across the board. The lead actress was young and beautiful besides being a good actress. The villain was dastardly. The other actors did a good job. The movie ended up being as much a character study as an action film, with a strong look at stereotyping.My negatives: There never was an explanation of the bombing.

1648770,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00CM3HVFU,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","A bomb goes off in an LA subway, and the survivors try to keep it together, care for the injured, and find a way out, all the while wondering who--if any--amongst them is the terrorist.For a very low budget film that some college students and faculty made as a project--something I didn't realize until after I'd seen it--REDLINE is quite good. All the same, the acting by just about everyone is dry-tepid, and most of the lines sound read rather than said. Plot-wise, it pretty much follows the formula, with the sort of twists that are meant to be surprising but are well-trodden to the point of being quite predictable. Who/who doesn't survive is another predictable factor.The notes at the beginning of the film cite some statistics about domestic terrorism that seem to promise the film will have a broader scope than it actually does. Partly by necessity, I suppose, the view is quite limited and claustrophobic. Some brief shots of the outside world--rescue efforts, news flashes, etc--during the course of the film would have been a big plus, but I can see how they didn't have the resources for that. More solid clues as to the motivations of the culprit would also have helped.Oh, well. REDLINE is a decent thriller if you like this sort of thing and aren't too demanding.",3,"""We're all suspects""",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1282,"['bomb', 'off', 'LA', 'subway', 'survivors', 'try', 'keep', 'together', 'care', 'injured', 'find', 'way', 'while', 'wondering', 'who', 'amongst', 'terrorist.For', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'college', 'students', 'faculty', 'made', 'project', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'d"", 'seen', 'REDLINE', 'quite', 'good', 'same', 'acting', 'just', 'everyone', 'dry-tepid', 'most', 'lines', 'sound', 'read', 'rather', 'said', 'Plot-wise', 'pretty', 'much', 'formula', 'sort', 'twists', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'surprising', 'are', 'well-trodden', 'point', 'being', 'quite', 'predictable', 'Who/who', ""n't"", 'survive', 'predictable', 'factor.The', 'notes', 'beginning', 'film', 'cite', 'statistics', 'domestic', 'terrorism', 'seem', 'promise', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'broader', 'scope', 'actually', 'Partly', 'necessity', 'suppose', 'view', 'quite', 'limited', 'claustrophobic', 'brief', 'shots', 'outside', 'world', 'rescue', 'efforts', 'news', 'flashes', 'etc', 'course', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'plus', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'resources', 'More', 'solid', 'clues', 'motivations', 'culprit', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'helped.Oh', 'well', 'REDLINE', 'decent', 'thriller', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'demanding']",Redline
1648771,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B00CM3HVFU,"Greg ""Saganite""","[2, 4]","""Red Line,"" according to the bonus ""making of"" feature and online sources, is the collaboration of professional filmmakers and ""Catholic college students from San Diego's tiny John Paul the Great University.""  They did a good job; it's an entirely professional-looking production with a tight script, above-average genre-movie acting, and moments of taut suspense.  Nicole Gale Anderson and John Billingsley do highly creditable work in the key leads, and the movie touches on issues of terrorism, torture, regret, courage, and...virtue.  Back to that in a second.Where I found the movie weak was in the motivation of the bomber.  To say more would be to spoil some cool twists, but suffice to say that for a plan that heinous, a more specific kind of motivation seems necessary.  The movie doesn't have to stop while the baddie reads a manifesto, but I need to have some basic level of understanding why people do what they do, in order to care about what they're doing fully.  There was a nod in that direction, but it was anemic.And back to ""virtue"": While it was never heavy-handed, at some point in the movie, I realized that there was a faintly religious agenda at work.  Nothing preachy, nothing manipulative.  In some ways, this is refreshing--and there is much in Catholicism at its best that is completely compatible with my own humanistic leanings (give or take contraception and a few other issues).  But it was not seamless, and it lead to a last scene, last line, that was an unnecessary groaner, and felt to me tacked on just to give it a sort of religious imprimatur.  It hardly detracted from the overall success of the storytelling and production.  But it was not needed and felt forced.",3,Pleasantly competent and suspenseful.,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,1705,"['Red', 'Line', 'according', 'bonus', 'making', 'feature', 'online', 'sources', 'collaboration', 'professional', 'filmmakers', 'Catholic', 'college', 'students', 'San', 'Diego', 'tiny', 'John', 'Paul', 'Great', 'University', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'entirely', 'professional-looking', 'production', 'tight', 'script', 'above-average', 'genre-movie', 'acting', 'moments', 'taut', 'suspense', 'Nicole', 'Gale', 'Anderson', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'do', 'highly', 'creditable', 'work', 'key', 'leads', 'movie', 'touches', 'issues', 'terrorism', 'torture', 'regret', 'courage', 'virtue', 'Back', 'second.Where', 'found', 'movie', 'weak', 'was', 'motivation', 'bomber', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'spoil', 'cool', 'twists', 'suffice', 'say', 'plan', 'heinous', 'more', 'specific', 'kind', 'motivation', 'necessary', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'stop', 'baddie', 'manifesto', 'need', 'have', 'basic', 'level', 'understanding', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'order', 'care', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'fully', 'was', 'nod', 'direction', 'was', 'anemic.And', 'back', 'virtue', 'was', 'never', 'heavy-handed', 'point', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', 'faintly', 'religious', 'agenda', 'work', 'Nothing', 'preachy', 'nothing', 'manipulative', 'ways', 'refreshing', 'much', 'Catholicism', 'best', 'completely', 'compatible', 'own', 'humanistic', 'leanings', 'give', 'take', 'contraception', 'few', 'other', 'issues', 'was', 'not', 'seamless', 'lead', 'last', 'scene', 'last', 'line', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'groaner', 'felt', 'tacked', 'just', 'give', 'sort', 'religious', 'imprimatur', 'hardly', 'detracted', 'overall', 'success', 'storytelling', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'needed', 'felt', 'forced']",Redline
