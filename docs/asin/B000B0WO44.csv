935632,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000B0WO44,Jeffery Mingo,"[9, 38]","This documentary effectively shows how Corporate America can manipulate teens, or at least squeeze their wallets dry.  It does show how greedy and pervasive late capitalism can be.  It shows the illogic of the market:  things lose their coolness the more people know about it.  It raises issues of which modern American parents should be concerned.However, this still seemed like ageist youth-bashing.  Youth buy leisure items, but their parents did too two to four decades ago.  My parents bought James Brown records as fanatically as I buy Pet Shop Boys CDs.  (Oops!  I'm dating myself.)  Youth have and emit conflicting images around sexuality.  However, so did their parents.  Whether it's Woodstock, ""Grease,"" or Studio 54, young people have consistently been sexual or provocative.  This film seems to suggest that teens are just hyper-consumptive idiots, but I highly doubt adults are any different.  If a teen girl wants to show off her midriff, her mother is saving up for Botox injections.  Young boys like to gross-out gags, but their fathers pursue get-rich-quick schemes and pay ridiculous amounts of money to prevent their balding.  Middle-aged Americans are the dupe to the boardroom just as much as their children.  Thus, the documentary seemed to rag on youth and let adults off the hook.  I've never seen a documentary so unsupportive of its subject matter.",2,An Unfair Trashing of Young Folk,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,1375,"['documentary', 'effectively', 'how', 'Corporate', 'America', 'can', 'manipulate', 'teens', 'least', 'squeeze', 'wallets', 'dry', 'show', 'how', 'greedy', 'pervasive', 'late', 'capitalism', 'can', 'be', 'illogic', 'market', 'things', 'lose', 'coolness', 'more', 'people', 'know', 'issues', 'modern', 'American', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'concerned.However', 'still', 'seemed', 'ageist', 'youth-bashing', 'Youth', 'buy', 'leisure', 'items', 'parents', 'did', 'too', 'two', 'four', 'decades', 'ago', 'parents', 'bought', 'James', 'Brown', 'records', 'as', 'fanatically', 'buy', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'CDs', ""'m"", 'dating', 'Youth', 'have', 'emit', 'conflicting', 'images', 'sexuality', 'However', 'so', 'did', 'parents', 'Woodstock', 'Grease', 'Studio', '54', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'consistently', 'been', 'sexual', 'provocative', 'film', 'suggest', 'teens', 'are', 'just', 'hyper-consumptive', 'idiots', 'highly', 'doubt', 'adults', 'are', 'different', 'teen', 'girl', 'show', 'off', 'midriff', 'mother', 'saving', 'up', 'Botox', 'injections', 'Young', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'fathers', 'pursue', 'get-rich-quick', 'schemes', 'pay', 'ridiculous', 'amounts', 'money', 'prevent', 'balding', 'Middle-aged', 'Americans', 'are', 'dupe', 'boardroom', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'children', 'Thus', 'documentary', 'seemed', 'rag', 'youth', 'let', 'adults', 'hook', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'documentary', 'so', 'unsupportive', 'subject', 'matter']",Frontline: The Merchants of Cool

I found it downright chilling and I watched it again right before I wrote this review.This documentary isn't about bashing teens.  It's about exposing a very small number of huge media corporate conglomerates (just seeing who ownes who is fascinating) who work around the clock to determine the next ""cool"" trend among teens.  They study the teens who are on the cutting edge to determine what the next cool thing is and then they package whatever it is and mass market it to the general teen audience.  Of course, once whatever-it-is goes mainstream, it isn't cool anymore.They also study the strictly average teen, not the super gifted or the overachievers, to determine how to reach this population with their marketing.  Teens then conform to what they've been sold.  They buy products with money often given to them by their parents.  The media moguls pocket the money, and then try to figure out the next ""cool"" thing, and the never ending cycle continues.I could go on, but I can't really do justice to what is my favorite episode of Frontline.  I've leant my copy to several friends and they've all been enlightened to things that they never suspected were happening.  Truth is often stranger than fiction.  This might have been sci-fi fifty years ago.The take home lesson to me is that being cool sucks.  It sucks your brain out of your head and your money out of your wallet.  This is true particularly if you're trying to buy coolness.  It's best to be who you are and let others decide how cool that is.If you are a parent of teens, pull the TV cable out of the wall and stop giving teens money.  Make them earn it.Finally, be sure to get the movie ""Josie and the Pussycats"" to see the same subject dealt with in a fun and satirical way.",5,Show this to any teenager you can.,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,1886,"['are', 'parent', 'teenager', 'teacher', 'youth', 'minister', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'teens', 'somehow', 'get', 'watch', 'found', 'downright', 'chilling', 'watched', 'again', 'right', 'wrote', 'review.This', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'bashing', 'teens', 'exposing', 'very', 'small', 'number', 'huge', 'media', 'corporate', 'conglomerates', 'just', 'seeing', 'who', 'ownes', 'who', 'fascinating', 'who', 'work', 'clock', 'determine', 'next', 'cool', 'trend', 'teens', 'study', 'teens', 'who', 'are', 'cutting', 'edge', 'determine', 'what', 'next', 'cool', 'thing', 'then', 'package', 'whatever', 'mass', 'market', 'general', 'teen', 'audience', 'course', 'once', 'whatever-it-is', 'mainstream', ""n't"", 'cool', 'anymore.They', 'also', 'study', 'strictly', 'average', 'teen', 'not', 'super', 'gifted', 'overachievers', 'determine', 'how', 'reach', 'population', 'marketing', 'then', 'conform', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sold', 'buy', 'products', 'money', 'often', 'given', 'parents', 'media', 'moguls', 'pocket', 'money', 'then', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'next', 'cool', 'thing', 'never', 'ending', 'cycle', 'continues.I', 'could', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'what', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Frontline', ""'ve"", 'leant', 'copy', 'several', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enlightened', 'things', 'never', 'suspected', 'were', 'happening', 'Truth', 'often', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'sci-fi', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago.The', 'take', 'home', 'lesson', 'being', 'cool', 'sucks', 'brain', 'head', 'money', 'wallet', 'true', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'trying', 'buy', 'coolness', 'best', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'let', 'others', 'decide', 'how', 'cool', 'is.If', 'are', 'parent', 'teens', 'pull', 'TV', 'cable', 'wall', 'stop', 'giving', 'teens', 'money', 'Make', 'earn', 'it.Finally', 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'movie', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'see', 'same', 'subject', 'dealt', 'fun', 'satirical', 'way']",Frontline: The Merchants of Cool

Enright,"[17, 18]","This film exposes some of the marketing techniques used on young people.I'm glad to read that another reviewer shows it to his students each year.Another teacher who showed it to her class was less impressed with the response it received from some students who thought it was dated.  There are some more recent documentaries on this issue from the Media Education Foundation, but this Frontline presentation is a good place to start.I learned in the filmThe Corporationthat some psychologists hired by the corporate world work to achieve a high ""nag factor,"" that is an intense pressuring from kids on parents to purchase particular items for them.  The techniques are many, and are constantly used on adults as well.  Another related field to marketing is public relations.  PR's founder, Edward Bernays, wrote a book calledPropaganda,that was utilized by Joseph Goebbels during the rise of fascism.  Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, boasted that ""If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing it.""To counter all of this propaganda, I'd suggest the following resources:Adbusters - Adbusters also offers items for teachers to use in the classroom.Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and FeelSo Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their KidsNew Moon: the Magazine for Girls & Their Dreams This commercial free magazine written by and for girls, includes a lot of insightful comments on media manipulation from the girls.Teen Voices  This magazine is for young women.Hopefully there will someday be magazines that aren't manipulating boys and young men in the service of corporate interests.Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the MediaThis documentary has become something of a movement, inspiring a new level of media criticism and countless efforts to create grassroots media.Chomsky's work has been a big influence on Amy Goodman of the independent news hour, ""Democracy Now!.""Standing Up to the Madness: Ordinary Heroes in Extraordinary Times",5,Marketing to kids.,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,2133,"['film', 'marketing', 'techniques', 'used', 'young', 'people.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'read', 'reviewer', 'students', 'year.Another', 'teacher', 'who', 'showed', 'class', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'response', 'received', 'students', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'dated', 'are', 'more', 'recent', 'documentaries', 'issue', 'Media', 'Education', 'Foundation', 'Frontline', 'presentation', 'good', 'place', 'start.I', 'learned', 'filmThe', 'Corporationthat', 'psychologists', 'hired', 'corporate', 'world', 'work', 'achieve', 'high', 'nag', 'factor', 'intense', 'pressuring', 'kids', 'parents', 'purchase', 'particular', 'items', 'techniques', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'constantly', 'used', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'related', 'field', 'marketing', 'public', 'relations', 'PR', 'founder', 'Edward', 'Bernays', 'wrote', 'book', 'calledPropaganda', 'was', 'utilized', 'Joseph', 'Goebbels', 'rise', 'fascism', 'Bernays', 'nephew', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'boasted', 'understand', 'mechanism', 'motives', 'group', 'mind', 'now', 'possible', 'control', 'regiment', 'masses', 'according', 'will', 'knowing', 'counter', 'propaganda', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'following', 'resources', 'Adbusters', 'Adbusters', 'also', 'items', 'teachers', 'use', 'classroom.Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'My', 'Love', 'How', 'Advertising', 'Way', 'Think', 'FeelSo', 'Sexy', 'So', 'Soon', 'New', 'Sexualized', 'Childhood', 'What', 'Parents', 'Can', 'Do', 'Protect', 'Their', 'KidsNew', 'Moon', 'Magazine', 'Girls', 'Their', 'Dreams', 'commercial', 'free', 'magazine', 'written', 'girls', 'lot', 'insightful', 'comments', 'media', 'manipulation', 'girls.Teen', 'Voices', 'magazine', 'young', 'women.Hopefully', 'will', 'someday', 'be', 'magazines', 'are', ""n't"", 'manipulating', 'boys', 'young', 'men', 'service', 'corporate', 'interests.Manufacturing', 'Consent', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'MediaThis', 'documentary', 'become', 'something', 'movement', 'inspiring', 'new', 'level', 'media', 'criticism', 'countless', 'efforts', 'create', 'grassroots', 'work', 'been', 'big', 'influence', 'Amy', 'Goodman', 'independent', 'news', 'hour', 'Democracy', 'Now', 'Standing', 'Up', 'Madness', 'Ordinary', 'Heroes', 'Extraordinary', 'Times']",Frontline: The Merchants of Cool
