My 2 1/2 year old (great)nephew (he's now 3) had this with him early this summer when he came with his family one day to visit me, and I watched it with him.  I have found ""kiddie"" videos annoying and trite, but this one is very clever.  Of particular interest to and approval from me is the use of Classical music, although played on glockenspiels and electronic synthesizers (not the original instruments the music was written for) is excellent, in exposing young children to music of substance and quality while going with a story line about domestic animals.  Music of Beethoven, Rimsky-Korsakov and Domenico Scarlatti are represented, as well as other composers I cannot recall at the moment.The scene shifts frequently: appropriate for a young child.  The music serves the visuals, and is effective.  If I was a parent, I would consider this over the violent cartoons and other low quality videos available for children these days. I am not surprised that my niece and her husband have carefully chosen this for their son's (my great nephew) viewing, as they are very conscienscious parents.",5,A cute DVD for young children,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,1206,"['am', 'not', 'parent', 'do', 'not', 'confess', 'know', 'anything', 'raising', 'children', 'have', 'seen', 'video', '2', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'great', 'nephew', 'now', '3', 'had', 'early', 'summer', 'when', 'came', 'family', 'one', 'day', 'visit', 'watched', 'have', 'found', 'kiddie', 'videos', 'annoying', 'trite', 'one', 'very', 'clever', 'particular', 'interest', 'approval', 'use', 'Classical', 'music', 'played', 'glockenspiels', 'electronic', 'synthesizers', 'not', 'original', 'instruments', 'music', 'was', 'written', 'excellent', 'exposing', 'young', 'children', 'music', 'substance', 'quality', 'going', 'story', 'line', 'domestic', 'animals', 'Music', 'Beethoven', 'Rimsky-Korsakov', 'Domenico', 'Scarlatti', 'are', 'represented', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'composers', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'moment.The', 'scene', 'shifts', 'frequently', 'appropriate', 'young', 'child', 'music', 'visuals', 'effective', 'was', 'parent', 'would', 'consider', 'violent', 'cartoons', 'other', 'low', 'quality', 'videos', 'available', 'children', 'days', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'niece', 'husband', 'have', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'son', 'great', 'nephew', 'viewing', 'are', 'very', 'conscienscious', 'parents']",Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals VHS

He has recently become interested in this one after ignoring it for a few months.I have to mark this one down a little, as it is not as well put together as earlier ones like Baby Mozart and Baby van Gogh.The footage of the animals is excellent, and very educational in helping children learn to identify neighbourhood animals as well as other animals.  (I have cows and horses, but no otters in my neighbourhood.)  The sequences with the swan and ducks in water are outstanding.I didn't like the beginning with the cow with wings, even though it was a cute puppet.  My son asked me what it was, and why the cow had wings, and is now on the lookout for flying pink cows.He identifies with the naughty mice who throw food around, and advises the mommy mouse to give them a time-out.The Pavlov puppet skits between animals are too long and monotonous, and the little skits with the other puppets are sometimes confusing, like when the frog is barking, and then quacks, which makes the duck bark instead of quack.

Let me tell you, when I turned it on, I could not believe that such crap can have great reviews of 4.5 stars and I still don't understand why everyone raves about these.  It looks like someone high on something made this DVD with whatever they had near them, such as toys on strings, cheap plastic toys, then some real images of animals and a few shots of babies. I did not find the bug section of this DVD very appealing, maybe because I can't stand bugs of any kind. My baby (9.5 month girl) did not show any interest in this DVD at all, except for a minute when they were signing Old McDonald had a farm, a tune she recognized. We have not exposed her to TV all that much and perhaps she is not used to it, but from a parent's perspective, I did not find the DVD engaging at all. On another hand, a Classical Baby collection of DVD from HBO, I found sooo much better.  They had animation throughout and classical music on the background. If you live in NYC like I do, I suggest renting these from the library first (Queens public library has a huge selection of Baby Einstein and Classical baby dvds) just to make sure your baby like it.  I guess for those babies who have been exposed to TV since 3 months, they will watch anything on TV and maybe that's why they beg for these DVDs as someone wrote to be played for them. I am sorry if my post offends anyone whose baby loves this, but I am just sharing my experience and opinion.

I peronally was tired of the Baby Beethoven and Mozart, so I tried this one at 6 months. Too young....However, I tried again at 9 months and it works like a charm. She lays down on her boppy with a bottle and blanket for about 15 minutes while watching Neighborhood Animals and falls asleep. If it wasn't for this DVD, I would be rocking, walking, and driving her to sleep each time.

Even though it is recommended for ages 1 yr and up, she started paying attention and enjoying it at 4 mos.  I think babies just automatically get a kick out of watching animals more than  watching scenery.  Her favorite parts are the dogs, bugs and the ""animals at the farm"" portion when they sing ""Old McDonald"".  Some of the puppet skits crack her up.  When she is older I look forward to using the animal flashcard feature, where you can use your remote control to first show the photo of the animal, then when you want you can make the word pop up and a child says the name of the animal.",5,Best of the Baby Einstein DVDs,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,710,"['daughter', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'DVD', 'four', 'watched', 'one', 'favorite', 'far', 'Even', 'recommended', 'ages', '1', 'yr', 'up', 'started', 'paying', 'attention', 'enjoying', '4', 'mos', 'think', 'babies', 'just', 'automatically', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'animals', 'more', 'watching', 'scenery', 'favorite', 'parts', 'are', 'dogs', 'bugs', 'animals', 'farm', 'portion', 'when', 'sing', 'Old', 'McDonald', 'puppet', 'crack', 'up', 'When', 'older', 'look', 'forward', 'using', 'animal', 'flashcard', 'feature', 'where', 'can', 'use', 'remote', 'control', 'first', 'show', 'photo', 'animal', 'then', 'when', 'want', 'can', 'make', 'word', 'up', 'child', 'name', 'animal']",Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals VHS
