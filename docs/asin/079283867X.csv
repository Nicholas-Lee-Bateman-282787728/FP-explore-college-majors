Gaster,"[0, 6]","When I see a minute used in a movie to show a car pulling up to a house, shutting off the motor, two actors getting out and walking up to the front door and unlocking the door and going inside, I'm pretty sure the movie is short on plot and needs filler to make it movie length. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! I've always thought Tom Berringer didn't make it to real stardom because he could not act very well--his emotions in this movie go from occasonally raising his eyebrows to occasionally smiling. But then again, no one else in the movie shows any real feeling either. Maybe these actors would have made it big in melo-drama back in the 1890's. Maybe that was the 1980's style. At any rate, this movie is just going through the motions much lie a tv movie-of-the-week from the era.

I've seen it dozens of times since then and have worn out two VHS copies. That's why I was delighted to learn that it was finally being released on DVD, which meant, obviously, a few extras and surprises that the format affords (widescreen, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes, etc.) Boy, was I disappointed. First and foremost, it is NOT in the widescreen format, despite what the packaging says. I repeat, THIS IS NOT IN THE WIDESCREEN FORMAT. This is the pan and scan, or full-screen version, with black bars superimposed over it. I ran the DVD simultaneously with the VHS version, freezing frames and comparing. Call me obsessive, but I had to make sure. It was so obvious. Things at the top and bottom of the screen on the VHS version were covered by the bars on the DVD, while the sides of the screen yielded very little extra, if anything, on this so-called widescreen version. As far as the picture itself, the DVD does produce a better quality of this movie than I've ever seen before. However, that's the only plus. Since it is not in widescreen, the only extra is one theatrical trailer. No wonder MGM is selling this at below cost. A disgrace and a scam.

Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","Released in 1983, EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS received generally poor reviews and was pulled from theatrical distribution after a few weeks.  That would have probably been the end--but HBO picked up the film as filler, and audiences suddenly discovered it.  To this day it is far from a critical darling, and certainly the film is flawed and artistically reckless, but even so it manages to tap into a nostalgia for the early 1960s, when the world still seemed innocent on the surface but increasingly dark underneath.The plot concerns an early 1960s band which had popular success with their first album but self-destructed on their second, with the lead singer and star (Michael Par&eacute;) dead in a car accident before the second could be released.  Now in 1983 the surviving band members are very startled to find find their old recordings top of the charts in a sudden nostalgia craze--and they are not necessarily happy about it.  Lyricist Frank (Tom Berenger) is particularly reluctant to be drawn into a television documentary about the band; nonetheless, he begins to look up his old band mates.  What he discovers in the process is the deception of memory, a good deal of personal pain, and the fact that the tapes for the second album have gone missing.  The home of each of the band members has been ransacked: clearly, now that the band is hot once more, someone wants those tapes, which would be very valuable in the wake of renewed interest in the band.The film flashes back and forth between the bands glory days of the early 1960s and the disillusionment of the remaining band members as they exist in the early 1980s.  Doc has become a DJ; Sal is working an ""oldie but goodies"" lounge act; Kenny, perhaps the best adjusted, is dealing blackjack in Atlantic City and has no illusions about the past.  And then there is Joanne (Helen Schneider), Eddie's girl and a back up singer in the band.  Not only has her house been ransacked, somebody has been stalking her, somebody who drives what looks like Eddie's old car, who knows details of their romance.  Is it Eddie?  Is he still alive?Much about the film is sloppy.  The script is predictable; the music, although beautifully performed by John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, is about as far from 1963 as one can get; and the whole notion of French poet Arthur Rimbaud being an influence on the band (a notion lifted from Jim Morrison) and the question of whether or not Eddie is dead or alive (lifed from no less than Elvis Presley) don't mesh well with the overall plot.  But weirdly, impossibly, the damn thing works.This is largely due to the chemistry between the actors: their lines might be mundane, but they play them out with memorable sincerity, with the chemistry between Eddie, Joanne, and Frank particularly memorable; Sal (Matthew Laurance) is also a standout.  A great film?  No.  A memorable one, in spite of its excessive simplicity?  Absolutely.  And when the band lines up for songs like ""Wild Summer Night"" and ""Tender Years,"" it really is something special.  This is the past not as it was, but as we wish it was, a nostalgia for a nostaligia that never existed--but which is touching and beautiful just the same.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Nostalgia From Nostalgia: The Past As We Wish It Was,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,3223,"['Released', '1983', 'EDDIE', 'AND', 'THE', 'CRUISERS', 'received', 'generally', 'poor', 'reviews', 'was', 'pulled', 'theatrical', 'distribution', 'few', 'weeks', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'end', 'HBO', 'picked', 'up', 'film', 'filler', 'audiences', 'suddenly', 'discovered', 'day', 'far', 'critical', 'darling', 'certainly', 'film', 'flawed', 'artistically', 'reckless', 'even', 'tap', 'nostalgia', 'early', '1960s', 'when', 'world', 'still', 'seemed', 'innocent', 'surface', 'increasingly', 'dark', 'underneath.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'early', '1960s', 'band', 'had', 'popular', 'success', 'first', 'album', 'self-destructed', 'second', 'lead', 'singer', 'star', 'Michael', 'Par', 'eacute', 'dead', 'car', 'accident', 'second', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'Now', '1983', 'surviving', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'very', 'startled', 'find', 'find', 'old', 'recordings', 'top', 'charts', 'sudden', 'nostalgia', 'craze', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'happy', 'Lyricist', 'Frank', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'particularly', 'reluctant', 'be', 'drawn', 'television', 'documentary', 'band', 'nonetheless', 'look', 'up', 'old', 'band', 'What', 'process', 'deception', 'memory', 'good', 'deal', 'personal', 'pain', 'fact', 'tapes', 'second', 'album', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'home', 'band', 'members', 'been', 'ransacked', 'clearly', 'now', 'band', 'hot', 'once', 'more', 'someone', 'tapes', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'valuable', 'wake', 'renewed', 'interest', 'band.The', 'film', 'flashes', 'back', 'forth', 'bands', 'glory', 'days', 'early', '1960s', 'disillusionment', 'remaining', 'band', 'members', 'exist', 'early', '1980s', 'Doc', 'become', 'DJ', 'Sal', 'working', 'oldie', 'goodies', 'lounge', 'act', 'Kenny', 'perhaps', 'best', 'adjusted', 'dealing', 'blackjack', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'illusions', 'past', 'then', 'Joanne', 'Helen', 'Schneider', 'Eddie', 'girl', 'back', 'up', 'singer', 'band', 'Not', 'only', 'house', 'been', 'ransacked', 'somebody', 'been', 'stalking', 'somebody', 'who', 'what', 'Eddie', 'old', 'car', 'who', 'details', 'romance', 'Eddie', 'still', 'alive', 'Much', 'film', 'sloppy', 'script', 'predictable', 'music', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'John', 'Cafferty', 'Beaver', 'Brown', 'Band', 'far', '1963', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'whole', 'notion', 'French', 'poet', 'Arthur', 'Rimbaud', 'being', 'influence', 'band', 'notion', 'lifted', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'question', 'not', 'Eddie', 'dead', 'alive', 'lifed', 'less', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'overall', 'plot', 'weirdly', 'impossibly', 'damn', 'thing', 'works.This', 'largely', 'due', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'lines', 'might', 'be', 'mundane', 'play', 'out', 'memorable', 'sincerity', 'chemistry', 'Eddie', 'Joanne', 'Frank', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'Sal', 'Matthew', 'Laurance', 'also', 'standout', 'great', 'film', 'No', 'memorable', 'one', 'spite', 'excessive', 'simplicity', 'Absolutely', 'when', 'band', 'lines', 'up', 'songs', 'Wild', 'Summer', 'Night', 'Tender', 'Years', 'really', 'something', 'special', 'past', 'not', 'was', 'wish', 'was', 'nostalgia', 'nostaligia', 'never', 'existed', 'touching', 'beautiful', 'just', 'same.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

I love this movie, very very much. It was first released in 82, but no one went to see it. I was going to see it then, but a family emergency kept me from seeing it before it vanished from the theaters. In 1984, HBO, then relatively new, played the movie four times a day. Suddenly, it was the biggest movie in America. Songs from the movie made it to the radio becoming hits, in a weird life imitating art way. I was so inspired that I went to the library to see if such a group ever existed. Of course it didn't, but I did find the novel from which the movie came. The book goes well with the movie and does more character development than the movie does. This is an excellent movie that the entire family can watch. Watch for excellent performances by the previously mentioned Ellen Barkin, as well as Tom Beringer and Joey Pantioliano (Sopranos).

141389,A3N0AXNEZVE686,079283867X,Hound Dog,"[3, 3]","Released in 1983, this entertaining film adaptation of P.F. Kluge's novel about a mysterious, early 1960's rock `n' roller who died before his time was initially a forgotten box office failure. Soon resurrected by cable television into a cult phenomenon, one can still hear the movie's trademark song, John Cafferty's ""On the Dark Side,"" regularly on classic rock radio stations.  All in all, this is a low-budget gem well worth rediscovery nearly thirty years after its original release.Much like the novel, the fragmented storyline revolves around former Cruisers piano player-songwriter, Frank Ridgeway (Tom Berenger), and how he gets dragged back into his former life in an increasingly desperate search for the Cruisers' long-lost second (and unreleased) album, ""A Season in Hell.""  Through vivid use of flashbacks reflecting a presumably authentic view of the Cruisers in 1962-1964, one meets bass player Sal Amato (Matthew Laurence), back-up singer Joann Carlino (Helen Schneider), drummer Kenny Hopkins (David Wilson), saxophonist Wendell Newton (Cafferty's own saxophonist, Michael Antunes), and conniving manager ""Doc"" Robbins (Joe Pantoliano), both in the past and in their present lives (except for the long-dead Wendell).The film production team wisely tweaked a number of elements from Kluge's book, but the satisfying end result is fortunately the same: poignant drama deftly blended with nostalgia-flavored music into a haunting, frequently mesmerizing rock `n' roll fable.  Michael Pare steals the show as enigmatic rocker Eddie Wilson, whose ambitions and talents are overshadowed by self-doubt, by leaving the audience wanting to know more (as it should be).  Still, the film sometimes relies too much on inference by not showing enough of the bond between Eddie and best friend Wendell (and why Wendell's tragic death devastates Eddie), and, even more so, how tortured poet Arthur Rimbaud's works gradually consume Eddie to his self-destructive end.  Hence, just a few extra minutes (i.e. a scene of Eddie reading or quoting Rimbaud while walking on the beach with Joann and/or Frank) added to the film's running time would have helped.Effectively using flashback sequences, the ensemble cast is excellent in the past scenes and more than sufficient in the present-day scenes.  Tom Berenger is exceptional as protagonist Frank Ridgeway, and his poignant reunion with Joann Carlino (Helen Schneider) after nearly twenty years is well-staged.  Even more so, the pivotal scenes (in the past and present) at ""Palace Depression"" could have easily sunk the film with a single misstep (i.e. stretching implausibility way too far), but Berenger, Schneider, and especially Pare transform them into quite possibly the film's best extended sequence.  The other cast members, including Ellen Barkin as the journalist who helps ignite the search for the ""lost"" album, also give solid performances that easily outweigh the script's minor discrepancies (which really aren't worth mentioning).Above all, the film owes the most credit to John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band for perhaps one of the best (and definitely underrated) soundtracks of all time.  Cafferty's distinctively deep and raspy voice defines Eddie Wilson as much as actor Michael Pare (whose lip-synching is dead-on) does.  The illusion Cafferty and Pare jointly create is nothing short of superb.  My favorite scene is at the end where one finally hears haunting echoes of ""A Season in Hell"" voicing over the Is-Eddie-Dead-or-Alive? mystery's solution.  It is a memorable, classy finale to a daring, original ensemble piece that should continue to gracefully age for several more generations to come.Rating: 8.5/10 (As I said, a few more flashback scenes foreshadowing the Cruisers' inevitable disbanding would have bolstered the storyline).P.S. I highly recommend purchasing a copy of the novel (finally in print again after several years) to grasp the additional depth that author P.F. Kluge plugs into these characters while discovering the obvious differences from the film.  Case in point: the literary Eddie is instead fascinated by poet Walt Whitman's seminal work, ""Leaves of Grass.""  Give the film production team major kudos, though, for realizing that Rimbaud was a better artistic inspiration than Whitman for the movie (not to mention, the soundtrack).",4,"Let's Get on With the Music!

It would seem that the general consensus is that one either loves it or hates it.It's not the BEST movie I've ever seen, but it comes nowhere close to being the worst, either.  I like the movie, I like it a lot.  I guess you could say that I am a part of its ""cult following.""  The background of the movie is interesting.  It did terribly at the box office with its first release.  It wasn't until it made it to HBO that it developed an audience.  With its delayed success blossoming, it was decided to create a sequel, Eddie & the Cruisers II: Eddie LIves.  However, Martin Davidson, director of the original movie, wanted no part of the sequel.  It bombed.There are some discrepancies with the movie.  The style of music that Eddie Wilson, leader of the Cruisers, creates and records with the band in partnership with lyricist Frank Ridgeway, is oddly reminiscent of the mid-70s New Jersey rock sound as embodied by Bruce Springsteen or Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.  However, the flashback portions of the movies ostensibly take place in the early to mid-60s, which is about the time of the first British invasion.  That the magazine folks would call the music visionary would be an understatement - who is able to accurately predict music styles 10 years ahead of their time?Also, a premise of the story is based upon the disappearance of French poet, Arthur Rimbaud, who stopped writing and just vanished only to resurface on his death bed twenty years later, according to the movie.  There is some truth to that.  Rimbaud did stop trying to publish poetry, and he left France after his male lover, Paul Verlaine decided to return to his wife.  But he hardly disappeared.  Instead he enlisted as a soldier in the Dutch Colonial Army and traveled the Mediterranean region and Africa where he deserted and landed in Ethiopia.  He eventually returned to France with a tumor in his leg and died soon after having it amputated.But overall, the movie is an interesting bit of story-telling, with a glimpse at the life of an upcoming band, the peaks and valleys of unity and division between band members, creative differences, love entanglements and so on.

This movie will appeal to the once 20 plus year age crowd of the 80's era, but may not be so well received by the masses today.  The movie utilizes flashbacks throughout the film to portray the life of the band, with the music well done.  I disagree with Amazon, and found the Beaver Brown Band to be very good.

141401,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,079283867X,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[7, 7]","Along with 1984's pop-rock opera cult classic STREETS OF FIRE, EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS (1983) marks the high-water mark of Michael Pare's less-than-stellar acting career. Pare, a late-blooming denizen of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting, is Eddie, the iconoclastic leader of a North Jersey 1950s Doo-Wop band, a one-hit wonder, The Cruisers, whose 1963 hit, ""On The Dark Side"" has been rediscovered, circa 1983, and is leading to a popular Cruisers revival.Two decades later, Maggie (Ellen Barkin) is a music reporter who is indefatigable in hunting down the surviving band members, most of whom are leading exceptionally colorless lives. She is driven by rumors of a ""lost"" Cruisers album, ""A Season In Hell,"" which is reputedly earth-shattering.As the story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, we meet Eddie, an egotistical greaser, the archetypal Leader of The Pack. His band is rounded out by his eye-candy girlfriend, Joanne (singing vocals), his Clarence Clemons-inspired jazz-sax friend Wendell, Sal Amato, a marginally talented guitarist from the old neighborhood, Kenny the drummer, Doc the manager, and Frank Ridgway (Tom Berenger), the lyricist ""Word Man."" While the rest of the band trails far behind Eddie's talent and vision, for his part, Word Man introduces Eddie to Verlaine and Rimbaud the disappeared nineteen year old Romantic Poet who committed ""artistic suicide"" and who serves as the direct inspiration for ""A Season In Hell."" The obvious connection to Rimbaud aside, Eddie ""On The Dark Side"" is also a clear fictionalization of The Doors' Jim Morrison, who found his inspiration in Celine's ""Journey To The End of The Night.""Although Eddie refers to Wendell as his ""best friend"" he has a much deeper sibling-like relationship with Word Man, whom he alternately ignores, embraces, and disparages as the mood takes him. Despite Eddie's rough edges, he has the soul of an artist, and respects Word Man as he respects no one else.After the avant-garde musical montage that is ""A Season In Hell"" is bluntly rejected by the Cruisers' label, Eddie, Rimbaud-cum-Morrison-like, suffers a mysterious death. The ""A Season In Hell"" tapes vanish. Eddie's body is, unsurprisingly, never found.Despite the transparency of the plot, EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS is an engaging film that has acheived cult status in the twenty-some years since its release. The music, provided by John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, is stylistically essentially reworked Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, but it holds up well. Although EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS was a critical flop dismissed as having an ""impossible"" storyline (no such thing), it was a popular, if minor, success that spawned a sequel, the predictably titled EDDIE LIVES. A far better effort than it sounds, EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS is a great Sunday afternoon popcorn-and-soda flick that you will want to watch from time to time.",4,"""From out of the shadows she walks like a dream...""",1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,2893,"['1984', 'pop-rock', 'opera', 'cult', 'classic', 'STREETS', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'EDDIE', 'AND', 'THE', 'CRUISERS', '1983', 'high-water', 'mark', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'less-than-stellar', 'acting', 'career', 'Pare', 'late-blooming', 'denizen', 'Clenched', 'Jaw', 'School', 'Acting', 'Eddie', 'iconoclastic', 'leader', 'North', 'Jersey', '1950s', 'Doo-Wop', 'band', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'Cruisers', '1963', 'hit', 'Dark', 'Side', 'been', 'rediscovered', 'circa', '1983', 'leading', 'popular', 'Cruisers', 'revival.Two', 'decades', 'later', 'Maggie', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'music', 'reporter', 'who', 'indefatigable', 'hunting', 'down', 'surviving', 'band', 'members', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'leading', 'exceptionally', 'colorless', 'lives', 'driven', 'rumors', 'lost', 'Cruisers', 'album', 'Season', 'Hell', 'reputedly', 'earth-shattering.As', 'story', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'meet', 'Eddie', 'egotistical', 'greaser', 'archetypal', 'Leader', 'Pack', 'band', 'rounded', 'out', 'eye-candy', 'girlfriend', 'Joanne', 'singing', 'vocals', 'Clarence', 'Clemons-inspired', 'jazz-sax', 'friend', 'Wendell', 'Sal', 'Amato', 'marginally', 'talented', 'guitarist', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'Kenny', 'drummer', 'Doc', 'manager', 'Frank', 'Ridgway', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'lyricist', 'Word', 'Man', 'rest', 'band', 'far', 'Eddie', 'talent', 'vision', 'part', 'Word', 'Man', 'Eddie', 'Verlaine', 'Rimbaud', 'disappeared', 'nineteen', 'year', 'old', 'Romantic', 'Poet', 'who', 'committed', 'artistic', 'suicide', 'who', 'direct', 'inspiration', 'A', 'Season', 'Hell', 'obvious', 'connection', 'Rimbaud', 'aside', 'Eddie', 'Dark', 'Side', 'also', 'clear', 'fictionalization', 'Doors', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'who', 'found', 'inspiration', 'Celine', 'Journey', 'End', 'Night', 'Eddie', 'refers', 'Wendell', 'best', 'friend', 'much', 'deeper', 'sibling-like', 'relationship', 'Word', 'Man', 'whom', 'alternately', 'embraces', 'disparages', 'mood', 'Eddie', 'rough', 'edges', 'soul', 'artist', 'Word', 'Man', 'one', 'avant-garde', 'musical', 'montage', 'A', 'Season', 'Hell', 'bluntly', 'rejected', 'Cruisers', 'label', 'Eddie', 'Rimbaud-cum-Morrison-like', 'mysterious', 'death', 'A', 'Season', 'Hell', 'vanish', 'Eddie', 'body', 'unsurprisingly', 'never', 'found.Despite', 'transparency', 'plot', 'EDDIE', 'AND', 'THE', 'CRUISERS', 'engaging', 'film', 'acheived', 'cult', 'status', 'twenty-some', 'years', 'release', 'music', 'provided', 'John', 'Cafferty', 'Beaver', 'Brown', 'Band', 'stylistically', 'essentially', 'reworked', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'E', 'Street', 'Band', 'up', 'well', 'EDDIE', 'AND', 'THE', 'CRUISERS', 'was', 'critical', 'flop', 'dismissed', 'having', 'impossible', 'storyline', 'such', 'thing', 'was', 'popular', 'minor', 'success', 'spawned', 'sequel', 'predictably', 'titled', 'EDDIE', 'LIVES', 'A', 'far', 'better', 'effort', 'EDDIE', 'AND', 'THE', 'CRUISERS', 'great', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'popcorn-and-soda', 'flick', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'time', 'time']",N/A

141410,A1J2931UBBJPXM,079283867X,Reviewer,"[34, 37]","Mystery surrounds the death of a rising rock star in director Martin Davidson's ""Eddie and the Cruisers,"" starring Tom Berenger and Michael Pare.  With one successful album under their belts, lead singer and  guitarist Eddie Wilson (Pare) takes his Cruisers into the recording studio  to make an album he hopes will stand the world on its collective ear.  Drawing the title from a work by Nineteenth Century poet Arthur Rimbaud,  they begin to lay down tracks for ""A Season In Hell.""  But all is not well  with Eddie and the band; there is dissent, and at least one among them,  bassist Sal Amato (Matthew Laurance) disagrees with the direction in which  Eddie has taken their music.  Early one morning, toward the end of the  recording sessions, Eddie's car goes off a bridge into the river; his body  is never found.  Now, eighteen years later, a reporter, Maggie Foley (Ellen  Barkin) is doing a story on the Cruisers, and attempting to uncover the  mystery behind the disappearance of the master tapes from the recording  sessions, which inexplicably vanished the day after Eddie's apparent death.  Pare is perfectly cast as Eddie, the Bruce Springsteen-like rocker; he  lip-synchs convincingly to John Cafferty's vocals and deftly captures the  persona of an early sixties rock n' roll idol on the rise.  Tom Berenger  (who is actually the star of the movie) does an excellent job as lyricist  Frank Ridgeway, the keyboard player known as  ""Word Man"" by the band.  Davidson tells the story by effectively using flashbacks, through which we  get to know Eddie and his band, and which establishes the relationships so  pertinent to the present day conflicts which emerge during Foley's  investigation of Eddie and the missing tapes.  The focus is mainly on  Ridgeway, therefore as the story unfolds it is predominately from his  perspective that we learn what really happened, especially on that last  night in the recording studio.  That there is a comparison being drawn  between Eddie and Jim Morrison of The Doors is unmistakable; the plot draws  heavily on the myth that Morrison (and Eddie) is still alive and may have  ""Pulled a Rimbaud.""  Poet Rimbaud (who is considered a genius, and to whom  the creation of the form of modern poetry as we know it is attributed)  committed ""artistic suicide"" at the age of nineteen, at which time he  abruptly quit writing and disappeared for the next twenty years, only to  reappear at last on his deathbed in France.  That the title of Rimbaud's  masterpiece is ""A Season In Hell"" is no coincidence.  The parallels are  drawn convincingly, which heightens the interest and adds to the  credibility of the mystery.  The supporting cast includes Joe  Pantoliano (Doc), Helen Schneider (Joann), David Wilson (Kenny), Michael  Antunes (Wendell) and Kenny Vance (Lew).

It's about playing with meaning and from the heart. After all music is one of the spices of humanity.

141421,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,079283867X,William Timothy Lukeman,"[1, 1]","""Eddie and the Cruisers"" isn't a lost masterpiece, but it's a solid, thoughtful, enjoyable film about one of the great driving narratives of Western culture: The Artist Ahead Of His (or Her) Time, doomed to be ignored during life, then rediscovered after death. From William Blake to Nick Drake, we've seen this story repeated over & over ... and we'll see it many times again.Yes, there's a touch of fantasy & wish fulfillment here -- but we're not dealing with a gritty, utterly realistic film. This is really parable & myth, after all. The references to Rimbaud, the quote from Wordsworth early in the film, the stylized look of some of the settings, the rock and roll legends evoked throughout -- it's all quite clear.In which case, complaints about the music are beside the point. How can any soundtrack writer be told, ""OK, we need something as good as Beethoven's 'Ninth Symphony,' or Miles Davis' 'Kind of Blue,' or Dylan's 'Blood on the Tracks'?"" Obviously that's just not possible. The faux-Springsteen songs are strong in their own right, but we should take them as stand-ins for the music that Eddie & Frank actually created, just as in Patricia Rozema's film ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing,"" glowing panes of framed light represent the magnificent paintings created by one of the characters.The acting itself is quite good, with Tom Berenger negotiating a rather difficult role as Frank/Word Man: he's the main character, but he often has to stand at the side & simply observe events. He effectively conveys naive uncertainty in flashbacks to his younger days, and a wistful world-weariness as an older man. In fact, he's said that this was one of his favorite roles. Michael Par&eacute; makes a fine, brooding, fiery Eddie; singer Helen Schneider is sultry, vulnerable, seeing more than she lets on; and Joe Pantoliano is a slick, raspy-voiced delight. A young Ellen Barkin does what she can with a somewhat underwritten role.Again, it's not a great film. But it is a very good, honorable & thoroughly entertaining film, with a final scene that still has the power to evoke chills after repeated viewings. You'll have to be open to the sort of story it's telling -- if so, you'll find that it's quite rewarding.
