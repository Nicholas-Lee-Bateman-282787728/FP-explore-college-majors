There are no outside opinions, no expert interviews... just the Director/Producer's talking head the entire time. I don't profess to be an expert in the faith of our founding fathers, but this documentary does not seem to do any justice to the actual study of their beliefs. While the opinions of the documentary may be entirely true, they were not presented in a fashion to convince me one way or another.Many of the writings the Director/Producer presents from Paine, 'Washington and others makes it appear the founding fathers were not Christian. I can't tell one way or another because full evidence and back and forths were not present in the documentary, but it appears to me that the founding fathers had a problem with the gospel of the time - that which had morphed and changed in Europe over centuries of the dark ages. The gospel of the time, taught by the Church of England in a reprehensible manner, is what I think these founding fathers were distancing themselves from.

Anyone with a decent university education already knew this, but here filmmaker Christian Pinto presents a case made in evangelical-speak for those who refuse to believe anything from anyone who doesn't carry a bible or pepper his or her speech with the name of the saviour.Pinto presents more than enough examples from the letters and diaries of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Ben Franklin, George Washington and Thomas Paine to convince most any sane person that these men had very low regard for Christianity.  Unfortunately, Pinto veers off track and gets bogged down in boringly circumstantial detail on the influence of Freemasonry and Catholicism on early American government.  The overly dramatic score gives the impression that something important is being revealed, when really all it does is impress upon you how little to which it all amounts.  The dramatic recreations, if you care to call them that, amount to little more than a few old guys in period costume shuffling papers, looking at maps, or attempting to write longhand with a quill.  Look closely to see what a mess they make of it - big globs of ink whenever they start from a fresh dip from the inkpot.At three hours, the film is a bit overlong but is nevertheless a great one to give or recommend to your friend who thinks America is a Christian nation.

1385928,A5I5DXHUD6B6Y,B00461VOPO,Dennis,"[16, 31]","I have a real hard time seeing how Christian Pinto makes sense of his hypothesis on the collection of his work. Forgive me for this review in advance because there's just to much to rant about. First like all his movies the production isn't bad, but his formula is pretty much the same at how he makes a film. Find a few quotes, books, and authors who support your view and turn them into a documentary. This film like the rest of his essentially ruined my lust for conspiracy theories. It's really pretty easy to create a film based on any hypothesis. This makes me think I can pretty much make an argument that French Toast is the cause of all the calamities of the 20th century (with protools of course).This film basically presents the ideas that a majority of the founding fathers where atheists and or a form of antichrist that are undermining our culture and how we view our form of Government. This is done based on their own words and (similar to how Pinto grabs at scripture) is taken out of a context and formulated into a (semi) coherent film. I say semi because like all of his films they are based on a house of cards where is one aspect is disproved the whole thing falls. He goes down the line through founding father and criticizes their writing for not supporting a literal Bible interpretation....or Chris Pinto's approved version of Christianity. Good Luck trying to find any two people who have the exact same beliefs regarding Christianity.Another notion that came through my mind was..who cares? Most mainline history books have gone this at nauseam. When I read the Declaration of Independence or Bill of Rights I'm not making the connection to Christianity. I make the connection of allowing the freedom for individuals to make up their own damn mind. To allow people like Mr. Pinto the ability to critique everyone else's views on what constitutes being a Christian because his mind Catholics are not Christians as we learn that Washington made a deathbed conversion to Catholicism, which placed him on his Sheet list. No, only if you read the KJB written for 17th century Englishmen can you really learn about true Christianity.One example is Thomas Jefferson. Criticizing Jefferson's religious views is nothing new and was done even in his day. But essentially Jefferson was a man who went through his life in varying correspondences trying to understand  religion as we all do. Pinto rails on him for creating his own interpretation of the Bible, wanting change scripture, and even eliminating parts of the Old Testament. This is presented of course with dark music and a cautious tone. Funny...Martin Luther wanted to eliminate the Old Testament, created his own Bible, and did change scripture to fit his ideologies. But Pinto won't que the dark music or present that in his anti-Catholic film Lamp in the Dark.  Like a majority of literal interpreters if it doesn't fit their argument you hear ""nope, it's not in the KJB"" but if it conflicts with their interpretation you'll hear ""well that's more of a metaphor"".And just as he portrays the Catholics through a solely negative scope, he does the same of our founding fathers. Without Catholocism a majority of the world would not know Christ or even have collective manuscript format of the Bible. Without the founding fathers sincerity to allow freedom of thought and pursuit of happiness, Chris Pinto would not be able to create his ""documentary"". Mr. Pinto seems to want a Govt. overseen from a literal Biblical perspective. I.E a universal (Catholic) church governing the nation....But when the Catholics suggest that it's NWO propaganda. There's a sea of hypocrisy that people like Christian Pinto spout that will simply drive you mad trying to discern where their dogma begins and ends. Men are not perfect and neither were our founding fathers, you can find whatever you want to in them, but look at the larger picture and you'll see the greatness they created. Watching this honestly made me sick. Mr. Pinto.. how about focusing on the blatant atrocities affecting our world. Your megiddo series at least did that. Listening to him freak out on Jefferson's correspondences he had in a letter is just ridiculous and is no bombshell. Read some of our forefathers other quotes and sacrifices they made for our future. Washington alone was a man unbelievable character and morals that is rarely seen today.I'll leave you with some other quotes""The doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all the happiness of man; 1. That there is one only God, and He all perfect. 2 That there is a future state of rewards and punishments.3 That to love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself, is the sum of religion""-JeffersonIf the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter-Washington",1,Here we go again!!!

So, while it is refreshing to see a Christian admit this, it worries me that the focus seems to be on how deceptive it was that this was hidden from the people of the US. The intertwining of religion throughout a countries' government has always met with ruin. But somehow claiming the greatest country on earth is the enemy of true Christians seem to be the other side of the same coin.It would be foolish to say that the founders were God fearing Christians and equally foolish to believe they were worshipers of reason. Historians often create a structure and order where there is little evidence of either. I find it hard to believe that a group as large as the continental congress all believed in reason or faith.What is clear is that they believed that England was oppressive and that they could and wanted to do a better job. They didn't as far as we know sacrifice any animals like early Jews, Christians and Satanists and they didn't seem to rely on thinking alone. So perhaps this country was not founded one way or the other but rather by men who had enough of King George and his taxes. And maybe, just maybe they all arrived at this conclusion via different means.This movie, while informative, is the first I have seen that make you feel like an ass for loving your country because it was founded non-biblically.But then I shouldn't expect much from a book that condones slavery and beating children.",2,Refreshing - but more crazy Christian non-sense.,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,1547,"['true', 'founders', 'were', 'not', '34', 'Christian', '34', 'embraced', 'reason', 'faith', 'seem', 'remember', 'learning', 'child', 'So', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Christian', 'admit', 'focus', 'be', 'how', 'deceptive', 'was', 'was', 'hidden', 'people', 'US', 'intertwining', 'religion', 'countries', 'government', 'always', 'met', 'ruin', 'somehow', 'claiming', 'greatest', 'country', 'earth', 'enemy', 'true', 'Christians', 'seem', 'be', 'other', 'side', 'same', 'coin.It', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'say', 'founders', 'were', 'God', 'fearing', 'Christians', 'equally', 'foolish', 'believe', 'were', 'worshipers', 'reason', 'Historians', 'often', 'create', 'structure', 'order', 'where', 'little', 'evidence', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'group', 'as', 'large', 'continental', 'congress', 'believed', 'reason', 'faith.What', 'clear', 'believed', 'England', 'was', 'oppressive', 'could', 'wanted', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'as', 'far', 'know', 'sacrifice', 'animals', 'early', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'Satanists', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'rely', 'thinking', 'alone', 'So', 'perhaps', 'country', 'was', 'not', 'founded', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'rather', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'enough', 'King', 'George', 'taxes', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'arrived', 'conclusion', 'different', 'means.This', 'movie', 'informative', 'first', 'have', 'seen', 'make', 'feel', 'ass', 'loving', 'country', 'was', 'founded', 'non-biblically.But', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'book', 'slavery', 'beating', 'children']",The Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers

However, I was stunned to learn how much crystal clear evidence exists for the premise that the US never intended to be a &#34;Christian nation.&#34;  In fact, it would apparently be more accurate to say the founders were proactive and purposeful in being non-Christian, perhaps even anti-Christian, in their philosophies both personal and political.  It was also interesting to see/hear the differences in the reactions among them when confronted concerning their personal faith:  Paine was defiant, Jefferson was rational, Washington was evasive, Franklin was politely and passively curious, etc.And here is the real kicker:  this is NOT some left-wing &#34;see we told you so&#34; effort to secularize the government and society.  Rather, it comes from the angle that the founders should stop being held up as Christians heroes because it misleads Christians into violating key tenets of the faith.  In other words, it's not a film aimed at protecting the purity of the nation, but rather the purity of the faithful.  For example, it takes an action or comment by one of the founders and juxtaposes it with a passage from the Bible to show the founders were flagrantly violating Christian doctrines and &#34;rules.&#34;  Also, it repeatedly (and to somebody who has spent a lot of time studying the whole church-state thing) jarringly interjects adverbs and adjectives that reveal the underlying intent of the film.  For example, rather than saying something like &#34;On his death bed, Thomas Jefferson rejected the notion that Jesus was divine,&#34; the narrator would say, &#34;Unfortunately, even on his death bed, Thomas Jefferson never accepted the divinity of Jesus.&#34;  Maybe that's a clever subterfuge rather than a sincere bias at work, but if so in my case it was certainly effective in bolstering the credibility of the evidence and arguments presented.Speaking of, as is true with most historical detective work, I recommend you pay close attention to the cited sources for the quotes offered since the credibility varies a great deal in that there are personal letters and books and treaties and such that really cannot be questioned re the authenticity and accuracy of the alleged comments, but on the other hand there is also a lot of hearsay that may come with its own bias.All in all, not the most exciting four hours of your life by any means, but if you are genuinely interested in knowing more about the religious lives of the men who created this country, it's time well spent.",4,Fascinating and surprising,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2659,"['Episcopalian', 'turned', 'deist', 'Unitarian', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'informed', 'very', 'similar', 'beliefs', 'many', 'key', 'founders', 'republic', 'However', 'was', 'stunned', 'learn', 'how', 'much', 'crystal', 'clear', 'evidence', 'exists', 'premise', 'US', 'never', 'intended', 'be', '34', 'Christian', 'nation.', '34', 'fact', 'would', 'apparently', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'founders', 'were', 'proactive', 'purposeful', 'being', 'non-Christian', 'perhaps', 'even', 'anti-Christian', 'philosophies', 'personal', 'political', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'see/hear', 'differences', 'reactions', 'when', 'confronted', 'concerning', 'personal', 'faith', 'Paine', 'was', 'defiant', 'Jefferson', 'was', 'rational', 'Washington', 'was', 'evasive', 'Franklin', 'was', 'politely', 'passively', 'curious', 'etc.And', 'here', 'real', 'kicker', 'NOT', 'left-wing', '34', 'see', 'told', 'so', '34', 'effort', 'secularize', 'government', 'society', 'Rather', 'angle', 'founders', 'should', 'stop', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'Christians', 'heroes', 'Christians', 'violating', 'key', 'tenets', 'faith', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'film', 'aimed', 'protecting', 'purity', 'nation', 'rather', 'purity', 'faithful', 'example', 'action', 'comment', 'one', 'founders', 'juxtaposes', 'passage', 'Bible', 'show', 'founders', 'were', 'flagrantly', 'violating', 'Christian', 'doctrines', '34', 'rules.', '34', 'Also', 'repeatedly', 'somebody', 'who', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'studying', 'whole', 'church-state', 'thing', 'jarringly', 'adverbs', 'reveal', 'underlying', 'intent', 'film', 'example', 'rather', 'saying', 'something', '34', 'death', 'bed', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'rejected', 'notion', 'Jesus', 'was', 'divine', '34', 'narrator', 'would', 'say', '34', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'death', 'bed', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'never', 'accepted', 'divinity', 'Jesus.', '34', 'Maybe', 'clever', 'subterfuge', 'rather', 'sincere', 'bias', 'work', 'so', 'case', 'was', 'certainly', 'effective', 'bolstering', 'credibility', 'evidence', 'arguments', 'presented.Speaking', 'true', 'most', 'historical', 'detective', 'work', 'recommend', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'cited', 'sources', 'quotes', 'offered', 'credibility', 'great', 'deal', 'are', 'personal', 'letters', 'books', 'treaties', 'such', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'questioned', 're', 'authenticity', 'accuracy', 'alleged', 'comments', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'lot', 'hearsay', 'may', 'come', 'own', 'bias.All', 'not', 'most', 'exciting', 'four', 'hours', 'life', 'means', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'knowing', 'more', 'religious', 'lives', 'men', 'who', 'created', 'country', 'time', 'well', 'spent']",The Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers

1385944,A3MTUU1VKCGMX4,B00461VOPO,Randall Ross,"[10, 23]","The first explanation of this film is it is from a strictly evangelical Christian perspective where the Bible is taken literally.  It has an agenda, which is to convince the viewer that the Founding Fathers were not Christian by the producers definition.  According to them, no one can be Christian unless one takes communion, goes to church regularly, speaks publicly about their Christianity and that Christ is their savior. The last part of the video is quite ridiculous as they jump into the modern era and question President Obama's Christian beliefs.  They show a clip of President Obama being interviewed by an evangelical preacher and Obama says that he is a Christian and is asked further what that means to him, he goes on to say that he believes in Jesus and that Christ died for his sins.  This is still not proof to the producers of this film that Obama is indeed Christian because how can Obama say he is a Christian and believe in gay marriage and abortion.  That is complete nonsense and drops the video to a new low.  The producers and writers of this film are clearly Bible literalists, who have a very strict definition of who they consider ""real"" Christians and that doesn't include Catholics either. It's implied that there is a secret conspiracy of Vatican influence since the beginning of America and hints at a ""New World Order"" that the Catholic Church is in cahoots to secretly engineering.The Founding Fathers were Masons and/ or Deists for the most part and although most of them believed in a God, according to the video, they didn't believe necessarily in a Christian God.  It is a fact that America was not founded as a Christian nation or any other religion.  The Founding Fathers knew of the undue influence religion had on European governments, so the separation of church and state was well thought out and very important to them.  The producers of the video are not happy about that and I guess they wish we in America lived in a theocracy based on one religion and strict adherence to evangelical Christian beliefs and that all law should come from the Bible.  The first 2/3 of the video is interesting in its history, but I could definitely do without the constant editorializing from Christian Pinto and his evangelical judgments of what makes a ""true"" Christian.The last 1/3 of the video is absolutely ridiculous!  They question Obama's spirituality and religion as well as Nancy Pelosi's and hint that all liberals are secretly infidels because they believe in gay marriage and abortion.  All liberals must be atheists because they don't believe in their version of Christianity.  Their version is cultish thinking that if one doesn't believe exactly what they say is the literal interpretation of the Bible, then they're not going to heaven and all the founding fathers are in hell then, except for maybe George Washington because on his death bed he converted to Catholicism.  The video starts out as a rational and historical look at what the Founding Fathers religious/ spiritual beliefs were based on many of their writings and there are many, but devolves into a right wing attack on President Obama and all liberals making it quite silly and insipid.The Founding Fathers; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin were all intellectuals, most of them were Deists, a well known fact and were scientific and critical thinkers. Of course they would have had a critical view of Christianity and the Bible, this is not surprising.  I didn't appreciate the preaching the video turned into and I completely disagree with their view of Obama not being a Christian. Obama is a great example of a truly spiritual person with ""true and real"" Christian values because of his actions reflecting the teachings of Jesus. If Jesus was alive and American, he'd definitely be voting for Obama. Don't you think Jesus would want everybody to have affordable health care?  Don't you think Jesus would want the rich to pay their fair share in taxes for the good of society as a whole?

Some were decidedly deistic but did not follow a particular religion.We can measure the genius of our founders in many ways. One of the most important was how they chose to keep government and religion at arms-length. Our founders understood that faith and can be a crucial, formative element in individual lives. They knew that the religious views of men vary widely but the most important aspects of character are integrity, reason and tolerance.Our founders knew that government-sponsored religion commonly results in tyranny and the suppression of freedom for citizens. I hope that people today can appreciate the way our founders valued and respected diverse opinions on faith and religion.

1385946,A2419QAWNE8TI2,B00461VOPO,Revive Me,"[48, 74]","As a Bible-believing Christian, I know that we are to search hard for the truth and follow it wherever it leads, rather than basing our opinions on the prevailing traditions of men.  I have a master's degree in political science and took several graduate courses on the political philosophy of America's founding.  As a result, my own studies largely match those of Chris Pinto and this film.  Sadly, there are those out there who make a living promoting the myth of ""America's Christian Founders"" such as Washington, Jefferson, et al.  The sad reality is that these men were anything but Christians, as can be readily observed by their own writings (including what they didn't say as much as what they did--after all, if a man is a Christian, it should be obvious from his life.  Jesus said he who is ashamed of or denies Him before men will himself be denied in the end.)This is not a perfect film as there is a lot to cover, even in 3 hours, but overall it does an excellent job of marshaling the facts regarding this very important topic.  It will not be a pleasant pill to take for most American Christians to hear that many of their political heroes were deists, agnostics or outright atheists.  Yet the truth is the truth, even if it is unpopular or difficult to hear.  The film does go down a couple of rabbit trails such as the bodies in Franklin's house or Washington's alleged deathbed conversion to Catholicism.  Foes of this film will probably latch on to those issues rather than face the overwhelming force of evidence presented in the film that the American Revolution was conceived and led by non-Christians.  Although this documentary does not address the implications of this line of thinking, many Christians both then and now believe the Revolution was an unbiblical venture (see Romans 13 and elsewhere).I encourage anyone who has been influenced by David Barton, D. James Kennedy, ""Little Bear"" Wheeler and others of their school to get this film and prayerfully view it.

1385955,A2GA7FLT91IWLV,B00461VOPO,thechrisaccount,"[65, 97]","This documentary is a powerful THREE HOUR presentation that gives a step by step analysis of what the key founders of the American Revolution believed.  Most importantly, it is presented from a Christian perspective, comparing Biblical teachings with the beliefs of the founding fathers.  The film begins by showing a clear difference between the Pilgrims who landed in 1620 (who were Christians) and how 150 years passed until the time of the Revolutionaries, who held to radically different doctrines.  The production is said to be the fourth part of the ""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings"" series.There is an in-depth explanation (with detailed documentation) of the connection between the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers in Europe (like Voltaire and Rousseau) and how they directly impacted the founding fathers.  Once you understand their general philosophies, and how they exalted the concept of ""Reason"" above the supernatural elements of the Bible, many of the quotes from the founders make more sense.The film then takes you through the writings of Thomas Paine (who wrote ""Common Sense"" which inspired the Declaration of Independence), along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and George Washington.  Shocking quotes are presented from several of the key founders (Paine, Jefferson and Adams) who made vicious comments about Christianity and the Bible.  Again, detailed documentation is given.  The film also shows that while men like Franklin and Washington did not insult the Christian faith, there is strong evidence to suggest that they did not believe in it.The film then presents documentation that connects George Washington and Benjamin Franklin with Rome and the Jesuit Order during this era.  The information is fascinating, well documented, and presents a side to American history that you will not likely see anywhere else.  Most disturbing are two busts of the Roman Catholic popes who founded the Great Inquisition, which can be seen inside the U.S. Capitol.  These popes are presented among the great lawgivers of history.  Additional evidence is presented to show that the conflict of Rome against England through the Protestant Reformation era had much to do with America's conflict with England in the American Revolution.  Proof is presented that key parts of the U.S. Constitution were directly influenced by Rome.The final hour of this film is dedicated to exposing David Barton, who has appeared in the last year with Glenn Beck, presenting the founders as God fearing men who were supposedly fighting for a Christian nation.  This evidence is powerful, showing how Barton manipulates history, and quotes Jefferson and Adams out of context, making it appear that they believed things which they actually refuted.  Those who have seen this segment seem to lose all confidence in Barton's view of American history.  There is also a step-by-step examination of Barton's book on ""Freemasonry and the Founding Fathers,"" showing its many flaws, and proving that the philosophies of Masonry are identical to those of the Revolutionaries.  While Barton argues that George Washington was a Christian, it is shown from his own letters that Washington worshiped the Masonic god, (the Great Architect of the Universe), which Barton admits is not the God of the Bible.The production is partly presented in a History-channel type format, with dramatizations, visual graphics, and a professional musical score.  Other parts are in an off-the-cuff, guerilla filmmaking style, which seem designed to keep the work interesting.",5,The founders faith refuted from a Christian perspective,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,3570,"['documentary', 'powerful', 'THREE', 'HOUR', 'presentation', 'step', 'step', 'analysis', 'what', 'key', 'founders', 'American', 'Revolution', 'believed', 'Most', 'importantly', 'presented', 'Christian', 'perspective', 'comparing', 'Biblical', 'teachings', 'beliefs', 'founding', 'fathers', 'film', 'showing', 'clear', 'difference', 'Pilgrims', 'who', 'landed', '1620', 'who', 'were', 'Christians', 'how', '150', 'years', 'passed', 'time', 'Revolutionaries', 'who', 'held', 'radically', 'different', 'doctrines', 'production', 'said', 'be', 'fourth', 'part', 'Secret', 'Mysteries', 'America', 'Beginnings', 'in-depth', 'explanation', 'detailed', 'documentation', 'connection', 'ideas', 'Enlightenment', 'thinkers', 'Europe', 'Voltaire', 'Rousseau', 'how', 'directly', 'impacted', 'founding', 'fathers', 'Once', 'understand', 'general', 'philosophies', 'how', 'exalted', 'concept', 'Reason', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'Bible', 'many', 'quotes', 'founders', 'make', 'more', 'sense.The', 'film', 'then', 'writings', 'Thomas', 'Paine', 'who', 'wrote', 'Common', 'Sense', 'inspired', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'John', 'Adams', 'George', 'Washington', 'Shocking', 'quotes', 'are', 'presented', 'several', 'key', 'founders', 'Paine', 'Jefferson', 'Adams', 'who', 'made', 'vicious', 'comments', 'Christianity', 'Bible', 'Again', 'detailed', 'documentation', 'given', 'film', 'also', 'men', 'Franklin', 'Washington', 'did', 'not', 'insult', 'Christian', 'faith', 'strong', 'evidence', 'suggest', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'it.The', 'film', 'then', 'documentation', 'George', 'Washington', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Rome', 'Jesuit', 'Order', 'era', 'information', 'fascinating', 'well', 'documented', 'side', 'American', 'history', 'will', 'not', 'likely', 'see', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Most', 'disturbing', 'are', 'two', 'busts', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'popes', 'who', 'founded', 'Great', 'Inquisition', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'U.S.', 'Capitol', 'popes', 'are', 'presented', 'great', 'lawgivers', 'history', 'Additional', 'evidence', 'presented', 'show', 'conflict', 'Rome', 'England', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'era', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'America', 'conflict', 'England', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Proof', 'presented', 'key', 'parts', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'were', 'directly', 'influenced', 'Rome.The', 'final', 'hour', 'film', 'dedicated', 'exposing', 'David', 'Barton', 'who', 'appeared', 'last', 'year', 'Glenn', 'Beck', 'presenting', 'founders', 'God', 'fearing', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'supposedly', 'fighting', 'Christian', 'nation', 'evidence', 'powerful', 'showing', 'how', 'Barton', 'history', 'Jefferson', 'Adams', 'context', 'making', 'appear', 'believed', 'things', 'actually', 'refuted', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'segment', 'seem', 'lose', 'confidence', 'Barton', 'view', 'American', 'history', 'also', 'step-by-step', 'examination', 'Barton', 'book', 'Freemasonry', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'showing', 'many', 'flaws', 'proving', 'philosophies', 'Masonry', 'are', 'identical', 'Revolutionaries', 'Barton', 'George', 'Washington', 'was', 'Christian', 'shown', 'own', 'letters', 'Washington', 'worshiped', 'Masonic', 'god', 'Great', 'Architect', 'Universe', 'Barton', 'not', 'God', 'Bible.The', 'production', 'partly', 'presented', 'History-channel', 'type', 'format', 'dramatizations', 'visual', 'graphics', 'professional', 'musical', 'score', 'Other', 'parts', 'are', 'off-the-cuff', 'guerilla', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'seem', 'designed', 'keep', 'work', 'interesting']",The Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers
