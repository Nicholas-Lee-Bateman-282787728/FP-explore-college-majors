It displays a risky but quirky approach to most of the societal ""issues"" of our time-and still keeps you laughing! Even when the characters neurotic tendencies reach a ridiculous climax of annoyance...you still have to keep watching. One of the frustrating things that most shows are really terrible with, is contenuity...of story and character.  This show is really on top of all the past experiences and subtleties of each main character, as well as the guests. The extras on each cd are wonderful, and very insightful to the actual personalities involved in the success of this show!

1101317,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,B000VECAEE,A Customer,"[3, 3]","Seriously, only one show can get the superlative rating.  I've thought about it, too, and if there's ever been a more clever show, I haven't seen it.I didn't watch this for years, because I thought Jerry Seinfeld's face was too ugly.  Yep, I can be that shallow!But then, I heard it being discussed around the office water cooler every week for over a year.  And you know you did too.  So I finally tuned in.  Weekly in prime time, perhaps year 7, and five days a week in early evening reruns.And now, at last, I've seen every episode ever made, in order, and I must say they're all hilarious, except for a few that are merely very funny.  To state the obvious, it started with Jerry doing ""bits"" and George listening/commenting, then grew into an ensemble piece.Did they know how much talent Michael Richards (Fridays) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (SNL) was bringing to the cast, or were they just very lucky?  In my case, I was a Michael Richards fan long before Seinfeld, but Julia Louis-Dreyfus wasn't all that memorable on SNL, so that was a nice surprise.But you know why this show's getting five stars, right?  The writing!  Always tight, always clever, with an excellent mix of physical humor, low humor, very intelligent humor, maximum use of the acting talents it had, and those tight endings that neatly tied together threads which really seemed impossibly disparate.  And all in only 22 minutes a week.  Wow!As you may have guessed, this isn't something I'm gonna watch from start to finish one time -- I just did that -- and then get rid of.  Oh no, it stays on my shelf, to be watched again and again.  It doesn't matter if it's an episode I've seen once or 10 times, it's always good for another viewing.",5,The Cleverest Show Ever Made,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,1714,"['Seriously', 'only', 'one', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'superlative', 'rating', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'too', 'ever', 'been', 'more', 'clever', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'years', 'thought', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'face', 'was', 'too', 'ugly', 'Yep', 'can', 'be', 'shallow', 'then', 'heard', 'being', 'discussed', 'office', 'water', 'cooler', 'week', 'year', 'know', 'did', 'too', 'So', 'finally', 'tuned', 'Weekly', 'prime', 'time', 'perhaps', 'year', '7', 'five', 'days', 'week', 'early', 'evening', 'reruns.And', 'now', 'last', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'ever', 'made', 'order', 'must', 'say', ""'re"", 'hilarious', 'few', 'are', 'merely', 'very', 'funny', 'state', 'obvious', 'started', 'Jerry', 'doing', 'bits', 'George', 'listening/commenting', 'then', 'grew', 'ensemble', 'piece.Did', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'talent', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'Fridays', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'SNL', 'was', 'bringing', 'cast', 'were', 'just', 'very', 'lucky', 'case', 'was', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'fan', 'long', 'before', 'Seinfeld', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'was', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'SNL', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise.But', 'know', 'why', 'show', 'getting', 'five', 'stars', 'right', 'writing', 'Always', 'tight', 'always', 'clever', 'excellent', 'mix', 'physical', 'humor', 'low', 'humor', 'very', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'maximum', 'use', 'acting', 'talents', 'had', 'tight', 'endings', 'neatly', 'tied', 'together', 'threads', 'really', 'seemed', 'impossibly', 'disparate', 'only', '22', 'minutes', 'week', 'Wow', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', ""n't"", 'something', ""'m"", 'gon', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'time', 'just', 'did', 'then', 'get', 'rid', 'Oh', 'shelf', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'again', ""n't"", 'matter', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'once', '10', 'times', 'always', 'good', 'viewing']",Seinfeld: The Complete Series

The presentation is first rate and the book a gold mine of information to read with interest whilst watching the show. I have been able to pass on lots of trivia to my wife that she did not know - by looking at the book as we watch the DVD's. She was surprised to learn that the series was shot in California and not New York (where is it set).Though I am not all the way through this series, I have enjoyed what I have seen so far immensely.

Theres no use inexplaining any of the characters and episodes in this review as others have done, I'll just tell you Seinfeld fans why this set is a good value. First off, even if you shop around you won't find a better price if you buy all of the seasons separately. Plus, the box set includes the awesome coffee table book and bonus 'round table' DVD where the cast members get together 10 years later to talk about the show and their experiences. The DVD's store very well and compact in two thick books of DVD's. The whole reason that I bought this set was to catch all the episodes in order, not just the ones that TBS and other stations run in syndication, and couldn't be happier with my purchase.

1101324,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000VECAEE,barry,"[6, 6]","I just purchased this complete series of Seinfeld a few months ago.  I had my dvr set up to record every episode of Seinfeld in repeats.  So every night I would watch 2-3 episodes before bed and it was my regular routine.  They aired the final episode and the reruns started from the first one again and I thought how stupid could I be.  I love this show.  I will watch it over and over.  So I looked into purchasing it as a complete series.  And what I found - this item here - was a godsend.  Now I can watch every episode from the beginning in order, digitally remastered with an added 2-3 minutes per episode with the cuts for tv airing gone.  And let me tell you the difference in video quality is amazing.  Now if you are looking at this item you are obviously a Seinfeld fan so I am going to write more on the quality of the set - The Complete Series.I have purchased many complete series sets of other shows and have never, ever seen one of the quality of Seinfeld.  Anything you read in the item description praising its construction cannot be written well enough to honestly show its brilliance.  The collectors case is made of the sturdiest heavy cardboard and it stands an estimated 11"" by 7"".  It is very classy in pure black with a small photo of the cast embossed in the center of the front.  And the title Seinfeld is embossed in bold gold on the side.  Turn it to the side and there are three compartments.  The long side compartment holds the superb coffee table book and the other two are separate sections that hold cases that contain the episode discs.  The first is a trifold case that holds series 1-5 and the second is the same but carries seasons 6-9.  There are 32 discs total.The coffee table book is a beautiful hardback book that is worth much just in itself.  It is a 226 page anthology with descriptions of each episode, pictures, quotes and trivia.  The facts in this book are amazing and tell why the show made many decisions in plot, casting and plot.  It is a dream for any Seinfeld fan.  And we also get the bonus disc of the cast reunion.  Bottom line is that nothing was spared with this complete series set.  It is a true gift to Seinfeld fans.  The discs of the series you get are the same you got if you purchased them individually as they were for sale.  The unique thing about Seinfeld is that the extras with each season are actually worth viewing.  There is a making of documentary of each season, bloopers and very informative and fun features.  People who already own the series individually often get angry at having to ""double dip""  but what this item costs now makes it a no brainer to purchase.  As I said the coffeee table book is an expensive item in itself.  And series have been on dvd long enough now that people must realize they certainly can purchase each season as it is released but ultimately when the show has run its course there will be a complete series set released.I cannot praise the Seinfeld Complete Series set enough.  it is one of my favorite shows of all time and here it is presented in all its remastered glory with all the Seinfeld trivia and features I could want.  And I want to end by noting that the collector's case is so nice that I actually have it displayed on top of a bookcase.  It is in no way cheesy but put together as an elegant piece of art.  I am so glad that I came to my senses and stopped watching the reruns on tv and invested in this amazing set that I will now have for a lifetime.",5,Superb box set of amazing series,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,3480,"['just', 'purchased', 'complete', 'series', 'Seinfeld', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'had', 'dvr', 'set', 'up', 'record', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'repeats', 'So', 'night', 'would', 'watch', '2-3', 'episodes', 'bed', 'was', 'regular', 'routine', 'aired', 'final', 'episode', 'reruns', 'started', 'first', 'one', 'again', 'thought', 'how', 'stupid', 'could', 'be', 'love', 'show', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'So', 'looked', 'purchasing', 'complete', 'series', 'what', 'found', 'item', 'here', 'was', 'godsend', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'episode', 'beginning', 'order', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'added', '2-3', 'minutes', 'episode', 'cuts', 'tv', 'airing', 'gone', 'let', 'tell', 'difference', 'video', 'quality', 'amazing', 'Now', 'are', 'looking', 'item', 'are', 'obviously', 'Seinfeld', 'fan', 'so', 'am', 'going', 'write', 'more', 'quality', 'set', 'Complete', 'Series.I', 'have', 'purchased', 'many', 'complete', 'series', 'sets', 'other', 'shows', 'have', 'never', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'quality', 'Seinfeld', 'Anything', 'read', 'item', 'description', 'praising', 'construction', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'written', 'well', 'enough', 'honestly', 'show', 'brilliance', 'collectors', 'case', 'made', 'sturdiest', 'heavy', 'cardboard', 'estimated', '11', '7', 'very', 'classy', 'pure', 'black', 'small', 'photo', 'cast', 'embossed', 'center', 'front', 'title', 'Seinfeld', 'embossed', 'bold', 'gold', 'side', 'Turn', 'side', 'are', 'three', 'compartments', 'long', 'side', 'compartment', 'superb', 'coffee', 'table', 'book', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'separate', 'sections', 'hold', 'cases', 'contain', 'episode', 'discs', 'first', 'trifold', 'case', 'series', '1-5', 'second', 'same', 'seasons', '6-9', 'are', '32', 'total.The', 'coffee', 'table', 'book', 'beautiful', 'hardback', 'book', 'worth', 'much', 'just', '226', 'page', 'anthology', 'descriptions', 'episode', 'pictures', 'quotes', 'trivia', 'facts', 'book', 'are', 'amazing', 'tell', 'why', 'show', 'made', 'many', 'decisions', 'plot', 'casting', 'plot', 'dream', 'Seinfeld', 'fan', 'also', 'get', 'bonus', 'disc', 'cast', 'reunion', 'Bottom', 'line', 'nothing', 'was', 'spared', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'true', 'gift', 'Seinfeld', 'fans', 'discs', 'series', 'get', 'are', 'same', 'got', 'purchased', 'individually', 'were', 'sale', 'unique', 'thing', 'Seinfeld', 'extras', 'season', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'viewing', 'making', 'documentary', 'season', 'bloopers', 'very', 'informative', 'fun', 'features', 'People', 'who', 'already', 'own', 'series', 'individually', 'often', 'get', 'angry', 'having', 'double', 'dip', 'what', 'item', 'now', 'brainer', 'purchase', 'said', 'coffeee', 'table', 'book', 'expensive', 'item', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'dvd', 'long', 'enough', 'now', 'people', 'must', 'realize', 'certainly', 'can', 'purchase', 'season', 'released', 'ultimately', 'when', 'show', 'run', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'released.I', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'Seinfeld', 'Complete', 'Series', 'set', 'enough', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'time', 'here', 'presented', 'remastered', 'glory', 'Seinfeld', 'trivia', 'features', 'could', 'want', 'want', 'end', 'noting', 'collector', 'case', 'so', 'nice', 'actually', 'have', 'displayed', 'top', 'bookcase', 'way', 'cheesy', 'put', 'together', 'elegant', 'piece', 'art', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'came', 'senses', 'stopped', 'watching', 'reruns', 'tv', 'invested', 'amazing', 'set', 'will', 'now', 'have', 'lifetime']",Seinfeld: The Complete Series

1101326,A3G6V756NP65PB,B000VECAEE,Bruce Hutton,"[115, 128]","This box set (and by the way the TV show behind it) deserves every star it can possibly get. Offering us the long view on ""Seinfeld,"" from day one to day last, it allows us to see the scope of this greatest of all television shows, transmogrifying itself from Jerry-In-Red-Sweatpants at the beginning to Jerry-In-Lear-Jet at the end, like the old drawing of Darwin's ""ape-caveman-upright man"" progression.And we see that the ape era wasn't so bad, after all; in fact, looked at as part of the show's evolution, the first two seasons, while the writers and actors were finding their voices, were the truest period of all for the show. Scrambling (sometimes raging) to find something, ANYthing to make a show about, Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld plumbed the best of their depths, offering a crash course in late-20th century survival of the un-fittest. Even at its 4th-season artistic zenith, the show would never be this real.With the whole thing here in one place, we can even see that there are periods to this show as with any longterm work. The first period (Seasons 1-2) is the most grounded in reality; the second period (Seasons 3-5) is the most artistically rich, where the show has truly found its niche and explores it like a kid in a Toys R Us with an unlimited charge account; the third period (Seasons 6-7) is the wheels-are-off-the-wagon period, where anything goes as long as it's funny, no idea is too insane; the fourth and final period (Seasons 8-9) is just as anything-goes but it gets just a bit too manic at times, and you occasionally lose the suspension of disbelief you need to enjoy any work of fiction. Still, there is no ""bad"" season of this show, and no single episode is completely devoid of that brilliant ""Seinfeld"" wit that made this one of the most popular television shows of all time.But scope is not all this set offers. It offers, simply, EVERYTHING. Confident that you have every episode at your fingertips, you can flip through the set for a show like you'd flip through the Bible for a quote (that's not going too far, is it?). Pick ""The Red Dot,"" then pick ""The Limo,"" then pick ""The Puffy Shirt,"" then pick ""The Finale."" On and on it goes, until you've seen so many you forget which ones you've seen and you start again. It's all there. And all the extras from all the box sets, from the feature-length documentary on the creation of the show to the great ""Inside Looks"" and the (frankly kind of useless) commentaries.New for this box set is a Seinfeld Coffee Table Book, which is kind of the trivia-rich ""Notes About Nothing"" segments rolled into a single volume. Also included is an hour-long special recorded in 2007 featuring the original four cast members and Larry David watching and commenting on various clips from the show's nine-year run. It's fun and interesting, but it probably won't be watched more than once or twice. The ""Inside Looks"" are better for tidbits and insight into the show's workings. Finally, the packaging simply couldn't be better: tight, durable, compact. As always, they've cared enough to think of everything.I love this show, I can watch it again and again, and it bugs me every time I hear people (even Seinfeld and co. themselves) talking about the characters as unredeemable or even vaguely sociopathic. The characters in ""Seinfeld"" are not anything like that. I think this misinterpretation, which is widespread even among the show's fans, is the fault of the actors and producers themselves, who have famously said that ""Seinfeld"" is a ""no-learning, no-hugging"" show. They themselves sold the characters as unredeemable; but the fact is that the 4-way friendship portrayed in this show is the strongest friendship ever portrayed on television. To me, that's what makes ""Seinfeld"" so great. What that show is REALLY about is people living in a massive, overwhelming urban environment (which, in our society of computers and malls and digital cable is everyone, even those living in small towns) who create and maintain a small outpost of human closeness, of love, in the face of that industrial anonymity we all feel closing in every day. That's certainly why I react to it, and why I've watched it so often.

1101328,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000VECAEE,calvinnme,"[361, 394]","To me, Seinfeld can basically be broken into three parts - seasons one and two where the series is just finding itself, seasons three through seven in which absolutely everything clicks due to the cast's great on-screen rapport and the genius of Larry David, and the last two seasons after Larry David's departure in which the focus shifted somewhat from a satirical look at the uglier side of human nature to zany comedy. Usually every episode was a stand-alone. In fact, some of the early episodes are so stand-alone as to have the audience wonder what happened. In season two's ""The Deal"", Elaine and Jerry decide to try combining their current friendship (""this"") with their past by sleeping together (""that""). As George portends though, it is pretty much impossible to mix ""this and that"" without eventually losing both. The end of the episode shows Jerry and Elaine pretty much settling into ""this that and the other"" - a romantic relationship - and then the series just drops the subject like the whole episode never happened.Occasionally Seinfeld would have a story arc of sorts. For example, in season four the show poked fun at network television executives and their decision-making process when George and Jerry wind up pitching the idea for ""a TV show about nothing"" to NBC. The two offer up what is essentially the script of the widely acclaimed Seinfeld episode ""The Chinese Restaurant"". The network suits are unimpressed. As an alternative George and Jerry present a ridiculous plot in which a judge sentences someone who has hit Jerry's car to be his butler. This time the suits are bowled over. Seinfeld also truly had a gift for entertaining while pushing the audience to the brink of offense. ""The Bubble Boy"" presents the audience with a rude and obnoxious individual as the victim of an immune deficiency disease versus the patient angels that usually play this role. ""The Outing"" introduced the phrase ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" into American pop culture and also smartly satirized political correctness. ""The Junior Mint"" shows George in familiar form when he pleads with Jerry not to intervene to save an artist's life because it would devalue the artist's paintings he has purchased in anticipation of that same artist's death.The show is often absurd, and though it seems impossible that such a group of self-absorbed people could carry on even the pretense of a multi-year friendship, something about it is oddly familiar to most of us. That is at least partly because of the great interaction between the main characters in which they have both comic and straight-man duties depending on the situation, making their relationships seem real although exaggerated.As far as the details on the set, it is a 32-disc, two-volume set offering all 180 episodes of the show along with ""The Official Coffee Table Book,"" a 226-page, bound anthology filled with photos, quotes, trivia from every episode, and personal reflections from Jerry. The collectible book also includes a bonus disc featuring ""The Roundtable,"" an hour-long round table discussion among the four cast and creator Larry David reminiscing about the award-winning show's run on air.",5,One of the cleverest  TV shows ever made now in one boxed set,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,3186,"['Seinfeld', 'can', 'basically', 'be', 'broken', 'three', 'parts', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'where', 'series', 'just', 'finding', 'seasons', 'three', 'seven', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'clicks', 'due', 'cast', 'great', 'on-screen', 'rapport', 'genius', 'Larry', 'David', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'Larry', 'David', 'departure', 'focus', 'shifted', 'somewhat', 'satirical', 'look', 'uglier', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'zany', 'comedy', 'Usually', 'episode', 'was', 'stand-alone', 'fact', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'stand-alone', 'have', 'audience', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'season', 'two', 'Deal', 'Elaine', 'Jerry', 'decide', 'try', 'combining', 'current', 'friendship', 'past', 'sleeping', 'together', 'George', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'mix', 'eventually', 'losing', 'end', 'episode', 'Jerry', 'Elaine', 'pretty', 'much', 'settling', 'other', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'then', 'series', 'just', 'subject', 'whole', 'episode', 'never', 'happened.Occasionally', 'Seinfeld', 'would', 'have', 'story', 'arc', 'sorts', 'example', 'season', 'four', 'show', 'poked', 'fun', 'network', 'television', 'executives', 'decision-making', 'process', 'when', 'George', 'Jerry', 'wind', 'up', 'pitching', 'idea', 'TV', 'show', 'nothing', 'NBC', 'two', 'offer', 'what', 'essentially', 'script', 'widely', 'acclaimed', 'Seinfeld', 'episode', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'network', 'suits', 'are', 'unimpressed', 'alternative', 'George', 'Jerry', 'present', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'judge', 'sentences', 'someone', 'who', 'hit', 'Jerry', 'car', 'be', 'butler', 'time', 'suits', 'are', 'bowled', 'Seinfeld', 'also', 'truly', 'had', 'gift', 'entertaining', 'pushing', 'audience', 'brink', 'offense', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'audience', 'rude', 'obnoxious', 'individual', 'victim', 'immune', 'deficiency', 'disease', 'patient', 'angels', 'usually', 'play', 'role', 'Outing', 'introduced', 'phrase', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', 'also', 'smartly', 'satirized', 'political', 'correctness', 'Junior', 'Mint', 'George', 'familiar', 'form', 'when', 'Jerry', 'not', 'intervene', 'save', 'artist', 'life', 'would', 'devalue', 'artist', 'paintings', 'purchased', 'anticipation', 'same', 'artist', 'death.The', 'show', 'often', 'absurd', 'impossible', 'group', 'self-absorbed', 'people', 'could', 'carry', 'even', 'pretense', 'multi-year', 'friendship', 'something', 'oddly', 'familiar', 'most', 'least', 'partly', 'great', 'interaction', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'comic', 'straight-man', 'duties', 'depending', 'situation', 'making', 'relationships', 'seem', 'real', 'exaggerated.As', 'far', 'details', 'set', '32-disc', 'two-volume', 'set', 'offering', '180', 'episodes', 'show', 'Official', 'Coffee', 'Table', 'Book', '226-page', 'bound', 'anthology', 'filled', 'photos', 'quotes', 'trivia', 'episode', 'personal', 'reflections', 'Jerry', 'collectible', 'book', 'also', 'bonus', 'disc', 'featuring', 'Roundtable', 'hour-long', 'round', 'table', 'discussion', 'four', 'cast', 'creator', 'Larry', 'David', 'reminiscing', 'award-winning', 'show', 'run', 'air']",Seinfeld: The Complete Series

After all, shouldn't we dislike Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer?  No, the reason we were rapt with their lives is because just like Desi and Lucy mirrored the 1950s, this quartet mirrored the 1990s.  In the 1950s, most people were in a marriage like Desi's and Lucy's. They might have felt like they were in a straightjacket but at least they were fully connected with their extended families and friends. By the 1990s, people were no longer in the straightjacket.  They had their full freedom and could remain as single and unconnected as they wished.  They now wanted perfection before they committed.  Many of them chewed through their entire 20s and 30s looking for the perfection connection or none.  So the quartet of Seinfeld characters rejected everyone but themselves for nine solid years and then ended the show as unconnected as the day the show began.  This show is also genius at zeroing in on the day to day foibles of people.  It also tackles previously taboo areas of sitcoms.  For example, George loses his fiance in this show in a way no one in sitcom history has ever lost a fiance and it is hilarious. Larry David was the genius hand guiding the show but he was infrequently on camera as a character.  However, I loved it when he played Stienbrenner, head of the New York Yankees and George's boss.

I still remember how I became a fan. One evening, my husband and two sons were watching the episode called ""The Rye"", and I stopped, watched for a few minutes, told them to move over - and the rest is history. I fell in love instantly and forever. Since that night, I watched the new episodes and re-runs whenever it was possible and I've become one of the millions of fans of the greatest show about nothing ever written, directed, and produced. In its best episodes, ""Seinfeld"" is perfection that no other show would ever achieve, and there are many great episodes. Even now after all these years I keep asking myself why the show about four rather selfish, ego-centric, immature, often back-stabbing and outrageous characters who are afraid of commitments has been so universally loved and admired? Maybe we can see ourselves in them? Or, the secret to Seinfeld's success was the misanthropic Larry David, the failed comedian but talented writer who uses humor derived from awkward social situations, and his collaboration with Jerry Seinfeld?  Or maybe as a really great work of art, the show defies any explanation? The sitcom has given us so many unforgettable minutes of joy, that it will never be replaced. Even Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David's baby in all its greatness is not as enjoyable as ""Seinfeld.""

1101348,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000VECAEE,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[1, 3]","A funny thing happened with me and Seinfeld.  I never watched the series during its network run, as I really dislike American sitcoms (for obvious reasons) and assumed (badly, VERY badly) that Seinfeld was just like that.  Well, Jerry went on a standup tour a few years after the show went off the air, and my sister had tickets she couldn't use.  She said I could have them for free, so I went.  I had a great time, so I decided to catch up with what I was missing on the TV show.  I managed to catch up within a year or so (that's how much Seinfeld shows in syndication.  I watched 9 years of episodes in a year).  Now I have realised that it is one of the greatest sitcoms ever produced, not only in America, but in the world.Some of my favorite episodes are the following.  I love the Bookman/Tropic of Cancer episode, where Philip Baker Hall (as Mr. Bookman) elevates playing the straight man to an art form.  I love the episode where Susan dies from bad invitations, the Soup Nazi (probably my favorite), and the later episode where Kramer has the old Merv Griffin set in his bedroom and Jerry plays with his girlfriend's toy collection.  Now, the early episodes are the best (as with all sitcoms), and when Larry David left, the series faltered.  It wasn't unwatchable, but there was a sloppiness in the writing, and the acting became very stale and mannered.  Some of the episodes were downright preposterous, such as the rickshaw one, which has to be the worst episode in Seinfeld history.  And I never really liked the final episode.  I felt it was very sloppy, almost like an afterthought, and not particularly realistic, even in the ""Seinfeld universe"", despite it being penned by Larry David himself.  Bringing back all the characters from the show was interesting, but ultimately it seemed too much, and the plotline (that people would actually go to jail for not being good Samaritans) was kind of silly.  And why didn't they bring back Jerry's finance (wonderfully played by Janeane Garofalo) in the final episode?  Who knows?  Maybe she's on the cutting room floor.The series had 4 great main characters, unique, interesting, quirky, but still real and very, very flawed.  Many of the supporting players were brilliant as well.  Jackie Chiles, played by Phil Morris, the constantly put down lawyer, was hilarious.  Newman, played by Wayne Knight, has to be one of the greatest supporting characters in sitcom history.  And Puddy, Elaine's part time boyfriend, played by Patrick Warburton, is also very underrated and it absolutely hilarious in every episode he appears in.  Also Jerry Stiller as George's dad and Estelle Harris as George's mom are brilliant too.The whole series really broke sitcom rules, in that everyone in the series is not a particularly nice person.  They're all flawed, selfish, ignorant, silly, but most of all, human.  And hilarious.  Larry David was the brains behind this series (which you can really feel his absence in the later seasons), and George Costanza IS Larry David (you'll see this after seeing Curb Your Enthusiasm).Despite being a product of the 90's, the show hasn't dated.  It's still fresh and hilarious, like all great sitcoms.I'm glad my sister gave me those tickets, otherwise I would have foolishly ignored this series longer.",5,A funny thing happened.....,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,3290,"['funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'Seinfeld', 'never', 'watched', 'series', 'network', 'run', 'really', 'dislike', 'American', 'sitcoms', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'assumed', 'badly', 'VERY', 'badly', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'just', 'Well', 'Jerry', 'went', 'standup', 'tour', 'few', 'years', 'show', 'went', 'air', 'sister', 'had', 'tickets', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'said', 'could', 'have', 'free', 'went', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'decided', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'TV', 'show', 'managed', 'catch', 'up', 'year', 'so', 'how', 'much', 'Seinfeld', 'shows', 'syndication', 'watched', '9', 'years', 'episodes', 'year', 'Now', 'have', 'realised', 'one', 'greatest', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'produced', 'not', 'only', 'America', 'world.Some', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'following', 'love', 'Bookman/Tropic', 'Cancer', 'episode', 'where', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Mr.', 'Bookman', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'art', 'form', 'love', 'episode', 'where', 'Susan', 'bad', 'invitations', 'Soup', 'Nazi', 'probably', 'favorite', 'later', 'episode', 'where', 'Kramer', 'old', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'set', 'bedroom', 'Jerry', 'girlfriend', 'toy', 'collection', 'Now', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'when', 'Larry', 'David', 'left', 'series', 'faltered', 'was', ""n't"", 'unwatchable', 'there', 'was', 'sloppiness', 'writing', 'acting', 'became', 'very', 'stale', 'mannered', 'episodes', 'were', 'downright', 'preposterous', 'such', 'rickshaw', 'one', 'be', 'worst', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'history', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'final', 'episode', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'sloppy', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'not', 'particularly', 'realistic', 'even', 'Seinfeld', 'universe', 'being', 'penned', 'Larry', 'David', 'Bringing', 'back', 'characters', 'show', 'was', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'seemed', 'too', 'much', 'plotline', 'people', 'would', 'actually', 'go', 'jail', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'Samaritans', 'was', 'kind', 'silly', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'Jerry', 'finance', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'final', 'episode', 'Who', 'Maybe', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.The', 'series', 'had', '4', 'great', 'main', 'characters', 'unique', 'interesting', 'quirky', 'still', 'real', 'very', 'very', 'flawed', 'Many', 'supporting', 'players', 'were', 'brilliant', 'well', 'Jackie', 'Chiles', 'played', 'Phil', 'Morris', 'constantly', 'put', 'down', 'lawyer', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Newman', 'played', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'supporting', 'characters', 'sitcom', 'history', 'Puddy', 'Elaine', 'part', 'time', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'also', 'very', 'underrated', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'Also', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'George', 'dad', 'Estelle', 'Harris', 'George', 'mom', 'are', 'brilliant', 'too.The', 'whole', 'series', 'really', 'broke', 'sitcom', 'rules', 'everyone', 'series', 'not', 'particularly', 'nice', 'person', ""'re"", 'flawed', 'selfish', 'ignorant', 'silly', 'most', 'human', 'hilarious', 'Larry', 'David', 'was', 'brains', 'series', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'absence', 'later', 'seasons', 'George', 'Costanza', 'IS', 'Larry', 'David', ""'ll"", 'see', 'seeing', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', '.Despite', 'being', 'product', '90', 'show', ""n't"", 'dated', 'still', 'fresh', 'hilarious', 'great', 'sitcoms.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'sister', 'gave', 'tickets', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'foolishly', 'ignored', 'series', 'longer']",Seinfeld: The Complete Series

The most unentertaining of the characters is Seinfeld himself, but all the characters get real old real fast.  The material is extremely shallow and directed at those with low IQs.

1101352,A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ,B000VECAEE,Jason Ralsky,"[6, 6]","The Complete Series set for Seinfeld is easily the Ultimate set to own if you are a fan of the show. This set delivers on so many levels it is mind blowing. This easily is the must have set for any Seinfeld fan.Seinfeld was a show that ran from 1990 - 1998 ( 9 seasons ). The show rarely had any sort of storyline in place, and when it did the storyline only ran a few episodes at most. Seinfeld beautifully executed a show basically about NOTHING! That's right. This show is about nothing... otherwise known as ""every day life"". Throw in some extremely well written comedy and very memorable characters, and it is no surprise that this show is up there as one of the great TV classics of all time. All the characters flow so well together, the most ridiculous things could happen and it is just downright hysterical. One of my personal favorites is when Jerry & the gang meet ""Bizarro Jerry"" like Superman and Bizarro Superman.Anyhow, this boxset pays homage to this true classic of a show by going the extra mile with both presentation and quality. There are almost no CONS to this set. The set comes in a large 10.5 inches tall box with a picture of the main cast on the front. Inside the standup case is three items of interest1. Seinfeld: The Coffee Table Book. As seen in Seinfeld, the epic Coffee Table book about Coffee Tables... this book essentially recreates that moment. It is hardbound book (Faux Leather I believe) with gold leaf and etchings on it. Inside is your complete Episode guide(laminated for protection) & a Full color book containing memorable quotes and moments from each episode in the show. It also contains bio's on the cast and a few extras such as letters to NBC about the show.2. ""The Round-Table"" DVD found at the back of the Hardcover book; which is an hour long interview with the cast and creator3. Faux Leather case for Seasons 1-5 & 6-9Each disk has a color image of the staring cast on it and is held in a thin plastic disk-holder. The episodes are arranged by chronological order instead of air-date. Each disk contains additional bonus features; bonus features, alternative takes, etc.As you can see this boxset is truly a COMPLETE edition. There is so much going on here it is amazing. The case and quality of the materials is outside and the set goes above and beyond to satisfy any die-hard fan of the show. The only real negative I see to this entire set is how the DVD's are stored. Each DVD is held in a thin(1/4 inch thick) plastic Disk holder flip book... 8 disks per side. Compared to the rest of the set this just seems very cheap and flimsy; especially after how much quality went into everything else. Despite my concerns, with just a little extra care when removing a disk, the set has held up exceptionally well over the past 2 years I have owned it.OVERALL this set is just magnificent and happens to be the most beautiful DVD boxset that I own. While the price is a bit steep, I feel that this boxset is worth paying the extra $$ for. It truly is a complete set and does the show justice. 5 stars!!!**NOTE: Recently the price fluctuates heavily for this item. Keep an eye on the item and wait for Amazon to hold a DVD blowout sale.

Larry is the key to this show, and as good as Curb can get, George is a better Larry than Larry himself could ever be. There are probably 100 lines from Seinfeld that are instantly recognizable to millions...not that there's anything wrong with that.I guess I've seen every episode of this show at least ten times. When my parents were dying and there was not a damn thing I could do about it, I watched my vhs copies over and over all night, every night, just to remind me that life was still worth laughing at. Sometimes I would get so sad I'd start crying and then something would happen on screen that was so classic that the tears would become tears of laughter as I thought of all the laughs we had as a family. That pretty much defines the power of art to me. For those moments I will always love everything about this show. It is the absurdity of life writ small.The writing is so good, so tight, so funny! The real stars here are the writers, which is as it should be. At first I loved Kramer most, but as time went by I realized that it was all about George. Who hasn't been that egotistical and yet insecure at some point?  Making all of the characters selfish and egocentric and yet lovable says it all about modern America. We are a consumerist nightmare that refuses to step back and see how it is destroying itself and the rest of the world, all in the name of...what?Still, you gotta laugh at it while trying to live your own version of a healthy, sane life. That these four goofballs can never quite get it right and yet still laugh so much is always heartening. The consistency is also amazing. There really isn't one bad show, just a few weak ones out of 180. Pretty fine batting average.This is perhaps the best tv series that will ever exist.

1101360,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B000VECAEE,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","Often decried as &#34;a show about nothing,&#34; &#34;Seinfeld&#34; was in fact about life in all its particulars. When most other sitcoms had an overall theme or gimmick, &#34;Seinfeld&#34; focused on the characters and their interactions with each other and the outside world.One criticism was that the characters were too self-centered. The final episode atoned for this, and I use the word &#34;atoned&#34; in the sense of repentance from sin. Stranded in a strange town, they witness a carjacking. Instead of helping the victim, they film the crime, exemplifying Susan Sontag's observation that the photographer can either document events or participate in them, but not both. It turns out that this town has a law requiring anyone witnessing a crime to assist the victim, so Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer are arrested and brought to trial. The prosecution calls as witnesses many of the other characters that the main ones have wronged through the entire series. The series ends with their conviction and imprisonment.It turns out that the show wasn't about &#34;nothing&#34; at all; it was about justice and our responsibility toward other human beings - a weighty topic if there ever was one. And in the end, justice was served. It fulfills the sage Hillel's observation, &#34;If I am not for myself, then who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, of what use am I? And if not now, when?&#34;This ending confused many people, as no one expected a comedy to go out on a downer. But the writers' intentions became clear to me after watching a few episodes of &#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&#34; a creation of Larry David, one of the &#34;Seinfeld&#34; writers. This inescapable sense of justice was the theme of &#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm.&#34; In every show, David tries to get one over on someone - to make a deal, to get something he's not entitled to, to wring a reluctant apology out of someone or avoid giving a much-deserved apology to someone himself. And every time, he gets a karmic payback, even if he doesn't notice.

1101361,A3QPA2Y4CDZUAH,B000VECAEE,"Larry Davis ""powerpoplarry""","[1, 2]","I mean, it has gotten old...OK then, where do I start??  I agree with the prior reviewer who compared Seinfeld to Monty Python...the show is brilliantly-written commentary on New York urban life (more than a bit Jewish, yes, but that only adds to the show's realness), and sublime, anarchic silliness.  Each of the show's 180 episodes are timeless slices of minutae (what the show referred to as ""nothing"") which were relatable at the time of broadcast, can be relatable today and will be 20 years from now, guaranteed.The show's 4 main characters: Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine blended together perfectly, yet each was his/her own distinct person.  I loved how each episode had different subplots that crashed together in unexpected ways at show's end that was both hilarious and satisfying.  Each story was perfectly written and timeless that you can watch again and again without tiring of any...and there are 180 of these...pure gold, seriously.  I don't want to get into each episode because, otherwise, this review would be a ""coffee table book"", if you get my drift.Now, I, like, many others here, started buying all the different seasons...I had the FIRST boxset, of seasons 1-3 (""the giftset you won't re-give/re-wrap"", I forgot the exact wording) with the replica of a script, deck of cool Seinfeld cards, and replicas of the diner's napkin dispenser and ketchup/mustard as salt shakers, all very cool, as well as Season 4 (sold by itself).  The reason why I didn't go further (I almost did) was because I couldn't find the SECOND boxset of seasons 5 & 6 with the replica ""Puffy Shirt"" for a reasonable price, and I didn't want to buy them separately because of the ""puffy shirt""...then I saw 7 & 8 come out separately, with no special box, then Season 9 was about to come out, so I inquired about the possibility of a complete series boxset, thinking, as the individual seasons were a bit pricey, it might not or would be too expensive...Wahey!!!  One did, it looked cool (based on early pics), but the price was like almost $300, so I waited for sales...lo and behold, BestBuy's version was on sale $169.99 (I missed the sale, couldn't afford it that first week), and that FRIDGE REPLICA BOX!!!!  Wow, I couldn't resist, but it sold out everywhere.

I was surprised, since I feel this is a 5 star series.  I thought, perhaps the set is defective or not done right or something, so I read the reviews, only to find out an otherwise 5 star average is brought down because of idiotic winers complaining about having bought the whole series for more already or something.  I'm glad to see some others who have noticed this nonsense, so I'll add my two cents as well...  If you purchased all of the series separately, I would think you would rate this 4 or 5 stars.  Giving it one star because you somehow feel cheated is idiotic and unjust.  That has nothing to do with a review of this set.As others have pointed out, you pays your money, you takes your choice.  You got to watch these as they came out.  Are you sincerely surprised that the price is less now for the whole series?  Wake up!  Nearly every DVD I know of is most expensive when it comes out (excluding sales).  You see, in a free market society, when you sell something, you set your price at market value.  As demand subsides, you lower the price.  I think it's called free enterprise, and is the basis of American marketing.I bought Star wars when it first came out, and now that it's been re-released as a box set, do I give it one star because it's less than I paid?  No!  That makes absoulutely no sense.  There's no reason this box set should be any less than 5 stars, so I had to add my 5 stars to counter these idiots.  What a bunch of winers!

The vast majority of the population knows what Seinfeld is, and likes it a lot.  No need to belabor it.  The important things to know about this DVD set are the following.  The overall presenation is nice, albeit bulky and heavy.  The coffee table book is interesting, but you'll probably never read it or at least not more than once.  The presentation of the DVDs is rather poor, and makes getting to individual episodes a bit tedious.  Finally, and this is the huge problem with this set, the video mastering of the DVDs is horrible.  Now, I know that the source is not the problem here as Seinfeld is currently airing in high definition on cable.  In fact, the channels that air Seinfeld in standard definition look as good if not better than these DVDs.  There is flagrant compression artifacts in the picture, the picture looks very soft, overall tonality and color can best be described as ""dingy.""  It really is a major disappointment if you have any visual scrutiny when watching video.

I especially liked the episodes featuring George's parents and of course any appearance by Newman.  I think my favorite episode was the one in which George acts like he's a fifties high school stud and at the end Mr. Costanza asks Elaine if she wants a peice of him..it is so classic Seinfeld...that and the episode of an arrogant George getting a hairpiece, which Elaine for some reason hates; uh, she always hated it when George was happy.
