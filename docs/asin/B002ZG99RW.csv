We watched this film with a group of friends and it was a really good film to watch with a group of people over the Christmas. The story is quite good and an interesting look at four to five different marriages with their different struggles and triumphs. There was also a surprise twist in the film that kind of caught us off guard. The fact that the film does not actually offer any direct message/advice as to how to make your marriage better, but rather, how to navigate and handle your own marriage problems without comparing yourself to others, was simply brilliant!!! This film is recommended to all married people and those that plan to get married. One final thing, the film shows quite well that what a lot of people think make a marriage work well, such as; lots of money, good status, fantastic job etc., are not in themselves rock-solid, but really life together with each other filled with love is the greatest gift you can ever truly have in a marriage; everything else is a great bonus or a side attraction.",5,Great Follow-up,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1130,"['Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'Too', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'What', 'excellent', 'sequel', 'follow', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'watched', 'film', 'group', 'friends', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'group', 'people', 'Christmas', 'story', 'quite', 'good', 'interesting', 'look', 'four', 'five', 'different', 'marriages', 'different', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'was', 'also', 'surprise', 'twist', 'film', 'kind', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'actually', 'offer', 'direct', 'message/advice', 'how', 'make', 'marriage', 'better', 'rather', 'how', 'navigate', 'handle', 'own', 'marriage', 'problems', 'comparing', 'others', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'film', 'recommended', 'married', 'people', 'plan', 'get', 'married', 'One', 'final', 'thing', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'make', 'marriage', 'work', 'well', 'such', 'lots', 'money', 'good', 'status', 'fantastic', 'job', 'etc.', 'are', 'not', 'rock-solid', 'really', 'life', 'together', 'other', 'filled', 'love', 'greatest', 'gift', 'can', 'ever', 'truly', 'have', 'marriage', 'everything', 'else', 'great', 'bonus', 'side', 'attraction']",N/A

I seriously could not believe this movie and truly wanted to stop watching, but like witnessing a train wreck, I could not pull myself away. Honestly, after the first movie that seemed to end with some redeeming qualities about marriage, I thought this one would continue in the same vein, but this was just a marriage basher. After watching this, why would anyone think marriage is a good thing? Two couples have major trust issues, another one  has a wife on the verge of an affair, and the last one, the Janet Jackson marriage is beyond awful. Her character, which always seemed the somewhat calm one, turns into this raging lunatic who wants a divorce for reasons we never know. All in all, please skip this tragically horrible movie.

Mostly his films are very well made and have good plotlines. WDIGM2 is a sequel to WDIGM and supposedly tries to move the story forward. At the heart of the story is Patricia (Janet Jackson) and her suffering husband Gavin (Malik Yoba). Terry ( Tyler Perry)  who suspects his wife Diane (Sharon Leal) is cheating on him, Angela (Tasha Smith) is convinced her husband Marcus (Michael Jai White), is cheating on her. Sheila (Jill Scott) is now married to former sheriff Troy (Lamman Rucker), having relocated cannot find a job. These suffering couples meet at a marriage retreat in the Bahamas (so lovingly captured ) to reflect on their marriages. Trouble starts when Mike (Richard T Jones), Jill Scotts ex husband arrives. The film follows these couples and their imploding marriages. The actors do a decent job and Janet Jackson is an improvement. Tyler Perry directs and once again does a decent job in making this very predictable tale interesting partly because he is skilled in his craft. Production values are superb but I wish that they had concentrated on the script a tad bit more. On the whole, I enjoyed the movie and yes, there is going to be a sequel.

This movie had everything: laughter; tears; exhileration, education , etc , etc. Janet Jackson came out as an actress in this movie. This is her ""coming out/stepping up"" movie. She did a good job in the first insatllment. She did good in the movie with Eddie Murphy. She had an Oscar nomination worthy performance in this movie. I did not know she had it in her. Everyone else played their parts to perfection, but Janet shines. And I am speaking as someone who has not been a great fan of her acting skills. Janet stretched from every end of the acting spectrum. Jill Scott has become as good an actres as she is a singer. Her character has gained strength , while still vulernable from past pain. She grounds her feet to walk with her new husband, while establishing lines of emotional defense, so as not to be hurt that way again. The test of her ex on h er marriage was done to perfection, with the surprise of his situation at the end making us all turn hate to compassion. Marcus and his crazy wife, Angela, per the first film, provided so much laughter. Whatever fans of Perry were looking for from him, we got it. Whatevery your definition is of marriage and it's trials  were found in this movie, with the exception of a spiritual angle. This movie did not fail with any of my expectations. It reached all goals, which is why I gave it  5 stars. Not that it was Schindler's List, but it was an original sequel that kept my eyes on the screen, waiting for the next comedic, dramatic, heart wrenching moment. There were plenty of characters to root for, get mad at and be surprised at. This movie has it all; a rare sequel that tops the original. Perry reached for the stars  with this one.

Robinson ""Electrojunkie""","[34, 39]","I give this movie 1 star it would have gotten half a star but that is not an option.Tyler Perry's first problem was relying on Janet Jackson to carry the film. She is not the greatest actress in the world and I understand that her brother Michael Jackson died while she made this movie, but still shouldn't have relied on her. Her performance was better in this film than the previous but not by much. In the first film each couple had equal problems and shared equal screen time developing what caused the problems in their marriages. In this film only Patricia/Gavin and Angela/Marcus stories were really developed. The other two couples Troy/Sheila/Mike & Diane/Terry fell flat and not developed like the other two couples.Angela & Marcus: This story was a little inconsistent, Angela blamed Marcus for catching VD when it was her who got VD first. Angela is checking pulse beats, mileage, and how many miles from point A to point B just proves she is too insecure and why is she in the marriage in the first place. She was the one who cheated first from the first film, yet she is harping on Marcus, first she got on to him in the first film for not having a job and now that he has one that pays well she is still unhappy. I don't get it. She needs to go drink herself into kidney failure. Why didn't Marcus call Angela out on her catching venereal disease first, he had to sit there and take her constant verbal abuse. Should have told her to take a midol and shut her loud, obnoxious ass up. She pulls a Patricia and embarrasses him at his job, could have gotten him fired, and she would complain again how he has no job and how it's his fault he got fired.Patricia & Gavin: I guess since Gavin was going to be killed off, he tried to turn him into an ass, didn't work on me. The only wrong he did was burn the baby photos in a drunken stupor. Patricia gives out advice but can't take her own damn advice, did she sit there and write a pro and con list about Gavin since she told Diane and Angela to do that in the first film....hell no she didn't. How the hell can Patricia write a book about marriage and hers was falling apart. Then she announces the divorce in front of her friends without telling Gavin first, just blind sided him with that bit of important news. Patricia keeps everything bottled in and doesn't discuss anything with her husband and you could tell by Gavin's face that he just looked tired. She takes things too far and goes and embarrass the man at his job by having a gay man pop out of a wedding cake and playing ""It's Raining Men."" Sorry but Patricia was being a real bitch with issues. Sorry, wouldn't accept any marriage advice from Patricia yet alone read any of her books. Tyler relied on this story to carry the film but Jackson's acting was a no and all her lines were repeated over and over, sometimes in the same scene, she couldn't say anything else but repeat herself.Terry & Diane: This story was the worst throughout the whole film. Diane is all happy and cheerful because she is having an emotional affair with a co-worker. It was never explained why she leaned on this co-worker and not her husband. It seemed that Terry tried everything to spend time with her and this and that. This story fell flat big time.Sheila & Troy: Another underdeveloped story and a cop out. Why was it hard for Troy to get a job working in law enforcement, he has credentials when he was in Colorado. Then pull a Soul Food scene and have Sheila ask her ex-husband to get her current husband a job. Sheila asks the man that abused her both physically and emotionally to get her current husband a job, that makes no sense whatsoever and definitely a wtf moment. The story should have resolved around Troy adjusting the move from the North to the South and trying to fit in with Sheila's friends, since he left everything in Colorado. Mike having cancer was the biggest cop out I've ever seen.Towards the end in the hospital was just dumb, Patricia telling everyone to fix their problems. Sorry dear, your marriage is screwed and not going to fix anything just cause you say so. One couple were dealing with issues that needed longer to heal that being Terry & Diane dealing with Diane's emotional cheating, cause that's a big thing. The ending was just horrible, yea The Rock makes a cameo, now he's going to be a witness to Patricia's bitchiness so he better get out while he can. She writes a book on healing, healing from what her selfish stank attitude, that caused Gavin to dive head first into traffic. Gavin's death wasn't believable because the driver hit Gavin's passenger side and his car wasn't that damaged. She caused two people in her life to die because of her selfishness.

1313533,A2U2E37IQMBI08,B002ZG99RW,Dr. Feel,"[36, 43]","""Why Did I Get Married Too"" reunites the four couples again for their annual marriage retreat, this time in the Bahamas. It's pretty much the same scenario and plot from the first installment, but this time it's just not that interesting to watch. Sheila's ex-husband shows up alone and unexpectedly to the retreat just to ""diss"" Troy (Sheila's new hubby) and make everyone uncomfortable. Angela is talking trash once again, and provides the most laughable moments. Lou Gossett, Jr. and Cicely Tyson have a cameo appearance as an elderly couple who still love each other after years of marriage. Their story provides probably the only endearing moment of the entire film.Then there's the usual dialogue about marriage - the guy talk, the girl talk, some drinks, some jokes, some insults and then when the couples return home, that's when all of the trouble begins. I won't go into all of the details, but it's just not plausible that four couples, who are friends, would have so much extreme drama going on in their lives at the same time. This movie was just drama for the sake of drama, and it added nothing to the first ""Why Did I Get Married?"" which was an excellent movie. I don't know why Tyler Perry even bothered to make a sequel other than to perhaps keep Malik Yoba employed and to show that Janet's acting skills have slightly improved.Like everyone else, I love Tasha Smith's ""Angela"" character, but she was just way over the top this time. (No man would stay married to a woman who clowns like that in public ALL THE TIME.) The ending was completely unnecessary, considering that this was supposed to be a ""romantic comedy"". It's obvious that TP didn't really know how to end the movie, so he kept piling on more & more drama until he finally ran out of ideas. (For example, showing up clowning on someone's job just to embarrass them after you've already smashed up the crib? Was this necessary?) I was exhausted after the movie ended. Just way too much melodrama within a 2-hour period. Hopefully, there won't be a ""Why Did I Get Married 3?""

I left in a daze and in thought of wow, look what can happen in marriage. Look what can happen when you push people, and when you don't forgive or move on.I am still in thought of this one... It will take some time for it all to sink in.

They are not alike in anyway, and thats the way it should be.  The sequel is three years later with a new couple/new baby, an ex-husband and new circumstances for each couple.  The only real similarities are the problems that existed for some are still there, but thats it.Overall it was a good movie. As much as I like Tasha Smith in the 1st one, she really irritated me in this one.  I could have done without her in many scenes, and much of her scenes were for comic relief, it was over the top this time around.  I really liked Sheila's character this time around as well.  She is definitely more sure of herself, happy being in the place she is in now.  Janet, WOW!!! she really came strong in this,  Two thumbs up for her, and I hope she continues with acting.I also agree with another reviewer about Sheila's husband not being able to find a job as a Cop. Tyler could have done better research on this one, and just gave the man a job, and made his new job more demanding, with long hours, away from his new family, the focus of their issues.  Not being able to find a job as a cop, was just unrealistic.I always thought Janet and Gavin's relationship was more show/fluff and there was something hiding under the surface, but I will not spoil it and leave it at that.Adding the older couple, (Louis Gossett Jr and Cicely Tyson) was brilliant.  They were great together, and told an amazing story of how they met and married!!!If there is going to be a 3rd movie, (the ending makes you think it will be), I would love to see how Sheila and her husbands relationship progresses.Overall it was a good movie, and I plan to buy the DVD.",4,"Could have been better, but overall work seeing and buying the DVD!",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1733,"['Let', '1st', 'start', 'saying', 'people', 'really', 'need', 'stop', 'comparing', '1st', 'movie', 'sequel', 'are', 'not', 'alike', 'anyway', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'sequel', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'new', 'couple/new', 'baby', 'ex-husband', 'new', 'circumstances', 'couple', 'only', 'real', 'similarities', 'are', 'problems', 'existed', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'it.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'Tasha', 'Smith', '1st', 'one', 'really', 'irritated', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'many', 'scenes', 'much', 'scenes', 'were', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'top', 'time', 'really', 'liked', 'Sheila', 'character', 'time', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'definitely', 'more', 'sure', 'herself', 'happy', 'being', 'place', 'now', 'Janet', 'WOW', 'really', 'came', 'strong', 'Two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'hope', 'acting.I', 'also', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Sheila', 'husband', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'job', 'Cop', 'Tyler', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'research', 'one', 'just', 'gave', 'man', 'job', 'made', 'new', 'job', 'more', 'demanding', 'long', 'hours', 'away', 'new', 'family', 'focus', 'issues', 'Not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'job', 'cop', 'was', 'just', 'unrealistic.I', 'always', 'thought', 'Janet', 'Gavin', 'relationship', 'was', 'more', 'show/fluff', 'was', 'something', 'hiding', 'surface', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'leave', 'that.Adding', 'older', 'couple', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'was', 'brilliant', 'were', 'great', 'together', 'told', 'amazing', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'married', 'going', 'be', '3rd', 'movie', 'ending', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'how', 'Sheila', 'husbands', 'relationship', 'progresses.Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'plan', 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A

1313559,AYMVQD757T4ZS,B002ZG99RW,"Kody ""ParisHiltonFan""","[15, 25]","The first installment in this series was decent enough to spark my interest in checking out the sequel. Unfortunately, Why Did I Get Married Too was a sub-par attempt to reprise Perry's previous venture in couples therapy. There were a few redeemable aspects of the movie, namely, some of the characters have been further developed. The new aspects of their relationship dynamics made it interesting to see how their lives have changed. Also appreciated are the moments of bare sincerity in the dialogue. There are a few scenes where a husband and wife could be seen having a believable, vulnerable discussion about the impact of individual choices on their relationship without the bravado of over-the-top displays.Sadly, any redeemable parts of this film were heavily flanked in overwrought dramatic scenes in an effort to create meaningful turning points, and mostly uncomfortable attempts at humor. It's as if Perry thought that hearty laughter from the characters in the more comedic scenes would somehow make the scene funnier; the mission was not accomplished. Also, Perry decided to have the movie be more dependent on Janet Jackson's character as the center pin of the plot, which is an unfortunate shift because she simply doesn't have the skills to deliver. While she is more highly emotive throughout this film, she isn't believable. It just left you feeling uncomfortable watching it happen. To make matters worst, the scene transitions felt abrupt, like you were being yanked by the collar from one end of a room to another.On a more pitiful note, there were several lines and scenes that were way too close to those from the movies Boomerang, Soul Food, and Unfaithful. It's one thing to have a trite storyline; it's a whole other issue when scenes are taken from other movies and executed so similarly to the original that the forerunner immediately comes to the viewer's mind. This kind of poorly-done mimicry leaves you feeling duped by and embarrassed for the person attempting it. The worst part was the ending, which felt rushed and forced. Perry is certainly invested in happy endings, but this was insulting to the characters and the viewers.Overall, the only reason I continued to watch the movie was not because it was in any way worth it, but because I have a sometimes silly desire to finish what I've started. I hope that Perry soon decides to employ screenwriters to broaden the scope of what seems to be a one-man show and production because movie scriptwriting requires a level of skill that he has not yet polished.",1,I've never walked out a movie theater but this movie sucked!,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,2547,"['first', 'installment', 'series', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'spark', 'interest', 'checking', 'out', 'sequel', 'Unfortunately', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'Too', 'was', 'sub-par', 'attempt', 'reprise', 'Perry', 'previous', 'venture', 'couples', 'therapy', 'were', 'few', 'redeemable', 'aspects', 'movie', 'namely', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'further', 'developed', 'new', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'dynamics', 'made', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'lives', 'have', 'changed', 'Also', 'appreciated', 'are', 'moments', 'bare', 'sincerity', 'dialogue', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'husband', 'wife', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'having', 'believable', 'vulnerable', 'discussion', 'impact', 'individual', 'choices', 'relationship', 'bravado', 'over-the-top', 'displays.Sadly', 'redeemable', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'heavily', 'flanked', 'overwrought', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'effort', 'create', 'meaningful', 'turning', 'points', 'mostly', 'uncomfortable', 'attempts', 'humor', 'Perry', 'thought', 'hearty', 'laughter', 'characters', 'more', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'would', 'somehow', 'make', 'scene', 'funnier', 'mission', 'was', 'not', 'accomplished', 'Also', 'Perry', 'decided', 'have', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'dependent', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'character', 'center', 'pin', 'plot', 'unfortunate', 'shift', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'skills', 'deliver', 'more', 'highly', 'emotive', 'film', ""n't"", 'believable', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'happen', 'make', 'matters', 'worst', 'scene', 'transitions', 'felt', 'abrupt', 'were', 'being', 'yanked', 'collar', 'one', 'end', 'room', 'another.On', 'more', 'pitiful', 'note', 'were', 'several', 'lines', 'scenes', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'close', 'movies', 'Boomerang', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Unfaithful', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'trite', 'storyline', 'whole', 'other', 'issue', 'when', 'scenes', 'are', 'taken', 'other', 'movies', 'executed', 'so', 'similarly', 'original', 'forerunner', 'immediately', 'viewer', 'mind', 'kind', 'poorly-done', 'mimicry', 'feeling', 'duped', 'embarrassed', 'person', 'attempting', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'ending', 'felt', 'rushed', 'forced', 'Perry', 'certainly', 'invested', 'happy', 'endings', 'was', 'insulting', 'characters', 'viewers.Overall', 'only', 'reason', 'continued', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'way', 'have', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'desire', 'finish', 'what', ""'ve"", 'started', 'hope', 'Perry', 'soon', 'employ', 'screenwriters', 'broaden', 'scope', 'what', 'be', 'one-man', 'show', 'production', 'movie', 'scriptwriting', 'level', 'skill', 'not', 'yet', 'polished']",N/A

As such, the five husbands and four wives all sounded real and believable as well. Four middle class black families stayed close together and managed to support each other as hard as the fast pace of society could permit. They all shared the temptation of sexual gratification, materialistic satisfaction, and light spirited judgment, despite of their slightly diverse backgrounds.The movie narrates four parallel life stories that shared marriage for convenience.  People who could get jobs, must find a spouse, build home, and have kids.  The new nests that was intended to bring tranquility to life were threatened from inside as well as from outside.  Internally, the mistakes of the individuals' past were lurking inside traumatized souls and would soon return to haunt the individual in similar circumstances to those of his/her past.  Externally, job insecurity and social interaction would impose constant challenges on the marital bond.  Each family struggled with ego, selfishness, and short temper.When money was tight, man's spousal abuse kicked in and split one of the four families.  When money was abundant, jealousy kicked in and occupied an insecure wife to bash her husband to complete submission. When money was not a factor, a well educated attorney aimed for greener grass than hers. When a wife excelled academically ahead of her husband, paranoia and selfishness poisoned the souls that led to loss of life.The fat and least educated wife endured abuse till the bitter end of divorce. Even divorce did not relieve her from her abuser. The obnoxious and nosey wife succeeded with her relentless battles to overwhelm her husband. The most educated wife could not relate to love or settle down before ending the life of her husband. The successful and young attorney wife let her fantasy spoil her intimate ties with her husband.Violence was properly presented, as it would in real life, with the least of exaggeration.  All black and athletic males acted with greater restraints and integrity than the clich&eacute; stereotyping presented in white-dominated movies.  They did not snap, hit, or attack randomly or arbitrarily, but rather reasoned, weighed and made the best decisions.The apparent trend in the scenarios of the four families was the lack of any church activities, the indulgence in travel, fun, and work. Through life tragedies, they learned to let go and tide their lives' harshest episodes for the sake of saving their fragile bonds.",5,As real as it gets: junk bonds.,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,2554,"['have', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'actor', 'movie', 'previous', 'play', 'such', 'five', 'husbands', 'four', 'wives', 'sounded', 'real', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'Four', 'middle', 'class', 'black', 'families', 'stayed', 'close', 'together', 'managed', 'support', 'other', 'as', 'hard', 'fast', 'pace', 'society', 'could', 'permit', 'shared', 'temptation', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'materialistic', 'satisfaction', 'light', 'spirited', 'judgment', 'slightly', 'backgrounds.The', 'movie', 'four', 'parallel', 'life', 'stories', 'shared', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'People', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'jobs', 'must', 'find', 'spouse', 'build', 'home', 'have', 'kids', 'new', 'nests', 'was', 'intended', 'bring', 'tranquility', 'life', 'were', 'threatened', 'inside', 'as', 'well', 'outside', 'Internally', 'mistakes', 'individuals', 'past', 'were', 'lurking', 'inside', 'traumatized', 'souls', 'would', 'soon', 'return', 'haunt', 'individual', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'his/her', 'past', 'Externally', 'job', 'insecurity', 'social', 'interaction', 'would', 'impose', 'constant', 'challenges', 'marital', 'bond', 'family', 'struggled', 'ego', 'selfishness', 'short', 'temper.When', 'money', 'was', 'tight', 'man', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'kicked', 'split', 'one', 'four', 'families', 'When', 'money', 'was', 'abundant', 'jealousy', 'kicked', 'occupied', 'insecure', 'wife', 'bash', 'husband', 'complete', 'submission', 'When', 'money', 'was', 'not', 'factor', 'well', 'educated', 'attorney', 'aimed', 'greener', 'grass', 'hers', 'When', 'wife', 'excelled', 'academically', 'ahead', 'husband', 'paranoia', 'selfishness', 'poisoned', 'souls', 'led', 'loss', 'life.The', 'fat', 'least', 'educated', 'wife', 'endured', 'abuse', 'bitter', 'end', 'divorce', 'Even', 'divorce', 'did', 'not', 'relieve', 'abuser', 'obnoxious', 'nosey', 'wife', 'succeeded', 'relentless', 'battles', 'overwhelm', 'husband', 'most', 'educated', 'wife', 'could', 'not', 'relate', 'love', 'settle', 'down', 'ending', 'life', 'husband', 'successful', 'young', 'attorney', 'wife', 'let', 'fantasy', 'spoil', 'intimate', 'ties', 'husband.Violence', 'was', 'properly', 'presented', 'would', 'real', 'life', 'least', 'exaggeration', 'black', 'athletic', 'males', 'acted', 'greater', 'restraints', 'integrity', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotyping', 'presented', 'white-dominated', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'snap', 'hit', 'attack', 'randomly', 'arbitrarily', 'rather', 'reasoned', 'weighed', 'made', 'best', 'decisions.The', 'apparent', 'trend', 'scenarios', 'four', 'families', 'was', 'lack', 'church', 'activities', 'indulgence', 'travel', 'fun', 'work', 'life', 'tragedies', 'learned', 'let', 'go', 'tide', 'lives', 'harshest', 'episodes', 'sake', 'saving', 'fragile', 'bonds']",N/A

Terry (Tyler Perry) and Diane (Sharon Leal) seem to have bounced back from their previous issues and are devoted parents to their young son and daughter. The loudly overdramatic Angela (Tasha Smith) and Marcus (Michael Jae White) are still fighting, although he's gotten a job as a sportscaster and finally has his act together. Angela is still obsessed with the idea that he's cheating and her irate behind screams out her suspicions to anyone who'll listen. After divorcing her abusive ex-husband Mike (Richard T. Jones), Sheila (Jill Scott) is now married to the more loving sheriff Troy (Lamann Rucker) and the two now have a baby boy. Last but not least are author/professor Patricia (Janet Jackson) and Gavin (Malik Yoba), married for 14 years and viewed as a model for the ""perfect couple"" (of course there's no such thing) among their friends.Instead of going back to Colorado, the gang vacays at a lush Bahamas resort that seems like heaven on earth. Unfortunately, paradise gets ugly with the unexpected arrival of Mike. The unworthy fool wants Sheila back, but girlfriend's havin' none of it! She's not the passive doormat she once was and has no fear in standing up for herself. To make matters worse, Patricia announces to the group that she and Gavin are getting a divorce.Much like the first film, the ish really hits the fan once everyone goes back home. The civility between Patricia and Gavin crumbles once Gavin stakes claim to the money made from her books. Pat's not going down without a fight and things get beyond nasty. Terry suspects his wife of infidelity, a deal between Sheila and Mike threatens to destroy her marriage to Troy, and Angela's antics get even more out of control. Can these couples get it together or will the drama do them in for good?Before I go into the cons, I have to talk about Janet's performance. While the original showcased Jill's impressive acting chops, the sequel is clearly Ms. Jackson's and she shuts it DOWN! Especially once Pat drops her icy ""keep it together although everything's falling apart"" facade and loses her mind. ""YOU WANT CRAZY?! I'LL SHOW YOU CRAZY!!!!"" Her big brother Mike passed away in the middle of shooting and it's clear that the intense scenes were cathartic for her. The pain, anger, and sadness shine through and are at times hard to watch.Now to the not so good things. Way too heavy on the melodrama for my taste. The strength of the first Married was how relatable and believable the issues were and how they were dealt with. This time around it seems like Tyler Perry had more drama than he knew what to do with and didn't know how to go about mending things in a believable way. The scene at the hospital was a poor attempt, I'm afraid. Angela and Marcus' fights were obviously used for comic relief, but didn't we go through all this in the first movie? It's such a retread and a time filler imo.Despite the disappointments, the movie wasn't a total failure. The other cast members did well with their performances and I love Janet's ballad Nothing that's played as a short instrumental throughout the film and heard in full during the credits. The lyrics pull from the story (""Tell me what could the problem be, that's got you drinking way too much"" ....

The real title should be: How does this guy take ten pounds of crap and stuff it into five pounds of movie? WTF was that ending?Good God, this film meandered from the start. It was people sitting around and talking. Then after some airport drama from Angela, going to the Bahamas to TALK SOME MORE. It irks me that in all of Perry's movies he TELLS instead of SHOWS. Hey, aren't people supposed to be DOING things in a movie? Aren't films supposed to be about oh, ACTION? Isn't ACTION supposed to define CHARACTER? That's what I learned from Syd Field and Robert Mckee about screenwriting, but Perry don't know about that because he probably never bought any of these books to learn something about the craft of writing for the screen as opposed to the stage.Man, the writing on this film was SLOPPY, sloppier than previous Perry films. I'm still waiting for dude to learn how to tell a basic story, let alone know how things work ONSCREEN. I'm still waiting for him to learn how to use plot points and use stuff like CONTRAST, IRONY, FORESHADOWING, and SYMBOLISM like Lorraine Hansberry or Spike Lee do in their stories. I'm still waiting for his characters to have some DEPTH and COMPLEXITY. Seriously, a six-year-old could write a better screenplay than Perry, and it would make more sense than anything he puts together in his ridiculous Ed Wood styled plots.I mean, looking at the plotholes in this movie (That ending STILL GIVES ME A HEADACHE:I Love how the guys hooked up with Mike, who shows up out of nowhere.  Shouldn't the timeshare have been settled in the DIVORCE FROM THE LAST MOVIE?Oh and Jill Scott's new husband not being able to find a job as a COP? COME ON!  Civil service jobs are always hiring, even in recessions.  Big cities ALWAYS NEED POLICE OFFICERS to replace retiring ones. The fact that dude had experience in LAW ENFORCEMENT would have been a plus for him. Dude probably would have been selected FASTER than anyone else in pools because of his EXPERIENCE. Blue protects blue, and Blue helps out blue even when it's black. That's the culture of law enforcement. At the least dude would have gotten a Security work or bouncing at a bar. Sloppy writing from Perry there; he should have researched the details. A better plotline would have been about him adjusting to being part of the group. I mean, he's the new guy. He doesn't know these people as closely as they've known each other. Wouldn't they be averse to trusting him or getting to know him better?Angela and Marcus- both these characters were so One-dimensional. If it wasn't for their loud arguing and use as comic relief they'd have no story at all. I love how they never resolve their trust issues and will be back to bicker and act a fool in yet another movie.Gavin being made out to be a heel mid-film. The brotha just wanted to save his marriage and do right by his lady, but he's turned into a monster by Tyler ""Man-hating"" Perry. Hey Tyler, How about some BALANCE to your stories? How about showing the BROTHERS as complex three-dimensional people and not ""good"" or ""bad""? You do know that people have LAYERS and DEPTH to their personalities, and that people have REASONS for the way they act or react.I Love how Pat never dealt with her issues FOR A SECOND MOVIE. But TP needs some drama for Dwayne to NOT deal with in the next installment. Keeps the suckers (I mean fans) coming back to plunk down cash for another installment. The Rock Cameo was just a diversion to deflect us from underdevelopment of the storyline.I Love how Perry's character and his wife never deal with the deeper reasons for an emotional affair. This entire part of the movie was extremely underdeveloped. Perry tells us his wife is glowing; everybody tells us she's happier than she's ever been. Hey Tyler, Instead of having people joking on the beach, how about SHOWING us some frames of her getting things like text messages and pictures in e-mails?  Again, sloppy writing.Seriously, All the characters came out of the movie just like they came in. That's just bad writing all around. Even Ed Wood had some type of change happen to Glen in Glen or Glenda.Hey Tyler, How about you take some of your millions and pick up Syd Field's Screenplay or Robert Mckee's Story and learn something about screenwriting before writing your next movie.",1,Why did I waste $[...] on this crap?,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,4390,"['Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'too', 'More', 'Why', 'did', 'waste', '[', ']', 'watching', 'crap', 'real', 'title', 'should', 'be', 'How', 'guy', 'take', 'ten', 'pounds', 'crap', 'stuff', 'five', 'pounds', 'movie', 'WTF', 'was', 'ending', 'Good', 'God', 'film', 'meandered', 'start', 'was', 'people', 'sitting', 'around', 'talking', 'Then', 'airport', 'drama', 'Angela', 'going', 'Bahamas', 'TALK', 'SOME', 'MORE', 'Perry', 'movies', 'TELLS', 'instead', 'SHOWS', 'Hey', 'are', ""n't"", 'people', 'supposed', 'be', 'DOING', 'things', 'movie', 'Are', ""n't"", 'films', 'supposed', 'be', 'oh', 'ACTION', ""n't"", 'ACTION', 'supposed', 'define', 'CHARACTER', 'what', 'learned', 'Syd', 'Field', 'Robert', 'Mckee', 'screenwriting', 'Perry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'probably', 'never', 'bought', 'books', 'learn', 'something', 'craft', 'writing', 'screen', 'opposed', 'stage.Man', 'writing', 'film', 'was', 'SLOPPY', 'sloppier', 'previous', 'Perry', 'films', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'dude', 'learn', 'how', 'tell', 'basic', 'story', 'let', 'alone', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'ONSCREEN', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'learn', 'how', 'use', 'plot', 'points', 'use', 'stuff', 'CONTRAST', 'IRONY', 'FORESHADOWING', 'SYMBOLISM', 'Lorraine', 'Hansberry', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'do', 'stories', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'characters', 'have', 'DEPTH', 'COMPLEXITY', 'Seriously', 'six-year-old', 'could', 'write', 'better', 'screenplay', 'Perry', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'anything', 'together', 'ridiculous', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'styled', 'plots.I', 'mean', 'looking', 'plotholes', 'movie', 'ending', 'STILL', 'GIVES', 'ME', 'A', 'HEADACHE', 'Love', 'how', 'guys', 'hooked', 'up', 'Mike', 'who', 'up', 'nowhere', 'Should', ""n't"", 'timeshare', 'have', 'been', 'settled', 'DIVORCE', 'FROM', 'THE', 'LAST', 'MOVIE', 'Oh', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'new', 'husband', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'job', 'COP', 'COME', 'ON', 'Civil', 'service', 'jobs', 'are', 'always', 'hiring', 'even', 'recessions', 'Big', 'cities', 'ALWAYS', 'NEED', 'POLICE', 'OFFICERS', 'replace', 'retiring', 'ones', 'fact', 'dude', 'had', 'experience', 'LAW', 'ENFORCEMENT', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'plus', 'Dude', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'FASTER', 'anyone', 'else', 'pools', 'EXPERIENCE', 'Blue', 'blue', 'Blue', 'out', 'blue', 'even', 'when', 'black', 'culture', 'law', 'enforcement', 'least', 'dude', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'Security', 'work', 'bouncing', 'bar', 'Sloppy', 'writing', 'Perry', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'researched', 'details', 'better', 'plotline', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'adjusting', 'being', 'part', 'group', 'mean', 'new', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'as', 'closely', ""'ve"", 'known', 'other', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'averse', 'trusting', 'getting', 'know', 'better', 'Angela', 'Marcus-', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'One-dimensional', 'was', ""n't"", 'loud', 'arguing', 'use', 'comic', 'relief', ""'d"", 'have', 'story', 'love', 'how', 'never', 'resolve', 'trust', 'issues', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'bicker', 'act', 'fool', 'yet', 'movie.Gavin', 'being', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'heel', 'mid-film', 'brotha', 'just', 'wanted', 'save', 'marriage', 'do', 'right', 'lady', 'turned', 'monster', 'Tyler', 'Man-hating', 'Perry', 'Hey', 'Tyler', 'How', 'BALANCE', 'stories', 'How', 'showing', 'BROTHERS', 'complex', 'three-dimensional', 'people', 'not', 'good', 'bad', 'do', 'know', 'people', 'have', 'LAYERS', 'DEPTH', 'personalities', 'people', 'have', 'REASONS', 'way', 'act', 'react.I', 'Love', 'how', 'Pat', 'never', 'issues', 'SECOND', 'MOVIE', 'TP', 'drama', 'Dwayne', 'NOT', 'deal', 'next', 'installment', 'suckers', 'mean', 'fans', 'coming', 'back', 'plunk', 'down', 'cash', 'installment', 'Rock', 'Cameo', 'was', 'just', 'diversion', 'deflect', 'underdevelopment', 'storyline.I', 'Love', 'how', 'Perry', 'character', 'wife', 'never', 'deal', 'deeper', 'reasons', 'emotional', 'affair', 'entire', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'underdeveloped', 'Perry', 'wife', 'glowing', 'everybody', 'happier', 'ever', 'been', 'Hey', 'Tyler', 'Instead', 'having', 'people', 'joking', 'beach', 'how', 'SHOWING', 'frames', 'getting', 'things', 'text', 'messages', 'pictures', 'e-mails', 'Again', 'sloppy', 'writing.Seriously', 'characters', 'came', 'movie', 'just', 'came', 'just', 'bad', 'writing', 'Even', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'had', 'type', 'change', 'happen', 'Glen', 'Glen', 'Glenda.Hey', 'Tyler', 'How', 'take', 'millions', 'pick', 'up', 'Syd', 'Field', 'Screenplay', 'Robert', 'Mckee', 'Story', 'learn', 'something', 'screenwriting', 'writing', 'next', 'movie']",N/A

It was definitely an improvement from the movie version of ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"", however I did feel somewhat disappointed when I left the theatre.There were two things I didn't like about the movie. The first one is Troy's storyline (Sheila's husband) about being unemployed was too similar to the Lem character in ""Soul Food"" and the second thing I didn't like was the ending.I don't want to give the movie away for those of you who haven't seen it yet, so I'll just say the wrong character was chosen for that particular scene. Maybe after you've seen it, you'll agree. Maybe, you won't but I've dealt with something similar and it takes a lot longer than a year to bounce back from that.I do know that all movies don't have a happy ending but that whole scene should have been re-written so that the movie could have ended on a high note.Overall, it was a very entertaining movie and I enjoyed it. I just didn't like the ending, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Also, Janet Jackson acted her heiny off. She has definitely come a long way from ""Poetic Justice.""

Am I glad I saw it? Yes! This is one movie I wouldn't mind seeing again (if only to watch Shelia). Did I expect something different? Yes and no. Did I enjoy the movie? Yes, I'd have to say that I did.  The truth is that it is just a different type of movie. The first movie examined how individuals dealt with the problems in their marriages; the good, the bad and the ugly. And in the first movie, they all had better relationships and a greater understanding of each other as people. Now, the second movie addresses what happens when a relationship breaks down (literally) and how we as human beings learn to cope with the change, hardships and difficulties. See, not bad, but different.I feel the mark of a good movie is when you forget you are watching it, and you get drawn into the story. And let me assure you that this will happen. I will admit that this movie had a lot packed into it, but it gives you a fresh look on how these characters have changed, or not changed, over the three years since the first movie. It is a very emotional ride at times, but it all pays off when Shelia embarrasses Marcus, or when Troy stands up for his wife, and Janet's character really shows her other side.The location for the reunion was absolutely beautiful, and get to see the conversations between the men and the women (in individual groups) and then see how the stories match up as the movie continues beyond the weekend get-a-way. There really is no need to describe the story any further because each person will experience it differently. Personally, I thought the movie began a bit slowly, however when it got to the end, I was happy for the slow parts it gave me time to catch up. Overall: if you like Tyler Perry movies, you should see this movie. It is worth the ride, very enjoyable.",5,Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married Too,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2774,"['Gathered', 'together', 'Bahamas', 'annual', 'one-week', 'reunion', 'four', 'close', 'couples', 'eagerly', 'reconnect', 'sharing', 'news', 'lives', 'relationships', 'intimate', 'week', 'paradise', 'disrupted', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'Sheila', 'ex-husband', 'Mike', 'who', 'break', 'up', 'new', 'marriage', 'Troy', 'win', 'back', 'others', 'soon', 'realize', 'too', 'are', 'not', 'immune', 'challenges', 'commitment', 'fidelity', 'Angela', ""n't"", 'believe', 'husband', 'Marcus', 'can', 'be', 'faithful', 'now', 'celebrity', 'television', 'newscaster', 'Dianne', 'Terry', 'relationship', 'feeling', 'strain', 'raising', 'children', 'Patricia', 'successful', 'self-help', 'psychologist', 'must', 'finally', 'reveal', 'deep', 'flaws', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'Gavin', 'relationships', 'hanging', 'balance', 'when', 'return', 'home', 'couple', 'must', 'choose', 'blame', 'forgiveness', 'doubt', 'faith', 'life-altering', 'consequences.The', 'truth', 'matter', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'Am', 'glad', 'saw', 'Yes', 'one', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'again', 'only', 'watch', 'Shelia', 'Did', 'expect', 'something', 'different', 'Yes', 'Did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Yes', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'did', 'truth', 'just', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'first', 'movie', 'examined', 'how', 'individuals', 'dealt', 'problems', 'marriages', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'better', 'relationships', 'greater', 'understanding', 'other', 'people', 'Now', 'second', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'relationship', 'down', 'literally', 'how', 'human', 'beings', 'learn', 'cope', 'change', 'hardships', 'difficulties', 'See', 'not', 'bad', 'feel', 'mark', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'get', 'drawn', 'story', 'let', 'assure', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'admit', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'packed', 'fresh', 'look', 'how', 'characters', 'have', 'changed', 'not', 'changed', 'three', 'years', 'first', 'movie', 'very', 'emotional', 'ride', 'times', 'pays', 'off', 'when', 'Shelia', 'Marcus', 'when', 'Troy', 'up', 'wife', 'Janet', 'character', 'really', 'other', 'side.The', 'location', 'reunion', 'was', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'get', 'see', 'conversations', 'men', 'women', 'individual', 'groups', 'then', 'see', 'how', 'stories', 'match', 'up', 'movie', 'weekend', 'get-a-way', 'really', 'need', 'describe', 'story', 'further', 'person', 'will', 'experience', 'differently', 'Personally', 'thought', 'movie', 'began', 'bit', 'slowly', 'however', 'when', 'got', 'end', 'was', 'happy', 'slow', 'parts', 'gave', 'time', 'catch', 'up', 'Overall', 'like', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movies', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'ride', 'very', 'enjoyable']",N/A

How if you don't have trust in a marriage makes you very suspicious of everything. What could happen to a marriage after losing a child if you don't deal with it when it happens. What happens when you don't appreciate each other and they start to turn to someone else.
