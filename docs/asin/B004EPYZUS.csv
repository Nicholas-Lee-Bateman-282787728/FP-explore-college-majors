There were very few moments when the speech weas nearly unrecognizable but it wasn't the same like in other Hollywood movies where  it was so awful.

The cast is solid, plot is James Bond good, and there's some interesting scenes and ingenious editing and camera work that dazzles senses and confounds your brain.Mr. Bird is the only director I can think of at this moment that has only done excellent work --and of course all of Bird's previous movies are cartoons! I lovedThe Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)yrs ago.RatatouilleandThe Iron Giant (Special Edition)were directed by this guy.What's funny here is you'd think the director of this insanely action packed thrill ride is a seasoned veteran of this type of thing. In any case I best enjoy action movies precisely as a kind of live action cartoon. IF the action is live and NOT cgi. I'm not a fan of cgi, unless its for a cartoon movie. Most of the action is, well, pretty much ""impossible"". Or HIGHLY unlikely. Which is fine if done well. Causes of typical action flick failure are chronic shaky cam, too many incomprehensible shots and not enough at least somewhat possible or slightly believable action and plot elements mixed w/ the stupid sheer sci-fi/fantasy, excessive reliance on gun fire and explosions that only Beavis and Butthead need to get off.. CGI usually is over-used cause it is cheap and it looks fake so what's the point. And super-annoying music and mediocre acting with rappers spouting trendy slang and actors doing the one liners, the zingers for stupid crowds of teenagers and minorities (trying to be Sean Connery or Schwarzenegger and failing). Really, think Micheal Bay, who is a paradigmatic Hollywood moron movie maker.Anyway so it makes sense Brad Bird whose creative achievements include the action packed superhero animated classic The Incredibles would step-up like a pro.",5,brad bird = winner,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,1817,"['Fun', 'drug', 'Take', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'impossible', 'cartoon', 'action', 'cast', 'solid', 'plot', 'James', 'Bond', 'good', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'ingenious', 'editing', 'camera', 'work', 'senses', 'brain.Mr', 'Bird', 'only', 'director', 'can', 'think', 'moment', 'only', 'done', 'excellent', 'work', 'course', 'Bird', 'previous', 'movies', 'are', 'cartoons', 'lovedThe', 'Incredibles', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'yrs', 'ago.RatatouilleandThe', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Special', 'Edition', 'were', 'directed', 'guy.What', 'funny', 'here', ""'d"", 'think', 'director', 'insanely', 'action', 'packed', 'thrill', 'ride', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'type', 'thing', 'case', 'best', 'enjoy', 'action', 'movies', 'precisely', 'kind', 'live', 'action', 'cartoon', 'action', 'live', 'NOT', 'cgi', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'cgi', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'Most', 'action', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'HIGHLY', 'unlikely', 'Which', 'fine', 'done', 'well', 'Causes', 'typical', 'action', 'flick', 'failure', 'are', 'chronic', 'shaky', 'cam', 'too', 'many', 'incomprehensible', 'shots', 'not', 'enough', 'least', 'somewhat', 'possible', 'slightly', 'believable', 'action', 'plot', 'elements', 'mixed', 'w/', 'stupid', 'sheer', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'excessive', 'reliance', 'gun', 'fire', 'explosions', 'only', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'need', 'get', 'off..', 'CGI', 'usually', 'over-used', 'cause', 'cheap', 'fake', 'what', 'point', 'super-annoying', 'music', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'rappers', 'spouting', 'trendy', 'slang', 'actors', 'doing', 'one', 'liners', 'zingers', 'stupid', 'crowds', 'teenagers', 'minorities', 'trying', 'be', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Schwarzenegger', 'failing', 'Really', 'think', 'Micheal', 'Bay', 'who', 'paradigmatic', 'Hollywood', 'moron', 'movie', 'maker.Anyway', 'sense', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'creative', 'achievements', 'include', 'action', 'packed', 'superhero', 'animated', 'classic', 'Incredibles', 'would', 'step-up', 'pro']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

You know the rest.Without a doubt, this is the best of all the Mission Impossible movies, including the original. Over the years, the MI franchise had become something of a cartoon of itself. So, it seemed appropriate that Brad Bird should be chosen to helm MI4 Ghost Protocol. As the Oscar winning director of the Incredibles, he made animated cartoons seem very real. Now, he's made Mission Impossible real again. He's injected a fresh breathe of confidence, humor and camaraderie into a series that sorely needed it. He's not only re-invigorated the franchise, he's re-invigorated Tom Cruise's career as an action star. With this movie, Tom is back on top.You'll notice that there is a lot of the Incredibles in MI4 Ghost Protocol. That's not only because of Brad Bird's influence, but because the Incredibles was a humorous homage to action films. You could say it's the IMF meets the Incredibles. That is not a deterrent. It's a tribute to a director who can think outside the proverbial action box. This isn't the same old, same old. The movie is much more upbeat and doesn't take itself too seriously. Which works to its advantage.Tom Cruise has never been better. This isn't the brooding Ethan Hunt of previous movies. He's a man on a mission. pardon the pun. To make a complicated story short, the IMF has been shut down and disavowed after a massive explosion at the Kremlin. That explosion is blamed on the IMF. But, it was nothing more than a diversion to steal a nuclear detonator by a terrorist hell bent on ensuring peace on Earth by starting a nuclear war between the super powers. It's up to Ethan, and his cobbled together disavowed team, to hunt down the nuclear terrorist and save the world. simple.Once you have suspended disbelief, sit back and enjoy. The cast is uniformly excellent. Jeremy Renner plays an IMF analyst suit (with more than desk skills at his disposal) reluctantly recruited into the field. Paula Patton is the former team leader of a mission gone bad sent to rescue Hunt. Simon Pegg is back as Benji, the computer/technology genius. While it may seem like he's there just for comic relief, he is an integral part of the team. There are no dull moments. The movie has a quick pace, fun one liners and mind blowing special effects filmed in glorious IMAX. Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner both have sensational action sequences. Tom Cruise isn't the only actor who gets to jump off buildings. And if this movie is any indication, Jeremy Renner is going to make a fantastic Jason Bourne. This wasn't a vehicle for just Tom. Everyone gets a piece of the action. It's a true throw back to the original TV series.and wait until you see the car.

1401264,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004EPYZUS,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 7]","Sadly, ever since Brian De Palma directed the original `Mission: Impossible' film back in 1996, the franchise has taken a nosedive.  The first film was so inspired and so dark; using subtlety in place of over the top action sequences in order to create a truly grounded and organic film.  Sure, there were moments of extreme peril (who can forget that droplet of sweat) and there were extreme action scenes (that helicopter sequence was staggering) but they didn't feel like gimmicks.  Then we had `Mission: Impossible II', directed by John Woo.  This was a straight up action flick with some superb moments, but overall the film ranks second place to its soundtrack, and that is never a good thing.  When I initially saw the J.J. Abrams helmed third installment, I found it compelling and thought for a brief moment that it balanced the stealth of the original with the action of the second rather well.  It has since faded and became, in my esteem, the worst of the franchise, despite a rather devilish turn by Philip Seymour Hoffman.So that brings us to Brad Bird's `Ghost Protocol'.  Yes, that Brad Bird, the guy who directs Pixar cartoons.`Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol' once again feels strained.  The plot itself becomes null and void because it struggles to make sense, and the action scenes are so over the top they can come across bizarre, but what Bird does well here is grapple with the balance of serious and humor that makes the film all the more `fun'.  Maybe this has to do with his grasp of animated fare and the understanding of mood, but I found that this film didn't take itself as seriously as Woo's or Abrams' films and so it felt better on my stomach.  I understand that it is ridiculous, but I embraced it because it wasn't forced down my throat.  The visual effects are amazing, especially that glass building climb sequence, and the sand storm is ravishing (if unnecessary).  The acting is kind of bad, especially Paula Patton who goes all Beyonce at one point and I felt like I was watching `Obsessed', but you aren't watching this for the acting; right?  In the scope of the series, I can't rate this yet.  Initially I'd place it second, but I have a feeling in time it'll fall to third.  The first two films, while wildly different in tone, stick to their strengths.

Great intricate story and spy stuff.Then the second one came along. It's been a while since I saw that one, but the one thing I remember is constantly wondering who will be wearing a mask, revealing they are not who you think they are. Long story short, it was a dumb movie.The third movie brought the franchise back, with J.J Abrams at the directing helm. A much improved movie, although it still lacked the fun of the original.All of that is rectified with Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. Sure, J.J. Abrams still had a role with the movie by producing it, but Brad Bird of Pixar fame was wisely put at the helm to direct. What comes from this is a fun spy movie with a great sense of humor.From the fantastic opening scene (I won't ruin it for you here) where Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt as he should--a smart spy who makes dangerous choices that are to the point of being humourous--to the very end where a frantic entanglement with the enemy takes place, the movie is a load of fun. It brings it back to the glorious days of the original.Although, let's be clear. The original movie is still better. This is a close second.I'm not going to waste this review on telling you the story, as other reviews give plenty of that. I will say that this is a fun movie with great action, spy tactics, and character development. We learn more of Ethan Hunt's character along with the crew he ends up with.

1401304,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B004EPYZUS,Brian Driver,"[0, 1]","I'm old enough to have been a fan of the old Mission: Impossible TV show, when things ALWAYS went according to plan.  Not only did the tactical scheme always go off without a hitch, but the efficiency of the team members never varied, devices worked perfectly, and, heck, Barney the technical whiz never even had a screwdriver slip off the notch.PERFECT - every time.But that stopped in the movies.It angered me in M:I, Movie Number One, when they not only actually had the gall to take a major character from the original series--in fact, the very backbone of it--and ""flip"" him, but they went one step worse: they made the storyline so incomprehensibly jumbled and unclear that what was IMPOSSIBLE about it was trying to comprehending it.Two was better, but it wasn't until M:I Three that they really got the formula right.  And, coincidentally, it was exactly that movie that brought about the arrival of J.J. Abrams, the creator of ""Lost"" and a host of other great projects.  His touch enlivened the M:I series in a manner similar to his reawakening of the Star Trek franchise: his emphasis has always been the development of intriguing characters alongside a compelling story line, and that ""mission"" has been accomplished here.""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is a terrific afternoon film: it does a wonderful job at removing you from the everyday tedium of your own life, convincing you that someone else's problems are worse than yours, and fills the two hours with wall-to-wall action.Now, whether ""M:I-GP"" is believable--that's another discussion point.  But it's like asking an avid football fan whether the Super Bowl is really all it's cracked up to be: it just doesn't matter.What is important is what's before you on the screen, and it's here ""M:I-GP"" excels.  From the opening rooftop shoot-out to the wham-bam finale, this movie really delivers.  There is scarcely enough time between chases and explosions and ingenious devices and lavish set pieces to let you chomp your popcorn or candy.I'm not the biggest Cruise fan out there, and frankly quite often have to overlook his presence in a project before I'm interested in it, but even I have to admit he really delivers here.  He has a commanding screen presence, and combines a cunning, thinks-fast-on-his-feet persona with a healthy dose of big ol' Mark Wahlberg-ish arms and a whole bunch of can-do American earnestness.  He's a force to be reckoned with here, and it's hard not to get behind him.Speaking of behind him, as his backup we have Simon Pegg as the suitably nerdy and usually reliable computer nerd, Paula Patton as the sexy and quite capable fellow agent, and Jeremy Renner as the shaky final member in the quartet who is hiding a compelling secret of his own.The four make up a suitably efficient team that can be both resourceful yet capable of making, if not mistakes, then, well, miscalculations.  So, while it may be true that the M:I of yesteryear is no longer here, what stands in its place is a much more visceral, in-your-face representation of it.  A clever indication of that occurred very early in the movie when, following the obligatory ""this message will self-destruct in five seconds"" pause, Ethan Hunt waits, and waits, and waits some more, then walks back to the device (a Russian pay phone) and thumps it, wherein it finally sizzles and smokes.It's an indication of what's to come, for almost everything that CAN go wrong DOES in this flick, and the film is barely moments old when not only an important agent is offed (Josh Holloway, an Abrams' castaway from the old Lost"" series), the Kremlin is demolished, and the U.S. has been blamed for it.  Likewise, once assigned to the case the steel-jawed Cruise and his able crew fight off power outages, betrayals, a sandstorm, the constant breaking down of equipment, and a never-say-die Russian agent who dogs Ethan Hunt every step of the way.What's important is that ""M:I-GP"" never disappoints, and in fact rewards us like the best of the Bond series with expensive equipment, international scenery, dazzling set pieces, and a series of ""Can you top this?"" stunts that even have Hunt hanging off the ridiculously tall Burj Khalifa building in Dubai--where yes, as usual, Cruise did most of his own stunts.Much of the credit must also go to the excellent work of Brad Bird, who directed not only ""Iron Giant"" but also the terrific ""The Incredibles"" animated movies, the latter of which is the CGI equivalent of any Bond/M:I film out there.  It was Bird's decision to shoot some of the footage in ""M:I-GP"" with IMAX cameras, and it pays off on the screen--this movie is a real beauty to watch.See ""M:I-GP"" if you are looking for some high-octane entertainment: it delivers in every sense of the word.",5,"Cruise is good, and Abrams and Bird are terrific!",1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,4757,"[""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'been',

M:I GP is the latest in the franchise and it's non-stop adrenaline. I saw it on opening night and left happy. On paper, everything about this film looks good. Directed by Brad Bird (Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, all good movies), produced by J. J. Abrams (Star Trek, Super 8, M:I III) and Cruise (you don't need me to list his film creds, do you?), that's one hell of a creative team. I loved M:III and if you thought the action there was intense, the filmmakers turned it up to 12 for Ghost Protocol.They took the best elements of the entire franchise, trimmed off the boring expository bits, boiled down the rest, and gave us pure M:I brain-melting espionage action. There's really not much espionage and cloak and dagger double-crossy trickery going on to confuse thicker moviegoers. They cut to the chase (quite literally) and stick with action. It's a cold open (skipped credits) with a guy busting through the door on the roof, chased by two bad guys armed with SMGs. (We know he's the good guy because he's handsome.) He pulls some kind of button on his chest, jumps off the roof, and kills his pursuers before landing on his inflate-a-pack. This film has all the movie-going goodness you need: exotic international locales, scientifically impossible gadgets, physics defying acrobatics, car chases (and car crashes), foot chases, fisticuffs, guns, stuff blowing up, and stuff blowing up. Excuse me? Oh, I repeated myself? Here, I'll do it again. Stuff blowing up. Lots of stuff blows up. They blow up the Kremlin. The Kremlin!!The film is filled with very likable and excellent actors. The funny, but typecasted Simon Pegg (Star Trek, Shaun of the Dead), Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker), and the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton round out the cast, with Tom Wilkinson making a cameo (one of my favorite actors). Throw in some Russians, Cold War nuclear tech, and a brilliant but insane (and insanely athletic) middle-aged Swedish guy who wants to destroy the world and you've got a story. If that doesn't sound like popcorn munching good times, I don't know what does.As with all action movies, expect ridiculous, over-the-top action and leaps of logic. Why did Agent Hunt have to cut a hole in the tallest building in the world (Burj Khalifa, Dubai), climb on the outside of it unharnessed with Spiderman gloves of questionable reliability to reach a server room 5 stories up and 30 feet across? Because if he took the elevator, you wouldn't pay $10+ to see that. The action is consistent, interrupted at no time for more than several minutes for some story-telling. There's a fight, a chase, or some crazy stunt probably every five minutes, it seemed, along with some bits of understated humor (supplied mostly by Pegg's character). You get to see some fantastic location shots of Moscow, the UAE, and Mumbai (India) for the finale. The aerials over the Dubai desert and approach, for example, I'll probably never see in real life, so it's a treat to see on the big screen. The car at the end of the movie is off the chain (a BMW concept car)!I was thoroughly entertained by this film and enthusiastically recommend it to action fans. Movies aren't cheap in NY ($13.50), but nothing feels quite as bad as wasting not just money, but 2 hours on a bad movie, so I choose what films I watch very carefully.

Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 0]","I have enjoyed Mission Impossible since it was a TV series many years ago and the movies with Tom Cruise have been action thrillers.  The most recent movie Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol has added more comedy and I must say I enjoyed it even more. Simon Pegg was a good choice to add to the MI team.  He can be serious or add comedy to lighten up the mood. My wife, that hasn't cared to review the previous versions, actually said she wouldn't mind seeing this one again.  As always should you accept to watch this movie you should expect lots of action and plenty of stunts.  Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton know how to act and pull off some great scenes. All the cast played their parts very well but Cruise and Pegg will definitely make you want to see it more than once.Spoiler Alert: The story centers around a nuclear terrorist that wants to have a controlled nuclear war to weed out the less fit so that we may improve the natural selection.  In other words another insane arms dealer at least a couple bricks short of a load.  It's too bad they kill off Josh Holloway (Lost) as I think he would have made a good asset to the MI team.  Or is he really dead or just badly injured?  Anythings possible in the movies even if you get six bullets to the chest from a female assassin.  Is Tom's MI wife really dead?  You'll have to see it to the end to know for sure.  Only a few things are certain besides death and taxes when it comes to Mission Impossible. You'll see incredible choreographed stunts, excellent impersonations, hear the Mission Impossible theme, and see a lit fuse before the credits.

There have been four movies in the series and the third installment took the series to a whole new level. The newest installment, ""Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol"" has created a new level on top of that. With complex storylines that intertwine, realistic and jaw dropping action scenes, nicely placed humor and the ability to let the audience play along, MIP 4 may just be the perfect spy movie.When the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is shutdown after being blamed for a bombing at the Kremlin, four agents are forced to work without help in order to clear their name and stop a world-changing catastrophe. Sounds like a tense storyline doesn't it? Well, it is. Every second counts and the movie makes you feel those seconds counting by at every moment and during every task at hand. Everything is nip and tuck and the movie feels that way due to the tight writing and seamless editing.Some of the most awe-inspiring stunts I've ever witnessed are in MIP4. They are so well done and so beautifully shot that there is no suspension of belief to be had. In fact, I'm pretty sure that was Tom Cruise swinging back and forth outside the Burj Khalifa tower, which is the tallest building in the world. The reason why is because it was Tom Cruise doing his own stunts. The actions scenes are real and filmed in a way that isn't hokey and impossible to follow. The car chases are intense. The fights are physical and real looking and don't have shaking cameras to disguise the lack of realism. The action scenes aren't over the top like most block buster movies these days try to pass off in order to please the ticket buyers.""MIP4: Ghost Protocol"" is an exciting and creative movie for anyone who loves espionage type films.

Now they're after a madman armed with Russian nuclear missile codes (which is never a good thing), a true idealist bent on making everyone even...through mass destruction.Brad Bird brings his particular creative genius to the MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE franchise, much as his predecessor J. J. Abrams did for the third installment (Abrams is here as a producer).  The result is a fun romp filled with thrills, chills, and quite a bit of laughter.  (The centerpiece, Hunt hanging off the tallest building in the world, is capped by one of the most well-timed one-liners in recent memory.)  It's more or less what you expect from this series; if you liked the first three (we'll forgive you for not liking the second film, however), you'll like GHOST PROTOCOL.  It's no-apologies-necessary entertainment, plain and simple.  It has the great action sequences, the improbable technology and plot points (only Tom Cruise would drive a convertible at high speed during a sandstorm), that we secretly hope for every time we sit down before an action film.What sets GHOST PROTOCOL above your typical flick of this type is the way it handles its characters and actors.  (For example: when a character's knee is dislocated in a key scene, it STAYS dislocated, and said character is forced to hop around.  You just don't see that in a Schwarzenegger film.)  Tom Cruise is in fine form; he's still doing some of his own stunts, still kicking butt and taking names, and yes, he's still charming as all get out.  Joining him are Simon Pegg (returning from the previous film, with a much larger role), Paula Patton, and Jeremy Renner; each of these supporting characters/actors manages to hold their own and leave their stamp on the film, which isn't easy when you're acting opposite Tom Cruise.  For a villain, we have Michael Nyqvist (from the original GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO films), who doesn't get much to do, save for his final, brilliant, and heart-stopping scene.  There are also a few great cameos, which I won't spoil here; I'll only mention Tom Wilkinson because he was in the trailers, and because it's not easy to upstage Cruise and Renner, yet Wilkinson does so without breaking a sweat.MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL is a slick action movie, another solid entry in a deservedly-beloved series.

Reed,"[1, 2]","When I've told people that I wanted to see this, every single person gave me this weird look, making me say that I am in no way a fan of Tom Cruise, I like these movies because I like the TV series (except for M:I 2). Though the series is better (at least the first five seasons), this one was the best out of the four and I actually liked Tom Cruise in this one. While being the main star of the film, this one brings the team aspect to the forefront, which was never really shown in the previous ones (except M:I 3). Each member of the team is given something to do. The rest of the cast was great as well as the story. Out of the four, the plot of this film reminded me of the series the most; the way the team takes over the hotel by taking over the computer network, changing the floor numbers, etc. The action scenes were great, especially Tom Cruise scaling the building (is it always necessary for him to be climbing or dangling from something in these movies). And, as my title states, this felt more like a James Bond movie than Quantum of Solace (and to a lesser extent, Casino Royale). While the original Mission: Impossible series never featured as many gadgets as the movies have, I feel the films, more or less, still felt like the series (though making Jim Phelps a traitor in the first film is something I still didn't like). Though despite my dislike for Tom Cruise, I actually hope he's involved with a fifth Mission: Impossible. I also find it quite interesting how this fourth film in a franchise  has recieved very positive reviews when other fourth films usually show that the franchise is tired and boring (Jaws: The Revenge, Superman 4, Batman & Robin and Breaking Dawn).",5,This Felt More Like James Bond Than The Last James Bond,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,1696,"['When', ""'ve"", 'told', 'people', 'wanted', 'see', 'single', 'person', 'gave', 'weird', 'look', 'making', 'say', 'am', 'way', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'like', 'movies', 'like', 'TV', 'series', 'M', '2', 'series', 'better', 'least', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'four', 'actually', 'liked', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'one', 'being', 'main', 'star', 'film', 'one', 'team', 'aspect', 'forefront', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'shown', 'previous', 'ones', 'M', '3', 'member', 'team', 'given', 'something', 'do', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'four', 'plot', 'film', 'reminded', 'series', 'most', 'way', 'team', 'hotel', 'taking', 'over', 'computer', 'network', 'changing', 'floor', 'numbers', 'etc', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'scaling', 'building', 'always', 'necessary', 'be', 'climbing', 'dangling', 'something', 'movies', 'title', 'states', 'felt', 'more', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'original', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'series', 'never', 'featured', 'many', 'gadgets', 'movies', 'have', 'feel', 'films', 'more', 'less', 'still', 'felt', 'series', 'making', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'traitor', 'first', 'film', 'something', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dislike', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'actually', 'hope', 'involved', 'fifth', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'also', 'find', 'quite', 'interesting', 'how', 'fourth', 'film', 'franchise', 'recieved', 'very', 'positive', 'reviews', 'when', 'other', 'fourth', 'films', 'usually', 'show', 'franchise', 'tired', 'boring', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'Superman', '4', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Breaking', 'Dawn']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[3, 4]","I gotta admit, after failing to mask my disappointment over the two preceding M:I sequels, I was one reluctant hombre to go see MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE--GHOST PROTOCOL.  I mean, how many times can Cruise's Ethan Hunt have such a brooding, endless, pity party?  Yet I'm happy to report this latest installment is grand fun, and in my humble opine is the best film in the franchise.  Here Cruise ratchets down the gloom and doom and allows his fellow spies (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and a stunning Paula Patton) to play off his antics, as the IMF--ostensibly disavowed by the U.S. government--races furiously to prevent a demented terrorist from launching a global nuclear attack.  From the Kremlin, to the Burj Khalifa Tower in Dubai, to the streets of Mumbai, GHOST PROTOCOL is as fast and as furious as running across a blazing hot street barefoot.  In other words, GHOST PROTOCOL gets up and moves.Cruise is in stellar physical condition, and that's a good thing, because his Ethan Hunt is a whirlwind of kinetic energy; from jumping out of a third floor hospital room, to scaling the Khalifa Tower (more on that later), to driving a car off the top level of a parking garage, Cruise has to rely on his pecs.  And the plot and pacing are just as frantic, making watching this installment a quick view.  Director Brad Bird further enhances the action with eye-popping CGI effects and graphic visuals; this is one finely-crafted action thriller.  The other major players are solid; Renner matches Cruise's physicality, Pegg provides comedy relief, and Patton packs volumes of eye candy.  The rest of the cast is entertaining as well; look for the character actor Tom Wilkinson in a brief, uncredited role.And with my acute acrophobia, naturally Agent Hunt will be forced to scale the outside of the Khalifa Tower to gain access to the building's nerve center--naturally his high-tech gizmo gloves (with the giant sucking sound) will malfunction while Hunt is more than a 1,000 feet in the desert air.  Watching this (through half-closed eyes) I literally become a contortionist in my seat, twisting and squirming to relieve my discomfort.  Normally in scenes such as this I fast forward through the mayhem, but not here; MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE--GHOST PROTOCOL is so darn fun I want to watch every blasted second.--D.

Of course, it features the IMF racing to save the world, using the latest in hi-tech spy gadgets and featuring some mind-blowing action sequences and special effects.  But this one works because the casting is about right.Tom Cruise returns as IMF veteran agent Ethan Hunt, who at the start of the movie must be liberated from a Russian prison by lovely field agent Paula Patton and tech whiz Simon Pegg.  Hunt is needed for a mission inside the Kremlin, which goes badly wrong.  Things get worse when the Secretary really does have to disavow all knowledge, and Hunt goes on the run with the Secretary's twitchy personal intelligence analyst, superby played by Jeremy Renner.  Screen time gets spread around nicely, as each agent gets a chance to contribute to the action.  The team banter provides some humorous breaks, especially the dialogues between Renner and Pegg.  Intriguing side plots add to the suspense.Operating under instructions known as the Ghost Protocol, Hunt and his ad hoc team have to short-circuit an attempt by a Swedish scientist to start a nuclear war.

1401425,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004EPYZUS,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","I honestly didn't know which number sequel this was before watching the 2011 entry into the franchise. In fact, I had only seen the original 1996Mission: Impossibleprior to this viewing and heard rumors that the two previous sequels in 2000 and 2006 were simply retreads of the first movie, which was in itself a reimagining of the popular 1960's TV series, granted an extravagant, multi-million-dollar reimagining directed by Brian DePalma. This one showcases an older yet still agile Tom Cruise returning to the role of intrepid IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even as he closes in on fifty, he demonstrates the same unparalleled commitment to dangerous, high-flying derring-do he displayed in the first one fifteen years ago. This time, the reins have been handed over to Brad Bird who makes his live-action directorial debut after scoring with a couple of Pixar's megahits,The IncrediblesandRatatouille. The results are fortuitous because Bird brings great visual flair to a film that demands gasp-worthy action sequences.In fact, the action is so propulsive that the convoluted plot takes a decided backseat. Written by Andr&eacute; Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, the story feels like a throwback to the days of Soviet spy-versus-spy intrigue and A-bomb secrets. This time, it all revolves around a briefcase with Russian launch codes that are prized by a brilliant Russian madman named Kurt Hendricks, code name Cobalt, who wants nothing less than using them to destroy the world. He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry. The CIA points the finger at the IMF team for the disaster and invokes the dreaded Ghost Protocol.The now-rogue agents make their way to the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, where Hunt has to scale the outside of the building to manipulate the building's computer system. A botched transaction with the assassin leads to mayhem and then a final stop in Mumbai where there is the inevitable race against the clock to save the world. The movie is really all about the set pieces - the Russian prison escape, the Kremlin break-in and explosion (an excellent special effect), Hunt's gravity-defying climb in Dubai and an overwhelming sandstorm, and the movable multi-level parking lot in Mumbai which sets that stage for the final showdown. Performance are secondary in this kind of movie, but they are mostly workmanlike. Cruise is inarguably in his element as an action hero, and he appears to perform most of his death-defying stunts.  Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) also shows the necessary chops as the initially mysterious Brandt, and it is clear he will be playing a larger role in the next installment.Paula Patton, a long way from the inspirational teacher she played inPrecious, brings the requisite sexy strength to Carter, in particular, in a no-holds-barred fight scene with the assassin played by L&eacute;a Seydoux (whom I was surprised to discover is the same actress who played the shy antiques dealer inMidnight in Paris). Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz) initially tries too hard for laughs as Dunn until he finally settles into the film's more tongue-in-cheek tone. Michael Nyqvist only has to convey relentless menace as Hendricks, which he does just fine. Anil Kapoor (Slumdog Millionaire) shows up as a wealthy Indian tycoon, as does Tom Wilkinson quite briefly as the IMF Secretary. The actor who plays the Russian intelligence operative, Vladimir Mashkov, bears such a striking resemblance to SNL's Fred Armisen that for the longest time, I thought it was Armisen in an impressive change-of-pace. Veteran cinematographer Robert Elswit (There Will Be Blood) does excellent camerawork in the various locales - Budapest, Moscow, Dubai and Mumbai.

I give it credit because Cruise shares the scenes and the action with other stars; a strong female lead is allowed to play an expansive part (and does it well); the field agent turned analyst is well played; and the plots moves along without becoming too bogged down.

I personally found MI-II to be disappointing but the team delivered a fine film in MI-III. Well, Ghost Protocol, in my opinion, is the best in the MI franchise yet. Everything from the storyline, action sequences, comedy, cast, and overall production have outdone the earlier films.Ethan Hunt and his crew (a fine cast of Paula Patton, Simon Peg, and Jeremy Renner) are disavowed as the IMF seems pretty much shut down with allegations that they were behind an attack on the Kremlin. The team is out to reveal the truth and stop devastating acts on the part of the villain. The storyline is paced well, with hardly any dull moments. Yes the plot may seem a little unbelievable given its scale and the fact that only one person can orchestrate it all pretty much single-handedly, but that's what such films have been any way - great entertainment albeit with a slightly over the top plot. I view MI to be somewhat (very loosely) of a balance between some over-the-top Bond films (particularly those with Pierce Brosnan) and the hard-hitting Bourne series.The action sequences are the best I have seen so far. For Tom Cruise to actually hang down from the Bhurj Khalifa, admittedly with harnesses, is mind blowing. Most of the film crew refused to go into the room with the open windows since the sheer height made them sick. And for Tom Cruise to actually hang from harnesses outside the building at such a phenomenal height is unbelievable. Kudos to his gusto and nerves of steel.Jeremy Renner (huge fan of his) has delivered a great performance as an agent on Hunt's team. I really hope he is cast in the next mission as well. Benji (Simon Peg) is absolutely delightful and nicely balances the movie with his lighter moments.Overall the MI crew has delivered a fine film in Ghost Protocol. I hope they all come together for the next film in the series as well.

MI 3 was the weakest ans what I thought would be the final entry in the seriers.  Thankfully, Cruise and his production company decided otherwise.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, and finds himself paired with a new team of operatives as he tries to prevent global nuclear war.  The action sequences are top notch, and Cruise handles the part well.  He sells Hunt and the issues that drive him convincingly. This story is also the best in terms of well rounded and fully developed stories.  Cruise also displays an easy chemistry with his new team, particularly Paula Patton.

There was a pretty lousy selection of available Blu-rays, but this one was there, and I figured I'd check it out. Turned out to be a great choice!I've seen the first three movies in the series, and they all were relatively forgettable for me... I don't recall much, other than that they were spy movies featuring Tom Cruise. For Ghost Protocol, the series has made a quantum leap in its production. This is the best action movie I've seen in recent memory, and Cruise is one of those actors who seems to get better with age. Rather than be hampered by his reduced physical abilities (which comes naturally in your late 40s, no matter how hard you work out), he somehow appears more athletic and at ease than ever, and his charisma is on full blast, as per the usual.The audio/video presentation of the disc itself is outstanding, among the best I've seen on Blu-ray. I got sort of queasy  during the Dubai free climbing session, and I was only watching on a 40"" screen... I can only imagine what this must have been like in Imax!The true beauty of this movie, however, is its excellent pacing. It knows exactly what it is, and what it should be doing at all times. This is not a philosophical movie that will make you think real hard, or challenge your views of the universe. It is simply an action vehicle designed to thrill and entertain, and in that regard, it excels. It moves from one great set piece to the next, with just the right amount of dialogue from the characters to create an attachment with the viewer and maintain the sparse plot. It never takes itself too seriously- at one point, Ethan Hunt even makes fun of his own cliched dialogue with an old ally (fans will enjoy that scene).Unless if you are really jaded against the film industry, Cruise, or the series, I feel that you will have FUN watching this movie!

1401460,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004EPYZUS,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","For those of us who didn't see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL on the big screen but bought into the rave reviews that this is the best of all the MI pictures this 4th installment is a big letdown. Brad Bird as director may be part of the problem: his credits prior to this assignment include Up, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, The Simpsons, and such like - films that depend on the animation magic they bring to cute stories but somehow don't transfer well to the use of actors in a `serious' film. Writers Josh Appelbaum and Andr&eacute; Nemec based this script very loosely on Bruce Geller's original television series, but in this film they seem to opt more for inserted comedy lines when there is anything vaguely beyond the minimal conversations that occur. The film is like a ship without a sail and headed in a direction full of sidetracks.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise Production) and his team Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.It all starts in Budapest with the assassination of Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) by Sabine Moreau (L&eacute;a Seydoux), proceeds to a prison breakout (Ethan Hunt has been imprisoned for killing some Serbian guards), the Russian secrets are discovered, aborted plans lead the team form the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours. The movie is fast moving and the booms and blowups and car chases and pyrotechnics and absurdly one-sided fights (yes, the girls get to fight and kill each other) manage to keep our attention because of spectacle. There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on Amazon Instant Video but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie.

This very well may be the most absurd action movie I've ever watched and I've watched some doosies. Sliding down a rope across a street and dropping from 30 feet onto a moving van and then rolling off said van and crashing to the pavement 7 or 8 feet below, but ole Cruise gets up and is perfectly fine with no injuries. Ludicrous. Running down the glass windows of the world's tallest vertical structure with only a rope in your hand to help you. Ridiculous. Crashing a car, at high speeds, into the side of an embankment during sandstorm and not only not getting injured, but the side of the car receiving no damage whatsoever. Not even a scratch or ding. Absurd. Cruise getting his foot caught under a car(car wasn't even moving either) and injuring it and then limping around, but the falling on the van scene I alluded to earlier did nothing to injure him. Preposterous. Or how about about him getting in car and driving it straight off into a 300ft shaft, nose first, and not being knocked out from the airbag deploying upon impact. Oh my. There is no word to describe the absurdity of that scene. The dark haired woman on Cruise's team who tries to seduce the Indian dude is about as seductive as a 500lb woman modeling underwear(the dark haired woman is HOT no doubt, but not convincing in the seduction department). I could go on further with the absurdness, but I think I've made my point. Add to this the lame acting, the even lamer one liners(Simon Pegg in a Mission Impossible movie? Really, Cruise?), and the boring and tedious pacing and plot(lull after lull after lull and a very tiresome and overly used nuclear arms plot... YAWN.), and you've got a movie that if you watch you'll just be CRUISING FOR A BRUISING. Sorry, had to add my own cheesy one liner. Even if you're action movie lover, like me, this is one to stay away from. It stinks from head to toe and I honestly don't where all of the the positive reviews for it are coming from. If this is the best the movie industry has to offer, and we accept it, then the public must be hard-up for movies to watch. Keep giving Cruise $50 million a picture and he'll keep producing garbage like this. Whew, glad I watched this stinker for free...Oh, one last thing. Cruise can run. He run and run and outrun even Forest Gump. I think that's about all Cruise did in the movie(aside from absurd action sequences) is run. I'll bet he spent 10 minutes of actual movie time running.

1401476,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004EPYZUS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL is a perfect popcorn summer movie, never mind that it's coming out in wintertime. It doesn't try to be more than what it is. It harbors no pretense to high-minded Merchant Ivory ideals. It merely wants to entertain the bejesus out of you with a barrage of fun explosive espionage. All it asks is a suspension of disbelief and, since this is Christmas time, accomodating them folks at Bad Robot isn't so far a stretch. This franchise has always been hugely entertaining if you're into crazy cloak and dagger and action sequences contrived with audacity and flair. The stunt crew wore their big boy pants for this one.What mission is so crucial that it requires a languishing Ethan Hunt to be sprung from a Russian gulag? This time out the McGuffin centers around Russian nuclear launch codes and the nuclear extremist codenamed ""Cobalt"" who seeks to make use of them. Ethan, still recovering from his wife's death, is saddled with a new crew. It comprises vengeful-minded operative Jane Carter (Paula Patton, drop-dead gorgeous), new field agent and resident tech-head Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, very funny), and seemingly out-of-his-depth IMF (Impossible Missions Force) chief analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner). It turns out this team doesn't play too well with each other. When the caper in Moscow goes disastrously south - and exploded bits of the Kremlin would attest to how rough it all went - the U.S. President initiates Ghost Protocol which mandates the disavowal of the IMF. Short on support and resources, Ethan Hunt has no recourse but to put on a hoodie and regroup with his newly declared rogue operatives.Brad Bird, who helmed IRON GIANT and THE INCREDIBLES, transitions to live action directing and makes it look easy. Of course, it helps when you have an icon like Tom Cruise headlining the project, but, really, nothing about the production values look cheap. The film makes use of exotic locales as what's left of IMF travels from Budapest to Russia to Dubai to Mumbai. The spy gadgets are cool - the blink-activated eye lens camera, the edifice-scaling suction gloves, the magnetic flotation device, etc. - even if they all almost universally end up betraying their operators. But that's part of the fun. It would be horrid if these spy strategies work seamlessly.I would've loved to have seen more of Paula Patton in action because she seems to have the physicality to sell ""Jane Carter"" as a buttkicking spy. But her much anticipated showdown with the female assassin is a bust. Meanwhile, Simon Pegg can show up on anything and I'll watch it. He's awesome; he never fails to add comedic color. Jeremy Renner does exhibit several wicked good moves in various confrontations. Word on the street is that whenever Cruise decides to step down, Renner's set to fill in those shoes. It should be fine, providing you take into consideration that Renner doesn't carry a smidge of Cruise's star wattage.Tom Cruise has mastered the blueprint for playing that relentless, undaunted super-spook. And you have to respect the shape he's in and his nerves of steel because there's no way in the world would I have scaled the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower, only, like, the tallest building in the world (there's some silly plot point about having to access the tower's server room on the 130th floor from the exterior). Cruise performs this stunt himself, and somewhere maybe his stunt double is wiping his sweaty brow in relief. These action set pieces are spectacular stuff. And because it's dull when the super spy is too indomitable, I like the running gag which centers on Ethan Hunt's jumping misadventures; all his desperate leaps end up with his just missing the mark. It's nice to see a chink in his armor. But, holy carp, this guy's pain threshold must be unbelievable. Ethan Hunt takes a hellacious beating in this film that I don't think even wearing a fresh stylish leather hoodie can make up for.",4,"""Light a fuse...""",1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,3947,"['MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'GHOST', 'PROTOCOL', 'perfect', 'popcorn', 'summer', 'movie', 'never', 'mind', 'coming', 'out', 'wintertime', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'pretense', 'high-minded', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'ideals', 'merely', 'entertain', 'bejesus', 'barrage', 'fun', 'explosive', 'espionage', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Christmas', 'time', 'accomodating', 'folks', 'Bad', 'Robot', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'stretch', 'franchise', 'always', 'been', 'hugely', 'entertaining', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'action', 'sequences', 'contrived', 'audacity', 'flair', 'stunt', 'crew', 'wore', 'big', 'boy', 'pants', 'mission', 'so', 'crucial', 'languishing', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'be', 'sprung', 'Russian', 'gulag', 'time', 'out', 'McGuffin', 'centers', 'Russian', 'nuclear', 'launch', 'codes', 'nuclear', 'extremist', 'codenamed', 'Cobalt', 'who', 'make', 'use', 'Ethan', 'still', 'recovering', 'wife', 'death', 'saddled', 'new', 'crew', 'vengeful-minded', 'operative', 'Jane', 'Carter', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'field', 'agent', 'resident', 'tech-head', 'Benji', 'Dunn', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'very', 'funny', 'seemingly', 'out-of-his-depth', 'IMF', 'Impossible', 'Missions', 'Force', 'chief', 'analyst', 'Brandt', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'out', 'team', ""n't"", 'play', 'too', 'well', 'other', 'When', 'caper', 'Moscow', 'disastrously', 'south', 'exploded', 'bits', 'Kremlin', 'would', 'attest', 'how', 'rough', 'went', 'U.S.', 'President', 'Ghost', 'Protocol', 'disavowal', 'IMF', 'Short', 'support', 'resources', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'recourse', 'put', 'hoodie', 'regroup', 'newly', 'declared', 'rogue', 'operatives.Brad', 'Bird', 'who', 'helmed', 'IRON', 'GIANT', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'transitions', 'live', 'action', 'directing', 'look', 'easy', 'course', 'when', 'have', 'icon', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'headlining', 'project', 'really', 'nothing', 'production', 'values', 'look', 'cheap', 'film', 'use', 'exotic', 'locales', 'what', 'left', 'IMF', 'travels', 'Budapest', 'Russia', 'Dubai', 'Mumbai', 'spy', 'gadgets', 'are', 'cool', 'blink-activated', 'eye', 'camera', 'edifice-scaling', 'suction', 'gloves', 'magnetic', 'flotation', 'device', 'etc', 'even', 'almost', 'universally', 'end', 'up', 'betraying', 'operators', 'part', 'fun', 'would', 'be', 'horrid', 'spy', 'strategies', 'work', 'seamlessly.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'action', 'have', 'physicality', 'sell', 'Jane', 'Carter', 'buttkicking', 'spy', 'much', 'anticipated', 'showdown', 'female', 'assassin', 'bust', 'Meanwhile', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'can', 'show', 'up', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'awesome', 'never', 'add', 'comedic', 'color', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'exhibit', 'several', 'wicked', 'good', 'moves', 'various', 'confrontations', 'Word', 'street', 'whenever', 'Cruise', 'step', 'down', 'Renner', 'set', 'fill', 'shoes', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'providing', 'take', 'consideration', 'Renner', ""n't"", 'carry', 'smidge', 'Cruise', 'star', 'wattage.Tom', 'Cruise', 'mastered', 'blueprint', 'playing', 'relentless', 'undaunted', 'super-spook', 'have', 'respect', 'shape', 'nerves', 'steel', 'way', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'scaled', 'outside', 'Burj', 'Khalifa', 'tower', 'only', 'tallest', 'building', 'world', 'silly', 'plot', 'point', 'having', 'access', 'tower', 'server', 'room', '130th', 'floor', 'exterior', 'Cruise', 'performs', 'stunt', 'somewhere', 'maybe', 'stunt', 'double', 'wiping', 'sweaty', 'brow', 'relief', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'spectacular', 'stuff', 'dull', 'when', 'super', 'spy', 'too', 'indomitable', 'like', 'running', 'gag', 'centers', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'jumping', 'misadventures', 'desperate', 'leaps', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'missing', 'mark', 'nice', 'see', 'chink', 'armor', 'holy', 'carp', 'guy', 'pain', 'threshold', 'must', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'hellacious', 'beating', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'wearing', 'fresh', 'stylish', 'leather', 'hoodie', 'can', 'make', 'up']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

One of my dad and I's favorite types of movies to go to are action and espionage, and we of course didn't miss this one in the theater!As far as cast, most of the original cast members did not return in Ghost Protocol, other than of course Tom Cruise.

Anyway, say what you will about Tom Cruise as a person but the man is a great actor and has been in many great films, and this is certainly one of them...he does a great job as usual in this.I was very pleased to see that Simon Pegg was added to the roster as the tech guy...perfect role for him, and I absolutely love him as an actor, ever since Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, and he was phenomenal as the new and younger Scottie in the new franchise of Star Trek movies.  Awesome also was the introduction of Jeremy Renner into the Mission Impossible roster...the man is an absolute action/thriller/espionage genius of an actor and he would have been an obvious choice in my book to play the role he did in this film.

I'd been looking forward to this movie (which was brought to me, happily, by the marriage of Amazon's Prime Instant Video and Roku, which totally rock as a duo), as I'd liked the first three.  However, this was a dreadful disappointment.  Perhaps I should have been forewarned by the fact that the ""Incredibles"" director, Brad Bird, was at the helm, but this was infantile.  I can't count the number of silly things completely wrong with this film.  Tom Cruise runs, as he always does.  His co-stars' dialogue seems to be comprised of what you'd hear in a 6th, or maybe 8th-grade, classroom.  There's lots of ""interpersonal drama,"" as if we all care.  The female costar, who is about Cruise-sized, so, 5'5"" or so, kicks a big bad guy's ass, in hand-to-hand combat; utterly unbelievable.  The only people who could find that scene believable are those who've never been hit.  Simon Pegg is the best thing about the film, and the only remotely natural character.  The other male lead, Jeremy Renner, is actually quite good and FAR more believable than Cruise at the tough-guy routine.  The plot holes are so large you could drive the BMW prototype car that other reviews rave about through them.I'm all for great, silly action films.  I don't mind a lack of believability, generally, but I have to be able to suspend some level of disbelief.  ""Humorously"" bickering co-agents on a critical mission?  Puerile nonsense.  90lb. girl beating up a 220+ lb. guy?  More nonsense.  The  method of breaking into the Kremlin was absurd; Cruise picks a set of handcuff locks with a paperclip (man, is anyone EVER going to get tired of that old cliched device, ever?) and escapes from Russian cops (while being considered a TERRORISM suspect that killed boatloads of people); Russian cops find the ""Secretary's"" car--now, we're talking about a Cabinet-level US Representative, here--and open fire, killing many of the occupants.  Hunh?  Does anyone think that would ever really happen?  Renner's story as to why he's behind a desk is positively the stuff of silly soap operas, (think, ""Twilight"" type depth) and his purportedly heartbreaking ""I could never work in a life-or-death situation again"" should win a Razzie for worst dialogue.  I won't even get into the ridiculous magic climbing gloves for the world's tallest building, or the equally magic physics-busting building entrance.  OR the blown knee that works fine one scene later.  Whoever wrote the ""sandstorm"" scenes has never been in a sandstorm, either (yes, I have).  Overall, as I said, just...silliness personified.

1401495,A330XFRJKS3APU,B004EPYZUS,Igor Biryukov,"[12, 92]","Today, the ruling ideology could be found in the realm of the popular culture, first and foremost the movies. It is easy to dismiss this movie as an innocent light entertainment, but I think it is not that simple. What we are consuming is ideology of a specific kind, an ideology of caricaturing the other cultures, while asserting a dominance of the Western norms. I think ""Ghost Protocol"" incites fear, loathing, and ridicule vis-a-vis the ""Orient"" in a jokey kind of manner.""Orient"" is not a geographical term, but a cultural one. It is a gap that separated ""the West"" form ""the Rest"". The hallmarks are: a reflexive cultural contempt and even mild racism, expressed in patronizing superiority vis-&agrave;-vis other cultures. It has become, with few exceptions, a common thing in the Hollywood today.  For me, as a Russian-American, it looks like Russia has been placed firmly by the Hollywood in the realm of cultural ""Orient"". In this particular film, Russia was portrayed as a backward, dangerous, Byzantine country once more. Starting with the music -- they chose a grim, ominous music for the beginning of the ""Moscow"" scene.A group of likable American spies sent to take down a world-threatening baddie, sort of a ""Consigliery"" to the Russian government. The plot in brief: the crazed Russian wants to incite nuclear war so that the planet may be cleansed and born anew, and he's doing the ""pit two nuclear powers against each other"" gimmick to make it happen. After the spies are implicated in a terrorist attack in Moscow, which destroyed the Kremlin, they went first to Dubai and then to Mumbai to clear their names by catching this guy ""red-handed"".The music, the military uniforms, and all other intangibles - all this suggest to us a militaristic, aggressive, and anti-Western nature of Russia. The crazed Russian politician - curiously -- has a Germanic name ""Kurt"". Thus, the remorseful scriptwriters Nemec and Appelbaum have fused the pre-supposed ""Prussian militarism"", and perhaps quasi-Nazi ideas with the Russian ""Oriental Despotism"" and the ostensible technological backwardness of Russia.That the Russians are backward is emphasized by the clich&eacute; that ostensibly nothing in Russia works (for example, the ""pay-phone"" scene). They also can be easily fooled by Ethan Hunt, could pretend to be a Russian without them noticing it. The ethnic divisions have been exploited once more (why not?) -- between the Russians and Ukrainians, between Serbs and Croats. The spies' helper is Bogdan, which in Russia is considered a Ukrainian name. Tom Cruise was thrown into Moscow prison for, supposedly, shooting six Serbs who ostensibly had been involved in the ""ethnic cleansing"".In my view, there have been three slurring ""shots"" at the Russians: 1] for putting innocent people in prison (the rule of law is absent), 2] for having the nukes which are not secure enough (backwardness), 3] for not having the brains to come up with the devilish scheme themselves (unsophistication). Thus, we are presented with Swedish-German ""Kurt"" who came up with the crypto-fascist idea to clean the Earth form the ""rabble"" using the Russian nuclear weapon. He pulls the strings in Kremlin, not even a native Russian guy.As usual with the Hollywood, all ""Russian"" scenes have been filmed in the Czech Republic. The producers didn't even bother to pick the native Russian speakers. Russian wasn't a native language of the ""Russians"" in prison scene and other ""Moscow"" scenes, except a single person - Vladimir Mashkov who played a Russian secret agent. All this looks and sounds really idiotic and incredibly patronizing. The movie is a collection of disconnected action ""packages"", TV series stitched together with white threads (Moscow-Dubai-Mumbai episodes). Appelbaum and Nemec's script are too jokey without being genuinely funny. In my opinion, they have created a dazzling array of techno-tricks that tries to be funny ""ad nauseam"" while making caricatures of the other cultures.",1,"Showing cultural contempt vis-a-vis ""the Orient""",1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,3991,"['Today', 'ruling', 'ideology', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'realm', 'popular', 'culture', 'first', 'foremost', 'movies', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'innocent', 'light', 'entertainment', 'think', 'not', 'that', 'simple', 'What', 'are', 'consuming', 'ideology', 'specific', 'kind', 'ideology', 'caricaturing', 'other', 'cultures', 'asserting', 'dominance', 'Western', 'norms', 'think', 'Ghost', 'Protocol', 'fear', 'loathing', 'ridicule', 'vis-a-vis', 'Orient', 'jokey', 'kind', 'manner', 'Orient', 'not', 'geographical', 'term', 'cultural', 'one', 'gap', 'separated', 'West', 'form', 'Rest', 'hallmarks', 'are', 'reflexive', 'cultural', 'contempt', 'even', 'mild', 'racism', 'expressed', 'patronizing', 'superiority', 'vis-', 'agrave', 'other', 'cultures', 'become', 'few', 'exceptions', 'common', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Russian-American', 'Russia', 'been', 'placed', 'firmly', 'Hollywood', 'realm', 'cultural', 'Orient', 'particular', 'film', 'Russia', 'was', 'portrayed', 'backward', 'dangerous', 'Byzantine', 'country', 'once', 'more', 'Starting', 'music', 'chose', 'grim', 'ominous', 'music', 'beginning', 'Moscow', 'scene.A', 'group', 'likable', 'American', 'spies', 'sent', 'take', 'down', 'world-threatening', 'baddie', 'sort', 'Consigliery', 'Russian', 'government', 'plot', 'brief', 'crazed', 'Russian', 'incite', 'nuclear', 'war', 'planet', 'may', 'be', 'cleansed', 'born', 'anew', 'doing', 'pit', 'two', 'nuclear', 'powers', 'other', 'gimmick', 'make', 'happen', 'spies', 'are', 'implicated', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Moscow', 'destroyed', 'Kremlin', 'went', 'first', 'Dubai', 'then', 'Mumbai', 'clear', 'names', 'catching', 'guy', 'red-handed', '.The', 'music', 'military', 'uniforms', 'other', 'intangibles', 'suggest', 'militaristic', 'aggressive', 'anti-Western', 'nature', 'Russia', 'crazed', 'Russian', 'politician', 'curiously', 'Germanic', 'name', 'Kurt', 'Thus', 'remorseful', 'scriptwriters', 'Nemec', 'Appelbaum', 'have', 'fused', 'pre-supposed', 'Prussian', 'militarism', 'perhaps', 'quasi-Nazi', 'ideas', 'Russian', 'Oriental', 'Despotism', 'ostensible', 'technological', 'backwardness', 'Russia.That', 'Russians', 'are', 'backward', 'emphasized', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ostensibly', 'nothing', 'Russia', 'works', 'example', 'pay-phone', 'scene', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'fooled', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'could', 'pretend', 'be', 'Russian', 'noticing', 'ethnic', 'divisions', 'have', 'been', 'exploited', 'once', 'more', 'why', 'not', 'Russians', 'Ukrainians', 'Serbs', 'Croats', 'spies', 'helper', 'Bogdan', 'Russia', 'considered', 'Ukrainian', 'name', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'thrown', 'Moscow', 'prison', 'supposedly', 'shooting', 'six', 'Serbs', 'who', 'ostensibly', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'view', 'have', 'been', 'three', 'slurring', 'shots', 'Russians', '1', ']', 'putting', 'innocent', 'people', 'prison', 'rule', 'law', 'absent', '2', ']', 'having', 'nukes', 'are', 'not', 'secure', 'enough', 'backwardness', '3', ']', 'not', 'having', 'brains', 'come', 'up', 'devilish', 'scheme', 'unsophistication', 'Thus', 'are', 'presented', 'Swedish-German', 'Kurt', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'crypto-fascist', 'idea', 'clean', 'Earth', 'form', 'rabble', 'using', 'Russian', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'strings', 'Kremlin', 'not', 'even', 'native', 'Russian', 'guy.As', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'Russian', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'pick', 'native', 'Russian', 'speakers', 'Russian', 'was', ""n't"", 'native', 'language', 'Russians', 'prison', 'scene', 'other', 'Moscow', 'scenes', 'single', 'person', 'Vladimir', 'Mashkov', 'who', 'played', 'Russian', 'secret', 'agent', 'really', 'idiotic', 'incredibly', 'patronizing', 'movie', 'collection', 'disconnected', 'action', 'packages', 'TV', 'series', 'stitched', 'together', 'white', 'threads', 'Moscow-Dubai-Mumbai', 'episodes', 'Appelbaum', 'Nemec', 'script', 'are', 'too', 'jokey', 'being', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'opinion', 'have', 'created', 'dazzling', 'array', 'techno-tricks', 'be', 'funny', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'making', 'caricatures', 'other', 'cultures']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

They even had  a scene when the did the famous Tom C.  fall with the arms at the side.  It just wasn't Tom's character this time.  They need to focus less on Ethan and more on the other characters.  The strength of the original series was the whole crew not just Mister Phelps.  Better scripts less toys.  Oh almost forgot.  I really hate to turn my entire brain off in a movie.  That scene where the show the giant fan for cooling the servers is so much BS.  They would never have one big fan to cool electronics.  They'd have a bunch of little ones.  To me that was like the movie I saw as a kid called Tom Horn.  It was suppose to be in either 19th century or early 20th century Africa and in one scene I saw a 1960's Chevy Impala in the back ground and Jet con trails too.  That is how lame that was for me.

The action sequences are handled very deftly - and there's plenty of them - but the only disappointment is that there's really zero character growth. The Ethan Hunt and team we meet at the beginning of the film is exactly the same as at the end minus the impending nuclear war.The script brings some cartoonish originality to the action and definitely requires the viewer not merely to suspend disbelief but leaving it safely dangling somewhere out of plain sight. There are also enough gadgets to make the average Bond movie look like they ran out of ideas years ago. The plot doesn't make an enormous amount of sense but it hardly matters once you get into the pace.Talking of pace, there's a 5-minute sandstorm sequence which should have been edited out and but it's all forgiven for the adrenalin-fueled run around the world's tallest building. The sequence was enough to give me vertigo and I was amazed that nothing here was green-screened - a tip of the hat to Tom Cruise for being crazy enough to perform his own stunts.The comedy element of the film depends on how much you like Simon Pegg who appears in way too many scenes. Much like fellow British comic Ricky Gervais, his endless capability to play himself from film to film starts to get wearing. In my humble opinion, neither really has the ability to carry themselves in a big screen movie.Ghost Protocol is a fun film to watch and certainly better than most action films I've seen recently.

1401508,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004EPYZUS,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[6, 8]","Tom Cruise is a great movie star. There. I said it. After some thirty years in this business and about twenty-five of those years spent as a bona-fide star, he can still make it work. No matter what you may think of him personally, there is an effortless charm that he brings to almost all of his films. Lately, though, it's been a bit of a slog. With films like KNIGHT AND DAY, VALKYRIE and LIONS FOR LAMBS (Remember that film? Yeah, me neither), he hasn't been packing them in like he used to. Even M-I:3 was considered something of a failure, despite doing over $350 million worldwide. But that's Hollywood for ya: You jump on Oprah's couch and you claim that psychology is a scam, and people look at you differently, even when you're acting. I've loved Cruise's work for decades (except when he's in REALLY lousy films, like COCKTAIL or THE FIRM or VANILLA SKY), and I've admired him when he took risks (like MAGNOLIA and COLLATERAL, even if I don't care for those films). When I heard that he had gotten Brad Bird, the director of Pixar classics THE INCREDIBLES and RATATOUILLE and my favorite hand-drawn English animated film of all time, THE IRON GIANT, I was VERY excited. This is obviously someone who knows extremely creative storytelling, and really knows how to construct a scene. But it was also his first live-action film. But with Simon Pegg returning, and new additions like Jeremy Renner, Tom Wilkinson, and Josh Holloway (despite the latter two had nothing more than cameos, really), and with working again with J.J. Abrams who helped revitalize the series with the third film, I still had high hopes.Then the reviews started pouring in.WOW. People were LOVING this film. And by all accounts, they were exactly right to. The film is ear-to-ear grinning and wall-to-wall action. Not the pensive De Palma action of the first film, and not John Woo M:I-2 mega-ultra gunplay action, and not uncomfortably realistic J.J. Abrams action; but like a snowball rolling down a hill, once it starts, it just gets bigger and bigger and then you find yourself at the bottom of that hill and you await the bliss of the impact. Bird lays the hyper-dynamic (and dare I say cartoonish) set pieces piled one on top of another like the most delicious action-adventure cake you've tasted in years. The haters can keep hating on Cruise, but he really makes this film pop just as much as Bird does. His breezy wit and afore-mentioned effortless charm flow during some of the film, but he gets down to business in a big way. One complaint I keep seeing of this film is how unrealistic it is. Guess what? IT'S MISSION &#*%^@& IMPOSSIBLE!! If it were MISSION: POSSIBLE, then I could accept that criticism. This is not HILL STREET BLUES; It's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. It's not supposed to be realistic at all times.This is by far the best of the M:I series, and I hope that Bird and Cruise team up again soon, because that would be another mission I would absolutely choose to accept.",5,The best pure action-adventure in a REALLY long time.,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,2971,"['Tom', 'Cruise', 'great', 'movie', 'star', 'said', 'thirty', 'years', 'business', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'spent', 'bona-fide', 'star', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'work', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'think', 'personally', 'effortless', 'charm', 'almost', 'films', 'Lately', 'been', 'bit', 'slog', 'films', 'KNIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY', 'VALKYRIE', 'LIONS', 'FOR', 'LAMBS', 'Remember', 'film', 'Yeah', ""n't"", 'been', 'packing', 'used', 'Even', 'M-I:3', 'was', 'considered', 'something', 'failure', 'doing', '350', 'million', 'worldwide', 'Hollywood', 'ya', 'jump', 'Oprah', 'couch', 'claim', 'psychology', 'scam', 'people', 'look', 'differently', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'acting', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'Cruise', 'work', 'decades', 'when', 'REALLY', 'lousy', 'films', 'COCKTAIL', 'THE', 'FIRM', 'VANILLA', 'SKY', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'when', 'took', 'risks', 'MAGNOLIA', 'COLLATERAL', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'films', 'When', 'heard', 'had', 'gotten', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'director', 'Pixar', 'classics', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'RATATOUILLE', 'favorite', 'hand-drawn', 'English', 'animated', 'film', 'time', 'THE', 'IRON', 'GIANT', 'was', 'VERY', 'excited', 'obviously', 'someone', 'who', 'extremely', 'creative', 'storytelling', 'really', 'knows', 'how', 'construct', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'live-action', 'film', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'returning', 'new', 'additions', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'latter', 'two', 'had', 'nothing', 'more', 'cameos', 'really', 'working', 'again', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'who', 'helped', 'revitalize', 'series', 'third', 'film', 'still', 'had', 'high', 'hopes.Then', 'reviews', 'started', 'pouring', 'in.WOW', 'People', 'were', 'LOVING', 'film', 'accounts', 'were', 'exactly', 'right', 'film', 'ear-to-ear', 'grinning', 'wall-to-wall', 'action', 'Not', 'pensive', 'De', 'Palma', 'action', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'John', 'Woo', 'M', 'I-2', 'mega-ultra', 'gunplay', 'action', 'not', 'uncomfortably', 'realistic', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'action', 'snowball', 'rolling', 'down', 'hill', 'just', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'then', 'find', 'bottom', 'hill', 'await', 'bliss', 'impact', 'Bird', 'hyper-dynamic', 'dare', 'say', 'cartoonish', 'set', 'pieces', 'piled', 'one', 'top', 'most', 'delicious', 'action-adventure', 'cake', ""'ve"", 'tasted', 'years', 'haters', 'can', 'keep', 'hating', 'Cruise', 'really', 'film', 'pop', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Bird', 'breezy', 'wit', 'afore-mentioned', 'effortless', 'charm', 'flow', 'film', 'down', 'business', 'big', 'way', 'One', 'complaint', 'keep', 'seeing', 'film', 'how', 'unrealistic', 'Guess', 'what', 'IT', 'MISSION', '*', '%', '^', '@', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'were', 'MISSION', 'POSSIBLE', 'then', 'could', 'accept', 'criticism', 'not', 'HILL', 'STREET', 'BLUES', 'MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'realistic', 'times.This', 'far', 'best', 'M', 'series', 'hope', 'Bird', 'Cruise', 'team', 'up', 'again', 'soon', 'would', 'be', 'mission', 'would', 'absolutely', 'choose', 'accept']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

If that doesn't sound like a great formula for MI:GP, then break out the AED because you're having heart problems.Brief plot synopsis (potential spoilers):Ethan Hunt was in the Kremlin on a mission when something huge went awry, IMF is implicated because Hunt is seen running (!) from the scene, tensions in the already strained US/Russia relations rise, Hunt and team - Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane (Paula Patton), Benji (Simon Pegg) - go rogue to clear the organization of wrong-doing and save the world from enemy Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) nefarious plans.  So, par for the course when Hunt chooses to accept his mission.Director Brad Bird really nails it in this one.  From beginning (awesome prison break scene) to end (amazing final battle), he brings life back into the MI franchise with a balance between frenetic and suave, putting Cruise in a position to succeed and filling the gaps with a great blend of action equal (Renner), foreboding villain (Nyqvist), gorgeous sidekick (Patton), and comic fodder (Pegg).  What's great, however, is the narrow roles defined for each are easily outdone, as each actor brings so much to their individual character.

1401519,A140XH16IKR4B0,B004EPYZUS,Jean E. Pouliot,"[7, 27]","MI4 is one of the most badly-executed and implausibly-plotted films I have seen in a  long time. The list of gaffes is enormous and ongoing. Two IMF members infiltrate the Kremlin; when a bomb explodes, one barely escapes, but the other one gets out, without explanation, unscathed. When Tom Cruise disguises himself as a Soviet general, his IMF pal says that he looks ""exactly"" like person he is imitating, when he looks only vaguely like his photo. A character falls out of huge skyscraper in Dubai, yet no police arrive to investigate. A character climbs up the outside of the skyscraper in broad daylight, yet no one in the building sees him, and the film does not bother to establish that the place is empty. The IMF team learns its mission to infiltrate the Kremlin barely four hours beforehand, yet happens to assemble a highly technical array of gear designed for that very purpose.Tom Cruise tries hard to give the film some sense of peril by having some of his gadgets malfunction. Yet, again, while a simple reason could be constructed (e.g., equipment damaged in an accident or sandstorm) none is given. We are led to believe the ludicrous possibility that the infallible IMF gives its agents untested and second-rate equipment. Speaking of gadgets, the number of one-of-a-kind, highly sophisticated gadgets that the agents leave behind is astounding. Problem one, they leave behind them a nice trail of computerized gizmos. Problem two, the electronics presumably are classified, and would help the bad guys if discovered. And tell me: why does the head bad guy want to start a nuclear war between the US and USSR? 10 points if you can remember without having to check Wikipedia or IMDB.When the film runs out of gadgets, it relies on glurges to lend itself depth. One agent mopes around, thinking he is responsible for the death of Cruise's wife. Another agent is tormented by the death of a member of her team. C'mon, folks. You are pros in a dangerous game! The after-mission debrief is not only interminable, but dopily misty, formulaic and melodramatic.I could go on. These are not nitpicky issues. Any halfway sophisticated movie watcher is going to wonder how characters know, say, the layout of Kremlin underground passages without seeing them  bone up on it. MI5 does not just stretch credulity, it snaps it and snips it into tiny bits.

I would go so far as to say it's my favorite Tom Cruise flick (followed by ""Interview With The Vampire"" and ""The Last Samurai""). It was certainly leaps and bounds over the three previous MI films in terms of action sequences and the overall ""fun"" factor. The supporting cast gels incredibly well and the addition of Jeremy Renner to the team just adds to that ensemble dynamic.Brad Bird gets a HUGE thumbs up here for his first foray into the live action realm. I've been a big fan of his work (Iron Giant, The Incredibles) and I knew he had great pacing skills...but he's also great at character interaction and dynamics. It's Cruise's movie...but each character in it shines every bit as much as the leading man. Brad Bird is likely responsible for that. The previous films came off as Tom Cruise action vehicles...but Ghost Protocol really is an ensemble piece and plays a lot like ""The Avengers"". As a matter of fact, I enjoyed this one just as much as ""The Avengers"" and, in some aspects, maybe a bit more.If you're an action/stunt afficionado, this is a must see!!

1401560,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B004EPYZUS,Jordan David,"[1, 2]","I am strangely discouraged from writing about the movies that I enjoy the most.  Take, for example, Mission Impossible:  Ghost Protocol.  Having witnessed the film in all of its innocent glory over two weeks ago, I almost gave up on the idea of writing a review for it.  Why?  I have no certain idea.  I suppose that, when it comes to the best, I'm hesitant to express an opinion that is anything but glowing.Well, to stall any doubts, this is a glowing review of a terrific film.  And to think some people had doubts in the mastermind that is director Brad Bird.  Overseer of the Iron Giant, The Incredibles, and Ratatouille, director Bird is almost without equal when it comes to grace and pacing.  He is almost perfect.Still, this was Bird's first attempt at a live-action film, and there were dangers.  Whelp, Bird took care of those quite easily.  Ghost Protocol shares the same whimsical air that all of Bird's magnificent films exude from start to finish; nothing about this film takes itself too seriously.  Predictably, that works for a film that deals with the ""impossible"".  Who would have thought?Each set piece is mashed with a carefree humor that only Bird can properly execute, with dedicated actors Cruise and Renner following along with impeccable style and strenuous physical stunts.  Everyone's clearly on board, and it creates an atmosphere that is completely authentic and exciting.Regarding Cruise:  Say what you will, but he was made for this role.  Handsome, energetic, and finding a perfect parity between humility and outrageous style, Mr. Ethan Hunt is the epitome of hip.  It's even more entertaining to see he and Brandt, Jeremy Renner's character, find equal footing as they pettily argue over matters.  Add the graceful Paula Patton and the always-exceptional Simon Pegg, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a more fitting cast for the best summer blockbuster of the year.Overall, Ghost Protocol takes everything terrific about director J.J. Abrams' third iteration and initiates overdrive.  Nothing is ever stable and, occasionally, things get tangled into implausibility but, being a director of animation, Bird is so often confronted by the impossible that he had mastered the ability to overcome it.

1401566,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004EPYZUS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","I can't say where this latest entry in the Mission: Impossible franchise ranks among the other three, having been too long since I've seen them, but I can say that it's one of the best action movies of the year boasting a stunning collection of extravagant action sequences including at least one that will become iconic. It shows that, just a year shy of 50, Tom Cruise is still more than capable of being the ultimate action star, braver and more dedicated than many half his age. Brad Bird, known for acclaimed and beloved films like The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, makes his live-action debut, bringing an animator's sensibility that I think is at least partly responsible for why these action sequences are so memorable and extravagant. Anything is possible in animation and Bird doesn't allow shooting a live-action film to interfere with this credo. He may have a background in animation, but he obviously knows what makes an action movie work as Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol doesn't rely solely on CGI and the latest technology to make its most impressive sequences come alive. There is CGI of course, but the most impressive action sequence here uses it only to erase the cables and wires used to protect its fearless star. Furthermore, Bird opted to shoot 30+ minutes of footage in IMAX rather than 3D, thank goodness, and he has fashioned a film that continues to impress me the more I think about it.The film opens with two heart-racing action sequences, the second of which involves IMF agent Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) orchestrating a Moscow prison break for Ethan Hunt (Cruise). Once he has escaped, Hunt is immediately put on assignment to infiltrate the Moscow Kremlin archives to assist in identifying a person of interest, code-named ""Cobalt."" Things go wrong on the mission and Russia declares the occurrence as an undeclared act of war, prompting the president to activate Ghost Protocol and effectively disavow the entire IMF. Joined by William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), the IMF secretary's chief analyst, Ethan and his team must stop Cobalt (Michael Nyqvist) from initiating nuclear war with none of the government backing or tools usually afforded to them. Branded as terrorists and with government agencies all over the world after them, they truly find themselves with an impossible mission.These movies are defined by the greatness of their action sequences, which will lead many to brand Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol a great film as each sequence is followed by another with a higher or equal breadth of vision. These sequences are clever, inventive, and frightfully exciting, assembled by people with a true grasp of how to put together action. The scene destined for future icon-status, already the most talked about part of the film, features Hunt, equipped with gloves that adhere to glass, climbing up the glass windows of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. It's common to see a character in an action film scaling a tall building; less common is when the building is the tallest building in the world, the character is more than 100 stories up, the scene is shot on location without green screen, and that's actually Tom Cruise up there instead of a stunt double. How's your masculinity feel now? This is the best action sequence of any film this year and I have complete faith in making that statement without further vertigo that my palms were actually sweating and I breathed a sigh of relief when it was all over. I saw the film on a standard theater screen and was astonished by this sequence, but I would pay full admission price just to see this one sequence alone in IMAX.The Burj Khalifa is the main set piece among additional action sequences that seem equally determined to make an impact. More elaborate and well-executed than what you'll find in most action movies, they don't take themselves too seriously and usually balance suspense and humor in equal measure. The scene in the Kremlin is certainly goofy, but undeniably clever. Renner's big sequence, an idea that had to sound too over-the-top on paper, involves a large spinning fan, a magnet, and a steel mesh suit. It works due to Renner's convincing fear and the even-handed filmmaking. After all these fabulous moments, the final action sequence in a space age, multi-level parking garage that was constructed over six-months solely for this scene may be underwhelming in comparison, but would warrant high praise in any other film.It's written by Josh Appelbaum and Andr&eacute; Nemec, two first-time screenwriters with backgrounds in television. Writing is often overlooked on a blockbuster action picture, but here it's equally responsible for this latest entry in the Mission: Impossible series working so well beyond the awe-inspiring action moments. It functions almost as a direct sequel to the last film and intersperses moments of strong dramatic conflict, allowing the heroes to be human rather than emotionless machines. The dramatic conflict and the comical character Benji may seem a bit formulaic, but it works by using a formula rather than following a formula. The smart script breaks some conventions with Jane, the ""love interest,"" being an agent who is just as smart and capable as those around her and able to hold her own in a dangerous situation. She is there to look sexy too, but her purpose isn't just to share romantic moments with Tom Cruise. In fact, there is no romance between them which makes her seem like an important supporting character rather than the static ""sexy female agent"" character. I don't know how much of Benji results from being played by Simon Pegg, but he works as the comedic foil because he's not over-the-top or preoccupied with inserting witty dialogue into every sentence.The greatest weakness is the main villain, who certainly isn't as interesting as the hero. The idea of starting a nuclear war to initiate the next stage of human evolution is a bit of a stretch for any psychotic villain but, more importantly, he seems less interested in accomplishing these bad deeds than the heroes do stopping him. Nyqvist does a fine job in the role and he has the perfect look and demeanor to eventually play a Bond villain, but his character here lacks a real feeling of purpose and depth.All of the acting is fine, more than adequate for an action film. Patton is convincingly tough, Nyqvist convincingly evil. Pegg isn't too brash or obnoxious as the comedic relief and Cruise is his typical, sensitive but fearless self. It's been said that Renner has been introduced so Cruise can pass the torch when he finally steps away from the franchise and I'll admit that he settles into the role well as he possesses the emotional depth of a real actor and the physical prowess of an action star. I'm not ready to see Cruise step away from this franchise, but Renner could be quite effective in his shoes. He does a particularly good job looking frightened before jumping down a ventilator shaft; I wonder how he would've reacted having to climb the Burj Khalifa.Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a film that you can see without risk. If you disagree with any of the positive elements I've mentioned, you're left with exhilarating action sequences that can't be dismissed. It's a blockbuster action film that intends only to entertain and it succeeds so wonderfully at doing so. People have qualms with Mr. Cruise because of some zany television antics a few years ago and his controversial religious preference, but this is all irrelevant when you get down to the movie and his performance. Few actors bring the amount of dedication and desire to entertain that Tom Cruise does with every film he's in. At 49-years-old, Cruise is still a bonafide action star that can convincingly play a character like Ethan Hunt without resorting to self-deprecating jokes about a receding hairline or high cholesterol. This man works hard in his movies, doing things that some much younger actors would pass on. On a recent television appearance, Cruise was asked why he didn't use a stunt double for the Burj Khalifa scene. ""He was afraid of heights,"" Cruise replied.Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol shows that this franchise and Cruise's star power are far from burning out. With the brilliant creative decision to bring Brad Bird on board, this is a great action picture, more entertaining and creative than most of the blockbuster garbage that's spewed into theaters and gobbled up like fast food by philistines. In an era when filmmakers seem to think that CGI is all that's necessary to make a blockbuster, it's great to see a solid action film using traditional daredevil tactics while utilizing the latest technology to improve on tradition rather than replace it.GRADE: A-",5,A Stunning Action Movie,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,8792,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'where', 'latest', 'entry', 'Mission',

Once you do that, and just go with the flow, it's a pretty good movie for what it is.  It moves so fast that at times it's confusing, but some of the things you can see coming, such as what will inevitably happen in a movie like this when you suddenly find yourself in Dubai, home of the world's tallest building.

Tasker,"[0, 1]","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a rollicking piece of eye candy directed with aplomb by live-action novice Brad Bird, yet it is not without its flaws. Many of the action sequences--including the amazingly inventive and enthralling centerpiece--a risky `secure the macguffin' scene in and around the world's tallest building--absolutely stun. The characters, notably the ever-cheeky Simon Pegg and relative newcomer Jeremy Renner, are highly likable (even Tom Cruise delivers an understated and magnetic performance, despite looking about half-a-year too old for the role). The film is slightly overlong and the plot paper-thin however, which shouldn't be a problem for the adolescent target audience. More or less the objective (should you choose to accept it) is to secure the case. What's in the case? Nuke codes! Why does the villain want them? World domination! Why? Who cares! Can we stop him? Well, we'll sure give it the ol' college try. Boom. Blam. Globe-trotting, fisticuffs, and dandy gadgetry-fueled action sequences ensue. The film is goofy (see the clumsily-animated CGI opening titles), charming (gotta love that theme song, even the tenth time!), and watchable, yet a little too ridiculous from time to time (why does Ethan feel the need to send that car crashing down at the end? Just for the sake of one more explosion?) and overlong by about fifteen minutes. Still, if you are looking for mindless popcorn entertainment, you could do a lot worse. Yes, Michael Bay, I'm looking at you. You could learn a lot from Mr. Bird, who, given a little less puffy of a script, could create great things.

The film managed to poke fun at itself, and at the MI genre, in an affectionate way without becoming a spoof, so we could still take the action seriously. Cruise is in top form here, and his supporting cast holds their own. As for the stunts and filming, these are the best I've seen in an action film in awhile, mostly because they are a cut above in terms of creativity. Shots of Cruise scaling the 'tallest building in the world' in Dubai, or trying to trick a guard at the Kremlin, are innovative and perfectly shot.

His live action directorial feature debut Is amazing. This movie has everything a good film should have. A great story you can't predict, characters you care about, action that doesn't leave you saying.....'these people are not human'....and the panorama of what a big screen film should have. Definitely a must see for good entertainment.Headed by the Tom Cruise Productions and J.J., Abrams' Bad Robot Productions this film is exciting, funny and has a really complicated story that you follow until every twist is untwined. For as much flack as he receives, Tom Cruise does a damn good job in this film. Supported by some great team members including Simon Pegg (`Star Trek' 2009, `Paul', `Hot Fuzz') who provides incredible comic relieve with his techno-genius devices and an unsuspecting female who makes her first official IMF covert mission played by Paula Patton(`Deja Vu, `Precious').Quite by chance the team turns from the usual three person to a four-person team with a not so honest performance by Jeremy Renner (`Hurt Locker', `The Town') as a desk-driven agent who has a deeper secret and more skills than Ethan Hunt (Cruise) was aware of.It also has some great performance by an international cast of people we don't know- but the rest of the world does - including Swedish film star Michael Nyqvist, Russin born film star Vladimir Mashkov, Finnish film star Samuli Edelmann and Russian film star Ivan Shvedoff. I applaud Tom Cruise and J.J. Abrams for bringing some really great talent to the film - giving the Mission Impossible franchise a REAL international flavor. There's even a cameo (returning as his previous character from the last two films) of Academy Award winner Tom Wilkinson.Great action sequences, lots of great cinematography and some breathtaking stunts that would be impossible without special effects and great stuntmen. They shoot an entire amazing sequence one of the largest free-standing buildings on the Asian continent. Burj Dubai, which was started in 2004, overtook Taiwan's Taipei 101 tower as the world's tallest building when it reached 512 metres (1,533 feet) in April 2007.

So when the closing credits rolled - I was speechless. This was absolutely fantastic! Seriously. Just a fun, non-stop, action-pack, well-orchestrated incredible ride. The visual version of a super roller coaster.Believe me, I'm no fan of the man. His antics and questionable mental state are more than just media fodder, but a genuine concern. This kind of aberrant manic mentality and you half expect to hear some version of a building filled with cots, plastic bags and barrels of special Kool-Aid. But the adage learned a long time ago still applies - you have to separate the artist from the art. If you can't, you'll forever cut yourself off from an expanded world; like intentionally blinding yourself for no other reason than selfish indifference and zealotry.Opens with a new team, once again recruited to perform missions that are, if not impossible, so close to it as to be defined as suicidal. We pick up the story from the end of the last film. Ethan Hunt is now in a Russian prison, the reason isn't well known and even his fellow agents have only heard rumors and hushed stories; the truth more complicated than they can imagine. But regardless of his crime, IMF needs their best field agent. Their instructions: Rescue Ethan and give him the single most important mission on the table - prevent Russian nuclear launch codes from reaching the hands of a lunatic who wants to employ them in the name of ""peace"".For this mission he's been assigned two others of complimentary skill sets - technical, linguistics, logistics, and communications. As lead agent, Ethan's job is to secure data from the heart of Russian Intelligence - that's the Kremlin. The equivalent mission would be them stealing into and from CIA Headquarters and The White House combined.Problem is that their IMF mission isn't the only operation being conducted. A simultaneous effort is being run. And their mission is to destroy the same Kremlin records - by destroying the Kremlin itself.Yikes.Guess which team succeeds and which one fails?Ethan and his group are branded international terrorists and mass murderers. Not only are they cut-off from official sanction and support - the entire dark operation, every single IMF agent regardless of status, is now disavowed. They don't exist, have never existed, and will never be acknowledged. Their only hope is to hide, now and forever.'Cept of course the movie would end pretty quickly if that's what IMF personnel did when confronted with hopelessness.Can the team uncover the genuine mission and the true reason why their world has been turned upside-down?Mucho props to his new mates - Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, and amazingly - fresh from his first stint as Jason Bourne's replacement and the newest Avenger: Jeremy Renner.It was kind of weird seeing two lead action actors in the same movie. And that's really one of the big reasons this worked so well - the unconventional balance achieved by Cruise by allowing another to share his spotlight. A genuine shocker, it spoke of craft professionalism and a grounded ego. The latter of which I would have never thought to ascribe to the actor. The fresh interplay between the two plays wonderfully and hilariously throughout the film as Ethan recognizes Agent Brandt as his equal.Finally, I was flabbergasted that this is Director Brad Bird's first major movie with live action. Proof - absolute and incontrovertible - that a good director is a good director regardless of medium. It makes no difference whether you're filming people or moving pieces of computer code around, talent will always be talent. And the multitude of excuses some fans make for ""their"" directors by defending screen failures will always fall on deaf ears to this cinephile.Movie Notes:- Utterly fantastic seeing Josh Holloway as an IMF agent!

1401645,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004EPYZUS,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","There are plenty of films turned into franchises in this world whose end results offer lackluster movies that don't make you want to revisit the characters and events unfolding on screen. And then there are movies like this one that make you wish they'd just get on with it and start filming the next one so you could enjoy it just as much.The film opens with Tom Cruise's character Ethan Hunt in a prison in Russia. His team breaks him out along with a contact he made in prison only to drop him off and then find out what they're next assignment is. Of course it's a near impossible job for them to pull off but that's what they do. A terrorist has the means to launch a full scale nuclear attack on the world if he gets the launch codes. These codes are locked up in the Kremlin and Hunt and his team, should they decided to accept their mission, is to get hold of the launch codes first.Of course they accept the mission. Would there be a film any other way? Using disguises and some nifty new tech toys, Hunt and compatriot Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) make their way into the Kremlin only to discover the codes have already been lifted. Not only that, Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) the terrorist, has set a bomb inside the Kremlin that explodes just as Ethan and Benji attempt to escape.Ethan is knocked out by the bomb and wakes to find himself captive of the police who blame him for the attack. He escapes custody and finds himself picked up by the IMF Secretary (Tom Wilkinson) and his assistant William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). The Secretary tells him he will have to turn him over to the authorities. That is unless he suddenly escapes and heads for a secret train equipped with the tools he'll need to find the real culprits. Of course this mission is off the books and unauthorized which is where the term ghost protocol comes up. Before he can finish, the Secretary is killed in the car and Hunt and Brandt escape to head to the train car where they meet up with Benji and Jane Carter (Paula Patton).Hunt explains the situation to them and offers them the mission. Yes, they accept and things begin to move forward as the team heads to Dubai where they know Hendricks is about to purchase the last of the equipment he needs to launch his attack. In the famous sky reaching hotel located there the assassin who killed the agent with the original codes (and Carter's boyfriend) is about to make her exchange with Hendricks. But the team has a plan to make con both parties and retrieve the information. Of course things don't go as planned and suddenly we get the chance to see Ethan scaling a glass windowed building in an attempt to over ride the hotel elevators.So you get the idea here? To give all the rest away would be to spoil what happens and the thrills and spills that the makers of this film obviously worked long and hard to bring together. The details offered so far are nothing more than the set up that makes the action sequences that follow all that more spectacular. They ruin nothing so don't fear that a spoiler alert was needed. Much of that information could have been gleaned from the trailer.With all the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films the thing is to get into it, to enjoy it, to toss out any concepts of reality and believability and just have a good time. This film offers a fun time at the movies in spades and will make you tear up at the right times, clench your fists when the bad guys seem to get away with things and make your palms sweat as you watch the team almost blow the whole mission on more than one occasion. On top of that you have two underlying stories fomenting beneath the obvious one that wrap themselves into the main plot and then find themselves resolved before the end.One of the best things is that the film ends without a clue as to another film being made or even considered but left open enough that should they decide to do one they can. As a fan of all four films this is once when I hope a franchise does continue. The films have all offered great entertainment value and enough mystery to keep you guessing until the end of each.

Over-the-top action flicks shouldn't take themselves so seriously. This one hits the right balance between suspense and levity. IMF super-agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is incarcerated in Russia for reasons that are unclear -even to the team who springs him. After agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and technical specialist Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) free Hunt, the trio is joined by defense analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Their mission is to infiltrate the Kremlin in search of the identity of a rogue Swedish nuclear strategist now believed to be a terrorist code-named ""Cobalt"" (Michael Nyqvist). But the team is in for a big surprise that causes the US to disavow IMF and the Russians to hunt them down, led by security agent Anatoly Sidorov (Vladamir Mashkov).In today's intimately interconnected world, it's difficult to find palpably exotic locations. ""Ghost Protocol"" takes us to Mumbai and Dubai, where Ethan Hunt performs death-defying stunts hanging from the famous Khalifa Tower. He crawls up the world's tallest building in the world using sticky gloves -which is kind of funny. And it's meant to be. The filmmakers often poke fun at the ridiculously high-tech equipment that the IMF team uses, as it tends to malfunction or simply be impractical. I was annoyed by Agent Dunn's persistent attempts at humor, but the film does some good-natured mocking of itself. It reminds me of an early James Bond film in its high-tech gadgetry and mad genius supervillain. Dunn is a kind of goofy version of Q.

I liked it so much after the first viewing that I viewed it again several more times.  It's hard to understand why Cruise was willing to do those stunts.  I know I wouldn't have been willing no matter what the paycheck looked like.  But they made the movie so exciting, I was on the edge of my seat.

It opens with a tech ally (played by Simon Pegg) helping cruise escape from a highly guarded prison in Moscow. What then follows is his team trying to get the launch codes for a bunch of nuclear weapons from a terrorist (played by Michael Nyqvist), who plans to use them to start World War III.The twists and turns and suprises, as well as the action scenes, are satisfying. Some are believable and some are up for your vote. What did you expect? That's how this series rolls.My favorite scenes were the early prison break out and the mid fight against the female villain lieutenant's character.Also starring Anil Kapoor (that old rogue of sorts who was the TV personality in ""Slumdog Millionaires""), Paula Patton, Josh Halloway (a small role and yes that's the guy from LOST), Lea' Seydoux (the female villain lieutenant) and cameos by Michelle Monaghan and Ving Rhames.This is the fourth installment of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series. Cruise and Pegg are interested in a fifth installment. The budget was $145M and it made over $693M at the Box Office.

But unlike MI 1 or 3 - GP seemed to really bomb out and defined rock bottom - IMHO.Unlike the predecessors, great ""true-to-form"" MI creativity always tightly integrated into an intelligent storyline, seemed to be rather ""cheaply replaced"" by repeated overdoses of over-the-top stunts and special effects.I enjoy the innovative technological aspects typical of MI in general - and honestly, the Blu-ray transfer, audio tracks, and over-all production quality for this one were also quite good.

1401688,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004EPYZUS,M. Oleson,"[6, 9]","Brad Bird steps into the live action arena directing this fourth installment of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.  He is best known for terrific animated classics like ""Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles.""  Let's hope he continues along the path of live action.  I think this is the best action based thriller I've seen all year.  We pick up the story years after IM agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has lost his wife.  He is in a Russian prison and a plan is afoot to break him out.  Why now?  In the opening sequence (shot in IMAX) an IM agent (Josh Holloway) has successfully obtained secret launch codes from nefarious types intent on World destruction.  As he is about to rendezvous with his team he is killed by another assassin.  She escapes with the codes.Hunt is extricated and sent on an impossible mission to obtain confirmation codes from the Kremlin.  In the grand scheme of thing, this isn't all that important.  Following plot protocols that go back decades, American good guys are out to save the world from political zealots.  I'm not minimizing all this.  There must be a story and frankly, this one can actually be followed.  It is all a setup however for some of the best aerial cinema photography ever shot.  While I'm sure CGI was used on occasion, it's not evident.  The stunts sure seem real and let's give some credit to the cast who perform them, especially Cruise who is at the top of his game.  The small 4 person team (now disavowed by the United States) escapes a botched Kremlin theft and chase down the real thief, Hendricks played by Michael Nyqvist (""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"").  Beautiful Paula Patton plays a no nonsense agent Jane Carter.  Simon Pegg as techie Benji and Jeremy Renner as agent Brandt complete the crew and add a bit of tension breaking humor.This leads to a thrilling set of events involving the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the tallest building in the world.  I would suggest seeing this in IMAX will leave you squirming in your seat.  I would also add that while only a few scenes are actually shot using IMAX cameras, they blend seamlessly into those shot in 70 mm.  This film is fast and furious with nonstop action that will leave you invigorated and worn out at the same time. I can't wait to see it again.BLU RAY UPDATE:This is my first viewing since seeing this action thriller on the IMAX screen.  While, it loses a bit of the big screen luster seeing it only on a 63"" plasma there is plenty of movie to keep up with.  The Blu ray transfer is, in a word, spectacular.  Brilliant colors, great detail, dynamic panoramic shots are exemplary.  The audio is a lossless Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and it is equally good.  This movie has sound effects that range from soft electronic hums to chaotic action sequences and a massive sand storm.  It's all good.",4,4 1/2 stars for the best action film of the year + Blu ray update,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,2824,"['Brad', 'Bird', 'live', 'action', 'arena', 'directing', 'fourth', 'installment', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'franchise', 'best', 'known', 'terrific', 'animated', 'classics', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Incredibles', 'Let', 'hope', 'path', 'live', 'action', 'think', 'best', 'action', 'based', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'pick', 'up', 'story', 'years', 'IM', 'agent', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'lost', 'wife', 'Russian', 'prison', 'plan', 'afoot', 'break', 'out', 'Why', 'now', 'opening', 'sequence', 'shot', 'IMAX', 'IM', 'agent', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'successfully', 'obtained', 'secret', 'launch', 'codes', 'nefarious', 'types', 'intent', 'World', 'destruction', 'rendezvous', 'team', 'killed', 'assassin', 'codes.Hunt', 'extricated', 'sent', 'impossible', 'mission', 'obtain', 'confirmation', 'codes', 'Kremlin', 'grand', 'scheme', 'thing', ""n't"", 'important', 'Following', 'plot', 'protocols', 'go', 'back', 'decades', 'American', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'save', 'world', 'political', 'zealots', ""'m"", 'not', 'minimizing', 'must', 'be', 'story', 'frankly', 'one', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'followed', 'setup', 'however', 'best', 'aerial', 'cinema', 'photography', 'ever', 'shot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'CGI', 'was', 'used', 'occasion', 'not', 'evident', 'stunts', 'sure', 'seem', 'real', 'let', 'give', 'credit', 'cast', 'who', 'perform', 'especially', 'Cruise', 'who', 'top', 'game', 'small', '4', 'person', 'team', 'now', 'disavowed', 'United', 'States', 'botched', 'Kremlin', 'theft', 'chase', 'down', 'real', 'thief', 'Hendricks', 'played', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Beautiful', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'nonsense', 'agent', 'Jane', 'Carter', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'techie', 'Benji', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'agent', 'Brandt', 'complete', 'crew', 'add', 'bit', 'tension', 'breaking', 'humor.This', 'thrilling', 'set', 'events', 'involving', 'Burj', 'Khalifa', 'Dubai', 'United', 'Arab', 'Emirates', 'tallest', 'building', 'world', 'would', 'suggest', 'seeing', 'IMAX', 'will', 'leave', 'squirming', 'seat', 'would', 'also', 'add', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'shot', 'using', 'IMAX', 'cameras', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'shot', '70', 'mm', 'film', 'fast', 'furious', 'nonstop', 'action', 'will', 'leave', 'invigorated', 'worn', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again.BLU', 'RAY', 'UPDATE', 'first', 'viewing', 'seeing', 'action', 'thriller', 'IMAX', 'screen', 'bit', 'big', 'screen', 'luster', 'seeing', 'only', '63', 'plasma', 'plenty', 'movie', 'keep', 'up', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'word', 'spectacular', 'Brilliant', 'colors', 'great', 'detail', 'dynamic', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'are', 'exemplary', 'audio', 'lossless', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '7.1', 'equally', 'good', 'movie', 'sound', 'effects', 'range', 'soft', 'electronic', 'hums', 'chaotic', 'action', 'sequences', 'massive', 'sand', 'storm', 'good']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

I don't trust previews as a rule. Sometimes there's no more action than what you've just seen. In Ghost Protocol that's impossible! I watched the video on my laptop but I was in the movie. I kept leaning toward the screen, motioning with my hands, reacting, reacting, reacting so involved my legs didn't have time to turn to jelly as I was running down the side of the tallest building in the world in Dubai with Tom Cruise. He was exhausted, he kept going; I couldn't let exhaustion get the better of me, I had to keep watching. His team weren't supermen, excuse me, superpersons - there was one female but they did incredible things almost leaping tall buildings at a single bound. They dodged bullets, got hit, winged it on their own just like any of us would do faced with a crisis that had to work out. I sat in that chair facing the assassin, staying calm, hoping...It was the combination of absolutely shocking scenes, the Kremlin blown to bits erupting under Ethan Hunt's feet - I didn't expect that, the Secretary getting shot - who's left on their side now - that can't be fixed, together with ""you bet your ass captain"" Simon Pegg, not to mention the female of the team who is alluring yet as tough as her male counterparts, and the late addition analyst as the 4th member - the boy next door and full of surprises. I hear Tom Cruise is 50. That's just a number, let me tell you. I can't remember the last time I felt exhilarated after watching a film. Don't worry, I didn't go downtown and try to run down the side of a building - in the mid-west they're lower to the ground - but I knew I could if I tried.I just bought a copy.

This time Ethan Hunt has Benji (Simon Pegg) for comic relief, Paula Patton as Jane Carter for a curvaceous female co-agent, and Jeremy Brenner as the troubled agent who's hiding something until the reveal.But it's not the plot that really carries the film. It's the outstanding use of picturesque locales combined with the danger of stunts that look amazingly as though nobody could have survived the making of the film. Cruise's spiderman stunt on a high tower glass skyscraper is something to see, as are many of his ""chase and be chased"" stunts.To enjoy this sort of thing you have to ignore the credibility gaps in the story and simply dwell on the action-filled sequences, some of which look absolutely amazing. The photography is first rate, especially clever at capturing a frantic chase through a sand storm and other such perils that look like a danger to life and limb.Tom Cruise still looks fit enough to handle most of his stunts and does so with an intensity he always projected as the daring agent. All in all, the film is an example of how to put together an action film with few lulls in its long running time, and one that is sure to please the masses.One of its saving graces: no shaky camera as in the ""Bourne"" films.",4,"For action fans, impossible not to like...",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,1673,"['MISSION', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'GHOST', 'PROTOCOL', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'kind', 'do', 'entertain', 'masses', 'especially', 'action', 'fans', 'who', 'cool', 'gadgets', 'stunts', 'high', 'places', 'twists', 'plot', 'keep', 'story', 'spinning', 'new', 'outburst', 'violent', 'action.As', 'usual', 'mission', 'prevent', 'nuclear', 'device', 'destroying', 'vaporizing', 'entire', 'population', 'exotic', 'locale', 'time', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'Benji', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'comic', 'relief', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'Jane', 'Carter', 'curvaceous', 'female', 'co-agent', 'Jeremy', 'Brenner', 'troubled', 'agent', 'who', 'hiding', 'something', 'reveal.But', 'not', 'plot', 'really', 'film', 'outstanding', 'use', 'picturesque', 'locales', 'combined', 'danger', 'stunts', 'look', 'amazingly', 'nobody', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'making', 'film', 'Cruise', 'spiderman', 'stunt', 'high', 'tower', 'glass', 'skyscraper', 'something', 'see', 'are', 'many', 'chase', 'be', 'chased', 'stunts.To', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing', 'have', 'ignore', 'credibility', 'gaps', 'story', 'simply', 'dwell', 'action-filled', 'sequences', 'look', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'photography', 'first', 'rate', 'especially', 'clever', 'capturing', 'frantic', 'chase', 'sand', 'storm', 'other', 'such', 'perils', 'look', 'danger', 'life', 'limb.Tom', 'Cruise', 'still', 'fit', 'enough', 'handle', 'most', 'stunts', 'so', 'intensity', 'always', 'projected', 'daring', 'agent', 'film', 'example', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'action', 'film', 'few', 'lulls', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'sure', 'please', 'masses.One', 'saving', 'graces', 'shaky', 'camera', 'Bourne', 'films']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

This time around Ethan Hunt (Cruise), along with his team (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton) find their backs against the wall big time as IMF is disavowed by the government and a new villain (Michael Nyqvist of the overseas The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series) arises with intentions of global nuclear holocaust.

Plot lines from both movies shared some traits; i.e. the death of a key supporting figure, two sexy female action stars, and of course the standard betrayals and gadgets.

The Mission: Impossible franchise has run the gauntlet as far as successes and failures go; I thoroughly enjoy the original Mission: Impossible, I despise the sequel, and I'm relatively indifferent to the third film aside from its fantastic villain in the form of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The franchise returns to the screen five years after M:I-3 and an entire fifteen years after the original hit theaters in May of 1996.  After the somewhat disappointing box office returns for M:I-3 and the lackluster performance of Cruise's Knight and Day there was talk of Tom Cruises's days as an action star being over.  Ghost Protocol proved to be just the boost Cruise's career needed as M:I-4 went on to be the most successful film in the franchise so far.Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol isn't my favorite film of the franchise but it is certainly the best of the sequels.While Ghost Protocol is a relatively good film where it really gets to shine is on Blu-ray. It is simply put one of the best demo discs you can add to your collection as it is as close to video and audio perfection as you're about to find.  I can't find one technical flaw with picture quality.  Black levels are inky across the board, flesh tones are accurate, and I spotted no instances of edge enhancement or artifacting even during the tricky sand storm sequence which could have been a disaster.My only gripe with the video presentation of M:I-4 has nothing to do with the actual disc released, which again is fabulous, but concerns the fact that there isn't even an option to purchase a version of Ghost Protocol that includes the astonishing IMAX footage.  After the success of releasing The Dark Knight, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Tron: Legacy with their IMAX footage intact I'm dumbfounded by the studio and director Brad Bird's decision not to at least give fans a choice to purchase an IMAX version.  The advertising for the theatrical release of Ghost Protocol leaned heavily on the IMAX footage angle and received a lot of praise critically especially for the Burj Khalifa tower sequence which was edge gripping to say the least.  The lack of IMAX footage obviously didn't affect my score of Ghost Protocol but it's still disappointing that the nearly 30 minutes of IMAX footage was unceremoniously left out.Like the video transfer the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is also demo worthy.  From as soon as the Paramount mountain disappears the audio assault begins; gun shots, explosions, car crashes, and everything in between will give your surround speakers and subwoofer a real workout.  Not only does the track come alive during the many action sequences but even during the calmer moments the track is full of subtlety and precision.  The revamped theme sounds better than ever, the Dubai dust storm is an auditory tour de force, and the fight scenes pack plenty of punch no pun intended.  Even with all the action the dialogue is always crystal clear and the front sound stage is well balanced.  Ghost Protocol simply sounds amazing; even with the volume turned up high it never gets out of control and you shouldn't have to fidget with the volume level at all.The special features included on this release are a little light surprisingly with all the extras being found on the main disc with the second disc being a DVD copy of the film.  An UltraViolet Digital Copy & a normal Digital Copy are also housed on the DVD copy.  Four  HD documentaries of varying length are included; Heating Up in Dubai (17 min), Vancouver Fisticuffs (12 min), The Sandstorm (3 min), and Props (3 min).  Also included are 15 minutes of Deleted Scenes with optional commentary with Director Brad Bird also presented in HD.  Strangely there is no feature commentary with Brad Bird which seems like a glaring omission.This newest entry into the Mission: Impossible franchise is the best film of the franchise since the original but is easily the best Blu-ray of the series.  The included special features are a little light but that can be overlooked because of the amazing video and audio presentation which is flawless.  Inclusion of the IMAX footage would have been a nice bonus; I simply don't understand why it wasn't included but perhaps a future Blu-ray release will include it.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to enjoy Tom Cruise's best film in almost a decade before he ""self destructs"" again.",4,Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol Blu-ray

Curiosity did. I like that each Mission film hand selects qualifying directors to helm continuing serials in the title series. Brad Bird is a welcome addition. Previously directing animated masterpieces The Iron Giant, Ratatouille, and The Incredibles, Bird has shown an exemplary eye for dissecting authentic human character, and by doing so, creating heartfelt drama, comedy, and perhaps most importantly, heightened peril.Character's an imperative element to film yet often diagnosed as the necessary evil for establishing most action moneymakers, but Bird prevails. Mission not only parades these elements, it does so in a poetic framework that exemplifies and makes you thirst for each character on screen. What I like most about the script is its comedic elements in very strenuous situations. Tom Cruise barely hanging on for life from a Dubai skyscraper and angrily disposing of his broken glove only to find it sponged on a window several stories higher, as though taunting him, brings satisfactory relief to suicidal vertigo. Jump on couches all you want, Mr. Cruise, so long as you keep them coming.Noel J Hadley",4,Don't be scared off by the Ghost Protocol,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1271,"['What', 'initially', 'got', 'excited', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'film', 'certainly', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'Curiosity', 'did', 'like', 'Mission', 'film', 'hand', 'selects', 'qualifying', 'directors', 'helm', 'continuing', 'serials', 'title', 'series', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Previously', 'directing', 'animated', 'masterpieces', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Ratatouille', 'Incredibles', 'Bird', 'shown', 'exemplary', 'eye', 'dissecting', 'authentic', 'human', 'character', 'doing', 'so', 'creating', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'heightened', 'peril.Character', 'imperative', 'element', 'film', 'yet', 'often', 'diagnosed', 'necessary', 'evil', 'establishing', 'most', 'action', 'moneymakers', 'Bird', 'Mission', 'not', 'only', 'elements', 'so', 'poetic', 'framework', 'exemplifies', 'thirst', 'character', 'screen', 'What', 'like', 'most', 'script', 'comedic', 'elements', 'very', 'strenuous', 'situations', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'barely', 'hanging', 'life', 'Dubai', 'skyscraper', 'angrily', 'disposing', 'broken', 'glove', 'only', 'find', 'sponged', 'window', 'several', 'stories', 'higher', 'taunting', 'satisfactory', 'relief', 'suicidal', 'vertigo', 'Jump', 'couches', 'want', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'so', 'long', 'keep', 'coming.Noel', 'J', 'Hadley']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

I must say that I liked the third Mission Impossible much better. Ghost Protocol was simply an action film with some cool stunts and scenes and zero story. There was not a point in the movie which I didn't see coming around the next corner. Most of the best scenes were in the trailer and I kept waiting for a twist that never came.I did not see this movie in IMAX, although I'm sure it would have made the movie visually more entertaining, though it still would be lacking in story. It was your basic fun action flick. Tom Cruse did well as usual as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone did a great job and made the movie a lot of fun to watch. But again, story was lacking in my opinion. There was a thing with his wife, which never really materialized into a good twist or story. It was just confusing and we really didn't figure out what really happened until the very very end. Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker) did a great job as well as Paula Patton (D&eacute;j&agrave; vu) and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead). Michael Nyqvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Swedish version) was a nice surprise role, as I didn't know he was in this.I must say that the locations and scenes were well thought out and take us out of the usual locations in many movies. That was one of the most interesting aspects of the film; the locations. Another fun aspect of the film was the team's gadgets and gizmos. There are many times in the film where their gadgets don't work as well as planned and greatly add tension and a bit of thrill to the situation.Over-all it is a very good action flick with a little less of a story than one would have hoped. Yes I love action, however action mixed in with twists and character development is always more fun. In the theater there were times when everyone laughed and other times where everyone cringed as they watched Tom Cruse climb the exterior of at glass building or drive around in a sand storm. It is a fun movie and I do recommend a watch, however don't expect to be blown away by the average nearsighted story or the silly sweet ending.

1401734,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B004EPYZUS,pastapadre,"[15, 21]","Dormant since the third entry in the series arrived in 2006 - that one helmed by J.J. Abrams garnered good audience and critical response - Mission: Impossible returns and with rookie live-action director Brad Bird of Pixar fame. What materializes is arguably the best of the franchise delivering some tremendous action sequences coupled with a credible story that elevates it beyond just being a series of incredibly impressive set pieces.When IMF is framed for the bombing of the Kremlin - four agents including Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must go underground to stop a plot to beget nuclear war while also clearing their names. Hunt is joined by the returning Benji (Simon Pegg) and newcomers Jane (Paula Patton) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner).Bird shows incredible skill at framing fight scenes and providing some beautiful shots of locales. Being set in Russia, Dubai, and India allowed for plenty of opportunity to capture some great looking footage. The scenes with Hunt on the outside of the Burj Khalifa building were so anxiety-ridden that I almost got uncomfortable watching. That might be partially due to knowing that Cruise was actually hanging out there doing his own stunts and that it wasn't CGI - regardless it goes to show just how much impact the film had in delivering an intense experience through its action and sense of suspense which carried through to the other scenes as well.Ghost Protocol leans heavily on Cruise who delivers an outstanding performance - an example of his undeniably strong screen presence that shines through more here than maybe ever before. The others do well also in their roles - Patton in particular was subdued in a way that typically isn't reserved for the ""sexy"" lead female.If there is any area that falls somewhat flat it is some of the attempts at humor - which are handled in a subtle enough manner that any misses didn't hurt the film. What the lighter dialogue did do was provide some levity and a chance to breathe in what was practically non-stop adrenaline pumping action from start to finish. There is also a human touch to the story and the relationships between the characters.

It is a tight action spy film with some great sequences and awesome gadgets.  Brad Bird is the director of some truly excellent films; albeit they are animated, but great none the less.  His films like ""Ratatouille"", ""The Incredibles"" and ""The Iron Giant"" were all wonderful animated films with a lot of heart and good direction.  Bird has proven to this reviewer he has the skill for live action feature films.""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" brings us back to our hero Tom Cruise while he is locked up in a Russian prison.  Of course the inevitable happens and he is broken out of jail in a really great opening sequence.  Cruise and team assemble; their mission, prevent a nuclear launch.  Unfortunately, their plans are curbed when the team is implicated in a massive bombing.  The President decides to initiate ""Ghost Protocol"" which completely dismantles the ""IMF"" and paints Cruise and team as rogue agents.  Their new mission, clear the IMF's name and save the world.  Pretty basic stuff for a Mission Impossible movie.Pretty basic, yes, but what a ride it is.  First, I'd like to congratulate the scriptwriters on finally making a M.I. film with a tight and aggressive script.  There was hardly a dull line in the entire movie.  With the writers having primarily a television background they were able to get their points across quickly and effectively.  Second, is of course the action sequences.  Realistic, invigorating, suspenseful....just downright awesome.  It is surely a fun ride and if you have a chance to see it in IMAX you will be blown away during the Dubai sequences.  Location is another gem in this movie; Dubai, Russia, India are beautifully shot and give some very nice eye candy.  But for me, the highlight were the gadgets and spy sequences, it wouldn't be a Mission Impossible film without great gadgets right!?  Ghost Protocol doesn't disappoint.  From gloves that stick to glass, visual projections and everything in between there is some really cool stuff in this film.I can't go without commenting on Tom Cruise doing his own stunts.  Regardless of what you think of him on a personal level, one has to admit him doing his own stunts was pretty incredible.  There are some really hairy situations he gets into and I was very impressed he went the extra mile, I think it helped knowing he was actually doing the stunts while I was watching.  I would say overall the acting was good, but not overly impressive.  This isn't a drama film after all so I'm not taking any points away.  Why would you go to a Mission Impossible movie for great acting?  You go for the action, and if you keep that mindset, this film will be worth your time and money.",4,Impossible to enjoy a Mission Impossible film?

1401785,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B004EPYZUS,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol(released Dec/11)is a heart thumping adrenaline ride and I think is one of the best of the MI franchise so far.The film never stops from start to finish and the cast is simply brilliant:Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt,the IMF team's leader,Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and part of Hunt's team,Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, IMF Secretary's chief analyst and former IMF field agent,Paula Patton as Jane Carter,a member of Hunt's team,Michael Nyqvist as Kurt Hendricks,a Swedish nuclear strategist,Vladimir Mashkov as Anatoly Sidorov, a Russian intelligence operative following Hunt and his team and others.The plot finds Ethan in a Russian prison,while an IMF team outside loses some nuclear warhead codes.The film from here revolves around their recovery of those codes and the identity of the man who wants to put the world on the brink of nuclear war.The team frees Ethan and they start to work on getting the identity of the terrorist out of the Kremlin,no less.The mission goes awry and when Ethan is escaping from the Kremlin a gigantic explosion rips away a good portion of it.However during his escape he spotted the man responsible for the bombing,and who will be looking for those all important codes.The mission has gone sour and Ethan and his team are officially disavowed by their government(Ghost Protocol)and are on their own.Their trail leads them to Dubai,then on to Mumbai,on the trail of the man looking for,getting the codes and trying to reacquire them from him.The team cannot stop the inevitable nuclear warhead launch but Ethan and team do manage to stop the detonation of the warhead on San Francisco,just in the nick of time.The film ends as the team reunites in Seattle,and meets up with Luther(Ving Rhames),who is cleaning up the nuclear warhead mess from the bottom of San Fran Bay.Ghost Protocol has been lifted and the rest of his team agree to go onwards to more missions.This is truly an excellent film from start to finish.Cruise is on top of his game and his supporting cast is also.It's too bad Ving couldn't have been involved in this one,like the previous three,but the rest of the cast more than made up for his absence.Cruise's climb of the building in Dubai is heart stopping,as all he has between him and a death drop are a pair of suction gloves;one of which gives out part way up.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two deleted scenes and a look at the gadgetry of the movie and the sandstorm sequence.This is a totally cool and high speed romp through yet another MI film and one of the best so far.Cruise and company have this down to an art form now,and if they can maintain the consistent quality they have up to this point,I see and long and successful future for this series.Highly Recommended.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,A great sequel in the MI

While he is still somewhat of a superhero for this one, there is no question that it is best since 1.Released from prison by a lovely agent, Hunt is immediately entrapped in some kind of web he has to figure out.  The entire MI force is disavowed, so he has no resources but those of his immediate team, which includes a new techie, a mysterious diplomat, and the tough chick.

1401830,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B004EPYZUS,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[1, 1]","I have not been a fan of the Mission: Impossible films starring Tom Cruise, it has nothing to do with Cruise, who is a fine movie star, but that the overbaked storielines and outlandish special effects have always made them seem more mission improbable to me. However, after sitting through three uneventful films, all from first rate directors who seemed to be following studio direction rather than their own exceptional creative skills, I was seriously surprised to actually enjoy the latest installment. It is every pit as preposterous as every other entry in the franchise, but this one has a sharper wit and brighter intellectual integrity. In no way due I mean that this is a brainy film, that just wouldn't work for this sort of series, but it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence like some of the previous offenders in the ongoing movie franchise.The set up is fast and exciting, with a more authentic feel to it, the first noticeable CGI effects don't rear there facial head until thirty minutes into the story. The set up is as a thriller, the pay off is an adventure. Globe trotting from the Kremlin to Dubai to Mumbai, with an amicable cast of colorful characters played by likable actors. Cruise, as I've already stated is a great movie star, his charisma and screen presance help to make him one of the last remaining classical film stars. The supporting cast is equally strong withThe Hurt Lockerstar Jeremy Renner nearly stealing the film in a role that is said to be an enventural replacement for Cruise's Ethan Hunt. Simon Pegg is stronger in this entry than he was in the previous film, using a light comic touch, instead of his more broad approach. Sweedish actor Michael Nyquist, best known to American audiences as the original Mikael Blomkvist inDragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition, makes a good villain, looking like a cross between Mitt Romney and Robert Vaughan. Tom Wilkinson has a rather pointless guest appearance, still he's the type of solid character actor that lends class and durability to anything, and it's good to see him.Director Brad Bird, best known for his excellent work for Pixar, makes his live action directorial debut. He comes out with all the visual stops and delivers where previous directors (De Palma, Woo, Abrahms) failed in the past, stunts and action carry this picture, not computer graphics. Just look at the incredible, breathless thrills of Cruise climbing up the side of the Giorgio Armani Hotel Dubai, no stuntmen where used, no CGI cheats, that is Tom Cruise risking his life for the enjoyment of a paying audience. Electrifying editing by Paul Hirsch, who's credits includeStar Wars Trilogy (A New Hope / The Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi) (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)and nearly all of Brian De Palma's films, and exhilarating cinematography from Robert Elswit keep the pace and visuals steadfast and exuberant.I left this movie feeling joyed in the same way the best James Bond films or Indiana Jones adventures have left me feeling in the past. The only obvious fault I can find is that the plot is a tad bit overly familiar, but by being the fourth in a franchise it would seem only natural.

1401837,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B004EPYZUS,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[5, 14]","I have to wonder if there are statistics that track people getting hurt--or killed--when they try the kind of Impossible Movie Physics (IMP) that this movie lays down every 90 seconds.  Like having an explosion go off directly under you and waking up just a little groggy.  Or running along the outside of a building on a length of computer cable and then letting go to fly through a window 60 feet away and two stories below, and coming out of it just a little sore and out of breath.  Or driving a car off a cliff and surviving the 10-story impact because of the airbag.  Or jumping out of a moving car at 70mph and getting up just slightly out of breath with scuffed-up clothing.  This movie is guilty of some of the most ridiculous IMP I have ever seen, right down to the pathetically ubiquitous outrunning of bullets and explosions, and it just keeps coming, over and head-shakingly over.This film is just absolutely, perfectly and consistently ridiculous from start to finish, with eye-poppingly preposterous action and story, from the ridiculous opening to the farcical finish.  If you love mindless Hollywood action, this luxurious, globe-trotting mash of style and tech and beauty and hot hot action will just knock yer socks off.Director Brad Bird gave us a genuine masterpiece withThe Incredibles, and if you're paying attention you can see some of the touches in this film that made that one work so well, especially in the soundtrack.  But given this story, I almost feel sorry for him . . . and for the millions he and the producers (Tom Cruise, whaddaya know) made from this thing.The story is contrived to fit around action set pieces, with the IMP necessarily inconsistent from scene to scene.  Apparently there are no police or local security forces anywhere these guys go, they're just nowhere to be seen.A public figure openly expounds the need for global thermonuclear warfare for years, and clearly sets out to make it a reality, and none of the governments of the world take action?  Really?The IMF mission brief in a public payphone, right out in the open?  Really?  Little Tom Cruise, MMA n' all, takes on 40-odd cons in a Russian prison, and is just fine?  Really?  Cruise the known spy kept in just a normal Russian peneteniary, really? Our heroic team of four spy-biz pros have to go through all kinds of gyrations--with a prep time of 4  hours--to penetrate the Kremlin's most secure spaces, but the bad guy walks in out all by himself, in a smart tweed suit?  Really?  And the Kremlin blows up quite spectacularly; how many hours labor of how many people did that take to set up?  And the Russians didn't detect any of this?  Really?And now that the bad guy has nuclear launch codes for Russian missiles, the Russians don't just supersede the entire release and authentication scheme (like they--and we--have been doing routinely for more than 60 years), rendering his theft completely useless?  Really?  There's only one set of launch codes for Russia's nuclear weapons.  Really?A Russian train car packed with electronics and communications gear and weapons?  With an external digital keypad and retina scanner?  That is never discovered as it travels the railways of Russia?  Really?Penetrating a ridiculously situated server room with some kind of movie-sci-fi magnetic levitation gadget to beat the room's airplane-turbine cooling system.  Really?  Aren't these servers tended by, say, humans, who might use a door?  And using a super-powerful magnet to awesomely levitate the agent, in close proximity to the computers you're going to seize to control the satellite.  Really?  Massive magnets and computers . . . who wrote this stuff?And lots of ham-handed product placement. But high-end products, so it's okay.  I know now that the most popular vehicles in Russia, Dubai and India areBMWs.  Yeah, like IMF agents who have been disavowed by The Secretary are going to roll up to the target's home in a BMW concept car.  Subtle.In the end the only thing saving this film from a single star was the location shooting.  Going to Russia, Dubai and India is classy filmmaking.Bottom line: It all succeeds because the core audience demographic is too thick to see the massive plot holes and made-up science.

Ghost Protocol is more enjoyable and more human partly because of the comedic relief of Benji (played by Simon Pegg), the tech guy on the MI team. The previous MI movies were too serious--almost no comedic relief. MI-3 was even morbid in the hostage segment that went on too long. This film is better, and includes some great action, stunts, and photography. Especially noteworthy is Tom Cruise climbing, running & jumping around on the glass outside one of Dubai's tallest buildings.

When I first got the set, I accidentally put in the Standard Def version and watched the whole thing, all while bitching that it sounded horrible and didn't look all that great.  Not until it was over did I realize my mistake, so this review comes after a month or so of waiting to see the movie again properly this time.  Never the less, it displays how incredibly different a film can look and sound on Blu Ray as compared to Standard Def when the transfer is done correctly.The video transfer is exceptional in all areas.  The skin tones are just perfect and there is no stair-stepping, aliasing or artifacts of any kind that I could see.  No grain either producing some of the most excellent imaging you are likely to see on a Blu Ray DVD anywhere.  There is great detail in the darker scenes and shadows and a perfectly clear transfer.  The video is definitely DEMO worthy and I don't say that about too many BluRay DVDs.The Audio, a lossless Dolby HD 7.1, which I listened to on a fairly esoteric 5.1 audio system, can easily be recommended to use as a DEMO disc to show off your system.  The use of the discreet channels is marvelous with exceptional panning from the front to the rears and visa versa as well as many, many examples of discreet channel usage for both the front and rears.  If I had to nit pick, I might say that the soundtrack itself, not the Foley FX, was sometimes a touch too loud, but this was surely the producers/editors intention.  Obviously, in a movie like this, your sub LFE channel will get a workout as well.It would be hard to declare a complete winner between the audio and video as they both are the stars so let's just call it an exceptional draw.Again, a shame that I can't upgrade my standard def DVDs of Mission Impossible 2 & 3 to Blu Ray as they don't make the mark.  However, Ghost Protocol certainly does and I highly recommend it for those wanted a superb quality transfer.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol 2 Disc set on BluRay,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2555,"['reading', 'reviews', 'others', 'series', 'BluRay', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'effort', 'did', 'Ghost', 'Protocol.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'critiques', 'acting', 'plot', 'summary', 'just', 'review', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'transfer', 'When', 'first', 'got', 'set', 'accidentally', 'put', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'bitching', 'sounded', 'horrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'great', 'Not', 'was', 'did', 'realize', 'mistake', 'review', 'month', 'so', 'waiting', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'properly', 'time', 'less', 'how', 'incredibly', 'different', 'film', 'can', 'look', 'sound', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'compared', 'Standard', 'Def', 'when', 'transfer', 'done', 'correctly.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'exceptional', 'areas', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'stair-stepping', 'aliasing', 'artifacts', 'kind', 'could', 'see', 'grain', 'either', 'producing', 'most', 'excellent', 'imaging', 'are', 'likely', 'see', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'anywhere', 'great', 'detail', 'darker', 'scenes', 'shadows', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'transfer', 'video', 'definitely', 'DEMO', 'worthy', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'too', 'many', 'BluRay', 'DVDs.The', 'Audio', 'lossless', 'Dolby', 'HD', '7.1', 'listened', 'fairly', 'esoteric', '5.1', 'audio', 'system', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'recommended', 'use', 'DEMO', 'disc', 'show', 'off', 'system', 'use', 'discreet', 'channels', 'marvelous', 'exceptional', 'panning', 'front', 'rears', 'visa', 'versa', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'many', 'examples', 'discreet', 'channel', 'usage', 'front', 'rears', 'had', 'nit', 'pick', 'might', 'say', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'Foley', 'FX', 'was', 'sometimes', 'touch', 'too', 'loud', 'was', 'surely', 'producers/editors', 'intention', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'sub', 'LFE', 'channel', 'will', 'get', 'workout', 'well.It', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'declare', 'complete', 'winner', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'stars', 'let', 'just', 'call', 'exceptional', 'draw.Again', 'shame', 'ca', ""n't"", 'upgrade', 'standard', 'def', 'DVDs', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', '3', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mark', 'However', 'Ghost', 'Protocol', 'certainly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'wanted', 'superb', 'quality', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

But when someone kicks them right before they get their hands on a gun or nuclear war head deactivation device they are slowed down . . . crippled. It is contrived of course and you feel manipulated.

It becomes a mystery that plays constantly in the back of your mind during the film. Who was the man he took with him when escaped? Where is he now? It engages you and puts your mind into the proper framework. Tom Cruise is later written off along with the IMF and must operate rouge to save the US from terrorist named Hendricks who has the Russian launch codes and plans to use them against the US.

Again he plays Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent, who finds himself in big trouble (as always). Don't expect here any logic or coherence. ""MIGP' is a roller coaster ride with lots of gadgets and cars, plus occasional humors. Perhaps too many of them, I think, but still I found myself enjoying the ride.Without spoiling too much about the film, ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" follows the story of Ethan Hunt and three agents: William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, reprising his role in""M:i:III""). They have to thwart the heinous plans of one Kurt Hendricks, but this time around without any help from the IMF.After a rather shaky opening the film becomes interesting with set-pieces in Moscow and Dubai. The storyline itself is sometimes contrived, even impossible (by the standards of action movies), but director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"") is a skillful storyteller, who sometimes manages to effectively subvert our expectation when delivering the action scenes.But what is really amazing is the fact Brad Bird delivers the goods despite the deeply flawed script that often seems clich&eacute; and stale. Such ideas as the ""brilliant scientist-turned-dangerous terrorist"" (played by Michael Nyqvist, who was much better as the journalist in the original ""Millennium"" trilogy) and a deadly female assassin (beautiful but slightly wooden L&eacute;a Seydoux) would have been something unbearable in the hands of lesser talent.Yes, Brad Bird knows they are only ""Macguffin"" (or ""Rabbit's Foot"" if you like) - a plot device for a story.

The action sequences are spectacular - well, as long as you don't think about them.  An essential aspect of an action film is a believable sense of danger.  The problem with making characters impervious to injury is the sense of danger evaporates.  It doesn't matter how scary what they're doing is if you know they will just get up and walk away at the end of the scene.  The many ridiculous aspects of the film wouldn't matter if the characters were believable, but because they are not we are left with a series of fast moving puzzles - it's all about timing and positioning like those old video games where you jump from one platform to another while the clock ticks.It's not surprising that some people love this film and others do not.  MI-GP does whiz-bang action better than anything I've seen to date, and if that's enough for you then this is your film.  If, like me, you need more than that then it will disappoint.

Skin tones look quite nice as do textures. The audio is VERY active with a great losslss 7.1 mix.Be aware however that the sequences shot in IMAX format are NOT presented in the wider aspect ratio for the film (unlike, say, ""The Dark Knight""). Also this includes a code for a Ultraviolet ""copy"" which means you'll have to stream the film rather than upload it to your portable device. There's also a code for itunes as well if you go that route.The special features are good for the two disc editions but I am a bit disappointed that we don't get a feature length commentary track from Brad Bird and tom Cruise but we do get Bird's commentary for the deleted scenes and alternate opening sequence for the film. We also get featurettes on the dust storm sequence (a truly amazing sequence in a film filled with them) as well as ""Mission Accepted"" with Cruise, J.J. Abrams and director Bird on set discussing the making of the film.On the film:When Tom Cruise lost it a couple of years back it impacted my ability to enjoy the films he was in and for a long while I avoided them. Having said that, I enjoyed ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" and found it to be the most consistently entertaining of the four films produced in the ""MI"" film series. Bringing director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"", ""The Iron Giant"")best known for his CGI films made with Pixar was a wise move--Bird proved that he had the ability to make an exceptional thriller with involving characters even when they were CG and now he had the chance to prove he could do the same with live action thrillers.SPOILERS:The convoluted plot boils down to this: Ethan Hunt has been disavowed due to an operation that went awry and he's forced to work with an mysterious analyst named Brandt(Jeremey Renner ""The Hurt Locker"" and forthcoming ""Avengers""), Jane (Paula Patton ""Jumping the Broom"")and the only member of his team that he's worked with before Benji (Simon Pegg ""Paul"", ""Star Trek"") now a field operative. Hunt's team can't rely on anybody within IMF because the organization is being blamed for the destruction of a military facility in the Kremlin. Hunt discovers that Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist of the original ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"")a dangerous terrorist has active launch codes for a Russian nuclear device and plans on using it to start a nuclear war.END OF SPOILERS:A well made thriller with some truly astonishing action set pieces including a scene where Hunt must scale the tallest building in the world in Dubai, ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" truly delivers on its promise and is, quite possibly, the best of the four films that Tom Cruise as starred in and co-produced. The writing by Andr&eacute; Nemec and Josh Applebaum (both ""Alias"" alumni working with ""Alias"" creator J.J. Abrams as co-producer of the film)focuses on developing the plot not so much the characters in the film (although a cursory attempt is made with the IMF team)but then these type of films aren't about developing character as much as it is to create just enough to help the plot fly.The action is nonstop in ""M:IGP"" and fans looking for a spectaular display of explosions/action sequences won't be disappointed. The main flaw of the film is the lack of character development and the use of familiar faces (Jeremey Renner, Josh Holloway in a cameo, Tom Wilkinson)to help flesh out characters that aren't given much screen time to develop but, as I mentioned earlier, that's really not the point of ""M:IGP"".",4,"Updated for Blu-ray-Well made thriller from director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"") bodes well for his future as a director",1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,3627,"['UPDATED', 'BLU-RAY', 'couple', 'things', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', '1', 'Paramount', 'done', 'stunning', 'transfer', 'nice', 'depth', 'clarity', 'detail', 'Skin', 'tones', 'look', 'quite', 'nice', 'do', 'textures', 'audio', 'VERY', 'active', 'great', 'losslss', '7.1', 'mix.Be', 'aware', 'however', 'sequences', 'shot', 'IMAX', 'format', 'are', 'NOT', 'presented', 'wider', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'film', 'say', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Also', 'code', 'Ultraviolet', 'copy', ""'ll"", 'have', 'stream', 'film', 'rather', 'upload', 'portable', 'device', 'also', 'code', 'itunes', 'as', 'well', 'go', 'route.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'good', 'two', 'disc', 'editions', 'am', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'track', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'tom', 'Cruise', 'do', 'get', 'Bird', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'featurettes', 'dust', 'storm', 'sequence', 'truly', 'amazing', 'sequence', 'film', 'filled', 'as', 'well', 'Mission', 'Accepted', 'Cruise', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'director', 'Bird', 'set', 'discussing', 'making', 'film.On', 'film', 'When', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'lost', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'impacted', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'films', 'was', 'long', 'avoided', 'Having', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Ghost', 'Protocol', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'four', 'films', 'produced', 'MI', 'film', 'series', 'Bringing', 'director', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Incredibles', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'best', 'known', 'CGI', 'films', 'made', 'Pixar', 'was', 'wise', 'move', 'Bird', 'proved', 'had', 'ability', 'make', 'exceptional', 'thriller', 'involving', 'characters', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'CG', 'now', 'had', 'chance', 'prove', 'could', 'do', 'same', 'live', 'action', 'thrillers.SPOILERS', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'boils', 'down', 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 'been', 'disavowed', 'due', 'operation', 'went', 'awry', 'forced', 'work', 'mysterious', 'analyst', 'named', 'Brandt', 'Jeremey', 'Renner', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'forthcoming', 'Avengers', 'Jane', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'only', 'member', 'team', 'worked', 'Benji', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Paul', 'Star', 'Trek', 'now', 'field', 'operative', 'Hunt', 'team', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rely', 'anybody', 'IMF', 'organization', 'being', 'blamed', 'destruction', 'military', 'facility', 'Kremlin', 'Hunt', 'Hendricks', 'Michael', 'Nyqvist', 'original', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'dangerous', 'terrorist', 'active', 'launch', 'codes', 'Russian', 'nuclear', 'device', 'plans', 'using', 'start', 'nuclear', 'war.END', 'SPOILERS', 'well', 'made', 'thriller', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'including', 'scene', 'where', 'Hunt', 'must', 'scale', 'tallest', 'building', 'world', 'Dubai', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Ghost', 'Protocol', 'truly', 'delivers', 'promise', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'four', 'films', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'starred', 'co-produced', 'writing', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Nemec', 'Josh', 'Applebaum', 'Alias', 'alumni', 'working', 'Alias', 'creator', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'co-producer', 'film', 'developing', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'film', 'cursory', 'attempt', 'made', 'IMF', 'team', 'then', 'type', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'developing', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'create', 'just', 'enough', 'help', 'plot', 'fly.The', 'action', 'nonstop', 'M', 'IGP', 'fans', 'looking', 'spectaular', 'display', 'explosions/action', 'sequences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'main', 'flaw', 'film', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'use', 'familiar', 'Jeremey', 'Renner', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'cameo', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'develop', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'really', 'not', 'point', 'M', 'IGP']",Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol

1401907,AP3B615GM191G,B004EPYZUS,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 2]","Of the hundreds of movies I have reviewed on Amazon so far, ""Ghost Protocol"" is one of the most difficult to assign a star ranking.  Why?  At its core, MI-4 is an action movie through-and-through.  Judged solely by those characteristics, it is probably a four if not five-star effort.  The problem?  I'm not a big fan of films that feature action and little else.For a basic plot summary, ""Ghost Protocol"" sees the IMF shut down due to a failed mission and operating under ""ghost protocol"" (no government involvement whatsoever).  As such, the team of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), & William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) must go it alone in foiling a Russian nuclear plot.What this movie most certainly does right is that it captures the essence of what ""Mission Impossible"" really is...action, adventure, crazy stunts, gadgets, and intense special effects.  From its TV beginning, ""MI"" has always been strictly rooted in ""spy film"" characterization, and director Brad Bird (along with producer JJ Abrams) really nail that tone in ""Ghost Protocol"".At the same time, though, this movie has a very limited scope.  Either you like that kind of film-making...or you can only appreciate what it is trying to do (hence my three-star ranking).  I mean, in terms of plot, ""MI-4"" is about as generic a spy plot as one can concoct.  It is the type of film where the plot serves only as the vehicle for the next chase/fight/explosion/cool gadget.  Again, it comes down to personal preference.One thing that made the movie quite bearable for me, though, was the superb acting performances (especially from the auxiliary cast).  Cruise is solid, but is nearly upending in the acting department by Renner (who I wish would have been given more screen time) & Pegg (the spot-on comedic relief that a film like this so desperately needs).  Paula Patton?  She proves that she can kick a little butt as well as seduce the high-class gentlemen with the best of them (!).Overall, I appreciated what ""Ghost Protocol"" was trying to do in terms of movie-making, but because of personal preference I can't bring myself to truly enjoy it in a thorough sense of the word.  I liked the ""little stuff"" (acting, comedy, etc.), but the ""big picture"" (no plot, all action) made it nearly impossible for this one to vault to the top of any ""best of"" lists of mine.
