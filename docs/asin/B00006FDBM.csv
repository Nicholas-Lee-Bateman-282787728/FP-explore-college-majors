713203,A21LFSJSUSLKY7,B00006FDBM,"J. Botha ""claude777""","[11, 23]","Michael W. Smith the accomplished songwriter and ccm performer put out this worship video of popular worship songs.I have real mixed feelings on this one. I'm not a huge fan of Michael W. Smith for various reasons but I originally saw it on christian tv which was an edited version with not all the songs on this dvd, and really like it.  A great deal of this performance seemed rather contrived, I guess it was more of a performance than a worship service so that might account for some of it.There was too much posing going on and far too much screaming and applauding by the audience, it made it all look a bit like Michael was the one being worshipped. This is a common problem that needs to be dealt with. The entertainment cult of today (as I call it) has invaded the church to some degree. I believe in giving honour where honour is due but it get's ridiculous on here. Listen carefully to the commentaries as well, they are entertaining often for the wrong reasons.Love the versions of &quot;above all&quot;, &quot;open the eyes of my heart&quot; and &quot;draw me close to you&quot;, prefer Hillsongs dvd's or Paul Balouche's new one though, far more worship of God going on on these ones. A couple of songs like &quot;let is rain&quot; and &quot;40&quot; were rather pointless and seemed to go on for a long time. Ironic considering the lyrics of 40! I don't think anyone could cover U2 and do them justice though.Thanks for reading.",2,Some good songs but too staged,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,1443,"['Michael', 'W.', 'Smith', 'accomplished', 'songwriter', 'ccm', 'performer', 'put', 'out', 'worship', 'video', 'popular', 'worship', 'songs.I', 'have', 'real', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Michael', 'W.', 'Smith', 'various', 'reasons', 'originally', 'saw', 'christian', 'tv', 'was', 'edited', 'version', 'not', 'songs', 'dvd', 'really', 'A', 'great', 'deal', 'performance', 'seemed', 'rather', 'contrived', 'guess', 'was', 'more', 'performance', 'worship', 'service', 'so', 'might', 'account', 'it.There', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'posing', 'going', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'screaming', 'applauding', 'audience', 'made', 'look', 'bit', 'Michael', 'was', 'one', 'being', 'worshipped', 'common', 'problem', 'be', 'dealt', 'entertainment', 'cult', 'today', 'call', 'invaded', 'church', 'degree', 'believe', 'giving', 'honour', 'where', 'honour', 'due', 'get', 'ridiculous', 'here', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'commentaries', 'well', 'are', 'entertaining', 'often', 'wrong', 'reasons.Love', 'versions', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'open', 'eyes', 'heart', 'quot', 'quot', 'draw', 'close', 'quot', 'prefer', 'Hillsongs', 'dvd', 'Paul', 'Balouche', 'new', 'one', 'though', 'far', 'more', 'worship', 'God', 'going', 'ones', 'couple', 'songs', 'quot', 'rain', 'quot', 'quot', '40', 'quot', 'were', 'rather', 'pointless', 'seemed', 'go', 'long', 'time', 'Ironic', 'considering', 'lyrics', '40', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'cover', 'U2', 'do', 'justice', 'though.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

Smith brings the worship experience of his ""Worship"" and ""Worship Again"" CD's to your TV screen with the ""Worship"" DVD.  Recorded in Canada at Edmonton's Skyreach Centre, this DVD delivers a great live set which showcases some of the finest songs from the two CD's.  Some of my favorites include ""Open the Eyes of Heart,"" ""Above All,"" ""Let It Rain,"" ""Breathe,"" ""Draw Me Close,"" ""Agnus Dei,"" and the Rich Mullins classics ""Awesome God"" and ""I See You."" And Smitty's rendition of U2's ""40"" is a pleasant surprise!  Smitty's commentary track provides some interesting comments about each of the songs.  A couple of the songs have multiple camera angles.
