The way it implied infidelity--a moment done hurtfully even though it was in song--was unusual, though it had to follow with a syrupy moment that was emotionally fake, but true to the time. (It's the screenplay--well, really, just the dated idea that every musical love story has to tell us that couples always faithful and in love by the last reel.)Anyway, Doris Day is good as ever, a role model in the 1950s that still works today--feminine, poised, disciplined and sweet, but also self assured and assertive. (They imply she was controlling but that's hard to interpret given the ideas of the times and that she seemed to be the one with the sense. Also implied is that Kahn might have been physically abusive when the kids seem doubtful of his explanation for hitting mommy in the eye--then tell him that he never tells her he loves her. These, the infidelity moments, and the &#34;effects of fame&#34; added a little dramatic interest, but overall it was pretty predictable.)Thomas was surprising--decent in the acting and with a good singing voice. Best of all, of course, and the reason for watching are the songs--no big production numbers, just Doris and/or Danny singing his music as his career develops. It's easy to forget the great Gus Kahn catalogue, including the title song, &#34;It Had to Be You&#34;, &#34;Making Whoopee&#34; and &#34;Love Me or Leave Me&#34; and &#34;Dream a Little Dream of Me&#34;.

329788,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302728355,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Danny Thomas, he of the mighty beak, is known more for his television work than for his feature film career. I cut my teeth on reruns of MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY. On the silver screen Danny Thomas only ever starred in two prominent pictures, the 1952 remake ofJazz Singerand 1951's I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS, which chronicles the life of Gus Kahn.I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS falls in line with them old biopic treatments, laced with some truths but sweetened and fictionalized for public consumption. It boggles the mind just how prolific lyricist Gus Kahn was for decades. He put words to catchy tunes that became the rage of Tin Pan Alley and the flapper era, during them halcyon days of sheet music and phono records. In Chicago, Grace Le Boy (Doris Day) worked in a music store as a song demonstrator. It's at work that she first meets a persistent laborer named Gus Kahn (Thomas) who's come for her opinion regarding the raw stuff he'd penned. Grace is a bit reluctant and plenty put off by Mr. Kahn's pushy behavior. She's left lukewarm by his ambitious lyrics celebrating the Statue of Liberty and such. But she recognizes potential.I don't know how much of the above sticks to facts. It's certainly a cute meet. And once Grace takes a gander at the hasty lyrics he'd scribbled down (she'd suggested that love songs were what sells), well, she's in for the long haul.There's a bit of a jarring element in the way this movie shuffles time. We're barely alerted to when years elapse in the narrative. The plot follows a well-trodden path as we track the ups and downs of Gus's career and his sometimes rocky marriage with Grace. There are running sub-plots concerning Gus' inability to articulate his affection for his wife and also Grace's penchant for steering her husband's career, although the film is careful not to make Ms. Day seem too calculating and bossy. Both leads are fine performers and so natural in front of the camera. Doris Day's warm and sunny personality shines thru. But, at the time, it was Danny Thomas' seemingly off-the-cuff performance that was the revelation. There was nothing polished or ""rehearsed"" about him. He came off as a real guy. He and Day play off each other beautifully. Maybe they didn't happen in real life, but the heartfelt emotional beats between them cannot be devalued.A film that depicts the life of Gus Kahn can only score big with its music. Kahn's lyrics are delightful. They trigger that resonating button. There's a reason his songs are timeless stuff. Thomas is perfectly disarming as he croons ""Pretty Baby"" and ""It Had to Be You."" His playful duet with Day in ""Makin' Whoopee"" is an absolute highlight. But my favorite number is Doris Day's sparkling, wistful rendition of ""The One I Love Belongs to Somebody Else."" She hits all the emotional chords with this tune. It ain't breaking news, but Doris Day sure has got some dulcet pipes. And while meant to convey a negative reaction, a down-and-out Gus' spoofy version of his own song, ""It had to Be You"" (titled ""Seven-Foot-Two""), made me grin. I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS proved to be one of 1951's biggest box office hits, Gus Kahn's impact and relevance extending yet another decade deep. Plenty but plenty of sweethearts owe much to this man. But can Gus Kahn find the courage to say ""I love you"" to his own girl? Sometimes, it's not enough to sing a song.",4,"""Express yourself in your own way, Mr. Kahn, and if you can make others feel what you feel, that's poetry.""",1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,3362,"['Danny', 'Thomas', 'mighty', 'beak', 'known', 'more', 'television', 'work', 'feature', 'film', 'career', 'cut', 'teeth', 'reruns', 'MAKE', 'ROOM', 'FOR', 'DADDY', 'silver', 'screen', 'Danny', 'Thomas', 'only', 'ever', 'starred', 'two', 'prominent', 'pictures', '1952', 'remake', 'ofJazz', 'Singerand', '1951', ""'LL"", 'SEE', 'YOU', 'IN', 'MY', 'DREAMS', 'life', 'Gus', 'Kahn.I', 'SEE', 'YOU', 'IN', 'MY', 'DREAMS', 'line', 'old', 'biopic', 'treatments', 'laced', 'truths', 'sweetened', 'fictionalized', 'public', 'consumption', 'mind', 'just', 'how', 'prolific', 'lyricist', 'Gus', 'Kahn', 'was', 'decades', 'put', 'words', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'became', 'rage', 'Tin', 'Pan', 'Alley', 'flapper', 'era', 'halcyon', 'days', 'sheet', 'music', 'phono', 'records', 'Chicago', 'Grace', 'Le', 'Boy', 'Doris', 'Day', 'worked', 'music', 'store', 'song', 'demonstrator', 'work', 'first', 'persistent', 'laborer', 'named', 'Gus', 'Kahn', 'Thomas', 'who', 'come', 'opinion', 'regarding', 'raw', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'penned', 'Grace', 'bit', 'reluctant', 'plenty', 'put', 'off', 'Mr.', 'Kahn', 'pushy', 'behavior', 'left', 'lukewarm', 'ambitious', 'lyrics', 'celebrating', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'such', 'potential.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'above', 'sticks', 'facts', 'certainly', 'cute', 'meet', 'once', 'Grace', 'gander', 'hasty', 'lyrics', ""'d"", 'scribbled', 'down', ""'d"", 'suggested', 'love', 'songs', 'were', 'what', 'well', 'long', 'haul.There', 'bit', 'jarring', 'element', 'way', 'movie', 'time', ""'re"", 'barely', 'alerted', 'when', 'years', 'elapse', 'narrative', 'plot', 'well-trodden', 'path', 'track', 'ups', 'downs', 'Gus', 'career', 'sometimes', 'rocky', 'marriage', 'Grace', 'are', 'running', 'sub-plots', 'concerning', 'Gus', 'inability', 'articulate', 'affection', 'wife', 'also', 'Grace', 'penchant', 'steering', 'husband', 'career', 'film', 'careful', 'not', 'make', 'Ms.', 'Day', 'seem', 'too', 'calculating', 'bossy', 'leads', 'are', 'fine', 'performers', 'so', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'Doris', 'Day', 'warm', 'sunny', 'personality', 'shines', 'thru', 'time', 'was', 'Danny', 'Thomas', 'seemingly', 'off-the-cuff', 'performance', 'was', 'revelation', 'was', 'nothing', 'polished', 'rehearsed', 'came', 'off', 'real', 'guy', 'Day', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'beautifully', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'heartfelt', 'emotional', 'beats', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'devalued.A', 'film', 'life', 'Gus', 'Kahn', 'can', 'only', 'score', 'big', 'music', 'Kahn', 'lyrics', 'are', 'delightful', 'trigger', 'resonating', 'button', 'reason', 'songs', 'are', 'timeless', 'stuff', 'Thomas', 'perfectly', 'disarming', 'Pretty', 'Baby', 'Had', 'Be', 'playful', 'duet', 'Day', 'Makin', 'Whoopee', 'absolute', 'highlight', 'favorite', 'number', 'Doris', 'Day', 'sparkling', 'wistful', 'rendition', 'One', 'Love', 'Belongs', 'Somebody', 'Else', 'emotional', 'chords', 'tune', 'ai', ""n't"", 'breaking', 'news', 'Doris', 'Day', 'sure', 'got', 'dulcet', 'pipes', 'meant', 'convey', 'negative', 'reaction', 'down-and-out', 'Gus', 'spoofy', 'version', 'own', 'song', 'had', 'Be', 'titled', 'Seven-Foot-Two', 'made', 'grin', ""'LL"", 'SEE', 'YOU', 'IN', 'MY', 'DREAMS', 'proved', 'be', 'one', '1951', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'Gus', 'Kahn', 'impact', 'relevance', 'extending', 'yet', 'decade', 'deep', 'Plenty', 'plenty', 'sweethearts', 'owe', 'much', 'man', 'can', 'Gus', 'Kahn', 'find', 'courage', 'say', 'love', 'own', 'girl', 'Sometimes', 'not', 'enough', 'sing', 'song']",N/A

329794,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6302728355,MadMacs,"[1, 2]","It's difficult to review this movie as I'm a fan of both Director Michael Curtiz and the beautiful Doris Day.This is only the second Danny Thomas film I've screened - not like there was a lot in the cupboard to choose from. If my read on his IMDb Profile is correct, he only did five motion pictures in his entire career, the remainder of his thirty years in show business was on the small screen. Which explains much.This was a good story which should've been a vehicle that helped the careers of both lead actors. But, it seems to me at least, Danny Thomas isn't a film actor of note. Portraying real-life songwriter Gus Kahn, he seems too common, too average to be believable. I'm not suggesting that, say, Tyrone Power would've been a better choice. Obviously, the role called for a lead who had a homespun edge to him, a street quality that the average guy could relate to and with; an experienced actor with range, a John Garfield-type of performer. But the studio and producer went with an actor who just doesn't have ""it"" - that intangible movie leading man presence. It felt like Thomas was overwhelmed - the screen too large for what his type of personality delivers.I'm not saying he was bad in the role, but 'adequate' is hardly the hallmark of excellence, or a good movie.And what made it more unbalanced was just how good Day was in her role as Grace LeBoy. That sparkling aura, the perfect mix of tender innocence blended with just the right touch of unspoken worldliness. It made the contrast between these two quite stark and completely insurmountable; you just never believe that she would fall for such a schmuck. And that undeniable juxtaposition makes it impossible to fully enjoy the film. You can tell Doris is really trying, Danny too, but that all important on-screen chemistry just isn't there. That magic is most disappointingly noticeable in the ""Making Whoppee"" scene, that could've and should've been something so very special, but it came off as overly staged and flat. Sincerely, in my honest opinion, this was a tragic lost opportunity for movie audiences. Think of how we recall duos that are written into our culture and hearts: Maurice Chevalier and Hermione Gingold's ""I Remember It Well"" or Fred & Ginger's ""Let's Call The Whole Thing Off"" --- *that* is what we lost.There are a few good moments. When Gus is down on his luck, the Crash of '29 wiping out his earnings and nearly finding himself and his family on the streets; his pride unwilling to admit he could use a hand. The interplay between the stars seems genuine, as if we were privy to an intimate domestic scene between Gus and Grace. But those moments are sparse, too little and too infrequent to carry an entire film.Finally, a knock against direction. It's a small knock, but a very noticeable one. What bothered me was the lack of transitions between time periods. Director Curtiz did not clearly define what we were viewing in terms of the ""when"". I was stunned that at one point in the film it appears to be the late-1910's, next thing, it's suddenly The Great Depression. And the entire cast, for all intents and purposes, never age - despite the fact that this film spans nearly fifty years. Their clothes, hairstyles, speech and everything else - almost nothing evolves. It becomes even more confusing when the children are in the picture.

329796,A1Q87II9MJL7JF,6302728355,Paul Brogan,"[31, 32]","Warner Brothers released &quot;I'll See You in My Dreams&quot; during the holiday season in 1951.  It was the Christmas attraction at the famed Radio City Music Hall where it packed them in for many, many weeks. It deserved that success.The story of lyricist Gus Kahn works extremely well for a number of reasons. Unlike the Warners biopics of the 1940's including &quot;Night and Day&quot; (Cole Porter) and &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (George Gershwin), which often played loose with the facts, ditto several MGM biographies from that same period, &quot;I'll See You in My Dreams&quot; has more grit and depth on several levels.Director Michael Curtiz (&quot;Casablanca&quot;) shot his film in black and white, which was unusual in that most Doris Day musicals at Warner Brothers were given glossy, technicolor productions. The black and white works extremely well in conveying the complexities of Kahn's life. In addition, there are very real hints at extramarital relationships, drinking, and control issues involving Kahn's wife.Danny Thomas, in probably his best big screen performance, is perfect as Kahn. He's a struggling songwriter in Chicago in the early 1900's, seeking a break. He gets it the day he meets Grace, played by Doris Day. They write a song together, which becomes a major success and his career is launched. They eventually wed and the script gives very clear indications that Grace is the force that pushes Gus, who seems, at times, to lack the necessary drive and ambition to become a major success. Eventually Grace's controlling nature seems to push Gus away and in an attempt to reassert his masculinity, there are strong hints that he has an affair with a broadway performer.This well written story is decorated with dozens of popular songs by Kahn and some of the top composers of the twenties and thirties. In particular, the title tune, as well as &quot;The One I Love&quot;, given a perfect rendition by Day, the Day/Thomas duet of &quot;Whoopee&quot; and Danny's exquisite rendering of &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;.Doris Day and Danny Thomas are exceptional together. There is a real energy in their scenes together.  Thomas reported in his autobiography that working with Day was a wonderful experience for him and it's clear in their work together here.Although Thomas could easily have come off as a nebbish, he somehow manages to create an ultimately endearing character out of Kahn.Doris Day is wonderful as Grace.  Curtiz had directed her in her first two films as well as the exceptional &quot;Young Man With a Horn&quot;.  In &quot;Dreams&quot; she proves herself as far more than the &quot;girl next door&quot;, creating a characterization that is not always someone you like. Grace seems to be frustrated in her role as merely a wife and mother, seeming to want to return to songwriting or a career of some kind and therefore channeling that frustration into being, at times, more a mother to Gus than a wife. It's a memorable portrayal.  Vocally she can do not wrong.Frank Lovejoy is very good as Walter Donaldson, one of Gus's composing partners who, despite a clear affinity for drink and the track, manages to not alienate the audience. Patrice Wymore, as a Ziegfeld star does a standout version of &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; and plays her role with flair and style. She was the wife of Errol Flynn in real life but manages to stand on her own merits as an actress. James Gleason is perfect as a typical &quot;James Gleason&quot; character and Mary Wickes is a delight as a smart-mouthed, sharp-tongued housekeeper to Gus and Grace.&quot;I'll See You in My Dreams&quot; is about as good as a biographical film in the early 50's could be. You don't have to be asleep to enjoy this very pleasant dream.",5,"DAY, THOMAS AND CURTIZ BRING SWEET &quot;DREAMS&quot;",1009411200,"12 27, 2001",2001,3756,"['Warner', 'Brothers', 'released', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'See', 'My', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'holiday', 'season', '1951', 'was', 'Christmas', 'attraction', 'famed', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'where', 'packed', 'many', 'many', 'weeks', 'deserved', 'success.The', 'story', 'lyricist', 'Gus', 'Kahn', 'extremely', 'well', 'number', 'reasons', 'Warners', 'biopics', '1940', 'including', 'quot', 'Night', 'Day', 'quot', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'quot', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'quot', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'often', 'played', 'loose', 'facts', 'ditto', 'several', 'MGM', 'biographies', 'same', 'period', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'See', 'My', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'more', 'grit', 'depth', 'several', 'levels.Director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'quot', 'Casablanca', 'quot', 'shot', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'unusual', 'most', 'Doris', 'Day', 'musicals', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'were', 'given', 'glossy', 'technicolor', 'productions', 'black', 'white', 'works', 'extremely', 'well', 'conveying', 'complexities', 'Kahn', 'life', 'addition', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'hints', 'extramarital', 'relationships', 'drinking', 'control', 'issues', 'involving', 'Kahn', 'wife.Danny', 'Thomas', 'probably', 'best', 'big', 'screen', 'performance', 'perfect', 'Kahn', 'struggling', 'songwriter', 'Chicago', 'early', '1900', 'seeking', 'break', 'day', 'Grace', 'played', 'Doris', 'Day', 'write', 'song', 'together', 'major', 'success', 'career', 'launched', 'eventually', 'wed', 'script', 'very', 'clear', 'indications', 'Grace', 'force', 'Gus', 'who', 'times', 'lack', 'necessary', 'drive', 'ambition', 'become', 'major', 'success', 'Eventually', 'Grace', 'controlling', 'nature', 'push', 'Gus', 'away', 'attempt', 'reassert', 'masculinity', 'are', 'strong', 'hints', 'affair', 'broadway', 'performer.This', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'decorated', 'dozens', 'popular', 'songs', 'Kahn', 'top', 'composers', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'particular', 'title', 'tune', 'as', 'well', 'quot', 'One', 'Love', 'quot', 'given', 'perfect', 'rendition', 'Day', 'Day/Thomas', 'duet', 'quot', 'Whoopee', 'quot', 'Danny', 'exquisite', 'rendering', 'quot', 'Had', 'Be', 'quot', '.Doris', 'Day', 'Danny', 'Thomas', 'are', 'exceptional', 'together', 'real', 'energy', 'scenes', 'together', 'Thomas', 'reported', 'autobiography', 'working', 'Day', 'was', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'clear', 'work', 'together', 'here.Although', 'Thomas', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'nebbish', 'somehow', 'create', 'ultimately', 'endearing', 'character', 'Kahn.Doris', 'Day', 'wonderful', 'Grace', 'Curtiz', 'had', 'directed', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'exceptional', 'quot', 'Young', 'Man', 'Horn', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'far', 'more', 'quot', 'next', 'door', 'quot', 'creating', 'characterization', 'not', 'always', 'someone', 'Grace', 'be', 'frustrated', 'role', 'merely', 'wife', 'mother', 'seeming', 'want', 'return', 'songwriting', 'career', 'kind', 'therefore', 'channeling', 'frustration', 'being', 'times', 'more', 'mother', 'Gus', 'wife', 'memorable', 'portrayal', 'Vocally', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'wrong.Frank', 'Lovejoy', 'very', 'good', 'Walter', 'Donaldson', 'one', 'Gus', 'composing', 'partners', 'who', 'clear', 'affinity', 'drink', 'track', 'not', 'alienate', 'audience', 'Patrice', 'Wymore', 'Ziegfeld', 'star', 'standout', 'version', 'quot', 'Love', 'Me', 'Leave', 'Me', 'quot', 'role', 'flair', 'style', 'was', 'wife', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'real', 'life', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'actress', 'James', 'Gleason', 'perfect', 'typical', 'quot', 'James', 'Gleason', 'quot', 'character', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'delight', 'smart-mouthed', 'sharp-tongued', 'housekeeper', 'Gus', 'Grace.', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'See', 'My', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'as', 'good', 'biographical', 'film', 'early', '50', 'could', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'asleep', 'enjoy', 'very', 'pleasant', 'dream']",N/A
