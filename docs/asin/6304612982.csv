429608,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,6304612982,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I've seen this film a couple of times, and I've also seen ""Without Limits"" a couple of times as well.  While I'm giving this film a 4, that 4 is with some severe caveats, as that other finer film has shown how good a sport movie about running can be.  In reality, I believe that ""Prefontaine"" is really a 3.5.I hated the way that this film started as a pseudo-documentary.  I think that that was a huge tactical mistake, probably like taking the lead with four laps left in the 5000.  While I'm not much of a runner, it appears that Steve Prefonaine perhaps made this mistake himself at the 1972 Olympics, and I needed a nice little simile, so that one seemed to work.But once you sprint past the first act, the director seemed to run away from this documentary feel and I think that was a good idea.  From what I remember, ""Without Limits"" didn't concentrate as much on the tragedy of the Olympics in Germany, and that was probably a smart move as well.  While those Olympics were surely important from at least an historical perspective, I'm not exactly convinced that what happened there -- at least to the Israelis -- was as important to Mr. Prefontaine as this film seemed to portray.  But naturally, I could be wrong there; probably only his friends really know.For me, I think that the biggest difference between the two films was the head coach role.  While I've always been a fan of R. Lee Ermey -- and I thought that he did a good job here -- I just liked Donald Sutherland's portrayal better in ""Without Limits.""  Mr. Sutherland just seemed more natural, more laid back and philosophical to me, kind of like a Phil Jackson type.Still, a pretty good film, especially if you are a Prefontaine fan.  (I'm only a minor fan myself.)  My recommendation though:  watch this one first, and then catch ""Without Limits.""  That way you won't nitpick as much when watching this lesser film, and will be saving the best for the last lap.",4,Should Have been Better,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,1935,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'couple', 'times', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'Limits', 'couple', 'times', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film', '4', '4', 'severe', 'caveats', 'other', 'finer', 'film', 'shown', 'how', 'good', 'sport', 'movie', 'running', 'can', 'be', 'reality', 'believe', 'Prefontaine', 'really', '3.5.I', 'hated', 'way', 'film', 'started', 'pseudo-documentary', 'think', 'was', 'huge', 'tactical', 'mistake', 'probably', 'taking', 'lead', 'four', 'laps', 'left', '5000', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'runner', 'Steve', 'Prefonaine', 'perhaps', 'made', 'mistake', '1972', 'Olympics', 'needed', 'nice', 'little', 'simile', 'one', 'seemed', 'work.But', 'once', 'sprint', 'first', 'act', 'director', 'seemed', 'run', 'away', 'documentary', 'feel', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'remember', 'Limits', 'did', ""n't"", 'concentrate', 'as', 'much', 'tragedy', 'Olympics', 'Germany', 'was', 'probably', 'smart', 'move', 'as', 'well', 'Olympics', 'were', 'surely', 'important', 'least', 'historical', 'perspective', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'convinced', 'what', 'happened', 'least', 'Israelis', 'was', 'as', 'important', 'Mr.', 'Prefontaine', 'film', 'seemed', 'portray', 'naturally', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'there', 'probably', 'only', 'friends', 'really', 'know.For', 'think', 'biggest', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'head', 'coach', 'role', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'just', 'liked', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'portrayal', 'better', 'Limits', 'Mr.', 'Sutherland', 'just', 'seemed', 'more', 'natural', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'philosophical', 'kind', 'Phil', 'Jackson', 'type.Still', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'especially', 'are', 'Prefontaine', 'fan', ""'m"", 'only', 'minor', 'fan', 'recommendation', 'watch', 'one', 'first', 'then', 'catch', 'Limits', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'nitpick', 'as', 'much', 'when', 'watching', 'lesser', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'saving', 'best', 'last', 'lap']",Prefontaine VHS

429611,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6304612982,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This is a good film. It entertains totally. Jared Leto does a splendid job of maintaining the center of attention for almost the entire film. This is a sign of a considerable actor to hold our attention for two full hours as the figure almost always on screen.It is an inspirational film but also a cautionary one. I say this because Prefontaine's ambitions and self assurance seem adolescent at first. Like many young high school seniors, he knows everything and no one can tell him anything. He just happens to be one of the most talented and determined high school seniors in the nation. The film takes Prefontaine through a series of events that begin to teach him his personal limits, his priorities, his commitment to others, and finally that he must adjust to events larger than himself.  In a sentence, this film is about an extremely self-motivated and self-centered talented young man who becomes a better person as he adjusts to the hard knocks that come to all of us in life. The major hard knocks for Prefontaine are the terrible events in Munich and his performance which disappointed him. IN many ways this is the best part of the film for we get to see the terror of the events in Munich and we get to see Prefontaine's reactions to those events.Jared Leto goes a good job playing this young man.

This film does an admirable job of telling it.Steve Prefontaine was an amazing runner with an undeniable winning attitude.  He loved to compete and, more importantly, he loved to win.  This movie portrays that uncanny desire and his hard work ethic, right up until he was tragically taken in a car accident.Jared Leto did a phenominal job of playing Prefontaine.  He looked and played the part of a world class runner.  R. Lee Ermey complimented him nicely as his track coach, Bill Bowerman, who later founded Nike.  Ermey's timing was excellent, and his character was very well-rounded on the screen.  Craig T. Nelson also played an excellent smaller role in the film as the college recruiter.This good cast, and a very watchable screenplay made for an entertaining film.

This one has more the slant from Bill Dellinger and Bowerman is played with a harder edge by R. Lee Ermey. This is the Disney production and  mild on Pre's extracurricular activities in contrast to Limits and may be more accurate, particular in reference to the lacerated foot before the NCAA championships. Like a previous reviewer, I always heard he lacerated his foot in a swimming accident. The race scenes are quite good and the Munich scenes somewhat better than Limits with more emphasis.

The main cast, Jared Leto and R. Lee Ermey as the unforgettable Bill Bowerman, are really quite good for a film of this budget.  ""Prefontaine"" follows Pre's story more closely than ""Without Limits"" and definitely offers more for runners to sink their teeth into.Admittedly, the film's appeal is probably limited to those who are truly interested or inspired by the sport of running (or know someone who is).

Loftus,"[11, 14]","I give this movie three stars for general moviegoers, most of whom did not bother to see either this version or &quot;Without Limits&quot; the first time in theaters -- probably for reasons sufficient to them.People who  run long distance, who love Steve Prefontaine and/or what he stood for, are  throwing stars at both of these movies for those reasons, I suspect, not  for the movies as artworks. Since I  attended Prefontaine's high school a  number of years later, I met him my first week of school, I ran long  distance and even posted faster two-mile times then Pre as a freshman and  sophomore, and I was in the Marshfield stadium when his running colleagues  carried the coffin onto the field for a memorial service before the body  was taken to its final resting place south of town, I fight to retain some  objectivity myself.&quot;Prefontaine&quot; was made by the people who  made the marvelous high school basketball documentary &quot;Hoop  Dreams.&quot; It maintains a home movie/documentary style, with rough cuts,  uneven video quality, and faces talking directly to the camera (but they  are actors, not the real people from Pre's life).Leto does a magnificent  job of appearing to be Pre, among shots of the actual man racing. Not much  else is distinguished about this film, however. &quot;Without Limits&quot;  is a much slicker movie, which has its advantages, but I find it hard to  rate one over the other. They're just different ... and probably equally  wrong in many of the details. They reflect different folks' conceptions of  the man they knew: Pre's folks in &quot;Prefontaine&quot;; Bowerman, Kenny  Moore, and a particular girlfriend in &quot;Without Limits.&quot;I'm  delighted that any film got made about this man, let alone two; I'm  gratified that either movie has served to inspire younger runners; but I  think it's ridiculous to argue that one or the other &quot;really&quot;  captures the man.

But I can say that this film convinces me that A.E. Houseman's poem, ""To An Athlete Dying Young"" was written for phenomenal athletes such as Steve Prefontaine.Jared Leto gives a straightforward and sensitive performance as the daring young athlete. He seems to be in a hurry to experience all of life's processes, and at the same time, he is a very likeable and down-to-earth guy to whom everyone can relate. We come to appreciate his youthful idealism, especially in the face of tragedy at the Games in Munich, and the substantial contributions that he makes to sport.My first introduction to R. Lee Ermey was as the hilariously bombastic drill sargent on The History Channel's show, ""Mail Call"". While the accuracy of his portrayal of Coach and Nike entrepreneur, Bill Bowerman as a Redneck is questionable, I gradually came to accept him as a fine choice to play Pre's mentor. It was also nice to see Ed O'Neill in a serious role as Bill Dellinger.A viewer comes to feel how loved and supported Pre was when observing the portrayal of those closest to the ill-fated runner.Lindsay Crouse and Peter Anthony Jacobs are his generous and supportive parents, Laurel Holliman's Elaine Finley is his calm and intelligent-looking first girlfriend; The always sweetly-impish-faced Amy Locane portrays his second girlfriend, track runner Nancy Alleman.It's interesting to see them reminiscing about Pre about 20 years after the story ends. The make-up jobs that add two decades to the actors' appearances is detectable, but reasonable.Young Robert Carl Burke introduces us to Pre's athletic and determined spirit as a child, Brecken Meyer, as Pat Tyson gives a cheerful sense of camaraderie to the film as Pre's friend and fellow runner.The tragic sense of loss in Munich is profound. But the Great Athlete rallies, and works to improve the conditions of Amateur athletes as he continues to dazzle the crowds with his speed and grace on the track.His end is graphically reenacted. But we are left with a sense that maybe he did all that he was meant to do with his life, as unfair as life itself can sometimes be. Bill Dellinger feels convinced that Pre may have triumphed at the Summer Olympics at Montreal in 1976. But it doesn't seem right to speculate about such a thing. We have to feel that Somehwere, Pre is running The Perfect Race where the Gold will never again be elusive.I was too little to appreciate all this man meant to the world of sports when he was alive. But I have learned.The final tribute to Pre in the Stadium where he ran is solemn, but stirring, with fans shouting ""Go, Pre!"" just as he would have wanted.

429621,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6304612982,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","""Prefontaine"" is a 1997 film bio of long distance runner Steve Prefontaine who competed in the 1972 Munich Olympics. It stars Jared Leto with Ed O'Neill and R. Lee Ermey as his coaches and Breckin Meyer and Amy Locane as his girlfriend. Brian McGovern plays a disc throwerJared Leto (1971) is terrific. He can be arrogant and timid, exploitative and submissive, and gives a well rounded picture of who the person was. This was his first starring role.Ed O'Neill (1946) made us laugh for 11 seasons as Al Bundy on ""Married...with Children"" (1987-97), and subsequently landed another hit comedy series with ""Modern Family"" (2009-11). His film career has not done so well, although he has been busy with a film every few years. His last film was a brief appearance in one of the best martial arts films ever - ""Redbelt"" (2008) - in which he played a Hollywood producer for a Brazilian jiu Jitsu (O'Neill holds a black belt).R. Lee Ermey (1944) is everyone's favorite Marine drill instructor, a role he played in real life as well as in films (""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Boys in Company C"", ""Toy Story""). He plays Bill Bowerman, Prefontaine's coach and the man who co-founded Nike. Ermey does a nice job in toning down his bluster and presenting Bowerman as three dimensional character.Director Steve James made his mark with the Oscar nominated ""Hoop Dreams"" (1994) earning himself the shot at this film. This was his only full length feature film. He continues making documentaries, and won a DGA award for his work on ""At the Death House Door"" (2008).Bio pics about celebrities who die young (e.g., ""James Dean"", ""Man in the Moon"", ""Brian's Song"") have inherent problems - we know what's going to happen and the ending is inevitably a bummer.This film chooses to use a flashback device in which the story is told primarily from the POV of O'Neill, McGovern, Meyer, and Locane, his assistant coach, a fellow athlete (disc thrower),  and his girlfriends. It provides a complete story of Prefontaine's life, including the time before going to college, his college years, the athletic events, the Olympics, and his subsequent fight for athlete rights. It has a documentary feel, but looks enough like as film to avoid being called a documentary.I really enjoyed the music to this film, and the photography is great. Costumes help give this a 70s look. There are just enough running sequences to qualify as a sports film, but the story manages to focus on the person. It's definitely enjoyable and nice to see a film that focuses on a sport which is rarely covered., although if I had to pick my favorite ""running"" films I'd have to choose ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981) and ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" (1962) with ""Personal Best"" (1982).",3,Good bio pic about running star,1301961600,"04 5, 2011",2011,2739,"['Prefontaine', '1997', 'film', 'bio', 'long', 'distance', 'runner', 'Steve', 'Prefontaine', 'who', 'competed', '1972', 'Munich', 'Olympics', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'coaches', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'Amy', 'Locane', 'girlfriend', 'Brian', 'McGovern', 'disc', 'throwerJared', 'Leto', '1971', 'terrific', 'can', 'be', 'arrogant', 'timid', 'exploitative', 'submissive', 'well', 'rounded', 'picture', 'who', 'person', 'was', 'was', 'first', 'starring', 'role.Ed', ""O'Neill"", '1946', 'made', '11', 'seasons', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Married', 'Children', '1987-97', 'subsequently', 'landed', 'hit', 'comedy', 'series', 'Modern', 'Family', '2009-11', 'film', 'career', 'not', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'been', 'busy', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'brief', 'appearance', 'one', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'ever', 'Redbelt', '2008', 'played', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'Brazilian', 'jiu', 'Jitsu', ""O'Neill"", 'black', 'belt', '.R', 'Lee', 'Ermey', '1944', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Marine', 'drill', 'instructor', 'role', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Boys', 'Company', 'C', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Bill', 'Bowerman', 'Prefontaine', 'coach', 'man', 'who', 'co-founded', 'Nike', 'Ermey', 'nice', 'job', 'toning', 'down', 'bluster', 'presenting', 'Bowerman', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character.Director', 'Steve', 'James', 'made', 'mark', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', '1994', 'earning', 'shot', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'making', 'documentaries', 'won', 'DGA', 'award', 'work', 'Death', 'House', 'Door', '2008', '.Bio', 'pics', 'celebrities', 'who', 'die', 'young', 'e.g.', 'James', 'Dean', 'Man', 'Moon', 'Brian', 'Song', 'have', 'inherent', 'problems', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'ending', 'inevitably', 'bummer.This', 'film', 'chooses', 'use', 'flashback', 'device', 'story', 'told', 'primarily', 'POV', ""O'Neill"", 'McGovern', 'Meyer', 'Locane', 'assistant', 'coach', 'fellow', 'athlete', 'disc', 'thrower', 'girlfriends', 'complete', 'story', 'Prefontaine', 'life', 'including', 'time', 'going', 'college', 'college', 'years', 'athletic', 'events', 'Olympics', 'subsequent', 'fight', 'athlete', 'rights', 'documentary', 'feel', 'enough', 'film', 'avoid', 'being', 'called', 'documentary.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'film', 'photography', 'great', 'Costumes', 'help', 'give', '70s', 'look', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'running', 'sequences', 'qualify', 'sports', 'film', 'story', 'focus', 'person', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'sport', 'rarely', 'covered.', 'had', 'pick', 'favorite', 'running', 'films', ""'d"", 'have', 'choose', 'Chariots', 'Fire', '1981', 'Loneliness', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Runner', '1962', 'Personal', 'Best', '1982']",Prefontaine VHS

It was also good to see Frank  Shorter in the movie (another giant from that time).The actors were good and the cameos by actual characters were really good. The running was realistic and fast-paced.

429633,A2M1MNG7G40V85,6304612982,Surface to Air Missle,"[4, 18]","I recently caught this on HBO and was dissapointed by what could of been.  The story of distance runner Steve seems like it could of been interesting since a character study based on a long distance runner captures on of sports most exciting events.This movie falls into the classic problematic sport movie dichotomy...ok sport scenes and horrible everything else.  The races in Munich is the one real exciting scene in the movie.  You feel like you are there and the movie does a good job at getting into the little known strategy behind long distance running.The problem with this movie is that it fails everywhere else.  The main character is doubly flawed- the actual charater is a problem as is the actor who portrays him.  Steve Prefontaine is a self centered prick who is cold and distant.  Besides this he is also completely one dimensional and most of the dialogue is cliched and boring.  We get no insight into why he is such a great runner and all the non-sport scenes center on his shallow boring relationships or where he is going to proove himself next but nothing about what makes him tick.  I quickly grew tired of Pre's continuing attempts to further himself in the sport becuase I cared little for his personal achievements since I didn't care for him.  At the end when he turns down the big bucks for his dreams or racing the Finns we are supposed to feel empathy for him when his arch rival cancels, but by this time I was too bored to care.  If you want to watch an uniteresting diluded ass for 2 hours than this is the movie for you.The other problem dooming this movie is the poor cast.  Jared Leto is a no talent hack who has no buisness attempting a leading role of this magnitude.  Again he fails magnificently as his one tone delivery of dialogue is reminiscent of a bad high school theater production.  He was awfull in My So Called Life, he stank in Requiem For a Dream and he somehow managed to be even worse in this (although his ""performance"" in Panic Room might take the cake)  He has that ""Im not that quite there"" look in every movie and it drives me crazy.  The rest of the cast is misplaced but tries their best.  Amy Locane is underused and their relationship is so underdeveloped that it just takes up time in the movie for no purpose.  The great Ed Oneil is misused here in a cliched performance.  Lee Emery has parlayed a one role oddity of amazmement (Full Metal Jacket) into a movie career that shouldn't have been.Bottom Line:  By the end of this movie I found myself laughing at it out loud- not something you want to be doing with a serious biopic that is trying to take itself seriously.

Jared Leto is amazing as well. Based on his other works, to be honest, I didn't think he was a good choice to play Steve Prefontaine, but he really surprised me and does an Oscar worthy job with this role. Prefontaine is inspirational and a great tribute to a great man. I would defiantly suggest seeing it!",5,The Ultimate Movie Review!
