1484505,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B005LAIIA8,Amanda Pike,"[4, 7]","I think Frankenweenie is a cute film.  Sure, it has it's flaws.  I wish what happened with the science teacher was resolved and I felt bad for ""Weird girl"" because I don't think Mr. Whiskers deserved his fate. I kind of hoped Mr. Whiskers would disappear from his staking as he was a homage to Dracula, and maybe hint that he was still alive.  Ah, well.Now my biggest complain is the DVD / BluRay.  Why are there more features on the Blu Ray? I know, I know. You will tell me that there is more space on a Blu Ray disc than DVD.  And some of you might laugh and tell me to upgrade (my computer can only play DVD but I have a BluRay player attached to my TV).  I'll get comments like ""LOL. I have that same problem with my VHS tapes! Why don't they have all the bonus materiel?!""  But listen up, kiddies.  Go back in time just five years or so and you'll find that DVDs used to come with a LOT more bonus material than just one featurette while all the good stuff is on the BluRay.In fact the 2003 Nightmare before Christmas DVD has the short film of Frankenweenie, the short for Vincent, behind the scenes making of footage, deleted scenes, and commentaries, and more.  Yet today from Disney the Frankenweenie DVD only has one featurette and the short film version has to be watched on the Blu Ray.  Why!?  There's plenty of room on the DVD.  In fact that DVD has a LOT of blank space on it because of how much they left off.  It's like using an extended play DVD disc to hold a 400 MB AVI of a half hour cartoon you found on Youtube.  It doesn't make sense!  It would not have cost Disney more money to put the same features on the DVD because they wouldn't require more space than is already on those discs.  The DVD has lots of space, check for yourself.  They're like large bottles with only a few drops of water in them.  Why are they doing this?  Well, very simply, just to twist your arm into converting to Blu Ray.

1484517,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B005LAIIA8,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 2]","For the past few years, many have wondered if Tim Burton had lost his mojo. Critics and fans alike did not take warmly to his last few releases (although general audiences ate up 'Alice In Wonderland'). I am a die hard Tim Burton fan, and I agree that his recent output was just not good enough. When I first heard and then saw the trailer for 'Frankenweenie', I started to feel positive again. Could it be that Burton has found his way again? Does the movie deliver on classic Tim Burton? Read on....'Frankenweenie' follows the tale of young Victor Frankenstein. He makes homes movies, has a taste for science and, most obviously, loves his dog, Sparky. Victor is crushed when Sparky is taken from him following an accident. Thanks to science class and his teacher, Victor gets the idea on how to bring his beloved Sparky back to life. Once he succeeds, and his secret is revealed to a few fellow students, the town is overrun with horrendous versions of animals brought back to life in a monster mash showdown.Based on Burton's 1984 live action short of the same name, the movie expands on that story and creates new characters, situations, and action to reach feature film length. The result is a loving and enjoyable homage to classic monster movies, made even more complete and authentic with the film being in glorious black and white. Obviously, ""Frankenstein"" is the key influence here, but with the generic looking suburb the movie takes place in, it also feels a bit like Burton's own ""Edward Scissorhands"" (it doesn't hurt that two 'Edward' actors, Winona Ryder and Conchatta Ferrell, supply voices here). Beyond just being a monster movie, the film is about a boy and his dog and, despite the macabe subject matter, is very much a warm hearted movie. Something you don't see too much of anymore. I dare anyone not to be moved by this, or even maybe feel teary eyed at moments. I know I was!Supplying the voices here are a number of Tim Burton regulars: Martin Short (Mars Attacks!), Catherine 'O' Hara (Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas), Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands), and Martin Landau (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). Even though Christopher Lee, who has featured in numerous Burton films doesn't voice here, he does make an appearance thanks to TV footage.While ""Frankenweenie"" may not reach the incredible highs of classic Burton, It's the best offering he has given us in years. That being said, one still comes away with the feeling that he and his fellow filmmakers didn't take it as far as they very well could have. The homages to monster movies and characters (love the kid who sounds like Peter Lorre) are great, and the movie is a brilliantly done piece of work. It's soft viewing for the youngsters, and entertaining for adults and fans of Burton. It's fun, it's nostalgic, it's warm hearted. It's been a long time since Burton has delivered a film this good. It's definitely a step back on the right track for Tim Burton.",3,He's Alive!

1484521,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B005LAIIA8,Bitter Bunny,"[1, 3]","Frankenweenie is a good movie yet it pales in comparison to ParaNorman. The reason I bring this film up for contrast is because both have similar styles, produced in the same manner (stop motion photography) and even share spooky sensibilities. However, whereas ParaNorman takes chances, Frankenweenie plays it safe and stops cold in time to give everyone a flattering happy ending.Instead of learning one of the hardest lessons in life (conquering one's pain by letting go) vicariously through the eyes of Victor, the audience is lobotomized into a flattering happy ending where the main character (Victor) fails to have learned anything through the mayhem caused through bringing his beloved pet back to life. It's a missed opportunity but perhaps one the filmmakers did not care for examining.Of course, I'm coming at this from the point of view from an adult man finding it disheartening the filmmakers borrowed the theme of the Frankenstein account (a story that examines whether the soul of a man is only skin deep & whether a man, through disadvantage of the parts he is made of, is inherently evil or has the capacity for goodness) and ignored the big payoff at the end. I'm not saying ""Hey boys, get yer shotguns and go all Ole Yeller on that Frankenweenie!"" but I do happen to think kids are tougher and can handle something without dumbing it down.The animation, sets, character design were all beautiful and in keeping with Tim Burton's style. Music by Danny Elfman, Burton's long time contributor, appropriately sets the mood and does not delineate. I think the fact Elfman & Burton have been working so long together has only made them stronger yet Elfman is capable of standing alone, robust enough to score films of different genres.Bottom line: If you have kids like I do, Frankenweenie will delight and amuse, and quite frankly it's a much better option to the senseless shooting of something like Transformers or some random cartoon show. I wouldn't turn your evening into an entire after school special about life & death after watching the movie, but it could be a good opportunity to discuss these themes nonchalantly. No, this movie won't prepare your kid for Rover/Fluffy's untimely death, but we can't hold Hollywood entirely responsible for doing so. Having said that, to the filmmakers/studios, I know you're running a business but let's make our kids lions, not sheep.

The story to this movie is very good, and it is entertaining for not only kids but adults too. In my opinion this is one of Tim Burton's better recent movies.I believe Frankenweenie is a creative movie that plays off of Frankenstein with a twist for kids and adults to enjoy. The black and white stop motion was done beautifully, and this is to be expected since Tim Burton directed it. I feel that this movie really brought out the Tim Burton we all know from Nightmare Before Christmas to Big Fish.The plot is very good in the story and their is a wide variety of characters including Victor the main character and his puppy named sparky (ironically).

Some of them are hard, and some of them are easy. In the later group, without a doubt, we have Tim Burton, who has left a definitive imprint in moviemaking, with his tetric, dark, yet very stylish and entertaining vision. In 1984 Burton generated a short named ""Frankenweenie,"" which Disney didn't release because they felt it was ""too scary for young audiences."" However, it was later released in 1994 as a video. Now, almost twenty years later, Burton has released a delightful full feature film of ""Frankenweenie"" in a glorious Blu-ray format, a little gem that will surely touch your heart.Victor is the only child in the Frankenstein household, where he lives a happy life in town named New Holland. He shares his happiness with Sparky, his dog and best friend. Sadly, one day, during a baseball game, a freak accident causes Sparky's demise, which, of course, makes Victor very sad. However, during his science class at school, his teacher - a Vincent Price-looking type --, shows his students how electricity can make a dead frog's leg move. This notion gives Victor an idea. At the same time, the students are supposed to be presenting a science project, and, of course, each one wants to win the prize for the best project. Victor is not thinking about that; he just wants his dog to come back to life. Using the principle taught by his teacher, he is able to reanimate Sparky with electricity. Victor is happy again, but tells Sparky to stay in the attic, so that his parents don't see him. Unfortunately, Edgar, one of Victor classmates sees Sparky, and that is when the problems begin.""Frankenweenie"" is in black and white, just like when the classic horror films of the 30s were made, and which undoubtedly inspired and influenced Burton. And it really works, because you won't notice the difference, and the attention to detail is still fascinating. You will also see references to Godzilla, the Bride of Frankenstein, the Gremlins, Igor (Frankenstein's assistant), and others. The film's message, I suppose, is that when you do things with love, they come out better. There is also a scene in which Victor's science teacher warns him that ""your country needs more science teachers,"" and how free thinkers are attacked under the blanket of stupidity. The fantastic Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD and Digital Copy has many extras, including the original short ""Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers,"" an original Frankenweenie short, music video, making-of feature, and much more!

1484539,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIIA8,C. Sawin,"[50, 66]","""Frankenweenie"" is Tim Burton's first stop-motion animated film in seven years, his first film not to feature Johnny Depp in nearly a decade, and his first film not to feature his wife Helena Bonham Carter since ""Sleepy Hollow"" back in 1999. There also aren't any big musical numbers or songs in ""Frankenweenie,"" which seems a bit odd after watching the Tim Burton produced ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride."" It's also a massive improvement over Burton's other film released earlier this year; the remake of the TV series from 1966 ""Dark Shadows.""""ParaNorman"" seemed to beat ""Frankenweenie"" to the punch by nearly two months, but the main difference is that ""ParaNorman"" is centered around zombies where ""Frankenweenie"" is more ""Frankenstein"" influenced. There are countless horror influences in both films, but ""ParaNorman"" is a bit more adult in comparison and makes you laugh out loud more often whereas ""Frankenweenie"" mostly just makes you snicker but certainly has a lot more heart.This is the first time in a long time that Danny Elfman's score for a Tim Burton film doesn't feel overly clich&eacute; or obnoxious. Maybe it's because this is coming from a dog owner and from someone who loves dogs, but it was really easy to relate to Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) and his relationship to his dog Sparky. Tearing up is also something that doesn't happen very often, but it occurred every time Sparky was brought back to life while that somber piece of Elfman orchestration tenderly picks its moment to sucker punch you in the chest. Boys that age often look to their dogs as their best friend, but in this case Sparky is Victor's only friend and they're inseparable. Sparky's never ending energy, his ability to amuse himself, and the way he dances whenever he's happy only makes you feel for the character even more.Most of the characters in ""Frankenweenie"" have these really tiny mouths and it's kind of boring to watch them talk. Victor's next door neighbor and mayor of New Holland Mr. Burgemeister (voiced by Martin Short) has this incredibly animated mouth though. His round shape helps, but his mouth movements are so extreme and fluid. The same can be said for Victor's new science-obsessed teacher Mr. Rzykruski (voiced by Martin Landau). Similar in appearance to Vincent Price, the outstretched shape of his head along with his long and awkwardly shaped teeth have you fixated on him the entire time. His eccentric speeches about lightning and the townsfolk being too stupid to comprehend science cements the fantastic nature of Mr. Rzykruski.The classic horror movie references are all over the place; ""Pet Sematary,"" ""An American Werewolf in London,"" ""Dracula,"" and countless references to the original ""Frankenstein"" including author Mary Shelley. You also can't go wrong with a ""Gamera"" or ""Godzilla"" reference.The frustrating part of ""Frankenweenie"" is that there are many factors that feel like a safe zone for Tim Burton since he's done them so many times in the past. While the Danny Elfman score only enhances the experience, many may think otherwise since Elfman has been Burton's go to musical director for his entire career. Many of the secondary characters in the film are really familiar, as well. When you first see Mr. Burgemeister's niece Elsa Van Helsing, she looks exactly like Lydia from ""Beetlejuice"" so you automatically know it's Winona Ryder before she even speaks. The black cat that shows up at Sparky's grave looks exactly like the Keith David voiced cat from ""Coraline."" A rat is brought back to life with electricity and turns into this monster that looks nearly identical to the werewolf in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas.""There is this fantastic story about the relationship between a boy and his dog at the center of ""Frankenweenie,"" but a lot of people won't be able to look past what they see as typical ""Tim Burton fluff"" to fully enjoy it. If you enjoy it and your friends don't, just ask them, ""When was the last time Tim Burton had a cat in his movies who could foretell the future with its poo?""""Frankenweenie"" isn't as good as ""ParaNorman,"" but it's certainly more charming. Tim Burton has created an enchanting animated film that is suitable for all ages that is quite possibly his most accessible film in the last decade. Amusing from beginning to end, a heartwarming relationship at its core, and its love for classic horror worn on its sleeve, ""Frankenweenie"" is one of Tim Burton's best.",4,Horrifically delightful,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,4471,"['Frankenweenie', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'first', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'film', 'seven', 'years', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'feature', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'nearly', 'decade', 'first', 'film', 'not', 'feature', 'wife', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'back', '1999', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'musical', 'numbers', 'songs', 'Frankenweenie', 'bit', 'odd', 'watching', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'produced', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'also', 'massive', 'improvement', 'Burton', 'other', 'film', 'released', 'earlier', 'year', 'remake', 'TV', 'series', '1966', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'ParaNorman', 'seemed', 'beat', 'Frankenweenie', 'punch', 'nearly', 'two', 'months', 'main', 'difference', 'ParaNorman', 'centered', 'zombies', 'where', 'Frankenweenie', 'more', 'Frankenstein', 'influenced', 'are', 'countless', 'horror', 'influences', 'films', 'ParaNorman', 'bit', 'more', 'adult', 'comparison', 'loud', 'more', 'often', 'whereas', 'Frankenweenie', 'mostly', 'just', 'snicker', 'certainly', 'lot', 'more', 'heart.This', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'overly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'obnoxious', 'Maybe', 'coming', 'dog', 'owner', 'someone', 'who', 'dogs', 'was', 'really', 'easy', 'relate', 'Victor', 'voiced', 'Charlie', 'Tahan', 'relationship', 'dog', 'Sparky', 'Tearing', 'up', 'also', 'something', ""n't"", 'happen', 'very', 'often', 'occurred', 'time', 'Sparky', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'somber', 'piece', 'Elfman', 'orchestration', 'tenderly', 'moment', 'sucker', 'punch', 'chest', 'age', 'often', 'look', 'dogs', 'best', 'friend', 'case', 'Sparky', 'Victor', 'only', 'friend', ""'re"", 'inseparable', 'Sparky', 'never', 'ending', 'energy', 'ability', 'amuse', 'way', 'whenever', 'happy', 'only', 'feel', 'character', 'even', 'more.Most', 'characters', 'Frankenweenie', 'have', 'really', 'tiny', 'mouths', 'kind', 'boring', 'watch', 'talk', 'Victor', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'mayor', 'New', 'Holland', 'Mr.', 'Burgemeister', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Short', 'incredibly', 'animated', 'mouth', 'round', 'shape', 'mouth', 'movements', 'are', 'so', 'extreme', 'fluid', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Victor', 'new', 'science-obsessed', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Rzykruski', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Similar', 'appearance', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'outstretched', 'shape', 'head', 'long', 'awkwardly', 'shaped', 'teeth', 'have', 'fixated', 'entire', 'time', 'eccentric', 'speeches', 'lightning', 'townsfolk', 'being', 'too', 'stupid', 'comprehend', 'science', 'cements', 'fantastic', 'nature', 'Mr.', 'Rzykruski.The', 'classic', 'horror', 'movie', 'references', 'are', 'place', 'Pet', 'Sematary', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Dracula', 'countless', 'references', 'original', 'Frankenstein', 'including', 'author', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Gamera', 'Godzilla', 'reference.The', 'frustrating', 'part', 'Frankenweenie', 'are', 'many', 'factors', 'feel', 'safe', 'zone', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'only', 'experience', 'many', 'may', 'think', 'otherwise', 'Elfman', 'been', 'Burton', 'go', 'musical', 'director', 'entire', 'career', 'Many', 'secondary', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'familiar', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Burgemeister', 'niece', 'Elsa', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'exactly', 'like', 'Lydia', 'Beetlejuice', 'automatically', 'know', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'even', 'black', 'cat', 'up', 'Sparky', 'grave', 'exactly', 'Keith', 'David', 'voiced', 'cat', 'Coraline', 'rat', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'electricity', 'monster', 'nearly', 'identical', 'werewolf', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'fantastic', 'story', 'relationship', 'boy', 'dog', 'center', 'Frankenweenie', 'lot', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'look', 'what', 'see', 'typical', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'fluff', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'enjoy', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'ask', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'had', 'cat', 'movies', 'who', 'could', 'foretell', 'future', 'poo', 'Frankenweenie', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'ParaNorman', 'certainly', 'more', 'charming', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'created', 'enchanting', 'animated', 'film', 'suitable', 'ages', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'accessible', 'film', 'last', 'decade', 'Amusing', 'beginning', 'end', 'heartwarming', 'relationship', 'core', 'love', 'classic', 'horror', 'worn', 'sleeve', 'Frankenweenie', 'one', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'best']",N/A

Victor fits in quite nicely with Burton's roster of cinematic outsiders marginalized by the ignorant masses that misunderstand them. The atmospheric black and white stop-motion animation has a texture to it that almost feels tangible unlike most of the CG animated films being made today.""Original Short: Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers"" is the clever movie within a movie that Victor creates (with Sparky's help) and is included in its entirety.

Soon, the other kids at school force the boy to show them how to revive their pets for the upcoming science fair. Mayhem ensues. The craft of the stop motion figures is simply amazing and all the characters are full of life. The story, for this kind of a film, also contains meditative moments about life and death and also social commentary on the anti-science hysteria in the US.

The stop-motion-animation and the expanded story help this version to stand on its own. Mercifully, there are no songs in this movie; I am typically turned off by the musical sequences that get shoved into many of Burton's movies. They seem to slow down the pace of the picture and are typically on the annoying side. Without giving away too many plot details, young Victor Frankenstein is a very intelligent science-minded child whose best (and only) friend is his dog, Sparky. When Sparky is hit by a car, Victor uses every appliance in his mother's kitchen to bring Sparky back to life. Complications arise though as other children in his school attempt to revive their beloved (but also dead) pets. Sound creepy? Yes, but done very well.The relationship of Victor and Sparky is at the core of the movie, and with the longer running time, it is able to be fleshed out much more effectively than the short could allow. WIth the medium of stop-motion-animation, Sparky's character is also much more endearing. The short film was a dark satire, whereas this version seems to have so much more heart to it. If you are a dog lover, prepare to shed a few tears during this movie. Besides these two, my favorite character was Weird Girl, voiced by Catherine O'Hara. Get ready when she explains the dreams of her cat, Mr. Whiskers (another great character!). Only Tim Burton could think of wacky stuff like that!The picture is gorgeous; you will definitely want blu-ray to be able to see all of the details in the sets. It will blow your socks off at the amount of props (over 4,000!) that had to be created by hand for the miniature city of New Holland that Victor resides in. Sound is very dynamic, especially during the storm sequences and the climax of the film.Specs for the Blu-ray are:1080p High Definition Widescreen (1.85:1) * English 7.1 DTS-HDMA, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French 7.1 DTS-HDHR, Spanish 5.1 Dolby DigitalExtras on the Blu-ray include:* ""Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers""--an expanded version of the short that Victor creates with Sparky, which is only briefly referenced/seen in the movie.* ""Miniatures In Motion: Bringing `Frankenweenie' To Life""--Shot in London, this featurette interviews most of the creative people responsible for the art direction and creation of the sets/props for the movie.

1484556,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005LAIIA8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Back in 1984, a young Tim Burton (who would go on to direct ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Alice in  Wonderland"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Batman Returns"", ""Ed Wood"") created a short film titled ""Frankenweenie"" which paid homage to the 1931 film ""Frankenstein"".In 2005, Tim Burton would sign with Disney to remake ""Frankenweenie"" and by 2009, the screenplay for a feature film was written by John August and would reunite the crew that worked with Burton for ""Corpse Bride"".By 2010, Burton would work on one of the biggest stop-motion animation films (with a budget of $39 million) which require mechanical skeletons and feature over 200 puppets. The following year, he would reunite with musician Danny Elfman (""Batman"", ""The Simpsons"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"") who would score the film and the film would be released in theaters in September 2012.The film would receive positive reviews from film critics and would go on to earn $66 million in the box office worldwide.  And in January 2013, the film will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD.VIDEO:""Frankenweenie"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  First, let's take a look at the 3D version of the film.  This has got to be one of the best looking films from Disney or any company to be released on Blu-ray 3D so far.  It's important to note that to play this 3D, you will need a TV that is 3D enabled and comes with its own 3D glasses (or purchase them separately in pack) and also a Blu-ray player that is 3D-enabled as well.Created in stop-motion animation, presented in black and white, the film has wonderful contrast.  The 3D version of ""Frankenweenie"" shows more dedication towards depth.  So, you see more separation of the characters and objects with their surroundings.  This is not the kind of 3D that tries to reach out to you, but more of showing how characters and surround areas have depth.The picture quality looks amazing with black levels dark, grays and whites are gorgeous and edges are refined.  There is no banding, no aliasing or artifacts, this is a gorgeous film with amazing detail and stop-motion animation, whether you are watching in 3D or not.For the most part ""Frankenweenie"" is a gorgeous film on Blu-ray and its use of depth in 3D is quite impressive!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Disney doesn't disappoint at all with the lossless soundtrack for ""Frankenweenie"".  The film is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA and English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French 7.1 DTS-HDHR and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Language track.  The film is definitely immersive when it comes to the thunder and natural ambience of the film.  Especially with the dogs and cats, it's great how the film captures those sounds of creatures to the talent show at school. Dialogue is crystal clear, surround channels showcase the ambiance of the film and LFE is utilized during different parts of the film.  The 7.1 lossless soundtrack for ""Frankenweenie"" is fantastic and the music by Danny Elfman also sounds wonderful in HD!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Frankenweenie"" comes with the following special features:All New Original Short: ""Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers""--(2:25) An all-new short featuring Victor and Sparky's home movie.Miniatures In Motion: Bringing `Frankenweenie' To Life""--(23:06) Viewers get an in-depth tour of the London set that includes never-before-seen footage showcasing the hundreds of artists who worked on the film.  Interviews with producer Allison Abbate, executive producer Don Hahn and fillmmaker Tim Burton.""Frankenweenie"" Touring Exhibit--(4:37) Producer Allison Abbate and Executive Producer Don Hahn along with director Tim Burton talks about how they wanted to showcase the puppets and sculptures and what best than a ""Frankenweenie: Touring Exhibit"" and footage of the exhibit at San Diego Comic-Con 2012.""Frankenweenie"" Original Live Action Short--(30:02) Burton's original live-action black and white Disney short film created back in 1984 with talent Shelly Duvall, Daniel Stern, Barret Oliver, Paul Bartel, Sofia Coppola and Jason Hervey. (note: This is the same feature that was included with ""Nightmare Before Christmas"").Music Video -- (3:55) ""Pet Sematary"" performed by Plain White T'sEXTRAS:""Frankenweenie - 4-Disc Combo Pack"" comes with the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy of the feature film.  Also, included is an embossed slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to Tim Burton films,  you generally expect to see a dark style to the characters.From ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" to ""Corpse Bride"" and now with ""Frankenweenie"", the characters of ""Frankenweenie"" look creepy and odd.  The character of young Edgar is a hunchback with a gangly face with three teeth; Weird Girl (one of Victor's classmates who thinks she can give psychic predictions of her cat, Mr. Whiskers), has a very tall neck and round head; Nassor looks like Boris Karloff; even Sparky the dog doesn't look so cute with its scars and stitches all over its body.But that's the charm of Tim Burton animated films.  These films have their own style of animation and are unique for its own style that is never duplicated.  Imaginative, creative and entertaining!While for some people, stop-animation makes one thing of a film such as the ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", ""Frankenweenie"" is a different style of stop-animation film with gigantic monsters, wonderful models of human characters, vehicles and surroundings.  The amount of detail and the expressions that these characters have are wonderfully done and even the monsters are well-modeled.And I'm sure for Tim Burton, just seeing how his original short film came to life with ""Frankenweenie"" must have felt great. His original short film made over 28-years-ago while he was working as an animator at Disney, was considered to macabre for a remake and Disney didn't want to have anything to do with it.  Considering that Tim Burton films have been successful and for Disney, Burton gave the company its 12th highest earning film of all time, suffice to say, it's great to see that Disney gave the green light for this film to be made.  But the idea of creating stop-motion began when Burton was a child and he would create stop motion via his Super 8.While I felt the film was not too sentimental (as one usually expects from a Disney film), I try to remind myself that while its released by Disney, it's a Tim Burton film and the film does a good job at stop-motion but also creating this world of weird looking characters within the confines of a Frankenstein world.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and 3D for this Blu-ray was wonderful.  Picture quality, the film shows a lot of detail and the film is sharp and well-contrast.  The 3D is not the type that will grab after you but in terms of depth, I was impressed with the overall depth of the 3D presentation.  Lossless soundtrack is very good thanks to Disney giving audiophiles that 7.1 lossless soundtrack.  Great ambience from crowd sounds to surround ambiance sounds great coming through the surround channels and also with the amount of action featured, there is also good LFE.  But dialogue and music is crystal clear!  And also included are several special features that will keep viewers busy for awhile.And with this 4-disc combo pack, you get the film in Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and via digital copy.While I have given many positives for ""Frankenweenie"", especially when it comes to presentation and sound, if I found any problem with the film, its overall execution.  The plot is simplistic and the ending was also simplistic and quick.  I suppose that you expect to see some major climax or even a heightened tension for Tim Burton films but the way the film ended seemed a bit too quick for my taste.  But I'm sure that is subjective to the viewer.Overall, ""Frankenweenie"" is an enjoyable, imaginative and creative film from Tim Burton and crew.  As a family film, it's a safe film but younger viewers may be weirded out by the unusual look of the characters, while Burton fans will appreciate the look and creativity of this film.  Storywise, the film was good, just not great but fortunately, the Blu-ray release , its 3D and HD presentation along with its special features makes it a Blu-ray release worth owning.""Frankenweenie - 4-Disc Combo Pack"" is recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: While not the best Tim Burton animated film, it's still entertaining, dark and enjoyable.",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,8342,"['Back', '1984',

Tim Burton, 2012, 90 minutes) may be a brilliantly conceived and executed animated film, but I think the originalFrankenweenie [VHS] live-action film short was far, far superior. That live-action was Tim Burton's first live-action film, which he got to do based on the right studio heads having seen his very first film, the animated short VINCENT.Incidentally, it was the original FRANKENWEENIE that got Burton his 'big-break' job as director for Pee Wee Herman'sPee-wee's Big Adventure.In the animated FRANKENWEENIE remake, young Victor who brings back his terrier Sparky from the dead looks suspiciously like that old Vincent boy. However, with the original live-action film in my opinion a true classic, I have no idea what possessed Burton to do this. It is a bit gross and I certainly would not let young children near it.The original live-action film, however, was fit for children because it taught a lesson with beauty and humor. Here we have some competitive schoolmates of Victor's who are neither relevant nor funny at all. It is this, which could be interpreted by many people as a mockery of disabled kids, that really ruined this cartoon for me.Burton, ho-ho-ho'ing withTim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmasunder his belt and the critics howling againstTim Burton's Corpse Bride, need not have bothered with this thing at all.Even with the immortal Martin Landau as a negligible inducement (voicing a snooty Russian professor teaching at Victor's school), I still do not know how the reedy voice of Martin Short can compare with the stunning genius of the 1984 original cast, with a lovely Barret Oliver as Victor, with tour-de-force performances by Shelley Duvall and Michael Stern as his parents.But then Burton, who in my opinion is one of our greatest directors, can do what he likes.",3,"An unnecessary remake if ever there was one, or, ""When I say 'ignorant' I mean 'stupid'.""",1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,1829,"['FRANKENWEENIE', 'Dir', 'Tim', 'Burton', '2012', '90', 'minutes', 'may', 'be', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'executed', 'animated', 'film', 'think', 'originalFrankenweenie', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'live-action', 'film', 'short', 'was', 'far', 'far', 'superior', 'live-action', 'was', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'first', 'live-action', 'film', 'got', 'do', 'based', 'right', 'studio', 'heads', 'having', 'seen', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'animated', 'short', 'VINCENT.Incidentally', 'was', 'original', 'FRANKENWEENIE', 'got', 'Burton', ""'big-break"", 'job', 'director', 'Pee', 'Wee', ""Herman'sPee-wee"", 'Big', 'Adventure.In', 'animated', 'FRANKENWEENIE', 'remake', 'young', 'Victor', 'who', 'back', 'terrier', 'Sparky', 'dead', 'suspiciously', 'old', 'Vincent', 'boy', 'However', 'original', 'live-action', 'film', 'opinion', 'true', 'classic', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'possessed', 'Burton', 'do', 'bit', 'gross', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'young', 'children', 'it.The', 'original', 'live-action', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'fit', 'children', 'taught', 'lesson', 'beauty', 'humor', 'Here', 'have', 'competitive', 'schoolmates', 'Victor', 'who', 'are', 'relevant', 'funny', 'could', 'be', 'interpreted', 'many', 'people', 'mockery', 'disabled', 'kids', 'really', 'ruined', 'cartoon', 'me.Burton', ""ho-ho-ho'ing"", 'Burton', 'Nightmare', 'Christmasunder', 'belt', 'critics', 'howling', 'Burton', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'thing', 'all.Even', 'immortal', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'negligible', 'inducement', 'voicing', 'snooty', 'Russian', 'professor', 'teaching', 'Victor', 'school', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'reedy', 'voice', 'Martin', 'Short', 'can', 'compare', 'stunning', 'genius', '1984', 'original', 'cast', 'lovely', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'Victor', 'tour-de-force', 'performances', 'Shelley', 'Duvall', 'Michael', 'Stern', 'parents.But', 'then', 'Burton', 'who', 'opinion', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'can', 'do', 'what']",N/A

1484575,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B005LAIIA8,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[4, 5]","A love / hate relationship has always existed between Tim Burton and critics. Ever since ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" hit screens in 1985, the renowned director / producer / writer is constantly put under a microscope over every project he's attached to. He's been praised for triumphs like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ridiculed for heavily panned for movies such as the ""Planet of the Apes"" remake. ""Frankenweenie"" should be added to his list of successes.Vincent is a loner who loves making homemade movies with his dog and best friend Sparky. After Sparky is hit by a car and killed, the boy is distraught and lonely. Thanks to his science teacher, Vincent is shown how to re-animate dead tissue and uses it to bring Sparky back from the dead. Things get out of control when the other students in class start bringing their pets back to life with less successful results.I've always liked Burton's movies. I loved ""Dark Shadows,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" and all of the other films he's been involved with throughout his entire career. Looking through his filmography, I can't locate a single movie I hated or consider unwatchable. The man has a wonderfully dark sense of humor and a great admiration of cinema history, which he shows off through ""Frankenweenie.""""Frankenweenie"" is classic Tim Burton at his best. It has crazy characters with the looks to match. A couple of them are patterned and named after classic horror actors and characters like Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester, Igor, and others. The entire movie serves as a beautiful homage to Universal and Hammer horror. I smiled in delight when Vincent's parents are cuddled on the couch watching ""Horror of Dracula"" with Christopher Lee.My only complaint with ""Frankenweenie"" is it's too clean for what it's trying to emulate. This is even more evident when the film is seen in high-definition. A movie that celebrates the monsters of yesteryear would have been more effective if they had added some artificial film scratches and grain to give it an aged ""retro"" look.Danny Elfman's musical score for the film brilliantly blends his trademark orchestration with splashes of what you would expect to hear in movies like ""Bride of Frankenstein"" or ""Dracula.""Anyone who enjoyed ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Corpse Bride,"" ""Coraline,"" or ""James and the Giant Peach"" will embrace ""Frankenweenie."" It's an elegant tribute to the classic horror films of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s that will entertain children and their parents. It's definitely a return to form for Tim Burton.

1484586,A3RKFHBRBAG79P,B005LAIIA8,"Graham Swearingen ""Graham1138""","[5, 10]","I saw the original Frankenweenie (also by Tim Burton...yea, he remade his own movie) as a kid and liked it. It wasn't amazing and since I had already seen Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Batman also by Tim Burton, this short film didn't blow me away. I liked the star Barret Oliver (D.A.R.Y.L. and The Never Ending Story) and liked that it was filmed in black and white. Since seeing that movie, over the years Tim Burton has made countless movies with Johnny Depp and films scored by Danny Elfman that now seem to be bland reiterations of his own movies, most of which aren't original. This full length feature adaptation of his own short film, is no different. This movie, like Corpse Bride, while looking cool and well done with the signature Tim Burton character design and overall look, is flat and has no charisma. Directors seem to run out of steam and good ideas after working in the business for too long. I don't think Tim Burton has made a decent movie in about 15 years, this bland and typical Tim Burton movie is exactly what you would expect from him anymore, predictable and devoid of originality. The pacing is fine, he did a decent job of adapting his own work, but if you didn't like Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland, or Sleepy Hollow, (which I hated all of those movies) you probably won't like this movie either. Get your hands on the original short film he made in '84, don't give this guy more money to keep ruining other peoples stories and now his own work. Albeit this is just a different version of Frankenstein, and so is Edward Scissorhands. Really, even his best movies aren't original. Tim Burton really shouldn't be making any more movies. This movie will appeal to kids, and since they have to be taken to the theater to see this, it'll make millions and it really shouldn't. It's just not a very captivating or original concept and I can't sit through anymore of Tim Burtons expected art design or subpar Danny Elfman scores. Which is sad, because they both used to be so great. I think it's time to hang up the hats you guys, or maybe take a break to reflect.I think because the typical American audience has become so desensitized to human death in movies, that the death and resurrection of a dog in this movie feels more emotionally involving and heart felt. While I will agree with that sentiment, if you replace Sparky and create say a stranger for Victor to dig up and resurrect, I don't think anyone would really care. Then this movie would more closely resemble the original story of Frankenstein and resurrecting dead people and not pets. This movies sentiments seem to cloud everyone's judgment and perception. Tim Burton took other peoples stories, character and character names, and overall conception and just slapped his signature ""Tim Burton Style"" on it. If you like his remakes and adaptations of Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Planet Of The Apes, and Alice In Wonderland, then I think you will probably like this as it is apparent you like his overused style and boring story telling which leans heavily on its visual conception. Tim Burton is all style and no substance, and what little substance he has is other peoples stories. Where this movie is most successful is the animation itself which has nothing to do with Tim Burton. The team of stop motion animators are on par with Nick Parks team who worked on some of his Wallace and Gromit stop motion features which I find far more compelling and entertaining in style and substance when compared to Frankenweenie.The adapted screenplay by John August is very telling to why I feel this movie feels flat to me. He wrote Titan A.E., both Charlie's Angels movies (those are complete crap), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Corpse Bride and Dark Shadows. Clearly this guy can't write anything original and when paired up with Tim Burton, neither one can think of new stories. I still feel like the original short film Tim Burton made was superior. I think it worked better as short and live action. I can see why he went with animation, but I think he should have adapted this into live action and made it more like a B grade movie from the 1950's like he did with Ed Wood. Yet that he already did, so it would be like beating a dead horse at this point. Much like most of his movies and his style. This is being advertised as a comedy, I didn't think it was funny. None of the jokes were, and most kids probably won't get the references to older films. The movie is packed full of scientific debate and monster rampage as filler and when trying to say something about messing with the natural order, they screw it up by re-resurrecting Sparky which I thought was a huge disservice to the whole ideal of the concept that things that are dead should stay dead. Clearly they sought the happy ending for kids instead of taking the better direction and keeping the dog dead. Or re-dead. I am ok with people liking it and it is certainly better than his last few movies. But it isn't anywhere close to being as good as his best work from twenty years ago.",3,Better as a short film,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,5133,"['saw', 'original', 'Frankenweenie', 'also', 'Tim',

1484589,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B005LAIIA8,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[0, 0]","There's a tendency to see Blu-ray as a boon to color films and it is. Babes in Toyland, as reported earlier, is true eye candy. However, when it comes to black-and-white film, Blu-ray accentuates the details and makes the clarity sharp as can be.Such is the case with the Blu-ray of Frankenweenie. As with so many Tim Burton movies, there are those who just can't get into his very specific vision and those who can't get enough of it. If the latter is you, Frankenweenie is, to quote Fawlty Towers, a ""televisual feast.""My kids enjoyed it, particularly my son, but the family agreed that it was very intense viewing for young children. Please don't just plop this into the player and let the kids loose on it if they're very young and impressionable -- but you're the best judge of where your kids are in relation to movies and TV (we waited a loooong time before we showed Bambi to my son).Frankenweenie, in Burton style, is grotesque yet touching, strange yet perceptive. If you haven't seen the 1984 live action short that inspired it (included on the Blu-ray but not the DVD), it's the Burton world of a misfit in a suburban environment of eccentrics that screams ""Who's the real crazy one?"" This motif is especially strong in Frankenweenie, in which the neighborhood kids are much weirder than the odd central character.Things get pretty monstrous in the final climax, much like a vintage sci-fi matinee (only done with a great deal more time and budget). The animation is as amazing as ever. There is just nothing like stop-motion and its kinetic excitement. The massive work behind this kind of art is nicely shown in another Blu-ray only feature, ""Miniatures in Motion.""DVD only viewers will also get a look at the traveling Frankenweenie exhibit that spent some time at Disney California Adventure Park.

I own the VHS of the original short film, as it had never been formatted to DVD, and I'll always keep the VHS if nothing more than just nostalgia.  It is unclear to me if the DVD/Blu-Ray release will contain the original short film, but I am hoping that it will so that I can watch it again.When I first heard that Tim Burton was going to do an animated reimagining of Frankenweenie, I was excited...I have been a long time Tim Burton fan and was very intrigued to see his reimagining of his original film. Sometimes other people will venture to try and remake classics, and a lot of times they'll wind up being mediocre or not even all that good, with some exceptions of course.  However, knowing that Tim Burton would be remaking it, it'd be good.The movie follows the same concept...a boy who loves his dog and loses him figures out how to bring him back and does so.  However, in this extended remake, other kids catch onto this and decide to try and bring back their own pets and things go horribly wrong.  I am not going to say anything further about it for anyone who has not seen it, but things get a bit out of control in the end to say the least.Much as the original Frankenweenie was a great homage to Frankenstein, this reimagining is a great homage to monster movies in general.  I'd say there are parts in this that maybe might be a tad scary for kids under 5 perhaps, but that's up to the discerning parent to decide.  Beyond that though, I'd say this movie would be enjoyable to pretty much anyone, especially to anyone who enjoys monster movies, especially the classics.

This tale of a boy genius who is inspired by his science teacher and his own intelligence to revive his beloved dog is made endearing because of the many touching moments between he and his dog, Sparky.  He does this out of love without worrying about the possible consequences.  The consequences take the form of the jealousy that exists among his classmates, the closed mind attitude of some adults, scientific experimentation, and ultimately a lack of compassion.

The Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite, artwork wise, of Burton's.  This movie was the first in forever that felt close to that, with the dark humor and step-by-step shots, which makes it so time consuming but do worth it in the end. I also saw an ode to Beetlejuice with the rat coming alive,I loved it!The Pet Cemetery itself also seemed like a nice nod to Mr.King, master of horror, and there were many other nods of inspirations throughout that I loved. Frankenstein's Bride, for example, when the poodle took a shock from Sparky and her hair shot up and changed to that perfect color! What a tribute! There were many more, but I digress!I loved Mr.Whiskers and his poop omens, how sick and strange and perfect for this weird little world! And Creepy Eyed Girl! Too Much! What I really loved Were the extras showing the classroom and all the characters and little pieces, I just wanted to reach out and play with them, very cool!The video by The Plain White Tees was a really good song as well. I hadn't heard anything from them since ""Delilah"", a song I love, but thought surely they were a one hit wonder. The song they did for the DVD was pretty good though and maybe they'll make a comeback!I also liked getting the digital download because my six year old loves this movie as much as I do so it's nice we can take it with us on the road now for her.Was also happy to notice Ms. Ryder's voice right away, and enjoyed get character as well. I really loved the storyline though, as I love my dogs like my kids, and they are just as loyal and dear as little Sparky, who reminded me of my doxie throughout with his antics. Even my bf, who never cries, cried when Sparky got hit by that car, never mind we both knew the premise of the movie was him coming back to life, but it really was heartbreaking.Such a good film, instant classic, must see.

""Working with Tim and his amazing mind was an incredibly fun and fulfilling experience,"" explains Allison who now has worked with Burton three times, ""He has an amazing mind and vision that made this project very, very personal to him.""Disney's release of ""Frankenweenie"" is a stop-motion animation film that takes an original short film that Burton did almost 30 years ago called ""Vincent"" (which launched his live-action career) and expands it into a real full feature-length adventure that is not only heartfelt but pays homage to all the old Sci-Fi and Monster horror films of the 30's, 40's and 50's. The characters are nods to every creepy, archetypical and funny monster-type you can think of and all done in black & white with amazing special effects all in a very inviting3D film.The story is about a boy named Vincent (voiced by Charlie Tahan of Charlie St. Cloud and I Am Legend) and his dog Sparky. It is a really true relationship that eventually runs into a serious accident that requires the dog Sparky to come back to life. Without his parents knowing, he brings Sparky back to life in a very unique way! Did I mention his parents are Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein? They are passionately and cleverly voiced by Martin Short (Mars Attack, Father of the Bride) and Cathrine O'Hara (Beetlejuice, Home Alone) who both do two other clever voices each and you'll never guess which ones until the credits!Vincent is inspired by an eccentric old teacher who is masterfully voiced by the voice artistry of Academy Award Winning Martin Landau (Space:1999, Ed Wood). ""It was an amazing script. Something I believed in and just a joy to do the film,"" explains Martin, ""Tim is amazing and his characters are full of depth and imagination. This film actually `invites' you into the picture because of this style of 3D they used. I've never seen that before.""""Every frame in this movie is Tim Burton. There isn't a detail that he didn't oversee, ""explains Producer Allison Abbate, ""That is probably why the team took over two years to make this final product and did it with all their heart and passion!""The true heart of the story is what not only Vincent learns about science and its importance in the world, but the fact that the town learns the true meaning of acceptance, in believing in yourself and the true bonding of a boy (or girl) and his pet. Also, Danny Elfman's (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman) score only enhances the thrills and chills and deep-felt heart of the entire project through each stop-motion frame.The town is sprinkled with the most fun and creepy cast of neighborhood kids and townspeople that make this an adventure and a visual fun classic. ""It has an amazing truth to it and it was a very personal project for Tim Burton,"" explains Producer Don Hahn, ""He and the team labored over the details of each maquette and their moves.""Of course the true test of any film is given by the reaction to an audience and this one made our audience and I'm sure will certainly make you laugh, panic, anticipate, be surprised and create tension and eventually will pull at your heart-strings more than once. It is great fun for the whole family and sure to be another new Halloween classic to enjoy year after year!",5,"Burton Makes Frankenweenie Fun, Emotional & A Real Halloween Experience!",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,3588,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '54', 'FrankenweenieGetting', 'chance', 'see', 'screening', 'film', 'listening', 'Executive', 'Producers', 'Allison', 'Abbate', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Don', 'Hahn', 'Lion', 'King', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'talk', 'working', 'Writer', 'Producer', 'Director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'was', 'truly', 'fantastical', 'experience', 'Working', 'Tim', 'amazing', 'mind', 'was', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'fulfilling', 'experience', 'Allison', 'who', 'now', 'worked', 'Burton', 'three', 'times', 'amazing', 'mind', 'vision', 'made', 'project', 'very', 'very', 'personal', 'Disney', 'release', 'Frankenweenie', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'film', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'Burton', 'did', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'called', 'Vincent', 'launched', 'live-action', 'career', 'real', 'full', 'feature-length', 'adventure', 'not', 'only', 'heartfelt', 'homage', 'old', 'Sci-Fi', 'Monster', 'horror', 'films', '30', '40', '50', 'characters', 'are', 'nods', 'creepy', 'archetypical', 'funny', 'monster-type', 'can', 'think', 'done', 'black', 'white', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'very', 'inviting3D', 'film.The', 'story', 'boy', 'named', 'Vincent', 'voiced', 'Charlie', 'Tahan', 'Charlie', 'St', 'Cloud', 'Am', 'Legend', 'dog', 'Sparky', 'really', 'true', 'relationship', 'eventually', 'serious', 'accident', 'dog', 'Sparky', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'parents', 'knowing', 'Sparky', 'back', 'life', 'very', 'unique', 'way', 'Did', 'mention', 'parents', 'are', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Frankenstein', 'are', 'passionately', 'cleverly', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Mars', 'Attack', 'Father', 'Bride', 'Cathrine', ""O'Hara"", 'Beetlejuice', 'Home', 'Alone', 'who', 'do', 'two', 'other', 'clever', 'voices', ""'ll"", 'never', 'guess', 'ones', 'credits', 'Vincent', 'inspired', 'eccentric', 'old', 'teacher', 'who', 'masterfully', 'voiced', 'voice', 'artistry', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winning', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Space:1999', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'was', 'amazing', 'script', 'Something', 'believed', 'just', 'joy', 'do', 'film', 'Martin', 'Tim', 'amazing', 'characters', 'are', 'full', 'depth', 'imagination', 'film', 'actually', 'invites', 'picture', 'style', '3D', 'used', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'frame', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Burton', ""n't"", 'detail', 'did', ""n't"", 'oversee', 'Producer', 'Allison', 'Abbate', 'probably', 'why', 'team', 'took', 'over', 'two', 'years', 'make', 'final', 'product', 'did', 'heart', 'passion', 'true', 'heart', 'story', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'Vincent', 'science', 'importance', 'world', 'fact', 'town', 'true', 'meaning', 'acceptance', 'believing', 'true', 'bonding', 'boy', 'girl', 'pet', 'Also', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Batman', 'score', 'only', 'thrills', 'chills', 'deep-felt', 'heart', 'entire', 'project', 'stop-motion', 'frame.The', 'town', 'sprinkled', 'most', 'fun', 'creepy', 'cast', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'townspeople', 'make', 'adventure', 'visual', 'fun', 'classic', 'amazing', 'truth', 'was', 'very', 'personal', 'project', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Producer', 'Don', 'Hahn', 'team', 'labored', 'details', 'maquette', 'moves', 'course', 'true', 'test', 'film', 'given', 'reaction', 'audience', 'one', 'made', 'audience', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'laugh', 'panic', 'anticipate', 'be', 'surprised', 'create', 'tension', 'eventually', 'will', 'pull', 'heart-strings', 'more', 'once', 'great', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'sure', 'be', 'new', 'Halloween', 'classic', 'enjoy', 'year', 'year']",N/A

There may be surprise twist endings or some characters may not make it to the end of the film alive.

True, it is not in color, as we usually like to see in movies, so I would have found more charm in it had it been in color.

But, other than Sweeney Todd, his later work has been leaving me kind of cold. I love monster movies, and I caught every reference in this film, and I wanted to like it. I really did want to. I just didn't. It was kind of boring.I had the same problem with this that I had with Corpse Bride, which is that his characters are designed so that they never really look all that interested in what's going on around them. They don't seem affected, which makes it hard for me to care about what's going on either. I get that this isn't using real actors, but this isn't something that affected Nightmare Before Christmas, where the characters showed actual emotion. But here it seems like we get a couple tears pooling and that's it. The rest of it is strangely monotone.Also, the monsters in the second half were kind of scary for a kid's movie. Assuming this was a kid's movie. It was marketed that way, and it isn't terribly complex, which makes me think it can't possibly be for adults. But it's seems too scary for kids under seven or eight. I think the cat metamorphosing into a half-bat winged creature with claws that then scuttled around the room lightening fast only to try to attack people is a little much for kids under that age. And it's going to be too slow for most kids over eleven or twelve. If it is meant for kids, that leaves Burton a very narrow audience. If he meant to aim for adults, well, he underestimated his viewers' level of sophistication.The movie simply seemed bland, even curiously boring. Burton probably got a lot of people through the door based on the trailer, which was far more interesting than the actual movie, but the audience likely to really enjoy this movie seems small.

Oleson,"[0, 1]","Director Tim Burton takes his live 30 minute film from 1984 and expands it to 87 minutes using his wonderful stop-motion figures similar to those of ""Nightmare Before Christmas.""  Borrowing heavily from the original 1931 ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) in terms of character names and physical appearance, Burton produces a film that kids and their parents can all enjoy.Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) is a middle school kid who stays within himself but has a thirst for science.  His faithful companion is a dog (bull terrier?) named Sparky.  They are always together except when Victor is at school.  Unfortunately Sparky being a dog, likes to chase balls.  One such chase leads him into the street and in front of a car.  Victor is disconsolate as you might expect.In science class, Victor's science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (an homage to Vincent Price voiced by Martin Landau), animates a dead frog using electricity.  This gives Victor the idea of doing the same with Sparky.  Working alone in the attic of the house he shares with his parents (Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short), Victor's experiment works.  As Victor's wannabe friend Edgar `E' Gore (Atticus Shaffer) says ""your dog is alive!""In one cute scene, Sparky nuzzles up to the lady poodle that lives next door.  The poodle that has a mountain of hair trimmed into a cone.  After a nose touch, the lady poodle has those white lightning bolt streaks that appear on Elsa Lanchester's ""Bride"" of years ago.  Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) is the name of the little girl that owns the poodle.  When further experiments on various dead creatures owned by Victor's classmates goes horribly wrong, the fun begins.Burton and his screenwriter, John August keep the gruesomeness at a PG level and introduce enough moral-of-the-story awareness to keep the film wholesome enough for most family members.  I loved the wit and the pastiche to the stories of Mary Shelley.  Not to mention the beautiful black and white picture supplied on the Blu ray.With a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the movie looks spectacular.  Contrast and fine detail prevails throughout the film.  This is as good as it gets, as is the terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack.  Good use of the LFE channel is deep when it needs to be and silent when it doesn't.  Dialog is well placed and always centered properly.  Extras include a documentary called ""Miniatures in Motion"" and a 5 minute piece displaying the excellent art work of the film.

However, havoc is unleashed when Victor's classmates decide to imitate his experiment for their own science project entries, with disastrous results! In the end, will the people of New Holland come to accept Victor's abilities and the monster-pup he has created?2012 was pretty much the year for creepy-themed animated features. We got two stop-motion films, ParaNorman and Frankenweenie, and we also got the computer-animated ""Hotel Transylvania"". I wouldn't be surprised if I was forgetting something, too, but let's compare these for a moment. Hotel Transylvania is basically an animated Adam Sandler film, but even as someone who found Sandler's earlier films funny,  I gotta say, I don't think his humor translates as well to animation as HE thinks it does. That leaves the two stop-motion films, and it IS always nice to see anything that isn't computer generated in the animation genre these days. Though, I still wish we'd see more hand-drawn work again. ParaNorman came out a little bit earlier, and I'll be honest, even though I'm a Disney fanatic, I like it better than Frankenweenie in a lot of ways, though Frankenweenie had some really great qualities. Both are visually impressive and nicely stylistic, Frankenweenie with its black and white, Burton designs, and ParaNorman with a look all its own. Both have their humorous side, and both, I would say, have the problem that their adult characters aren't always as good as the kid characters. I particularly disliked the adults in ParaNorman, but I liked the kids better than the Frankenweenie kids. Overall though, the main thing was just that Frankenweenie had me feeling kinda ""meh"" the whole time, while I was a bit more enthralled with ParaNorman. This could be because Frankenweenie was a story I already knew from the short, live-action film that was Tim Burton's first live-action work, and which got a lot of airplay on the Disney Channel back in the day. Honestly, the new animated feature, to me, didn't really seem to top the original short. I think that was a big problem I had with it. A lot was added, but it didn't add much to the story itself, in my opinion, which is really just taking a story about a boy's love for his dog and turning it into a Frankenstein parody. On the other hand, ParaNorman was a bit more original, and that counts for a lot, and I found the characters, the kids at least, much easier to like, which is also a big thing. Incidentally, the whole thing with the mayor and his niece in Frakenweenie, that didn't do a thing for me. That seemed totally pointlessly unpleasant. But, don't get me wrong, while I preferred ParaNorman (and that's not to say it was a masterpiece), I still felt Frankenweenie was an enjoyable and visually beautiful film. I just didn't take away anything from the story that I didn't get in a shorter runtime from the original short film, which happily is included on this blu-ray release.As I mentioned, Frankenweenie is visually amazing. The voice acting and animation are excellent. I find it odd that the original parents of Victor weren't brought in to reprise their roles, but then, it's just nice to see (or hear) Martin Short in a movie again. The music and everything else in Frankenweenie were great, but as I said, I felt I had gotten all I needed from the simple story through the short film, and yes, the added stuff was just that, filler, albeit entertaining filler. At times, it was very entertaining filler. Still, I found the characters mostly rather dull(when they weren't just being funny) in Frankenweenie. This doesn't necessarily make the movie drag, but it could have been a lot more fun, even though it had its moments for sure. Now, to compare this to still other creepy-themed animated features of recent years, I honestly haven't gotten to see Corpse Bride yet, though I want to. And, though I recently purchased it, it's been quite a while since I've seen Coraline, so I can't say I remember it well enough. However, one I do remember well (and only recently acquired) is Monster House, which I have to say I really prefer to either of these films! As I said, it's nice to see something other than CGI, but Monster House just had better writing and better characters (though maybe the climax of ParaNorman was better). It's really the movie I'd recommend if someone wanted to see something animated fairly recently that was creepy in tone. Be sure to check it out, but all these films are well worth at least one viewing. In fact, I find them all totally worthy of adding to my collection, though I still need to get a copy of ParaNorman.As for the Blu-ray itself, of course it looks and sound perfect, and this one also has some nice bonuses, though I'm still totally puzzled as to why animated films so rarely get director commentaries. The highlight here, of course, is the original short film. Watch it and imagine having seen it BEFORE the full-length version. It hardly seems a remake was worthwhile. It was good enough a a short. Anyway, besides that, there's a great making of documentary, as well as a music video and a look at the touring exhibit of models used during the film. Oh, and did I mention the all new Frankenweenie short? It was cute, anyway, and basically it's an alternate opening. ""Frankenweenie"" is definitely not the best animated feature of the year, but it was enjoyable, and I don't think a major Burton fan or animation nut would want to miss it.",4,Frankenweenie: A pretty

They do everything together --- from science projects to making homemade horror movies--- they are the very best of friends. But one tragic day, all that will change. After Sparky's untimely death, Victor immerses himself in his schoolwork, taking a particular fascination in the sciences. Inspired by one of his eccentric teacher's electric lessons, Victor decides to test his theories the only way he knows how--- by trial and error with gruesome experimentation. And what do you know? It actually works! He's alive! He's really alive! There's just one problem now that Sparky's back... how do you make people accept what they don't understand? Victor and Sparky are challenged to prove that despite his terrifying looks, Sparky is still the loyal pal he's always been. And behind-the-scenes, unbeknownst to them both, there are more sinister forces that want to wreak monstrous havoc to the town. Can Victor and his undead friend stay in tact long enough to save the day?I am an unabashed fan of Tim Burton's movies. Big Fish, The Corpse Bride, Edward Scissorhands, The Nighmare Before Christmas --- all works of cinematic art. I'm here to tell you that Frankenweenie is no exception. Pretty much, the man is a genius, especially when it comes to animation. For all the limitations that animated movies have to offer, Burton excels at creating an essence of creepy originality and gothic creativity. You'll find that Frankenweenie is much inspired by some of the more classic horror films, only its told in a more kid-friendly manner. That's not to say that the movie is completely age-appropriate (it does delve into death, afterall), but Burton does a decent job of dealing with the more serious issues in a darkly humourous way.What I really love is that Burton wasn't afraid to examine his debut short and re-imagine it into this grandiose and ultimately captivating film. I will admit, at times there are those familiar echoes, script-wise, but it's touched by Burton's unusual eccentricity which keeps it from feeling too monotonous. In it you'll find the usual cast of characters, of course---the social misfit with a good heart, the quietly weird girl, the eccentric sidekick and the dastardly villain--- but what makes the film so unique is the addition of Victor's loveable, yet horrifying dog. Seriously, the reanimated Sparky will steal your heart with his adorable mannerisms and gruesome quirks. There were two key moments where I had tears in my eyes. I guess if I had one big criticism of the film, it's that there wasn't enough characterization into Victor. Frankenweenie barely scratches the surface on questioning his actions which renders the plot as somewhat hollow.The voicework was outstanding, featuring the return of several Burton alums and the music is eerie perfection. I loved the dark atmosphere of the stop-motion which adds layers to the story's creepiness. And perhaps even more remarkable is subtle homage to films of horror movie's past. If you look closely enough, you'll also find some clever referencers to Burton's other cinematic achievements. Though I wouldn't say Frankenweenie was my favourite Burton film, I found the ending be a bit too empty, it still found a place in my heart with it's quirky charm and extraordinary vision. At best, I felt some of the feels and was very happy for my own fuzzy canine friend!Food for Thought: Frankenweenie is basically, you know, Frankenstein but for kids (sorta). The story might be just as ugly as the original, but its definitely not lacking in heart .Featuring some stellar voice talents, remarkable animation and one very cute puppy, this film is a winner for families and those that share a mutual appreciation for classic horror.

1484688,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,B005LAIIA8,octobercountry,"[12, 17]","This certainly has been the year for supernaturally-themed animated features. First we had ""Paranorman,"" which I enjoyed very much. Then came ""Hotel Transylvania,"" which has been doing HUGE box-office (but which I never got around to seeing yet, due in part to the fact that I heartily dislike some of the key vocal performers). And now there is ""Frankenweenie,"" which I saw today.I should state at the outset that I absolutely LOVED the 30-minute black-and-white short ""Frankenweenie,"" which was made nearly thirty years ago. It's just about perfect, and if you haven't seen it yet----by all means check it out at once!So,I was curious as to how this longer version would compare. I did enjoy it very much, but wasn't quite as thrilled with it as I had hoped to be. In the end, I think that the short version really is the superior film. I think the problem with the remake is that it doesn't really provide any additional character development or depth to the story; the extended length seems mostly to be filler for me. The only sequences added to the new version that I thought added substantially to the story at all, were the scenes with Victor's science teacher. (Though make no mistake, those scenes are marvelous---visually the teacher is a caricature of Vincent Price, and he is voiced by Martin Landau---who of course played Bela Lugosi in Burton's fantastic film ""Ed Wood."")This film really is like old home week as far as the vocal casting is concerned; just about everyone in it has had something to do with previous Burton efforts. The voices are perfect, and the animation very nicely done with a retro look that is perfectly appropriate to the source material. (It doesn't really compare to the fantastic ""Paranorman,"" but then it isn't supposed to.)So, despite some reservations, I do recommend this as a great way to introduce kids to classic cinema monster mythology. It is PERFECT viewing for the month of October, with Halloween just around the corner. I'm sorry to say that the box office returns have been modest (to put it politely); like ""Paranorman,"" I think this is a film that is likely to appeal to a specialised and limited audience. Though---as this is a black-and-white film that is a homage to the old 1930's Universal horror pictures, it's no surprise that the audience is even more limited than was that of ""Paranorman""'s.(I'll add that I got a kick out of the fact that the character design of the dog is based on the lead in another old animated short, ""The Family Dog,"" which was shown on the series ""Amazing Stories"" back in the eighties.)",4,"Not as good as the original, but not bad",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,2579,"['certainly', 'been', 'year', 'supernaturally-themed', 'animated', 'features', 'First', 'had', 'Paranorman', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'Then', 'came', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'been', 'doing', 'HUGE', 'box-office', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'yet', 'due', 'part', 'fact', 'heartily', 'dislike', 'key', 'vocal', 'performers', 'now', 'Frankenweenie', 'saw', 'today.I', 'should', 'state', 'outset', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', '30-minute', 'black-and-white', 'short', 'Frankenweenie', 'was', 'made', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'perfect', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'once', 'So', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'longer', 'version', 'would', 'compare', 'did', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'thrilled', 'had', 'hoped', 'be', 'end', 'think', 'short', 'version', 'really', 'superior', 'film', 'think', 'problem', 'remake', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'additional', 'character', 'development', 'depth', 'story', 'extended', 'length', 'mostly', 'be', 'filler', 'only', 'added', 'new', 'version', 'thought', 'added', 'substantially', 'story', 'were', 'scenes', 'Victor', 'science', 'teacher', 'make', 'mistake', 'scenes', 'are', 'marvelous', '-visually', 'teacher', 'caricature', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Landau', '-who', 'course', 'played', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Burton', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'film', 'really', 'old', 'home', 'week', 'as', 'far', 'vocal', 'casting', 'concerned', 'just', 'everyone', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'previous', 'Burton', 'efforts', 'voices', 'are', 'perfect', 'animation', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'retro', 'look', 'perfectly', 'appropriate', 'source', 'material', ""n't"", 'really', 'compare', 'fantastic', 'Paranorman', 'then', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'So', 'reservations', 'do', 'recommend', 'great', 'way', 'introduce', 'kids', 'classic', 'cinema', 'monster', 'mythology', 'PERFECT', 'viewing', 'month', 'October', 'Halloween', 'just', 'corner', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'have', 'been', 'modest', 'put', 'politely', 'Paranorman', 'think', 'film', 'likely', 'appeal', 'specialised', 'limited', 'audience', 'Though', '-as', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'homage', 'old', '1930', 'Universal', 'horror', 'pictures', 'surprise', 'audience', 'even', 'more', 'limited', 'was', 'Paranorman', ""'ll"", 'add', 'got', 'kick', 'fact', 'character', 'design', 'dog', 'based', 'lead', 'old', 'animated', 'short', 'Family', 'Dog', 'was', 'shown', 'series', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'back', 'eighties']",N/A

The Blu-ray case is a standard size case, which is odd because Disney usually gives us a wider case with flip sleeves to hold all the discs. There are no sleeves and there are simply 2 sides to hold discs, and there are 2 discs STACKED on each side. I am not a fan of stacked discs of any kind, however as Blu-ray is a stronger disc than DVD, I don't see having an issue with scratches.If you're a Tim Burton fan you will greatly enjoy this movie and for anyone who has children, they will love it too!

1484703,A11QEQWKLDM8U,B005LAIIA8,Reviewer,"[84, 103]","Our children, ages 6 (daughter) and 9 (son), are typically scared or upset fairly easily.  My son generally shields himself from upsetting or frightening things by covering his eyes and ears or walking out of the room.  Our daughter usually tries to be brave, but regrets it and has nightmares.  For example, the Disney version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is way too much for them to endure.  However, even certain ""tense"" portions of otherwise harmless fare such as the Tinkerbell films can cause them concern.  (Not sure why... they are just really sensitive that way.)At any rate, we thought for sure that this film would be a ""no go"" for our kids because of the themes surrounding the death of the young boys dog, as well as the ""monster-like"" animals brought back to life and the overall creepy vibe of the film.  However, while at a recent trip to Disneyland, we took them into a special Tim Burton/Frankenweenie exhibit which gave an overview of the film and showed some of the sets used in the actual picture.  To our surprise, our kids expressed interest in seeing the movie.  Because our son especially loves stop-motion films and even makes his own, we thought we may try to go ahead and take the kids.Anyway, to skip to the punch line... OUR KIDS ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  In fact, it's all they talked about for the next week.  They were not frightened or upset by it at all.  It is not overly creepy or macabre, neither is it a horror film on any level.  Still, I was unprepared for how much of a liking our children took to it.  Maybe seeing the sets in person, and being aware of some of the behind the scenes stories helped.  However, I can say that this movie has TONS of heart.  And, it is absolutely a modern day classic.  My wife and I enjoyed the film as much (or more) than the kids because of how well it is made along with the fun references to other classic films.  (How many can you pick out?)  :-)Seriously, this is one of the best films we have seen in a long time.  It's a shame it didn't do as well as it should have at the box office.  However, we're certain that it will find a following on video.  It is an absolutely charming film, impeccably crafted, and infused with tons of heart and soul.

Dalton ""Bob Dalton""","[0, 1]","When Tim Burton does something original, and not just a re-make of someone else's idea, it can make for a truly great and original film as is the case with Frankenweenie.This wonderful film is a homage to the low budget horror and science fiction ""B Films"" of the 1950 and 1960s such as Dracula, Wolfman, the Mummy and Godzilla.For those who have never seen the original versions of those films some of the inside jokes, and there are a number of them in this film, might be lost on you. Those inside jokes had me constantly giggling and laughing while my wife, who had not seen any of those films before, didn't understand why I was giggling and laughing at times.Tim often displays a macabre sense of humor and that can be seen here in this film as it was in Corpse Bride. If you love Corpse Bride, as I do, you will love this film for the same reasons. The characters here are engaging and the storyline for the most part is very well done, although there are a few missed opportunities for character development and interaction such as with Victor and the neighbor girl.From a graphic and technical perspective this film will also not disappoint. The graphics are extremely clear and crisp in blue ray, even though they are in black and white or shade of grey, which is very appropriate to the feeling and atmosphere of this film.

Creative and original, Frankeweenie illustrates its writer's original roots.The concept is fascinating. Most of the characters are based on iconic horror movie characters, like Frankenstein and Van Helsing. In addition, the movie is set in black and white, trying to capture the old look of horror movies. And yes, I don't think this film is suitable for children, more like teenagers and adults, containing some scenes that may disturb children.It's the story of Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan), who, after losing his beloved dog Sparky, tries to revive him using lightning. The experiment is a success, but no one should know about what happened. Things start to get messed up when Edgar (voiced by Atticus Shaffer) discovers Sparky.The animation is great. Tim Burton brings us a stop-motion masterpiece, paying attention to every detail from the movie's beginning to its end. The decent overall voice performance does the job just fine, giving us spooky character, Atticus Shaffer's voice gave me the chills. Tim Burton's fine job and the voice actors' performance give us the horror atmosphere necessary for the movie.Burton is always highly imaginative and creative, but he's somehow missing something.

The answer is ""A lot"", so muchin fact that I felt kind of disoriented with the story, comparedto what I remember of the original.It wasn't until the movie was over and I had some time to thinkabout it, that I began appreciate all this. I've seen a lot ofTim Burton films, and I think he has a keen eye for what it meansto be human.With Frankenweenie, Tim has a lot to say, and he says it. The thingis, he's communicating about things which other directors generallydon't. That means it takes some time and thought to pick up on whathe's saying. There's no cliches to get a handle on. Its kind of likewatching two movies at once, one is the apparent content, the otheris the meaning behind it.One of the best examples is the disjunction between the world ofkids, and the world of adults. In other movies this is basicallya social commentary, but in Frankenweenie the disjunction is muchmore in the basic fabric of each world. When Tim first shows the""shining faces"" of the kids in Victor's science class, he shows themas Victor sees them, not as Victor's parents would. Its a shock.When Victor's father explains the art of his job, its a differentkind of shock, something we recognize as adults.Another example is what Tim is saying about the world as Sparkysees it. This is where the movie really shines. Tim can add moredepth here in the remake, because Sparky is animated. Yet true tothe original, Tim allows Sparky to remain entirely a dog, and nota human. The result is that Sparky is a very life-like dog character,created with Tim's empathy and insights into Sparky and his world.Some of the commentary here is profound. If you ever saw Family Dog,you may see connections here.Going back to the added material, Tim decided that if he was goingto have a feature-length movie about a boy and his dog, he wouldinclude a girl and her cat. Naturally these characters are, for themost part, opposites of Victor and Sparky. Yet the cat is often likea real cat, and the girl does have a human connection with her cat.The characters are not caricatures, they're just, well, very different.And in the end, sad.When Tim gets into the social relationships between the kids, he raisesdifferent themes, makes broader comments about the world we live in.I don't want to give it away, but he gets in deep on the topics ofbeing an individual, competing in a group, and the unforeseen consequencesthat can arise from both. There is a lot of cause-and-effect going onin this movie.In fact, there is a whole lot going on in this movie, period :-)",5,"A Different Kind of Window, A Different World, Or Both?",1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,2631,"['Going', 'short', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'main', 'questionwalking', 'was', 'What', 'did', 'Tim', 'add', 'answer', 'lot', 'so', 'muchin', 'fact', 'felt', 'kind', 'disoriented', 'story', 'comparedto', 'what', 'remember', 'original.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'time', 'thinkabout', 'began', 'appreciate', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'Burton', 'films', 'think', 'keen', 'eye', 'what', 'meansto', 'be', 'human.With', 'Frankenweenie', 'Tim', 'lot', 'say', 'thingis', 'communicating', 'things', 'other', 'directors', 'generallydo', ""n't"", 'time', 'thought', 'pick', 'up', 'whathe', 'saying', 'cliches', 'get', 'handle', 'kind', 'likewatching', 'two', 'movies', 'once', 'one', 'apparent', 'content', 'otheris', 'meaning', 'it.One', 'best', 'examples', 'disjunction', 'world', 'ofkids', 'world', 'adults', 'other', 'movies', 'basicallya', 'social', 'commentary', 'Frankenweenie', 'disjunction', 'muchmore', 'basic', 'fabric', 'world', 'When', 'Tim', 'first', 'shining', 'kids', 'Victor', 'science', 'class', 'themas', 'Victor', 'not', 'Victor', 'parents', 'would', 'shock.When', 'Victor', 'father', 'art', 'job', 'differentkind', 'shock', 'something', 'recognize', 'adults.Another', 'example', 'what', 'Tim', 'saying', 'world', 'Sparkysees', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'shines', 'Tim', 'can', 'add', 'moredepth', 'here', 'remake', 'Sparky', 'animated', 'true', 'tothe', 'original', 'Tim', 'Sparky', 'remain', 'entirely', 'dog', 'nota', 'human', 'result', 'Sparky', 'very', 'life-like', 'dog', 'character', 'created', 'Tim', 'empathy', 'insights', 'Sparky', 'world.Some', 'commentary', 'here', 'profound', 'ever', 'saw', 'Family', 'Dog', 'may', 'see', 'connections', 'here.Going', 'back', 'added', 'material', 'Tim', 'decided', 'was', 'goingto', 'have', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'boy', 'dog', 'wouldinclude', 'girl', 'cat', 'Naturally', 'characters', 'are', 'themost', 'part', 'Victor', 'Sparky', 'cat', 'often', 'likea', 'real', 'cat', 'girl', 'have', 'human', 'connection', 'cat.The', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'caricatures', ""'re"", 'just', 'well', 'very', 'different.And', 'end', 'sad.When', 'Tim', 'social', 'relationships', 'kids', 'raisesdifferent', 'themes', 'broader', 'comments', 'world', 'live', 'in.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'deep', 'topics', 'ofbeing', 'individual', 'competing', 'group', 'unforeseen', 'consequencesthat', 'can', 'arise', 'lot', 'cause-and-effect', 'going', 'onin', 'movie.In', 'fact', 'whole', 'lot', 'going', 'movie', 'period']",N/A

1484720,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B005LAIIA8,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[27, 32]","There are already nearly 30 reviews of the film here on Amazon but this will be the FIRST one for the DVD and BD version. A few folks asked about whether the original 30-minute ""live action"" film version will be on the DVD.  Let me state up front that YES it is on both the 2-Disc Blu-ray combo pack and the 4-Disc Combo pack (which is exactly the same as the 2--Disc one except it adds a 3D BD - you need a 3D TV and player to use this - an a digital copy)! This is a wonderful bonus because it's never been on DVD format before (and for some - like me - it was something completely new.)Before I provide some more details, I'll state that I've not seen very many Tim Burton films so I came at this one different than those already big Burton fans. I did enjoy it a lot and I'm not a fan of horror films (I love Mel Brooks but ""Young Frankenstein"" is one of the few Brooks films I don't care for.) Now on to the info you can use.....At times this film looks like it is CGI animated but it is actually a stop-motion film done with puppets. While the first 20 minutes - maybe even 40 - are ""cute"" and might appeal to all ages - the original death of Sparky - no spoilers here, you know he is going to die so he can be brought back to life - is even done ""off screen"". But then things get , well, I'll say, creepy. And very young children might get scared. Let's just say that if they are old enough to be able to watch the original ""Frankenstein"" they'll be fine with this.  But I'm not a parent, so I'm only giving guidance here.The score by Danny Elfman - who does nearly all of Burton's films - provides most of the soundtrack. There are quite a few scenes with no dialogue; the animals (dogs and cats) don't talk like they do in Disney films. The film is in ""black and white"" but I'd define it better as ""grayscale"" and the images on my MUCH older TV were crisp and sharp on the BD.Now to the bonuses - of which there are five:First comes an ""original short"" ( 2  minutes) titled ""Captain Spraky vs the Flying Saucers"".  Cute but virtually a throwawayNext is ""Miniatures in Motion"" - a really interesting ""making of"" featurette that runs 23 minutes.Next comes a 4  minute featurette on the touring exhibit of Art from Tim Burton films. Okay but more of a promoThe other great bonus comes next. The aforementioned original FILM version of ""Frankenweenie"" directed by Burton and starring Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern. It runs 30 minutes and is great to see after the stop-motion 80 minute film.Last comes the ""music video"" of the song ""Pet Sematary"" by the band Plain White T's.

If you have already seen this film or don't care about spoilers, then sit back and enjoy the ride.Like ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" before, this is a beautifully animated stop-motion film with a twist of horror. Yet, it has that charming innocence and heart that only a genius like Tim Burton can pull off. Accompanied by stellar voice actors and soul-pleasing soundtrack by Danny Elfman. I also liked how it was black and white, a callback to the original 1984 short.I just have one real gripe with the film, and that is the fact some of the characters just disappear. Tim Burton had quite a cast of amazing characters that seem to vanish before the credits roll. They seemed only there to cause trouble, and yet they added a subplot or two that wasn't explored enough. More could have been done with them; the screen time they were given just didn't give enough closure for me.Regardless, this is well worth the watch, especially if you love the works of Tim Burton like ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Nightmare Before Christmas"".

1484730,A30X9M0J5WOVAS,B005LAIIA8,The IEMommy,"[0, 0]","I was so curious to watch this movie with the combined powerful names of Disney and Tim Burton behind it!  I could not imagine the two put together and what they would come up with.  After watching, I'm actually a little surprised to see Disney's name on it.  It almost seems a hundred percent Tim Burton.  Disney is known for it's family oriented movies and the name conjurs images of happiness, whimsical music and bright cartoon characters.  Frankenweenie is anything but any of these things.Frankenweenie was reminiscent of The Nightmare Before Christmas that came out when I was in high school (yes I'm dating myself).  That is the only other Tim Burton film I've seen but his style is so unique that I would have known it was his in an instant. It was dark and creepy with music to match.  Black and white by Disney was also a huge surprise to me but not with relation to Tim Burton.My kids are 3 and 4 and my son Reed is a little bit scared of things that are dark and in this case, rightfully so.  Scary creatures running around in graveyards, rising from the dead, screaming and just in general all around scary.  I actually enjoyed the film.  It was so unique and masterfully made that it was fascinating to watch.  My children, however, needed to hold onto me tight and look away during the scary parts.  They didn't want to turn it off even when they were scared so it definitely still had it's Disney draw. If you have a child that's easily scared, I would say skip this movie for them and that it's probably more appropriate for older children.My kids did enjoy the overall plot and my animal lover Paige was very emotional about Sparky and his battle with life and death. Even though creepy and other worldly, the Victor and Sparky characters are just as love-able as any of Disney's other characters. There usually is a bad guy in Disney films but I think the Tim Burton factor added a new level of scary for young ones.This Blu-Ray is in 3D but unfortunately I don't have the capability to watch in 3D yet.

For a long time it was easy to dismiss these naysayers as nostalgia worshipers, people who hold their childhood experiences so close to their own hearts that nothing can compare to the movies they loved at age thirteen.  On the one hand, this chorus of doubters conveniently ignores the fact that during Burton&#8217;s supposed period of decline he somehow managed to direct Big Fish and Sweeny Todd, two of his absolute best films that pull Burton&#8217;s bag of tricks into new territories.  But after the dual duds of Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows it has become increasingly difficult to ignore these doubters.  Where Dark Shadows was inoffensively mediocre, Alice in Wonderland stands as perhaps Burton&#8217;s worse film and yet simultaneously his most successful at the box office (Adam Smith you have failed us).Frankenweenie, which is based on a live action short film Burton directed while working for Disney, could have gone one of two ways: it could have drawn an unflattering comparison between the Burton of old and the Burton of the new millennium, or it could have showcased a talented director going back to the well and delivering up some of his old magic.  I&#8217;m happy to say that Frankenweenie is much more the latter than the former.  Unlike Planet of the Apes or Alice in Wonderland, which felt like a Burtonesque paint job was hastily plastered onto someone else&#8217;s movie, Frankenweenie is a wonderful encapsulation of Tim Burton&#8217;s obsessions with surprisingly little regard to audience reception.  Like the best family films, Frankenweenie brazenly straddles the line between heartwarming and offensive.At its core Frankenweenie is a basic retelling of Mary Shelley&#8217;s classic monster tale with the mad scientist of Switzerland switched out for a bunch of suburban kids.  The main character is even named Victor Frankenstein in one of several subtle and not so subtle allusions to classic monster movies.  But Burton is far less interested in gothic literature of the 19th century than he is in b-movies of the mid-20th century.  In typical Burton fashion, Victor is an awkward outcast who has a love of science but no real friends except for his dog, Sparky.  When Sparky one day gets loose from his leash and gets hit by a car, Victor is naturally despondent.  But after a lesson by his equally strange science teacher, Mr. Rzykruski, on the affects of electricity on dead animals, Victor decides to resurrect his beloved dog.Much of Frankenweenie plays out like Tim Burton&#8217;s love letter to Tim Burton.  It feels almost as if he too is performing a type of conjuring act, resurrecting his old self for one more film.  The movie is a loving assemblage of b-movie tropes and allusions, from analog mad scientists to Japanese kaiju.  A good number of the references will likely go over the heads of the younger set.  And the dark humor Burton and his team find in the concept of a walking, rotting corpse often comes across as a lighter version of Cronenberg&#8217;s body horror.  But these choices are refreshing because they show us that Burton is making this film largely for an audience of one: himself.  Perhaps the most audacious creative choice was the fact that the movie is filmed in black and white.  It&#8217;s difficult enough to release a film for adults in black and white anymore, much less one that&#8217;s ostensibly a family film.But of all the movie&#8217;s characters, the one that interested me the most was Mr. Rzykruski, voiced by Martin Landau who previously turned in one of the best performances of his career in another Tim Burton joint, Ed Wood.  I often have a problem with Hollywood&#8217;s depiction of teachers in films.  Too often they come across as self-help gurus (see Dead Poets Society) or they are tasked with saving inner city youth (see Dangerous Minds).  Rarely are films interested in teachers who, you know, actually teach their subject.  We only see Mr. Rzykruski a few times, but judging by his classroom demeanor, he is interested in little more than showing his class how the world works.  There are no gimmicks.  For him, science should be interesting enough.  Later in the film, the parents come together in a meeting to denounce what he is teaching in their school and demand that he resign.  Rzykruski takes this opportunity not to defend himself, but to in insult the parents and condemn them for being so ignorant.This scene is in-keeping with Burton&#8217;s distrust of the public.  Think of the moment in Edward Scissorhands when the community starts turning on Edward or how easily the Penguin manipulates the people of Gotham in Batman Returns.  In Burton&#8217;s world, the public is always one little push away from becoming an ignorant mob.  This depiction of a teacher who stands up to the parents of his pupils is also refreshing in a culture that has decided to lay all of society&#8217;s problems at the feet of public school teachers (see Won&#8217;t Back Down).  If only teachers would listen to politicians and meet the demands of largely arbitrary testing criteria, then all of our economic and social ills would be solved.  But here Frankenweenie clearly tells the parents to get out of the way of teachers and let them actually teach.For anyone who has pined for the Tim Burton of old, then Frankenweenie should be refreshing.  Most children&#8217;s movies provide rather routine pabulum as life lessons.  Similar to The Nightmare before Christmas, a film that was about failing at your life goals, Frankenweenie doesn&#8217;t trade in easy lessons.  Perhaps the movie&#8217;s message could be best summed up by Victor&#8217;s father who tells his son, &#8220;Sometimes adults don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;  I think we can all agree that this is both an unconventional message in a children&#8217;s movie and that as a statement it is largely true.",5,Golden Age Tim Burton,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,6077,"['8217',

1484744,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIIA8,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Shot in beautiful black and white, ""Frankenweenie"" is a stop-motion animation directed by Tim Burton. Based on his 1984 short film ""Frankenweenie,"" the new version follows the story of Victor Frankenstein (voice by Charlie Tahan), a young student aspiring to be a scientist living in suburbia New Holland. Victor has a dog named ""Sparky,"" his best friend (and ""star"" of Victor's home-made monster flick).Then one tragic event happens: Sparky's untimely death. Victor is shocked and dejected, but he thinks of a plan to bring Sparky back to life when he sees a demonstration of scientific experiment by his teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi in Burton's ""Ed Wood"").You can say ""Frankenweenie"" is director Tim Burton's most personal or autobiographical movie; by saying ""autobiographical"" I mean the film is filled with memories of what he liked (and still likes) in his childhood. There are so many references to classic horror movies - from Elsa Lanchester to a windmill - as well as jokes poking fun at pop culture including one popular Sanrio character.But the film itself, even at 87 minutes, feels a little drawn-out, especially at its mid-section. The film suddenly loses steam after Victor's attempts to resurrect Sparky, with a story about his classmates' schemes to win the upcoming science fair, which I found pretty dull. The subplot about Mr. Rzykruski, who looks scary but actually a nice teacher (and is probably the most interesting human character), is not fully developed.Still, I can say with ""Frankenweenie"" Tim Burton is back in form. What the film needs is some more time about the bond between Victor and Sparky, a lovely dog who is the star of the film.

When you have a year of coincidentally gothic animated films like ParaNorman and Hotel Transylvania, the master behidn this sub-genre artform has kicked in to his 'comfort zone' with probably his best work in recent years along with Corpse Bride. What brings its rather grand scope of excellence is its willingness to pay homage to the 50s B-movie horror classics especially works like The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers but through a child's perspective. The treatment of its rather grim subjects at PG (death/rebirth, bereavement, scientific tinkering) is all handled without seeming preachy or overtly sick/disturbing but as a matter of fact and integral to where the story was going in its own self. It has elements of humor, black-and-white effects work, and very fluid and archaic animation style that reminds us of how Rankin & Bass and Ray Harryhausen never fled the minds off our most brilliant filmmakers. While a short film exists, I preferred viewing this well-done work on its own seeing the recent one before the old 80s version. Even amidst its pluses, a few negatives exist with the rather fast-paced story, character development, focus time, and overall timing of things making it seem like it brushes past you (at less than 90 minutes) and a rather weak ending does make the film slightly suffer. Nevertheless, give Tim Burton a chance from a dud like Alice in Wonderland and see what he can with his own work, like Vincent, before seeing the original.""",4,"A throwback to what makes Burton great!

I was overjoyed when given this DVD as gift because I did not have the opportunity to see it as it came out.  I thought for certain I would love it. A B-movie style version of Frankenstein told with a boy and his dog. What's not to love? Unfortunately, the entire movie had the feel of an idea that was never quite enough to become a feature-length movie and should have remained a short. You can't argue with the visual artistry, but after the first hour of it, you are definitely &#34;over it&#34; and ready for some plot and character development that just never happens. You are ready for a dash of humor...but that doesn't really happen (unless you consider to be humorous the odd moments of lost bodypart or water leaking from stitches or flies crawling out of body).
