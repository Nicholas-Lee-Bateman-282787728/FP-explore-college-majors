501701,A1ZAVMB4XZL8KA,B00000I1IL,"Bookreader79424 ""I love Casa Ole!""","[6, 8]","""Stella"" (1990) deserves 5 stars because it is a wonderful mother-daughter movie. ""Stella"" is about a young mother, played by Bette Midler, who has a daughter named ""Jenny,"" out-of-wedlock, whose father is a Harvard-educated medical doctor played by Stephen Collins. Bette Midler plays a bar-tender and this is how Stephen Collins and Bette Midler meet.Sadly, the two never do get married, realizing that they are two very different people, whose interests are too varied and come from two very completely different worlds (of course in real-life that doesn't always matter, but I digress). They part on amicable terms, the father accepting, full moral responsibility for his daughter by paying child support and seeing her as much as he can (which he should).Incidentally, you can't help, but get rather annoyed by the characters (i.e., ""Stella"") etc. because you want them to get married because they are nice enough, but it does make sense that they shouldn't and don't get married, since they are two completely different people on two different paths, but I digress.Back to the movie review...Bette Midler and her daughter, ""Jenny"" have everyday problems. ""Jenny"" inherits her dad's intelligence and her mother's quick wit and no-nonsense attitude, and they argue a lot, but are as close as a mother and daughter can become.The main idea is about a single mom, whose a bar-tender, her daughter, her mother's best-friend and the mother's and daughter's dynamic relationship and succeeding on their own; despite, living in almost dire straits. Despite this, Bette Midler's character comes across as a strong, independent, hard-working, single parent, who dearly loves her daughter and wants only the best for her daughter and tries to give it to her, difficult as that is.Aside, from the mother and daughter problems that arise, a major problem ensues when ""Jenny"" and her mother have an argument around Christmas-time. It's fully understood why ""Jenny"" and her mother argue because ""Jenny"" also wants the best for her mother, and her mother doesn't know how to do that, but tries to do so, on her own terms, although, not with great success. As a side note, unfortunately, for this film you won't find Bette Midler's character arising out of poverty, but you will come across with the clear message that no matter what, moms and daughters can overcome anything when they have each other to lean on. Referring back to the film, ""Jenny"" has been invited to visit her dad and so decides to visit him; despite, her feeling bad that her mother will be left behind (which is really sad, I think they should of had the mother go because who would want their mom spending Christmas alone, I know I wouldn't) goes ahead and visits her. Upon arriving at her dad's girlfriend's palatial home she gets a taste of the good life; after all, her dad is a doctor, whose a Harvard graduate and after returning home to her mother begins to look down upon her mother, played by Bette Midler because ""Jenny"" begins to notice class distinctions between her parents and begins to resent her mother more because her mother doesn't have the finances her father does. Of course, ""Jenny"" unconditionally loves her mother, she simply resents the fact that her mother isn't rich and successful like her dad.Realzing that she has never given her daughter an extravagant gift due to lack of finances, Bette Midler's character decides in the summer that they are going on vacation to Florida. Sadly, Bette Midler's character is zany, and trying to be her daughter's friend as opposed to her mother and parent first, and wears some type of outfit that is unusual and is deemed foolish by a group of gaggling snobs on the beach, who make hateful remarks and ""Jenny"" as well as her mother, played by Bette Midler overhear and it upsets them both, which is quite agitating because even though you know it's only a movie, you can't help but wish you were there in the movie and tell those obnoxious teens how rude and what heathens they are, but anyhow, on a sad note, they're happy--only to become saddened again by these rude teens (who wouldn't be, of course after being laughed at), but anyhow, they arrive back home and eventually ""Jenny"" gets upset with her mother again and threatens to live with her dad snd on that note...I will let you see the movie, in order, to find out what happens next to ""Jenny"" and ""Stella.""Ultimately, the movie is an excellent film showing that money doesn't matter, but that you enjoy life, and that a mother and daughter's relationship goes through turbulent times--and not only is your mother first and foremost your mom, but she's also the best friend you can ever have and the character, ""Jenny"" never really loses sight of this, she just gets side-tracked because she wants her mom to be the ""perfect parent,"" and of course, that never does nor can happen, but despite all of this, ""Jenny"" and ""Stella"" are close.In conclusion, this film is highly recommended for mothers and their teenage daughter(s) because you will be able to relate to ""Stella"" and her daughter, ""Jenny"" and their turblent times; despite, your social standing because the film supercedes all social class barriers and gives you a glimpse of how a mother and daughter overcome their problems.*(Highly recommended for anyone 15 and above due to proganity other more milder adult themes).***Please keep in mind that my age suitable factors are probably more conservative than most, due to the fact, that many of today's films contain profanity and other adult themes (e.g., marital infidelity, etc.) and are deemed inappropriate for any age, but especially, for young children and adolescents to view; hence, what might be construed by the majority as too strigent, I keep a conservative stance on my age recommendations for these aforementioned reasons.***My recommendation is to always view a film before allowing your children, or teenagers to see it, then you can decide based upon your moral & religious beliefs whether or not this an appropriate film for you and/or your child(ren) to see.",5,"Poignant, yet sad, that's what this one reviewer is saying...",1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,6073,"['Stella', '1990', '5', 'stars',

I didn't expect much because even though I like Bette she has never moved me as others have like Barbra Streisand but I was surprised how much I liked the movie.  I think the acting was wonderful and everyone was good in his or her roles.  Finding someone to play Bette Midler's daughter probably was not easy but the casting department hit a home run with Trini Alvarado.This movie could have been better if it were treated more importantly. While watching the movie I kept thinking that with the right cinematography (more close ups of Bette, especially when she is trying to make her daughter believe that she doesn't want her anymore...she is at the sink in the kitchen and she has to turn around and let her have it...you could tell Stella was thinking ""okay, here it goes, this better be good) and to dim the lights in the bar...too much light...didn't look realistic).  A strong director and better editor could have polished this movie up to a high gloss shine.Some of the story did not ring true and could have been more consistent...like Stella going down to Florida and dressing and acting outrageously, while during the rest of the film her appearance was not so extreme.Sorry the DVD did not have extras...it also was not treated very importantly.All in all very entertaining...thank you, Miss Bette, you are divine!",3,Very good but...,1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,1444,"['Writing', 'review', 'was', 'something', 'wanted', 'do', 'got', 'done', 'seeing', 'Stella', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'DVD', 'rental', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'even', 'like', 'Bette', 'never', 'moved', 'others', 'have', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'movie', 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'everyone', 'was', 'good', 'roles', 'Finding', 'someone', 'play', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'daughter', 'probably', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'casting', 'department', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'Trini', 'Alvarado.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'were', 'treated', 'more', 'importantly', 'watching', 'movie', 'kept', 'thinking', 'right', 'cinematography', 'more', 'close', 'ups', 'Bette', 'especially', 'when', 'trying', 'make', 'daughter', 'believe', ""n't"", 'want', 'anymore', 'sink', 'kitchen', 'turn', 'around', 'let', 'have', 'could', 'tell', 'Stella', 'was', 'thinking', 'okay', 'here', 'better', 'be', 'good', 'dim', 'lights', 'bar', 'too', 'much', 'light', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'realistic', 'strong', 'director', 'better', 'editor', 'could', 'have', 'polished', 'movie', 'up', 'high', 'gloss', 'shine.Some', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'consistent', 'Stella', 'going', 'down', 'Florida', 'dressing', 'acting', 'outrageously', 'rest', 'film', 'appearance', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'extreme.Sorry', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'extras', 'also', 'was', 'not', 'treated', 'very', 'importantly.All', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thank', 'Miss', 'Bette', 'are', 'divine']",Stella VHS
501713,A8M4WE1MT4R4O,B00000I1IL,thomas angelo zunich,"[6, 7]","Quoted by Marlon Brando, the title of my review is how i feel about this film.  My mother turned me on to this film, so it has sentimental value to me.  Bette Midler gives a raunchy yet riveting performance as Stella  Dallas, a fiesty, headstrong single mother raising her illigimate daughter,  Jenny.  Both actresses play out their characters with love and emotion.  You can tell that they both actually cared about the characters they were  playing and it shows through their performances.  Standing ovations for  both Bette Midler and Trini Alvarado.  There is also wonderful acting all  across the board in this film.  John Goodman plays an intoxicating drunk  with heart!  Stella is the kind of movie that will make you laugh and cry,  sincerely.

How can't I?I also adored this movie -- right up until the end.The film is nothing particularly Earth shattering. It is, however, a sweet, well told, genuine story of a single mother's relationship with her daughter.My mother took me to see this in the theater when I was very young -- probably only 7 or 8 years old. I recently rented it, remembering having liked it as a child.It held up -- the movie was still moving, still touching.My MAJOR complaint is with the ending.We are made to believe that a lower income, blue collar single mother can't succesfully raise a child without lying to her, convincing her she doesn't want her anymore, and turning her over to her richer father. What kind of values are these. Worse, what kind of message does it send about the effectiveness of single mothers?As the child of an exquisite single mother, I resent the assertion that I had nary a chance to make it without the presence of a wealthy male.",2,Horrid Message,1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,990,"['few', 'clarifying', 'comments-I', 'adore', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'How', 'ca', ""n't"", 'also', 'adored', 'movie', 'right', 'up', 'end.The', 'film', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'Earth', 'shattering', 'however', 'sweet', 'well', 'told', 'genuine', 'story', 'single', 'mother', 'relationship', 'daughter.My', 'mother', 'took', 'see', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'probably', 'only', '7', '8', 'years', 'old', 'recently', 'rented', 'remembering', 'having', 'liked', 'child.It', 'held', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'moving', 'still', 'touching.My', 'MAJOR', 'complaint', 'ending.We', 'are', 'made', 'believe', 'lower', 'income', 'blue', 'collar', 'single', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'succesfully', 'raise', 'child', 'lying', 'convincing', ""n't"", 'want', 'anymore', 'turning', 'over', 'richer', 'father', 'What', 'kind', 'values', 'are', 'Worse', 'what', 'kind', 'message', 'send', 'effectiveness', 'single', 'mothers', 'child', 'exquisite', 'single', 'mother', 'resent', 'assertion', 'had', 'chance', 'make', 'presence', 'wealthy', 'male']",Stella VHS

It didn't get much praise and was called a sleeper, but the cast and this movie will make you laugh and cry.

""Stella"" is about the relationship of a mother and daughter (in reality it could be any dysfuncional family) and how fate deals it's cards to the ""unfortunate"".  It doesn't help that Stella is jaded and a B@#$%. This movie captures a mother's maturnal instinct who wants the best for her only child.  Stella deals with the cards that are dealt to her in the game of life.  She is impoverished but well read and because of the ""BS"", OVER IT.  Bette Midler captures this type of character with a realness you rarely see on film.  I see similarities to my own mother so I guess that's why I can indentify with her.
