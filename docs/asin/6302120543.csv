296705,A2HCS608K512VS,6302120543,"Barbara Amell ""editor, Wingfold""","[0, 0]","While this film presents a highly fictionalized account of George Gershwin's life, the recreations of numerous performances of his incomparable music preserved here are very important. Highlights include Gershwin's operetta 'Blue Monday,' cut from a review show after only one performance; Al Jolson introducing 'Swanee' to his adoring audience; Paul Whiteman, who commissioned 'Rhapsody in Blue,' conducting the original arrangement for piano and band from its debut at Aeolian Hall; Anne Brown, the original Bess, singing 'Summertime' onstage surrounded by the sets from 'Porgy and Bess'; extensive excerpts from orchestral works 'Concerto in F,' 'An American in Paris,' and the lesser-known 'Cuban Overture'; and of course many sublime Gershwin songs, well-known and obscure. Oscar Levant, concert pianist and friend of the Gershwins who plays himself in the film, recorded the Gershwin piano numbers for lead actor Robert Alda, and there was no one better qualified at that time to embody Gershwin's technique and dynamics. The script was a victim of the era: The fact that Gershwin was Jewish is strictly avoided, several other details on his life are inaccurate, and Gershwin the legendary womanizer is replaced by a man torn between two fictional females. But the great virtue of this movie is the lavish amount of time spent presenting George Gershwin's music: the expectations for an audience's attention in the 1940s could help nurture more respect for the art of music today. There are sadly no DVD extras on the making of the film, and no commentary. Robert Alda is curiously listed last in the credits online, even though he is featured in nearly every scene from George Gershwin's adult years.",4,Music of Great Value,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,1707,"['film', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'life', 'recreations', 'numerous', 'performances', 'incomparable', 'music', 'preserved', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Gershwin', 'operetta', ""'Blue"", 'Monday', 'cut', 'review', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'performance', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'introducing', ""'Swanee"", 'adoring', 'audience', 'Paul', 'Whiteman', 'who', 'commissioned', ""'Rhapsody"", 'Blue', 'conducting', 'original', 'arrangement', 'piano', 'band', 'debut', 'Aeolian', 'Hall', 'Anne', 'Brown', 'original', 'Bess', 'singing', 'onstage', 'surrounded', 'sets', ""'Porgy"", 'Bess', 'extensive', 'excerpts', 'orchestral', 'works', ""'Concerto"", 'F', ""'An"", 'American', 'Paris', 'lesser-known', ""'Cuban"", 'Overture', 'course', 'many', 'sublime', 'Gershwin', 'songs', 'well-known', 'obscure', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'concert', 'pianist', 'friend', 'Gershwins', 'who', 'film', 'recorded', 'Gershwin', 'piano', 'numbers', 'lead', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'qualified', 'time', 'embody', 'Gershwin', 'technique', 'dynamics', 'script', 'was', 'victim', 'era', 'fact', 'Gershwin', 'was', 'Jewish', 'strictly', 'avoided', 'several', 'other', 'details', 'life', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'Gershwin', 'legendary', 'womanizer', 'replaced', 'man', 'torn', 'two', 'fictional', 'females', 'great', 'virtue', 'movie', 'lavish', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'presenting', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'music', 'expectations', 'audience', 'attention', '1940s', 'could', 'help', 'nurture', 'more', 'respect', 'art', 'music', 'today', 'are', 'sadly', 'DVD', 'extras', 'making', 'film', 'commentary', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'curiously', 'listed', 'last', 'credits', 'online', 'even', 'featured', 'nearly', 'scene', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'adult', 'years']",Rhapsody in Blue VHS

296708,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6302120543,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[30, 33]","Robert Alda stars in this odd, melodramatic potboiler which looks at the rags-to-rich (and more riches) rise of one of America's greatest popular composers.  The film is hampered by a few small points, one being that Gershwin's life doesn't readily lend itself to dramatic portrayal (until the very end, when he drops dead at a very young age, and your jaw just drops)... The problem is that guy was just too darn successful!  He hit a groove and never stopped, moving from one huge critical success to another (with one or two flops in between)... The scriptwriters were obviously aware of this, and insert several belabored sequences wherein Gershwin anguishes over this or that, and a couple of sniffly, symbolic deathbed scenes, just for good measure.  Other problems include Alda himself (yes, he's Alan's dad...) who isn't completely up to the role, as well as the weak portrayal of George's brother Ira, a super-brilliant, super-important lyricist, who is here presented as a mere hanger-on and cheerleader for his brother, the big-shot genius.  Hello?  Excuse me... Ira Gershwin?!?  Of the Gershwin brothers?  Oh, forget it.  Oh, also check out Gershwin's kooky pal Oscar Levant, who plays himself, in a somewhat true-to-life portrayal as George's confidant and stand-in concertizer.  Other celebrities who play themselves here include Al Jolson and bandleader Paul Whiteman... and the music, of course, can't be beat.",4,"Not historically accurate, but still good fun.",1052438400,"05 9, 2003",2003,1426,"['Robert', 'Alda', 'odd', 'melodramatic', 'potboiler', 'rags-to-rich', 'more', 'riches', 'rise', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'popular', 'composers', 'film', 'hampered', 'few', 'small', 'points', 'one', 'being', 'Gershwin', 'life', ""n't"", 'readily', 'lend', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'dead', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'jaw', 'just', 'drops', 'problem', 'guy', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'darn', 'successful', 'hit', 'groove', 'never', 'stopped', 'moving', 'one', 'huge', 'critical', 'success', 'one', 'two', 'flops', 'scriptwriters', 'were', 'obviously', 'aware', 'insert', 'several', 'belabored', 'sequences', 'wherein', 'Gershwin', 'couple', 'sniffly', 'symbolic', 'deathbed', 'scenes', 'just', 'good', 'measure', 'Other', 'problems', 'include', 'Alda', 'yes', 'Alan', 'dad', 'who', ""n't"", 'completely', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'weak', 'portrayal', 'George', 'brother', 'Ira', 'super-brilliant', 'super-important', 'lyricist', 'who', 'here', 'presented', 'mere', 'hanger-on', 'cheerleader', 'brother', 'big-shot', 'genius', 'Hello', 'Ira', 'Gershwin', 'Gershwin', 'brothers', 'Oh', 'forget', 'Oh', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'Gershwin', 'kooky', 'pal', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'who', 'somewhat', 'true-to-life', 'portrayal', 'George', 'confidant', 'stand-in', 'concertizer', 'Other', 'celebrities', 'who', 'play', 'here', 'include', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'bandleader', 'Paul', 'Whiteman', 'music', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat']",Rhapsody in Blue VHS

296710,AB9Q52OYE7E6N,6302120543,"G. Schneider ""old movie buff""","[0, 0]","This movie is allegedly the life story of George Gershwin. Why (tell me, please) when a biography of a composer is presented in chronological order cannot the music be likewise chronologically correct? Example: The Gershwin family are living in a rather luxurious apartment on Riverside Drive (after countless slum dwellings in Brooklyn and The Bronx), paid for entirely by income from Gershwin's various song successes, the most recent of which (seen in a lavish production number) is ""'S Wonderful."" Then, later on, we see brother Ira fooling around with lyrics and George thinks it's a great idea for them to collaborate. Excuse me, Ira, but weren't you the one who wrote the ""'S Wonderful"" lyrics? I thought so!In the movie, there are only two Gershwin offspring: Ira and George. Whatever happened to brother Arthur and sister Frances? (Ira's first lyrics were written under the pseudonym of ""Arthur Francis,"" a name derived from the two other siblings, so as not to appear to be cashing in on George's success.) I wonder how they felt about being completely written out of existence? In similar fashion, Fred and Adele Astaire, for whom at least three shows were specifically written, no longer exist. However, two ""love interests"" are there. Okay, so George purportedly had a 10-year ""affair"" with composer Kay Swift, and supposedly a fling with actress Paulette Goddard. But as far as I'm concerned, he was a closet homosexual, something which, if true, brother Ira would have denied vehemently. (In fact, I believe he did, in print, many years later. At any rate, George certainly wasn't pursuing the two women in the movie!)The music, of course, is the main and perhaps sole asset of the movie. The writing and too often the acting sucks. Unfortunately, due to time limitations, his major compositions -- ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" ""An American in Paris,"" ""Concerto in F"" -- are all truncated. There's a running bit with George's father timing each composition and saying such things as ""Fourteen minutes. A very important composition!"" He says this about the rhapsody...except that if they hadn't shortened it for the movie, it would have been closer to 20 minutes. (The premiere performance lasted longer than the usual 17 minutes because a whole section which would later be cut was still included.)""An American in Paris"" is the only Gershwin concert work that doesn't include a piano part. (There's a brief celeste solo in the blues section, which Gershwin himself played on the premiere recording since they'd forgotten to hire anyone.) In the film, when the piece is first performed, there are two pianos and pianists onstage. Wonder what they were playing...?But the movie does end with that shot of the camera looking down on Oscar Levant's hands as he's playing the rhapsody, then craning up and up until the entire Lewissohn Stadium and its packed audience are a speck on the landscape. (I remembered it as the Hollywood Bowl, but hey, it was 50 years ago when I first saw this film!)",3,"Great Music, Minimal Historical Accuracy",1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,2996,"['movie', 'allegedly', 'life', 'story', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'Why', 'tell', 'please', 'when', 'biography', 'composer', 'presented', 'chronological', 'order', 'can', 'not', 'music', 'be', 'likewise', 'chronologically', 'correct', 'Example', 'Gershwin', 'family', 'are', 'living', 'rather', 'luxurious', 'apartment', 'Riverside', 'Drive', 'countless', 'slum', 'dwellings', 'Brooklyn', 'Bronx', 'paid', 'entirely', 'income', 'Gershwin', 'various', 'song', 'successes', 'most', 'recent', 'seen', 'lavish', 'production', 'number', ""'S"", 'Wonderful', 'Then', 'later', 'see', 'brother', 'Ira', 'fooling', 'around', 'lyrics', 'George', 'great', 'idea', 'collaborate', 'Excuse', 'Ira', 'were', ""n't"", 'one', 'who', 'wrote', 'Wonderful', 'lyrics', 'thought', 'so', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'Gershwin', 'offspring', 'Ira', 'George', 'happened', 'brother', 'Arthur', 'sister', 'Frances', 'Ira', 'first', 'lyrics', 'were', 'written', 'pseudonym', 'Arthur', 'Francis', 'name', 'derived', 'two', 'other', 'siblings', 'so', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'cashing', 'George', 'success', 'wonder', 'how', 'felt', 'being', 'completely', 'written', 'existence', 'similar', 'fashion', 'Fred', 'Adele', 'Astaire', 'whom', 'least', 'three', 'shows', 'were', 'specifically', 'written', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'However', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'there', 'Okay', 'so', 'George', 'purportedly', 'had', '10-year', 'affair', 'composer', 'Kay', 'Swift', 'supposedly', 'fling', 'actress', 'Paulette', 'Goddard', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'was', 'closet', 'homosexual', 'something', 'true', 'brother', 'Ira', 'would', 'have', 'denied', 'vehemently', 'fact', 'believe', 'did', 'print', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'rate', 'George', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'pursuing', 'two', 'women', 'movie', 'music', 'course', 'main', 'perhaps', 'sole', 'asset', 'movie', 'writing', 'too', 'often', 'acting', 'sucks', 'Unfortunately', 'due', 'time', 'limitations', 'major', 'compositions', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'American', 'Paris', 'Concerto', 'F', 'are', 'truncated', 'running', 'bit', 'George', 'father', 'timing', 'composition', 'saying', 'such', 'things', 'Fourteen', 'minutes', 'very', 'important', 'composition', 'rhapsody', 'had', ""n't"", 'shortened', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'closer', '20', 'minutes', 'premiere', 'performance', 'lasted', 'longer', 'usual', '17', 'minutes', 'whole', 'section', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'cut', 'was', 'still', 'included', 'American', 'Paris', 'only', 'Gershwin', 'concert', 'work', ""n't"", 'include', 'piano', 'part', 'brief', 'celeste', 'solo', 'blues', 'section', 'Gershwin', 'played', 'premiere', 'recording', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'hire', 'anyone', 'film', 'when', 'piece', 'first', 'performed', 'are', 'two', 'pianos', 'pianists', 'onstage', 'Wonder', 'what', 'were', 'playing', 'movie', 'end', 'shot', 'camera', 'looking', 'down', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'hands', 'playing', 'rhapsody', 'then', 'craning', 'up', 'up', 'entire', 'Lewissohn', 'Stadium', 'packed', 'audience', 'are', 'speck', 'landscape', 'remembered', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'hey', 'was', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film']",Rhapsody in Blue VHS

Aside from the fact that we're talking about a major film about a major American composer with a cast of major stars, the economics of a decision like this is imbecilic.The manufacturing costs of DVDs and CDs today are incredibly low. (I'm not referring to the content costs, which can run into the millions, so you pirates out there aren't getting any help from me.) Anyone off the street can get 500 replicated DVDs, with a full color cover in a standard ""Amaray"" case, for under $1200.00. That's about $2.40 each for properly replicated DVDs, which have a very low failure rate and will be compatible with just about any player.To have the same project ""duplicated""- i.e. run off just a few copies at a time - by a reputable business, costs somewhere between $2.50 and $8.00 for each copy, depending on how many are done at a time. Usually 300 copies will cost about $750.00, or about $2.50 each.I guess the geniuses at whatever company is responsible for this amateurish sham (please tell me Warner wasn't responsible) not only decided that they'd never be able to sell a few hundred copies of Rhapsody, but that it's worth the trouble of having to deal with all of the returns that are sure to come, because DVD-Rs are very picky about which players they like. The DVD-R format is fine for passing out a very limited amount of copies within a business or family, etc. or testing projects - concerts, shows and the like - to see if everything is working properly before going to the final (replicated) DVD. But unless you know that you're dealing with something with such a limited amount of sales potential, going to DVD-R is just false economy. What a shame this company has so little faith in something they've decided to make available to us!And a shame it is, for what a marvelous treat to have this film available. Yes, sometimes the script gets a little too gushy for our 2012 tastes. The constant smiles, everybody so agreeable with each other, especially early on, might cause a few eyeballs to roll. And staying a bit more faithful (but less entertaining?) to some historical facts might be nice. But we're dealing with Hollywood here, so considering what else they give us; it's really a small price to pay to witness so much brilliant performing. Seeing and hearing the likes of Hazel Scott, a major leaguer both vocally and at the piano, was astonishing. The short sequence from Porgy and Bess with Anne Brown, who starred in the original production, singing Summertime is worth the price of admission by itself. Hearing and seeing Al Jolson, in his prime (even though his performing in ""blackface"" will be a turnoff for some) reminds us that he really could sing. I never realized what a great low register he actually had. The orchestral performances, even though truncated, were excellent. Indeed, they hold up very well over 60 years later. Though watching Paul Whitman, with what looked like a 4-foot long baton, as stiff as could be was a scream! The mono sound is very listenable.I not only found Robert Alda a credible George Gershwin, but also was amazed watching him at the piano. While there were some places where it looked a bit fishy, they tended to be the ones where you couldn't see his fingers. Maybe his shoulders weren't quite moving with the direction of the music. However when he was entirely visible, including fingers, it was so convincing that I couldn't believe Oscar Levant was actually on the sound track. And listen to Oscar's performances. Even though he was such a character, his playing contained none of the affectations that we have grown accustomed to with our current crop of wunderkinds. Performances by Charles Coburn and Joan Leslie, who had a lovely singing voice, were also credible. But first and foremost we're reminded that there's a good reason why Gershwin's music is as alive today as it was 80 years ago.",4,What were . . .,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,4349,"['one', 'time', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'wished', 'look', 'eye', 'person', 'charge', 'ask', 'something', 'what', 'hell', 'were', 'thinking', 'man', 'decision', 'distributing', 'duplicated', 'DVD-R', 'rather', 'normal', 'replicated', 'DVD-V', 'was', 'put', 'hands', 'human', 'being', 'days', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'sure', 'whom', 'decided', 'would', 'save', 'company', 'duplicating', 'small', 'batch', 'time', 'rather', 'having', 'short', 'run', '500', 'replicated', 'Aside', 'fact', ""'re"", 'talking', 'major', 'film', 'major', 'American', 'composer', 'cast', 'major', 'stars', 'economics', 'decision', 'imbecilic.The', 'manufacturing', 'costs', 'DVDs', 'CDs', 'today', 'are', 'incredibly', 'low', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'content', 'costs', 'can', 'run', 'millions', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'help', 'Anyone', 'street', 'can', 'get', '500', 'replicated', 'DVDs', 'full', 'color', 'cover', 'standard', 'Amaray', 'case', '1200.00', 'about', '2.40', 'properly', 'replicated', 'DVDs', 'have', 'very', 'low', 'failure', 'rate', 'will', 'be', 'compatible', 'just', 'player.To', 'have', 'same', 'project', 'duplicated', 'i.e', 'run', 'off', 'just', 'few', 'copies', 'time', 'reputable', 'business', 'costs', 'somewhere', '2.50', '8.00', 'copy', 'depending', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'done', 'time', 'Usually', '300', 'copies', 'will', 'cost', '750.00', '2.50', 'each.I', 'guess', 'geniuses', 'whatever', 'company', 'responsible', 'amateurish', 'sham', 'please', 'tell', 'Warner', 'was', ""n't"", 'responsible', 'not', 'only', 'decided', ""'d"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'few', 'hundred', 'copies', 'Rhapsody', 'trouble', 'having', 'deal', 'returns', 'are', 'sure', 'come', 'DVD-Rs', 'are', 'very', 'picky', 'players', 'like', 'DVD-R', 'format', 'fine', 'passing', 'out', 'very', 'limited', 'amount', 'copies', 'business', 'family', 'etc', 'testing', 'projects', 'concerts', 'shows', 'like', 'see', 'everything', 'working', 'properly', 'before', 'going', 'final', 'replicated', 'DVD', 'know', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'something', 'limited', 'amount', 'sales', 'potential', 'going', 'DVD-R', 'just', 'false', 'economy', 'What', 'shame', 'company', 'so', 'little', 'faith', 'something', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'make', 'available', 'shame', 'what', 'marvelous', 'treat', 'have', 'film', 'available', 'Yes', 'sometimes', 'script', 'little', 'too', 'gushy', '2012', 'tastes', 'constant', 'smiles', 'everybody', 'so', 'agreeable', 'other', 'especially', 'early', 'might', 'cause', 'few', 'eyeballs', 'roll', 'staying', 'bit', 'more', 'faithful', 'less', 'entertaining', 'historical', 'facts', 'might', 'be', 'nice', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'Hollywood', 'here', 'so', 'considering', 'what', 'else', 'give', 'really', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'witness', 'so', 'much', 'brilliant', 'performing', 'Seeing', 'hearing', 'likes', 'Hazel', 'Scott', 'major', 'leaguer', 'vocally', 'piano', 'was', 'astonishing', 'short', 'sequence', 'Porgy', 'Bess', 'Anne', 'Brown', 'who', 'starred', 'original', 'production', 'singing', 'Summertime', 'price', 'admission', 'Hearing', 'seeing', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'prime', 'even', 'performing', 'blackface', 'will', 'be', 'turnoff', 'really', 'could', 'sing', 'never', 'realized', 'what', 'great', 'low', 'register', 'actually', 'had', 'orchestral', 'performances', 'even', 'truncated', 'were', 'excellent', 'Indeed', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', '60', 'years', 'later', 'watching', 'Paul', 'Whitman', 'what', 'looked', '4-foot', 'long', 'baton', 'as', 'stiff', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'scream', 'mono', 'sound', 'very', 'listenable.I', 'not', 'only', 'found', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'credible', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'also', 'was', 'amazed', 'watching', 'piano', 'were', 'places', 'where', 'looked', 'bit', 'fishy', 'tended', 'be', 'ones', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'fingers', 'Maybe', 'shoulders', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'moving', 'direction', 'music', 'However', 'when', 'was', 'entirely', 'visible', 'including', 'fingers', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'was', 'actually', 'sound', 'track', 'listen', 'Oscar', 'performances', 'Even', 'was', 'such', 'character', 'playing', 'contained', 'none', 'affectations', 'have', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'current', 'crop', 'wunderkinds', 'Performances', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'Joan', 'Leslie', 'who', 'had', 'lovely', 'singing', 'voice', 'were', 'also', 'credible', 'first', 'foremost', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'Gershwin', 'music', 'alive', 'today', 'was', '80', 'years', 'ago']",Rhapsody in Blue VHS

It is a classic black and white movie about the world of music, no doubt.  Another one of those neglected beauties.  Yes, it is not accurate in its biographical detail of Gershwin, but the spirit of his genius and music is caught here.

There are simply no Hollywood biopics that do justice by the indigenous American art of jazz or popular song, but some at least are 1. moderately entertaining, 2. include generous segments of the featured artist's music, and 3. ""enhance"" without falsifying the historical circumstances of the composer's life.""Rhapsody in Blue"" introduces viewers to the real ""Tin Pan Alley"" and to the young George who once hustled his music in W. 34th St. music houses until getting the public's and Al Jolson's attention with what would become his first popular hit song, ""Swanee.""  Like most of the other great songwriters of the 20s and 30s, George was lured to Hollywood, where he found money but not happiness and companionship.  And like the other great Jewish-American composers of American popular song (Porter and Ellington being the two notable exceptions), he would return to New York and Broadway for his defining artistic triumphs. The film ends with a sentimental but, in many respects, moving and effective performance of ""Concerto in F,"" played by George Levant for his friend George Gershwin, who hears it on the radio before expiring.The film does a better job with Gershwin's ""serious"" music, referencing ""Porgy and Bess"" in addition to the ""Concerto"" and the title song, than his prolific and distinguished pop song oeuvre.  But  it does include fascinating footage of not just Al Jolson but Paul Whiteman (the conductor known as the ""King of Jazz"" in the 1920s) and pianist-vocalist Hazel Scott (outstanding keyboardist who was married at one time to Adam Clayton Powell and who put out a trio LP with a rhythm section comprising jazz immortals Charles Mingus and Max Roach!)Sure, the film has some corny and leaden dialogue, and neither musically nor narratively is it up to another biopic, ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" a delightful B&W; film that charges headlong through a dazzling cavalcade of Irving Berlin tunes.  But ""Rhapsody in Blue""'s shortcomings are more than compensated for by the musicians and the music.  No apologies needed.Compared to time and mind-wasters like ""Patch Adams"" or ""Forrest Gump"" the script reads like Ingmar Bergman--or Shakespeare.  As for the DVD, previous reviewers are right.

Levant's presence in the film lends it some historical authenticity. Also present are Al Jolson, a legendary figure in the history of American popular entertainment and the interpreter of Gershwin's single most popular song, ""Swanee"", and Paul Whiteman, the bandleader who collaborated with Gershwin in the premiere of Rhapsody in Blue. (Fred Astaire is sorely missed.)

This film tells the story of his brief life and brilliant career.Tho most notable things about this movie are the music and the guest stars. &quot;Rhapsody in Blue,&quot; &quot;An American in Paris,&quot; and &quot;Swannee&quot; are all performed in with great skill and in their entirety. Excerpts from many other pieces are heard also. Much of the music is presented in what we might call &quot;music video style,&quot; with montages and editing that help bring out the sources and meanings of the music. Al Jolson, Paul Whiteman, and Oscar Levant all play themselves and perfom Gershwin's music on screen. George White, Hazel Scott, Anne Brown, John B. Hughes, and Tom Patricola also appear as themselves.The performances range from the really good to the over-characterized to the kind of stiff. This being a Hollywood bio-pic of a Great American composer, everyone (except for the old stiff who ran the song publisher Gershwin quit) is noble, generous, and cool. Robert Alda (father of Alan) plays the compser, and his performance most has the stilted mannerisms of one trying not to disrespect a legend. Oscar Levant establishes his &quot;tough guy&quot; persona which he carried through several films. Morris Carnovsky as &quot;Poppa&quot; and Herbert Rudley as Ira Gershwin give two of the sronger performances.One interesting aspect of this film is the role of Black people. There is irony in the fact that Blues and Jazz are forms of music that essentially were developed by Black musicians, and here was a White person taking it a step further, bringing it to audiences that had not appreciated it before. The irony is emphasized by seeing where black people are in this movie. There is a development of the relationship of his music to black people. At first, his &quot;Black&quot; songs are sung by white performers in blackface (Al Jolson is never seen without it), but later he sees a black female singer in Paris and his opera is sung by an all black cast. However, there are no other Black people in the entire movie except the obligatory maids and servants. This may be good fodder for an examination of music and social history.If you love this music (and it IS glorious) add a star to this review. Aside from that, it is a good bio-pic that accurately covers the events of Gershwin's live and examines his motivation, his drive to push the boundaries of what could be done with music.",4,"MUSIC-FUL HOLLYWOOD BIO-PIC, AND WHAT MUSIC!",985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,2582,"['George', 'Gershwin', 'one', 'giants', 'American', 'composers', 'transformed', 'popular', 'music', 'brought', 'Jazz', 'Blues', 'stylings', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'classical', 'concert', 'hall', 'film', 'story', 'brief', 'life', 'brilliant', 'career.Tho', 'most', 'notable', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'music', 'guest', 'stars', 'quot', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Paris', 'quot', 'quot', 'Swannee', 'quot', 'are', 'performed', 'great', 'skill', 'entirety', 'Excerpts', 'many', 'other', 'pieces', 'are', 'heard', 'also', 'Much', 'music', 'presented', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'quot', 'music', 'video', 'style', 'quot', 'montages', 'editing', 'help', 'bring', 'out', 'sources', 'meanings', 'music', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'Paul', 'Whiteman', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'play', 'perfom', 'Gershwin', 'music', 'screen', 'George', 'White', 'Hazel', 'Scott', 'Anne', 'Brown', 'John', 'B.', 'Hughes', 'Tom', 'Patricola', 'also', 'appear', 'themselves.The', 'performances', 'range', 'really', 'good', 'over-characterized', 'kind', 'stiff', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'bio-pic', 'Great', 'American', 'composer', 'everyone', 'old', 'stiff', 'who', 'ran', 'song', 'publisher', 'Gershwin', 'quit', 'noble', 'generous', 'cool', 'Robert', 'Alda', 'father', 'Alan', 'compser', 'performance', 'most', 'stilted', 'mannerisms', 'one', 'trying', 'not', 'disrespect', 'legend', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'quot', 'tough', 'guy', 'quot', 'carried', 'several', 'films', 'Morris', 'Carnovsky', 'quot', 'Poppa', 'quot', 'Herbert', 'Rudley', 'Ira', 'Gershwin', 'give', 'two', 'sronger', 'performances.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'role', 'Black', 'people', 'irony', 'fact', 'Blues', 'Jazz', 'are', 'forms', 'music', 'essentially', 'were', 'developed', 'Black', 'musicians', 'here', 'was', 'White', 'person', 'taking', 'step', 'further', 'bringing', 'audiences', 'had', 'not', 'appreciated', 'irony', 'emphasized', 'seeing', 'where', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'movie', 'development', 'relationship', 'music', 'black', 'people', 'first', 'quot', 'Black', 'quot', 'songs', 'are', 'sung', 'white', 'performers', 'blackface', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'never', 'seen', 'later', 'black', 'female', 'singer', 'Paris', 'opera', 'sung', 'black', 'cast', 'However', 'are', 'other', 'Black', 'people', 'entire', 'movie', 'obligatory', 'maids', 'servants', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'fodder', 'examination', 'music', 'social', 'history.If', 'love', 'music', 'IS', 'glorious', 'add', 'star', 'review', 'Aside', 'good', 'bio-pic', 'accurately', 'events', 'Gershwin', 'live', 'motivation', 'drive', 'push', 'boundaries', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'music']",Rhapsody in Blue VHS
