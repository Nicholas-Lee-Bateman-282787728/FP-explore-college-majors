They've linkedANIMAL, an urban drama with an all African-American and Hispanic cast, toTHE ANIMAL, a silly farce with Rob Schneider. My review is on the latter..THE ANIMAL (2001) is a minor comedy (rated 4.6 at IMDb) that stars Rob Schneider, plus the lovely Colleen Haskell, John C. McGinley (as a jealously villainous top cop), Ed Asner (as chief of police), also demented cameos from Adam Sandler and Norm McDonald.Here, Rob is Marvin Mange, a police department property room attendant who wants to be a real cop, but he's too feeble to pass the rigorous field test. After his car rolls off a cliff and tumbles down a hill it's left crushed. Marvin barely survives the accident. Rendered unconscious and bodily broken, he's rescued by a scientist who operates and saves Marvin's life with organ transplants from various animals.Now this new police proby is able to sniff out drugs hidden in smugglers' butts, outrun a horse and swim like a dolphin, plus he has superhuman jumping and hearing abilities. Marvin's also having problems remembering he's still mostly human (wants to mate with a goat, eat hands-free like a ravenous dog, etc.).It's cute, occasionally amusing but forgettable.",3,"Marvin: ""Now that's some good Badger Milk.""",1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,1223,"['Looks', 'AMMY', 'done', 'again', ""'ve"", 'linkedANIMAL', 'urban', 'drama', 'African-American', 'Hispanic', 'cast', 'toTHE', 'ANIMAL', 'silly', 'farce', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'review', 'latter..THE', 'ANIMAL', '2001', 'minor', 'comedy', 'rated', '4.6', 'IMDb', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'lovely', 'Colleen', 'Haskell', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'jealously', 'villainous', 'top', 'cop', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'chief', 'police', 'also', 'demented', 'cameos', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Norm', 'McDonald.Here', 'Rob', 'Marvin', 'Mange', 'police', 'department', 'property', 'room', 'attendant', 'who', 'be', 'real', 'cop', 'too', 'feeble', 'pass', 'rigorous', 'field', 'test', 'car', 'rolls', 'off', 'cliff', 'down', 'hill', 'left', 'crushed', 'Marvin', 'barely', 'accident', 'Rendered', 'unconscious', 'bodily', 'broken', 'rescued', 'scientist', 'who', 'Marvin', 'life', 'organ', 'transplants', 'various', 'animals.Now', 'new', 'police', 'proby', 'able', 'sniff', 'out', 'drugs', 'hidden', 'smugglers', 'butts', 'outrun', 'horse', 'swim', 'dolphin', 'superhuman', 'jumping', 'hearing', 'abilities', 'Marvin', 'also', 'having', 'problems', 'remembering', 'still', 'mostly', 'human', 'mate', 'goat', 'eat', 'hands-free', 'ravenous', 'dog', 'etc', '.It', 'cute', 'occasionally', 'amusing', 'forgettable']",N/A
672304,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005OCJP,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Yes, it's true Animal feels like a slightly low budget action film with some cheesy dialogue occupying the majority of the storyline, but for the most part, I'm impressed with the characters, the suspense, the action, and of course, the storytelling.A father commits a crime and has to go away to jail.  When he's finally released several years later, lots of things have changed by that point involving his family, and specifically his younger son who had to grow up without a father.Well when the father finally returns home, everything seems fine at first, but eventually family issues come into the picture and everything goes wrong from there.  I don't want to spoil the things that happen though, since that would spoil the storyline for you, the readers.Anyway, the actual ""animal"" segments (the parts where the father plays a vicious fighter in jail who isn't afraid of anyone) wasn't utilized enough to give the movie its name in my opinion, so in that small respect, the storyline has some disappointing segments.Also, Animal isn't straight-up action packed- instead, there's plenty of storyline building slowly and interestingly to the action segments, which actually helps us appreciate the violent scenes when they finally occur that much more.Still, the focal point should be what occurs as soon as the father is released, and of course the very beginning of the film when you see why the father is in jail to begin with.I have a soft spot for movies like these- whatever people think of the storytelling and the acting skills involving all the characters (I personally am not bothered in the least by either of these) the fact remains I remained interested in Animal from beginning to end, so that's why I feel like it deserves 5 stars.",5,action drama at its best,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,1751,"['Yes', 'true', 'Animal', 'feels', 'slightly', 'low', 'budget', 'action', 'film', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'occupying', 'majority', 'storyline', 'most', 'part', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'characters', 'suspense', 'action', 'course', 'storytelling.A', 'father', 'crime', 'go', 'away', 'jail', 'When', 'finally', 'released', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'lots', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'point', 'involving', 'family', 'specifically', 'younger', 'son', 'who', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'father.Well', 'when', 'father', 'finally', 'home', 'everything', 'fine', 'first', 'eventually', 'family', 'issues', 'come', 'picture', 'everything', 'wrong', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'things', 'happen', 'would', 'spoil', 'storyline', 'readers.Anyway', 'actual', 'animal', 'segments', 'parts', 'where', 'father', 'vicious', 'fighter', 'jail', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'anyone', 'was', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'name', 'opinion', 'so', 'small', 'respect', 'storyline', 'disappointing', 'segments.Also', 'Animal', ""n't"", 'straight-up', 'action', 'packed-', 'instead', 'plenty', 'storyline', 'building', 'slowly', 'interestingly', 'action', 'segments', 'actually', 'appreciate', 'violent', 'scenes', 'when', 'finally', 'occur', 'much', 'more.Still', 'focal', 'point', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'as', 'soon', 'father', 'released', 'course', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'why', 'father', 'jail', 'begin', 'with.I', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'movies', 'these-', 'people', 'think', 'storytelling', 'acting', 'skills', 'involving', 'characters', 'personally', 'am', 'not', 'bothered', 'least', 'fact', 'remained', 'interested', 'Animal', 'beginning', 'end', 'why', 'feel', '5', 'stars']",N/A

He's constantly picked on by senior citizens, obese people, andDr. Cox; he also has the tendency to lose his bowels, which at one point he tooted in front of future girl-toy, a tree-hugger named Rianna. When he received a distress call, he drove to the scenic route until a swerve got him flying across the bottom of the mountain, crashing into rocks along the way.  Although that should've killed him on the first collision, he just got comedically knocked out after several.  He was then discovered by a mad scientist that implanted him animal parts to make him into a superbeing: faster, stronger, sniffier. That's not how it works, but hey, it's here for laughs, right?No.All I'm seeing is Schneider getting himself into another situation to embarrass himself, but now everyone gets hit with the stupid stick. No one seems to be bugged by the fact that he has these weird abilities or the fact that he sniffs butts for drugs; in fact, people in the film ask questions if he can sniff butts out of anyone.

Chances are if you're reading this review you know somewhat of what it's about, have seen the movie (why else would you purchase the video?) or are planning on seeing it sometime soon. Well, here's my opinion.  The acting of &quot;Survivor&quot; cast member Colleen Haskell wasn't too bad.  She is cute and has had some training before her days stranded at the beach.  I think she could've done a little better but hey-it's her movie debut!  I thought Rob Schneider's acting was very good.  People are sometimes too serious about movies and in this case they were.  It wasn't meant to be Oscar of the year here.  It did not deserve the 3 and a half stars it got.  Rather, I think it was pretty good.  And creative as well!  The director did a VERY good job in terms of trying to make us &quot;forget&quot; that Rob's character Marvin has been in a car accident until we see a flashback of his time of being put together with different animal parts.  I also liked the chase at the end, not to mention a down-right FUNNY cameo by Norm McDonald.  Just great!  It was really well done for the director tries and makes us guess who the bad guy actually is. I'm not gonna give away the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, nor go into intricate detail.  Just explaining on how creative and funny it is...The Animal should not be left out in your collection but that is only if you find it funny.  So I urge you to rent it first and then purchase it on video...which is what I am about to do!

(Including a group of kids at the police station, which is hilarious). Then some man finds him after a horrific accident. And replaces most of his bodies parts with animal parts.

What is rendered for the film is what the film receives.  It doesn't expect anything more than over-blown pesky crud for itself.  Why should the audience capitulate to the nonsense as well, and take part in upraising this below-the-belt butt scratcher?  Everyone sustaining this film complains that the film is &quot;stupid-funny&quot;.  One 'half-chuckle' was all that slipped from my mouth.  This film, in my opinion, is suitable to be known as just plain stupid.Rob Schneider plays a nerd evidence investigator who's low life living, and under-achieved dreams are suddenly shaken after he takes a crash down a steep hill, and nearly dies.  After being found unconscience, a maniac doc figues that the only way to save his life is to put animal organs in him which include: Dog, seal, goat, dolphin, horse...etc.  After waking up the next morning by his damaged car, Schneider doesn't realize he's been missing for eight days.  Now this savage and hormonal beast is after a goregous pet dealer and is also on the run from the cops.  Can the animal subdue and resist his abnormality in this downright rampadoodle junker?Obviously he can only save his own character, because the movie goes over the cliff after a group of eight year olds beat up Schneider's character at the police station in the opening of the film.  There is the classic &quot;boring cop&quot; field trip in which every kid picks on the dumb cop.  Then, the cool and buff cop says- &quot;you want to meet a real police officer?&quot;  And the kids go bonanza.Expectedly, there is also the black man who feels that every white person treats him nice simply because he's of that race.  Isn't this racism/anti-racism thing going a little bit overboard?  I mean, we already have Chris Tucker and Chris Rock nipping at the chip on that plate, why generate more and more?  It's old news.  The whole &quot;Black-man/racism&quot; thing just doesn't muster the laughs anymore.Adam Sandler makes a cameo in the film, more of a waste actually, after the whole town is after Schneider.  When they finally catch him and surround him, Sandler takes Schneider's previous cameos of THE WATERBOY and LITTLE NICKY, and says, &quot;Cut his freaking ...!&quot;  Many of you know the rest.  This overdone appearance is getting old too.  The major letdown is that Sandler CAN'T do it like Rob.  It's not funny at all.A plot with a mouse's brain, acting with an icing of cow pies, and an overall effect of insecure stupidity sets a new standard for idiotic films.  THE ANIMAL is here, and sadly, it seems like it has rabies.QUOTE: &quot;This film is flat out dead.  It has no sense of comedy, nor a feel for what the audience wants.  It is just &quot;Dumb&quot;.

Even among a particular type, there is not universal agreement as to what's funny and what's not. Take slapstick, or physical, humor, which is what The Animal uses. I am in the group that is most amused by seeing witty, bright and/or sophisticated characters trip, fall or otherwise embarrass themselves. Another group most enjoys seeing clumsy and/or dimwitted people doing what they do best. I don't think either group is right or wrong. It's a matter of personal taste, and it's those who enjoy seeing idiots doing idiotic things who will most enjoy The Animal.Rob Schneider plays Marvin, a hopelessly inept guy who works in the evidence room of the local police department. He has become a laughing stock among most of his coworkers because he has tried and failed a half dozen times to become a real policeman. One afternoon, the entire force goes off to play softball, leaving Marvin to watch the station. When a call about a robbery in progress comes in, no one at the game responds to Marvin's radio call. He goes off in his car to aid the victim, but he never makes in. In an inspired bit of slapstick, he veers off the road to avoid hitting a trained seal. A screaming Marvin is trapped in the car as it rolls down an embankment. When if finally stops, Marvin tells himself that wasn't so bad, but then the vehicle slips over the edge and rolls and rolls some more. It comes to its finally resting place, Marvin breaths a sigh of relief, and suddenly, a huge boulder rolls over it. Marvin then dreams he is on an operating table in a weird hospital. It turns out he has been operated on by a mad doctor who has repaired him by using animal parts. It isn't long before the hapless Marvin finds himself behaving like a horse, a dog, a goat, and even a beaver. This problem leads to a myriad of sight gags and one-liners. Since these involve animal behavior, you can easily figure out what comic level they are one.Rob Schneider is what he is, and he delivers the material his fans expect. His fan base comes from his stint on Saturday Night Live. He built on this by appearing is nearly all of Adam Sandler's movies. Not coincidentally, Mr. Sandler was an executive producer on The Animal, as well as on Schneider's 1999 hit, Deuce Bigelow.While this is not my brand of comedy, I must admit that it has its moments. Schneider certainly tries hard. The Animal is also much gentler and sweeter than most comedies this year. Even if you don't much like its hero, it's hard not to feel a little empathy for such a nice guy.",2,Beastly movie,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,2641,"['Comedies', 'may', 'be', 'hardest', 'kind', 'movies', 'review', 'type', 'humor', 'funny', 'everyone', 'Even', 'particular', 'type', 'not', 'universal', 'agreement', 'what', 'funny', 'what', 'not', 'Take', 'slapstick', 'physical', 'humor', 'what', 'Animal', 'uses', 'am', 'group', 'most', 'amused', 'seeing', 'witty', 'bright', 'and/or', 'sophisticated', 'characters', 'trip', 'fall', 'otherwise', 'embarrass', 'group', 'most', 'seeing', 'clumsy', 'and/or', 'dimwitted', 'people', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'group', 'right', 'wrong', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'who', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'idiots', 'doing', 'idiotic', 'things', 'who', 'will', 'most', 'enjoy', 'Animal.Rob', 'Schneider', 'Marvin', 'hopelessly', 'inept', 'guy', 'who', 'evidence', 'room', 'local', 'police', 'department', 'become', 'laughing', 'stock', 'most', 'coworkers', 'tried', 'failed', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'become', 'real', 'policeman', 'One', 'afternoon', 'entire', 'force', 'play', 'softball', 'leaving', 'Marvin', 'watch', 'station', 'When', 'call', 'robbery', 'progress', 'one', 'game', 'Marvin', 'radio', 'call', 'off', 'car', 'aid', 'victim', 'never', 'inspired', 'bit', 'slapstick', 'road', 'avoid', 'hitting', 'trained', 'seal', 'screaming', 'Marvin', 'trapped', 'car', 'down', 'embankment', 'When', 'finally', 'Marvin', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'then', 'vehicle', 'edge', 'rolls', 'more', 'finally', 'resting', 'place', 'Marvin', 'sigh', 'relief', 'suddenly', 'huge', 'boulder', 'rolls', 'Marvin', 'then', 'operating', 'table', 'weird', 'hospital', 'out', 'been', 'operated', 'mad', 'doctor', 'who', 'repaired', 'using', 'animal', 'parts', ""n't"", 'long', 'hapless', 'Marvin', 'behaving', 'horse', 'dog', 'goat', 'even', 'beaver', 'problem', 'myriad', 'sight', 'gags', 'one-liners', 'involve', 'animal', 'behavior', 'can', 'easily', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'comic', 'level', 'are', 'one.Rob', 'Schneider', 'what', 'material', 'fans', 'expect', 'fan', 'base', 'stint', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'built', 'appearing', 'nearly', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'Not', 'coincidentally', 'Mr.', 'Sandler', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'Animal', 'as', 'well', 'Schneider', '1999', 'hit', 'Deuce', 'Bigelow.While', 'not', 'brand', 'comedy', 'must', 'admit', 'moments', 'Schneider', 'certainly', 'hard', 'Animal', 'also', 'much', 'gentler', 'sweeter', 'most', 'comedies', 'year', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'hero', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'little', 'empathy', 'such', 'nice', 'guy']",N/A

""The Animal"" is a cute story about Marvin-- a sweet, loser, wanna-be cop (he just can't seem to pass the physical fitness test to become a full-fledged officer) who, after a freak accident and some freaky secret surgery, becomes the best cop on the force.  Suddenly Marvin can run twice as fast, jump twice as high, and his sense of smell and his hearing are totally heightened.  Marvin becomes a super-cop!Why???  Because when he received new organs and such from his freaky surgery, the organ donors were animals!  The animal parts inside him are making him a better cop....but there are also some side effects.  Marvin needs to deal with his ""animal sub-conscious"" before it ruins his chances with his dream girl, Rianna, and before it gets him kicked off the police force-- after all, we can't stand for cops who pee on fire hydrants and chase cats up trees can we?  No.Overall the movie was quite enjoyable.  Rob Schneider is comical and the other cast members (including the animals!) really help dole out the laughs too.  Colleen Haskell (a former Survivor castaway) had a respectable debut in this movie but I don't think the part was much of a stretch for her, it just wasn't a very demanding role.  It's not that hard for a cutie-pie to be a cutie-pie.  She was cute and super sweet and that's all she had to do...sit there and look cute.  Not too hard to do...you know what I mean???One last thought....Rob Schneider basically played a monkey-man (well, more like a cat/dog man).  I wonder if he was the first actor they thought of for the role.  Doesn't it seem like Brendan Fraser would have been the obvious choice?  I mean, he kinda dominates the monkey-man genre doesn't he?  I'm glad they didn't cast Fraser...it probably wouldn't have been as funny, it would have been a re-run.Recommendation:  This is a cute and silly movie.  Sure the plot is a little weak and the ending seemed a little thrown together, but overall it was enjoyable--  a nice little escape from the summer heat.  The sexual humor is pretty toned down (nothing like ""Monkeybone"", I swear!) and although there are a few gross jokes there are far less than there could have been (thank you writers!).  The film is rated PG-13 but I could see letting a younger child watch it, the humor wasn't very offensive at all (a nice change).",3,The Animal-- Popkorn Junkie's (and my) review,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,2451,"['like', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'like', 'most', 'movies', 'been', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'surprising', 'liked', 'Animal', 'as', 'well', 'Animal', 'cute', 'story', 'Marvin', 'sweet', 'loser', 'wanna-be', 'cop', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pass', 'physical', 'fitness', 'test', 'become', 'full-fledged', 'officer', 'who', 'freak', 'accident', 'freaky', 'secret', 'surgery', 'best', 'cop', 'force', 'Suddenly', 'Marvin', 'can', 'run', 'twice', 'fast', 'jump', 'twice', 'as', 'high', 'sense', 'smell', 'hearing', 'are', 'totally', 'heightened', 'Marvin', 'super-cop', 'Why', 'when', 'received', 'new', 'organs', 'such', 'freaky', 'surgery', 'organ', 'donors', 'were', 'animals', 'animal', 'parts', 'are', 'making', 'better', 'cop', '.but', 'are', 'also', 'side', 'effects', 'Marvin', 'deal', 'animal', 'sub-conscious', 'chances', 'dream', 'girl', 'Rianna', 'kicked', 'off', 'police', 'force', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'cops', 'who', 'pee', 'fire', 'hydrants', 'chase', 'cats', 'trees', 'can', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'comical', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'including', 'animals', 'really', 'help', 'dole', 'out', 'laughs', 'too', 'Colleen', 'Haskell', 'former', 'Survivor', 'castaway', 'had', 'respectable', 'debut', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'part', 'was', 'much', 'stretch', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'demanding', 'role', 'not', 'hard', 'cutie-pie', 'be', 'cutie-pie', 'was', 'cute', 'super', 'sweet', 'had', 'do', 'sit', 'look', 'cute', 'Not', 'too', 'hard', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'One', 'last', 'thought', '.Rob', 'Schneider', 'basically', 'played', 'monkey-man', 'well', 'more', 'cat/dog', 'man', 'wonder', 'was', 'first', 'actor', 'thought', 'role', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'choice', 'mean', 'monkey-man', 'genre', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'cast', 'Fraser', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'been', 're-run.Recommendation', 'cute', 'silly', 'movie', 'Sure', 'plot', 'little', 'weak', 'ending', 'seemed', 'little', 'thrown', 'together', 'overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'little', 'escape', 'summer', 'heat', 'sexual', 'humor', 'pretty', 'toned', 'down', 'nothing', 'Monkeybone', 'swear', 'are', 'few', 'gross', 'jokes', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'writers', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'could', 'see', 'letting', 'younger', 'child', 'watch', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'offensive', 'nice', 'change']",N/A

672350,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005OCJP,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","""The Animal"" is a lightweight comedy that uses animal-related slapstick to get laughs. Rob Schneider plays Marvin Mange, a none-too-bright lackey who wants to be a policeman. He is constantly taunted in achieving his goal by Ed Asner as Chief Wilson, and the wonderful John C. McGinley (who you will know from a similar portrayal in television's ""Scrubs"") as Sergeant Sisk. It's a given that there's a pretty girl up for grabs, this time played by the lovely Colleen Haskell, who is a fellow animal lover.Mange has a terrible (and amusing; watch for the seal and a Bigfoot cameo) car accident that results in his being infused with animal parts, giving him various superhuman powers. (One of the crudest, yet entertaining, examples occurs in Ed Asner's office, and that's all I'm going to say about it.) Mange doesn't understand at first what has happened to him, and credits drinking badger milk for his newfound gifts; the ""Badger Milk"" infomercial and product are both quite amusing. I had no idea badger milk was so viscous!Marvin becomes a hero largely thanks to his superhuman sense of smell (don't even ask about this...) and rescues the Mayor's son from drowning in a lake, swimming like a dolphin. There is lots of animal related humor, some of it crude (e.g. orangutan flatus, regurgitating worms to a turkey vulture chick, territorial marking, hairballs, etc.) I was especially amused when he was fitted with a ""satellite head"" collar to prevent his chewing on himself: while it may not sound especially funny, it was a visually stunning effect. I could have done without Marvin's amorous overtures (with a Capra aegagrus hircus) while ""Let's Get It On"" oozes across the soundtrack, although he did get his just rewards in a rather amusing scene.After a string of chupacabraesque attacks on livestock, a hunt is on focused on Marvin, but all is not as it seems: I actually did not foresee the ending of the film, although I thought that Ed Asner summed it up pretty well with his final line, ""These pantyhose are killing me.""""The Animal"" DVD features several extras including commentaries and a special feature called ""Badger Delivery."" When you turn the Badger Delivery option on, an icon is periodically displayed. When you make a selection on your remote when the icon is in view, an extra featuring Schneider comes up and explains extra footage that was edited out and then shows the clip. I had never seen that technique done quite that way, and I liked it.This film is fairly brainless and inoffensive. Unsurprisingly, it is occasionally crude, frequently stupid, but also more entertaining than I really expected it to be. While there are definitely better movies out there, you could definitely do worse. I give ""The Animal"" three stars because badgers are fun.",3,"""A Badger Can Lift Twenty Times His Body Weight!

This film is a bit of a cliche on the old plot of how a guy is picked on, something happens to him, and everybody ends up working out for him at the end; but that's okay because this movie works with that cliche by putting in a hysterical plot in the middle of it all, alas, the title of the film.Robb Schneider plays a guy that works for the police department's crime evidence department because he could never pass the physical exam to become a real police officer. Because of this he is made fun of by his peers. When he gets into a car accident a crazy scientist puts animal parts into him giving him animal traits and this causes him to have bad experiences with other people. This plot is what works around the old cliche and it actually makes for a fun-filled movie watching experience.The reason that I am giving this film just four stars is because the movie is very far fetched and is nothing that takes place in this comedy is unlikely to ever happen. However, this movies shows how one person can overcome all the odds, even if by physical means, to finally get what he or she really deserves. The movie also has a bit of romance that is very light and is brought on in a comical way. These things will make viewers of this film appreciate this film on an emotional level as well as a level for the comedy.This film is great comedy because Robb Schneider is in it. Schneider is one of the top comic actors in filmmaking today and because of him this film really shines. &quot;The Animal&quot; is a must for a fan of Robb Schneider or for anyone that is looking for a comedy that will keep you laughing.

Marvin Mange(Rob Schneider), a sort-of cop gets into an accident and is put back together with the innards of various animals. This seems like an extremely insane idea especially when it is considered that when given any new organ, large doses of medication are recieved by the patient and sometimes the body does not even accept the new organ. The reason that recieving animal body parts works in this movie is that it is stupid. It also makes no sense that he should inherit all of the attributes given to each animal. This movie feels like an extended SNL skit. Maybe the film would be funnier if it was cut into many pieces and shown on SNL but it wasn't.

672362,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005OCJP,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Rob Schneider is ""The Man with Animal Parts.""  That's it.  Period.  And what's wrong with that?Rob's character Marvin got some surgery (without doctor's informed consent) to have enormous power of various kinds of animals.  So, Marvin, previously known as a big loser, can act like a dog (see how he can catch a flying object); like a cat (vomiting a fur ball); and like a dolphin (well, see it for yourself).  And he does lots of silly, silly things such as making love with a mailbox on the street (don't ask me why).  It's a pity that I cannot convey the hilarious sensations of watching those funny turns of Rob Schneider, but if you know him, probably I don't have to, I guess.  if you don't, remember this.  ""The Animal"" is admittedly very stupid, and shows plenty of 'cheap' gags, and the film is co-executive-produced by Adam Sandler, so you know what you're gonna witness.But, cheap as they are, the gags are done with certain kind of power, and Rob Schneider does his best to create the silliest situations possible, which are without doubt a joy to watch.  And if you try to imagine the patience and efforts put into making those 'silly' things (like, swimming like a real dolphin), I must say I feel even respect to him.  You know, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world to be dragged in not-so-clean water, strapped to some machine, and to act like a dolphin convincingly (and joyfully).  Or, look at him when he feeds a baby bird with his mouth wide open.  Yeah, it's an  absolutely crazy gag, but I guess the bird must have picked his lips too so hard, instead of the food (whatever it is).  It's easy for us to dismiss this kind of comedy as silly, but when you see it next time, keep these things in mind.Anyway, the only criteria I can use here is, whether or not I laughed watching the film, and I did.  And I found Colleen Haskell fairly good (oh, forget these Reality TV things).
