1326728,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B0035MA5HS,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[0, 0]","Out of all four Beatles John Lennon is perhaps the most romanticized and celebrated of them all. And it doesn't have as much to do with his death as it does his life. The public shared in his trials and tribulations from the Beatle era onward but all the same there was a side of Lennon that only he really fully knew. And this movie deals with this period of his life. It's a period that was explored some years ago in a similarly themed TV movie that actually spilled over into the Beatle era and his family life with Cynthia and son Julian. This movie however focuses right in on the earliest part of his life,from his mid teens days all the way up through his first journey to Hamburg with Paul McCartney and George Harrison and that is the note on which the film concludes. However what's in between says a lot about not only the music he created but his entire adult personality.We start with John Winston Lennon as a teenager living with his Aunt Mimmie when his uncle suddenly dies and from there on we deal with the trauma's and occasional joys of this man. In the beginning we're not confronted with merely another frusterated artist trying to break out but with a fairly average,directionless teen with a very troubled past and psyce. John journey's with a friend to Blackpool in an attempt to reconnect with his mother Julia whom he finds now has another family at that time. It goes on this way with the story of John being tugged at between two sisters:there's Mimi with her inherantly loving but strict and unyielding tastes and Julia,who herself is a basically as loving to John as her sister but doesn't possess a strong enough sense of inner responsibility to be much of a parent in the long run. We also learn why this living situation exists;as small boy John had been literally asked to chose between living with either his two flighty and free spirited mother or absenty father before Mimi decides to take John in to raise him herself to prevent him from winding up a ward of the state.Young John finds himself drawn to music with his mothers interest in rock n roll and her teaching him how to play the guitar. We then follow on with what is now part of Lennon/Beatle lore:his beginnings in the local skiffle group The Quarreymen,his first meeting with Paul McCartney and George Harrison and before we know it John's family situation is abruptly put to a close when his mom Julia is killed in a car accident. Interestingly this occurance led to a brotherly closeness between John and Paul,whose mother had died herself only his Paul's case of cancer. Lennon's music tends to be the more reflective,personal and pained songs in the Beatles catalog and in many cases some of the most beloved. And with this wonderfully directed and acted film one is given a close view into the world from which Lennon embarked from into becomming one of the major cultural and musical icons of his generation. It doesn't idealize Lennon or indulge in any huge theatrics in any way;it just presents his youth as it was and in many ways breaks down a lot of the adulation that John Lennon had to deal with throughout his life and even after his death.",5,Just A Lad From Liverpool Finding A Way Through Life,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,3154,"['four', 'Beatles', 'John', 'Lennon', 'perhaps', 'most', 'romanticized', 'celebrated', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'death', 'life', 'public', 'shared', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Beatle', 'era', 'onward', 'same', 'was', 'side', 'Lennon', 'only', 'really', 'fully', 'knew', 'movie', 'period', 'life', 'period', 'was', 'explored', 'years', 'ago', 'similarly', 'themed', 'TV', 'movie', 'actually', 'spilled', 'Beatle', 'era', 'family', 'life', 'Cynthia', 'son', 'Julian', 'movie', 'however', 'right', 'earliest', 'part', 'life', 'mid', 'teens', 'days', 'way', 'up', 'first', 'journey', 'Hamburg', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'George', 'Harrison', 'note', 'film', 'concludes', 'However', 'what', 'lot', 'not', 'only', 'music', 'created', 'entire', 'adult', 'personality.We', 'start', 'John', 'Winston', 'Lennon', 'teenager', 'living', 'Aunt', 'Mimmie', 'when', 'uncle', 'suddenly', 'there', 'deal', 'trauma', 'occasional', 'joys', 'man', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'not', 'confronted', 'merely', 'frusterated', 'artist', 'trying', 'break', 'out', 'fairly', 'average', 'directionless', 'teen', 'very', 'troubled', 'past', 'psyce', 'John', 'journey', 'friend', 'Blackpool', 'attempt', 'reconnect', 'mother', 'Julia', 'whom', 'now', 'family', 'time', 'way', 'story', 'John', 'being', 'tugged', 'two', 'sisters', 'Mimi', 'inherantly', 'loving', 'strict', 'unyielding', 'tastes', 'Julia', 'who', 'basically', 'loving', 'John', 'sister', ""n't"", 'possess', 'strong', 'enough', 'sense', 'inner', 'responsibility', 'be', 'much', 'parent', 'long', 'run', 'also', 'learn', 'why', 'living', 'situation', 'small', 'boy', 'John', 'had', 'been', 'literally', 'asked', 'chose', 'living', 'two', 'flighty', 'free', 'spirited', 'mother', 'absenty', 'father', 'Mimi', 'take', 'John', 'raise', 'prevent', 'winding', 'up', 'ward', 'state.Young', 'John', 'drawn', 'music', 'mothers', 'interest', 'rock', 'roll', 'teaching', 'how', 'play', 'guitar', 'then', 'follow', 'what', 'now', 'part', 'Lennon/Beatle', 'lore', 'beginnings', 'local', 'skiffle', 'group', 'Quarreymen', 'first', 'meeting', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'George', 'Harrison', 'know', 'John', 'family', 'situation', 'abruptly', 'put', 'close', 'when', 'mom', 'Julia', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Interestingly', 'occurance', 'led', 'brotherly', 'closeness', 'John', 'Paul', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'only', 'Paul', 'case', 'cancer', 'Lennon', 'music', 'be', 'more', 'reflective', 'personal', 'pained', 'songs', 'Beatles', 'catalog', 'many', 'cases', 'most', 'beloved', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'acted', 'film', 'one', 'given', 'close', 'view', 'world', 'Lennon', 'embarked', 'becomming', 'one', 'major', 'cultural', 'musical', 'icons', 'generation', ""n't"", 'idealize', 'Lennon', 'indulge', 'huge', 'theatrics', 'way', 'just', 'youth', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'breaks', 'down', 'lot', 'adulation', 'John', 'Lennon', 'had', 'deal', 'life', 'even', 'death']",Nowhere Boy
1326729,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0035MA5HS,Andy Orrock,"[3, 4]","This nice little movie takes you historically through point in time when John Lennon gets his first guitar to when he announces that he and his new mates Paul and George have scored their 'little' gig in Hamburg, Germany.  I say 'little' here facetiously because far from 'little,' it was the Hamburg experience the forged the identity of The Beatles.  [An aside: For a great examination of what Hamburg meant to the Beatles, listen to Malcolm Gladwell's outstandingOutliers: The Story of Success).]'Nowhere Boy' gives us Lennon at the apex of his youthful rebellion...and the accompanying angst related to his confusing maternal situation.  'Nowhere Boy' depicts mother Julia as flighty, unstable and incapable of the long-term commitment of motherhood.  She is, however, also creative, spirited, musical and unique.  Julia's sister, Mary ('Aunt Mimi'), is by contrast depicted as a stern disciplinarian and in it for the long haul.  In terms of her attitude to music, it's summed up by her famous line, ""The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.""  Mimi is, however, also shown to possess a sly but fierce intellect.  Director Sam Taylor-Wood shows some witty repartee and quick, punning wordplay between Kristin Scott Thomas' Mimi and Aaron Johnson's John.  The John Lennon the world came to know is equal parts these two maternal influences.Director Taylor-Wood and designers Alice Normington, Kimberley Fahey and Barbara Herman-Skelding do a marvelous job re-creating Liverpool of the late fifties/early sixties.  This was an England still bobbing along in austere, post-World War II style.  The look of the film perfectly captures a grayer, tight-fisted, more cossetted nation...one that would indelibly change a few short years in the future, in no small part due to John and his bandmates. Contributing to the success of that look is young Mr. Johnson himself.  He is, at times, the spitting image of Lennon...especially when donning those NHS-issued specs.This movie has some resonating pop culture influence as well: star Johnson and director Taylor-Wood - with 23 years in age difference - are engaged to be married.  Taylor-Wood gave birth to their daughter in July 2010.",4,Lennon the world came to know is shown here as equal parts Julia and Mimi,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2216,"['nice', 'little', 'movie', 'historically', 'point', 'time', 'when', 'John', 'Lennon', 'first', 'guitar', 'when', 'new', 'mates', 'Paul', 'George', 'have', 'scored', ""'little"", 'gig', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'say', 'here', 'facetiously', 'far', ""'little"", 'was', 'Hamburg', 'experience', 'forged', 'identity', 'Beatles', '[', 'aside', 'great', 'examination', 'what', 'Hamburg', 'meant', 'Beatles', 'Malcolm', 'Gladwell', 'outstandingOutliers', 'Story', 'Success', ""'Nowhere"", 'Boy', 'Lennon', 'apex', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'accompanying', 'angst', 'related', 'confusing', 'maternal', 'situation', 'Boy', 'depicts', 'mother', 'Julia', 'flighty', 'unstable', 'incapable', 'long-term', 'commitment', 'motherhood', 'however', 'also', 'creative', 'spirited', 'musical', 'unique', 'Julia', 'sister', 'Mary', ""'Aunt"", 'Mimi', 'contrast', 'depicted', 'stern', 'disciplinarian', 'long', 'haul', 'terms', 'attitude', 'music', 'summed', 'up', 'famous', 'line', 'guitar', 'very', 'well', 'John', ""'ll"", 'never', 'make', 'living', 'Mimi', 'however', 'also', 'shown', 'possess', 'sly', 'fierce', 'intellect', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Taylor-Wood', 'witty', 'repartee', 'quick', 'punning', 'wordplay', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Mimi', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'John', 'John', 'Lennon', 'world', 'came', 'know', 'equal', 'parts', 'two', 'maternal', 'influences.Director', 'Taylor-Wood', 'designers', 'Alice', 'Normington', 'Kimberley', 'Fahey', 'Barbara', 'Herman-Skelding', 'do', 'marvelous', 'job', 're-creating', 'Liverpool', 'late', 'fifties/early', 'sixties', 'was', 'England', 'still', 'bobbing', 'along', 'austere', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'style', 'look', 'film', 'perfectly', 'grayer', 'tight-fisted', 'more', 'cossetted', 'nation', 'one', 'would', 'indelibly', 'change', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'future', 'small', 'part', 'due', 'John', 'bandmates', 'Contributing', 'success', 'look', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Johnson', 'times', 'spitting', 'image', 'Lennon', 'especially', 'when', 'donning', 'NHS-issued', 'specs.This', 'movie', 'resonating', 'pop', 'culture', 'influence', 'as', 'well', 'star', 'Johnson', 'director', 'Taylor-Wood', '23', 'years', 'age', 'difference', 'are', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'Taylor-Wood', 'gave', 'birth', 'daughter', 'July', '2010']",Nowhere Boy

I'm so icked out by the blatantly sexual flirtation between Lennon and his mother that I could hardly focus on anything else. Fifteen minutes in and my skin is crawling... but I soldiered through. You know, it's not a horrible movie - if you watch it as a movie. If you watch it as a true story about John Lennon's teenage years... well, you'll probably be scarred for life.The fact that this almost incestuous feeling tale is based onImagine This: Growing Up with My Brother John Lennonmakes matters worse. Julia's daughter saw this, this way? Ew, I hope not!As for casting, I'm not a fan of the fact that 17 year old John looks 21 and 15 year old Paul looks pre-pubescent, but the actors are good enough to make me forget that oddity. And Paul DOES still have a baby face...ON THE OTHER HAND... the story is entertaining, historical inaccuracies (and the ew factor) not withstanding. John's relationships with his mother and his aunt are a bit more glorified than most other accounts indicate - and I forgive the aunt aspect because he DID maintain a lifelong connection with her... but mom? The ladies aside, the movie works.

1326731,A26FPHC71C5IX3,B0035MA5HS,Aryael de Kaprii,"[0, 1]","This movie is about the life of John Lennon before the Bettles became the Bettles. His is a touching story about a young John, raised by his aunt because unbeknownst to John his biological mother was just not stable.  John was a wild child but a good kid just doing what he felt he needed to do. The love his aunt had for him was very moving, she was strict and somewhat cold, but even she could not mask the fact that she adored John and would have died without him. The movie has alot of dramatic moments that really tug at the heart-strings, but in the end really comes together with a happy conclusion.  Again this movie is not about the Beetles it is about a young John Lennon even though you get see the beginning stages of the group that will later morph into the Beetles. Now about Aaron Johnson, this is a young actor in his early 20s who is showing some real talent. He was in the movie Kick-Ass and a couple of other films that were not marketed as well as Kick-Ass. He is a really attractive young man, whom I think was at one time a model. I really look foward to seeing his next films and I hope that he stands out in hollywood soon.  He is just too beautiful to let slide by.

1326732,A30TQET02FLSUX,B0035MA5HS,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 3]","FILM RATING: 3.5 stars out of 5Are you a fan of The Beatles? If so, then you may want to check out Nowhere Boy (2009). While it's NOT the story of how The Beatles got started, it IS the coming-of-age story of how John Lennon got started in life and music, including how he met Paul McCartney and created his first rock band, The Quarrymen. Nowhere Boy is a very well made British indie film by first time feature film director Sam Taylor-Wood. It was released on Blu-ray and DVD recently and I've been anxiously awaiting it ever since I first saw the trailer. The film barely got a theatrical release here in the U.S., but I think it will find its audience at home instead. This is a character-driven dramatic story that works very well at portraying the early roots of John Lennon, who like so many artistic geniuses, came from a broken, dysfunctional family, where he was pushed and pulled by the influential members of his family. Would Lennon have ever gotten into music if it hadn't been for his birth mother? Or the conflict between his mother and his aunt (who was the woman that raised him)? Questions like these seem easy to answer in hindsight, but Nowhere Boy takes us through the journey of Lennon finding his voice in his teens.While I enjoy some of The Beatles music, I've never been overly enamored with the the band or the stories of its members, like many obsessive fans. But Nowhere Boy's trailer somehow got its hook into me and now I'm very glad that it did. Front and center in the film is actor Aaron Johnson, who depicts John Lennon brilliantly. While he doesn't necessarily look like John Lennon, he embodies the energy and moody emotion of the musician as perfectly as I can imagine an actor could. Not only does Johnson provide us with juicy dialogue in his native British accent, he even takes on singing and playing the guitar quite well. Without a genuine portrayal of the music in this movie by the actors, I have a feeling the film would fall flat on its face and feel more like a made-for-television documentary. It was the music that helped tie the pieces of the story together and keep me engaged and interested. Clearly Johnson is a talented young artist who should have an interesting career in the entertainment industry for years to come. I've gotten the soundtrack to the film since watching Nowhere Boy and the re-creations of Lennon's early music by ""The Nowhere Boys"" is quite good for a group of actors, all on its own separate from its film.Nowhere Boy is a beautifully shot film with excellent cinematography by Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey, also known for his work on Atonement (2007). Some of the images of the U.K. are simply incredible, showcasing the beauty hidden within the details of that country, as well as the details of this production (i.e. the actors, the costumes, and the sets). The production design by Alice Normington and her incredible team in the art department gives the film a perfect look and feel that helps tell this story set in the 1950s. Much like The King's Speech (2010), God is in all the details of this film, including the excellent dialogue and emotional body language written by screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh and portrayed by the incredible cast. Kristin Scott Thomas and the rest of the supporting actors were perfectly cast and help make the film as good as it is.In terms of graphic design, I really love the movie poster for this film. Sometimes just a well-designed movie poster can get me enticed to see a film, and this poster definitely got me to see the trailer the first time, which then got me to see the film. I just love that image of actor Aaron  Johnson as John Lennon with those thick black horn-rimmed glasses, a cigarette poking out of his mouth, and his guitar around his shoulder. Along with the colors and textures in the poster, it's one of my favorites from 2010.If you're looking for a good solid movie set in the past with interesting history into the character development of a man and a musician like John Lennon, Nowhere Boy is a new release definitely worth seeing. While I'm not sure how many repeat viewings this film will get in the future from me, my first viewing was enjoyable and well worth the time. The Blu-ray presentation is definitely the way to go here since the colors and details in the photography need the higher definition format to really sing.",4,Very Good British Indie Film about the early years of John Lennon,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,4383,"['FILM', 'RATING', '3.5', 'stars', '5Are', 'fan', 'Beatles', 'so', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', '2009', 'NOT', 'story', 'how', 'Beatles', 'got', 'started', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'how', 'John', 'Lennon', 'got', 'started', 'life', 'music', 'including', 'how', 'met', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'created', 'first', 'rock', 'band', 'Quarrymen', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'British', 'indie', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Sam', 'Taylor-Wood', 'was', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'barely', 'got', 'theatrical', 'release', 'here', 'U.S.', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'home', 'instead', 'character-driven', 'dramatic', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'portraying', 'early', 'roots', 'John', 'Lennon', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'artistic', 'geniuses', 'came', 'broken', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'where', 'was', 'pushed', 'pulled', 'influential', 'members', 'family', 'Would', 'Lennon', 'have', 'ever', 'gotten', 'music', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'birth', 'mother', 'conflict', 'mother', 'aunt', 'who', 'was', 'woman', 'raised', 'Questions', 'seem', 'easy', 'answer', 'hindsight', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'journey', 'Lennon', 'finding', 'voice', 'teens.While', 'enjoy', 'Beatles', 'music', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'overly', 'enamored', 'band', 'stories', 'members', 'many', 'obsessive', 'fans', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'trailer', 'somehow', 'got', 'hook', 'now', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'Front', 'center', 'film', 'actor', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'who', 'John', 'Lennon', 'brilliantly', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'look', 'John', 'Lennon', 'energy', 'moody', 'emotion', 'musician', 'as', 'perfectly', 'can', 'imagine', 'actor', 'could', 'Not', 'only', 'Johnson', 'provide', 'juicy', 'dialogue', 'native', 'British', 'accent', 'even', 'singing', 'playing', 'guitar', 'quite', 'well', 'genuine', 'portrayal', 'music', 'movie', 'actors', 'have', 'feeling', 'film', 'would', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'feel', 'more', 'made-for-television', 'documentary', 'was', 'music', 'helped', 'tie', 'pieces', 'story', 'together', 'keep', 'engaged', 'interested', 'Clearly', 'Johnson', 'talented', 'young', 'artist', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'interesting', 'career', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'years', 'come', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'watching', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 're-creations', 'Lennon', 'early', 'music', 'Nowhere', 'Boys', 'quite', 'good', 'group', 'actors', 'own', 'separate', 'film.Nowhere', 'Boy', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Seamus', 'McGarvey', 'also', 'known', 'work', 'Atonement', '2007', 'images', 'U.K.', 'are', 'simply', 'incredible', 'showcasing', 'beauty', 'hidden', 'details', 'country', 'as', 'well', 'details', 'production', 'i.e', 'actors', 'costumes', 'sets', 'production', 'design', 'Alice', 'Normington', 'incredible', 'team', 'art', 'department', 'film', 'perfect', 'look', 'feel', 'tell', 'story', 'set', '1950s', 'Much', 'King', 'Speech', '2010', 'God', 'details', 'film', 'including', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'emotional', 'body', 'language', 'written', 'screenwriter', 'Matt', 'Greenhalgh', 'portrayed', 'incredible', 'cast', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'rest', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'terms', 'graphic', 'design', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'poster', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'well-designed', 'movie', 'poster', 'can', 'get', 'enticed', 'see', 'film', 'poster', 'definitely', 'got', 'see', 'trailer', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'got', 'see', 'film', 'just', 'love', 'image', 'actor', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'John', 'Lennon', 'thick', 'black', 'horn-rimmed', 'glasses', 'cigarette', 'poking', 'mouth', 'guitar', 'shoulder', 'colors', 'textures', 'poster', 'one', 'favorites', '2010.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'set', 'past', 'interesting', 'history', 'character', 'development', 'man', 'musician', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'new', 'release', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'future', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'time', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'definitely', 'way', 'go', 'here', 'colors', 'details', 'photography', 'need', 'higher', 'definition', 'format', 'really', 'sing']",Nowhere Boy

Although, The Beatles were just a little before my time, I always got the impression that John Lennon was a funny,sweet, sincere, sarcastic,reflective, poetic,gentle, conscious pacifist and an extremely gifted musician trying to use his gifts to better himself and the world around him in a positive manner.In NOWHERE BOY, John Lennon has not evolved into the iconic artist that he will one day become. Here Lennon is rude, cocky but unsure, obnoxious, angst-filled,argumentative, and a young John Lennon had more emotional holes in him than a moth-eaten English wool sweater. ..And I get that! In this time-frame in Lennon's life, this all eventually leads him down the path to the inspired musical genius that he will one day become.Me, personally, though? I'd rather not have known anything about how sadly tumultuous Lennon's younger days were. Some things are better left to the imagination or not to be known at all. Frankly, I really do like and I am totally fascinated with the older version of John Lennon who is at peace with himself and who makes it very publicly known that he is not at peace with the chaotic, unfair,corrupt,and greedy world around him.Call me a sentimental sappy fool but that's how I kind of want to remember John Lennon,the man, not the NOWHERE BOY.

I recommend buying this one, it is really good story of a young man who looked at times that he was going nowhere and ended up going somewhere. The music soundtrack is top notch, even use a un-issued version of ""Mother"" in the film at the credits.

1326739,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0035MA5HS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[12, 13]","There have been plenty of biographies and stories written about John Lennon, the world renown English musician and singer-songwriter, most notably known as one of the founding members of The Beatles.But while books have covered the difficulties that John Lennon had faced during his teenage years, no one really had details of his life.  All we have heard was how he didn't have a mother, how he got into a lot of trouble and used that teenage angst to form the quarrymen, his first band which led him to one of the greatest musical collaborations and that was Lennon and Paul McCartney meeting, which followed with musician George Harrison joining them and of course, going on to Hamburg, Germany where along with Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best would go on to create the band, The Beatles (at the time, were a five-member band).But for those who wondered about John Lennon's life, especially being raised by his Aunt Mimi and his troubled relationship with his mother Julia, it was not until 1989 where Lennon's half sister Julia Baird would write the book ""John Lennon, My Brother"" written with Giuliano and featured a foreword by Paul McCartney.  In 2007, she followed up with a second book titled ""Imagine This - Growing Up with My Brother John Lennon"".In 2009, a film adaptation based on Julia Baird's biography was created.  The 2009 British-Canadian biopic focused on John Lennon's adolescence, how he learned to play the guitar, the creation of this first band The Quarrymen and how he would meet Paul McCartney.  But also details about his mother and his Aunt Mimi, who raised Lennon.The film would be the first feature film for director Sam Taylor-Wood and would star young actor (and Wood's current fiance) Aaron Johnson (""Kick-Ass"", ""The Illusionist"", ""Shanghai Knights"") and Kristin Scott Thomas (""The English Patient"", ""Gosford Park"", ""Mission: Impossible"".  ""Nowhere Boy"" would be nominated for four British Academy Award Films including a nomination for ""Outstanding British Film"", ""Best Supporting Actress"" and ""Outstanding Debut by a British Director"".The film would be released in the US in October 2010 to coincide with John Lennon's 70th Birthday.""Nowhere Boy"" is about John Lennon (played by Aaron Johnson), a young man who lives with his Aunt Mimi (played by Kristin Scott Thomas) and his Uncle George (played by David Threlfall).  John isn't too much into school and he and his friends often get into trouble or have fun with the girls at his school.But after the passing of his Uncle George (who was more lenient and happy going than his strict Aunt Mimi), John continues to get into more trouble and eventually getting suspended from school and trying to find ways for his aunt not to find out.One day as he went out with a friend, he learns that he found where his mother Julia has been living.  Assuming that she lived far away, John is shocked that she doesn't live far from where he lives.  So, he goes to visit her and despite the awkwardness of their meeting, the two bond remarkably fast and he sees her vibrant and free-will, almost similar to his style.Julia Lennon lives with John ""Bobby"" Dykins and their two young daughters Julia and Jacqui.  Despite Bobby not so happy to see John cause a change in their family dynamics, he knows that Julia is happy meeting her son again, who she keeps calling him ""her dream"".But when John gets suspended once again, he needs to pretend that he is going to school but instead he visits his mother.  Both have an appreciation for music and when she takes him to see a theater performance for Elvis Presley, John Lennon is changed.  But unfortunately, he doesn't know how to play any instruments.  So, Julia goes to teach him how to play the banjo.When the school contacts Mimi about John's suspension, she learns from his friend the secret that John has been keeping from her.  That he has been going to her sister's Julia's home.This leads to an argument with John and his Aunt Mimi and John goes to live with Julia.  Despite Julia and the girls being happy about them living together, her boyfriend Bobby feels she is neglecting the girls and that John needs to go.  John overhears this and moves out of his mother's home back to Aunt Mimi and both get back to good terms with each other.  But they make a deal.  If John does well in school, she will buy him a guitar.This begins John Lennon's pursuit of being a musician and immediately creates a band with his buddies called ""The Quarrymen"".  They perform at a local gig and eventually impress another 15-year-old musician who wants to meet John Lennon.  The boy turns out to be Paul McCartney who shows off his guitar-playing talent which impresses Lennon and eventually Paul becomes a member.As the film continues to focus on John's pursuit of becoming a musician and in a band, the film focuses on relationships and we learn why John Lennon was raised by his Aunt Mimi, why his mother abandoned him and how he and his new music friends would go on to Hamburg, Germany (where he and his other bandmates would go on to create ""The Beatles"").VIDEO:""Nowhere Boy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The film is absolutely vibrant in colors but also the film utilizes special lens filters to give a faded look in which colors are intentionally softer and not bolder but it looks fantastic.  I saw no signs of DNR, no artifacting.  Blacks were nice and deep nor did I see any banding.""Nowhere Boy"" features fantastic PQ.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Nowhere Boy"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film features a strong center and front channel drive lossless track with dialogue and music becoming clear.  There is some use of surround, mainly when it comes to crowd scenes and you can hear the ambiance through those surround channels.The music for the film is very good, crystal clear and heard no problems with the audio at all.  But this is a dialogue and music driven film, so expect to see more center and front channel driven audio.As for subtitles, ""Nowhere Boy"" is presented in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Nowhere Boy"" features the following special features in standard definition:* Deleted Scenes - (3:55) Featuring two deleted scenes: ""John and Julie"" and ""A Quick Chat"".* The Making of Nowhere Boy - (7:46) Featuring interviews with director Sam Taylor Wood and the cast and the making of the film.* Nowhere Boy: The Untold Story of John Lennon and the Creation of The Beatles - (13:10) Director Sam Taylor Wood, Martin Lewis (Beatles Historian), Yoko Onno and others talk about ""Nowhere Boy"".JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to John Lennon, you think you read or seen it all when it comes to the Beatles by the many writings, biographies, documentaries out there but I have to admit, although I read about how John Lennon got into a bit of trouble as a teen, you never knew how sad his life was.Yoko Onno said about ""Nowhere Boy"" that John would have been happy with the film because people would get to learn how sad his life was.  And most of all, how he endured from all that pain.  What I found pretty interesting, especially since this story was based on Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird's book was how free-spirited their mother Julia was.  How she would flirt with John and also flirt with his bandmates (especially with Paul McCartney) and as seen in the film, would upset John Lennon.We also got to see some of that Lennon and McCartney rivalry as both liked the attention from the women, John much more.  But of course, this biggest bombshell was finding out why John Lennon was raised by his Aunt Mimi and abandoned by his mother.  And needless to say, the tragedy that took place life not much longer.""Nowhere Boy"" is an exciting and enjoyable biopic for anyone who is fascinated by the Beatles, especially for those who want to learn more about John Lennon and even if you're not a fan.  This is one part of his life that has never been featured before in a film or documentary and so, it was a surprise but also quite refreshing to see something that took place in Lennon's adolescence versus his time with the Beatles, after the Beatles and leading up to his death.The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray and director Sam Taylor-Wood does a great job in bringing Julia Baird's book to life in this film.But where this Blu-ray release does disappoint me, its because of its lack of special features.The UK Icon Home entertainment Blu-ray release featured a wonderful audio commentary by director Sam Taylor-Wood but it's not in the US Blu-ray release.  We also don't get the ""Lennon's Liverpool"", ""Anatomy of a scene: That's When I Stole him"", ""Photo Gallery"", ""Interview"", ""The Re-Creation of Lennon and the Quarrymen"" and more deleted scenes which had a commentary by Sam Taylor-Wood.  We do get the newer ""Nowhere Boy: The Untold Story of John Lennon and the Creation of the Beatles Featurette"".  Typically, we tend to get exact to more features of what the UK has and this UK Blu-ray release was back in May 2010.So, I'm a little bummed out by the lack of special features that did not make it over for the US release.  Fortunately, because this Blu-ray release is BD-Live enabled, hopefully Sony chooses to have it available via BD-Live in the near future.Otherwise, ""Nowhere Boy"" gives us an idea of how troubled John Lennon was as a teenager and in many ways, it does give me an idea why as an adult, he had trust issues and also got himself into trouble and excessive drug use.  The biopic shows us that even before the Beatles, before the Quarrymen, Lennon living without his mother and father and being raised by his strict aunt was tough for him.  The film doesn't examine why he had a trouble life growing up but we get to see that pain he had lived with.I did question the validity of the story at first but after seeing how it was based off Julia Baird's book, and as a young girl, got to know John Lennon as a teenager around the house but also receiving some input from Yoko Onno (who loved the film) and Paul McCartney, you realized that unfortunates circumstances helped shape Lennon's life and eventually leading him and his friends and going to Hamburg, Germany and eventually creating the Beatles.""Nowhere Boy"" is an intriguing, exciting but also sad biopic but it does give us a look at John Lennon's personal life and what shaped him as a musician.Recommended!",3,"Blu-ray: An enjoyable film on John Lennon's youth, but for

The story is not so much about the Fabs, however, as it is about the complex and mercurial dynamic of the relationship between John, his Aunt Mimi (Kirstin Scott Thomas) and his mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff).

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","NOWHERE BOY (2009, U.S. release 2010) is a brilliant minimalist sketch of the life of John Lennon (a stunning and typically weird Aaron Johnson) when he was 17. Though I came to be a Lennon fan a little late (post-Beatles breakup), I appreciated this glimpse into a time I always perceived as mythical - and terrible.Growing up with his Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas) and Uncle George (David Threlfall), John led a happier life than one is usually led to believe. Just when he established firm contact with his mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff), Mimi's sister, she was hit by a car and killed in the street. I always knew about the horrifying loss of John's mother; it is part of the Lennon Lore. To see it certainly struck a few cords.The acting is top notch and Johnson is almost spooky in the way he actually seems a different lad in every film he's made. Here he makes no attempt to impersonate or mimic John in any way - yet he is a 17-year-old John Lennon. This only proves that Johnson has a volcanic career ahead of him. The only thing that nagged me nearly to death is that while the camera lovingly lingers on Johnson (you'll discover why in a moment), Lennon had dark honey-brown eyes. Johnson, who evidently cannot wear contacts, has trademark dazzling sky blue eyes. Oh well.I make special mention of George Harrison (Sam Bell) and Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie Sangster,Love Actually,The Last Legion) - both those boys are quite good but I was especially moved by Sangster. I've seen him a great deal and am a big fan.This film, aside from the musical interludes to show how much that meant to John, is a meditative, reasonable portrayal. Not being an expert on this subject, I will have to leave it at this: it was incredibly interesting and the filmmakers made me feel almost as if I was an intruder on someone's memories. As to that, there is a most revolting sex scene and I hope my readers know where I stand on that issue: I can bloody well do without it already!Cost this film one star. Call me prudish, tough toenails.One thing I will shout to the rafters about this: not only does Johnson do beautiful singing, Sangster and Bell do also. In fact Johnson and Sangster performed together on nearly all the songs, Bell on at least two. Wonderful. I was afraid they'd try to get someone else to do the singing ....Can't ask for more than that from a film like this.

I expected a mockumentary, a retread of facts about Beatlemania. Instead, ""Nowhere Boy"" is a heartfelt tale of a troubled British teenager. He lives with his aunt and uncle, but when the uncle dies, young John is sent into a tailspin.To no one's surprise, John finds refuge in music. Along the way, though, he seeks answers about his past and his parents. He rekindles a relationship with his mother, acted to great effect by Anne-Marie Duff. She is fun, lively, and a kindred spirit. But she is also irresponsible and temperamental, a fact John's aunt, played with equal skill by Kristin Scott Thomas, never lets him forget. Even as the music is awakened in him, he struggles with school, girls, and insecurity that masquerades as braggadocio and arrogance. Underneath it all he is floundering to understand his place.""Nowhere Boy"" doesn't revel in the posh or noble airs that predominate most British films, but shows British teens as rebellious, lecherous, and foul-mouthed--all the things I experienced while living in England. It is rated ""R"" for a few such scenes. Despite tragedy and conflict, John Lennon meets a friend along the way, young Paul, and they become the pillars of a band that would change history.This is a beautifully shot and acted film. Although the actors don't really look like the actual John or Paul, they bring their own vibe to it and pull it off with great skill. This is not a documentary on the Beatles. In fact, it could almost be a story about an average British teen who wants to understand his family and his future. In this case, though, we know what that future held, and it adds a poignant touch to the film's conclusion.",4,A Poignant Touch,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,1775,"['wife', 'huge', 'Beatle', 'fan', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'joined', 'real', 'plans', 'getting', 'hooked', 'expected', 'mockumentary', 'retread', 'facts', 'Beatlemania', 'Instead', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'heartfelt', 'tale', 'troubled', 'British', 'teenager', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'when', 'uncle', 'young', 'John', 'sent', 'tailspin.To', 'one', 'surprise', 'John', 'refuge', 'music', 'way', 'though', 'answers', 'past', 'parents', 'relationship', 'mother', 'acted', 'great', 'effect', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'fun', 'lively', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'also', 'irresponsible', 'temperamental', 'fact', 'John', 'aunt', 'played', 'equal', 'skill', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'never', 'forget', 'Even', 'music', 'awakened', 'school', 'girls', 'insecurity', 'braggadocio', 'arrogance', 'floundering', 'understand', 'place', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', ""n't"", 'revel', 'posh', 'noble', 'airs', 'predominate', 'most', 'British', 'films', 'British', 'teens', 'rebellious', 'lecherous', 'foul-mouthed', 'things', 'experienced', 'living', 'England', 'rated', 'R', 'few', 'such', 'scenes', 'tragedy', 'conflict', 'John', 'Lennon', 'friend', 'way', 'young', 'Paul', 'become', 'pillars', 'band', 'would', 'change', 'history.This', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'acted', 'film', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'actual', 'John', 'Paul', 'bring', 'own', 'vibe', 'pull', 'off', 'great', 'skill', 'not', 'documentary', 'Beatles', 'fact', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'story', 'average', 'British', 'teen', 'who', 'understand', 'family', 'future', 'case', 'though', 'know', 'what', 'future', 'held', 'poignant', 'touch', 'film', 'conclusion']",Nowhere Boy
1326745,A150QZUUQAN21X,B0035MA5HS,Fallout Girl,"[2, 2]","I have loved the Beatles since I was 13, and I'm usually very critical of Beatle movies. But I thought this one was amazing. Don't pay attention to bad reviews. First of all, this is NOT a movie about the Beatles, it's a movie about John Lennon, so all the complaints about not seeing more of the Beatles are rather silly.I thought the film succeeded brilliantly in showing the paradoxical essence of John Lennon - a gentleman and a jerk, an intellectual and a hooligan, sometimes mature other times childish. The direction was subtle and wistful. The cast was fantastic. Aaron Johnson amazed me. I could not believe I was watching the same person I saw in Kick-Ass. He may not look like John, but for 98 minutes of the film's duration, he IS John. From the first cheeky ""Is nowhere full of geniuses, sir?"", I saw and heard John Lennon. Toward the end, when Mimi asks him about his new band's name, for a second or two his expression is so quintessentially John that it sent shivers down my spine. And people are actually complaining about the lack of physical resemblance? Really? I find it ironic that these same people raved about ""Aviator"" but seemed to have no problem with DiCaprio looking nothing like Howard Hughes. It's one thing to resemble someone physically, but to get so completely into the character that looks become irrelevant... That takes major talent.I have a feeling many people who complain about John's portrayal in this movie don't seem to realize that the public image of John Lennon was just a veneer. Being all but abandoned by his parents and living with a stern, cold (albeit loving, in her own way) woman with basically no male role model - no young boy can go through that and come out all right. Under Lennon's witty, sarcastic clown front lived a troubled, confused, tortured soul. All you have to do to realize this is look at what happened after the Beatles had broken up - this soul came out full force and nearly destroyed him.I do have to admit that the movie isn't flawless: some parts are fiction, such as John being completely estranged from his mom. The real John did have a relationship with her all throughout his childhood. I also wish they'd mentioned Cynthia, who was a big part of John's life, but I have a feeling Yoko Ono had a little something to do with that...

But the young man who played John did himself proud.  As the film went on and the conflict over Mimi and his Mother emerged, he gave John a more rebellious feel.

1326747,A2S4Y40G5Y68L1,B0035MA5HS,Follett R,"[0, 0]","My expectations for this movie were extremely low.  The only reason for this is, as a lifelong Lennon fan, I have been extremely disappointed by every other portrayal of him in various other movies over the years.I am not one of those fans that over identifies with celebrities/artists that I really like, and feel as if I know them personally.  Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that other portrayals of John Lennon were not even remotely accurate.While I think Aaron Johnson comes closer to the mark in portraying the ""spirit"" of a young John Lennon, I don't really know how accurate his portrayal is either.  However, the reason this movie worked so well for me is that, ultimately, I pretty much forgot that this was a film about John Lennon and really just got into the story itself- It's just a darn good movie.The part that fascinated me was the dynamics of the very unique relationship between John and his mother.  This was really the heart of the movie, rather than the more biographical apects pertaining to the formation of the Quarry Men/early Beatles.That said, I also think the movie touched on very well the budding partnership between John and Paul and the subtle dynamics going on between these two virtual opposites.

It is as much a story of bruised families as it is an introduction to the forces behind Lennon's formation of what was to become The Beatles, probably the most influential musical group of the 1960s and 1970s who all but defined that period in our history.John Lennon (Aaron Johnson) lives with his stern guardian aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas) and beloved uncle George (David Threlfall) in Liverpool.  At film's beginning Uncle George die suddenly and at the funeral John sees his biologic mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff) who deserted John when he was 5 years old only to marry and have two daughters living not far form her sister Mimi.  John seeks out Mimi, discovers she is a freewheeling music buff who is not only glad to re-connect with her son but also finds him physically attractive.  Mimi's common-law husband Bobby (David Morrissey) finds John's intrusion into his family (the two have two daughters) disturbing.  But as John becomes more fascinated with being with his birth mother he learns banjo and guitar and gets the urge to imitate Elvis Presley - an infatuation that leads the 15-year-old John to form a band called Quarrymen, soon joined by Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and George Harrison (Sam Bell).  The group becomes locally successful but John's attention to Mimi proves problematic and Julia and Mimi spar for John's attention and love.  How John Lennon rises above his roots and retains love for both 'mothers' provides a touching ending to a movie and an apropos beginning to understanding  the success of the Beatles.Aaron Johnson captures the personality formation of john Lennon as well as any actor to date and his performance is excellent.  He is equally matched by the polished performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Anne-Marie Duff. NOWHERE BOY is an entertaining and nostalgic film well worth watching.

(Hamburg was where the Beatles forged their final group and refined their craft.)Aaron Johnson (""Kickass"") is far too pretty to play John Lennon, but he captures the Liverpudlian accent and it's fun to watch him segue from a pair of Buddy Holly glasses (Holly was an early idol) to an Elvis hairdo, as he searches for a sexy persona. McCartney and Harrison are played by baby-faced Thomas Sangster (""Love, Actually"") and Sam Bell, respectively. By the way, you'll appreciate the captions on your DVD from Amazon.com because the accents can be a bit challenging.The main thrust of this film is about Lennon's anger and confusion. He is raised by his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George, while his mother lives nearby with her new husband and two younger children. This has never been explained to him, and as we learn more, we realize this melodramatic tale HAS to be true, no self-respecting storyteller could get away with it.Of course Beatles fans will, with the arrogance of 20/20 hindsight, smile at little things: Paul and John walk past a Strawberry Fields sign; Paul says they should write their own music to avoid royalty fees; John admits he only writes ""a little poetry.""

1326753,AKYCVQN0EN2T8,B0035MA5HS,"Jeff Walker ""It-Was-Never-Over""","[1, 1]","I found myself trying to like this film but not quite managing it. Part of the problem for me is: John Lennon was one of the most charismatic human beings I have ever run across in the public sphere. Friends and acquaintances confirm that even as a teen, Lennon was the one who drew everyone's attention in any given room. He was the one you couldn't keep your eyes off. Try BEING such a person for the silver screen. That's a tall order for a young actor, Aaron Johnson in this case, to pull off. And I don't believe he does pull it off. Read a biography of John Lennon or the Beatles, and in one's imagination it all seems so magical. Stick a bunch of teens trying to impersonate them in front of a movie camera and suddenly it all seems so mundane. Inwardly I was cheering on the actors, wanting them to make Lennon's youth come alive, but it didn't happen. I just saw a bunch of young actors pretending they were the Quarry Men. Ho-hum. Perhaps it's that we baby boomers are so familiar with the real-like charisma of Lennon in his 20s and 30s that we expect to see it all in some incipient form even in a young actor playing him. It may be unrealistic on our part. Nonetheless...Dramatic license revoked: It's a post-funeral house-gathering. Paul makes some innocuous remark about John's late mother. John takes it the wrong way, and publically head-butts Paul. The two then dissolve in tears (and Paul's blood) in each others' arms, in recognition of each's maternal loss. This may go over well with viewers unaware that no such thing ever happened. I just bristled. As if the story of John Lennon and the Beatles is so lacking in drama that it has to be contrived.And what of the climactic scene of the QuarryMen recording `In Spite of the Danger'? One: It's  a rather lame folkie-sounding song to spotlight. Two: It was a one-off Paul and George composition, with no Lennon content. Very deflating for those with some knowledge of John's life.Something else that bothered me was the whole insistence on telling this `origins' story for the umpteenth time. I've always felt strongly, as did Lennon, that ""the music is the thing"" when it comes to the Beatles. In fact, the proto-Beatles didn't make much music worth more than a listen or two during their pre-Ringo era of 1957-1962. It was a necessary stage in their development, obviously, but music-wise it's strictly an archeological dig. Their real heyday begins in late 1962 and extends to at least early 1970. I say `at least' because by 1970 the Beatles had become each Beatle going solo and continuing to make great music--if only sporadically. This incredibly rich and fascinating stage--easily re-imagined as the Beatles' final glorious era--somehow has been demoted and even forced to play second banana to the peripherals of the 1960s such as the Yellow Submarine movie or the Anthology sets that even Paul joked were mostly toxic waste. Instead, why not take the very best of John, Paul, George and Ringo, arrange it in Beatles format--surely as nature intended--and let `the Beatles' carry on in the more conceptual form the group had often assumed when only one or two Beatles participated on a given track (`Yesterday', `Julia', `Love You To' and so forth).",3,"Charismatic musician, uncharismatic actor",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,3229,"['found', 'trying', 'like', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'managing', 'Part', 'problem', 'John', 'Lennon', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'charismatic', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'ever', 'run', 'public', 'sphere', 'Friends', 'acquaintances', 'confirm', 'that', 'even', 'teen', 'Lennon', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'drew', 'everyone', 'attention', 'given', 'room', 'was', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'off', 'Try', 'BEING', 'person', 'silver', 'screen', 'tall', 'order', 'young', 'actor', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'case', 'pull', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'pull', 'off', 'Read', 'biography', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Beatles', 'one', 'imagination', 'so', 'magical', 'Stick', 'bunch', 'teens', 'trying', 'impersonate', 'front', 'movie', 'camera', 'suddenly', 'so', 'mundane', 'Inwardly', 'was', 'cheering', 'actors', 'wanting', 'make', 'Lennon', 'youth', 'come', 'alive', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'just', 'saw', 'bunch', 'young', 'actors', 'pretending', 'were', 'Quarry', 'Men', 'Ho-hum', 'Perhaps', 'baby', 'boomers', 'are', 'so', 'familiar', 'real-like', 'charisma', 'Lennon', '20s', '30s', 'expect', 'see', 'incipient', 'form', 'even', 'young', 'actor', 'playing', 'may', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'part', 'Nonetheless', 'Dramatic', 'license', 'revoked', 'post-funeral', 'house-gathering', 'Paul', 'innocuous', 'remark', 'John', 'late', 'mother', 'John', 'wrong', 'way', 'publically', 'head-butts', 'Paul', 'two', 'then', 'dissolve', 'tears', 'Paul', 'blood', 'others', 'arms', 'recognition', 'maternal', 'loss', 'may', 'go', 'over', 'well', 'viewers', 'unaware', 'such', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'just', 'bristled', 'story', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Beatles', 'so', 'lacking', 'drama', 'be', 'contrived.And', 'what', 'climactic', 'scene', 'QuarryMen', 'recording', 'Spite', 'Danger', 'One', 'rather', 'lame', 'folkie-sounding', 'song', 'spotlight', 'Two', 'was', 'one-off', 'Paul', 'George', 'composition', 'Lennon', 'content', 'Very', 'deflating', 'knowledge', 'John', 'life.Something', 'else', 'bothered', 'was', 'whole', 'insistence', 'telling', 'origins', 'story', 'umpteenth', 'time', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'strongly', 'did', 'Lennon', 'music', 'thing', 'when', 'Beatles', 'fact', 'proto-Beatles', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'music', 'more', 'listen', 'two', 'pre-Ringo', 'era', '1957-1962', 'was', 'necessary', 'stage', 'development', 'obviously', 'music-wise', 'strictly', 'archeological', 'dig', 'real', 'heyday', 'late', '1962', 'least', 'early', '1970', 'say', 'least', '1970', 'Beatles', 'had', 'become', 'Beatle', 'going', 'solo', 'continuing', 'make', 'great', 'music', 'only', 'sporadically', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'fascinating', 'stage', 'easily', 're-imagined', 'Beatles', 'final', 'glorious', 'era', 'somehow', 'been', 'demoted', 'even', 'forced', 'play', 'second', 'banana', 'peripherals', '1960s', 'such', 'Yellow', 'Submarine', 'movie', 'Anthology', 'sets', 'even', 'Paul', 'joked', 'were', 'mostly', 'toxic', 'waste', 'Instead', 'why', 'not', 'take', 'very', 'best', 'John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo', 'arrange', 'Beatles', 'format', 'surely', 'nature', 'intended', 'let', 'Beatles', 'carry', 'more', 'conceptual', 'form', 'group', 'had', 'often', 'assumed', 'when', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'Beatles', 'participated', 'given', 'track', 'Yesterday', 'Julia', 'Love', 'so', 'forth']",Nowhere Boy

This also goes for other performers here as well. I don't think anyone could have portrayed the complicated childhood and tragic adolescence of John Lennon's life as well as it is portrayed here.To me, pain is the great teacher. If you combine one's painful experience with the rich talent that was John Lennon, you get art of the highest order. All of the components, though, were important in making what became The Beatles: the necessary personality, skill and talent of the young Paul McCartney, the proficient guitar playing of 14 year old George Harrison, all of these elements were so integral in what became the biggest music phenomena of the last fifty years, perhaps, of the 20th century, itself.

We all have our bad hair days.But read about John Lennon; look at actual film footage of the man at any point in his life. See him smiling, see his wit, see his charm.There's a scene in this film where Lennon and his band (The primordial Beatles) are making their first recording; the homemade ""In Spite Of All The Danger"". If you just listen to the song, it's so obvious that everyone is having a ball of a time. In this scene, however, Lennon in shown scowling, intense, having the most trying time of his life. The whole movie is full of these ""at odds"" portrayals.Past biopics did the same thing with Elvis. You look at old TV kinescopes of Presley. He's mugging, hopping all around, he's enjoying himself as much as anybody in the audience. But when some actor is playing him in a movie, Presley is seen as this oh-so-tortured soul.

1326758,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B0035MA5HS,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[3, 3]","What a difference time makes! ""Nowhere Boy"" (2010) shows that waiting is a good thing, that distance can produce a rich account of moments in the lives of famous people. This account covers approximately one year in the young life of John Lennon. It's a film to treasure, especially if you are or were a Beatles fan.Frankly, I was one of those rabid Beatles fans back in the day as they amazingly popped on the scene, as if instantly made. But they weren't. It took time to make them right. This poignant and quick-paced film shows just how John Lennon became John Lennon and provides early glances into the making of the Beatles to come, or at least, the making of the first three: John, Paul, and George.John had a mixed life with his guardians--his aunt and uncle, with whom--the uncle-- there was mutual adoration. His aunt, Mimi (played perfectly by Kristen Scott Thomas), was a proper Brit with a stiff upper lip and quite cold towards the two males. After his uncle died, John looked up his other aunt, Julia, the family black sheep, and found her warm and irresistible. Although fun-loving, Julia was emotionally unreliable. By happenstance, John learned that Julia was his mom and that Mimi had taken him in to prevent his father from taking him to New Zealand to live. It's a complication that terribly upset young John.Julia'a major contribution to John's musical growth was teaching him to play the banjo. Then he moved to the guitar and declared he would start a band. He was very much an Elvis follower. This is not the story of a teen talking big and not doing, but of one who said and acted at once. A very appropriate statement made by Julia (whether true or fabricated in actuality) is this: ""You shouldn't want to be Elvis. You should want to be John Lennon!"" I chuckled at that!One shocker for me, a Paul McCartney fan, is the depiction of Paul by a twerpy-looking actor (Thomas Brodie Sangster). I don't mean to insult young Thomas, but, really, Paul is so handsome. But then some people actually develop looks out of awkward, young teen years. The interesting aspect in the onscreen story is that Paul is the gifted musician with emotional and artistic depth. These gifts by the actor made him wear the role with aplomb and naturalness. On the other hand, John is the passionate leader.There's much more to the story, making this definitely a must-see film, even if you are not particularly a Beatles' fan. This is a biographical account that unflinchingly shows the truth, both attractive and unattractive. Aaron Johnson (Lennon) is a young actor who will surely explode onto the screen again and again. He carries the film with grace and gall.I loved ""Nowhere Boy!"" ""Nowhere""? A word directed by the head master toward young John because he wasn't exactly the most obedient student in his school.It was such a surprise and joy to find this film on one of my movie channels. I had no idea it existed. I declare it from the hills, from the bleachers.

1326759,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B0035MA5HS,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[4, 4]","I've been looking forward to this movie. I've been following reviews and articles about it and the mention of not strictly sticking to the chronological facts, but after seeing ""Nowhere Boy"" I would say it captures the emotional/psychological truth that John Lennon experienced.Aaron Johnson plays John Lennon, a teenager who is torn between the love of two women, his mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff) and his Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas). His Aunt has been raising him since age 5 because his mother for unspecified reasons, although it is hinted that it's manic depression, can't take care of him. ""Nowhere Boy"" follows John Lennon's life from roughly age 14 to 19, a fairly tumultuous period  in Lennon's life. Lennon's mother teaches him to play the banjo and indulges him, while his Aunt Mimi must be the responsible parent and tries to instill some discipline in the boy. It is this tug-of-love situation that sends the young Lennon ricocheting between his mother's house and his aunt's house, and slowly pulling the boy apart while his own needs drive him to rebellion and Rock `n' Roll.While these domestic tidal forces are forming the nascent John Lennon, Lennon is forming the nascent Beatles, The Quarrymen. Lennon forms the band by allowing his school mates to be in the band. Soon Lennon meets Paul McCartney (Thomas Sangster) and forms one of the strongest male bonds of his life, and maybe pop music.Aaron Johnson plays Lennon cool, aloof, even when Lennon's life is unraveling before him and he's learning truths about his life he probably wouldn't have wanted to know. He can't turn back because he instigated the revelations.Kristin Scott Thomas plays Aunt Mimi as a strong willed woman who at once can also be vulnerable at the death of her husband, or the love in her eyes while Lennon is tearing her apart by rejecting her in favor of his mother, but she stays strong. Anne-Marie Duff's Julia is flighty and raw vulnerability, and her love for John is unquestioned. Sangster while not at first seeming to resemble Paul McCartney developing the qualities of McCartney his love of music and growing commitment to John. The acting has good solid performances, and several scenes are highly emotional because you believe in these people as human beings.Although these two movies weren't conceived as such and were made 16 years apart, ""Nowhere Boy"" is sort of a prequel to ""Backbeat (Collector's Edition)"" and they make nice companion pieces and fit nicely together in the Lennon/Beatles story.Special Features include a couple of deleted scenes, a making of that includes interviews with the cast and director Sam Taylor Wood, and the documentary Nowhere Boy: The Untold Story of John Lennon and the Creation of The Beatles.",5,Torn Between Two Mothers,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,2744,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'reviews', 'articles', 'mention', 'not', 'strictly', 'sticking', 'chronological', 'facts', 'seeing', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'would', 'say', 'emotional/psychological', 'truth', 'John', 'Lennon', 'experienced.Aaron', 'Johnson', 'John', 'Lennon', 'teenager', 'who', 'torn', 'love', 'two', 'women', 'mother', 'Julia', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Aunt', 'been', 'raising', 'age', '5', 'mother', 'unspecified', 'reasons', 'hinted', 'manic', 'depression', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'John', 'Lennon', 'life', 'roughly', 'age', '14', '19', 'fairly', 'tumultuous', 'period', 'Lennon', 'life', 'Lennon', 'mother', 'play', 'banjo', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'must', 'be', 'responsible', 'parent', 'tries', 'instill', 'discipline', 'boy', 'tug-of-love', 'situation', 'young', 'Lennon', 'ricocheting', 'mother', 'house', 'aunt', 'house', 'slowly', 'pulling', 'boy', 'apart', 'own', 'needs', 'drive', 'rebellion', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll.While', 'domestic', 'tidal', 'forces', 'are', 'forming', 'nascent', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Lennon', 'forming', 'nascent', 'Beatles', 'Quarrymen', 'Lennon', 'band', 'allowing', 'school', 'mates', 'be', 'band', 'Soon', 'Lennon', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Thomas', 'Sangster', 'one', 'strongest', 'male', 'bonds', 'life', 'maybe', 'pop', 'music.Aaron', 'Johnson', 'Lennon', 'cool', 'aloof', 'even', 'when', 'Lennon', 'life', 'unraveling', 'learning', 'truths', 'life', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wanted', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'back', 'instigated', 'revelations.Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'strong', 'willed', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'death', 'husband', 'love', 'eyes', 'Lennon', 'tearing', 'apart', 'rejecting', 'favor', 'mother', 'strong', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'Julia', 'flighty', 'raw', 'vulnerability', 'love', 'John', 'unquestioned', 'Sangster', 'not', 'first', 'seeming', 'resemble', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'developing', 'qualities', 'McCartney', 'love', 'music', 'growing', 'commitment', 'John', 'acting', 'good', 'solid', 'performances', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'highly', 'emotional', 'believe', 'people', 'human', 'two', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'conceived', 'such', 'were', 'made', '16', 'years', 'apart', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'sort', 'prequel', 'Backbeat', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'make', 'nice', 'companion', 'pieces', 'fit', 'nicely', 'together', 'Lennon/Beatles', 'story.Special', 'Features', 'include', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'Sam', 'Taylor', 'Wood', 'documentary', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'Untold', 'Story', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Creation', 'Beatles']",Nowhere Boy

He hates school and his strict aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and his mother who abandoned him when he was five.  Then he meets his mother again and although she's a little odd, he loves having a mum again, while his auntie isn't so sure.This little film tells the interesting and sad story of Lennon's childhood and his search for maternal love.  Unfortunately, Johnson not only lacks charisma, he doesn't look or sound anything like John and that was a big disappointment.  I had to keep reminding myself who he was supposed to be; this could have been about any unhappy young man and I was expecting more.  The actors who play Paul and George look nothing like them, either; if they didn't call each other by name, you'd never know who was who.  Scott Thomas is absolutely wonderful  playing a tough and seemingly cold woman who really loves John but is unable to show it; her scenes are the most dramatic and enjoyable.The period is recreated well with costumes, hair styles, music, and set decoration.  Lennon's fans will enjoy learning why he became interested in music in the first place, how he got his first guitar, and how he formed his first band.

Lennon and McCartney introduced me to music and nothing's given me more joy, so I kind of feel like John and Paul are my older brothers, and watching Nowhere Boy I felt that even more. Fab Four fan or not, anybody who enjoys fine acting and writing is likely to enjoy this film, especially Kristen Scott Thomas' typically superb performance and the solid lead turn by Aaron Johnson.The script is also excellent, near perfect in fact, showing more and saying less than it might, and all to the good. It slows a bit about an hour in but picks up very nicely (if sadly) towards the end. I would have liked a bit more Paul/music stuff there and less melodrama, but the relationships are what this one is all about, so fair enough. If you love John's songs as deeply as so many millions (billions?) do, you'll see and feel where so much of his spirit and outlook comes from. When I played for a living I used to slip a version of In My Life into some gigs at quieter moments, and Nowhere Boy reminded me why so many people in the crowd would get kind of misty-eyed during that tune. Lennon had heart and so very much of it, and he wasn't afraid to trot it out and share it with us all. This movie does justice to that thought, to the man, and to the boyhood that gave rise to the most popular musical group this planet has ever seen.Anne Marie Duff is wonderful as Julia, giving her the many sides John's erstwhile mother clearly had. She and Kristen and Aaron have some very powerful scenes together, and their connection makes this film sing. The blu-ray is good, the transfer crisp and the extras ok, though I would have liked even more in-depth stuff, but then what Lennon aficionado wouldn't? And it's sad that there's no classic Beatles music here, but the early rock stuff still rocks.Highly recommended not only for Beatles fans but for anyone who enjoys a well-paced film that goes from funny to sad back and forth, over and over, and leaves you feeling like you know (and love) these people even more than you thought you did.",5,This Beatles fan loved it,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,2143,"['4.5', 'starsEver', 'Mum', 'gave', 'Red', 'Blue', 'albums', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'ears', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'happy', 'Lennon', 'McCartney', 'introduced', 'music', 'nothing', 'given', 'more', 'joy', 'so', 'kind', 'feel', 'John', 'Paul', 'are', 'older', 'brothers', 'watching', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'Fab', 'Four', 'fan', 'not', 'anybody', 'who', 'fine', 'acting', 'writing', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'especially', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'typically', 'superb', 'performance', 'solid', 'lead', 'turn', 'Aaron', 'Johnson.The', 'script', 'also', 'excellent', 'near', 'perfect', 'fact', 'showing', 'more', 'saying', 'less', 'might', 'good', 'bit', 'hour', 'up', 'very', 'nicely', 'sadly', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'Paul/music', 'stuff', 'less', 'melodrama', 'relationships', 'are', 'what', 'one', 'about', 'fair', 'enough', 'love', 'John', 'songs', 'as', 'deeply', 'so', 'many', 'millions', 'billions', 'do', ""'ll"", 'see', 'feel', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'spirit', 'outlook', 'When', 'played', 'living', 'used', 'slip', 'version', 'My', 'Life', 'gigs', 'quieter', 'moments', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'reminded', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'crowd', 'would', 'get', 'kind', 'misty-eyed', 'tune', 'Lennon', 'had', 'heart', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'trot', 'out', 'share', 'movie', 'justice', 'thought', 'man', 'boyhood', 'gave', 'rise', 'most', 'popular', 'musical', 'group', 'planet', 'ever', 'seen.Anne', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'wonderful', 'Julia', 'giving', 'many', 'sides', 'John', 'erstwhile', 'mother', 'clearly', 'had', 'Kristen', 'Aaron', 'have', 'very', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'together', 'connection', 'film', 'sing', 'blu-ray', 'good', 'transfer', 'crisp', 'extras', 'ok', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'even', 'more', 'in-depth', 'stuff', 'then', 'what', 'Lennon', 'aficionado', 'would', ""n't"", 'sad', 'classic', 'Beatles', 'music', 'here', 'early', 'rock', 'stuff', 'still', 'rocks.Highly', 'recommended', 'not', 'only', 'Beatles', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'well-paced', 'film', 'funny', 'sad', 'back', 'forth', 'feeling', 'know', 'love', 'people', 'even', 'more', 'thought', 'did']",Nowhere Boy

The fact that it's well acted, well directed, and has a great soundtrack of classic rock and roll songs makes it worth watching even if you aren't a Lennon or Beatles fan.However if you love John Lennon as many of us do, I think you will find this to be among the best of the Beatles-genre movies. I rate it right up there with ""Backbeat"".You should know, however, that this movie is not really about the Beatles. It does show the meeting of Paul, and George and the beginning of the Quarrymen, but these events are really incidental to the main story. The main story is John's relationship with his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George and of course his mother, Julia.The movie focuses on the years when he re-met his mother and then just past the time when she was killed in a car accident, which coincided with the time he formed the Quarrymen and eventually went to Hamburg with the Silver Beatles. The movie makes this period of time seem like just a year or two when actually he re-met his mother around the age of 11 and she was killed when he was 17.

I watched the film and was extremely surprised. Being a bit of an amateur Beatles historian myself, I already knew the stories about how Fred (Alf) Lennon and Julia had split up and John had gone to live with his Aunt Mimi. One MUST do a little more digging to find Lennon's own accounts of how when he and Julia would take naps together he often wondered how she would react if he put his hand on her breast or how Fred and Julia left it up to John whom he would go to live with (which broke his heart and left him extremely bitter) or how Paul was constantly having to reel John in to keep him from being ""a dick"".I read a review earlier somewhere that said this movie was terrible because it left one believing that John was sour and brooding when if you just watch the old news clips you would see that he was smiling and happy. Showmanship can cover a multitude of feelings is all I can say about that.Watch this movie, and then if you are so inclined watch Backbeat (another really good Beatles film that admittedly falls short on the facts, but is close enough for it to give you the basics).

On the plus-side, the performances by Aaron Johnson as John Lennon and Kristin Scott Thomas as Aunt Mimi and Anne-Marie Duff as Julia were amazing. I felt the basic personalities were captured quite well, although I do not believe Aunt Mimi was as borderline abusive as this film makes her out to be. I also enjoyed the scene where John and Paul are singing in the enclosed front porch, which they actually did because the acoutics were so good. What bothered me most in the film were the little details: the home used as Mendips didn't look anything like the actual Mendips, John going in and out of the front door which he was not permitted to do (he always used the back door)and the portrayal of Paul McCartney by Thomas Brodie Sangster which was totally unbelievable. I was also annoyed by the continual insinuation that John was ""stolen"". The more-likely truth is that his mother (Julia), who had some emotional issues, behaved in ways not in the best interests of a child. Aunt Mimi stepped in and sacrificed a great deal to provide for John. I have read that he called her every week until he died and I do not believe he would have done that had she been abusive.  The essence of the film dealt with John's feelings of abandonment and how he became the wounded soul he was. In his younger years he was ill-prepared to deal with the complex details of his parent's problems and why he was better off living with his Uncle George and Aunt Mimi. My hope is that, before he died, John was able to reconcile the threads of his childhood.

1326770,AKX28FGA6L47J,B0035MA5HS,Mark,"[0, 0]","I recall reading somewhere that this would have been a good film even if the subject matter had not dwelt on the early years of John Lennon. I feel the same way - this movie stands up well even if the subject matter had been about any kid living down the block.I've seen / read  countless interviews / books with many of John's boyhood friends i.e. the fellows who comprised his first band, The Quarrymen to think that the director / actor got it right re his incredibly forceful / dominant personality. I really believe that had John Lennon not acheived success in music, he would have been incredibly successful in whatever other endeavour he focussed on.There's a scene in the film where John and Julia, his mother, are lunching in a cafe after having seen a newsreel clip of Elvis and John is struck by the screaming girls in the theater and their reaction to seeing Elvis on the big screen. Over a cup of tea later, John says to his mother ""God - why couldn't you have made me Elvis"".? And his mother responds ""because he was saving you for John Lennon"". Although John waves a fist in the air and says defiantly ""I'll get you for that God..!!!"", little did he know that in just a few short years, he / The Beatles would go on to surpass the frenzy that Elvis could conjure up.Factually, I think the director / production people have to be commended for the meticulous attention to details / facts. The clothese / mannerisms / locations all give you a feel of what the mid to late 1950's Liverpool must have been like..!The fellow, who played John's best mate, Pete Shotton, could be a twin for the real life Pete. Kristen Scott Thomas's performance as his Aunt Mimi couldn't have been better. The woman, who portrayed his mother, Julia, not only looked like her, but her personality was captured exactly as she was described by boyhood friends of John, who also knew Julia. I was particularily struck by the wonderful relationship, which John had with his Uncle George (Mimi's husband), who, unfortunately, passed away far too early. I know from many, many accounts that I've read that George had a beautiful relationship with John and that John loved him very, very much and was profoundly affected by his untimely death. It's true that John's father abandoned him at a very early age (5), however, George clearly was like a 'father"" to John. One can't help but speculate  how much of John's ""angst"" would have been diffused had George enjoyed a longer realtionship with John.I was alittle disappointed that there was no reference / story involving Stu Sutcliffe, one of John's best friends, who played with the (Silver) Beatles when they were learning their craft in Hamburg. But it's a small complaint and in no way detracted rom the movie.The influence of Paul on John, I thought, was portrayed very well by both the young actor / movie. Even at an early age, Paul was a ""diplomat"" and his ""calming"" influenece on John, on balance, was probably a very good tonic. One can only speculate as to the trouble that John could have gotten into had paul not been around to smooth things over with either John or the people he ""insulted"".I thought the movie perfectly captured the mixture of anger / humour that was such an integral part of John Lennon's personality.  Yes -  John could be an angry individual with an explosive temper at times, but he was an incredibly witty / funny / humorous person as well. I recall seeing an interview once with his half-sister (also named Julia), who was a litle girl in the movie and Julia couldn't recall a single instance when John didn't have a smile on his face.I thorougly enjoyed this movie about a boyhood hero of mine, whose music has been a constant companion of mine for almost half a century now. It's no easy task to depict somebody as complex a personality as John Lennon, but Nowhere Boy, in my opinion, succeeded..!Highly recommended (and not just to John Lennon / Beatles fans).",5,A Very Good Film,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,3935,"['recall', 'reading', 'somewhere', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'subject', 'matter', 'had', 'not', 'dwelt', 'early', 'years', 'John', 'Lennon', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'even', 'subject', 'matter', 'had', 'been', 'kid', 'living', 'down', 'block.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', '/', 'read', 'countless', 'interviews', '/', 'books', 'many', 'John', 'boyhood', 'friends', 'i.e', 'fellows', 'who', 'comprised', 'first', 'band', 'Quarrymen', 'think', 'director', '/', 'actor', 'got', 'right', 'incredibly', 'forceful', '/', 'dominant', 'personality', 'really', 'believe', 'had', 'John', 'Lennon', 'not', 'acheived', 'success', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'incredibly', 'successful', 'other', 'endeavour', 'focussed', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'John', 'Julia', 'mother', 'are', 'lunching', 'cafe', 'having', 'seen', 'newsreel', 'clip', 'Elvis', 'John', 'struck', 'screaming', 'girls', 'theater', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'Elvis', 'big', 'screen', 'cup', 'tea', 'later', 'John', 'mother', 'God', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'Elvis', 'mother', 'was', 'saving', 'John', 'Lennon', 'John', 'fist', 'air', 'defiantly', ""'ll"", 'get', 'God..', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'years', '/', 'Beatles', 'would', 'go', 'surpass', 'frenzy', 'Elvis', 'could', 'conjure', 'up.Factually', 'think', 'director', '/', 'production', 'people', 'have', 'be', 'commended', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'details', '/', 'facts', 'clothese', '/', 'mannerisms', '/', 'locations', 'give', 'feel', 'what', 'mid', 'late', '1950', 'Liverpool', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'like..', 'fellow', 'who', 'played', 'John', 'best', 'mate', 'Pete', 'Shotton', 'could', 'be', 'twin', 'real', 'life', 'Pete', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'performance', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'woman', 'who', 'portrayed', 'mother', 'Julia', 'not', 'only', 'looked', 'personality', 'was', 'captured', 'exactly', 'was', 'described', 'boyhood', 'friends', 'John', 'who', 'also', 'knew', 'Julia', 'was', 'particularily', 'struck', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'John', 'had', 'Uncle', 'George', 'Mimi', 'husband', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'passed', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'know', 'many', 'many', 'accounts', ""'ve"", 'read', 'George', 'had', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'John', 'John', 'loved', 'very', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'untimely', 'death', 'true', 'John', 'father', 'abandoned', 'very', 'early', 'age', '5', 'however', 'George', 'clearly', 'was', 'John', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'speculate', 'how', 'much', 'John', 'angst', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'diffused', 'had', 'George', 'enjoyed', 'longer', 'realtionship', 'John.I', 'was', 'alittle', 'disappointed', 'was', 'reference', '/', 'story', 'involving', 'Stu', 'Sutcliffe', 'one', 'John', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'played', 'Silver', 'when', 'were', 'learning', 'craft', 'Hamburg', 'small', 'complaint', 'way', 'detracted', 'movie.The', 'influence', 'Paul', 'John', 'thought', 'was', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'young', 'actor', '/', 'movie', 'Even', 'early', 'age', 'Paul', 'was', 'diplomat', 'calming', 'influenece', 'John', 'balance', 'was', 'probably', 'very', 'good', 'tonic', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'speculate', 'trouble', 'John', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'had', 'paul', 'not', 'been', 'smooth', 'things', 'John', 'people', 'insulted', 'thought', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'mixture', 'anger', '/', 'humour', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'John', 'Lennon', 'personality', 'Yes', 'John', 'could', 'be', 'angry', 'individual', 'explosive', 'temper', 'times', 'was', 'incredibly', 'witty', '/', 'funny', '/', 'humorous', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'recall', 'seeing', 'interview', 'once', 'half-sister', 'also', 'named', 'Julia', 'who', 'was', 'litle', 'girl', 'movie', 'Julia', 'could', ""n't"", 'recall', 'single', 'instance', 'when', 'John', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'smile', 'face.I', 'thorougly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'boyhood', 'hero', 'mine', 'music', 'been', 'constant', 'companion', 'mine', 'almost', 'century', 'now', 'easy', 'task', 'depict', 'somebody', 'complex', 'personality', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'opinion', 'succeeded..', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'not', 'just', 'John', 'Lennon', '/', 'Beatles', 'fans']",Nowhere Boy
1326771,ARIO0LYVA1J8,B0035MA5HS,Mark L.,"[3, 4]","Movies can't tell complex stories accurately in just two hours or so, but it is certainly true that John Lennon's complicated relationship with his mother--not knowing her for most of his life and then losing her just when they had re-connected--did haunt him and color the rest of his life.  It was visible during the late Beatles period (""Julia""), exploded during his post-Beatles period in his angst and public psychotherapy, and to some extent was sublimated in his relationship with Yoko, whom he called ""Mother.""  He never got over it, and it probably made him a little crazy.Kristin Scott Thomas proves again what a great actor she is, submerging her beauty and sensuality in mid-'50's British dowdiness.  She's seen as strict and rigid, but from time to time, when she thinks no one is looking, you can see in her eyes Aunt Mimi's true emotions and her love for John.Interestingly, the name ""Beatles"" is never uttered in the entire film--not when the group is on their way to Hamburg at the end (when Mimi asks John what the name of the band is now, and he replies, ""Does it matter?""), nor even in the closing onscreen titles that give a quick sketch of what happened later.  Normally I would expect that to be the result of a legal issue, but the movie uses so many other real names, and so many other movies have used the name in a historical context, that it's just baffling.A huge defect in this movie was not showing John getting the news of his mother's death and reacting to it.  The real Lennon described the impact of that moment, and it was a pivotal event in his life.  Instead, the movie cuts directly from the accident to her wake.

1326772,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0035MA5HS,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There have been tons of biopics made about various stars and musicians. Some are popular but bring nothing to the table. But then there are others that not only offer a new perspective on the subject at hand but have the ability to inspire viewers to dig deeper into the person they've just watched a film about. Such is the case with NOWHERE BOY, a biopic about the young John Lennon.Rather than focus the entire film on the beginnings of the Beatles, it instead takes Lennon as its subject and brings them in later. Aaron Johnson stars as Lennon, living with his Uncle George (David Threlfall) and Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas). When his uncle suddenly passes away, he sees a woman at the cemetery watching from a distance. Its only later that he discovers this woman is his mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff).In trouble at school and feeling he is suffering under the strict upbringing offered him by Mimi, John sets out to find his mother. A friend discovers where she is living and much to John's surprise it's within walking distance.Arriving at her doorstep, he reunites with his mother and they become friends. But that's the thing; they seem more like friends than mother/son. Julia is a free spirit, a woman who loves rock n' roll music and wants to have fun, much like the adolescent John. And as their friendship grows it takes on an almost oedipal tone.John continues to have school problems and eventually decides he wants to form a band. Recruiting various friends he forms a skiffle band that plays at local events. Then one of these friends brings along someone he knows, a fellow by the name of Paul McCartney and, as they say, history is made.The rivalry between these two starts the moment that they meet. Paul is skilled at playing the guitar while John is merely using banjo chords his mother taught him to play. Paul, though younger, becomes a mentor musically to John. And while their rivalry is apparent, so is their growing affection for one another.Through the story John remains conflicted by the adults in his life. Where one has raised him as her own she keeps a tight hold on him. The other offers him a frivolous life of fun but little responsibility. And as these two women, both who adore the young boy, face off with one another neither quite knows the affect that it has on him. But one day the words pour out of him in his music.The best part of this movie is not the soundtrack though it is well done. The best part of the movie is actually discovering the tip of the ice berg that was John Lennon. In finding out the things that made him who he was, we are offered a glimpse behind the scenes at why he was the way he was, what inspired him, how he achieved fame and fortune. Most will remember the celebrity that was John Lennon, few knew the man. This film gives us a glimpse and perhaps will inspire those who watch to find out more about him.Aaron Johnson does an amazing job as Lennon, never dumbing down his portrayal by trying to sound and look exactly like him, instead portraying the youngster filled with troubles instead. He performs the role as an actor portraying a character rather than as an actor mimicking a personality and the performance does well because of that.Kristin Scott Thomas and Marie-Anne Duff both turn in interesting performances as well. They form the yin and yang that made up the man that became John Lennon; the much reserved and proper Brit and the fun loving free spirit that brought out more artistically. Each conveys their roles well but it's the underlying emotions that they display with little more than a nod or subtle form of body language that makes their characters seem more real.I wasn't sure if I'd like this movie. Having lived through the later Beatles years (SGT. PEPPER was the first actual album I ever purchased) I knew the bits and pieces that made up the band. Lennon always came off as sort of a know it all, a cocky individual who always thought he was above everyone else. This movie made me rethink that opinion and want to seek out more information about him.

This review is about another film, the early years of John Lennon.""Nowhere boy"" is a quaint film about the early years of John Lennon, in post war Liverpool where he lived until the age of eighteen with his aunt Mimi, a strict and austere woman, the epitome of British propriety, who loved John but whose uptight personality prevented her from expressing this with tenderness or words of love.  The role of aunt Mimi is portrayed exceedingly well by Kristin Scott Thomas. Aaron Johnson is an impetuous, impulsive young Lennon whom we are introduced to as he is speeding past the streets of Liverpool, teasing the girls and taunting the boys.  He is excellent as the conflicted young man, living in an environment which he finds stifling, not giving him room and scope to express his potential.John lives with his aunt as his father left when he was five and he is unaware of the whereabouts of his mother.  His aunt is disapproving of his rebellious and audacious character, being particularly exacerbated by his poor performance at school and the disrespect he shows towards his teachers.  She has also kept secret from him that her sister,  John's mother, lives only a mile away from his house. A friend takes him to his mother's where John is reacquainted with the woman he has not seen  since the age of five.  Julia, played by Ann Marie Duff, is a complete contrast to his reserved aunt Mimi.  She is emotional and totally unreserved, expressive in her love and devotion, flighty and erratic in her character.  She introduces John to Rock and Roll music, explaining that it expresses uninhibited sexuality.  In fact, her own attitude towards her teenage son is more that of a lover, with many sexual connotations and Freudian interpretations.With his mother's encouragement, who takes John to cafes and dances rock to the jukebox sounds, John asks his aunt to buy him a guitar as he wants to start his own rock band.  Mimi reluctantly gives in to his demands, though she remains unaware of John's relationship with his mother.  Julia will instruct John how to play and sing, how to dance and what the latest hits are. Julia's husband does not approve of John's frequent visits which seem to affect his wife's taciturn moods.  She is prone to depression, so John's volatile personality may wear thin her already fragile state.Aaron Johnson is wonderful in playing the impudent, mischievous, explosive character of a tempermental young Lennon but I believe that the two women are brilliant so they tend to slightly overshadow his performance.  The two sisters are a complete contrast, Thomas is superb as the stiff, unbending but deeply caring aunt, whereas  Duff is an eccentric, vulnerable type who goes through phases of isolation and outbursts of exuberance.  John feels torn in his love and loyalty between the two women who compete for his affection.  He feels lost, confused and betrayed, as he has been deprived of his father and for years of the affection of his mother. He suffers as he must decide where his loyalties lie, his aunt suggesting she deserves more for her devotion and years of dedication.  His behaviour becomes more and more delinquent, his consolation being the group he has started.  At seventeen he meets Paul McCartney and soon they become close friends, writing and performing their  own music.Sam Taylor Wood gives a great portrayal of the somewhat oppressive atmosphere in post war England, with the omnipresent scarcity of money and availability of products, of the need to painstakingly save penny for penny to buy even the cheapest of guitars. What is not particularly memorable to me is the music, which I expected to play a more predominant role, though I was left with the impression that it was pleasant enough.  The film ends when John goes to Germany to give some performances there, making the rest history.  I was left with a bittersweet feeling at the end of the film, knowing that what followed was legendary fame and a tragically early death.",4,How it all began,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,4166,"['have', 'asked', 'Amazon', 'delete', 'review', 'page', 'film', 'Which', 'Way', 'Home', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'so', 'far', 'please', 'ignore', 'are', 'page', 'review', 'film', 'early', 'years', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Nowhere', 'boy', 'quaint', 'film', 'early', 'years', 'John', 'Lennon', 'post', 'war', 'Liverpool', 'where', 'lived', 'age', 'eighteen', 'aunt', 'Mimi', 'strict', 'austere', 'woman', 'epitome', 'British', 'propriety', 'who', 'loved', 'John', 'uptight', 'personality', 'prevented', 'expressing', 'tenderness', 'words', 'love', 'role', 'aunt', 'Mimi', 'portrayed', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'impetuous', 'impulsive', 'young', 'Lennon', 'whom', 'are', 'introduced', 'speeding', 'streets', 'Liverpool', 'teasing', 'girls', 'taunting', 'boys', 'excellent', 'conflicted', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'environment', 'stifling', 'not', 'giving', 'room', 'scope', 'express', 'potential.John', 'aunt', 'father', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'unaware', 'whereabouts', 'mother', 'aunt', 'disapproving', 'rebellious', 'audacious', 'character', 'being', 'particularly', 'exacerbated', 'poor', 'performance', 'school', 'disrespect', 'teachers', 'also', 'kept', 'secret', 'sister', 'John', 'mother', 'only', 'mile', 'away', 'house', 'friend', 'mother', 'where', 'John', 'reacquainted', 'woman', 'not', 'seen', 'age', 'five', 'Julia', 'played', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'complete', 'contrast', 'reserved', 'aunt', 'Mimi', 'emotional', 'totally', 'unreserved', 'expressive', 'love', 'devotion', 'flighty', 'erratic', 'character', 'John', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'music', 'explaining', 'uninhibited', 'sexuality', 'fact', 'own', 'attitude', 'teenage', 'son', 'more', 'lover', 'many', 'sexual', 'connotations', 'Freudian', 'interpretations.With', 'mother', 'encouragement', 'who', 'John', 'cafes', 'dances', 'rock', 'jukebox', 'John', 'aunt', 'buy', 'guitar', 'start', 'own', 'rock', 'band', 'Mimi', 'reluctantly', 'demands', 'unaware', 'John', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Julia', 'will', 'instruct', 'John', 'how', 'play', 'sing', 'how', 'dance', 'what', 'latest', 'hits', 'are', 'Julia', 'husband', 'not', 'approve', 'John', 'frequent', 'visits', 'seem', 'affect', 'wife', 'taciturn', 'moods', 'prone', 'depression', 'John', 'volatile', 'personality', 'may', 'wear', 'thin', 'already', 'fragile', 'state.Aaron', 'Johnson', 'wonderful', 'playing', 'impudent', 'mischievous', 'explosive', 'character', 'tempermental', 'young', 'Lennon', 'believe', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'brilliant', 'tend', 'slightly', 'overshadow', 'performance', 'two', 'sisters', 'are', 'complete', 'contrast', 'Thomas', 'superb', 'stiff', 'unbending', 'deeply', 'caring', 'aunt', 'whereas', 'Duff', 'eccentric', 'vulnerable', 'type', 'who', 'phases', 'isolation', 'outbursts', 'exuberance', 'John', 'feels', 'torn', 'love', 'loyalty', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'compete', 'affection', 'lost', 'confused', 'betrayed', 'been', 'deprived', 'father', 'years', 'affection', 'mother', 'must', 'decide', 'where', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'aunt', 'suggesting', 'more', 'devotion', 'years', 'dedication', 'behaviour', 'more', 'more', 'delinquent', 'consolation', 'being', 'group', 'started', 'seventeen', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'soon', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'writing', 'performing', 'own', 'music.Sam', 'Taylor', 'Wood', 'great', 'portrayal', 'somewhat', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'post', 'war', 'England', 'omnipresent', 'scarcity', 'money', 'availability', 'products', 'need', 'painstakingly', 'save', 'penny', 'penny', 'buy', 'even', 'cheapest', 'guitars', 'What', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'music', 'expected', 'play', 'more', 'predominant', 'role', 'was', 'left', 'impression', 'was', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'film', 'when', 'John', 'Germany', 'give', 'performances', 'there', 'making', 'rest', 'history', 'was', 'left', 'bittersweet', 'feeling', 'end', 'film', 'knowing', 'what', 'followed', 'was', 'legendary', 'fame', 'tragically', 'early', 'death']",Nowhere Boy

His mother Julia who abandon him, more or less at age 6, and her sister Mimi who effectively raised John along with his beloved Uncle George.  Julia had gone on to remarry and is raising 2 young daughters nearby.  She is wild, fun and a bit loony.  John appreciates this, especially after she helps him with his music.Mimi is strict, formal and a bit of a stickler of British propriety.

I had a chance to get an early DVD of it about 6 months ago and came away from it feeling very sad. Yet again, another Lennon biopic that's so far off the mark. The inaccuracies are rampant. I didn't think the acting was that good. I thought the scouse was lousy. The biggest problem I had though was beyond the aesthetics (although the actor having blue eyes instead of brown bugged the crap outta me). The portrayal of Julia was such a caricature! Yes, Julia was very flirtatious and free-thinking...there's no denying that, but for god sake, they make her out to be a psychotic whore bound and determined to bed her own son. Just because John mentioned an incident in his audio diary (which is very true), they've taken that moment and made it the focus of their relationship. I think it's horrible. I also would hate to think of how the portrayal of Mimi would have been before the re-write. As it is, they have her as ""Mimi the Hun"". The woman DID have a heart and NEVER threw things at John's head. She would have died first. I just worry that the ""average"" Beatles/Lennon fan will come away from this movie with the wrong idea about Julia and Mimi, and that will, over time, colour his life, which is now becoming more mythology than fact.

1326779,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B0035MA5HS,Peter Baklava,"[3, 5]","When I watched this movie, I felt that director Sam Taylor-Wood was looking at John Lennon's life through the lens of nostalgia.  Instead of the gray, hardscrabble England that was purveyed in British cinema in the 1950's in memorable, tough movies like ""The Sweet Life"", ""Look Back in Anger"", and ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", we get a surprisingly bright and green Liverpool and a somewhat sweetened piece of biography.Aaron Johnson, the actor playing Lennon, actually looks more like Pete Best (the original Beatles drummer), with his baby blue eyes and ducktail haircut.  When Johnson dons wire-rimmed glasses, he resembles Harry Potter.  And wait 'til you meet Paul and George.  You won't believe how fresh-faced and scrubbed behind the ears the actors portraying them look, as if they were twelve years old.It's not only Lennon's chums who are dressed up.  In this film version, Aunt Mimi (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and Lennon's mother Julia (Anne- Marie Duff) are nothing short of hot-looking ""dishes"".  Duff seizes her opportunity and plays the vivacious Julia to the hilt, but when you see actual photos of the real Julia, you note that she wasn't so glamorous.  Neither was Mimi, and though Scott-Thomas plays her primly, you still know that there is a svelte body beneath the prim facade.Lennon's personal characteristics are paraded in an obvious fashion, too.  John was a ""dreamer"", so we get shots of him dallying on his back in a field.  He was creative, so we see him goofing off in school, working on his rhymes and cartoons.This is still a nice film for Beatles fans.

1326780,A1D3XQC2DIT,B0035MA5HS,Peter Shermeta,"[0, 0]","This is the origin story of John Lennon's genius. As a teenager he was constantly in trouble; he had no interest in fitting in and playing by the rules. He wasn't like most other children anyway, growing up raised by his aunt and uncle as non-traditional parents. He lacked direction (despite the rigid upbringing from Aunt Mimi) and had no passion until he met his muse, his mother Julia. She was the non-conformist who teaches John that life isn't only about fitting in and doing what you're supposed to do. And she teaches him music; to play, appreciate and live music. I believe you know the rest.I would never have thought of John Lennon as a renegade teen who cut his classes and idolized Elvis Presley. I had pictured him as the quiet, artsy poet. As it turns out, he was both. And that mix proved John to be revolutionary.Aaron Johnson, most known to me as the titular character in the recent cult phenomenonKick-Ass, was fantastic as John Lennon. I thought he did a great job singing and playing guitar on film. I am surprised that he went after such a cheesy role as a graphic-novel, kid super hero after taking on a challenging role as one of the most iconic musicians the world has seen. Let's put Kick-Ass behind you, Aaron. You are made for bigger and better movies. Nowhere Boy proved that.It is always hard to watch a movie that is a true story, or even based on a true story, when you want the situations you witness on screen to be amazingly true and not just amazingly scripted for the movie. To think of how certain chance meetings and passing conversations shaped a person is crazy. I am not normally a fan of ""biopics"" and I think that is because I do not get very star struck.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[3, 3]","After the disbanding of one of the most legendary rock `n' roll bands The Beatles, each individual member parted their separate ways and established successful solo musical paths.  But with that departure, their legacy would only grow to an enormous effect that they had never imagined with various interpretations that simply translated into a lasting legacy in the form of tributes and the retelling of the band and its individual member's personal histories through autobiographies and biographies through literature, film, and most of all the music which speaks for itself.  And once in a while a movie comes along that attempts to retell the story of The Beatles, Nowhere Boy, is one of those films.With meticulous detail and creative interest of depicting John Lennon's life before The Beatles, Director Sam Taylor-Wood exceptionally makes the attempt with meticulous detail and creativity of taking viewers back to 1955 in Liverpool where John (Aaron Johnson) at the age of 15 experiences the spurts of sullen maturation of a confused schoolboy due to the fractured relationship between he and his Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas) and long lost mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff).  With the confusion that comes along with adolescence, John finds a way to distant and rest his qualms through his teddy boy appearance, poetry, and the discovery of a new form of music called rock `n' roll.  And there is no denying that the sights and sounds of the decade are beautifully woven within this film that closely recreates the time period with the clothes and the first guitar that John Lennon purchased with Mimi and later had the instrument re-bought by Julia after Mimi became a little irritated and sold it back to the shop; one can see the somewhat tug of war that John had to endure between the two women that would eventually be reconciled but later result with tragedy.  But beyond the dysfunctional elements, the music and the formation of The Quarrymen and the first meeting of a very boyish looking Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie Sangster) and George Harrison (Sam Bell), it would be match made in heaven or where the history of The Beatles begins.Nowhere Boy is a fascinating film biography of John Lennon's personal rite of passage to maturity to music that may interest most die-hard Beatles fans or any one who may want to delve deeper before 1964.  Indeed, Taylor-Wood captures the mood and the music that was John Lennon through the images and influences that breathes throughout the film.",5,"""Well let me hear some of that rock 'n' roll music...""",1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,2502,"['disbanding', 'one', 'most', 'legendary', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'Beatles', 'individual', 'member', 'parted', 'separate', 'ways', 'established', 'successful', 'solo', 'musical', 'paths', 'departure', 'legacy', 'would', 'only', 'grow', 'enormous', 'effect', 'had', 'never', 'imagined', 'various', 'interpretations', 'simply', 'translated', 'lasting', 'legacy', 'form', 'tributes', 'retelling', 'band', 'individual', 'member', 'personal', 'histories', 'autobiographies', 'biographies', 'literature', 'film', 'most', 'music', 'once', 'while', 'movie', 'retell', 'story', 'Beatles', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'one', 'films.With', 'meticulous', 'detail', 'creative', 'interest', 'depicting', 'John', 'Lennon', 'life', 'Beatles', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Taylor-Wood', 'exceptionally', 'attempt', 'meticulous', 'detail', 'creativity', 'taking', 'viewers', 'back', '1955', 'Liverpool', 'where', 'John', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'age', '15', 'experiences', 'spurts', 'sullen', 'maturation', 'confused', 'schoolboy', 'due', 'fractured', 'relationship', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'long', 'lost', 'mother', 'Julia', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'confusion', 'along', 'adolescence', 'John', 'way', 'distant', 'rest', 'qualms', 'teddy', 'boy', 'appearance', 'poetry', 'discovery', 'new', 'form', 'music', 'called', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'denying', 'sights', 'sounds', 'decade', 'are', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'film', 'closely', 'time', 'period', 'clothes', 'first', 'guitar', 'John', 'Lennon', 'purchased', 'Mimi', 'later', 'had', 'instrument', 're-bought', 'Julia', 'Mimi', 'became', 'little', 'irritated', 'sold', 'back', 'shop', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'somewhat', 'tug', 'war', 'John', 'had', 'endure', 'two', 'women', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'reconciled', 'later', 'result', 'tragedy', 'dysfunctional', 'elements', 'music', 'formation', 'Quarrymen', 'first', 'meeting', 'very', 'boyish', 'looking', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Thomas', 'Brodie', 'Sangster', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Sam', 'Bell', 'would', 'be', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'where', 'history', 'Beatles', 'begins.Nowhere', 'Boy', 'fascinating', 'film', 'biography', 'John', 'Lennon', 'personal', 'rite', 'passage', 'maturity', 'music', 'may', 'interest', 'most', 'die-hard', 'Beatles', 'fans', 'one', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'delve', 'deeper', '1964', 'Indeed', 'Taylor-Wood', 'mood', 'music', 'was', 'John', 'Lennon', 'images', 'influences', 'film']",Nowhere Boy

As per almost all Beatle bio-pics, melodrama and hysterics substitute for nuanced characterization and the audience is treated to one-dimensional situations and emotions.  Young Lennon (who had brown eyes, not blue, by the way; one of many questionable casting calls) has two moods in Nowhere Boy -- angry and very angry, broken only by interludes of psychotic larkiness or savage bullying. His rather staid middle-class upbringing  (compared to, say, Ringo's) is depicted as one continuing trauma after another.  Aunt Mimi, who also has basically two moods (stern and very stern) is Lennon's foil and chief tormentor.  Mother Julia (her two moods: giddy and very giddy) plays muse, temptress, and tease to an unsettling degree.  Paul McCartney (who unaccountably comes across as a munchkin of apparently 10 years of age)  is another sometimes crony, sometimes whipping boy.  You wonder why anyone ever put up with this Lennon lout, he is depicted here as so uncharming, unfunny, and brutal, with little of his latent talent manifest onscreen.There is no Ringo, no Pete Best, no Stuart Sutcliffe, no Cynthia Powell Lennon, and barely any George, for those who are Fab-spotting.Altogether drab and dull and unconvincing.

1326788,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0035MA5HS,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","NOWHERE BOY is a pleasant, often rambling, look at the teen years of John Lennon.  It's the short time frame between Lennon being a prankish, low-level vandal and troubled schoolboy who readily captures the interest of the young ladies and his explosion onto the rock scene as a founder of The Beatles.When the movie begins, Lennon (Aaron Johnson) is living with his aunt Mimi (Kristen Scott Thomas) and Uncle George.  His uncle has given him a love of music, radio and generally acting silly.  His aunt tries earnestly to instill him with discipline and to put to good use young John's restless energy and undeniable charisma.  She clearly loves John (and vice-versa), but theirs is a relationship fraught with tension, because John yearns for his real mother, Julia.  After his uncle dies, John's desire to ""get out of the house"" grows by leaps when he discovers his mother lives very near him.  He begins to hang out with Julia (Anne-Marie Duff).  Julia has a new husband and some young kids of her own, yet she too is compelled to hang out with her son.  Julia, who ranges between being a ""free spirit"" to ""slightly crazy"", seems to have an almost sexual attraction her son.  Nothing happens, but there are plenty of vaguely uncomfortable scenes, where she acts more like a teenybopper girlfriend than his mother.  John is eager to spend the time with her, but is also uncomfortable with the kind of attention he gets.  And he's not comfortable with the kind of attention the strict Aunt Mimi gives him either.Music becomes a refuge, and he puts together a band (playing the guitar his aunt was foresightful enough to get him, despite knowing nothing about guitars or modern music).  John enjoys this hobby, which becomes more serious, until eventually he meets up with much younger Paul McCartney.Things come to a head between the two sisters and the movie takes many emotional turns, jolting the impressionable Lennon from one feeling to another.  He's not exactly a ""tortured soul"", but we sure do feel compassion for this bright but angry kid when life deals him so many hard blows.The movie ends just as Lennon and his new group head off to Hamburg.  As viewers, we know superstardom lies just around the corner, but the film mostly has a bittersweet tone to it.  It could just as easily have been a fictional story about a young kid from Liverpool who comes to rough peace with the hard knocks of his life, and starts a solid career playing early rock `n' roll.  We know it's about John Lennon, but because no music from The Beatles is featured (and none of the last names of the other Beatles are even used), it feels slightly removed from feeling like a biography.  This is both good and bad.  It's bad, because the movie feels a little coy about avoiding The Beatles (I assume this was for licensing reasons), to the point where you can't help but notice.  But it's good, because this is a story about a youth becoming a young man...not ""the kid who would be John Lennon.""It's modest all around, but has nice art direction and costuming, capturing the times quite well.  The best things in the movie are the 3 lead performances.  Duff is sparkling and giddy and a little dangerous as Julia.  We feel bad for her, and we resent the bad things she does.  Thomas, who is always excellent, gives a restrained performance as the uptight aunt who has a deep love for her nephew that comes through in anguished little bursts and glints of pride in the eyes.  It's low-key work, but very effective.  And Aaron Johnson, whom I really came to like as the star of KICK-A*S, shows that he's very likely to be a force to be reckoned with in years to come.  Handsome, sensitive, smart and funny.  His Lennon feels like it could be the John Lennon we ""knew"" during the heyday of the Beatles...but the performance has depth and feeling that go far beyond ""imitation.""It's a solid film that won't exactly shake you to the core or make you think of The Beatles in a new way.  But it offers many pleasures that anyone who loves film should appreciate, frankly even if you're NOT a Beatles fan (if such exists).",4,"Solid, well-acted and assuming look at a youthful John Lennon",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,4104,"['NOWHERE', 'BOY', 'pleasant', 'often', 'rambling', 'look', 'teen', 'years', 'John', 'Lennon', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'Lennon', 'being', 'prankish', 'low-level', 'vandal', 'troubled', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'readily', 'interest', 'young', 'ladies', 'explosion', 'rock', 'scene', 'founder', 'Beatles.When', 'movie', 'Lennon', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'living', 'aunt', 'Mimi', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Uncle', 'George', 'uncle', 'given', 'love', 'music', 'radio', 'generally', 'acting', 'silly', 'aunt', 'tries', 'earnestly', 'instill', 'discipline', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'young', 'John', 'restless', 'energy', 'undeniable', 'charisma', 'clearly', 'John', 'vice-versa', 'relationship', 'fraught', 'tension', 'John', 'yearns', 'real', 'mother', 'Julia', 'uncle', 'dies', 'John', 'desire', 'get', 'house', 'grows', 'leaps', 'when', 'mother', 'very', 'hang', 'out', 'Julia', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'Julia', 'new', 'husband', 'young', 'kids', 'own', 'yet', 'too', 'compelled', 'hang', 'out', 'son', 'Julia', 'who', 'being', 'free', 'spirit', 'slightly', 'crazy', 'have', 'almost', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'son', 'Nothing', 'are', 'plenty', 'vaguely', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'where', 'more', 'teenybopper', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'John', 'eager', 'spend', 'time', 'also', 'uncomfortable', 'kind', 'attention', 'not', 'comfortable', 'kind', 'attention', 'strict', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'either.Music', 'refuge', 'together', 'band', 'playing', 'guitar', 'aunt', 'was', 'foresightful', 'enough', 'get', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'guitars', 'modern', 'music', 'John', 'hobby', 'more', 'serious', 'eventually', 'up', 'much', 'younger', 'Paul', 'McCartney.Things', 'come', 'head', 'two', 'sisters', 'movie', 'many', 'emotional', 'turns', 'jolting', 'impressionable', 'Lennon', 'one', 'feeling', 'not', 'exactly', 'tortured', 'soul', 'sure', 'do', 'feel', 'compassion', 'bright', 'angry', 'kid', 'when', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'hard', 'blows.The', 'movie', 'just', 'Lennon', 'new', 'group', 'head', 'Hamburg', 'viewers', 'know', 'superstardom', 'just', 'corner', 'film', 'mostly', 'bittersweet', 'tone', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'fictional', 'story', 'young', 'kid', 'Liverpool', 'who', 'rough', 'peace', 'hard', 'knocks', 'life', 'solid', 'career', 'playing', 'early', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'know', 'John', 'Lennon', 'music', 'Beatles', 'featured', 'none', 'last', 'names', 'other', 'Beatles', 'are', 'even', 'used', 'slightly', 'removed', 'feeling', 'biography', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'movie', 'little', 'coy', 'avoiding', 'Beatles', 'assume', 'was', 'licensing', 'reasons', 'point', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'good', 'story', 'youth', 'becoming', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'kid', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'John', 'Lennon', 'modest', 'around', 'nice', 'art', 'direction', 'costuming', 'capturing', 'times', 'quite', 'well', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'are', '3', 'lead', 'performances', 'Duff', 'sparkling', 'giddy', 'little', 'dangerous', 'Julia', 'feel', 'bad', 'resent', 'bad', 'things', 'Thomas', 'who', 'always', 'excellent', 'restrained', 'performance', 'uptight', 'aunt', 'who', 'deep', 'love', 'nephew', 'anguished', 'little', 'bursts', 'glints', 'pride', 'eyes', 'low-key', 'work', 'very', 'effective', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'whom', 'really', 'came', 'star', 'KICK-A*S', 'very', 'likely', 'be', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'years', 'come', 'Handsome', 'sensitive', 'smart', 'funny', 'Lennon', 'feels', 'could', 'be', 'John', 'Lennon', 'knew', 'heyday', 'Beatles', 'performance', 'depth', 'feeling', 'go', 'far', 'imitation', 'solid', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'shake', 'core', 'make', 'think', 'Beatles', 'new', 'way', 'many', 'pleasures', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'should', 'appreciate', 'frankly', 'even', ""'re"", 'Beatles', 'fan', 'such', 'exists']",Nowhere Boy

Thornhill,"[11, 18]","This film could be summarized as follows: clean-cut, bland Liverpool teenager with no discernible wit or musical interest and not a caustic  bone in his body encounters adversity in those who parent him and suddenly is turned into John Lennon. We are to believe that lacking any interest in music of his own, he is turned on to it by his ""aunt"" Julia (who is of course in reality his mother); and because of the death of his uncle and later of Julia, he changes personalities and becomes a wholly different character. Those of us who know and love Lennon feel sure that he was always Lennon, from a young age, was always original, funny, impish, smart, cruelly perceptive of others, verbally gifted, sensitive, and artistic. Of COURSE his teenage experiences intensified him and to some extent forged his artistic identity, but the guy we see at the start of this film could never turn into John Lennon. To make matters worse, the actor who plays Lennon does not in any way physically resemble him, nor does he even talk like him. Couldn't they at least get the accent right? Then there's McCartney. This casting is even worse. A smallish, sallow-looking kid with no eyelids and none of Paul's presence, charisma, or striking facial beauty is made to stand in for him.

1326797,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0035MA5HS,Turfseer,"[6, 10]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***According to John Lennon's cousin, Leila Harvey, during the time she knew him (when he was between the ages of 9 and 16), he was a ""happy-go-lucky, good-humored, easy going, lively lad."" But looking at 'Nowhere Boy', the film that is supposed to accurately chronicle the coming of age years of John Lennon, you would be more likely to get the impression that he was a troubled and angst-ridden adolescent who was hardly the ""happy-go-lucky"" kid who eventually became the co-leader of the greatest rock band of the 20th century. And that is the problem with 'Nowhere Boy'--it simply fails to answer why John Lennon was charismatic, even in his unformed early days.He was charismatic because he WAS quick, witty, iconoclastic and wickedly humorous, all IN SPITE of his difficult childhood. He was the type of person, I believe, who never dwelt on the past and probably would have dismissed 'Nowhere Boy' as tendentious nonsense. A few months before his death, Lennon spoke about his upbringing and he praised his mother and all of his aunts. There is not a hint of anger or bitterness which ""Nowhere Boy"" implies consumed him while growing up: ""There were five women who were my family. Five strong, intelligent women. Five sisters. Those women were fantastic ... that was my first feminist education ... One happened to be my mother ... she just couldn't deal with life. She had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn't cope with me, and when I was four-and-a-half, I ended up living with her elder sister ... the fact that I wasn't with my parents made me see that parents are not gods.""Yoko Ono saw 'Nowhere Boy' twice and loved it. This is the same person who promoted ""Imagine"", the failed musical about John Lennon which put him up on a pedestal. 'Nowhere Boy' is a different kind of hagiography than the saintly John Lennon served up in the ""Imagine' musical. Both portraits can be likened to two different views of Christ-like figures: the saintly Lennon is like the wandering miracle maker dressed in a white robe, healing those afflicted with a malaise of the spirit; the ""Nowhere Boy' Lennon is one who undergoes a sort of spiritual crucifixion, enduring the slings and arrows of a torturous childhood and adolescence, emerging cleansed of all his trials and tribulations through a catharsis.It's understandable that Yoko would hold on to both these idealized images of her slain husband. However, Paul McCartney, who actually remembers everything about growing up in Liverpool at that time, will have none of it. It's said that McCartney strongly objected to the scene where John punches him after his mother's funeral and asked Director Sam Taylor-Wood (who he supposedly was friends with) to take the scene out. Taylor-Wood refused and told him in substance, ""it's just a movie"". McCartney knows that Lennon would never have punched him because that would imply that Lennon allowed the bitterness of his upbringing to affect him. The film's scenarists would like us to believe that the climactic scene where he assaults McCartney, is where he exorcises his demons and achieves his catharsis (recall that he hugs McCartney afterward and apologizes). It's all cheap melodrama which never happened and the type of made up incident which Lennon would have also rejected had he been around to see the movie.While 'Nowhere Boy' does a decent job of fleshing out the relationship between John's mother Julia and the aunt who raised him, Mimi, the more interesting story is the relationship John had with Paul as well as George and the peers he grew up with. All the key moments are covered in 'Nowhere Boy' including: the famous scene where John rides on the top of the bus, the first meeting with McCartney, the Quarrymen's first gig, a sexual encounter with a schoolmate, trouble at school, buying his first guitar--but it all seems like a glimpse at picture postcards. None of the relationships are developed, especially the most important one between Lennon and McCartney. And the real drama, of course, is not the dragged out familial problems, but how the Beatles actually came to be. To make that film, one would have had to have the rights to the Beatles catalog, a problem which the creators of 'Backbeat', the 1994 film about the Beatles Hamburg days, were also unable to overcome.Perhaps the strongest aspect of 'Nowhere Boy' are the performances of Kristin Scott Thomas as Mimi and Anne-Marie Duff as Julia. Thomas is thoroughly convincing as the 'tough love' substitute parent playing opposite the troubled Bohemian of sorts, Julia. You can see how both women influenced Lennon's personality--he inherited Mimi's discipline and Julia's creativity and rebelliousness. Aaron Johnson manages to capture little of Lennon's great wit and humor, but is saddled by the ponderous script. The make-up department should be commended for making Johnson look like Lennon, especially once he adopts Elvis's pompadour. Thomas Brodie-Sangster takes a shot at Paul but doesn't look enough like the 'handsome' Beatle to be convincing. The actor who plays George looks nothing at all like him and the part is woefully underdeveloped.We're informed by a prominent Beatles historian that 'Nowhere Boy' is the first film that covers John Lennon's early years including his upbringing and creation of the Beatles. While it does cover most of the bases, and does a decent job of defining the characters of Lennon's mother and aunt, Lennon himself comes off as a bit pathetic. Putting it another way--he's a character that all the joy has been sucked out of -and his angst-ridden replacement seems far from the flesh and blood rock icon, revered by millions.",2,"Angst-ridden

1326798,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0035MA5HS,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[45, 46]","Sam Taylor-Wood's Nowhere Boy is a marvelously moving depiction of the early life of John Lennon, covering the period from when he is about fifteen and first becoming interested in music to when he is nineteen, when he and his band, The Quarrymen, are about to leave for a gig in Hamburg that would see them emerge as the band known all over the world as the Beatles.Everything about this film works. Not only because of a great cast of actors, but in the way that it captures the look and feel not only of Liverpool in the late 50's and early 60's, but also of the transitioning music scene of the period, dominated in the beginning by American jazz and rock & roll but soon to be overturned by what would be called (on our side of the pond anyway) as the British Invasion.  One of the many remarkable achievements that Taylor-Wood manages to pull off in the film is the subtle way in which she shows Lennon starting with influences like Buddy Holly and Elvis but then slowly moving to create his own sound, particularly after he connects with an even younger Paul McCartney.The performances of the entire cast are worthy of praise, but two I feel deserve special attention: Aaron Johnson as John Lennon, and Kristin Scott Thomas as his Aunt Mimi. Johnson was best known for his perfomance as the title character in the cult super-hero film Kick-Ass, but his immersion in Lennon's character in Nowhere Boy was so thorough that he was almost unrecognizable. Scott Thomas, a veteran actress of many films of note, including The English Patient, Four Weddings And A Funeral, and The Other Boleyn Girl, was more recognizable, but all the more remarkable for bringing off the very complex character of Lennon's Aunt Mimi, the woman who raised him from the age of five. To bring out Mimi, Scott Thomas has to portray a woman who is tough as nails, making the hard decisions in life while keeping her inner feelings to herself, but who does in fact have feelings that every now and then must come out for the people she does in fact care deeply about. It is a highly challenging role and Scott Thomas pulls it off magnificently. Both performances are Oscar-worthy and I sincerely hope that the Academy will give them the recognition they so richly deserve.I highly recommend this film for anyone with an interest in John Lennon, the Beatles, the music of this highly important period, or simply in the lives of musicians and how they become the people the world comes to know. Or for anyone who just loves an extraordinarily well-crafted movie with stellar performances and a truly moving story.",5,A marvelously moving depiction of young John Lennon with Oscar-worthy performances,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,2589,"['Sam', 'Taylor-Wood', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'marvelously', 'moving', 'depiction', 'early', 'life', 'John', 'Lennon', 'covering', 'period', 'when', 'fifteen', 'first', 'becoming', 'interested', 'music', 'when', 'nineteen', 'when', 'band', 'Quarrymen', 'are', 'leave', 'gig', 'Hamburg', 'would', 'see', 'emerge', 'band', 'known', 'world', 'Beatles.Everything', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'way', 'look', 'feel', 'not', 'only', 'Liverpool', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'also', 'transitioning', 'music', 'scene', 'period', 'dominated', 'beginning', 'American', 'jazz', 'rock', 'roll', 'soon', 'be', 'overturned', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'side', 'pond', 'anyway', 'British', 'Invasion', 'One', 'many', 'remarkable', 'achievements', 'Taylor-Wood', 'pull', 'off', 'film', 'subtle', 'way', 'Lennon', 'starting', 'influences', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Elvis', 'then', 'slowly', 'moving', 'create', 'own', 'sound', 'particularly', 'even', 'younger', 'Paul', 'McCartney.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'worthy', 'praise', 'two', 'feel', 'deserve', 'special', 'attention', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'Johnson', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'perfomance', 'title', 'character', 'cult', 'super-hero', 'film', 'Kick-Ass', 'immersion', 'Lennon', 'character', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'was', 'so', 'thorough', 'was', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'veteran', 'actress', 'many', 'films', 'note', 'including', 'English', 'Patient', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'A', 'Funeral', 'Other', 'Boleyn', 'Girl', 'was', 'more', 'recognizable', 'more', 'remarkable', 'bringing', 'off', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'Lennon', 'Aunt', 'Mimi', 'woman', 'who', 'raised', 'age', 'five', 'bring', 'out', 'Mimi', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'portray', 'woman', 'who', 'tough', 'nails', 'making', 'hard', 'decisions', 'life', 'keeping', 'inner', 'feelings', 'herself', 'who', 'fact', 'have', 'feelings', 'now', 'then', 'must', 'come', 'out', 'people', 'fact', 'care', 'deeply', 'highly', 'challenging', 'role', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'off', 'magnificently', 'performances', 'are', 'Oscar-worthy', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Academy', 'will', 'give', 'recognition', 'so', 'richly', 'deserve.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interest', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Beatles', 'music', 'highly', 'important', 'period', 'simply', 'lives', 'musicians', 'how', 'become', 'people', 'world', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'extraordinarily', 'well-crafted', 'movie', 'stellar', 'performances', 'truly', 'moving', 'story']",Nowhere Boy
