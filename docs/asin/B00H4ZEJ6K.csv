While sometimes unfairly pigeonholed as a show that only people above a certain age can appreciate, I've found that this is endlessly rewatchable, highly entertaining programming for *everyone.* Few things make me happier than seeing how people of all generations and TV tastes can unite around a mutual affection for this eminently enjoyable, timeless gem!Unlike most of today's eye-rollingly slick, &#34;edgy&#34; shows that rely on high tech gizmos and gore, Murder, She Wrote's mysteries were the type of which the brilliant Dame Agatha Christie would approve, relying on the timeless tools of deductive reasoning and knowledge of human nature. Granted, most of these mysteries aren't as brilliantly plotted and paced as Christie's, but whose are?! Given the more limiting one-hour TV format, I found the majority of MSW's mysteries highly satisfying.This show remains engaging and well worth watching even after you already know 'whodunit'. How many mystery shows can one say THAT about?! As fellow fans have noted, there's joy in (re-)watching these fine actors' performances, identifying some of the best guest stars ever assembled, and especially in &#34;visiting&#34; the show's varied locales, most notably the cozy (albeit lethal!) enclave of Cabot Cove.The show contains heartwarming humor, an infectiously positive energy, and never gets bogged down in the tiresome romantic 'angst' that sinks so many other shows. Is it a touch corny? Absolutely! Yet somehow that's an asset here, contributing to the show's uniquely cozy charm.Best of all, there's something truly inspiring about a heroine who's neither young nor reliant on romantic relationships for her fulfillment, yet still leads a remarkably rich, full and happy life. It's sad how few fictional heroines fit that description!If, like me, you're on too tight a budget to splurge on all 12 seasons, I would bump Season 4 to the top of your 'must own' list. As others have noted, the Cabot Cove-based episodes are always among MSW's very best, and this season happens to feature some of the most eminently rewatchable Cabot Cove episodes of the whole series. We're also treated to a couple of highly amusing appearances by Grady, Jessica's hapless but adorably well-meaning nephew. Nearly every single episode this season represents Murder She Wrote at its most sublimely pleasurable. I've watched this season an embarrassing number of times (don't ask!), and somehow it never, ever gets old.I truly believe this is a series well worth owning and passing on from one generation to the next. I'm confident that most of my fellow mystery fans, regardless of age, will cherish this series as much as I do!",5,My very favorite of the show's 12 seasons,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,2870,"['are', 'sadly', 'few', 'series', 'manage', 'maintain', 'high', 'level', 'quality', 'even', 'three', 'four', 'seasons', 'so', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'ability', 'consistently', 'delight', '12', 'especially', 'laudable', 'sometimes', 'unfairly', 'pigeonholed', 'show', 'only', 'people', 'certain', 'age', 'can', 'appreciate', ""'ve"", 'found', 'endlessly', 'rewatchable', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'programming', '*everyone', 'Few', 'things', 'make', 'happier', 'seeing', 'how', 'people', 'generations', 'TV', 'tastes', 'can', 'unite', 'around', 'mutual', 'affection', 'eminently', 'enjoyable', 'timeless', 'gem', 'most', 'today', 'eye-rollingly', 'slick', '34', '34', 'shows', 'rely', 'high', 'tech', 'gizmos', 'gore', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'mysteries', 'were', 'type', 'brilliant', 'Dame', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'would', 'approve', 'relying', 'timeless', 'tools', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'knowledge', 'human', 'nature', 'Granted', 'most', 'mysteries', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'brilliantly', 'plotted', 'paced', 'Christie', 'are', 'more', 'limiting', 'one-hour', 'TV', 'format', 'found', 'majority', 'MSW', 'mysteries', 'highly', 'satisfying.This', 'show', 'engaging', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'already', 'know', ""'whodunit"", 'How', 'many', 'mystery', 'shows', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'about', 'fellow', 'fans', 'have', 'noted', 'joy', 're-', 'watching', 'fine', 'actors', 'performances', 'identifying', 'best', 'guest', 'stars', 'ever', 'assembled', 'especially', '34', 'visiting', '34', 'show', 'varied', 'locales', 'most', 'notably', 'cozy', 'lethal', 'enclave', 'Cabot', 'Cove.The', 'show', 'heartwarming', 'humor', 'infectiously', 'positive', 'energy', 'never', 'bogged', 'down', 'tiresome', 'romantic', ""'angst"", 'sinks', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'touch', 'corny', 'Absolutely', 'somehow', 'asset', 'here', 'contributing', 'show', 'uniquely', 'cozy', 'charm.Best', 'something', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'heroine', 'who', 'young', 'reliant', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'fulfillment', 'yet', 'still', 'remarkably', 'rich', 'full', 'happy', 'life', 'sad', 'how', 'few', 'fictional', 'heroines', 'fit', 'description', ""'re"", 'too', 'tight', 'budget', 'splurge', '12', 'seasons', 'would', 'bump', 'Season', '4', 'top', 'own', 'list', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Cabot', 'Cove-based', 'episodes', 'are', 'always', 'MSW', 'very', 'best', 'season', 'feature', 'most', 'eminently', 'rewatchable', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'episodes', 'whole', 'series', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'couple', 'highly', 'amusing', 'appearances', 'Grady', 'Jessica', 'hapless', 'adorably', 'well-meaning', 'nephew', 'Nearly', 'single', 'episode', 'season', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'most', 'sublimely', 'pleasurable', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'season', 'embarrassing', 'number', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'somehow', 'never', 'ever', 'old.I', 'truly', 'believe', 'series', 'well', 'owning', 'passing', 'one', 'generation', 'next', ""'m"", 'confident', 'most', 'fellow', 'mystery', 'fans', 'regardless', 'age', 'will', 'cherish', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'do']",N/A
